scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO ACTUAL TV NEWS FOOTAGE FROM 1981
text: A busy intersection near the UC Berkeley campus. A strange,
text: self-propelled motorized gurney whirrs into view and makes
text: its way over a pedestrian crosswalk. The passenger, MARK
text: O'BRIEN, in his early 30s, is visible only from the neck up.
text: The rest of him is covered by a blanket. He operates the
text: gurney with a mouth control and a set of mirrors positioned
text: around his head.
speaker_heading: NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)
dialog: Mark O'Brien has been going to UC
dialog: Berkeley since 1978. That's O'Brien
text: in the motorized gurney heading for
dialog: class last week.
text: The gurney continues along a leafy promenade on the campus.
text: Passers-by just go about their normal business.
speaker_heading: NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)
dialog: He had polio when he was 6 years
text: old. The disease left his body
text: crippled but his mind remained
text: sharp and alert, and since he
dialog: wanted to be a writer, Mark O'Brien
dialog: entered Cal to major in English and
dialog: learn his trade.
text: We hear a voice reciting a verse of poetry as we follow Mark
text: in his contraption.
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: Graduation
dialog: Today I hear the crowd's applause
dialog: Receive congratulations from my
dialog: friends
dialog: Today I ask if I've found a place
dialog: among the rest
dialog: I hope you see a man upon this
dialog: stage
dialog: Who studied...read..wrote, and
dialog: passed the test
dialog: In cap and gown, diploma on my
dialog: chair
text: THE SCENE CHANGES to the interior of a large auditorium. A
text: graduation ceremony is in progress. Suddenly, everyone in
text: the hall, GRADUATES, their FAMILIES, ACADEMICS and OTHERS,
text: rise to their feet as Mark, in his gurney, buzzes across the
text: stage, a mortar board hung on one of the handles.
dialog: 1A.
speaker_heading: NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)
dialog: And so, Mark O'Brien graduates from
dialog: Cal, one of 250 English majors to
dialog: receive degrees today.
dialog: 2.
text: The DEAN steps forward, congratulates Mark and places a
text: diploma on his blanket. The gurney makes its way across the
text: rest of the stage to thunderous applause.
text: THE SCENE CHANGES BACK to the campus exterior. The news
text: reporter talks to camera.
speaker_heading: NEWS REPORTER
dialog: If this report tells us anything,
dialog: it is that a disability is not
dialog: necessarily a handicap.
text: In the background, Mark's family and friends are gathered

scene_heading: SUPER CAPTION: "A FEW YEARS LATER"
scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MARK'S. NIGHT
dialog: 2 2
text: It is about 4.00 a.m. All is quiet. We follow a mean-looking
text: alley cat to the front of a modest, ground-floor apartment.
text: It pauses, then slinks round the side, onto a ledge and in
text: through a partially-opened window.
scene_heading: INT. MARK'S PLACE. NIGHT
dialog: 3 3
text: The cat comes through the window, hops onto the floor and
text: quickly finds a nice little plate of food scraps that has
text: been set out specially. As it settles down to its meal, we
text: become aware of a heavy and regular sound, like a ship's
text: pump, coming from somewhere close-by.
text: In the center of the room is an object that looks like a prop
text: from a `50s sci-fi movie. A human head protrudes from one
text: end. The object is an iron lung, and its purpose is to keep
text: its occupant, Mark O'Brien, breathing. Every 4.5 seconds, the
text: pump mechanism creates a vacuum inside, forcing Mark's chest
text: to expand and suck in air. He is fast asleep.
dialog: 2A.
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: Breathing
dialog: Look you
dialog: This most excellent canopy, the
dialog: air,
dialog: Presses down upon me
dialog: At 15 pounds per square inch
text: A dense, heavy, blue-glowing ocean.
dialog: Teasing me with its nearness and
dialog: immensity.
dialog: And all I get is a thin stream of
dialog: it.
text: A finger's width of the rope that
dialog: ties me to life.
text: Having now eaten its fill, the cat has a good scratch, then
text: wanders over to the iron lung.
dialog: 3.
text: It hops up onto the small platform that supports Mark's head
text: and slides itself along his face, once this way, once the
text: other way, then jumps on top of the iron lung and walks its
text: length. Through the portholes, we just make out the shape of
text: Mark's bent, undersize body. Suddenly, Mark's nose twitches.
text: He opens his eyes and grimaces.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Shit!
text: His face continues to contort as he tries to cope with the
text: terrible itching. He shakes his head violently, then stops
text: suddenly and closes his eyes. We hear his thoughts.
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, just focus. Now, scratch
dialog: with your mind, okay, your mind,
dialog: scratch with your mind...
text: After a couple more nose twitches, he settles down. It seems
text: to have worked. In his peripheral vision, Mark can see the
text: cat making itself comfortable in a corner chair, one of the
text: only other pieces of furniture in the room. The first hints
text: of dawn start to appear through the curtains. They
text: illuminate a large framed portrait of the Virgin Mary hanging
text: on the wall. Mark acknowledges it.
speaker_heading: MARK (CONT'D)
dialog: Good morning.
text: Sunlight streams in, making the picture look truly sacred.
scene_heading: EXT. MARK'S PLACE. DAY
dialog: 4 4
text: JOAN, a solid but slovenly woman in her late 30s, walks up to

dialog: herself in.
scene_heading: INT. MARK'S PLACE. DAY
dialog: 5 5
text: She comes in.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Good morning.
text: Mark does not immediately acknowledge her.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You're late.
speaker_heading: A LITTLE LATER
text: The center of the iron lung, basically a thin mattress, has
text: been slid out, and Joan is in the process of giving Mark a
text: bed bath. He is frail and helpless.
dialog: 4.
text: There is a look of resentment in his eyes as this apparently
text: unfeeling woman exercises total control over him, at least
dialog: temporarily.
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: Joan
dialog: I swear this was one crazy bitch
dialog: Who'd swing me about enough to
dialog: scare me,
dialog: But careful enough so she could
dialog: say:
dialog: "Now what was all the yelling
dialog: about? You polios are screamers.
dialog: Always were."
dialog: I didn't say a word, but typed my
dialog: skinny novel in my head,
dialog: And thought about revenge.
text: In the course of washing his private parts, Mark has an
text: involuntary erection. Joan gives him a shriveling look. He
text: feels belittled and humiliated.
speaker_heading: A LITTLE LATER
text: Mark is on his side, his trousers are on and she is buttoning
text: up a bright red shirt. It is an awkward business. They do it
text: in silence, avoiding eye contact as much as possible.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MARK'S PLACE. DAY
dialog: 6 6
text: Joan pushes Mark along in a gurney, similar, but slightly
text: different from the one in the news clip. There are no mirrors
text: and no motor, just an oxygen tank, a tube and a mouthpiece
text: just next to Mark's mouth. Most of him is covered with a
text: colorful blanket. The whole thing is a sports-coupe version
text: of his iron lung.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Would you mind if I asked you a
dialog: favor?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You need help moving furniture?
text: She has no apparent sense of humor.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: I need an advance on my pay, like
dialog: two weeks. That's not a big ask, is
dialog: it?
text: Mark looks rightfully shocked.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What if you don't last another two
dialog: weeks?
dialog: 4A.
text: He gives her a look, and means it. We hear his thoughts.
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Joan never failed to put me in a
dialog: crappy mood. It was also a drag
dialog: that I was no longer allowed to use
text: my other gurney, the self-propelled
dialog: one. It had caused a couple of
dialog: spectacular accidents.
text: They turn a corner and approach a church.
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Basically, in spite of all the
dialog: mirrors, I couldn't see where I was
dialog: going.

text: Joan pushes Mark's gurney into the sanctuary.
scene_heading: INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH. DAY
dialog: 7 7
text: FATHER BRENDAN is giving a sermon. Mark listens with
dialog: satisfaction. There are not many others there.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: The Apostle Luke tells us that when
dialog: Elizabeth spoke to Mary, the baby
dialog: in her womb leapt - "For lo, as
dialog: soon as the voice of thy salutation
dialog: sounded in mine ears, the babe
dialog: leaped in my womb for joy". So
text: Mary's fear and apprehension slowly
dialog: gave way to pride and purpose.
dialog: Elizabeth saw the greatness in
dialog: Mary. "Blessed art thou among
dialog: women". Elizabeth, pregnant herself
dialog: with St. John, felt the power of
dialog: this wondrous woman. It was
dialog: Elizabeth, and her absolute faith,
dialog: that gave Mary the courage she was
dialog: lacking, and she gave thanks
dialog: saying: "My soul doth magnify the
dialog: Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced
dialog: in God my Saviour".
dialog: May the spirit of the Lord be
dialog: amongst you and remain with you
dialog: always.
text: Mass is over. PEOPLE come up to Mark and place a hand on his
text: head or chest and say, "God bless you." In the background we
dialog: can also hear Father Brendan.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: May the peace of the Lord be with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: PARISHIONERS
dialog: And also with you.
speaker_heading: A LITTLE LATER
dialog: 5A.
scene_heading: 7A INT. SIDE CHAPEL. DAY 7A
text: Mark waits alone in a tiny chapel off to the side of the
text: church. He turns his head, takes a suck on the mouthpiece of
text: his portable respirator, then looks around at the impressive
text: stained glass windows. The expression on Mark's face is that
dialog: of a true believer.
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: I'm definitely a true believer. But
dialog: I believe in a God with a sense of
dialog: humor. A wicked sense of humor. One
dialog: who created me in His own image.
text: Father Brendan enters. There is an awkward short moment when
text: he realizes that there is no point in offering to shake
text: hands. For no good reason, he nods instead.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: Hello. I'm Father Brendan. I don't
dialog: think we've met.
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No, we haven't. I'm Mark O'Brien. I
dialog: knew Father Seamus very well. I'm
dialog: sorry that he's not here any more.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: As are many others. I'm going to do
dialog: my best to fill his shoes. I
dialog: understand you'd like me to hear
dialog: your confession.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes, I would. By the way, I enjoyed
dialog: Mass. I liked your tone.
text: Father Brendan is not sure how to take this.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You don't believe absolute privacy
dialog: is an essential part of the
dialog: confessional, do you?
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: No, I do not. I believe sincerity
dialog: is the most essential part.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I told my attendant to come back in
dialog: half an hour. Is that okay?
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: Yes, take your time. I'm in no
dialog: rush.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Did Father Seamus say anything to
dialog: you about me?
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: No one said anything to me about
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I can be a bit time consuming, but
dialog: I'm worth the trouble.
text: Father Brendan breaks a smile for the first time.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: I'm here for you Mark.
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Look, this is not exactly a
dialog: confession. I haven't yet done the
dialog: deed. I was hoping to sort of get a
dialog: quote in advance.
text: Father Brendan sits down.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: Tell me what's on your mind.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: The most immediate thing on my mind
dialog: would be my attendant, Joan. I'm
text: thinking of getting rid of her.
dialog: It's an evil thought, but I can't
dialog: help it.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: Is she dishonest, or incompetent?
speaker_heading: MARK
text: No, neither of those. She looks at
dialog: me the wrong way. It's that you-
dialog: need-me-more-than-I-need-you look.
dialog: I'd like to show her she's wrong,
dialog: just for the evil satisfaction it
dialog: will give me. Is that a sin,
dialog: Father?
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: Well, it obviously troubles you.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes, it troubles me a lot. Because
dialog: maybe it's really a power trip. Me
dialog: against her. Me against the world.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: I really wouldn't worry too much
dialog: about that. The question is whether
dialog: you like having her around.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I can't stand her.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: Then get rid of her. If I were in a
dialog: position to choose, I'd get someone
dialog: nice. Even it was a power trip.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Then I have your blessing to fire
dialog: her?
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: Unofficially, yes.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: That's good enough for me.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: Please, if ever you feel I can be
dialog: useful, do let me know. It was a
dialog: pleasure talking with you.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Same here.

text: We see a pencil eraser on the end of a stick slowly tapping
text: the keys on an electric typewriter. At the other end of the

scene_heading: INT. MARK'S PLACE. DAY
dialog: 12 12
text: From Mark's POV, Amanda slides him out of the iron lung. It

speaker_heading: AMANDA

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Three or four hours. Depends

text: It is some time later. Amanda is giving Mark a massage. With
text: enormous satisfaction, he feels her curvy parts moving around

speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: She'd count in French before

speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: What did the boyfriend think?
dialog: That I was in his way?
dialog: I'm always in somebody's way, I

speaker_heading: MARK

speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: He thinks you're some kind of

speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Did you ever discuss sex with your

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No. That would have been

speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: That's the way they saw the world.
dialog: It wasn't just that polite people
dialog: didn't think about sex. No-one did.
dialog: It was never discussed. As far as
dialog: they were concerned, there was
dialog: nothing down there.
text: Laura listens. She is pretty in a dark, angular way. A phone
text: on her desk rings.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Sorry about that.
text: She walks over to it, pushes a button, then comes back. She
text: has a noticeable limp.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What's that from?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Cerebral palsy.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You'd hardly notice.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: People notice. It's not easy, the
dialog: whole thing, attracting a guy,
dialog: dating, sex, all very problematic.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I find that hard to believe in your
dialog: case.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Well, you better believe it.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: So, what sort of chance do you give
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Of achieving your romantic fantasy?

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Look, there's no need to pull any
dialog: punches. You can be as direct as
dialog: you like with me.
text: She smiles.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Mark, I'm just a humble sex
dialog: therapist. I try to help people
dialog: with sex problems that can be
dialog: addressed. Your problem, I
dialog: understand, is that you have never
dialog: had sex.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: That's correct.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Would I be correct in assuming
dialog: you're unable to masturbate?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Correct.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Has anyone done it for you?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Have you ever asked anyone?
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Not specifically. I asked someone
dialog: to marry me. She declined. Does
dialog: that come close to masturbation?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: You know, being with the person you
dialog: love is not the only way of
dialog: expressing yourself sexually. There
dialog: are people called sex surrogates.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Oh?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Psychotherapists and psychiatrists
dialog: are not allowed to have sex with
dialog: their clients, even if it seems
dialog: like a good idea. Sex surrogates
dialog: don't have that limitation.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Would this be covered by my medical
dialog: benefits?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Unfortunately, no. You'd have to
dialog: pay the full fee, whatever that
dialog: was.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: So, basically, I would be paying
dialog: for sex.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Yes Mark, you would be paying for
dialog: sex. But the person you would be
dialog: paying is not a hooker. She is a
dialog: highly trained and sensitive
dialog: professional, who is not motivated
dialog: by money. Just as I'm not. In fact,
dialog: you can think of a surrogate as an
dialog: extension of me. Do I seem like a
dialog: hooker to you?

speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: It depends how many sessions you

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Say, one, just to try it and see if
dialog: I like it.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: I'm sorry, it doesn't work that
dialog: way. It's a process. You have to be
dialog: patient with yourself. There can be
dialog: quite a lot of talking involved.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I've set aside $500. Do you think

speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Well, one way or another, it's a

dialog: therapist, a particular sort of
text: therapist, a sex therapist.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: MARK

speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: Don't worry about it. Go on.
text: Mark pauses to take a few breaths on his oxygen mouthpiece,
text: then goes on.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: This therapist suggested I could
dialog: work with a sexual specialist, have
dialog: sex with someone known as a sex
dialog: surrogate, who would be sensitive
dialog: to my special needs. I've been
dialog: giving it some thought.
text: Father Brendan interrupts him.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: Hold on. What do you mean "have
dialog: sex"?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Well, I don't really know how to
dialog: describe...
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: Sorry, that wasn't what... I mean,
dialog: are we talking about sexual
dialog: intercourse?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: Outside marriage?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I did do my best on the question of
dialog: marriage.

speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: What is the difference between this

dialog: prostitute?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I don't know, but I think there's a
dialog: difference.
dialog: 23A.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: How do you know she's not some
text: hooker gussied up as a social
dialog: worker, who's just going to rob
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I trust what my therapist said
dialog: about her.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: How old are you?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Thirty-eight.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: Why exactly now?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I never had any spare cash before.
dialog: That's a major factor, and I'm
dialog: probably getting close to my use-by

speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: And this is what you want my advice
dialog: about? Fornication?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Your advice as a friend.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: And do I have the casting vote, so
dialog: to speak?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Let's say I value your advice just
dialog: as much as I do the therapist's.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: You're serious, aren't you?
speaker_heading: MARK

speaker_heading: MARK

speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: The other thing is, there is a

speaker_heading: MARK

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: What is the iron lung for?
speaker_heading: MARK

speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: That's great. Do you have any areas
dialog: of unusual sensitivity? Any parts
dialog: of your body you don't want me to
dialog: touch?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I have normal sensitivity all over.
dialog: It's just that my muscles don't
dialog: work. You can touch me anywhere.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Shall we get undressed then?
text: Mark is taken by surprise by the suddenness of it. He
text: hesitates momentarily.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Sure.
text: Cheryl starts to unbutton his shirt. Mark's terror is visible
text: in his eyes and she can also feel his heart palpitating. She
text: starts to slowly extract one of Mark's arms from his shirt-
text: sleeve. Suddenly, he lets out a piercing scream.
speaker_heading: MARK (CONT'D)
dialog: Ow! Ow! Stop! It hurts!
text: She recoils, shocked.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Holy Mother of God!
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Tell me what's wrong.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: My fingers! They're caught!
text: She discovers that his fingers have been snagged in the
text: fabric of the shirt and his fingers are being bent backward.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Okay, okay, I've got it. Don't
dialog: worry.
text: She carefully frees his fingers and eases the sleeve off.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Be careful, please.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Mark, I'm going to be really
dialog: careful with you. I don't want to
dialog: hurt or injure you in any way, but
dialog: it's really not sexy when you yell
dialog: at me. Okay?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I won't yell at you any more.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: But you'll tell me calmly the
dialog: moment anything starts to hurt?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Now, let's do the other arm.
text: Little by little, she extracts the other arm. He grimaces his
text: way through it, but more in fear than in pain. She finally
text: sets his shirt down on the end of the bed.
speaker_heading: CHERYL (CONT'D)
dialog: Nice shirt.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You already said that.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Did I? I guess I'm a little
text: anxious, too.
text: She undoes the top of his pants.
speaker_heading: CHERYL (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, I'm going to slide these
dialog: down. Hold your breath.
text: She pulls. He screams, in fear more than pain.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Shit, fuck! No, don't do that!
dialog: 36A.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM. DAY
dialog: 54 54
text: Cheryl sits down on the edge of the tub and takes a couple of
text: deep breaths.
dialog: 37.
scene_heading: INT. CARMEN'S PLACE. DAY
dialog: 55 55
text: Mark, his body now under the sheets, looks towards the
text: bathroom door. He can hear the sound of water running. He
text: looks at a wall clock and notes the passing of time.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM. DAY
dialog: 56 56
text: Cheryl turns off the tap. She has done a great job of pulling
text: herself together, and is wrapped in a kimono, which she has
dialog: brought herself.
scene_heading: INT. CARMEN'S PLACE. DAY
dialog: 57 57
text: Cheryl emerges from the bathroom and starts to undress.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Ready?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No.
text: Cheryl continues undressing, Mark looks away.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Okay, the difference between me and
dialog: a prostitute is that I don't want
dialog: your return business. I'm here to
dialog: help you communicate about your
dialog: sexual feelings, so you can share
text: them with a future partner.
text: She stands there for a few moments, but he keeps his eyes
text: averted. She turns back the sheets, gets into bed beside him
text: and he finally looks at her.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Whenever I'm naked, everyone else
text: in the room is usually dressed. Now
dialog: that I'm in bed with another naked
dialog: person, I'm very confused.
text: She strokes his hair.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: So, why is it confusing?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'd always expected that God, or my
dialog: parents, would intervene to keep
text: this moment from happening.
text: She slides her hand down. She can feel his heart thumping.
dialog: 37A.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Mark, close your eyes and focus on
dialog: your sense of touch.
text: He closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: CHERYL (CONT'D)
dialog: I'd like you to tell me how it
dialog: feels each time I touch a different
dialog: part of your body. If something
dialog: feels good, tell me. If something
dialog: feels ticklish or bothers you, let
dialog: me know. I don't want you to
dialog: tolerate anything. I'm going to
dialog: start with the top of your head...
text: She strokes his hair.
speaker_heading: CHERYL (CONT'D)
dialog: You have soft hair. It's nice to
dialog: the touch. So you like it?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I do.
text: She moves her fingers round behind his ear, then the front of
text: his ear.
speaker_heading: MARK (CONT'D)
dialog: That feels weird.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Weird good? Or weird bad?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Just weird.
text: She moves her hand down his neck.
speaker_heading: MARK (CONT'D)
dialog: Good.
text: His shoulder.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Still good?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Everything good so far, except the
dialog: ear.
text: She moves her fingers along his side, very, very lightly. For
dialog: Mark, so far, this is the best.
dialog: 37B.
speaker_heading: MARK (CONT'D)
dialog: Are these the body awareness
dialog: exercises?
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: You're clever to have worked that
dialog: out.
text: Her hands massage their way down his torso. Mark's reactions
dialog: are a little like shock waves.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: People tell me I'm very perceptive.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Would you like to see what I feel
dialog: like?
text: She carefully takes his hand and caresses the fingers around
text: one of her breasts, then puts his hand back.
text: Cheryl's hands move further down his body.
speaker_heading: CHERYL (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you wearing cologne?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Mmm, my favorite brand. Okay, I'm
dialog: going to move my hand along your
dialog: stomach... and down to your pen...
text: The expression on Mark's face changes to one of shock, then
text: agony, then ecstasy.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Oh, oh.
speaker_heading: 58 OMITTED 58
scene_heading: INT. CARMEN'S PLACE. DAY
dialog: 59 59
text: The clock on the mantelpiece says 12:48. Cheryl is now fully
text: dressed. She snaps open her briefcase, takes out a diary with
text: a pen attached, then walks over to the bed, sits down beside
text: Mark and flips through the pages.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Next week, Friday the twentieth,
dialog: same time?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: That's good for me.
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Next time we'll start to work on
dialog: intercourse.
text: She gathers her things together and gets up.
speaker_heading: CHERYL (CONT'D)
dialog: Were you afraid at the thought of
dialog: seeing me?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I was terrified.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: You can be proud of yourself. You
dialog: did great. We've made real
dialog: progress.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Can I ask you something?
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Of course. What would you like to
dialog: ask?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Anything, really. Tell me something
dialog: about yourself. Anything.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Sure. I'm a very private person. I
dialog: have a private life, I do need you
dialog: to be aware of that, but that's
dialog: about it. This therapy is about
dialog: you.
text: There is a discreet knock at the front door and then a key
text: turns in the lock. A few moments later, Carmen and Vera come
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Welcome back.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Perfect timing.
speaker_heading: CARMEN
dialog: I hope you guys kept the noise
dialog: down.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET NEAR CARMEN'S. DAY
dialog: 60 60
text: Vera wheels Mark back the way they came. She is very discreet
text: and they travel in silence for a while. Finally, curiosity
text: overcomes her.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: How do you feel?
speaker_heading: MARK
text: Cleansed and victorious.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: Doesn't get any better than that.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Tell me about your first sexual
dialog: experience.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: Let me think. It wasn't all that
dialog: pleasant. I mean, it was consensual
dialog: and everything, and I really was in
dialog: love with the guy, but his dick
dialog: seemed enormous to me, I didn't
dialog: think it would fit. It was scary.
dialog: But he was nice. I guess he
dialog: couldn't help it.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Was he Chinese?
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: Are you kidding? I only hung out
dialog: with white guys at high school.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Why is that?
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: I don't know. To stick it to my mum
dialog: and dad, I suppose.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Are they happy now you've got a
dialog: Chinese boyfriend?
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: They're happy. I'm happy.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What's his dick like?
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: Perfect size.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Why do you call it a dick instead
dialog: of a penis?
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: Penis sounds like some vegetable
dialog: you don't want to eat. Dick sounds
dialog: like what it is.
text: They continue in silence for a little while.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: The thing is, it was all over so
dialog: damn quickly.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: Yes, tell me about it.
scene_heading: EXT. CHERYL'S PLACE. NIGHT

text: Cheryl's car is parked outside. The house is mostly dark.
scene_heading: INT. CHERYL'S PLACE. NIGHT
dialog: 62 62
text: Cheryl is at a tiny desk, dictating into a recorder.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: First session. Mark is the oldest
dialog: of four children and raised
dialog: Catholic. He was extremely nervous.
dialog: He yelled a lot when I took off his
dialog: shirt, but I think more out of fear
text: than pain. He cannot masturbate.
dialog: Has only had the occasional kissing
dialog: experience. He is capable of
text: achieving an erection easily, but
text: the unusual curvature of his body
dialog: could be a serious obstacle to
dialog: intercourse.
text: She puts the recorder away in a file drawer and locks the
text: drawer with a key, which she keeps with her.
scene_heading: INT. CHERYL'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
dialog: 63 63
text: Cheryl gets into bed beside her husband JOSH, who is
text: apparently asleep.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: This gentleman I just started
text: working with. He spends most of his
text: life trapped in a big metal box.
text: Her husband Josh turns over and mumbles something completely
text: incomprehensible. She nudges him.
speaker_heading: CHERYL (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you hear what I said?
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Yes, I heard what you said. You're
dialog: a saint.

scene_heading: INT. SIDE CHAPEL. DAY

text: Mark is in the little side chapel with Father Brendan.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I don't know what I had envisaged
dialog: it would be like, the first time I
dialog: mean. But that wasn't the image I
dialog: had. I thought there would be more
dialog: to it. Not that it was unpleasant.
dialog: After all, I was in bed with a
dialog: naked woman. She complimented me on
text: my shirt and my hair. She held my
dialog: penis. I haven't even seen my penis
dialog: for over thirty years. Anyway,
dialog: onward. Am I sharing too much?
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: No, I'm used to it.
scene_heading: INT. MARK'S PLACE. NIGHT
dialog: 65 65
text: Mark is in his iron lung. With his mouth stick, he turns the
dialog: page of one of those anatomical instruction books on sex.
text: There are the typical graphic cross-section diagrams of
text: penises entering vaginas. Ravel's "Bolero" plays quietly in
text: the background as he reads to himself.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: "Sometimes the head of the penis
dialog: may be too large to penetrate the

dialog: case the application of lubricant
dialog: is recommended to avoid
dialog: possible..." Oh, my God!
scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MARK'S PLACE. DAY
dialog: 66 66
text: This time Rod is wheeling Mark. He seems only slightly less
text: anxious than the first time, but still noticeably anxious.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: What's on the menu today?
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: We're attempting intercourse.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Uh-huh. That's a big one.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What do you think of it?
dialog: Intercourse.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Overrated, but necessary. There's
dialog: plenty of other ways of achieving
dialog: the same result, but somehow you
dialog: don't feel you've actually done it
dialog: till you've gone all the way in.
text: This does not help Mark's state of mind.

speaker_heading: CHERYL

text: He lifts his eyes. She pauses.
speaker_heading: CHERYL (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you like watching me undress?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I do.
text: As she moves towards the bed, almost naked, the last thing
text: she takes off is her bra.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: From now on...
text: She pulls back the bed covers and gets into bed with Mark.
speaker_heading: CHERYL (CONT'D)
dialog: You're going to start to understand
dialog: the signals from your body...
text: Their bodies touch. He looks blissful.
speaker_heading: CHERYL (CONT'D)
dialog: ...and learn how to control...
dialog: Then suddenly...
dialog: 43A.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Oh God! Oh God!

speaker_heading: MARK (CONT'D)
dialog: Damn! Shit!
scene_heading: INT. SIDE CHAPEL. DAY
dialog: 69 69
text: Mark is in the side chapel with Father Brendan.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I did it again. This time, I
text: ejaculated on her thigh.
text: Father Brendan winces.
speaker_heading: MARK (CONT'D)
dialog: I felt cursed, that the whole
dialog: enterprise was cursed. It seemed
dialog: like a totally just punishment. God
dialog: wasn't actually denying my
dialog: sexuality. He was merely pointing
dialog: out to me how useless it was.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: It's amazing to me how often God is
dialog: brought into the sex act. I
dialog: understand that even amongst non-
dialog: believers, the most common
dialog: expression of sexual ecstasy is
dialog: "Oh, God!"

text: Cheryl returns from the bathroom and slides back into bed.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Okay, I don't want to hear any more
dialog: about God cursing you. I want the
dialog: credit. It was my overpowering
dialog: beauty that did it. It took you by
dialog: surprise. Now, where were we?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What do you mean, where were we?
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: I'm going to touch you... I'm
dialog: touching you... and when we both
dialog: feel you're aroused, then I'm going
dialog: to guide you into my vagina.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Is there anything I need to do?
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Close your eyes, feel your body,
dialog: that's all you need to do.
text: Mark closes his eyes. In his mind's eye, he sees the saintly
text: figures in the beautiful stained glass windows of the church
text: with the afternoon sun blazing through. An equally saintly,
text: but naked Amanda floats towards him, her arms beckoning.
text: When he opens his eyes, Cheryl is straddling him, but in a
text: Leaning Tower of Pisa sort of way. It is a struggle for her,
text: but somehow she is managing to get Mark into a workable
text: position for intercourse. Suddenly, he panics.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: It won't fit. It's not going to
dialog: fit.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: No, Mark, it will fit just fine.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No, it's dangerous. It's too big.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: It's not too big. Relax.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: It won't fit. It'll hurt. It's too
dialog: risky.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Please, stop this. I promise you,
dialog: nothing bad will happen. Now, let's
dialog: try again while you're still hard.
text: She attempts to guide him in again. Mark grimaces, makes a
text: strange noise. We realize that he has just ejaculated again

speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Stop being sorry. And stop reading

text: She snuggles up beside Mark.
speaker_heading: CHERYL (CONT'D)
dialog: We still have some time. We can
dialog: talk, which you seem to like, or
dialog: you can suck on my nipples, which
dialog: you also seem to like. Or, which

speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Mark seemed to be at his most
dialog: relaxed when I sucked his penis. At
text: the moment he is fixated on penis-
text: vagina and his anxiety is focused
dialog: around that. The root of his
dialog: anxiety is his parents and his
dialog: religion. He believes he doesn't
dialog: deserve sex. He believes he is
dialog: responsible for his little sister's

dialog: Cheryl, or any other woman. Maybe
dialog: intercourse would prove I was an
dialog: adult. Maybe I don't want to cross
dialog: that line. Maybe this was a bad
dialog: idea.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: Do you want to know what I think?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: I'd forget the psychobabble. I grew

text: We see Cheryl from the breasts up. We hear violent coughing
text: from down below.
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: I'm choking
text: Cheryl moves away. We realize she has been perched astride
text: his face, more or less. The coughing continues. Mark looks a
text: bit panicked.
speaker_heading: MARK
text: The mouth-piece.
dialog: 52.
text: Cheryl locates the mouth-piece to his oxygen supply and puts
text: it between his lips. After a few breaths he is relatively
text: relaxed. She lies down beside him.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: I guess that one's off the menu
dialog: until further notice.
text: Mark finally lets go of the mouth-piece. He looks melancholy.
text: She does not fail to notice.
speaker_heading: CHERYL (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, lighten up, will you.
text: Mark smiles. He seems to be lost in some memory.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Pony girl, Pony girl,
dialog: Won't you be my pony girl?
text: He looks at Cheryl.
speaker_heading: MARK (CONT'D)
dialog: That was what my father used to
dialog: sing to my little sister, Karin.
dialog: That was before she died. She was
dialog: kind of a sad little girl. It
dialog: didn't do much good. I'm really
dialog: sorry that the last time I saw her,
dialog: I fought with her. I made her cry.
text: Mark's eyes begin to look teary.
speaker_heading: MARK (CONT'D)
dialog: My parents could have left me in
dialog: the nursing home, you know. They
dialog: found out the average life
dialog: expectancy for polios in nursing
dialog: homes was 18 months. So they took
dialog: me home. They gave me a life.
text: Cheryl props herself up on one elbow.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Mark, I'm just going to go the
dialog: bathroom for a quick pee. When I
dialog: come back, we're going to achieve
dialog: full penetration. But before I go,
dialog: I want you to close your eyes.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Is this a game?
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: No, it's not a game. Just do as I
dialog: say. Close your eyes.

speaker_heading: CHERYL

speaker_heading: MARK

speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Do you really feel like him?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes, I really feel like him.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: But can you really picture him?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I don't understand what you mean. I
dialog: said I can feel like him. Of course
dialog: I can picture him.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: From the outside, I mean, as an
dialog: adult, as you are now, looking at
text: him with his crew cut and his
dialog: little face?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: And are you mad at him? Do you

text: Brendan looks over his shoulder. They finally pass. Mark
dialog: continues.
speaker_heading: MARK (CONT'D)
text: I found the sound of her peeing
text: incredibly erotic, and the sound of

dialog: slowly and think of something
dialog: delicious.
text: Mark thinks. Through his mind's eye, we see a succession of
text: images. Fingertips stroking a cat's fur. In the background,
text: the sound of tom-toms. A tribal initiation rite. Drums,
text: dancing, trances. Then Ravel's "Bolero". Clint Eastwood
text: saying "make my day". Suddenly, and with a big yell, Mark
dialog: comes.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Aahh!

speaker_heading: CHERYL

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: To answer your earlier question, I
dialog: grew up in Salem, brought up
dialog: Catholic, like you, but the church
dialog: didn't appreciate my attitude
dialog: towards sex.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You had an attitude towards sex?
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Yes, I liked it. They like to think
dialog: they threw me out, but I threw them
dialog: out. So for years I didn't believe
dialog: in anything, and now I'm converting
dialog: to Judaism.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I guess it's good to have some kind
dialog: of insurance.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: I didn't think of that.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Then why are you doing it?
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: My husband asked me to do it before
dialog: his grandmother dies. The idea is,
dialog: if it makes her happy and him
dialog: happy, then it will do the same for
dialog: me. Our son is neutral on the
dialog: subject, but theoretically, if it
dialog: looks like it makes me happy, it'll
dialog: make him happy too. That's the way
dialog: my husband's family talks, and
dialog: thinks. The fact that I'm happy
dialog: already, doesn't seem to be
dialog: relevant.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What's your son's name?
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Tony. He's 14 years-old and very
dialog: smart. You'd like him.
text: Cheryl and Mark lie together in contented silence for a
dialog: while.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Does he know what you do?
dialog: 56A.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: He knows I'm a sex therapist.
text: There's a certificate on the wall.
dialog: But he hasn't had sex yet. So...
dialog: How much can he really know? He's
dialog: not a boy, he's not a man.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: How much do you want him to know?
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Well, I want him to have some idea
dialog: in his head. I hope it's a nice
dialog: one.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What does your husband do?
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: He's a philosopher.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Wow! You mean, like, at a
dialog: university?
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: No, in his own mind. He runs the
dialog: house, plays guitar, thinks a lot.
text: She notices the time.
speaker_heading: CHERYL (CONT'D)
dialog: It's kind of late.
text: She gets up and starts to get dressed.
speaker_heading: CHERYL (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, we did really good stuff
dialog: today. You were fantastic. You're a
text: fully fledged male homo sapiens
text: endowed with a handsome and
text: substantial penis which now has a
dialog: proven track record. You should be
dialog: pleased.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Was I really inside you?
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: You were really and truly inside

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: For how long?
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Five or six seconds.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Is that all?
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: That's a long time for some people.
dialog: You were pretty excited. I don't
dialog: know what you were thinking about.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'm sorry, I couldn't tell one
dialog: thing from another. It was all a
text: jumble of sensations.
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Well, you definitely achieved
dialog: penetration. It was penis-vagina
dialog: all the way. And you definitely get
dialog: an A for orgasm.
text: She is ready to go. She comes over to Mark and kisses him on
dialog: the cheek.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Did you come?
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: No, Mark, I didn't.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Can we try for that next time?

speaker_heading: MARK

dialog: No, no, stay. Is this going to be a
dialog: regular thing?
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: The therapy.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: I don't know. I'm not the
dialog: therapist.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: What sort of a therapist is she,
dialog: really?
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: I told you the first time, she's a
dialog: sex therapist.
text: The clerk looks at her closely. She appears to have a
text: completely straight face.
speaker_heading: VERA (CONT'D)
dialog: Today they're working on

speaker_heading: CLERK

speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Don't you say that to all the
dialog: girls?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes, but I always mean it.
text: They kiss. Then Cheryl's head slides down and disappears from
dialog: view.
speaker_heading: CHERYL (V.O.)
dialog: Remember about the breathing.
dialog: Concentrate on breathing out rather
dialog: than in. Think of anything neutral.
text: Sky, water, trees, ships, music,
dialog: nothing too dramatic.
text: Mark closes his eyes.
scene_heading: INT. SIDE CHAPEL. DAY
speaker_heading: 130 130
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: The first time, I really didn't

dialog: happened in my head.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 70-71.
speaker_heading: MARK (CONT'D)
dialog: This time it did, and my head has

text: breathing. Also in her breathing.
scene_heading: INT. SIDE CHAPEL. DAY
dialog: 134 134
text: The expression of elation on Mark's face morphs dramatically
dialog: into something else.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Then afterwards, there was this

speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Mark achieved an erection as soon

dialog: suggested, and I was able to get on
text: top and guide him in quite easily.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM. DAY
dialog: 139 139
text: We see Mark's face from Cheryl's POV. His eyes are still

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Is it in? Is it really in?
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Yes, it's really in.
text: We hear Mark's thoughts.
speaker_heading: MARK (V.0.)
dialog: I couldn't believe it.
text: We hear the sound of typing.
scene_heading: INT. MARK'S PLACE. DAY
speaker_heading: 140 140
text: Mark is in his iron lung, typing. At the top of the page, we
text: can see the title of the piece:
dialog: "On Seeing a Sex Surrogate" Page 8.
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: I was finally there. Too soon, I
dialog: came. But she kept holding me
text: inside her. Then a look of pleasure
text: brushed lightly over her face...
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM. DAY
dialog: 141 141
text: We see Cheryl's face from Mark's POV. It is as beatific as we
dialog: have ever seen it.
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: ... as though an all-day itch were
dialog: finally being scratched. Letting me
text: go, she put her hands down on the
dialog: bed by my shoulders and kissed my
dialog: chest. This act of affection moved

text: Cheryl's actions follow Mark's description.
scene_heading: INT. SIDE CHAPEL. DAY
speaker_heading: 142 142

dialog: unexpected and so natural.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM. DAY
dialog: 143 143
text: Cheryl's lips move away from Mark's chest. She kisses him on

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I love you.
text: She whispers back.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: I love you, too.
speaker_heading: MARK

speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: INT. CHERYL'S PLACE. NIGHT
dialog: 144 144
text: Cheryl continues dictating.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
text: Mark is breathing well and learning
dialog: to pace himself. There is no real
dialog: physical impediment to a variety of

dialog: emotional needs are outside the
dialog: scope of my potential involvement.
text: Cheryl pauses, then goes on.
speaker_heading: CHERYL (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What happens when...
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: What happens when what?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: When people become attached to each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: What people?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Just people. What's the chemistry
dialog: of it all? When people are
text: attracted to each other.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Are you attracted to me?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: We're just talking hypothetically.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Hypothetically, they write poems,
dialog: they have sex.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: And what happens next?
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: After poetry and sex? Nothing or
dialog: everything. The rest is by
dialog: negotiation, as it were.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: I mean, you can just leave it at
dialog: love and attraction, or you can
dialog: make things complicated. As most
dialog: people do.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Have you?
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Oh, yes.

speaker_heading: LATER

speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: What shall we do next time? Any
dialog: requests?
text: Mark doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: CHERYL (CONT'D)
dialog: Mark?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'm thinking.
text: She finishes buttoning him up in silence. A strange feeling,
text: a kind of chill that Cheryl senses, pervades the atmosphere.
speaker_heading: MARK (CONT'D)
dialog: We have two sessions left, is that
dialog: correct?
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: That's right. Or...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Or, what?
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Or, we could stop now.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You mean, make this the last

speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Yes.

text: There is a pregnant pause.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What do you think we should do?
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: It's not we, it's you, Mark. It's
dialog: up to you.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I want to know how you feel.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: That doesn't come in to it.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes, it does. I don't just write
dialog: poems to anyone.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Mark, what do you want me to say?
dialog: How much I was touched by that? How
dialog: special this has been to me? Is
dialog: that going to help you? No, it's
dialog: going to make things worse.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You mean to say, come the sixth
dialog: session that will be it?
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Yes, that will be it. I explained
dialog: that the first time we met.
text: Mark has a serious and painful moment.
speaker_heading: CHERYL (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry. If it's any consolation,
dialog: it's also hard for me to think
dialog: about it.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Then maybe we should pull the plug
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: I think maybe we should. It's only
dialog: going to get harder. I guess you
dialog: might as well save the money. Maybe
dialog: buy yourself a nice futon.
text: A LITTLE LATER.
dialog: 80.
text: Cheryl is getting dressed. Mark watches pensively. She pauses
text: and looks at him. He keeps a brave face. There is a knock on
text: the door.
speaker_heading: CHERYL (CONT'D)
text: Just a moment.
text: She and Mark make eye contact for the last time. They manage
text: to smile at each other.
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: I desperately wanted to feel that
dialog: because of Cheryl, my life had
dialog: changed. But it hadn't.
text: Apart from her usual things, she is also carrying a long
dialog: mirror.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Bye, Mark
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: Bye.
text: As Cheryl goes out, Vera comes in.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: Everything all right?
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: He did great. See you. I'm sorry,
dialog: I have to run.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: See you.

scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL ROOM. DAY
speaker_heading: 150 150
text: Cheryl goes to her car and opens the trunk. As she is putting
text: the mirror inside, the Chinese clerk, who is showing a COUPLE
text: to their room, gives her an odd look. Cheryl takes no notice,
text: gets in her car and starts the engine.
text: Just then, Vera runs up and taps on her window. The window
text: winds down. Vera hands Cheryl an envelope with money in it.
text: At first, Cheryl just looks at it, then realizes what it is.
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: You forgot this.
text: Cheryl smiles.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: I knew there was a reason I came

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I felt I'd just been through a
dialog: ceremony that I didn't know the
dialog: meaning of. I kept thinking, is
dialog: that all there is? Just an empty
dialog: hole at the end of it? A bigger
dialog: hole than there was before?
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: I'm sorry Mark, you can't always
dialog: trust your feelings. You've
dialog: achieved a great thing. It may take
dialog: you a while to realize that.
text: Time passes.
scene_heading: INT. MARK'S PLACE. NIGHT
dialog: 153 153
text: It is a moonlit night. On the opposite wall from the Virgin
text: Mary is a picture of Amanda and Mark. Mark lies in his iron
text: lung staring at it.
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: I wrote letters to Amanda in
dialog: Germany.
dialog: Five, six pages long
dialog: A year passed,
dialog: Heard nothing.
dialog: Was it my fault?
dialog: Of course it was.
dialog: But the guilt isn't enough to patch
text: over the rage.
text: I pound the insides of my mind with
dialog: words, such puny fists,
dialog: And nobody hears.
dialog: 82.
text: The poem ends and we hear instead a RADIO BROADCAST of a
text: Giants' game. Mark is engrossed. Suddenly the broadcast
text: stops. The digital read-out on the clock radio, which says
text: 12:57, disappears. A street light, visible through the
text: window, goes out. The electric pump under Mark's iron lung
text: whirrs to a halt. We hear the sound of air escaping, then an
text: eerie silence. Even the cat is motionless.
text: For a few moments, Mark seems hypnotized. Then, he twists his
text: head and clamps onto his mouth stick. He manoeuvres it over
text: to the speaker button on the phone and manages to press it in
text: the semi-darkness. We hear a dial tone.
scene_heading: INT. ROD'S BEDROOM. NIGHT

speaker_heading: ROD'S VOICE
dialog: Hi, this is Rod. Leave a message,

speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: Rod, it's Mark. I need help. The
dialog: power's gone out, including the
dialog: pump on the iron lung. I'd say I've
dialog: got about three hours before I
dialog: start to turn blue. I hope you get
dialog: this in time.
scene_heading: INT. MARK'S PLACE. NIGHT
dialog: 155 155
text: Mark winces in frustration.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Okay... nine-one-one.
text: He swings the mouth stick over to the 9 button. As he presses
text: it, he loses his grip and the mouth stick falls to the floor.
speaker_heading: MARK (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit!
text: At first, he seems panicky, but after a few moments he begins
text: to control his breathing and gradually psyches himself into a
text: strange calm.
speaker_heading: MARK (CONT'D)
dialog: So this is how it ends.
text: Time passes. We see Mark from a high angle. More time passes.
text: We see Mark's face as he slips into unconsciousness.

scene_heading: INT. MIKVAH (JEWISH RITUAL BATH-HOUSE). DAY
dialog: 156 156
text: Cheryl enters the room wrapped in a white, terry cloth robe.
text: The room is dominated by a small, beautifully tiled immersion
text: pool with a hand rail and steps. The MIKVAH LADY gets up from
text: her chair and approaches her.
speaker_heading: MIKVAH LADY
dialog: Is this your first time?
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Yes, it is. I'm converting.
text: She takes off her robe and hands it to the Mikvah Lady, who
text: does not fail to notice Cheryl's body.
speaker_heading: MIKVAH LADY
dialog: So, what do you do?
text: Cheryl closes her eyes and thinks for a moment.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: I don't think you'd understand.
speaker_heading: MIKVAH LADY
dialog: You can try me.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Okay. I'm a housewife.
speaker_heading: MIKVAH LADY
dialog: Why shouldn't I understand?
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: I guess I was mistaken.
text: Cheryl steps towards the pool.
speaker_heading: MIKVAH LADY
dialog: I see you're very comfortable with
text: being naked.
text: She takes hold of the rail and puts her foot in the water.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: That has never been one of my
dialog: problems.
speaker_heading: MIKVAH LADY
dialog: Sometimes new brides come with
dialog: their mothers. Do I have to take
dialog: this off? Can I please leave this
dialog: on? They've never been naked
dialog: before. No honey, it all has to
dialog: come off.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: And it does?
text: Cheryl takes another step into the water.
speaker_heading: MIKVAH LADY
text: And it does. They stand on the edge
dialog: of that pool without anything to
dialog: cling to but themselves. Nothing to
dialog: hide behind. This is your body.
dialog: This is the body that God crafted
dialog: for you.
text: Cheryl immerses herself up to her chest.
speaker_heading: MIKVAH LADY (CONT'D)
dialog: Immerse completely. Go completely
text: under the water, without touching
dialog: the walls or anything.
text: She immerses completely. We see her under the water. She
text: hears a voice in the distance, her own voice. At the same
text: time, there is a look of elation in her eyes.
speaker_heading: CHERYL (V.O.)
dialog: Okay Mark, you can open your eyes
dialog: now.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM. DAY
dialog: 157 157
text: Mark is on the bed alone. He opens his eyes.
speaker_heading: CHERYL (V.O.)
dialog: This is your body.
text: A few feet in front of Mark, Cheryl is holding a full-length
text: mirror. The angle is such that he can see all of himself. He
text: is mesmerized by his own image. Flashes of light from the
text: mirror flicker over his face.
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: So this is the body that someone
dialog: was able to love. Not quite as bad
dialog: as I thought.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. DAY
dialog: 158 158
text: Overhead fluorescent lights flash by, as we observe the
text: ceiling from Mark's point of view. We also hear the sound of

speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Mark, can you hear me? Open your
dialog: eyes.
dialog: 85.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL. DAY
dialog: 159 159
text: Mark is in a regular hospital bed, with a temporary plastic
text: cocoon over him in place of his iron lung. There is a
text: volunteer called SUSAN in the room with him.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: They'll be letting you go today.
dialog: Whoever looks after you will leave
text: the portable respirator switched on
dialog: at night, fully charged, so you'll
dialog: have at least one back-up system.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: How close was I?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: To what?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You know, to that tunnel thing and
text: the light, and the voice saying
dialog: don't go near the light.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Is that what you remember?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No. I assume I passed out. Before
dialog: that, I remember feeling sorry for
dialog: myself.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Do you feel relieved now?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No. I mean, I'm relieved that Rod
dialog: got to me in time, but I still feel
dialog: sorry for myself.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I'm sure there's a cure for that.
dialog: Would you like to talk to someone?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I feel comfortable talking to you.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I'm only a volunteer, not a
dialog: therapist. I can refer you to
dialog: someone if you like.
text: Mark breaks into a broad smile, then a chuckle.
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude.
dialog: I'm just smiling at the idea that a
dialog: therapist could do anything useful
dialog: for me right now. My priest
dialog: couldn't.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Are you religious?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes. I would find it absolutely
dialog: intolerable not to be able to blame
dialog: someone for all this. Are you?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: No, I don't go to any church and I
dialog: don't think about God very much.
dialog: But I believe there's a mysterious
dialog: logic, or poetry to life. I guess
dialog: that makes me a spiritual type.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes, that would count.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Would you like me to visit you?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Are you married?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Do you have a steady boyfriend?

dialog: to tell you.
dialog: 87.
text: She gets into the ambulance and squats down next to him.
speaker_heading: MARK (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm not a virgin.
text: She looks genuinely pleased to hear it.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: So, are you in a relationship at
dialog: the moment?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No, it was a passing thing.

scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL. DAY
dialog: 162 162
text: We see the disappearing figure of Susan from the point of

speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: I met Susan five years before I
dialog: died. She was the love of my life.
dialog: We had the same priorities,
dialog: baseball pretty much came first,
dialog: and we wrote each other mushy
dialog: poems. I never expected it, nor did
dialog: she, but that's often the way

speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: That was quite something. What do
dialog: you propose to do for an encore?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yep, I almost found out the big
dialog: secret. But here I am, back with
dialog: the living. If there is another
dialog: place, then I think they took one
dialog: look at me and decided to throw me
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: And welcome back.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: And thank you for coming to visit.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: I know it's been awhile since we
dialog: talked about this... About Cheryl.
dialog: At the time, you seemed to feel so
dialog: badly about her... or about it?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I no longer feel like that.
text: Father Brendan is rather taken by surprise.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: Oh? That's good to hear. In the
dialog: end, you're glad that you did it?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes, I am. In fact, at this point
dialog: in time, I feel very blessed.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: Blessed?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes, blessed. They put me on this
dialog: new anti-depressant and now I can
dialog: really see life from the cup half
text: full rather than cup half empty
text: point of view.
text: Father Brendan looks truly amazed.
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: MARK (CONT'D)
dialog: It takes about six weeks to kick
dialog: in, but when it does, you can
dialog: really tell the difference.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: Hey, that's great.
text: Mark grins.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'm pulling your leg, Father. I'm
dialog: not on drugs. I have a girlfriend.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: You're kidding me. A real
dialog: girlfriend?
speaker_heading: MARK
text: A very real girlfriend. She adores
dialog: me. She'll do anything for me. And
dialog: I can get pretty kinky sometimes,
dialog: believe you me. Her name is Susan.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: I'm flabbergasted. Is she pretty?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: She sure is.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: Has she got a sister?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: As a matter of fact...
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: I'm kidding.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No, you're not. Anyway, we're
dialog: starting a publishing company
dialog: together.
text: Father Brendan smiles and shakes his head.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: Here I was, all prepared to offer
dialog: comfort to the forlorn - that's
dialog: supposed to be my specialty - and
dialog: now I can just throw away that
dialog: little speech.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No, no. Please make the little
dialog: speech. I'd love to hear it.
dialog: 89A.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: Okay, but I'll try and keep it
dialog: short.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Don't make it too short.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: Okay, fine. Here goes. The meaning
dialog: of love. Love is a journey.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I already like it.
text: There is a pause.
speaker_heading: FATHER BRENDAN
dialog: That's it. That's all of I've got.

dialog: were helping a bit. At least I was
text: able to see the cup-of-life
dialog: metaphor as a useful tool. Of
dialog: course, the two halves were never
dialog: even. Not in my case, that's for
dialog: sure. Look at all the years of
dialog: unendurable crap I've had to put up
text: with. That fills most of the cup.
dialog: But in the little bit that's left,
dialog: what do I have to show for myself?
dialog: Journalism? Poetry? At the very
dialog: least, three beautiful women who
dialog: all loved me and will all show up
dialog: at my funeral.

text: Josh saunters out to the mail box. He retrieves the mail,
text: sifts through it and pauses over a letter. He is tempted to
text: open it, but thinks better of it.

dialog: 167 167
text: Cheryl is planting stuff in the back yard. Josh approaches
text: her with the letter.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: It's from a Susan Fernbach.

scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH. DAY
dialog: 168 168
text: A full-blown Catholic funeral is happening. Meaningful hugs
text: are exchanged. Eyes are dabbed. We hear Mark's voice.
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: Three Reasons to Live
dialog: The mundane:
dialog: O God, it was boring, but I did it
dialog: got it out of the way
dialog: The transcendent:
dialog: We had this agreement --
dialog: God gave me life for a while
dialog: I gave Him gratitude for a while
dialog: and it worked out OK
dialog: The curious:
dialog: You know how every day is
dialog: different?
dialog: I just wanted to see

dialog: Mark, I know you're watching. I'm
dialog: sorry, my friend, but we have to do
dialog: this. Just bear with me, and I
dialog: think you might like it.
scene_heading: FATHER BRENDAN (TO THE CONGREGATION)
speaker_heading: (CONT'D)
dialog: I've been branching out lately,
dialog: reading Native American stories
dialog: about the character of the
text: trickster. Sometimes he shows up
dialog: as a coyote, sometimes as a raven,
dialog: but he always does the unexpected.
text: The trickster breaks the rules.
dialog: Mark O'Brien, whose life we're
dialog: celebrating today, was very much
dialog: the trickster -- anyone who knew
dialog: him knew that.

dialog: 90B.
scene_heading: FATHER BRENDAN (TO THE CONGREGATION)
dialog: Besides his irreverent humor and
dialog: alarming honesty, he always did the
dialog: unexpected.
dialog: In nearly every aspect of his life,
dialog: Mark did the unexpected. His was a
text: dynamic voice in a paralyzed body,
dialog: a full life lived long after he
dialog: should have been dead. He
dialog: graduated from college, wrote and
dialog: published articles and poems, and --
dialog: against all odds, by his own
dialog: admission -- entered into the fully
dialog: human experience of physical love.
dialog: In this way, Mark lived from day to
dialog: day to day, from breath to breath
dialog: to breath, for 49 years. He loved,
dialog: and he was loved and in his quiet
text: voice, he spoke loud truths.
dialog: 91.
text: We see Rod, Vera and Laura the therapist in various rows.
text: Also Amanda, holding a toddler in her arms and sitting next
text: to a tall, boring-looking HUSBAND.

speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Let me touch you with my words.
dialog: For my hands lie limp as empty
dialog: gloves.
dialog: Let my words stroke your hair,
dialog: Slide down your back and tickle
dialog: your belly.
dialog: For my hands, light and free-flying
dialog: as bricks,
dialog: Ignore my wishes and stubbornly
dialog: refuse to carry out my quietest
dialog: desires.
text: We see Cheryl, as deeply touched by the words as she was the
dialog: first time.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Let my words enter your mind,
text: bearing torches.
dialog: Admit them willingly into your
dialog: being
dialog: So they may caress you gently
dialog: within.

text: In the middle of the room, moonlit, is Mark's iron lung,
