dialog: HIM ...
text: BLACK SCREEN:
text: SCREAMING. The Protagonist’s screaming. Close on his eyes -
text: FLICKERING, SWEATING, PLEADING, DEFIANT... and we are -
scene_heading: EXT. RAIL YARDS - DAY
text: The Protagonist, tied to a chair, in a windswept rail yard.
text: In front of him, the ‘Target’, also tied to a chair, back to
text: us. The Driver steps back, SWEATING. BLOODY PLIERS in hand.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: (breathless)
dialog: A man can be trained to hold out
dialog: for about eighteen hours.
text: The Driver gestures at a CLOCK on a table -
speaker_heading: DRIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: So your colleagues will clear by 7.
text: The Driver PUSHES the ‘Target’s chair over. The ‘Target’
text: lands hard on his side on the gravel. Groaning.
speaker_heading: DRIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: He didn’t last eighteen minutes.
text: The Driver pulls out a KNIFE. Leans in to the Protagonist -
speaker_heading: DRIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: But he didn’t have anything to
dialog: hide. You were smuggling a nobody.
text: The knife moves towards the Protagonist’s throat...
speaker_heading: DRIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Risky.
text: ...then to his collar - which he CUTS -
speaker_heading: DRIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Or were you counting on this?
text: ..-pulling out a SILVER CAPSULE. The Protagonist stares.
speaker_heading: DRIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Death, CIA issue.
text: The Driver TOSSES the pill, WAVES the pliers at the clock -
speaker_heading: DRIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Spare yourself once they’re clear.
text: The Protagonist looks at the clock - ‘5:38’. A FREIGHT TRAIN
text: RUMBLES PAST, CLOSE... As we close in on the clock, THE
text: PROTAGONIST’S SCREAMS ARE DROWNED OUT BY THE FREIGHT TRAIN...
text: The Driver steps back. The Protagonist breathes heavy, blood
text: dribbling... the Driver follows his gaze to the clock -
text: 6:53’ - then checks his watch. Frowns theatrically, picks up
text: the clock, SHAKES it -
speaker_heading: DRIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Running fast...
text: The Driver SETS THE HANDS BACK ONE HOUR. The Protagonist
text: watches, DESPAIRING... as the Driver puts the clock back
text: the table, the Protagonist notices the ‘Target’s FINGERS
text: WIGGLING... in them is a SILVER PILL...
text: Freight trains rumble past in opposite directions, sound
text: BUILDING... The Driver approaches, bloody pliers in hand
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: We were alone.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: I didn’t ask. Which means we're
dialog: finally getting somewhere.
text: The Protagonist HURLS himself onto the ‘Target’s hands -
text: SMASHING - gets the PILL into his mouth - BITES DOWN -
text: DEAFENING TRAIN NOISE...

text: The Protagonist opens his eyes. A man stands beside his bed.
text: SWAYING gently. This is FAY.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Welcome to the afterlife.
text: The Protagonist lifts his head and we are -
scene_heading: INT. BOAT AT SEA - DAY
text: The Protagonist sees the STEELY OCEAN SWELL...
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: You've been in a medically induced
dialog: coma while we got you out of
dialog: Ukraine and rebuilt your mouth.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: The pills are fake?
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: We swapped yours for a sedative.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: A test.
text: The Protagonist runs a finger around his mouth. REALIZING.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Test? They pulled my teeth out.
text: Fay lets that dissipate. The Protagonist closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
dialog: Did the team get clear?
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: No. Private Russians, we think.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Somebody talked.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Not you. You chose to die instead
dialog: of giving up your colleagues.
scene_heading: EXT. DECK OF THE BOAT - LATER
text: The Protagonist stands in the wind, contemplating the
text: horizon.
speaker_heading: FAY (0.S.)
dialog: We all believe we’d run into the
dialog: burning building, but until we feel
dialog: that heat... we can never know. You
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: I resign.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: You don’t work for us - you’re
dialog: dead.
text: The Protagonist turns to Fay, confused.
speaker_heading: FAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Your duty transcends national
dialog: interests. This is about survival.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Whose?
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Everyone's. There’s a cold war.
dialog: Cold as ice. To even know its true
dialog: nature is to lose.
dialog: (MORE)
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: FAY (CONT'D)
dialog: This is knowledge divided - all I
dialog: have for you is a gesture -—
dialog: (interlaces his fingers)
dialog: - in combination with a word -
dialog: ‘tenet’. Use it carefully, it’ll
text: open the right doors, but some of
dialog: the wrong ones, too.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: That’s all they’ve told you?
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: The test you passed?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Not everybody does.
text: Fay breaks eye contact with the Protagonist. The boat
text: continues to nose into the swell.
scene_heading: EXT. LAUNCH, WIND FARM AT SEA - DUSK
text: The Protagonist is driven away from the boat on a launch,
text: towards the GIANT WHITE TURBINES of the ocean wind farm.
text: The launch SLIPS amongst them, seeking the ladder of a
dialog: particular one...
text: The Protagonist climbs the ladder to a door. He tries it -
text: it’s open. He turns to see the launch move off into the
text: gathering dark. The Protagonist ENTERS the wind turbine.
scene_heading: INT. WIND TURBINE - CONTINUOUS
text: In the bare space, the Protagonist finds a SPORTS BAG, a COT,
text: a pallet of WATER and PROTEIN BARS. He opens the sports bag
text: to find passports, cash, credit cards and a HI-VIZ VEST.
text: Under the vest is a small black cylinder. He unscrews the top
text: to find three SILVER SUICIDE PILLS. The Protagonist shakes
text: his head as he tosses them back into the bag.
scene_heading: INT. WIND TURBINE - LATER
text: The Protagonist EATS, DRINKS and EXERCISES by CLIMBING the
text: endless interior ladder of the turbine. The stash of food and
text: water SHRINKS...
text: The Protagonist does PULL-UPS at the very top of the ladder,
text: FEET DANGLING over the VERTIGINOUS DROP...
scene_heading: INT. WIND TURBINE - MORNING
text: The Protagonist is woken by a repeated AIR HORN. He pulls
text: himself off the cot, opens the door to find -
dialog: 11.
scene_heading: EXT. WIND TURBINE - CONTINUOUS
text: A large CATAMARAN nosed up to the windmill, ladder in place,
text: MAINTENANCE CREW in HI-VIZ VESTS moving on and off the
dialog: turbine. Other boats service other turbines. The Protagonist
text: pulls on his VEST and CLIMBS down onto the catamaran.
scene_heading: EXT. EUROPEAN PORT - DAY
text: The Protagonist disembarks with the rest of the wind-farm
text: crew. As they file past a car the driver, also in hi-viz,
text: steps out into line, leaving the door open, engine running.
text: The Protagonist gets in. The GPS is already set...
scene_heading: EXT. OFFICE COMPLEX - LATER
text: A bland suburban office park. The Protagonist gets out of the
text: car, wearing his hi-viz and carrying a clipboard. Heads
text: inside, passing numerous STAFF coming out...
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY, OFFICE COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS
text: The Protagonist moves through the lobby unimpeded. Checking
text: the tenant listings he sees - ‘WINDFARM TRANSITIONS - B-2’.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
text: The Protagonist walks up to B-2.
speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE (0.S.)
text: With a hi-viz vest and a clipboard,
dialog: you can get almost anywhere.
dialog: Almost.
text: The Protagonist turns to find a brusque young woman. This is
text: BARBARA. He joins his hands, interlacing the fingers...
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: A pretty obscure tenet.
text: Using a key card, she ushers him through a door into -
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE, LABORATORY - CONTINUOUS
text: Barbara hands the Protagonist a cup of tea.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: No small talk, nothing that might
dialog: reveal who we are, or what we do.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: I thought I was here to find out
dialog: what we do.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: You’re not here for ‘what’, you’re
dialog: here for ‘how’. ‘What’ is your
dialog: department. And not my business.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Well, to do what I do, I need some
dialog: idea of the threat we face.
text: Barbara considers the Protagonist. Sips her tea.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: As I understand it, we’re trying to
dialog: prevent World War Three.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Nuclear holocaust?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: No. Something worse.
scene_heading: INT. SHOOTING RANGE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Barbara hands the Protagonist a semi-automatic. He
text: reflexively checks the chamber and magazine - EMPTY.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
text: Aim it and pull the trigger.
text: The Protagonist SHRUGS, lifts the empty pistol, sights a
text: target 25m away with several holes in it...
text: He squeezes the trigger - BAM! - a shot. He is CONFUSED...
speaker_heading: BARBARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Check the magazine.
text: The Protagonist checks the clip - THERE IS A ROUND IN IT.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: How?
text: Barbara pulls on PROTECTIVE GLOVES and removes the round from
text: the clip, placing it next to an identical one on a table.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: One of these bullets is, like us,
dialog: travelling forwards through time.
text: The other one’s going backwards.
dialog: Can you tell which is which?
text: The Protagonist shakes his head. Barbara reaches forward -
speaker_heading: BARBARA (CONT'D)
dialog: How about now? -
dialog: 13.
text: One of the rounds FLIES UP INTO HER HAND, FALLING IN REVERSE.
text: The Protagonist is taken aback. Barbara holds the round
text: towards him so he can inspect it -
speaker_heading: BARBARA (CONT'D)
dialog: It's inverted - its entropy runs
dialog: backwards. So, to our eyes, its
dialog: movement is reversed. We think it’s
dialog: a type of inverse radiation,
dialog: triggered by nuclear fission.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: You didn’t make it?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: We don’t know how. Yet.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: So where’d it come from?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Someone’s manufacturing them in the
dialog: future. They’re streaming back at
dialog: us.
text: Barbara places the round on the table, in front of a CAMERA.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Try it.
text: He puts on a glove - moves his hand over it, nothing.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (CONT'D)
dialog: You have to have dropped it.
text: The Protagonist reaches out again - it LEAPS UP INTO HIS
speaker_heading: HAND.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: How can it move before I touch it?
text: She cues up the recording of what he just did -
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: From your point of view you caught
dialog: it, but from the bullet’s point of
text: view...
text: She plays it BACKWARDS -—
speaker_heading: BARBARA (CONT'D)
dialog: ..-you dropped it.
text: ON THE SCREEN: the round FALLS from his hand.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: But cause has to come before
dialog: effect.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: No. That’s just how we see time.
text: She PULLS the round towards herself using one finger - the
text: round follows her finger as if MAGNETIZED...
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: What about free will?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: That bullet wouldn't have moved if
dialog: you hadn’t put your hand there.
dialog: Either way we run the tape, you
dialog: made it happen.
text: She LAUNCHES it up into her other hand -
speaker_heading: BARBARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t try to understand it. Feel
dialog: it.
text: Barbara PLAYS with the round in increasingly IMPROBABLE,
text: BEAUTIFUL MOVEMENTS... The round SHOOTS AWAY FROM HER - the
text: Protagonist CATCHES IT...
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Instinct. Got it.
text: Barbara smiles, swaps him the round for the pistol. She then
text: places a TRAY COVERED IN SHELL CASINGS beside him.
text: The Protagonist aims at the target - a shell casing LEAPS
text: into the gun - he FIRES, and a bullet hole near the bullseye
dialog: VANISHES —-
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
dialog: Why does it feel so strange?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: You’re not shooting the bullet,
dialog: you’re catching it.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Whoa.
text: The Protagonist examines the target - no bullet holes.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
dialog: I’ve seen this type of ammunition
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: In the field?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: I was almost hit.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Then you are exceedingly lucky...
text: The Protagonist turns to her...
speaker_heading: BARBARA (CONT'D)
text: An inverted bullet passing through
dialog: your body would be devastating. The
dialog: inverse radiation would spread
dialog: through your body. Like polonium
dialog: poisoning. Not pretty.
text: The Protagonist examines the rounds...
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: These look like today’s.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: They may have been made today, then
dialog: inverted years from now.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Where did you get them?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: They came with the wall. I was
dialog: assigned it, like all the material
dialog: I’m studying here.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Do you have an analysis of the
dialog: metals?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Sure. Why?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: The mixture of alloys can tell me
dialog: where they might have been made.
dialog: Look, I know you said that ‘what’
dialog: is my business -
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Let’s not go off-topic.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: I’m not seeing Armageddon here.
text: Barbara takes the round from him, and beckons him to follow -
scene_heading: INT. ARCHIVE - CONTINUOUS
text: Between tall sets of DRAWERS...
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: A bullet may not seem like much,
dialog: but it’s a simple machine - lead
dialog: bullet, brass casing, gunpowder. If
dialog: they can invert this - I see no
dialog: reason they couldn’t invert pretty
dialog: much anything. Even a nuclear
dialog: weapon can only affect our future.
dialog: An inverted weapon might be able to
dialog: affect our past as well.
text: Barbara stops at a drawer. Gestures around herself -
speaker_heading: BARBARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Now that we know what to look for,
dialog: we're finding more and more
dialog: inverted material...
text: She opens a drawer, revealing a VARIETY OF RUSTED BITS AND
text: PIECES - SCREWS, CRACKED LENSES, METAL RODS, BUTTONS...
speaker_heading: BARBARA (CONT'D)
text: ...remnants of complex objects.
text: The Protagonist reaches out and lets a RUSTED BUCKLE leap
text: into his hand.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: So what do you think we’re seeing?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: The detritus of a coming war.
text: The Protagonist looks around at the MULTITUDE of DRAWERS.
scene_heading: EXT. CROWDED STREET, MUMBAI - DAY
text: The Protagonist walks out of an electronics store, opening a
text: new phone, and slips into the throng. He dials -
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE
dialog: (over phone)
dialog: Yup?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: We live in a twilight world.
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE
dialog: (over phone)
dialog: No friends at dusk. I was told

speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST

speaker_heading: MALE VOICE

dialog: Specifically?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: An assist in Mumbai. To get to

speaker_heading: MALE VOICE
dialog: (over phone)
dialog: Singh? He never leaves his house,
dialog: and his house... well, it’s -
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Yes, it is - I’m looking right at
dialog: it.
text: Above the bustling street, a HIGH-RISE HOUSE, at least twenty

text: Neil offers his hand. The Protagonist takes it -
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: I need an audience with Sanjay

speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Not possible.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Ten minutes, tops.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Time isn’t the problem. Getting out

dialog: (thinks)
dialog: Would you take a child hostage?
text: The Protagonist shakes his head.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: NEIL (CONT'D)
dialog: A woman?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: If I had to. I’m not looking to
dialog: make much noise here.
text: Neil keeps thinking. Signals a waiter -
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Vodka tonic.
dialog: (gestures at the
dialog: Protagonist)
dialog: Diet Coke.
text: The Protagonist stares at Neil. Neil looks up, confused.
speaker_heading: NEIL (CONT'D)
dialog: What? You never drink on the job.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: You're well informed.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: It pays to be in our profession.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Well, I prefer club soda.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: (grins)
dialog: No, you don’t.
text: Neil raps his knuckles on the table, thinking.
speaker_heading: NEIL (CONT'D)
dialog: How’s your parachuting?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Broke an ankle in basic training.
text: Singh’s house isn’t tall enough to
dialog: parachute off of.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: (thinks )
text: But it’s bungee-jumpable.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: I don’t think ‘bungee-jumpable’ is
dialog: a word.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: It may not be a word, but it may be
dialog: your only way out of that place.
dialog: (a thought occurs)
dialog: Or into it, for that matter.

speaker_heading: SANJAY
dialog: Why would I know who supplied it?

speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: The combination of metals is unique
dialog: to India. If it’s from India, it’s
dialog: from you.
speaker_heading: SANJAY
dialog: A fair assumption -
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Deduction.
speaker_heading: SANJAY
dialog: Deduction, then. Look, my friend,
dialog: guns are never conducive to a
dialog: productive negotiation.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: I’m not the man they send to
dialog: negotiate...
text: He COCKS his weapon - puts the gun to Sanjay’s head -
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
dialog: But I am the man people talk to.
speaker_heading: SANJAY
dialog: (charm curdles)
dialog: I can’t. I can’t tell you.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: You're an arms dealer, friend -
dialog: this may be the easiest trigger
dialog: I’ve ever had to pull.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (0.S.)

speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: This is your operation?
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: A masculine front in a man’s world
dialog: has its uses. The dealer you're
dialog: looking for is Andrei Sator.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: The Russian oligarch?
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: You know him?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Not personally. Made his billions
dialog: in gas, moved to London and married
dialog: an English girl. Said to be on the
dialog: outs with Moscow.
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: Very good. Except the ‘gas’ he made
dialog: his billions from was actually
dialog: plutonium, and he’s said to be on
dialog: the outs so he can feed British
dialog: Intelligence whatever the Russians
dialog: want them to think they know.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: None of which explains how or why
dialog: you sold him inverted munitions.
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: When I sold him the rounds, they
dialog: were perfectly ordinary.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: So how did he get them inverted?
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: We believe he’s functioning as some
dialog: kind of broker between our time and
dialog: the future.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: He can communicate with the future?
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: We all do. Credit cards, email,
dialog: text - anything that goes into the
dialog: record speaks directly to the
dialog: future. The question is - can the
dialog: future speak back? And, if so, what
dialog: are they saying?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: And I’m supposed to find out?
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: To get anywhere near Sator would
dialog: take a fresh-faced protagonist...
text: She reaches up to touch his cheek.
speaker_heading: PRIYA (CONT'D)
dialog: Fresh as a daisy. Get close, find
dialog: out what he’s receiving and how.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Is it safe to involve British
dialog: Intelligence?
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: I have a contact who’s out of
text: Sator’s reach.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: One of us?
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: No, he thinks we’re chasing
dialog: plutonium.
text: SIRENS. BANGS! Priya looks over to see POLICE CARS arriving
text: far below, in the WALLED YARD at the foot of her house...
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: PRIYA (CONT'D)
dialog: You'd better get out of here.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Can’t you explain things?
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: You have to start looking at the
dialog: world in a new way - this conflict
dialog: runs backwards and forwards
dialog: simultaneously. Your name on a
dialog: police report reveals your identity
dialog: to the future - they pass it back
dialog: to Sator -—
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
text: My cover’s blown before I get near
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: You got in - you must've had a plan
dialog: for getting out.
text: The Protagonist pulls a CLIP and cord from his harness -
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Not one I loved.
text: Priya watches him clip onto the balcony rail. Neil FLIES
text: PAST, dropping from the balcony above.
text: The Protagonist JUMPS, SLOWING as he DROPS BEHIND THE WALL,
text: OUT OF REACH OF THE POLICE, into a MARKET STREET and RELEASES

scene_heading: EXT. MEMBER'S CLUB, LONDON - DAY

scene_heading: INT. MEMBER'S CLUB, LONDON - DAY
text: The Protagonist enters, is approached by a STEWARD.
speaker_heading: STEWARD
dialog: Can I help you, sir?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: I’m Mr Crosby’s lunch.
speaker_heading: STEWARD
dialog: I presume you mean Sir Michael
dialog: Crosby’s lunch?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Presume away.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: STEWARD
dialog: If you'll follow me.
scene_heading: INT. LOUNGE, MEMBER'S CLUB - CONTINUOUS
text: The Protagonist is shown to a table where a distinguished
text: middle-aged man is already eating. CROSBY.
speaker_heading: CROSBY
dialog: Started without you, hope you don’t
dialog: mind.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: I’1l catch up.
dialog: (to the Steward)
dialog: Same for me.
speaker_heading: STEWARD
dialog: I‘'ll send the waiter.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: No, just pass on the order.
text: Crosby smiles at the Protagonist’s handling of the Steward.
speaker_heading: CROSBY
dialog: I gather you’ve an interest ina
dialog: certain Russian national.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Anglo-Russian. So I’1ll have to
dialog: watch my step.
speaker_heading: CROSBY
dialog: Indeed. He’s tapped into the
dialog: intelligence services - I’ve warned
dialog: them he’s feeding them rubbish, but
dialog: they don’t seem to care.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Tell me about him.
speaker_heading: CROSBY
dialog: I assume you’re familiar with the
dialog: Soviet-era secret cities?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Closed cities, not shown on maps,
dialog: built up around sensitive
dialog: industries. Most of them have been
dialog: opened up and renamed as regular
dialog: towns.
speaker_heading: CROSBY
dialog: Not the one Sator grew up in.
dialog: Stalsk-12.
dialog: (MORE)
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: CROSBY (CONT'D)
dialog: In the seventies our people
dialog: estimated its population at almost
dialog: 200,000. Unacknowledged to this
dialog: day. Thought to be abandoned.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Abandoned?
speaker_heading: CROSBY
dialog: Some kind of accident. After which
dialog: we think it became a site for
dialog: underground tests. Just two weeks
dialog: ago, same day as the Kiev Opera
dialog: siege, our satellites detected a
dialog: detonation in north-west Siberia,
dialog: about where we think Stalsk-12 was.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Nuclear?
speaker_heading: CROSBY
dialog: Big enough to be noticed. Sator
dialog: emerged from this blank spot on the
dialog: map with an ambition that
dialog: eventually led him here, to buy his
dialog: way into the British establishment.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Through his wife?
speaker_heading: CROSBY
dialog: Katherine Barton, eldest niece of
dialog: Sir Frederick Barton. She works at
dialog: Shipley’s, met Sator at an auction.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: He’s into art?
speaker_heading: CROSBY
dialog: Like a lot of wealthy criminals, he
dialog: thinks if he covers his walls with
dialog: tasteful, expensive things it’ll
text: distract from the bloodshed.
dialog: Judging by the lovely girl he
dialog: married, there might be something
dialog: in it.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Happy marriage?
speaker_heading: CROSBY
dialog: No. Practically estranged.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: How do I get to Sator?
speaker_heading: CROSBY
dialog: Through her, of course.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: You may have an inflated idea of my
dialog: powers of seduction.
speaker_heading: CROSBY
dialog: Hardly. We have an ace in the
dialog: hole...
text: Crosby slides a SHOPPING BAG over to the Protagonist’s feet.
text: The Protagonist looks inside: a small FRAMED DRAWING.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: You’re carrying a Goya in a Harrods
dialog: bag?
speaker_heading: CROSBY
dialog: It's a fake, by a Spaniard named
dialog: Arepo. One of two we confiscated
dialog: from an embezzler in Bern. We hung
dialog: on to this one for a rainy day - I
dialog: felt the first drops when India
dialog: called.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: What happened to the other one?
speaker_heading: CROSBY
text: A Rubens. It turned up at
dialog: Shipley’s, where it was
dialog: authenticated by Katherine Barton
dialog: before going under the hammer. And
dialog: who do you suppose bought it?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Her husband? Does she know it’s a
dialog: forgery?
speaker_heading: CROSBY
dialog: Hard to say. Rumour had it that she
dialog: and Arepo were close.
text: Crosby looks the Protagonist over -
speaker_heading: CROSBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, no offence, but this is a
dialog: world where someone claiming to be
dialog: a billionaire gets asked if they’re
dialog: just a dollar billionaire.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: CROSBY
dialog: Brooks Brothers won’t cut it.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: I’m assuming I have a budget.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: CROSBY
dialog: (tosses him a credit
dialog: card)
dialog: Save the world, then we’ll balance
dialog: the books. Can I recommend a
dialog: tailor?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: I‘1l manage. You British don’t have
dialog: a monopoly on snobbery, you know.
speaker_heading: CROSBY
dialog: Not a monopoly. More of a
dialog: controlling interest.
text: The Protagonist rises, taking the credit card and the bag.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Thanks for this. By the way, is she
dialog: a Kate or a Kathy?
speaker_heading: CROSBY
dialog: A Kat, I believe.
text: The waiter arrives, bearing food, supervised by the Steward.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Could you box that for me?
speaker_heading: STEWARD
dialog: Certainly not.
text: The Protagonist smiles at Crosby, who nods goodbye.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Goodbye, Sir Michael.

speaker_heading: REPRESENTATIVE

scene_heading: INT. APPRAISAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: The Protagonist admires the paintings on the walls. The door
text: opens and the Young Woman from the school gates comes in,
text: dressed for business. This is KAT BARTON. She looks bemused,

speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: I’m sorry, I wasn’t notified of any
dialog: appointments, Mr...
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Goya?
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Mr Goya?
text: The Protagonist opens his briefcase...
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: No, I’m told you’re the person to
dialog: see about...
text: Offers the drawing to her...
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
dialog: ..-Goya.
text: She takes it, suddenly interested...
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Wow. It’s extraordinary.
text: She lays the drawing on the table and grabs a loupe -
dialog: She
dialog: The
dialog: She
speaker_heading: Kat
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: What's it worth?
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.
dialog: There’s a lot of work before any
dialog: kind of valuation - provenance,
dialog: microscopic examination, X-rays...
text: is bent over the table, peering through the loupe.
text: Protagonist studies her reaction as he -
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: But what does your heart tell you?
text: steps back. Something about the drawing BOTHERS her...
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: I’m sorry, where did you say you
dialog: acquired this drawing?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Tomas Arepo.
text: rises and turns to face the Protagonist. Cold.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: What I want is complicated.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Do you work for my husband?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: I’ve never met your husband. That’s
dialog: the reason I’m here. Is there
dialog: somewhere we can talk?
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: In London? Not really.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: The Protagonist and Kat sit at a corner table.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: I bought my Goya for cents on the
dialog: dollar from an irate Swiss banker.
dialog: Traced it to Arepo, and realized
dialog: I'd scored a bargain when he told
dialog: me who'd paid top dollar for
dialog: another one of his pictures. Your
dialog: husband.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Where’s the bargain? Your drawing’s
text: an obvious fake.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: My drawing’s a very good fake - you
dialog: know that better than anyone. The
dialog: information’s the bargain.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: The information that I helped
dialog: defraud my own husband?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: He and I are in related businesses,
dialog: but he’s a hard man to meet. If you
dialog: and I were to make an arrangement -
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Arrangement? You mean blackmail.
dialog: Don’t be afraid of the word - my
dialog: husband isn’t. And I’m sorry to
dialog: tell you he got there first.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: He knows? And he’s never done
dialog: anything about it?
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Why would he?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: He paid nine million dollars -
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Which would barely cover the
dialog: holiday he just forced us on.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Where’d you go - Mars?
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Viet Nam. On our yacht. His yacht.
text: Kat looks the Protagonist up and down...
speaker_heading: KAT (CONT'D)
dialog: You’ve got the suit. The shoes, the
dialog: watch. But I think you’re a little
dialog: out of your depth.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: (sharp)
dialog: People who've amassed fortunes like
dialog: your husband’s aren’t generally
dialog: okay with being cheated out of any
dialog: of it.
dialog: 31.
text: Kat sips her wine. Wanting to talk. Knowing she shouldn't.
speaker_heading: KAT
text: The drawing is his hold over me. He
dialog: threatened me with the police,
dialog: prison, the works. He controls me,
dialog: my contact with my son, everything.
dialog: Leaving him would never have been
dialog: easy, now it’s impossible. My life,
dialog: now... You can’t fight. Just beg.
dialog: Or worse. In Viet Nam I tried to
dialog: love him again. If there were still
dialog: love, he might give me my son. We
dialog: sat on that bloody boat and watched
text: the sunsets, imitating an earlier
dialog: time. He seemed happy, so I asked.
dialog: And he made me an offer. To let me
dialog: go if I agreed to never see my son
dialog: again. I expressed myself -
text: INSERT CUT: a CRYSTAL BOWL of RASPBERRIES SMASHES onto the
text: polished wood of a yacht’s deck -
speaker_heading: KAT (CONT'D)
dialog: Then took Max ashore. He called us,
dialog: contrite. But when we came back...
text: INSERT CUT: Kat and Max on a launch - Kat follows Max’s gaze
text: to see a FEMALE FIGURE SLIDE into the water...
speaker_heading: KAT (CONT'D)
dialog: I glimpsed some other woman diving
text: off the boat. And he’d vanished.
dialog: I’ve never felt such envy.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: You don’t seem the jealous type.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Of her. You know how I dream of
dialog: just diving off that boat? Of
dialog: freedom?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: But you share a son.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: And that’s my life.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Did you know the drawing was a
dialog: fake?
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: The authentication took months -
dialog: Arepo and I became close, maybe too
dialog: close. Maybe my judgement was
dialog: clouded. I failed.
dialog: (MORE )
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: KAT (CONT'D)
dialog: But Andrei can’t conceive of
dialog: failure, only betrayal. I didn’t
dialog: betray my husband. In retrospect,
dialog: maybe I missed my chance.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: And he let Arepo walk free?
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: If you’d actually met Arepo, as you
dialog: claimed, you’d understand that he
dialog: no longer walks anywhere.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: We spoke on the phone -
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: He can’t do that, either.
dialog: The Protagonist considers this.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Where’s the drawing?
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Get me the introduction, I'll take
dialog: the drawing out of the equation. No
dialog: picture, no prosecution. No hold
dialog: over you.
text: Kat looks at the Protagonist. Not daring to hope.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
dialog: I might just be your second chance
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: (snaps )
dialog: I don’t need redemption.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: At betrayal.
text: A LARGE, WELL-DRESSED THUG sits down at the table. He takes a

text: vacantly. This is VOLKOV. The Protagonist looks at Kat -
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
dialog: Friend of your husband?
dialog: (she nods)
dialog: You knew this would happen?
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: They won’t kill you. Andrei
dialog: dislikes tangling with local law
dialog: enforcement on that level.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: You must really not have liked the
dialog: look of me.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: (rising)
dialog: The look of you is fine. It’s
dialog: better to get to the nasty part
dialog: before I care one way or the other.
text: He takes her hand, pulls her forward to kiss her cheek.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: There’s a number in your left coat
dialog: pocket. Don’t call from home.
text: A Thug puts a MEATY HAND on the Protagonist’s shoulder.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: You won't be taking my call.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: I might surprise you.
text: She leaves, BREEZING out through the kitchen... at Volkov’s
text: nod, two Thugs escort the Protagonist from his chair, heading

speaker_heading: KAT (V.O.)
dialog: But not yet taxed. We started a

speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Anything?
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Anything legal...
text: Then back to the Protagonist briefing Neil...
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST

speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST

dialog: Back to Kat -
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: We make trips there four or five

speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST

speaker_heading: STAFF MEMBER (CONT'D)
dialog: The structure of the vaults is

speaker_heading: NEIL

speaker_heading: STAFF MEMBER
dialog: If I did, we'd suffocate.
speaker_heading: NEIL

speaker_heading: STAFF MEMBER

speaker_heading: STAFF MEMBER

scene_heading: INT. OSLO AIRPORT - DAY
text: The Protagonist and Neil walk through the terminal.
speaker_heading: NEIL

dialog: easy, once there’s a lockdown.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Why a lockdown?
speaker_heading: NEIL
text: Power switches to fail-safe,
dialog: sealing outer doors, but inner
text: doors revert to factory settings
dialog: and pickable locks. Child’s play,
dialog: really.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Child’s play? They’re inside
dialog: airport security. They have to
dialog: worry about climate control, not
dialog: armed raids.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: So how do we get fire power through

speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST

speaker_heading: NEIL

speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST

speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST

speaker_heading: MAHIR
dialog: We'll pop the slides, chuck ‘em off

speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST

speaker_heading: MAHIR

speaker_heading: MAHIR

speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: And if you get caught?
speaker_heading: MAHIR
dialog: We won’t.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: If you do?
speaker_heading: MAHIR
dialog: Everyone assumes terrorism, but no

dialog: make the news.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: That may depend on the size of your

speaker_heading: MAHIR
dialog: Actually, the gold bars might get

speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Gold bars?
speaker_heading: NEIL

speaker_heading: MAHIR

dialog: Time travel?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST

speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Inversion.
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: We spoke about it -
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: I don’t remember anything about

speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: We're trying to do with inversion
dialog: what we couldn’t do with the atomic

dialog: of us knows, the greater the risk

speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST

speaker_heading: PRIYA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: A machine for inverting.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST

dialog: This was always a suicide mission -
dialog: that’s why they recruited a corpse.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Who did? Who are we working for?
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: Everyone. Survival. You need more,
dialog: consider yourself working for me.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Well, Boss, I need a way to
dialog: succeed.
text: Priya thinks. Looks at the Protagonist. Deciding.
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: What if you have something he
dialog: needs?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Such as?
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: Plutonium 241. Sator tried to lift
dialog: the only loose 241 from under a CIA
dialog: team at the opera siege in Kiev. He
dialog: got the team, but not the 241.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Who did?
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: Ukrainian security services. It’s
dialog: moving through Tallinn in a week.
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Helping an arms dealer steal
dialog: weapons-grade plutonium is
dialog: unacceptable. I’m just gonna take
text: him out.
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: No. Sator has to stay alive until
dialog: we know his part in things.
dialog: Leverage the situation without
dialog: losing control of the 241.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: It’s too dangerous.
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: A terrorist bomb, even one that
dialog: kills millions, is nothing compared
dialog: with what happens if we don’t stop
dialog: Sator.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: From. Doing. What?
text: Priya looks up the road at the cars STREAMING past...
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: We're being attacked. Not by
dialog: terrorists or rogue states...
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Who, then?
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: We're being attacked by the future.
dialog: And we're fighting over time.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Time?
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: Theirs is running out, so they’re
dialog: coming for ours. And Sator is
dialog: helping. You have to find out how.
scene_heading: EXT. TERRACE, AMALFI COAST - DAY
text: The Protagonist leaves the tourists behind, heading down a
text: leafy path to emerge at a terrace overlooking the sea. Kat
text: stands there, alone. The Protagonist falls in beside her.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: I saw the news from Oslo. Do you
dialog: have the drawing?
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: You don’t have to worry about it
dialog: any more.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: You destroyed it?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: I didn’t think you’d want it back.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Does he know?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Not yet, so sit tight.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Sit tight? Why? Every day my son
dialog: spends with that monster, he thinks
dialog: a little less of me.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: It won’t be long. In the meantime,
dialog: introduce me.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: As what?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: I’m a former First Secretary from
dialog: the American Embassy in Riyadh, we
dialog: met at a party last June -
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: We were at a party in Riyadh, but I
dialog: don’t think it was June -
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: June 29th. 7 for 7:30, salmon on
dialog: the printed menu swapped for sea
dialog: bass on the night. Sator left
dialog: early, that’s when we met. Don’t
dialog: offer any of this, it’s there if he
dialog: asks. I came into Shipley’s in
dialog: London, you ran into me here and
dialog: want to show me the yacht.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: He’1l think we’re having an affair.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: And he’1l want to meet me.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Or have you killed.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Let me worry about that.
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Did I look worried?
scene_heading: EXT. DOCK, AMALFI - DAY
text: The Protagonist and Kat look out at an enormous yacht.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Sleeps 70, with crew. Four tenders,
dialog: two helicopters, missile defences -
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Jesus. Worried about pirates?
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Andrei loves playing one government
dialog: off another. The day they turn,
dialog: that’s his refuge.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: What if I joined you?
text: She nods at Volkov, holding the launch’s line.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: I’m not sure Volkov’s taking
dialog: passengers just now.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Then let’s take mine.
text: The Protagonist nods at Volkov as they walk past.
scene_heading: EXT. HARBOUR, AMALFI - MOMENTS LATER
text: The Protagonist GUNS his boat hard, carving a GLITTERING PATH
text: across the calm harbour. Kat sits, enjoying the speed.
text: The Protagonist pulls up alongside the yacht, CREW MEMBERS
text: SCRAMBLE, unaccustomed to unauthorized approaches. The
text: Protagonist follows Kat's gaze to a FIGURE above, but the sun
text: is behind it. Kat steps onto the yacht.
text: The Protagonist gives the figure a JAUNTY SALUTE. No
text: response. The Protagonist ZIPS back towards shore, passing
text: the yacht’s launch. He waves at Volkov.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. YACHT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Follow Kat into the enormous lounge. She drops her bags -
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Who’s the American?
dialog: 56.
text: She turns. A middle-aged man with cold eyes and a thin beard
text: stands in the doorway. THIS IS SATOR.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: A friend.
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: The man from Shipley’s?
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Who you tried to have beaten up?
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: I ask again. Who is he?
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: We met in Riyadh. In June at the
dialog: American Embassy.
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: Good with fists for a diplomat...
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Paranoia’s your department. He
dialog: seems nice, I invited him to the
dialog: dinner.
dialog: (turns away)
dialog: Max?... Max?!...
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: He’s visiting Pompeii and
dialog: Herculaneum.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Overnight? You just sent him off?!
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: He’s my son.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Our son. I told him I’d go with him
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: I explained you were busy. With
dialog: your friend.
text: He turns, walks away. She watches him leave.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT, AMALFI COAST - EVENING
text: The Protagonist walks towards a table where Sator, holding
text: court, attacks some crabs. Volkov stops the Protagonist and
text: FRISKS him, in full view of the diners.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Where I’m from, you buy me dinner
dialog: first.
text: Without looking, Sator gestures at a seat, Volkov lets the
text: Protagonist pass. He sits.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr Sator? I’m -
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: (quiet)
dialog: Don’t bother. Just tell me if
dialog: you've slept with my wife, yet.
text: The Protagonist glances up at Kat, opposite, chatting.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: No. Not yet.
text: A glance from Sator between buttery mouthfuls of crab.
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: How would you like to die?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Old.
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: You chose the wrong profession.
text: Sator returns a toast from a grinning guest. Reaches a greasy
text: palm to the Protagonist’s cheek, as if in friendliness...
speaker_heading: SATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: There’s a walled garden up the
dialog: road. We're going to take you
dialog: there, cut your throat, not across,
text: in the middle, like a hole. Then we
dialog: take your balls, stuff them in the
dialog: cut, block the windpipe.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Complex.
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: It's gratifying to watch a man you
dialog: don’t like try to pull his own
text: balls out of his throat before he
dialog: chokes.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Is this how you treat all your
dialog: guests?
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: The ones using my family to get to
dialog: me.
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: How else is someone supposed to get
dialog: to you?
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: Only a fool wants to be near me.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Or someone who has something worth
dialog: delaying your gratification for...
text: Sator signals Volkov - Kat glances over as Volkov RISES -
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: We're finished.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Do you like opera?
text: At this, Sator pauses. Waves off Volkov.
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: Not here. You sail?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: I’ve messed around on boats.
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: Be on the dock at eight. Ready to
dialog: do more than mess around.
text: Kat, relieved, watches the Protagonist leave.
scene_heading: EXT. DINING ROOM, YACHT —- MORNING
text: Kat enters, dressed in sailing gear. Sator is already seated,
text: similarly dressed, reading his phone, with a cup of coffee.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Max has missed too much school this
dialog: year. I’m taking him back to
dialog: England.
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: No, you’re not. He has a tutor
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: The school won't be okay with -
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: Yes, they will.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Can I finish?!
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: Look around you - he has everything
dialog: he needs here.
text: A SERVANT places a plate with a silver cover in front of Kat,
text: then pours her coffee.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: You don’t care what he needs. You
dialog: bought the trappings of a king, but
dialog: we both know you’re a grubby little
dialog: man playing power games with a wife
text: who doesn’t love him any more.
text: Sator looks at her.
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: You seem spirited today.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: (defiant)
dialog: Do I?
text: Sator barely nods at the servant, who pulls off the lid...
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: Yes. You do.
text: On the plate, instead of breakfast, is a small drawing. A
text: ‘Rubens’. Kat freezes.
speaker_heading: SATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Were you worried it had been
dialog: destroyed? Rest assured, instinct
dialog: told me to remove it from the
dialog: vault. I’ve always had instincts
dialog: about the future. That’s how I
dialog: built this life you no longer
dialog: value.
text: Kat looks up at him, not knowing what to say or do.
scene_heading: EXT. DOCK, AMALFI - MORNING
text: The Protagonist stands on the dock, dressed for sailing,
text: watching the launch approach...
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Morning.
text: As he gets on, Kat ignores him. Sator enjoys this.
scene_heading: EXT. OPEN OCEAN, AMALFI - MOMENTS LATER
text: The Protagonist tries to catch Kat’s eye, but she will not
text: look his way.
dialog: 60.
text: Sator hands the Protagonist a HARNESS and a HELMET... he
text: looks at them, taken aback, then looks ahead - towards TWO
text: GRAPHITE DARK, HIGHEST TECH AMERICA’S CUP SAILING YACHTS,
text: trimmed and ready.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: When you said sailing...
scene_heading: EXT. SAILING YACHT DECK —- MOMENTS LATER
text: Kat gets on, followed by Sator and the Protagonist. The
text: rigging crew departs. Kat checks the sheets and winches.
text: Sator indicates the harness.
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: You know how?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Aye, Captain.
text: Sator gestures at Kat.
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: She's captain.
scene_heading: EXT. OPEN OCEAN, AMALFI - LATER
text: The boats FLY, SKIMMING THE WATER ON THEIR HYDROFOILS...
text: Sator and the Protagonist are next to each other, standing on
text: one pontoon, LEANING OUT IN THEIR HARNESSES... Kat is at the
dialog: wheel, concentrating...
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: What do you know about opera?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: In 2008 a remote Russian missile
dialog: station was overwhelmed and held
dialog: for a week. When the station was
dialog: retaken, the plutonium 241 on one
dialog: warhead was three quarters of a
dialog: kilo lighter. The missing 241
dialog: surfaced at the opera-house siege
dialog: in Kiev on the 14th.
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: You're well informed. But that
dialog: doesn’t mean you have the
dialog: plutonium.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: I didn’t say I had it. I’m saying I
dialog: know how to get it -
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: KAT (0.S.)
dialog: COMING ABOUT!
text: Kat SWINGS the boat into the wind, SAIL FLAPPING FURIOUSLY as
text: the wind catches it on the other side, and Sator and the
text: Protagonist DUCK under the boom, RACING to the other side,
text: their harnesses SNAPPING TAUT as they lean out...
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: What do you propose?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Partnership.
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: I wouldn't partner with you.
text: Kat works the wheel, tracking the other boat. Her look is one
text: of BOTTLED RAGE...
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: What’s wrong with me?
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: You know how to handle yourself,
dialog: you have no record.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Someone in the arms trade with
dialog: training who covers his tracks? Not
dialog: that shocking.
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: For an intelligence agent.
text: Sator holds the Protagonist’s gaze...
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Secure your jib line.
text: The Protagonist turns - Kat leans in to Sator -
speaker_heading: KAT (CONT'D)
dialog: Burn in hell, Andrei -
text: - and YANKS HIS QUICK-RELEASE - he FLIES off the boat,
text: SMASHING HEAD-FIRST into the waves -
text: The Protagonist sees Sator FACE-DOWN, UNCONSCIOUS - he
text: UNCLIPS, JUMPS to the wheel, SPINNING the boat OFF THE WIND -
speaker_heading: KAT (CONT'D)
dialog: YOU CAN'T JIBE A BOAT LIKE THIS - !
text: The Protagonist STEERS the boat across the wind, SNAPPING THE
text: BOOM ACROSS, ALMOST LOSING THE MAST —
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: You can if you have to -
text: He RELEASES THE SHEETS, SPILLING WIND, LOSING SPEED - as they
text: pass Sator he DIVES into the water - GRABS the oligarch -
text: PULLS his face out of the water... Sator starts COUGHING...
scene_heading: INT. STATEROOM, SATOR'S YACHT - DAY
text: The Protagonist dries himself - the door opens - Kat BURSTS
dialog: in -
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: WHY DIDN’T YOU LET HIM DROWN?!
text: She is on him, smashing her fists into his chest -
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: I need him.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: To sell guns?!
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: I’m not who you think I am.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: That, I know - he showed me the
dialog: drawing.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Do you have any idea what you've
dialog: done?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: I had to get close to him. I don’t
dialog: know what you think your husband is
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: We both know he’s an arms dealer.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: He’s so much more.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: What, then?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Andrei Sator holds all our lives in
dialog: his hands. Not just yours.
text: She looks bemused. A KNOCK at the door - she hides behind it
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: VOLKOV
dialog: Mr Sator wants to see you.
text: The Protagonist nods - pushes the door - Volkov stops it -
speaker_heading: VOLKOV (CONT'D)
dialog: Now.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: He wants to see me without pants?
text: Volkov lets the door shut. The Protagonist turns to Kat -
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
dialog: Trust me.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Save it. I’m not falling for it
dialog: twice.
text: The Protagonist looks at Kat. Sighs.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: You have a better option?
text: She looks into the Protagonist’s eyes. Assessing.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Whatever it takes to get what you
text: want. Just like him. Not a second’s
dialog: thought about me. My son. What do
dialog: you think he’s going to do to me
dialog: now?
text: He pulls a gun from his bag. Offers it to her.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Try not to use this -
text: She takes it - lets it point at him.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
dialog: On anyone.
scene_heading: INT. STUDY, SATOR’S YACHT - EVENING
text: The Protagonist is shown in. Sator is sitting behind his
text: desk. A DOCTOR is taking his blood pressure.
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: Enough -
text: Sator RIPS the cuff off his arm, sending the doctor out -
text: checks a fitness tracker on his wrist.
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: SATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: See? Pulse of a man half my age.
dialog: Drink with me.
text: Sator pours them both tumblers of vodka.
speaker_heading: SATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: It seems I now owe you my life.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: It’s nothing.
text: Sator fixes his black gaze on the Protagonist.
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: My life is not nothing. And I don’t
dialog: like to be in debt.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Then pay me. No retribution against
dialog: your wife.
text: A dangerous beat. Then Sator GRINS -
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: You think she released my harness?
dialog: (laughs )
dialog: It was my own mistake.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Then help me steal the 241. I need
dialog: resources. It’s weapons-grade
dialog: plutonium - that means special
dialog: handling, containment facilities -
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: I know what it means. You lecture
dialog: me about radiation. Andrei Sator,
dialog: digging plutonium from the rubble
dialog: of my city as a teenager?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: Stalsk-12. My home.
text: Sator sips his drink. Looks the Protagonist in the eye.
speaker_heading: SATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: One pod of a warhead exploded at
text: ground level, scattering the
dialog: others. They needed people to find
dialog: the plutonium...

speaker_heading: SATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: It became my first contract -
dialog: nobody else even bid. They thought
dialog: it was a death sentence.
text: INSERT CUT: YOUNG SATOR SPOTS THE MACHINE UNEARTHING A LARGE

speaker_heading: SATOR (CONT'D)

text: INSERT CUT: YOUNG SATOR OPENS THE CAPSULE. HE LIFTS OUT SOME

text: THEY MAKE EYE CONTACT... SATOR STRIKES THE FELLOW WORKER WITH
text: HIS CROWBAR, KILLING HIM...
speaker_heading: SATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: I staked my claim in the new
dialog: Russia. Even now, my company is the
dialog: only one to operate in the ruins.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: The 241’s being transported through
dialog: Northern Europe on its way to the

text: Sator downs his vodka.
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: Stay with us tonight. I insist.
scene_heading: INT. KAT’S STATEROOM, SATOR’S YACHT - NIGHT
text: Kat slips the gun under her mattress, feels the lump - pulls
text: it out - moves to the desk, puts it in her jewellery case -
text: hearing a noise she jumps onto the bed, picks up a book. The
text: door opens. Sator. He locks the door.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: What do you want, Andrei?
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: We're going to talk about today.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: No, we’re not.
dialog: 66.
text: He removes a DIAMOND CUFFLINK...
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: No?
text: Kat starts to get off the bed -
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Don’t think for a minute you can
dialog: treat me the way you treat your
dialog: other women.
text: Sator shifts to lean on the desk, cutting her off from the
text: jewellery box. She sits back down. He removes his belt...
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: And how do you imagine I treat
dialog: these other women?
text: Sator slips the cufflink through a belt hole...
speaker_heading: SATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: You think I force them into
dialog: conversation?
text: Sator tests the diamond studded belt against his palm.
speaker_heading: SATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: You want to be quiet? Fine...
text: He tosses her a pillow.
speaker_heading: SATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Bite down on that...
text: Sator moves towards her - she looks at the jewellery box on
text: the desk - no way around him - Sator looks down at her. She
text: looks up at his cold eyes...
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Even a soul as blank and brittle as
dialog: yours needs a response. Is fear and
dialog: pain enough? Because that’s all I
dialog: have to offer.
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: Then it’ll have to do.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Why didn’t you just throw me out?
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: If I can’t have you, no one can.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: At what point do you give up and
dialog: kill me?
dialog: 67.
text: Sator shrugs, wraps the belt a turn around his fist...
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: Turn over.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Touch me, I scream so loud he
text: hears.
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: You think I'd let him interfere?
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: If he tried you’d have to kill him.
dialog: End of deal. So leave me the fuck
dialog: alone.
text: A KNOCK at the door.
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: NOT NOW!
text: But he hears a RUMBLING... Sator, without a word, exits -
scene_heading: EXT. SATOR’S YACHT, AMALFI COAST - NIGHT
text: Sator GRABS binoculars from one of his men, peering out -
text: A helicopter EMERGES from the darkness, THUNDERING IN...
scene_heading: INT. GUEST STATEROOM, SATOR’S YACHT - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: EXT. SATOR’S YACHT - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: INT. STORAGE AREA, SATOR’S YACHT - CONTINUOUS
text: The Protagonist makes his way through the storage area.
text: Peering through a window, he sees -
scene_heading: INT. ENGINE ROOM, SATOR’S YACHT - CONTINUOUS
text: Crew gathered around the capsule. Sator enters, wipes dirt
text: from the latches and opens it. Sator puts his hand over the
text: open capsule, letting small, flat GOLD BARS leap from the
text: capsule into his hand... he looks up, expectantly...
text: The Crew SHOVES a CREW MEMBER forwards, onto his knees...
text: eyes downcast, he reaches behind - pulls a gold bar from his
text: rear pocket. He offers it to Sator with TREMBLING hands.
text: Sator takes it, eyes never leaving the Crew Member... who
text: finally, tentatively looks up -
text: BAM! Sator JABS him in the mouth with the gold bar, then
text: SMASHES him over the head -
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE AREA, SATOR’S YACHT - CONTINUOUS
text: The Protagonist is REPULSED by what he sees...
scene_heading: INT. ENGINE ROOM, SATOR’S YACHT - CONTINUOUS
text: Sator steps back, breathless, from the Small Crew Member, who
text: lies motionless on the ground.
text: As Sator raises his wrist to check his fitness tracker, BLOOD

speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: Ninety-eight. Not bad for such
dialog: exertion.
scene_heading: EXT. STORAGE AREA, SATOR’S YACHT - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: VOLKOV
text: He was at the window.
text: Sator looks at the Protagonist, who nods at the capsule -
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: I was curious.
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: My property shouldn’t concern you.
dialog: Who are you? How do you come by
dialog: your information about the opera?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Do I work for intelligence
dialog: services? Several, just like you.
dialog: You wouldn’t do business with
dialog: someone who wasn’t savvy enough to
dialog: be recruited. Hell, the CIA
dialog: provides two-thirds of the market
dialog: for fissile material.
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: They're usually buying, not
dialog: selling. But we do live ina
dialog: twilight world...
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Is that Whitman? It’s pretty.
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: Next warning’s a bullet in your

speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: No balls in my throat?
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: There’1l be no time for such things
dialog: in Tallinn.

speaker_heading: SATOR (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST

speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: That’s why I trust her.
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: SATOR

dialog: Put him ashore.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: How do I contact you?
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: You don’t.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: How do you advance me funds?
dialog: Sator TOSSES the Protagonist the BLOODY GOLD BAR - the
text: Protagonist FUMBLES it onto the table. Volkov SNEERS -
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: Handle the plutonium better than
dialog: that.

text: The Protagonist walks the crowded streets with Neil.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: What did you find on the gold?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Three hundred thousand at today’s
dialog: price, no franks, mould marks.
dialog: Nothing. Like it came from outer
dialog: space.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Or the future.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
text: Dead drops. He buries his time
text: capsule, transmits the location,
dialog: then digs it up to collect whatever
dialog: inverted material they’ve sent.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Instantaneous. Where’s he bury it?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Someplace that won’t be disturbed
dialog: for centuries. What did the soil
dialog: sample show?
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Northern Europe or Asia,
dialog: radioactive. Dried blood was
dialog: European.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Pretty broad.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: This is the start of the run.
text: The Protagonist looks back where they came. Then up ahead.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: When does the material arrive?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Thursday. When does Sator arrive?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: I don’t know. But he’1l be here.
speaker_heading: NEIL
text: Cargo’s in a reinforced truck.
text: Nuclear police front and back -
dialog: SUVs with serious armour - you
text: can’t break in through the windows.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: And they can’t break out.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: I don’t follow.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: You will. So, light convoy through
dialog: downtown, what’s the thinking?
speaker_heading: NEIL
text: A crowded, unpredictable traffic
dialog: pattern makes planning an ambush
dialog: almost impossible.
text: The Protagonist looks around at the congestion.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: They have a point. Is the convoy
dialog: monitored from the air?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: No, tracked by GPS - a wrong turn
dialog: or an unscheduled stop, in comes
dialog: the cavalry.
text: Neil and the Protagonist hop a tram. The Protagonist studies
text: the journey along the multi-lane road out of town.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: We need big guns, guns that make
dialog: the point without being fired. We
dialog: need a fast car that doesn’t look
dialog: fast and four heavy vehicles, all
dialog: different - bus, coach, eighteen-
dialog: wheeler...
text: Neil nods.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
dialog: One of them has to be a fire truck.
text: Neil looks up, interested.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
dialog: Most of all, we need to set this up
dialog: with nothing in the record -
dialog: nothing electronic, nothing paper -
dialog: I don’t want Sator ambushing us the

speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: That’s right. You’d never have

speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Andrei, what is this?
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: You know perfectly well what it is,

speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: It’s time to go.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: I’m not going anywhere with you.
text: Sator SLAMS the machine gun back down on the table. Kat
text: FLINCHES. Sator TURNS, enraged...
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: Look at me and understand - you
dialog: don’t negotiate with a tiger - you
dialog: admire a tiger, until it turns on
dialog: you and you feel its TRUE. FUCKING.

text: head.
text: Kat’s SCREAM CRESCENDOS as Sator GRABS her and pushes her up
text: against the glass, PULLS HIS TRIGGER, ‘HEALING’ her wound -
speaker_heading: SATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: One...
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: (via recording)
dialog: Wait!
text: Holds up two fingers -
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: Two...
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: (via recording)
dialog: Don’t!
text: Sator holds up three fingers -
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: Three -
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: (via recording)
dialog: Listen to me! I can help you!
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: I don’t have time to negotiate.
text: The Protagonist looks confused -
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: (via recording)
dialog: Leave her alone!
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: Tell me or I’11 shoot her again!
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: (via recording)
dialog: I don’t know!
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: Tell me now! Is it really in the
dialog: BMW!
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: (via recording)
dialog: Who told you that?
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: You left it in the car not the fire
dialog: truck, right?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: (via recording)
dialog: I don’t know what you’re talking
text: about.
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: If you’re not telling the truth,
text: she dies.
text: Sator GRABS his respirator from the hook, PULLS Kat to her
text: feet - DRAGS her backwards through the door, down a corridor
text: into an AIRLOCK, pulls off her respirator, puts his on...
dialog: 88.
scene_heading: INT. TURNSTILE, TALLINN FREEPORT - THE PRESENT
text: The Protagonist looks through the glass at Kat -
speaker_heading: FEMALE PARAMILITARY
dialog: She’s been shot!
speaker_heading: PARAMILITARY SERGEANT
dialog: Get her this side!
text: Respirator-clad Paramilitaries pull Kat out of the room. The
text: Paramilitary Sergeant turns to the Protagonist.
speaker_heading: PARAMILITARY SERGEANT (CONT'D)
dialog: Was she shot with an inverted
dialog: round?
text: The Protagonist NODS. Neil enters - gestures to the Sergeant
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: This is Ives. He’s one of us -
text: The Protagonist GRABS Neil, THROWS him up against the wall -
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Us?! Who are these guys?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Priya’s. Ours.
text: The Paramilitaries bring Kat into the room - the MEDIC,
text: moving SWIFTLY, examines Kat’s wound.
text: The Protagonist puts his arm AGAINST NEIL’S THROAT —
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: How did Sator know about the
dialog: ambush?
speaker_heading: NEIL
text: Posterity. An ambush on the streets
dialog: can’t stay out of the record -
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Bullshit - he knew every move we
dialog: made! Somebody talked - was it
dialog: you?!
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: At every stage, you’ve known more
dialog: than you should. I’m asking you one
dialog: more time. Did you talk?
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: IVES (0.S.)
dialog: Nobody talked. They’re running a
text: temporal pincer movement.
text: Ives is next to the Protagonist, ready to help Neil...
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: A what?
speaker_heading: IVES
text: A pincer movement. But not in space
dialog: - in time. Half his team moves
dialog: forwards through the event - he
text: monitors them, then attacks from
text: the end, moving backwards. Knowing
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Except where I stashed the
dialog: plutonium.
text: The Protagonist lets Neil go...
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
dialog: Which is not plutonium, is it?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: I told you - it’s what he’s after.
dialog: And you just told him where it is.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: I lied.
text: Neil looks at Kat, bleeding out on the gurney.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
text: He couldn't verify from inside the
dialog: room, he’d have shot her anyway.
dialog: Lying is standard operating
dialog: procedure.
text: The Medic steps away from Kat, shakes his head.
speaker_heading: MEDIC
text: It’s spread too far.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Meaning what?
speaker_heading: IVES
dialog: She’s going to die.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: (to Protagonist)
dialog: Standard operating procedure?
dialog: (MORE )
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: NEIL (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Ives)
dialog: Can’t you stabilize inverse
dialog: radiation by inverting the patient?
speaker_heading: IVES
dialog: That takes days -
text: The Protagonist points at the turnstile -
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Let's go.
speaker_heading: IVES
dialog: We took control of this machine
dialog: minutes ago - before that it’s
dialog: Sator’s.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: How long will she live on this
dialog: side?
speaker_heading: MEDIC
dialog: Three hours, tops.
text: The Protagonist thinks. He looks at Kat, who is dying.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: I’m taking her through. I’m not
dialog: going to let her die, I’1l take my
dialog: chances out there.
speaker_heading: IVES
dialog: Chances of what? We’ve got no way
dialog: to bring you back.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
text: We find another machine.
speaker_heading: IVES
dialog: A week ago? Where?
text: The Protagonist looks at Neil - they have the same idea -
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Oslo.
speaker_heading: IVES
dialog: That facility’s impregnable. It’s
text: inside an airport security
text: perimeter.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Not last week, it wasn’t. We’re
dialog: going in. You might as well help.
text: Ives, shaking his head, joins in. As they carry Kat towards
text: the vault door, Ives points at the glass partition -
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: IVES
dialog: This is the proving window... as
dialog: you approach the turnstile if you
dialog: don’t see yourself through the
dialog: proving window, do not enter the
dialog: machine.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: IVES
dialog: If you haven’t seen yourself
dialog: reverse-exit the machine, you won't
dialog: be getting out. Okay, first in,
dialog: last out. Get into the turnstile,
dialog: pass through - I’1l already be
dialog: there with her.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Is that gonna work?
text: Ives pauses, watching activity on the other side of the
text: window -
speaker_heading: IVES
dialog: (points)
dialog: Yeah...
text: The Protagonist turns to see HIMSELF on the other side of the
text: glass, MOVING IN REVERSE, wheeling KAT ‘TOWARDS’ THE VAULT
speaker_heading: DOOR -
speaker_heading: IVES (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's go!
text: Ives OPENS the door - the Protagonist takes one last look at
text: his backwards self ‘entering’ the machine, then STEPS INSIDE
text: We follow him in as the door SHUTS behind him - he puts his
text: back to the wall - the machine starts CLANKING like an MRI -
text: the door opens on the other side - he STEPS OUT...
text: To see Ives struggling with Kat - he moves to help - Neil is
dialog: already there (first in, last out).
text: The Protagonist looks through the glass to where he and Ives
text: now appear to be moving backwards...
text: The Medic tends to Kat.
speaker_heading: MEDIC
text: She’s stabilizing slowly. I'll
dialog: clean and close, the rest is time.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: How long does she need?
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: MEDIC
dialog: 4 or 5 days. A week to be sure.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: (to Neil)
dialog: Figure out how to get us to Oslo -
dialog: I’ve got to get back out there -
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: To do what?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: To stop Sator getting away with the
dialog: whatever it is I just gave him.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: You didn’t - you lied about where
dialog: it was. Wait, you’re going out
dialog: there for her.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: He threatened to kill her in the
dialog: past... if he does, what happens to
dialog: her here?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: It’s unknowable. If you’re there to
dialog: make a change, you’re not here to
dialog: observe its effect.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: What do you believe?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: What’s happened’s happened. We have
dialog: to save her here and now. And if
dialog: you go back out there you might
dialog: hand him exactly what he’s after.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Don’t let them take her back
dialog: through -
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: I won't.
speaker_heading: IVES
dialog: You can’t stay here.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: And we don’t have much time - so
dialog: find us a nice cosy shipping
dialog: container that just came off a ship
dialog: from Oslo...
text: The Protagonist moves towards the door. Ives steps up -
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: IVES
dialog: This is cowboy shit. You have no
dialog: idea what you’re getting into if
dialog: you go through that door.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Well, I’m going, so any tips would
dialog: be welcome.
text: Ives sees determination. Shakes his head.
speaker_heading: IVES
dialog: Wheeler, brief him.
text: The female Paramilitary, WHEELER, hands the Protagonist a
dialog: respirator -—
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: You need your own air - regular air
dialog: won’t pass through the membranes
dialog: of inverted lungs. The number-one
dialog: rule - don’t come into contact with
dialog: your forwards self - that’s the
dialog: whole point of these barriers -
text: Wheeler BANGS on the proving window -
speaker_heading: WHEELER (CONT'D)
dialog: And protective suits - if any of
dialog: your particles came into contact -
text: The Protagonist is putting on the respirator -
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: Annihilation.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: That’s bad, right?
text: The Protagonist follows Wheeler into a corridor lined with
text: RESPIRATORS and HAZARD SUITS... at the end is an AIRLOCK...
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: When you exit the airlock, take a
dialog: moment to orient yourself - things
dialog: will feel strange. When you run,
dialog: the wind will be at your back. If
dialog: you encounter fire, ice will form
dialog: on your suit, as the transfer of
dialog: heat is reversed. Gravity will feel
dialog: normal, but appear reversed for the
dialog: world around you. Don’t worry about
dialog: things falling, so much as rising.
dialog: (MORE )
dialog: 94,
speaker_heading: WHEELER (CONT'D)
dialog: If you see an object demonstrating
dialog: unprompted instability, stay clear,
dialog: it may be about to leap into the
dialog: air. You may experience distortions
dialog: to your vision and hearing - this
dialog: is normal - light waves and sound
dialog: waves are propagating away from
dialog: you. This should clear as your
text: brain adjusts.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Can I drive a car?
speaker_heading: IVES
dialog: Cowboy shit.
text: Ives and Neil are grabbing respirators...
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: I can’t vouch for the handling,
dialog: friction and wind resistance are
dialog: reversed. You’re inverted, the
dialog: world is not. You can’t fight the
dialog: prevailing wind of entropy. Don’t
dialog: try flying a plane - it’d fall out
dialog: of the sky. Once again, you’re
dialog: inverted, the world is not - and
dialog: those forces will be pushing back
dialog: on you continuously.
text: The Protagonist turns to Neil -
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Was there a transponder on the
dialog: case?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: He’ll have tossed the case -
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: I’m going backwards - that’s the
dialog: ball I have to follow. Give me the
dialog: reader.
text: Neil hands him a phone. The Protagonist sticks a Bluetooth
text: earpiece in his ear, passes into the airlock - Wheeler shuts
text: it behind him. Then opens the OUTER DOOR...
scene_heading: EXT. YARD, TALLINN FREEPORT - CONTINUOUS
text: The Protagonist emerges into a strange world - the air feels
text: different, the friction of his feet on the asphalt feels
text: different. He looks up at birds flying backwards... at steam
text: contracting... at a pile of dust sucking itself bigger...
text: In the yard he spots the SAAB... he runs over, finds the keys
text: sitting on the front tyre -
dialog: 95.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. SAAB - CONTINUOUS
text: The Protagonist LOOKS in the glove box - NOTHING - LOOKS in
text: the wheel well - NOTHING - the back seat - NOTHING. He gives
text: up - starts the engine... pulls out, gently, feeling out the
text: strange handling of the vehicle...
scene_heading: INT./EXT. SAAB, TALLINN STREETS - MOMENTS LATER
text: The Protagonist steers the car around BACKWARDS-MOVING
text: TRAFFIC and BACKWARDS-WALKING PEDESTRIANS, MARVELLING...
text: People STARE at the car as it approaches, as if they already
text: know a backwards-driven car is heading their way (which, of
dialog: course, they do).
text: He checks the phone - a blinking dot half a mile away - he
text: GUNS it, FISHTAILING unexpectedly...
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: We see the fire fight from before IN REVERSE - Neil laying
text: down fire from between cars, Kat carried ‘back’ to the
dialog: Audi...
text: Behind Neil, Sator, MOVING FORWARDS, checks the glove
text: compartment of the BMW... NOTHING. FUMING, he heads back to
text: the Mercedes, DUCKING behind cars, bullets FLYING...
scene_heading: INT./EXT. SAAB - CONTINUOUS
text: The Protagonist pulls onto a busy highway where the cars are
text: FACING HIM, BUT MOVING IN HIS DIRECTION...
text: The Saab races along, the only normal-looking car on a road
text: full of cars SPEEDING BACKWARDS...
text: On the phone, the flashing dot is CLOSER...
text: Slowing, the Protagonist spots the ORANGE CASE lying empty by
text: the side of the road. He PULLS OVER some distance away -
text: JUMPS out of the car - pulls out his BLUETOOTH EARPIECE and
text: WEDGES it between the foam padding and the orange plastic...
text: The Protagonist heads back to his car, checks the signal from
text: his phone... PEERS at the case...
text: The case SHUDDERS TO LIFE - LEAPS INTO THE WINDOW OF A
text: PASSING CAR - THE MERCEDES -
text: The Protagonist PEELS OUT, DUST FLIES UP IN CLOUDS THAT DON’T
text: FULLY BLOSSOM as expected, but CONTRACT...
text: The Protagonist STRUGGLES with the wheel, trying to keep the
text: car on the road with its unaccustomed handling...
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Christ!
text: He can see the Mercedes up ahead, weaving through traffic...
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY, TALLINN - CONTINUOUS
text: The Mercedes races back up the off-ramp - the Saab follows,
text: weaving through traffic which faces him, but travels
dialog: backwards -
text: As the Saab gets within a couple car lengths, his phone cuts
text: in with audio from his Bluetooth bug in the Mercedes -
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: (over radio)
dialog: - the material’s not in the case -
text: Sound cuts in and out - FRAGMENTS of voices - he struggles to
text: keep pace with the Mercedes - he listens hard -
speaker_heading: SATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: (over radio)
dialog: -Get the other sections of the
dialog: algorithm to the hypocentre- -He
dialog: was lying- -it wasn’t in the BMW-
speaker_heading: INVERTED DRIVER
dialog: (over radio)
dialog: So where is it?
scene_heading: INT. /EXT. SAAB - CONTINUOUS
text: The Protagonist finds a clear lane and guns the engine,
text: tracking the Mercedes as it pulls alongside the Audi, racing
text: ‘forwards’, and Sator, orange case in hand, climbs from the
text: Mercedes into the Audi...
text: The Audi pulls alongside the BMW - the Protagonist, sensing
text: the moment, LOWERS HIS WINDOW... Sator lifts the orange case,
dialog: BUT HIS EYES ARE ELSEWHERE —-
text: Inside the Saab, the Protagonist hears BANGING - the BLACK
text: METAL SHAPE ‘unwedges’ from where it’s been stuck down the
text: side of a seat - ‘BOUNCING’ around the interior -
text: The Saab CUTS between the Audi and the BMW -
text: The orange case FLIES OUT OF SATOR’S HANDS - BOUNCES OFF THE
text: SAAB'S WINDSHIELD, ‘LANDING’ IN THE BMW -
text: JUST AS THE BLACK METAL SHAPE JUMPS OUT OF THE SAAB AND INTO
text: THE (FORWARD) PROTAGONIST’S LOWER HAND...
dialog: 97.
text: Sator, SEEING THIS, YANKS the wheel - CLIPS the Saab - the
text: Protagonist STRUGGLES for control - but the Saab SPINS AND
text: ROLLS DOWN THE HIGHWAY, COMING TO REST ON ITS ROOF.
text: The Protagonist, upside down in the car, regains
text: consciousness... fuel leaks, pooling outside the window... he
text: sees expensive shoes approach, then Sator’s face peering in
text: at him. In his hand is a LIGHTER.
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: I saw the hand-off. You made me
dialog: shoot her for nothing.
text: Sator tips his lighter to read his fitness tracker...
speaker_heading: SATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: You did get my pulse above 130. No
dialog: one’s done that before. Not even
dialog: my wife.
text: Backing away, Sator DROPS the lighter, the fuel EXPLODES,
text: THROWING THE CAR SIDEWAYS - BUT INSTEAD OF FULLY BLOOMING,
text: THE FLAMES CONTRACT, SPARING THE PROTAGONIST WHO LIES THERE,
text: FREEZING. HE PASSES OUT.
text: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. SHIPPING CONTAINER - LATER
text: The Protagonist comes to on a stretcher. Kat is ona
text: stretcher next to him. Neil sits between them. The
text: Protagonist looks at his hands, feels his face, confused.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: The heat transfer was reversed -
dialog: you may be the first case of
dialog: hypothermia from a gasoline
dialog: explosion in history.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
text: At this point, nothing surprises.
text: The Protagonist looks around the shipping container.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: You left Ives and his team one hell
text: of a clean-up.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: We’re on our way back to Oslo?
speaker_heading: NEIL
text: In a Rotas shipping container.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: He’s got the material, Neil. I
text: handed it to him on a plate.
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: I warned you -
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: ‘What’s happened’s happened.’ I get
dialog: it, now. But it’s tough to take
dialog: things on trust from people
dialog: speaking half-truths.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: That’s not fair -
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: You were part of this before we
dialog: met. Were you working for Priya?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Who recruited you, Neil?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: It can't possibly do you any good
dialog: to know that right now. When this
dialog: is over, if we’re still standing
dialog: and you still care, you can hear my
dialog: life story, okay?
text: Kat GROANS, her eyes flicker open to see the Protagonist.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: I’m sorry I involved you.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: You need to tell me what’s going
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Apparently, Neil here knows more
dialog: about it than I do.
dialog: (to Neil)
dialog: Good luck, pal.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: By telling Kat anything we’re
text: compromising her in Priya’s eyes.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
text: In Priya’s eyes she’s already
dialog: compromised. And she has a right to
dialog: know why she might die.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: I’m going to die?
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Not if we have anything to say
dialog: about it.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: And we do.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Let me start with the simple stuff.
dialog: Every law of physics operates the
dialog: same forwards and backwards, except
dialog: one. Entropy...
text: The Protagonist moves to the back of the container, pulls out
text: his phone, checks Neil’s attention is on Kat...
speaker_heading: SATOR
dialog: (via recording)
dialog: -bring- -final section- -directly
text: to the hypocentre- -with the other
dialog: parts- -the algorithm-
text: The recording breaks up. The Protagonist puts the phone away,
text: FLEXES his elbow, feeling out some pain... He rolls up his
text: sleeve - there is a DARK PATCH of skin forming -
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Are you injured?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: What’s the ‘algorithm’, Neil?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: The 241 is one section of it. One
dialog: out of nine. It’s a formula
dialog: rendered into physical form so it
dialog: can’t be copied or communicated. A
dialog: black box with one function.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Which is?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Inversion. But not objects or
dialog: people. The world around us.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: I don’t understand.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: As they invert the entropy of more
dialog: and more objects...
text: Neil holds his hands, fingers spread, pointing at each other
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: NEIL (CONT'D)
dialog: The two directions of time are
dialog: becoming more intertwined...
text: He slowly brings his fingers together, into the ‘Tenet’
text: gesture -
speaker_heading: NEIL (CONT'D)
dialog: But because the environment’s
dialog: entropy flows in our direction...
text: He pushes one hand back with the other -
text: Neil nods,
speaker_heading: NEIL (CONT'D)
dialog: ...we dominate. They’re always
dialog: swimming upstream. It’s what saved
dialog: your life - the inverted explosion
text: was pushing against the
dialog: environment.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
text: Pissing in the wind.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: But the algorithm can change the
dialog: direction of that wind. It can
dialog: invert the entropy of the world.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: And if that happens?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Oh, end of play.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: ‘End of play’? Can you be a little
dialog: more precise?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Our present wiped out, our past
dialog: obliterated. Everyone and
dialog: everything who ever lived destroyed
dialog: instantly. Precise enough?
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Including my son.
text: gravely. Kat winces, clearly in pain.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Let me sedate you - the more you
dialog: sleep the faster you'll heal.
text: Neil injects Kat in the arm. Her eyes close.
dialog: 101.
scene_heading: EXT. CARGO SHIP - LATER
text: Close on the hull, we see the water UNSPLASHING at the bow
text: and SUCKING UNDERNEATH the stern as the ship steams
text: majestically backwards through the cold North Sea...
scene_heading: INT. SHIPPING CONTAINER - LATER
text: BANGING wakes the Protagonist - Neil is at a peephole.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: We're on a truck. Shouldn’t be too
dialog: long now.
scene_heading: INT. SHIPPING CONTAINER - LATER
text: Neil is awake. He looks over at the Protagonist, who is
text: examining a LESION on his right arm...
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: You in pain?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Must’ve got nicked in Tallinn.
dialog: (rolls down sleeve)
dialog: I’ve been thinking... we’re their
dialog: ancestors. If they destroy us,
dialog: won’t that destroy them?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Bringing us to the grandfather
dialog: paradox.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: The what?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: The classic thought experiment - if
dialog: you went back in time and killed
dialog: your own grandfather, how could you
dialog: have been born to commit the act?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: What’s the answer?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: There is no answer, it’s a paradox.
dialog: But in the future, those in power
dialog: clearly believe that you can kick
text: Grandpa down the stairs, gouge his
dialog: eyes and slit his throat without
dialog: consequence.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Could they be right?
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: It doesn’t matter. They believe it,
dialog: so they’re willing to destroy us.
dialog: Can I go back to sleep?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: No. I thought of something else.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Great.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: This reversing the flow of time...
dialog: doesn’t us being here now mean it
dialog: never happens? That we stop them?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Optimistically, I’d say that’s
dialog: right.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Pessimistically?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: In a parallel-worlds theory, we
dialog: can’t know the relationship between
dialog: consciousness and multiple
dialog: realities. Does your head hurt yet?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Try sleep.
scene_heading: INT. SAME - LATER
text: A final THUD, then STILLNESS. The Protagonist moves to the
text: peephole, unplugs it and peers out:
text: The WRECKED PLANE, FLOODLIT, sitting outside the COLLAPSED
text: WALL which has been sealed with STEEL FENCING.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Shit. They didn’t take us inside.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: What do we do?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: We use the breach. The chaos right
text: after impact. Get ready.
text: They both turn to look at the unconscious Kat.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
dialog: Is she healed enough?
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: I don’t know. I’ve never done this

scene_heading: INT. SAME - NIGHT
text: The Protagonist is at the peephole - the ground is WET. CLEAN-

text: CREWS ‘unpack’ their equipment around the wreck...
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Fire crew’s there...
text: The Protagonist WINCES as he pulls his arm into its sleeve...
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
dialog: We get Kat through the breach, I
dialog: take care of Sator’s man and secure
dialog: the vault. Then you bring her in.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: How’s the arm?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Not good.
text: The Protagonist spots a HOLE in the fabric of his black suit

speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: But afterwards -
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: With things the same, I knew you’d

speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: What’s going on? Where’s Neil?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Nursing Katherine Barton. Who
dialog: almost died because of you.
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: What did I do?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: It’s what you’re going to do. In
dialog: two days you’re going to have me
text: dangle plutonium 241 in front of
dialog: the world’s most dangerous arms
dialog: dealer... I want to know why.
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: You let him get hold of 241?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: No. I let him get hold of the
dialog: algorithm.
text: Priya looks at the Protagonist, surprised he knows the term.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
dialog: Tell me about it, Priya.
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: It’s unique. The scientist who
dialog: built it took her own life so she
dialog: couldn't be forced to make another.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: A scientist in the future?
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: Generations from now.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Why did she have to kill herself?
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: You're familiar with the Manhattan
dialog: Project? As they approached the
dialog: first atomic test, Oppenheimer
dialog: became concerned the detonation
dialog: might produce a chain reaction,
dialog: engulfing the world.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: They went ahead anyway, and got
dialog: lucky.
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: Think of our scientist as her
dialog: generation’s Oppenheimer - she
dialog: devises a method for inverting the
dialog: world, but becomes convinced that
dialog: by destroying us, they destroy
dialog: themselves.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: The grandfather paradox.
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: Unlike Oppenheimer, she rebels,
dialog: splitting the algorithm into nine
dialog: sections and hiding them the best
dialog: place she can think of...
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: The past. Here. Now.
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: There are nine nuclear powers. Nine
dialog: bombs. Nine sets of the most
dialog: closely guarded materials in the
dialog: history of the world. The best
dialog: hiding places possible.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Nuclear containment facilities.
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: Sator’s lifelong mission, financed
dialog: and guided by the future, has been
dialog: to find and reassemble the
dialog: algorithm.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Why did they choose him?
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: The necessary combination of greed
dialog: and ambition. But mostly, he was in
dialog: the right place at the right time.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: The collapse of the Soviet Union.
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: The most insecure moment in the
dialog: history of nuclear weapons.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: And there he was. How many of the
dialog: sections does he have?
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: After the 241? All nine.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Christ. And that’s why you’re going
dialog: to do it differently this time.
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: To change things? So Katherine
dialog: won’t get hurt?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: So Sator won’t get the algorithm.
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: If that universe can exist, we
dialog: don’t live in it.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Let’s try. You’re going to warn me.
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: No. I’m not. Ignorance is our
dialog: ammunition. If you’d known what the
dialog: algorithm was, would you have let
dialog: it fall into Sator’s hands?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: You want him to get the last
dialog: section?
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: It’s the only way he'll bring
dialog: together the other eight.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: I was supposed to steal it, then
dialog: lose it?
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Mission accomplished.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: You used me.
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: As you used Katherine. Standard
dialog: operating procedure. You’ve done
dialog: your part.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: My part? I’m the protagonist of
dialog: this operation -
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: You're a protagonist.
dialog: (off look)
dialog: What? You thought you were the only
dialog: person capable of saving the world?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: No. But I am. Because I haven’t
dialog: told you where he’s assembling the
dialog: algorithm, or when.
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: You’re about to.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: No, I’m not. So deal us in.
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: Why would you involve her again?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
text: She can get close to him.
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: Does he still trust her?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: He thinks she’s dead. But he used
dialog: to.
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: You have started looking at the
dialog: world in a new way.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: And now it’s your turn. Assuming
dialog: she makes it out alive, whether or
dialog: not you feel she knows too much...
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: I can’t.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: If you don’t have the authority,
dialog: talk to whoever’s in charge of
dialog: loose ends. I need your word that
dialog: she and her son will be safe.
speaker_heading: PRIYA
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: What good is someone’s word in our

speaker_heading: KAT

speaker_heading: KAT

speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Not with a dead man’s switch.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: A what?
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: That fitness tracker he wears...
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: He’s obsessive about his health.
speaker_heading: NEIL
text: It’ll be linked to a switch.
dialog: Probably a simple email burst,
dialog: revealing the location of the dead
dialog: drop, set to fire if his heart
text: stops.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
text: In effect, his death activates the
dialog: algorithm. He dies, the world ends

text: Kat realizes...
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: No, you’ve missed the point. He’s
text: intending to end his life.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: KAT
text: He’s dying. Inoperable pancreatic

speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST

speaker_heading: KAT

speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST

speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: I went ashore with Max, he flew
dialog: off. I don’t know what date it
dialog: was...
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: The 14th. Ten days ago. He was in
dialog: Ukraine, stealing a section of the
dialog: algorithm from an American team.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: At the Kiev Opera siege. How do you
dialog: know about that?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: The point is - he wasn’t on the
text: yacht, so that’s his window.
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: To come back to that golden moment
dialog: and have it be his last.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Everyone’s last. We have to lift

text: BACK TO RED-TEAM BRIEFING -
text: Ives points to each of the three elements in turn:
speaker_heading: IVES (CONT'D)
dialog: Landing zone, LZ, well defended,
dialog: including ground-to-air ordinance.
text: We drop in, clear the LZ for Blue
dialog: team’s evacuation... We make our

speaker_heading: RED SOLDIER 1
dialog: They’1l have inverse ordinance?
speaker_heading: IVES
dialog: Inverse, conventional, forwards

text: Ives goes back to the diagram -
speaker_heading: IVES (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: RED SOLDIER 2
dialog: How do we defuse the bomb up there?
speaker_heading: IVES
text: We don’t. The explosion takes place

speaker_heading: IVES (CONT'D)

text: BACK TO RED-TEAM BRIEFING -
speaker_heading: IVES

speaker_heading: IVES

dialog: simultaneously. Do not get on the
dialog: chopper if you can’t stop thinking
dialog: in linear terms. You want to be on
dialog: the team who lifts the contents of

speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Absolutely.
speaker_heading: IVES
dialog: That's us. We're the splinter unit.
speaker_heading: PROTAGONIST
dialog: Just us?
speaker_heading: IVES
