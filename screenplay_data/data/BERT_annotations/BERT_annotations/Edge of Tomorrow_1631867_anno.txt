scene_heading: INT. UNITED DEFENSE FORCES DROPSHIP - IN FLIGHT - STORM
text: SOUND: Someone breathing, GASPING for breath they're so
text: afraid. And the HIGH-PITCHED WHINE of RAMJETS laboring
dialog: against heavy side-winds as we struggle to focus on -
text: - OPEN OCEAN. CHURNING, whipping past at a couple hundred
text: miles an hour, 800 feet below a SOLDIER'S DANGLING BOOTS.
speaker_heading: CAGE (V.O.)
dialog: What am I doing here?
text: PVT. BILLY CAGE is maybe 20. Too young for this. COLD SWEAT
text: trickles into his eyes. When he tries to wipe it away, his
text: ARMORED FINGERS CLACK against clear ACRYLIC. His FACEPLATE.
text: Cage is wearing an EXOJACKET: powered, tight-fitting body
text: armor, bristling with weaponry. TWO DOZEN OTHER young,
text: terrified SOLDIERS hang with him, also jacketed, dangling
text: over the OPEN BAY DOORS, over OCEAN.
text: Cage taps a button. His faceplate opens, NOISE floods in at a
text: DEAFENING ROAR. He rubs his eyes -
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Don't poke yer eye out, bud.
text: PVT. YONABURU, a hard-ass fuckup with Asian features but a
text: Southern drawl - Cage's battle-buddy - smiles.
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: GET YOUR PLATE SHUT, PRIVATE!
text: FROM UP FRONT, BATTLE-SCARRED SGT. FARELL shoots them a look.
text: ACROSS from Cage, GRIFF, 25, a burly-looking bad-ass, keeps
text: making an about-to-vomit face, barely fighting back the urge.
speaker_heading: SGT. FARELL (CONT'D)
dialog: PRIVATE GRIFF! Don't PUKE.
speaker_heading: GRIFF
dialog: Yes sir!
text: Griff's face twitches again. A female soldier, NANCE, grins.
speaker_heading: NANCE
dialog: You spit up in yer jacket, you're
dialog: in for a world a' shit.
text: FORD, a jarhead dickweed proper, LAUGHS, missing a few teeth.
text: Now OIL from Cage's jacketed fingers streaks his face. The
text: faceplate sucks shut. FLOATING HEADS-UP READOUTS flicker up -
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: You OK there, buddy?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: (trembling)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: We're gonna be fine. I got us life
dialog: insurance. Mrs. Smith.
text: Yonaburu taps "MRS. SMITH", an antiquated SMITH & WESSON
text: -357, against his faceplate and slips it in his exojacket's
text: utility belt. Cage doesn't look too reassured.
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
text: ...READY FOR DROP... HOLDING...
scene_heading: BENEATH THEIR FEET
text: DOZENS OF OTHER FB90 DROPSHIPS streak by; squarish, clumsy-
text: looking, like flying bricks, which is what everyone calls
text: them. ARTILLERY FIRE STRAFES back and forth as -
text: A DROPSHIP takes a HIT and is gone. FAR BELOW, a BEACH comes
text: into view, a red SQUARE superimposed on the HEADS-UP -
text: THE DROP POINT. Cage shuts his eyes.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Oh God oh God oh God -
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: GO! GO! Go!
text: The first SOLDIER hits a release and FALLS, tumbling. Then
text: ANOTHER. Then ANOTHER. YONABURU gives Cage the thumbs up and -
speaker_heading: YONABURU
speaker_heading: WOOOHOOOO!
text: Yonaburu hits his RELEASE and -
text: FROM BENEATH THE DROPSHIP
text: - SOLDIERS LITTER OUT, tumbling like living ordinance. You'd
dialog: think parachutes might open... but they don't.
text: BACK IN THE DROP SHIP
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: DROP! DROP, YOU BABIES!
text: CAGE CAN'T DO IT. SEVERAL OTHERS can't, either. ONE SOLDIER
text: DANGLES by a jacketed hand like a kitten going to the vet.
text: Sgt. Farell KICKS the hand free and JUMPS himself -
speaker_heading: RADIO
dialog: (screeching)
text: ..-TAKING FIRE UP HERE, WE GOTTA...
text: KERWHAM! The dropship is STRUCK - TWICE. One of the hanging
text: soldiers is TORN IN HALF, the pieces flying. FLAME belches
text: through the DROPBAY and the ship LURCHES -
text: Cage SCREAMS, HITS his release and -
text: TUMBLES OUT OF THE DROPSHIP
text: The dropship ABOVE, in FLAMES, BURNING SOLDIERS falling,
text: OTHERS clinging on as it SPINS OUT OF CONTROL. CAGE FALLS,
text: SCREAMING, his HEADS-UP flashing red, the ground RUSHING UP -
scene_heading: EXT. BEACHHEAD - BATTLE OF RUBY TUESDAY
text: - WHUMP! THUMP! FHUMP! SOLDIERS hit the beach, hard enough to
text: leave CRATERS in the WET SAND.
text: AND HERE COMES CAGE, SCREAMING, FLAILING, KICKING - at the
text: last second his jacket goes into AUTOLAND; tiny JETS cushion
dialog: the fall just enough to not break any bones and... WHAM!
text: Two seconds of ear-ringing silence. A GASP as Cage's lungs
text: refill, he staggers up, WET SAND falling from his faceplate,
scene_heading: his HEADS-UP highlighting TERRAIN and FRIENDLIES -
text: THREE OTHER SOLDIERS stagger up out of their own craters.
speaker_heading: HAPPY SOLDIER
dialog: WE MADE IT!
text: THE HAPPY SOLDIER smiles at Cage, and -—
text: 12 TONS OF FLAMING DROPSHIP LAND ON THE HAPPY SOLDIER. Cage
text: is THROWN BACK from the impact, landing in two feet of surf.
text: Struggling back up, he sees -
text: THE BROKEN DROPSHIP SPEWING FLAME, ANOTHER SOLDIER stuck half-
text: under the ship, FLAILING as he dies. Cage stares in shock.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: CAGE! YOU IN ONE PIECE?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I, uh, yeah - the ship, the ship...
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: COME ON!
text: Cage turns, seeing YONABURU with a FLOATING BLUE HEADS-UP
text: FLAG superimposed above him. Cage blindly runs after him as -
dialog: UP THE BEACH
text: TENS OF THOUSANDS OF OTHER JACKETED INFANTRY stream to their
text: meetpoints, thick as ants, ARTILLERY STRAFING PAST THEM as -
speaker_heading: IN THE SKY
text: MORE DROPSHIPS THAN WE CAN COUNT and fast-moving STRIKEJETS
text: beyond them STREAK in loose formations into the horizon and -
speaker_heading: OUT TO SEA
text: MASSIVE CARRIERS lob HEAVY ORDINANCE into the already blasted
text: coastline, pieces of SEA-CLIFF exploding. HALF A MILLION
text: SOLDIERS are landing today in what can only be -
scene_heading: HUMANITY'S LAST, BEST STAND... RUBY TUESDAY.
text: It looks like D-Day meets Armageddon.
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL (ON RADIO)
text: ASSEMBLE AT THE TRENCH!
scene_heading: CAGE AND YONABURU CLUMSILY RUN
dialog: to join their company. It's hard to even walk in an exojacket
dialog: if you're not practiced in it, and they aren't.
text: ON THEIR HEADS-UPS: Their TWO BLUE DOTS get closer to the
text: cluster of OTHER BLUE DOTS as the first ENEMY FIRE starts
text: streaking in, TEARING UP THE BEACH. THAP! THAP!
scene_heading: CAGE JUMPS, YONABURU TOO -—
text: - BOTH land badly, SCRAMBLE UP, catching a first GLIMPSE of
text: THOUSANDS OF ENEMY INFANTRY streaming down the cliffs but -
text: CAGE AND YONABURU TUMBLE INTO THE TRENCH
text: Falling in with the other terrified SOLDIERS, SGT. FARELL
dialog: screaming to TAC-COM about where's his fucking air support.
text: Cage has two seconds to get his bearings before -
scene_heading: ON CAGE'S HEADS-UP
text: A RED DOT approaching the BLUE DOTS of his company. Then a
text: few more RED DOTS...
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: This isn't how it's supposed to be.
dialog: This isn't... First Division was
dialog: supposed to clean this up -
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: LOCK AND LOAD!
text: Cage watches in mounting horror as the heads-up shows FOUR
text: MORE PAIR. And then 20. And then... a WALL OF RED.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: We're all gonna die.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Shut the fuck up!
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
text: HOLD... HOLDING...
text: Even the Sergeant can't hide his fear.
speaker_heading: SGT. FARELL (CONT'D)
dialog: LIGHT 'EM UP!
text: As the FIRST SOLDIER out of the trench jumps up, a PROJECTILE
text: hits him, knocking him at CAGE'S FEET -—
text: The PROJECTILE in the soldier's chest isn't of human origin.
text: It's streaked with silver, biomechanical, WRIGGLING. A MIMIC
text: "JAVELIN". And from where the thing flew -
scene_heading: THE ON-RUSHING MIMIC HORDE.
dialog: At first, you could mistake them for human infantry, but
text: they're not. They are ALIEN KILLING MACHINES.
text: They're ARMORED, SHARP, and BRISTLING with unidentifiable
text: weaponry that seems to grow out of their bodies, like a
dialog: nightmare version of the jacketed soldiers they're evolved to
text: kill. Parts are METAL, parts GLISTENING BIOMASS.
dialog: MIMICS have no individuality, no emotion, purpose or
dialog: existence other than the vicious removal of human life.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: INCOMING!
text: THE SOLDIERS FIRE into the RACING MASS. They might as well be
text: firing BB-GUNS at an oncoming BUFFALO STAMPEDE.
text: ANOTHER soldier, down the line, takes TWO JAVELIN HITS. His
text: jacket starts SHAKING, JITTERBUGGING off his brainstem's
text: death-throes, his autocannon FIRING wildly -
text: MIMIC JAVELINS sweep the trench where Cage and Yonaburu try
dialog: to aim - THUP THUP THUP!
speaker_heading: SGT. FARELL (RADIO)
text: CHECKPOINT TWO! MOVE MOVE MOVE!
text: Soldiers start RUNNING. But Cage is FROZEN TO THE SPOT,
text: trembling, unable to MOVE. Yonaburu SLIDES DOWN BESIDE HIM -
speaker_heading: YONABURU
scene_heading: COME ON, CAGE! WE GOTTA -—
text: - BLAM! A SECTION OF TRENCH COLLAPSES.
text: The hail of sand and smoke clears just in time to see the
text: rest of 3rd Platoon HAULING ASS UP THE BEACH. ON CAGE'S HEADS-—
text: UP, the LITTLE BLUE DOTS of their team head OFFSCREEN.
text: CAGE AND YONABURU ARE TOTALLY CUT OFF.
speaker_heading: YONABURU (CONT'D)
dialog: SHIT! SHIT!
text: Yonaburu slides into firing position - target numbering
dialog: systems on OVERLOAD -
speaker_heading: YONABURU (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus, here it comes.
text: Cage lifts his weapon, shaking, trying to pick a target. It's
dialog: useless. In two seconds, they're gonna be DEAD MEAT.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Oh god oh god oh god -
text: A squelchy RADIO SCREECH -
speaker_heading: CHIEF BREEDER (RADIO)
scene_heading: ...VALKYRIE ONE, this is CHIEF
text: BREEDER. STRIKEJETS GOT A LOCK...
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE (RADIO)
scene_heading: THEN LAY 'EM DOWN, C.B.
speaker_heading: CHIEF BREEDER
dialog: YES, MA'AM!
text: SLEEK U.D.F. STRIKEJETS, FOUR OF THEM, streak in low. MIMICS
text: volley JAVELIN as the sleek aircraft swing in for bombing -
text: ONE STRIKEJET takes a hit and tumbles, FLAMING, the PILOT
text: SCREAMING as he spins, PLOWING INTO the MIMIC FRONT LINE...
text: .-. but then the OTHER STRIKEJETS deliver their payloads.
text: KATHOOM! A WALL OF FLAME goes up, the ground SHAKING from the
scene_heading: impact. SMOKING, TWITCHING FRAGMENTS of MIMIC RAIN DOWN -
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE (RADIO)
scene_heading: CLEAR FOR CLOSE ENGAGEMENT.
text: WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! THREE BIG, JACKETED SOLDIERS land, SMOOTHLY
text: ROLLING into 3-point fighting position. This is DOG COMPANY.
text: DOG COMPANY SOLDIERS are different. Their exojackets are
text: blackened, dented, tricked out with graffiti, decals from the
text: countries they've fought in. Their grim faces are scarred.
text: Not a one of them stands under 6'4".
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE (RADIO) (CONT'D)
dialog: Eat ‘em up, boys.
text: The Dogs' MASSIVE SHOULDER ROCKETS OPEN FIRE, 20mm, 50mm
text: cannons nailing MIMICS right and left -
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Holy shit!
text: CAGE'S EYES GO WIDE and the WORLD GOES SLOW as -
scene_heading: SERGEANT-MAJOR RITA VRATASKI
text: AKA "VALKYRIE ONE", AKA "THE FULL METAL BITCH", LEAPS, flying
scene_heading: RIGHT OVER CAGE AND YONABURU'S HEADS -
text: Her sleek exojacket is painted BLOOD RED. It's bare of
text: weaponry except for - her TUNGSTEN CARBIDE BATTLE AXE. Almost
text: comically HUGE, nearly as big and certainly as heavy as she
dialog: is. Good for one thing: BISECTING MIMICS.
text: The axe SWINGS and four MIMICS are converted to eight
text: TWITCHING HEAPS. She rolls into a PERFECT BATTLE STANCE.
text: Her face; beautiful, battle-ready, and deadly calm -
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Take me to your leader.
text: - and with a collective YELL, the rest of DOG COMPANY follow
text: her STRAIGHT INTO THE MIMIC FRONT LINE. Yonaburu JUMPS UP -
speaker_heading: YONABURU
text: It's RITA! THE FULL METAL BITCH!
dialog: Come on, man, we gotta -
text: But Cage is running across the sand. DESERTING.
speaker_heading: YONABURU (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: CAGE!
text: Worse yet, TWO MIMIC RUNNERS have detached and GIVE CHASE.
text: YONABURU FIRES, taking one down, but the other is closing in -
text: He looks back, to where RITA and the DOGS mercilessly engage
text: the mimic in a ballet of precision fighting. He'd join, but -
speaker_heading: YONABURU (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuck.
text: Yonaburu takes off after Cage as -
text: - Cage BLINDLY HAULS ASS for the SEA CLIFFS, scrambling up a
text: rocky bluff. Yonaburu catches up -
speaker_heading: YONABURU (CONT'D)
dialog: We have to get back to the unit!
text: - and GRABS Cage's leg. Cage KICKS, FLAILING -
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: We won't make it! They're all DEAD!
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: They shoot deserters!
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I don't care! LET ME GO!
text: Cage CRAWLS, DRAGGING YONABURU to the CREST OF THE CLIFF.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: CAGE, I'M NOT LETTING YOU -
text: Yonaburu stands, HEAVING BACK on CAGE'S LEG, and -—
text: SHUP! HALF OF YONABURU'S head disappears in a shattering of
text: red, the broken shell of his faceplate smoking.
speaker_heading: CAGE
speaker_heading: YONABURU !
text: Yonaburu's jacket twitches, shudders, goes limp - and falls.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: NO!
text: Cage tries to stand, but Yonaburu's hand is still gripping
text: his ankle. He twists, scrambling up -
text: CAGE SEES WHAT SHOT YONABURU.
text: The cliff's crest is a NEST OF MIMIC SCOUTS. SEVEN of them.
text: Only a little less surprised than Cage.
text: Before he knows what he's doing, he's got TARGET-LOCK. Cage
text: FIRES BLINDLY, the shock of his forearm cannon SPINNING him
text: around in an arc -
text: TAKTAKTAKTAKTAK! SEVERAL MIMICS GO DOWN, Cage FALLS on his
text: ASS, just missing the swings of BLADED MIMIC ARMS -
text: - and he's STILL FIRING, into MIMIC LEGS, WHIPPING them down
dialog: to the ground. No one has ever fought worse - or been as
text: lucky - as Cage at this moment. In 2.3 seconds, SIX DEAD
text: MIMIC lie twitching around him. Cage SCOOTS back, seeing -
text: - THE LAST MIMIC on the rise, getting ready to FIRE.
text: He SHOOTS it. But with a CHITTERING, BUZZING NOISE, a FRESHLY
text: BIRTHED JAVELIN erupts from its dying body like a 400 mph
text: tumor and HITS Cage's side. CAGE FIRES AGAIN, just as -
text: - a SECOND javelin hits his FACEPLATE, it SHATTERS, the WORLD
text: SPINS, ARCS and Cage goes down, BLACKING OUT -
scene_heading: EXT. BATTLEFIELD - HOURS LATER
text: The LATE-AFTERNOON SUN streaks through TORN CLOUDS. SMOKE
text: rises from the SCORCHED EARTH and BODIES of men, aliens, and
text: machines litter the terrain for miles. A landscape of hell.
text: Cage COUGHS, OPENS HIS EYES.
text: He's lying on his back, RAIN drizzling on his unprotected
text: face, his BLOOD mixing in the puddles beside him. YONABURU'S
text: BODY and the DEAD MIMIC SCOUTS are scattered around.
text: A LIVING MIMIC is nearby, scavenging through the dead, eating
text: bits of other fallen mimic. It hasn't noticed Cage, until -
text: CLICKING and WHIRRING, YONABURU'S EXOJACKET goes into power-
text: down, releasing him like an insect's carapace. His dead,
text: naked-except-for-underwear BODY slops into the mud and blood.
text: The eater of the dead LOOKS UP. Interested. ANOTHER MIMIC
text: stands behind it. Oh fuck. Here they come.
text: CAGE STRUGGLES to lift his 20mm, CLICK. CLICK. Nothing. The
scene_heading: MIMICS RUN THIS WAY. CLICK. CLICK. Cage SCREAMS -
text: - SHUP! The mimic's body is TORN IN HALF - A FLASH of RED
text: EXOJACKET as THE SECOND IS CUT DOWN. We barely see it happen.
text: Just pieces of mimic falling, and in two seconds it's over.
text: Cage blinks up at... RITA VRATASKI.
dialog: 10.
text: Her crimson exojacket shines in the afternoon sun. Her gore-
text: spattered faceplate hovers over Cage, then RETRACTS as she
text: grabs a canteen from her utility belt.
dialog: Rita may be the greatest warrior on the planet, but she can't
text: be more than 23 years old. And she's beautiful.
text: Storm clouds part, BLUE SKY beyond, but rain still drizzles.
text: She drinks, looking up at the sky.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: When I grew up in Pennsylvania,
dialog: they had a name for this.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: For... what?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: For when it's raining, but the sun
text: is shining.
text: Rita lifts Cage's head, giving him some water.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: They said it was because the devil
text: was beating his wife.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Who comes up with this crap?
text: Cage trembles, COUGHS, blood sputters out.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Am I... gonna make it?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: No. I don't think so. But I'll stay
dialog: with you until you die.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: You don't have to... thank you, I -
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I need your battery. It's fresh.
dialog: Looks like you hardly used it.
text: This sinks in.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: Take it.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: You sure about that?
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I don't deserve it.
text: Rita gently pushes Cage over, unhooking something on his
text: back. Cage grimaces in pain. He shivers, bloody, crying.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: I... I don't want to die.
text: Rita looks at him, a trace of painful softness in her face.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Dying's not that bad, once you get
dialog: used to it.
text: Distant EXPLOSIONS, moving closer. Rita grabs her axe, her
text: jacket whining up to full power, her radio CRACKLES to life.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: I have to go. Good luck, soldier.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Fuck... off...
text: Rita smiles, then heads off to the CLIFF'S EDGE, surveying
text: the Armageddon in progress far below.
text: Cage's jacket goes into power-down, unhooking from his body.
text: With the last of his strength, he CRAWLS to Yonaburu's side.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: (delirious)
dialog: Yonaburu... I'm sorry... I...
text: Yonaburu's one intact eye stares at him, blind and dead.
scene_heading: SPLISH. SPLASH. Cage FREEZES.
text: A MIMIC FOOT quietly steps into the mud by Cage's head. It's
text: standing right over him. This one is ODD, its armor plates
text: and vesicles diffracting light in a OILY RAINBOW OF COLOR.
text: It LEANS IN CLOSE, SCANNING HIM. Cage TREMBLES, helpless.
text: The thing's face is a HORRIBLE MAW - up close, it's no more a
text: functional face than a black widow spider's hourglass is a
text: functional timepiece. A decorative WARNING to human prey.
text: Detecting no threat from Cage, the mimic shifts focus to -
text: - RITA'S BACK. She's 20 yards away, too distracted by the
dialog: battle to notice, as -
dialog: 12.
text: The mimic begins to VIBRATE, TINY BLACK TENDRILS exude from
text: every crevice of its armor, waving in the breeze. A FRESH
text: JAVELIN forming in the center of its body, WHIRRING...
text: And that's when Cage sees MRS. SMITH, Yonaburu's antique
scene_heading: SMITH & WESSON, GLINTING IN THE MUD -
text: Cage GRABS the pistol, aims right up into the belly of the
text: mimic, SHUTS his eyes and SQUEEZES THE TRIGGER - BLAM!
text: Now a mimic could usually take a .357 slug and shrug it off,
text: but Cage got it RIGHT BETWEEN THE PLATES. With a hellish
text: SQUEAL, the mimic STAGGERS, the developing JAVELIN MISFIRES,
text: TEARING a hunk of the mimic's body with it -
text: - Cage fires AGAIN. And AGAIN. INNARDS SPILL -
text: SILVER-BLACK TENDRILS like melted plastic, CRACKLING with
text: electrical charge, DRIZZLE ONTO CAGE'S BODY, at 600 degrees.
text: CAGE SCREAMS as it BURNS INTO HIM. There are probably worse
dialog: deaths, but this one ranks way up there. It's HORRIBLE -
text: - Cage's DEATH-SCREAM scales register, the sound going flat
text: and weird, squelching out like a bad RADIO SIGNAL as -
text: - the IMAGE SHUDDERS, FALLING APART, winking out like an old
text: tube TV, a high pitched WHINE, a BUZZ and -
scene_heading: INT. C-COMPANY BARRACKS - MONDAY MORNING
text: - CAGE SITS UP, SCREAMING, slapping at his chest like he's
text: trying to put out a fire.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: AIGH! HELP! GET IT OFF ME!
text: He ROLLS off his bunk, FALLING to the floor, TEARING at his
text: undershirt, revealing - HIS SKIN, perfectly intact, beneath.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: What the fuck is wrong with you?
text: YONABURU sits in his undershirt, cleaning MRS. SMITH, staring
text: at Cage like he's crazy.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I was... it was... you were...
text: Cage stares around like a trapped animal.
text: SOLDIERS, the men and women we saw on the dropship, scattered
text: around the barracks in various states of undress, stare back.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: I, uh, I must have, uh... fallen
text: asleep. Had a nightmare.
scene_heading: GUY CAT-CALL
dialog: Didja piss yerself?
speaker_heading: GIRL CAT-CALL
dialog: Check his diaper!
text: There's a RECRUITMENT POSTER on Cage's wall: RITA VRATASKI,
text: her crimson exojacket shining against blue sky, hair flying,
text: a stern look on her face: "I WANT YOU! JOIN THE CLEANUP!"
text: But someone - Cage, in fact - has defaced the poster to read
text: "JOIN THE FUCK-UP, SUCKERS!" Little skulls around her feet.
text: NANCE, a tough-looking GIRL SOLDIER, burly as hell, leers in.
speaker_heading: NANCE
dialog: Maybe it was a wet dream. Maybe he
dialog: was dreamin' about Rita.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Shut up, Nance.
text: She blows him a kiss. Cage rubs his head, in mild shock.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ow... GOD my head is killing me. I
dialog: cannot drink like that anymore.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Like last night.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: We were here last night, dumbass.
dialog: Liquor raid's tonight. Battle's
dialog: tomorrow.
text: Cage blinks, confused.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Oh. I... Right. I gotta, I think I
dialog: gotta go puke.
scene_heading: INT. LATRINES - DAY
text: Cage washes his face, taking two aspirin, hands shaking. He
text: looks in the mirror, trying to get a grip on himself -
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: It was just a dream.
scene_heading: INT. C-COMPANY BARRACKS - DAY
text: Cage walks back to his bunk in a daze, staring at the faces
text: of the SOLDIERS he just watched get killed; some playing
text: video games, some looking at porn, some working out, some
text: asleep, half-dangling out of Mylar hammocks.
text: - there's DAVIS, who didn't make it out of the DROPSHIP -
text: - there's ROKER, who took a JAVELIN in the chest -
text: - and YONABURU, hunkering over a map that looks like football
text: strategy. PALKA, a short Norwegian, tosses him WIRE CLIPPERS.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Mission accomplished?
speaker_heading: PALKA
dialog: We have our exfiltration point.
text: Palka circles a spot on the map.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Excellent. We'll strike at 2200.
dialog: Griff, you're gonna be the decoy -
speaker_heading: GRIFF
dialog: You think they got tequila?
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: ‘Course they do. They're officers.
dialog: They got everything.
speaker_heading: PALKA
dialog: Going to get DRUUNK...
text: Yonaburu rolls up the map, hiding it. Cage frowns, worried.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Man, you ever feel like you're
dialog: remembering something while it's
dialog: happening, like it's already -
dialog: (distracted)
dialog: Hey, Ford! Can you not do that?
text: SEVERAL SOLDIERS are GAMBLING between the bunks, heaps of
text: goodies behind the WINNER, the LOSER throwing down his cards.
text: The dealer, FORD, scoops chips, smiling. He was missing teeth
dialog: in the dropship... now he's not.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Do what?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Sarge busted our asses ALL DAY
dialog: yesterday in PT! You wanna put
dialog: everyone through that again?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: What're you talking about? Sarge's
dialog: out all week gettin' his arm sewed
dialog: back on! Besides, we got a lookout -
text: - indicating a FAT SOLDIER, KIMMEL, up near the door, whose
text: attention is evenly divided between a HANDHELD VIDEO GAME and
text: HIS NOSE, which he is picking mightily.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Dude, he came RIGHT through that
dialog: door, and —
text: SLAP! SOMEONE SLAPS KIMMEL on the back of his head, sending
text: his game skittering across the floor. Cage's eyes go WIDE.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Oh. Fuck.
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: Now just what in the got-damned
dialog: fucking shit do we have here?
text: SGT. FARELL is a living piece of leather; badly scarred, mean

speaker_heading: SGT. FARELL (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm gone for SIX WHOLE DAYS and my
text: platoon, the platoon with MY good
text: name on it, has TRANSMOGRIFIED into
text: a veritable SHITSTORM of SHENANIGAN
text: and INIQUITY! I. AM. APPALLED!
text: Farell punctuates everything he says with VIOLENCE; a well-
text: aimed KICK, a SLAP, a tipped-over FOOTLOCKER, as the soldiers
text: FALL OVER EACH OTHER to come to ATTENTION -
speaker_heading: SGT. FARELL (CONT'D)
dialog: You are ALL. IN. DEEPEST. SHIT.
scene_heading: PIG. SHIT. YOU. MOTHERLESS. BABIES!
text: SLAP! KICK! No one escapes his reach.

speaker_heading: SGT. FARELL (CONT'D)
dialog: And you will NOT. GET. OUT of this
dialog: pigshit until you have EACH. AND.
dialog: EVERY. ONE learned the life-giving

speaker_heading: SGT. FARELL (CONT'D)
dialog: DID you not think I would return?
dialog: DID you not imagine that I would be
text: wholly prepared to CASTRATE and
dialog: MASTECTOMIZE each and every -
text: Sgt. Farell stops short, seeing the GAMBLERS, who stand at
text: attention... but their cards, chips are scattered everywhere.
text: His face curls into a whole new level of acid rage.
speaker_heading: SGT. FARELL (CONT'D)
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Oh. I see I've interrupted a game.
text: A few GAMBLERS close their eyes, ready for certain death.
speaker_heading: SGT. FARELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Tell me, Private Ford. Why do I
dialog: hate gambling so much?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: (trembling as he recites)
dialog: Sir, because it's a game of chance,
dialog: sir... because it entertains the
dialog: notion that our... fate is in
dialog: hands... other than our own... sir.
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: And what do I think about chance?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: (reciting)
dialog: "There is no chance. There is only
dialog: choice. And choice is character.
dialog: And character is fate."
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: That's RIGHT!
dialog: 17.
text: He SLAPS Ford anyway, for good measure. Silence. Farell scans
text: the terrified soldiers in hateful wonder.
text: His voice drops to an almost tender register, as if he pities
dialog: these poor pukes for the choices they have made this morning.
speaker_heading: SGT. FARELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Now I know that none of you exactly
dialog: CHOSE to be here. I know that all
dialog: the young ladies and gentlemen FIT
dialog: for the International Marine Forces
dialog: have long since been decimated by
dialog: the MIMIC DISEASE, and that no
dialog: sooner have you conscripts
dialog: completed the most RUDIMENTARY

speaker_heading: Mother of all Battles: RUBY
speaker_heading: TUESDAY.
dialog: (softly)
dialog: We lost North America. We lost the

speaker_heading: SOLDIER!
speaker_heading: SOLDIER

scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: NO I DO NOT CARE. PT NOW NOW NOW!
text: The soldiers HUSTLE OUT. Cage stares, STUNNED, as we CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. UNITED DEFENSE FORCES BASE - DAY
text: A GLASSY TOWER looms above a SPRAWLING MILITARY BASE on a
text: BAY. The base is the size of a city, but it's only part of
dialog: what will be the largest military operation in human history.
speaker_heading: YONABURU (0.S.)
dialog: It's called 'deja vu', man, which
dialog: is French for been there, done
dialog: that. Happens to everyone.
text: FAR BELOW, the soldiers of C-Company run in loose formation.
dialog: 18.
scene_heading: EXT. PHYSICAL TRAINING FIELD - OBSTACLE COURSE - DAY
text: FOREIGN BATTALIONS arrive, train -
scene_heading: CHINESE REGIMENTS MARCH.
scene_heading: RUSSIAN SOLDIERS BARK ORDERS.
scene_heading: JAPANESE COMMANDOS SPAR IN EXOJACKETS.
text: Cage looks around the field, sweating, dazed.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Dude, I knew everything he was
dialog: gonna say. Every word.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: EVERYONE knew what Sarge was gonna
dialog: say! He always says that shit.
text: C-COMPANY soldiers RUN, past JEERING COMPANIES of better
text: behaved soldiers who aren't getting PT'ed to death.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I swear... this is different. It's
dialog: like... I'm remembering things that
dialog: haven't even happened yet.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Fine. You had a dream, we were in
dialog: battle, and everyone died. Only the
dialog: Valkyrie saved you - and then you
dialog: died.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: And the Sarge busting our asses out
dialog: here, that was in your dream, too.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Yeah... I think it was.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: OK then, Mr. Wizard. Tell me what
text: happens next.
text: Cage looks around the field, straining to remember.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Uhh... Kimmel's gonna pass out.
dialog: 19.
text: The fat Private STRUGGLES over an easy OBSTACLE, FARELL
text: SCREAMING at him until... Kimmel FAINTS. MEDICS rush over.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Well I coulda' seen that coming.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Yeah? Well, now... Nance and Ford
dialog: over there, they're about to get in
dialog: this big-ass fight...
text: NANCE and FORD power over a wall, Nance taking the
text: opportunity to GRAB Ford's ass. He KICKS her, they FALL IN
text: THE MUD. It's ON.
text: SGT. FARELL starts yelling, SOLDIERS start running over,
dialog: egging them on -
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: ...and then Roker over there makes
dialog: a perfect shot...
text: ROKER hits three BULLS-EYES, HOOTS. Yonaburu frowns, spooked.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
text: ...-and then Davis gets his leg
text: stuck in the ropes...
text: DAVIS swings over a rope obstacle, slips and ends up swinging
text: upside down, his leg tangled.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: ...and then Ford has to go to the
text: infirmary after Nance busts his -
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: (scared)
dialog: Shut UP, man, yer freakin' me out!
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: That's what I'm saying! Ford gets
text: his teeth knocked out and then...
text: Cage trails off, seeing that RITA has walked onto the field,
text: trailed by her Dogs.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell?
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Holy fuck. It's Valkyrie One!
text: Out of her jacket, Rita looks nothing like the amazon warrior
dialog: you might expect. She's small. Delicate-looking.
dialog: 20.
text: Out of their jackets, the DOGS are, if anything, more
text: menacing than on the field; muscled, tatted, scarred. They
text: swagger in loose formation around Rita, true to their name.
speaker_heading: GRIFF
dialog: (walking up)
dialog: Damn. Looks like someone let the
text: Full Metal Bitch outta her tower.
text: Cage stares, bewildered. Soldiers gathered around the fight
text: COME TO ATTENTION as RITA steps through -
text: - and INTO THE FIGHT, where FORD swings at NANCE, missing,
text: leaving himself wide open. Nance SWINGS, her FIST coming in
text: SLOW MOTION, Ford's eyes WIDE, his nose: DOOMED -—
text: - but RITA INTERCEPTS THE SHOT, catching Nance's fist with an
text: audible SMACK. Ford staggers back. Everything STOPS.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: How about you two save this for the
dialog: battle?
text: FORD muddily salutes. So does NANCE. So does SGT. FARELL.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: Why are these soldiers in PT the
dialog: day before battle, Sergeant?
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: 3rd Platoon has a discipline
dialog: problem, ma'am. I felt that a
dialog: little physical exertion might help
dialog: them grasp this important military
dialog: concept.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I see.
text: With a nod from Rita, one of the Dogs HITS THE DIRT, assuming
text: a board-like position: the ISO-PUSHUP.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: Lt. Shep is demonstrating the iso-
dialog: pushup. In Dog Company, we use it
dialog: to practice discipline. The iso-
dialog: pushup is the best training outside
dialog: of a jacket you will get.
speaker_heading: NOW
text: The whole PLATOON is in a PERFECT LINE, in a position that
dialog: could pass for torture; the ISO-PUSHUP. Not going up, not
text: going down - just holding position.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: To control your exojackets you must
dialog: control your body. To control your
dialog: body, you must control your mind.
text: SWEAT drips from soldiers' noses. It's hardest for the
text: biggest ones. Yonaburu TREMBLES - and COLLAPSES.
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
text: GET BACK INTO POSITION, PRIVATE!
text: Yonaburu struggles to get back up. Cage can't take his eyes
text: off Rita. Rita suddenly LOOKS THIS WAY. Shit. Here she comes.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: This man's had enough.
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
text: Yonaburu gets up. The lolling DOG SOLDIERS smirk. Rita DROPS,
text: assuming Yonaburu's place, next to Cage. Cage tries to keep
text: his eyes on the ground, but finally, he looks -
text: Sergeant-Major Rita Vrataski is looking Cage dead in the eye.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Do I have something on my face,
dialog: Private?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Uh... No, ma'am.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Then I suggest you keep your eyes
text: on the ground.
text: Cage looks down, sweat dripping. OTHER SOLDIERS DROP, one by
text: one. Rita holds the position effortlessly. Cage is shaking.
text: He finally DROPS.
text: OVER BY THE WATER COOLERS
text: Cage GUZZLES, watching Rita, now the only one doing an iso-
text: pushup, her DOGS cheering her on.
text: Yonaburu SLAPS Cage on the back -
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Damn. What'd she SAY to you, man?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Nothing, I -
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: You really had me going there for a
dialog: minute. I mean, you didn't dream
dialog: about any of that, Rita comin' over
dialog: and her talkin' to you 'n stuff...
dialog: did you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: No. That wasn't... that's not what
dialog: happened at all.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Good. I was starting to think you
dialog: were crazy.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: (troubled)
dialog: Yeah. Me too.
scene_heading: INT. BATTLE READINESS DEBRIEFING THEATER - DARKNESS
text: UP FRONT, nervous-looking EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, pencil-pushers,
text: point to vidscreens, where MIMICS and BATTLE PLANS hover -
text: FLAGS showing armies of EVERY NATIONALITY cruise in towards
text: the YUCATAN PENINSULA, while the island of CUBA - all of the
text: Caribbean, in fact - is SWARMED with GLOWING RED LINES that
text: extend halfway around the globe; MIMIC FORCES.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE OFFICER
text: The mimic are amassing on the
dialog: island of Cuba, preparing for an
text: all-out strike on the continent.
text: When they reach a critical mass,
dialog: they will attack.
text: ON THE VIDSCREENS, whole CONTINENTS have been wiped clean of
text: human influence; NORTH AMERICA is gone, ANTARCTICA is gone.
text: Areas of CANADA appear to be DISEASED...
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CONT'D)
dialog: That's why we're striking them
dialog: first. If we wait, we could lose
dialog: South America. So this is what you'd
dialog: call a, uh, critical juncture.
text: IN BACK, soldiers from Cage's platoon pay limited attention.
text: They're working on their own plans: tonight's liquor raid.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: You're still coming with us, right?
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I don't know, maybe -
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Come on, man, it's ritual. C-
text: Company ALWAYS gets drunk before
dialog: they go into battle!
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: We've never been in a battle.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: But that's how rituals get STARTED,
text: wuss. We're in on the GROUND FLOOR.
text: Cage can't exactly argue with this logic. As the meeting
text: adjourns, Farell WAYLAYS them all at the door.
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: 3rd Platoon, HOLD!
text: Farell gives them all the bad-eye.
speaker_heading: SGT. FARELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, Command doesn't let me ride
dialog: your sorry asses past 1900 hours.
dialog: But if any of you maggots have the
dialog: spine and mettle to meet me in the
dialog: sparring bay, I can offer in-jacket
dialog: training.
text: The soldiers guiltily file past. Not one takes him up on it.
scene_heading: EXT. LIQUOR RAID - BEHIND THE OFFICER'S CLUB - NIGHT
text: ONE SOLDIER hands bottles of LIQUOR under the edge of the
text: Mylar tenting while OTHERS keep a lookout. A CURIOUS MP
text: shines his flashlight on the fence -
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: (hissing)
dialog: Go! GO!
text: But when the curious MP gets there he sees -
text: NOTHING BUT EMPTY GRASS behind the club. We pan ALONG the
text: fence, to where the last of the soldiers slip through the
dialog: HOLE that Palka made this morning -
dialog: 24.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
text: DRUNK SOLDIERS run around in the breakers, hooting and
text: laughing, total grab-ass. SEARCHLIGHTS span the beach nearby.
speaker_heading: ROKER
dialog: No, no no no no man, LOOK. I
dialog: totally watched the whole thing -
dialog: it's gonna be a cakewalk.
text: SOLDIERS gather around, soaking wet and getting wasted.
text: ROKER, with drunken authority, DRAWS A MAP THE SAND -
speaker_heading: ROKER (CONT'D)
dialog: This is first division. This is
dialog: 2nd, 84th - all the fuck of ‘em.
dialog: They're all over. WE...
dialog: (drawing)
dialog: ».+.are gonna be right down here.
dialog: Bringin' up the rear.
dialog: 
text: Maybe he uses a broken seashell to demark a spot, or a beer
text: bottle. One of the soldiers is totally naked, no explanation.
speaker_heading: DAVIS
dialog: Bringin' up the rear. That's funny.
speaker_heading: ROKER
dialog: It's a fuckin' CAKEWALK, man. We
dialog: drew the lucky straw!
speaker_heading: DAVIS
dialog: It's cos they know how bad we suck.
speaker_heading: ROKER
dialog: Same difference.
text: Two soldiers try some version of a high-five, and FALL on
text: their asses. SURF washes in, destroying the battlefield.
text: CAGE sits off by himself, staring out at the breakers.
text: Yonaburu staggers over, sits.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: You're not still thinking about all
dialog: that deja-bullshit are you?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Nah. Not really.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Good.
text: Yonaburu offers cage a BOTTLE. Cage hesitates, DRINKS.
dialog: 25.
text: IN THE DISTANCE, we see the RED FLASHES of artillery. Low
text: THUMPS echo across the water. BOMBING raids on the island.
scene_heading: INT. GLOOMY BARRACKS - NIGHT
text: The soldiers of 3rd Platoon creep back into their barracks.
text: O.S. The sound of someone PUKING. Yonaburu is clutching a
text: worn photo, too drunk to walk. Cage helps him to his bunk.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: .--when this battle's over, I'm
dialog: gonna get my gold star and we're
dialog: gonna have like fifteen fuckin'
dialog: kids and live off of the Breedin'
dialog: Credits...
text: Yonaburu collapses into bed, dropping the picture. Cage picks
dialog: it up. A sorta-pretty girl. "I love you, Danny-boy".
speaker_heading: YONABURU (CONT'D)
dialog: Ain't she pretty?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Yeah, man, now get some sleep.
text: Cage crawls up onto his rack. Lays there, staring at the
text: poster of Rita in the gloom.
speaker_heading: YONABURU (0.S.)
dialog: Hey, Cage?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: In that dream you had, about the
dialog: battle... you uh, never said
dialog: exactly what happened to me.
speaker_heading: BEAT.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I... uh, think you got away.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Uh... Yeah.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Cool. Well I won't let the mimics
dialog: get you this time, man. I swear.
dialog: 26.
text: Cage stares into the darkness, worried, and we CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. UNITED DEFENCE FORCES BASE - 5 AM - RUBY TUESDAY
text: ALARMS BLEAT, RADIOS ECHO across the base, and everywhere,
text: STREAMS of SOLDIERS, millions of them, run to their
text: deployments like ants.
text: DROPSHIPS lift off in formation, HOVERCRAFT and MEGACARRIERS
text: steam out of the bay, WAVES of STRIKEJETS BOOM THROUGH THE
text: SOUND BARRIER, whisking off, faster than can be followed.
scene_heading: INT. ARMORY - RUBY TUESDAY
text: ROWS of EXOJACKETS line the walls as SOLDIERS pound in. Every
text: exojacket is custom fit, a soldier's name emblazoned on each.
text: SOME SOLDIERS look really excited to get in their jackets,
text: SOME look at theirs like they're iron maidens. Soldiers STRIP
text: to their underwear; exojackets need full body contact.
text: GRIFF even strips off his underwear, OTHER SOLDIERS wince.
speaker_heading: NANCE
dialog: Aw Griff no one wants to see that!
speaker_heading: GRIFF
dialog: I gotta feel free, man!
text: Yonaburu's jacket CLICKS into place around his body, sealing
text: his arm down to his fingertips. Exojackets are stronger than
text: steel, and microjointed for maximum mobility.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Woooh, LORDY! Welcome to the
dialog: Plastic Fantastic Death Machine!
text: He KNOCKS his polycarbonate arm, THUK-THUK, for good measure.
text: KIMMEL struggles to wedge into his jacket, having managed to
dialog: gain another 13 pounds since his fitting.
speaker_heading: KIMMEL
dialog: Can someone, uh...
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Suck in.
text: Yonaburu and ANOTHER SOLDIER push... With a GROAN, Kimmel
text: fairly POPS into his suit as it POWERS UP, encasing him.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: GRIFF
dialog: (looking up)
speaker_heading: OH FUUCK.
text: CAGE steps around the corner. His jacket FESTOONED with extra
text: AMMO, GRENADES, and so many GUNS that he can barely walk.
text: Soldiers LAUGH as we PUSH IN on Cage's ANXIOUS FACE.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. UNITED DEFENSE FORCES DROPSHIP - IN FLIGHT
text: CAGE looking, if anything, more terrified than before, DOWN
text: BETWEEN HIS FEET as the BAY DOORS RETRACT, revealing -
text: - CHOPPY SEAWATER flying by below. Cage SWALLOWS HARD. ACROSS
text: FROM CAGE, Griff is twitching, trying not to barf -
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: GRIFF, DON'T PUKE!
speaker_heading: GRIFF
speaker_heading: SIR yes SIR!
speaker_heading: NANCE
dialog: You spit up your jacket, yer in for

speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: You shit in your jacket, yer in for

text: Ford GRINS. This time, he's still got all his teeth.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Yo buddy, check it out. We got
dialog: nothin' to worry about. I brought
dialog: us life insurance. Mrs. Smith.
text: Yonaburu taps MRS. SMITH against his faceplate. Cage's lip
text: begins to twitch. He squeezes his eyes shut.
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
scene_heading: .+.+READY FOR DROP... HOLDING, AND -—
text: CAGE DOESN'T WAIT. He hits his RELEASE, and DROPS.
scene_heading: EXT. AIR - 9.8 METERS PER SECOND SQUARED
text: CAGE'S HYPERVENTILATING GASPS. YONABURU tumbles after -
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
text: WHOO-HOO! DAMN, BUD, WAIT UP!
text: Cage LOOKS UP in time to see the dropship TAKE TWO HITS,
text: FLAMING SOLDIERS falling as the ship begins its death-spiral.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACHHEAD - BATTLEFIELD - FOGGY DAY
text: - WHAM! BEAT. A GASP as Cage's lungs refill, he staggers up,
text: wobbly, WET SAND falling from his face-plate -
speaker_heading: HAPPY SOLDIER
dialog: WE MADE IT!
text: THREE OTHER soldiers stagger up out of their own craters -
speaker_heading: CAGE
text: HEY! LOOK OUT! LOOK OUT!
text: Cage WAVES HIS ARMS frantically, which gives the doomed
dialog: soldiers exactly enough time to LOOK UP before -
text: - 20 TONS OF FLAMING DROPSHIP CRASH DOWN on them. Cage is
text: THROWN BACK from the impact, landing in two feet of surf.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: CAGE! YOU IN ONE PIECE?
text: Cage nods, dazed. They RUN.
text: EVERYTHING is exactly like it was before, with one major
text: difference: instead of drizzling rain, there's a THICK FOG.
text: CAGE AND YONABURU MAKE IT TO THE TRENCH, falling in with
text: other terrified soldiers, FARELL screaming to TAC-COM -
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL (ON RADIO)
dialog: I NEED SOME GODDAMN AIR SUPPORT!
text: GRIFF trembles, gripping his autocannon -
speaker_heading: GRIFF
dialog: This isn't... It's like they
dialog: fuckin' knew, man... it's like
dialog: they KNEW!
text: ON CAGE'S HEADS-UP, a RED DOT approaches the BLUE DOTS of his
text: company. Then MORE RED DOTS. EVEN MORE THAN LAST TIME.
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL (ON RADIO)
dialog: LOCK AND LOAD!
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: We have to get out of here!
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: LIGHT 'EM UP!
text: ROKER jumps up, ready to FIRE, when a MIMIC JAVELIN hits him
text: square in the chest, knocking him back -
text: YONABURU stares down at the dead man, in shock, and sees -
scene_heading: - CAGE, ALREADY RUNNING AWAY.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: SHIT!
text: Sgt. Farell SNARLS, lowers his 30mm cannon at Cage's BACK.
speaker_heading: YONABURU (CONT'D)
dialog: WAIT! I'll get him back, sir!
text: BLAM! A BLAST of FLAME and SAND as a mimic JAVELIN lands in
text: the TRENCH. Maybe Farell is dead, but there's no time to look
scene_heading: back. YONABURU RUNS AFTER CAGE -
scene_heading: CAGE RUNS BLINDLY -
text: - YONABURU TACKLES HIM and they GO DOWN, ROLLING. Cage
text: WRIGGLES FREE, crawls away.
text: YONABURU GRABS his ankle, MIMIC JAVELIN streaking past -
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: LET ME GO!
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: I'M NOT LETTING YOU GO!
text: Yonaburu HEAVES CAGE BACK by the ankle - JUST LIKE BEFORE.
speaker_heading: CAGE SEES
text: TWO MIMIC JAVELIN streaking in -
speaker_heading: CAGE
speaker_heading: YONABURU !
text: - Cage TWISTS, KICKING YONABURU and KNOCKING him out of the
speaker_heading: LINE of FIRE -
text: - a javelin NEATLY MISSING Yonaburu's head.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Why the FUCK'D YOU DO THAT?
dialog: 30.
text: Cage stares in wonder - SMILES.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I DID IT! I SAVED YoU!
text: LAUGHING, like he broke a CURSE. But then Cage COUGHS.
text: Something DARK spatters the inside of his faceplate.
text: Yonaburu's expression turns to one of horror.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Oh buddy. Oh man.
text: Yonaburu stares at Cage's chest. Cage looks down -
text: THERE'S A 90MM HOLE CLEAN THROUGH HIS CHESTPLATE. Took out
text: enough spine that he didn't feel anything.
speaker_heading: YONABURU (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh god, I'm sorry, man, I'm really -
text: Cage looks BACK AT THE TRENCHES where the rest of the platoon
text: are getting HAMBURGERED in the FOG -
text: - and the distant flash of RED where RITA and the DOGS fight
text: a SEA OF MIMIC TWO-LEGGERS. Cage's jacket starts to TWIST and
dialog: shake, it's gonna JITTERBUG -
text: And then YONABURU'S whole head DISAPPEARS IN A PUFF OF RED -
text: The image SWIMS, the sound FUTZING like a lost HAM RADIO
scene_heading: TRANSMISSION as Cage BLEEDS OUT, DYING -
text: - the weird static rising to a BUZZY ROAR until we CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BARRACKS - MONDAY MORNING
text: CAGE WAKES UP ON his BUNK, COUGHING AND HACKING AND GASPING,
text: falling out of bed with a YELL. Everyone STARES.
text: Yonaburu scowls up from cleaning Mrs. Smith.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: What the fuck is wrong with you?
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Didja piss yerself?
text: Cage stares around the barracks like a trapped animal.
speaker_heading: CAGE

speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. LATRINES - MORNING

speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: .--and then, then I ran, I couldn't
dialog: help it. I just had to, there
dialog: wasn't... You don't know what it's
dialog: like. There's gonna be thousands, I
dialog: mean, hundreds of thousands of ‘em.
dialog: (wiping his nose)
dialog: And anyway, I did save you, for
text: like a second. For just a second.
dialog: MAN, my fuckin' head hurts.
text: Cage messily shakes out some aspirin, chewing several.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: I know it sounds crazy, but you
dialog: gotta believe me. We have to get
dialog: out of here or it's...
text: Yonaburu looks at Cage with a mixture of pity and disgust.
text: His friend has totally cracked.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. SICK BAY - DAY

speaker_heading: GRANDPA!

speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: Pretty!
dialog: 35.
text: The little girl POINTS. Cage FROWNS.
text: The water at the girl's feet is covered in an iridescent,
text: sickly SHEEN. A DEAD fish rolls in the oily surf. Cage

dialog: Hey, what are you -—
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I'm really sorry, buddy.

scene_heading: INT. BARRACKS - MORNING
text: Cage opens his eyes. He doesn't move for a long time, just

speaker_heading: CAGE (V.O.)
dialog: I was only three years old when the
dialog: mimic first got here.

speaker_heading: CAGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: They'd probably started heading

speaker_heading: CAGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Then one day, they just dropped.

scene_heading: EXT. ANTARCTIC ISLAND - DAY

dialog: attacked them, the better they got.
text: NEW KINDS of MIMIC INFANTRY pour out of holes in the earth,

speaker_heading: CAGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

scene_heading: DOCTORS in a lab DISSECT a MIMIC TWO-LEGGER -

scene_heading: EXT. DISEASED EARTH - DAY

scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: You asked some pretty good

speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I'm not really a good soldier, sir.

speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Sarge, what if you were going into

dialog: with one hundred percent certainty?
text: Farell thinks on this, taking the question seriously.
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: Then I wouldn't be afraid.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That's what it takes to be a great
dialog: soldier. Realize your doom and get

dialog: die a hero.
text: Farell rubs his jaw, looking up at Cage's exojacket.
speaker_heading: SGT. FARELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Come to think of it, Private, that

speaker_heading: SGT. FARELL (CONT'D)
dialog: You meet me in the sparring bay if

dialog: Forget about the jacket.

speaker_heading: SGT. FARELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Forget about me.

scene_heading: jacket STRAINS, firing "STREAKERS": AUGMENTED-REALITY -

speaker_heading: SGT. FARELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Use your instincts and the jacket
dialog: will help you. Don't think about it
dialog: too much. Don't fight the jacket.
text: EVERYWHERE that Cage fires is milliseconds too late. And the

speaker_heading: SGT. FARELL (CONT'D)
dialog: When you forget that you're wearing

dialog: soldier and the jacket are one, the
dialog: mimic cannot defeat you.
text: Cage gives it all he's got, FINALLY landing a blow - WHACK!
speaker_heading: SGT. FARELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Good.
text: And then Farell HAMMERS CAGE, KNOCKING HIM CLEAN OFF HIS
text: FEET, jumping, landing on him, pinning his arms back and
text: putting the barrel of his 50mm in Cage's face.
speaker_heading: SGT. FARELL (CONT'D)
dialog: You're green, but you've got more
dialog: mettle than you think you do.
text: Farell rolls off of him, smiling.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: SGT. FARELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Now. You wanna try that again?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: WHAM!
scene_heading: INT. DROPSHIP - DAY
text: The dropship bay doors OPEN, the OCEAN far below. Cage's
text: jacketed hand is shaking. GRIFF making about-to-puke-face.
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: GRIFF! DON'T PUKE!
speaker_heading: GRIFF
dialog: YES SIR!
text: UP FRONT, Farell gives them all a grim look. When his eyes
text: meet Cage, he gives him the tiniest nod of reassurance.
text: BENEATH, the BEACH comes into view... and the DROP POINT.
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
text: ...READY FOR DROP... HOLDING...
dialog: HOLDING... GO!
scene_heading: Soldiers DROP. YONABURU. NANCE. FORD. GRIFF. CAGE turns to a
text: TERRIFIED SOLDIER - maybe KIMMEL - who clings for his life -
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: LET GO!
text: He shakes his head. Cage SHOVES him, forcing him out, the guy
text: drops, SCREAMING. Cage THROWS ANOTHER, GRABS a THIRD just as —
text: THE DROPSHIP TAKES THE HIT, AND THEY'RE OUT, TUMBLING and -
scene_heading: EXT. BEACHHEAD - DAY
text: CAGE LANDS on the beach, WHAM! Several other soldiers stagger
text: up out of their craters. A happy soldier waves -
speaker_heading: HAPPY SOLDIER
dialog: WE MADE IT!
text: Cage TACKLES the SOLDIER, barely knocking him out of harm's
text: way as the DROPSHIP SMASHES DOWN - at least he saved one.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: SHIT, CAGE - YOU OK?
dialog: 49.
text: The STUNNED SOLDIER stares back at the ship, in shock -
speaker_heading: HAPPY SOLDIER
dialog: The ship... the ship...
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: COME ON!
text: They HAUL ASS across the beach. This time, it's POURING RAIN.
text: THEY ROLL INTO THE TRENCH
text: Yonaburu's heads-up is RED with mimic -
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Holy fucking fuck.
text: Cage moves past his terrified comrades to SGT. FARELL, who
text: uselessly SCREAMS ORDERS to his RADIO -
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
scene_heading: WELL, TAC-COM GOT IT FUCKIN' WRONG!
dialog: We need some GODDAMN AIR SUPPORT!
speaker_heading: CAGE
text: MIMIC ARE GONNA OVERRUN THIS TRENCH
text: IN TEN SECONDS! WE HAVE TO MOVE, SIR!
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
text: JUST WHERE THE HELL DO YOU SUGGEST -
speaker_heading: CAGE
text: THERE'S A CANYON, ONE CLICK WEST!
text: A split-second BEAT. Sgt. Farell believes him.
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: Right! MOVE! MOVE!
text: THE SOLDIERS MAKE IT OUT just as the trench is REDUCED TO
scene_heading: RUIN by JAVELIN FIRE -
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: (to Yonaburu)
dialog: STAY WITH ME!
dialog: The soldiers RUN for the CANYON as -
scene_heading: SEVERAL MIMIC RUNNERS detach and GIVE CHASE. Cage TURNS,
text: LEVELS his 20mm, BLAM! A MIMIC GOES DOWN! FOLLOWING HIS LEAD -
text: - TWO OTHER SOLDIERS turn to FIRE on the MIMIC but are
text: OVERTAKEN. Hand to hand, the MIMIC are unstoppable, the TWO
scene_heading: SOLDIERS are CUT DOWN as -
dialog: 50.
text: WHAM! A MIMIC RUNS RIGHT INTO CAGE, KNOCKING HIM SIDEWAYS,
scene_heading: JAVELIN BLOOMING ACROSS ITS BODY, ARMS SHARP AS RAZORS. CAGE
text: ROLLS, TWISTS and as it LEAPS -
text: He RAMS his PILEDRIVER in the mimic's CRAW - KERWHAM! The
text: mimic DIES, javelin fizzling like dud fireworks.
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL (ON RADIO)
dialog: GOOD WORK, PRIVATE!
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: YEAH!
text: Yonaburu FIRES his 50mm, KICKING back like a 10 year old
text: firing his first shotgun: BLAM! BLAM! Not too accurate, but
scene_heading: MIGHTY EFFECTIVE -
speaker_heading: CAGE
speaker_heading: C'MON, MAN!
text: CAGE grabs YONABURU's shoulder and they run until -
text: - STRIKEJETS ROAR in, laying down a WALL OF FLAME, close
text: enough that CAGE AND YONABURU are KNOCKED FLAT, DIRT in the
text: SKY, MIMIC PIECES FALLING, it's hard to tell up from down -
text: CAGE staggers up, but YONABURU TOOK A PIECE OF SHRAPNEL.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: HOLD ON!
text: Cage GRABS Yonaburu's FOOT, DRAGGING HIM as FRESH MIMIC clear
text: the OILY SMOKE, Cage FIRING with his one FREE ARM —
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: I'm bleedin' out, man... Let me go.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: NO!
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: I... I'm sorry I called you a dick.
dialog: (fading)
dialog: You're my best... friend...
text: Distracted, Cage doesn't see the MIMIC BARRELING at him -
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Just hold on, man, I can get you -
dialog: - a sickening CRUNCH and we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 51.
scene_heading: INT. BARRACKS - MORNING
text: Cage wakes up on his bunk. Yonaburu is cleaning Mrs. Smith.
text: Cage's bare feet hit the concrete floor.
text: He stands there, smiling at Yonaburu.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: (frowning)
dialog: What the fuck is wrong with you?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Nothing, man.
text: Still smiling, Cage writes a "6" on his hand with a sharpie.
speaker_heading: CAGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: The Sarge was right. If there
dialog: wasn't any way out of this, maybe I
dialog: could at least go down fighting. So
dialog: what if there were a million of
dialog: them and only one of me. Maybe I
dialog: had a million tries.
text: KIMMEL'S FACE, intent on his video game. Two blocky, old-
text: skool STREET FIGHTERS square off. One EATS the other's LIVER.
speaker_heading: CAGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe I could win this thing after
dialog: all.
text: GAME OVER. RESTART. Cage peers down at the game -
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: You're getting pretty good at that,
dialog: Kimmel. How many times would you
dialog: Say you've played that game?
speaker_heading: KIMMEL
dialog: I dunno. Couple thousand? I been
dialog: able to beat it for a while - I'm
dialog: just trying to top my own score.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Heads up, buddy, Sarge is coming.
speaker_heading: KIMMEL
dialog: Huh?
text: Cage steps up on his footlocker, addressing the room.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Hey everyone, I just thought you
dialog: should all know that Sgt.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Farell got out of rehab early. He's

speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Bullshit.
text: KIMMEL spies the Sarge, COMING DOWN THE HALL -
speaker_heading: KIMMEL
dialog: Guys! Guys! The Sarge is coming!
text: SOLDIERS respond like a bomb went off, flying into action,

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - BARRACKS
text: SGT. FARELL MARCHES DOWN THE HALL as if he knows in his heart

scene_heading: SGT. FARELL, SIR!
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL

speaker_heading: CAGE
text: SOME OF THE MEN WERE HOPING TO

dialog: Let me pass, private.
text: Cage tries to waylay him again, Farell PUSHES past him and

scene_heading: INT. BARRACKS - MORNING
text: - A SHOCKINGLY CLEAN quarters. SOLDIERS stand at attention.
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: Now just what in the got-damned -
text: The Sergeant is totally brought up short. Cage steps in
text: behind him and... begins to SING.
speaker_heading: CAGE (SINGING)
dialog: Fooooor he's a jolly good fellow,
dialog: for he's a jolly good fellow, for
dialog: he's a jolly good feee-ee-loooo-
speaker_heading: (MORE )

speaker_heading: CAGE (SINGING) (CONT'D)
dialog: (wait for it)
text: Who came back with both his arms.
text: A weak improvised cheer goes up. Farell frowns.
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: Well. I'll be damned. I'd heard a
dialog: rumor this platoon'd fallen to the
dialog: forces of Chaos.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don't usually take such pleasure
dialog: in being wrong.
text: He scans the place, inspecting, still suspicious.
speaker_heading: SGT. FARELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Right. We'll be reviewing Mimic
text: Killzone Tactics on the field at
dialog: 0900. Get yer breakfast. You, HOLD.
text: Indicating Cage. Soldiers bustle out. Farell GLARES at Cage,
text: noticing that Cage has a "6" written on the back of his hand.
speaker_heading: SGT. FARELL (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't know what game you're
dialog: playing, Private... "Cage". But if
dialog: you fuck with me, I will kill you.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Sir, yes sir.
scene_heading: INT. MESS HALL - MORNING
text: CRAPPY BREAKFAST FOOD hits metal trays. METACOFFEE splutters

speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: What-all do they put in this shit?
speaker_heading: GRIFF
text: Everything an exploding body needs.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: (to Cage)
dialog: Dude, you TOTALLY saved our ASSES
dialog: back there. Sarge woulda killed us!
dialog: They SIT, eyeing -
text: RITA, at a corner table, flanked by her DOGS, who sit around,
text: not eating, looking bored.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: I don't get it. She can eat
dialog: whatever she wants but she comes in
dialog: here, like she's gonna eat with us,
text: and then she just eats by herself
dialog: and doesn't even let anyone look at
dialog: her. Not even her Dogs.
speaker_heading: GRIFF
dialog: That's why they call her the Full
dialog: Metal Bitch, man. She's mean.
text: One of Dog Company notices them looking, gives their table
text: the bad-eye while cleaning his fingernails with a dagger.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: I heard she screws ‘em. ALL.
speaker_heading: GRIFF
dialog: Naw, man, they're all homos. So she
dialog: won't screw ‘em.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: You guys ever give it a rest?
speaker_heading: DAVIS
dialog: She thinks she's better than us.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: She is better than us.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: I thought you hated her! You're
dialog: always talking about how much you
dialog: hate all her hero bullshit. “Join
dialog: the fuck-up, suckers".
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: She's still the best.
text: Cage eats, thinking.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: You think one person could change a

speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: I dunno, man. Maybe if that person
dialog: were Rita.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: What about me?
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Dude, you couldn't hit a barn if we
dialog: dropped it on you.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Yeah, but - what if I got a million
dialog: tries? Like on Kimmel's video game?
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Mmmaaybe. Could you also, like,
dialog: shoot laser beams out of your eyes
dialog: or teleport or something?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I'm being serious.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: I know you're being serious. That's
dialog: what's so frickin' funny.
text: Rita stands, eyes ahead, and exits, the Dogs trailing.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: How long do you think it would take

speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: I dunno, three, four lifetimes?
text: Cage smiles and we CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SPARRING BAY - NIGHT
text: Cage ROLLS, EVADING TRACER FIRE, taking HITS. Tracers aren't
text: real, but when they hit, exojackets give a SHOCK - OW!
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: What are you afraid of? A little
dialog: sting? That ain't nothing!
text: WHAM! WHAM! Cage is fast, but Farell is faster and FEARLESS -
text: LEAPING off walls, FLIPPING, SHOOTING, raining HELL on Cage.
speaker_heading: SGT. FARELL (CONT'D)
dialog: You think the mimic's afraid of
dialog: death? I seen a mimic eat its own
dialog: battle-buddy. I've seen a mimic
text: throw itself into a dropship ramjet
dialog: just to bring the thing down. It
dialog: did not hesitate. There was no
dialog: decision, only action.
dialog: 56.
text: Cage SWINGS his PILEDRIVER and we slip in TIME to -
scene_heading: EXT. BEACHHEAD - RUBY TUESDAY - LATE MORNING
text: - Cage's PILEDRIVER OBLITERATES A MIMIC as he PUSHES the
text: PLATOON farther up the canyon, SOLDIERS SCREAMING while he

scene_heading: - NINE MIMICS DIE, B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-BLAM!
speaker_heading: YONABURU
text: DAMN, SON, THAT'S SOME SHOOTIN'!
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: MOVE OUT!
text: Cage FIRES, turning, seeing MORE MIMIC LEAP off the CANYON
text: RIM, one LANDING ON YONABURU and TEARING HIM TO SHREDS -
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: GET IT OFF ME! AIGGH!
text: With a SCREAM, Cage LEAPS, FIRING DOWN BETWEEN HIS FEET -
scene_heading: INT. SPARRING BAY - NIGHT
text: - ALMOST LANDING ON FARELL, but Farell ROLLS, FIRES BACK, but
text: Cage is BETTER NOW - HACKING DOWN with his 20mm, his TRACER
scene_heading: ROUNDS HAMMERING FARELL'S ARMOR -
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: You gotta fight with more than pea-
dialog: shooters if you wanna WIN -
text: - Farell THROWS his repeater cannon aside and LEAPS, engaging
text: Cage HAND TO HAND, TOO CLOSE for any of his weapons to work.
text: They're PUNCHING, KICKING, Cage taking the worst of it,
text: dizzy, STAGGERING back like a boxer up against the ropes.
speaker_heading: SGT. FARELL (CONT'D)
dialog: WHY ARE YOU HERE, PRIVATE?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: BECAUSE I WANT TO BE THE BEST, SIR!
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: Then FIGHT, DAMN YOU!
text: Farell is RELENTLESS, BEATING THE HELL OUT OF CAGE -
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: SGT. FARELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Recognize your weakness and DO
dialog: SOMETHING ABOUT IT!
text: - until Cage YELLS, FIGHTING BACK, RAINING BLOWS ON -
scene_heading: EXT. RUBY TUESDAY - ROCKY SEA CLIFFS
text: - the THICK HIDE OF A MIMIC, its sharp limbs moving FAST AS
text: BUZZ SAWS as it LEAPS on him again, Cage BARELY deflecting,
text: then HITTING BACK, landing BLOW AFTER BLOW and -
text: KICKING the MIMIC into a TWITCHING HEAP. Cage gets up,
text: SWEATING, a little BLOOD inside his faceplate, BARELY ABLE to
text: STAND after his first real hand to hand with a mimic.
text: Soldiers CHEER.
speaker_heading: ROKER (ON RADIO)
text: WOO-HOO! That's some FIGHTIN'!
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Where'd you learn that shit?
text: Cage crouches, looks up at the SUN, high in the sky.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: What time you got?
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: 11:45. Why you keep asking me what
dialog: fuckin' time it is?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Just wanna see how far I can get.
dialog: Yonaburu FROWNS, is going to ask more... but here come MORE
scene_heading: MIMICS, DRIVEN by RITA.
text: Cage WATCHES HER FIGHT.
text: It's as if Rita can't kill mimics fast enough. While her AXE
text: is cutting one in half, she's twisting another mimic around,
text: forcing it to FIRE into one of its MATES -
text: Cage FOLLOWS, watching. But then RITA notices his follow.
speaker_heading: RITA (ON RADIO)
dialog: You ought to keep your distance,
dialog: private. You might get hurt.
text: She CROUCHES, LEAPS off, moving faster than Cage can possibly
text: follow. The DOGS go after her. A STRIKEJET SORTIE coming in -—
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: We gotta get out of here, man.
dialog: Sarge wants us to —
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Yeah, just a - YONABURU! LOOK OUT!
text: - a STRIKEJET SPINS OUT OF CONTROL, GRAPPLED with a MIMIC,
text: and CRASH-LANDS ON YONABURU with an EXPLOSION and we CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RUBY TUESDAY - LAGOON BATTLE
text: Soldiers cross a SWAMPY AREA between CRAGGY CLIFFS. Cage
text: WADES after RITA, watching her FIGHT -
speaker_heading: GRIFF (RADIO)
text: SECTOR FOUR IS CLEAR.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: What time we got?
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: 12:45. Man, why the hell do you
dialog: keep asking me what - AIGH!
text: An AQUATIC MIMIC comes OUT OF THE WATER, this one with JAWS
text: in its TORSO. It BITES Yonaburu in HALF -
speaker_heading: CAGE
speaker_heading: YONABURU !
dialog: Cage FIRES and we CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RUBY TUESDAY - MOUNTAIN BATTLE
text: On STEEP MOUNTAIN FACE, where CAGE can see RITA, BELOW,
text: dispatching MIMIC by the dozen.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Man how does she MOVE like that?
speaker_heading: YONABURU
speaker_heading: SHHHH.
text: Yonaburu POINTS. ABOVE THEM, SEVERAL MIMIC watch the battle.
text: Yonaburu carefully takes a GRENADE, pulls the PIN, THROWS it.
text: They HUG to the cliff face, CROUCHING...
text: .--but the grenade ROLLS BACK DOWN, coming to rest right
text: under YONABURU'S ASS. He doesn't see it.
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: CAGE
scene_heading: YOBO! LOOK OU -
scene_heading: INT. MESS HALL - MONDAY MORNING
text: SPLUT! Some NASTY-looking stew hits a cafeteria tray.
text: Cage is in line with everyone else. Unlike everyone else,
text: he's piling food of every imaginable variety on his plate.
dialog: Adding salt, sugar, spices. Anything to break the monotony.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Goddamn, man. That's disgusting.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Well, Yobo, you gotta keep life
dialog: interesting.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Yobo? What's that?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Just a name I've got going for you.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Dude don't call me that. It's
dialog: weird.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I'm gonna call you that.
dialog: (to the kitchen girl)
dialog: Mind if I borrow your pen?
speaker_heading: KITCHEN GIRL
dialog: Sure.
text: Cage writes "93 - KIA 2:32" on his hand. Yonaburu frowns.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Man, you're acting really weird
dialog: today.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: You don't know the half of it.
text: Rita walks by, head down, in perfect slow-motion.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: I don't get it. She can eat
dialog: whatever she wants but she comes in
dialog: here, like she's gonna -
text: Watching her, distracted, Cage COLLIDES with one of the DOGS.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: HEELER
dialog: Private, you don't even LOOK at
dialog: Sergeant-Major Vrataski.
text: Yonaburu's eyes go wide. Heeler PUSHES Cage.
text: Cage PUSHES back. The mess hall goes still.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Right.
text: Cage SWINGS his tray. He's pretty fast. Maybe if he were in
dialog: an exojacket he might stand a chance against these guys, but
text: he weighs half as much as any one of them.
text: THEY'RE ALL OVER HIM, Cage gets in one last good punch and
text: then Heeler swings, the fist CONNECTS and we CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOLOVID BAY - NIGHT
text: A SLOW-MOTION EXPLOSION. RITA steps through the smoke,
text: looking insanely awesome, in an EARLIER EDITION of her
text: crimson exojacket. The image FAST-FORWARDS...
text: CAGE stands in the holobay, intently studying Rita's moves.
text: He switches out holodisks and -
text: ANOTHER IMAGE of Rita at the end of a battle, exhausted.
text: A CAMERAMAN pushes a camera in her face as she's drinking,
text: she HURLS the bottle at the CAMERA, the image WINKING OUT.
text: Cage shuttles back, to the frame before she hurls the bottle -
text: Cage freezes that frame.
text: Rita is beautiful. And in that one frame, she looks like the
dialog: loneliest person in the whole world.
text: Cage walks around the LIFESIZE HOLOGRAM, looking at her
text: closely. He studies her melancholy face. She's frozen,
text: standing in front of him like a translucent ghost...
text: Their faces almost touching.
text: But she's just a holovid image.
text: Cage gestures, the image moves out of STILL, into MOTION -
text: - Rita's holovid bottle FLIES at Cage's face and we
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
dialog: 61.
scene_heading: INT. SPARRING BAY - NIGHT
text: FARELL LANDS a punch, Cage barely feels it, twisting and
text: fending Farell off with one hand. Farell finally KICKS him,
text: sending him flying. Cage lies on his back, frowning.
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: You... had enough?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: How do you think she got so good?
text: Farell stands over Cage, bent over, out of breath.
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Valkyrie One. The Full Metal... Rita.
text: Farell sits on a bench, easing off his faceplate. He pulls
text: two apples out of his jacket. Hands Cage one, eats.
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: You've seen her fight?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Yeah, I, uh... watch old warvids.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: No one can move as fast as her. I
dialog: don't know how she does it.
text: Farell eats his apple, thinking.
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
text: Prob'ly turns off her autobalancer.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: What's that?
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: Have you signed your infirmary
dialog: release? Organ donation forms? Next
dialog: of kin notices?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Uh... yeah.
text: NOW Farell tweaks with the back of Cage's jacket. READOUTS on
text: the faceplate FLICKER as Farell hacks into the system -
dialog: 62.
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: On the island of Okinawa, when the
dialog: farmers were under the tyranny of
dialog: the Samurai, they founded Karate on
dialog: one simple principal: that the
dialog: force of a blow was not in the
dialog: muscle behind it but in the mind
dialog: that could... let go of the body.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Every muscle in the human body has
dialog: a kind of control on it - something
dialog: that tells it not to push too far,
dialog: too fast. Keeps your body from
text: tearing itself apart.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: When the Okinawans learned to let
dialog: go of this control, they found that
dialog: a human fist could puncture Samurai
dialog: armor. And not suffer a scratch.
text: He pulls out a chip, shuts a port. The suit momentarily
text: WILTS. Then powers back up.
speaker_heading: SGT. FARELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Jackets have the same kind of
dialog: control on ‘em. Without it, if
dialog: you're not careful, you could tear
dialog: yourself to shreds just by tryin'
dialog: to run too fast.
text: The faceplate readout flashes WARNING: AUTOBALANCER DISABLED.
speaker_heading: SGT. FARELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Take a step. Easy. Easy.
text: Cage STEPS, BOUNCING, clumsy. Spring-loaded.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: This is pretty cool.
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: Now take a swing at that target,
dialog: but I want you to -
text: WHAM! Cage STRIKES the METAL, PYLON-SHAPED TARGET -
text: - and sends himself FLYING across the room in the process,
text: landing in a HEAP. OW. Farell grins.
speaker_heading: SGT. FARELL (CONT'D)
dialog: I didn't turn off the pain
dialog: feedback. Just to keep things fair.
text: When Cage gets up, he looks, the target is GONE -
dialog: 63.
text: - because it's CRUMPLED AROUND HIS FIST. A twisted fragment
text: falls to the floor.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Wow.
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: You wouldn't want to use this on
dialog: the field of battle. It's against
dialog: regulation. Someone could get hurt.
dialog: Farell WINKS and we CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN - RUBY TUESDAY
text: CAGE is DECIMATING MIMICS, twice as fast and twice as strong
text: as he was before. He fights so fast and hard that it's a
text: spectacle; soldiers WATCH, stunned.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: ALL CLEAR! MOVE OUT!
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: DAMN, where'd you learn to do that?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I've been doing a lot of reading.
dialog: What time you got?
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: (frowning)
dialog: 3:15.
text: Cage DISPATCHES a straggler MIMIC. Leading the men up, out of
text: the CANYON. As they near the crest of the hill -
dialog: - it's started SNOWING.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: For instance, did you know that the
dialog: weather is totally unpredictable?
text: They say a butterfly flapping its
dialog: wings in Australia can make enough
dialog: of a difference that, on the other
dialog: side of the world a month later,
dialog: there might be a hurricane, all
dialog: because of whether or not that
dialog: butterfly was having a bad day.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: What does that have to do with
dialog: anything?
dialog: 64.
text: Cage looks up at the sky, watching flakes of snow fall.
speaker_heading: CAGE

speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Of course it's always different.
dialog: That's, like, the whole idea of
dialog: weather.
text: They get to a CLIFF. Visibility is low.
text: Cage motions to several GROUPS of soldiers, who all creep
text: into position. He's organizing an AMBUSH.
text: Cage SCANS the field below, his heads-up BINOCULAR-STYLE -
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Now the mimic will be gathering
dialog: right...
text: Cage FROWNS. The vale below them is EMPTY.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: That's weird.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER (ON RADIO)
dialog: WE GOT... WE GOT A PROBLEM BACK
speaker_heading: HERE -
text: A soldier comes BARRELING through the SNOW, HYSTERICAL.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER (CONT'D)
dialog: It's... IT'S A TRAP! They knew we'd
dialog: be here! They were waiting for us!
text: The soldier EXPLODES, a JAVELIN in his back.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: That's impossible, it's -
text: - MIMIC close in from behind. YONABURU TAKES A HIT and FALLS
speaker_heading: off the CLIFF FACE -
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Caaaaaaage!
dialog: (thump )
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Dammit.
text: CAGE FIGHTS BACK WITH ALL HE'S GOT, a one-man army, pushing
text: the mimic ambush back down the hill, but -
dialog: 65.
scene_heading: TAK TAK SPT SPT SPT -
text: His AUTOCANNON runs out of AMMO. So does his REPEATER RIFLE -
text: - a FRESH SWARM OF MIMICS head this way, and -
text: Cage JUMPS onto the turret of a HALF-EXPLODED TANK, KICKING
text: mimic away, TEARING off the main cannon and using it as a
text: BLUDGEON, WHANG! WHANG! WHANG!
text: He CLEANS UP on the six MIMICS, the last one running in a
text: circle like a dying cockroach. He hits it again. It's DEAD.
text: Cage looks at the twisted piece of metal in his hand.
text: An IDEA.
text: The smoke and blowing snow clears, and a GIGANTIC MIMIC
text: stomps into view, towering least 30 FEET TALL.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: What the -
text: It SWINGS a huge arm DOWN, all goes BLACK and we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DISPENSARY - DAY

speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I need an B93 external memory unit
dialog: for a Beyer-Michelson exojacket.
scene_heading: DISPENSARY CAPTAIN
dialog: I don't think we have -
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Back there, on the fifth shelf, up
dialog: top. There's some that aren't in
dialog: your system -
text: Frowning, the guy goes and looks. Sure enough -
scene_heading: DISPENSARY CAPTAIN
dialog: Yeah, but these aren't for -
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I have the requisition orders here.
dialog: 66.
text: Cage slides papers across like he's done this 20 times,
text: smiling evenly at the Captain. The guy scans, frowning.
scene_heading: DISPENSARY CAPTAIN
dialog: You're a Chief Engineer?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Yep.
scene_heading: DISPENSARY CAPTAIN
dialog: What are you going to use it for?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: That's classified.
text: Cage SIGNS. The Captain notices the number "187" written on
text: the back of Cage's hand, frowns. Cage takes the Mylar baggie.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks, Roy.
scene_heading: EXT. UDF FORCES BASE - DRIZZLING RAIN - VARIOUS
text: Cage walks, keeping his head down in the light drizzle.
text: RITA'S GLASS TOWER looms over the base like a shining needle.
text: What happens next is a SYMPHONY OF MOVEMENT AND SYNCHRONY.
speaker_heading: CAGE (V.O.)
dialog: Sarge always said there was no such
dialog: thing as chance, as luck. I still
dialog: didn't believe him. Lots of things
dialog: didn't seem to follow any pattern.
dialog: The weather, for instance. But other
dialog: things - it was weird just how
dialog: predictable some things could be.
text: Cage walks across the base like the proverbial Rabbi walking
text: between the raindrops. He knows EVERY MOVEMENT of each person
text: on this base swarming with busy people rushing to and fro.
text: We flip in and out of SLOW MOTION as -
text: - a GUARD turns and looks at a piece of paper blowing across
dialog: the road -
text: - CAGE STEPS IN FRONT OF HIM, just out of line of vision,
text: neatly CROSSING THROUGH A CHECKPOINT and -
text: - STEPPING ONTO THE BACK OF A MOVING TRUCK like you'd catch a
text: carousel horse. It cruises, slows, the driver SHOUTING at
text: SOMEONE for just long enough for Cage to STEP OFF the truck -
dialog: 67.
text: - and right behind a GUARD, who he shadows, RIGHT behind him,
text: and then splits off, down an alley -
text: - past a GUY and GIRL soldier illegally NECKING -
text: - and now skirting the base of Rita's TOWER, where several of
text: DOG COMPANY hang out at the base, telling jokes -
speaker_heading: CAGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I'd tried to get through them twenty
dialog: times before I realized I didn't
dialog: have to get through them at all.

scene_heading: INT. ENGINEERS BAY - DAY
text: RITA's CRIMSON EXOJACKET stands in the middle of a large
text: WORKROOM, looking mighty, except for the LEG, which is OPEN,
text: pieces strewn out on the floor.
text: SHASTA RILEY, Rita's pigtailed, overalled, Coke-bottle-
text: glasses-wearing CHIEF ENGINEER, pores over the machinery.
text: Shasta is so frustrated over whatever she's looking at that
text: she doesn't realize Cage is STANDING RIGHT OVER HER.
dialog: Cage winces, this part is always hard to get right -
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Uh... hi there -
text: Shasta STARTLES, jerking up so fast that her glasses fall off
text: her face. Cage catches them before they hit the floor.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Whups - there you go.
text: He hands them back. Shasta looks at him, eyes big as saucers.
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: How'd you get in here? This is...
dialog: This is a classified area...
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: SHASTA (CONT'D)
dialog: only people with appropriate
dialog: security clearance are allowed in -
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I know. I just wanted a chance to
text: meet the real Shasta Riley. Chief
dialog: Engineer for Valkyrie One.
text: Shasta does another double-take. She smooths out a pigtail -
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: (blushing)
dialog: Oh. I'm actually, uh, really behind
dialog: today, I uh -
text: Cage peers in at the exposed machinery -
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Hm. Looks like the external memory
dialog: unit's been damaged on that thing -
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: Yeah, I'm trying to - how'd you
dialog: know that?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Just guessing. You know... that is
dialog: so weird, because I just happen to
dialog: have one on me.
text: Cage produces the plastic Mylar baggie. Shasta stares.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Yep. That guy at the armory? The
dialog: weird bald one who is always
dialog: hitting on you and makes you fill
dialog: out extra paperwork every time you
dialog: go over there so he can spend more
dialog: time totally creepin' you out?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I got it off of him.
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: Oh. Wow.
text: She looks at the dead unit she's been trying to fix -
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: If you keep trying to repair that
dialog: thing it's gonna take you all
text: afternoon. A real pain in the butt.
dialog: This could sure save you a lot of
dialog: time - and a visit to El Creepo.
dialog: 69.
text: Cage smiles, holding the bag. Shasta eyes it, desperate.
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: What do you want for it?
text: Cage points to the wall, where three DENTED BATTLE AXES hang.
text: Shasta searches the wall, Cage couldn't possibly mean -
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I want an axe. You've got extra.
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: Oh... no. You can't. I mean, that's
dialog: pure tungsten carbide monomer. It's
text: over two hundred seventy kilos.
dialog: Jackets aren't made to carry a
dialog: weapon that heavy, you'd overload
dialog: the autobalancer -
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I fight with mine off.
text: Shasta eyes Cage up and down.
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You're very unusual.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I'll take that as a compliment.
scene_heading: INT. LOCKER ROOM - RUBY TUESDAY - MORNING
text: EVERYONE is suiting up, KIMMEL getting wedged into his

text: weapon after weapon, dropping them to the floor.
text: The number 203 is written on Cage's hand.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: What the hell are you doing?
text: Cage slips on his exojacket, looking at his bare, jacketed
text: arm, flexing, admiring it.
speaker_heading: CAGE
text: Lightening up. Gettin' sleek.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: What are you s'posed to fight with?
text: A DELIVERYMAN appears with a HANDTRUCK and a BATTLE AXE -
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: This.
text: Cage leans over, picks up the battle axe and we CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN - RUBY TUESDAY - AFTERNOON
text: Using the HUGE BATTLE AXE, CAGE FIGHTS LIKE A BERSERKER,
dialog: making short work of the mimic at hand and -
text: - LEADING the platoon to the crest of a hill, HUNDREDS of
text: MIMIC below. And there's SOMETHING ELSE with them -
speaker_heading: GRIFF
dialog: Gawd-DAMN what the hell is THAT?
text: The mimic horde parts, clearing the way for SOMETHING SO BIG
text: that it takes a minute to stand upright, unfolding itself.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: (eyes narrowing)
dialog: That's a Megareaver. They bring 'em
dialog: out sometimes. They're big, but
dialog: they're slow.
text: The MEGAREAVER stands over 30' tall, and looks like a cross
text: between a MIMIC and a WALKING WARSHIP, GLINTING in the rain.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Crikey.
text: LOFTING THE AXE, Cage SCREAMS, running STRAIGHT FOR IT -
text: - the MEGAREAVER ERUPTING with javelin fire even while it's
text: raising its BLUDGEONING ARM... which SWINGS DOWN -
text: CRASH! Cage DIVING out of its way, evading javelins, LEAPING
text: onto the Megareaver's leg, CLAMBERING UP -
text: UNTIL HE'S ON THE THING'S BACK. It REACHES for him -
text: CAGE CLEFTS AN ARM OFF... the stump SPRAYING the horrible
text: blood everywhere, the blood KILLING the MIMICS it touches.
text: Then, with some persistence, Cage HACKS OFF THE HEAD.
text: With a GURGLING ROAR, the thing COLLAPSES, disgorging what
text: look like UNDEVELOPED MIMICS all over the battleground.
text: CAGE wipes his faceplate, his armor STEAMING with the things'
text: oily black blood. He LIFTS his axe, RALLYING the soldiers.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: MOVE OUT!
dialog: 71.
text: A THOUSAND SOLDIERS CHEER. From the HEADS-UP view it's
text: obvious that THEY'VE WON THIS STAGE OF THE BATTLE.

speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Yes sir, it is, sir. Give us

speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: What're you grinnin' about?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I never made it this far before.

text: READY TO ENGAGE!
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL (ON RADIO)
dialog: On your signal.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Go.
text: Cage RUNS, LEADING THE MEN straight at the MIMIC HORDE.
text: YONABURU by his side, Cage FIGHTS, deflecting shots aimed at
dialog: Yonaburu.
text: ACROSS the PLATEAU, the SUN starts streaking through the
text: clouds, even though it's STILL RAINING -
dialog: 72.
text: Cage dispatches mimics, the whole area around them clearing.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: What time you got?
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: 4:19? Damn. Would ya look at that.
text: BRIGHT sunlight all around them, but THICK RAINDROPS falling.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Yeah. Pretty cool, huh? They say
dialog: that means that the devil is...
dialog: (wincing)
dialog: Ow!
text: Cage blinks. He TWITCHES. Something's WRONG.
text: The world BLINKS OUT and BACK like a transmission getting
scene_heading: SEVERED. Cage CRINGES - STAGGERS.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: It's... OW, FUCK!
text: Cage's head. It HURTS. It's killing him.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: You OK, buddy?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Something is... ARGH!
text: Cage falls to his knees, his BATTLE-AXE clanging to the
text: ground. He TEARS off his faceplate, holding his head.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh no.
text: The IMAGE SHUDDERS, the SOUND WARBLING -
dialog: - and for a MILLISECOND Cage is -
text: BACK ON HIS BUNK IN THE BARRACKS, THRASHING -
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: (in the barracks)
dialog: What the fuck is wrong with -
dialog: Cage SPASMS again and -
text: IS BACK ON THE BATTLEFIELD - on his KNEES.
speaker_heading: YONABURU (CONT'D)
dialog: - fuck is wrong with you?
dialog: 73.
text: Cage's face is WRENCHED in pain, he's helpless as more MIMIC
text: come streaming in, taking out SOLDIERS.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I'm sorry buddy, I - ARGH!
text: Cage COLLAPSES, SPASMING, and everything goes TUNNEL-VISION
scene_heading: STYLE, BUZZING, WARBLING -
text: - WHAM! A MIMIC tackles Yonaburu, PULLING limbs off like

text: - CAGE lies on his back, helpless, dying, as the world
text: BUZZES, SHUDDERS... and WINKS OUT.
scene_heading: INT. BARRACKS - DAY
text: Cage wakes up on his bunk, holding his head. He YELLS,
text: ENRAGED, KICKING THE WALL.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: NO! NO NO NO!
text: Yonaburu scowls up.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: What the fuck is wrong with you?
text: Cage looks around the barracks, his lip twitching. A trickle
text: of BLOOD coming out of his nose. He wipes it away.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I die at 4:19. No matter what. 4:19
dialog: is when I died the first time.
text: A horrible, sad realization coming over him.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: It's just a loop. It doesn't matter
dialog: what I do.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: How could I have been so stupid? I
dialog: really thought I could win.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Are you OK, man?
text: Cage walks through the barracks, steps up on a footlocker.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Hey! Everybody listen up!
text: NO REACTION. Cage GRABS Kimmel's video game and SMASHES it on
text: the floor. Everyone stares. Cage clears his throat.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Uh, good morning. I wanted to let
dialog: you know that we're all going to
dialog: die tomorrow. Or at least, most of
dialog: us will. I definitely will.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So you should think, like really
dialog: think about how you're going to
dialog: spend this day. The more you
dialog: prepare yourself, the harder you
dialog: try to be the best soldier you can
dialog: ever be, the better you're going to
dialog: do tomorrow, and for that matter,
dialog: the better you're probably gonna
dialog: feel about whatever happens.
text: Yonaburu covers his eyes, painfully embarrassed.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry to bum everyone out, but
dialog: you gotta trust me on this one.
dialog: This is probably your last chance
dialog: to get it right.
text: EVERYONE stares at Cage like he's crazy.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, and Sergeant Farell got out of
text: rehab early. He's coming down the
dialog: hall right now.
text: EVERYONE flies into action.
scene_heading: INT. MESS HALL - DAY
text: Cage is eating by himself. The rest of the platoon sits at
text: another table, talking, glancing this way, clearly talking
dialog: about him.
text: KIMMEL steps up, looking nervous.
speaker_heading: KIMMEL
dialog: Hey. I, uh... What you said back
dialog: there meant a whole lot, man.
text: The guy who can never fit into his suit is staring at Cage
text: with a mixture of awe and adoration.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Ah... I was really just saying all
dialog: that. Probably drank too much
dialog: metacoffee.
text: Cage sips, scowling at the taste.
text: Kimmel sits, watching Cage pile all manner of
dialog: salt, syrup and whatever on the grossest pile
dialog: foods you've ever seen. It's disgusting.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Gotta keep it interesting, right?
dialog: 75.
dialog: spicy sauce,
dialog: of mixed-up
text: Cage eats. "214" is written on the back of his hand.
speaker_heading: KIMMEL
dialog: What's... that for?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: It's the number of times I've seen
dialog: you die.
dialog: (wiping his mouth)
dialog: It's OK, we all do. But you usually
dialog: don't even make it through the
dialog: drop. The main problem is that
dialog: you're too fat. They shouldn't have
dialog: let you in here. But they're out of
dialog: fit soldiers.
text: Kimmel wants to get up, but it's too late -
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't feel bad about it. That guy
dialog: Davis over there? He won't ever
dialog: make it out of the drop ship. And
text: Roker? He ends up on fire, cooked
dialog: in his own jacket. How fucked up is
dialog: that? And Ford, he always manages
dialog: to lose one of his arms. Sometimes
dialog: the left, sometimes the right. It's
dialog: the weirdest thing.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Nance, on the other hand, she just
dialog: totally freaks around the second
text: hour of battle. Starts killing
dialog: everyone around her until we have
dialog: to take her down.
speaker_heading: KIMMEL
dialog: Uh... I should probably go.
text: Cage shakes his head, smiling, drinking more metacoffee.
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: You, you usually just drown, after
dialog: you run away.
dialog: (chewing)
dialog: I don't think drowning's all that
dialog: bad, really.
text: Kimmel looks like he's gonna be sick..
speaker_heading: KIMMEL
dialog: Uh... Why are you telling me this?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Because it's the one way I've
dialog: figured to keep you from fighting
dialog: tomorrow after that speech I gave.
dialog: You're gonna get so freaked out
dialog: that you're gonna take a Section
text: Eight. The guys from the infirmary
dialog: are coming in just now. You should
dialog: get to know them.
text: And in walk the INFIRMARY GUYS. Kimmel looks.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RUBY TUESDAY - VARIOUS
scene_heading: IN THE DROPSHIP
text: Cage rides, as in the opening, but his face is grim. He OPENS
text: his faceplate, pulling out a flask of WHISKEY, DRINKING in
text: the HOWLING WIND while FARELL SCREAMS at him.
text: He offers it to the rest of the PLATOON, they shake their
text: heads, exchanging looks, and CAGE JUMPS, whiskey FLYING -
speaker_heading: IN BATTLE
text: CAGE wanders the battlefield, surrounded by the dead and
text: dying. His RADIO is going wild. He tunes it down, until all
text: is silence, replaced with sweeping, sad music - maybe a
text: string quartet version of Metallica's "NOTHING ELSE MATTERS".
speaker_heading: AT A RAVINE
text: Cage is filling a gulley full of mimics, wounding them just
text: enough so they can't climb out. He's clearly DRUNK.
text: BARRELS of fuel oil dump into the ravine. The mimics are
text: screeching to get out.
dialog: 77.
text: He lights a match to the bottle of whiskey and THROWS it,
text: face LIT UP with the HELLISH GLOW.
text: He looks TOTALLY INSANE.
text: AT A DROPSHIP LANDING SORTIE
text: Cage JUMPS from dropship to dropship, like Super Mario,
text: climbing into the sky, way out over the ocean. At the highest
dialog: one, he SWAN DIVES -
text: - DOWN, DOWN INTO THE WATER. SPLASH! He turns, drifting down,
text: looking up at the dead and dying, the WAR MACHINES and MIMICS
text: and MEN hitting the water and floating down -
text: Cage's PRESSURE METER going up and up until -
scene_heading: ON A SHARP PEAK
text: Cage RUNS at high speed, hauling a MIMIC up a hill, LEAPING -
text: - grabbing a STRIKEJET, HAULING the mimic bodily along,
text: forcing the jet into a NEEDLE SHOT: straight up, ABOVE THE
scene_heading: CLOUDS AND STORM -—
text: - AND ABOVE THE ATMOSPHERE, where he can see the BLACK EDGE
text: OF SPACE and the setting sun.
text: The mimic ICES OVER and finally EXPLODES. Cage lets go of the
text: rocket, floating in low-earth orbit. IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
text: His faceplate ices over, ALARMS going off. Cage opens his
text: faceplate, THE VOID RUSHES IN, AND WE
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BATTLEFIELD - RUBY TUESDAY
text: BLAM! A little VIDEO-GAME FIGHTER EXPLODES in a comically
scene_heading: violent way. GAME OVER. YOUR SCORE IS 943,943,925. RESTART -
text: Cage wanders the field of battle, playing KIMMEL'S HAND-HELD
text: VIDEO GAME, paying little attention to the battle at hand.
text: Whenever a mimic comes near, Cage DISPATCHES it without even
text: looking up from the game.
text: FINALLY one manages to make him drop the game, Cage gets
text: ANGRY. He throws himself into a HORDE of mimics.
text: CAGE is a DEATH DEALER, killing without purpose, rhyme or
text: reason, standing on a GROWING PILE of dead mimic, but MORE
dialog: and MORE COME, he'll be buried soon, when -
dialog: 78.
text: WHAM, a HUGE-ASS mimic slides into several pieces as -
text: - RITA leaps into the fray, fighting alongside Cage.
text: Cage matches her moves, swing for swing. Cage has never
dialog: fought this close to her before.
text: RITA lands, striking a pose. Her radio CRACKLES -
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: So. It's Cage, huh? Your jacket
dialog: says you're a Private. You sure
dialog: don't fight like a Private.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I play a lot of video games.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: You're pretty good.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: "Pretty good"?
text: Cage FLIES into action, killing SIX MIMIC with one complex
text: and insane ballet-like stroke, showing off for RITA.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Your one weakness is that you fight
dialog: like nothing matters. Something
dialog: always matters.
text: She demonstrates. It's like her focus is always on what's
dialog: next, like she doesn't really hate the mimic one way or
dialog: another - there is a beauty, efficiency in it.
text: Cage hammers a few mimics back. Clumsy by comparison.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I've tried to fight like you. I
dialog: can't.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Try. Don't think about what's next.
dialog: Forget about what just happened.
text: She swings, effortlessly dispatching more.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: You fight with your eyes. You've
dialog: got to fight with your heart.
text: Cage tries. The improvement is immediate. Mimic go flying as
text: they fight together. They are a perfect team.
dialog: 79.
text: Soon, Mimic litter the field. Smoke clears. Rita smiles.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: Not too bad at all, private.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Well, thanks for the lesson. But I
dialog: gotta go die now.
text: Cage turns to leave. TWO MORE MIMIC head his way -
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Private Cage, I've got a question.
text: - SLASH! SLASH! Cage FLIPS, dispatching two at once.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: How many loops is this for you?
text: Cage TURNS, STUNNED. His axe falls, clattering to the ground.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: What did you just say?
text: He stares at her, in total shock. Rita smiles.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I said how many - HEADS UP!

text: RITA VRATASKI is lying on her bed, watching the sky, the
text: horses. Rita's bed is in the middle of this wheat field.
text: She sits up, rubbing the sleep out of her eyes. Looks like
dialog: she didn't sleep too well.

dialog: Good morning, Valkyrie One.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Hey CB. What've you got for me?
text: Holstrom produces a HOLODISK. The room darkens, and now -
text: STRATEGIC MAPS of the ISLAND, the BATTLE hover around them,
text: the ocean and the base still dimly visible through the glass.
text: Holstrom debriefs Rita. HILLS and TERRAIN and MIMIC
text: CONCENTRATIONS spin and move. She takes it all in, drinking.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: Let me see the Sector Three ridge
text: display again.
text: CRAGGY PEAKS come into view, dotted with MILITARY SYMBOLS.
text: Holstrom watches Rita's face closely as she thinks.
text: She focuses, mind going somewhere else.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: They're probably going to hit the
dialog: rear divisions. Here... and here...
scene_heading: LT. HOLSTROM
dialog: TAC-COM ran the simulations and see
dialog: a low probability of a rear attack -
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Then tell them their simulations
dialog: are wrong.
dialog: (focusing)
dialog: They'1l be in the mountains. Along
dialog: this plateau. A lot of them... By
dialog: late afternoon, they...
dialog: 81.
text: She trails off, frowning.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: After that, I'm not... getting
dialog: anything else.
text: Now Holstrom frowns, worried.
speaker_heading: BEAT.
speaker_heading: HOLSTROM
dialog: Nothing? What does that mean?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I don't know. It's probably
dialog: nothing.
speaker_heading: HOLSTROM
dialog: What should I tell command?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Tell them I'm taking a walk.
speaker_heading: HOLSTROM
dialog: TAC-COM prefers it if you don't
dialog: leave the tower the day before
dialog: battle, ma'am.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I don't care what TAC-COM thinks.

speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: memory
speaker_heading: Shasta
text: CRIMSON EXOJACKET hangs, battered but battle-ready,
text: for the leg, which is MESSILY OPEN -
text: RILEY hunkers over the leg, removing the external
dialog: unit, all pigtails, overalls, Coke-bottle glasses -
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Morning, Shasta. How's it going?
text: startles, dropping her glasses.
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: OH! Hi! I, uh, we're having some
dialog: trouble with the anterior memory
dialog: unit on V9, but I'm sure I'll have
dialog: it fixed by this afternoon, if you -
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I just came to see if you wanted to
dialog: get some breakfast.
dialog: 82.
text: Shasta smiles, always rabbit-nervous, bites her lip.
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: I'd, uh, really love to, but I... I
dialog: have to get this unit fixed before
dialog: tomorrow. I knew I should have just
dialog: ordered a fresh one.
dialog: 
text: Rita wanders, looking at Shasta's messy table, finding a
text: cheap plastic figurine of... HERSELF. RITA, VALKYRIE ONE.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: Just something I got off base. I,
dialog: uh, think it's from New Taiwan.
text: Rita picks up the figurine. There's a whole playset: AXE,
scene_heading: JACKET, WEAPONRY...
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: God. The boobs are terrible! How
dialog: would I ever fit in a jacket?
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: I know. It's kinda weird. I
dialog: shouldn't have bought it.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: No. It's cool. It's funny.
text: Rita puts the figurine back on the shelf.
text: She stares up at her empty exojacket, thinking.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: I... wanted to say, that, if
dialog: anything happens tomorrow, that
dialog: you've been a great engineer. I
dialog: couldn't do what I do without you.
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: Is everything OK?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I'm just feel a little weird today.
dialog: That's all.
text: Worried, Shasta watches her go.
dialog: 83.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAINING FIELD - DAY
text: Rita walks, watching PLATOONS OF INFANTRY train. Her DOGS in
text: loose formation around her. An army photographer catches up,
text: festooned with cameras, snapping pictures -
speaker_heading: PHOTOGRAPHER
dialog: Give us a smile, Major. Come on.
dialog: Big battle tomorrow, huh? How many
dialog: mimics you think you're gonna kill?
text: But Rita's focus is elsewhere. She notices CAGE'S PLATOON
text: fucking up an obstacle course in every conceivable way.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: What are they doing?
speaker_heading: HOLSTROM
dialog: That's 3rd Platoon, 301st division.
dialog: Conscripts. Never finished basic.
dialog: They're the worst, ma'am.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Everyone gotta start somewhere.
text: AT THE OBSTACLE COURSE
text: NANCE and FORD power over a wall, Nance taking the
text: opportunity to GRAB his ass. They FALL in the mud, kicking.
speaker_heading: FORD
speaker_heading: HEY!
text: NANCE AND FORD SQUARE OFF, a throng forming -
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: BACK! OFF! NOW!
speaker_heading: NANCE
dialog: I think I'm gonna kill you, Fordy.
dialog: Right now. Front'a everyone.
text: They start SWINGING, just as -
text: - RITA pushes through the HOOTING THRONG. NANCE lands a
text: PERFECT PUNCH on FORD. He staggers, twists, and SWINGS BACK -
text: Rita goes to catch his fist, but in a microsecond, notices -
text: - CAGE standing in the throng, watching HER instead of the
text: fight. Rita hesitates... and still catches Ford's fist -
text: - but the force of his blow THROWS them both around, his fist
text: grazing her cheek just as she sends him SPRAWLING -
dialog: 84.
text: The Dogs step forward to intervene -
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Hold it, Shep.
text: Rita wipes blood off her lip. Offers her hand to Ford.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: You got a good right hook, soldier.
speaker_heading: NOW
text: The soldiers hold their ISO-PUSHUPS in a perfect line.
text: Rita walks the line of soldiers, the PHOTOGRAPHER snapping
text: pictures from a safe distance. A few of the Dogs hunker over
text: the straining soldiers, GRINNING EVILLY at their torture.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: A jacket can't protect you from a
dialog: mimic. Only your mind can. The mind
dialog: is the greatest weapon you have. In
dialog: the end, it is your only weapon.
text: One of the soldiers, CAGE, keeps staring at her. His
text: expression very serious, almost angry.
text: Beside Cage, Yonaburu COLLAPSES, struggling to get back up.
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: GET BACK UP, PRIVATE!
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: This man's had enough.
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
text: Yonaburu gets up, arms trembling. DOG SOLDIERS smirk. Rita
text: notices Cage staring up at her again.
text: She drops into a perfect iso-pushup, right next to Cage. When
text: she looks over, Cage is looking her dead in the eye.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Is there something on my face,
dialog: soldier?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: You're a very difficult person to
dialog: get to. It took me sixteen tries
dialog: before I remembered how to do this
dialog: one.
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Do I know you?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: You don't recognize me?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I've never seen you before in my
dialog: life, soldier.
text: Cage frowns. He didn't expect that.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I need to talk to you. In private.
text: Rita frowns, noticing that "329" is written on Cage's hand.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I'll make you a deal. If you can
dialog: hold the position longer than me,
dialog: you can say whatever you want.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Fine.
text: THE SUN BEATS DOWN. One by one, soldiers drop, until only
text: Cage and Rita are left.
text: Two DOG soldiers keep time, shaking their heads. They've
dialog: never seen Rita, or anyone else, hold an iso-pushup this
text: long. A CROWD of SOLDIERS gather, gawking.
text: Cage and Rita STRAIN to hold the position, sweat dripping.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: You... had enough...?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I don't... think so...
text: But Cage can't take it anymore. With a YELL, he drops. Rita's
dialog: Dogs WHOOP -
speaker_heading: SHEP
scene_heading: CALAMITY DAWG WINS! OOH RAH!
text: Rita gets up, dusts her hands off. Looks down at Cage -
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: It's too bad. Now I wanna know what
dialog: it was you had to say. But a deal's
dialog: a deal.
dialog: 86.
text: Rita turns to walk away, surrounded by her celebrating men.
text: Yonaburu comes over, helping Cage up.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Damn, that was some crazy shit,
dialog: man, I never —
text: Cage PUSHES into the throng, after Rita.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: HEY! RITA! WAIT!
text: In a millisecond, CAGE is on the dirt, two of the DOGS on top
text: of him, his wrists behind him. Cage spits dirt.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: I got an answer to your question.
text: Three hundred twenty-nine.
text: Rita turns, frowning.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Three hundred twenty-nine what?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Days since we met. Times I've died.
dialog: Times I've woken up again.
text: Rita's eyes go WIDE.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: What did you just say, private?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: You said it was... You called it
dialog: "the loop".
text: Rita STARES, dumbstruck.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Let him go.
text: EVERYONE stares. Even the Dogs look perplexed.
text: Cage gets up, dusting himself off, giving one of the
text: violent look.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Now you mind telling me just what
dialog: the hell is going on?
speaker_heading: DOGS a
dialog: 87.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAINING FIELD - BY THE WATER COOLERS - DAY
text: Yonaburu DRINKS, staring across the field, to where Cage and
text: Rita WALK, trailed at a distance by the DOGS.
speaker_heading: GRIFF
dialog: Dude. What do you think they're
dialog: talkin' about?
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: No freakin' idea.
scene_heading: EXT. BASE - AT THE FENCE - DAY
text: Rita walks in silence, face hard as stone, until they're well
text: away from the onlookers.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I guess you have a lot of
dialog: questions.
text: She looks at Cage's hand again. The numbers on it. Tears
text: begin rolling down her face.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Are you, uh... OK?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Yeah. I just thought I was the only
dialog: one it had ever happened to.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Are you... in the loop with me?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: No. I got out.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: There's a way out?
text: Rita looks out through the fence at the ocean.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: It was in the Battle of Florida.
dialog: I'd lied about my age when I joined
dialog: up. I didn't know the first thing
dialog: about being a soldier.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 88.
scene_heading: EXT. RITA'S MEMORY - VARIOUS
text: IN THE BATTLE OF FLORIDA, JACKETED INFANTRY FIGHT MIMIC BY
text: THE THOUSAND. We fly over the battle, finding -
text: - RITA'S PLATOON. She's clearly way too young to be here,
text: keeping close to her Captain, LT. ARTHUR HENDRICKS, a good-
text: looking, fatherly man in his late 30s -
speaker_heading: RITA (V.O.)
dialog: We didn't have a chance in hell,
dialog: but I was lucky, my Lieutenant was
dialog: looking out for me. He kept me
dialog: alive while everyone else in my
text: Platoon got shredded.
text: They FIGHT side by side -
text: - but then LT. HENDRICKS goes DOWN, KILLED by a mimic with an
scene_heading: ODD, RAINBOW-LIKE SHEEN -
speaker_heading: RITA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: He died, trying to save me.
dialog: I lost my head and went after the
dialog: mimic that killed him.
text: The YOUNG RITA HUNTS DOWN the MIMIC, enabled by REVENGE and
text: FURY alone. Her EXOJACKET is TORN HALF AWAY when she finally
text: KILLS the thing, using her PILEDRIVER -—
speaker_heading: RITA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I killed it. And then I died.
text: - SHE DIES, in the QUICKSILVER BLOOD of the ANTENNA MIMIC. We
text: see the image fall apart, then RITA WAKES UP -
text: IN HER BARRACKS, screaming, in her hammock. People STARE.
speaker_heading: RITA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I woke up the day before the battle
dialog: had even started. I thought I'd
dialog: gone crazy.
text: RITA wanders the barracks like a ghost -
speaker_heading: RITA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I must have died twenty times
dialog: before I pulled myself together and
dialog: decided to stand and fight.
text: ON THE BATTLEFIELD, RITA HAMMERS mimics with a REPEATER
text: RIFLE, SNARLING as she is CUT DOWN in a SPRAY OF RED -
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: RITA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: After a while, I got better.
text: We see LT. HENDRICKS die a VARIETY of DEATHS, RITA WEEPING
text: over some of them, FIGHTING through the rest.
speaker_heading: RITA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I was in four hundred eleven
dialog: battles before I figured out how to
text: break out of the loop.
text: ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE, Rita now fights with a BATTLEAXE -
text: - when she sees a RAINBOW MIMIC, the first one she killed,
text: just like the one Cage killed, streaking across the field -
text: Her eyes NARROW, she RUNS AFTER IT and we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BASE - BY THE FENCE
text: CAGE'S FACE, desperate to know -
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: The first time you died. Tell me
dialog: exactly what happened.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I'd been hit. You were there. You
dialog: took my battery. This... big mimic
text: came up. Kinda... rainbow colored.
dialog: It was going to shoot you in back.
dialog: I killed it. It bled on me. I died.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It was, uh, pretty awful.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Do you remember what it was doing,
dialog: when it... when you died?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: (frowning)
dialog: Yeah. This... stuff was coming of
dialog: it, like little wires. I've never
dialog: seen one of them do that.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: You killed an Antenna. While it was
dialog: broadcasting.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: When you killed that mimic, you got
text: tangled up in the signal. Became a
dialog: receiver. Just like I did.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I... what?
text: Rita smiles.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: It's probably easier if I show you.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOLOBAY - BATTLEVIDS
text: A SINGLE JACKETED HUMAN fights a MIMIC, we pull BACK, to a -
scene_heading: SPY-SAT AERIAL VIEW of a BATTLE in PROGRESS. THOUSANDS of
text: MIMIC flood across a field, engaging with THOUSANDS OF
text: HUMANS, but we pull FARTHER BACK -
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: You ever wonder why the mimic
dialog: almost always know where we're
dialog: going to strike next?
text: - until all that we can see are hundreds of thousands of BLUE
text: and RED DOTS converging, dissolving, repeating, almost like a
text: mathematical equation, on abstracted, 3-D terrain.
text: Rita's face is dimly illuminated in the holobay.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: Look.
text: BLUE DOTS head to a position... But RED DOTS get there first.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you see the pattern?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Let me speed it up.
text: NOW the battle scuds by at high speed, the mimics POUR onto
text: the human defense forces, like SAND settling, shifting -
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: Watch the movements.
dialog: gl.
text: And a pattern emerges: ONE SMALL CHANGE, then... EVERYTHING
text: flows in a new direction. Pulsing from RANDOM ACTION... to
scene_heading: FOCUSED ORDER.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: Now. Slow it down on that point.
text: She scuds back and forth across a SHIFT, ZOOMING in...
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: The shift happens... each time an
text: Antenna gets killed.
dialog: 
text: .--we zoom in to see a single MIMIC, getting killed by a
dialog: single SOLDIER. But at that moment, the whole mimic strategy -
text: like grains of sand at the wider zoom - abruptly SHIFTS.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
text: When an Antenna dies, it sends out
text: a message. To the receivers.
text: One RED DOT winks out. But the BLUE dot finds itself
text: surrounded... TRAPPED.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
text: But the message travels backwards.
dialog: Into the past.
text: Nine red dots CONVERGE. The blue dot is EXTINGUISHED.
text: The action REWINDS... the BLUE DOT moving back from the RED
text: DOT, until earlier, several RED DOTS move from their cohort -
text: - ALREADY HEADING FOR THE PLACE WHERE THE ANTENNA WILL DIE.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: It's a perfect strategy when you
dialog: think about it. You don't have to
dialog: outsmart an enemy if you always
dialog: know what they're going to do next.
text: Nine red dots CONVERGE. Again, the blue dot is EXTINGUISHED.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: So... when I killed the Antenna and
dialog: it bled on me... I became a
dialog: receiver? And now I'm picking up
dialog: messages from...
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: ..-yourself, thirty-six hours from
dialog: now. Like memories, but of the
dialog: future. Every possible future will
dialog: play out, until you break the loop.
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: We have to find the Antenna you
dialog: killed. The one that bled on you.
dialog: Before you killed it. Before it
dialog: sent the broadcast.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: And kill it?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: We have to get the receivers too,
dialog: or it won't work at all. But yeah.
dialog: That's the idea.
text: Cage nods, his head swimming.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: That's it? That sounds almost easy.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: It's not. They'll know we're
dialog: coming. They'll do whatever they
dialog: need to kill you every time.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: They know how important you are.
text: Cage frowns.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: If you break the loop, the mimic
dialog: won't be able to tell what happens
dialog: next.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You'll be able to win the battle.
text: Cage's eyes go wide. Rita smiles.
text: On the holovid, STREAMS and EDDIES of MIMIC overpower human
text: forces, over and over, in a constant loop...
scene_heading: EXT. BASE - NIGHT
text: The STARS are bright above, as Cage and Rita walk across the
text: base. The DOGS trail behind them, keeping their distance.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I can't believe I'm really going to
dialog: be free tomorrow.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: You'll still be in the UDF.
text: ACROSS THE ROAD, OFFICERS enjoy final drinks at the PX. Cage
text: can see the tail end of his PLATOON, sneaking around back...
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Yeah, but no more headaches, no
dialog: more loop. I'll get my life back.
text: Rita's expression goes distant.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Yeah. But I should warn you. I
dialog: think being in the loop... did
dialog: something to me. Sometimes I still
dialog: pick up... fragments. Feelings,
dialog: little things, the day before a
dialog: battle. Like I can pretty much tell
dialog: if someone's going to die.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's why I don't really talk to
dialog: anyone the day before battle.
text: They come to a crossroad; Rita's tower is one way, C-Company
dialog: barracks, the other.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: You should get your sleep. It's
dialog: going to be a pretty big day.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I was wondering - your lieutenant,
dialog: the one who helped you. Were you
dialog: ever able to save him?
text: A terrible sadness crosses Rita's face.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: No.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I think there are some people you
dialog: can't save, no matter what.
text: Rita turns and walks away.
text: From the shadows, a couple Dogs give Private Cage the last of
text: their suspicious looks and fall in line behind her.
dialog: 94.
scene_heading: INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT
text: Yonaburu is slumped on the floor, drunk. Cage stares at
text: Yonaburu, thinking about what Rita said.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Well, here he is Mr. Bigshot talking
dialog: to the Valkyrie all day. She tell
dialog: you how we're gonna win this thing?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Yeah. I think she did.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Good. Semper Fi, motherfuckers.
text: Cage helps him up, Yonaburu mumbling, clutching his
text: girlfriend's picture. It falls to the floor.
text: Cage picks it up, looks at it. Thinking. Knowing he'll be
text: free tomorrow. Knowing Yonaburu never will.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. DROPSHIP - RUBY TUESDAY
text: The dropship ROARS, STRAINING against the headwinds. DOG
text: SOLDIERS & C-COMPANY stare at each other, while OUTSIDE -
text: RITA AND CAGE CLING TO THE HULL. Rita pointing to the CLIFFS
text: teeming with MIMIC INFANTRY -
speaker_heading: RITA (RADIO)
dialog: There. Do you see ‘em? The
dialog: receivers, they're always a few
dialog: rows back. You can tell by the
dialog: movements.
text: NINE RED DOTS on Cage's heads-up converge and divide.
speaker_heading: CAGE (RADIO)
dialog: I see ‘em.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Let's go.
text: They JUMP. The DOGS follow.
scene_heading: EXT. RUBY TUESDAY - VARIOUS
text: MIMICS swarm the field, coming by LAND, SEA and AIR.
dialog: 95.
text: We slip between EXTREME CLOSE-UPS OF ACTION, of Cage and
text: Rita's faces, to WIDE STRATEGIC VIEWS of battle, RED and BLUE
text: flags dancing and spinning in the heads-ups.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: There's a receiver. Flag it.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Got it.
text: FIGHTING SOLDIERS STARE as Cage and Rita fight together,
text: mobilizing the troops, JUMPING past ranks.
text: Even Rita's DOGS can't keep up with them.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: And another. You see it?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Yeah.
text: As a team, they are UNSTOPPABLE. They complement each other
text: like perfect halves of a single fighting machine.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: You're pretty good.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: You keep saying that.
text: Their eyes meet. Smiling. They DIVE in, Cage showing off for
text: Rita. They're DRIVING the mimic back, performing moves we've
text: never seen before. It's BEAUTIFUL, watching them fight.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: There's two more.
text: Cage and Rita fight like two people in love. The CLOUDS are
text: starting to break, the SUN moving at high speed through the
text: sky as the BATTLE PROGRESSES, CANYONS clear, MOUNTAINS clear
text: - we find Cage and Rita again, at the forefront of SQUADS of
text: victorious SOLDIERS engaging the MIMIC in groups -
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: I think I see the Antenna. There.
text: Three left, protecting something -
text: A LARGE, SHINY MIMIC breaks cover, STREAKING through the
text: RAIN, to the CLIFF where Cage died the first time.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: We're almost out of time.
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: We'll move fast.
text: The last three RECEIVERS converge to protect the ANTENNA.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: I've got these. Go for the lead.
text: CAGE begins fighting the last RECEIVERS as -
text: Rita LANDS in front of the ANTENNA MIMIC, its iridescent,
text: rainbow-slick armor glistening in the AFTERNOON SUN.
text: It pauses... and then RUNS. Rita CHASES, the thing deflecting
text: blows right and left. It's DAMN GOOD. FASTER than the rest.
text: Every time Rita lets up, TINY BLACK TENDRILS exude from the
text: mimic's armor. It's trying to BROADCAST -—
text: Cage HAMMERS the last receivers, dodging and weaving, hacking
text: down ONE, then ANOTHER, while RITA and the ANTENNA FIGHT -
text: - it suddenly PUNCHES back, sending RITA FLYING, then JUMPS,
text: landing right over her.
speaker_heading: RITA
speaker_heading: CAGE!
speaker_heading: CAGE
speaker_heading: ONE MORE -
text: Cage SPINS IN AIR, twisting down as the final RECEIVER fires
text: multiple javelins, everything goes SLOW as his body moves in
dialog: just the right configuration to evade every one -
text: - then he BRINGS his axe down. The last receiver is DEAD.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
text: All clear.
text: He sees the ANTENNA standing over RITA, tendrils waving -
text: - and with a BATTLE CRY, Cage HURLS himself at the thing, and
text: in a blur of ARMOR, AXE and MIMIC -
text: Cage stands in low battle stance.
text: The ANTENNA MIMIC slides into six pieces. The pieces fizzle,
text: crackling. Cage steps away from the boiling blood.
text: It's over. Rita gets up.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm free. I'm really free.
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: We still have to go win this thing.
text: Cage opens his faceplate, Rita opens hers, feeling the rain.
text: Cage suddenly KISSES Rita. And then... she kisses him back,
text: harder. BLUE SKY opens behind them, like her famous poster.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: You know what they used to call
dialog: this? When it's raining and the sun
dialog: is shining?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Yeah. You once told me. You said
dialog: it's because the devil was beating
dialog: his... OW.
text: The weird BUZZ, the image SHUDDERS.
text: Cage BLINKS, staggers, a SHARP PAIN in his skull.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Are you OK?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I, uh... there's something -
text: BEHIND RITA, along the ridge, MIMIC LAUNCHERS begin to line
text: the cliffs. Thousands of them. Behind Cage, too.
speaker_heading: RADIO
scene_heading: «+.GOT MASSIVE BUILDUP HERE...
text: NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE... TRAP...
text: Cage turns. MIMIC are surrounding them, more arriving every
text: second. Rita's face falls.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Something's wrong, I... AIGH!
text: A terrible PAIN stabs through Cage's head. He twitches,
text: stumbles. He looks at Rita, horrified.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Cage?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I'm still in the loop.
text: Cage SCREAMS IN PAIN as the IMAGE SHIFTS, FUTZES to -
text: CAGE IS BACK ON HIS BUNK
dialog: 98.
text: - having a SEIZURE, people STARING, blurry, WINKING OUT and -
text: CAGE IS BACK ON THE BATTLEFIELD -
text: Rita's face buzzing back into view, only now she's CRYING,
text: cradling Cage's twitching body as he dies -
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Cage! CAGE!
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I... I don't think it worked.
text: Cage's nose is bleeding.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I know. I'll stay with you.
text: ALARMS are going off in her jacket, MORE and MORE MIMIC are
text: surrounding the spot, by land and by air.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: You have to... get out of here...
text: Rita shakes her head. Their eyes meet. She's crying.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry, Rita, I -
text: But it's lost in a hail of MIMIC JAVELINS.
scene_heading: INT. BARRACKS - MONDAY MORNING
text: Cage opens his eyes.
text: Yonaburu cleans Mrs. Smith. Making sure to get every chamber,
text: really into it, proud of his work, until he notices -
text: Cage, staring at the poster of RITA, tears on his face.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: What the hell is wrong with you?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: It didn't work. We did everything
dialog: right, but it didn't work.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: What are you talking about?
text: Cage picks up a sharpie and writes 393 on his hand.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Yobo, I got a question. If you had
dialog: to spend the rest of your life
dialog: living the same day over and over
dialog: again, forever, what would you do?
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: That's a weird fucking question,
dialog: man. I dunno. Probably see my girl.
dialog: Live happily ever after 'n stuff.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: That's a pretty damn good idea.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: (frowning)
dialog: Did you just call me "Yobo"?
text: Cage smiles, and we CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BASE - RITA'S TOWER - MORNING
text: Rita's glass tower glints in the morning light.
text: The DOGS are assembled around the base of Rita's tower,
text: having just finished breakfast. TWO of them are SCUFFLING,
text: for fun, while the others egg them on.
text: One of them - picking his teeth with a bowie knife - looks
dialog: up, noticing -
scene_heading: - CAGE, walking this way. HIGH-NOON STYLE.
speaker_heading: HEELER
dialog: You ain't got the clearance to be
dialog: in here, kid.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I need to see Sergeant-Major
dialog: Vrataski, now, and you need to get
dialog: out of my way.
text: The scufflers get up, eyeing Cage.
speaker_heading: HEELER
dialog: This a joke? 'Cos you 'bout to be
dialog: in a world a' -
text: Cage moves. WHAM! HEELER goes DOWN -
speaker_heading: SHEP
dialog: What the -
dialog: 100.
text: Cage TEARS into the Dogs like a MAN POSSESSED, fighting them
text: ALL AT ONCE, eyes steady on the door to Rita's tower.
text: The Dogs have been in battle 20, 30 times. Cage, almost 400.
text: Even without his jacket, Cage is pretty much unstoppable.
text: IN SECONDS, all the Dogs are on the ground.
scene_heading: INT. BASE OF RITA'S TOWER - MORNING
text: Cage walks in, dusty, wiping blood off his lip, looking
text: around. An EXECUTIVE OFFICER frowns up at him, and -
text: - Rita comes out of nowhere, SWINGING.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: RITA! WAIT!
text: But Rita ATTACKS, hyperfast. Cage can barely deflect her
text: blows. She sends him CRASHING down, Cage spins, fights back -
text: - but he's no match for her. In seconds, she's on top of him,
text: hand on windpipe, fist cocked and ready to kill -
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Who the hell are you?
text: The DOGS rush in, ready for bear -
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: (gagging, bleeding)
dialog: Don't. I'm... in the loop. I killed
dialog: an Antenna. I'm like you. Rita...
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: My name's Billy Cage. I... I'm in
dialog: the loop. You're... helping me.
text: Rita sees... that 393 is written on Cage's hand.
dialog: Rita's EYES GO WIDE -
text: She lets go, jumping back like she touched a live wire. Cage
text: starts COUGHING. The DOGS stare, totally confused.
text: HOLSTROM walks in, cocking his gun, leveled at Cage.
scene_heading: LT. HOLSTROM
dialog: Anyone wanna tell me just what the
dialog: hell is going on here?
dialog: 101.
text: Cage slowly salutes, at attention.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Private... William Cage requests
dialog: permission to speak with Sergeant-
text: Major Vrataski. In private.
text: Rita nods. Holstrom hesitates. Stands down.
scene_heading: EXT. BASE - DAY
text: They walk, Rita's mind racing, and tears on her face. The
text: highly confused Dogs trailing well behind.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (wiping her eyes)
dialog: Sorry. I'm just... used to being
dialog: alone.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: How'd you... figure it out?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I didn't. You told me. Last time.
dialog: Before I died.
text: Rita nods, wiping her nose.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: We have to find the Antenna you
dialog: killed. And the receivers. I can
dialog: show you how.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: You already did.
text: She stops, looking him in the eye, suspicious.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Then why are you... here?
text: Cage hesitates. He can't tell her the truth.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Because, uh... at the last minute,
dialog: I didn't kill the Antenna. We...
dialog: wanted to come back. Spend the day
text: together, just one more time.
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Oh. I see.
text: Rita eyes Cage, wondering just what she and this Private have
text: been doing, in his past, in her future.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: You, uh, wanna get some breakfast?
scene_heading: INT. MESS HALL - DAY
text: 3rd PLATOON is in the Cafeteria, grimacing over the chow.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: I don't know! He was crying, then
text: he just jumped up and took off like
dialog: a bat outta hell. And whatever he
dialog: said to the Sarge musta -
dialog: (seeing)
text: Sweet Jesus on a mountain.
text: Cage and Rita enter the mess hall together, followed by the
text: Dogs, who look just as confused as everyone else.
scene_heading: CAGE AND RITA STAND IN LINE
text: The SERVERS try not to stare at them, lumping chow.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I'm sure not gonna miss the food.
text: Rita doesn't know what to say. She looks nervous, like she's
dialog: on her first date.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
text: Table in the corner. Just like
dialog: always.
text: They sit.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: This is weird. I feel like you must
dialog: know everything about me.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Not really. I mostly know how to
dialog: kill mimics. I'm pretty good at
dialog: that. You said so yourself.
text: Rita smiles uncomfortably. They eat.
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: One thing I could never figure was -
dialog: why do you come eat with us? No one
dialog: in their right mind would eat this
dialog: crap if they didn't have to.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I have to do something that makes
dialog: me feel like myself. I kinda got
dialog: used to it.
text: Cage pours chocolate sauce over a pile of pickled eggs.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: This is my favorite lately.
dialog: "Pickled egg chocolate surprise".
text: Cage digs in. Rita tries some. She smiles. Not bad.
speaker_heading: RITA
text: Loop food. Brings back memories.
dialog: What about...
text: Rita piles hot sauce on top of her oatmeal, adding what looks
text: like canned sardines. Cage winces. She offers. He tries it.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Not bad. Kinda... Smoky.
text: Everyone is staring at them. Cage takes another bite, washes
text: it down with a big swig of metacoffee. Rita winces.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: How do you drink that stuff?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Hasn't killed me yet.
text: Their eyes meet. Rita suddenly starts laughing. Cage too. All
text: the anxious worry coming off of them. Now everyone is REALLY
text: staring. Cage leans in -
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: You wanna get out of here?
scene_heading: EXT. BASE - DAY
text: RUMORS visibly SPREAD around base, SOLDIERS going out of
text: their way to stare at the pair as they walk, the DOGS behind.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Follow me.
dialog: 104.
text: Cage takes Rita's hand PULLS her around a corner, RUNNING -
scene_heading: EXT. BASE - BY THE FENCE
text: - down an alley, losing the Dogs, finding... THE HOLE IN THE
text: FENCE, right where Palka always makes it.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Come on!
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - DAY
text: GULLS CAW, waves CRASH on the shore. Rita and Cage walk,
text: stealing glances at each other. A sweet tension between them.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: So when we, uh, decided to not kill
dialog: the Antenna, and come back, were
dialog: we, like...
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: We, uh, just kissed. It all
dialog: happened pretty fast.
text: Rita pushes her hair back. No one's around.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I want to know what it was like.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Uh, OK.
text: They kiss. Nervous and tender. It's possible that Rita's
dialog: never kissed anyone before in her adult life.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: That was... nice.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: It was weird, too.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Yeah. I guess it must be.
text: Rita looks out at the ocean, feeling complicated.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Why'd you join up?
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I got drafted. I tried everything I
dialog: could to get out of it. And now...
dialog: here I am.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The last time... you told me you
dialog: lied about your age to get in. Why?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I was sixteen. A farm girl. The
dialog: town I grew up in, mimic scouts
dialog: came up river, some hunters found
dialog: them. They burned my town. I lost
dialog: everything - my dad, my mom. My
dialog: horse.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I guess I joined the marines
dialog: because I didn't want to live
dialog: anymore. I figured if I could kill
dialog: just one mimic, that would be
dialog: enough and then I could die. I
dialog: don't know what I was thinking. But
dialog: I was lucky. There was this man.
dialog: Lieutenant Arthur Hendricks. He
dialog: found me. Showed me how to use my
dialog: jacket.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Were you... in love with him?
text: A painful look crosses her face.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry, you just seem... really
dialog: sad about it.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: It's OK. Yeah. I'm pretty sure I
dialog: was in love with him.
scene_heading: CUT TO FLASHBACK:
text: Rita trains with ARTHUR HENDRICKS. He's handsome, late-30s, a
text: warmth in him, not undone by the years of battle.
text: Then he's showing her pictures of his WIFE and CHILD. She
text: looks at him like a girl in love.
speaker_heading: RITA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I think he loved me too. But he had
dialog: a family, so it was different... we
dialog: never even talked about it. And
dialog: besides, there was a war on.
dialog: 106.
text: WE SEE HER WINNING THE FINAL BATTLE, soldiers CHEERING in the
text: smoke while she WEEPS over the body of ARTHUR HENDRICKS -
speaker_heading: RITA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: No matter how I played it, I could
dialog: never save him. He was the real
dialog: hero of that battle. He died, and I
dialog: got a medal. No one ever knew.
text: - and then, ON A STAGE, getting the Valkyrie Medal of Honor
text: draped around her neck. It means nothing to her.
scene_heading: WE CUT BACK TO:
text: Rita, sitting in the sand, the same expression on her face.
text: She wipes away a tear.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: When I finally got out of the loop,
dialog: all I wanted was to get back in. To
dialog: have one more chance to save him.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'd have traded the whole battle
dialog: for it.
text: Cage looks at her, not sure what to say.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I'm... really sorry. I think maybe
dialog: some people are just fated.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Yeah. Maybe so.
text: She looks at Cage.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: Would you kiss me again?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Yeah.
text: They lie back. On the distant shore, the low THUMP and GLOW
text: of ARTILLERY hammering the far-off island, and we CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RITA'S BUNK - DAWN - RUBY TUESDAY
text: Cage opens his eyes. The morning sky is bright blue overhead.
text: He's in Rita's bed. And her bed -
text: - appears to be in a WHEAT FIELD. Cage sits up, disoriented.
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Where are we?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Pennsylvania. The farm where I grew
dialog: up. We had the bluest skies you've
dialog: ever seen.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's just an old holovid. But I
dialog: wanted you to see it.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: It's really beautiful.
text: Rita smiles, a little sadly, and gets up, in her pyjamas.
text: The holovid FREEZES, distorts and fades, replaced by -
text: - the thick polycarbonate glass of Rita's tower.
text: Cage stares out at the island, the distant shelling,
text: preparations for today's battle in progress, far below.
text: A grinder WHIRS, water BOILS, GROUNDS go into a brewing pot.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: It's coffee. Real coffee. Some of
dialog: the last in the world.
text: She adds water, the dark brew drizzles into the pot.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I thought that stuff was extinct.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Almost. There's an island off the
dialog: coast of Africa - one of the last
dialog: places it'll grow. I fought there
dialog: once and they still have it flown
dialog: in for me. It doesn't seem right
dialog: that I should have it all to
dialog: myself.
text: She pours some into his cup. Cage drinks. His eyes go wide.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: That's uh... nothing like the stuff
text: they have in the mess hall.
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: It's probably the best cup of
dialog: coffee you can get in the whole
dialog: world. I mean, since no one gets to
dialog: make coffee anymore. You have to do
dialog: it just right or it's no good.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: You'll have to show me how
dialog: sometime.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (sadly)
dialog: I'd like that.
text: Rita looks down at her coffee.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: I was wondering. The last time
dialog: we... were in the loop. You said we
dialog: decided not to kill the Antenna?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Uh, no. But don't worry. We'll get
dialog: out this time.
text: She searches his face. She knows he's lying.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Well. I'm glad we decided to come
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Me too.
text: They kiss, holding each other. Cage looks out at the
text: beautiful vista, smiling... but something is flying this -
text: WHAM! A MIMIC JAVELIN HITS THE TOWER.
text: ANOTHER VOLLEY STREAKS IN - WHAM! WHAM! Cage and Rita are
text: THROWN to the floor, her tower SHUDDERING with the impact.
text: The polycarbonate fractures, spider-thin cracks working their
text: way across the room - but it HOLDS.
text: Cage picks himself off the floor, stunned.
text: ALARMS start going off. BELOW THEM, the BASE is getting
scene_heading: HAMMERED by MIMIC JAVELINS -
text: - SOLDIERS run like ants on an upended mound as MIMIC ERUPT
text: beneath them, the beaches DARK with MIMIC crawling from the
text: SEA - CARRIERS and DROPSHIPS engulfed in flame -
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell?
speaker_heading: RITA
text: The mimic are attacking early. They
dialog: know we're together.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We have to get out of here.
text: Another JAVELIN hits the tower, pieces SHATTERING IN. Rita
text: GRABS Cage and they PILE into the elevator, the tower
text: SHUDDERING with multiple impacts.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWER BASE - RUBY TUESDAY
text: They make it out, and to the ENGINEERING BAY. SHASTA is
text: already there, with Rita's crimson exojacket ready -
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (to Cage)
dialog: We have to find the Antenna. We're
dialog: not gonna get another chance. Can
dialog: you make it to the armory?
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I think so.
text: Their eyes meet. Shasta notices the LOOK, and Cage TAKES OFF.
scene_heading: INT. ARMORY - RUBY TUESDAY
scene_heading: TOTAL MAYHEM. SGT. FARELL SCREAMS at 3rd Platoon as JAVELINS
text: TEAR HOLES in the roof of the locker room.
text: SOME SOLDIERS make it to their jackets in time. SOME DON'T.
text: YONABURU finds his jacket, but - WHAM! An EXPLOSION sends him
text: flying. He picks himself up, arm bleeding profusely -
dialog: - his exojacket is WASTED. Fuck.
speaker_heading: ELSEWHERE, CAGE
text: Runs through the disintegrating locker room, DIVING, JUMPING
text: through the carnage. He gets to his locker - it's DESTROYED -
dialog: HIS FACE: All is lost.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: No!
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
speaker_heading: CAGE!
text: Yonaburu, spattered in blood and dust, holds Cage's jacket -
speaker_heading: YONABURU (CONT'D)
dialog: They got mine. But I saved yours.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Thanks, buddy. You're the best.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Go get ‘em.
scene_heading: EXT. BASE - RUBY TUESDAY
text: Cage RUNS across the base, his heads-up a USELESS MESS of
text: blue and red, the base in CHAOS -
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: RITA! WHERE ARE YOU!?
speaker_heading: RITA (RADIO)
dialog: Right here.
text: THOOM! Rita lands, the DOGS with her. HUNDREDS OF MIMIC
text: CONVERGING on this ONE SPOT. But Rita fights with TWO AXES -
dialog: cutting a SWATH -
text: - and then THROWS an AXE to CAGE, he catches it just in time,
text: SWINGING just as the MIMIC reach him. SHUCK! The mimics FALL -
text: AND THE BATTLE IS ON
text: HOLSTROM calls in STRIKEJETS. Rita SEIZES EXECUTIVE COMMAND,
text: organizing the remaining HUMAN FORCES. Cage LEADS PLATOONS.
text: Cornered, against impossible odds, EVERYONE fights at their
dialog: best - better than their best.
text: - FORD saves NANCE'S ASS, the two TEAMING UP -
text: - the DOGS lay WASTE to everything in their path. SHEP is
text: crushed. HEELER is blown in half. INU throws himself on an
text: exploding MIMIC to save FOX. DANE ignites an AMMO DUMP,
text: killing a hundred MIMIC at once -
text: - SGT. FARELL finds himself fighting one-on-one. Just how he
text: likes it, WHANGING mimic with a twisted piece of metal.
scene_heading: SGT. FARELL
dialog: LET'S SEE WHAT YOU'VE GOT!
dialog: 111.
text: - KIMMEL even commandeers a DROPSHIP, FLYING it into the MESS
text: HALL, DIVING and ROLLING FREE and watching the explosion.
speaker_heading: FROM ABOVE
text: STRIKEJETS hail holy hell on the ADVANCING MIMIC FORCES, but
text: the BASE is half-destroyed. It's not looking good.
speaker_heading: CAGE AND RITA
text: fight their way onto a HEAP of smoking metal, getting a VIEW
text: of the war-torn base.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: There. And there. Do you see them?
text: NINE RED DOTS are flagged WHITE.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Nine of ‘em, check.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: We don't have much time.
text: Cage kills a RECEIVER - WHAM. RITA kills ANOTHER - WHAM.
text: Their moves in perfect mirror images of each other.
text: ONE, TWO, THREE mimic receivers go down. Everyone goes down a
text: different way. Each one is harder to kill than the last.
text: The ANTENNA always WATCHING, RETREATING, HIDING -
text: The last two receivers TAKE FLIGHT, Cage and Rita HUNT them
text: down, merciless and unstoppable, finding themselves in -
text: THE SMOLDERING CRATER OF THE MESS HALL
text: The RAINBOW-COLORED ANTENNA MIMIC SCUTTLING into the
text: WRECKAGE. Rita HEAVES back a hunk of smoking DROPSHIP -
text: - the ANTENNA MIMIC LEAPS, knocking her back, and is ON CAGE
text: in a FLASH. CAGE FIGHTS BACK, but this mimic knows his every
text: move. A SCREECHING BLUR of LIMBS and JAVELINS firing.
text: Cage is KNOCKED BACK, WHAM! WHAM! BLOOD hits the inside of
text: his PLATE as he GOES DOWN -
text: As the blood beads and trickles off, Cage looks up at the
text: spinning BARREL of the mimic's JAVELIN ARM.
dialog: It's going to kill him now.
text: WHACK! Rita hits it from the side. The ANTENNA flies through
text: the air in SLOW MOTION, tendrils FLARING -
dialog: 112.
scene_heading: - AS ACROSS THE BASE
text: THOUSANDS OF MIMIC STOP ATTACKING. SOLDIERS are left
text: scratching their heads as mimic DETACH, racing across the
text: base to ONE POINT: to the MESS HALL CRATER -
text: BACK WITH CAGE AND RITA
text: - where the Antenna LANDS and LAUNCHES ITSELF at RITA, their
text: BLOWS KEEPING THEM BOTH AIRBORNE until -
text: It KICKS RITA'S FACEPLATE, SHATTERING IT. She SCREAMS, losing
text: grip on her axe -
text: RITA FALLS TO THE GROUND. The AXE falling nearby. JAVELINS
text: pepper the area until a HUNK OF DROPSHIP FALLS ACROSS HER
scene_heading: LEG, PINNING HER TO THE GROUND -
text: The MIMIC LANDS, standing over her, VIBRATING with POWER -
text: - its JAVELIN ARM leveled at Rita's unprotected face.
text: She glares up at it, gritting her teeth.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: DO IT, YOU BASTARD.
text: An ELECTRICAL ARC ZAPS between the mimic and Rita, then the
text: Antenna mimic... CHITTERS, the WHIRRING stops.
text: Then it BACKS AWAY, looking for Cage -
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: NO!
text: - the MIMIC whirls, too late. WHAM! Cage's AXE swings, CUTS
text: into the mimic, BLACK BLOOD FLYING, but it's not DEEP ENOUGH.
text: The MIMIC SCREECHES, fighting back in a BLUR, but Cage BLOCKS
text: its every strike. With no other option, the mimic starts to
text: SHUDDER, a tachyon charge building -
text: - Cage SWINGS and the MIMIC falls, CRACKLING, SHORTING OUT -
speaker_heading: DEAD.
text: Cage is on his knees, exhausted. ALARMS going off in Cage's
text: heads-up. THOUSANDS of mimic will be here any second.
text: He goes to RITA, opening his faceplate.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Are you OK?
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Yeah. Get this thing off of me.
text: Cage STRAINS, lifting the fallen piece of dropship and
text: freeing her, helping her up.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks.
text: They KISS, urgently. The SUN is streaking down, RAIN, too.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: We don't have much time. You have
dialog: to get out of here. Killing the
dialog: Antenna... it doesn't work. We
dialog: already tried it. I don't know why,
dialog: but they're still coming. I don't
dialog: think there's any way out for me.
text: MIMIC have begun to line the rim of the crater. MORE arriving
dialog: every second.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: I... I'm sorry I lied. I just
dialog: wanted to be with you. It was the
dialog: only way I knew how.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I love you, Rita.
text: Rita picks up her axe.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I love you, too.
text: Rita SWINGS, hitting Cage with the flat of the axe - KNOCKING
text: CAGE BACK 20 YARDS. He sits up, holding his jaw.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: What the hell was that for?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I figured it out this morning.
text: She walks towards Cage. He scrambles back.
text: She looks up at the crater rim, her heads-up thick with on-
text: rushing mimic coming from every angle.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: It's me. They're using me.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: What?
dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Whatever the loop did to me, it
dialog: turned me into a receiver.
text: She SWINGS her axe, Cage ROLLS -
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: As long as I'm alive, your loop
dialog: won't end.
text: Cage GRABS his AXE, DEFLECTING HER BLOW, backing away.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: You have to kill me. Or you'll
dialog: never be free.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Are you out of your mind?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I'm the last receiver.
text: Rita HAMMERS Cage. Cage PARRIES, backing away.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I can't... I'm not gonna fight you.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Then you'll have to loop again
dialog: until you get it through your thick
dialog: skull. It's you they're after. You
dialog: win the battle. Not me.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I've watched you fight. I've seen
dialog: what you can do.
text: Cage KICKS her away. The edge of the crater is lined with
text: MIMIC - but they don't attack - they wait.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I'm not gonna kill - AIGH!
text: Cage staggers. His head. The image SHIFTS, BUZZING, like he's
text: going to LOOP again. He YELLS, the world comes BACK -
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: It's the only way out.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: No, I won't -
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: You have to.
text: But Rita gives him everything she's got. She's SWINGING at
text: him, FORCING him to protect himself. Cage DEFLECTS blows as
text: best he can, BACKING, ROLLING AWAY. But Rita LEAPS —
text: - and with a YELL, Cage RAISES HIS AXE, WARDING HER OFF, she
scene_heading: MISSES A PARRY AND -
text: - Cage's axe slices into Rita. She FALLS. Badly injured.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: RITA! NO!
text: He throws his axe down. Runs to her. She pushes herself up,
text: over on her back. Blood gushing out of a gash in her side.
text: Cage cradles her.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: You'll be... free now.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I can get you help. We can get out
dialog: of this together -
text: Rita shakes her head, coughs, smiling.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Dying's not that bad, once you get
dialog: used to it.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Rita!
text: The image DISTORTS, SPUTTERS one last time - and is NORMAL.
text: The rain is coming down. The sun is shining.
text: Cage stands, picking up Rita's axe, wiping his face. He looks
text: at the MIMIC HORDE. He raises the axe and RUNS into the horde
text: with a BATTLE CRY.
speaker_heading: CAGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Rita was right. About everything.
text: We see Cage's HEADS-UP, blinking RED, but as he fights we see
text: the onrushing FRONTS of mimic FRACTURE, EDDY as -
text: ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE
text: SOLDIERS UNDER ATTACK watch as SOME MIMIC start running in
text: the wrong direction, OTHERS even start attacking each other.
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: CAGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: At first a few stopped working
dialog: right. But pretty soon, they just
dialog: fell apart.
text: Farell watches as everywhere the mimic fall into CHAOS. Some
text: still attack, but the synchronous VOLLEYS, the ORDERED FRONT
dialog: LINES are gone...
dialog: From ordered WAVES, to SWARMS, to NOISE...
text: The SKY is a HELLISH RED as CAGE CLEANS UP. The look in his
text: eyes - insane with grief, exhaustion. He doesn't stop.
speaker_heading: CAGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I kept fighting long after the
dialog: battle was over.
scene_heading: EXT. BASE - WEDNESDAY MORNING
text: In the EARLY MORNING LIGHT, the BASE is smoking, ruined. CAGE
text: staggers through the wreckage. YONABURU and SEVERAL OFFICERS
text: trail Cage at a distance, afraid to come close.
text: Cage's exojacket is blackened, dented. Cage finally drops his
text: axe, with a CLANG, and FALLS to his knees.
speaker_heading: CAGE (V.O.)
dialog: I don't even remember when they
dialog: found me.
text: PRELAP: TAPS begins to play.
scene_heading: EXT. MILITARY FUNERAL - ISLAND - DAY
text: A FUNERAL PROCESSION stretches out across the base. A MILLION
text: SOLDIERS watch, and PEOPLE across the WORLD watch as RITA'S
text: FUNERAL BIER is marched across the ISLAND.
text: ON A VAST STAGE, surrounded by COLONELS and MAJORS of every
text: stripe, Cage is awarded the Valkyrie Medal of Honor. The
dialog: second person in history to receive this privilege.
speaker_heading: CAGE (V.O.)
dialog: We'd won the battle of Ruby
dialog: Tuesday. I was a hero.
text: Cage looks like the saddest person in the whole world.
speaker_heading: CAGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: But it didn't matter. Nothing did.
dialog: Rita was gone.
dialog: 117.
scene_heading: EXT. BASE - ANOTHER DAY
text: The BASE is still ruined, but full of living HUMANS digging
text: out, making repairs. BANDAGED SOLDIERS watch NEWSCASTS about
text: the BATTLE OF RUBY TUESDAY.
scene_heading: INT. ENGINEERING BAY - DAY
text: Cage's EXOJACKET stands in the center of a workshop.
text: YONABURU, his ARM IN A SLING, is painting Cage's jacket
dialog: BRIGHT BLUE, like you'd detail a car.
text: He stands back, admiring his work. Cage steps in.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I like it.
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: I don't know, man. You're gonna
dialog: make a pretty easy target. I was
dialog: thinking we could put some flames
dialog: on there -
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: No. I like the blue.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I brought you something.
text: Cage tosses Yonaburu his new medal. Yonaburu frowns.
speaker_heading: CAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: There's your gold star. Keep it.
scene_heading: INT. RITA'S TOWER - DAY
text: Cage rides the elevator up into Rita's broken tower. He has
text: to step past warning tape to get to her room.
text: The spilled coffee. The bed just how they left it.
text: He stands there, looking out at the clear blue sky.
text: There's a knock. It's Shasta Riley. She salutes. Cage nods.
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: Uh... hi there. They said you were
dialog: up here again.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Hi Shasta.
dialog: 118.
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: The morning of the battle, when
dialog: Rita got her jacket, she, uh,
dialog: wanted me to... to give you this.
dialog: In case anything happened.
text: She hands him an envelope. Cage frowns.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: I miss her so much.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: I do too.
text: She nods and exits. Cage opens the envelope.
speaker_heading: LETTER (V.O.)
dialog: How to make the best cup of coffee
dialog: in the world:
text: Handwritten instructions. At the bottom of the instructions -
speaker_heading: LETTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I love you. Always fight with your
dialog: heart.
speaker_heading: NOW
text: Cage is pouring the boiling water over the grounds, following
dialog: the instructions.
text: Cage drinks the coffee, staring out at the base.
text: Distant ALARMS start going off. Cage frowns. Yonaburu comes
dialog: in, out of breath, he RAN here -
speaker_heading: YONABURU
dialog: Cage. I thought I'd find you here.
dialog: Alaska's under attack. We gotta
dialog: move out.
text: Cage nods, puts the coffee down. He smiles.
speaker_heading: CAGE
dialog: Right. Let's go win this thing.
speaker_heading: THE END.
dialog:
