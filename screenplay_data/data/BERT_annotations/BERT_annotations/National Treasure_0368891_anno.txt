text: John stops. He's never thought of that before.
speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: I touch the case every day, which
dialog: is closer than most people will
dialog: ever get to it. Which makes me the
dialog: expert in this room about there
dialog: being or not being a map on the
dialog: back. Which there is not.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: That's because it's invisible.
speaker_heading: RILEY
dialog: It is?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Invisible inks were common back

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Look at the back.
speaker_heading: RILEY
dialog: We would?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Of course. If we don't look at the
dialog: back, we'll never find the treasure.
dialog: If we don't find the treasure,

speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: I will when I see the treasure.

text: The force of the thundering cascade knocks all of them off
text: their feet, Ian drops his sword, but more importantly...
text: ...HE DROPS THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE INTO THE WATER!
dialog: 
text: Water also pours into the chamber from the elevator shaft.
text: Before anyone can react, the chamber is already filled up
text: to their chests.
text: Abigail and Ben both see the Declaration of Independence in
text: its tube bobbing around in the churning water.
text: Ben frantically swims to it, but it slips away...just out
dialog: of his reach.
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: I got it!
text: The tube floats to Abigail. She scoops it out of the water,
text: then holds it over her head as the water swirls around her.
text: The chamber is filling quickly and it's now mostly dark
text: except for the faint glow of he submerged flashlights.
text: Everyone claws at the walls, finding no purchase in the
text: smooth stone. Ben calls over the din of the rushing water.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Listen! We have to work together!
dialog: "Join or die."
speaker_heading: RILEY
dialog: How? !
speaker_heading: BEN
text: There is a triangle carved into the
dialog: floor! At each vertex, there isa
dialog: slot! We must get the swords, then
dialog: each of us must stick them in the
dialog: slots and turn the swords! All of
dialog: us, together!
text: Riley regards Ben for a long beat, then...
speaker_heading: RILEY
dialog: Are you out of your mind?!
text: Ben answers by disappearing under the water's surface.

text: one. Ri ey swims up behind him and grabs the other. hey
text: both then kick back toward the surface.
text: IN THE CHAMBER. Ben and Riley resurface with the swords,
text: gasping for breath. Ben hands Ian the sword.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Find the slot! At the triangle's
dialog: vertex.
text: The stone walls suddenly GROAN under the tons of pressure.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Go!
text: All three disappear underwater, leaving Abigail, holding

scene_heading: EXT. TRINITY CHURCH GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND CATACOMBS, ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT
dialog: Abigail still holds the Declaration of Independence above
text: her head, but there is less than a foot of space left now.
text: UNDERWATER. Riley and Ian dive down, feel the floor, find
text: edges of the triangle, and follow them. BEN also feels the
text: floor, searching for the sword...
text: IN THE CHAMBER. Only inches of space left now. Abigail
text: presses the Declaration of Independence and her face
text: against the ceiling in the cramped pocket of air.
text: UNDERWATER. Ian follows his edge. Finds the vertex slot.
text: Shoves his sword into it. Turns it.
text: RILEY finds his vertex and does the same.
text: BEN finally finds the sword.
text: IN THE CHAMBER. Abigail and the Declaration of
text: Independence are now completely submerged. There is no air
dialog: pocket anymore.

text: CUT TO - PITCH BACK. We hear the SCRAPING SOUND of the 360
text: stone floor rolling open. As it does, the faintest_ glimmer
text: of light peeks up from the submerged flashlights below.
text: A beat, then Abigail's hand POKES UP THROUGH THE CRACK in
text: the floor, holding the Declaration of Independence.
text: She tosses it aside onto the dry floor, then pulls herself
text: up through the opening.
text: Ian pulls himself up through the floor next, then rolls

scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND CATACOMBS, OSSUARY - NIGHT 361

speaker_heading: SADUSKY
dialog: There's got to be another way down.
dialog: Find it!
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND TREASURE CHAMBER - NIGHT 362

text: Abigail waits by it. A beat, then Riley surfaces, coughing.
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: Where's Ben?
text: Ian catches his breath, then peers into the darkness. In
text: the near distance, we can see something...GLIMMERING.
text: Suddenly, the floor starts rumbling closed again. Panicked,
text: Abigail calls out...
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Ben! Ben!
text: Ian picks up the Declaration of Independence which lies on
text: the stone floor near him.
text: Just then, Ben comes up gasping for air, choking on

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (between coughs)
dialog: I thought we might need this.

speaker_heading: RILEY
dialog: Is that...?

speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: ".,.An altar of bronze, twenty cubits

speaker_heading: BEN

text: torches. They quickly light them, then turn to see...
scene_heading: THE TREASURE CHAMBER.
text: Dozens of marble Doric and Corinthian columns line the walls
text: of the cavernous chamber filled with ancient treasures...
text: Crown jewels, gold and silver plates and chalices, gilded
text: cherubim, olivewood furniture, carriages, loot from the
text: Oracle of Delphi, and countless sacred artifacts.
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: This is what it must have been like
dialog: to find King Tut's Tomb.
speaker_heading: RILEY
dialog: Don't say that. Those guys were
dialog: cursed.
text: Ian starts moving through the chamber, in awe of its
text: treasures. But Ben doesn't move. He just stands there.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: We'll be taking the Declaration of
dialog: Independence now, Ian.
text: Ian finds a chest, opens it...it's filled with ancient Greek
dialog: and Roman coins.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: Oh come on, Ben. Have some fun.
text: Ian moves past the chest, and Riley can't help himself. He
text: oes to it, sticks his hand in it, and comes up with a
text: andful of coins. He laughs, incredulous.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: A deal's a deal, Ian.
dialog: National Treasure, 4/9/03 122.
speaker_heading: 362 CONTINUED: (2) 362
text: But Ian isn't listening. He's found another ANCIENT SWORD,
dialog: only this one is different...special.
text: Its silver handle is decorated with images of scythed |
text: chariots engaged in battle and the famous Macedonian King.
text: Riley steps up behind Ian. He sees the sword.
speaker_heading: RILEY
dialog: Cool gothic sword.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: It's not just any sword...
text: Ian picks it up. It's heavy. Weighs more than 30 pounds.
speaker_heading: IAN (CONT'D)
dialog: ...It's the sword of Alexander the
dialog: Great...
text: As Ian holds up_the sword, we notice that it almost GLISTENS
text: with an ethereal power.
speaker_heading: IAN (CONT'D)
dialog: ...It was used to conquer the world.
text: Without warning, Ian swings the sword backwards under his
text: arm in a rowing motion and...
text: ...Plunges it into RILEY'S STOMACH!
text: Riley staggers back, stunned. Then, he collapses.
text: Shocked and horrified, Ben and Abigail rush to Riley. He's
text: bleeding. Badly.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Riley. Oh, Jesus...
text: Ben takes off his shirt. Balls it up. Presses it on Riley's
text: wound. Abigail helps Ben hold it there. Riley looks up to
text: Ben. He knows it's bad. He grimaces in agony.
speaker_heading: RILEY
dialog: At least I was rich before I died.
text: With that, Ian swings his_sword at Ben who just barely rolls
text: out of the way it time. The sword hits the stone floor
text: with a loud CLANK, taking out divot of stone.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: You couldn't just want the treasure
dialog: now, could you, Ben?
text: Ian swings again, but Ben grabs a bronze plate and blocks
text: the blow. SPARKS fly as the plate shatters.
dialog: National Treasure, 4/9/03 123.
speaker_heading: 362 CONTINUED: (3) 362
speaker_heading: IAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You couldn't just be reasonable and
dialog: argue with me over shares. I say,
dialog: "How about 70-30?" And then you
dialog: say, "How about 60-40?" And then I
dialog: say, "What about 80-20?"
text: Ben scrambles to his feet, and Ian chases him.
speaker_heading: IAN (CONT'D)
dialog: No, you have to go and be all noble.
text: He swings the sword at Ben again, but Ben dives behind a
text: suit of armor which Ian SMASHES with his sword.
text: Ben goes down with the medieval suit which clatters to the
text: ground. Ben shoulder-rolls to his feet and comes up with a
text: sword of his own.
text: They face off. En Guard! They circle each other.
speaker_heading: IAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't trust honest men.
text: Ian strikes. Ben parries. Their swords cross with a loud
text: CLANK. They push off each other, and then the duel begins
text: in earnest.
text: Actually, it's more like two guys fighting a bar fight with
text: heavy swords. Neither is trained in fencing, but neither
text: is about to give up first.
text: They exchange blows in an exhausting Rob Roy-esque_ sword
text: tig t. Ian attacks. Ben parries and simultaneously delivers
text: a brutal kick to Ian's ribs, staggering Ian.
text: The Declaration of Independence falls to the ground and
text: rolls away, down some stone steps...
text: Angered, Ian winds up. Strikes a vicious blow. Ben deflects
text: it with his sword which breaks in half. The other half
text: clanks to the ground.
text: ON ABIGAIL. She's applying pressure to Riley's wound. She
text: sees the Declaration of Independence rolling toward a slatted
text: drain in the floor...
text: She_grabs Riley's hands and puts them on the now bloody,
text: balled up shirt.
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: Apply pressure.
text: Riley weakly holds onto the field dressing as...
text: Abigail hurries to the still rolling Declaration of
text: Independence which is almost to the drain.
dialog: 362
dialog: National Treasure, 4/9/03 124.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4) 362
text: Abigail DIVES FOR_IT...but just misses it. The Declaration
text: of Independence slips through the slats and DISAPPEARS DOWN
dialog: THE DRAIN!!!
text: ON IAN and BEN. Ian swings. _ Ben ducks and dodges, but
text: Ian's sword catches pieces of him. Slices into Ben's
text: shoulder. And his chest.
text: ON ABIGAIL. She sticks her hand into the drain...
text: INSIDE THE DRAIN. The Declaration of Independence is stuck
text: way down deep in the drain where the drain narrows.
text: Abigail's hand reaches down for the tube, but it's...just...
dialog: out...of...reach.
text: ON BEN and IAN. Bloodied, Ben hurls the broken sword at
text: Ian who deflects it and charges Ben.
text: Ben scrambles over the treasure pile, improvising, grabbing
text: whatever he can to parry Ian's blows. A chalice...CLANK!
text: An urn...which shatters!
text: Ben grabs an alabaster cherubim. He holds it up to deflect
text: a blow, but notices that it's just too beautiful to ruin.
text: Ben sets it back down, then dives behind a PILLAR just as...
text: Ian swings again, striking the pillar instead...WHAM! Chunks
text: of marble fly.
text: Ian circles around the pillar, chasing the wounded Ben with
text: his sword. Ian swings, and Ben ducks. This time, Ian's
text: sword gets STUCK in the pillar.
text: As Ian tries to extricate it...
text: Ben pushes a Greek limestone statue. But it's heavy. It
text: teeters...finally tips.
text: Ian turns Aust in time to see the statue about to crush
dialog: him. CRASH!
text: But it doesn't crush Ian. The statue instead crashes into
text: the pillar, leaving just enough space to save Ian.
text: Ian grabs the sword, yanks it out...
text: Bad idea. The pillar gives way, and the statue finishes
text: its fall, smashing down on Ian. Killing him instantly.
text: And tearing a hole in the stone wall behind him. Water
text: GUSHES IN from the hole. It's the elevator shaft.
text: As the water rushes in, the whole treasure chamber begins
text: to rumble. Pieces of the stone ceiling start to fall,
text: crashing down all around.
text: Ben looks to see Abigail still struggling with the drain.
