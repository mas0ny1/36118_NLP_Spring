dialog: my heart is paying now for things I

text: AS THE DEEP BLACK TURNS SMOKY GREY we are ...
text: Somewhere in southern Alabama. Sometime past midnight. Some
dialog: time around 1950. And though it’s impossible to clearly make
text: out details, it feels like what it is, a sweaty HONKY TONK.
text: Camera floats like a moth around the beautiful and hypnotic
text: face; past the dark haunted eyes of a 27 year-old man who
text: somehow even in this first moment feels like he's at least 20
text: years older. HIRAM “HANK” WILLIAMS born in a speck of a town,
dialog: poorer than is imaginable.
text: Glimpses of his ever present cowboy hat. A small stately
text: Stetson. His fancy western suit, sweat stained collar and
dialog: missing rhinestones. Not because he can’t afford to fix them,
text: he just doesn't have the time. Hank is burning through the
dialog: days and nights with a fever that will scorch you.
text: The voice is confident and ancient and yet supple like a
dialog: child. But mostly it is so damn personal that every person
dialog: who hears it thinks it belongs to them. And of course, it is
text: sad. Sadder than anyone has ever heard. The song is “Cold
dialog: Cold Heart.”
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: “In anger unkind words are said,
dialog: that make the tear drops start
dialog: How can I free your doubtful mind
dialog: and melt your cold cold heart...”
text: The strains of Hank’s lament play under the opening of the
text: next scene and then as speaking voices come up, it dies out.

speaker_heading: HANK

speaker_heading: MAN

text: DON HELMS 20’S on pedal steel guitar and LUM YORK, 20’S on

dialog: Sammy Pruitt).
text: Hank hunches over the microphone, all 150 pounds of him. As

dialog: it’s unique. Visceral. And the sexuality cannot be denied. He

text: IN THE WINGS is Hank’s MOTHER, LILLIE, 40’s, intense,

speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Right, that goes both ways ... he’s

speaker_heading: LILLIE
dialog: You think so ...
text: ON HANK. Finishes the song, glimpses over at the two of them.

speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Don't worry Lillie, Hank will hand
dialog: it over to me before we even get
dialog: home ...
speaker_heading: LILLIE
dialog: I'd be careful little girl, that’s
text: a tinder box out there.
text: Hank grabs a coke bottle full of liquor off the floor. Nearly
text: falls as he does. Big swig, then drapes his arm around
text: Audrey. He kisses her cheek, she leans into him. They roll

dialog: Well, partner why don't you just
dialog: turn the damn thing off ... that's
dialog: why they put knobs on it.
text: Audience laughs. The GUY explodes, CHARGES the stage, pushes
text: people out of the way. Hank shows no fear, just carefully
text: sets down his guitar, goes straight for the LEG OF DON’S
scene_heading: STEEL GUITAR.
text: Crowd SCATTERS, the SCARY GUY trips, almost falls, gets to
text: the stage, jumps up and dives for Hank. He just barely grabs
text: Hank’s PANTS LEG and pulls him to the floor. But as Hank goes
text: down, he WAILS on the SCARY GUY with the steel guitar leg. It

speaker_heading: LILLIE
dialog: Think I care ... I’m doing

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Well, I suppose you’re right, dear.

speaker_heading: HANK (cont'd)
dialog: Now draw you god awful tiki wiki
dialog: shit.
text: A moment passes. Audrey steps back on to the porch. She walks
text: slowly towards Hank, who just stares, the pistol hanging by
dialog: his side.
text: Close enough to embrace, but a thousand miles away from each

speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Hank Williams ... I’1l never live

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Vice squad guy in El Paso gave me
dialog: that one ... but be careful now
dialog: buddy, lot of folks get killed with
text: unloaded pistolas.
text: Hank goes to a pretty young blonde, 28, BOBBI JETT. She
text: stares at him sweetly and reaches for the beer he’s holding.
text: Instead, he takes a long slow gulp, almost drains it. His
text: eyes never leave her.
speaker_heading: BOBBI JETT
dialog: You're evil, you know it ...
text: Just then Hank reaches in his jacket pocket, takes out a
text: fresh cold one, offers it to her. Just as she reaches for it,
text: he pulls it back, laughing. She grabs his arm, pries it loose
text: and mock angry, struts off.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: LATER. Party has thinned out. Bobbi stands in doorway talking

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: (reading another paper)
dialog: “,.. but by the spring of 1951, his

speaker_heading: RAY PRICE

speaker_heading: HANK

text: an AREA where the OPRY GUESTS sit.
text: And there he sees BILLIE JEAN ESHLIMAN, a 19 year-old VISION.
text: Ravishing auburn hair, hypnotic green eyes. An off the

text: Hank actually can’t look away. The girl in the front row; her

scene_heading: INT. LON WILLIAMS’ HOUSE - DAY

speaker_heading: HANK

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 125.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He stares down at a pile of newspapers next to it on the
dialog: floor.
text: He kneels. Sees an old Billboard. Opens it to the country
text: charts page. “Jambalaya” near the top.
text: Drops it back on the pile. Stands up. He’s still holding the
text: chocolates. Carefully places them in the chair. He tears off
text: a piece of newspaper, takes a pencil from his coat pocket.
scene_heading: Writes on the PAPER SCRAP:

dialog: cold and as wet as a beavers
dialog: pocket, so he couldn’t fly and
dialog: instead looked around for someone
text: to drive him in his own car. When
dialog: he couldn’t find any friends to
dialog: take him up on that, he called a

dialog: Charleston.
speaker_heading: BILLIE JEAN
dialog: How come I can’t come? I don’t want

dialog: you might get real sick of me and
dialog: we might end up going at each other
dialog: .+. vight?
text: She gives him a look. They hug, he kisses her. Starts to walk
text: away. Comes back.
speaker_heading: HANK (cont'd)
dialog: One more for luck, huh?
text: She comes back kisses him while cradling his cheeks. They
text: pull away, he goes to the car. He smiles at something he’s
dialog: thinking about.
text: He climbs in the car. Charles gets in the drivers seat. Hank
text: rolls down the window.
speaker_heading: BILLIE JEAN
dialog: What are you smiling about?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Well, another reason I don’t think
dialog: you should come is ... I could use
dialog: the leg room.
speaker_heading: BILLIE JEAN
dialog: Go to hell, Hiram Williams.
text: Now she walks back over, kisses him on the cheek.
speaker_heading: BILLIE JEAN (cont'd)
dialog: One more for extra luck.
speaker_heading: HANK

speaker_heading: CHARLES CARR
dialog: Yes ma’am.
text: As the car pulls out. Hank looks back at the house. Lillie
text: has come out on the porch and is waving. He waves back,
