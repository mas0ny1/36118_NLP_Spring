speaker_heading: GLORIA

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: You don't really want to go

speaker_heading: JOHN

dialog: paper. Delicate work.
text: By degrees, pale and indistinct forms appear on the

text: He places a manila envelope on the table between them.
text: She unfastens the clasp, bends back the flap, reaches

dialog: photo.
text: It's grainy, but the faces are unmistakably those of Tom

text: One of them shows Tom and Aurora on the bed, without
dialog: their clothes.
text: Gloria's untroubled look turns abruptly hard.
speaker_heading: BEAUMONT (CONT'D)
dialog: That's one of my favorites.
dialog: Didn't have a hell of a lot of

speaker_heading: BEAUMONT (CONT'D)
dialog: There's a copy of your

speaker_heading: BEAUMONT (CONT'D)
dialog: Genuine coin a' the realm.
text: He takes the bills out, counts them, taps their edges

speaker_heading: GLORIA

speaker_heading: BEAUMONT

speaker_heading: BEAUMONT (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That is reasonable. Your
