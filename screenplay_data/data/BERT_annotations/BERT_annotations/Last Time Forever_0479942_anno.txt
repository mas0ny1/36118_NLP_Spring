text: He places a manila envelope on the table between them.
text: She unfastens the clasp, bends back the flap, reaches

dialog: photo.
text: It's grainy, but the faces are unmistakably those of Tom

speaker_heading: BEAUMONT (CONT'D)
dialog: That's one of my favorites.

speaker_heading: BEAUMONT (CONT'D)
dialog: Genuine coin a' the realm.

speaker_heading: GLORIA

speaker_heading: BEAUMONT

speaker_heading: MASTERSON
dialog: (smiling tightly)
dialog: Let's be reasonable.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That is reasonable. Your

dialog: you're familiar with its
