scene_heading: EXT. SALEM VILLAGE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT |
text: The CAMERA LOOKS DOWN ON the village, nestled in the I
text: valley below. Simple wood-framed houses. Smoking i
text: chimneys. Lighted windows. The night is chilly, thick,
text: spooky. The DOGS of the village are heard BARKING and :
text: HOWLING, upset by something that they understand, even |
dialog: if we don't. i
dialog: LETTERS READ... "Salem, Massachusetts. 1692."
text: Under a full moon a spooky-looking high-eaved little
text: house glowers down at the village from the top of a hill.
text: ‘Smoke rises up out of its chimney, twisting and turning
text: in a very unnatural fashion. This is no ordinary smoke,
dialog: and this is no ordinary house.
text: The CAMERA FINDS something moving through the bushes just
text: below the house and FOLLOWS the source of the motion.
text: Suddenly, the shivering bushes part, and two heads
text: appear. They belong to a pair of local farm children,
text: THACKERY and ELIJAH BINX. Thackery, thirteen, is the
text: older. Elijah, his brether, is ten. Both wear homespun,
text: simple clothing. They peer up at the house, frightened.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THACKERY
dialog: They conjure. Look!
text: He points at the chimney smoke in which the shapes of
text: little demons and beasts can be seen forming and unform-
text: ing in the vapors. Elijah is really scared. Thackery
text: starts crawling toward the house.
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Thackery!
text: But he follows him...
text: CAMERA FOLLOWS the two children, as they crawl through
text: the bramble-filled yard toward the lighted windows of the
text: spooky-looking house. They reach the window and peer in.
speaker_heading: THEIR POV
text: The main room of the house is lit only by the fire in the
text: broad hearth and by candles placed in a circle around the
text: room. ‘The CAULDRON BOILS on the fire as the three
text: Sanderson sisters, WINIFRED, MARY, and SARAH stand around
text: it. Very old, and dressed in the heavy black woolen
dialog: clothing of the era, they look like exactly what they
dialog: are... witches.
text: Winifred is the eldest and by far the most powerful.

text: Once beautiful, her beauty has been corrupted by evil
text: (her fingers have grown talons, her teeth have
text: sharpened), but she is still vain, and she hates
dialog: children for their youth and prettiness.
dialog: Winifred has a nasty temper; when she gets really angry,
text: her -hair stands on end, and she possesses an ability to
text: discharge jolts of electrical energy. Winifred has great
dialog: aril? with potions and spells. She is a very dangerous
dialog: witch.
text: Mary, the middle sister, is obese and gluttonous.
text: Obsessed with food, she possesses the outward manner of a
dialog: sweet as sugar kindly aunt. Mary loves little children.
dialog: She loves them because she loves to eat them. Mary's
dialog: sense of smell is incredibly keen; she can follow the
text: scent of a child like a bloodhound.
text: Sarah, the youngest, is the idiot sister. She's also
dialog: beautiful and sexy. She likes to torture things: small
dialog: animals, children, bugs, you name it. Any suggestion of
text: cruelty (to somebody else) sends her into a fit of idiotic
text: cackling laughter, while any fear for herself sends her
text: into a fit of terrified screaming. She's a mess.
text: The children watch as Winifred reads from the recipe in
dialog: her ancient spell book.
speaker_heading: WINIFRED

text: Thackery and Elijah duck for cover as Sarah, Winifred,

speaker_heading: WINIFRED
dialog: One drop of this, and her life
dialog: will be mine.
