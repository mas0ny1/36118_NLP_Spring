text: This is a composite of NORMA RAE WEBSTER's life, glimpses
text: of her early days, a burgeoning and a metamorphosis:
text: She is seen as an infant, sitting in her bath ina
text: galvanized tub, hair twisted into a kewpie-doll peak,
dialog: beribboned.
text: Norma at seven, front tooth out, a large grin splitting her
dialog: face.
text: At twelve in a bathing suit, a pigeon-toed stance, arms
text: folded self-consciously across her chest.
text: At fifteen, facing front, arrogant now, breasts jutting out,
text: hip cocked.
text: At eighteen, her arm around a sailor's shoulder, wearing
text: his hat at a rakish angle.
text: At twenty on a front porch with a cluster of girls, Norma
text: at the center, mouth black with too much lipstick, holding
text: a ukulele.
text: At twenty-two, holding a bridal bouquet, wearing a floppy
text: hat, perplexed, faintly forlorn, on the edge of the unknown.
text: At twenty-four, defiant, thumbing her nose at a sign reading
dialog: "Simpson's Secretarial School."
text: At twenty-six, sitting with her back against a tree, twe
text: young children tumbled in her lap, looking fond and frazzled.
text: At twenty-eight, in a monkey-pert waitress!’ outfit,
text: balancing a tray, ground lost.
text: At thirty, a photographer's formal portrait, unguarded,
text: beautiful, unfathomable.

speaker_heading: THE MILL 3
text: The place bursts on the SCREEN like a battlefield, full of
text: a jolting, nerve-shattering din. In the enormous space,
text: rows and rows of old WOODEN LOOMS ROAR like waterfalls and
text: shake the floors with ceaseless trembling vibrations. The
text: sound is deafening, the constant punishing, racketing motion
text: disorienting. There are no windows, no sunlight, only
