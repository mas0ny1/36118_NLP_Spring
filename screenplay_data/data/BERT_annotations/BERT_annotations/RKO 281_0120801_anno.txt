scene_heading: INT LARGE, DARK ROOM NIGHT
dialog: 
text: In the ebony shadows of a large room we can make out corners and edges,
text: moldings and cornices; the phantoms of decaying Victorian wealth
text: floating like disembodied ghosts in the darkness.
dialog: 
text: It is May 6, 1924 The harsh flare of a match being struck
dialog: 
text: A shadowy male figure lights a series of nine candles on a birthday
text: cake. Beyond the cake we can see a bed.
dialog: 
text: On the bed lies a woman in her early forties. She is ashen and sickly.
dialog: Dying.
dialog: 
text: The shadowy male figure finishes lighting the candles, blows out the
text: match and disappears as the woman peers into the darkness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Come into the light.. Come into the light
dialog: 
text: A nine-year-old boy steps into the light.
dialog: 
text: She pulls him close and whispers:
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: 
dialog: Never stand in the shadows --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Mother...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: You are made for the light, Orson Now you must blow
dialog: out your candles. But you must always remember, the
text: cake itself is nothing. The flame, the lights, that
dialog: is where your future lies. You must have a dream. A
dialog: great dream worthy of you.
dialog: 
text: The boy immediately spins to the cake and blows out the candles. A
text: moment of darkness. He turns back to the bed. The woman and the bed are
text: gone, faded into darkness.
dialog: 
text: The solemn young lad stares and stares into the darkness
dialog: 
text: And then, magically, the faint glimmer of twinkling stars fill his huge
text: dark eyes.
dialog: 
text: NEWSREEL The flickering images of an old newsreel, circa 1940
dialog: 
text: Under the MGM logo we see the title: BOY WONDER WOWS HOLLYWOOD!
dialog: 
text: The first image after the title is the imposing figure of ORSON WELLES,
text: climbing down from an airplane and surveying the world at his feet.
dialog: 
text: Welles is 24 years old and somewhat handsome. Welles seems rather
text: uncomfortable in his own body, as if it could not possibly contain his
text: vast passions and appetites.
dialog: 
text: Orson Welles is man who tears his way through life with incendiary
text: energy. He is at once inspiring and ferocious; visionary and coldly
text: ambitious. He is part artist, part fraud and all showman.
dialog: 
text: A sonorous voice accompanies the newsreel. The voice is always grand,
text: occasionally sardonic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEWSREEL VOICE
text: He came to the town of magic and dreams a flashing
text: star blazing through the firmament of illusion. And
dialog: he promised to devour the world in a single gulp. He
dialog: was 24 years old and his name was George Orson
dialog: Welles. Sound the trumpets! Unfurl the banners,
dialog: Hollywood! The Boy Wonder has arrived!
dialog: 
text: Images of Welles as a baby and his early life fill the screen: Welles
text: in a crib; as a pampered schoolboy; at dance class; drama club; dressed
text: up for a magic show. As we hear:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEWSREEL VOICE
text: He made his debut on the world stage in Kenosha,
dialog: Wisconsin, on the 6th of May, 1915. And on the 7th
dialog: of May he spoke his first words, and unlike other
dialog: children who say commonplace things like "momma" and
dialog: "poppa", he proclaimed "I am a genius!"
dialog: 
dialog: At three the genius was reciting Shakespeare and at eight he had taken
text: up cigars and highballs and was learning magic from the knee of the
dialog: great Houdini.
dialog: 
text: Images of Welles' early theatrical career: the young man playing
dialog: impossibly old parts; vaudeville magic shows; various regional
text: theaters; endless tawdry rehearsal rooms
dialog: 
text: Then images of Welles and JOHN HOUSEMAN in New York: the great,
text: bustling city; Welles at work with John Houseman on a script; Welles
text: directing a play. As we hear:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEWSREEL VOICE
dialog: So how could the magic of the stage not call to
dialog: this adventurous lad? Unstoppable and resolute, the
dialog: Boy Wonder journeyed into the world of the legit
text: theater. After a peripatetic beginning he found
text: himself at last in New York where he joined forces
dialog: with theatrical producer John Houseman under the
text: august auspices of the WPA Federal Theater.
dialog: 
text: A rehearsal room interview with John Houseman, who is in his 30's,
text: thin-lipped and prim:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOUSEMAN
text: Orson barreled in and took over. Orson's a real
dialog: barreler.
dialog: 
text: Images of Welles directing his famous "Fascist JULIUS CAESAR" and
dialog: "Voodoo MACBETH" productions: auditions; rehearsals; perfecting a
text: sword-fight; rejecting classical costume sketches for JULIUS CAESAR;
text: supervising set construction; performing Brutus in the Albert Speer-
text: like Nuremberg rally lighting of JULIUS CAESAR. As we hear:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEWSREEL VOICE
text: Like Hannibal over the Alps, the Boy Genius invaded
text: the Great White Way. He stunned the sedate elite of
dialog: New York theatre with production after production.
text: From MACBETH with an entirely colored cast to a
dialog: Mussolini-inspired JULIUS CAESAR!
dialog: 
text: More images of New York, Welles, Houseman and radio: Welles directing a
text: radio play with sweeping energy; supervising the elaborate sound
text: effects; editing the script; at odds with Houseman. As we hear:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEWSREEL VOICE
dialog: Though he wowed the critics with his spectaculars
dialog: the ticket sales left something to be desired. So,
dialog: after founding the Mercury Players with Houseman,
text: young Mr. Welles quickly set his sights on the
text: airwaves. He quickly became the sonorous -' voice of
dialog: "The Shadow." ''
dialog: 
text: Newsreel footage of Welles at a standing radio microphone;
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The
dialog: Shadow knows. . .
dialog: 
text: Welles laughs his sinister Shadow laugh and we go to more images of
text: radio and the dynamic Welles performing and directing as we hear:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEWSREEL VOICE
text: With Lament Cranston in one pocket and his own
dialog: radio show. The Mercury Theater of the Air, our Boy
text: Wonder filled the night with his resounding tones.
dialog: And on October 30th of 1938, he became what he felt
dialog: destined to be: a household name.
dialog: 
text: What started out as a roguish Halloween prank became the most famous
dialog: radio show in the history of the galaxy!
dialog: 
text: Images of the WAR OF THE WORLDS broadcast and panic: listeners huddling
text: next to their radios; telephone switchboards lighting up; New Jersey
text: State Motorcycle Troopers zooming down rural roads; cars clogging the
dialog: highways. As we hear:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEWSREEL VOICE
dialog: THE WAR OF THE WORLDS sent this nation spinning
text: into a frenzy. Nine million listeners clasped their
text: loved ones close and looked to the skies with
text: horror. Unlucky listeners near the epicenter of the
text: "invasion" -- rural New Jersey -- ran screaming into
text: the night, sure a monstrous alien and a fiery death
dialog: awaited them around every corner! The mischievous
dialog: Boy Wonder had fooled us all!
dialog: 
text: Newsreel footage of a packed press conference with Welles the day
dialog: following the broadcast:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (contritely)
dialog: Of course ... of course ... if I had known the
dialog: panic the broadcast was causing -- well I would have
dialog: stopped! I never meant for any of this to happen and
dialog: I feel just horrible!
dialog: 
text: Quick newsreel clips of Welles leaving the press conference with
text: Houseman. We see them slip into a taxi. Inside the taxi we can just
text: glimpse Welles exploding with laughter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEWSREEL VOICE
dialog: How long, oh how long could it possibly be before
dialog: the sunny land of dreams tried to harness the
dialog: combustible power of this showman, this impresario,
dialog: this best of all possible Boy Wonders?!
dialog: 
text: Images of Welles posing and shaking hands with GEORGE
speaker_heading: SCHAEFER
dialog: 
text: Schaefer is an intense, compact man in his early 50's. His nickname in
dialog: Hollywood is "The Tiger" -- both for his admired tenacity and his
dialog: feared temper. He is a moral and ethical man; John Adams in a Brooks
dialog: Brothers suit.
dialog: 
dialog: As we hear
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEWSREEL VOICE
dialog: The winner in the Welles derby was George Schaefer,
text: the head of RKO Pictures. With a contract
dialog: unimaginable before The Days Of Orson, Mr. Schaefer
text: captured the whirlwind snared the beast, roped the
dialog: tyrant!
dialog: 
text: Images of Welles and Schaefer: Welles signing his contract; smiling to
text: Schaefer; Schaefer making a speech; Welles joking with reporters. As we
dialog: hear:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEWSREEL VOICE
text: Eyebrows raised and jaws dropped all over
dialog: Hollywoodland when the terms of the deal that lured
dialog: The Great Orson came forth: the Boy Wonder could
dialog: produce, write, direct and star in his own projects
dialog: with budgets up to $500,000 a picture! He would have
dialog: total control over the shooting of the picture and
dialog: the finished product. The studio, well, they just
text: paid the bills. Meanwhile, the insiders of filmland
dialog: were skeptical.
dialog: 
text: An interview with a Hollywood Insider, who looks like a bookie:
dialog: 
scene_heading: HOLLYWOOD INSIDER
dialog: John Ford doesn't have a deal like that. Cecil B.
dialog: DeMille doesn't have a deal like that. No one has a
dialog: deal like that! If ya ask me, George Schaefer is
dialog: just plain nuts
dialog: 
text: Images of Welles arriving in Hollywood and touring the town: Welles
text: climbing down from a plane; posing with Schaefer before of the RKO
text: gates; touring the studio; leaning over an editing machine; laughing
text: with female extras in the commissary; posing in front of his Brentwood
dialog: home. As we hear:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEWSREEL VOICE
dialog: So Cometh Orson! He toured the RKO studio and met
dialog: with the biggest of the big! He charmed his way
text: through the town from the Brown Derby to the
dialog: Copacabana, from the Pacific Palisades to the
dialog: Hollywood Hills!
dialog: 
text: More images of Welles in Hollywood: Welles touring the town; visiting
text: all the nightclubs and dancing with beautiful women; he is seen
text: everywhere about the town. As we hear:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEWSREEL VOICE
dialog: Yes, the Boy Wonder had arrived! He even charmed
dialog: those rival maidens of Hollywood gossip, those well-
dialog: coiffured chroniclers of the dream factory: Hedda
dialog: Hopper and Louella Parsons.
dialog: 
text: Shots of Welles with LOUELLA PARSONS and HEDDA HOPPER
dialog: 
text: Louella is a much-feared gossip columnist. She is a gorgon in her 60's;
text: Margaret Dumont possessed by the devil and tanked up on gin. Her
text: capricious cruelty is only matched by her fervent loyalty to all things
dialog: Hearstian.
dialog: 
text: Hedda is a gossip columnist in her 50's. She is given to elaborate hats
text: and villainous intrigue. Louella's younger, smarter rival, Hedda
text: probably spends her spare time eating children.
dialog: 
text: Then a snippet of an interview with Louella:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUELLA
dialog: Orson is the sweetest boy. We're both from the
dialog: midwest, you know. He's just a local fella making
dialog: good, ya follow?
dialog: 
text: More shots of Welles just after his arrival in Hollywood, blissfully
dialog: touring the RKO facilities as:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEWSREEL VOICE
dialog: So today, almost a year after his arrival in
dialog: Hollywood, we leave the Boy Wonder still hard at
dialog: work developing his much-anticipated first feature,
text: preparing to dazzle us all again. We're waiting,
dialog: Orson!
dialog: 
text: Welles after his RKO tour, smiling mischievously, stands before a
dialog: microphone:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I'll tell you what, this is the best electric train
dialog: set a boy ever had!
dialog: 
dialog: "The End" and newsreel credits
dialog: 
text: The newsreel sputters to a stop in a screening room. A shaft of light
text: shines on a large MGM logo on one wall. Another shaft of light
text: illuminates the sitting figure of LOUIS B. MAYER.
dialog: 
text: Mayer is a short, crafty, bespectacled man in his 50's. His cloying,
text: avuncular exterior only fleetingly disguises the film titan's
text: outrageous barbarism.
dialog: 
text: Another shadowy figure, a Mayer FLUNKIE, can be just glimpsed sitting
text: elsewhere in the screening room.
dialog: 
text: Mayer glowers at the darkened screen for a moment.
dialog: 
text: A beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAYER
dialog: Who does that cocksucker think he is?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLUNKIE
dialog: They're laying bets over on the RKO
dialog: lot that this great deal will end up
dialog: with him never doing a picture. Back
dialog: to New York he goes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAYER
dialog: Serves him right. I mean can you stomach the
dialog: arrogance?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLUNKIE
text: Inside skinny says the glory boy's finished,
dialog: can't come up with a movie. Wants to do a biography now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAYER
dialog: After RKO boots him maybe we'll pick him up cheap.
dialog: Have him do that WAR OF THE WORLDS crap as a
dialog: feature.
dialog: 
text: Meantime, shelve the newsreel. No one cares
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT SAN SIMEON. WELLES' SUITE EVENING
dialog: 
text: Orson Welles, elegant and impressive, is flourishing a cigarette and a
text: coin in his magnificently expressive hands He is perfecting a magic
dialog: trick.
dialog: 
text: Welles is lounging on the bed of an enormous guest suite at San Simeon.
text: He is wearing a tuxedo.
dialog: 
text: In the bathroom beyond him we can see the writer HERMAN MANKIEWICZ
speaker_heading: ("MANK". )
dialog: 
text: Mank is a wonderful wreck of a human being. 43 years old, but looking
text: considerably older, he is short and squat and bitter. A compulsive
text: gambler and drinker, Mank still glimmers with wry humor that is equally
text: wicked and corrosive. He is incomplete without the stub of a cigar
text: clenched in his teeth.
dialog: 
text: Mank, also dressed in a tuxedo, is looking at himself in the bathroom
text: mirror as he struggles with his bow tie. He occasionally glances in the
dialog: mirror to Welles.
dialog: 
scene_heading: Title: JANUARY 3, 1940
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: I don't know what you expected with Joseph-
dialog: fucking-Conrad for Chrissake. I mean this is
dialog: Hollywood, pal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer
dialog: and RKO. I've heard it from everyone--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap -
dialog: - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! -
dialog: - no one wants to see that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Nonsense
dialog: 
text: Welles dramatically taps the cigarette on the coin, practicing his
dialog: trick as:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: What are movies about, Orson?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Forget it-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: What are movies about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
text: Telling stories.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: Nope.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Showing life
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: Who the hell wants to see life?! People are sick to
dialog: death of life! They want make-believe, pal. Fantasy.
dialog: They want Tarzan and Jane, not Tristan and Isolde.
dialog: 
text: Welles quickly makes the cigarette seem to completely pass through the
text: coin. An astounding bit of slight of hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (happily)
dialog: Magic
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You
dialog: got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same
dialog: job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You
dialog: gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all
text: about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Not for me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: Then you better get ready to be the youngest never-
dialog: was in Hollywood history.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: That's better than being the oldest has-been in
dialog: Hollywood history.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: You're a laugh-riot, kid.
dialog: 
text: Welles laughs and goes to Mank in the bathroom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Here, turn around.
dialog: 
text: Welles ties Mank's bow tie for him as:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: So, we've got to come up with our movie. Our
dialog: biography.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: Right-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: We find the man and then we dissect him-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
text: Like a bug.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: But with compassion and insight--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: (glancing at his watch)
dialog: Christ, we gotta go! The old man doesn't cotton to
dialog: lateness.
dialog: 
text: Mank takes a quick swig from a flask of vodka, shoves it into his coat
text: and scurries into the other room as Welles checks himself in the
dialog: mirror.
dialog: 
text: A beat. Welles smiles, confident and resplendent
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (into the mirror)
dialog: How do you do, Mr. Hearst? My name is Orson
dialog: Welles.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT SAN SIMEON. HALLWAY FOLLOWING
dialog: 
text: Welles and Mank walk through an impressive upstairs hallway of San
text: Simeon. Quick glimpses of the astounding grandeur everywhere around
dialog: them as:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: How about Howard Hughes? We could do Hughes
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would
dialog: kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
dialog: 
text: They disappear down a long stairway
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT SAN SIMEON. DINING HALL EVENING
dialog: 
text: An explosion of color and an immediate swirl of sound
dialog: 
text: We are in the Grand Refectory -- the mammoth dining room -- at San
text: Simeon. Five long tables are placed end to end. There are about fifty
text: sumptuously dressed guests.
dialog: 
text: WILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARST and MARION DAVIES preside, side by side,
dialog: at the
text: center table.
dialog: 
text: Hearst is 76 years old. He is a fully commanding figure, towering in
text: both height (six foot two) and personality. He is shaped rather like a
text: pear and moves with a delicacy surprising for such a famously merciless
text: man. Although the word ruthless does not begin to do justice to the
text: press baron's animus, Hearst is endlessly polite and almost painfully
text: soft-spoken.
dialog: 
text: Marion is 43 years old, a shimmering and lively presence. In a word
text: that might have been coined for her, she has moxie. While the ravages
dialog: of alcoholism have left their subtle marks on the edges and attitudes
text: of her face, she can still charm and captivate with almost effortless
dialog: grace.
dialog: 
text: Around Hearst's feet sit a collection of his beloved dachshunds.
dialog: 
text: On the other side of the main table, and down a bit, sit Welles and
dialog: Mank.
dialog: 
text: We sweep around the table, hearing bits of overlapping dialogue and
text: finally settle on Marion and Hearst.
dialog: 
text: Marion is charming CAROLE LOMBARD and CLARK GABLE, who sit beside
dialog: her.
text: She tenderly rests one hand on Hearst's arm as she speaks. Marion
text: speaks with an occasionally pronounced stutter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: And we would hear them scuttling around at night
text: with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t-
dialog: teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all
dialog: over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere.
dialog: And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung
dialog: but no mice!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAROLE LOMBARD
dialog: Houdini mice.
dialog: 
dialog: Laughter
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: Just wait. So one night I notice Pops getting outta
dialog: bed and sneaking away. And he's got this little p-p-
dialog: paper bag with him, right? Middle of the night. So I
dialog: figure the old man's really up to no good this time
dialog: and I follow him. Well I'll be g-g-goddamned if he's
text: not springing all the traps and leaving cheese for
dialog: the rats!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: You and that freak Disney, in love with the damn
dialog: rats!
dialog: 
text: Laughter, even from Hearst
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEARST
dialog: They really are sweet little things
dialog: 
text: Meanwhile, across the table Welles is rapaciously devouring his dinner
dialog: as:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Sigmund Freud?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: Kid, you just got your ass kicked on Joseph Conrad
dialog: and now you're gonna go to Schaefer and tell him you
dialog: wanna do the id and the superego? Stop being so
dialog: goddamn smart.
dialog: 
text: Mank surreptitiously pours a huge shot of vodka from his flask into his
dialog: glass as:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (suddenly inspired)
dialog: Manolete?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: Who the hell's Manolete?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: The great Spanish bullfighter
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: I don't wanna write about no spic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: No, it's perfect! When in doubt, put on a cape!
text: False noses and faux beards and flowing capes have
dialog: been the life-blood of the actor's craft since the
text: days of lrving and Booth. (He flourishes his napkin
dialog: like a bullfighter's cape.) Imagine me in a
text: glittering suit of lights on the dusky Andalusian
dialog: plains--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: Why Mr. Welles is attempting semaphore
dialog: 
text: Welles smiles across the table.
dialog: 
text: Laughter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Bullfighting, Miss Davies!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: And is dear Mank your b-b-bull?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: My factotum, ally and comrade-in-arms
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: Writer, flunkie, pimp--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAROLE LOMBARD
dialog: (wry)
dialog: You fight many bulls there in New York, Orson?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Ever met Walter Winchell?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
text: (expansively, warming into a story)
dialog: No, when I was but a tender lad--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAROLE LOMBARD
dialog: Last week would this be?
dialog: 
text: Laughter. As Welles speaks the whole table gradually stops eating and
dialog: listens to his tale:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: My father and I made a tour of the grand boulevards
dialog: of antique Europe. And when we were in Iberia I had
text: the chance to face the bulls. At the knee of the
dialog: great Manolete I took up the cape and sword -
text: (he uses his napkin and knife to
dialog: demonstrate)
text: -- across from me stood a mammoth bull reputed to
dialog: have gored a full seven men to a grisly demise! So -
dialog: - with Manolete shouting encouragement I flourished
dialog: . . . I flourished again . . . and the bull charged!
text: Across the golden dust it came, thundering like the
text: great minotaur of legend, closer, ever closer, its
text: calamitous hooves pounding into the dirt, shaking
text: the earth as I held the crimson eye of the bull with
text: my own, defying it -- it was almost upon me and I
dialog: flourished one last time! -- the monster swept past!
dialog: -
text: (he spins his napkin in the air and his
dialog: knife is now gone, a magic trick)
dialog: -- and my sword was gone -- buried in the bloody
dialog: eye of the beast!
dialog: 
text: Applause and laughter from around the table. Then:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEARST
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: You are evidently a man who knows a great deal
dialog: about bull.
dialog: 
text: Some nervous titters. A beat as Welles' smile fades and he stares at
dialog: Hearst.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEARST
dialog: Of all man's malignity -- of all his sadism -- none
text: is more depraved than cruelty to animals.
dialog: 
dialog: Silence
dialog: 
text: Mank gives Welles a desperate warning look to keep quiet Welles cannot
dialog: resist speaking:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: In Spain the cruelty would be in denying the beast
text: a fighting end.
dialog: 
text: A beat as Hearst rivets Welles with a cold, bland stare Deafening
text: silence around the table.
dialog: 
dialog: Then:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEARST
dialog: Who are you, sir?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: My name is Orson Welles
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEARST
dialog: The actor
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: And director.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEARST
dialog: I see. And you are in California for what reason?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: To make pictures.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEARST
dialog: And what pictures have you made?
dialog: 
text: A beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: None.
dialog: 
text: A beat. Hearst smiles
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEARST
dialog: Well, I wish you luck. It is a treacherous
dialog: business.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: So I've been told.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEARST
dialog: In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most
dialog: brutally killed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I'll remember that.
dialog: 
text: A tense beat. Marion quickly diffuses the situation;
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: Enough Hollywood talk! Can't anyone talk about
dialog: anything else?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANX
dialog: Heard some juicy gossip from Metro.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: (eagerly)
dialog: Ooh, dish.
dialog: 
text: Laughter. Even from Hearst. Then the dinner chatter continues.
dialog: 
text: Welles cannot keep his eyes off Hearst, the press baron draws Welles in
text: like a siren.
dialog: 
text: Marion gives Hearst a little kiss and grabs Carole Lombard and they
text: leave the table. Hearst leans into Clark Gable to continue talking.
dialog: 
text: Welles sits back and reaches for a cigar. Mank takes his arm and
text: indicates he should stop, nodding his head in Hearst's direction.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES

scene_heading: INT SAN SIMEON. WELLES' SUITE NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Welles, again dressed in a tuxedo, lies on his bed
dialog: 
text: Through the open balcony doors he can hear the eerie sound of lions
text: roaring and elephants trumpeting in the night.
dialog: 
text: He stand and wanders to the balcony. Below him he can see bits and
text: pieces of Hearst's private zoo in the moonlight: a lion pacing
text: relentlessly back and forth; an alligator slipping into the water; a
text: monkey slamming into the bars of its cage.
dialog: 
text: The disquieting sounds of the menagerie float through the midnight air.
dialog: 
text: Welles leaves his suite
dialog: 
text: INT SAN SIMEON. HALLWAYS FOLLOWING
dialog: 
text: Welles roams the seemingly endless hallways of San Simeon. In the half-
text: light they begin to resemble his own cinematic dream-palace, Xanadu.
dialog: 
text: He hears the ghostly echo of a song, "WHERE OR WHEN".
dialog: 
text: He curiously follows the sound, taking in the fabulous castle
text: everywhere around him.
dialog: 
text: He passes by the door to the Assembly Room. Inside, shafts of light
text: illuminate portions of huge, uncompleted jigsaw puzzles.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT SAN SIMEON. BALLROOM FOLLOWING
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Below him a phonograph record spins lazily on a turntable standing of
text: the floor of the deserted ballroom.
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT WELLES' HOUSE. POOL DAY
dialog: 
text: Welles, wrapped in a bathrobe, is pacing quickly around the perimeter
text: of his backyard pool. He is puffing on a cigar and grunting to himself
text: as he scribbles down notes.
dialog: 
text: Mank, wearing sunglasses and a battered fedora and looking decidedly
text: hung-over, comes from the house to the pool.
dialog: 
text: Welles roars up to him:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Mank! You scoundrel! What took you so long?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK

speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I know who we're going to get I The great American

dialog: This better be good
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
text: Image a man that has shaped his time. A titanic
dialog: figure of limitless influence. Think about empire. A
text: man with an empire at his feet. A man, like a baron,
text: living in a palace, a glorious palace on a hill, and
dialog: controlling the permutations of everyone beneath
dialog: him. Feudal.

speaker_heading: MANK

speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Now remember he's a public figure who sought out
dialog: that publicity so legally he can't stop us from--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: (laughs coldly) Listen to you. You
dialog: child! Men like him don't bother with
dialog: things like legality. They don't have to.
dialog: You know why, boy-o? Power. Power
dialog: like you couldn't even begin to imagine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he
dialog: would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: We're doing Hearst.
dialog: 
text: A beat. Mank slowly removes his sunglasses and leans forward, dead
dialog: serious.
dialog: 
text: A beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: You may think you know what you're talking about,
dialog: kid, but believe me, you don't. You're talking about
dialog: going into a battle you can never win on a
dialog: battlefield so far above things like movies and
dialog: Hollywood that Hearst won't even have to glance down
dialog: when he crushes you. When he flicks you away with
dialog: one finger. I'm talking about money and influence
dialog: and evil beyond your capacity to imagine Hell.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Mank leaps to his feet
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: It feels just fine, you pompous fuck-
dialog: 
text: Welles blocks Mank's way. Mank retreats. Welles pursues him around the
dialog: pool as:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I remember a man who wrote I He was a brilliant
dialog: writer who dazzled me time and time again with his
dialog: wit and insight--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES

dialog: four years--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: Don't do this
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (savagely)
dialog: --Because he has been so furiously busy wasting
text: himself. Amusing his keepers. Because he is a
dialog: sycophant! Because he has been thrown out of every
dialog: studio in Hollywood and no one will hire him because
dialog: he's a drunk- -!
dialog: 
text: Mank spins on him:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
text: AND YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A GODDAMN PHONY! What is all
dialog: this "Orson Welles" bullshit?! This boy genius
dialog: crap?! What the fuck did you ever CREATE? You're
dialog: just another goddamn ACTOR!
dialog: 
text: Welles shoves Mank violently. Mank goes sailing into the pool.
dialog: 
text: Mank splashes to the surface and stands for a shocked moment and then
text: wades to the edge of the pool. Miraculously, and like the true drinker
text: he is, Mank is still holding his glass of juice and vodka, now
text: supplemented with pool water.
dialog: 
text: Welles stands above him, blocking his exit from the pool. From this low
text: angle Welles suddenly looks startlingly Kane- like.
dialog: 
dialog: A pause

speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Listen to me-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: Fuck you--

speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: (suddenly)
dialog: I don't have it anymore?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: When I was a kid I wanted to scorch the world too -
dialog: - I had all kinda dreams about making great pictures
dialog: and telling great stories. But all that's finished
dialog: for me--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: It doesn't have to be
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been
dialog: keeping notes on him for years for my ...

dialog: great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I'll hire you -- right now-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: I can't do it. okay?! I drink too much -- I drink

dialog: All that is over for me--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (roars)
dialog: NOT UNLESS I. TELL YOU IT IS
dialog: 
text: A tense pause
dialog: 
text: Welles kneels by the edge of the pool, effortlessly switching gears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (deeply)
dialog: Look, Mank, this is our only chance
dialog: 
dialog: I know this is the story. And now is the time. And I cannot do it
dialog: without you. Everything in my life -- all the promise and potential and
dialog: dreams -- have led to this moment right now. To you and me. Right here.
dialog: 
text: A pause. Welles gazes at Mank, imploring
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: He'll destroy us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Then let him. What have we got to lose, you and I?
dialog: 
text: A long beat Welles leans close to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Take my hand, Mank. And we'll dance one last time.
dialog: We'll dance to the music of the angels. We'll make
dialog: history. We'll scorch the earth. We will ...
dialog: astonish them all.
dialog:

scene_heading: INT WELLES' LIVING ROOM DAY
dialog: 
text: Mank is slowly sharpening a series of pencils with a pocket knife,
text: blank pads waiting. Welles is standing across the room from him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: So, who is he? We have to know him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: Everyone sees someone different. That's what we
dialog: show.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: How?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: Like a jewel. Turn it in the light and a different

dialog: 
text: Mank finishes sharpening his last pencil and picks up a pad He smiles
dialog: to Welles
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: Go
dialog: 
text: And we leap into MONTAGE -- WELLES AND MANK BRAINSTORM
dialog: 
text: A rush of jazzy. Gene Krupa percussion as Welles and Mank develop their
dialog: story.
dialog: 
text: We see images of feverish creativity. Welles raging, pleading, arguing,
text: pushing. Mank responding, laughing, drinking, writing.
dialog: 
text: It is a passionate dance of creation Welles' tennis court Mank and
text: Welles are on the tennis court, but hard at work.
dialog: 
text: Mank waits for Welles to serve. Welles bounces the tennis ball, but is
dialog: too preoccupied to serve as:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this
dialog: man recall on his death bed? Okay, Mank, you're
dialog: dying. What's the last image that comes to you?
dialog: Right now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word
dialog: to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Why her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: She was . . . innocent
dialog: 
text: A beat, Welles deep in thought. Mank watches Welles closely.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: So when was our man innocent? Was there a moment
dialog: early on -- of innocence and bliss? There must have
dialog: been. Okay, you're dying - what do you think?
dialog: 
text: Welles does not answer. He continues to bounce the tennis ball, deep in
dialog: thought.
dialog: 
dialog: A beat
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: (probing)
dialog: Something you lost maybe?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: Something you can never get back?
dialog: 
text: Mank watches as Welles lets the tennis ball drop. It bounces and rolls
text: -- for a fleeting moment in Welles' mind it seems to become the rolling
text: snow globe from KANE -- we hear the sound of sleigh bells and a child's
text: happy voice -- in the snow globe we seem to see a boy laughing and
text: pelting his father with snowballs. . .
dialog: 
text: Then more images, mad and outlandish and sedate and solemn; in the
text: kitchen, in a car, around the pool, in a bar.
dialog: 
text: Welles and Mank act out scenes and argue. They leap from character to
text: character fearlessly. Emoting and laughing and writing. We see the twin
text: joy and terror of walking the tightrope, of sheer creation.
dialog: 
text: We see them having a ferocious argument. They scream back and forth
text: angrily and then Mank storms out and slams the door. Welles stands
text: alone in his living room, he catches a glimpse of his own reflection in
text: a mirror and we hear:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK'S VOICE
dialog: Men like Hearst don't love..
dialog: 
text: Welles' living room: Welles is slowly advancing on Mank.
dialog: 
text: Mank sits, watching Welles approach. The living room is now filthy.
text: Papers and sketches and gin bottles are discarded everywhere around
text: them, a thick cloud of cigar smoke. It is very late at night and the
text: room is in semi-darkness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: All men love. But men like Hearst -- they don't
dialog: bother with convention because--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: They don't have to.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
text: He loves in his own way. On his conditions. Because
dialog: those are the only conditions he has ever known.
dialog: 
text: Welles is now standing over Mank, a dark figure in silhouette. Mank
text: soaks in this somewhat ominous image.
dialog: 
text: More music and images: eating and working; swimming and working;
text: playing and working simultaneously.
dialog: 
dialog: Then: Beach:
dialog: 
text: Sunset. We see them walking along a deserted beach Welles is walking in
text: the surf, his trousers rolled.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (quietly)
text: Hearst looks down at the world at his feet
dialog: Everything has always been beneath him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: And what does he see?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
text: The people. When they pay him homage, he adores
dialog: them. But when they have the ... audacity to
dialog: question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then
dialog: he despises them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: And when he looks up? What does he dream about?
dialog: 
dialog: 31
dialog: 
text: Welles stops and looks up. A thousand stars twinkle above him. They are
text: reflected in his eyes.
dialog: 
text: A long pause as he does not answer Mank Then

speaker_heading: MANK

scene_heading: INT THE BROWN DERBY DAY\NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The chic Brown Derby restaurant is the unquestioned palace of Hollywood
text: celebrities. The smug big-wigs and desperate hangers-on circulate and
text: score points in the Great Game of Movie Gossip.
dialog: 
text: In one corner booth sits Hedda Hopper, phoning in the latest salacious
text: gossip to her newspaper. In the other corner booth Louella Parsons does
text: the same. They occasionally glance back and forth at each other like
text: ravenous hyenas eyeing the last bit of carrion.
dialog: 
text: Welles circulates between them. In a scene reminiscent of the famous
text: CITIZEN KANE breakfast table scene with Kane and Emily, we shoot back
text: and forth as Welles applies his considerable charm to both women.
dialog: 
text: Welles is dressed differently with each of them; breakfast with Hedda
dialog: and dinner with Louella.
dialog: 
dialog: With Hedda, morning:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES (CONT.)
dialog: ... And I said, "Mr. Toland, you are the finest
dialog: cinematographer in Hollywood, why would you desire
dialog: to work with a stumbling neophyte?"
dialog: 
dialog: With Louella, night
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES

dialog: anything new is to work with someone who doesn't

dialog: Hedda, this movie is going to look like no other
dialog: picture ever made.
dialog: 
dialog: With Louella, night:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Tome it's a question of truth and illusion. Don't
dialog: you get tired of the errant falsity in motion
dialog: pictures?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUELLA
dialog: Huh?

speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: What we are going to do is shoot life -- in all
dialog: it's joyous complexity.
dialog: 
text: He takes out a coin and begins a magic trick
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Consider this quarter, my dear. You can touch it
dialog: and feel it and were you to lean forward you could
dialog: even smell it. Why is it that in the movies a simple
dialog: bit of reality -- a quarter, a room, a man--
dialog: 
dialog: With Hedda, morning:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
text: Becomes nothing but a lie? A trick. An illusion.
dialog: 
text: He makes the quarter 'completely disappear. Hedda is charmed
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I will show the reality behind the trick.
dialog: 
text: He makes the quarter appear again and shows the guts of the trick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I will use the illusions of Hollywood to show . . .
dialog: the truth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEDDA
dialog: What does truth have to do with movies?
dialog: 
dialog: With Louella, night
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUELLA
dialog: (confused)
dialog: So, what, it went into your other hand?
dialog: 
dialog: With Hedda, morning:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
text: And so the dreamer awakens into the realms of
text: reality. He has been given a rendition of the truth.
dialog: He has been treated with respect.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEDDA
dialog: Orson, that's all terribly interesting but what's
dialog: all this about you and Dolores Del Rio? Do I hear
dialog: love birds a'singin'?
dialog: 
text: Welles sighs. With Louella, night:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUELLA
dialog: Now, Orson, you know I'm just dyin' to see your
dialog: picture and I know it's gonna be boffo, but you're
dialog: writing about a publisher, right?

dialog: We're using-

dialog: Good God no! The character is a delicious

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUELLA
dialog: A delicious amalgamation, is it?
dialog: 
text: He leans forward to light her cigarette as:
dialog:

dialog: That's right. A symphony of those: vaunted and

speaker_heading: WELLES
text: It's 350 pages long.

speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: Yeah, but the margins are real wide.

speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It's

dialog: exactly . . .
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think
dialog: we need to change the name.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: The title?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from
dialog: God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that!
dialog: I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster
dialog: Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I
dialog: was thinking about "Kane" -- you like that?

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: There. That's right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEARST
dialog: She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: (not looking up)
dialog: Nuts. She only cares about the money. She thinks
dialog: I'll make you cut her out of the w-w-w-w...

scene_heading: INT SCHAEFER'S OFFICE. RKO LOT DAY
dialog: 
text: Welles paces before Schaefer's massive desk with typical combustible
text: energy. Behind the desk, huge picture windows show the bustling
dialog: activities of the RKO lot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: It's an awful title, of course, but I can't think
dialog: of anything better. Someone came up with A SEA OF
text: UPTURNED FACES -- which has a nice, grand ring to it
dialog: -- and I thought of JOHN CITIZEN, USA but that
dialog: strikes me as a bit Warner Brothers. Or, God forbid,
dialog: Capraesque. I suppose AMERICAN will do for now but--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCHAEFER
speaker_heading: CITIZEN KANE
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Pardon?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCHAEFER
dialog: CITIZEN KANE There's your title.
dialog: 
dialog: Welles muses
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
text: A "Z" and a "K" in the title. That would draw the
dialog: eye. For the poster. I like that THE PRISONER OF
text: ZENDA had a "Z" and a "P" and that worked--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCHAEFER
dialog: Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
dialog: The budget projections on this--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (theatrically)
dialog: I know, I know! But what more can you expect of
dialog: me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to
dialog: save money but to cut more would be to--!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCHAEFER
dialog: Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've
dialog: stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems
dialog: like, while the stockholders in New York were ready
dialog: to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was
dialog: set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract
dialog: stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's
dialog: gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about
dialog: that?
dialog: 
dialog: A beat
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCHAEFER
dialog: Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think
dialog: again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Jesus
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCHAEFER
dialog: Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's
dialog: happy. You make some money and New York's happy and
dialog: you have a track record and then we'll move on to
speaker_heading: KANE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Please don't ask me to do this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCHAEFER
dialog: It's the safe bet, Orson. There's nothing wrong
dialog: with that.
dialog: 
text: A long pause as Welles leans against a wall, his head down He does not
dialog: look at Schaefer as:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (simply)
dialog: George, I want you to let me make this movie
dialog: because I need to make it. And I don't really know
dialog: why. Afterwards there' II be all the time in the
dialog: world to make money and sell popcorn. And I'll do
dialog: that for you. For RKO and New York. But for now ...
dialog: please let me tell this story.
dialog: 
text: A beat. Welles finally looks up at Schaefer
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: It's your decision, George. If you look into my
dialog: eyes right now and say, go make WAR OF THE WORLDS, I
dialog: will. I'll make it. And, yes, it'll make you money.
dialog: 
dialog: And I honestly can't think of a reason in the world why you should let
dialog: me do KANE other than that you should.
dialog: 
text: A long pause as Schaefer studies Welles. Then
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCHAEFER
dialog: If it'll get you the hell out of my office, go
text: ahead and make the picture.
dialog: 
text: Welles drops his head, too moved to speak.
dialog: 
text: Then he nods to Schaefer and begins to leave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCHAEFER
dialog: Say thank you, Orson.
dialog: 
text: Welles glances at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCHAEFER
dialog: For the title
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Ah, it's a grand title.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES' VOICE
dialog: Together we will throw away all the maps and we

dialog: set...
dialog: 
text: He speeds back and forth and back and forth from the set to the camera
text: in the Campaign Headquarters set, never happy with the shot. . .
dialog: 
text: Gregg Toland watches, bemused, as Welles shifts tiny prop pieces on the
dialog: set. . .
dialog: 
text: Welles bullies and screams and pleads and seduces. Like an obsessed
text: artistic tornado he is seemingly everywhere at once. We see him
text: rejecting matte paintings and in makeup and rewriting the script and
text: trying on costumes and selecting props and leaping into odd positions
text: looking for the perfect camera angle.
dialog: 
text: It is very important in this sequence that we see the pressure building

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: It is the most important line of the picture. You
text: will weave the magic of "Rosebud" in a single word -

dialog: 
text: Then Toland notices something in the catwalks high above the set. A
text: redheaded ELECTRICIAN.
dialog: 
dialog: TOLAND Orson, you see that electrician up there? The redhead.
dialog: He was
text: on GRAPES OF WRATH. He's a free- lance studio spy. Probably reports

dialog: 
text: We see the magnificent film emerging. Welles watching scenes in a
text: screening room, his feet up, exhausted, almost asleep, a cigar dangling
dialog: from his lips...
dialog: 
text: We see rushes of Welles going through scenes with Dorothy Commingore as
text: Susan Alexander. He is relentless with her off camera, driving her to
text: the harridan outbursts he wants just before he steps into the shot...
dialog: 
text: We see the crew observing, with great amusement, Welles' stumbling

dialog: 
text: We see Toland shifting lights to achieve deep-focus cross-fades. Welles

dialog: 
text: We return to the screening room. Welles is now fully asleep. His cigar
text: falls from his mouth and begins smoldering on his suit.
dialog: 
text: "SING, SING, SING" fades at... On a Xanadu set:
dialog: 
text: Filming a scene. Welles, in old-Kane makeup, is sitting with Dorothy
text: Commingore as Susan Alexander. He is curiously distracted. She is
text: pouring tea in the scene:
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOROTHY COMMINGORE
dialog: "Charlie, you sure got the funniest ways of looking
dialog: at things . "
dialog: 
text: Welles does not respond. He breaks character
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: No -- no -- I'll pour the tea. Sorry. I should pour
dialog: the tea. Let's try that again.
dialog: 
text: Toland stands behind the camera and watches Welles. There is obviously
dialog: something wrong.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Okay, here we go... Set. Action
dialog: 
text: Welles pops into character and pours the tea in the scene as:
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOROTHY COMMINGORE
dialog: "Charlie, you sure got the funniest ways of looking
dialog: at things . "
dialog: 
text: Welles stops, breaks character again:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: No -- that's not right
dialog: 
text: He clears his throat and glances at the enormous crew, all staring back
text: at him expectantly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Urn. . . ah . . . yes -- you should definitely pour
dialog: the tea. Okay, again. Sorry.... Set. Action.
dialog: 
text: They start the scene again. She pours the tea
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOROTHY COMMINGORE
dialog: "Charlie, you sure got the funniest ways of looking
dialog: at things . "
dialog: 
text: A pause as she waits for his reply in the scene He sits, frozen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOLAND
dialog: Orson, you wanna take five?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Five...? Yes. No. We're done today
dialog:

dialog: it off.

dialog: 
text: Louella is at her usual corner booth, on the phone to one of her many
text: spies. She is devouring a Cobb salad as she hears:'
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHONE VOICE
dialog: I don't know if this means anything but I just
dialog: talked to a guy in the RKO art department They've
dialog: got all these books and crap all over the place.
dialog: Pictures of San Simeon.

scene_heading: INT WELLES' HOUSE
dialog: 
text: Welles is standing, absolutely lost, in the middle of his living room.
text: He is still in his old-Kane makeup which is just beginning to peel off
text: his face.
dialog: 
text: We hear a low, insistent drum beat, a Gene Krupa riff.
dialog: 
text: We hear the sound of an ice pick chipping into a block of ice. Welles
text: glances around. We are no longer in Welles' living room but at. . .
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT MANK'S HOUSE. SANTA MONICA DAY
dialog: 
text: A turntable spins in a corner, playing a Gene Krupa record. Ashtrays
text: overflow with cigar butts and messy piles of pages are littered around
text: a typewriter.
dialog: 
text: Mank's beach house is tiny and on the edge of squalid
dialog: 
text: Welles, still in his peeling old-Kane makeup, is standing in the middle
text: of the living room and Mank is in the small kitchenette, chipping ice
dialog: for drinks.
dialog: 
text: A long pause
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
text: And I'm looking at them -- and they're all looking
dialog: at me and I don't know who should pour the tea. '
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: Uh huh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I just can't . . see it anymore
dialog: 
text: Mank returns to the living room and thrusts a drink in Welles hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I want you back
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: Fuck you. (He sits.) You wanted me out. I'm out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I'm sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: I don't care.
dialog: 
text: Welles hands Mank a folded script from his jacket. Mank looks at it as:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: This is the shooting script we've been using every
dialog: day.
dialog: 
text: Sure enough, the title page of the script reads: CITIZEN KANE by Herman
dialog: J. Mankiewicz and Orson Welles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: It's just like we always said it would be
dialog: 
text: Mank hands it back
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: Too late, kid.
dialog: 
text: Welles sits.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Did I ever tell you about my father?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: I don't give a shit about-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: He was a drunk. And he was my father and I was
text: ashamed of him.
dialog: 
text: A beat. Welles proceeds quietly and with difficulty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: He showed me the world, he took me with him
dialog: everywhere -- Europe, China -- and he was so proud
dialog: of me. But he would drink and he would get
dialog: ...embarrassing. And I began to resent him Because I
dialog: was so ... sparkling, you see.
dialog: 
text: So I cut him dead. I turned my back and I walked away because I didn't
dialog: need him. He was getting in the way of my "genius." And he would write
dialog: me letters, and I never answered them, and he would call me, and I
dialog: never took his calls, and he showed up at school and I wouldn't see
dialog: him.
dialog: 
text: Tears are beginning to inch down Welles' face
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: When I finally saw him again, he was in a coffin. I
dialog: was fifteen. And all of a sudden he wasn't that
dialog: embarrassing drunk anymore ... he was the man who
dialog: showed me the world.
dialog: 
text: Welles looks up at Mank, tears now streaming down his face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Just like you, Mank.
dialog: 
text: A long beat. Mank, despite himself, is moved.
dialog: 
text: To cover his emotion Mank rises and goes into the kitchen to freshen
text: his drink. We remain tight on Welles as we hear Mank's voice:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK'S VOICE
dialog: So you've lost it? Don't know who should pour the
dialog: tea.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Yeah
dialog: 
dialog: A beat
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK'S VOICE
dialog: Orson ... just cut the goddamn tea
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Okay
dialog: 
text: A beat. Welles reaches for a cigar, tears still wet on his face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK'S VOICE
dialog: I been thinking about the beach scene. You done
dialog: that yet?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: 
dialog: No
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK'S VOICE
dialog: Good -- cause I was thinking that we're starting
dialog: the scene too late...
dialog: 
text: Welles quickly bites off the end of his cigar -- his expression one of
text: "Gotcha!" -- even as. his cheeks are still wet with tears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK'S VOICE (CONT.)
dialog: Cause if we don't show Susan watching Kane more
dialog: then we're not building the right tension into the
dialog: scene. See, she's gotta know that...
dialog: 
text: Welles slowly smiles as the record of Gene Krupa's percussion segues
text: into the unmistakable rhythms of "SING, SING, SING" and eclipses Mank's
dialog: voice...
dialog: 
text: And we see Welles everywhere, more energized than ever: perilous on a
text: high crane; stuck in a cramped corner behind the camera; doing magic
text: tricks for the cast; sleeping as makeup is applied to his face...
dialog: 
dialog: Mank is always at Welles' side: supporting; challenging; amusing;
dialog: inspiring. . .
dialog: 
text: We see Welles strutting, raging, boasting, dancing. And again towering.
dialog: 
text: "SING, SING, SING" finally ends at..
dialog: 
text: Through the black-and-white viewfinder we see Welles, in full costume
text: and makeup, carefully walking across the massive Kane Campaign
text: Headquarters set toward us. We see the low angle black-and-white
text: camera's perspective.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOLAND'S VOICE
dialog: Closer ... closer ... closer -- stop. We just lost
dialog: your head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Can you see my shoes?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOLAND'S VOICE
dialog: Yeah, but we lose your head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Goddamn it Joe -- stand here
dialog: 
text: JOSEPH COTTON, also in full costume and makeup, steps into the shot and
text: takes Welles' position as Welles scurries out of the frame. . ..
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT SOUND STAGE. RKO NIGHT. FOLLOWING
dialog: 
text: Welles marches across the set and squirms into position at the camera,
text: which is right on the floor, and peers up through the viewfinder.
dialog: 
text: Toland lies next to him. Mank stands to one side and- watches.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: It's just not low enough. This is the scene. We
text: have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring
dialog: to the sky. As towering virtues in combat--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOLAND
dialog: Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I need my shoes in total focus right here and also
dialog: Joe back there--!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOLAND
dialog: I know what you want but it can't be done!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a
text: few more inches down and then tilt up--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOLAND
dialog: Orson -- we can't get the fucking camera any
dialog: fucking lower so find another fucking shot!
dialog: 
text: Welles thinks for a moment and then bolts up. Toland watches,
text: mystified, as Welles races to a sound stage fire station and grabs a
text: fire axe. Welles storms back to the set and raises the axe high. Toland
text: quickly rolls away. And Welles slams the axe into the wooden floor of
text: the set. He continues to hack at the floor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Come on, Gregg! We'll tear out this floor!
dialog: 
text: Welles and Toland and various grips hack at the floor
dialog: 
text: Mank watches, bemused, and checks his watch
dialog: 
text: Welles and Toland finally tear away the remnants of the wooden floor.
text: They stare down, defeated. Under the wood is solid concrete.
dialog: 
text: Welles and Toland stand and stare at the concrete
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOLAND
dialog: It's midnight, why don't we pick it up tomorrow?
dialog: 
text: Welles does not answer. He continues to eye the concrete Then:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Get me a jackhammer.
dialog: 
text: We see a grip pounding away at the concrete with a jackhammer as
text: Welles, always in motion, sweeps past Mank and Joseph Cotton.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANK
dialog: (wryly, to Cotton)
dialog: There but for the grace of God, goes God.
dialog: 
text: Welles slams to a halt in front of the unit physician and thrusts out
text: an arm. The physician injects him with a dose of B-12.
dialog: 
text: Welles can barely wait for the injection before he speeds off.
dialog: 
text: Welles supervises as Toland lowers the camera into the freshly dug hole
text: in the middle of the sound stage. Mank checks his watch, 3:30 AM.
dialog: 
text: Welles leaps into the trench to check the camera setup.
dialog: 
text: Again we see the view through the black-and-white viewfinder. Joseph
text: Cotton stands at a distance, at the far wall of the set.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES' VOICE
dialog: Okay, Joe . . . come closer . . . closer
dialog: 
text: We see Cotton approaching. He finally stops inches away from the
text: camera. His shoes and the far wall of the set are both in total focus.
text: It is a breathtaking, vertiginous shot.
dialog: 
text: Then we see Welles and Joseph Cotton rehearsing and rehearsing and
text: filming and filming the scene. Endlessly
dialog: 
text: Finally we seem to be seeing the scene from the movie
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: "Well, if you got drunk to talk to me about Miss
dialog: Alexander, don't bother. I'm not interested. I've
dialog: set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it? All
dialog: right, if that's the way they want it, the people
dialog: have made their choice. It's obvious the people
dialog: prefer Jim Gettys to me."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSEPH COTTON
dialog: "You talk about the people as if you owned them. As
dialog: though they belonged to you. As long as I can
dialog: remember, you've talked about--" (he breaks
dialog: character)
dialog: Orson, I am so goddamn tired--
dialog: 
text: We continue to watch the scene through the viewfinder:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (to the camera operator)
dialog: Keep filming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSEPH COTTON
dialog: I can't remember the lines!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Then make them up! You're drunk and you're angry.
dialog: 
text: He shoves Joseph Cotton brutally
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: This is the chance you've been waiting for, boy.
dialog: Tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSEPH COTTON
dialog: We're not all hopped up on benzedrine, Orson I Some
dialog: of us humans need sleep!
dialog: 
text: Welles shoves him again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: You're not going to get another chance, boy! Look
dialog: right at the monster and you tell him--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSEPH COTTON
dialog: (deeply)
dialog: "You don't care about anything except you. You just
dialog: want to persuade people that you
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSEPH COTTON (CONT.)
dialog: love them so much that they ought to love you back.
dialog: Only you want love on your own terms. "
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: "A toast then, Jedediah, to love on my own terms.
dialog: Those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his
dialog: own."
dialog: 
text: Welles/Kane drinks. A long pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Cut. Print
dialog: 
text: We jump out of the black-and-white viewfinder and into the scene as
text: Welles turns to an assistant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: How 'bout a real drink?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOLAND
dialog: We done?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
text: The crew members exhale and practically collapse
dialog: 
text: Welles stands and looks around in satisfaction. He takes in the empty
text: corners of the sound stage, the sets, the cameras Savoring the moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: It's finished.
dialog: 
text: He walks to the massive doors of the sound stage and pulls them open.
dialog: 
text: Sunlight floods in.
dialog: 
text: Outside it is a blazing morning and the dazzling sunlight silhouettes
dialog: Welles.
dialog: 
text: Welles squints and steps into the glorious sunlight. Mank and Toland
text: follow. They stand and watch as RKO extras and crews bustle about on
text: their way to work. The assistant brings a tray of martinis.
dialog: 
text: They each take a glass. The RKO workers stare at them oddly as they
dialog: pass.
dialog:

dialog: through the head. So now there's this dead guy lying
dialog: on the deck. You'll see how this could be quite an
dialog: embarrassment. So the empire goes into action. Nice

scene_heading: INT HOTEL ROOM. NEW YORK NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Welles sits brooding in his hotel room. His invincible energy appears
dialog: gone.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: He aimlessly shuffles through the cards and plucks one out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Six of spades
dialog: 
text: He glances at the card. It is the nine of hearts.
dialog: 
text: He shuffles through the cards again and pulls out another card.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Six of spades
dialog: 
text: He looks at the card. It is the two of clubs.
dialog: 
text: His attention is now fully on the cards. He shuffles them dramatically
text: and snatches out a card. He looks at it and then tosses it away. He
text: shuffles again, working the trick, again it fails. He tosses another
dialog: card away. He continues, ;' more quickly, to attempt the trick. It
dialog: fails again. And ' again.
dialog: 
text: With a frightened moan Welles flings the entire deck away from him and
text: bolts out of the room...

scene_heading: EXT HOTEL ROOFTOP NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Welles emerges from a stairway on the roof of his hotel.
dialog: 
text: He marches to the edge of the roof and leans against a railing, gasping
dialog: for air.
dialog: 
text: Everywhere below him the shimmering lights of Manhattan twinkle and
text: flash; cabs and neon and noise. The night sky above him is filled with
dialog: stars.
dialog: 
text: He looks away from the city and up to the stars -- they captivate him
text: fully. He stares and stares at the impossible chaos of beautiful
dialog: lights.
dialog: 
text: A long moment as Welles gazes at the stars. The city below and the
text: noise seem to disappear and Welles stands, safe and at peace under the
text: silent dome of stars.
dialog: 
text: The stars are reflected in his huge, dark eyes
dialog: 
text: Magically, the stars in his eyes give way to the vague shapes of men
text: sitting around a table.

dialog: 1941
dialog: 
text: Around the table are gathered a group of stern businessmen Schaefer is
dialog: also present.
dialog: 
text: Welles looks at the men. And he speaks. For once, his usual
text: overwrought, theatrical tones are gone.
dialog: 
text: He speaks simply.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
text: Today a man from Germany invaded Greece. He has
dialog: already swallowed Poland and Denmark and Norway and
dialog: Belgium. He is bombing London as I speak. Everywhere
text: this man goes he crushes the life and the freedom of
text: his subjects. He sews yellow stars onto their
text: lapels. He takes their voices.
dialog: 
dialog: In this country we still have our voices. And we can sing with them.
dialog: And we can argue with them. And we can be heard. Because we are . . .
dialog: for the moment . . . free. No one can tell us what to say or how to say
dialog: it, can they? We have no brown shirt thugs here ruling our lives, do
dialog: we? No one can take our voices, can they? Because we are free.
dialog: 
dialog: I am one voice and that is all. My picture is one voice. Men are dying
dialog: in Europe now -- and Americans soon will be -- so that we can surmount
dialog: the tyrants and the dictators. Will you send a message across this
dialog: country that one man can take away our voices?
dialog: 
dialog: So ... who is Mr. Hearst and who is Mr. Welles? Mr. Hearst built a
text: palace of brick and mortar and starting little wars and corpses piled
dialog: high. I built a palace of illusion. My castle Xanadu is a matte
text: painting and camera trick. It's nothing but . . . a dream.
dialog: 
dialog: Today you have a chance to let the dream triumph. For once.
dialog: 
text: He gazes at them and then slowly walks out of the room
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT LONG HALLWAY. NEW YORK DAY

dialog: 
text: He nips in at the last minute and punches his button. He turns.
dialog: 
text: The elevator is deserted but for one other person: William Randolph
dialog: Hearst.
dialog: 
text: Welles and Hearst recognize each other instantly. As the elevator
text: ascends the two men look at each other.
dialog: 
text: A very long pause as we watch their faces -- the young man and the old
text: man -- both men of mad grandeur and malevolent passion and stunning
text: inspiration -- both men of incalculable achievement and measureless
dialog: poignancy.
dialog: 
dialog: Finally:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Mr. Hearst, we've met once before, my name is Orson
dialog: Welles and I've got a movie opening tomorrow night
dialog: at the Palace. I would be pleased to get you
dialog: tickets.
dialog: 
text: A pause as Hearst regards Welles.
dialog: 
text: Then Hearst carefully reaches over and presses the stop button on the
text: elevator. The elevator stops.
dialog: 
text: An exceedingly quiet exchange:
dialog: 
text: A beat.
dialog: 
text: A pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEARST
dialog: I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Do you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEARST
dialog: Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my
dialog: head I could give you a hundred others. I have been
dialog: swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a
dialog: belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned,
dialog: undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private
dialog: lives should not be public property.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name
dialog: and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip.
dialog: In your papers you taught the world how to look
dialog: under every rock. I learned at the knee of the
dialog: master.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEARST
dialog: So where does that leave us, Mr. Welles? What kind
dialog: of sad future are we two making? A future where men
dialog: will do anything to sell their newspapers and their
dialog: movies? A future where no price is too high for fame
dialog: and power? When we will all scratch each other to
dialog: pieces just to be heard?
dialog: 
dialog: Can you truly envision such ... horror.
dialog: 
text: Hearst presses the stop button again and the elevator begins to move.
dialog: 
text: The doors opens on Hearst's floor and he leaves the elevator.
dialog: 
text: The doors are about to shut on Welles when he leans forward; and roars:
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WELLES
scene_heading: CHARLES FOSTER KANE WOULD HAVE ACCEPTED I
dialog:
