speaker_heading: A WOMAN'S HANDS
text: Folding a PAPER NAPKIN. Nails clipped short, no polish.
speaker_heading: SALT’S VOICE
dialog: Fold the napkin into quarters...
text: Fold the top in half diagonally.
scene_heading: INT. SALT'S OFFICE - DIVERSIFIED PETROLEUM - DAY
text: As EVELYN SALT checks her computer screen. She’s on a DINNER
text: NAPKIN FOLDING website. Out her window: WASHINGTON DC.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: (reading off screen)
dialog: Fold the right side back, one third
dialog: of the way down.
text: As she does this, a NEW ANGLE and she’s unaware that TED
text: WINTER stops outside her door, watches as she finishes the
text: last few folds, then slides a plastic fork, spoon and knife
text: down inside the paper napkin ‘pouch’. Very neat.
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: Are you doing this on company time?
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: Got a big dinner tonight. I want the
dialog: table just... perfect.
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: If the taxpayers only knew.
text: He steps in to take a closer look. Winter is 45, every inch
text: the tough, but fair executive type. He has a briefcase-bag
text: over his shoulder. On his way out.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: I could've done a crown fold, a lily
dialog: goblet. Hmmm. What do you think?
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: I don’t really have an opinion.
text: She pokes at it, frowns, dissatisfied.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: It’s not very sexy.
text: Winter looks to a desk PHOTO of Salt and her man MIKE DUNCAN.
text: He tries to comes up with something reassuring to say.
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: It’s utilitarian. Utilitarian is the
dialog: new sexy.
text: She looks over her shoulder at him: Huh? He shrugs.
speaker_heading: WINTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Walk me out.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DIVERSIFIED PETROLEUM - DAY
dialog: Salt and Winter walk.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: You leaving for the funeral?
speaker_heading: WINTER
text: 4:55 out of Dulles. New York’s going
dialog: to be a zoo.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: He was a pretty great guy, huh?
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: The last gentleman. Public servant
dialog: for forty-two years. Died in his
dialog: sleep leaving a better, safer world
dialog: than he found. I’d take that epitaph.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: I wished I had known him.
text: He nods, wish she had as well.
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: The Maelev summit starts tomorrow. I
dialog: need all those reports waiting at
text: Camp David in the AM. Maelev arrives
dialog: at one.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: Did you know he made his money as a
dialog: student selling Pink Floyd and Led
dialog: Zeppelin bootlegs?
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: I’m more interested in his position
dialog: on the Ukraine, the possibility of
text: using force to redraw the map of
dialog: Eastern Europe, that kind of thing.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: I don’t know how you push all this
dialog: paper, Ted. I’d go crazy if I did it
dialog: full time.
text: Laughing, Winter fishes out his ID as they near...
scene_heading: A SECURITY CHECKPOINT
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: Don’t worry, you’ll be back in the
dialog: field in a week. Thanks for the
text: paper pushing help by the way.
text: Winter hands his briefcase-bag to the SECURITY GUARD at the
text: METAL DETECTORS. Then he swipes his ID. You need to clear
dialog: security to leave as well as enter.
speaker_heading: WINTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Have a great dinner, Ev. Happy
dialog: anniversary.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: Thank you. Have a good funeral.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: That didn’t come out right.
text: TODD BOTTOMS, a young Yale graduate hurries over from the
text: direction they just came. Flagging Winters down.
speaker_heading: BOTTOMS
dialog: Sir! Sir!
dialog: (Winter looks back)
dialog: We got a walk-in! A defector. Ten
dialog: minutes ago.
text: Salt gestures to the Diversified Petroleum LOGO on the wall.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: I guess he’s not buying our cover.
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: Did you get his bona fides?
speaker_heading: BOTTOMS
dialog: Won’t give ‘em. But he’s Russian.
dialog: He’s very strange. And...
text: He looks from Winter to Salt, back to Winter
speaker_heading: BOTTOMS (CONT’D)
dialog: He wants to talk to Salt. He asked
dialog: for her by name.
text: Salt and Winter exchange a look. How odd. Winter looks at
dialog: his watch.
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: I got twenty minutes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY TWO - DIVERSIFIED PETROLEUM - DAY
text: A starker, stripped down hallway. Concrete floors. Bare
text: fluorescents. Salt, Winter and Bottoms walk briskly along.
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: Is counterintelligence down here?
speaker_heading: BOTTOMS
dialog: Peabody is, Sir.
text: As they turn the corner, and Winter reacts.
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: Fucking Peabody.
text: They stop across from PEABODY who stands sentinel-like in the
text: hall outside a door. A CIA Counterintelligence officer, he
dialog: is, technically, a motherfucker. And he’s heard his intro.
speaker_heading: PEABODY
dialog: (re: door)
dialog: We're in here... And I’ll take that
text: adverb all day long.
text: He opens the door. Winter and Bottoms enter. Salt pauses.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: It’s an adjective actually. In this
dialog: case.
text: No reaction from him. As she follows the others.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: A RUSSIAN MAN - SEEN THROUGH A TWO-WAY MIRROR
text: Seated at a desk. Hair gray, head down, hands folded in
text: front of him. A cigarette burns between two fingers, a
text: carton on the desk. We are in the...
speaker_heading: OBSERVATION ROOM
text: Salt, Winter and Bottoms. Peabody. A SECURITY OFFICER and
scene_heading: TWO TECHIES.
text: One monitoring the video equipment, the other on the fMRI: a
text: LIQUID CRYSTAL GRAPH of the Russian's brain - heat signatures
text: blooming in its cortex. A lie detector.
speaker_heading: TECHIE ONE
text: Neural scan is up.
text: Winter looks to Salt, nods. She enters: the door on a blind
dialog: so you can’t see in from the interrogation side.
scene_heading: INTERROGATION ROOM
text: Salt sits opposite the Russian. His head stays down.
speaker_heading: RUSSIAN MAN
dialog: Female intelligence officers, in my
dialog: experience, are usually lesbians.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: Sorry we're here to talk about you.
dialog: Why don’t we start with your name.
text: He looks up. A character from a Gogol short story. Gaunt,
text: older, pale dangerous eyes.
speaker_heading: RUSSIAN MAN (ZYKOV)
dialog: My name is Oleg Vassily Zykov.
text: Salt just stares at him. Hard to say what she’s thinking,
text: but she’s thinking something. He takes drag.
speaker_heading: OBSERVATION ROOM
text: Bottoms types into a computer: O-l-e-g-Z-y-k-o-v.
scene_heading: INTERROGATION ROOM
text: He holds up the cigarette.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV
dialog: I have cancer.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: I am moved. A defector with cancer.
dialog: Are you selling secrets for chemo?
dialog: Are you afraid of dying?
speaker_heading: OBSERVATION ROOM
text: Peabody likes her style. Techie two watches the scan.
speaker_heading: TECHIE TWO
dialog: Scan says he’s truthful on the
dialog: cancer.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV (SPEAKER)
dialog: If I have gained anything by damning
dialog: myself, it is that I no longer have
dialog: anything to fear.
text: Bottoms’ screen comes to life with information. Including a
dialog: PHOTO of Zykov maybe 7 or 8 years ago. Same guy.
speaker_heading: BOTTOMS
text: Oleg Zykov. He shows up in 1993 in
dialog: Novosibirsk Oblast, Siberia. He was
text: on Victor Pechyonkin’s staff there.
dialog: When Pechyonkin moved to head the
dialog: FSB’s Counter Terrorism Unit in ‘95,
dialog: Zykov went with him. Been there ever
dialog: since. Mid-level. A bureaucrat.
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: Prior to ‘93?
speaker_heading: BOTTOMS
dialog: Nothing. He doesn’t exist.
scene_heading: INTERROGATION ROOM
dialog: Salt and Zykov.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: I have someplace to be, Mr. Zykov.
dialog: So if you wouldn’t mind getting to
dialog: the point.
dialog: (All subtitled dialog will appear as <Russian> )
speaker_heading: ZYKOV
dialog: <I came to tell you a story.>
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: <I don’t like stories. But let's
dialog: hear it anyway. And please...>
dialog: (in English)
text: .--in English. Others are listening.
text: He smiles, regards her a beat, then...
speaker_heading: ZYKOV
text: 1975. The Cold War. In a gymnasium
dialog: in Grozny...
scene_heading: INT. SOVIET GYMNASIUM - GROZNY - DAY
text: A WRESTLER works hard to position his OPPONENT. His body is
text: a continuous knot of muscle. His head, a brutal stub. It’s
text: only a matter of moments as he locks in a hold.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV (V.O.)
dialog: A Soviet Olympic wrestler named
dialog: Sascha Fyorodovich Chenkov meets for
dialog: the first time...
text: His eyes, by chance, connect with those of ANJA NUREKYOVA.
text: She’s part of a group being given a tour of the facility.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: ...the only female chess grand master
dialog: of her era, Anja Nurekyova.
text: And Chenkov’s grip on his opponent is replaced by the
text: magnetic intensity of his shared gaze with Nurekyova.
text: Abruptly, his opponent breaks free and suddenly pins him.
text: Chenkov barely notices, his eyes on hers as she smiles.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: They were married.
scene_heading: INT. MUNICIPAL BUILDING - GROZNY - DAY
text: A simple civil ceremony.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV (V.O.)
dialog: And one year later... a child.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - GROZNY - DAY
text: Eight beds all occupied. Nurekyova watches from hers as
text: Chenkov cradles a NEWBORN child in his calloused hands. He
text: stares at it with depthless wonder. There is no doubt this
dialog: child, in these hands, will be protected.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV (V.O.)
dialog: One year more the child was back in
text: the same hospital, sick with fever.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - GROZNY - NIGHT
text: Chenkov holds his wife as she is wracked with sobs. Tears
text: streak his own face as well.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV (V.O.)
dialog: They were told the child was dead. A
dialog: body was buried. But in fact...
scene_heading: EXT. REAR ENTRANCE - HOSPITAL - GROZNY - NIGHT
text: THE INFANT CHILD is carried out by a NURSE, handed through
text: the open back door of an idling black Volga.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV
dialog: The child lived. It became the
dialog: property of Mother Russia. Ward of a
dialog: secret program and its administrator.
text: One of the two male hands that receives the baby flashes a
text: heavy RING with a GOLD STAR on a RED ENAMEL BACKGROUND.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - MANOR HOUSE - NIGHT
text: It’s former glory now threadbare. Sleet pelts the windows.
text: The infant child in an basket on a table. Alone. Wailing.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV (V.O.)
dialog: The Cold War was at it's coldest and
dialog: Brezhnev was determined that it was
dialog: America who would be crushed. And
dialog: 2nd only to his nuclear arsenal,
dialog: Brezhnev's weapon would be espionage.
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM - RUSSIA - DAY
text: YOUNG CHENKOV, 5, stands by a little desk, head shaved on the
text: sides in a military cut. SEVEN CLASSMATES behind and beyond.
text: Uniformity rules; it’s hard to tell the boys from the girls.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV (V.O.)
dialog: Young Chenkov learned English long
text: before Russian. Drilled in idiom,
dialog: idiosyncrasy and ideology.
speaker_heading: CLASS (TOGETHER)
dialog: I pledge allegiance to the flag of
dialog: the United States of America...
text: We focus in on young Chenkov’s voice.
speaker_heading: CHENKOV
dialog: .+-and to the Republic for which it
dialog: stands: one Nation under God...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
text: Salt smiles, looses a smoke ring that drifts toward Zykov.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: You’re killing me, Oleg. When does
dialog: the good fairy show up?
speaker_heading: ZYKOV
dialog: Never. It’s a story without hope.
text: As the smoke ring widens, drifts past him...
speaker_heading: OBSERVATION ROOM
text: Peabody suddenly aware of something. He looks to Techie One.
speaker_heading: PEABODY
dialog: Get on his hands. Show me his ring.
text: Techie One hits the keyboard, manipulates the image of Zykov
text: on the screen into a CLOSE-UP of his hands... a heavy old
text: RING: gold star on a red background.
speaker_heading: PEABODY (CONT'D)
dialog: You know what that is? He’s been
dialog: awarded the goddamn Hero of the
dialog: Soviet Union. How is that not in the
dialog: data-base?
text: Bottoms shrugs, Peabody makes him very nervous.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV (SPEAKER)
dialog: Have you ever been in a place from
dialog: where hope was gone? Where all
dialog: that's left is patience?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ANOTHER GYMNASIUM - RUSSIA - DAY
text: Chenkov, now 7, in the middle of a tumbling run: the end a
text: double somersault. Not enough rotation. A hard landing flat
text: on the ass. Chenkov sits there, worn out. Finally stands.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV (V.O.)
dialog: Young Chenkov was taught persistence.
dialog: Tenacity.
text: Another hard TUMBLING RUN ends with the same results except
text: this time flat on the back, Chenkov’s head snapping back.
text: Chenkov sits there a beat, worn out, trying not to cry.
text: Then looking up as two adult feet step up. The tears are
text: there, but they will not fall. As Chenkov stands again...
scene_heading: EXT. ARMY BARRACKS — DAY
text: Soviet SPEZNATZ ‘fight-train’, grappling, going over brutal
text: elbows, headbutts and knees. Cage fighters with no cage.
text: They stop to watch as six children are marched over. 10-year-
text: old Chenkov steps up, assumes a fighter’s stance.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV (V.O.)
dialog: Trained to fight.
text: The Speznatz INSTRUCTOR LAUGHS. Chenkov grimly stomps down
text: hard on his foot, kicks him full force in the groin. The
text: Instructor drops to a knee, gasping. As his men laugh...
speaker_heading: ZYKOV (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: And to accept the consequences.
text: Chenkov resumes the stance. The instructor responds with a
text: vicious BACKHAND, sends the little body flying.
scene_heading: EXT. HARDSCRABBLE RUSSIAN LADSCAPE - DAY
text: The begrimed and filthy children march and stumble, carrying
text: heavy packs on their shoulders. Leaning forward, knees
text: scraped and bloody from falls, the exhaustion and enormous
text: strain evident. Staggered in a line, Chenkov in the lead.
text: Chenkov reaches a STAKE in the ground, the top fluttering an
text: ORANGE FLAG. Chenkov breathes. The others join one-by-one.
text: Chenkov looks up as we hear CAR TIRES crunch up.
text: The last child to cross is SHNAIDER, eyes the PALEST BLUE.
text: They blink as a car door SLAMS.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV (V.O.)
dialog: Taught what it means to be a comrade.
text: They look up as an overcoated adult steps INTO FRAME before
text: them. A BAMBOO SWITCH in a hand which bears a familiar ring.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: <Who crossed first?>
text: Chenkov’s hand goes up.
speaker_heading: VOICE (CONT’D)
dialog: <Who crossed last?>
text: Shnaider hand reluctantly raises. The switch motions the two
text: to the side. As they and the man disappear from frame, the
text: rest of the children watch. We hear the switch CRACKING
text: down. The children begin to recite.
speaker_heading: CHILDREN
dialog: I will not desert my comrade wherever
dialog: I am stationed. I will fight both
dialog: alone and with all to help me. So my
dialog: motherland will not be diminished,
dialog: but grow greater than before.
dialog: 11.
scene_heading: INT. RUSSIAN DORMITORY - NIGHT
text: Eight little beds in a stark, bereft row. Quiet except for
text: the MUFFLED CRYING of one the children: SCNAIDER, who is in
text: bed seven across from Chenkov in bed eight.
text: Chenkov watching Shnaider cry his pale blue eyes out. As he
text: looks to Chenkov for sympathy...
speaker_heading: ZYKOV (V.O.)
dialog: Taught to seek the comfort that is
text: only found within.
text: Chenkov turns away, would rather stare into the darkness. As
text: Shnaider continues to cry...
speaker_heading: ZYKOV (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: But most of all, Chenkov was
text: instilled with an unquestioning
dialog: loyalty to the state.
scene_heading: INT. RUSSIAN DORMITORY - MORNING
text: One after the next, the children step forward to KISS ZYKOV’S
text: RING. Chenkov is last. Chenkov turns the child’s face from
text: side-to-side, deciding something.
scene_heading: INT. PRE-OP - RUSSIAN HOSPITAL - DAY
text: Stoic Chenkov prepped for surgery - cut lines being drawn
text: across the face with a marker by a SURGEON.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV (V.O.)
dialog: And finally given a new identity, a
text: face surgically altered to resemble
text: that of a visiting American teenager.
text: Chenkov being wheeled through a set of doors into a SOVIET
text: OPERATING ROOM. With finality, the doors swing shut.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV (CONT'D)
dialog: Young Chenkov then left Russia. The
dialog: American teenager did not.
speaker_heading: RETURN TO:
scene_heading: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
text: Where Salt waits for more as Zykov lights another butt.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: Are you saying this Chenkov is here
dialog: in the United States?
dialog: 12.
text: Zykov nods. Salt turns her head, looks into the cold
text: reflection of the two-way glass.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY
text: WINTER looks to Techie Two monitoring Zykov’s NEURAL SCAN.
speaker_heading: TECHIE TWO
dialog: So far the fMRI scan registers
dialog: truthful on everything he’s said.
scene_heading: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
text: Zykov grinds his cigarette out in the ashtray.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV
dialog: Chenkov is designee KA-8.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: Try again. The KA program was Cold
dialog: War propaganda. A myth.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV
dialog: Until today. Because today is the
dialog: day Chenkov will be tasked. The long
dialog: awaited mission is here.
dialog: (grim; eyes on her)
dialog: Today Chenkov will travel to New York
dialog: City to kill Russian President Boris
dialog: Maelev at the funeral of Vice
dialog: President Oates.
speaker_heading: OBSERVATION ROOM
text: Winter reacts. Bottoms reads off his computer screen.
speaker_heading: BOTTOMS
dialog: KA. A Cold War program to insert
dialog: sleeper agents into American society.
dialog: The program was theorized as active
dialog: in the 1980’s. However, no evidence
dialog: of its existence has ever been found.
scene_heading: INTERROGATION ROOM
text: Salt looks at him. Her eyes dip darkly.
speaker_heading: SALT
text: A Russian agent is going to kill the
dialog: Russian president? Is that it?
text: Zykov nods solemnly.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: SALT (CONT'D)
dialog: And now what do you want in return,
dialog: Mr. Zykov? Money? Chemotherapy?
dialog: Health care’s pretty shitty back
dialog: home, huh?
speaker_heading: ZYKOV
dialog: I simply wish to help you do what you
dialog: need to do.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Don’t you want the name? The alias
dialog: that this Chenkov lives under?
text: Salt smiles, begins softly clapping.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: You're very good. And I’ve seen the
dialog: best. KA-8. Brilliant bullshit.
dialog: (checks her watch)
dialog: But I’m off duty. You can tell the
dialog: rest of it to one of my colleagues.
text: Salt stands, heads for the door.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV
dialog: Salt.
text: Salt stops and turns.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ZYKOV
dialog: The name. The name of the Soviet
text: agent is Salt. Evelyn Salt.
text: Time stands still. And then...
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: My name is Evelyn Salt.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV
dialog: Then you, my dear, are a Russian spy.
speaker_heading: OBSERVATION ROOM
text: You could hear a pin drop. Tech Two checks the neural scan.
speaker_heading: NEURAL TECH
dialog: --. truthful ...
text: The door opens. Salt enters the room’s stunned vacuum. But
text: she doesn’t notice because, taking her CELLPHONE from her
text: pocket, she’s already out the next door.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: PEABODY
dialog: Whoa! Where are you going?!
text: And he’s right on her heels.
speaker_heading: HALLWAY TWO
text: Salt on her way down the hall, punching in a number.
text: Peabody catches up, grabs her shoulder from behind. She
text: spins, stops, angrily bats him off with her ear to the phone.
text: From the phone you can hear an ANSWERING MACHINE pick up ...
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Mike’s not here. Leave a message.
text: At the BEEP, Salt urgent, suddenly sounds scared.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: Mike, it’s me. Call me when you get
dialog: this. Please, right away.
dialog: (clicks off)
dialog: Shit.
dialog: Winter here now as well.
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: What are you doing, Ev?
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: When they blow up a spy, they don’t
dialog: just blow their cover - they blow up
dialog: their whole cover life. So they
dialog: can’t go back.
dialog: (a beat as the stare)
dialog: Ted, if they’ve mistaken me for their
dialog: long lost spy, then they’ve mistaken
dialog: Mike for their spy’s husband. He
dialog: could be in danger.
text: Her eyes desperate.
speaker_heading: PEABODY
dialog: If. That’s a big word.
text: Salt aware of him again.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: Get the fuck away from me.
text: She moves to go. He blocks her.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: PEABODY
dialog: Where are you going, Salt?
text: When Salt speaks now, her voice cracks ...
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: Home.
dialog: (to Winter)
dialog: You know what this is about. I
dialog: compromised their agent in South
dialog: Korea and now they're repaying the
dialog: favor.
dialog: (urgent)
dialog: Ted, you know me.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Chenkov.
text: They all look to see: Zykov - with Bottoms and the security
text: officer - just out the door of the observation room.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV
dialog: Godspeed, Comrade.
text: And then they’re leading him the other way down the hall.
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: Someone interrogate that piece of
dialog: shit! Someone who enjoys getting
dialog: answers!
text: He turns his hard gaze back to Salt. She looks sick.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: I swear to you I am not who he says I
dialog: am. I am not a spy.
text: Clearly affected, Winter looks to Peabody.
speaker_heading: PEABODY
text: Procedure on this is very clear.
text: Trembling, Salt finally just nods. The tension in her body
text: turning to resignation.
text: TWO more SECURITY OFFICERS come from the direction Zykov was
text: taken. As Peabody looks to them ever so briefly --
text: -- WHUMP! Salt chops his neck with the heel of her hand,
text: then kicks his legs out from under him. As she sprints down
dialog: the hall --
text: The security officers charge after her. MOVE WITH them,
text: drawing their 9mm sidearms as they go.
dialog: 16.
text: She motors hard ahead, disappearing around a CORNER.
text: As they follow...
scene_heading: CORNER - HALLWAY THREE
text: She’s crouched low, just a foot inside.
text: As the first security officer barrels around, Salt blows him
text: up like a linebacker on a goal line stand. His gun clatters.
text: As the second swings his aim around, Salt catches his arm,
text: twists it and him around. She relieves him of his 9mm, then
text: sends him headfirst into the wall.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
text: The doors open. Salt steps off. The ALARMS start to sound.
text: KLAXONS going off.
text: The halls filling with people headed for the exits. Salt

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY FOUR - DAY
text: Bottoms and the security officer reacting to the alarms.
dialog: Zykov smiling --
text: -- clipping the inside of his right shoe against his left.
text: Springing a 4-inch STEEL BLADE out the toe of the right.
text: He arcs a kick hard into the security officer’s thigh.
text: The security officer drops to his knees.
text: Zykov sidesteps Bottoms even as he unspools a STEEL LINE from
text: his wristwatch, wraps it viciously around Bottoms’ throat.
text: As the security officer reaches for his gun -- Zykov’s right
text: foot arcs up and the blade slices through the officer's
dialog: throat.
text: And Zykov still hangs onto Bottoms. A red line circumscribes
text: the young man’s neck as the wire disappears inside. A beat
text: before the blood floods out.
text: Zykov releases him, scoots back to keep from being soiled.
dialog: 17.
text: As Bottoms hits the floor, Zykov takes the security officer’s
text: 9mm and ID and calmly disappears around the corner leaving
text: two corpses in his wake. Not bad for an old man...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BUILDING ENTRANCE - DAY
text: EMPLOYEES evacuating. Swiping their ID cards as SECURITY
text: TEAMS scan faces. Salt’s FACE up on the screens. Their eyes

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR ONE - DAY
text: Salt bangs through the stairwell door into an abandoned

text: She tries the stairwell door. It has remotely locked.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SECURITY HUB

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR TWO - DAY

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THIRD FLOOR OFFICE - DAY
text: Breath held, Salt enters the office carrying a CO2 FIRE

speaker_heading: PEABODY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THIRD FLOOR OFFICE - DAY
text: Several paper towels are stained brown with the IODINE Salt

text: She flips over a metal side TABLE, yanks one of the legs back

scene_heading: EXT. CORRIDOR TWO - DAY

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. WINTER’S OFFICE - DAY

speaker_heading: WINTER’S POV

speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Mike’s not here. Leave a message.

speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Do you come here often?

speaker_heading: SALT

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: You discovered it?
speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: No. Should I?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Pete-best-i. I named him after Pete

speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT’D)
dialog: Best was never a famous Beatle, but

speaker_heading: WOODHALL
dialog: Thank you.

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That’s Woodhall. He’s raising a

speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: Well, thank you for the tour --
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Hold on. You still gotta tell me.
dialog: Why do you come to the museum so
dialog: much?
text: She looks at him a beat, decides to confess.
speaker_heading: SALT

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: ANOTHER TERRACE

speaker_heading: SALT

speaker_heading: MIKE’S VOICE

speaker_heading: MIKE’S VOICE

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I think you need something to
dialog: practice on.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: How about a spider? We have about
dialog: the same capacity for human feeling.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I was thinking maybe Burt.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: Burt?
text: Mike takes his hand from behind his back. He holds the PUPPY

text: He hands ‘Burt’ through the door. As she takes him...
speaker_heading: SALT (CONT'D)
dialog: I’1l work on it.
speaker_heading: ON MIKE
text: The door shuts in his face. He stands there a moment, then

speaker_heading: SALT (CONT'D)
text: He peed on the floor.
speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: SALT

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: WOODHALL

speaker_heading: SALT

speaker_heading: WOODHALL
dialog: He left a couple hours ago.
speaker_heading: SALT

speaker_heading: WOODHALL

scene_heading: INT. STRIPPING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

speaker_heading: STRIPPING ROOM
text: A lone beetle looks up through the grizzly’s eye socket as

text: Peabody hitting the fluorescents as they enter, fan out.
text: The lights flicker to life, fully revealing the Plexiglas

scene_heading: ANGLE ON WINDOW - OUTSIDE
text: Peabody sticks his head out, looks down at the lawn three

speaker_heading: PEABODY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: WOODHALL

scene_heading: EXT. BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON

text: Salt sprints hard at it, then darts down an...
speaker_heading: ALLEY
text: Running hard, the duffle bag slung over her shoulder.

text: A SECOND FEDERAL CAR barrels down the alley straight at her.
text: Salt running. Two cars chasing and one coming right at her.
text: She draws the 9mm, aims straight ahead as she runs. Fires
text: two rounds into the engine block of the car coming at her,
text: another into the left front tire.
text: As the car slows with a shudder, she high-step onto the hood,
text: then the roof and finally off the trunk. As she continues

scene_heading: EXT. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON

speaker_heading: PEABODY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: I’m innocent.
speaker_heading: PEABODY
dialog: Then why’d you run?

speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: Because if they targeted me, then my

dialog: Just let me find him, that's all.
speaker_heading: PEABODY

speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: You have three continental shelves.

text: Muscle-bound moves in. The interlocutor waves him off, looks

speaker_heading: NK INTERLOCUTOR
dialog: You are here to sabotage our nuclear

speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: I’m a businesswoman. I came to North

text: Muscle-bound pulls the rope taut. Then slowly hauls down,

text: The interlocutor stands as Salt slowly comes up off the
dialog: floor, chair and all. The idea is not to kill, but to choke.
text: Salt’s face goes red. Her eyes bulge. The Koreans just

text: As her right hand spasms open and shut, the interlocutor

dialog: 42.
text: The interlocutor hooks a finger into the rope around her

text: The interlocutor grabs the frame of the chair, starts to pull
text: down on it.
speaker_heading: NK INTERLOCUTOR
dialog: It will be today.
text: But now he’s close enough. Her right hand catches, grabs her
text: interlocutor’s face. Digs in talon-like. Before muscle-
text: bound can react to what’s happening, the damage is severe.
text: The interlocutor HOWLS. The chair SLAMS to the ground. Salt
text: ends up on her side. Blood seeps between the interlocutor’s

speaker_heading: SALT

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: Treating your adversary with respect

speaker_heading: ZYKOV
dialog: That was before I was forgotten. Not

text: Basayev catches the side of the barge, holds the motorboat
text: steady as Salt and Zykov climb the rusty welded ladder rungs.
text: A tetanus shot waiting to happen.
speaker_heading: DECK
text: Joined by Basayev, they cross to a large open HATCH. A dull
text: glow of light below. Seems a shit direction to be travelling.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: What’s down there?
speaker_heading: ZYKOV
dialog: Well, it occurs to me that perhaps
dialog: you've changed. And I need to be
dialog: sure you have not.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: I proved myself at St. Patrick’s.
dialog: Wouldn’t you say?
speaker_heading: ZYKOV
dialog: You did well, but what I have in mind
dialog: is too important not to be sure.
text: He raises his eyebrows. Salt shrugs, heads down into...
speaker_heading: THE BOWELS
text: Skirts the standing water as she heads toward the light.
text: A couple of car battery WORKLIGHTS have been set up. FIVE
text: heavy RUSSIAN MOBSTERS here. Standing at the edge of a TANK.
text: Two of them armed with ASSAULT RIFLES.
dialog: 73.
text: Salt is followed by Basayev and Zykov. Finally she has the
dialog: angle to see down inside:
speaker_heading: THE TANK
text: Standing in the bottom -- Her husband MIKE. His ankle
text: chained to a fitting on the tank floor. As he looks up...
speaker_heading: SALT
text: Dead still. Whatever the thought is that’s screaming through
dialog: her brain is hers and hers alone to know.
speaker_heading: THE BOWELS
text: Zykov steps up beside Salt.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV (CONT'D)
dialog: You're surprised?
text: Still looking at Mike...
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: No. I knew that you had him.
text: Zykov studies her in the dim light.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV
dialog: Are you ready to watch him die?
text: Mike locked on her as...
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: (shrugs )
dialog: Give me a gun.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV
dialog: That would be too easy.
text: Zykov nods to the unarmed Russian gangster. He pulls a
text: handle, opening a valve.
text: A rushing sound as WATER POURS rapidly into the tank, gushing
text: round Mike's feet, covering the floor.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: Either way. It doesn’t matter to me.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV
dialog: Doesn’t it?
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: No.
dialog: 74.
text: Mike grim, never takes his eyes off Salt.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV
dialog: The truth is...
text: The water now gushing around Mike’s knees. Coming up fast.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV (CONT'D)
dialog: It is the privilege of those who fear
dialog: love to murder those who do not.
text: Zykov smiles down at Mike, addresses him as he strokes Salt’s
text: cheek with the back of his hand.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV (CONT'D)
dialog: She hears me, she recognizes me, she
dialog: is mine, a possession for all time.
text: The water at Mike’s waist.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you think you ever had her? You
dialog: were merely a plaything. A surrogate
dialog: for her loneliness.
text: Zykov truly a nasty, sinister piece of work. He runs his
text: hand casually down her body.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV (CONT'D)
dialog: She has always been mine. Her mouth?
dialog: Her tongue? I taught her to use
dialog: them, I taught her to love. What you
dialog: felt was me.
text: As Zykov leans in to kiss Salt’s throat, it gives Mike a
text: chance to glance up above, then back at her. The water at
text: his chest.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV (CONT'D)
dialog: She is the monster I created.
text: As Zykov drills Mike with a look, Salt has a moment to glance
text: above where Mike tried to direct her.
speaker_heading: WHAT SHE SEES:
text: Caught in a flash of light: a SPIDER sitting in a LARGE WEB.
speaker_heading: SALT
text: Looks back down at...
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: MIKE
text: The water up just under his chin. The slightest flare in his
text: eyes. He’s trying to tell her something.
speaker_heading: SALT
text: Neutral. At least she appears so as Zykov watches her. We
dialog: don’t know if the message has been passed or not.
speaker_heading: CATWALK
text: The waters creeps up Mike’s cheeks. He tilts his head back,
text: but still keeps his eyes on her.
text: Salt stares back. One last moment before the water swallows
dialog: him up.
text: At a nod from Zykov, the gangster pulls the handle, shutting
text: off the water. Just a few inches above Mike’s upturned face.
text: A frozen beat before bubbles erupt from Mike’s mouth and nose
text: in sudden, tortured bursts.
text: And Salt witnesses every moment. A beholder. And Zykov
text: watches her as...
text: Mike’s hands break the surface as he flails. Finally a last
text: silent scream, his mouth dark and wide. Until Death claims
text: him. And his body settles away into the murk below.
text: Salt turns, looks frankly to Zykov. Then: kisses Zykov on
text: the mouth. Even Basayev raises an eyebrow. Salt pulls back.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: Satisfied?
speaker_heading: ZYKOV
text: Satisfied.
text: He takes her arm, starts walking her back the other way.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV (CONT'D)
text: The Russians are at the abyss. Now
dialog: for the Americans. Tonight they meet
dialog: at Camp David The President, his
dialog: cabinet, the Joint Chiefs and NATO
dialog: representatives. We will be there as
dialog: well. Helping them generate their
text: reply to the Russian sabre rattling.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: You’1l be brought in by David Cerny,
text: a Czech Colonel, the NATO liaison.
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: He’s one of us?

speaker_heading: CERNY

speaker_heading: CERNY (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you miss me?
text: As she recognizes those palest BLUE EYES.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: Shnaider.
text: Cerny/Shnaider smiles, nods. Salt can’t help but LAUGH.
speaker_heading: SALT (CONT'D)
dialog: You finally stopped crying.
dialog: (he nods; pleased)
dialog: How long have you been here?
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: SHNAIDER/CERNY
dialog: I left Russia one year after you. To
dialog: Prague. I’ve been the NATO liaison
dialog: to the White House for three years.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: Zykov thought of everything.
dialog: (assumes an accent)
dialog: I am NATO Major Jiri Vicek from
dialog: Karlovy Vary.
text: He hands her Vicek’s CREDENTIALS and wallet. Then a set of
text: ARCHITECTURAL SCHEMATICS clearly marked as Camp David.
text: Shnaider flips a page to: a SIDE VIEW. An ELEVATOR SHAFT
text: running deep below Camp David to a SUBTERRANEAN CHAMBER
text: below. Shnaider taps his finger on it.
speaker_heading: SHNAIDER
dialog: That’s where the President needs to
dialog: be.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: Tell me more.
speaker_heading: SHNAIDER

text: Suddenly, a POUNDING from INSIDE the coffin.
text: They unlatch their seat belts, jump up at a muffled shout.
text: And they’re unlatching, pulling open the lid to reveal:

speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: These are temperature-drops in mobile

dialog: Oblast and in southern Baikal.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: What exactly does that mean?
speaker_heading: SEC DEF CHALMERS
dialog: It means Barisovsky has the Russians

dialog: ready to go.
text: As it settles on the President a beat, the First Lady steps
text: up. She’s very aware she’s interrupting something heavy.

speaker_heading: FIRST LADY
dialog: I’m going to the screening room for a
dialog: movie. Okay?
text: He squeezes her hand, nods. A beat between them and she goes.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: So what do we do?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Even if they’re posturing, the only
dialog: meaningful response will be our own
text: ICBM’s being fueled. The Russians
dialog: will read it and notice will be
dialog: served.
speaker_heading: SEC DEF CHALMERS
dialog: We should put some planes in the air,
dialog: surface move a submarine or two and
dialog: open some silo doors. That and go
text: from Defcon 4 to Defcon 3. At least
dialog: at our forward bases.

speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Screw assessments. Our intel says a

dialog: the hell are they up to?
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: I think Barisovsky knows we weren’t
text: behind the hit on Maelev. But he’s a

dialog: Maelev’s assassination was in reality
dialog: a coup-d’etat.

dialog: What do you have on her?
speaker_heading: WINTER

speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: How's that?
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: Car accident. 1988. They were

text: Salt wipes at her face, tears off what remains of her facial
text: prothesis after getting punched. Looking more like her old
dialog: self again.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LOWER BUNKER OPERATIONS CENTER - NIGHT
text: Ringed with video screens: some clear, some cycling through
text: surveillance views, some showing CNN and other news services.
text: All playing silently. A team of THREE TECHS.
text: One side of the room is a 5x12 foot reinforced GLASS WINDOW
text: looking out at another larger CONFERENCE ROOM beyond. This
text: room is empty.
text: The President, Agent Jenks, Winter and all the others enter
text: through a HEAVY OPEN DOOR on the right.
speaker_heading: LEAD TECH
dialog: We have the Director Medford up.
text: On one screen: CIA DIRECTOR MEDFORD at Langley. The
text: President looks to a Tech who switches on the two-way.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: What the situation, Dan?
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR MEDFORD
dialog: What’s the situation there?! We’re
dialog: hearing all sorts of wild reports.
dialog: gl.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: I’m fine. We’re down in the bunker.
dialog: What’s going on with the Russians?
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR MEDFORD
dialog: We're not sure. Something strange.
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: Dan, it’s Ted Winter. Strange how?
text: Director Medford can obviously see him on his end.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR MEDFORD
dialog: Everything's in flux, but our intel
dialog: as of five minutes ago says that
dialog: Maelev’s successor Barisovsky is no
dialog: longer in power.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: What? How is that possible?
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR MEDFORD
dialog: All we know is chain of command to
text: him has been broken off.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: There may have been a coup.
dialog: (to President)
dialog: It would be prudent to look at the
dialog: SIOP options, Mr. President.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Do you think we’ve reached that
dialog: point, Challie?
speaker_heading: SEC DEF CHALMERS
dialog: I think all our options need to be on
dialog: the table. We need to be ready.
text: The President nods, looks to the Mil Aide who steps up. As
text: he turns the combination on the briefcase...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. NATIONAL MILITARY COMMAND CENTER - PENTAGON - NIGHT
text: A flashy high tech room. Right now the screens flooded with
text: information on Russia. A PHONE set by itself starts to RING.
text: A 3-STAR GENERAL answers: it can only be one person.
speaker_heading: 3-STAR
dialog: Yes, Mr. President...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 92.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY ONE - LOWER BUNKER - NIGHT
text: SIG-Sauer leading the way, Salt makes her way along.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LOWER BUNKER OPERATIONS CENTER - NIGHT
text: Winter watches anxiously as the President and the Mil Aide,
text: both on separate phones, both in the middle of reading code
dialog: off of cards.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT MIL AIDE
scene_heading: ...Z-evergreen-9-X-7-Memphis-— ...Trinidad-7-J-S-A-copper-5-
dialog: . T.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: 3-STAR’S VOICE
dialog: (over phone)
dialog: Authentication codes confirmed.
text: The briefcase has been attached by a high speed cable to the
text: control panel. The president sets his palm down on the
text: briefcase’s built-in BIOMETRIC SCANNER. As it read his
dialog: fingerprints, flashes identity confirmed --
text: --The op center screens fill with similar information as
dialog: those at the Pentagon.
text: But suddenly another screen is more interesting.
speaker_heading: TECH THREE
dialog: Look at this.
text: The control tech has stopped the scroll at a particular
text: security camera image: The two secret service agents now semi-
text: conscious outside the closed portal door.
text: Agent Jenks steps over, switches to an IMAGE of another AGENT
text: in a hallway. We see him up close, face forward. Standing
text: there. On guard.
speaker_heading: AGENT JENKS
dialog: (into radio)
dialog: Simmons, what do you got out there?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY TWO - LBOC - NIGHT
text: Agent Simmons standing stock still. Just around the corner a
text: few feet ahead of him (out of camera range), Salt points a
text: gun straight at his head. She looks to his radio, nods.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: AGENT SIMMONS
dialog: (into radio)
dialog: I’m all clear.
text: Salt motions him to step toward her.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LOWER BUNKER OPERATIONS CENTER - NIGHT
text: As Agent Jenks reacts.
speaker_heading: AGENT JENKS
dialog: (to room)
dialog: Something’s wrong. He just said the
dialog: distress words.
text: On screen: Agent Simmons steps forward out of sight.
text: Agent Jenks switches camera views to the other hallway. We
text: see Salt clock Simmons across the head with the barrel of her
text: gun. Down he goes.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Who the hell is she?
scene_heading: SECRET SERVICE AGENT
text: That’s a NATO uniform. A major.
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: That’s Evelyn Salt. She killed
dialog: Maelev. She’s the Russian.
text: Another SCREEN shows Salt advancing down a hall.
speaker_heading: AGENT JENKS
dialog: She’s coming this way.
text: Agent Jenks and his other two agents all point their guns at
text: the door. Agent Jenks has an UZI on a sling, his SIG-SAUER
text: still holstered.
speaker_heading: AGENT JENKS (CONT’D)
dialog: (to Tech Three)
dialog: Close that door.
text: Tech Three hits a switch. Agent Jenks glances to the
text: security camera view of the hallway outside the door. Empty.
speaker_heading: AGENT JENKS (CONT’D)
dialog: (into radio)
dialog: I need every agent in the facility to
dialog: the ops center. We are breached. At
text: least one intruder in a NATO uniform.
dialog: 94.
text: And the HEAVY DOOR slides into place, seats and seals itself
text: with a hermetic whoosh. No sooner done then...
text: The security cam shows Salt arrive at the closed door, the
text: SIG-SAUER in one hand, Simmons’ Uzi in the other.
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: Give me your pistol; I’m qualified on
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: AGENT JENKS
dialog: No. Only the Secret Service possess
text: firearms in the President’s vicinity.
text: Winter stepping up alongside Agent Jenks.
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: Screw protocol! There’s an enemy
dialog: agent out here!
text: Tough minded Jenks shakes his head. All eyes on the screen
text: as Salt looks for a way to open the door. There is none.
speaker_heading: AGENT JENKS
dialog: Protocol is protocol.
text: Without warning, Winter grabs the handle of Jenks’ SIG-Sauer
text: and turns it inward (still holstered) and FIRES twice through
text: Jenks’ chest.
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: And dead is dead.
text: As Jenks falls, Winter smoothly intercepts his Uzi, opens
text: fire across the room. RAT-A-TAT. SecDef Chalmers and the
text: two other Secret Service Agents go down as well as the Lead
dialog: and Second Tech.
text: Winter has to move to the side to kill the Mil Aide who has
text: taken cover behind the console.
speaker_heading: SALT
text: Hears the muffled sounds of GUNFIRE within.
scene_heading: LOWER BUNKER OPERATIONS CENTER
text: Winter swings on Miller, who blinks in astonishment.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: But... I’m the National Security
dialog: Advisor.
dialog: 95.
text: A BURST and he’s no longer employed. Winter steps forward to
text: blow away the third tech cowering behind the console.
text: As the President goes for one of the fallen agent’s guns,
text: Winter swings the Uzi practically into his face. The
text: President freezes.
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: Sit - down.
text: The President does as he’s told.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: My name, Mr. President, is Nikolai
dialog: Tarkovsky. And I am the last person
dialog: you will ever meet.
speaker_heading: SALT — HALLWAY
text: Turning at a set of RUNNING FOOTSTEPS. Salt runs to meet
text: them at the corner. Barrelling into --
text: -- TWO more AGENTS. A leg sweep on one, DISCHARGING his gun
text: into the ceiling as he falls.
text: The heel of her palm up under the chin of the second. A
text: brutal knee drives him back into the wall.
text: She knocks his gun away, wheels to head kick the first agent
text: on the ground. He’s out, but Salt --
text: -- Catches an elbow in the face from the second agent. She
text: comes up under his guard, digs her fists into either side of
text: his rib cage and then HEADBUTTS him into unconsciousness.
scene_heading: LOWER BUNKER OPERATIONS CENTER
text: The President and Winter react as on screen: the Agent drops
text: unconscious and Salt disappears around the corner.
speaker_heading: WINTER (CONT'D)
dialog: (re: football)
dialog: Let’s look at some selective attack
dialog: options. Russian military,
dialog: industrial and civilian targets.
text: The President is frightened, but defiant.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Go to hell.
dialog: 96.
text: As the President moves to stand - WHACK! - Winter pistol
text: whips him across the head. As he falls unconscious.
text: Winter types into the football’s keyboard to access a
dialog: selective attack option or SAO.
text: And suddenly Salt can be seen through the glass entering the
text: CONFERENCE ROOM. She looks in, sees the blood on the glass,
text: on the walls. Sees the President clutching his bloody arm.
text: But mostly she sees Winter there Uzi in hand.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: Ted?
text: Reacting to her voice over the speaker, Winter sees Salt: her
text: nose bleeding, a SIG-Sauer in one hand, an UZI in the other.
text: He gives her an odd smile. Scanning the console, he throws a
text: switch on the speaker on his side.
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: <Privyet, Comrade Chenkov. We are
dialog: about to set the world on fire.>
speaker_heading: CONFERENCE ROOM
text: As Salt stares at him, still tries to understand.
speaker_heading: WINTER (CONT'D)
dialog: (over speakers)
dialog: <You don't know how many times I
dialog: almost confided in you. Almost told
dialog: you everything. I was the prototype.
dialog: Comrade Zykov's first born. The rest
dialog: of you were all modelled after me.>
dialog: Salt responds in English.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: Open the door. Let me in.
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: Oh, let’s speak in Russian. How I
dialog: longed for it over the years. To
dialog: speak my native tongue.
dialog: (laughs )
dialog: You know, I used to go to the Lincoln
text: Memorial. When it was deserted. At
dialog: one, two in the morning. And I would
text: whisper to him in Russian.
dialog: (grins)
dialog: <Privyet, Abraham.>
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: <Let me in.>
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: <I think it's better for you to stay
dialog: out there. There may be more Secret
dialog: Service Agents to deal with.>
text: She nods, agrees, then suddenly raises the SIG-Sauer and --
text: BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! -- she fires three shots in about a second.
text: At Winter. Who just stands there a foot from the glass.
text: He looks at three slugs that should have slammed through his
text: head, but are now embedded in the very bullet-proof glass.
text: As he looks back to her...
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: You told Zykov, didn’t you? About
dialog: Mike. You told him my loyalty needed
dialog: to be tested.
text: Winter taps the glass by the bullets with his finger.
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: Didn’t it?
text: She looks past him to a MONITOR running CNN, smiles.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: There’s your answer.
text: Winter sees the report on screen: BORIS MAELEV can be seen
text: descending the stairs from the Russian Air Force One.
text: Winter hits the volume.
speaker_heading: CNN ANCHOR’S VOICE
dialog: Once again - Boris Maelev, the
dialog: Russian President is alive. You are
text: watching live footage as he arrives
dialog: at Moscow’s Vnukovo Airport. Initial
dialog: reports indicate some form of
dialog: temporary paralysis...
text: Stunned, Winter looks back to Salt.
speaker_heading: SALT
text: Once his doctors run the tests, they
dialog: may or may not find the toxin of a
dialog: beetle, Dermestes Vulpinus.
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: Traitor! You fucking traitor!>
dialog: 98.
text: Winter flinches at a RATCHET OF GUNFIRE as Salt unloads the
text: Uzi into the glass. In acircle. She grabs a chair from the
dialog: conference table.
text: SCREAMING, she flings in into the center of the bullet
text: circle. It bounces off.
speaker_heading: WINTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Made in America, huh?
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: I’m going to kill you.
text: The computer console BEEPS and the screen lists the SAO’s.
text: With Russian TARGET MAPS.
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Excuse us now, we have a launch to
dialog: initiate.
text: Winter types into the briefcase. Salt can see the target
text: screens through the glass.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: At Russia? Doesn’t that make you the
dialog: traitor?
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: We are not loyal to mother Russia,
dialog: Chenkov. We are loyal to Oleg Zykov.
text: She stares a beat as Winter continues to type.
text: Then she focuses beyond, on the inside of the locked HEAVY
text: DOOR. Her eyes focus in on the panel control to the right
text: side of it, gauging its placement. Then Salt dashes out.
scene_heading: HALLWAY OUTSIDE LBOC DOORWAY
text: As one of the agents regains consciousness - WHAM! - Salt
text: puts him out again.
text: Rolling him over she pulls FIVE CLIPS from his ammo holster.
text: She slaps the first into the Uzi, unloads the entire clip
text: into the wall to the left (from this side) of the door.
scene_heading: LOWER BUNKER OPERATIONS CENTER
text: Winter looking over at the surveillance screen as Salt
text: unloads clip number two. Then she looks directly into the
text: screen, aims the SIG-Sauer and off the muzzle flash --
text: The screen goes black.
dialog: 99.
text: Winter turns back to what he’s doing. As we hear the
text: percussive thumping of the third clip...
text: The screen flashes: Identity Confirmation Requested.
text: Winter hauls the unconscious President over, sets his palm on
text: the briefcase’s scanner. A beat and then...
text: The screen flashes: COUNTDOWN INITIATED... 00:01:00...
dialog: 00:00:59...
scene_heading: HALLWAY OUTSIDE LBOC DOORWAY
text: RAT-A-RAT-A-TAT. Salt tosses away the Uzi, then starts with
text: the SIG-Sauer, aiming the barrel straight into a hole torn
text: into the wall. The rounds explode! Then another clip and
text: ten more shots.
scene_heading: LOWER BUNKER OPERATIONS CENTER
text: Winter has one eye on the countdown (00:00:48) and another on
dialog: the door.
scene_heading: HALLWAY OUTSIDE LBOC DOORWAY
text: A heavy metal ELECTRIC HOUSING is torn open enough to expose
text: the wiring inside.
text: Salt leans into the hole in the wall, eyes scanning.
text: She drops the gun, then pinches out TWO WIRES, STRIPS them
text: with her TEETH. As she’s about to twist them together...
speaker_heading: VOICE
speaker_heading: FREEZE!
text: A NEW AGENT in the hallway, drawn down dead at her.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: Not now...
speaker_heading: NEW AGENT
dialog: Step away from what you’re doing.
text: A beat as Salt considers her options, then starts twisting
text: the wires together.
text: The agent FIRES TWICE, hitting her in the chest. As she hits
dialog: the deck...
text: The door gives off a PNEUMATIC HISS as it disengages.
dialog: 100.
scene_heading: LOWER BUNKER OPERATIONS CENTER
dialog: 00:00:36...
text: Winter aiming as the door slides back TO REVEAL the new agent
text: crossing by. BLAM! Winter fires, kills him.
scene_heading: HALLWAY OUTSIDE LBOC DOORWAY
text: Salt’s shirt shredded where the rounds tore through into her
dialog: Kevlar.
text: She picks up the pistol, rolls to a crouch and catapults
dialog: herself into the...
scene_heading: LOWER BUNKER OPERATIONS CENTER
text: Winter firing high as she comes in low.
text: She tumbles across the floor, leaps, taking a bullet in the
text: Kevlar chest, spinning, knocking the gun from Winter’s hand.
dialog: 00:00:30...
text: Winter catches her with a right, a left, blood flying.
text: Salt ducks under a third blow, tackling Winter across one of
dialog: the consoles.
text: She rises up, swings down. Whump, whump, whump...
dialog: 00:00:25...
text: Winter reaches, grabs Salt by the neck and sends her smashing
text: off the console.
dialog: Winter goes for the dropped gun...
text: Salt crashing across him.
dialog: 00:00:19...
text: He backfists her, snaps back her head. Follows with a
text: vicious kick into her side.
text: As Salt goes down, he lunges, wraps his hands around her
dialog: throat.
dialog: 00:00:16...
text: Salt manages to get her knee up under Winter's chest, forces
text: him back just far enough to connect with a wicked right
text: elbow, then swings back with a left.
dialog: 101.
text: A two-inch GASH opens over Winter’s eyebrow, BLOOD pouring.
dialog: 00:00:13...
text: But they’re near the gun. As Winter grabs it, she catches
text: his wrist, twists his arm into a submission...
text: He strains until - SNAP - his arm breaks.
text: As Winter howls, she grabs a handful of hair, pounds his head
text: into the floor, over and over, until she sees...
dialog: 00:00:09..
text: Salt releases Winter, scrambles to the President.
text: He’s groggy, half-conscious.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: Don’t worry, Mr. President, I voted
dialog: for you.
dialog: 00:00:07...
text: She sets his hand on the scanner. As it reads...
dialog: 00:00:03...
text: Salt slaps the ABORT BUTTON. The countdown freezes at
text: 00:00:01. As it does, Winter staggers to his feet.
text: Sees TWO AGENTS rush past the glass. On their way.
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: (for show)
dialog: Help me!
text: FOOTFALLS in the hall. As he grins at Salt --
text: She takes a hard step forward, KICKS Winter full in the face,
text: drives the bone of his nose up and into his brain.
text: Salt immediately raises her hands over her head --
text: -- As the two agents enter, guns pointed.
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: On the floor!
text: She obeys. Finds herself looking across at Winter who stares
text: lifelessly at the ceiling, his face flat. And as Salt closes
dialog: her eyes...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 102.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - NIGHT
scene_heading: FEDERAL CARS, POLICE CARS, SWAT WAGONS, NEWS VANS. This
dialog: place is the center of the Universe right now.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. JAIL WARD - HOSPITAL - NIGHT
text: Salt seated at a table. Still in her NATO uniform pants and
text: T-shirt. Teeth chipped, her arms covered in bruises, nose
text: broken. Two HUGE COPS stand watching her.
text: She folds a piece of paper. Under her breath, as she folds:
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: I pledge allegiance to the flag.
dialog: (another fold)
dialog: Of the United states of America.
dialog: (another )
dialog: And to the republic for which it
dialog: stands.
dialog: (another )
text: One nation, under God, indivisible.
dialog: (another )
dialog: With liberty and justice...
dialog: A final fold.
speaker_heading: SALT (CONT'D)
dialog: For all.
text: Peabody enters, sits across the table from her.
text: Salt holds up a rough paper approximation of a folded napkin:
text: it almost looks like a flower.
speaker_heading: SALT (CONT'D)
dialog: Lily goblet fold... In my new life
dialog: I’m trying not to be so utilitarian.
speaker_heading: PEABODY
dialog: Cigarette?
text: He offers from a pack. She takes one. As he lights it...
speaker_heading: PEABODY (CONT'D)
text: Someone stopped the missile launch.
dialog: The president was unconscious. That
dialog: means it was either you or Winter.
dialog: And the President says Winter started
dialog: it. So...?
text: She doesn’t answer.
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: PEABODY (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you save the world, Salt?
text: She still doesn’t answer.
speaker_heading: PEABODY (CONT'D)
dialog: If so, who did you save it from?
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: Them.
speaker_heading: PEABODY
dialog: Define ‘them’.
text: She doesn’t answer, finally...
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: Me...
text: She looks up, at some fixed spot above and past him. Looks
dialog: about as sad as can be.
speaker_heading: PEABODY
dialog: Listen, Salt. Winter we can figure
text: out. He led a life, he left a trail.
dialog: We'll trace it back. We will fucking
dialog: dissect him if we have to. But
dialog: Zykov’s still out there. We may have
text: a chance to get him before he leaves
dialog: the country.
text: She’s CRYING now. Finally really crying even though she’s
text: from Grozny. As she looks at whatever she’s focused on.
text: Peabody looks back over his shoulder.
text: High up, the CHICKEN WIRE GLASS was struck at some point in
text: the past. A roundish “SPIDER-WEBBED” crack radiates out.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: (still looking)
dialog: They killed my husband. And I
dialog: watched and I did nothing. Because
dialog: of that goddamn vow I took.
speaker_heading: PEABODY
dialog: What? Some KGB vow?
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: CIA. Remember? Country, duty, and
dialog: the greater fucking good.
dialog: (a painful beat)
dialog: I guess I’m wired that way.
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: PEABODY
dialog: Where'd they do it? Where’d they
dialog: kill Mike? Tell me so I can go after
dialog: Zykov.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: You know why Mike liked spiders? It
dialog: was the webs. He knew everything
dialog: about webs. He even memorized this
dialog: poem. And taught it to me.
text: (finally looks at him)
dialog: You want to hear it?
speaker_heading: PEABODY
dialog: (humoring her)
dialog: Sure.
text: Salt wipes her eyes, starts so softly:
speaker_heading: SALT
text: The spider, dropping down from twig,
text: unfolds a plan of her devising, a
text: thin premeditated rig, to use in
dialog: rising. And all that journey down
text: through space, in cool descent and
text: loyal hearted, she spins a ladder to
dialog: the place from where she started.
dialog: Thus I, gone forth as spiders do, in
text: spider's web a truth discerning,
dialog: attach one silken thread to you, for
dialog: my returning.
text: And despite all his stoic professionalism, Peabody’s heart
text: breaks a little for Salt.
text: She squeezes her eyes shut, mourning, body wracked, but no
text: sound coming out. As she gets control again...
speaker_heading: SALT (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s a love poem you see? He told me
dialog: that every time I saw a spider web,
dialog: every time, I should remember how
dialog: much he loved me.
dialog: Now we know what Mike told her before he died.
text: She points back at the spider-webbed glass.
speaker_heading: SALT (CONT'D)
dialog: Once you stop looking for them, you
dialog: see them everywhere.
speaker_heading: PEABODY
dialog: I’m sorry about him, Salt.
dialog: 105.
text: She accepts it with a nod, doesn’t say anything.
speaker_heading: PEABODY (CONT'D)
dialog: But Zykov. Give me something.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: His name’s not really Zykov. That's
dialog: just what he called himself.
speaker_heading: PEABODY
dialog: Then what is it? Help me.
text: Silence. Absolute dead silence. And suddenly Salt’s jaw
text: tenses... As she grits her teeth and we hear a CRACK.
text: As Peabody reacts, she smiles.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: They gave us all these teeth. That’s
dialog: why I killed Winter. So he couldn't
dialog: do it himself.
dialog: (shrugs )
dialog: Cyanide.
text: And Salt’s eyes ROLL BACK WHITE in her head. And her body is
text: WRACKED IN SEIZURE.
speaker_heading: PEABODY
dialog: Shit!
text: His chair falling over as he jumps up.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
text: Salt being raced down a hallway on a gurney, body straining
text: in convulsions against the strap. Peabody alongside her.
text: As a DOCTOR joins them from an INTERSECTING HALLWAY.
speaker_heading: PEABODY
dialog: Goddamn Cyanide.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT
text: In she comes, met by a team.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Hydroxocobalamin!
dialog: 106.
text: A NURSE hands him a SYRINGE. As he’s about to inject her,
text: Salt grabs his wrist, bends it back sending him howling.
dialog: She faked it!
text: Peabody stepping forward as she pulls loose the chest strap.
text: She catches him with a knee as she rolls off the gurney.
text: Catches him in a headlock up under his windpipe.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: You really care about me...
dialog: (straining)
dialog: I’m touched.
text: And she rams his head into the wall knocking him unconscious.
text: And then she’s through the doors further into the hospital,
text: leaving the uproar in the OR behind her.
text: And as we PAN UP into the BRIGHT WHITE LIGHTS overhead,
dialog: leaving the sound to fade away, we...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
speaker_heading: THE SUN

text: A wall papered with a faded floor-to-ceiling TROPICAL SCENE.
text: A beach with a coconut palm growing out over the water.
text: Sitting at his large, pointless desk is Zykov. As he sips a
text: cup of tea, a RAP at the door.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV
dialog: <Enter.>
text: The door opens. An UNDERLING sticks his head in.
speaker_heading: UNDERLING
dialog: <We have a walk-in. Female Chinese.
dialog: She asked to speak to you.>
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV
dialog: <To me? Does she speak Russian?>
text: As the underling shrugs.
speaker_heading: UNDERLING
dialog: <Tolerably.>
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - - DREARY GOVERNMENT OFFICE - DAY
text: Carrying his tea, Zykov stops at the door, looks through a
text: little window set in it. A WOMAN sits at the familiar little
text: table, head bowed, black hair in a tight bun.
text: Zykov enters, sets down his teacup and sits across from her.
speaker_heading: ZYKOV
dialog: <How can I help you?>
text: No answer. Zykov frowns. Suddenly doesn’t like being in
text: here with whoever this is. He subtly reaches under the desk.
speaker_heading: ANGLE UNDERNEATH
text: As he presses a BUTTON under there. He can’t see that the
text: wires have been torn out.
speaker_heading: ROOM
text: The Chinese woman finally speaks.
speaker_heading: HER VOICE
dialog: <It’'s been disabled.>
text: She looks up. Chinese, though perhaps on the Eurasian side.
text: Of course Zykov recognizes EVELYN SALT when he sees her.
text: A nervous beat then...
speaker_heading: ZYKOV
dialog: Have you come to kiss the ring?
text: She shakes her head. No, she hasn’t. Something ferocious
text: about her. Something vibrant.
