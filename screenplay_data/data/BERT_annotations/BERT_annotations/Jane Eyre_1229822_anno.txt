scene_heading: EXT. A MIDSUMMER DAWN. THORNFIELD - THE GROUNDS.
dialog: 
text: First light. Jane Eyre is running across a meadow, flushed
text: and breathless; the hem of her plain, black dress soaked
text: with dew. She carries a shawl and has a small bag of
text: belongings over her shoulder.
dialog: 
text: She trips, falls to her knees; looks back. Expressive eyes,
text: open features. She is desperate. We see the house she is
text: running from; a Jacobean battlemented mansion.
dialog: 
text: Her need to escape is so great that she crawls forward
text: until she is able to raise herself to her feet. She runs.
dialog: 
text: She reaches an antique stile by a brook. She lifts herself
text: on to it. She lands on the road. And runs.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: I/E. DAY. A ROADSIDE/COACH.
dialog: 
text: The sun is higher in the sky. Jane exhausted, now running
text: down a main road. Her spirts lift at the sight of an
text: approaching coach. She flags it down.
dialog: 
text: Jane empties her purse into the driver's hand. He looks at
text: her money then suspiciously back at her. A terse nod
text: indicates she can get in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Jane sinks into a dark corner. Her fellow passengers look
text: shocked by her dishevelled appearance at such an early
text: hour. She undertakes a tremendous effort not to betray her
text: emotional state. She doesn't sob, she doesn't howl -
text: although her breathing threatens to. Slowly, unable to bear
text: the day, she closes her eyes.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. EVENING. WHITCROSS.
dialog: 
text: Sunset. A whitewashed, stone pillar set up where four roads
text: meet on a barren moor. The coach driver opens the door.
text: With a curt nod he indicates that Jane must get out.
dialog: 
text: She looks around, dismayed. In each direction there is open
text: moorland for as far as the eye can see. The driver sets off
text: at a good pace - glad to be rid of such a passenger. Jane
text: puts her hand to her side for her bag of belongings. It is
dialog: not there.
dialog: 
text: She runs as fast as she can after the coach. It is receding
text: towards the horizon. She comes to a halt, objectless, lost,
text: alone. She pulls her knitted shawl around her.
dialog: 
text: She leaves the road and sets off across the moor, into the
text: gathering dark.
dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NIGHT. THE MOOR.
dialog: 
text: Jane is on her knees by a strange overhanging rock. The
text: night sky is awesome; the universe is all around her. She
text: is trying to calm herself with a prayer.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DAY. THE MOOR.
dialog: 
text: Jane lies on a great rock, soaking up the heat of the sun.
text: She is like someone numb with pain. She watches a lizard
text: crawl over the rock. She is mesmerised.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TWILIGHT. THE MOOR.
dialog: 
text: Jane squats in the heather and eats bilberries as the light
text: fades. She hungrily licks the juice from her hand.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DAWN. THE MOOR.
dialog: 
text: Jane is asleep in the heather, her shawl wrapped around
text: her. A red-haired child in a white nightgown lies by her
text: side, watching her. It is Helen Burns.
dialog: 
text: Helen reaches out. She touches Jane's hand. Jane wakes. She
text: sits up. She is alone.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DAY. BY A RIVER.
dialog: 
text: Jane is crouched on a rock watching the waters go by. The
text: sky is overcast. The first big drops of rain land on the
text: stones. Jane makes no movement.
dialog: 
text: A raven lands on a rock nearby. Jane is suddenly filled
text: with a wild rage. She picks up a stone and hurls it at the
text: bird with a raw cry. The gesture exhausts her. She watches
text: the bird wheel away, as the rain starts to pour.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TWILIGHT. A FARM BY A WOOD.
dialog: 
text: It is raining hard. Jane sees a small girl come out of the
text: farm with some leftovers. She drops them into a pigpen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Jane leaning into the pigpen. She picks a stiffened mould
text: of porridge out of the mud. She lets the rain wash it. She
text: eats it ravenously.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NEXT DAY. A WOOD.
dialog: 
text: It has stopped raining. Jane is huddled under a tree. She
text: is shaking, shuddering. The life has gone out of her eyes.
dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 3.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DAY. THE EDGE OF THE WOOD.
dialog: 
text: The moors rise away above her to the horizon. Jane looks up
text: at the sun starting to set. The clouds are red and gold.
dialog: 
text: She sees a small red-haired girl in a white nightgown
text: walking barefoot on the moors ahead of her. The girl turns,
text: looks back at Jane. With her last strength, Jane follows.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. EVENING. THE MOOR.
dialog: 
text: Dark clouds are banking up; the rain starts again. Jane is
text: struggling through a marsh. Her boots are stuck.
dialog: 
text: She falls. Her hand disappears into mud; her face pressed
text: against the earth. She doesn't move. She has reached the
text: point of despair.
dialog: 
text: The girl's bare feet walk close by, as if waiting for her.
text: Jane looks up. Where the child should be, she sees a light
text: shining across the moor. Jane starts crawling.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NIGHT. THE MOOR/MOOR HOUSE.
dialog: 
text: Jane is toiling on through the lashing rain towards the
text: light. It has become a window. A brief flash of lightning
text: shows her a low stone cottage. Helen Burns is sitting on
dialog: the gate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Jane is crawling through the narrow garden. On her knees,
text: she peers through a window.
dialog: 
text: On either side of a bright little fire sit two young women.
text: They look exactly like Jane; slight, neat, dressed in
text: black. One, Diana, has her hair slightly curled and hides
text: her gentle eyes behind spectacles. The other, Mary, is very
text: young; no more than seventeen. Each has a book on her knee.
text: They are talking intimately.
dialog: 
text: They look so close, so loving and the room looks so cosy
dialog: that it pains Jane considerably.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Jane knocking at the door. Hannah, an old servant answers.
text: She is suspicious; Jane looks like a wretch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: What do you want?
dialog: 
text: Jane manages to find her voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Shelter.
dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: I can't take in vagrants. Here's
dialog: a penny. Now take it and go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I have no strength to go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: You can move off. And if there
dialog: are others with you tell them we
dialog: are not alone. We have a
dialog: gentleman here, and dogs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
speaker_heading: (DESPERATE)
dialog: But I must die if I am turned
dialog: away.
dialog: 
text: The door slams shut. Jane lets out a hopeless wail.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: God help me. I will die.
dialog: 
text: She turns away, her hope gone. As she collapses, she finds
text: herself supported by a strong pair of black-clad arms.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ST JOHN
dialog: All of God's creatures must die.
dialog: But not prematurely - and not on
dialog: my doorstep I hope.
dialog: 
text: Jane is lifted up. She finds herself looking into the face
text: of the handsomest man she has ever seen; St John Rivers. He
text: lifts her over the threshold into the warmth of Moor House.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NIGHT. MOOR HOUSE - THE KITCHEN.
dialog: 
text: A fire is roaring in the stove. Hannah is bent over it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: We've had a beggar woman come, Mr
dialog: Rivers. I sent her - For shame!
dialog: 
text: Hannah falls silent as she sees Jane.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ST JOHN
dialog: You did your duty in excluding
dialog: her. Let me do mine in admitting
dialog: her.
dialog: 
text: He sets Jane down before the hearth. She can barely stand.
text: She is soaked to the bone, filthy with mud. Her skin has a
text: ghastly pallor. Diana and Mary enter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: St John, who is it?
dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ST JOHN
dialog: I don't know; I found her at the
dialog: door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
speaker_heading: (GUILTILY)
dialog: I thought her one of the gypsies
text: from the cross.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARY
text: She's as white as death.
dialog: 
text: Jane can hold herself up no longer. Diana moves forward.
text: She and St John catch Jane and help her into a chair. The
text: rain hammers on the windows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Hannah, some water.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARY
text: She's worn to nothing. She looks
dialog: like a spectre. St John, if you
dialog: hadn't taken her in, we would
text: have fallen upon her dead body in
dialog: the morning.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Mary.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ST JOHN
dialog: She's no vagrant; I'm sure of it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: There's milk and bread for you.
dialog: 
text: Jane tries to mouth her thanks. She sips the milk. Eats a
text: mouthful of bread. Diana kneels at her side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ST JOHN
dialog: Ask her her name.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I - I am J -
dialog: 
text: Jane cannot speak. She's incapable of uttering her own
text: name. She hears John Reed's voice calling from far away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN REED
dialog: Jane Eyre!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Please, tell us how we may help
dialog: you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ST JOHN
dialog: Can we send for anyone? Who are
dialog: your people?
dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The questions are deeply troubling to Jane. She is losing
dialog: consciousness.
dialog: 
text: She sees an image of a small girl of ten, running away
text: through a great darkening room. Jane tries to follow her.
text: The action draws her up out of the kitchen chair.
dialog: 
text: She hears John Reed's voice again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN REED (V.O.)
dialog: Jane Eyre! Where are you?
dialog: 
text: Jane, panicked, looking for somewhere to hide, passes out.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DAY. GATESHEAD - A GRAND RECEPTION ROOM.
dialog: 
text: Rain hammers against the windows. Jane aged ten, looking
text: hunted, runs in looking for somewhere to hide.
dialog: 
text: She springs behind a curtain. John Reed enters; a fourteen
text: year old, his stomach bursting out of his fancy clothes. He
text: is holding a riding crop as if it is a sword.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN REED
dialog: Come out, rat. I know you are in
dialog: here. Come out now and I won't
dialog: punish you.
dialog: 
text: Jane watches him pass by her. He practises a perfect lunge.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN REED (CONT'D)
dialog: Rat.
dialog: 
text: He exits. Jane breathes a sigh of relief. She slowly pulls
text: the curtain across, making the window a private sanctuary.
text: There is a book lying on the seat. She opens it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Jane is sitting cross-legged, completely absorbed in her
text: book - a beautifully drawn picture of a cormorant. She runs
text: her finger over it. We hear the sound of great waves
text: plunging on to a shore.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DAY. AN ARCTIC COAST.
dialog: 
text: Jane, aged ten, is sitting cross-legged on an isolated
text: rock, her eyes locked with those of a stooping black
text: cormorant. St John's voice comes from a long way away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ST JOHN (V.O.)
dialog: Diana, Mary help me get her
dialog: upstairs...
dialog: 
text: The cormorant raises its wings like a great black cloak.
text: Jane watches as it takes off and flies away.
dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DAY. GATESHEAD - THE WINDOW SEAT.
dialog: 
text: Jane has her eyes closed. A great Atlantic wave hits the
text: sash window behind her, drenching it with foam and brine.
text: Suddenly the curtain is pulled back. John Reed stands in
text: front of her. Jane shrinks back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN REED
dialog: I have been looking for you these
dialog: last ten minutes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What do you want?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN REED
dialog: Say forgive me, Master Reed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I have done nothing wrong. Master
dialog: Reed.
dialog: 
text: John grabs the book.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN REED
dialog: Who gave you permission to read
dialog: my book?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I wasn't aware it was yours.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN REED
dialog: Everything in this house is mine.
dialog: You're lucky to live here with
dialog: gentleman's children like us.
dialog: Your father had nothing. You
dialog: should go and beg.
dialog: 
text: Jane stares him out. John can sense her contempt. He belts
text: her with the book. Jane hits her head on the window clasp,
text: drawing blood. She is shocked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN REED (CONT'D)
dialog: That's for the look you had on
dialog: your face. You bad animal.
dialog: 
text: Jane snaps. She throws herself upon him, the rage in her
text: released; pummelling, scratching, hurting him in any way
text: she can. She is barely coherent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Wicked and cruel - you are a
dialog: slaver - a murderer -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I shall tell mother -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I hate you John Reed. I hate you -
dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 8.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: John is flabbergasted. Like all bullies, he is terrified.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Mamma! Mamma! There's a rat! Rat!
dialog: 
text: Jane bites him. Hard. At that moment, Mrs Reed appears on
text: the scene. John screams. We see Mrs Reed's shocked face.
text: She is an overweight woman pushing forty in a bright,
text: elaborate dress.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NIGHT. MOOR HOUSE - A BEDROOM
dialog: 
text: Dinah and Mary are gently taking Jane's soaking clothes
text: off; one at each side of her. Jane is distressed,
text: approaching a delirium. She resists them.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DUSK. GATESHEAD - THE RED ROOM.
dialog: 
text: Jane is carried in and set down on a footstool by two
text: servants, Miss Abbot and Bessie - one at each side of her.
text: She is still resisting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BESSIE
dialog: For shame, hitting your master.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISS ABBOT
dialog: If you don't sit still you must
dialog: be tied down!
dialog: 
text: The fight goes out of Jane. She sits, defeated. Bessie,
text: young and plump, quickly wipes her bleeding forehead. She
dialog: has some compassion. Miss Abbot has none.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BESSIE
dialog: What we do is for your own good.
dialog: If you are passionate and rude
dialog: like this, your Aunt Reed will
dialog: send you away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISS ABBOT
dialog: You're worse than us servants. We
dialog: work for our keep; you do
dialog: nothing. Pray for forgiveness
dialog: Miss Eyre or something bad will
dialog: come down that chimney and fetch
dialog: you away.
dialog: 
text: The door slams. They are gone. Jane slowly grips the edge
text: of the stool. The room is chill, silent. Red walls and
text: curtains, murky in the fading light.
dialog: 
text: In front of Jane, a stone fireplace gapes like a mouth.
text: Beside it, a full length looking-glass in which her pale
text: reflection stares out. Behind her, a bed supported on
text: pillars of mahogany, hung with red.
dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 9.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The piled up pillows and mattresses glare in cold white.
text: Jane's breathing is the only sound in the room.
dialog: 
text: A sudden gust sends rain pelting against the windows like
text: fingernails. A distant moan of wind seems to breathe out of
text: the black hearth. Jane reverts her nervous gaze to the
text: pitted mirror. Her eyes lock on the small figure trapped in
text: the mirror's visionary hollow; her white, bleeding face,
text: her eyes glittering with fear.
dialog: 
text: It is a phantom. The eyes are black, the skin a deathly
text: grey. Blood. Jane's breathing becomes choked with terror.
text: She can't get her breath. We hear blood rushing through her
text: ears. It sounds like the beating of great wings.
dialog: 
text: Slowly, a light appears over her. It may be something
text: shining in from outside. But to Jane it seems as if it is
text: surrounding her, enveloping her. The figure in the looking
text: glass opens its mouth. The scream, held in so long, finally
text: rips from Jane's throat.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DUSK. GATESHEAD - THE FIRESIDE.
dialog: 
text: At the sound of the scream, Mrs Reed, slumbering, almost
text: jumps out of her skin.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DUSK. GATESHEAD - THE KITCHEN.
dialog: 
text: Miss Abbott almost drops the tea tray she is carrying.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DUSK. GATESHEAD - A CORRIDOR.
dialog: 
text: Jane is banging on the door, screaming, hysterical with
text: terror. Bessie rushes to the door and unlocks it. Jane
text: flies into her arms.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BESSIE
dialog: Miss Eyre what is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Bessie!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BESSIE
dialog: Have you seen something?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
text: There was a light.
dialog: 
text: We see Bessie's own fear as she glances into the dark room.
text: Mrs Reed is storming towards them, furious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS REED
dialog: Bessie, I gave orders that she
dialog: was to be left in the red room
dialog: until I came.
dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 10.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BESSIE
dialog: But she screamed so loud ma'am.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS REED
dialog: It is play-acting. Let her go. I
dialog: know your tricks Jane Eyre and I
dialog: abhor such artifice. Loose
text: Bessie's hands, child.
dialog: 
text: Mrs Reed prises Jane away from Bessie as she speaks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS REED (CONT'D)
dialog: You will now stay here an hour
dialog: longer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: No - Aunt, have pity -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS REED
dialog: And only when you are perfectly
dialog: submissive will I let you out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Please - I cannot bear it -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS REED
dialog: Silence. This violence is
dialog: repulsive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I shall be killed -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS REED
dialog: Get back!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Have mercy, have mercy I beg you -
dialog: 
text: Mrs Reed throws her back into the room, slams the door and
text: turns the key. We hear Jane's unspeakable howls of terror,
text: her anguished bangs upon the door.
dialog: 
text: Bessie is looking at Mrs Reed aghast. Mrs Reed withers her
text: with a frozen glare.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DUSK. GATESHEAD - THE RED ROOM.
dialog: 
text: We see Jane in her distress, hitting her head on the door.
text: She falls back. On the floor, her arms and legs move beyond
text: her control. She is having a fit. When it is over, we see
text: Jane unconscious. She is lying in a pool of ghostly light.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DAY. MOOR HOUSE - A BEDROOM.
dialog: 
text: Through the light, Jane sees Mary and Diana Rivers at her
dialog: side.
dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 11.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARY
text: She's awake.
dialog: 
text: St John approaches in his parson's collar, blocking out the
text: light as he looks down. Jane gazes at him remotely.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ST JOHN
dialog: I'm sure we'll find she's simply
dialog: had a misunderstanding with her
dialog: people. I hope she's not done
dialog: anything deplorable; there's
dialog: nothing so sad as a fallen young
dialog: woman.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Look at the suffering in her
text: eyes. They're like dark pools -
dialog: 
text: Diana smiles at Mary's tendency to over-dramatise.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: She has a peculiar face; I rather
dialog: like it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ST JOHN
text: She's not at all handsome.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: She's so ill, St John.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ST JOHN
dialog: Ill or well, she'll always be
dialog: plain.
dialog: 
text: Jane's eyes slide away from him and close.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DAY. GATESHEAD - THE MORNING ROOM.
dialog: 
text: A bright morning. A huge clergyman dressed in black is
text: staring down at Jane, blocking out the sun. We see him from
text: her POV; his expansive chest, dramatic facial hair, huge
text: flared nostrils, frowning brows. He is Brockelhurst, the
dialog: epitome of grim.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BROCKLEHURST
dialog: There is no sight so sad and so
dialog: deplorable as that of a wicked
dialog: little girl. Do you know, Jane
dialog: Eyre, where the wicked go after
dialog: death?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: They go to hell.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BROCKLEHURST
dialog: And what is hell, can you tell me
dialog: that?
dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 12.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
text: A pit full of fire.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BROCKLEHURST
dialog: And should you like to fall into
dialog: that pit and be burning there
dialog: forever?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: No sir.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BROCKLEHURST
dialog: What must you do to avoid it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I must keep in good health and
dialog: not die.
dialog: 
text: Mrs Reed is by the fireside in an ultra-feminine dress. She
text: puts down her tea cup in irritation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS REED
dialog: I've been her sole benefactress
dialog: and her kindest friend. But she
dialog: shows no gratitude and brings
dialog: nothing but discord into my
dialog: house.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BROCKLEHURST
dialog: What is her parentage?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS REED
dialog: She's an orphan. Her mother was my
text: late husband's sister. On his
dialog: deathbed he exhorted me to care for
dialog: her. I have always treated her as
dialog: one of my own.
dialog: 
text: Jane silently revolts against this lie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS REED (CONT'D)
dialog: If you accept her at Lowood school
dialog: Mr Brocklehurst, keep a strict eye
text: on her. Her worst fault is a
dialog: tendency to deceit. I'm sorry to
dialog: tell you that Jane Eyre is a liar.
dialog: 
text: Jane's eyes flash with outrage.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BROCKLEHURST
dialog: All liars will have their portion
text: in the lake burning with fire and
dialog: brimstone. She shall be watched,
dialog: Mrs Reed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS REED
dialog: I wish her to be made useful, to
dialog: be kept humble.
dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 13.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: BROCKLEHURST
dialog: You can rest assured dear lady
dialog: that we mortify our girls in the
text: sentiments of vanity and pride.
dialog: They are taught to be quiet,
text: plain and modest.
dialog: 
text: A passion of resentment is forming in Jane.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BROCKLEHURST (CONT'D)
dialog: We shall root out the wickedness
text: in this small, ungrateful plant.
dialog: 
text: Mrs Reed smiles sweetly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS REED
dialog: And as for its vacations, it must
dialog: spend them all at Lowood.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DAY. GATESHEAD - THE ENTRANCE HALL.
dialog: 
text: Jane is climbing the staircase. John Reed blocks her way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: So, Rat, you're being sent away.
dialog: It's as I thought; you're not fit
dialog: to associate with me.
dialog: 
text: Jane snaps. She cries out:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You are not fit to associate with
dialog: me!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DAY. GATESHEAD - THE MORNING ROOM.
dialog: 
text: Mrs Reed is at her desk. Jane appears in front of her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You said I was a liar. Well I am
dialog: not. If I was, I should say that I
dialog: loved you and I don't. I dislike
dialog: you the worst of anybody in the
dialog: world except John Reed. He is a
dialog: liar, not I.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS REED
dialog: How dare you speak in this manner.

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I'll remember how you thrust me

dialog: 
text: Jane is appalled. But to her astonishment and awe, Helen
text: Burns doesn't cry; she barely changes her expression. As
text: the strokes go on - seven, eight, nine - Helen seems like

dialog: 
text: On the eleventh stroke, the door bursts open and a visiting
text: party walks in: the Brocklehurst family. Miss Temple
text: escorts two young girls dressed in peacock finery and two

speaker_heading: JANE

dialog: Bear what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Being struck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I'm a trial to Miss Scatcherd.

speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: You'd just be punished even more.
dialog: It's part of life here.

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What do you mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Your soul. Your soul is beautiful,
dialog: your soul has value - more value
dialog: than anything on earth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Is that true?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Yes. God sees your beauty. Even
dialog: as you stand on that stool, there

speaker_heading: DIANA
text: St John burns with talents and

scene_heading: INT. DAY. MORTON - THE SCHOOL ROOM.
dialog: 
text: Jane is at the blackboard in a freshly painted school room.
text: In front of her are about twenty village girls, aged from

dialog: 
text: Jane is writing a neat line of 'a's.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NIGHT. MORTON - JANE'S COTTAGE.
dialog: 
text: Jane's first home is like a doll's house. She walks through

text: through the parlour with its tiny fireplace into the
text: scullery kitchen. She retraces her steps back into the
text: parlour. She turns round and surveys it.
dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 29.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Silence but for the crackling of the fire and the blowing
text: of the wind. She feels glad, grateful, but very, very
text: alone. She hears Brocklehurst's voice.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BROCKLEHURST
dialog: I hear you are to leave us, Miss
dialog: Eyre.
dialog: 
text: She spins around as if he is there.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DAY. A CHURCHYARD.
dialog: 
text: Brocklehurst is at the church door; Jane looking at him
text: coldly. She holds a bunch of wild flowers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yes. Excuse me.
dialog: 
text: She walks into the graveyard. There are over forty small
text: graves marked with wooden crosses, each bearing a child's
text: name. One of them says Helen Burns. Jane lays down her
dialog: flowers.
dialog: 
text: She looks up at Brocklehurst. He cannot meet her eye.
dialog: 
text: We hear the voice of Mrs Fairfax.

speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.)
dialog: Jane Eyre is requested to send

dialog: 
text: Jane closes her eyes, trying to banish her thoughts. It is
text: no good. The memories crowd in.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE GROUND FLOOR.
dialog: 
text: A smiling lady dressed in black approaches her through the
dialog: darkness - Mrs Alice Fairfax.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
dialog: How do you do, my dear? What a
dialog: long and tedious journey you must
dialog: have had of it. John is quite the
dialog: slowest driver in the county. You
dialog: must be cold to the bone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Are you Mrs Fairfax?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
dialog: Indeed I am; come and warm
dialog: yourself in here.
dialog: 
text: Mrs Fairfax leads Jane up the dark corridor and into a cosy
text: parlour. Leah, a young maidservant, follows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
dialog: Your poor hands must be quite

dialog: 
text: Mrs Fairfax undoes the ribbon on Jane's bonnet. Jane is
text: taken aback, unused to motherliness of any kind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
dialog: Leah, make a little hot port and
dialog: cut a sandwich or two.
dialog: 
text: Leah eyes Jane with great curiosity. She hurries away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
text: Draw nearer the fire. John is
dialog: taking your trunk up to your room.
dialog: 
text: Knitting apparatus lies abandoned on a fireside chair. Mrs

dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 31.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
dialog: I've put you at the back of the
dialog: house; I hope you don't mind. The
text: rooms at the front have much
dialog: finer furniture but they are so
dialog: gloomy and solitary I think.
dialog: 
text: Jane can't help noticing that every surface is covered in
text: lace, embroidery, or fine crochet. The whole room is an
dialog: advertisement for Mrs Fairfax's skill at handicrafts - and
text: testament to the hours she has spent alone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm so glad you are come. To be
dialog: sure this is a fine old house but
dialog: I must confess that in winter one
dialog: can feel a little dreary and
dialog: alone. Leah is a very nice girl
dialog: and John and Martha good people
dialog: too, but they are servants - and
dialog: one cannot talk to them on terms

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Am I to have the pleasure of

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
dialog: Who?

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Who is Mr Rochester?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
dialog: Why, the owner of Thornfield.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I thought Thornfield Hall
dialog: belonged to you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
dialog: (bursting into laughter)
dialog: Oh bless you child, what an idea.
dialog: To me? I am only the housekeeper.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Forgive me -

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
text: There is a distant connection
dialog: between Mr Rochester and I - his
dialog: mother was a Fairfax - but I'd
dialog: never presume on it. Heavens, me,
dialog: owner of Thornfield?
dialog: 
text: She continues to laugh. A bashful smile is playing on
text: Jane's lips. Mrs Fairfax is beginning to thaw her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE HALL / STAIRCASE.
dialog: 
text: Mrs Fairfax is carrying a lamp across the great hall; the
text: only light. Jane can perceive grandeur looming out of the
text: darkness; Jacobean fireplace, coat of arms, head of a stag.
text: Very gloomy, eerie. Her breath is vaporising in the cold.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
dialog: We shall have a cheerful house
dialog: this winter...
dialog: 
text: As Jane follows Mrs Fairfax up the stairs, light is thrown
text: on portraits of dour, craggy, long dead ancestors.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
dialog: With Miss Varens here - and with
dialog: you - we'll have quite a merry
dialog: time of it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - A LONG GALLERY.
dialog: 
text: Dark heavy drapes, another striking portrait. A dark,

text: full breast exposed. Jane glances away, taken aback by the
text: woman's bold expression and her nakedness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
dialog: I'm sure that last winter - and
dialog: what a severe one - if it didn't
dialog: rain it snowed and if it didn't
dialog: snow it blew a gale - last winter
dialog: I declare that not a soul came to
dialog: the house from November to

dialog: 
text: Jane looks in: a fire burning, a lamp lit by her bed, a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: OH -
dialog: 
text: She is utterly speechless. Her eight years of physical

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
dialog: Good night, my dear. I hope

scene_heading: INT. NEXT MORNING. THORNFIELD - JANE'S BEDROOM.

dialog: 
text: Jane enters a magnificent room. Mrs Fairfax is dusting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What a beautiful house.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
dialog: Mr Rochester's visits here are
dialog: always unexpected. He doesn't

dialog: Now, come and meet Miss Varens.
dialog: Did I mention she was French?

scene_heading: INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE LIBRARY.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ADELE
speaker_heading: (IN FRENCH)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
text: Her mother has passed away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ADELE
speaker_heading: (IN FRENCH)
dialog: Maman used to teach me to dance

dialog: came to see her I used to dance
dialog: for them or sit on their knees
dialog: and sing. May I sing for you now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
speaker_heading: (IN FRENCH)
dialog: Well - that would be lovely.
dialog: (To Mrs Fairfax)
dialog: Adele is going to show us her
dialog: accomplishments.
dialog: 
text: Adele adopts a lovelorn pose. She sings an operetta song; a
text: forsaken lady plotting vengeance on her lover. Her high
text: voice warbles with pretended emotion. The effect is rather
text: weird. Jane and Mrs Fairfax watch, open-mouthed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
dialog: How very French...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - MRS FAIRFAX'S PARLOUR.
dialog: 
text: Adele's song continues as a voiceover. Mrs Fairfax is
text: finishing a shawl. Jane is showing Adele pictures of little

dialog: 
text: The song ends. Jane gives Adele a sketch of herself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Me! It is me!

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE LONG GALLERY
dialog: 
text: Jane holds a candle, the shawl around her; the moaning
text: sound of a gale outside. She holds her candle up to the
text: portrait of the voluptuous woman.
dialog: 
text: She stares at it curious, both as a girl and as an artist.
text: She brings the candle close, to see how the brushwork has
text: achieved the effect of flesh. She hears a low, knowing
text: laugh in the darkness behind her. She is startled.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Who's there?
dialog: 
text: Her own huge shadow is the only thing that moves. She hears
text: the laugh again. She follows it through the darkness, alert
text: with fear. A door clicks shut at the end of the corridor.
dialog: 
text: To her relief Jane sees Mrs Fairfax approach with a lamp.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Who sleeps up here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
dialog: No one. This part of the house is

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I heard someone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
dialog: You can't have done.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
text: A laugh. Someone laughed.
dialog: 
text: Mrs Fairfax flounders for a second.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
dialog: Oh - that must be Grace Poole.
dialog: She likes to sit up here with her
text: sewing. Rather an eccentric soul.
dialog: (She shouts sharply)
dialog: Grace? Grace!
dialog: 
text: A door opens. Jane sees a broad-faced woman with slow,
text: intelligent eyes. She looks as if she has just woken up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
text: Miss Eyre has heard a laugh.
dialog: 
text: Grace looks at Jane with sly curiosity. She leaves the
text: sewing room and opens a door through which a flight of

scene_heading: EXT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE LEADS.
dialog: 
text: Jane is on the turreted roof, looking up at the cawing

speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
dialog: I thought I might find you up here.

dialog: Please don't think I'm so

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
dialog: But it's a quiet life, isn't it?
dialog: This isolated house; a still doom
dialog: for a young woman...
dialog: 
text: Jane looks out at the view once more.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I wish a woman could have action
text: in her life, like a man. It
dialog: agitates me to pain that the sky-
dialog: line over there is ever our
dialog: limit. I long sometimes for a
dialog: power of vision that would
dialog: overpass it. If I could behold
dialog: all I imagine... I've never seen
dialog: a city, never spoken with men.
dialog: I've never even seen a town of
dialog: any size. And I fear my whole
dialog: life will pass, without ever
dialog: having...
dialog: 
text: Mrs Fairfax's troubled look makes Jane fall silent. Mrs

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DAY. A FROZEN MEADOW.
dialog: 
text: Jane is walking with purpose, carrying a bundle of letters.
text: The exercise is lifting her spirits. The sun is sinking,
text: turning the frost gold.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DAY. A FROZEN WOOD.
dialog: 
text: A brook runs close to the path; half frozen. Its slow
text: trickle is the only sound to be heard. Jane moves slowly,
text: acutely aware of everything around her.
dialog: 
text: Further into the wood, the brook has frozen right across
text: the path. Jane slips on it as she passes. The noise of her
text: feet echoes. She steadies herself.
dialog: 
text: She gazes at a huddle of snowdrops, their heads bowed. A
text: crystal drop of water runs to the end of a snowdrop and
text: begins to freeze as she watches. It is held suspended as if
text: the whole winter is contained in it.
dialog: 
text: The moon is mounting the sky. Jane hears a sound like the
text: beating of wings. The blood is rushing through her ears.
dialog: 
text: Her trance is broken by the figure of a great dog - which
text: glides past her so close it almost knocks her off her feet.
text: The beating is loud; not wings she realises, but the rush
text: of an approaching horse. It is almost on top of her before
text: she can move. Her shocked, pale face, her black garments
text: startle both horse and rider.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: What the deuce -
dialog: 
text: The rider gets the horse under control and continues, only
text: to have his horse slip on the ice. Both man and horse fall
text: with a crash. The dog begins to bark, until the hills echo
text: with the sound. The horse is on one side; the man is lying,
text: trapped beneath it on the ice; Edward Fairfax Rochester.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Hellfire.
dialog: 
text: Jane is confounded.

speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Pilot, get down! GET DOWN I SAY!

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Can I do anything, sir?

dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 38.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Get back.
dialog: 
text: Jane doesn't move. Rochester turns to his horse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Mesrour. Mesrour.
dialog: 
text: With much stamping and clattering, the horse clambers to
text: its feet. Rochester seems relieved.
dialog: 
text: He tries to stand himself. His ankle will bear no weight.
text: He lets out an involuntary cry. It echoes:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Damnation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Are you injured, sir?
dialog: 
text: Rochester looks at her once more. He manages to get himself
text: off the ice. He sits on a nearby stile. Jane approaches
text: him. She now has the moon on her face. She begins to look
text: less like a phantom and more like a girl.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: If you are hurt and want help I
dialog: can fetch someone from the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Then try to get hold of his
text: bridle and lead him to me.
dialog: 
text: Jane doesn't like his imperious tone. She looks at the
text: horse; huge, trampling, nervous. Rochester is amused.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: If you would be so kind...
dialog: 
text: Jane obeys. She endeavours to catch the bridle but the
text: horse rears away. Jane falls on the ice. Rochester bursts
text: out laughing. Jane picks herself up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Perhaps it would be easier to
dialog: bring me to the horse. Come here.
dialog: 
text: Jane resists.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Forgive me. I must beg of you to
dialog: come here.
dialog: 
text: Jane approaches. Rochester instantly leans all his weight
text: on her. She almost crumples under it; the first time she
text: has ever touched and been touched by a man. She holds him
text: up. And walks him closer to his horse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Mesrour.

dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (He bows.)
dialog: Now, make haste with your letter.
dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 40.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Rochester's spurred heel makes the horse start and rear.
text: Jane steps back. The horse bounds away, the dog rushing in

scene_heading: I/E. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE FRONT ENTRANCE/HALL.
dialog:

speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
dialog: Mr Rochester is here.

speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
dialog: Go and change your frock; he wishes

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: But all my dresses are the same.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
speaker_heading: (DESPERATELY)
dialog: You must have one that is better?
dialog: He's in a terrible humour; the

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE LIBRARY.
dialog: 
text: Jane enters. Rochester is in front of a superb fire - one

text: feet - and so is Adele, gazing adoringly at him.
dialog: 
text: Rochester is looking through Jane's portfolio of sketches

dialog: I was brought up by my Aunt, Mrs
text: Reed of Gateshead, in a house far
text: finer than this. At ten years old
dialog: I went to Lowood school where I
dialog: received as good an education as

dialog: And why are you not with Mrs Reed

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: She cast me off, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Because I was burdensome and she
dialog: disliked me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Lowood; that's a charity school,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER

dialog: No tale of woe...

speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
dialog: I daily thank providence for
dialog: sending us Miss Eyre. She's a
dialog: kind and patient teacher and an
dialog: invaluable / companion -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Don't trouble yourself to give
dialog: her a character. I'll judge for
dialog: myself. She began by felling my

speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yes sir.
dialog: 
text: A swollen sea. A cormorant, a golden bracelet held in its

text: deathly, her drowned figure underneath.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Where did you get your copies?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
text: Out of my head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: That head I now see on your

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yes sir.
dialog: 
text: He turns the next. The top of a hill. An expanse of
text: twilight sky. Rising up, a girl's shape, her forehead
text: crowned with a star, red hair flowing; Helen Burns.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Who's this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
text: The evening star.

scene_heading: INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE HALL/LANDING.
dialog: 
text: Jane is crossing the landing holding Adele's hand.
text: Downstairs, the library doors swing wide open. The sound of
text: male laughter can be heard; gentlemen walk out into the
text: hall. Rochester follows, walking with a stick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Monsieur!
dialog: 
text: All eyes turn upon the landing. Jane tries to find a shadow
text: to back into but there are none. Adele curtsies.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Ah, there she is...
dialog: 
text: It is unclear whether he is referring to Adele or Jane. He

scene_heading: INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE DRAWING ROOM.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm not fond of children.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Oh Ciel! Que c'est beau!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Nor do I particularly enjoy
dialog: simple-minded old ladies. But you
dialog: might suit me - if you would.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: How, sir?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: By distracting me from the mire
dialog: of my thoughts.
dialog: 
text: Adele, irrepressible, runs across the room embracing the
text: dress. She drops on one knee at Rochester's feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Monsieur, je vous remercie mille
dialog: fois de votre bonte...
dialog: 
text: She looks up, seeking his approval.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ADELE (CONT'D)
dialog: That is how Maman used to say, is
dialog: it not?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Precisely.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
dialog: Let's try it on, shall we?
dialog: 
text: Adele skips off with Mrs Fairfax.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
speaker_heading: (TO HIMSELF)
dialog: And that is how she charmed my
dialog: English gold out of my English

dialog: 
text: Rochester notices how keenly Jane is observing him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Your gaze is very direct, Miss
dialog: Eyre? D'you think me handsome?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: No sir.
dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 46.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Rochester laughs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: I was too plain; I beg your pardon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: What fault do you find with me? I
dialog: have all my limbs and all my
speaker_heading: FEATURES -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Mr Rochester, it was a blunder.
dialog: I ought to have replied that
dialog: beauty is of little consequence -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Now you stick a knife under my
speaker_heading: EAR -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You have other qualities, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Just so; other qualities... When
dialog: I was your age I was a felling
dialog: enough fellow. I might have been
dialog: insulted then. You're blushing
dialog: Miss Eyre.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Not at all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: And though you're not pretty any
dialog: more than I am handsome, I must
dialog: say it becomes you.
speaker_heading: (HE LAUGHS)
dialog: And now I see you're fascinated
text: by the flowers on the rug.
dialog: 
text: Jane senses his mockery.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: I'd like to draw you out. Come,
dialog: speak to me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What about, sir?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: The choice of subject is entirely
dialog: yours.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: How can I introduce a subject
dialog: when I don't know what'll
dialog: interest you?
dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 47.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: The fact is, Miss Eyre, I don't
dialog: wish to treat you like an
dialog: inferior.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yet you'd command me to speak?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Well I probably have a right to
dialog: be a little abrupt and exacting
dialog: on the grounds of my superiority
dialog: in age. There must be twenty
dialog: years between us and a century's
dialog: advance in experience.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I don't think you have a right to
dialog: command me just because you're
dialog: older. Your claim to superiority
dialog: depends on the use you've made of
dialog: your time and experience.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: I've made indifferent use of
dialog: both. And this is why I sit,
dialog: galled by my own thoughts - and
dialog: order you to divert me. Are you
dialog: very hurt by my tone of command?
dialog: 
text: Jane smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: There are few masters who'd
dialog: trouble to enquire whether their
dialog: paid subordinates were hurt by
dialog: their commands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Oh yes... paid subordinate; I'd
dialog: forgotten the salary. Well on
dialog: that mercenary ground, will you
dialog: consent to speak with me as my
dialog: equal - without thinking that the
dialog: request arises from insolence?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I'd never mistake informality for
dialog: insolence, sir. One, I rather
dialog: like. The other, nothing free
dialog: born should ever submit to - even
dialog: for a salary.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Humbug. Most free-born things
dialog: would submit to anything for a
dialog: salary. But I mentally shake
dialog: hands with you for your answer.

speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Not three in three thousand
dialog: schoolgirl governesses would have
dialog: answered me as you've just done.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You've clearly not spent much
text: time in the company of schoolgirl
dialog: governesses. I'm the same plain
dialog: kind of bird as all the rest,
dialog: with my couple of accomplishments
dialog: and my common tale of woe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: I envy you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: How?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Your openness, your clear
dialog: conscience, your unpolluted mind.
dialog: If I were eighteen I think we truly
dialog: would be equals. Nature meant me to
dialog: be a good man, one of the better
dialog: kind and as you see, I am not so.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Are you a villain then, sir?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: I'm a trite commonplace sinner,
text: hackneyed in all the dissipations
dialog: that the rich and worthless try
dialog: to put on life.
speaker_heading: (HE SIGHS)
dialog: When I was your age, fate dealt me
dialog: a blow. I was - cursed with a
dialog: burden to carry through life. I
dialog: lacked the wisdom to remain cool
dialog: and I turned desperate. Dread
dialog: remorse, Miss Eyre. It is the
dialog: poison of life.
dialog: 
text: Rochester takes in her open, compassionate face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: And since happiness is denied me,
dialog: I've a right to get pleasure in
dialog: its stead. And I will get it,
dialog: cost what it may.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Then you'll degenerate still more.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Are you preaching to me?
dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 49.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I'm reminding you of your own
dialog: words; remorse is the poison of
dialog: life.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: But, Miss Eyre, if the pleasure I
dialog: was seeking was sweet and fresh;
dialog: if it was an inspiration; if it
text: wore the robes of an angel of
dialog: light... what then?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I don't know. To speak truth, I
dialog: don't understand you at all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: My heart has long been a charnel
dialog: house. Perhaps it'll transform
text: into a shrine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Sir, I find the conversation has
dialog: got out of my depth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: You're afraid of me because I
dialog: talk like a sphynx.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I'm not afraid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Yes you are.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I've simply no wish to talk
dialog: nonsense.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: If you did it would be in such a
dialog: grave, quiet manner that I would
dialog: mistake it for sense. Do you
dialog: never laugh, Miss Eyre?
dialog: 
text: This question cuts Jane to the quick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Only rarely, perhaps. But you're
dialog: not naturally austere, any more
dialog: than I'm naturally vicious. I can
dialog: see in you the glance of a curious
text: sort of bird through the close set
text: bars of a cage: a vivid, restless,
dialog: resolute captive. Were it but free,
text: it would soar. Cloud high.
dialog: 
text: Jane opens her mouth to speak - but she cannot.

scene_heading: EXT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE GROUNDS. SPRING.
dialog: 
text: Jane is playing battledore and shuttlecock with Adele. Her

text: almost rosy. It is spring.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
text: Just as it turns to come down -
dialog: that's when you hit it.
dialog: 
text: Adele serves. The game continues apace. Rochester wanders
text: out of the open double doors of the library. He watches.
dialog: 
text: Something lands at his feet. A rook's feather. He looks up
text: at the battlements. A shape disappears, too fast to see.
text: Rochester's features cloud over with an expression of shame
text: and detestation. He stands in a terrible inner conflict.
dialog: 
text: Jane notices him - she misses her shot.

dialog: 
text: Rochester is leaning over the balustrade, his head bowed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Is our game disturbing you, sir?
dialog: 
text: He looks up. A hard and cynical expression has mastered his
text: countenance, something resolute. Jane is taken aback.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: On the contrary. I like your game.
dialog: I like this cold, hard day. I like
dialog: Thornfield.
dialog: 
text: Rochester picks up the black feather. He starts to walk
text: across the grounds at a fast pace. Jane follows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: I've been arranging a point with
dialog: my destiny, Miss Eyre. My destiny
dialog: stood up there by that chimney,
dialog: like one of the hags who appeared
dialog: to Macbeth. 'You like Thornfield?'
dialog: She said. 'Like it if you dare'.
dialog: Well, I dare. It's felt like a

dialog: 
text: Rochester snaps at her with shocking ferocity.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Get back! Keep at a distance
dialog: child, or go in!
dialog: 
text: Adele's face crumples into tears. Rochester sees Jane's
text: shock at his outburst. He walks away.
dialog: 
text: Jane isn't sure whether she has been dismissed or not.
text: Adele has run back to Pilot. Jane watches her. She suddenly
text: finds Rochester is back at her side. He walks her along.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: She's the daughter of an opera
text: dancer, Celine Varens. Celine was a
dialog: beauty and she professed to love
dialog: me. Her ardour was so great that,
dialog: ugly as I am, I believed myself her
dialog: idol. So I installed in her in a
dialog: hotel, gave her servants, gowns
dialog: cashmeres, diamonds - in short, I
dialog: was an idiot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: To fall in love, sir?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: You've never felt love, have you
dialog: Miss Eyre? Your soul still sleeps.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Does it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: You're still floating gently in
text: the stream of life, unaware of
text: the rocks ahead waiting to dash
dialog: you to pieces.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Were you dashed to pieces, Mr
dialog: Rochester?

speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: It ended when I visited her
dialog: unexpectedly one night and caught
text: her with her handsome, charmless
dialog: lover. I overheard her waxing
dialog: lyrical on all my defects - she was
text: mercenary, heartless, senseless.
text: The whole intoxication fell away
dialog: like a dream. I left her money to
dialog: support the little French floweret
dialog: over there, whom she swore blind
dialog: was mine. I see no proof of my grim
dialog: paternity in her features; I think

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: But you took her on?
dialog: 
text: Adele is curled up, seeking comfort from the dog.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Some years later, I heard that

dialog: disappeared to Italy and left it
dialog: destitute. So I lifted it from the
dialog: mud and slime of Paris and brought
dialog: it here, to grow up clean in the
dialog: wholesome soil of an English
dialog: country garden. My one good work in
text: a sea of countless sins.
dialog: 
text: Jane is looking at Adele full of compassion.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: You listen, Miss Eyre, as if it was
dialog: the most usual thing in the world

text: Adele looks up. Rochester speaks graciously.

dialog: 
text: She stares into the mirror, searching the pale face of her

dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 53.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She scans them, her eyes full of terror. Jane knows beyond

text: It seems to be right next to her. She tries to scream -
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - SECOND FLOOR.
dialog: 
text: Jane wakes. Her curtains are open; moonlight spilling in.
text: She hears it again; the laugh from her dream, right outside

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Who's there?
dialog: 
text: Footsteps run away. Jane springs out of bed and pulls the
text: door open. A door shuts at the end of the corridor.
dialog: 
text: There is a single candle burning in its holder on the rush
text: matting, flickering in the draft. Jane picks it up. She
text: notices something else - a curling wreath of grey smoke.
text: She follows its trail through the pitch darkness. It is
text: coming thickly from a half-open door at the front of the
dialog: house - Rochester's.
dialog: 
text: Jane rushes in. Rochester's bed is on fire; the hangings,
text: the curtains, all are alight. The flames are leaping.
text: Rochester is asleep. She shakes him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Wake up! Wake up! Sir!
dialog: 
text: Rochester only stirs. The smoke has stupefied him. Jane
text: pulls the burning sheets off - then stops; he is naked. She
text: takes his basin and douses the bed - soaking him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Who's there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: It is I, Jane Eyre, sir.
dialog: 
text: Jane takes the ewer and throws water on the curtains. She

text: the windows and opens them. Smoke billows out. She stands
text: in the moonlight, coughing.
dialog: 
text: Rochester is sitting up, staring at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: What in the name of all the elves in

text: Rochester is springing out of bed. Jane turns away,
text: mortified - having caught sight of his silhouetted shape.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
text: I heard a laugh outside my door
dialog: loud enough to wake me. I opened
text: it. Someone was running towards
text: the third floor.
dialog: 
text: Rochester is putting on a dressing gown, lighting the lamp.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
text: And a candle was left burning in
dialog: the middle of the floor. Shall I

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: What the deuce can she do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Then I'll wake John and Martha.

text: She looks up. Rochester is watching her. His expression is

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Just so. Grace Poole - you have

speaker_heading: JANE
speaker_heading: BUT -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER

speaker_heading: ROCHESTER

speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: I have a pleasure in owing you my

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: There is no debt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: I knew you would do me good in some
dialog: way. I saw it in your eyes when I
dialog: first beheld you. Their expression
dialog: did not - did not strike delight
dialog: into my very inmost being so, for
dialog: nothing. People talk of natural
dialog: sympathies... You.
dialog: 
text: Rochester is drawing her slowly closer. Jane, disconcerted,
text: is trying to resist.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Good night then, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: So you will leave me?

scene_heading: INT. DAWN. THORNFIELD. JANE'S ROOM.
dialog: 
text: Jane is keeling on the windowsill, looking out at the

text: a rare feeling that prompts her mood, as new and unfolding
dialog: as the day itself - happiness.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - ROCHESTER'S ROOM.
dialog: 
text: Jane looks in to see Leah and Martha cleaning the soot from

dialog: Managed to put it out with the
text: water from his stand.
dialog: Did you not hear anything, miss?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
text: I did. I heard a strange laugh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: It's hardly likely the master
dialog: would laugh when he was in such
dialog: danger. Perhaps you were dreaming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I was not.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Then you didn't think of opening

dialog: Has Mr Rochester not sent for us
dialog: today?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
dialog: Why, he's gone away. Were you not
dialog: aware? He left after breakfast.
dialog: 
text: Jane takes this piece of news like an invisible shock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
dialog: He's gone to The Leas, Mr
dialog: Eshton's place, about ten miles
dialog: from here. I believe Blanche
dialog: Ingram is there. She's a great
dialog: favourite of his.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
dialog: I saw her two years ago when Mr
dialog: Rochester had a party here. Oh,
dialog: she was a beauty; I daresay the
dialog: most elegant girl I've ever seen.
text: So tall, with raven hair cascading
dialog: down her back; I don't know how
text: she'd had it done. She sang a duet
dialog: with Mr Rochester. They made a

dialog: Qu'avez vous mademoiselle?

scene_heading: INT. DAY. MORTON - THE SCHOOL ROOM.
dialog: 
text: Jane finds herself in front of her class. They are looking

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Thank you, girls. You may go.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. EVENING. MORTON - THE SCHOOL ROOM.
dialog: 
text: Jane is tidying up at the end of the day. The classroom is

text: up. St John Rivers is watching her from the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ST JOHN
dialog: Do you find the work too hard?
dialog: 
text: Jane immediately puts on a sprightly face and continues
dialog: clearing up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Not at all. I'm getting on very
dialog: well.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ST JOHN
dialog: Do you feel the solitude an
dialog: oppression?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I hardly have time to notice it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ST JOHN
dialog: Then perhaps your accommodations
dialog: have disappointed you. They are
dialog: in truth scanty enough -

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: A few months ago I had nothing. I
dialog: was wretched. Now I have a home
dialog: and work; free and honest. I
dialog: wonder at the goodness of God and
dialog: at the generosity of my friends.
dialog: 
text: St John approaches her; speaks intimately.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ST JOHN
dialog: What you had left before I met
dialog: you, I don't know. But I counsel
dialog: you to resist firmly every
dialog: temptation to look back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: It's what I mean to do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ST JOHN
dialog: We can overcome every kind of human
dialog: weakness. A year ago I was myself
dialog: intensely miserable. I considered
dialog: my life was so wretched that it
dialog: must be changed - or I would die.
text: After a season of darkness and
text: struggling, light broke. I heard my
dialog: call from God. Put your trust in
dialog: him, Jane. Let him lead you to your
dialog: future.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 
text: St John is turning to go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Why were you intensely miserable?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ST JOHN
dialog: A year ago, I was weak enough to
dialog: fall in love.
dialog: 
text: Jane moves involuntarily towards him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ST JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't pity me; I have no compassion
dialog: whatsoever for you. I regarded this
dialog: love as a fever of the flesh; not a
dialog: thing that would ever touch my
dialog: soul. I scorned the weakness,
dialog: fought hard against it - and won.
dialog: 
text: Jane is incredulous. St John is at her desk. It is covered
text: in her drawings. He glances through them.
dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 60.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ST JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: I could have listened to
text: temptation, sunk down in the silken
text: snare and known a feverish and
dialog: delusive bliss. I could have
dialog: squandered my future upon it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You could have been happy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ST JOHN
dialog: A slave in a fool's paradise? I'd
dialog: rather my life had purpose -
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ST JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Is this yours?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
text: His eyes, in an instant, seem to take in everything about

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: What's the matter?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ST JOHN
dialog: Nothing in the world.
dialog: 
text: He folds the paper and takes it.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE SECOND FLOOR.
dialog: 
text: Jane wears a housekeeper's apron over her dress. She enters
text: Rochester's room with an armful of bed linen. It has been
text: returned to its former glory. Adele is jumping up and down
text: on the bed. Sophie is trying to coax her off it. Jane gives
dialog: Sophie the sheets.
dialog: 
text: Adele leaves the room with Jane and skids all the way down
text: the newly polished gallery in her stockinged feet. Jane
text: can't help smiling.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE KITCHENS.
dialog: 
text: Jane sets down several bottles of wine on the kitchen table
text: in order to dust them. The kitchen is a hive of activity -
text: except for one lone figure sitting quietly in a chair by
text: the fire, smoking a pipe; Grace Poole. Leah and one of the
text: hired under cooks are talking abut her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNDER COOK
dialog: She gets good wages, I'd guess?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Wish I had as good; not one fifth
dialog: what Mrs Poole receives.
dialog: 
text: Jane affects not to listen, but is keenly interested.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEAH (CONT'D)
dialog: And she's laying it all by. I
dialog: shouldn't wonder if she's saved
dialog: enough to keep her independent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNDER COOK
dialog: She's a good hand, I daresay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Not everyone could do it, that's
dialog: for sure, not even for the money.

speaker_heading: UNDER COOK
dialog: No wonder the master relies on
speaker_heading: HER -
dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 62.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Leah notices Jane's curious glance. She nudges the under
text: cook. Jane, picks up the bottles and carries them away. As
text: she passes she hears:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNDER COOK (CONT'D)
dialog: Doesn't she know?
dialog: 
text: At that moment, Adele rushes in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: They're here! They're here!
dialog: 
text: Mrs Fairfax tries to get her apron off. She becomes
text: flustered. Jane helps her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 
text: Mrs Fairfax and Adele go. Jane looks out of the window.
dialog: 
text: Her attention is focussed on two equestrians who lead the
text: arriving party; Rochester and Blanche, the dark beauty at
text: his side. She is laughing at something. The sun shines
text: behind her. Jane is dazzled. She turns away.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE SECOND FLOOR.
dialog: 
text: Jane comes up the back stairs and on to the gallery, just
text: as the ladies start to issue from their rooms. She stands
text: back in a dark corner.
dialog: 
text: There is an approach of chatter; a subdued vivacity. A
text: flurry of multicoloured silks, lace and velvets go by. They
text: descend the staircase as noiselessly as a bright mist.
dialog: 
text: Jane steps out. She walks right into the path of Blanche
text: Ingram, who is dressed in white. They both startle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Excuse me, miss.
dialog: 
text: Blanche gives her a look of ice. Rochester is at the top of
dialog: the stairs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Good evening.
dialog: 
text: They both turn. Rochester has seen Blanche, not Jane. He
text: offers her his arm, his gaze full of admiration. Jane sinks
text: back into the shadows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: May I?
dialog: 
text: Blanche lays her gloved hand on Rochester's arm, barely
text: touching him. They glide away.
dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 63.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE HALL.
dialog: 
text: Adele and Jane sit on the stairs, listening to Blanche and
text: Rochester sing. Their voices thrill. Jane is trying not to
text: feel. But when Rochester hits an exceptionally beautiful
text: note, she involuntarily closes her eyes.
dialog: 
text: Adele leans into Jane. She is crying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What is it, darling?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: She sing like Maman.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
dialog: Tonight. He wants you both in the

dialog: 
text: Adele leaps up, delighted. Jane is crestfallen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Not me, surely.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
dialog: It's his particular wish.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: He was being polite.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
dialog: I'm instructed to tell you that
dialog: if you resist, he'll come up and

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: May I present Miss Adele Varens?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Bon jour, mesdames, monsieurs.
dialog: 
text: Jane finds it hard to get a proper impression of the
text: guests, as she cannot raise her eyes to look at them.
dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 64.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Adele makes a dainty curtsey - pink frock, hair in
text: ringlets, little lace gloves. In the midst of the crowd is
dialog: Blanche.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLANCHE
dialog: Why, what a little puppet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LADY INGRAM
dialog: (mutton dressed as lamb)
dialog: Is this your ward, Mr Rochester?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUISA ESHTON
dialog: (English rose; nineteen)
dialog: What a love of a child.
dialog: 
text: Adele blissfully disappears into a moving sea of dresses.
text: Only one guest is still looking in Jane's direction;
text: Blanche. Her lip curls in distaste.
dialog: 
text: Jane backs into a nearby window seat; always her place of
text: refuge. She closes her eyes. A great Atlantic wave hits the
text: sash window behind her, drenching it with foam and brine.
dialog: 
text: When she opens her eyes, Rochester is in her line of
text: vision, standing out in a crowd of unmanly men. He senses
text: her gaze; glances at her. Jane looks down, pulling her work
text: on to her lap; a beaded purse. She does not lift her eyes
text: from the beads, fully feeling the humiliation of her class -
text: and of her love. Blanche sidles up to Rochester.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLANCHE
dialog: I thought you weren't fond of
dialog: children?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: You're right; I'm not.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLANCHE
dialog: Then what induced you to take
dialog: charge of that little doll?
dialog: 
text: Rochester turns away from Jane.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
text: She was left on my hands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLANCHE
dialog: Why don't you send her to school?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
text: She has a governess.
dialog:

text: eyes down, once more.
dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 65.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLANCHE
dialog: You should hear mamma on the
dialog: chapter of governesses. I had
dialog: half a dozen in my day - all
dialog: detestable, ridiculous incubi -
dialog: were they not, mamma?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LADY INGRAM
dialog: Did you speak, my lily flower?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLANCHE
dialog: I said governesses.
dialog: 
text: The reaction is instant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LADY INGRAM
dialog: Oh, don't mention them; the very
dialog: word makes me nervous! I've
dialog: suffered a martyrdom from their
dialog: incompetence and caprice. I thank
dialog: heaven we're now done with them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLANCHE
dialog: I have just one word to say of
dialog: the whole tribe; nuisance.
dialog: 
text: Jane's fingers sew. Only the briefest flash of her eyes
text: towards the company shows her mortification. Blanche has
text: started playing a brilliant prelude on the piano.

speaker_heading: BLANCHE (CONT'D)
dialog: We shall have music - and new

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Donna Bianca, I give you beauty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLANCHE
dialog: Beauty? Why there's nothing new

speaker_heading: LADY INGRAM
dialog: My son, of course.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LORD INGRAM
dialog: Hear hear.
dialog:

dialog: Oh, Tedo's quite typical of the

dialog: fashion that they've forgotten
dialog: how to be men at all.
dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 66.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LORD INGRAM
dialog: I say -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLANCHE
text: A woman who neglects herself is a
text: blot on humanity. But a man
dialog: should pay no heed to his looks.
dialog: (Glancing at Rochester)
dialog: A man should possess only
dialog: strength and valour. He could be
text: a gentleman or a highwayman. His
text: beauty lies in his power.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: So a Levantine pirate would do
dialog: for you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLANCHE
speaker_heading: (QUIETLY)
dialog: As long as he resembled you.
dialog: 
text: Rochester laughs loudly. Jane is heading for the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLANCHE (CONT'D)
dialog: I am serious. To my mind, a man
dialog: is nothing without a spice of the
dialog: devil in him.
dialog: 
text: Jane closes the door on Blanche. She breathes in fresh air,
text: nauseous. Blanche's splendid prelude drifts out.
dialog: 
text: Rochester comes into the hall from the other door. Jane
text: instantly bends down and pretends to be tying her shoe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Why did you leave the room?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I am tired, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Why didn't you come and speak to
dialog: me? I haven't seen you for weeks.
dialog: It would have been normal and
dialog: polite to wish me good evening.

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You seemed engaged, sir.

speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: You're depressed; your eyes are

dialog: meaning of this?
dialog: 
text: Jane catches sight of Mrs Fairfax, who is watching them

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
text: A gentleman has arrived to see
dialog: you, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Who?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
dialog: He says he's travelled a long
dialog: way, from Spanish Town, Jamaica -
dialog: 
text: Rochester seems winded.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
dialog: And indeed I think he must have
dialog: come from some hot country because

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Spanish Town...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
dialog: Mr Richard Mason. He says you're
dialog: old friends. I've put him in the

dialog: 
text: Rochester cannot speak.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
dialog: Have I done wrong?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh Jane - Jane. This is a blow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Can I help you sir?
dialog: 
text: In the drawing room, Blanche's prelude finishes to

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Jane, if all those people came and
dialog: spat at me, what would you do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Turn them out of the room sir, if
dialog: I could.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: And if they cast you out for
dialog: adhering to me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I should care nothing about it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: You'd dare censure for my sake?
dialog:

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: For the sake of any friend who

dialog: 
text: Jane looks down at the bundle. In it, is a newborn boy.
text: Jane looks up to ask Helen for help. But Helen has gone.
dialog: 
text: Jane alone with her burden, teeters on the stool. The baby

text: Overhead, the sounds of a struggle begin - a deadly one.
text: Jane hears footsteps rush past her door. She starts to pull
text: on her dress. She hears a man's voice from above:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MASON (O.S.)
dialog: Help! Rochester, for God's sake
dialog: come!
dialog: 
text: A great stamp on the floor above; something falls with a
text: thud; silence. Jane grabs her candle and leaves her room.
dialog: 
text: The guests likewise are all issuing from their rooms; some
text: with candles, some stumbling into the dark. The gallery is

speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Be steady. I need you.
dialog: 
text: He unlocks it. A room hung with tapestries; a four poster

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait.
dialog:

speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Think of her as dead, dead and

dialog: 
text: Mason is silenced. Rochester puts the bloody sponge into
text: Jane's hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: I am going for a doctor. I must
dialog: leave you here with him. Sponge
text: the blood away when it returns.
dialog: Give him water if he wants it. Do
dialog: not speak to him for any reason.
dialog: And Richard - on pain of death -
dialog: do not speak to her.
dialog: 
text: Rochester takes the candelabra. He is gone. Mason is

dialog: 
text: She dips the sponge in the bloody water and wipes away the
text: trickling gore.
dialog: 
text: She hears a low moan. She looks over at the door to the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
dialog: No, I've long noticed that you were

text: young and so little acquainted with
dialog: men. I don't want to grieve you
dialog: child, but let me put you on your

dialog: Let's just say they're not

dialog: Well for cool native impudence

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I'm naturally proud. And hard and
dialog: flinty. You ought to know what
dialog: sort of bargain you've made while

dialog: you, Mr Rochester.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Your regard.
dialog: 
text: Jane puts her arm through Rochester's. He smiles.

text: The light is sickly, nightmarish.
dialog: 
text: A great box sits on the table, which Jane is opening.
text: Adele, Sophie and Mrs Fairfax are all looking on. Jane
text: pulls out a pearl coloured wedding gown. She is dismayed at
dialog: its opulence.
dialog: 
text: She holds it up to herself. Adele starts to play with the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Adele?
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Adele, is that you?
dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 87.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A form emerges, a woman, tall and gaunt, with thick, black
text: hair hanging down her back. She is dressed in a nightgown -
text: like a shroud. Over her head, she wears Jane's bridal veil;
text: a phantom bride.
dialog: 
text: Jane is paralysed with terror.
dialog: 
text: The form takes the veil and slowly tears it in half;
text: bruised arms, dirt, predatory nails, neglect. The last
text: thing to be revealed is the woman's face, pale and ghastly.
text: Her eyes are glittering with hatred.
dialog: 
text: The figure takes the candle and bends down to Jane. Her
text: intention looks deadly. Jane's breath catches. She cannot
dialog: breathe.
dialog: 
text: The figure moves closer, then blows out the candle.
dialog: Darkness.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - JANE'S BEDROOM.
dialog: 
text: Jane wakes, lying half out of the bed. The veil is over
text: her. She flings it away from her face. Jane sits, her

text: shocked to find herself still alive.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. EVENING. - THORNFIELD - BY THE GATES
dialog: 
text: Jane is waiting, pale with anxiety. A man on horseback
text: approaches, a great dog at his side; Rochester. He is
text: grinning.
dialog: 
text: He pulls Jane up on the horse in front of him. She curls
text: into his arms, desperate for his comfort and his strength.
text: Rochester senses something is wrong. He slows the horse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: What is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I'm afraid.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - JANE'S BEDROOM.
dialog: 
text: Rochester holds the torn veil in his hands. He is aghast.
text: He cannot think what to say.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Jane, this is the only explanation.
dialog: It must have been half-dream, half-
dialog: reality. A woman did enter your
dialog: room last night and that woman was -
dialog: must have been - Grace Poole -
dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 88.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: It was not Grace Poole.
dialog: 
text: Rochester keeps talking over her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: You know how strange she is. What
dialog: did she do to me? To Mason? In a
dialog: state between sleeping and waking -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I was not asleep.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: You noticed her entrance and her
dialog: actions but you've ascribed to
dialog: her an appearance different from
dialog: her own. That was your nightmare -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I know what I saw.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: I see you'd ask why I keep such a
dialog: woman in my house. When we've been
dialog: married a year and a day, I promise
dialog: I'll tell you. Are you satisfied
dialog: Jane? Do you accept my solution?
dialog: 
text: Jane clearly doesn't. Rochester takes her in his arms.

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE GROUNDS.
dialog: 
text: Rochester, grimly resolute, is striding at a pace Jane can
text: hardly follow. Her satin shoes are muddy. She is becoming
text: breathless. A rook flies over their heads, cawing.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE CHURCH.
dialog: 
text: Rochester is striding purposefully towards a small church
text: of ancient design. Jane stumbles. Rochester is contrite.
dialog: 
text: Jane tries to collect herself. She looks up to the sky. The
text: rook wheels around the spire. She takes Rochester's hand.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DAY. THE CHURCH
dialog: 
text: At the altar, Jane glances at Rochester. He is looking
text: straight ahead at the clergyman, Wood.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOOD
dialog: I require and charge you both, as
dialog: ye will answer at the dreadful
dialog: day of judgement when the secrets
dialog: of all hearts shall be revealed,
dialog: that if either of you know any
dialog: impediment why ye may not be
dialog: lawfully joined together in
dialog: matrimony, ye do now confess it.
dialog: 
text: There is not a sound. Rochester still doesn't look at Jane.
text: The clergyman prepares the rings.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOOD (CONT'D)
dialog: Edward Fairfax Rochester, do you
speaker_heading: TAKE -
dialog: 
text: A commotion at the back of the church. Two men rapidly
text: enter. One of them Briggs, hurries up the aisle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIGGS
dialog: The marriage cannot go on. I
dialog: declare the existence of an
dialog: impediment.
dialog: 
text: Rochester moves, shaken.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Proceed.

speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
speaker_heading: (SHOUTS)
dialog: Where is your proof?
dialog: 
text: Briggs starts to read out a document.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIGGS (O.S.)
dialog: I affirm and can prove that Edward
dialog: Fairfax Rochester was fifteen years
dialog: ago married to my sister, Bertha
dialog: Antoinetta Mason at St James
dialog: church, Spanish Town, Jamaica.
dialog: 
text: Jane looks at Rochester. She forces him to look at her. He
dialog: denies nothing; defies everything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIGGS (CONT'D)
dialog: The record of the marriage will be
dialog: found in the register of that
dialog: church - a copy of it is now in my
dialog: possession. Signed, Richard Mason.
dialog: 
text: Rochester turns to Briggs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: That does not prove that my wife
text: is still living.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIGGS
dialog: She was living two months ago.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: How do you know?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIGGS
dialog: I have a witness to the fact.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Produce him or go to hell.
dialog: 
text: The figure by the door steps out of the shadows. It is
text: Richard Mason. Rochester flies down the aisle, a groan of
text: rage escapes him. He lifts his arm.
dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 91.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Good God -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOOD
dialog: Sir, you are in a sacred place -
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: What have you to say?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: She is at Thornfield Hall. I saw
dialog: her there in April. I'm her
dialog: brother.
dialog: 
text: A grim smile contorts Rochester's lips. He turns towards
text: Jane. She remains where she was abandoned - at the altar -
text: tiny, under he vaulted arch. The bouquet falls from her
text: hand. Rochester walks to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: This girl knew nothing. She
dialog: thought all was fair and legal.
dialog: She never dreamt she was going to
text: be entrapped into a feigned union
text: with a defrauded wretch.
dialog: 
text: A tiny breath is the only noise Jane utters. Rochester
text: pulls her from the altar to his side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Come, Jane, come all of you and
dialog: meet Mrs Poole's charming
dialog: patient. Come and meet my wife.

dialog: 
scene_heading: I/E. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE ENTRANCE / HALL
dialog: 
text: Rochester enters pulling Jane after him, her hand still in

dialog: 
text: Mrs Fairfax, Adele, Sophie, Martha and Leah are waiting.
text: Adele runs forward. Rochester stops her in her tracks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Get back! Do not come near! Go,
dialog: all of you - keep your
dialog: congratulations - they come
dialog: fifteen years too late!
dialog: 
text: Adele has crumpled into frightened tears. Mrs Fairfax has
text: her hand over her mouth, pale with shock. Jane meets her

scene_heading: INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE THIRD FLOOR.
dialog: 
text: The tapestried room. Rochester glances at Mason. He unlocks
text: the inner door with one hand; the other won't let go of
text: Jane. Grace Poole sits by a strongly guarded fire, stirring
text: something in a pot.
dialog: 
text: Rochester leads Jane and the men into the room. There is no
text: window, no furniture except for Grace's chair; only a
text: mattress on the floor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Sir, you can't be bringing folk
dialog: in here. It's madness.
dialog: 
text: Bertha Antoinetta Mason stands, amazed at the sight of her

text: feathers twined in her hair; her only ornament.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: This clothed hyena is my wife.
dialog: 
text: Bertha's pose is dignified, her expression grows
text: triumphant. She approaches Rochester - her eyes locked with
text: Jane's. Jane gazes: fear, disgust, compassion.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: I was duped into marriage with
dialog: this lunatic fifteen years ago.
dialog: 
text: Briggs and Wood are deeply repelled.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOOD
dialog: Let us go. We have seen enough.
dialog: 
text: Bertha puts her arm through Rochester's; lays her head on
text: his shoulder; smiles at Jane, magnanimous in her victory.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: My own demon, Bertha.
dialog: 
text: With shocking speed and strength Bertha lays her nails into
text: Rochester's cheek. He struggles with her.
dialog: 
text: Grace assists Rochester. They do not hit; they subdue.
text: Bertha's attack is effectively contained. They have her on
text: her knees, her arms behind her.
dialog: 
text: Bertha lifts her head and screams. If a scream could
dialog: express the agony of a whole soul then this would. Jane
text: turns on her heels. She stumbles, finds the door, exits.

scene_heading: INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE SECOND FLOOR.

dialog: 
text: Jane looks at Briggs, only dimly comprehending him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIGGS (CONT'D)
dialog: You wrote to your uncle, did you
dialog: not? To inform him you were going

dialog: was staying with him when your

dialog: 
text: Briggs gets only a blank look of puzzlement from Jane.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIGGS (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr John Eyre has been the Madeira

text: Jane starts walking towards the sanctuary of her room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIGGS (CONT'D)
dialog: He would have come himself but
dialog: I'm sad to tell you that his

dialog: implored Mr Mason to prevent this

dialog: to me for assistance. I only hope
dialog: that he survives long enough to

dialog: 
text: Far away, we hear the sound of a flood loosened in the
text: remote mountains. We hear the sound of the torrent
dialog: approach.
dialog: 
text: Jane doesn't move. She has no will to flee. The sound of
text: rushing water pounds in her ears. She lies, waiting to be
text: dashed away. We see the flood approach and hit. A dazzling
text: whiteness of water and foam.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - JANE'S BEDROOM.
dialog: 
text: Jane's room is entirely unchanged except for the fact that

scene_heading: INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - JANE'S BEDROOM.

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Much better, sir. I shall be well

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: All is changed, sir. I must
dialog: change too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Yes. There is no doubt that we
dialog: both must change. I was wrong
dialog: ever to keep you here; this
text: narrow stone vault with its one

dialog: pay Mrs Poole two hundred a year

dialog: prompted to burn people, to stab
dialog: them, to bite the flesh from
dialog: their bones -

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Sir - you speak of her with hate -
dialog: it is cruel. She cannot help

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER

dialog: think that I'd hate you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Then you know nothing about me,
dialog: nothing about the way I love. Your

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You have a wife already.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: I was tricked, duped into wedlock
dialog: with that demon-hate, that harlot,
dialog: that succubus upstairs. My father
dialog: wanted her money and so I was sent
dialog: to Spanish Town and the match was
dialog: made. I hardly spoke with her. I
dialog: was dazzled, ignorant, raw. My

dialog: blockhead that I was.

speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: I lived with her for four years.
dialog: She dragged me through all the
dialog: degrading agonies which attend
dialog: those bound to the intemperate and
dialog: unchaste. Her excesses developed
dialog: germs of madness and the doctors
text: shut her up. One night, unable to
text: bear her screaming hate and knowing
dialog: I could never be rid of her, I put
text: a gun to my head to kill myself.
dialog: 
text: Jane is both appalled and moved.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

dialog: 
text: She looks back. For a moment she seems paralysed. She
text: returns her gaze to the route ahead. Her need to escape is

speaker_heading: ST JOHN
text: An inhospitable question.

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I mean on a night like this -

dialog: half a story and I'm most impatient
text: to find out the end.

speaker_heading: ST JOHN
dialog: Twenty years ago, a poor curate

dialog: daughter and married her. She was
text: disowned by her family and two
dialog: years later the rash pair were both
text: dead. They left a daughter which

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ST JOHN

dialog: character I know nothing but he
dialog: professed to offer honourable
dialog: marriage to this young girl and at
dialog: the very altar she discovered that
text: he had a wife yet alive. His
dialog: subsequent conduct is a matter of
dialog: pure conjecture but when the
dialog: governess was enquired after it was
dialog: discovered that she had fled
dialog: Thornfield Hall and no trace of her

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: ST JOHN
dialog: Who?

speaker_heading: JANE

dialog: Well, since you won't ask the
dialog: governess's name, I must tell
dialog: you. I have it written down here
text: in black and white.

text: He hands her the paper. On it are doodled the heads of some
dialog: of her pupils. She has absently written Jane Eyre in the
dialog: margin several times.

speaker_heading: ST JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: A solicitor named Briggs wrote to

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: ST JOHN
dialog: Merely to tell you that your uncle,

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What?

text: At last, Jane looks questioningly up at him.

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: How much am I worth?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ST JOHN
dialog: Oh a trifle. Twenty thousand
dialog: pounds - but what of that?

dialog: If you'd committed a murder and

dialog: to think. But know this; in you, I

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I used to long for a life of

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I must have my heart and mind
dialog: free, my own self to turn to. I
dialog: couldn't become part of you -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ST JOHN
dialog: A part of me you must become or the
dialog: whole bargain is void. How can I, a
dialog: man not yet thirty take out to
dialog: India a girl of nineteen, unless
dialog: she is my wife? Don't offer God
text: half a sacrifice. He must have all.
dialog: And undoubtedly enough of love

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Enough of love?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ST JOHN
dialog: Yes, quite enough.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: St John, I scorn your idea of
dialog: love. I scorn the counterfeit
dialog: sentiment you offer and I scorn

speaker_heading: ST JOHN
dialog: I've uttered nothing that

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Forgive me but the very name of
dialog: love is an apple of discord

dialog: please abandon your scheme of
dialog: marriage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ST JOHN
dialog: No; and if you reject it, it's
dialog: not me you deny but God.

speaker_heading: ST JOHN
speaker_heading: (FURIOUS)
dialog: I'd kill you? I am killing you?
dialog: Your words are violent, unfeminine

dialog: You'd kill me without drawing any
dialog: blood or receiving on your
dialog: conscience any stain of crime.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ST JOHN
dialog: What nonsense is this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You'd experience no pain - but I
dialog: tell you it would kill me!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ST JOHN
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Because I would inevitably come to
dialog: conceive love for you, because you
dialog: are so talented and good, because
dialog: there is such grandeur in your
dialog: look. You wouldn't want this
dialog: strange and torturing love; if I
dialog: showed it you would find it
dialog: unbecoming. And my lot would be
dialog: wretched.

speaker_heading: ST JOHN
speaker_heading: (UNDERSTANDING HER)

dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ST JOHN
dialog: I wouldn't trample you. You'd
dialog: walk at my side towards God's

dialog: 
text: Jane falls to her knees. St John's face is angelic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: If I were sure; if I were certain -
dialog: 
text: She suddenly hears a voice: Rochester's; clear, urgent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (O.S.)
dialog: Jane! Jane! Jane!
dialog: 
text: She springs away from St John, crying:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh God, what is it?
dialog: 
text: She looks wildly about the room; rushes to the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ST JOHN
dialog: What have you heard? What can you
dialog: see?
dialog: 
text: Jane glances at him, seeing him for what he is; a cold,
text: controlling man. She shouts:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I am coming!
dialog: 
text: She runs out, leaving St John aghast, behind her.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Where are you?
dialog: 
text: The moors send her question back in an echo. We see Jane's
text: face. Her path is clear.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DAY. WHITCROSS MOOR.
dialog: 
text: Jane is waiting for the coach at the crossroads where she
text: arrived, almost a year before. It comes pounding towards
text: her. She hails it. This time, the coachman respectfully
text: descends to take her bag and help her on. She is so
text: confident and so changed that he doesn't recognise her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE GROUNDS.
dialog: 
text: Jane is walking through the orchard. It is wild, neglected.
text: Its untended state worries her. She looks up. Rooks are
text: circling, cawing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Jane finds herself at the side of the house. The ground is
text: pitted with weeds. The windows are dark. She half runs
text: round to the front. What she sees takes her breath away.
dialog: 
text: The great walls and battlements are blackened with fire.
text: Windows gape on a hollow shell. The inside of the house has
text: collapsed. Through the hanging door, only its charred
text: remains can be seen. Weeds grow through utter devastation.
text: Jane gazes in horror and distress.

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: He stayed at Thornfield?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX

dialog: 
text: Rochester, unshaven and unkempt is standing at his
dialog: threshold.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.)
dialog: Shut himself up like a hermit. He
dialog: only went out at night, when he
text: walked like a ghost through the
dialog: grounds.
dialog: 
text: We see what he is looking at: an open carriage piled with
text: luggage, into which Mrs Fairfax is helping Adele. Leah and
text: Sophie are already sitting inside, dressed for a journey.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: He'd have no one near him. Adele
dialog: was sent off to school. He placed
dialog: me here. Only John and Martha
dialog: stayed - and Mrs Poole of course.
dialog: 
text: Adele looks back at Rochester with tears in her eyes. He
text: walks across the dark hall and slams the library doors.

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - THE ORCHARD.
dialog: 
text: Rochester, in his shirt sleeves, is looking at the tree
text: where Jane promised him her hand - now dying, cleft by
text: lightning. The rising moon inhabits the sky.
dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 115.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.)
dialog: It was harvest time when it

dialog: got out.
dialog: 
text: Rochester hears a cry from the top floor. He sets off, a
text: look of finality on his face.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - THE KITCHEN.
dialog: 
text: Grace Poole is asleep, her empty jug of gin beside her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.)
dialog: My theory is that when Mrs Poole
dialog: was asleep, having taken too much
dialog: of the gin and water...
dialog: 
text: Rochester takes Grace's keys.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - THE THIRD FLOOR
dialog: 
text: Rochester opens the door to the inner chamber.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.)
dialog: ... The mad lady must have stolen
text: her keys and let herself out.
dialog: 
text: Bertha Antoinetta Mason, standing in the last patch of
text: daylight thrown down from her skylight, sees that it is
text: Rochester. She calmly walks towards him.
dialog: 
text: Rochester graciously bows, indicating that she may leave.
text: Bertha glides past him. She is free.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - THE GALLERY
dialog: 
text: Bertha walks past an elegant vase. She tips it to the
text: floor. It smashes. Rochester pays it no heed.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - THE LIBRARY.
dialog: 
text: Rochester has stood Bertha at his desk. A case of jewels is
text: open before her. She has put on a tiara, a diamond
text: necklace, bracelets. She is gazing at a ruby brooch. She
text: turns to Rochester. His expression is calm, resigned.
text: Bertha begins to laugh.
dialog: 
text: She takes the candelabra from the table. She admires
text: herself in the mirror; her white shift, the black feathers,
text: the jewels. She holds up the candelabra and sets the huge
text: curtains alight.
dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 116.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Rochester is impassive; he does nothing to stop her. As she
text: passes, Rochester realises he is bleeding. She has run the
text: brooch pin across him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - THE HALL/STAIRS.
dialog: 
text: Bertha knocks a lamp onto the floor. The oil springs into
text: flames, licking the tapestries and the paintings. Rochester
text: sees his ancestors begin to burn.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - THE SECOND FLOOR
dialog: 
text: The conflagration is growing. Rochester sees Bertha leaving
text: Jane's room. As he passes, he sees everything inside it
text: being consumed by fire. He can't bear to look.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - THE LEADS.
dialog: 
text: Bertha is watching the rooks. Rochester goes to the edge of
text: the roof. Bertha looks at him. The invitation is clear.
text: Rochester is ready to die.
dialog: 
text: Bertha sees the rooks wheeling away. She runs at the edge
text: of the roof. Rochester sees her intention too late. He puts
text: out his arm to stop her.
dialog: 
text: For the perfect fraction of a second, Bertha flies.
text: Rochester sees her fall; almost falls himself - saves
dialog: himself.
dialog: 
text: Life reawakens in him. Behind him, he sees Grace Poole,
text: coughing, crawling up through the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Antoinetta?
dialog: 
text: Responsibility floods over him. He goes to her side, lifts
text: Grace, helps her down the stairs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.)
dialog: He didn't leave the house until
dialog: everyone was out. Some say it was a
dialog: just judgement on him for having
dialog: her confined there all those years
dialog: but for my part, I pity him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DAY. MRS FAIRFAX'S COTTAGE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX
text: When he was taken out from under
text: the ruins, a beam had fallen in
dialog: such a way as to protect him,
dialog: partly - but his eye was taken
text: out and his left hand so crushed
text: that he lost it. The other eye
text: inflamed and - he is blind. He's
dialog: blind.
dialog: 
text: Tears fall from Jane's eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
dialog: I know... it's a terrible thing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I had dreaded worse. I'd dreaded
dialog: he was mad.
dialog: 
text: A great sense of urgency is coming over her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Where is he?
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DAY. FERNDEAN - THE GROUNDS.
dialog: 
text: Jane is walking through forest, along a grass grown track.
text: Her pace is fast; her journey almost at an end. She comes
text: to a pair of rusting iron gates hanging open between
text: granite pillars. She walks through them.
dialog: 
text: She finds herself in front of a decrepit Elizabethan manor
text: house; no garden, just a sweeping semi circle of meadow
text: grass, which someone has cut at with a scythe. Jane stops.
dialog: 
text: Standing on the threshold is Edward Fairfax Rochester. He
text: is in his shirtsleeves. He stands strong, stalwart,
text: brooding. His hair is still raven black. He is looking
text: sightlessly around his domain, with the concentration of a
text: hawk. His strength is undiminished.
dialog: 
text: He walks fifteen paces from the house. It brings him into
text: the middle of the semicircle of grass. He is close enough
text: for Jane to see his scarred eyes. She walks towards him,
dialog: silent.
dialog: 
text: A few drops of rain begin to fall. Rochester puts out his
text: right hand to feel them. He raises his face up to the sky
text: as if he is looking for something from there. He is
text: absolutely still; his expression, serene.
dialog: 
text: Jane is very close. She steps on a twig. It breaks with a
text: loud crack, shattering the silence. Rochester is
text: immediately on guard, his expression turning wary.
dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 118.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He suddenly swipes the air with his left arm; the ruin of
text: it passing an inch from her face. Jane steps back.
text: Rochester swipes again. She holds her breath.
dialog: 
text: He seems satisfied at last that nothing is there. He turns
text: and walks fifteen paces back to the house. He disappears
text: into the dark interior.
dialog: 
text: Jane starts to breathe again.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DAY. FERNDEAN - THE SIDE ENTRANCE.
dialog: 
text: Jane lightly taps on the side door. Martha opens it; she is
text: astonished. Jane puts her finger over her lips.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. EVENING. FERNDEAN - THE DRAWING ROOM.
dialog: 
text: Rochester is in an armchair in front of his fire. Pilot is
text: at his feet. Jane carries in a tray with a candelabra and a
text: jug of water.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: I can see the candles, Martha, at
dialog: your side like a luminous glow.
text: And the fire; a red haze.
dialog: 
text: Pilot notices Jane. He leaps up with a whine, wagging his
text: tail, madly. Jane spills half the water. She cannot help
text: finding it funny. Her entrance has been ruined by the dog.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Martha?
dialog: 
text: Jane giggles. Rochester's face falls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Martha, is that you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
text: Martha is in the kitchen, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Who's there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Pilot knows me. Will you have
dialog: some more water? I've spilt half
dialog: the glass.
dialog: 
text: Rochester stands, holding out his hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: If you are real, touch me.
dialog: 
text: Jane touches his fingers; puts her hand in his. Rochester
text: pulls her into his arms.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: You're not lying dead in some
dialog: ditch? Not an outcast among

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I've been with good people; far
dialog: better than you, quite more
text: refined and exalted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
speaker_heading: (DELIGHTED)
dialog: She insults me -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: And I'm an independent woman. My
dialog: uncle in Madeira died and left me
dialog: five thousand pounds -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: This is real. This is practical.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I'm here. I'm home. I am where I
dialog: love best.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Jane curled on Rochester's knee by the fire. He is running

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: You're altogether a human being,
dialog: Jane?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I conscientiously believe so,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: But I see that you're turning
dialog: into a lion. It's time someone
dialog: undertook to rehumanise you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: I'm a sightless block -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I know.
dialog: 
text: She kisses his eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: And the worst of it is, I'm in
dialog: danger of loving you too well for
dialog: this, and making too much of you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCHESTER
dialog: Am I hideous, Jane?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Very. But you always were, you
dialog: know.
dialog: 
text: A smile cracks Rochester's face.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: He holds her.
dialog:
