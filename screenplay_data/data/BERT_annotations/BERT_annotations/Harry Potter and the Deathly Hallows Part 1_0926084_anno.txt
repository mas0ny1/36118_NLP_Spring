scene_heading: MRS. GRANGER
dialog: Don’t you look lovely. All

text: blankly, and then... enfolds her fingers in his.
text: Hermione lowers her arm and, eyes stinging with tears,
text: watches the PHOTOGRAPHS placed about the room begin to

speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Goodbye.

scene_heading: EXT. FRONT YARD (THE BURROW) - DUSK
text: +. RON, staring at the stars. He drops his gaze to the
text: house, studies GINNY and MRS. WEASLEY, aglow in the light
text: of the kitchen, watching them with affection, as if
text: committing them to memory. His gaze shifts to the
text: adjacent SHED. Inside, ARTHUR WEASLEY is bent over his
dialog: workbench.
scene_heading: INT. SHED - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER)

speaker_heading: RON
dialog: C’mon. Mum’s got dinner ready.

text: shift eerily.
scene_heading: EXT. MALFOY MANOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)
text: We PLUMMET THROUGH the shifting trees TO a narrow moonlit
text: lane. A SHADOW ripples across the ground like a kite
text: made of water. A BOOT touches down upon the graveled
text: lane, then another. A cape flutters slowly down upon the
text: shoulders of a wizard, lank hair splayed across his wind-
text: blown collar. His head turns. Moonlight strikes his
text: pale face. SNAPE.
text: Moving. Up a wide drive, to a pair of wrought iron

scene_heading: INT. MALFOY MANOR - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 10
text: Fractured in the prism of a diamond-paned window, Snape
text: approaches. The front door glides open. As he enters,
text: dark eyes in torch-lit portraits track him from above.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 11
text: A door looms at the end of a hallway. Reaching it, Snape
text: hesitates for a heartbeat, then enters.
scene_heading: INT. DRAWING ROOM - SAME TIME - NIGHT 12
text: Two dozen figures sit silently at a large ornate table,
text: illuminated by the flickering light of a fireplace.
text: Snape studies the scene, then his eyes rise. Revolving
text: slowly near the ceiling, as if suspended by an invisible
text: rope, is an unconscious WOMAN (CHARITY BURBAGE).
speaker_heading: VOLDEMORT
dialog: Severus. I was beginning to worry
dialog: you'd lost your way. Come. I’ve
dialog: saved you a seat.
text: VOLDEMORT grins, silhouetted against the fire, and
text: gestures to the seat nearest his own. All eyes follow
text: Snape, all except DRACO MALFOY, who nervously stares at
text: the body above and a haggard LUCIUS MALFOY, who merely
text: stares vaguely at his wand while his wife NARCISSA looks
text: straight ahead.
speaker_heading: VOLDEMORT
dialog: You know our hosts, of course,
dialog: Severus. Narcissa in particular
dialog: has been most hospitable. Lucius,
dialog: on the other hand, is, I fear,
dialog: burdened by my presence. Are you,
dialog: Lucius?
speaker_heading: LUCIUS

speaker_heading: VOLDEMORT
dialog: You bring news I trust, Severus?
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: It will happen Saturday next. At
text: nightfall.
speaker_heading: VOLDEMORT
dialog: And this information comes --
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: -- from the source we discussed.
text: Yaxley, the wizard seen at the Ministry, leans into the
text: flickering light from the opposite end of the table.
speaker_heading: YAXLEY
dialog: I have heard differently, my lord.
text: Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that
dialog: the Potter boy will not be moved
dialog: until the thirtieth of this month,
dialog: the night before he turns
dialog: seventeen.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
text: This is a false trail. The Auror
dialog: Office no longer plays any part in
dialog: the protection of Harry Potter.
dialog: Those closest to him believe we
dialog: have infiltrated the Ministry.
speaker_heading: SQUAT MAN
dialog: Well, they’ve got that right,
dialog: then, ‘aven’t they?
text: As the Squat Man cackles wheezily, others join in.
text: Voldemort raises a hand. All goes silent.
speaker_heading: VOLDEMORT
dialog: Pius, what say you?
text: PIUS THICKNESSE looks up, his gaze placid.
speaker_heading: THICKNESSE
dialog: One hears many things, my lord.
dialog: Whether the truth is among them is
dialog: not clear.

speaker_heading: 12 CONTINUED: (2) 12
speaker_heading: VOLDEMORT
dialog: Spoken like a true politician.
dialog: You will, I think, prove most
dialog: useful, Pius. Where will he be
dialog: taken? The boy?
speaker_heading: SNAPE
text: To a safehouse. Likely the home
dialog: of someone in the Order. I’m told
dialog: it has been given every manner of
dialog: protection possible. Once there,
dialog: it will be impractical to attack
dialog: him. We may have compromised the
dialog: Ministry, but there are those who
dialog: remain loyal to him. As long as
dialog: the Ministry stands, his allies
dialog: within will have the means at
dialog: their disposal to insure his
dialog: safety.
speaker_heading: BELLATRIX
dialog: My lord, if I might, I’d like to
dialog: volunteer myself for this task.
dialog: I'd like to kill the boy.
text: Just then a WAIL rises from the floorboards. Voldemort’s
text: eyes flash briefly with RED.
speaker_heading: VOLDEMORT
dialog: Wormtail! Have I not spoken to
dialog: you about keeping our guest quiet?
speaker_heading: WORMTAIL
dialog: Yes, m-my lord. Right away, my
dialog: lord.
text: As WORMTAIL scrambles up, Voldemort returns his gaze to
scene_heading: BELLATRIX.
speaker_heading: VOLDEMORT
dialog: As inspiring as I find your
dialog: bloodlust, Bellatrix, I must be
dialog: the one to kill Harry Potter. But
dialog: I face an unfortunate
dialog: complication. It has recently
dialog: come to my attention that my wand
text: and Potter’s share the same core.
dialog: They are, in some ways, twins. We
dialog: can wound but not fatally harm one
dialog: another. Which means, if I am to
dialog: kill him... I will have to do it
text: with another's wand.
text: The others at the table stir nervously. Bellatrix
text: stiffens. Voldemort’s narrow eyes rake the room.

dialog: I require your wand.
text: Lucius sits mute, paralyzed by the request, scanning the
text: faces of the others, who avoid his gaze, all but Snape,
text: who regards him with naked contempt and Draco, whose eyes
text: meet his briefly, then glance away. Finally Narcissa’s
text: fingers lightly graze his wrist, summoning him back to
text: the moment. Turning, he watches as, almost
text: imperceptibly, she nods. Lowering his head, he ROLLS his
text: wand slowly across the table, where it stops at
text: Voldemort’s skeletal hand. Voldemort holds the wand to
dialog: the light.
speaker_heading: VOLDEMORT
dialog: Do I detect elm?
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: Yes, my lord.
speaker_heading: VOLDEMORT
dialog: And the core?
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: Dragon -- dragon heartstring.
text: Voldemort nods, getting a feel for the wand’s heft, then
text: his eyes shift, catch Lucius staring at the WAND on the
text: table -- Voldemort’s own.
speaker_heading: VOLDEMORT
dialog: My wand? You can’t possibly think
dialog: I would give you my wand.
text: Lucius’ eyes meet Voldemort’s. For a moment he is
text: speechless. Finally his chin drops.
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: No, my lord.
text: Voldemort studies Lucius’ bowed head, then returns his
text: attention to the wand in his hand. Raising it, he points
text: it at the body above. With a FLICK, the body awakens,
text: TWITCHING against its invisible bonds.
speaker_heading: VOLDEMORT
dialog: For those of you who do not know,
dialog: we are joined tonight by Miss
dialog: Charity Burbage who until recently
dialog: taught at Hogwarts School of
dialog: Witchcraft and Wizardry. Her
dialog: specialty was Muggle studies. It
dialog: is Miss Burbage’s belief that

dialog: She would, given her way, have us

dialog: mixture of magical and Muggle
dialog: blood is not an abomination but
dialog: something to be encouraged. I, of
dialog: course, take a contrary view. But
dialog: we're all civilized here. All
dialog: adults. We can agree to disagree.
text: Charity’s tear-streaked face revolves once more to face
text: Snape, her voice hoarse with fear.
speaker_heading: CHARITY
dialog: Severus, please. We’re friends...
text: Snape’s face remains impassive. Voldemort’s eyes narrow

scene_heading: INT. DURSLEY HOUSE - HARRY’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME - DUSK 14
text: An EYE shimmers in a SHARD of SILVERED GLASS. HARRY
text: POTTER'S eye. He tosses the mirror inside a LUMPY
text: RUCKSACK, than adds a LOCKET, a Daily Prophet CLIPPING
text: entitled “Dumbledore Remembered” (above which is a
scene_heading: PHOTOGRAPH of its author, ELPHIAS DOGE with DUMBLEDORE)
text: and a NOTEBOOK filled with scribblings on Horcruxes and,
text: in large block letters, the initials “R.A.B.” He gives

speaker_heading: UNCLE VERNON (0.S.)

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Could you tell me from where

speaker_heading: ELPHIAS DOGE
dialog: I’m afraid not. Albus’ messages
dialog: mostly referenced our days

text: surprisingly intimate. When he
dialog: did speak of his current
dialog: activities his words would turn
dialog: elliptical. Still, I sensed he

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: ELPHIAS DOGE

speaker_heading: BALDING WIZARD
dialog: Move it, will you -- oh, Runcorn!
dialog: Forgive me...
text: The Balding Wizard hurries away, clearly frightened, as

scene_heading: MAFALDA HOPKIRK/HERMIONE
dialog: You appear to be quite popular.

speaker_heading: REG CATTERMOLE/RON
dialog: I gotta tell you, I'm starting to

scene_heading: ALBERT RUNCORN/HARRY

text: sitting at a sea of small desks. Waving their wands in

text: regarding him with fear. She looks quickly away, resumes
text: her work at double-time. Harry’s eyes shift again,
text: regard a SHINING MAHOGANY DOOR across the way. He
text: squints: something is imbedded within the door. He
text: crosses the room, stops dead. Fitted into the wood is an
text: EYE. It spins weakly, then stops: Mad-Eye’s eye. He
text: looks down to the BRASS NAMEPLATE next to the door:
speaker_heading: DOLORES UMBRIDGE
scene_heading: HEAD OF THE MUGGLE-BORN REGISTRATION COMMISSION
text: Harry's jaw tightens in anger and he glances over his
text: shoulder, sees the Red-Haired Witch watching him. She
text: glances away quickly. Harry reaches into an inner pocket
text: and removes a DECOY DETONATOR, an odd object with little
text: weaving legs and a rubber-bulbed horn for a body. He
dialog: releases it.
text: It scuttles down his body, across the floor and directly
text: into the sea of desks. Harry waits. Then... Bang!
text: Black smoke billows into the air, pink pages fly
text: everywhere and the Detonator gives birth to dozens of

dialog: Mad-Eye.
text: Harry begins to search the office, opening drawers,

text: out a file. Inside is a PHOTOGRAPH of Hermione and an
scene_heading: accompanying DATA SHEET: “Blood Status: MUGGLE BORN”
text: “Whereabouts: Last seen in the company of Undesirable
text: #1." Quickly Harry replaces the file and searches out
scene_heading: Ron’s. “Blood Status: PURE BLOOD... Pro-Muggle

text: pauses, looks closer. “Father: Arthur Weasley.

scene_heading: INT. LIFT - MORNING 83
text: Harry races inside, hits a button and watches the grilles

scene_heading: ALBERT RUNCORN/HARRY

speaker_heading: ARTHUR WEASLEY

dialog: Hello, Reg. Isn’t Mary in for

scene_heading: ALBERT RUNCORN/HARRY

scene_heading: INT. PASSAGEWAY —- MORNING (MOMENTS LATER) 84

speaker_heading: REG CATTERMOLE/RON
dialog: Bloody cold down here.
text: Then they see. Swirling outside the courtroom doors like

scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - SAME TIME —- MORNING 85
text: A dark cathedral, possessed of a palpable chill.
text: Dementors float eerily in the gloom. The ceiling
text: stretches high, disappears in darkness. As Harry and Ron
text: enter -- unnoticed at first -- they move cautiously,
text: taking in their surroundings. Hermione comes INTO VIEW,
text: sitting with a STACK of PARCHMENT behind a balustrade
text: alongside Umbridge and Yaxley, while a BRIGHT-SILVER CAT
text: -- Umbridge’s Patronus -- prowls up and down, providing
text: warmth to them and them only. Harry's eyes track the
text: cat, then drift to Umbridge herself. Suddenly he
text: falters. Ron notices. Eyes him curiously. WHISPERS:
speaker_heading: REG CATTERMOLE/RON
dialog: What is it?
text: The corners of Harry’s eyes contract, his head slightly
text: cocked... as if he can sense the presence of something.
scene_heading: ALBERT RUNCORN/HARRY
dialog: It’s here...
text: As Ron reacts -- deciphering Harry’s words -- a WOMAN’S
dialog: VOICE comes their way:
scene_heading: MARY CATTERMOLE
dialog: Reg...
text: Ron turns. Below the balustrade, a frail woman, MARY
text: CATTERMOLE, sits alone, wrists chained. Seeing Ron, her
text: wan face brightens. Ron glances at Harry, who nods,
text: urging him on. Ron moves to the center of the room,

speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE

text: chain at her neck trembles like a snake, something heavy
text: swinging forward and dangling over the void.
text: The LOCKET.
text: Ron stares at it dumbstruck. Hermione catches her

text: clearly in view, the corners of his eyes narrowing once
text: again, the HUM growing louder in his ears. Slowly, he
text: reaches into his pocket...
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: No, no, I don’t think so, Mrs.

text: A flash of red light hits Umbridge and she slumps,

dialog: Piss off.

speaker_heading: YAXLEY
dialog: Seal the exits! Now!

dialog: the river. But Death was cunning.
dialog: He granted each brother a wish for
dialog: their cleverness. The oldest, who
dialog: was a combative man, asked for a
dialog: wand more powerful than any in
dialog: existence. So Death fashioned one

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: But he only wants the one, the

speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: What’re you saying?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: He knows where it is, You-Know-

dialog: Wand.
text: As Hermione stares in stunned disbelief, figures emerge
text: from the trees. Ron is shoved to the ground next to

speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Don’t touch her!

speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Stop it!
speaker_heading: SCABIOR
dialog: Your boyfriend’1l get worse than

text: Scabior paints her face with light then casts it on

speaker_heading: SCABIOR
dialog: What happened to you, ugly?
text: Harry’s hand finds his face, feels the lumps.

dialog: Barney Weasley.
speaker_heading: SCABIOR
dialog: Weasley, eh? Wouldn’t be related
dialog: to that blood traitor Arthur
dialog: Weasley, would you?
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Piss off! Arthur Weasley’s ten
dialog: times the wizard you are!
speaker_heading: SCABIOR
dialog: Worth ten times you if I can find
dialog: him. Wasn't you that tipped him
dialog: off, was it?
text: Ron stays mute. Scabior turns to Hermione.
speaker_heading: SCABIOR
dialog: How ‘bout you, lovely? What do
dialog: they call you...?
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
text: Penelope Clearwater. Half-blood.
text: Scabior strokes the nape of Hermione’s neck, then takes

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What did you put on me?
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
text: A Stinging Jinx.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: How long will it last?
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Not long.
text: Harry glances down, sees his GLASSES cupped in Hermione’s
text: palm. As he slips them into his pocket, the group
