scene_heading: INT. SALOON - DAY
text: Swinging doors open as the CAMERA TRACKS THROUGH them and into the crowded
text: barroom. It's lunchtime on November, 21, 1932, and the place is full of
text: Westerners, mostly civilians but also some scattered sailors. We hear a trio
text: singing "If I Had My Way," a pop ballad from 1913. We have missed the first
text: line of the chorus ("If I had my way, dear, forever there'd be") but it
dialog: hardly
dialog: matters:
speaker_heading: TRIO
dialog: (singing lustily)
dialog: A garden of roses for you and for me ...
text: We PAN OVER to a piano keyboard where a burning cigarette is balanced upright
text: on the next-to-last key. The pianist, accompanying the singers, snatches the
text: butt and takes a drag.
speaker_heading: TRIO
dialog: A thousand and one things, dear, I would do ...
text: We PAN OVER to the trio standing in a corner by the swinging doors -- three
text: ugly, heavyset Westerners, two men and a woman. Someone tosses them a coin
text: from off screen and the guy in the center fails to catch it. He has to bend
text: over to pick it up off the floor.
speaker_heading: TRIO
dialog: Just for you, just for you, just for you.
text: Another coin is thrown. This time, the guy on the left fails to catch it. The
text: coin falls toward the floor with a loud metallic clank. The singers look down
text: at the floor. We PAN DOWN just long enough to reveal a spittoon near the
text: singers’ feet, then PAN BACK UP to the singers who reluctantly decide not to
dialog: retrieve that particular coin. Never once during all this do they miss a
dialog: note.
speaker_heading: TRIO
dialog: If I had my way, you would never grow old,
dialog: And sunshine I'd bring every day ...
text: On the word "day," a female patron approaches the heavy woman and whispers a
text: question in her ear. Conveniently, there is a pause in the song, just long
dialog: enough for the singer to reply:
speaker_heading: HEAVY WOMAN
dialog: (brusquely)
dialog: First door to your left, dearie.
text: The female patron departs. We TRACK DOWN the crowded bar and see: two sailors
text: and a bartender toasting one another with huge glasses of beer; a bartender
text: pouring drinks for other sailors and their "dates"; various civilian men and
text: women wearing the latest styles; uniformed chauffeurs; ship's officers and
text: crew of various nationalities; etc. At one point, we briefly glimpse someone
text: carrying away the spittoon to retrieve the coin.
speaker_heading: TRIO
dialog: You would reign all alone
text: Like a queen on a throne,
dialog: If I had my way.
text: The song ends. Patrons applaud. We PAUSE at a middle-aged American bartender
text: mixing a complicated drink. He grins and speaks to an unseen patron who sits
text: at the bar, just off screen.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER #1
dialog: I haven't made one of these since
dialog: the Fourth of July.
text: In the background, we hear the trio begin a new song, another standard, this
text: one from 1918: “Till We Meet Again." The bartender takes a long whiff of the
text: drink's aroma and adds some more ingredients.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER #1
dialog: I was makin' one when the quake hit
dialog: "Frisco.
text: The bartender stirs the drink expertly and glances around.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER #1
dialog: Believe me, friend, I wouldn't go to
dialog: all this trouble for any of these
dialog: foreigners.
text: With great pride, he adds a few finishing touches, pours the contents into a
text: glass and tops it off with an olive. The unseen patron's hand reaches in to
text: pick up the glass but the bartender raises a finger at him.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER #1
dialog: Uh uh. Gotta wait a minute to let
text: the oil sink in.
text: The patron withdraws his hand. Tossing a lemon slice behind his back and
text: catching it in midair, the bartender twists it with a flourish over the
dialog: glass.
text: He inspects the drink closely, glances at the patron, then gives the lemon
text: slice another grand twist before proudly sliding the glass away.
text: Simultaneously, we hear the trio conclude their song to much applause.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER #1
dialog: There you are, partner. You can tell
dialog: your grandchildren about that one.
text: Finally, we catch our first sight of the patron, DAN HARDESTY, a handsome
text: thirtyish American man, as he puts the glass to his lips. But before he can
text: drink he's bumped into from behind by a woman with her back to him. Half the
text: drink spills out and ends up on the floor. Dan turns angrily to the woman who
text: wears a big floppy hat.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Say, what in the name of--?!
text: The woman, a dark-haired American beauty named JOAN AMES, also turns and the
text: two come face to face. She, too, has spilled some of her drink and is wide-
text: eyed with anger. But as soon as their eyes meet, their attitudes change.
text: Both are somehow instantly smitten.
text: And both realize they are holding the same obscure cocktail.
text: In the background, we hear the pianist play the film's bittersweet love
dialog: theme.
text: After a pause, Joan finds her voice first.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Why, I'm so sorry.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (a slight grin)
dialog: I'm so glad.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: (off his glass)
dialog: Such a beautiful drink, too.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Yes. Paradise cocktail.
dialog: (glances at his)
text: Seem to be a few drops left.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: (steadily)
dialog: Always the most precious, the last
dialog: few drops. That's luck.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Uh, my name is Dan.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Mine's Joan.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Hello, Joan.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Hello, Dan.
text: They shake hands like old friends.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: May we, er, drink to our meeting?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: We should.
dialog: (raises her glass)
dialog: Here's... Here's "hail and farewell."
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Oh, that seems a bit ruthless.
dialog: Let's say, uh--
text: Abruptly, two German voices drift in from the crowd -- apparently a couple of
text: sailors saying "till we meet again" to each other -- "Auf wiedersehen!" "Auf
text: wiedersehen!" -- Dan glances in their direction, then turns back to Joan and
text: raises his glass, inspired.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Auf wiedersehen.
text: Joan looks at Dan sadly for a beat and then agrees:
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Auf wiedersehen.
text: They swallow their drinks, never taking their eyes off one another. Dan holds
text: his empty glass by the stem and slowly turns it upside-down. Joan watches,
text: puzzled, as Dan smashes the top of the glass against the side of the bar and
text: drops the stem on the countertop where it rolls back and forth for a moment.
text: He grins at Joan who promptly responds in kind, smashing her glass and
dialog: placing
text: her stem on top of his, much to his surprise and delight. We get a CLOSE VIEW
text: of the crossed stems. Dan gallantly tips his hat to Joan.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: And so.
text: Dan appears ready to leave but Joan puts an arm on him.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Please. Shall I introduce you to my
dialog: friends?
text: Joan gestures to some people crowded behind her at the bar. Dan glances at
text: them and thinks it over but decides against it.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I think not. Luck has allowed us a
dialog: few drops of a Paradise cocktail--
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: And that would destroy the charm.
dialog: You're right. Let's trust luck will
dialog: come again.
text: Joan puts her hand in Dan's. They stare into each other's eyes for a long
text: moment. A dark look crosses her face. Her eyes waver and, with a slight grin,
text: she abruptly turns her back on him, as if he were suddenly a total stranger.
text: Dan looks thoughtful and puzzled but takes it in stride. He turns and heads
text: for the swinging doors. Joan turns and stares, watching him walk away. One of
text: Joan's friends notices her interest and watches, too.
speaker_heading: JOAN'S FRIEND
dialog: Known him long?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Ever so long.
speaker_heading: JOAN'S FRIEND
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: I - I can't quite remember.
speaker_heading: JOAN'S FRIEND
dialog: (wryly)
dialog: Better skip a few cocktails, darling.
text: Joan watches sadly as Dan exits out the saloon's swinging doors. He pauses
text: just outside and turns back to look over the tops of the doors at Joan. After
text: @ moment, he raises a hand in farewell.
text: At the bar, Joan forces a smile and waves at Dan, just as the pianist strikes
text: up a happier tune and her friends crowd around her.
speaker_heading: JOAN'S FRIEND
dialog: Come on, everybody. How about a
dialog: little drink to Joan?
scene_heading: ANOTHER FRIEND
dialog: (hands Joan a drink)
dialog: Joan, we're drinking to you.
speaker_heading: JOAN'S FRIEND
dialog: To Joan, dear.
text: Joan, distracted by her friends, turns her back on Dan -- and fails to see
dialog: any
dialog: of the following:
text: At the swinging doors, Dan - his hand still raised - suddenly freezes with
text: fear. His face clouds over, his eyes lower -- and he slowly, cautiously,
text: raises his other hand. It looks as if he's surrendering.
dialog: And he is.
text: We PAN DOWN as one of the doors swing open briefly to reveal an automatic
text: pistol pointed into Dan's side.
text: We PAN UP to show the guy holding the pistol: a tough-looking, square-jawed
text: man named STEVE BURKE.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: It's been a long chase, Dan.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (never losing his cool)
dialog: Yes. What detained you?
text: Burke leans in to pat down his captive.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Never mind the wisecracks.
text: Dan catches a whiff of Burke's breath.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Still on the garlic, huh?
text: Burke, insulted, backs off a little.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Well, nevertheless, it looks like
dialog: you're out of luck this time.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Apparently.
text: Dan desperately knocks the gun out of Burke's hand.
speaker_heading: FLASH CUT
text: of the gun hitting the pavement outside the saloon.
speaker_heading: DAN AND BURKE
text: struggle momentarily but Burke is the bigger man and Dan is no match for him
text: -- one punch in the jaw from Burke knocks him silly and drives him backwards.
scene_heading: EXT. SALOON AND STREET - CONTINUOUS
text: Burke easily pushes a stunned Dan into a nearby wall like a rag doll. Burke
text: handcuffs himself to Dan, then shakes his captive violently to wake him up.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Come on! Come out of it!
text: Dan regains consciousness, blinks at Burke, looks down at the cuffs
text: unhappily,
text: and nods, reluctantly accepting the situation.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Okay, you win.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: I always win. If you try to pull
dialog: another break like that on me, I'll
dialog: deliver you in a basket. Let's go.
text: The two men pull their sleeves over the cuffs in a vain effort to look
text: inconspicuous as they start walking away from the saloon. While Dan casts a
text: brief, backward glance at the swinging doors, Burke stoops and retrieves his
text: pistol, pocketing it. As they walk leisurely down the street, various
text: passersby gawk and point at the two handcuffed men.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Well, now what?
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: The boat. And then, uh, San Quentin.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Can I get my clothes?
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Oh, they're on the boat.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Considerate.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (rubs his sore jaw)
dialog: You know, I thought I ditched you
dialog: way back in Berlin.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: When I left 'Frisco, the chief said
dialog: to me, "Steve, don't come back alone.”
dialog: And he knew I wouldn't.
text: Burke abruptly stops and stares at something off screen. Dan, still walking
text: forward, is jerked back.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: I'll be a son of a sea cow.
text: Dan and Burke watch as SKIPPY, a tipsy little American man in a straw boater
text: and bow tie, waits for a Chinese shop owner to turn his back. Skippy
dialog: instantly
text: snatches an alarm clock from a display and smoothly hides it in his jacket.
text: But, just as instantly, the alarm clock goes off, ringing loudly. The Chinese
text: shop owner turns to look at Skippy who rolls his eyes in disgust, sighs, and
text: returns the clock to its proper place, giving it a light tap. It stops
dialog: ringing
text: as Skippy staggers drunkenly out of the shop and encounters Dan and Burke.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Well, if it ain't the light-fingered
dialog: Skippy.
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: (a happy drunk)
dialog: Hello, Dan!
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Hello, Skippy.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: (to Skippy)
dialog: So this is your hide-out. Hong Kong
dialog: must be pretty soft.
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: (nods)
dialog: I like it fine.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Yeah, well, ya better walk around
dialog: that U.S.A. of America like it was a
dialog: swamp.
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: (to Dan)
dialog: It's gettin’ so a guy can't go
dialog: nowheres nowadays without bumpin'
dialog: into all sorts of people.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Duluth wants you, Detroit wants you,
dialog: Sacramento wants you.
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: I'm wanted everywhere and welcome
dialog: nowhere. I'm just a vagabond.
dialog: (spots the hand-
dialog: cuffs, to Dan)
dialog: Ohhh, that's too bad.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: You can't win all the time.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: (to Dan, leading him away)
dialog: Come on.
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: Anything I can do for you here, Dan?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (off Burke)
dialog: You might poison him.
text: Dan and Burke walk off down the street. Skippy calls after them.
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: Hey, flatfoot!
text: Burke looks back at Skippy with annoyance.
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: Tell those bulls I'm an alien! Ha ha
dialog: ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
text: Skippy's laugh is even more irritating than he is. The handcuffed men walk on
text: -- Burke peeved, Dan understandably glum.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
speaker_heading: FADE IN
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN LINER - THAT AFTERNOON
text: A loud boat whistle blows. A sign reads:
scene_heading: SAILING TODAY
dialog: 3 P.M.
speaker_heading: S. S. MALOA
speaker_heading: TO
speaker_heading: SAN FRANCISCO
scene_heading: "STOPOVER IN HONOLULU"
text: We DISSOLVE TO a brief glimpse of the railing on the liner's DECK, then
text: DISSOLVE TO Dan and Burke, still cuffed, as they approach the railing and
dialog: lean
dialog: against it.
speaker_heading: DAN
text: Stateroom is like a Turkish bath.
dialog: Thanks for the outing.
text: They mop their faces with handkerchiefs.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Oh, I couldn't stand it myself.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Thanks anyhow.
dialog: (off the handcuffs)
dialog: Say, how long? The cuffs?
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: I'm takin' no chances. They broke
dialog: five of my pals when you escaped.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Well, that wasn't right. They did
text: all they could. They were shooting
dialog: at me for three blocks.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Yeah, well, it's lucky for you I
dialog: wasn't among ‘em.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Yes ...
text: Dan's attention is caught by something: a sailor on the opposite side of the
text: deck, locking the railing into place.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: ... undoubtedly.
text: Dan glances around and finds that his hand rests near the locking mechanism
dialog: of
text: the railing they are leaning against. He looks thoughtful, then glances at
dialog: Burke.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I may as well tell you now, I'm not
dialog: such a good sailor.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Hmph! Get seasick, huh?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Mm.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Well, ya better enjoy everything
dialog: while ya can, good or bad.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I suppose that includes being
dialog: harnessed to you, garlic and all.
text: Stung again, Burke is about to say something, then changes his mind.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Well, anyway, you better stand it
dialog: and like it.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: ‘rraid I can't agree to like it.
dialog: Suppose this ship were to sink.
dialog: Imagine my embarrassment to be found
dialog: dead anchored to you.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: This ship ain't goin' to sink.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Oh? They've been known to.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Well, listen, sucker, when it does,
dialog: I'll make you a little present of
dialog: this.
text: Burke pulls the handcuff key out of his vest pocket, shows it to Dan, then
dialog: pockets it again.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: When I was a kid, I used to swim
dialog: around a pier like that. Remember
dialog: your kid swimming days?
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: (increasingly irritated)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Didn't you ever have a boyhood? Can't
dialog: you swim?
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Ha!
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: What's so funny?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I was wondering what you'd do if you
dialog: were a cop in Venice.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Is that supposed to be a funny crack?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Well, it has its humorous side.
text: Without Burke seeing, Dan rapidly unlocks the railing mechanism, pushes the
text: railing hard to make it swing free, then jumps backward off the deck,
dialog: dragging
text: Burke with him as he falls. The two disappear over the side.
text: CUT WIDE as Dan and Burke fall backward into the water below, still cuffed
text: together. They hit the surface with a splash and disappear from view again.
speaker_heading: IN THE WATER
text: Dan and Burke bob to the surface. Dan forces Burke's body under the water and
text: digs around in Burke's vest pocket for the handcuff key. Somehow, he is able
text: to find it and unlock his cuff as the two men struggle. Burke tries to come
dialog: up
text: for air but Dan forces him down again. Somewhere above, a whistle blows and
text: someone shouts, "Man overboard!"
speaker_heading: ON DECK
text: Officers and passengers rush to the ship's side to see what's happening.
speaker_heading: IN THE WATER
text: Dan looks up to see:
speaker_heading: ON DECK
text: A crowd gathering at the railing, peering down at him.
speaker_heading: IN THE WATER
text: With all those people watching, Dan has no choice but to haul Burke out of
dialog: the
text: water by his hair.
speaker_heading: ON DECK
text: An even larger mob gathers.
speaker_heading: IN THE WATER
text: Dan reluctantly puts an arm around Burke and starts swimming for shore.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (to the crowd)
dialog: It's all right, I've got him!
speaker_heading: ON DECK
text: Among the passengers watching with concern is none other than Joan. She peers
text: down at the two men in the water, failing to recognize Dan.
speaker_heading: IN THE WATER
text: Dan struggles toward shore with an unconscious Burke in tow. Peering up, he
dialog: sees:
scene_heading: ON DECK (TELEPHOTO ZOOM SHOT FROM BELOW)
text: Joan, wearing her big floppy hat, leans over the railing.
speaker_heading: IN THE WATER
text: Dan sees Joan (and her hat) and smiles in recognition. He keeps swimming.
speaker_heading: ON DECK
text: The crowd of onlookers, grouped near a raised anchor, watch with interest.
speaker_heading: IN THE WATER
text: Dan reaches a wooden pier and helps Burke on to a floating log lashed to it.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Here ya are. Reach for the log.
dialog: Hold on.
text: Burke, regaining consciousness, grips the log as Dan pulls himself atop it.
text: Straddling the log, Dan helps Burke out of the water.
speaker_heading: ON DECK
text: The crowd at the anchor watches in relief.
speaker_heading: IN THE WATER
text: Dan and Burke sit on the log. Dan rises.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Lucky for you I knew where that key
dialog: was.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: (still dazed)
dialog: Yeah. Thanks.
text: Dan helps Burke to a nearby ladder.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. DAN AND BURKE'S STATEROOM - LATER
text: Dan puts on dry clothes as Burke, already changed, sits behind him, checking
text: and holstering his pistol.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Hey, you know, somebody must have
dialog: left that rail unfastened. Leanin'
dialog: there and, all of a sudden, we're in
dialog: the ocean.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (dryly)
dialog: Yes. We ought to sue the company.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: I still can't see why you saved my
dialog: life with what's facing you.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Ah, suppose we don't discuss that.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Well, anyway, I - I kind o' feel
dialog: like I ought to do you a little
dialog: favor.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: What? For a little thing like your
dialog: life?
text: Dan hears the click of the handcuffs behind him and glances in Burke's
text: direction. PAN OVER TO Burke holding the open handcuffs in his hands.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I'll tell you what you can do.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Those are not particularly becoming
text: to the well-dressed man. ‘Sides,
dialog: once this ship's at sea, there's no
dialog: chance for a getaway. Kind o'
dialog: tough on both of us to be ironed.
dialog: What do you say?
text: Burke looks at the cuffs and thinks it over. After a beat, he pockets them.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: All right, Dan.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (surprised but pleased)
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: But if you try to pull a fast one on
dialog: me, I'll knock you off cold. Is that
dialog: understood?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Obviously.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: I ain't kiddin’.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Well, I couldn't suspect you of that.
text: Burke gives Dan a double take. Dan looks amused.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Well, it's kind of stuffy in here.
dialog: All right if I go on deck?
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: (casually)
dialog: Sure.
text: Dan grabs a cap and heads for the door. Burke rises and follows, grabbing a
dialog: jacket.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: But I'll go along with ya.
text: Dan nods in reluctant agreement and the two men exit the stateroom.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
speaker_heading: A NEON SIGN
text: shaped like an arrow. It reads: "To gangplank"
text: We PAN OVER AND DOWN from this to the PURSER'S STATION where Dan is in the
text: middle of a conversation with the uniformed purser.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I have an important message to
dialog: deliver to her and, like an idiot, I
dialog: forgot her last name. Her first name
dialog: is "Joan."
speaker_heading: PURSER
dialog: I'm sorry, sir, but--
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: She's about, uh-- Oh, she's about so
text: tall. Jet black hair and large brown
text: eyes.
speaker_heading: PURSER
dialog: Well, without her last name, it'll be
dialog: awfully hard for me to find her.
text: During this conversation, we PAN OVER to Burke who watches and listens from
text: under the gangplank sign, shaking his head in disbelief. Burke looks in the
text: direction of the gangplank as he hears a noisy crowd.
scene_heading: THE GANGPLANK
text: is being unhooked from the ship. A huge crowd of well-wishers fill the dock,
text: waving to passengers on deck and chattering noisily. Running through the
dialog: crowd
text: is Skippy who races up the gangplank just as it is pulled away and jumps onto
text: the ship ahead of the two Hong Kong policemen who are chasing him. Skippy,
text: relieved, sits in the doorway where the gangplank was anchored a moment ago
text: and waves to the policemen who, left stranded at the dock, wave their
text: nightsticks at him angrily.
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: (salutes the police)
dialog: You must come and see us sometime!
text: Skippy, sitting in the gangplank doorway, laughs his inimitable, irritating
text: laugh and waves good-bye. As he does, a man comes up to Skippy from behind
dialog: and
text: pauses next to him - at first, we see only the man's legs. The boat's whistle
text: blows ominously as Skippy looks down to see the two flat feet beside him. His
text: face falls as he looks up to see Burke, hands in his pockets, towering over
text: him grimly.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
speaker_heading: FADE IN
scene_heading: A MAP OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN
text: This map will reappear throughout the film to mark the ship's progress.
text: Three points on the map are identified: Hong Kong, Honolulu and San

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: JOAN AND HER DOCTOR
text: Joan sits glumly as the doctor stands over her, trying to be gentle.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: You're cutting your months into
dialog: weeks, your weeks into days--
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: And my days into hours. Is that it?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: It is.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: What you really mean -- and you're
dialog: too kind to say -- is that if I stay
dialog: in my stateroom, lie in bed, deny
dialog: myself everything, even the - the
dialog: mildest diversion, I may live to
text: arrive at that charming sanitarium.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: You state it very cruelly.
text: Joan rises and crosses to her cabin's window. She looks out.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: It's not a pretty picture, is it?
dialog: (reluctantly)
dialog: All right. All right, doctor. I'll
dialog: do what you say.
dialog: (chuckles)
dialog: Funny how we cling to life even
dialog: after it's worthless.
text: Joan hears the sound of Dan's voice drifting in through the open window.
speaker_heading: DAN'S VOICE
text: She's about so tall, black hair,

dialog: Joan.
text: Peering through the window, Joan sees Dan walking the deck with a steward.
text: Delighted, she watches them pass and then turns back to the doctor.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Oh, no. No, I was wrong. I know now
dialog: what I want. I want to crowd all the
dialog: intense, beautiful happiness possible
dialog: into what life I've got left. That's
dialog: all living's for. If it's only for a
dialog: few hours, I want to have it. And I'm
dialog: going to have it -- all I can get my
text: hands on.
text: Joan leaves the window, moves toward the door. The doctor tries to stop her.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Joan, I--
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Now, doctor, I am going on deck.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: But, Jo--
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Goodbye!
text: With a huge smile, she breaks away from him and is instantly out the door,
text: slamming it shut behind her.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SHIP'S LOUNGE - MOMENTS LATER
speaker_heading: DAN
text: sits at the bar as a young bartender mixes him a drink.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER #2
dialog: (to Dan)
dialog: I don't know, she might've been in
text: here, but I didn't notice her.
speaker_heading: JOAN
text: enters the lounge and looks around anxiously. She spots
speaker_heading: DAN
text: who is busy lighting a cigarette and fails to see her.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (to the bartender)
dialog: Mm, then she wasn't here. You'd've
dialog: noticed her.
text: JOAN, smiling radiantly, checks her hair and then moves toward Dan.
speaker_heading: AT THE BAR
text: Joan joins Dan at the bar, approaching him from behind so that he doesn't see
text: her. The bartender, having just poured Dan's drink, now looks up from his
dialog: work
text: and notices her. He raises his eyebrows and smiles in recognition.
text: She indicates with a gesture that he should pour her the same drink -- which
text: he promptly does, with a grin. The bartender watches with interest as Dan
dialog: puts
text: his glass to his lips at the same moment Joan speaks to him:
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Hello, Dan.
text: Dan turns and looks at her, pleased and surprised. We hear their love theme.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Hello, Joan.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: The luck's come back.
text: Dan nods, noticing that, once again, they both hold the same drink.
speaker_heading: DAN
text: This time, in full glasses.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: We mustn't lose a drop, Dan.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (toasts her)
dialog: Health.
text: A dark look crosses Joan's face. She recovers with a smile and corrects him:
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Luck.
text: Once again, they swallow their drinks, never taking their eyes from one
text: another. They exchange grins.
text: The bartender smiles warmly at this.
text: Joan, holding her glass by the stem, smashes it against the bar.
text: The bartender's eyes pop in surprise.
text: Joan places her stem on the countertop. Then, Dan smashes his glass.
text: The startled bartender flinches.
text: As before, Dan crosses his stem with Joan's. They smile at each other as we
text: TRUCK FORWARD for a CLOSER VIEW of the crossed stems on the countertop
dialog: between
dialog: them.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SHIP'S DECK - SUNSET
text: Dan and Joan stand at the railing together watching the sun go down.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: The day knows how to go out. Ina
dialog: blaze of glory. Forgive me if I'm
dialog: going poetic on you. But life is
dialog: wonderful, Dan.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: And its best moment is when we
dialog: find it out.
text: Joan thinks about this a moment and then turns to look at the ocean.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
speaker_heading: IRIS IN
scene_heading: EXT. S. MALOA - NIGHT
text: The ship sails east under a night sky.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DECK - NIGHT
text: Dan and Burke, in dinner clothes, stand outside the ship's lounge, peering in
text: through the well-lit windows. Classical piano music. The two men enter
dialog: through
text: a nearby door.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: A smartly-dressed crowd listens as an attractive, aristocratic woman
dialog: elegantly
text: plays a grand piano. We get a CLOSE VIEW of the woman, known to her fellow
dialog: passengers as Countess Bettina de Barilhaus, but whom we shall call BETTY for
dialog: short.
text: Dan and Burke arrive as Betty concludes her number. The crowd applauds. Betty
text: rises and catches sight of Dan and Burke. Burke stares at her with interest
text: Dan lowers his eyes and tries to look bored.
text: Betty, carrying an expensive fan, joins her stiff British date -- a tuxedoed,
text: monocled nobleman named SIR HAROLD.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (pleasantly, with a
dialog: vaguely European accent)
dialog: Now, we must be going.
text: Sir Harold nods and the two begin to walk off together. Members of the crowd
text: groan and protest, "Aw, Countess ..." "Please!" —- but she waves them off
dialog: politely.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: No, no, no, no. You'll forgive me.
dialog: I'm very fatigued. Some other time.
text: But before she can get away a bejeweled dowager stops her.
speaker_heading: DOWAGER
dialog: Oh, Countess, are you of the Bavarian
dialog: Barilhauses?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (coolly)
dialog: Mm, the elder son.
speaker_heading: DOWAGER
dialog: I had the pleasure in meeting them
dialog: last summer.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (unenthusiastic)
dialog: Delightful. We must have tea
dialog: together some time.
text: Betty moves off. Sir Harold follows like a puppy dog.
speaker_heading: SIR HAROLD
dialog: Countess, you play divinely.
text: As she passes, Betty ignores Burke but pauses ever so slightly to get a good
text: look at Dan who pointedly shows no sign of recognizing her. Burke watches
text: Betty, struck by her beauty.
text: Betty and Sir Harold stand apart from the others.
speaker_heading: SIR HAROLD
dialog: Shall I see you ... later, Countess?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Not tonight, Sir Harold. Tomorrow
dialog: night, I promise you.
text: Betty puts her hand in his.
speaker_heading: SIR HAROLD
dialog: I shall live ... in anticipation.
text: Sir Harold kisses Betty's hand grandly.
text: Burke jealously watches all this with interest -- it's not the sort of
text: activity a Frisco cop sees much of.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (amused, to Burke)
dialog: Don't let the royalty get you down.
text: Dan moves off as Burke smiles self-consciously and gives him a dismissive
dialog: wave.
text: Fanning herself, Betty watches Sir Harold walk away. He pauses, turns, and
text: delivers a courtly bow to her. She nods in reply and they turn from one
text: another. As they do, Skippy abruptly enters and nearly bumps into Betty. His
text: face lights up with recognition:
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: Well! If it ain't--
text: Skippy offers a hand in greeting. But Betty ignores this, instantly dropping
text: both her voice and her European accent:
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (American accent)
dialog: Play dead, chump. Tail me to my
dialog: joint.
text: Skippy watches with surprise as Betty, fanning herself, briskly walks off. He
text: puts on his hat and nonchalantly strolls after her.
speaker_heading: AT THE BAR
text: Burke joins the same young bartender who waited on Dan and Joan earlier.
dialog: Self-
text: conscious about his garlic breath, Burke screws up his face and glances in
text: Dan's direction while deciding what to order.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER #2
dialog: Something I can do for you, sir?
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: (unhappily)
dialog: Buttermilk.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER #2
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Bartender pulls out a tall glass and a pitcher of buttermilk.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Say, pal, will ya do me a favor?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER #2
dialog: Yes, sir?
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: What do you call a countess when you
dialog: wanna speak to her?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER #2
dialog: Hmm.
dialog: (unconvincingly)
dialog: "Madame la Countesse."
text: We PAN DOWN the bar to another bartender who assembles an elaborate tray of
text: bottles, glasses, ice, and other mixings. A steward takes the tray and
dialog: carries
dialog: it off.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. BETTY'S CABIN - LATER
text: The steward arrives at the cabin door with the elaborate tray and knocks.
text: After a moment, he opens the door and enters, placing the tray on a table.
text: Also visible on the table are Skippy's feet which are propped up on the edge.
text: Skippy tosses a coin onto the tray -- a tip for the steward.
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: Thank you!
text: The steward takes the coin and departs, closing the door behind him. Skippy
text: takes his feet down off the table, reaches over and grabs a bottle of gin
dialog: from
text: the tray. We see his smiling face for the first time as he opens the bottle
text: and brings it to his lips. He chugs the contents. And chugs. And chugs.
text: We CUT WIDE to reveal that Betty is lounging nearby on a sofa, watching him.
text: After a moment, she speaks to him -- not with her fancy European accent, but
dialog: with her tough American one.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Say, don't you ever breathe?
text: Skippy stops drinking, exhales deeply, and hands Betty the bottle. She wipes
text: the mouth of the bottle and takes a fairly long swig herself -- much to
text: Skippy's surprise. Skippy looks over the tray with all its mixings.
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: What's the idea of all the landscape
dialog: gardening?
speaker_heading: BETTY
text: (haughtily, using her
dialog: fake European accent)
dialog: Oh, straight gin is so vulgar, my
dialog: dear --
dialog: (instantly lapsing
dialog: into Americanese)
dialog: Oh, boy! Are my pups growling!
text: Betty leans over and rubs her sore feet.
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Betty, don't they ever get on to
dialog: you? You've been gettin’ away with
dialog: this for years. Who are ya supposed
dialog: to be now?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Sucker...
dialog: (strips away
dialog: her bangs)
dialog: -.. meet Bettina, la Comtesse de
dialog: Barilhaus.
text: She tosses her fake bangs aside.
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: Oh, Barilhaus. Oh, I get it!
dialog: "Barrel House" Betty! Barilhaus,
dialog: sure. Have you got anything lined
dialog: up?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Mm, did ya get a load of that
dialog: Englishman with the single cheater?
text: She means, of course, Sir Harold and his monocle. Betty dabs a cloth with gin
text: and scours her forehead.
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
text: I did. Full face, he looks like the
dialog: Bank of England. Look, I had an
dialog: idea--
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Now, lay off! No petty larceny in
dialog: this one. Say, if I make this touch,
dialog: I'm through. Sick of jumping every
text: time there's a knock at the door.
dialog: You know, this sticky stuff's bad
dialog: for my scalp. Hm. Guess I'm just
dialog: tired.
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: You hustlers are all alike. Spend
dialog: all your time in the twilight sleep.
dialog: What've ya got on your mind?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Say, I'ma sucker, just like the
dialog: rest of them. I want a chicken
dialog: ranch.
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: Oh, sure, I know that one, too. All
dialog: you need is five thousand hens and
text: one rooster.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: That's the set-up.
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: Stop kiddin' yourself, Betty.
dialog: You'll be ridin' these tubs till
dialog: they count ten over ya.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I may fool ya.
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: I hope ya do.
text: She takes a swig of gin and hands him back the bottle.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Spray your throat.
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: Here's to the rooster. Cluck, cluck,
text: cluck, cluck, cluck.
text: Betty chuckles as Skippy drinks
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Say, uh, who's the mug with Dan
dialog: Hardesty?
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: He's a copper. The toughest one out
dialog: of Frisco.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Pinch?
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: Nothin' else.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Tough rap?
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: The toughest.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: Murder?
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: If you can call it murder for croakin'
dialog: the dirtiest heel that ever lived.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Well, any chance to beat the rap?
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: No, no. He's already been sentenced.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Well, then, how's he-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: He broke. He broke when they were
dialog: takin' him to San Quentin.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (realizes what that means)
dialog: The rope.
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: (soberly)
dialog: The rope.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Whew.
text: Shaken, Betty rises in disbelief and ends up at the cabin window.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: He's a swell guy, too. Gee, he came
dialog: to the front for me in Singapore
dialog: when I was in wrong.
dialog: (with emphasis)
dialog: And I was in wrong.
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: Took a long chance for me.
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Certainly wish I could pay him back
dialog: the same way.
text: Betty sees something out the window and draws back the curtain for a better
text: look. She glances over at Skippy, motions with her eyes for him to join her,
text: then continues to stare out.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Look.
text: We hear Joan and Dan's theme as Skippy joins Betty at the window. The two
text: crooks stand together and see:
speaker_heading: DAN AND JOAN
text: standing at the ship's railing.
speaker_heading: BETTY'S VOICE
dialog: He's got everything. Strength,
dialog: youth, courage. ...
scene_heading: BETTY AND SKIPPY
text: watch Dan and Joan glumly.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: ... Everything that makes life fit
dialog: to live.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's just a ghost.
text: Skippy nods solemnly.
speaker_heading: DAN AND JOAN
text: stand at the railing and look out at the ocean.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ON DECK - CONTINUOUS
text: Joan stares out at the water. Dan smokes a cigarette.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Is it late?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Does it matter?
text: She turns to him with a smile.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Not any more.
dialog: (dreamily)
text: The world and time seem somewhere
dialog: else.
text: Dan moves in warmly to give Joan a kiss but before they do, we CUT TO:
scene_heading: BETTY AND SKIPPY
text: watching at the window. Betty shuts the curtain and looks thoughtful.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Death ain't tough enough.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He's gotta fall in love.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
speaker_heading: FADE IN
scene_heading: A MAP OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DECK - DAY
text: Dan and Burke, casually dressed, stand at the rail.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Let's take a turn around the deck.
text: Dan shows no interest, calmly puffing a cigarette.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: I do forty laps a day. Keeps you in
dialog: shape.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (dryly)
dialog: What's the percentage of me keeping
dialog: in shape?
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Why, it's, uh, better than, uh,
text: mooning around the deck all night.
text: A smiling Joan appears in a doorway and heads for the men. Dan chucks his
text: cigarette over the side and tips his cap as he takes Joan's hand.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Oh, good morning.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: May I present Mr. Burke? Miss Ames.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: How do you do?
text: Joan and Burke shake hands.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: How do you do?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Mr. Burke is an old friend of mine.
dialog: We're ... traveling together.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: How nice.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Yeah, we're together all the time.
speaker_heading: DAN
text: Practically inseparable.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: (pleasantly, to Burke)
dialog: Well, I'm taking him for the
dialog: afternoon.
dialog: (drags Dan away)
dialog: Come along, Dan.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: That's all right.
text: Burke watches them go, then takes a few deep breaths and starts his first lap
text: around the deck. Farther down the deck, we see
speaker_heading: BETTY
text: sitting in a lounge chair with a book in hand. She grins at
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
text: standing nearby. He readies himself and then adopts a drunken attitude,
text: staggering forward.
speaker_heading: WIDE SHOT
text: Skippy staggers down the deck and pretends to lose his balance, collapsing on
text: top of Betty who screams. Skippy, sitting on her legs, tips his hat to her
text: apologetically as Burke strides into view, grabs Skippy's collar and hauls
dialog: him
text: to his feet.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Hey, you little tramp! I ought to
dialog: throw you overboard!
text: Burke shoves Skippy who wobbles away.
speaker_heading: BETTY
text: sighs, whimpers, and employs her European accent, pretending to be a damsel
dialog: in
text: distress to engage Burke's sympathy.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Isn't it possible for a lady to to
dialog: go anywhere nowadays without bumping
dialog: into all sorts of people?!
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
text: peers around a corner at Burke and Betty.
speaker_heading: BURKE
text: hollers at Skippy.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: If I had you on shore, I'd--!
scene_heading: BETTY AND BURKE
speaker_heading: BETTY

dialog: Oh, I'm so frightened.
speaker_heading: BURKE

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Ah, you are good. So brave. I am
dialog: very, very grateful.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: (genuinely pleased)
dialog: Aw, don't mention it, eh, Madame la

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Oh, you know me, huh? Who I am? I
dialog: have not the pleasure to know you.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Oh, uh, my name's Steve Burke.
speaker_heading: BETTY
text: Delighted. Monsieur Burke.
text: Betty offers Burke her hand. He is about to bend over to kiss it when he
dialog: looks
text: around self-consciously and decides instead to shake it vigorously. She
text: invites him to sit in the lounge chair next to her.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Now, come, you sit down with me for
dialog: a few minutes, hm?
dialog: (Burke sits)
dialog: Oh, that terrible man, he might
dialog: come back.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Aw, nobody's gonna bother you --

speaker_heading: BETTY

speaker_heading: BURKE

speaker_heading: SKIPPY

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SHIP'S LOUNGE - DAY
text: At the bar, a patron downs a drink and then walks away, just as Skippy
text: arrives. Seeing that the bartender at the cash register has his back turned
dialog: to
text: him, Skippy, left alone with the patron's empty glass and a nearly full
dialog: bottle
text: of liquor, pours himself a drink. He knocks it back rapidly, holding onto his
text: hat to keep it from falling off. He quickly sets the glass down and tries to
text: look nonchalant.
text: Seeing that the bartender is still busy at the register, Skippy pours himself
text: another shot, downs it fast, and resumes his nonchalant pose. Finally, Skippy
text: ignores the glass and simply grabs the bottle to chug down even more alcohol.
text: Satisfied, he exhales deeply, grins, hiccups, buttons his coat and starts to
dialog: move off.
text: At last, the bartender, hands full of money, turns from the cash register and
text: sees Skippy trying to leave unnoticed.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER #2
dialog: Hey...!
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: Oh, yes. Almost forgot. My change.
text: The bartender raises his eyebrows in surprise and squints in confusion.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER #2
dialog: I beg your pardon, sir? What was it
dialog: you gave me?
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: I gave ya a five dollar bill.
text: The bartender counts out the change.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER #2
dialog: Yes, sir, I'm - I'm sorry, sir.
dialog: Sorry, sir.
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: Oh, oh, wait, you only took off

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
text: A drunken Skippy bumbles down the hallway toward a full-length mirror,

speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: I beg your pardon.
text: After a pause, he straightens and heads toward the mirror again. And, exactly
text: as before, he mistakes his own reflection for an oncoming passenger, backs up
text: a little, takes off his hat and bows.
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: After you, sir.
text: Another pause. Skippy straightens and again heads toward the mirror, spots
dialog: his
text: reflection, and backs away. This time another passenger actually does walk
dialog: by.
text: Skippy looks up at the man.
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: (annoyed, to the man)
dialog: Say, how long is this parade gonna
dialog: last?
text: Puzzled, the man looks at Skippy for a moment, says nothing, then walks off.
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: (to the man)
dialog: Oh, you won't talk, huh?
text: Skippy snaps his fingers with contempt at the departing man, then turns and
text: heads back toward the mirror -- where he once again runs into his reflection.
text: This time, he raises a hand in protest.
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: No, you don't! No, you don't!
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE - SKIPPY (MIRROR NOT VISIBLE)

scene_heading: SKIPPY AND THE BROKEN MIRROR

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. SHIP'S LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: Starting with a tuba (matched to the fog horn), we PAN OVER the ship's
text: orchestra as it plays dance music. Then, we PAN OVER to the numerous dancers
text: in the lounge. Betty dances with Sir Harold but smiles at Burke who stands to
text: one side watching her. He scowls a little, annoyed and puzzled that she's
text: dancing with another man.
text: We PAN OVER to Dan and Joan, also on the dance floor, in utter bliss. The
dialog: song
text: ends. Nearly everyone breaks and applauds the musicians. But Dan and Joan
dialog: stay
text: in each others' arms and regard one another lovingly.
text: The next number begins, a livelier uptempo piece. Sir Harold attempts to
dialog: dance
text: with Betty but Burke muscles in, brusquely grabs Sir Harold's wrist and
dialog: pushes
text: him away, showing no regard for etiquette. Betty merely hands her elegant fan
text: to Sir Harold who nods politely and watches as Burke grabs Betty and dances
text: away with her.
text: Betty and Burke turn out to be the best rubber-legged dancers on the floor.
text: Skippy, hat in hand, watches the couple from the sidelines.
text: Burke puts a lot of energy into his eccentric dance moves.
text: Skippy points and laughs his irritating laugh.
text: Burke and Betty pause at the sound of the laugh to stare at Skippy.
text: But he just keeps laughing at them.
text: Betty smiles as Burke gives Skippy a long dirty look. They dance even more
text: energetically.
text: A grim Sir Harold watches all this unhappily, fanning himself with Betty's
text: fan. After a moment, he peers down at the fan, realizes he looks ridiculous
text: and folds it up.
text: DAN AND JOAN, meanwhile, are also still on the floor.
text: On the sidelines, Joan's doctor watches the two of them with concern. She is
text: clearly overexerting herself.
text: Joan looks stricken, pauses, and leans on Dan for support.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Dan. Dan, wait.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Oh, my dear. What is it, sweet?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: I'm all right. Let's - let's go out
text: on deck.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Yes, of course, dear.
text: As the music ends and the crowd applauds, Dan helps Joan off the floor. The

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DECK - NIGHT
text: As the ship's orchestra plays their love theme, Dan and Joan sit together in

speaker_heading: DAN

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Much better. Out here.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: It is rather nice to get away from

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Tomorrow, Honolulu. I have the whole

speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: You don't sound very enthusiastic.
speaker_heading: DAN

speaker_heading: DAN

dialog: with you, Countess--
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (amused, to Joan)
dialog: You know, Steven dances like a gigolo.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: I wouldn't say that exactly. You two
dialog: ain't so bad yourselves. Why aren't
dialog: you going at it?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: I'm saving my strength for tomorrow
dialog: in Honolulu. Dan's taking me for a
dialog: long drive.
text: Burke doesn't like the sound of that.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: (to Dan)
dialog: Oh, so you're going for a long ride,
dialog: huh?
text: Dan averts his eyes. Betty senses the need to intervene.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: That's swell.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I think I need a lemonade. Come
dialog: Steven.
dialog: (to Joan)
dialog: We'll see you later.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Au revoir.
text: Dan politely rises as Betty and Burke move off.
scene_heading: BETTY AND BURKE
text: stroll down the deck. Burke is moody.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: What's the matter, Steven?
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: I wonder if that guy back there
text: thinks he's pulling me.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Why? What about?
text: They pause. Burke decides to level with her
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: I may as well tell ya now. We ain't
dialog: pals. He's my prisoner.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Wha-at? You are a police officer?
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Sergeant, First Grade.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (pretends to be impressed
dialog: Oh! Ohhh.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: And I know what's going on in that
dialog: guy's mind like I can open it and
dialog: look in it.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Oh, you're wonderful! You know, I
dialog: always wanted to meet a detective.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Honolulu's the last stop. That means
dialog: it's his last chance to make a get-
dialog: away. And that's what that guy's
dialog: thinkin', thinkin' every moment. But
dialog: he's only wastin' his time.
speaker_heading: DAN AND JOAN

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Cross the island, I - I know the

dialog: there. Have you all to myself.
text: Dan and Joan kiss, deeply, passionately.
scene_heading: BETTY AND BURKE
text: continue their conversation farther down the deck
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Let him once get near the shore and
dialog: he'll risk his life to make a

text: Burke shows Betty his holstered pistol.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (laughs nervously)
dialog: Oh, you frighten me. What are you
dialog: going to do?
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: I'm gonna put him in the brig.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Brig? What is "brig"?
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: That's what they call a jail ona

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Good night, Dan.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Good night, Joan.
text: We hear their theme again briefly as Joan starts into her room. Dan takes her

speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Until tomorrow.
text: Joan closes her door and Dan heads off down the hall, lost in thought.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DECK - LATER THAT NIGHT

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. BETTY'S ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Betty opens the door for Skippy who enters and looks around puzzled. Betty
text: closes the door behind him and crosses to a table. Skippy follows.
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: What's the matter?
text: Betty scoops a half dozen bullets off the table into her hand and gives them
text: to a delighted Skippy.
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: From the copper's gun? How'd you get
dialog: "em?
text: Betty merely glances over to a nearby chair. Burke's bow tie is draped over
text: it. In the background: an unmade bed. Skippy starts to laugh but Betty covers

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Now, get this. You go to Dan
dialog: Hardesty...
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DECK - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: A fog horn. Skippy, concealed between some lifeboats, steps out to peer down

text: being watched and joins Skippy between the lifeboats.
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: You're slated for the brig, any
dialog: minute.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I was afraid of that.
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: But, look.
text: Skippy shows Dan a handful of bullets.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: From Burke's gun?
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
text: Yeah. Betty pulled his teeth.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: That gives me a chance.
text: Skippy whips out a wad of bills and hands it to Dan.
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: Hey, here's a bankroll. You'll need

speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: English money?
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: Well, that's the only kind Sir

speaker_heading: DAN

speaker_heading: DAN

speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: That's okay.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Can I help you bring him down?
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: No, no, I don't need any help. I can

speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I'd like you to deliver this to Miss
dialog: Joan Ames in stateroom B-fifty-five
dialog: -- about an hour after the ship
text: docks in Honolulu.
speaker_heading: STEWARD
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (hands over the

dialog: You understand? About an hour after
dialog: we dock, not before that.
speaker_heading: STEWARD
dialog: Very good, sir.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (rises)
dialog: And ... don't disturb me for a
dialog: couple of hours. I think I'll take a
dialog: nap. I'll ring you if I want you.
speaker_heading: STEWARD
dialog: Very good, sir.
text: Dan watches the steward exit, then quickly grabs a heavy glass water decanter
text: from a nearby table and dumps it out in the bathroom sink. Spotting a towel,
text: he grabs it and carries the decanter and the towel to the rear of the cabin.
text: He places the decanter strategically on the table, then opens the towel,
text: twists it into a gag and places it against his mouth for measure. Satisfied
dialog: it
text: will gag Burke effectively, he hides it under a bed sheet.
scene_heading: IN THE HALL
text: outside the cabin, Burke arrives. He pauses at the door, looks around. Then,
text: taking no chances, he draws his pistol and checks it. No bullets. He takes
dialog: out
text: the clip: empty. He casts a suspicious look at the door.
speaker_heading: IN THE ROOM
text: Dan readies a rope with which to tie Burke.
scene_heading: IN THE HALL
text: Scowling, Burke nods in understanding, guessing that Dan has stolen his
text: ammunition. He takes a fresh clip from his pocket, loads and reholsters his
dialog: gun.
speaker_heading: IN THE ROOM
text: Dan hears Burke opening the door and stuffs the rope under his pillow. Then,
text: smoothing his hair, moves to a bureau and grabs a cigarette. He turns to see
text: Burke staring at him grimly. Dan lights his cigarette.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Well, pal, you look pretty smooth.
dialog: Going ashore?
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Yeah, but, I'm sorry, pal. You're
dialog: goin' in the brig.
text: Burke moves casually into the bathroom. Dan, just as casually, moves in his
dialog: direction.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: That's a bit tough but ... I can't
dialog: say I blame you.
text: Burke, in the bathroom, keeps an eye on Dan in the bathroom mirror.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Yeah, you know how it is. A guy's
dialog: gotta do his duty.
text: Burke watches in the mirror as Dan sets down his cigarette and picks up the
text: heavy glass decanter.
text: Burke reaches for his pistol.
text: Dan raises the decanter and moves forward rapidly.
text: Grinning, Burke spins and fires.
text: The decanter shatters and Dan freezes, staring first at Burke and then at the
text: broken glass in his upraised hand. Dan looks stunned and puzzled, then lowers
text: his hand and sighs at Burke.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Not bad.
text: Burke covers Dan with his pistol.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: And now, if you've no serious
dialog: objections, pal, let's get going.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: No objections.
text: Dan sets what's left of the decanter down. The two men move to the door and
dialog: exit.
scene_heading: IN THE HALL
text: Passersby murmur noisily, having heard the sound of a gunshot. Burke holsters
text: his pistol.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: All right, pal, across the hall and
text: down through the engine room.
text: Ignoring passengers and officers, the two men walk off.
text: Watching all this from a corner is a worried Skippy.
speaker_heading: BELOW DECK
text: Noises from the engine room reverberate as Dan and Burke walk down several
text: flights of narrow stairs. They pass a good deal of machinery, deep in the
text: bowels of the ship. Occasionally, Dan must pause to get directions from Burke
text: who stays behind him at all times. Finally, they arrive at the brig.
text: Skippy trails behind, peering around a corner.
text: Burke unlocks and opens the cell door, then points for Dan to enter. Dan
text: enters and Burke locks him in. Burke starts to leave but then decides to say
text: something to Dan through the door.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Listen, sucker, the next time you
dialog: take the shells out of a smart guy's
dialog: gun, remember to put some blanks

speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: Dan is in the brig. The copper's got
dialog: the key here.
text: Skippy pats his his left-hand jacket pocket. Betty shows no emotion
dialog: whatsoever.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Oke.
text: Skippy wobbles off and takes up a position down the hall. Joan, wearing a
text: gorgeous white dress for her day in Honolulu, joins Betty.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Good morning.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Good morning. I, er, I was just
dialog: waiting for Mr. Burke to take me

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Seen Dan?
speaker_heading: BETTY

speaker_heading: BURKE

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Good morning, Mr. Burke.
text: Betty immediately coos over Burke and runs her hands over him.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (to Joan)
dialog: Oooh. Doesn't he look handsome?
text: Betty easily picks Burke's pocket and palms the key. Skippy, watching this
text: from a distance, laughs his annoying laugh.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Have you seen Dan anywhere?
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: (uncomfortably)
dialog: Why, er-- No, I - I haven't.
dialog: (to Betty)
dialog: We gotta go.
speaker_heading: JOAN

speaker_heading: BETTY

speaker_heading: BURKE

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Mm, poor kid--

text: Dan is speechless. He grips Skippy's shoulders warmly and rushes off without

speaker_heading: BELOW DECK
text: Dan strides past the heavy machinery and climbs the narrow stairs to the
dialog: deck.

text: Joan looks around with concern for Dan.
speaker_heading: BELOW DECK
text: Dan hustles up the stairs, then slows to a walk as he reaches the deck.
text: AT THE GANGPLANK
text: Joan moves off in search of Dan.
text: Dan rounds a corner and sees the empty gangplank. He puts on his hat and
dialog: heads
dialog: for it.
text: But Joan spots Dan as he starts down.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Dan!

speaker_heading: JOAN

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: It's all right now that you're here

speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Of course.

speaker_heading: JOAN

speaker_heading: DOCTOR

speaker_heading: DAN

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. WATERFRONT DIVE - MINUTES LATER

speaker_heading: JOAN

speaker_heading: DAN

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Anywhere, Dan.

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Why so serious?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Joan, dear, I've got to tell you

speaker_heading: JOAN

speaker_heading: DAN

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: May I have a cigarette?
text: He reluctantly breaks eye contact with her and fishes out his cigarette case.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: You're incorrigible.
text: She takes a cigarette. He taps some ash off the end of his butt and lights
text: hers. As she exhales, they stare into one another's eyes for a long moment
dialog: and
text: then slowly draw in for a passionate kiss. After a moment, Dan lowers his

text: Sir Harold approaches, sees the coin, pauses, steps on it, looks around
text: smugly, then bends to pick it up. As he does, he exposes the wallet in his

scene_heading: EXT. THE MALOA - CONTINUOUS
text: On deck, Burke and Betty lean on the railing, watching the festivities. Both
text: suddenly spot Dan on the dock hauling Joan in his arms. Incredulous, Burke
text: feels in his pocket for the brig key, pulls it out and looks at it. Betty,
text: fully aware of what's happening, keeps a stone face.
text: Dan carries Joan up the gangplank which is festooned with streamers. The
text: doctor meets him and they hurry off to Joan's cabin.
text: Burke, grim, pockets the key and rushes off -- without a word to Betty who,
text: after a moment, follows him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE MALOA - CONTINUOUS
text: The doctor opens the cabin door for Dan who carries Joan inside and sets her
text: on the bed. The lively Hawaiian melody gives way to the more somber “Aloha
dialog: Oe"
text: as the doctor quickly examines her.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Is she all right, Doctor?
text: After a moment, the doctor looks at Dan and nods.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: I believe so.
text: Dan starts to withdraw. Joan looks like death warmed over. Dan takes a last
text: look and turns to go.
text: But Joan, without opening her eyes, regains consciousness and calls out to
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Dan ...
text: He pauses and reluctantly returns to the bed, leaning over her.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Yes, dear?
text: She can't open her eyes but somehow has the strength to put her arm around
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Dan ... Don't leave me ...
text: The ship's horn blows noisily. Dan looks around, realizing he can't get off
text: the ship. He strokes her hair and presses his cheek to hers gently. She
text: manages a smile.
text: The doctor, pleased at this, withdraws.
text: Dan pulls away from her, seeing that Joan has fallen unconscious again.
text: Burke brusquely enters the cabin but pauses at the sight of Dan at Joan's
text: bedside. Clearly, Dan isn't going anywhere. Joan's hand falls limp at her
text: side. Burke turns away thoughtfully and slowly exits, taking one last look at
text: the couple before quietly closing the cabin door behind him.
scene_heading: IN THE HALL
text: Burke fails to see Betty standing behind him as he shuts the door, turns and
text: talks to himself, sadly.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Poor guy.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: What did you say?
text: Startled, Burke turns to see Betty. He is immediately self-conscious.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Oh, I didn't say nothin'.
text: Betty watches as Burke, flustered, walks off. After a moment, she follows him
text: down the hall.
speaker_heading: IN THE CABIN
text: As Dan watches over an unconscious Joan, he notices an envelope on her night
text: stand: the farewell letter he had written to her early that morning.
dialog: Somewhere
text: off screen, a chorus of singers croons "Aloha Oe" as Dan takes the envelope
text: and pockets it.
speaker_heading: ON DECK
text: Streamers fly as a sour-faced Burke leans against the railing and watches the
text: crowd. A sympathetic Betty joins him and takes his hand affectionately. She
text: maintains her European accent even as she tells him:
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Ah, you're a swell guy, Steve.
text: She rests her head on his shoulder. Burke gives her a puzzled look, then
text: brightens a little and straightens up. The two look down to see:
scene_heading: THE GANGPLANK
text: being unhooked from the ship. A huge crowd of well-wishers fill the dock
text: waving to passengers on deck and singing "Aloha Oe." Bursting out of the
dialog: crowd
text: is Skippy, wearing a lei. He races up the streamer-clogged gangplank just as
text: it is pulled away and jumps onto the ship, well ahead of the two Hawaiian
text: policemen chasing him. Left stranded at the dock, they shake their fingers
dialog: and
text: yell for him to "Get out!" and "Don't come back!"
speaker_heading: ON DECK
text: Burke rushes away from an amused Betty to join Skippy at the gangplank
text: doorway. Skippy points to the policeman.
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: Don't forget to write now, will ya?
text: Skippy laughs his annoying laugh as a grim-looking Burke, hands in pockets,
text: strides into view behind him. Skippy turns to see Burke and stops in mid-
text: laugh. Smugly, Burke nods and gives Skippy a sneering smile.
speaker_heading: BURKE
text: The next stop, sucker, is San
dialog: Francisco.
text: Without a word, Skippy adjusts his jacket and wobbles off.
speaker_heading: THE SHIP
text: pulls away from the dock as the crowd waves and finishes singing "Aloha Oe."

speaker_heading: DAN

speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Oh, nothing's happened. I just want
dialog: to have a little talk with you.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: You're the only one that can help me.
dialog: (shakes his head sadly)
text: Her condition is desperate. She must
dialog: have absolute quiet and rest if
text: she's to reach the mainland alive.
dialog: She survived this attack but it
dialog: isn't humanly possible for her to
dialog: survive another. The slightest
text: excitement might kill her. A shock
dialog: surely would. Can I depend upon you?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Thank you. Now, try and get a
dialog: little more rest.
text: The doctor rises and heads for the door. Dan reaches a decision and climbs
dialog: out

speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Oh, Doctor.
text: Dan rises and the doctor rejoins him.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I've got to tell you this. There IS

dialog: to avoid it. When we reach San

speaker_heading: JOAN

speaker_heading: DAN

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: (chuckles)
dialog: You're beginning to even look like

text: We PAN FARTHER DOWN the deck to discover Sir Harold asleep and snoring

speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: Oh.
text: Betty closes the door behind Skippy and goes back to brushing her hair as he

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Shouldn't come here.
speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: Nobody saw me. I came to pay you

speaker_heading: BETTY

speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: Ah, sure. Copper-lover! Falling for

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Now, wait a minute. His racket!
dialog: son

speaker_heading: SKIPPY

speaker_heading: SKIPPY

speaker_heading: BARTENDER #3

speaker_heading: SKIPPY

speaker_heading: DAN AND JOAN

scene_heading: RADIO ROOM - THAT MOMENT

speaker_heading: RADIO OPERATOR

dialog: envelope for delivery.
speaker_heading: STEWARD
dialog: I've seen some royalty in my time
dialog: but I thought she was the grandest
dialog: of the lot. I hate to deliver it.
text: Amused, the radio operator hands the envelope to the steward who promptly
text: exits the radio room with it and heads off grimly down the deck.
scene_heading: BURKE AND BETTY
text: standing together at the rail.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: You know, I'm sort of tired of bein'
dialog: a copper.
text: Betty looks at him, puzzled.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Oh, I don't know. I - I just sort of
dialog: feel that I won't enjoy being the
dialog: Law any more, after what's happened.
dialog: And I was wondering if you'd be, well,
dialog: I sort of - I sort of thought that--
dialog: Well, anyway, I got a ranch half
dialog: paid for.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: A ranch?
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Sure. I got a chicken ranch in
dialog: Petaluma.
text: Betty is, of course, stunned. She reaches a decision.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Oh, I'd love it, Steven, but--
dialog: There's something I have to tell
dialog: you, first.
dialog: (drops her phony accent)
dialog: Aw, you're a right guy and I'm gonna
dialog: come clean with ya.
text: Now, it is Burke's turn to be stunned.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: In the first place, I'm not a
dialog: countess-—
text: Abruptly, the steward arrives and hands Burke the envelope.
speaker_heading: STEWARD
dialog: Beg your pardon, sir.
text: Betty turns away in embarrassment. Even as he stares at her, Burke accepts
dialog: the
text: envelope and waves off the steward who departs. Burke opens the message and
text: reads it. He looks up and squints at Betty, then crumples the message in his
dialog: fist.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: (darkly)
dialog: You were sayin'?
text: Betty turns back to him, bluntly.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I was sayin' I'm not any of the
dialog: things you think I am. I've been a
dialog: long way. And I've left a wide
dialog: trail.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: If it's your past, mine ain't been
text: no bed of violets.
text: Burke takes Betty's hand and smiles.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: What do you say we forget about it?
dialog: Let's start from scratch.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: You on the level, Steve?
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: On the level. What do you say ...
dialog: "Countess"?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Don't smear my bangs.
text: They kiss. Behind his back, Burke drops the crumpled telegram overboard.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SHIP'S LOUNGE - LATER
speaker_heading: DAN AND JOAN
text: Smiling into each other's eyes, they stand at the bar, holding drinks
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Remember our first?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: We thought it was our last. You
dialog: never can tell.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Four glorious weeks. So many happy
dialog: hours. And there's so many more,
dialog: too. Aren't there, Dan?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Of course, dear.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Mustn't miss one of them.

speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: We won't, dear.

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Where shall we dine tonight?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Does it matter?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Not as long as we're together but
dialog: ... it's fun to plan ahead. Let's
dialog: see. I'd like to ... to be in

speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: That's just a month, isn't it? Well,
dialog: then.
dialog: (a toast)
dialog: Here's to Agua Caliente, New Year's
dialog: Eve.
text: They are suddenly serious.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Nothing can keep me away.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Nor me.
text: They clink glasses gently and drink, never taking their eyes off one another.
text: They drain their glasses and break into smiles again. And they smash their
text: glasses on the side of the bar -- simultaneously.
text: THE BARTENDER, nearby, winces.
speaker_heading: DAN AND JOAN
text: cross the stems on the countertop.
text: THE BARTENDER, frustrated, snatches up two glasses in front of him and throws
text: them to the floor with a crash.
speaker_heading: BURKE
text: sits reading a magazine nearby. He looks up to see:
speaker_heading: DAN AND JOAN
text: exiting the lounge, arm in arm.
speaker_heading: BURKE
text: nods to Dan, making eye contact
speaker_heading: DAN
text: looks at Burke, knowing his time is up. Dan turns to Joan.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I'll finish packing and ... join
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: DAN AND JOAN

speaker_heading: JOAN

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DAN AND BURKE'S STATEROOM
text: Burke, holding the handcuffs, confers with Dan.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Sorry, Dan.
text: Dan peers down unhappily at the cuffs.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: You have to use those?
text: Behind the two men, the British steward appears in the doorway -- he
dialog: overhears:
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: I've got to deliver you according to
dialog: Hoyle. You know, this ain't any petty
dialog: larceny rap, it's murder.
text: The steward raises his eyebrows at the word "murder." He watches in amazement
text: as Dan pulls up his sleeve and Burke puts on the cuffs. Quickly, the steward
text: turns and walks off, unnoticed by either Burke or Dan.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: If we could get off the boat without
dialog: her seeing us--
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: I'll do my best.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Thanks. Let's go.
text: The two men head for the door. Dan picks up his overcoat and drapes it over
text: their arms, concealing the cuffs. He picks up his hat and pulls the cabin
dialog: door
text: open wide so that they may leave. After a pause, the men exit, with Dan
text: leading the way.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SHIP
speaker_heading: JOAN
text: stands in her cabin, looking unwell. She turns and exits into the hall. We
text: TRACK WITH her as she walks nervously along, glancing around for any sign of
text: Dan. She heads down a stairwell.
speaker_heading: DAN AND BURKE
text: arrive at a purser's station on their deck, preparing to check out.
speaker_heading: JOAN
text: descends the stairwell and arrives at Dan's door. She's just about to knock
text: when she hears the voice of the British steward coming from inside the room.
speaker_heading: STEWARD'S VOICE
dialog: You could have knocked me down with
text: a belaying pin. And then, as nice as
dialog: you please, he put the handcuffs on
dialog: him.
text: Joan, confused, knocks.
scene_heading: IN DAN AND BURKE'S STATEROOM
text: the steward turns from the maid he is speaking to and opens the door. Joan
text: enters and looks around in surprise.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Where's Mr. Hardesty?
speaker_heading: STEWARD
dialog: I was just telling her, Miss. Right
text: here, in front of my very eyes, his
dialog: friend, his best pal, as you might
text: rightly call him, takes out a pair
dialog: of handcuffs and -- snap, snap! --
text: and he's a prisoner. With their
text: hands at their side, out they goes.
text: Growing pale, Joan stares at the steward in disbelief.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Dan?
speaker_heading: STEWARD
dialog: The very same, Miss. And a nicer
dialog: gentleman you wouldn't wish to meet.
text: And him, a red-handed murderer. And
dialog: here's me, bobbin' in and out of
dialog: here, with no thought of me own life,
dialog: turning me back on him. Why, he
dialog: might have cut my throat from ear to
dialog: ear.
text: Before the steward can finish, Joan, breathing hard, staggers back to the
dialog: door
text: and leans in the doorway, eyes shut. After a moment, she opens her eyes in
text: horror, then desperately rushes back to the stairwell and rapidly climbs the
dialog: stairs.
speaker_heading: DAN AND BURKE
text: still at the purser's station. Dan glances around uncertainly.
speaker_heading: JOAN
text: having reached the top of the stairs, looks up and down the hall worriedly,
text: then we TRACK WITH her as she rushes in the direction of the deck.
speaker_heading: DAN AND BURKE
text: still at the purser's station.
scene_heading: TRACKING WITH JOAN
text: who struggles through the crowd of passengers, searching for Dan. But there's
text: no sign of him. She clutches a hand to her head, then presses forward through
dialog: the mob.
speaker_heading: DAN AND BURKE
text: still at the purser's station.
scene_heading: TRACKING WITH JOAN
text: through the crowded deck. She pauses and puts a hand to her head again. She
text: grows dizzy. The CAMERA MIRRORS her dizziness but she presses on,
dialog: disappearing
text: into the mob.
speaker_heading: DAN AND BURKE
text: finally depart the purser's station.
scene_heading: AT A STAIRWELL
text: The hallway is empty. Joan rushes into view and climbs the stairs. A brief
text: moment later, Dan and Burke emerge from the lower deck and head toward the
dialog: gangplank.
scene_heading: JOAN ON UPPER DECK
text: apparently lost. She ducks in a doorway.
speaker_heading: DAN AND BURKE
text: stuck in the line at the gangplank which has apparently not been hooked up
text: yet. They look around unhappily, unable to disembark right away.
speaker_heading: DAN
text: fails to see Joan appear several yards behind him.
speaker_heading: JOAN
text: sees Dan. She pauses, relieved.
speaker_heading: DAN
text: still hasn't noticed her.
speaker_heading: JOAN
text: raises a hand to him.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Dan!
speaker_heading: DAN
text: hears her but doesn't want to look in her direction. Finally, he does. We
dialog: hear
dialog: their theme.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Joan!
text: He puts out his free hand to her.
speaker_heading: JOAN
text: presses forward.
speaker_heading: DAN AND JOAN
text: hold hands and stand together.
speaker_heading: JOAN
text: peers into Dan's face, knowing she will never see him again. She smiles.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Goodbye, Dan.
speaker_heading: DAN
text: shakes his head, with a slight grin.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Not goodbye, dear. Auf wiedersehen.
dialog: Until New Year's Eve.
speaker_heading: JOAN
text: glows happily. In the background, we hear the gangplank.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Auf wiedersehen.
speaker_heading: DAN AND JOAN
text: kiss deeply. Passengers begin to file out behind them, down the gangplank.
text: They break the kiss.
speaker_heading: JOAN
text: watches, smiling, as Dan, too, retreats toward the gangplank.
speaker_heading: JOAN'S POV - DAN
text: Nearly lost in the crowd. He looks back at her over the top of the crowd and
text: waves, just as he had over the saloon's swinging doors way back in Hong Kong.
speaker_heading: JOAN
text: delighted, returns the wave.
speaker_heading: DAN AND BURKE
text: on the gangplank. Dan turns away from Joan. He and Burke descend. We TRACK
text: WITH them for a moment and then PAN BACK UP, past the other departing
dialog: passengers, to
speaker_heading: JOAN
text: who smiles and waves. She pauses, her hand in the air. A strange look crosses
text: her face. She stares into space for a long, long moment as the passengers
text: press forward all around her. Her eyes close. Her head tilts back. She leans
text: backward into a passenger behind her
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

dialog: upon which is printed:
speaker_heading: AGUA CALIENTE
scene_heading: HAPPY NEW YEAR
text: A crowd roars and hollers, "Happy New Year!"
text: A band plays a lively version of "Auld Lang Syne."
text: Someone sticks a cigarette in the balloon and we hear but do not see it
dialog: burst.
text: Instead, we CUT TO a fast TRACKING SHOT that runs parallel to a nightclub --
text: part of the Agua Caliente resort in Tijuana, Mexico. The place is packed with
text: well-dressed revelers: tuxedoes and evening gowns and party hats. Streamers
text: and balloons and noisemakers are everywhere. They dance, they drink, they sit
text: at tables and order food, they make merry.
text: We SWOOP PAST them all to the far end of the club which is nearly deserted.
text: Two bartenders stand together, polishing glasses at a bar. At one end of the
text: bar, a lone figure sits on a stool. We don't recognize him at first.
text: But then we abruptly leave our parallel track and RAPIDLY GLIDE IN and PAST
text: the man for a brief, seconds-long glimpse: it is Skippy as we have not seen
text: him before -- well-groomed in a black tux, nursing a drink but looking very
text: sober, lost in thought.
text: In a moment, he is gone and we catch a short view of the partying mob behind
text: him as we PAN OVER to the two bartenders, wiping their glasses nearby.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER #4
dialog: I'll be glad when this thing's over.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER #5
dialog: You're telling me? These holidays
dialog: are dynamite.
text: They hear the sound of glasses shattering.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER #4
dialog: Hey! Look out for them glasses with
dialog: your elbow!
speaker_heading: BARTENDER #5
dialog: (indignant)
dialog: I never touched any glasses.
text: Confused, the bartenders turn in the direction of the noise. We hear Dan and
text: Joan's theme as we PUSH FORWARD and between the bartenders to discover the
text: stems of two broken glasses crossed on the countertop, dancing couples
