dialog: No one knows where it came from.
dialog: There had been others. Mysterious
text: relics of another world. But only
dialog: one with the power to stop the
dialog: world.
dialog: 
text: SHKBOOM!!! The comet makes impact! A LEGO explosion!
text: We peer into the smoking crater. Fire amid blackness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Many vied for its dark magic. A
dialog: few brave souls endeavoured to
dialog: hide it from those who would use
dialog: it for ill. Until finally,
dialog: thankfully it was lost to history.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, we are blinded by a powerful TUNNEL OF LIGHT.
text: It's an animated LEGO version of the light tunnel in
text: 2001, which was directed by Stanley Kubrick, who knows a
dialog: thing or two about making movies, so don't step.
dialog: 
text: We push forwards, headed into a new world.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Ours is a story of a world that

dialog: 
text: REVEAL LEGO INDIANA JONES and two GUIDES. Indy puts up a
text: hand for them to stop. He removes a RUBY RED PIECE from
text: his bag and connects it to the temple. The piece GLOWS.
dialog: 
text: A dark passageway opens, and Indy lights a torch. The
text: flames are made of ANIMATED LEGO BRICKS. The guides are
dialog: too scared to continue. Indy's not.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. AWESOME TEMPLE - DUSK
dialog: 
text: A beautiful room made entirely of GOLDEN BRICKS. In the
text: center is a GOLDEN SARCOPHAGUS guarded by statues of gods
dialog: from every ancient civilization imaginable.
dialog: 
text: Indy carefully lifts a tablet from a statue of Zeus and
text: places it into the sarcophagus like an ATM card. He
text: pushes a bunch of cuneiform buttons - a PIN NUMBER.
dialog: 
text: The sarcophagus opens. A white-hot glow on Indy's face.
dialog: 
text: BLAM!!! The entire room shakes. The statues are blown
dialog: apart!
dialog: 
text: The smoke clears. Enter THE BLACK FALCON, the most evil
text: person in the universe. He's flanked by ROBOT guards.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: The Black Falcon. I should've
dialog: known.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: Hey Indy. Uch. Who built this
dialog: place? Must have been a bunch of
text: lazy hippies, sitting around a
text: table agreeing with each other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: It was built by the ancients.
dialog: With more wisdom and artistry than
dialog: you can ever know.
dialog: 
text: The Black Falcon basks in the glow of the sarcophagus.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: The Kragle...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: That belongs to the Maker. It

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: What a lame boyscout thing to say!
dialog: You're standing before the most
dialog: powerful object in the world and
dialog: you don't want to use it? You're a
dialog: real nerd, Indiana Jones.
dialog: 
text: The BF motions and his guards carry the sarcophagus away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: The MasterBuilders will learn of
dialog: this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: And what do you know of them?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Only that they will be your
text: undoing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: Adieu, Dr. Jones. That's French
dialog: for ciao.
dialog: 
text: He exits. As the sarcophagus crosses the threshold of
text: the temple, walls shake. The temple is CRUMBLING.
dialog: 
text: Left for dead, Indy uses the falling pieces to build
text: himself a sweet rocket ship and blasts out of the temple.
text: Narrowly avoiding a big rolling LEGO ball, probably.

dialog: GO! NOW!
dialog: 
text: CRASH! It's a full scale assault by hundreds of ROBOTS.
text: The MasterBuilders fight valiantly but are overwhelmed.

speaker_heading: EMMET (O.S.)

speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: What's the point of having my own
text: apartment across the hall from
dialog: your apartment if you're going to
dialog: check up on me like I still live
dialog: at home?
dialog: 
text: Emmet "pulls" on a pair of mini-fig legs. Replaces his
text: torso with a shirt. Takes off his hair and puts on a
text: construction hat. Ready for work. Doris is so proud.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: I just love you and want my son to
dialog: be safe and happy. Can't you work
dialog: from home? Like a sociopath or
dialog: children's book author?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Mom. I've spent my whole life
dialog: here. I need to go out there and

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET (V.O.)
dialog: It was the same as it always is.
dialog: Seared in my memory...
dialog: 
text: Everyone dutifully draws the same drawing of a hand, but
text: Emmet draws two hands close together so they look like
text: eyes. He draws a mouth and pupils. The teacher stops.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BAD ART TEACHER
dialog: Emmet. This wasn't the assignment.
dialog: You've got to learn to follow the
dialog: rules.
dialog: 
text: She holds up Emmet's drawing for all to see.

dialog: 
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: I hated that day. The kids were so
dialog: mean, the school tried to expel
dialog: you... I promised myself I'd never
dialog: let anything like that happen to
dialog: you again. And it hasn't. So you
dialog: need to let your memory of that
dialog: day go. It never happened.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: I just want to be normal, Mom.

speaker_heading: DORIS

scene_heading: EXT. LEGOPOLIS - DAY

speaker_heading: RADIO DJ
dialog: It's another beautiful day in

dialog: Gnus with their hit "Everything is
dialog: Awesome."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Yeah. I love this song! And so
dialog: does everyone else!
dialog: 
text: In what feels like a musical number, Emmet drives past
text: vignettes of citizens happily going about their day and
dialog: loving this song! BILLBOARDS everywhere advertise
text: EMPURA, a company which apparently owns everything.

scene_heading: EXT. ALTERNATIVE AVENUE - DAY

speaker_heading: EMMET

speaker_heading: BARRISTA

speaker_heading: BARRISTA
text: I push one of two buttons on a

scene_heading: EXT. ALTERNATIVE AVENUE - DAY

dialog: 
text: Emmet finishes the drive to work. Everyone pulls into

speaker_heading: FOREMAN

speaker_heading: FOREMAN

scene_heading: EXT. INSTRUCTION SITE - LATER
dialog: 
text: Emmet puts his hands on the controls, savoring this

scene_heading: EXT. INSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

dialog: Everyone knows you're not allowed
dialog: to go Out of Town. It's dangerous,
dialog: uncharted and no one should ever go
dialog: that's what everybody says. Can't
dialog: we just explain the situation to
dialog: President Iamnotarobot?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Iamnotarobot is one of the Black
text: Falcon's robot henchmen. Ever
dialog: notice how metallic he looks?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Come on. He's just very fair
dialog: skinned. It says "Iamnotarobot"
dialog: in his very name! Besides, he's
dialog: way better than Councilman
dialog: Strawman. That guy is the pits.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Don't be naïve.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: What's naïve?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: That.
dialog: 
text: She steps across the line. Emmet GASPS for a long time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Look, just give me the MasterPiece
dialog: and I'll take it from here.
dialog: 33.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: My mom gave it to me and I'm not
dialog: giving it to anyone unless their
dialog: name is My Mom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Well then I guess you're going to
dialog: have to cross that line.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Well then I guess I am.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Well then go ahead and do it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Well then go ahead and do it I
dialog: shall.
dialog: 
text: Beat. We can hear the cops and their DOGS BARKING.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Dude!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Okay, okay.
dialog: 
text: Emmet deliberately and meaningfully, in super slow
text: motion, crosses the line. He EXHALES DRAMATICALLY. Takes
text: another step. Then another, then-- SLAM!
dialog: 
text: Emmet has walked straight into an INVISIBLE WALL! Camera
text: COMES AROUND revealing a trompe l'oeil painting on bricks
text: that go up as far as the eye can see.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Not everything is what it seems...
dialog: 
text: Lucy reveals an odd-shaped DEPRESSION in the wall. She
text: takes apart a nearby VENDING MACHINE and rearranges the
text: pieces into the shape of the depression, puts it in,
text: filling the negative space...and it opens a door. Lucy
text: pulls Emmet into the door and into...
dialog: 
text: A TUNNEL OF LIGHT - just like at the beginning of the
text: movie. It seems peaceful, until we see that Emmet and
text: Lucy are hurtling towards a monolithic wall. They BLAST
dialog: THROUGH IT and into...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LEGOPIA
dialog: 
text: A beautiful, breathtaking place that looks like LEGO New
dialog: Zealand. It's beautiful. Until...
dialog: 34.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Lucy and Emmet crash land into a bunch of HOBBIT HOUSES.
text: They get out of the ship and look around. They see a lot
text: of hobbits yelling at them for destroying their shire.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Who are those guys?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Annoying short whiners. Plus they
dialog: reproduce like crazy. It's a real
dialog: problem.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Where are we? Where are all the
dialog: buildings? And coffee shops?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Legopolis is only one realm in the
text: Black Falcon's dominion. He built
text: walls around all of them so he can
dialog: keep them separate. If the walls
dialog: came down, he'd have a hard time
dialog: controlling the results. The
dialog: MasterBuilders built secret
dialog: passages through the walls so we
dialog: could travel between lands.
dialog: 
text: A SCARY NOISE. The Hobbits scurry into their houses.
text: Emmet and Lucy get down just before an army of robots
text: riding robo-horses marches by.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Who are they?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
text: The Black Falcon's sentries.
dialog: They're looking for us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: So he controls all these worlds?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Shh!

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: Doris! Did someone get you a
dialog: water?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: You'll never get away with this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: "You'll never get away with this!"
dialog: What a cliché! You don't even know
dialog: what it is I'm trying to get away
dialog: with. Maybe you should listen
dialog: more.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: I'm all ears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: Truly? Because listening and
dialog: hearing are not the same thing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: I'm listening.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: Excellent.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: Behold, the Kragle!
dialog: 
text: Doris GASPS as BF unveils the sarcophagus we saw earlier.
text: A Robot Ninja opens it. Inside is a TUBE OF KRAZY GLUE
text: with some of the letters rubbed off to spell "KRA__GL_E."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: The car in the city. That's why
dialog: it didn't break...
dialog: 36.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: Very good. But there's a lot more
dialog: to my plan than that. Check it:
dialog: 
text: Black Falcon saunters over to a STAGE SET, with a life-
text: sized DIORAMA with living minifigs playing out a
text: residential tableau.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: Here is your typical family. You
dialog: there. Move your arm a little
dialog: higher. A little higher... NO NO
dialog: NO that's too high!!! Ugh you are
dialog: all PATHETIC LOSERS!
dialog: 
text: The Dad puts his arm down slightly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: Perfect! Wonderful. Don't move an
dialog: inch. You see how hard it is for
dialog: me? I have to make all these plans
dialog: and rules and enforce them on
dialog: people. It's whack-a-mole. I get
dialog: one thing perfect, and then
dialog: another thing gets messed up. Ay
dialog: ay ay I get so tired!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: You never did understand the way
dialog: of the Maker.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: Sure I do. There's one right way
dialog: to do everything, and I know it,
dialog: and everyone else is wrong and is
dialog: trying to screw me up! Until now.
dialog: 
text: Some NinjaVikings lower the Kragle into a cool looking
text: KRAGLE CANNON, operated by a ninjaviking in a helmet.
text: The cannon whirs to life, directed at the diorama.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: You. Introduce yourselves to me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: "DAD"
dialog: I'm sorry?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: Like, you say to me "Hello Black
dialog: Falcon, I'm Dale, and this is my
dialog: wife Mary and our children Mark
dialog: and Lisa."
dialog: 37.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: "DAD"
dialog: But you just said it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: Well, just-- you say it now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: "DAD"
dialog: Hello Black Falcon, I'm Dale, this
speaker_heading: IS MARY--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: My wife Mary.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: "DAD"
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: My wife, Mary.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: And our children...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: "DAD"
dialog: And our kids--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: Children.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: "DAD"
dialog: And our children Mark and Lisa.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: All together now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: "DAD"
dialog: &lt; SIGH &gt; Hello Black Falcon I'm
dialog: Dale, this is my wife Mary and our
dialog: children Mark and Lisa.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: Well, hello, Dale, Mary, Mark and
dialog: Lisa. I'm Black Falcon, and I'm
dialog: very FREEZE TO MEET YOU!
dialog: 
text: He points to the operator, who pulls a lever on the
text: Cannon, which ZAPS them with KRAZY GLUE, freezing them!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: Exactly how I planned! BAHAHAHA!
dialog: And it's totally permanent!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: You want to do this to the whole
dialog: world?
dialog: 38.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: So the whole world will be exactly
dialog: how I want.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: But-- I'll never see my son again.
dialog: No mother will ever see her son.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: Unless they're frozen when they
dialog: happen to be looking at each
dialog: other, exactly. Oh Doris, I'm so
dialog: glad we could finally meet again,
dialog: after all these years.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: What do you want from me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: Isn't it obvious? I want you to
dialog: make me a better Kragle-Thingy!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: That's really dumb.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: I mean this works okay, but it
text: doesn't have a wide enough spray.
dialog: I need to make like a big cloud of
dialog: sticky mist. And it's not scary
dialog: enough. And I hate the color.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: You'll never get aw-- You'll not
dialog: achieve that which you have just
dialog: described!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: What, do you think your pathetic
dialog: son is going to save you or
dialog: something? He can't even put two
dialog: bricks together.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIS
speaker_heading: (LYING)
dialog: I've trained him. Secretly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: Did you? I think you protected
dialog: him. Because you were afraid to
dialog: have him live under the spectre of
text: being found out. Of being hunted.
dialog: You wanted him to fit in. To feel
dialog: normal, isn't that right?
dialog: 39.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Doris can't look at him. BF shows her a poster with a
text: goofy image of Emmet. "Wanted: Broken or Together."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: Big mistake, Doris. Thanks to
dialog: that call, he's going to get his
dialog: butt kicked. He'll fit in,
dialog: alright. Into a coffin!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Leave him out of this!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: I would, but I'm pretty sure he
dialog: has the MasterPiece. It wasn't in
dialog: your apartment, and it's not on
dialog: you. But your son seems to have
text: interesting taste in handbags.
dialog: 
text: He grabs a LEGO MAGNIFYING GLASS from his desk and shows
text: Doris the out-of-focus PURSE Emmet's holding in the
dialog: Wanted photo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: So, just to tie up all the loose
dialog: ends, I'll have to kill him and
dialog: take the MasterPiece so the
dialog: prophecy will never come true.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: No! Don't, please! I'll do what
dialog: you want, please don't hurt him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: Oh, don't worry, dear. You'll do
dialog: what I want regardless. I'll
dialog: simply use my very special
dialog: electromagnetic machine to extract
dialog: your thoughts and steal your ideas
dialog: like I've done for all the other
dialog: imprisoned MasterBuilders.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: No!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: Yes. Send her to the THINK TANK!!!
dialog: 
text: As Doris struggles, the guards take her away.
dialog: 40.

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LEGOPIA - DAY
dialog: 
text: They come upon a majestic canyon with an immense LEGO
text: waterfall (clear pieces tumbling down). Lucy climbs up
text: the rock wall. Emmet follows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Is it much farther?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Do you ever say something that
dialog: isn't a stupid question?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: What's that supposed to mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I guess not.
dialog: 
text: Two-thirds up the canyon wall is a ledge with a cave
text: behind the waterfall. And a sign. "Beware of Dragon."
dialog: Gulp.
dialog: 
text: YAPYAPYAP! DRAGON, a nasty yippy DOG startles them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: That's Dragon.
dialog: 
text: Lucy knocks on the door of a garishly painted SHACK.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Who could live here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
text: A blind man.
dialog: 
text: A homeless-looking man opens the door, facing the wrong
text: direction. This is VITRUVIUS, Ben Kenobi meets Mr. Magoo
text: meets Gandalf meets Columbo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS
dialog: Hello! What? Hi!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: I see.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE UGLIEST HOUSE IN THE UNIVERSE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Looks like it was decorated by a blind man. And it was.
text: Vitruvius opens the shades, revealing a window view of a
dialog: rock wall.
dialog: 41.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Lovely place.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS
dialog: Thank you. I am deprived of my
dialog: sight, but my hearing is so acute
dialog: that I can still perceive the
text: physical world using echolocation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Like an old bat...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS
text: Precisely. I see with my ears.
dialog: Now, how can I help you, extremely
dialog: tall and fat stranger?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: My mother has been kidnapped and
dialog: it's all my fault.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS
dialog: Mmm...Hard pass. Not interested.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: His mother is the Chosen One. I
text: was sent to summon her. The Black
dialog: Falcon got to her first. He has
dialog: the Kragle.
dialog: 
text: Vitruvius stops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS
dialog: Oh my. That is grave news indeed.
dialog: But I'm afraid I'm retired. I'm
dialog: sure the active MasterBuilders are
dialog: more than adequate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
text: The other MasterBuilders are gone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS
dialog: I guess I'm not redundant anymore.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Why is he being so weird?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS
dialog: The Black Falcon was my student.
dialog: 
text: PUSH IN ON VITRUVIUS.
dialog: 
text: A STYLIZED 2D LEGO FLASHBACK tells his story:
dialog: 42.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS (V.O.)
dialog: He was clever and smart. It was
dialog: the age of the MasterBuilders. The
dialog: world was a fluid, creative place.
dialog: The most gifted were enrolled in
dialog: MasterBuilder High School...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEEN DORIS
dialog: Hey Rod. What's that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEEN BLACK FALCON
dialog: An awesome secret lair, b'doy!
dialog: It's the best thing I've ever
dialog: built. It's perfect. All I need
dialog: now is a cool nickname.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS (V.O.)
dialog: I only aimed to teach him a lesson
dialog: about the impermanence of creation.
dialog: 
text: LESS OLD VITRUVIUS pulls out a cornerstone brick in the
text: lair and the whole thing topples over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEEN BLACK FALCON
dialog: No! My precious precious work!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESS OLD VITRUVIUS
text: Building is rebuilding, Rodrigo.
dialog: You must learn to embrace the
dialog: practice, not the outcome.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEEN BLACK FALCON
dialog: What a bunch of bunk! That thing
dialog: was AWESOME!
dialog: 
text: We see his animated metamorphosis from teen to the Black
dialog: Falcon of today.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS (V.O.)
text: He became enraged. Instead of
dialog: improving his work, it became
text: stagnant and weak. He began to
dialog: amass power, and hunt down
dialog: MasterBuilders. Harvesting their
dialog: ideas. Forcing them to write
dialog: instructions for him. Instructions
dialog: that he in turn forced on the
dialog: world. The remaining
text: MasterBuilders went into hiding.
dialog: I was encouraged to retire.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: END FLASHBACK
dialog: 43.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS
dialog: They were probably right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: You taught my parents...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS
dialog: Your mother went into hiding to
dialog: protect you. Your father never had
dialog: a chance...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Vitruvius, you can still help us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS
dialog: That's flattery, my dear. We both
dialog: know you're only here because you
dialog: have no other place to go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: We're here because we don't know
dialog: what to do and you might. Sir, all
dialog: I've ever wanted was to get along
dialog: with everyone and be a part of the
dialog: world and now I don't know if
dialog: there's going to be a world to be
dialog: a part of. That is, unless you
dialog: help me fix it. And I bet if you
dialog: do, they'll forget all about what
dialog: they used to think of you.
dialog: 
text: This gets Vitruvius' attention.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS
dialog: I wish I could, young man, but he
dialog: has the Kragle, and he has the
dialog: Chosen One, and if he has the
dialog: Chosen One, he has the MasterPiece.
dialog: And without that, there is no--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Hope?
dialog: 
text: Lucy holds out the MasterPiece. This changes the game.
text: Vitruvius walks reverently towards it. Then past it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UGLIEST HOUSE IN THE UNIVERSE - LATER
dialog: 
text: Vitruvius has created a chart to explain his plan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS
dialog: The Kragle is the most powerful
dialog: relic of the Maker.
dialog: 44.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Who is this Maker you guys keep
dialog: talking about?
dialog: 
text: Emmet and Lucy sit at a "table." AKA a pink ERASER.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS
dialog: The Maker. The being who put us
text: all together and watches over us.
dialog: Only by following the inspiration
dialog: of the Maker can one become a true
dialog: MasterBuilder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Okay that sounds super weird.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS
dialog: It is, but then all the best
dialog: things are.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: And what's the Kragle again?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS
dialog: Every so often, the Maker drops a
dialog: piece down to us that is unique,
dialog: unlike any other. This crystal
dialog: table is but one example. Some of
dialog: them, in the wrong hands, can be
text: weaponized. The Kragle, if
dialog: harnessed, could--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: --destroy the world?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS
dialog: Yes. The Black Falcon has taken
dialog: your mother, the one person who
text: can stop him, and imprisoned her.
dialog: 
text: He gestures to a map. For once it's what he says it is,
text: but as he's talking, he points to the wrong places.
text: Lucky for us, the camera follows the map correctly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS
dialog: If we can travel across sea and
dialog: land, penetrate his heavily-
dialog: guarded fortress, unkidnap Master
dialog: Doris, and bring the MasterPiece
dialog: safely to her, she can use it to
dialog: destroy the Kragle, and set the
dialog: world right.
dialog: 45.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Oh is that all we have to do? That
dialog: doesn't sound too hard. Oh wait, I
dialog: forgot to mention, I am saying
text: this with a sarcastic inflection.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: That's super constructive, thank
dialog: you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS
dialog: We need to assemble a team of all
dialog: remaining MasterBuilders hiding
dialog: throughout the lands. We'll scour
text: the countryside high and low,
text: overturning rocks, hiding from
text: sentries, avoiding the major roads
dialog: and air..
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: We don't have that kind of time!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS
dialog: Or we could send out a mass email
dialog: to the MasterBuilders list, and
dialog: have whichever ones are remaining
dialog: meet us at the midpoint.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Better.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS
dialog: And then, we sail for the Land of
dialog: Unused Parts!
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: Anybody got a ship?
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PUERTOPIECEO - DAY
dialog: 
text: A bustling colonial-era port, but with every possible
dialog: kind of ship, from aircraft carrier to canoe. Emmet,
text: Lucy, Vitruvius, and Dragon sneak down a DOCK disguised
text: as FISHERMEN. Dragon is disguised as a FISH.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: How long has your boyfriend had
dialog: his own ship?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Why do you care?
dialog: 46.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: I just think it's interesting that
dialog: you're attracted to someone with
dialog: his own vessel. Fairly superficial
text: to date a guy with his own yacht.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: It's not exactly a yacht.
dialog: 
text: They come upon a really cool PIRATE SHIP. NECKBEARD, a
text: pirate, sticks his head through a porthole in the ship.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NECKBEARD
dialog: Ahoy! Welcome to the Sea Cow!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Huh. Not what I expected.
dialog: 
text: Neckbeard hops out onto the dock, revealing he HAS NO
text: BODY. He's just a head. And a beard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Really not what I expected.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NECKBEARD
dialog: Arr! Come give your weary
dialog: boyfriend a kiss!
dialog: 
dialog: She does.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Wow.
dialog: 
text: Neckbeard and Lucy begin MAKING OUT.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Okay. That's-- okay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Gosh, where are my manners?
dialog: Emmet, this is Neckbeard, my
dialog: boyfriend. Neckbeard, this is
dialog: Emmet. We used to date a million
dialog: zillion years ago. It meant
dialog: nothing to me. You have heard of
dialog: Vitruvius, of course.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NECKBEARD
dialog: You're the teacher that made the
dialog: Black Falcon who he is, then?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS
dialog: That was a long time ago.
dialog: 47.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NECKBEARD
dialog: Farrr be it for a pirate to judge
text: a man with an unsavory reputation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: That's surprisingly gracious--
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, Neckbeard somehow gets up in Emmet's grill.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NECKBEARD
dialog: Stay away from me lady.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Alright. Sure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NECKBEARD
dialog: Say that to my face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Alright. Sure.
dialog: 
text: He gets somehow closer to Emmet. Mouths almost touching.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NECKBEARD
dialog: I was once the most feared
dialog: MasterBuilder in all the lands. I
dialog: lost the rest of me body fighting
dialog: off a hundred of the Black Falcon's
dialog: men. You cross me, and I'll make it
dialog: an even fight, if you follow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Thank you for your clarity.
dialog: 
text: Neckbeard slowly hops back past, eyeing Emmet the whole
text: time. Emmet looks to Lucy: "How can you be with him?"
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: He has an incredible mind.
dialog:

speaker_heading: EMMET

speaker_heading: EMMET

speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: What's it for?
dialog: 49.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS
dialog: What is anything for? It's what
dialog: we were all meant to do. What the
dialog: Maker has fated us to do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Okay, here's what I don't get. If
dialog: our lives really are predetermined

dialog: 
text: Vitruvius punches Emmet in the face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: OW! Why did you do that?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS
dialog: The Maker fated me to.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Or you did it yourself because
dialog: you're a crazy person.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS
dialog: Ah. Now, you're learning.
dialog: 
text: Emmet stares at him for a minute, confused. Then he looks

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: I could just never make something
dialog: like that. How did you even get
dialog: the idea?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS
dialog: I didn't. I just opened a window

dialog: 
text: Emmet pets the mechabird with a real sense of wonder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS
dialog: Birds are, incidentally, one of

speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: No. Teach me to do what you do.
dialog: 
text: Vitruvius smiles. But it's bittersweet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS
dialog: How can I teach you something you
dialog: already know? It's already inside

text: still shines through. That

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: MakerPeepers?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS
dialog: MakerPeepers. Emmet, there was a
dialog: time, before you were born, when
dialog: making new things came as
dialog: naturally to everyone as
dialog: breathing. The world was messy and
dialog: wild, and that made it beautiful.
dialog: But then, everything became rigid
dialog: and prefabricated, so everyone
dialog: just stopped thinking of new
dialog: things. Making has been outsourced
text: to Empura. The Black Falcon has
dialog: paved over the world that was.
dialog: 
text: Vitruvius indicates the sky.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS

speaker_heading: EMMET

speaker_heading: LUCY

speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Freeze!
dialog: 
text: REVEAL Bad Cop and his men! Guns trained.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BAD COP
dialog: Or didn't you know that as a
dialog: former student of MasterBuilder
dialog: academy, the Black Falcon was cc'd
dialog: on your mass email?
dialog: 
text: He takes the MasterPiece and cuffs everyone else. Behind
text: the cops and vikings stands a sheepish King Karl.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KING KARL
dialog: I'm sorry, I had to let them in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: King Karl! You betrayed us! You
dialog: betrayed everything you stand for!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KING KARL
dialog: Tsk, I know. Turns out Legotopia
text: had run up like a bunch of debt.
dialog: Something about lots of spending
dialog: and no revenue. Empura promised
dialog: to fund the whole place.
dialog: Honestly, I'm super sorry.
dialog: 
text: They all struggle but the Ninjavikes are too much.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET

dialog: 64.
dialog:

speaker_heading: KING KARL

speaker_heading: KING KARL
dialog: Where are you taking them? Not to
dialog: the dungeon, right? You said--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BAD COP
dialog: Do I look like a medieval

speaker_heading: ASSISTANT (O.S.)
dialog: I have the Black Falcon for you...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BAD COP

dialog: 
text: He turns on a TELECONFERENCING DEVICE. It doesn't work

dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BLACK FALCON (O.C.)
dialog: Well, well, well. Looks like I
dialog: have you right-- All I'm seeing
dialog: is a wall. Should I turn it? You
dialog: turn it. Turn it around. Is this
dialog: the volume? WELL WHICH ONE IS THE
dialog: VOLUME? IT'S NOT WORKING!
dialog: OH THERE IT GOES! Can you
dialog: hear me? How about now? How about now? How
dialog: 
dialog: NOW?
speaker_heading: ABOUT
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 65.
dialog:

speaker_heading: BAD COP
dialog: No, the other way. There. That's
dialog: close enough.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BLACK FALCON
dialog: Oh I see you! I see your hand.
dialog: Wave your hand. Ha ha! This is
dialog: amazing! Do you hear a weird echo
dialog: on your end? I can hear myself but
text: like two seconds later. Echo.
dialog: Echo. This is my voiceeeeeoooooo
dialog: aaaaayyyyyyyeeeeeeeeeee...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BAD COP
dialog: Sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BLACK FALCON

speaker_heading: LUCY

speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS

speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Sure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BLACK FALCON

speaker_heading: THE BLACK FALCON

dialog: 66.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He pushes a button, switching cameras to Doris, who is

speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Emmet!

speaker_heading: EMMET

dialog: now a distinguished member of my

dialog: 
text: Reveal the THINK TANK - an enormous aquarium of
text: MasterBuilders hooked up to brain squeezers which suck
text: the ideas right out of their heads. Including Doris.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BLACK FALCON
dialog: Every MasterBuilder in the world
dialog: is in this tank, having their
dialog: ideas extracted. Now, with the
dialog: ideas of the Chosen One, I can
dialog: finally build the best
dialog: Kraglethingy in the world, freeze
dialog: everything, and make the universe
dialog: exactly how I like it forever.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Mom! No!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BLACK FALCON
dialog: There's nothing you can do, dude.
dialog: I already have the ideas. My
dialog: builders are putting the finishing
dialog: touches right now. What are you
dialog: going to show up here in the next
dialog: twenty four hours and stop me?
dialog: You just gave me the only hope you
dialog: had! You see this?
dialog: 
text: He gestures to a mini-model of all his lands. It takes
text: up substantial floor space.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: These are all the lands I control!
dialog: They are perfect! And they are
dialog: going to be that way forever! Now
dialog: that you can't mess any of them
dialog: up! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
dialog: 67.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: So wait. What was the purpose of

scene_heading: INT. KRAZY KASTLE PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
dialog: Bad Cop and his support team are marching our guys
text: through an underground parking lot. They open a door to
dialog: a squad car, but guess who's inside? King Karl!
dialog: 
text: He kicks open the door and smashes Bad Cop's hand in it.
text: He does some creative building and kicks everyone's
text: butts. He frees our heroes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: You're a MasterBuilder, too?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KING KARL
dialog: I dabble. You were right. I'd

dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Cannonballs and flames emerge from the bad guy's weapons,
dialog: and from the good guys: Puppies. And flowers. Anything
text: but an effective ballistic.
dialog: 
text: And it's a MASSACRE. The fruity forces of King Karl are
text: just no match. Their vehicles don't drive. The bows and
text: arrows shoot in curly cues. They are just impossibly
text: overmatched. It's an instant rout.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KING KARL
dialog: Retreat!
dialog: 
text: Chaos invades the kingdom. Our heroes scramble to find a

speaker_heading: KING KARL
dialog: You have to go.

speaker_heading: EMMET

speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: Everyone get in my spaceship!
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: Beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Over there!
dialog: 
text: He points to a huge CATAPULT. They all grab pieces of

text: catapult and jump inside of it.
dialog: 
text: They watch as King Karl tries to trip up Bad Cop, but

text: along with all the remains of Benny's spaceship.
dialog: 
text: IN MID AIR all the MasterBuilders mind-meld and
text: quickbuild a ROCKET-COPTER around themselves with the
text: remains of the spaceship. Emmet actually helps. He may

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: I built that chair! Check it out.
dialog: That's my chair. Pretty good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: That's far more impressive than

speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Can't sleep. Kind of still upset

speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Upset about what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Well, I got in a fight with my mom

speaker_heading: LUCY

speaker_heading: EMMET

speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: You may not have a creative bone

dialog: of really really earnest bones.
dialog: You always did.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Thank you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I mean, that day when we were
dialog: kids, and you drew the face in art
dialog: class, you inspired me. I thought
dialog: maybe there was more out there in
dialog: the world, and maybe you felt the
dialog: same. That's why I asked you out.
dialog: But then you ended up like
dialog: everyone else and broke my heart,
dialog: you know? That I was going one way
dialog: and you didn't go with me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Think of how I felt. My mom
dialog: trained me to follow the herd. To
dialog: lay low. All I ever wanted was to
dialog: fit in, to have friends. And the
dialog: funny thing is, maybe I was trying
dialog: too hard, but, my whole life, I
dialog: never did have any real friends.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: We're being so dramatic. It was
dialog: eighth grade!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: That's the most dramatic time in

speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: It's... beautiful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I know. It's a relic of the Maker.

speaker_heading: EMMET

speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS

dialog: What about a passkey, you ask? We

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET (V.O.)
dialog: We get a bunch of snacks and a
text: conference room filled with toys
dialog: and funny posters, and discuss the
dialog: plan in a group. We'll have rules
dialog: of play, such as 'Yes and,' not
dialog: `No, but' so we can keep criticism
dialog: constructive and keep the process
text: moving forward, and slowly over
dialog: many iterations of the process
dialog: we'll add the best thoughts from

scene_heading: EXT. EMPURA TOWER, SERVICE ENTRACE - LATER
dialog:

text: one guard back there, talking on his phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SERVICE NINJA
dialog: Well, I don't know, I've lived
dialog: alone a long time, and sharing
dialog: space with you is a new thing for

speaker_heading: (REALIZING)
dialog: Hey, we didn't order any--
dialog: 
text: Lucy appears behind him, grabs him and GAGS him.

speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: (man voice, into phone)
dialog: I love you please move in with me.
dialog: 
text: Our gang quickbuilds the truck into an awesome TOWER
text: CLIMBING DEVICE with suction cups. It begins its climb.
dialog: 
text: INSIDE the device, our guys rapidly move bricks so that
text: the side facing the building is an 8-bit image of the
text: landscape behind it, making it nearly invisible.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. EMPURA TOWER - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Some skeletons are in a board meeting. One looks outside

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. EMPURA TOWER - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: My office is bigger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Emmet.
dialog: 
text: She motions to an "IDEAS" notebook. There is nothing in
text: there. There's also a picture of the BF's middle school
text: class photo with Doris in it. The BF has drawn a funny
text: moustache on her. Emmet smashes the picture in anger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NECKBEARD
dialog: Arr, his appointment book be
dialog: saying he be scheduled for a
dialog: massage at four.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: He'll get a flipping massage

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Language! There are kids here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Who are these nerds?
dialog: 
text: It's the diorama family from earlier. Still frozen. The

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SON
dialog: We, uh, can't move.
dialog: 
text: Lucy tries to lift the daughter but she's stuck to her

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Well, yeah, we can't be together.
dialog: We can't touch or see each other.
dialog: But in here-- and if I could, I'd
dialog: be pointing to my head-- I'm not
dialog: stuck. In my brain we're sharing
text: a delicious meal together.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Thank you sweetie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAUGHTER
dialog: Pass the mustard.
dialog: 
text: They all play along.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: That's pretty elaborate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: They can freeze you. They can tell
dialog: you what to do. But they can't
dialog: stop our secret weapon. Ideas.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: Now go give `em hell.
dialog: 
text: Lucy starts to exit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Wait. Batman, give me your
text: Batperiscope.
dialog: 
text: Emmet grabs some nearby tubes and goes to work. He's not

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BLACK FALCON'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Emmet places a FOUR-WAY PERISCOPE in front of their

speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Now at least you can see each

dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - LATER
dialog: 
text: The Black Falcon stomps down the hallway. People tremble
text: in his wake. A flank of baddies stops and salutes.
dialog: 
dialog: "THE BLACK FALCON"
dialog: You there. Listen to me.
dialog: 
dialog: REVEAL it's not the The Black Falcon at all, but rather,
text: Neckbeard's head on top of a black-Sharpied R2D2.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINJA
dialog: You have grown a beard.
dialog: 
dialog: "THE BLACK FALCON"
dialog: I be trying it out. What do ye

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINJA
dialog: It's very nice.
dialog: 
dialog: "THE BLACK FALCON"
dialog: Thank you. Arr.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINJA
dialog: Is there something in your throat,
dialog: sir?
dialog: 
dialog: "THE BLACK FALCON"
dialog: Yes. It be a new throat something
dialog: I'm trying out. Do ye like it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINJA
dialog: Very much.
dialog: 
dialog: "THE BLACK FALCON"
dialog: Say, I beed wondering if you could
dialog: do me a favor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINJA
dialog: At your service, commander.
dialog: 
dialog: "THE BLACK FALCON"
dialog: Take off your ninja clothes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINJA
dialog: Sir?
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINJA
dialog: Yes, sir.
dialog: 
text: They do as instructed. Into their skivvies.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINJA
dialog: Yes, sir-- ow!
dialog: 
dialog: "THE BLACK FALCON"
dialog: Very good. Now count to one

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINJA (O.S.)
dialog: (in the distance)
dialog: Yes sir.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly our heroes jump out from the shadows and put on

dialog: 
dialog: "THE BLACK FALCON"
dialog: This be awesome.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THINK TANK - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Guards hear the door open and stand at attention. In
text: walk NECKBEARD and the GANG, all dressed up as ninjas.
dialog: 
text: They stare up at the THINK TANK. All kinds of
dialog: MasterBuilders hooked up to tubes. Awful. You can't
text: help but be upset at the inhumanity of the whole thing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBOSKELETON
dialog: Black Falcon? You're supposed to
dialog: be at your massage.
dialog: 
dialog: "THE BLACK FALCON"
dialog: I uh...
dialog: 
text: Neckbeard's head falls off R2D2. FIGHT! Our guys kick
text: the crap out of the guards, who try and fail to sound an
text: alarm. It's a bar brawl, and Batman really shines.
dialog: 
text: Emmet rushes up into the Think Tank and finds his MOM.
text: Everything else slows down. The sounds of the fighting
dialog: fall away. He's so glad to see her. Wouldn't you be?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Mom...
dialog: 84.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: What? Emmet?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: It's me, Mom. I've here to save
dialog: you, so you can save the world.
dialog: 
text: He pulls out the MASTERPIECE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON (O.S.)
dialog: I don't think she'll be doing
dialog: that.
dialog: 
text: The Black Falcon has entered, flanked by Bad Cop and a
dialog: legion of robo-soldiers!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VITRUVIUS
dialog: Rodrigo Falcone. My old student.
dialog: It's time you went back to SCHOOL!
speaker_heading: (TO OTHERS)
dialog: RUN!
dialog: 
text: Our heroes make a break for the exit, as Vitruvius
text: squares off with the Black Falcon. Vitruvius spins, grabs
text: some pieces of the Think Tank and uses his staff to guide
text: an ELECTRICAL BOLT at him. The Black Falcon deflects.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: The old dog still has a few
dialog: tricks. But I guess your friends
dialog: didn't tell you that I was flanked
dialog: by like a hundred soldiers. Now!
dialog: 
text: RoboNinjas fling a RUBBER BAND from a PAPERCLIP (like
text: when they got Doris in Act I) and it binds him instantly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK FALCON
dialog: Get the rest of them!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. EMPURA TOWER, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
dialog: Our heroes book it. Emmet helps Doris.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Why won't anything in this hallway

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: It's Kragle-frozen! Batcrap!

speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Yes?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NECKBEARD
dialog: I want you to know, I love you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Me too...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NECKBEARD
dialog: And even if the world be ending,
dialog: and we all get frozen, I'd feel
dialog: better about the whole situation
dialog: if I could get frozen with you as
dialog: my bride.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Are you really doing this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NECKBEARD
dialog: Lucy. Will you take me hand in
dialog: marriage? Metaphorically.
dialog: 
text: Lucy stops, frozen...with INDECISION! She looks at
text: Emmet. Emmet smiles bravely at her as he runs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Um...
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Lucy's indecision made her fall behind and a RUBBER BAND
text: flings and wraps her up! Neckbeard tries to change
text: direction but winds up rolling down the hall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NECKBEARD
dialog: Lucy!
dialog: 
dialog: Bad Cop et al reload.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Mom! Hurry!
dialog: 
text: Fling! Doris is wrapped up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: No!
dialog: 
text: Fling! Emmet is wrapped up, with the MasterPiece still in
text: his hands.
dialog: 86.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: No!
dialog: 
text: Neckbeard tries to go back and rescue them, but Batman
text: grabs his head. Well, all of him, really.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: We can't win this. We've got to
text: hide and make a new plan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NECKBEARD
dialog: (knows he's right)
dialog: Arrr!
dialog: 
text: Batman, Benny, Neckbeard and R2D2 run around the corner.
text: Bad Cop has rounded up Lucy, Emmet, and Doris.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BAD COP
scene_heading: (TO ROBO-SOLDIERS)
dialog: Take these perps to the Black
dialog: Falcon's office. The rest of you,
dialog: follow me. Looks like we'll be
text: playing a little game of hide and
dialog: seek.
dialog: 
text: He puts on his LEGO sunglasses, tough cop-style.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. EMPURA TOWER, BLACK FALCON'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Now Emmet, Doris, Lucy and Vitruvius are all tied up in a
text: row facing the window. The Black Falcon inspects his
dialog: prisoners.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BLACK FALCON
dialog: Aw how cute. Mother and son...
dialog: together at last. And what's this?
dialog: 
text: He takes the MasterPiece out of Emmet's hands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BLACK FALCON
dialog: I've been looking for a
dialog: paperweight.
speaker_heading: (TO EMMET)
dialog: Did you really think you were
dialog: going to come up here and save the
dialog: day? You're a follower, my
dialog: friend. You don't have the stuff.
speaker_heading: (TO DORIS)
dialog: And you. You must be real proud
dialog: of this one, huh? He's a credit
dialog: to the family. Just like his
dialog: talentless father.
dialog: 87.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: This stings. He is not nice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Mom, I'm so sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: I know sweetie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Just- tell me everything's going
dialog: to be okay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: I wish I could, son.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Mom... Why didn't you -- why
dialog: didn't you teach me what you knew?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: I wanted you to be safe. I thought
dialog: you would be happier. When I saw
dialog: you with that funny drawing, it
dialog: was so marvelous. And then I
dialog: thought of what your life would
dialog: be, how everyone would treat you.
dialog: I just couldn't let that happen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: I know you're the Chosen One, but--
dialog: I just wish you had let me choose
dialog: for myself.
dialog: 
text: Ouch. Doris feels awful. The fighting's stopped.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: I...I don't know what to say.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BLACK FALCON
dialog: You guys want to see it? Let me
dialog: take you up to the construction
dialog: site! Things are about to get a
dialog: little sticky down here.
dialog: 
text: He pushes a big red button and the ground begins to
text: shake. The Black Falcon smiles.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. EMPURA TOWER - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The tower begins transforming. Wings come out. Rockets
text: fire, and the volcano ERUPTS! The tower BLASTS OFF like
text: a rocketship with thunderous power. It climbs high into
text: the air and SMASHES THROUGH THE LEGO SKY!
dialog: 88.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. EMPURA TOWER, BLACK FALCON'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: They stare agape out of the picture window as the world
text: falls away. They are now in...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OUTER SPACE - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
dialog: When we look below, we see all the lands we have visited,
text: each walled silos apart from one another. Like the
text: neurons in Emmet's brain at the start of the movie.
dialog: 
text: PAN UP to find a scary, gray, HUGE FOUR-PEG LEGO BRICK,
text: made out of millions of smaller LEGO bricks. The tower
text: docks with it, a perfect tetris piece that makes it
text: finally whole. This is the SpaceStation SUPERBRICK.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SUPERBRICK - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Inside it's an enormous indoor INSTRUCTION SITE filled
text: with instruction workers working on something big. The
text: Black Falcon's office penthouse is one of the top pegs,
text: looking over everything like a control tower. Emmet
text: notices his instruction worker pals from Act I.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: They got promoted...

speaker_heading: THE BLACK FALCON
dialog: Behold: The SuperKragleThingy

speaker_heading: THE BLACK FALCON
dialog: It's my best work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: But you didn't do anything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BLACK FALCON
dialog: Are you kidding? You think the
text: MasterBuilders just up and forced
dialog: themselves to think of this? Did
dialog: those guys force themselves to
dialog: build it? No. I did. Ergo, it's
dialog: mine.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: Look down there.
dialog: 89.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The Black Falcon looks down upon all his dominions,
text: separated by walls, like LEGO sets lined up together.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BLACK FALCON
dialog: Magnificent, isn't it? And now it
dialog: will be just the way I want.
dialog: 
text: A worker puts the last piece on. Another flips a switch.
text: The SuperKragleThingy Part II ("SKT2") lights up!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BLACK FALCON
dialog: Release the Kragle!
dialog: 
text: They watch below as HUNDREDS of Bad guys in helmets

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENNY

speaker_heading: NECKBEARD
dialog: What about Lucy and the others?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: We'll come back for them. After we

dialog:

dialog:

speaker_heading: LUCY

speaker_heading: EMMET
dialog: Nuh uh.

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Emmet's eyes roll back. He can suddenly "see" the

speaker_heading: EMMET
