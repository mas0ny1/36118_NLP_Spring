text: of a modern ENGLISH LORD. The brass placard reads:
dialog: “Lord Rupert Calthorpe-Cavendish-Gore.”
text: REVEAL we're in the lobby of an ostentatious hotel. It’s
text: deserted except for TWO CLERKS at the front desk. It is
text: the middle of the night and RAINING HEAVILY outside.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON HOTEL ENTRANCE
text: The revolving doors start to swing as TWO CHILDREN (NICK
scene_heading: 8, ASTRID 8) and TWO CHINESE WOMEN, ELEANOR and FELICITY
text: YOUNG (30s) enter. They’re DRIPPING WET, dragging their
text: soaked luggage behind them.
text: Nick SLIDES his feet around the polished floor, leaving a
text: MUDDY CIRCLE in his wake. The clerks look horrified.
text: Eleanor makes her way to the front desk, while
text: complaining to Felicity about having to walk in the bad
dialog: weather.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: (in Cantonese;
dialog: subtitled)
dialog: If you didn’t make us walk, we

speaker_heading: CLERK #1
dialog: May I help you? This is the

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Eleanor goes to the desk and replies in PERFECT ENGLISH --
text: her pronunciation is BRITISH, with a lilt unique to upper-
dialog: crust Chinese from former British colonies.
dialog: (NOTE: The specific accents of our players are important
dialog: character details, indications of their background,

speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: I’m Mrs. Eleanor Young. I have a

dialog: (sees his name tag)
dialog: We spoke on the phone when I
dialog: confirmed yesterday.
speaker_heading: CLERK #1
dialog: Sorry, don’t seem to have your
dialog: reservation.
text: Clerk #2 surreptitiously presses a BUTTON under the
text: counter. Eleanor and Felicity exchange glances.
text: Felicity rolls her eyes, sensing what’s going on.
text: REGINALD ORMSBY (50s, pompous) pops out of a door behind
text: the front desk and the clerks move aside.
speaker_heading: ORMSBY
dialog: Good evening. I’m Reginald
dialog: Ormsby, hotel manager. Is there a
dialog: problem?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: I’m Mrs. Eleanor Young. My family
dialog: and I would like to be shown to
dialog: our suite. We’ve had a long
dialog: flight.
text: Ormsby takes in Eleanor et al, makes a snap judgment.
speaker_heading: ORMSBY
dialog: We’re fully booked, madam. You
dialog: must have made a mistake. I’m
dialog: sure you and your lovely family
dialog: can find other accommodations.
dialog: May I suggest you explore
dialog: Chinatown?
speaker_heading: FELICITY

text: hear Eleanor angrily speaking on the pone.
scene_heading: INT. CALTHORPE HOTEL (LONDON) - NIGHT
text: Eleanor bursts through the front door with her family
text: right behind her. Eleanor approaches the front desk
text: again. Ormsby is not pleased.
speaker_heading: ORMSBY
dialog: Mrs. Young! I must ask you to
dialog: leave, or I’ll have to call the
dialog: police.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Please, go right ahead.
text: Ormsby is taken aback. He moves to stop her when the
text: elevator DINGS and OPENS and an ELDERLY MAN IN A SILK
text: ROBE AND SLIPPERS comes out -- LORD CALTHORPE, the same
text: man in the opening portrait and owner of the hotel.
text: Ormsby snaps to.
speaker_heading: ORMSBY
dialog: Lord Calthorpe! My apologies for
dialog: this disturbance --
text: Lord Calthorpe ignores Ormsby and beelines for Eleanor.
speaker_heading: LORD CALTHORPE
dialog: Eleanor! I just got off the phone
dialog: with your husband.
text: Lord Calthorpe kisses Eleanor on the cheek, and snaps at

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ORMSBY
dialog: Surely you’re joking, sir.
speaker_heading: LORD CALTHORPE
dialog: I assure you, I’m not. As of this
dialog: evening, my family’s long history
dialog: as custodians of the Calthorpe is
dialog: ended. I am selling the hotel to
dialog: my dear friends, the Young family
dialog: of Singapore.
text: Ormsby looks at Eleanor, shocked.
speaker_heading: LORD CALTHORPE
dialog: Meet the new lady of the house,

dialog: (to Eleanor)
dialog: Join me for a toast.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: We'd be delighted.

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: All right, so, how did I beat T.A.
dialog: Curtis so very, very badly? Well,
dialog: I know for a fact that Curtis is
dialog: cheap.
text: The students all smile and laugh, totally engaged.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: So, he’s not playing using logic
text: or math, but using his psychology.
dialog: Our brains so hate the idea of
dialog: losing something that’s valuable
dialog: to us, that we abandon all
dialog: rational thought and make some
dialog: really poor decisions. So Curtis
dialog: wasn’t playing to win. He was
dialog: playing not to lose.
dialog: (to Curtis; tosses
dialog: him a chip)
dialog: Here. Put it towards a haircut.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: KERRY
dialog: No! No! No! No! You can’t wear

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: It’s only ‘cause I hardly know

speaker_heading: KERRY
dialog: Maybe he’s embarrassed. Maybe his

dialog: dress.
speaker_heading: KERRY

scene_heading: EXT. JFK -
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What was that look? I saw that.
speaker_heading: KERRY
dialog: Nothing. It’s just, Nick bringing

dialog: overseas families. Eh, they’re
dialog: different from us.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: How are they different? They’re

speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Better too many than have people

text: Meanwhile, Nick teaches Rachel how to fold a dumpling --

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: So, right. You put the baby in

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Okay. That’s so cute. And then

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: How's that?
dialog: (chuckles)
dialog: Then you eat the baby. Not until

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: No, you gotta make sure he’s
dialog: cooked. Did Ah Ma teach you that?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: She did.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I, on the other hand, was taught
dialog: by Grand Aunty Mabel. ‘You put

speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: We didn’t have a choice.

speaker_heading: FELICITY

speaker_heading: ALIX
dialog: Not like ang-mohs, microwaving
dialog: macaroni and cheese for their own
dialog: children.
dialog: (shudders )
dialog: No wonder they put their parents

dialog: The others all laugh --
speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: ALIX

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The family exchanges looks. What does Rachel mean?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: When I was growing up, it was just

dialog: nice.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: That's so lovely of you to say,
dialog: Rachel. We all are very lucky to
dialog: have each other.
text: Alix and Felicity smile, approving. Feeling more
text: comfortable, Rachel tries to engage Eleanor, who’s been

text: piece studded with diamonds and emeralds.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: That’s a beautiful ring, Aunty
dialog: Eleanor. I’ve never seen anything
dialog: like it.
text: The other women look at Eleanor, trying to gauge her

speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: (surprised; then)
dialog: Nick’s father had it made when he
dialog: proposed to me.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: That's very romantic. How did you

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Actually, they met at Cambridge.
dialog: They were both studying law
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Oh, I didn’t know you were a

speaker_heading: ELEANOR

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: I chose to help my husband run a

dialog: For me, it was a privilege. But
dialog: for you, you may think it's old-
dialog: fashioned. It's nice you
dialog: appreciate this house and us being
text: here together wrapping dumplings.
dialog: But all this doesn't just happen.
dialog: It's because we know to put family
dialog: first, instead of chasing one's
dialog: passion.
text: An awkward SILENCE falls over the table. Rachel feels
dialog: chided, isn’t sure how to react when:
speaker_heading: AH MA (0.S.)

dialog: Oh, no, you know what? I'm sorry
dialog: I made an assumption. I didn't
dialog: mean to offend you.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Not at all.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You asked about my ring. The
dialog: truth is Nick’s father had it made
dialog: when he wanted to propose to me,
dialog: because Ah Ma wouldn’t give him
dialog: the family ring. I wasn’t her
dialog: first choice. Honestly, I wasn’t
dialog: her second.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Gosh, I'm so sorry. I had no
dialog: idea.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: I didn’t come from the right

text: surprised how Eleanor is seemingly opening up.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: But, she came around, obviously.
text: Eleanor gives a tight smile.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: It took many years, and she had

dialog: (off Rachel)

dialog: There were many days when I

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I know my mum can be tough at

dialog: she wouldn’t do for me...
dialog: (off Rachel’s
dialog: silence)
dialog: And there is a reason why I lived
dialog: with Ah Ma growing up. It’s
dialog: because my mother knew she wasn’t
dialog: the favorite. So she let her
dialog: raise me so I would be.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You were just a kid?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yeah. But... It's hard to
dialog: understand from the outside. But
dialog: she did what she thought was best

text: Rachel hears the tiny reminder of her otherness.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Mm-hmm.

speaker_heading: NICK

text: tiles, stacks being formed and moved like clockwork.
text: Eleanor is surprised to see how adept and effortless
text: Rachel is. Eleanor walks up to the table.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 127.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Thanks for meeting me here.
dialog: (re: women)
dialog: Don’t worry about them. They’re
dialog: half deaf and they only speak
dialog: Hokkien.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (hands Eleanor dice)
dialog: Mm-hmm.
text: Eleanor sits down at the table, and tosses the dice in
text: the middle of the stacks of tiles. She starts playing
dialog: the game.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: My mom taught me how to play. She
dialog: told me mahjong would teach me
dialog: important life skills.
dialog: Negotiation, strategy,
dialog: cooperation.
text: (NOTE: The game goes on throughout the scene. With
text: cards thrown, picked up, chips exchanging hands, etc.)
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: You asked me here. I assume it’s
dialog: not for a mahjong lesson. Pung.
text: She puts down a power card combo. The women toss red
text: chips to her.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: My mother taught me, too.
text: Rachel tosses her a red chip.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I know Nick told you the truth
dialog: about my mom. But you didn’t like
dialog: me the second I got here. Why is
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: There's a Hokkien phrase. Ka gi
dialog: lan. It means ‘our own kind of
dialog: people.’ And you’re not our own
dialog: kind.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: ‘Cause I’m not rich? ‘Cause I
dialog: didn’t go to a British boarding
dialog: school or I wasn't born into a
dialog: wealthy family?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 128.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: You're a foreigner. American.
dialog: And all Americans think about is
dialog: their own happiness.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Don’t you want Nick to be happy?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: It’s an illusion. We understand
dialog: how to build things that last.
dialog: Something you know nothing about.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You don’t know me.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: I know you’re not what Nick needs.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Well, he proposed to me yesterday.
dialog: (off Eleanor)
dialog: He said he'd walk away from his
dialog: family and from you, for good.
text: Eleanor’s hand slips, she drops a tile. The other women
text: exchange looks, sensing the tension:
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Don’t worry, I turned him down.
text: Eleanor tries to regain her composure.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
text: Only a fool folds a winning hand.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: There’s no winning. You made sure
dialog: of that. Because if Nick chose
dialog: me, he would lose his family. And
dialog: if he chose his family, he might
dialog: spend the rest of his life
dialog: resenting you.
text: Eleanor grabs a tile that Rachel had just discarded.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: So you chose for him.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I’m not leaving ‘cause I’m scared
dialog: or because I think I’m not enough.
dialog: Because... maybe for the first
dialog: time in my life, I know I am.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 129.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: RACHEL (CONT'D)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I just love Nick so much. I don't
dialog: want him to lose his mom again.
dialog: So I just wanted you to know that
text: one day, when he marries another
dialog: lucky girl, who is enough for you,
dialog: and you're playing with your
text: grandkids while the tan huas are
text: blooming, and the birds are
dialog: chirping, that it was because of
dialog: me... a poor, raised by a single
dialog: mother, low class, immigrant
dialog: nobody.
text: Rachel SHOWS HER HAND -- a WINNING COMBINATION -- but she
text: FOLDS. The game is mucked (no one can win). Rachel gets
dialog: up.
text: As Rachel reaches the door, REVEAL Kerry has been sitting
text: quietly at another table. As Kerry joins Rachel, she
text: turns to see Eleanor and the two mothers exchange a look.
scene_heading: INT. ASTRID’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY
text: Astrid enters as Michael packs a bag. Michael is
text: uncomfortable, not wanting to do this in front of her.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Hey. I'm gonna send someone for
dialog: the rest of my stuff. But I wanna
dialog: talk to you about my visitation
dialog: rights with Cassian.
speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: Stop talking.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: Don’t worry about packing your
dialog: things. You bought this
dialog: apartment, you keep it. We're
dialog: leaving --
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What do you mean, you're leaving?
dialog: Where are you gonna go?
speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: I have fourteen apartment
dialog: buildings that I own, so probably
dialog: one of those.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 130.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ASTRID (CONT'D)
dialog: And you'll see Cassian when it’s
dialog: good for him, not when it’s good
dialog: for you.
text: Astrid walks away. Michael takes her arm, holds her
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Hey! Look, you know, it's not
dialog: just my fault that things didn't
dialog: work out.
text: Astrid pauses, then:
speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: You're right. I shouldn’t have
dialog: kept things from you. Hidden my
dialog: shoes, turned down jobs, charity
dialog: work, worrying that it might make
dialog: you feel lesser than. But let’s
dialog: be clear -- the problem with our
dialog: marriage isn’t my family’s money.
dialog: It’s that you’re a coward. You
dialog: gave up on us. But I’ve just
dialog: realized --
dialog: (then)
dialog: It’s not my job to make you feel
dialog: like a man. I can’t make you
dialog: something you’re not.

scene_heading: TIME CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ASTRID’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

scene_heading: TUPPERWARE MEALS.

speaker_heading: PEIK LIN

speaker_heading: RACHEL

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I always imagined what me
dialog: proposing to you would be like.
dialog: And you know what, I had it all
dialog: planned out.
dialog: (to sitting man on
dialog: plane)
dialog: Oh, yeah, right behind you. Don't
dialog: mind me.
dialog: (to Rachel)
dialog: I'd bring you to my favorite spot
text: on the island. There's a hidden
dialog: trail that I used to go to as a
dialog: child. Now there's a cove there
dialog: that opens up to this beautiful
dialog: lake.
dialog: (to standing man on
dialog: plane)
dialog: Um, sorry, dude. Give me a
dialog: second. Let me just move.
text: Nick passes by the standing man as he continues:
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: When the sun hits the horizon, I'd
dialog: get down on one knee.
text: Rachel sighs.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: And the rest of the world would
dialog: fall away. Because it would just

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: But wherever you are in the world,

text: She takes this in. He pulls out a ring box.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: But, I --
text: Nick opens the box, revealing: ELEANOR’S EMERALD RING.
text: Time stops. Rachel’s breath parts from her for the
text: moment. Her eyes meet his and then --
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Rachel Chu. Will you marry me and
dialog: make me the happiest man in this
dialog: world?
text: Rachel, teary-eyed and overwhelmed, is about to respond.
speaker_heading: CHUBBY WOMAN
dialog: Yes! Yes! Yes! She will marry
dialog: you!
