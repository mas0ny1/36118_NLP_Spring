dialog: there is a very strong and very potent solution
dialog: of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle,
dialog: with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in
text: his mouth and drop on his tounge and
dialog: it will certainly diminish the pain that
dialog: he is in but you have to realize that
dialog: once you give it to him; there really
dialog: is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly
dialog: cure his pain, but he will float in and
text: out of consciousness, even worse than he
dialog: is now, Linda. I mean, any sign of the

speaker_heading: LINDA

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: -- that's right, that's right, and what I'M
dialog: saying, that none of my competitors can say is
dialog: this: That there is no need for insight or
dialog: understanding. Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done.
dialog: Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is?
dialog: How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and
dialog: ahead of it's time this concept is? I'm
dialog: talking about eliminating insight and understanding
dialog: as human values. GOD DAMN I'M GOOD. There is
dialog: no need for INSIGHT. There is no need for
dialog: UNDERSTANDING. I have found a way to take
dialog: any subjective human experience -- in other
dialog: words -- all the terrible shit or all the
dialog: great shit that you've had happen to you in
dialog: your life -- and quickly and easily transform
text: it in the unconscious mind through the subtle
dialog: and cunning use of language. The "listener-patient"
text: (in other words: The Chick) settles into a very
text: light, very delicate, conversationally induced
dialog: state: NOT A TRANCE, mind you, but a STATE.
text: A state that is brand new. The System's state.
dialog: What did I do? I REALIZED that concept and put
dialog: it into practical "get my dick hard and fuck it" use.
dialog: I'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the
dialog: seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party
dialog: 'till dawn. I'm gonna teach methods of language that
dialog: will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail --

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I just realized this is for television,
dialog: isn't it? I can't swear up and down

speaker_heading: GWENOVIER
dialog: It's fine. I can bleep it out.
speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: GWENOVIER

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Is that still lingering?
speaker_heading: GWENOVIER
dialog: -- just to clarify --
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: So boring, so useless --
speaker_heading: GWENOVIER
dialog: I would just want to clear some things up:
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (Muffy delivers coffee)
dialog: Thank you, Muffy. Funny thing is:
dialog: This is an important element of,
dialog: "Seduce and Destory:"
dialog: "Facing the past is an important way
dialog: in not making progress," that's something
dialog: I tell my men over and over --
speaker_heading: GWENOVIER
dialog: This isn't meant --
speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: GWENOVIER
dialog: Well, just trying to figure out who you are,

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: In aid of what?
speaker_heading: GWENOVIER
dialog: I'm saying, Frank, in trying to
dialog: figure out who you are --
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: -- there's a lot more important things
dialog: I'd like to put myself into --
speaker_heading: GWENOVIER
dialog: It's all important --
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Not really.
speaker_heading: GWENOVIER
dialog: It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: This is how you wanna spend the time,
dialog: then go, go, go -- you're gonna
dialog: be surprised at what a waste it is --
dialog: "The most useless thing in the world
dialog: is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
speaker_heading: GWENOVIER
dialog: We talked earlier about your mother.
dialog: And we talked about your father and his death.
dialog: And I don't want to be challenging or
dialog: defeatist here, but I have to ask and
dialog: I would want to clarify something --
dialog: something that I understand --
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
speaker_heading: GWENOVIER
dialog: Do you remember a Miss Simms?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
speaker_heading: GWENOVIER
dialog: She does. From when you were a boy.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Mm. Hm.
speaker_heading: GWENOVIER
dialog: She lived in Tarzana.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: An old stomping ground --is this
dialog: the "attack" portion of the interview,
dialog: I figured this was coming sooner
dialog: or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?
speaker_heading: GWENOVIER
dialog: No, this is about getting something
dialog: right and claryfying one of your answers
dialog: to an earlier question --
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Go ahead and waste your time.
speaker_heading: GWENOVIER
dialog: I was told that your mother died.
dialog: That your mother died when you were young --
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: And that's what you've heard?
speaker_heading: GWENOVIER
dialog: I talked to Miss Simms. Miss Simms
dialog: was your caretaker and neighbor
dialog: after your mother died in 1980.
text: BEAT. Frank goes silent.
speaker_heading: GWENOVIER
dialog: In my research I have you listed as
dialog: the only son of Earl and Lily Partridge.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And what I learned from Mrs. Simms is that
dialog: your mother passed away in 1980.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: See: It's my understanding that the information
dialog: supplied by you and your company and answers
dialog: to question's I've asked are incorrect, Frank.
dialog: And if I'd like to get to the bottom of who you
dialog: are and why you are then I think your family

speaker_heading: LINDA

speaker_heading: KLIGMAN
dialog: You don't have to change the will,

speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Where will the money go?
speaker_heading: KLIGMAN
dialog: Well. Considering that there's no one

dialog: have to go to the laws of intestacy,
dialog: which is -- as if someone died without a will --
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: KLIGMAN
dialog: The money would go to Frank. The court
dialog: would put the money in the hands of a relative --
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: -- that can't happen. Earl doesn't
dialog: want him to have the money, the things.
speaker_heading: KLIGMAN

speaker_heading: JIMMY (OC)
dialog: Excellent. Next number:

dialog: that sounds like Ravel's "Bolero."
