dialog: That is not true-
speaker_heading: 6/4/98
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: When we bought them from you,
dialog: promises were made about plumbing,
dialog: about dry rot, about roofing
dialog: materials-
speaker_heading: HARM
dialog: I had a cash-flow situation-
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Promises which you did not keep-
speaker_heading: HARM
dialog: I gave you my boat.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Yes, as collateral-
speaker_heading: HARM
dialog: It's worth more than those repairs-
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: It is worth relatively little on the
dialog: market. We've had it appraised-
speaker_heading: . HARM
dialog: I gave you my license. That's worth
dialog: a--
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: We're not fishermen, Harmon.
speaker_heading: HARM
dialog: Exactly. That's why I'm saying I

dialog: You come up here, you bust people's
dialog: balls-
speaker_heading: 6/4/98
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: If your balls are being busted,
dialog: Harmon, it's because you stuck em in
dialog: a vise and you yanked the handle-
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: The screw.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LOU
text: The jaws of a vise are moved by a
dialog: screw or a lever. You don't call it
text: a handle.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Thank you, Louise. The point being,
dialog: Mr. King, if you're feeling pressure
dialog: on your testicles, you have only
dialog: yourself to blame.
speaker_heading: HARM
dialog: So you're just gonna take the hit,
dialog: let my boat rot in the harbor-
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: You misrepresented the properties to

speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: A share.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: On a boat, in, you know- nautical
dialog: terms, it's called working for a

speaker_heading: FRANKIE (curt)
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Francine, if we're going to do this,
dialog: we should get the terminology right.

speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: In carpentry, Louise, I bow to your

dialog: as little as I do, which is next to
dialog: nothing- .
speaker_heading: HARM
dialog: You think you're gonna find somebody

speaker_heading: WOODS - SUN
text: We see the SUN high in the sky, framed by TREETOPS. We TILT
text: DOWN to see Donna and Noelle sunning in an open patch,

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: DONNA

speaker_heading: JOE
text: Little inlet on the backside of

speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: And that's like up Shit Creek without

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Pretty much. I figure we should head
text: around toward the channel while it's
dialog: still light, hope we run into a
dialog: stream. We'll be okay without food
dialog: for awhile, but water-
text: He wads a sock into the toe of one of his shoes and hands it
dialog: to Noelle-
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Try this.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: What are you going to use?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'll be careful where I step. Go
dialog: ahead.
text: Noelle sticks her foot into the shoe, starts to lace it up.
text: Donna holds her head in her hands-
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: This is not happening to us. This is
dialog: only a dramatization of somebody
dialog: else's pathetic story.
dialog: . JOE
dialog: It could be worse. It's not so cold

scene_heading: EXT WOODS - PENS 89

speaker_heading: DONNA :
dialog: Remember I did that fast when we were

speaker_heading: NOELLE :

speaker_heading: DONNA

speaker_heading: JOE

dialog: better and I help him clear the fish
dialog: trap and prepare the feed for the
dialog: animals. It is unpleasant, sticky
dialog: work, but must be done. I have
text: gotten stronger handling the skiff
text: and Mother chides Papa for making a
dialog: boy of me, but I don't mind. The
dialog: days it doesn't rain are God's glory
dialog: and most of our vixens are close to

text: She closes the diary. Donna and Joe watch the fire, thinking-
scene_heading: EXT STREAM - MORNING 108
text: Time has passed. Noelle, standing thigh-deep in the stream,
text: yanks the jerry-rigged fish trap to the surface. There is a
text: very large salmon caught in it, flapping desperately as it
text: hits the air. She CRIES OUT and drops the trap, then gets
text: her courage and hauls it up again. She smiles-
scene_heading: EXT WOODS - MORNING 109
text: Joe and Donna embrace leaning up against a tree, holding
text: tight, rocking a little, clinging like their lives depend on
dialog: it-
speaker_heading: NOELLE
text: Noelle stands back in the trees, watching mutely, the salmon
text: slung over her shoulder with a cord through its gills-
scene_heading: EXT SHORE - AFTERNOON 110
text: Joe pulls a flat stone out from the embers of the signal
text: fire, blows the ash off it. He lays thin strips of the
dialog: salmon meat on it-
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You don't worry about burning it up
dialog: this way-.just flip it over after a
dialog: minute-
text: We SHIFT to see Donna and Noelle. Noelle sits away from
text: them, sulking, shivering slightly-
dialog: JOE (to Noelle)
dialog: You laid the trap back in?
speaker_heading: 6/4/98

speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: . JOE
dialog: Indians used to smoke everything they

text: Donna is looking at the sky-
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Good day for planes.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Nobody's coming.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Don't be negative-
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: In two weeks how many planes have we
dialog: seen? Zero.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: We heard that one.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: There would have been more if they
dialog: were searching for us here.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Bobby may have told people at the
dialog: dock we were headed in a different
dialog: direction. He thought people were
dialog: after him-
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: People were after him-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yeah. Anyway, they may be searching
text: in a totally different area.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Stupid-
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Noelle- .
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Trying to impress your boyfriend,
dialog: drag us out on a boat-
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: That's enough.
text: A silence.
speaker_heading: 6/4/98
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: It's true.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Look, I am cold, I am hungry, I am
dialog: dirty, and I am scared shitless, just
dialog: like you. But I'm trying to help us
dialog: get through this thing-
speaker_heading: NOELLE .
dialog: I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't be
dialog: in this state, I shouldn't-
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Nobody is to blame for this-
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Yeah, right-
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: When you are of age, Noelle, you are
dialog: free to go fuck your own life up.
dialog: Until that day, I'm afraid, it's my
dialog: job to fuck it up for you!
text: Donna looks to Joe-
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: You could help me with this-
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: He's not my father.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Thank God for that.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: What's that mean?
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Your father would have gone off
dialog: picking berries or something and
dialog: that's the last we'd have heard from
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: That's not true.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: How would you know? He was in the
dialog: same room.with you maybe twice-
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: You wouldn't let him-
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: If you cross his mind once a year,
dialog: max, I'd be surprised-
speaker_heading: 6/4/98
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Every Christmas-
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Oh Noelle-
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: He sent me a bike, he sent me a
dialog: watch, he sent me a dollhouse-
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: iI sent the watch!
text: This shuts Noelle up. She had no idea. Donna isn't happy
dialog: she let it out-
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: I sent the bike- all of it. I
dialog: figured when you were little, you had
dialog: Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, you
dialog: might as well have a father in
dialog: California who sent you stuff.
text: Noelle glares at her, tears in her eyes. Joe flips the
text: salmon, hoping to stay out of the crossfire-
speaker_heading: NOELLE (muted)
dialog: I hated that dollhouse.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: I know, honey, but you wouldn't let
dialog: me exchange it, cause it was from
dialog: him. Remember?
text: She sees that Noelle is shaking-
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: I'm great. I'm kickin-
speaker_heading: DONNA (moving)
dialog: Let me feel your forehead-
text: Noelle pushes her hand away-
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Leave me alone!
text: Donna backs off. She uses a piece of seaweed to pick up the
dialog: hot stone, offers Noelle the salmon-
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Eat something.
speaker_heading: 6/4/98
dialog: 105.
scene_heading: 111 INT HOUSE - NIGHT 111
text: Noelle reads solemnly, slowly. She is by the fire and
text: wrapped in Joe's jacket, but still trembling with a fever-
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: "I was the one who found them. It
dialog: was time to clean the scat from the
dialog: pens so I had the shovel and the
text: buckets and then there was blood
text: everywhere in the snow. All of them
dialog: torn and smashed, even my little
text: kits. A bear, says Papa, though when
text: has a bear got into a half-dozen
dialog: different pens without breaking the
text: gates? Mother says nothing, but she
dialog: is only a black spot these days, and
dialog: refused to celebrate Christmas. The
text: pelts are ruined, of course,
dialog: worthless, and our long care is for
dialog: naught. Papa couldn't speak when he
text: saw them. He says his head hurts
dialog: trying to think a way out of our
dialog: dilemma.
text: Joe shoots a look at Donna to see how she is taking this-
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: I dreamed that Fox came and was angry
dialog: for what we let happen, that He held
dialog: me down on the snow and I felt His
text: hot breath on my face, felt it bitter
text: in my throat, and felt his ice-eyes
dialog: cutting into me. I wish He would
dialog: come soon.
dialog: Mother sleeps with me now and it is
dialog: cramped and tense. You would think
text: another body under the covers would
dialog: bring warmth, but I wake feeling
text: drained, like she has pulled all the
dialog: heat from me. I am doing the cooking
dialog: now and my eyes are always red from
text: the smoke. The wood is too big for
text: the cookstove, but the axe has gone
dialog: missing and we can't break it down.
dialog: Mother says Hell is a cold place.
dialog: Maybe I am the soul not of a she-
text: wolf, but of a soaring bird that
dialog: flies south every winter, and my
dialog: heart is so sick because I am not
dialog: supposed to be here in this cold,
dialog: this dark, this wet. Maybe I am like
dialog: the air in this house, the air that
text: does not move when Papa and Mother
text: pass in silence, dead, smoky air that
text: smells of wool and old bacon.
text: Tears begin to roll down Noelle's cheeks as she reads-

text: Noelle is feeding the signal fire. She hears something,
text: stands shakily to look’up, shading her eyes-
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Over Noelle's shoulder we see a FLOAT PLANE flying over the
text: other side of the inlet. Suddenly it banks and heads right
dialog: toward her-
speaker_heading: NOELLE
text: Excited, she starts to yell-
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: It's coming! It's coming!
scene_heading: INT WOODS - AFTERNOON 113
text: Donna is dragging fallen branches toward the shore. She
text: hears Noelle's VOICE, drops the branches and begins to run-
scene_heading: EXT SHORE 114
text: Donna breaks out of the woods and begins to run toward the

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Donna! Careful!
scene_heading: NOELLE - PLANE
text: Noelle is in the FG as the float plane lands in the inlet and
text: taxis straight toward her-
scene_heading: INT PLANE - POV 115
text: We see through the windshield as the shore approaches. A
text: young girl by a fire, joined by an older woman and man-
scene_heading: EXT SHORE - TRIO 116
text: Noelle and Donna are beaming, Joe worried-
speaker_heading: REVERSE
text: The little float plane slows as it nears the shore. Joe
text: wades out into the water to grab hold of the float tether as
text: the engine cuts off and the prop stops turning. Smilin Jack
text: steps out onto the float on his side-
speaker_heading: 6/4/98
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: SMILIN JACK
dialog: You_folks picked a hell of a spot for
text: a clambake.
speaker_heading: DONNA (stepping forward)
dialog: We've been stuck here forever! We've
dialog: been stranded!
text: SMILIN JACK (looking past them)
dialog: Any more of you?
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Just us. We were on Bobby's boat-
dialog: Joe's brother? And he was- murdered.
text: Joe shoots Donna a look. It's clear he doesn't totally trust
text: Jack. Jack looks at Joe-
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'm not sure who did it. We jumped
dialog: off at night-- there were a couple
dialog: fellas came in looking and we hid,
dialog: then they pulled anchor-
dialog: He shrugs-
speaker_heading: SMILIN JACK
dialog: Damn. How long you been here?
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: A week and a half? We found what was
dialog: left of an old house, we've been
text: holing up there at night.
text: SMILIN JACK (shakes his head)
dialog: And I was hoping you people could
dialog: help me. My radio's shot, I'm low on
dialog: fuel and I'm heading into bad weather.
speaker_heading: JOE (suspicious)
dialog: Your radio's gone?
speaker_heading: SMILIN JACK
dialog: Crapped out on me a half hour back.
text: Not even static.
text: He looks to the sky, looks at the water-
speaker_heading: SMILIN JACK
dialog: Tide's going out fast. I'm gonna
dialog: have to turn this thing around and
dialog: try to get out of here, send help-
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Take my daughter, then. She's sick-
speaker_heading: 6/4/98
dialog: 108.
scene_heading: SMILIN JACK (grave)
dialog: I'd love to, but I can't handle the
dialog: weight. Believe me, it'll be safer
dialog: here-
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: She barely weighs a thing-
speaker_heading: SMILIN JACK
dialog: I got to jettison whatever I can: to
dialog: have a fighting chance. Sorry ladies.
text: He pulls off his jacket, tosses it to Noelle-
scene_heading: SMILIN JACK (to Joe)
dialog: You want to give me a hand with this?
text: He reaches in and starts tossing things-on shore-
speaker_heading: SMILIN JACK
dialog: I got a first aid kit in here- no
dialog: food though-
scene_heading: DONNA AND NOELLE
text: Noelle is shaking again. Donna puts her arms around her,

speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: We'll have to spend one more night
dialog: out here. honey, that's all. Then
dialog: they'll come and get us-
scene_heading: JOE AND SMILIN JACK
text: Joe helps Jack wrestle the tiny plane around to face out to
text: sea. They speak quietly enough that the women can't hear-
speaker_heading: SMILIN JACK
dialog: I'm real sorry to hear about Bobby,
dialog: man. I used to party with him up in
dialog: Haines-
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What's the story?
speaker_heading: SMILIN JACK
dialog: What's what story?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Who sent you?
text: Jack meets Joe's eyes for a long moment, then gives a furtive
dialog: look toward the shore-
speaker_heading: DONNA AND
dialog: Donna and
speaker_heading: 6/4/98
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: SMILIN JACK
dialog: Couple guys- Mr. Smith and Mr. Brown-
dialog: never seen em before but I don't
dialog: think they're up here to save the
dialog: whales. They laid some serious money
dialog: on me to poke around, see if I could
text: spot three people roughing it in the
dialog: boonies.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: And if you saw them?
speaker_heading: SMILIN JACK
dialog: Just go back and tell them where.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Why'd you land, then?
speaker_heading: SMILIN JACK
dialog: I'm on the level about the radio and
dialog: the rest of it, Joe. I was hoping to
dialog: find some sport fishermen with a
text: short-wave and a cooler full of brew.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
text: Noelle watch, Donna reassuring her daughter-
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: We'll sit in a hot bath for a day or
dialog: so while people bring us everything
dialog: we want to eat and drink and then
dialog: we'll get into a soft bed with clean
text: sheets and just hibernate-
speaker_heading: PLANE, MEN
text: Smilin Jack gets into the pilot's seat and buckles up-
speaker_heading: SMILIN JACK
dialog: If I'd known the deal with Bobby I'd
dialog: of turned em in- you have to trust me
dialog: on that.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Right.
text: Jack leans out and calls out to the women on shore-
speaker_heading: SMILIN JACK
dialog: Hang in there, ladies! I'll be back
dialog: with the cavalry tomorrow!
text: He looks to Joe-
speaker_heading: SMILIN JACK
dialog: Wish me luck, buddy.
speaker_heading: 6/4/98
dialog: 110.
text: Joe says nothing. Jack grins, shuts the door, gives Joe
text: thumbs up. Joe steps off the float and moves away as Jack
text: revs the engine and begins to taxi away-
speaker_heading: SHORE
text: Joe joins Donna and Noelle as the plane gathers speed and
text: takes off from the water-
speaker_heading: DONNA :
dialog: We're saved. We're gonna make it.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yeah.
scene_heading: INT HOUSE - NIGHT 117
text: The three sit around the fire. Joe speaks carefully, not,
text: wanting to dishearten them, but deeply troubled. It has
text: begun to RAIN outside-
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: The last I heard he was flying out of
text: Anchorage, kicking square halibut out -
dialog: of a cargo plane-
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Marijuana bales. You fly over a spot
text: on the water, somebody signals with
dialog: lights or gives you a code over the
dialog: radio, and you dump your load. The
text: people in the boat below fish the
text: bales out and take them to the next
dialog: stage.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: He's'a drug dealer.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: He's whatever pays best and he can
dialog: get away with. He's got balls and
dialog: he's never gotten caught or bought
dialog: the farm. Bad weather, bad company-
dialog: you got the cash Smilin Jack's your
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: He hit on me a couple times at the
dialog: bar. He seemed like a nice guy.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I didn't say people don't like him.
dialog: I said I don't trust him.
speaker_heading: 6/4/98
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: You think he might tell those men?
dialog: And bring them back here?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I don't know. I didn't believe him
dialog: about the radio- and we've got some
dialog: personal history-
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: His brother drowned on a fishing
dialog: boat. It was my fault.
text: Donna ponders this a moment-
dialog: She turns
speaker_heading: DONNA (deciding)
dialog: He wouldn't do that to us. He's not
dialog: a killer.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: I've looked in his eyes. TI can tell
dialog: things about a person-
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Like you could tell that Dwayne in
dialog: Colorado Springs wasn't cheating on
dialog: you with the cocktail waitress-
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: This is different-
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Or that Lyle would never hit you-
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Once, he hit me once and I walked-
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: But you didn't see it coming, did you?
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: We don't have any choice! You're
dialog: sick, it's getting colder, we can't
dialog: stay here!

speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Can we?
dialog: 118
dialog: 119
dialog: 120
dialog: 121
speaker_heading: 6/4/98
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Nobody's coming for a while if it
dialog: keeps up like this. Not in a boat,
dialog: not in a plane-
text: Donna looks at the rain pouring down outside-
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: It doesn't look so bad. They'll be

scene_heading: EXT SHORE - DAY “448

scene_heading: EXT WOODS - DAY - VARIOUS SHOTS 119
dialog: RAIN beats down-
scene_heading: EXT HOUSE - DAY 120
text: We see the little lean-to house through a torrential DOWNPOUR-
scene_heading: INT HOUSE 121
text: Noelle, wearing Smilin Jack's jacket, sleeps by the fire,
text: WHEEZING in the early stages of pneumonia. Donna crouches by
text: the opening to the outside, watching the RAIN blast down-
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: It's got to stop sometime.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Sooner or later.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Humor me, okay?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It was worse yesterday. And the day
dialog: before.. We just have to hang on.
speaker_heading: DONNA
text: The signal fire is probably out-
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: As soon as it clears we'll get it
text: going again.
text: Donna crosses to Noelle, feels her forehead, worried. She
text: sees something, digs- comes up with the diary. Joe watches
text: as she opens the clasp, starts to thumb through the pages.
text: She frowns-
dialog: 122
speaker_heading: 6/4/98
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: DONNA
text: It's blank.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DONNA
text: The pages are blank after the first
dialog: couple entries. The foxes haven't
dialog: even had their babies yet.
text: They both look at Noelle. Donna closes the diary, clasps it
dialog: shut, carefully replaces it-
scene_heading: INT HOUSE - NIGHT "422
text: We start on the FIRE, a bit smoky but comforting against the
text: sound of the RAIN still .pelting down. We PAN to Noelle,
text: wrapped in as many layers as possible, eyes bright with fever
text: as she ceremoniously opens the diary and fixes Joe and Donna
text: with a look. She reads softly-
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: We won't bury her on the island. She
dialog: made me promise. She whispered it,
dialog: hissed it in my ear one night when
text: she was laying hard beside me in bed.
dialog: "Promise me". She wouldn't listen to
dialog: anything else.
dialog: We had come back from looking for
dialog: deer, Papa and me, signs at the salt
dialog: lick but nothing to shoot at. I was
text: putting his rifle back where he hid
dialog: it in the shed roof when I heard him
dialog: cry out. He wouldn't let me in at
dialog: first, though I hollered and struck
text: at the door. He opened up when he'd
text: got her down on the table, but I saw
text: the black mark around her neck where
text: the cord was. The fire had gone out,
dialog: so our breath was showing, Papa and
dialog: me, and it was like long white sighs
text: of grief in the room and her mouth
text: open and hair crispy to the touch.
dialog: We wrapped her in the afghan, then I
dialog: got the fire going while Papa just
dialog: sat. Nothing to say. Later we found
dialog: the note and she told how the animals
dialog: were Satan's handmaidens, how their
dialog: sharp little eyes would not give her
dialog: peace so she killed them and threw
dialog: the axe in the woods. 'We have
dialog: looked into ourselves,' she wrote,
dialog: ‘and what is there condemns us.'
dialog: We'll take her off the
dialog: island come first thaw. If Fox comes
text: then, padding through the trees to be
dialog: my mate, He will find us gone.

speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: That's it. The last entry.
dialog: Donna nods-
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Poor thing.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Litte Anne Marie there. Her mother
dialog: didn't love her enough to stick
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: She was crazy.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: She still left her daughter in the
dialog: lurch. I'd never do that. No matter

speaker_heading: DONNA

dialog: sick. It's the only time she lets me
dialog: hold her anymore.
speaker_heading: JOE
text: It's some kind of fever.
speaker_heading: DONNA
text: It's in her lungs. We have to get

speaker_heading: JOE (nods)

speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: You're not sick of us?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: If you're not sick of me.
speaker_heading: DONNA (considers)
dialog: Hey- there's nobody in the world I'd
dialog: rather be stranded in desperate
dialog: circumstances with. Really. But we
dialog: should- take our time with the
dialog: furniture-moving part. We come with
dialog: a lot of baggage-
speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: DONNA
