text: We are in the midst of a field of tall grass wild flowers.
text: A long rutted road stretches into the distance. Faintly at
text: first and then closer - we hear a woman squealing with
text: laughter. We see her legs cut through the grass and fly up a
text: hill. Close on her heels is a young man, a good ten years
text: younger, in hot pursuit.
text: Over the field - across the tops of blades, sits an ancient
text: apple tree. We rise out of the grass and see the two young

text: his mother's coat--refusing to see or be seen.
text: The truck comes to a stop and two men get out. One is young,

scene_heading: EXT. HARBOR - S
text: Matt &amp; Frank prepare the rig.
text: Jason stands on the dock, taking it all in. A field of

text: stiff with sea salt - all so wildly unreasonable as to seem
dialog: exotic.
text: Jason's eyes find the hull of "GIGI" an old Boudreau built

scene_heading: EXT. HARBOR LATER
text: The sun is fast climbing into the morning sky as "GIGI"
text: glides out of the channel and past a LIGHTHOUSE that sits
text: Just off the point of a good sized ISLAND.
text: Jason shields his eyes with his hand. He gazes out at the

text: onto his head. The crown reads U.S.S. CONSTELLATION.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Ever been over there?
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: No sir.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: It's beautiful. Isn't an island anymore
dialog: though. It's a city. They have electric

speaker_heading: JASON

text: Jason seems to be digesting this.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: I a "harbor person"?
text: Matt hides a smile about to form.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Yep, Jason - we all are.
text: Jason is full of questions. Matt knows the answers and

speaker_heading: F
text: At the helm. His eye s inted from glare and cold. He cuts
text: back on the throttle s and heads for the winch.
text: GLOVED HANDS pull up a BLUE-GREEN BUOY and slide the MANILA
text: LINE into the WINCH.
text: A POT surfaces and Frank sets it "Doors up" on the edge. He
text: opens the doors. His hands work quickly and efficiently. He
text: tosses a SMALL CRAB back into the water, pulls out a LOBSTER
text: and measures the back. Too small. Then a nice sized LOBSTER
text: is pulled out - it's missing the SCISSOR CLAW. He hands it to
text: Matt. Baits the trap. Throws the winch and the next pot
dialog: surfaces.
text: Matt sits inside, Jason on his lap. He reaches into a WOODEN
text: BOX of RUBBER BANDS with a BANDING WRENCH and bands the
text: crustacean's remaining CRUNCHER CLAW.
text: Jason stares at the disfigured creature.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Oh boy you see what happened to
dialog: this poor fel ow?
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: .what?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Well, the trap has nylon nets called
dialog: heads--2 side heads at b ends, so the
text: lobster can crawl in. The "Bedroom" head
text: inside, holds the bait and keeps it from
dialog: escaping--you know the old saying "two's
dialog: company three-s a crowd"?
text: Jason nods.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Well{ it's like that. You get more than
text: two in a bedroom and chances are
dialog: something like this is going to happen.
dialog: That's why Frank can't leave these traps
dialog: for more than a day.
text: Matt holds up another Lobster and turns it belly-up. There
text: are black balls on both sides of the tail.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Now the older females like this of gal,
dialog: are the most dan erous - especially when
dialog: they're growin' eyries.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: Berries?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Eggs... .one of these can take out two
dialog: males easy - Then you wind up with
dialog: lobster you can't sell - and as for this
dialog: fine lady, she gets off easy, the state
dialog: says you have to let her go.
text: Matt throws her back in the water. Holds up the other one to Jason.
speaker_heading: TT
dialog: Can you handle this?
text: Jason nods.
speaker_heading: MATT
speaker_heading: (GENTLY)
dialog: You sure?
text: He really isn't. Matt hands it to him.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Go ahead now, put it in the tank.

scene_heading: EXT. FOWLER HOUSE - DAY

speaker_heading: DAVIS
dialog: In this case Strout's family was prepared to
