speaker_heading: C
dialog: I don't believe in heaven, but I have
dialog: this idea about it. Something I heard in
text: a song.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
dialog: 
dialog: White.
dialog: 
text: pristine, empty frame. Clean and peaceful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX'S VOICE
dialog: Heaven is a place where nothing ever
dialog: happens.
dialog: 
text: There's gentle motion in the blank frame, like swirling 16mm
text: grain. A RUMBLE starts to build, low but growing louder...
dialog: 
text: The grain moves faster, big chunks fluttering, now a dirty
text: dishwater grey. The RUMBLE becoming a HOWLING WIND.
dialog: 
text: Churning black water LAPS at the bottom of the frame...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HUDSON RIVER - DAWN
dialog: 
text: A blizzard, at the peak of its power. Visibility zero, New
text: York reduced to the hulking shapes of buildings on the banks.
text: MAX PAYNE thrashes in the water, a long way from shore.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX'S VOICE
dialog: There's an army of bodies under this
dialog: river. Criminals, people who ran out of
text: time, out of friends.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Chunks of ice float in the dirty water around him. Max's
text: body freezing, skin turning blue. Heavy winter clothes
text: saturating, like an anchor dragging him down...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX'S VOICE
dialog: The next time they drag this river,
dialog: they'll find me on the bottom with the
dialog: rest of them. And there won't be anybody
dialog: left to say I was different.
dialog: 
text: Max's face sinks below the surface...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
dialog: 
dialog: Nothing to orient us to the location, the time. Just a flash
text: of golden light filling the hall, warm as the river was cold.
text: Around a closed door, sunlight streams through the gaps...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEDROOM
dialog: 
text: A WOMAN sleeps on the bed, curled up around a bundled BABY.
text: Is this the final, peaceful memory of a drowning man?
dialog: 
text: Something's wrong, then: the woman's body in an unnatural
text: position, more thrown than laid across the bed. The crib
text: tipped over, blankets scattered. Her eyes frozen open.
dialog: 
text: Something BLACK flutters against the window pane, CRACKING
text: into the glass. The sound of the BLIZZARD creeps in...
dialog: 
scene_heading: RESUME - HUDSON RIVER
dialog: 
text: Wind POUNDS the river where Max had once been, but there's no
text: more thrashing in the water. Mixed in behind the falling
text: snowflakes, BLACK SHAPES swirl and dive closer to the water.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX'S VOICE
dialog: I could feel the dead down there, just
text: below my feet. Reaching up to welcome me
dialog: as one of their own.
dialog: 
text: Max breaks the surface - GASPING, STRUGGLING against the
text: undertow. Not simply trying to breathe...trying to swim.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX'S VOICE
dialog: It was an easy mistake to make.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET (NYC) - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Abruptly, the snow is gone. Just a bitter wind left in its
text: place, whipping through desolate streets long after midnight.
text: Shuffling up the littered sidewalk, three rough-looking MEN
text: duck out of the wind by descending down to the subway...
dialog: 
text: On the dark side of the street, a pair of BOOTS follows them.
dialog: 
scene_heading: TITLE CARD: ONE WEEK EARLIER
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ROSCOE ST. STATION - DAY
dialog: 
text: A filthy platform, empty except for the three Men huddled on
text: a bench. A squeaking TURNSTILE catches their ear...
dialog: 
text: The same boots grind towards the Men. We don't see the
text: walker's face, distracted by something else: a gleaming gold
text: wristwatch. As if to make certain the Men notice, he pulls
text: back his sleeve to check the time. Quarter past three...
dialog: 
text: The watch glints as it passes into a dark doorway marked
text: `MEN'S.' The Men follow, exchanging wicked grins. Too easy.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SUBWAY BATHROOM
dialog: 
text: The Men slink into the bathroom, smirking at their oblivious
text: prey at the sink. Steam rising, he sets the watch on the
text: edge of the sink before washing his hands...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN #1
dialog: Hey, that's a really nice watch.
dialog: 
text: No answer. One of the Men LOCKS the door. At the sound of
text: the lock SNAPPING, he raises his head...
dialog: 
text: Max Payne, but not yet the man struggling for life in the
text: river: clean-shaven, skin like bleached bone. Haunted eyes.
text: In the murky mirror, Max sees the Men circling closer...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN #1
dialog: (drooling over the watch)
dialog: Kinda reminds me of one I lost--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You didn't lose it. You pawned it up on
dialog: 128th a few hours ago.
dialog: 
text: Max shuts off the water and calmly turns to face them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (nodding to Man #2)
dialog: Ask Doug. He was there with you.
dialog: 
text: Doug frowns, deeply confused about being called by his name.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: You've been following us all night?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No.
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: I'm only following you.
dialog: 
text: While Doug digests that, PAWNSHOP pulls a pistol and trains
text: it on Max's forehead. The third man - not much more than a
text: KID, visibly frightened - backs towards the door.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAWNSHOP
dialog: You a cop, or something?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Not tonight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAWNSHOP
dialog: Too bad.
dialog: (to Doug)
dialog: Go get my watch.
dialog: 
text: Distractedly eyeballing Max, Doug brushes the watch off of
text: the sink. It hits the dirty tile, delicate crystal CRACKING.
dialog: 
text: In a sudden blur of movement, Max has one hand on the pistol,
text: the other one SMASHING into Pawnshop's windpipe...
dialog: 
text: Doug steps forward to help... BOOM! The pistol goes off as
text: Max pries it free. Max looks up at Doug. Nowhere to run, he
text: races into the farthest stall and SLAMS the door.
dialog: 
text: In the same instant, the Kid bolts for the door. Max has to
dialog: pick: follow or stay with the man he's tracking...
dialog: 
text: In the stall, Doug crawls on his stomach across the sticky
text: floor, trying to squeeze under the divider. Max raises the
text: pistol and BLASTS a hole through the door of the next stall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (craving, eyes closed)
dialog: Watch over me, watch over me...
dialog: 
text: The newly-perforated door flies open. Handcuffs SNAP,
text: restraining a WHIMPERING Doug to the toilet pipe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Open your eyes, now.
dialog: 
text: Doug finds himself staring at the pistol's front sight. Max
text: reaches into his pocket and produces a tattered photograph...
text: It's the woman from Max's golden vision in the river.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Have you ever seen her before?
dialog: 
text: Doug shakes his head violently, confusion and terror rising.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You got busted robbing a house in New
dialog: Jersey with William Preston three--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Bill's dead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: That's why I'm talking to you.
dialog: (moving the photo closer)
dialog: Did he ever say anything about this
dialog: woman? Did you ever hear anyone--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Bill died because their wings couldn't
text: lift him up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No, he got shot robbing a liquor store.
dialog: What are you talking about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (incoherent, rambling)
text: Their wings are golden, the feathers only
dialog: look black...
dialog: 
text: Sighing, Max unlocks Doug from the pipe, hauling him up and
text: slamming into the wall as he cuffs his hands behind his back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLATFORM
dialog: 
text: Max stalks out of the bathroom, pushing Doug ahead of him.
text: Down on the tracks, the Kid shrinks into the shadows...
dialog: 
scene_heading: SUBWAY TUNNEL
dialog: 
text: The Kid runs down the dark tracks, nervously glancing back at
text: the receding light of the platform. He slows gradually,
text: relaxing as escape seems certain.
dialog: 
text: Down to a walk, he startles at movement in the tunnel ahead:
text: FLAPPING WINGS - a bird, lost and trapped underground?
dialog: 
text: The Kid freezes, his frightened BREATHS almost enough to
text: drown the sound out. It grows, though, more WINGS joining...
dialog: 
text: He turns to retreat up the tracks, but the WINGS suddenly
text: seem to be echoing towards him from all directions.
dialog: 
text: Panicked, the Kid becomes disoriented in the growing RACKET,
text: the tunnel ahead begins to glow brighter as he spins...
dialog: 
text: Visible now in the growing light, BLACK SHAPES flicker above
text: the tracks - dozens becoming hundreds, swelling larger, their
text: POUNDING wings joined by a train RUMBLING closer...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Frozen, the Kid can only squint into the headlights closing

scene_heading: NT. COLD CASE OFFICE - DAY
dialog: 
text: The front room of the cold case department is a mess - desks
text: piled high with paperwork and a week's worth of coffee cups.
dialog: 
text: Halfway in the front door, a young DETECTIVE stands holding a
text: box of his belongings. He looks around for signs of life.
text: SERGEANT ADAMS wanders down the hall, frowning at the draft.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SGT. ADAMS
dialog: You my new guy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: I didn't think anybody was here.

scene_heading: SGT. ADAMS

dialog: 
scene_heading: SGT. ADAMS
dialog: All the cold investigations in the city

dialog: We call each witness to see if they can
dialog: add anything to their original statement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: And if they can?
dialog: 
scene_heading: SGT. ADAMS
dialog: We send the file back to the original
dialog: precinct for follow-up. Don't get your
dialog: hopes up, though.
dialog: 
text: The Sergeant continues towards the center of the building,
text: farther from the light of the windows. He stops at a door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SGT. ADAMS
dialog: Once you've gone through the file and
dialog: come up empty, bring it here...
dialog: 
scene_heading: FILE ROOM/MAX'S OFFICE
dialog: 
text: They enter a windowless cave, long rows of metal cabinets

dialog: 
scene_heading: SGT. ADAMS
dialog: Nope, we don't do that down here.
dialog: 
text: iscretely, Max slides his cut-up knuckles under the desk...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: I don't understand, then how--
dialog: 
scene_heading: SGT. ADAMS
dialog: How do you solve that unsolvable murder

speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: The grand jury couldn't find--

scene_heading: SGT. ADAMS
dialog: Stop. Trust me, there's a tragic story
dialog: behind why I'm here giving you this tour.
dialog: We all did something, so just save it.
dialog: (moving for the door)
dialog: Follow me to the break room...
dialog: 
text: The Detective turns to Max, embarrassed after his reprimand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: We should get a beer after work, or
dialog: something...
dialog: 
text: Max smiles and nods, but his eyes give him away as a liar:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah. Maybe so.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLWAY
dialog:

scene_heading: SGT. ADAMS
dialog: ust...try to leave him alone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX'S OFFICE
dialog: 
text: Max sneaks a sideways glance to the door, watching Adams lead

dialog: 
text: ax goes to a rusted cabinet and buries the file deep inside.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A lock POPS. Max steps inside, only silence to greet him.
dialog: 
text: Max lays his jacket across the back of a worn leather chair,
text: footsteps REVERBERATING because there's little other
text: furniture to absorb the sound. He keeps walking...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KITCHEN
dialog: 
text: ...past a table with one chair, past gleaming counters. Max
text: fills a glass of water from the tap. Eyes blank, patient.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
dialog: 
text: Carefully, Max rests the full glass on the arm of the chair.
text: Reaching underneath the chair, Max produces an artist's
text: sketchbook and places it delicately on the table before him.
dialog: 
text: Sith trembling hands, Max turns back the battered cover...
text: uddenly, colors burst into the monochrome room: bright
text: swirls of oil pastels sketch out a still life in Technicolor.
dialog: 
text: Gradually, Max's eyes lose their hardness. His breaths come
text: FASTER, ragged. Jaw clenched, he turns the page...

dialog: 
text: He takes hold of the corner of the page, but his muscles
text: won't cooperate - as if the page ways more than Max can lift.
dialog: 
text: Max's skin flushes red...tears almost welling...
dialog: 
text: And then at once, Max slams the book shut and turns away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSET
dialog: 
text: The door swings open. Hanging inside, the battered coat we
text: saw Max wear in the subway. A pistol on a hook by the door.
text: Urban armor, scarred by countless nights of service.
dialog: 
text: Max dresses himself for battle, eyes returning to stone.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
dialog:

scene_heading: NT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY

speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: I thought you found Bill's partner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: ATASHA

speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Thank you. It's...
dialog: (glancing past Max)
dialog: Shit.
dialog: 
text: Max follows her gaze to the front door, where Trevor is
text: nervously greeting another new arrival: MONA SAX. She's
text: striking, beautiful but also a little frightening. It
text: doesn't hurt that she's flanked by BODYGUARDS. Russian Mob.
dialog: 
text: Seeing Natasha standing with Max, Mona barrels across the
text: room towards them. People stand aside to let her pass.
dialog: 
text: ithout preamble, Mona begins YELLING at Natasha in Russian.
text: Natasha RESPONDS in kind, clearly intimidated by Mona.
dialog: 
text: Abruptly, Mona grabs Natasha's arm, jerking her off balance.

dialog: I
text: t happens in a flash: Mona spins and takes hold of Max's
text: arm. Incredibly, he's just as fast, slipping free of the
dialog: grip that would surely have snapped his wrist...
dialog: 
text: For a moment, Max and Mona stare each other down. Surprised,
text: reevaluating each other. Natasha continues to TALK, her
text: Russian anxious as Mona's bodyguards push through the crowd.
dialog: 
text: Mona's eyes drop to Max's chest, where the tussle pulled his
text: coat open to reveal a low-pro holster and tarnished badge.
dialog: 
text: With the flick of her wrist, Mona stops her guards' advance.
dialog: 
text: The crowd begins to notice the altercation. Natasha keeps
text: TALKING, trying desperately to make peace and reassure Mona
text: of something. Mona's eyes cut between Natasha and Max...
dialog: 
text: till apprehensive, Mona shakes her head and walks away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: My sister.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Sort of a bitch.
dialog: 
text: As Max nods at the understatement, Trevor rushes over,
text: forcing a broad smile to reassure his guests. He pulls Max's

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: You have to go. Now.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Quick glimpses in the candle light, bare flesh writhing.
text: Cast on the walls, corresponding shadows twist and shift...
dialog: 
text: A black feather billows across the floor between candles.
text: Spreading up the wall, a new shadow rises above the rest...
dialog:

dialog: 
text: ax moves up the street, steam rising from his clothes as
text: they dry from the heat of his skin. Sweat beads on his face.
dialog: 
text: Max enters Asgard's courtyard, the Gothic facade rising high
text: above. He passes through its security lights, shadow casting
text: down onto the clean white snow like a projection screen...
dialog: 
text: Invisible to the naked eye, more shadows of winged shapes
text: dart and swoop in the air above Max's outline on the snow.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BB
text: Bravura called in the Feds.
dialog: 
text: BB storms for the door, surprised to turn back and see that

dialog: or God's sake, come on. Max is dead,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE SALLE
text: He's not dead. He's here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BB
dialog: Bullshit. There's no way--
dialog: 
text: At that moment, they both see movement in the shadows...
dialog: 
text: Max steps forward into the light - soaked in blood up to his
text: elbows, eyes black and animalistic. No longer himself.
dialog: 
text: oe Salle reaches for his pistol. With freakish reflexes,
text: Max raises one of the guard's machine guns and OPENS FIRE.
dialog: 
text: BB and Salle fall back, diving into an ancient elevator car.
text: Slugs ricocheting, BB and Salle struggle to shut the doors.
dialog: 
text: From Max's POV: as the elevator doors slam shut, a glimpse of
text: BB's face stretching and distorting into a demonic grin...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELEVATOR
dialog: 
text: BB and Salle watch the floor number rise. BB finds his cell.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE SALLE
dialog: Who are you calling?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BB
dialog: Her.
dialog:

speaker_heading: NICOLE HORNE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLWAY
dialog: 
text: Max turns the corner into a long hallway of prison-like
text: offices. Emergency lights flicker through barred windows...
dialog: 
text: A group of GUARDS look up and see Max at the same moment.
text: Max is without hesitation, SHOOTING two before they can raise
text: their weapons. Falling back, the others start FIRING...
speaker_heading: S
text: uddenly, an office down the hall bursts to life - a ROAR of
text: flapping wings, light from the window strobing with movement.
dialog: 
text: Max doesn't seek cover, walking into BLAZING machine guns...
dialog: 
text: One by one, all the offices FLICKER with fluttering wings.
text: Max marches on, rage-filled eyes set in a lifeless face...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARMORY
dialog: 
text: Guards empty the weapons lockers, loading for bear as the
text: sounds of GUNFIRE grow closer. BB and Salle supervise.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BB
dialog: Take some C4, wire it so he can't make it

speaker_heading: CORRIDOR
dialog: 
text: Max FIRES, plaster from shattered walls caking on his sweat-

text: black eyes, the flames glowing brighter as he advances...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREAT HALL
dialog: 
text: ...into the vast, open space at the heart of the building.
text: GUARDS appear at the other end of the hallway, OPENING UP.
text: Their SHOTS echo, the great room ringing like a cave.
dialog: 
text: Max lifts his eyes - what had been four stories now seems
text: like forty, the top not visible behind hazy black smoke.
dialog: 
text: Bullets WHISTLE past Max's ear. Distracted, he RETURNS FIRE,
text: but his eyes are drawn back to the black smoke above.
text: SOMETHING moves in the clouds, swirling closer...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAIRWELL
dialog: 
text: More Guards THUNDER up steps littered with spent casings. In
text: their haste, they don't notice the thin gap in one window...
dialog: 
text: LENDER FINGERS slip in with the swirling snow, opening it...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREAT HALL (MAX'S POV)
dialog: 
text: Crashing back into Max's perspective, a RUSHING WIND presses
text: down from the black clouds above, the darkness spreading.
text: Max's legs buckle, his machine gun scattering SHOTS...
dialog: 
text: The room goes darker as it gets louder, light blotted out by
text: WINGED CREATURES drifting down from above, circling closer...
dialog: 
text: Max stumbles, buffeted by their POUNDING WINGS. CHOKING on
text: sulfurous smoke, hair smoldering, skin starting to singe...
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANOTHER HALLWAY

dialog: 
scene_heading: GREAT HALL - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: ...and the frightened Guards charge into the great room.
dialog: 
text: It is silent. Smokeless. Just a hall. Blood streaks the
text: walls, flows between the crumpled carcasses of more dead
text: GUARDS. At the far end of the hall, something moves:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Max. On his hands and knees, rivers of sweat flowing.
text: Confused, the group of Guards approach Max. Weapons ready.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAX'S HALLUCINATION
dialog: 
text: Crushed inside the DEAFENING blackness, Max lifts his eyes to
text: see LEERING DEMONS gazing down, distorted versions of...
dialog: 
scene_heading: GREAT HALL - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: ...the four Guards, who look down on Max's trembling, sweat-
text: logged body on the floor. He's MUTTERING, CHANTING...
dialog: 
text: So easy it almost doesn't seem fair, a Guard aims his pistol.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, bullets RIP through the Guards from behind. No
text: chance to respond, bodies torn open with a merciless BLAST of
text: machine gun fire. They fall around Max, joining the rest.
dialog: 
text: Gun smoking, Mona rushes up the hallway to Max.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAX'S HALLUCINATION
dialog: 
text: The Demons fade away, their howling SCREAMS lingering behind.
text: Awaiting the next horror, Max is shocked by something else:
text: White light splits open the smoke, cutting the black in two.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREAT HALL
dialog: 
text: Mona kneels down over Max, lifting up his head. Max's skin
text: is pale, slick like melting wax. His eyes are empty.
dialog: 
text: There's nothing gentle in her touch - she SLAMS Max's head
text: back onto the cold marble, jerking him up again by his hair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Max!
dialog: 
text: Gradually, Max's black eyes start to find Mona's face.
speaker_heading: M
scene_heading: AX'S HALLUCINATION
dialog: 
text: The white light grows brighter, blasting away shadows and
text: smoke. In its center, traces of Mona's face appear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREAT HALL
dialog: 
text: Max starts to sit up, gazing with confusion at the hallway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: You don't have much time.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Max nods. No idea if he understands, Mona helps him up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: I'll do what I can to slow them down, but
dialog: you have to hurry.
dialog: 
text: Max looks back at Mona, clearly having some idea of what that
text: means for her. They look at each other for a long moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: You're not done yet.

scene_heading: EXT. ASGARD BUILDING - ROOF - DAWN

scene_heading: INT. ASGARD BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAWN
dialog: 
text: Joe Salle kneels over a pile of C4 bricks, wiring a bomb. He
text: tenses, hearing something in the hall behind him. Raising
text: his hands and turning slowly, he finds Mona waiting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Where's the detonator?
dialog: 
text: Slowly, Salle holds it out for Mona. She grabs the remote.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE SALLE
dialog: There's more like this all over. Even if
dialog: the building doesn't collapse, this floor
text: is gone.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Careful with that thing, is what I'm
dialog: saying. I'm sure you and I can work
dialog: something out.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, BOOT STEPS ring up the hallway behind Mona.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UARDS
dialog: Drop your weapon!
dialog: 
text: Salle smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BB'S OFFICE
dialog: 
text: Max staggers through the door to BB's office. Out the big
text: windows, the East River begins to glow with approaching dawn.
dialog: 
text: ax scans the room for BB, his vision still plagued by
text: flickering shadows, hallucinations receding but not yet gone.
text: He pauses at the glass, caught by his twisted reflection.
dialog: 
text: ax can see his own wings.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLWAY
dialog: 
text: Salle holds out his hand for the detonator. Behind Mona,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE SALLE
dialog: (to the Guards)
text: Hurry, Max's already upstairs.
dialog: (to Mona, frustrated)
dialog: Just hand it over.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOE SALLE
dialog: B's done for, but this thing doesn't
dialog: have to stop. I'm his number two, and
dialog: somebody has to take over for Lupino.
dialog: Like I said, we can work something out.
dialog: 
text: Ever so casually, Mona takes a step back onto the elevator.

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ASGARD BUILDING - ROOFTOP - DAWN - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: A shower of bullets strikes the doors as he steps outside.

dialog: 
text: cross the roof, BB keeps FIRING until his pistol CLICKS. BB

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BB
dialog: It's unbelievable. All that snow, and...
dialog: Watch it end up being a beautiful day.
dialog: 
text: ritting his teeth, Max struggles to his knees. Blood rushes

dialog: 
text: earing Max's effort, BB turns away from the empty sky.
text: Using the pistol as a crutch, Max finally stands...

speaker_heading: BB
dialog: Just get to it, already. That's all I

dialog: 
text: With the pain in his stomach causing some difficulty, Max

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BB
dialog: But I want you to listen to me, first.
dialog: Just try to hear what--
dialog: 
text: Max raises the pistol and PULLS THE TRIGGER. The slug hits
text: BB in the center of the forehead, snapping his neck back.
dialog: 
text: The shell casing twirls down, landing in the snow without a

dialog: 
text: Max lets the gun slip out of his hand and walks past the body
