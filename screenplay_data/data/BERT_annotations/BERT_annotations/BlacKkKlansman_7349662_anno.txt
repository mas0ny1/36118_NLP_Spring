dialog: ...I'm here to tell you this evening
dialog: it is time for you to stop running
dialog: away from being Black. You are
dialog: College Students, you should think.
speaker_heading: KWAME TURE (CONT'D)
dialog: It is time for you to understand that
dialog: you as The growing Intellectuals of

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK MASS

dialog: 
text: The Black Students in The Audience are laser focused on him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KWAME TURE
dialog: Is Beauty defined by someone with a
dialog: Narrow Nose? Thin Lips? White Skin?
dialog: You ain't got none of that. If your
dialog: Lips are Thick, Bite them in. Hold
dialog: your Nose! Don't drink Coffee because
dialog: it makes you Black!
dialog: 
dialog: The Audience laughs! Loving it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KWAME TURE (CONT'D)
dialog: Your Nose is Boss, your Lips are

dialog: 
dialog: Everyone cheers including Ron!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KWAME TURE (CONT'D)
dialog: We want to be like The White people
dialog: that oppress us in this Country and
dialog: since they hate us, we hate
dialog: ourselves. You dig Tarzan? I remember
dialog: that when I was a Boy I used to go
dialog: see Tarzan Movies on Saturdays. I
dialog: loved me some Jane too. Jane was A
dialog: Fine White Woman. White Tarzan used
dialog: to Beat up The Black Natives. I would
dialog: sit there yelling "Kill The Beasts,
dialog: Kill The Savages, Kill 'Em!" Actually
dialog: I was saying: "Kill Me." It was as if
dialog: a Jewish Boy watched Nazis taking
text: Jews off to Concentration Camps and
dialog: cheered them on. Today, I want The
dialog: Chief to beat The Hell out of Tarzan
dialog: and send him back to The Caves of
dialog: Europe. But it takes time to become
dialog: Free of The Lies and their shaming
dialog: effect on Black Minds. It takes time
dialog: to reject the most Important Lie:
dialog: that Black People inherently can't do
dialog: the same things White People can do
dialog: unless White People help them.
text: The Audience laughing, overwhelmed, shouting back support! A
text: ROAR from The Crowd. Ron finds himself clapping along.

dialog: 
text: Ron looks around at everyone caught up in Kwame's spell.

speaker_heading: KWAME TURE (CONT'D)
dialog: If a White Man wants to Lynch Me,
dialog: that's his Problem. If he's got The
dialog: Power to Lynch Me, that's My Problem.
dialog: Racism is not a question of Attitude;
dialog: it's a question of Power.
dialog: 
text: Ron is struck by the remark.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KWAME TURE (CONT'D)
dialog: The vast majority of Negroes in this
dialog: Country live in Captive Communities
dialog: and must endure their conditions of
dialog: Oppression because and only because
dialog: they are Black and Powerless. Now We
text: are being shot down like Dogs in the
dialog: streets by White Racist Police. We
dialog: can no longer accept this Oppression
dialog: without retribution. The War in
dialog: Vietnam is Illegal and Immoral. I'd
dialog: rather see a Brother Kill a Cop than
dialog: Kill a Vietnamese. At least he's got
dialog: a reason for Killing The Cop. When
dialog: you Kill a Vietnamese you're a Hero
dialog: and you don't even know why you
dialog: Killed him. At least if you Kill a
dialog: Cop you're doing it for a reason.
