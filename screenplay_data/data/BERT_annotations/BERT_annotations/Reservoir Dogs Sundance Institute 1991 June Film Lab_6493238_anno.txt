scene_heading: 1 INT. UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - MORNING
text: Eight men dressed in BLACK SUITS, sit around a table at a
text: breakfast cafe. They are MR. WHITE, MR. PINK, MR. BLUE,
scene_heading: MR. BLONDE, MR. ORANGE, MR. BROWN, NICE GUY EDDIE CABOT,
text: and the big boss, JOE CABOT. Most are finished eating and
text: are enjoying coffee and conversation. Joe flips through a
text: small address book. Mr. Pink is telling a long and
dialog: involved story about Madonna.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: "Like a Virgin" is all about a
text: girl who digs a guy with a big
dialog: dick. The whole song is a
dialog: metaphor for big dicks.
speaker_heading: MR. BLUE
dialog: No it's not. It's about a girl
dialog: who is very vulnerable and she's
dialog: been fucked over a few times.
text: Then she meets some guy who's
dialog: really sensitive--
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: --Whoa...whoa...time out Greenbay.
dialog: Tell that bullshit to the
dialog: tourists.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (looking through his
dialog: address book)
dialog: Toby...who the fuck is Toby?
dialog: Toby...Toby...think...think...
dialog: think...
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: It's not about a nice girl who
text: meets a sensitive boy. Now
dialog: granted that's what "True Blue" is
dialog: about, no argument about that.
speaker_heading: MR. ORANGE
dialog: Which one is "True Blue?"
speaker_heading: NICE GUY EDDIE
dialog: You don't remember "True Blue?"
dialog: That was a big ass hit for
dialog: Madonna. Shit, I don't even
dialog: follow this Tops In Pops shit, and
dialog: I've at least heard of "True
dialog: Blue."
speaker_heading: MR. ORANGE
dialog: Look, asshole, I didn't say I
dialog: ain't heard of it. All I asked
dialog: was how does it go? Excuse me
dialog: for not being the world's biggest
dialog: Madonna fan.
speaker_heading: MR. BROWN
dialog: I hate Madonna.
speaker_heading: MR. BLUE
dialog: I like her early stuff. You know,
dialog: "Lucky Star," "Borderline" - but
dialog: once she got into her "Papa Don't
dialog: Preach" phase, I don't know, I
dialog: tuned out.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Hey, fuck all that, I'm
dialog: making a point here. You're gonna
dialog: make me lose my train
dialog: of thought.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh fuck, Toby's that little china
dialog: girl.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I found this old address book in a
dialog: jacket I ain't worn in a coon's
dialog: age. Toby what? What the fuck
dialog: was her last name?
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Where was I?
speaker_heading: MR. ORANGE
dialog: You said "True Blue" was about a
text: nice girl who finds a sensitive
dialog: fella. But "Like a Virgin" was a
dialog: metaphor for big dicks.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Let me tell ya what "Like a
dialog: Virgin"'s about. It's about some
dialog: cooze who's a regular fuck
dialog: machine.
dialog: I mean all the time, morning, day,
dialog: night, afternoon, dick, dick,
dialog: dick, dick, dick,
dialog: dick, dick, dick, dick, dick,
dialog: dick.
speaker_heading: MR. BLUE
dialog: How many dicks was that?
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: A lot.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
text: Then one day she meets a John
dialog: Holmes motherfucker, and it's
dialog: like, whoa baby. This mother
dialog: fucker's like Charles Bronson in
dialog: "The Great Escape." He's diggin
dialog: tunnels. Now she's gettin this
dialog: serious dick action, she's feelin
dialog: something she ain't felt since
dialog: forever. Pain.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Chew? Toby Chew? No.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: It hurts. It hurts her. It
dialog: shouldn't hurt. Her pussy should
dialog: be Bubble-Yum by now. But when
dialog: this cat fucks her, it hurts. It
dialog: hurts like the first time. The
dialog: pain is reminding a fuck machine
dialog: what is was like to be a virgin.
dialog: Hence, "Like a Virgin."
text: The fellas crack up.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Wong?
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What
dialog: the fuck do you know about it
dialog: anyway? You're still listening to
dialog: Jerry-fucking-Vale.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong! You
dialog: know, like the Chinese name?
text: Mr. White snatches the address book from Joe's hand. They
text: fight, but they're not really mad at each other.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Give me this fucking thing.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What the fuck do you think you're
dialog: doin? Give me my book back!
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: I'm sick of fuckin hearin it Joe,
dialog: I'll give it back when we leave.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Whaddaya mean, give it to me when
dialog: we leave, give it back now.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: For the past fifteen minutes now,
dialog: you've just been droning on with
dialog: names. "Toby...Toby...Toby...
dialog: Toby Wong...Toby Wong...Toby
dialog: Chung...fuckin Charlie Chan." I
dialog: got Madonna's big dick outta my
dialog: right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-
dialog: know-what, outta my left.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What do you care?
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: When you're annoying as hell, I
dialog: care a lot.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Give me my book.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: You gonna put it away?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do
dialog: with it.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna
dialog: have to keep it.
speaker_heading: MR. BLONDE
dialog: Joe, you want me to shoot him for
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you
dialog: better wake up and apologize.
speaker_heading: NICE GUY EDDIE
dialog: Have you guys been listening to K-
text: BILLY's super sounds of the
dialog: seventies weekend?
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Yeah, it's fuckin great isn't it?
speaker_heading: NICE GUY EDDIE
dialog: Can you believe the songs they
dialog: been playin?
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: No, I can't. You know what I
dialog: heard the other day? "Heartbeat -
dialog: It's Lovebeat," by little Tony
dialog: DeFranco and the DeFranco Family.
dialog: I haven't heard that since I was
dialog: in fifth fuckin grade.
speaker_heading: NICE GUY EDDIE
dialog: When I was coming down here, I was
dialog: playin it. And "The Night the
dialog: Lights Went Out in Georgia" came
dialog: on. Now I ain't heard that song
dialog: since it was big, but when it was
dialog: big, I heard it a million-
dialog: trillion times. I'm listening to
dialog: it this morning, and this was the
dialog: first time I ever realized that
dialog: the lady singing the song, was the
dialog: one who killed Andy.
speaker_heading: MR. BLUE
dialog: You didn't know Vicki Lawrence
dialog: killed the guy?
speaker_heading: NICE GUY EDDIE
dialog: I thought the cheatin wife shot
dialog: Andy.
speaker_heading: MR. BLONDE
text: They say it in the song.
speaker_heading: NICE GUY EDDIE
dialog: I know, I heard it. I musta zoned
dialog: out whenever that part came on
dialog: before. I thought when she said
dialog: that little sister stuff, she was
dialog: talkin about her sister- in-law,
dialog: the cheatin wife.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No, she did it. She killed the
dialog: cheatin wife, too.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: You know the part in "Gypsies,
dialog: Tramps and Theives," when she says
dialog: "Poppa woulda shot his if he knew
dialog: what he'd done?" I could never
dialog: figure out what he did.
text: The table laughs. The WAITRESS comes over to the table.
text: She has the check, and a pot of coffee.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Can I get anybody more
dialog: coffee.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No, we're gonna be hittin it.
dialog: I'll take care of the check.
text: She hands the bill to him.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Here ya go. Please pay at the
dialog: register, if you wouldn't mind.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Sure thing.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: You guys have a wonderful day.
text: They all mutter equivalents. She exits and Joe stands up.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'll take care of this, you guys
dialog: leave the tip.
dialog: (to Mr. White)
dialog: And when I come back, I want my
dialog: book back.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Sorry, it's my book now.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Blonde, shoot this piece of shit,
dialog: will ya?
text: Mr. Blonde shoots Mr. White with his finger. Mr White
text: acts shot. Joe exits.
speaker_heading: NICE GUY EDDIE
dialog: Okay, everybody cough up green for
dialog: the little lady.
text: Everybody whips out a buck, and throws it on the table.
dialog: Everybody, that is, except Mr. White.
speaker_heading: NICE GUY EDDIE
dialog: C'mon, throw in a buck.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Uh-uh. I don't tip.
speaker_heading: NICE GUY EDDIE
dialog: Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: I don't believe in it.
speaker_heading: NICE GUY EDDIE
dialog: You don't believe in tipping?
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: I love this kid, he's a madman,
dialog: this guy.
speaker_heading: MR. BLONDE
dialog: Do you have any idea what these
dialog: ladies make? They make shit.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Don't give me that. She don't
dialog: make enough money, she can quit.
text: Everybody laughs.
speaker_heading: NICE GUY EDDIE
dialog: I don't even know a Jew who'd have
dialog: the balls to say that. So let's
dialog: get this straight. You never ever
dialog: tip?
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: I don't tip because society says I
dialog: gotta. I tip when somebody
dialog: deserves a tip. When somebody
dialog: really puts forth an effort, they
dialog: deserve a little something extra.
dialog: But this tipping automatically,
dialog: that shit's for the birds. As far
dialog: as I'm concerned, they're just
dialog: doin their job.
speaker_heading: MR. BLUE
dialog: Our girl was nice.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Our girl was okay. She didn't do
dialog: anything special.
speaker_heading: MR. BLONDE
dialog: What's something special, take ya
dialog: in the kitchen and suck your dick?
text: They all laugh.
speaker_heading: NICE GUY EDDIE
dialog: I'd go over twelve percent for
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: MR. WRITE
dialog: Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've
dialog: been here a long fuckin time, and
dialog: she's only filled my cup three
dialog: times. When I order coffee, I
dialog: want it filled six times.
speaker_heading: MR. BLONDE
dialog: What if she's too busy?
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: The words "too busy" shouldn't be
text: in a waitress's vocabulary.
speaker_heading: NICE GUY EDDIE
dialog: Excuse me, Mr. White, but the last
dialog: thing you need is another cup of
dialog: coffee.
text: They all laugh.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: These ladies aren't starvin to
dialog: death. They make minimum wage.
dialog: When I worked for minimum wage, I
dialog: wasn't lucky enough to have a job
dialog: that society deemed tipworthy.
speaker_heading: NICE GUY EDDIE
dialog: Ahh, now we're getting down to it.
dialog: It's not just that he's a cheap
dialog: bastard--
speaker_heading: MR. ORANGE
dialog: --It is that too--
speaker_heading: NICE GUY EDDIE
dialog: --It is that too. But it's also
dialog: he couldn't get a waiter job. You
dialog: talk like a pissed off dishwasher:
dialog: "Fuck those cunts and their
dialog: fucking tips."
speaker_heading: MR. BLONDE
dialog: So you don't care that they're
dialog: counting on your tip to live?
text: Mr. White rubs two of his fingers together.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Do you know what this is? It's
dialog: the world's smallest violin,
text: playing just for the waitresses.
speaker_heading: MR. BLONDE
dialog: You don't have any idea what
dialog: you're talking about. These
dialog: people bust their ass. This
dialog: is a hard job.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: So's working at McDonald's, but
dialog: you don't feel the need to tip
dialog: them. They're servin ya food, you
dialog: should tip em. But no, society
dialog: says tip these guys over here, but
dialog: not those guys over there. That's
dialog: bullshit.
speaker_heading: MR. ORANGE
dialog: They work harder than the kids at
dialog: McDonald's.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Oh yeah, I don't see them cleaning
dialog: fryers.
speaker_heading: MR. BROWN
dialog: These people are taxed on the tips
dialog: they make. When you stiff 'em,
dialog: you cost them money.
speaker_heading: MR. BLONDE
dialog: Waitressing is the number one
dialog: occupation for female non-college
dialog: graduates in this country. It's
dialog: the one jab basically any woman
dialog: can get, and make a living on.
dialog: The reason is because of tips.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Fuck all that.
text: They all laugh.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Hey, I'm very sorry that the
dialog: government taxes their tips.
dialog: That's fucked up. But that ain't
dialog: my fault. it would appear that
dialog: waitresses are just one of the
dialog: many groups the government fucks
dialog: in the ass on a regular basis.
dialog: You show me a paper says the
dialog: government shouldn't do that, I'll
dialog: sign it. Put it to a vote, I'll
dialog: vote for it. But what I won't do
dialog: is play ball. And this non-
dialog: college bullshit you're telling
dialog: me, I got two words for that:
dialog: "Learn to fuckin type." Cause if
dialog: you're expecting me to help out
dialog: with the rent, you're in for a big
dialog: fuckin surprise.
speaker_heading: MR. ORANGE
dialog: He's convinced me. Give me my
dialog: dollar back.
text: Everybody laughs. Joe's comes back to the table.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Okay ramblers, let's get to
dialog: rambling. Wait a minute, who
dialog: didn't throw in?
speaker_heading: MR. ORANGE
dialog: Mr. White.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (to Mr. Orange)
dialog: Mr. White?
dialog: (to Mr. White)
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MR. ORANGE
dialog: He don't tip.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (to Mr. Orange)
dialog: He don't tip?
dialog: (to Mr. White)
dialog: You don't tip? Why?
speaker_heading: MR. ORANGE
dialog: He don't believe in it.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (to Mr. Orange)
dialog: He don't believe in it?
dialog: (to Mr. White)
dialog: You don't believe in it?
speaker_heading: MR. ORANGE
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (to Mr. Orange)
dialog: Shut up!
dialog: (to Mr. White)
dialog: Cough up the buck, ya cheap
dialog: bastard, I paid for your goddamn
dialog: breakfast.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Because you paid for the
dialog: breakfast, I'm gonna tip.
dialog: Normally I wouldn't.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Whatever. Just throw in your
dialog: dollar, and let's move.
dialog: (to Mr. Blonde)
dialog: See what I'm dealing with here.
dialog: Infants. I'm fuckin dealin with
dialog: infants.
text: The eight men get up to leave. Mr. White's waist is in
text: the F.G. As he buttons his coat, for a second we see he's
text: carrying a gun. They exit Uncle Bob's Pancake House,
text: talking amongst themselves.
scene_heading: 2 EXT. UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - DAY
scene_heading: CREDIT SEQUENCE:
text: When the credit sequence is finished, we FADE TO BLACK:
text: Over the BLACK we hear the sound of SOMEONE SCREAMING in
dialog: agony.
text: Under the screaming, we hear the sound of a car HAULING
text: ASS, through traffic.
text: Over the screams and the traffic noise, we hear SOMEBODY
speaker_heading: ELSE SAY:
speaker_heading: SOMEBODY ELSE (OS)
dialog: Just hold on buddy boy.
text: Somebody stops screaming long enough to say:
speaker_heading: SOMEBODY (OS)
dialog: I'm sorry. I can't believe
dialog: she killed me. Who would've
dialog: fuckin thought that?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 3 INT. GETAWAY GAR (MOVING) - DAY
text: The Somebody screaming is Mr. Orange. He lies in the
text: backseat. He's been SHOT in the stomach. BLOOD covers
text: both him and the backseat.
text: Mr. White is the Somebody Else. He's behind the wheel of
text: the getaway car. He's easily doing 80 mph, dodging in and
text: out of traffic. Though he's driving for his life, he
text: keeps talking to his wounded passenger in the backseat.
text: They are the only two in the car.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Hey, just cancel that shit right
dialog: now! You're hurt. You're hurt
dialog: really fucking bad, but you ain't
dialog: dying.
speaker_heading: MR. ORANGE
dialog: (crying)
dialog: All this blood is scaring the shit
dialog: outta me. I'm gonna die, I know
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you
dialog: had a degree in medicine. Are you
dialog: a doctor? Are you a doctor?
dialog: Answer me please, are you a
dialog: doctor?
speaker_heading: MR. ORANGE
dialog: No, I'm not!
speaker_heading: MR. WRITE
dialog: Ahhhh, so you admit you don't know
dialog: what you're talking about. So if
dialog: you're through giving me your
dialog: amateur opinion, lie back and
dialog: listen to the news. I'm taking
dialog: you back to the rendezvous, Joe's
dialog: gonna get you a doctor, the
dialog: doctor's gonna fix you up, and
dialog: you're gonna be okay. Now say it:
dialog: you're gonna be okay. Say it:
dialog: you're gonna be okay!
text: Mr. Orange doesn't respond. Mr. White starts pounding on
text: the steering wheel.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Say-the-goddamn-words: you're
dialog: gonna be okay!
speaker_heading: MR. ORANGE
dialog: I'm okay.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Correct.
scene_heading: 4 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
text: The CAMERA does a 360 around an empty warehouse. Then the
text: door swings open, and Mr. White carries the bloody body of
text: Mr. Orange inside.
text: Mr. Orange still is MOANING loudly from his bullet hit.
text: Mr. White lays him down upon a mattress on the floor.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on,
dialog: and wait for Joe. I can't do
dialog: anything for you, but when Joe
dialog: gets here, which should be anytime
dialog: now, he'll be able to help you.
dialog: We're just gonna sit here, and
dialog: wait for Joe. Who are
dialog: we waiting for?
speaker_heading: MR. ORANGE
dialog: Joe.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Bet your sweet ass we are.
text: Mr. White gets up from over Mr. Orange and starts to prowl
text: around the warehouse.
speaker_heading: MR. ORANGE
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Don't leave me!
text: Mr White bends back over him and takes his hand.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: I ain't going anywhere. I'm right
dialog: here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
speaker_heading: MR. ORANGE
dialog: Larry, I'm so scared, would you
dialog: please hold me.
text: Mr. White very gently embraces the bloody Mr. Orange.
text: Cradling the young man, Mr. White whispers to him.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Go ahead and be scared, you've
dialog: been brave enough for one day. I
dialog: want you to just relax now.
dialog: You're not gonna die, you're gonna
dialog: be fine. When Joe gets here,
dialog: he'll make ya a hundred percent
dialog: again.
text: Mr. White lays Mr. Orange back down on the mattress. He's
text: still holding his hand. Mr. Orange looks up at his
dialog: friend.
speaker_heading: MR. ORANGE
dialog: Look, I don't wanna be a fly in
dialog: the ointment, but if help doesn't
dialog: come soon, I gotta see a doctor.
dialog: I don't give a fuck about jail, I
dialog: just don't wanna die.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: You're not gonna fucking die, all
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: MR. ORANGE
dialog: I wasn't born yesterday. I'm
dialog: hurt, and I'm hurt bad.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: It's not good...
speaker_heading: MR. ORANGE
dialog: Hey, bless your heart for what
dialog: you're trying to do. I was
dialog: panicking for a moment, but I've
dialog: got my senses back now. The
dialog: situation is, I'm shot in the
dialog: belly. And without medical
dialog: attention, I'm gonna die.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: I can' take you to a hospital.
speaker_heading: MR. ORANGE
dialog: Fuck jail! I don't give a shit
dialog: about jail. But I can't die. You
dialog: don't have to take me in. Just
dialog: drive me up to the front, drop me
dialog: on the sidewalk. I'll take care
dialog: of myself. I won't tell them
dialog: anything. I swear to fucking god,
dialog: I won't tell 'em anything. Look
text: in my eyes, look right in my eyes.
dialog: (Mr. White does)
dialog: I-won't-tell-them-anything.
dialog: You'll be safe.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Lie back down, and try to--
speaker_heading: MR. ORANGE
dialog: I'm going to die! I need a
dialog: doctor! I'm begging you,
dialog: take me to a doctor.
dialog: 
text: Mr. Orange lays his head back on the mattress. Spent from
text: his outburst, he quietly mutters to himself:
speaker_heading: MR. ORANGE
dialog: Take me to a doctor, take me to a
dialog: doctor, please.
text: Suddenly, the warehouse door BURSTS open and Mr.
text: Pink steps inside.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Was that a fucking set-up or what?
text: Mr. Pink sees Mr. Orange on the floor, shot and bloody.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Oh fuck, Orange got tagged.
text: Throughout this scene, we hear Mr. Orange moaning.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Gun shot.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Oh that's just fucking great!
dialog: Where's Brown?
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Dead.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: How the fuck do you think? The
dialog: cops shot him.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Oh this is bad, this is so bad.
dialog: (referring to Mr.
dialog: Orange)
dialog: Is it bad?
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: As opposed to good?
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: This is so fucked up. Somebody
dialog: fucked us big time.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: You really think we were set up?
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: You even doubt it? I don't think
dialog: we got set up, I know we got set
dialog: up! I mean really, seriously,
dialog: where did all those cops come
dialog: from, huh? One minute they're not
dialog: there, the next minute
dialog: they're there. I didn't hear any
text: sirens. The alarm went off, okay.
dialog: Okay, when an alarm goes off, you
dialog: got an average of four minutes
dialog: response time. Unless a patrol
text: car is cruising that street, at
dialog: that particular moment, you got
text: four minutes before they can
text: realistically respond. In one
dialog: minute there were seventeen blue
dialog: boys out there. All loaded for
dialog: bear, all knowing exactly what the
dialog: fuck they were doing, and they
dialog: were all just there! Remember
dialog: that second wave that showed up in
dialog: the cars? Those were the ones
text: responding to the alarm. but
dialog: those other motherfuckers were
dialog: already there, they were waiting
dialog: for us.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You haven't thought about this?
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: I haven't had a chance to think.
dialog: First I was just trying to get the
dialog: fuck outta there. And after we
dialog: got away, I've just been dealin
dialog: with him.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Well, you better start thinking
dialog: about it. Cause I, sure as fuck,
dialog: am thinking about it. In fact,
dialog: that's all I'm thinking about. I
dialog: came this close to just driving
dialog: off. Whoever set us up, knows
dialog: about this place. There could've
dialog: been cops sitting here waiting for
dialog: me. For all we know, there's
text: cops, driving fast, on their way
dialog: here now.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Let's go in the other room...
text: The camera creeps along a wall, coming to a corner. We
text: move past it, and see down a hall.
scene_heading: 5 INT. BATHROOM HALLWAY - DAY
text: At the end of the hall is a bathroom. The bathroom door
text: is partially closed, restricting our view. Mr. Pink is
text: obscured, but Mr. White is in view.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK (OS)
dialog: What the fuck am I doing here? I
dialog: felt funny about this job right
dialog: off. As soon as I felt it I
dialog: should said "No thank you", and
dialog: walked. But I never fucking
dialog: listen. Every time I ever got
dialog: burned buying weed, I always knew
dialog: the guy wasn't right. I just felt
dialog: it. But I wanted to believe him.
dialog: If he's not lyin to me, and it
dialog: really is Thai stick, then whoa
dialog: baby. But it's never Thai stick.
dialog: and I always said if I felt that
dialog: way about a job, I'd walk. And I
dialog: did, and I didn't, because of
dialog: fuckin money!
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: What's done is done, I need you
dialog: cool. Are you cool?
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: I'm cool.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Splash some water on your face.
dialog: Take a breather.
text: We hear the sink running, and Mr. Pink splashing water on
text: his face.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: I'm gonna get me my smokes.
text: Mr White opens the bathroom door, walks down the hall, and
text: OUT OF FRAME. We see Mr. Pink, his back turned towards
text: us, bent over the sink. Then he grabs a towels, and dries
text: his face. Mr White ENTERS FRAME with a pack of
text: Chesterfields in his hand.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Want a smoke?
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Why not?
text: The two men light up.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Okay, let's go through what
dialog: happened. We're in the place,
dialog: everything's going fine. Then the
text: alarm gets tripped. I turn around
text: and all these cops are outside.
dialog: You're right, it was like, bam! I
dialog: blink my eyes are they're there.
text: Everybody starts going apeshit.
text: Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin all
dialog: the--
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: --That's not correct.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: What's wrong with it?
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: The cops didn't show up after the
text: alarm went off. They didn't show
dialog: till after Mr. Blonde started
dialog: shooting everyone.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: As soon as I heard the alarm, I
dialog: saw the cops.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: I'm telling ya, it wasn't that
dialog: soon. They didn't let their
dialog: presence be known until after Mr.
dialog: Blonde went off. I'm not sayin
dialog: they weren't there, I'm sayin they
text: were there. But they didn't move
dialog: in till Mr. Blonde became a
dialog: madman. That's how I know we were
dialog: set up. You can see that,
dialog: can't you, Mr. White?
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Look, enough of this "Mr White"
dialog: shit--
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: --Don't tell me your name, I don't
dialog: want to know! I sure as hell
dialog: ain't gonna tell ya
dialog: mine.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: You're right, this is bad.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: How did you get out?
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Shot my way out. Everybody was
dialog: shooting, so I just blasted my way
dialog: outta there.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 6 EXT. CROWDED CITY STREET - DAY
text: Mr. Pink is hauling ass down a busy city sidewalk. He has
text: a canvas bag with a shoulder strap in one hand, and a .357
text: MAGNUM in the other. If any BYSTANDERS get in his way, he
text: just knocks them down. We DOLLY at the same speed, right
text: along side of him.
text: FOUR POLICEMEN are running after Mr. Pink. We DOLLY with
dialog: them.
text: We DOLLY with a young woman on roller skates. ROLLERGIRL
text: is plugged into a walkman. We hear the song she's
text: listening to LOUD over the SOUNDTRACK. She's twirling and
text: skating backwards to the beat of the song.
text: Rollergirl turns a corner and COLLIDES with Mr. Pink. The
text: man and woman CRASH to the ground.
text: Mr. Pink rolls into the street, in front of a moving car
text: that SCREECHES to a stop, narrowly avoiding running over
dialog: him.
scene_heading: 7 INT. CAR (STOPPED) - DAY
text: The CAMERA is in the backseat. A SHOCKED WOMAN is the
text: car's driver. Mr. Pink pulls himself up from the hood,
text: shakes it off, and points his magnum at the driver.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Get outta the car! Get the fuck
dialog: outta the car!
text: The Shocked Woman starts screaming.
text: Mr. Pink tries to open the driver's side door, but it's
dialog: locked.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Open the fucking door!
scene_heading: EXTREME C.U. DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW
text: Mr. Pink SMASHES it in our face.
scene_heading: 8 EXT. STREET - DAY
text: DOLLY with Cops coming up fast.
text: Mr. Pink DRAGS the Shocked Woman out of the car.
text: The Cops reach the corner, guns aimed.
text: Using the car as a shield, Mr. Pink FIRES three shots at
dialog: the Cops.
text: Everybody HITS the ground, or scatters.
text: Mr. Pink HOPS in the car.
text: Cops FIRE.
scene_heading: 9 INT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY
text: CAMERA in the backseat, Mr. Pink FLOORS it. SPEEDING down
text: the street, with the Cops FIRING after him.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: 10 INT. BATHROOM - DAY
text: Mr. Pink and Mr. White still talking in the bathroom.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Tagged a couple of cops. Did you
dialog: kill anybody?
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
text: A few cops.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: No real people?
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Uh-uh, just cops.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: That was one of the most insane
dialog: fucking things I've ever seen.
dialog: Why the fuck would Joe hire
dialog: somebody like that?
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: I don't wanna kill anybody. But
dialog: if I gotta get out that door, and
dialog: you're standing in my way, one way
dialog: of the other, you're gettin outta
dialog: my way.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: That's the way I look at it. A
dialog: choice between doin ten years, and
dialog: takin out some stupid
dialog: motherfucker, ain't no choice at
dialog: all. But I ain't no madman
dialog: either. What the fuck was Joe
dialog: thinkin? You can't work with a
dialog: guy like that. That mother-
dialog: fucker's unstable. What do you
dialog: think? Do you think he panicked,
dialog: or ya think he's just trigger-
dialog: happy?
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: I think he's a sick fuckin maniac!
dialog: We're awful goddamn lucky he
dialog: didn't tag us, when
dialog: he shot up the place. I came this
dialog: fucking close--
dialog: (hold up two fingers
dialog: and makes a tiny
dialog: space between them)
dialog: --to taking his ass out myself.
text: Everybody panics. When things get
text: tense, everybody panics.
dialog: Everybody. I don't care what your
dialog: name is, you can't help it. It's
dialog: human nature. But ya panic on the
dialog: inside.
dialog: Ya panic in your head. Ya give
dialog: yourself a couple a seconds of
dialog: panic, then you get a grip and
dialog: deal with the situation. What you
dialog: don't do, is shoot up the place
dialog: and kill everybody.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: What you're supposed to do is act
dialog: like a fuckin professional. A
dialog: psychopath is not a professional.
dialog: You can't work with a psychopath,
dialog: 'cause ya don't know what those
dialog: sick assholes are gonna do next.
dialog: I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do
dialog: you think that black girl was?
dialog: Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Did ya see what happened to
dialog: anybody else?
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the
text: car and Mr. Brown floored it.
dialog: After that, I don't know what went
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: At that point it became every man
dialog: for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde
dialog: or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't
dialog: got the foggiest. Once
dialog: I got out, I never looked back.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: What do I think? I think the cops
dialog: caught them, or killed 'em.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Not even a chance they punched
dialog: through? You found a hole.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Yeah, and that was a fucking
dialog: miracle. But if they did get
dialog: away, where the fuck are they?
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: You don't think it's possible, one
dialog: of them got ahold of the diamonds
dialog: and pulled a--
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: How can you be so sure?
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: I got the diamonds.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: I got 'em, all right?
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Where? Are they out in the car?
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: No, they're not in the car. No, I
dialog: don't have them on me. Ya wanna
dialog: go with me and get 'em? Yes, we
dialog: can go right now. But first
dialog: listen to what I'm telling you.
dialog: We were fuckin set up! Somebody
dialog: is in league with the cops. We
dialog: got a Judas in our midst. And I'm
dialog: thinkin we should have our fuckin
text: heads examined for waiting around
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: That was the plan, we meet here.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Then where is everybody? I say
dialog: the plan became null and void once
dialog: we found out we got a rat in the
dialog: house. We ain't got the slightest
dialog: fuckin idea what happened to Mr.
dialog: Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could
dialog: both be dead
dialog: or arrested. They could be
dialog: sweatin 'em, down at the station
dialog: house right now. Yeah they don't
dialog: know the names, but they can sing
dialog: about this place.
dialog: I mean, that could be happening
dialog: right now. As we speak, the cops
dialog: could be in their cars, drivin
dialog: here this minute.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: I swear to god I'm fuckin jinxed.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Two jobs back, it was a four man
dialog: job, we discovered one of the team
dialog: was an undercover cop.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: No shit?
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Thank god, we discovered in time.
dialog: We hadda forget the whole fuckin
dialog: thing. Just walked away from it.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: So who's the rat this time? Mr.
dialog: Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's
dialog: Joe's show, he set this whole
dialog: thing up. Maybe he set it up to
dialog: set it up.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: I don't buy it. Me and Joe go
dialog: back a long time. I can tell ya
dialog: straight up, Joe definitely didn't
dialog: have anything to do with this
dialog: bullshit.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Oh, you and Joe go back a long
dialog: time. I known Joe since I was a
dialog: kid. But me saying Joe definitely
dialog: couldn't have done it is
dialog: ridiculous. I can say I
dialog: definitely didn't do it, cause I
dialog: know what I did or didn't do. But
dialog: I can't definitely say that about
dialog: anybody else, 'cause I don't
dialog: definitely know. For all I know,
dialog: you're the rat.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: For all I know, you're the rat.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Now you're using your head. For
dialog: all we know, he's the rat.
text: Mr. Pink points OFFSCREEN to Mr. Orange. Mr. White's
dialog: expression changes.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Jesus Christ!
scene_heading: 11 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
text: They run over to Mr. Orange, who's unconscious. The
text: CAMERA hovers over the action. Mr. Pink reaches him
dialog: first.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Is he dead?
text: Mr. White pushes him out of the way. He feels the pulse
text: on Mr. Orange's neck.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: So, is he dead or what?
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: He ain't dead.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: So what is it?
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
text: I think he's just passed out.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: He scared the fuckin shit outta
dialog: me. I thought he was dead fer
dialog: sure.
text: Mr. White stands up and walks over to a table.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: He will be dead fer sure, if we
dialog: don't get him to a hospital.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: We can't take him to a hospital.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Without medical attention, this
dialog: man won't live through the night.
dialog: That bullet in his belly is my
dialog: fault. Now while that might not
dialog: mean jack shit to you, it means a
dialog: helluva lot to me. And I'm not
dialog: gonna just sit around and watch
dialog: him die.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Well, first things first, staying
dialog: here's goofy. We gotta book up.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: So what do you suggest, we go to a
dialog: hotel? We got a guy who's shot in
dialog: the belly, he can't walk, he
text: bleeds like a stuck pig, and when
text: he's awake, he screams in pain.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: You gotta idea, spit it out.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Joe could help him. If we can get
dialog: in touch with Joe, Joe could get
dialog: him to a doctor, Joe could get a
dialog: doctor to come and see him.
text: During Mr. Pink's dialog, we slowly ZOOM in to a
dialog: C.U. of Mr. White.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK (OS)
dialog: Assuming we can trust Joe, how we
dialog: gonna get in touch with him? He's
dialog: supposed to be here, but he ain't,
dialog: which is making me nervous about
dialog: being here. Even if Joe is
dialog: on the up and up, he's probably
dialog: not gonna be that happy with us.
dialog: Joe planned a robbery, but he's
text: got a blood bath on his hands now.
text: Dead cops, dead robbers, dead
dialog: civilians...Jesus Christ! I tend
dialog: to doubt he's gonna have a lot of
dialog: sympathy for our plight. If I was
dialog: him, I'd try and put as much
dialog: distance between me and this mess
dialog: an humanly possible.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Before you got here, Mr. Orange
dialog: was askin me to take him to a
dialog: hospital. Now I don't like
text: turning him over to the cops, but
dialog: if we don't, he's dead. He begged
dialog: me to do it. I told him to hold
dialog: off till Joe got here.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK (OS)
dialog: Well Joe ain't gettin here. We're
dialog: on our own. Now, I don't know a
dialog: goddamn body who can help him, so
dialog: if you know somebody, call 'em.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: I don't know anybody.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK (OS)
dialog: Well, I guess we drop him off at
dialog: the hospital. Since he don't know
dialog: nothin about us, I say it's his
dialog: decision.
scene_heading: MR. WHITE'S POV:
scene_heading: C.U. OF MR. PINK.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE (OS)
dialog: Well, he knows a little about me.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: You didn't tell him your name, did
dialog: ya?
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE (OS)
dialog: I told him my first name, and
dialog: where I'm from.
text: There is a long silence and a blank look from Mr. Pink,
dialog: then he SCREAMS:
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Why!
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE (OS)
dialog: I told him where I was from a few
dialog: days ago. It was just a casual
dialog: conversation.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: And what was tellin him your name
dialog: when you weren't supposed to?
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE (OS)
dialog: He asked.
text: Mr. Pink looks at Mr. White like he's retarded.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE (OS)
dialog: We had just gotten away from the
dialog: cops. He just got shot. It was
dialog: my fuckin fault he got shot. He's
dialog: a fuckin bloody mess - he's
dialog: screaming. I swear to god, I
dialog: thought we was gonna die right
dialog: then and there. I'm tryin to
dialog: comfort him, telling him not to
dialog: worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm
dialog: gonna take care of him. And he
dialog: asked me what my name was. I
dialog: mean, the man was dyin in my arms.
dialog: What the fuck was I supposed to
dialog: tell him, "Sorry, I can't give out
dialog: that information, it's against the
dialog: rules. I don't trust you
dialog: enough."? Maybe I shoulda, but I
dialog: couldn't.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Oh, I don't doubt is was quite
dialog: beautiful--
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE (OS)
dialog: Don't fuckin patronize me.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: One question: Do they have a sheet
dialog: on you, where you told him you're
dialog: from?
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE (OS)
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Well that's that, then. I mean, I
dialog: was worried about mug shot
dialog: possibilities already. But now he
dialog: knows: (a) what you look like, (b)
dialog: what your first name is,
dialog: (i) where you're from and (d) what
dialog: your specialty is.
dialog: They ain't gonna hafta show him a
dialog: helluva lot of pictures for him to
dialog: pick you out. That's it right,
dialog: you didn't tell him anything else
dialog: that could narrow down the
dialog: selection?
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE (OS)
dialog: If I have to tell you again to
dialog: back off, me an you are gonna go
dialog: round and round.
text: Mr. Pink walks out of the C.U. and turns his back on Mr.
text: White. Mr. White's POV PANS over to him.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: We ain't taking him to a hospital.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE (OS)
dialog: If we don't, he'll die.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: And I'm very sad about that. But
dialog: some fellas are lucky, and some
dialog: ain't.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE (OS)
dialog: That fuckin did it!
text: Mr. White's POV CHARGES toward Mr. Pink.
text: Mr. Pink turns toward him in time to get PUNCHED hard in
dialog: the mouth.
speaker_heading: END OF POV
text: Mr. White and Mr. Pink have a very ungraceful and
text: realistic fight. They go at each other like a couple of
dialog: alley cats.
text: As Mr. White SWINGS and PUNCHES, he SCREAMS:
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: You little motherfucker!
text: Mr. Pink YELLS as he HITS:
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Ya wanna fuck with me?! You wanna
dialog: fuck with me?! I'll show you who
dialog: you're fuckin with!
text: The two men end up on the floor KICKING and SCRATCHING.
text: Mr. White gets Mr. Pink in a HEADLOCK.
text: Mr. Pink reaches in his jacket for his gun, and pulls it
dialog: out.
text: Mr. White sees this, immediately lets go of Mr. Pink,
text: and goes for his own weapon.
text: The two men are on the floor, on their knees, with their
text: guns outstretched, aiming at one another.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: You wanna shoot me, you little
dialog: piece of shit? Take a shot!
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Fuck you, White! I didn't create
dialog: this situation, I'm just dealin
dialog: with it. You're acting like a
dialog: first-year fuckin thief. I'm
dialog: actin like a professional. They
dialog: get him, they can get you, they
dialog: get you, they get closer to me,
dialog: and that can't happen. And you,
dialog: you motherfucker, are looking at
dialog: me like it's my fault. I didn't
dialog: tell him my name. I didn't tell
dialog: him where I was from. I didn't
dialog: tell him what I knew better than
dialog: to tell him. Fuck, fifteen
dialog: minutes ago, you almost told me
dialog: your name. You, buddy, are stuck
dialog: in a situation you created. So if
dialog: you wanna throw bad looks
dialog: somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.
text: Mr. Pink lowers his gun and walks towards White.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: So if you wanna shoot somebody,
dialog: put that gun in your mouth and
dialog: shoot yourself.
text: Then from OFF SCREEN we hear:
speaker_heading: VOICE (OS)
dialog: You kids don't play so rough.
dialog: Somebody's gonna start crying.
scene_heading: 12 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - MEDIUM C.U. ON MR. BLONDE
text: The Voice belongs to the infamous Mr. Blonde.
text: Mr. Blonde sits on a counter, drinking a fast food coke
text: and eating a hot dog.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Mr. Blonde! You okay? We thought
dialog: you might've gotten caught. What
dialog: happened?
text: Mr. Blonde doesn't answer, he just hops off the counter
text: and starts walking around the warehouse, checking the
dialog: place out.
text: He doesn't look at either Mr. Pink or Mr. White, he
text: just eats his hot dog and sips his coke.
dialog: This is making Pink and White nervous as hell. But Mr.
text: Pink tries to talk through it.
text: We HANDHOLD follow Mr. Blonde around the warehouse.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Really, how did you get away?
text: Mr. Blonde walks the loft. Silent.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: You saw what happened to me,
dialog: I found a hole and booked.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Where's Mr. Blue?
text: Blonde looks in the bathroom.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: We were hopin you two would be
dialog: together.
text: Blonde looks out the window.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: That was the big question we had,
dialog: what happened to Mr.
dialog: Blue and you?
text: Blonde walks away from the window.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: We were worried the cops got ya.
text: Blonde bends down over Mr. Orange.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: He got it in the belly. He's
dialog: still alive, but won't be for
dialog: long.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Enough! You better start talkin
dialog: to us, asshole, cause we got shit
dialog: we need to talk about. We're
dialog: already freaked out, we need you
dialog: actin freaky like we need a fuckin
dialog: bag on our hip.
text: Mr. Blonde looks at his two partners in crime, then moves
text: towards them.
speaker_heading: MR. BLONDE
dialog: So, talk.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: We think we got a rat in the
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: I guarantee we got a rat in the
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: MR. BLONDE
dialog: What would ever make you think
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Is that supposed to be funny?
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: We don't think this place is safe.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: This place just ain't secure
dialog: anymore. We're leaving, and you
dialog: should go with us.
speaker_heading: MR. BLONDE
dialog: Nobody's going anywhere.
text: Silence takes over the room. Mr. Blonde stops moving.
text: After a few beats the silence is broken.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: (to Mr. Pink)
dialog: Piss on this turd, we're outta
dialog: here.
text: Mr. White turns to leave.
speaker_heading: MR. BLONDE
dialog: Don't take another step, Mr.
dialog: White.
text: Mr. White explodes, raising his gun and charging towards
dialog: Mr. Blonde.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Fuck you, maniac! It's your

dialog: trouble.
text: Mr. Blonde calmly sits down. He looks to Mr. Pink.
speaker_heading: MR. BLONDE

dialog: What's this guy's problem?
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta

speaker_heading: MR. BLONDE

speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: That fuckin shooting spree in the
dialog: store.
speaker_heading: MR. BLONDE
dialog: Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm,
dialog: they deserve what they got.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: You almost killed me, asshole! If
dialog: I had any idea what type of guy
dialog: you were, I never would've agreed
dialog: to work with you.
speaker_heading: MR. BLONDE
dialog: You gonna back all day, little
dialog: doggie, or are you gonna bite?
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: What was that? I'm sorry, I
dialog: didn't catch it. Would you repeat
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: MR. BLONDE
dialog: (slowly)
dialog: I said: "Are you gonna bark all
dialog: day, dog, or are you gonna bite."
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Both of you two assholes knock it
dialog: the fuck off and calm down!
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: (to Mr. Blonde)
dialog: So you wanna git bit, huh?
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a
dialog: fuckin playground!
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I don't believe this shit, both of

dialog: two, always fightin, always sayin
dialog: they're gonna kill one another.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: (to Mr. Pink)
dialog: You said yourself, you
dialog: thought about takin him out.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
text: Then. That time has passed.
dialog: Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only
dialog: one I completely trust. He's too
dialog: fuckin homicidal to be workin with
dialog: the cops.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: You takin his side?
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Fuck sides! What we need is a
dialog: little solidarity here.
dialog: Somebody's stickin a red hot poker
dialog: up our asses and we gotta find out
dialog: whose hand's on the handle. Now I
dialog: know I'm no piece of shit...
dialog: (referring to Mr.
dialog: White)
dialog: And I'm pretty sure you're a good
dialog: boy...
dialog: (referring to Mr.

speaker_heading: MR. BLONDE
dialog: Well, that was sure exciting.

scene_heading: 24 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

speaker_heading: MR. BLONDE
text: "Clowns to the left of me,

scene_heading: FREEZE FRAME ON HOLDAWAY

speaker_heading: FREDDY (O.S.)

speaker_heading: FREDDY

speaker_heading: HOLDAWAY

speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: The Boots and Socks in Gardena.
dialog: When we got there, I met Joe and a

speaker_heading: HOLDAWAY

speaker_heading: FREDDY

speaker_heading: HOLDAWAY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: FREDDY

speaker_heading: HOLDAWAY

speaker_heading: FREDDY

speaker_heading: HOLDAWAY

speaker_heading: HOLDAWAY

speaker_heading: HOLDAWAY
dialog: The Milwaukee Brewers?
speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: Yeah. They had just won the night

dialog: 'em.
speaker_heading: HOLDAWAY
dialog: Well, if this crook's a Brewers

dialog: Wisconsin. And I'll bet you
dialog: everything from a diddle-eyed Joe
dialog: to a damned-if-I-know, that in

speaker_heading: FREDDY

speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: HOLDAWAY
dialog: It's a scene. Memorize it.
speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HOLDAWAY
dialog: A undercover cop has got to be
dialog: Marlon Brando. To do this job you
dialog: got to be a great actor. You got
dialog: to be naturalistic. You got to be
dialog: naturalistic as hell. If you
dialog: ain't a great actor you're a bad
dialog: actor, and bad acting is bull shit
dialog: in this job.
speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: (referring to the
dialog: papers)
dialog: But what is this?
speaker_heading: HOLDAWAY
dialog: It's a amusing anecdote about a
dialog: drug deal.
speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HOLDAWAY
dialog: Something funny that happened to
dialog: you while you were doing a job.
speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: I gotta memorize all this shit?
speaker_heading: HOLDAWAY
dialog: It's like a joke. You remember
dialog: what's important, and the rest you
dialog: make your own. The only way to
dialog: make it your own is to keep sayin
dialog: it, and sayin it, and sayin it,
dialog: and sayin it, and sayin it.
speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: I can do that.
speaker_heading: HOLDAWAY
dialog: The things you gotta remember are
dialog: the details. It's the details
dialog: that sell your story. Now this
dialog: story takes place in this men's
dialog: room. So you gotta know the
dialog: details about this men's room.
dialog: You gotta know they got a blower
dialog: instead of a towel to dry your
dialog: hands. You gotta know the stalls
dialog: ain't got no doors. You gotta
dialog: know whether they got liquid or
dialog: powdered soap, whether they got
dialog: hot water or not, 'cause if you do
dialog: your job when you tell your story,
dialog: everybody should believe it. And
dialog: if you tell your story to somebody
dialog: who's actually taken a piss in
dialog: this men's room, and you get one
dialog: detail they remember right,
dialog: they'll swear by you.
scene_heading: 29 INT. FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Freddy paces back and forth, in and out of frame,
text: rehearsing the anecdote. He's reading it pretty good, but
text: he's still reading it from the page, and every once in a
text: while he stumbles over his words.
speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: ...this was during the Los Angeles
dialog: marijuana drought of '86. I still
dialog: had a connection. Which was
dialog: insane, 'cause you couldn't get
dialog: weed anyfuckinwhere then. Anyway,
dialog: I had a connection with this
text: hippie chick up in Santa Cruz.
dialog: All and my friends knew it. And
dialog: they'd give me a call and say,
dialog: "Hey, Freddy, you buyin some, you
dialog: think you could buy me some too?"
dialog: They knew I smoked, so they'd ask
dialog: me to buy a little for them when I
dialog: was buyin. But it got to be
dialog: everytime I bought some weed, I
dialog: was buyin for four or five
dialog: different people. Finally I said,
dialog: "Fuck this shit." I'm makin this
dialog: bitch rich. She didn't have to do
dialog: jack shit, she never even had to
dialog: meet these people. I was fuckin
dialog: doin all the work. So I got
dialog: together with her and told her,
dialog: "Hey, I'm sick of this shit. I'm
dialog: comin through for everybody, and
dialog: nobody's comin through for me.
dialog: So, either I'm gonna tell all my
dialog: friends to find their own source,
dialog: or you give me a bunch of weed,
dialog: I'll sell it to them, give you the
dialog: money, minus ten percent, and I
dialog: get my pot for free." So, I did
dialog: if for awhile...
dialog: Freddy exits frame
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 30 EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
text: Another empty frame, except obviously outside. Freddy
text: enters frame from the same direction he exited in the
text: previous scene, finishing his sentence. When we move to a
text: wider shot we see Freddy performing his monolog to
text: Holdaway in a parking lot. Holdaway sits on the hood of
text: his beat-up car. Freddy paces back and forth as he
text: performs his story.
speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: ...but then that got to be a pain
dialog: in the ass. People called me on
dialog: the phone all the fuckin time. I
dialog: couldn't rent a fuckin tape
dialog: without six phone calls
dialog: interrupting me. "Hey, Freddy,
dialog: when's the next time you're gettin
dialog: some?" "Motherfucker, I'm tryin
dialog: to watch 'Lost Boys'-- when I have
dialog: some, I'll let you know." And
dialog: then these rinky-dink pot heads
dialog: come by--there's my friends and
dialog: everything, but still. I got all
dialog: my shit laid out in sixty dollar
dialog: bags. Well, they don't want sixty
dialog: dollars worth. They want ten
dialog: dollars worth. Breaking it up is
dialog: a major fuckin pain in the ass. I
dialog: don't even know how much ten
dialog: dollars worth is. "Well, fuck,
dialog: man, I don't want that much
dialog: around. If I have that much
dialog: around I'll smoke it." "Hey, if
dialog: you guys can't control your
dialog: smokin, that's not my problem.
dialog: You motherfuckers been smokin for
dialog: five years, be a adult about it."
dialog: Finally I just told my connection,
dialog: count me out. But as it turns
dialog: out, I'm the best guy she had, and
dialog: she depended alot on my business.
dialog: But I was still sick to death of
dialog: it. And she's trying to talk me
dialog: into not quitin.
dialog: Now this was a very weird
dialog: situation, 'cause I don't know if
dialog: you remember back in '86, there
dialog: was a major fuckin drought.
dialog: Nobody and anything. People were
dialog: livin on resin and smokin the wood
dialog: in their pipes for months. And
dialog: this chick had a bunch, and was
dialog: beggin me to sell it. So I told
dialog: her I wasn't gonna be Joe the Pot
dialog: Man anymore. But I would take a
dialog: little bit and sell it to my
text: close, close, close friends. She
dialog: agreed to that, and said we'd keep
dialog: the same arrangement as before,
dialog: ten percent and free pot for me,
dialog: as long as I helped her out that
dialog: weekend. She had a brick of weed
dialog: she was sellin, and she didn't
dialog: want to go to the buy alone...

dialog: weed. Well, I don't wanna do
dialog: this, I have a bad feeling about
dialog: it, but she keeps askin me, keeps
dialog: askin me, finally I said okay
dialog: 'cause I'm sick of listening to
dialog: it. Well, we're picking this guy
text: up at the train station.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You're picking the buyer up at the
dialog: train station? You're carrying

speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: Yeah, the guy needed it right
dialog: away. Don't ask me why. So we
dialog: get to the train station, and
dialog: we're waitin for the guy. Now I'm

speaker_heading: FREDDY (V.O.)
dialog: Every nerve ending, all of my

text: Back to the same freeze frame shot of Freddy standing in

speaker_heading: SHERIFF #1
dialog: Shut up!

speaker_heading: SHERIFF #2
dialog: So my gun's drawn, right? I got
text: it aimed right at him. I tell

dialog: And the little idiot's lookin at

speaker_heading: SHERIFF #2 (O.S.)
dialog: I tell 'im, "Buddy, I'm gonna

speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: When did he do this time?
speaker_heading: JODIE
dialog: Back in '83, got out late '86. I
dialog: found something else out I think
dialog: you two should be aware of.
dialog: About a year and a half ago, up in
text: Sacramento, an undercover cop,
text: John Dolenz, worked his way into a
dialog: bank job. Apparently before the
dialog: job they found out he was a cop.
dialog: Now picture this: It's Dolenz's
text: birthday, a bunch of cops are
text: waiting in his apartment for a

text: everyone yells "Surprise!", and
text: standing in the doorway is Dolenz
dialog: and this other guy sticking a gun
text: in Dolenz's ribs. Before anybody
dialog: knows what's going on, this

text: starts firing two .45 automatics
text: into the crowd.
speaker_heading: HOLDAWAY
dialog: What happened?
text: The DOLLY moves behind Jodie.
speaker_heading: JODIE
dialog: It was a mess. Cops got hit,
dialog: wives got hit, girlfriends got
dialog: hit, his dog got hit. People got
text: glass in their faces. Three were
dialog: killed, six were wounded.
speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: They couldn't pin the killing on
dialog: one of the bank robbers?
speaker_heading: JODIE
dialog: They tried, but they didn't have a
dialog: positive I.D. and all those guys
dialog: had alibis. Besides, we really
dialog: didn't have anything on them. We
dialog: had the testimony of a dead man
dialog: that they were talking
text: about committing a robbery. They
dialog: never went ahead with the bank
dialog: job.
text: The DOLLY completes its circle.
speaker_heading: FREDDY

text: DOLLY fast toward the front door knob. Freddy's hand
text: comes into FRAME, grabs the knob, then lets go. We MOVE

dialog: Fear.
speaker_heading: FREDDY

scene_heading: 41 INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: ...Hey, I know what I'm talkin
dialog: about, black women ain't the same
dialog: as white women.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: There's a slight difference.
text: The car laughs.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Go ahead and laugh, you know what
dialog: I mean. What a while bitch will
dialog: put up with, a black bitch won't
text: put up with for a minute. They
dialog: got a line, and if you cross it,
dialog: they fuck you up.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on
dialog: this. I've seen it happen.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such
dialog: a truism, how come every nigger I
dialog: know treats his woman like a piece
dialog: of shit?
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: I'll make you a bet that those
dialog: same damn niggers who were showin
dialog: their ass in public, when their
dialog: bitches get 'em home, they chill
dialog: the fuck out.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Not these guys.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Yeah, those guys too.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Let me tell you guys a story. In
dialog: one of daddy's clubs there was
dialog: this black cocktail waitress named
dialog: Elois.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Elois?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We
dialog: called her Lady E.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Where was she from, Compton?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: No. She was from Ladora Heights.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: The black Beverly Hills. I knew
dialog: this lady from Ladora Heights
dialog: once.
dialog: (in a stuck up black
dialog: female voice)
dialog: "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's
dialog: the black Beverly Hills."
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: It's not the black Beverly Hills,
dialog: it's the black Palos Verdes.
dialog: Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a
dialog: man-eater-upper. I bet every guy
dialog: who's ever met her has jacked off
dialog: to her at least once. You know
dialog: who she looked like? Christie
dialog: Love. 'Member that TV show "Get
dialog: Christie Love"? She was a black
dialog: female cop. She always used to
dialog: say "You're under arrest, sugar."
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: I was in the sixth grade when that
dialog: show was on. I totally dug it.
dialog: What the fuck was the name of the
dialog: chick who played Christie
dialog: Love?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Pam Grier.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: No, it wasn't Pan Grier, Pan Grier
dialog: was the other one. Pan Grier made
dialog: the movies. Christie Love was
text: like a Pam Grier TV show, without
dialog: Pam Grier.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: What the fuck was that chick's
dialog: name? Oh this is just great, I'm
dialog: totally fuckin tortured now.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Well, whoever she was, Elois
dialog: looked like her. So one night I
text: walk into the club, and no Elois.
dialog: Now the bartender was a wetback,
dialog: he was a friend of mine, his name
dialog: was Carlos.
dialog: So I asked him "Hey, Carlos,
dialog: where's Lady E tonight?" Well
dialog: apparently Lady E was married to
dialog: this real piece of dog shit. I
dialog: mean a real animal. And
dialog: apparently he would so things to
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: Do things? What would he do? You
dialog: mean like beat her up?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Nobody knows for sure what he did.
dialog: We just know he did something.
dialog: Anyway, Elois plays it real cool.
dialog: And waits for the next time this
dialog: bag of shit gets drunk. So one
dialog: night the guy gets drunk and
text: passes out on the couch. So while
dialog: the guy's
text: inebriated, she strips him naked.
text: Then she takes some crazy glue and
text: glues his dick to his belly.
text: The car reacts to how horrible that would be.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I'm dead fuckin serious. She put
text: some on his dick and some on his
dialog: belly, then stuck 'em together.
text: The paramedics had to come and cut
dialog: it loose.
text: The car reacts badly.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Jesus Christ!
speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: You can do some crazy things with
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I don't know what he did to her,
dialog: but she got even.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Was he all pissed off?
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: How would you feel if you had to
dialog: do a handstand every time you took
dialog: a piss.
text: The car laughs.
scene_heading: 42 EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

scene_heading: 43 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
text: The four men enter the building.
text: At the other end of the warehouse, sitting in chairs, are
text: Mr. Blonde, Mr. Brown, Mr. Blue and Joe Cabot.
text: We shoot this from OVERHEAD, looking down on the men.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (to everybody)
dialog: ...So they're talkin about how
dialog: they get their wives off, and the
dialog: French guys says:
dialog: (in a bad French
dialog: accent)
dialog: "All I gotta do is take my pinky
dialog: and tickle my Fifi's little oo la
text: la and she rises a foot off the
dialog: bed."
text: Back to Joe.
dialog: So the dago says:
speaker_heading: CU ON JOE
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (in a good Brooklyn
dialog: accent)
dialog: "That's nothin. When I take the
text: tip of my tongue and wiggle it
dialog: against my Mary Louise's little
text: fun pimple, she rises two feet off
dialog: da bed." Then our friend from
dialog: Poland says:
dialog: (in dumb voice)
dialog: "You guys ain't no cocksmen. When
dialog: I get through fuckin my Sophie, I
dialog: wipe my dick on the curtains and
dialog: you know what? She hits the
dialog: roof!"
text: Joe laughs like a crazy man.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
text: We hear a lot of laughing OFF SCREEN.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Ain't that a masterpiece? Stupid
text: fuckin Polack, wipes his dick on
text: the drapes.
text: Joe's eyes greet the new arrivals.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You're here, great!
speaker_heading: Joe EXITS C.U.
dialog: We now have everybody from the Uncle Bob's Pancake House
text: scene together again. Some sit on folding chairs, some
text: stand. Joe sits in front of them on the edge of a table.
text: A blackboard with a layout of the jewelry store is off to
dialog: the right.
text: We do a 360 around the men.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: We woulda gotten here sooner, but
dialog: we got backed up around La Brea
dialog: and Pico.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No hurry.
dialog: (to the boys)
dialog: All right, let's get to know one
dialog: another. With the exception of
dialog: Eddie and myself, who you already
dialog: know, you'll be using aliases.
dialog: Under no circumstances are you to
dialog: tell one another your real name or
dialog: anything else about yourself.
dialog: That includes where you're from,
dialog: your wife's name, where you
dialog: might've done time, about a bank
dialog: in St. Petersburg you might've
dialog: robbed. You guys don't say shit
dialog: about who you are, where you been
dialog: or what you've done. Only thing
dialog: you guys can talk about is what
dialog: you're going to do. This way the
dialog: only ones who know who the members
dialog: of the team are are Eddie and
dialog: myself. And that's the way I like
dialog: it. Because in the unlikely event
dialog: of one of you getting apprehended
dialog: by the cops, not that I expect
dialog: that to happen - it most
dialog: definitely should not happen - it
dialog: hasn't happened, you don't have
dialog: anything to deal with. You don't
dialog: know any names. You know my name,
dialog: you know Eddie's name. That I
dialog: don't care about. You gotta prove
dialog: it. I ain't worried. Besides,
dialog: this way you gotta trust me. I
dialog: like that. I set this up and
dialog: picked the men I wanted for it.
dialog: None of you came to me, I
dialog: approached all of you. I know
dialog: you. I know your work, I know
dialog: your reputation. I know you as
dialog: men. Except for this guy.
text: Joe points a finger at Freddy.
text: Freddy shits a brick.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he
dialog: wouldn't be here. Okay, let me
dialog: introduce everybody to everybody.
dialog: But once again, at the risk of
dialog: being redundant, if I even think I
dialog: hear somebody telling or referring
dialog: to somebody by their Christian
dialog: name...
dialog: (Joe searches for the
dialog: right words)
dialog: ...you won't want to be you.
dialog: Okay, quickly.
dialog: (pointing at the men
text: as he gives them a
dialog: name)
dialog: Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde,
dialog: Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr.
dialog: Pink.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Why am I Mr. Pink?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Cause you're a faggot.
text: Everybody laughs.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Why can't we pick out our own
dialog: colors?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I tried that once, it don't work.
dialog: You get four guys fighting over
dialog: who's gonna be Mr. Black. Since
dialog: nobody knows anybody else, nobody
dialog: wants to back down. So forget it,
dialog: I pick. Be thankful you're not
dialog: Mr. Yellow.
speaker_heading: MR. BROWN
dialog: Yeah, but Mr. Brown? That's too
text: close to Mr. Shit.
text: Everybody laughs.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr.
dialog: Pussy. Tell you what, let me be
dialog: Mr. Purple. That sounds good to
dialog: me, I'm Mr. Purple.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You're not Mr. Purple, somebody
dialog: from another job's Mr. Purple.
dialog: You're Mr. Pink.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Who cares what your name is? Who
dialog: cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr.
dialog: Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Oh that's really easy for you to
dialog: say, you're Mr. White. You gotta
dialog: cool-sounding name. So tell me,
dialog: Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink"
dialog: is no big deal, you wanna trade?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Nobody's trading with anybody!
dialog: Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin
dialog: city counsel meeting! Listen up
dialog: Mr. Pink. We got two ways here,
dialog: my way or the highway. And you
dialog: can go down either of 'em. So
dialog: what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin forget
dialog: it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr.
dialog: Pink, let's move on.
text: CAMERA leaves the team and goes to the blackboard
text: with the layout of the jewelry store on it.
speaker_heading: JOE (OS)
dialog: Okay fellas, let's get into this.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 44 EXT. BLEACHERS - DAY
text: Freddy and Holdaway sit on some bleachers in an empty
text: little league baseball field.
speaker_heading: HOLDAWAY
dialog: Okay, we're gonna station men
text: across the street from Karina's
dialog: Fine Jewelry. But their orders
dialog: will be not to move in unless the
dialog: robbery gets out of control. You
dialog: gotta make sure they don't have to
dialog: move in. You're inside to make
dialog: sure that everything goes
dialog: according to Hoyle. We have men
text: set up a block away from the
dialog: warehouse rendezvous. They got
dialog: complete visibility of the
text: exterior. So as soon as Joe Cabot
dialog: shows up, we'll see it.
speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: What's your visibility of the
dialog: interior?
speaker_heading: HOLDAWAY
dialog: We can't see shit on the inside.
dialog: And we can't risk gettin any
dialog: closer for fear they'll spot us.
speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: This is bullshit, Jim. I get all
dialog: the fuckin danger of having you
dialog: guys in my back pocket but none of
dialog: the safety.
speaker_heading: HOLDAWAY
dialog: What's the matter, Newendyke? Job
dialog: too tough for ya? No one lied to
dialog: you. You always knew we'd hang
text: back until Joe Cabot showed up.
speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: Oh this is great. You ain't
dialog: giving me no fuckin protection
dialog: whatsoever. But you are giving me
dialog: an attitude.
speaker_heading: HOLDAWAY
dialog: Since when does an undercover cop
dialog: have protection? Freddy, you came
dialog: into this thing with your eyes
dialog: wide open, so don't start screamin
dialog: blind man now. I understand
dialog: you're nervous. I wish the
dialog: warehouse had more visible
dialog: windows, but it doesn't. We have
dialog: to make do with the cards we're
dialog: dealt.
speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: I didn't say I wasn't gonna do it.
dialog: I'm just remarking on how shitty
dialog: the situation is!
speaker_heading: HOLDAWAY
dialog: I don't mean to be harsh with ya,
dialog: but I've found tough love works
dialog: best in these situations. We have
dialog: to get Joe Cabot in the company of
dialog: the thieves and in the same
text: vicinity as the loot.
dialog: We don't care about these other
dialog: bastards. We're willing to offer
dialog: them good deals to testify against
dialog: Cabot.
speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: Isn't this risk unorthodox?
speaker_heading: HOLDAWAY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: Letting them go ahead with the
dialog: robbery?
speaker_heading: HOLDAWAY
dialog: The whole idea behind this
dialog: operation is to catch Joe Cabot
dialog: red-handed. We bust these hired
dialog: hands, we ain't accomplished shit.
dialog: Letting them go through with the
text: heist is a risk, but Cabot's jobs
dialog: are very clean. We got people
dialog: surrounding the perimeter. We got
text: a guy and a gal on the inside
text: posing as a couple shopping for
dialog: rings. We could replace the
dialog: employees with cops, but we'd run
dialog: the risk of tipping 'em off.
speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: That's out. They know the faces
dialog: of who works what shift.
speaker_heading: HOLDAWAY
dialog: These guys are professionals.
dialog: We're professionals. It's a risk,
dialog: but I think it's a calculated
dialog: risk.
scene_heading: 45 EXT. KARINA'S FINE JEWELRY - DAY
text: We see MOS SHOTS of the outside of the jewelry store.
text: CUSTOMERS coming and going. STORE CLERKS waiting on
text: customers through the windows.
text: While we look at this we HEAR over the soundtrack Mr.
text: White and Freddy talking OFF SCREEN.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE (VO)
dialog: Let's go over it. Where are you?
speaker_heading: FREDDY (VO)
dialog: I stand outside and guard the
dialog: door. I don't let anybody come in
dialog: or go out.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE (VO)
dialog: Mr. Brown?
speaker_heading: FREDDY (VO)
text: Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's
dialog: parked across the street till I
text: give him the signal, then he pulls
text: up in front of the store.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE (VO)
dialog: Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
speaker_heading: FREDDY (VO)
dialog: Crowd control. They handle
dialog: customers and employees in the

scene_heading: 46 INT. MR. WHITE'S CAR (PARKED) - DAY
text: Mr. White and Freddy sit in a car parked across the street
text: from the jewelry store, staking it out.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Myself and Mr. Pink?
speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: You two take the manager in the
dialog: back and make him give you the
dialog: diamonds. We're there for those
dialog: stones, period. Since no display
dialog: cases are being fucked with, no
dialog: alarms should go off. We're out
dialog: of there in two minutes, not one
dialog: second longer. What if the
dialog: manager won't give up the
dialog: diamonds?
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: When you're dealing with a store
dialog: like this, they're insured up the
dialog: ass. They're not supposed to give
dialog: you and resistance
dialog: whatsoever. If you get a customer
dialog: or an employee who thinks he's
dialog: Charles Bronson, take the butt of
dialog: your gun and smash their nose in.
text: Drops 'em right to the floor.
text: Everyone jumps, he falls down,
text: screaming, blood squirts out his
dialog: nose. Freaks everybody out.
dialog: Nobody says fuckin shit after
dialog: that. You might get some bitch
dialog: talk shit to ya. But give her a
dialog: look, like you're gonna smash her
text: in the face next. Watch her shut
dialog: the fuck up. Now if it's a
dialog: manager, that's a different story.
dialog: The managers know better than to
dialog: fuck around. So if one's givin
dialog: you static, he probably thinks
dialog: he's a real cowboy. So what you
dialog: gotta do is break that son-of-a-
dialog: bitch in two. If you wanna know
dialog: something and he won't tell you,
text: cut off one of his fingers. The
dialog: little one. Then you tell 'im his
dialog: thumb's next. After that he'll
dialog: tell ya if he wears ladies
dialog: underwear. I'm hungry, let's get
text: a taco.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 47 EXT. ALLEY - DAY

text: A car whips around the corner, into the alley.
text: The doors BURST open, Freddy and Mr. White hop out.

speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: You're not blind, there's just

text: FIRING both .45's, Mr. White massacres everyone in the

text: Freddy, holding the dying Mr. Brown, looks on at Mr.

text: Mr. Brown lifts his head up, blood in his eyes.
speaker_heading: MR. BROWN
dialog: Mr. Orange? You're Mr. Orange,
dialog: aren't you?
text: By the time Freddy turns his head back to him, Mr. Brown
text: is dead.
text: Mr. White RUNS up to Freddy.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Is he dead?
text: Freddy doesn't answer, he can't.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Did he did or not?
text: Freddy, scared.
speaker_heading: FREDDY

speaker_heading: MR. WHITE

scene_heading: C.U. ON FREDDY

dialog: You know, all things considered,

speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: I don't believe you just said
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: No, it was messy as hell, but do
dialog: you realize how much you got away
dialog: with? There's over two million
dialog: dollars worth of diamonds here.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: I love this guy.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Hey, what's done is done. We can
text: all sit around and have a big cry
dialog: about it or we can deal with the

speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: The situation as hand isn't that

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Hey, it's the best I could do.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
text: The man is fucking dying.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: And I'm telling you, Bonnie'll

speaker_heading: MR. WHITE

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Ask me how many doctors I called.
dialog: You wanna embarrass yourself, ask
dialog: me how many doctors I called.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Obviously not enough.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Fuck you! You gotta little black
dialog: book, then whip is out. If not,
dialog: listen how it is. I called three
dialog: doctors and couldn't get through
dialog: to shit. Now, time being a
dialog: factor, I called Bonnie. Sweet
dialog: broad, helluva broad, and a
dialog: registered nurse. Told her a
dialog: bullshit story, upside: she said
text: bring him to her apartment.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: If he dies I'm holding you

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Fuck you buddy boy! Okay, you
dialog: wanna play that way. I am
dialog: personally leaving myself
dialog: vulnerable with this Bonnie
dialog: situation. I don't think she'll
dialog: call the cops, but I don't know
dialog: for sure. But me being too nice-

dialog: can until we can get a doctor.
dialog: Nobody's forgotten about doctors.
dialog: Joe'll get one in a snap. This is
dialog: something we're doing in the
dialog: meantime. I think both of you are
dialog: actin like a couple of assholes.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Yeah, right. I arrange a nurse, I
dialog: leave myself wide open, and I'm an
dialog: asshole.
scene_heading: 50 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
text: MEDIUM SHOT on the door. Nice Guy Eddie, Mr. White and
text: Mr. Pink walk through it. They stop in their tracks.
text: We see what they see. Mr. Blonde, lying on the ground,
text: shot full of holes. The cop slumped over in his chair, a
text: bloody mess, Mr. Orange lying at the cop's feet, holding
text: his wound. Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk into the
dialog: shot.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What the fuck happened here?
text: Eddie runs over to his friend Mr. Blonde/Toothpick Vic.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: (to Mr. Orange)
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: MR. ORANGE
dialog: (very weakly)
text: Blonde went crazy. He slashed the
text: cop's face, cut off his ear and
dialog: was gonna burn him alive.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Who cares what he was gonna do to
dialog: this fuckin pig?
text: Eddie whips out his gun and SHOOTS the cop. The cop and
text: the chair tip over. Eddie stands over him and SHOOTS him
dialog: once more.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (to Mr. Orange)
dialog: You were saying he went crazy?
dialog: Something like that? Worse or
dialog: better?
speaker_heading: MR. ORANGE
dialog: Look, Eddie, he was pullin a burn.
dialog: He was gonna kill the cop and me.
dialog: And when you guys walked through
dialog: the door, he was gonna blow you to
dialog: hell and make off with the
dialog: diamonds.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: (to Eddie)
dialog: Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya?
dialog: That sick piece of shit was a
dialog: stone cold psycho.
speaker_heading: MR. ORANGE
dialog: (to Eddie)
dialog: You could've asked the cop, if you
dialog: didn't just kill him. He talked
dialog: about what he was going to do when
text: he was slicing him up.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I don't buy it. It doesn't make
dialog: sense.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: It makes perfect fuckin sense to
dialog: me. Eddie, you didn't see how he
dialog: acted during the job, we did.
text: Mr. Pink walks over to the cop's body.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: He's right about the ear, it's
text: hacked off.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (to Mr. Orange)
dialog: Let me say this out loud, just to
dialog: get it straight in my mind.
dialog: According to you, Mr. Blonde was
dialog: gonna kill you. Then when we came
dialog: back, kill us, grab the diamonds,
dialog: and scram. That's your story?
dialog: I'm correct about that, right?
speaker_heading: MR. ORANGE
dialog: Eddie, you can believe me or not
dialog: believe me, but it's the truth. I
dialog: swear on my mother's eternal soul
dialog: that's what happened.
text: The CAMERA mover into a C.U. of Nice Guy Eddie.
text: There's a long pause while he rolls over what Mr. Orange
dialog: has said. Finally:
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You're a fuckin liar. Now why
dialog: don't you drop the fuckin fairy
dialog: tale and tell me what really
dialog: happened?
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE (OS)
dialog: He told you what really happened.
dialog: You just can't deal with it.
speaker_heading: MR. ORANGE (OS)
dialog: Okay, you're right, I'm lying.
dialog: Even though I'm fuckin dyin I'm
dialog: not above pullin a fast one. Get
dialog: rid of Blonde, we share his split
dialog: - no, scratch that, I shot him
dialog: 'cause I didn't like his hair
dialog: style. I didn't like his shoes
dialog: either. If it has just been his
dialog: hair, I'd've maybe, maybe I said,
dialog: let him live. But hair and
text: footwear together, he's a goner.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: The man you killed was just
dialog: released from prison. He got
text: caught at a company warehouse full
dialog: of hot items. He could've walked
dialog: away. All he had to do was say my
dialog: dad's name. But instead he shut
dialog: his mouth and did his time. He
dialog: did four years for us, and he did
dialog: 'em like a man. And we were very
dialog: grateful. So, Mr. Orange, you're
dialog: tellin me this very good friend of
dialog: mine, who did four years for my
dialog: father, who in four years never
dialog: made a deal, no matter what they
dialog: dangled in front of him, you're
dialog: telling me that now, that now this
dialog: man is free, and we're making good
dialog: on our commitment to him, he's
dialog: just gonna decide, right out of
dialog: the fuckin blue, to rip us off?
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Mr. Orange, why don't you tell me
dialog: what really happened?
speaker_heading: VOICE (OS)
dialog: Why? It'll just be more bullshit.
text: Eddie steps out of his C.U. and we see Joe Cabot standing
text: in the warehouse doorway. He walks into the room.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (pointing to Mr.
dialog: Orange)
dialog: This man set us up.
text: CAMERA does a 360 around the men.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know
dialog: what's happening.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: That's okay, Eddie, I do.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: (to Joe)
dialog: What the fuck are you talking
dialog: about?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (pointing to Mr.
dialog: Orange)
dialog: That piece of shit. Workin with
dialog: the cops.
scene_heading: MR. WHITE MR. PINK EDDIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I said this lump of shit is workin
dialog: with the LAPD.
speaker_heading: MR. ORANGE'S POV
text: Looking up from the floor at everybody.
text: Joe looks down at Mr. Orange.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Aren't you?
speaker_heading: MR. ORANGE (OS)
dialog: I don't have the slightest fuckin
dialog: idea what you're talkin about.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: (very calmly to Joe)
dialog: Joe, I don't know what you think
dialog: you know, but you're wrong.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Like hell I am.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: (very calmly)
dialog: Joe, trust me on this, you've made
dialog: a mistake. He's a good kid. I
dialog: understand you're hot, you're
dialog: super-fuckin pissed. We're all
dialog: real emotional. But you're
dialog: barking up the wrong tree. I know
dialog: this man, and he wouldn't do that.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You don't know jack shit. I do.
dialog: This rotten bastard tipped off the
dialog: cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr.
dialog: Blue killed.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: Mr. Blue's dead?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Dead as Dillinger.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: The motherfucker killed Vic.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: How do you know all this?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: He was the only one I wasn't a
dialog: hundred percent on. I should have
dialog: my fucking head examined for goin
dialog: forward when I wasn't a hundred
dialog: percent. But he seemed like a
dialog: good kid, and I was impatient and
dialog: greedy and all the things that
dialog: fuck you up.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: That's your proof?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You don't need proof when you got
dialog: instinct. I ignored it before,
dialog: but not no more.
text: He WHIPS out a revolver and aims it at Mr. Orange.
text: Mr. White brings his .45 up at Joe.
text: Eddie and Mr. Pink are shook awake by the flash of
dialog: firearms.
text: Eddie raises his gun, pointing it at Mr. White.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Have you lost your fucking mind?
dialog: Put your gun down!
text: Mr. Pink fades into the B.G., wanting no part of this.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Joe, you're making a terrible
dialog: mistake I can't let you make.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Stop pointing your fuckin gun at
dialog: daddy!
text: Joe, never taking his eyes off Mr. Orange.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry
dialog: have been friends a long time, he
dialog: ain't gonna shoot. We like each
dialog: other too much.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Joe, if you kill that man, you die
dialog: next. Repeat, if you kill that
dialog: man, you die next!
dialog: We get many different angles of the Mexican standoff.
scene_heading: MEDIUMS ON EVERYBODY
text: Mr. Orange holding his belly, looking from left to right.
text: Joe pointing down on Mr. Orange. Not taking his eyes off
dialog: him.
text: Mr. White pointing at Joe, looking like he's ready to
dialog: start firing any minute.
text: Eddie scared shitless for his father, gun locked on Mr.
dialog: White.
text: Mr. Pink walking backwards away from the action.
text: Nobody says nothing.
speaker_heading: FOUR SHOT
text: of guys ready for violence. Mr. Pink in the B.G.
speaker_heading: MR. PINK
dialog: C'mon, guys, nobody wants this.
dialog: We're supposed to me fuckin
dialog: professionals!
text: Joe raises his head to Mr. White.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Larry, I'm gonna kill him.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do
dialog: this!
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Larry, I'm askin you to trust me
dialog: on this.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: Don't ask me that.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'm not askin, I'm betting.
text: Joe's eyes go back to Mr. Orange.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Daddy, don't!
text: Joe FIRES three times, HITTING Mr. Orange with every one.
text: Mr. White SHOOTS Joe twice in the face. Joe brings his
text: hands up to his face, screaming, and falls to the ground.
text: Eddie FIRES at Mr. White, HITTING him three times in the
dialog: chest.
text: Mr. White brings his gun around on Eddie and SHOOTS him.
text: The two men FALL to their knees, FIRING at each other.
text: Eddie COLLAPSES, dead.
text: Joe's dead.
text: Mr. Orange lies perfectly still, except for his chest
text: heaving. The only SOUND we hear is his loud breathing.
text: Mr. White is SHOT full of holes, but still on his knees,
text: not moving.
text: Mr. Pink is standing motionless. Finally he grabs the
text: satchel of diamonds and RUNS out the door.
text: We hear outside a CAR START. Then the SOUND of a BULLHORN
dialog: yells out:
speaker_heading: POLICE FORCE (OS)
dialog: Freeze! Get out of the car and lie
dialog: face down on the ground!
speaker_heading: MR. PINK (OS)
dialog: Don't shoot!
text: We now hear SIRENS, the SOUNDS of more CARS DRIVING UP,
text: MEN RUNNING to the warehouse.
text: While all this noise is going on, Mr. White tries to stand
text: but FALLS DOWN. He somehow makes it to where Mr. Orange
dialog: lies.
text: He lifts Mr. Orange's head, cradling it in his lap and
text: stroking his brow.
speaker_heading: MR. WHITE
dialog: (with much effort)
dialog: Sorry, kid. Looks like we're
dialog: gonna do a little time.
text: Mr. Orange looks up at him and, with even more of an
dialog: effort:
speaker_heading: MR. ORANGE
dialog: I'm a cop.
text: Mr. White doesn't say anything, he keeps stroking Orange's
dialog: brow.
speaker_heading: MR. ORANGE
dialog: I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
text: Mr. White lifts his .45 and places the barrel between Mr.
text: Orange's eyes.
text: The CAMERA MOVES into an EXTREME C.U. of Mr White.
text: The SOUNDS of outside STORM inside. We don't see
text: anything, but we HEAR a bunch of shotguns COCKING.
speaker_heading: POLICE FORCE (OS)
dialog: Freeze, motherfucker! Drop your
dialog: fucking gun!
dialog: 
text: Mr White looks up at them, smiles, PULLS the trigger.
speaker_heading: BANG
text: We hear a BURST of SHOTGUN FIRE.
text: Mr. White is BLOWN out of frame, leaving it empty.
dialog:
