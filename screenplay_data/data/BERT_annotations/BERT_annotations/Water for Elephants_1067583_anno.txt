scene_heading: EXT. MODERN CIRCUS GROUNDS - PRESENT DAY - NIGHT
text: An upstate New York town. A CIRCUS is being dismantled...The

text: being loaded with animals.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - CIRCUS GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
scene_heading: AN ELDERLY MAN , JACOB JANKOWSKI - 93 year old - stands
text: alone, with a walker in the middle of the empty parking lot.
text: His shirt is stained with sweat - as if it took great effort
text: for him to get there. As he watches the Circus disappear,
text: Jacob looks lost, bewildered and fragile.
text: CHARLIE, 50's circus manager, and RUSS, a tattooed teen with
text: rings through his eyebrows, approach him with a wheelchair.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Excuse me sir, can we help you?
dialog: (No reply from Jacob)
dialog: Did you miss your ride?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I missed the Spec.
speaker_heading: RUSS
dialog: The what?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yes, I'm afraid you did. Can we
dialog: call someone for you?
speaker_heading: JACOB
speaker_heading: (SAD)
dialog: Where'd it all go?
speaker_heading: RUSS
dialog: He's seriously old.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Did you come with the folks from
dialog: the retirement home?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No, I came on my own.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (IGNORING HIM)
dialog: Let's go inside and we can call

text: Charlie motions for Russ to get Jacob in the wheelchair.
text: Jacob resists.

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No, I told ya, I came on my own and
dialog: I'm not going back. Get your hands
dialog: off me.
speaker_heading: RUSS
dialog: (as if talking to a child)
dialog: It's OK. We're gonna call the home

speaker_heading: JACOB
speaker_heading: (SUDDENLY LUCID)
dialog: Why don't you pick some of those
dialog: rings out ya head maybe you won't
dialog: be so stupid, ya dumb little shit.
speaker_heading: RUSS
dialog: Woah! The language. Uncalled for.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Sir, we need to get you out of this
dialog: parking lot. My trucks have to come
dialog: through here. Please...
text: He offers the wheelchair. Jacob relents and sits.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I got it Russ. Take the walker.
text: Finish closing up the ticket booth.
text: Russ takes the walker and exits as Charlie wheels Jacob.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: In my day, they had old timers in
dialog: the ticket wicket and freaks like
dialog: him in the sideshow. Damn kid
dialog: didn't even know what the Spec was.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You sound like you know circuses.
text: Charlie checks his watch, impatient to get Jacob home.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I should. I was on two.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (Calling OS to Trucks)

dialog: (Patronizing, to Jacob)
dialog: Two circuses. Wow, that's

dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Ringling, of course, but that was
dialog: later...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'll need your name when I call the
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: ...First one was called Benzini
dialog: Brothers Most Spectacular Show ...
text: Charlie suddenly stops upon hearing that name.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What?...Wait a minute! Did you say
dialog: you were with the Benzini Brothers?
speaker_heading: (JACOB NODS)
dialog: What years?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: 1931.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: "31?...You're saying you were there
dialog: for the---?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I was in the middle of it.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (INCREDULOUS)
dialog: I don't believe this. After the
dialog: Hartford Fire and the Hagenback-
dialog: Wallace Wreck, that's the most
dialog: famous circus disaster of all time.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I remember it like yesterday...
dialog: Better - cause I don't remember
dialog: yesterday.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (EXTENDS HAND)

dialog: Ah, I remember you...Camel would've
dialog: loved this stuff.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Camels drink scotch?
text: Jacob laughs, shaking his head No. Charlie pours another;
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: You really got here on you're own?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: The Great Escape! But I got lost.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I should call the home, let them
dialog: know where you are.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I don't know why they call it a
dialog: "home". You don't know anybody
dialog: there. They fill you so full of
dialog: drugs, you don't care...Five kids
dialog: and not one has a place for me
dialog: since their mother died. They take
dialog: turns visiting me on weekends. They
dialog: forgot whose turn it was today so
dialog: nobody showed up..
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I had a life, ya know. A big
dialog: life...It isn't right.
text: Charlie empathizes. Pours another. Changes the subject.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So, how did the Benzini Brothers
dialog: stampede start? The story is two
dialog: guys got thrown off the train and--
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No point in telling a story if all
dialog: you want to know is the end.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Sorry. From the beginning.

speaker_heading: JACOB (V.O.)
dialog: It was a big day. My final exams.
scene_heading: INT. JANKOWSKI HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - MORNING
text: Jacob bounds down the stairs and into the kitchen.
text: JACOB'S MOTHER AND FATHER are finishing up breakfast. The
text: Father tunes a Philco Radio while smoking a pipe...The Mother
text: pours coffee wearing a cardigan sweater and pearls.
text: Late for class, Jacob grabs a piece of bread and bacon and
text: downs a coffee as his mother sweetly scolds him in POLISH...
text: His father says something supportive in POLISH as well. Jacob
text: thanks him in POLISH. He kisses his mother and exits.
scene_heading: EXT. JANKOWSKI HOUSE - ITHACA NY - 1931 - MORNING
text: A simple, clapboard house in a middle class neighborhood.

speaker_heading: E. JANKOWSKI
dialog: Doctor of Veterinary Medicine
scene_heading: EXT. CORNELL UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - 1931 - ITHACA, NY - DAY.
text: The beautiful campus of Cornell University. Jacob runs.
speaker_heading: JACOB (V.O.)
text: After six years of dissections,
text: castrations, foalings and shoving
dialog: my arm up a cow's ass more times
dialog: than I cared to remember, I was
dialog: finally going to graduate Cornell
dialog: in Veterinary Science. I was summa

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
scene_heading: INT. CORNELL UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL, 1931 - ITHACA, NY - DAY
text: Jacob sits beside a beautiful Blonde who distracts him with
text: her legs. She notices him staring, crosses her legs and
text: smooths her skirt.
text: VETERINARY SCIENCES FINAL EXAMS is written on the board of a
text: Lecture Hall. The Proctor announces from his desk.
speaker_heading: THE PROCTOR
dialog: You may begin.
text: Jacob, the Blonde and fifty other students open their exam
text: booklets and begin under The PROCTOR's supervision.
speaker_heading: JACOB (V.O.)
dialog: I had my whole life planned. I knew
dialog: exactly where it was taking me...
text: And then, with the opening of a
text: door, it all vanished.
text: The Lecture Hall door opens and DEAN WILKINS enters. The Dean
text: walks to the Proctor and they confer privately. Then:
speaker_heading: THE PROCTOR
dialog: Mr. Jankowski? May we have a word?
text: Fifty pairs of eyes turn to look at Jacob, who looks up.
scene_heading: EXT. LECTURE HALL - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Jacob steps outside with Dean Wilkins.
speaker_heading: DEAN WILKINS
dialog: Jacob, it's your parents. I'm
dialog: afraid there's been a car accident.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - ITHACA HOSPITAL - NIGHT
text: Jacob walks down a dimly lit hall with a Police Chief and a
text: Chaplain to the Morgue led by a Nurse. We follow them inside.
scene_heading: INT. CORONER'S MORGUE - ITHACA HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
text: The room is windowless and bare except for TWO GURNEYS, each
text: with a sheet-covered body. A CORONER stands between them.
text: Jacob sees a steel table upon which lay his parents
text: belongings; wedding rings, pearl necklace, his father's pipe.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: CORONER
dialog: Are you ready?
text: The Chaplain places a comforting hand on Jacob's shoulder.
text: Jacob nods. The Coroner exposes first Jacob's father, then
text: Jacob's mother. We see only Jacob's expression:
speaker_heading: CHAPLAIN
dialog: Is there any other family to call?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No. Just me.
scene_heading: INT. EDMUND HYDE LAW OFFICES - DAY
text: Jacob, in a black suit. Mr. Hyde is seated opposite him.
speaker_heading: HYDE
dialog: I know this is difficult for you,
dialog: but there's been no mistake. The
dialog: house and all their assets,
dialog: including your father's practise,
dialog: are now property of the bank in
dialog: default of the mortgage.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: But I'm telling you, my father put
dialog: away every penny he ever earned.
dialog: They owned that house outright. Why
dialog: would he have a mortgage?
speaker_heading: HYDE
dialog: My guess is because he let people
dialog: pay him in beans &amp; eggs or whatever
dialog: they had, instead of money.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: And so he's penalized for not
dialog: turning away people who couldn't
dialog: afford his help? He was a doctor.
speaker_heading: HYDE
dialog: Yes, I know, he was a very good man
dialog: but in banking terms, in the
dialog: reality of what makes this world
dialog: actually function, he was an
dialog: irresponsible man. I'm sorry, but
dialog: you oughta to know the truth. This
dialog: Depression is going to last for a
dialog: long while..
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: HYDE (CONT'D)
dialog: ..And the only ones who will be
text: standing at the end of it, are the
dialog: ones who fight to take what they
dialog: need to survive. Everyone else is
dialog: going to disappear. Don't make the
dialog: same mistakes as your father.
text: Jacob is disturbed by this description of his father.
scene_heading: EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - OUTSIDE ITHACA, NY - DAY
text: Jacob in his black suit walking home..looks up ahead to see:
scene_heading: EXT. JANKOWSKI HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: All the family possessions are on the lawn being scoured over
text: by strangers: father's Philco radio, mother's jewelry...A
text: foreclosure sign hangs beside his father's business sign:
speaker_heading: JACOB (V.O.)
dialog: Things happened so fast, my head
dialog: was spinning. And that mortgage...I
dialog: just couldn't figure it out.
text: A DELIVERY TRUCK pulls up at the curb. It is met by A BANK
text: REPRESENTATIVE, who receives a package and carries it to
text: Jacob, meeting him halfway.
scene_heading: BANK REPRESENTATIVE
dialog: This just came for you, Jacob.
dialog: Whatever it is I'm going to have to
dialog: include in the bank's report of
dialog: assets. Sorry. You OK?
speaker_heading: (JACOB NODS)
dialog: I also have documents to sign..
text: The Bank Representative continues MOS as Jacob opens the
dialog: package,
speaker_heading: JACOB (V.O.)
dialog: I didn't believe the lawyer or the
dialog: bank. My mother worked. They had
dialog: savings. We were never broke. So
dialog: why would they need a mortgage?
dialog: And then it hit me...
text: Jacob opens the package revealing a BRAND NEW SIGN, reading;
scene_heading: E. JANKOWSKI AND SON
scene_heading: DOCTORS OF VETERINARY MEDICINE
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: JACOB (V.O.)
dialog: They did it to pay for my Ivy
dialog: League education.
text: For a moment Jacob can't move. This thought stuns him. With
text: his house being picked apart and the Bank Representative
text: speaking about papers, Jacob can't take it any longer. He
text: drops the sign and walks away. The Bank Rep calls after him:
scene_heading: BANK REPRESENTATIVE
dialog: Jacob? Jacob they need these signed
text: by the end of the business day.
text: Jacob walks away from the Bank Rep, pulling off his tie and
text: tossing it. He is crying - the reality finally hitting him.
speaker_heading: JACOB (V.O.)
dialog: I walked and I kept on walking...
dialog: It's a strange feeling becoming an
dialog: orphan the same time you're
dialog: becoming a man...To have this
dialog: freedom to be anything you want at
dialog: the same time everything you were
dialog: is taken away. So I just walked
dialog: ...Then all of a sudden, I stopped.
scene_heading: EXT. A CLEARING NEAR A STREAM - OUTSKIRTS OF ITHACA - NIGHT
text: Jacob stands with his feet in a clear stream. He is no longer
text: crying. There are dense woods, pitch black, all around him.
speaker_heading: JACOB (V.O.)
dialog: Like I'd been sleepwalking and I
dialog: woke up. I had no idea where I was.
text: Jacob can hear the buzz of insects, the glow of fireflies and
text: the cries of distant animals in the woods. It unnerves him.
text: Far off beyond the dense woods Jacob sees A MOVING FLICKERING
text: LIGHT - like a distant, silent star moving past the trees.
text: The Light is moving around the woods until it curves towards
text: Jacob's direction. He hears a distant CLANK-CLANK...
text: Curious, Jacob puts his shoes on and walks back to a gravel
text: path that leads to TRAIN TRACKS just as:
text: THE MASSIVE TRAIN ENGINE EXPLODES INTO VIEW PASSING HIM.
text: Jacob is so close, he is hit by a wall of wind that nearly
text: knocks him down. It is dark and the train is moving fast.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: What is it inside of us makes us
dialog: decide to grab onto life again and
dialog: again, no matter how many times it
dialog: abandons us without a second
dialog: thought?...What is it makes us
dialog: hungry for more of the same?
dialog: Somebody smart should figure that
dialog: one out.
text: Jacob makes his decision: He runs parallel to the
text: train...stumbling over gravel, pitching forward and losing
text: his balance, recovering, then running faster, scanning for
text: something to grab hold of to hoist himself up. He sees:
text: AN OPEN STOCK CAR IS THREE CARS BEHIND HIM...As it catches up
text: to him, he lunges forward, reaching for the iron grab hold
text: and flings himself upward. He clings on with his left leg,
text: elbow and chin. His right hand clings to the grab hold. With
text: his left hand, he claws the floorboards of the stock car, but
text: the aged wood scraps off under his fingers. His right leg is
text: dangling, beneath the train itself, dangerously close to the
text: tracks. Jacob is slipping...slipping...
dialog: With everything he's got, Jacob makes one final "life or
text: death" effort, managing to get his left knee up over the
text: edge. Using foot, knee, chin, elbow and fingernails, he
text: scrapes his way inside the stock car and lies panting...
scene_heading: INT. STOCK CAR - EN ROUTE - NIGHT
text: A dim light barely illuminates the interior. Jacob breaths a
text: brief sigh of relief and accomplishment when suddenly: A HUGE
text: HAND CONNECTED TO A EVEN LARGER ARM COMES OUT OF THE
text: DARKNESS, GRABBING JACOB BY HIS COLLAR, HOISTING HIM UP.
text: Jacob swings at this Brute with his free arm but it's blocked
text: easily, as the Brute moves him to the open car door.
speaker_heading: OLD TIMER (O.S.)
dialog: Oh, don't go messin with Blackie.
dialog: Throwing people off of trains is
text: one of the perks of his job.
text: Jacob can now see THREE MEN playing cards by a kerosene lamp.
text: ONE MAN HAS A RIFLE, aimed at Jacob. Another, A SHRUNKEN,
text: STUBBLE FACED OLD TIMER, drinks out of a jug...
text: Blackie holds Jacob out on the edge of the open stock car, as
text: trees slam against the train almost cutting Jacob's face.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: BLACKIE
dialog: We don't need no bums on this train
dialog: brother. You can get off right now
dialog: and keep running.
text: Old Timer rises with a lantern and hobbles on one bad leg,
text: inspects Jacob and his nice suit with the lantern...
speaker_heading: OLD TIMER
dialog: Now everybody calm down here. Grady
dialog: put that damn rifle away. BLACKIE
dialog: LET'IM GO...And I mean on the
dialog: inside of the train!
text: Jacob struggles as Blackie pins one arm behind him.
speaker_heading: OLD TIMER (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm tellin ya, ya can't red light
dialog: him, we don't need that trouble.
dialog: Look at them clothes - he's no bum.
text: Blackie scans Jacob's clothes, then tosses him inside the
text: train and returns to the card game. Jacob pants, relieved.
speaker_heading: OLD TIMER (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't be sore kid. It's more like a
dialog: reflex with Blackie. I'm Camel..And
dialog: that there's Grady. And Bill.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Jacob. Jankowski. Nice to meet you.
speaker_heading: CAMEL
dialog: You're pretty young for the rails.
dialog: You running from something boy? You
dialog: on the lam?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No. Nothing like that.
speaker_heading: CAMEL
dialog: Where you headed?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: CAMEL
dialog: Hungry? Outta work?
speaker_heading: (JACOB NODS)
dialog: No shame in it. What can you do?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: About anything I guess.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
text: Camel gives him the once-over look then offers the jug.
speaker_heading: CAMEL
dialog: We land in Deposit in the morning.
dialog: We'll find you some work. And if
dialog: you're still alive by the end of
dialog: it, I'll get you some food and take
dialog: you to Uncle August.
text: Jacob drinks and chokes on the liquor.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Who's that?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: August Rosenbluth...Lord and Master
dialog: of the Known and Unknown Universes.
dialog: Ringmaster Extraordinaire.
text: Jacob looks baffled. Camel laughs as he drinks more;
speaker_heading: CAMEL
dialog: Oh kid, don't tell me you didn't
dialog: notice?
text: Grady and Bill laugh though Blackie remains un-amused.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Ha, he really don't know.
speaker_heading: CAMEL
dialog: HA! You didn't just jump a train
dialog: boy. You jumped the Flying Squadron
dialog: of the Benzini Brothers Most

dialog: You done landed your ass on a
dialog: circus, kid!
text: PRE-LAP: The Circus Train brakes screeching to a halt!
scene_heading: INT. STOCK CAR - DEPOSIT, NY - DAWN.
text: Jacob is rolled awake as the train stops. He is disoriented
text: as Blackie, Grady and Bill jump out through the open stock
text: car door. Camel is fast asleep, drunk from the jug.
scene_heading: EXT. CIRCUS TRAIN/CIRCUS GROUNDS - DEPOSIT, NY - DAWN.
text: The Train has stopped adjacent to a huge grassy lot. Beyond
text: it, the scattered buildings of Deposit, NY backlit by dawn.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
text: Jacob jumps out of the stock car, in awe of what he sees::
text: Hundreds of dirty, unshaven men pouring out of the train
text: like ants on candy. The wagons of the train are painted
text: scarlet red with gold trim and sunburst wheels. Emblazoned on
text: each wagon; BENZINI BROTHERS MOST SPECTACULAR SHOW ON EARTH.
text: Jacob wanders as the Circus is being created: Canvas tents
text: are raised, the Big Top laying sprawled on the ground. Men
text: standing over seams, lacing pieces together...Eight man
text: sledge teams pound stakes into the ground at breakneck
text: speed....Teams of men are raising enormous poles with their
dialog: combined weight, chanting: Pull it! Shake it! Break it!
text: Again!...Now down stake it!...Several teams horses pulling
text: wagons are charging right for Jacob..
text: Jacob jumps out of the way, nearly being run down. He is out
dialog: of place...in the way of this finely tuned machine.
text: Jacob ducks into a LARGE TENT for safety.
scene_heading: INT. MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - MORNING
text: Jacob enters. A stillness takes the place of the chaos
text: outside: The translucent tent is as tall as the sky. It has
text: barely been set up - just the tent and:
text: THE ANIMALS.
text: Jacob is in awe. Camels, llamas, zebras and horses stand
text: behind low ropes slung between iron stakes, some with their
text: heads in mounds of hay.....Two giraffes stand within a chain-
text: link fence....lions, tigers, panthers, jaguars, bears, chimps
dialog: and an Orangutan.
text: The animals stop moving, as if to give Jacob an
text: acknowledgement. Jacob responds with a nod or a smile.
text: The Orangutan is stretching it's arm outside it's den for
text: something out of reach. Jacob tries to understand.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What is it? What do you want?
text: The Orangutan strains its arm. Blinking at him. Pointing.
text: Jacob looks around and sees A HALF SQUASHED ORANGE on the
text: ground in front of the cage. He picks it up.
text: Jacob opens the den and hands the Orangutan the orange. She
text: takes it and sets it on the floor of her den. She returns and
text: reaches out for Jacob again.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 14.
text: Jacob hesitates, not knowing what she wants. But deciding to
text: trust her, Jacob extends his hand to hers.
text: The Orangutan wraps her long fingers around Jacob's hand and
text: holds it for a beat, looking to his face. Jacob returns the
text: gaze, realizing she is thanking him. He is touched.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: You're welcome, ma'am.
text: The Orangutan lets go and returns to the orange in her den.
speaker_heading: CAMEL (O.S.)
dialog: What the hell you doing in here?
dialog: Get outta there!! You ain't a

scene_heading: EXT. MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - MORNING
text: Camel escorts Jacob through the grounds to a baggage car.
speaker_heading: CAMEL
dialog: Gonna try to get you set up with

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Do I call him Crazy Joe?
speaker_heading: CAMEL
dialog: It has been said Crazy Joe went to
dialog: prison for killing a man who spit
text: into the wind and hit the back of
dialog: Joe's neck. So no, I would not call
text: this man Crazy Joe to his face.
text: Camel and Jacob walks on to an open stock car door, where
text: CRAZY JOE stands - a burly man, missing three fingers.
speaker_heading: CAMEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey Joe! I got a First of May here.
dialog: Think you can use him?
text: Crazy Joe scans Jacob, shoots an oyster of dark brown tobacco
text: juice then disappears back inside. Camel tells Jacob;

text: Jacob and several other Flying Squadron men struggle to pull

scene_heading: INT. MENAGERIE TENT - DAY

text: in front of rows of ogling men - as she maneuvers her breasts
text: in circles flipping the tassels attached to them...The men
text: hoot and holler for more as Barbara smiles encouragingly,

text: Jacob is paralyzed by the sight of a naked woman.
text: Grady frantically motions for Jacob to snap out of it and use
text: the pipe at the heads sneaking under the tent to peek in...
text: Startled out of his enthrallment, Jacob lifts the pipe too
text: quickly and hits his own forehead. OW!..then proceeds to do
text: his job, banging the heads thru the flaps.
scene_heading: INT. CIRCUS GROUNDS/MENAGERIE TENT - DEPOSIT, NY - TWILIGHT
text: Jacob shovels ZEBRA manure, no longer affected by the scent.
text: By this point, the menagerie tent has been fully installed:
text: Ten chandeliers hang and twinkle from the roof illuminating
text: the a gloriously bannered candy stand in the tent's center.
text: Jacob hears someone entering the menagerie. He turns to see;
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 17.
text: Behind the rows of beautiful black and white horses, Jacob
text: catches flashes of pink sequins...pink tights...pink sequined
text: gloves of a WOMAN caressing and whispering to them.
text: She is MARLENA. Her shimmering eyes and hair. Her porcelain
text: skin. Her pink sequins make her glisten and sparkle...
text: Jacob is spellbound as he watches Marlena's gift with horses;
text: Marlena uses signals with her whip or clicking sounds with
text: her tongue to communicate with the horses: they line up at
text: her subtle command, they raise their hooves, they bow down to
text: her, rise up on their hind legs...
text: She clicks her tongue and one White Silver Maned Horse lifts
text: a hoof for her to inspect. She clicks for him to take a step.
text: Jacob notices the Silver Maned Horse walks tenderly on the
text: foot. He decides to help....Approaching the shimmering
text: Marlena, Jacob looks like he's been shovelling shit all day.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Excuse me, ma'am? Hi. I'm Jacob.
text: Marlena doesn't respond. She looks at him with suspicion.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: May I? He may be foundering.
text: Marlena nods. Jacob also clicks his tongue as he glides his
text: hands up Silver Star's fetlock. To Marlena's surprise, the
text: horse trusts Jacob, lifting its hoof. Jacob examines it.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: He should be all right for tonight.
dialog: But I'd put him on stall rest as
dialog: soon as possible.
text: He clicks his tongue and eases the hoof down. Marlena looks
text: both impressed and insulted. Jacob smiles. Marlena does not.
text: She clicks and assembles her horses in formation, then leads
text: them out of the menagerie....Jacob looks after her adoringly.

speaker_heading: UNCLE AUGUST
scene_heading: WELCOME TO THE MOST EXTRAVAGANT
scene_heading: EXTRAVAGANCY THE HUMAN EYE CAN

scene_heading: BENZINI BROTHERS MOST SPECTACULAR
dialog: SHOW ON EARTH!!!
dialog: Jacob arrives as we reveal:
scene_heading: THE EXTRAORDINARY GRANDEUR OF THE SPEC - EVERY ACT, EVERY
scene_heading: ANIMAL - IN FULL REGALIA, PARADE FOR THE AUDIENCE AS THE BAND
text: PLAYS. IN THE CENTER RING IS:
text: Jacob can barely contain himself...The Audience - young and
text: old - is captivated. Faces of poor Depression era townspeople
text: light up with joy and amazement;
text: During Jacob's lines we see; Clowns, jugglers, acrobats,
text: exotic animals, Marlena with her Horses, high divers on fire
text: diving into a tank of water...it is truly spectacular:
speaker_heading: JACOB (V.O.)
dialog: You never saw anything like it. You
dialog: could hardly take it all in without
dialog: fearing you might go blind from the
dialog: shine. From one kind of world too
dialog: hard to bear came some kind a
dialog: heaven no one knew existed.
text: End on Jacob seeing: Marlena gloriously atop her horses who
text: form a tableau, as a curtain of sparks falls behind them.
scene_heading: EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - DEPOSIT, NY - MIDDLE OF NIGHT
text: The Big Top drops. Poles topple. Horses, men and equipment
text: dismantle the great city of tents.
speaker_heading: JACOB (V.O.)
dialog: And then just as quickly, heaven
text: was packed away and gone.
scene_heading: INT. PERFORMER'S CAR - TRAIN EN ROUTE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
text: As the train travels, a worn out Jacob sits cramped under a
text: bunk beside A CONTORTIONIST taking up little space. Jacob
text: voraciously eats a plate of food Camel snuck in for him.
speaker_heading: CAMEL
dialog: You like the food? You deserve it.
dialog: You done good, I hear..
speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: CAMEL (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (JACOB CHOKES)
dialog: ..Woah, you better take a breath
dialog: before it all comes back up on ya.
dialog: Here. Have a hit of Jake.
text: He offers Jacob his "Jake". Jacob drinks and chokes.
speaker_heading: CAMEL (CONT'D)
dialog: It's an acquired taste. Now get
dialog: yourself outta there. I'm gonna
dialog: take you in to see August.
text: As Jacob squeezes out, the Contortionist unwinds himself and
text: takes up more space.
speaker_heading: JACOB
text: But it's the middle of the night.
speaker_heading: CAMEL
dialog: Only time circus people live - when
dialog: they don't have to work. Come on...
scene_heading: INT. SLEEPING CARS/ PLATFORM - TRAIN - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
text: Camel leads Jacob through various sleeping cars, revealing
text: the lowly conditions of life on the road...wooden bunks, no
text: private space, one bathroom for a dozen to share.
text: THROUGHOUT THIS NARRATION WE JUMP CUT INTO VARIOUS CARS:
dialog: - The Musicians Car: Men smoking, cleaning
text: instruments...looking at Jacob with suspicion and wry humor.
text: The Trumpet Player plays TAPS. Jacob doesn't understand why.
speaker_heading: CAMEL
dialog: I got a son about your age. Lives
dialog: outside of Reading, PA. Haven't
dialog: seen him for years. Fix your shirt
dialog: there.
text: Jacob shoves in his shirt. Camel smiles. He likes the kid.
text: - The Clown Car: Clowns without make-up reading or playing
text: cards. They look at Jacob as if he were walking the last
text: mile. One Clown waves goodbye.
speaker_heading: CAMEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Remember, when you meet August let
dialog: him do the talking and don't ever
dialog: mention Ringling. He hates them
dialog: bastards worse than the Depression.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 20.
dialog: - Barbara and the Coochie Girls Car; Girls in various forms
text: of undress, negligees, sheer robes. Barbara exits a bathroom
text: and bumps into Jacob, who fumbles seeing her half-nude;
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: How's your pipe, kid?
text: Camel leads the slack-jawed Jacob away.
speaker_heading: CAMEL
dialog: Night ladies.
speaker_heading: BARBARA AND GIRLS
dialog: Night Camel.
scene_heading: INT. PERFORMER STATEROOM CARS - TRAIN EN ROUTE - NIGHT
text: Slightly more upscale and private quarters with a passenger
text: aisle outside individual doors and windows.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Hey Camel - who's that woman who
dialog: works the horses?
speaker_heading: CAMEL
speaker_heading: (STOPS)
dialog: Now stop right there. That's
dialog: Marlena. She don't talk to nobody
dialog: and you don't talk to her. And
dialog: don't mention her to August. Ain't
dialog: no right way to talk about
dialog: somebody's wife and make it sound
dialog: like a compliment.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Wife?
text: Camel takes this opportunity to drink some Jake and ask:
speaker_heading: CAMEL
dialog: Look, kid, before we do this, I
dialog: gotta ask... ..I ain't tryin to
dialog: know your business but I do know
dialog: you ain't been on the road too
dialog: long. You're too clean, your
dialog: clothes too nice and you don't got
dialog: a possession on you. See, a man on
dialog: the road collects little things.
dialog: It's not a big life I can tell ya.
dialog: So before you start, I ask: if you
dialog: got any kind of life to go back to,
dialog: that's what you should do.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 21.
text: Jacob stops. He tries to not sound emotional when he says:
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I don't.
text: Camel studies him, as if understanding what isn't said.
speaker_heading: CAMEL
dialog: I am sorry to hear that.
text: They move on.
scene_heading: EXT. AUGUST'S PRIVATE CAR PLATFORM - TRAIN EN ROUTE - NIGHT
text: They reach a platform facing the fanciest car yet. Standing
text: upon it is an enormous, muscular BALD MAN, EARL...
speaker_heading: CAMEL
dialog: This here's Earl. He's gonna take
dialog: you in. Earl, this here's Jacob.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (shakes hands w/Camel)
dialog: I don't know how to thank you.
speaker_heading: CAMEL
dialog: HA! You may not want to after you
dialog: been on a show long as I have. Good
dialog: luck to ya, kid.
text: Camel exits OS. Alone with Earl, Jacob asks:
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Do I look OK?
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Very nice.
text: Then, with one hand Earl slides back the door and with the
text: other hand, violently grabs Jacob by the neck and throws him
text: head first into the car.
scene_heading: INT. AUGUST'S PRIVATE CAR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
text: Jacob falls into Uncle August's opulent private car, with
text: wood panelling, cushioned furniture and chandeliers.
text: Sitting at a table playing cards are CECIL the Barker,
scene_heading: DIAMOND JOE (menagerie and ring stock), MR. ERWIN (talent
text: booker), CRAZY JOE (baggage stock) and, with his back to us
text: in a high wing back chair, (UNCLE) AUGUST ROSENBLUTH.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 22.
text: Earl shoves him against the wall, dangling him off the floor.
text: As August speaks to Jacob, all we see is the back of his head
text: and smoke from his cigar as he plays cards throughout...
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: That stowaway the old drunk took
text: under his wing. College boy.
text: Jacob tries to explain but Earl bangs him against the wall.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: (to the game)
dialog: I'll see your three and raise you
dialog: five...
speaker_heading: (TO JACOB)
dialog: I don't believe I've had the
dialog: pleasure.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Jacob Jankowski, sir.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: And what is a "Jacob Jankowski" and
dialog: why he is on my train?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Just looking for work, sir.
speaker_heading: MR. ERWIN
dialog: Can you fly? Set yourself on fire?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No sir.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Ever worked a show, son?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No sir.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Ever been to a show?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Yes sir...
text: Jacob, sensing where this is going, gets August's attention;
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Ringling Brothers.
text: August stops playing cards. The others react with sudden
text: apprehension. Earl casually shakes his head to warn Jacob.
text: August finally rises and turns to Camera: handsome,
text: charismatic, fiercely intelligent...matinee idol looks that
dialog: mask a darker nature.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Ringling, you say?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Yes. But it was terrible.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Really? Have you seen our show?
speaker_heading: (JACOB NODS)
dialog: What was your favorite act?
text: Jacob sees a CIRCUS POSTER with Marlena and her Horses.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: The uh...the one with the black and
text: white horses. And the girl in pink.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Ah, our Star Attraction. Well, I
dialog: believe we're looking for a boy to
dialog: carry water for the elephants,
dialog: aren't we Diamond Joe?
speaker_heading: DIAMOND JOE
dialog: We don't have an eleph-
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Shut-up.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I would do that, sir. I'd like to
dialog: work with the animals.
text: August and the others chuckle. Jacob doesn't understand why.
text: August crosses to Jacob, as he ridicules:
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: And you'd carry water for
dialog: elephants? Ha, ha...you have any
dialog: idea how much water an elephant
dialog: drinks, kid? College! Pfft! Never
dialog: met a college man yet who knew his
dialog: own ass from shinola.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (MORE SINISTER)
dialog: You eat my food and you ride my
dialog: train like you're entitled to
dialog: survive. But you see, nothing
dialog: survives here without my
dialog: permission...Maybe if you tell me
dialog: you're nothing, I'll let you stay,
dialog: although my bet is you won't last.
text: Jacob refuses to let August demean him. He stays silent.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: You smell like every kind of shit.
dialog: Why would a college boy want that?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Times are hard for everybody...And
dialog: I guess because ... out of all the
dialog: dirt and sweat and shit and working
dialog: with fellas you don't want to be
dialog: caught dead meeting in the
dialog: daylight, comes...so much beauty.
text: We think August and the men are moved by Jacob's words.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: That's beautifully put.
speaker_heading: (THEN:)
dialog: Toss him off, Earl. And make sure
dialog: you see the red light before you
text: red light him.
text: As Earl drags Jacob in tow, August derides him to the others;
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
text: Another sonny boy mad at mommy and
dialog: daddy for paying the bills. Sounds
dialog: like he studied poetry.
speaker_heading: CRAZY JOE
dialog: I got no use for people who rhyme.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (shouts as he is dragged)
dialog: It was veterinary science! And I
dialog: can tell you one thing - that Star
dialog: Attraction horse of yours won't be
dialog: walking in a few days let alone
dialog: performing center ring!!
text: August stops and turns.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Earl wait!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 25.
text: Earl stops with Jacob. Now all the men are intrigued...
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: Veterinary science?
dialog: (Earl stops with Jacob)
dialog: May I ask what school?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Cornell.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
speaker_heading: (IMPRESSED)
dialog: You're a Cornell graduate?
text: Jacob lies and nods...August wonders whether to trust Jacob.
speaker_heading: DIAMOND JOE
dialog: Marlena did want a vet to take a
dialog: look at Silver Star. They cost.
speaker_heading: CECIL
dialog: He worked the rubes for me this
dialog: afternoon. Pretty good.
speaker_heading: CRAZY JOE
dialog: He shovelled horse shit. Don't make
dialog: him a horse doctor.
text: August looks reluctant. Until Jacob caps it:
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I hear Ringling has its own vet.
text: The other men can't believe Jacob spoke up like this. But it
text: amuses August, who faces him and smiles;
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: All right, Cornell. Come with me.
text: August leads Jacob out.
scene_heading: EXT. PLATFORM - TRAIN EN ROUTE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
text: August and Jacob exit onto the platform.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Are you sure-footed, Jacob
dialog: Jankowski?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I believe so.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Good.
text: Without missing a beat, August leans forward, catches hold of
text: something around the side of the car and disappears.
speaker_heading: JACOB
speaker_heading: JESUS CHRIST!
text: The train jerks a curve. Jacob almost falls.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (O.S.)
dialog: COME ON THEN!
text: Jacob looks up to see:
text: August is on the roof of the train: his face moonlit, his
text: hair blowing wildly in the wind...He points downward.
text: Jacob, none too pleased, advances to the edge of the platform
text: as the train speeds by, and looks where August is pointing;
text: He can see the edge of a thin iron ladder. He wipes his hands
text: on his thighs. Focuses. Then leaps...
text: Jacob's right hand meets the ladder. His left grasps wildly
text: until it ensnares the other side. His feet jam into the
text: rungs. Jacob climbs to the roof.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - TRAIN EN ROUTE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
text: August gives Jacob a hand up and they sit cross legged.
text: POV; THE LENGTH OF THE TRAIN AHEAD OF THEM STRETCHES LIKE A
text: GIANT SNAKE MOVING IN THE NIGHT, BENDING ROUND A CURVE.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: It's a breath taking sight, isn't
dialog: it? Always gets me.
speaker_heading: (THEN:)
dialog: I can't get a new Liberty Horse mid-
dialog: season. So you make sure this horse
dialog: performs and the job's yours. Nine
dialog: bucks a week. If you cross me, I'll
dialog: feed you to my meat eaters and
dialog: there won't be a trace left of
dialog: you...
text: Jacob hangs on every word. August smiles;
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: You do right by me, Jacob
dialog: Jankowski...I'll show you what it's
dialog: like to travel every inch of this
dialog: country, every inch of this world,
dialog: and be welcomed home in every
dialog: street, be loved in every
dialog: town...I'll give you a life most
dialog: suckers can't dream of.
text: Jacob is mesmerized by August. August stands and tap dances
text: across the roofs. Jacob has no choice but to follow...
text: The two men dance and leap atop the train from car to car
text: across the moving train...Jacob grows increasingly confident
text: and euphoric following August's exultant lead.
scene_heading: INT. RING STOCK CAR - TRAIN EN ROUTE - NIGHT
text: August drops into the Ring Stock Car followed by Jacob. On
text: one side is a line of Marlena's Black and White Show Horses.
text: The other side, there is a makeshift door.
text: August kicks through the door, revealing a small room;
scene_heading: INT. KINKO'S ROOM - TRAIN EN ROUTE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
text: This makeshift room is lit by a kerosene lamp on a crate next
text: to a cot, propped up by a wall of trunks.
text: A DWARF "KINKO" (WALTER) is reading on his cot. He has red
text: hair. He and August greet each other with polite disgust...
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Kinko.
speaker_heading: KINKO (WALTER)
dialog: August.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: This is Jacob. He's going to bunk
dialog: with you a while.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: How do you do?
speaker_heading: KINKO (WALTER)
dialog: What is he?
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: I said his name is Jacob.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: KINKO (WALTER)
dialog: I asked what, not who.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: He's going to help out in the
dialog: menagerie.
speaker_heading: KINKO (WALTER)
dialog: A menagerie man? Performers don't
text: bunk with working men.
text: There's a growl from his loyal Russell terrier, QUEENIE.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Well there are performers..
dialog: (his hand indicates high
speaker_heading: STANDARD)
dialog: And then there are performers..
dialog: (his hand indicates lower
dialog: "Kinko" standard)
dialog: Considering we used to keep the
dialog: goats in here, I'm sure Marlena's
dialog: horses out there object to now
dialog: sharing their quarters with you. Of
dialog: course I can always change that and
dialog: send you back to a bottom bunk with
dialog: the other kinkers who sorely miss
dialog: your sunny personality and
dialog: affectionate camaraderie.
dialog: (Kinko knows this threat)
dialog: This gentleman is the show's new
dialog: veterinarian - Ivy League no less -
dialog: which puts him a good deal higher
dialog: than you in my estimation. Perhaps
dialog: you'd like to offer him your cot.
text: As the kerosene lamp light flickers in August's face, Kinko
text: knows he has no choice. August smiles and turns to leave.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll find you in the morning. Sleep
dialog: well, Cornell.
text: August exits....Jacob is left staring at resentful Kinko and
text: Queenie, who snarls at him. Jacob tries to be friendly:
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: A Jack Russell. They're very smart.
speaker_heading: KINKO (WALTER)
speaker_heading: (CALMLY)
dialog: Queenie attack.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 29.
text: Queenie jumps at Jacob, growling, hunch backed. Jacob is
text: pressed against the wall. Kinko returns to his book.
speaker_heading: KINKO (WALTER) (CONT'D)
dialog: You're not getting the cot.
scene_heading: EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - LIBERTY, NY - DAWN.
text: Jacob is washing himself with dirty water out of a bucket
text: beside Camel. Camel starts hitting his leg. He laughs:
speaker_heading: CAMEL
dialog: Ha, this gam of mine keeps falling
dialog: asleep on me. Pretty soon the only
dialog: place for me is going to be selling
dialog: tickets but I'm too ugly for that.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (O.S.)
dialog: Jacob!
text: Camel straightens up when August appears, clearly on his
text: guard. He turns his back to continue washing.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: We can do better than this for our
dialog: new vet. I'll arrange for you to
dialog: start getting your own water bucket
dialog: like the performers and bosses. Two
dialog: buckets per person. Come...
text: August walks away as Jacob hurries to follow...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: See ya Camel.
speaker_heading: CAMEL
dialog: (sips his Jake)
dialog: Yeah, take care kid.
scene_heading: INT PERFORMER'S TENT - LIBERTY, NY - CONTINUOUS - TWILIGHT
text: August and Jacob enter a more upscale tent where male
text: performers are washing from personal buckets of water.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: You'll need new clothes too. I'll
dialog: set you up with the Monday Man.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Monday Man?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: What day of the week did your
dialog: mother hang out the wash to dry?
speaker_heading: JACOB
speaker_heading: (REALIZING)
dialog: He takes other people's clothes?
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: It's the Depression, Cornell. Where
dialog: have you been? Oh right - Cornell.
text: Kinko is bathing with his two buckets when August snatches
text: one of them away.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: Here, use Kinko's second bucket for
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: (TO KINKO)
dialog: You barely use up one.
text: Kinko fumes. Jacob tries to placate.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: August, it's all right, I'll--
speaker_heading: AUGUST
speaker_heading: (IGNORES HIM)
dialog: If you need a razor, there are some
dialog: back there with my name on them.
text: August walks away. Jacob follows August away from Kinko.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: August..
text: When August stops, Jacob is caught off guard...
speaker_heading: AUGUST
speaker_heading: (SINCERE)
dialog: It's good to have an educated man
dialog: like you around. I need one other
dialog: sane individual in this operation.
speaker_heading: JACOB
speaker_heading: (COMPLIMENTED)
dialog: Thank you for everything, August.
text: August pats his back and exits. Jacob heads for the bucket.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (O.S.)
dialog: Ah...Jacob?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: JACOB
speaker_heading: (STOPS)
dialog: Yes, August?
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: The horse.
text: August wants Jacob to follow him to the horse. Jacob thought
dialog: he was going to bathe.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Oh! Yes...The horse.
text: Jacob follows behind August's commanding stride.
scene_heading: EXT. RING STOCK CAR - LIBERTY, NY - MORNING
text: Diamond Joe and GREG, a ring stock man in overalls, are
text: leading the Marlena's horses out of the ring stock car...
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: I'm sure it's nothing serious.
dialog: Don't tell my wife I said this but
text: she coddles them too much. She has
dialog: a particularly strong affection for
dialog: Silver Star. I don't encourage it.
dialog: It's unhealthy to love an animal
dialog: that much...Here she is.
text: Marlena runs up to them, still in her bed clothes/robe.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: Darling, meet Jacob Jankowski,
dialog: Benzini Brothers own veterinarian.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: It's a pleasure to meet you.
text: Marlena barely acknowledges Jacob - keeping their previous
text: meeting a secret (for which Jacob is grateful). August puts
text: his arm around her and they kiss.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Last stall. Lead the way, doc.
text: They enter the ring stock car...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 32.
scene_heading: INT. RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - LIBERTY, NY - MORNING
text: Jacob, Marlena and August arrive at the stall to see Silver
text: Star is laying down. He is breathing heavily, his rib cage
text: rising and falling. Jacob immediately senses the worst.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Jesus, Marlena, he wasn't this bad
dialog: in the show.
text: Jacob moves to examine the horse, but he flinches in pain.
text: Marlena takes over, by sitting besides Silver Star's head,
text: and stroking his head while singing a soft lullaby.
text: Jacob registers Marlena's soothing effect causes Silver Star
text: to relax...his breathing grows calmer. So Jacob begins to
text: examine him as Marlena watches protectively.
text: Jacob runs his right hand down the leg to the fetlock. He
text: lays his hand on the hoof then place his thumb and forefinger
text: on the back of the fetlock. He looks at the sole of the hoof,
text: which is bulging and dark with a red line around the edge.
text: Jacob's expression tells us this is a bad sign.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: Is that the problem?
speaker_heading: (JACOB NODS)
dialog: Do you need any hoof testers?
dialog: Diamond Joe has them...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Not yet.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Well, how are you going to fix it?
text: Marlena looks at him coolly, expecting an explanation. Jacob
text: doesn't want to tell her the truth.
text: Jacob looks to August and rises, leaving Marlena with the
text: horse. Jacob pulls August away to whisper.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I didn't want to say anything in
dialog: front of... Mrs. Rosenbluth...he's
text: already foundering.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: English.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: This horse isn't getting back on
dialog: his feet, August. If there was
dialog: anything I could do, I would but
dialog: we're going to have to put him
dialog: down...I'm real sorry.
text: Beat. August's stares at Jacob - or rather, stares through
text: him. A dead stare that lasts just a beat or two too
text: long...And then just as suddenly, the look is gone:
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: I know you are. Come with me.
text: August exits. Jacob doesn't know what this means. He follows.
scene_heading: EXT. COOKHOUSE TENT - LIBERTY, NY - TWILIGHT
text: TWO BUCKETS FILLED WITH PUTRID MEAT. Flies buzzing on top.
text: Diamond Joe finishes filling the buckets as August grabs one.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Joe, bad report for Silver Star I'm
dialog: afraid. Jacob here says there's no
dialog: hope. We're going to have to put
dialog: him down...
text: Diamond Joe registers a concerned, anxious look to Jacob.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: ...So I need you to round up Pete
dialog: and Greg, get a wagon and a harness
text: stretcher. He has to be hauled.
speaker_heading: DIAMOND JOE
dialog: A harness what?
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Jacob and I'll take care of the
dialog: cats. We'll meet you back at the
dialog: stall.
speaker_heading: (TO JACOB)
dialog: Grab the other bucket, will you?
text: Diamond Joe seems uneasy about this as we follow August and
text: Jacob, who comments on the putrid meat.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: August, this stuff has gone off. Do
dialog: the cats really eat this?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: No, they really love goats.
dialog: (Jacob looks to him)
dialog: We're all out of goats.
scene_heading: EXT. CAT CAR - MOMENTS LATER - LIBERTY, NY - TWILIGHT
text: Jacob waits with the buckets outside the car. August is
text: inside unlocking the padlocks, then reappears and jumps out.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Go ahead. They get a bucket each.
text: Apprehensive, Jacob hops up. August hands him the buckets.
scene_heading: INT. CAT CAR - CONTINUOUS - TWILIGHT
text: The cat dens have two compartments: to the left is a pair of
text: lions. To the right, a tiger and a panther. All are massive.
text: As soon as Jacob appears, they lift their heads ominously.
text: August has unlocked the dens but left the padlock hanging on
text: the cage bars. The animals can smell the buckets now. They
text: growl. Jacob is a bit unhinged:
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What do I do, just open the door
dialog: and toss it in?
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Unless you think a formal sit-down
dialog: is appropriate.
text: Jacob approaches the tiger first. The six hundred pound cat
text: rises then roars, his massive head hitting the cage and
text: rattling the lose padlock. Jacob freezes.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: Why don't you start with Rex...
text: that's him on the left.
text: August is pointing to one of the lions - with a ratty mane
text: and visible rib cage. Smaller than the tiger, Jacob has a bit
text: more nerve. He reaches for a bucket...August suddenly shouts,
dialog: unnerving Jacob even more:
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: WAIT!
speaker_heading: (JACOB JUMPS)
dialog: Not that one, that one.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 35.
text: He points to a difference bucket. Jacob can see no difference
text: between them, but no matter. He lifts the bucket and
text: approaches the lion's cage. Rex, the lion, lunges at the den
text: door. Jacob freezes.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: What's the matter? Didn't they
dialog: cover this in school?
text: August is having a grand time. Jacob smirks. Rex is rubbing
text: his mangy coat against the cage bars.
text: Jacob fumbles, removing the padlock and laying it at his
text: feet. He lifts the bucket and waits. When Rex turns away from
text: the cage door, Jacob swings it open. But before he can spill
text: out the contents of the bucket:
text: Rex turns and chomps his huge jaw down on Jacob's arm. JACOB
text: SCREAMS. The bucket drops, spilling the entrails inside which
text: cause Rex to release Jacob's arm and attack the food.
text: Jacob slams the cage shut and checks to see if he has an arm.
text: He does but it is dripping with saliva and as red as if he'd
text: dipped it in boiling water. But no skin is broken.
text: August is hysterically laughing. Furious, Jacob storms off;
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What the hell is wrong with you?
dialog: You think that's funny?
speaker_heading: AUGUST
speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: Yes I do! Aw Jacob wait! Don't be
dialog: sore! I was having a little fun!
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: FUN! I could have lost my arm!
speaker_heading: AUGUST
speaker_heading: (LAUGHS)
dialog: Rex hasn't got any teeth...
text: Jacob feels more foolish and walks away, when, just as
text: quickly, August's tone of voice turns darker:
speaker_heading: AUGUST (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Jacob..
text: Jacob stops and turns. August isn't laughing any more. He has
text: that sniper's stare of August's darker side...August moves
text: towards Jacob, almost menacingly, as he speaks;
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: ..people want their money back when
dialog: the Star Act on the poster isn't in
dialog: the ring! A Star Attraction keeps a
dialog: circus alive. Without it, animals
dialog: eat that and men eat nothing. It
dialog: takes time to find and train
dialog: another horse so without Silver
dialog: Star, I have no Star Act.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I don't know how he's been
dialog: performing August, but you don't
dialog: have a Star Act now. That horse
dialog: can't walk and if he does you'll
dialog: lose him. He's in a lot of pain.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Like this?
text: August squeezes Jacob's sore arm from Rex's attack. Jacob
text: cries out in pain as August holds his grip yet speaks calmly;
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: We always have choices, Jacob - a
dialog: choice between our pain and someone
dialog: else's. That horse was performing
dialog: before you came and he will
text: continue to perform until he drops
dialog: dead. I'm telling you to keep it
dialog: alive and that's what you'll do or
dialog: you'll be red lit like anyone else
dialog: who doesn't obey the law here.
dialog: Every nation has it's own laws
dialog: under God, Jacob. You left America
dialog: the second you jumped my train. I
dialog: like you. Believe me, I do. I'm
dialog: only thinking of your future.
text: August lets go of his arm and walks away. Jacob is angry.
scene_heading: INT. RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - TWILIGHT
text: Angry, Jacob inspects his arm - swollen and red from Rex's
text: mouth. He hears: O.S. murmuring coming from Silver Star's
text: stall. He approaches to find Marlena sitting at Silver Star's
text: head, stroking his nose and humming the lullaby.
text: Marlena strokes Silver Star as Jacob appears. And Marlena
text: speaks to him for the first time;
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: Tell me the truth. What's wrong
dialog: with him?
text: Jacob hesitates before answering, then:
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: The connective tissues between the
text: hoof and the coffin bone are
dialog: compromised and the coffin bone
text: rotates toward the sole of the
dialog: hoof. If he keeps walking, it'll
dialog: puncture through...He's in a lot of
dialog: pain.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: And if he rests?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You'll lose him anyway. I'm sorry.
text: Marlena breaths in this bad news and braces herself, tears
text: welling up in her eyes.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: Then you have to put him down.
text: Jacob is impressed by her...and a little surprised.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: It's the right thing to do.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: But August won't let you.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (Beat. Then:)
dialog: If I'm the show's vet then it's my
dialog: decision, isn't it?
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: But August won't like it.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Then it'll be my last decision.
text: Marlena is impressed by Jacob. And surprised. She doesn't
dialog: quite know what to make of him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 38.
scene_heading: EXT. STOCK CAR - LIBERTY, NY - MOMENTS LATER - TWILIGHT
text: A determined, pent-up Jacob marches towards Bill and Grady
text: who are taking a break, smoking. Camel is drinking Jake...
speaker_heading: CAMEL
dialog: Hey kid. What are you doing on the
dialog: wrong side of the tracks?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I need a gun.
speaker_heading: CAMEL
dialog: It can't be that bad...
text: They laugh but Jacob insists boldly.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I need a gun! Or a rifle! Now!
text: Grady leans inside the open car door and gets him a rifle.
text: Jacob takes it and marches back. They watch him, curiously.
text: Jacob passes Blackie on the way and boldly ignores his
text: intimidating stance....Performers and workmen sense a drama
text: brewing and follow Jacob to see what is happening.
scene_heading: INT. RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - TWILIGHT
text: Jacob jumps into the Ring Stock car with the rifle as Kinko
text: exits his room with Queenie. Queenie growls.
speaker_heading: KINKO
dialog: What do you think you're doing?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Shut-up! Both of you!
text: Jacob continues on to Silver Star and Marlena.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: You should go.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: No. I'll keep him calm.
text: Jacob respects Marlena's fortitude...Jacob raises the rifle
text: and aims, trembling...Stoic Marlena, tears in her eyes, turns
text: her face away...Jacob pauses, upset...then...shoots.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 39.
text: Jacob's distraught expression tells us everything as the
text: rifle slides to his side. He looks to Marlena. This is their
text: first moment of intimacy. She rises and takes the rifle from
text: his grip. She sees his arm bruised from the cats. She seems
text: to know what it means. She offers a respectful farewell.
speaker_heading: MARLENA (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll be sorry to see you go, Mr.
dialog: Jankowski.
text: She exits O.S. with the rifle.
scene_heading: INT. MENAGERIE TENT - LIBERTY, NY - LATER - EVENING.
text: The yaks are motionless. Flies buzz around their head and
text: ears. Jacob swats them away...The Polar Bear is on his
text: stomach, breathing heavily. Jacob smooths his coat....Jacob
text: leans down and hoists a bucket of ice, scattering the ice
text: near the polar bear who rolls closer to it.
text: Jacob sees Rex, lying on his side in his cage, panting with
text: thirst. He brings a bucket of water to Rex's cage and opens
text: it. Rex gets to his feet but this time Jacob doesn't flinch.
text: He isn't frightened. He gives Rex the bucket of water. Rex
text: drinks as Jacob strokes his mane, which Rex allows...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Friends now?
text: August calmly enters the menagerie with the rifle. He walks
text: to the center and stops, staring at Jacob.
text: Jacob goes about caring for the animals - moving from one to
text: the next - trying not to be unnerved by August's presence.
text: Then August does a surprising thing: He sits in the center of
text: the menagerie, crossed legged, with the rifle beside him.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: You've got a gift for them. Like
dialog: Marlena with horses. It's God-
dialog: given. I can always spot it.
text: Jacob takes Bobo out of his den. Bobo hugs him tightly. He
text: continues on as he replies;
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: My father used to say that to me.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: He must have been a wise man.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 40.
text: This stops Jacob. Beat. He turns to August.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: How is Marlena?
text: August tilts his head curiously, with a smile.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: You're a genuine curiosity Jacob
dialog: Jankowski. What am I to do with
dialog: you? ... I threaten to throw you
dialog: off a moving train, feed you to my
dialog: lions and you go ahead and shoot my
dialog: star horse anyway. So I think -
dialog: Jacob's an educated man. For Jacob
dialog: to disobey me and shoot that horse,
dialog: that horse must have been in pretty
dialog: bad shape. Perhaps bad enough to
dialog: injure my Marlena during the show.
dialog: And so I think Jacob Jankowski
dialog: might be a valuable person to have
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Tell Diamond Joe the animals need
dialog: more water when the humidity's this
dialog: bad if I don't see him before I go.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: You're not going anywhere. You
dialog: belong here. These animals..they've
dialog: been waiting for you.
text: Jacob doesn't know whether to believe him or not. Then:
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: But don't ever disobey me like that
dialog: again. I'll give you this one. I'll
dialog: call it "respect"...Next one I call
dialog: "betrayal". Understood?
speaker_heading: (JACOB NODS)
dialog: I do thank you though. You and
dialog: Silver Star solved a much bigger
dialog: problem for me.
text: August pulls a pack of Camels from his pocket.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What problem?
text: August lights, inhales, blows smoke then:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: The cats. You see, meat eaters are
dialog: always more valuable to a circus
dialog: than hay burners. And you saw what
dialog: we had to feed them.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What does Silver Star have to do
dialog: with the cats?
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: We should have just enough food for
dialog: them to get us to the next show,
dialog: thanks to you. Of course Marlena
dialog: won't speak to me for a day or two
dialog: but she'll come around...So, I was
dialog: right. You are a valuable man.
text: As he walks away, rifle over his arm, Jacob is unnerved;
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: August, what did you do? August?
scene_heading: INT. KINKO'S ROOM - EN ROUTE TO GOSHEN - MORNING
text: Queenie sleeps. Kinko reads comic book porn inside a book of
text: Aristotle's Poetics. Jacob sits on his bed thinking.
speaker_heading: JACOB (V.O.)
dialog: I couldn't stop thinking about
dialog: Marlena. I didn't see her for three
dialog: days. Our shows were cancelled and
dialog: we kept moving because, word was,
dialog: August found a "dead one"...
text: The train wheels screech as it begins to stop. Jacob rises
text: and looks out of open train car doors..
scene_heading: EXT. FOX BROS CIRCUS GROUNDS - GOSHEN, NY - MORNING
text: The train is pulling into the site of a "ghost town"
text: abandoned circus; a dilapidated Big Top, broken wagons and
text: tents, desolate performers walking about idly or sitting in
dialog: the shade.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. RING STOCK CAR - GOSHEN, NY - MORNING
text: As the train pulls into Goshen, performers stick their heads
text: out the window to see....Jacob sits in the open stock car
dialog: with Kinko and Queenie:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Why are we stopping?
speaker_heading: KINKO
dialog: August loves his sideshow freaks.
dialog: There's a guy with this outfit who
text: has a parasitic twin growing out of
text: his chest. He dresses it in a tiny
text: tuxedo and black patent leather
dialog: shoes. No talent but a real money-
text: maker with the rubes. Calls himself
dialog: the Man and a Half. Goddamn
dialog: August'll pay him double what he
dialog: pays me just for the irony.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What happened to this circus?
speaker_heading: KINKO
dialog: Went belly up. Pretty common
dialog: nowadays. Circus bosses see the end
dialog: coming and they'd pull a runner
dialog: with all the money. Menagerie
dialog: belongs to the town now. August can
dialog: get anything he wants for a song.
text: Jacob and Kinko watch August striding through the grounds as
text: desperate performers hopeful for work rush up to him.
speaker_heading: KINKO (CONT'D)
dialog: Most of them will never belong to
dialog: another show. And they know it.
text: August is helped by Earl, who pushes the performers aside so
text: August can head straight for the Goshen TOWN OFFICIALS,
text: standing beside an Oldsmobile. They exchange greetings.
scene_heading: EXT. FOX BROS CIRCUS GROUNDS - GOSHEN, NY - LATE MORNING
dialog: Crazy Joe is organizing the Flying Squadron to take whatever
text: parts of the Fox Circus remains that they can use.
text: Jacob is checking baggage stock horses when he sees:
text: Marlena sitting alone outside her stateroom. He walks to her.
text: Just as he reaches her, Marlena turns to him, looking as if
text: she hadn't slept in days. Before they can speak, they hear:
speaker_heading: EARL
text: MARLENA! JACOB! AUGUST WANTS YOU!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 43.
scene_heading: EXT. FOX BROS CIRCUS GROUNDS - GOSHEN NY - NIGHT
text: A CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE IS POPPED OPEN...
text: A deliriously happy August is walking and holding the
text: champagne, pouring glasses held by Earl who then hands one
text: each to Marlena, Jacob, Diamond Joe and Crazy Joe as they all
text: walk towards the Fox Bros. Menagerie Tent.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: We have a new star!
speaker_heading: DIAMOND JOE
dialog: The Man and a Half?
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Nah, lousy Ringling got here first.
dialog: But we got better! A bull!
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: A bull?
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: A bull elephant! Her name is Rosie,
dialog: she's fifty-three and she's
dialog: brilliant. The best bull they had.
dialog: I'm going to come up with a whole
dialog: new Star Act around her and
dialog: Marlena..
speaker_heading: (TO MARLENA)
dialog: You can ride her in the Spec from
dialog: now on, since we have no Liberty
dialog: Horse.
text: August smiles at Marlena who looks back contemptuously, upset
text: about Silver Star. August ignores her. Jacob notices the
dialog: exchange between them.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: (Pours himself a glass.)
dialog: ...Our own bull! Ringling can't
dialog: hold that over us now. I'm
text: renovating an entire car just for
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: CRAZY JOE
dialog: Just for the elephant! But the
dialog: bunkers are at capacity! I've got
text: roustabouts three to a bunk.
text: August tosses off this concern.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: We'll find places for everyone. And
dialog: when our new star sells tickets,
dialog: we'll buy another car! We're a show
dialog: to be reckoned with now!
speaker_heading: (TOASTS)

text: SPECTACULAR SHOW ON EARTH!
scene_heading: INT. FOX BROS. MENAGERIE TENT - GOSHEN NY - NIGHT
dialog: CAMERA POV: Dozens of Benzini Brothers work men are
dialog: dismantling and taking what they need...As our characters
text: walk through, this crowd of working men in constant motion
dialog: part the way to reveal:
text: ROSIE THE ELEPHANT: She is gargantuan. Ten feet tall at the
text: shoulder. Her skin is mottled and cracked from the tip of her
text: trunk down to her feet. Only her ears are smooth. She has
text: deeply set, amber eyes with extremely long lashes. She stands
text: tall behind a rope, chained to a stake in the ground.
text: Jacob, Marlena, August, Diamond Joe and Greg observe her.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: She has such long eye lashes.
speaker_heading: DIAMOND JOE
dialog: She's a hundred if she's a day.
dialog: We're lucky if she can move.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Darling, what do you think? She's
dialog: magnificent, isn't she?
text: Marlena keeps her rage silent, but it is all the more potent.
text: August decides to ignore it. Jacob keeps his eyes on Rosie
text: but feels the tension between them.
text: ROSIE'S CARETAKER approaches: filthy shirt behind suspenders.
speaker_heading: ROSIE'S CARETAKER
dialog: You the bull man?
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: No.
dialog: (Refers to Diamond Joe)
dialog: This is my menagerie man.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: ROSIE'S CARETAKER
dialog: Where's your bull man? Ya got no
dialog: bull man, I gotta tell the township
dialog: or else they can't sell her to ya.
text: August grabs Jacob's arm and shoves him forward;
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Here he is. He's my bull man..
text: Rosie's Caretaker looks at the surprised Jacob, then:
speaker_heading: ROSIE'S CARETAKER
dialog: All right. See this animal...this
dialog: here's the stupidest Goddamn animal
dialog: on the face of God's good
dialog: earth....Here's your bull hook.
dialog: You're gonna need it.
text: He tosses A BULL HOOK - a wooden rod about three feet long
text: with a four inch metal pick coming off the end - to Jacob.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: I don't believe it. The mayor said
dialog: she was the best bull you had.
speaker_heading: ROSIE'S CARETAKER
dialog: If she was the best bull, why is
dialog: she the only one left? You think
dialog: you're the first show to turn up
dialog: picking on the bones?
text: August is annoyed. As the Caretaker gathers his things:
speaker_heading: ROSIE'S CARETAKER (CONT'D)
dialog: Some elephant tramp who dropped
dialog: dead in Genesee sold her for a song
dialog: which still ain't no bargain cause
dialog: she ain't done a damn thing since
dialog: but eat everything in sight.
dialog: (Starts to walk away)
dialog: Well, good luck to ya. And if I
dialog: don't ever see another dumb bull in
dialog: my life it'll be too soon.
speaker_heading: (SPITS)
text: Rosie pulls her trunk from the trough. She lifts, aims, and
text: blasts the Caretaker with such a force, his hat sails off his
text: head in a stream of water.
text: Jacob, August, Diamond Joe and Greg bite their lips from
text: laughing. Marlena just stares into Rosie's eyes.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 46.
text: The Caretaker stops, his hair and clothes dripping. He
text: doesn't turn, just stands still for a moment - then moves on.
text: August's enthusiasm is slightly dampened.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Joe, you and Greg come with me. We
dialog: have to find a car to renovate.
speaker_heading: (TO JACOB)
dialog: See what you can do with her.
text: They exit. Jacob and Marlena are left alone with Rosie as
text: Flying Squadron men continue to work in the tent. There is an
text: awkward pause between them...then:
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Mrs. Rosenbluth, I hope I'm not
dialog: speaking out of turn here but - but
dialog: I had no idea they were going to do
dialog: that to Silver Star.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: I know....Thank you.
text: This relaxes Jacob, but he senses she is still sad.
speaker_heading: MARLENA (CONT'D)
dialog: And please, call me Marlena. I'm
dialog: not a snob like everybody thinks.
text: Jacob smiles. He faces Rosie and tries to cheer Marlena up.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Hello Rosie, I'm Jacob Jankowski.
dialog: This is Mrs. Marlena Rosenbluth.
dialog: Can you say Mrs. Marlena
dialog: Rosenbluth?
text: Marlena smiles as she watches Jacob stroke Rosie's hide.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: You're a beauty, huh. Skin's a
dialog: little dry, you oughta take care of
dialog: that. First thing you notice about
text: a woman's age is her skin.
text: Rosie lifts her trunk and begins to explore Jacob's body.
text: Marlena giggles. Jacob plays it up to make her laugh.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you flirting with me young
dialog: lady? I usually like to make the
dialog: first move...
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: (Her trunk taps his head)
dialog: I like to get to know a girl
dialog: first...take her out. Meet her
dialog: folks...
dialog: (Her trunk goes lower)
dialog: Of course, aggressive women can be
dialog: a nice change...
dialog: (She tickles him)
text: Jacob and Marlena laugh, her mood lightened because of Jacob.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: I think you two are engaged.
text: They laugh. Jacob is thrilled to have this effect on Marlena.
text: A HARMONICA PLAYS A TUNE in the distance. They turn towards
text: the sound and see that the two of them are alone in the tent.
text: All the workmen have left.
text: Jacob and Marlena turn back to Rosie who stands between them.
text: There is a awkward, lovely moment of intimacy between the
text: three as Marlena strokes Rosie's trunk. Her hand and Jacob's
text: come very close to overlapping. When their eyes meet, one of
text: them quickly averts their glance...There is clearly a growing
text: attraction between them. But it's uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: MARLENA (CONT'D)
dialog: I think Rosie likes music. That
dialog: harmonica song is lovely.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'm confessin that I love you.
text: Marlena stops, her face flushed by Jacob's "confession".
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: The name of the song. "I'm
dialog: Confessin' That I Love You."
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: (overlaps, realizing)
dialog: --"Confessin' that I love you."
text: Beat. Jacob tries not to laugh. They return to stroking
text: Rosie, trying not to look at each other.

scene_heading: INT. KINKO'S ROOM - GOSHEN, NY - LATE AFTERNOON.
text: Jacob enters. Kinko is on his bed reading his "Aristotle" but
text: quickly shuts the book. Queenie growls at Jacob.
speaker_heading: KINKO
dialog: Queenie stop.
text: Queenie stops. Kinko returns to his book. Jacob sees a NEW

scene_heading: "MR. &amp; MRS. AUGUST ROSENBLUTH REQUEST THE PLEASURE OF YOUR

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: KINKO
dialog: It's trouble, that's what. Not that

dialog: with dynamite with those two and
dialog: you're gonna blow all of us up.
dialog: August is the meanest sonofabitch
dialog: I've ever met.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I admit he has his moments of

dialog: generous, charming guy.
speaker_heading: KINKO
dialog: You don't get it, do you? When

dialog: that's the real August. The one
dialog: who's generous and charming -
dialog: that's the insane August.
text: They hear a fight outside the car. They move to investigate:
scene_heading: INT/EXT. RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - LATE AFTERNOON.
text: Jacob and Kinko look out of the open ring stock car to see:
text: August is standing before A MAN who is being held by
text: Blackie's Men and punched by Blackie himself. The Man is
text: bleeding and bruised. Various other performers and working
dialog: men also watch the brutality;
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: KINKO
dialog: Six men got red lit last night.
dialog: Cancelling shows and that damn
dialog: elephant cost August. He needed to
dialog: clean house to save on payroll...
dialog: It's a lousy day when an animal
dialog: gets paid and men don't.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Why are they beating him?
speaker_heading: KINKO
dialog: He hid one of the men who was
dialog: supposed to be tossed. Word was the
text: train was over a trestle instead of
dialog: land. Nobody comes back from that.
speaker_heading: THEY HEAR:
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Get rid of him. He comes back on my
dialog: property, you can shoot him.
text: August walks away, with Earl and his men in tow. Blackie and
text: his men drag the beaten Man away. As they turn, Jacob
dialog: recognizes the Man;
text: It is WADE who worked Jacob on his first day.
scene_heading: INT. MARLENA AND AUGUST STATEROOM - GOSHEN, NY - NIGHT
text: August, wearing a tuxedo, opens the door on the platform.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: JACOB! Come in, come in!
text: Jacob enters their Stateroom which takes up half the car,
text: with an additional room, cordoned off by a velvet curtain.
text: The main room is paneled in walnut and outfitted with damask
text: furniture, a dinette and a Pullman kitchen.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: Darling, our guest has arrived.
text: Jacob's eyes go wide upon seeing Marlena who appears looking
text: radiant in a rose silk, off the shoulder evening dress.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: I'm so glad you could come. Would
dialog: you like a beer? Or champagne?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'm not dressed for champagne.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: We can fix that, can't we darling?
text: August winks at Marlena who giggles at their secret as August
text: ushers Jacob to the velvet curtain...
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: We're celebrating our new star,
dialog: Rosie. My plan is to have the act
dialog: ready for the Manhattan/Jersey show
dialog: so she can start selling tickets.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Unfortunately we had to let some
dialog: men go last night...
text: Jacob listens to how August will explain this:
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: ...I don't like doing it, not one
dialog: bit. But to keep hard working men
dialog: working, I had to get rid of lay-
dialog: abouts and thieves who are dead
dialog: weight. If I had the funds to pay
dialog: them all I would, but times being
dialog: as they are...I regret it though.
text: Jacob believes him. August turns to him, with cheer:
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: So tomorrow, my faithful bull man,
dialog: we begin! But tonight - we dine!!
dialog: Tonight, we all deserve champagne!
text: August whisks the velvet curtain aside:
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: Ta-dah!
text: A tuxedo for Jacob, who smiles, impressed.
text: MONTAGE: A PERIOD SONG COVERS THE IMAGES TAKING US OVER THE
text: COURSE OF THE EVENING ALONG WITH JACOB'S NARRATION:
text: - Three white-gloved waiters remove the domes off of silver
text: platters revealing oyster bisque, prime rib, boiled potatoes,
dialog: asparagus in cream.
text: - Marlena's dress barely covers her shoulders, exposing her
text: porcelain skin and the curves of her breasts. Jacob can
text: barely keep his eyes off of her during dinner...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 51.
text: - Jacob is wiping his plate clean as August proudly offers
text: more. Marlena laughs at Jacob's embarrassment when he
text: realizes his plate is clean...
text: - Wine is poured over and over...as the evening continues.
text: - August is at the center of conversation entertaining
text: Marlena and Jacob. They are drunk from the wine!
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: Jacob, I want to apologize to you,
dialog: in front of my darling Marlena so
dialog: she can witness how truly sorry I
dialog: am for any bit of nastiness between
dialog: us...Running this show, the many
dialog: pressures...It can get the best of
dialog: me sometimes I'm afraid.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: People don't realize how much
dialog: August does holding everything
dialog: together. How difficult it is in
dialog: these times. The whole company is
text: like a family to him.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Thank you my love.
text: He kisses her hand then turns to Jacob;
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: From now on I shall trust your
dialog: judgement in all things
dialog: veterinarian. Please say you accept
dialog: my apology.
text: Jacob is enamoured with August again, especially seeing
text: Marlena smiling in agreement.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Of course I do, August. You've been
dialog: nothing but swell to me.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Good man!
speaker_heading: (SINCERE)
dialog: I could truly use a friend I can
dialog: trust.
text: Jacob once again beams at the compliment as August pours more
text: wine. But Jacob feels a twinge of guilt. He stands to make a
text: dramatic statement. August and Marlena look up to him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I have to tell you something. You
dialog: may not trust me after you hear it.
text: August and Marlena pause - giving Jacob their attention.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: I never took my final exams at
dialog: Cornell. I'm not a real vet.
text: Beat. Then August and Marlena burst into laughter at the dire
text: earnestness with which Jacob made his statement.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: But it's true. I never got my
dialog: degree. I'm not a licensed vet.
text: They laugh even harder.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: BAH! A worthless piece of paper
dialog: from the ivy bush league! Of course
dialog: you're a vet. You have the gift.
dialog: You're idealism is just so...sweet.
dialog: When are you going to learn that
dialog: the rules written of, by and for
dialog: these united states of suckers do
dialog: not apply to us.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Not about this, August.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: All right, let me ask you - do you
dialog: honestly think this is the most
dialog: spectacular show on earth?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (Beat. Then laughs)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: No. It's nowhere near. Lucinda, our
dialog: Fat Lady, isn't 800 pounds. Four at
dialog: the tops. And you really think the
text: Tattooed Man got tattooed by
dialog: headhunters in Borneo? He's from
dialog: Pittsburgh. Took him nine years to
dialog: ink himself. And you know what I
dialog: did when the hippo died? Swapped
dialog: out her water for formaldehyde and
dialog: kept showing her. For two weeks, we
text: travelled with a pickled hippo..
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: (Jacob &amp; Marlena laugh)
dialog: ..The world is run on tricks - in
dialog: here and out there. So trust me,
dialog: it's having a talent that counts.
dialog: In this world, it's all that's
dialog: real. Look at this country, these
dialog: dead, God awful towns we play.
dialog: Talent and illusion bringing life
dialog: to what is dead...Even for just a
dialog: matinee. How wonderful is that?
text: Jacob believes he's right. Marlena smiles in agreement.
text: August rises to toast. Jacob and Marlena follow.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: To talent and illusion!
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: To Rosie!
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: And Silver Star.
text: August takes a beat and smiles warmly at Marlena...
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: To all we love.
text: He leans over and kisses Marlena longer than appropriate in
text: front of a guest. Jacob downs his wine, closing his eyes.
text: Suddenly, August grabs Jacob and Marlena and pulls them up to
text: dance, throwing his arm around them both as we hear: Louis
text: Armstrong's DREAM A LITTLE DREAM OF ME.
text: August starts singing along, imitating Satchmo's voice,
dialog: encouraging Jacob to join in...August is a great performer,
text: filling up the space with his impersonation. Jacob can only
dialog: laugh along.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on Jacob! It's customary to
dialog: sing for your supper!
text: Jacob joins in to perform with August. Marlena applauds them.
text: August breaks away to dance with Marlena as Jacob sings. They
text: begin to slow dance, very intimately.
text: Jacob gives up singing and plops himself on an upholstered
text: chair, drinking more champagne. Jacob watches them dance:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: JACOB (V.O.)
dialog: He looked like a different man when
dialog: he looked at her. I said to myself,
dialog: maybe love does that to a man. I
dialog: didn't know much about it.
text: Suddenly, August kisses Marlena - a bit too aggressively.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: Darling. Darling, please..
speaker_heading: (GIGGLES)
dialog: Gently. We have a guest.
text: August stares at her. His expression darkens - locking his
text: eyes on Marlena and tilting his head as if he is examining
text: her. Marlena smiles and strokes his face. August doesn't
text: respond. He remains intense...
speaker_heading: MARLENA (CONT'D)
dialog: Darling, what is it?
text: August takes her face by the chin and tilts it with complete
text: control, as if searching for proof of something he can't
text: trust. His grip tightens, hurting her.
text: Alerted, Jacob sits up, prepared to intervene...But Marlena
text: shows no sign of fear. She knows exactly what to do.
speaker_heading: MARLENA (CONT'D)
dialog: August, dear...
text: She manages to moves his hand to her mouth and kisses it.
speaker_heading: MARLENA (CONT'D)
dialog: You don't know your own strength,
dialog: my love.
text: And then, just as quickly, August's expression softens,
text: relaxes, almost into sadness...as if he's about to
text: cry....Marlena senses it immediately. She whispers lovingly.
speaker_heading: MARLENA (CONT'D)
dialog: Auggie?
text: August stops and eyes the bed beyond them. He leaves Marlena
text: and throws himself face first on the bed.
speaker_heading: MARLENA (CONT'D)
dialog: Excuse me, Jacob.
text: Jacob watches as Marlena attends to August, lifting his legs
text: onto the bed, taking off his shoes. August begins snoring.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 55.
text: Marlena smooths the hair out of his face then closes the
text: curtains and returns to Jacob in the main room.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Is everything all right?
text: Marlena puts a finger to lip and keeps it there, as she
text: returns to her Victrola and selects another record. She
text: cranks it on and plays it low. A RUTH ETTING SONG.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: Oh yes. He's just had too much to
dialog: drink, that's all. I hope you had a
dialog: good time tonight. I wanted so much
dialog: to make things up to you.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Tonight was your idea?
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: Oh Auggie wanted it too, he felt
dialog: horrible about what happened. He
dialog: really does like you Jacob. But
dialog: it's hard for him. He's under a lot
dialog: of pressure. He does more than
dialog: people realize holding things
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You said that.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: Well it's true...
text: (Opens her arms to him.)
dialog: One dance before you go?
text: Jacob cautiously approaches. Marlena takes his hands but when
text: Jacob presses closely against her and places his hand against
text: her bare back, he almost swoons. They slow dance. Both tipsy.
speaker_heading: MARLENA (CONT'D)
dialog: Jankowski is Polish isn't it?
speaker_heading: JACOB
speaker_heading: (NODS)
dialog: Is that all right?
speaker_heading: MARLENA
speaker_heading: (LAUGHS)
dialog: Yes, of course, sorry...I just
dialog: think it's interesting. I don't
dialog: know what I am, besides August's
dialog: wife....I grew up in foster homes
dialog: since I was a baby.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: MARLENA (CONT'D)
dialog: Kentucky, Oklahoma, Kansas,
dialog: Texas...I must have covered a dozen
dialog: states by the time I was 17. I'd
dialog: make up stories about who my
dialog: parents were...
speaker_heading: (LAUGHS)
dialog: When I was five, I pretended for a
dialog: whole year my mother was an
dialog: Appaloosa mare...
text: They both laugh.
speaker_heading: MARLENA (CONT'D)
dialog: I did! ... and I pretended that I
dialog: was really an Appaloosa filly...and
dialog: that I was just dreaming I was a
dialog: girl and one day, I'd wake up...and
dialog: I'd run home.
speaker_heading: (LAUGHS)
dialog: Anyway, I was a lot safer inside
dialog: those stables than I ever was
dialog: inside those homes...
text: Marlena stops, not wanting to continue. Jacob finds a new
dialog: route for her conversation.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What happened at 17?
speaker_heading: MARLENA
text: There was a parade for the circus.
text: At the head, there were six black
text: Fresians, 17 hands high wearing red
dialog: tassles. So proud! So beautiful.
dialog: And August was leading them. The
dialog: second he looked at me, the way he
dialog: looked at me, I knew I'd never live
dialog: with strangers again. And the way
dialog: he talked. Told me "I'd find a home
dialog: in every city..welcomed in every
dialog: town...and he'd give me--
speaker_heading: JACOB/MARLENA
dialog: -- a life most suckers can't dream
dialog: of"!
speaker_heading: MARLENA
speaker_heading: (LAUGHS)
dialog: Ha, you too, huh?
speaker_heading: (JACOB NODS)
dialog: It's a wonderful lie, isn't it?
speaker_heading: (JACOB NODS)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: MARLENA (CONT'D)
dialog: But he said he'd make me a Star
dialog: Attraction and he did. I'm pretty
dialog: lucky he found me.
text: Jacob, lost in her eyes and her voice, blurts out:
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: He was pretty lucky to find you.
text: Marlena is surprised by the compliment...and endeared.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: You're sweet to say so.
text: Beat. Feeling exposed, Jacob searches to change the subject:
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Pretty song.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: Don't tell him what happened...
text: Jacob takes this as an intimate moment between them.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Oh no Marlena, I won't ever tell.
text: Marlena smiles, laughs, using Jacob's joke back on him;
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: That's the name of the song. "Don't
dialog: Tell Him What Happened To Me". Ruth
dialog: Etting. She's one of my favorites.
text: Jacob's head starts spinning. Marlena takes care of him;
speaker_heading: MARLENA (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you much of a wine drinker?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I have no idea.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: Maybe you should go to bed.
speaker_heading: JACOB
speaker_heading: (NODS)
dialog: Where's that?
text: Marlena laughs. Jacob's bow tie is undone - she ties it;
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: Here, let me...We can't let you go
text: out there all untied. A circus is a
dialog: small town. What will people say?
text: As Marlena ties his tie, Jacob's eyes simply rest on
text: Marlena's face - sinking deeper in love. When Marlena
text: finishes, she looks up to Jacob...She can tell Jacob is
text: enamoured. She smiles warmly, touching his cheek...
speaker_heading: MARLENA (CONT'D)
dialog: Sweet, sweet Jacob...
speaker_heading: JACOB
speaker_heading: (SENSITIVE ISSUE)
dialog: I'm not that sweet.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: (Lowers her hand)
dialog: Good night.
text: Marlena turns and disappears behind the velvet curtain. Jacob
text: stands still for a moment, then exits.
scene_heading: EXT. RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - GOSHEN, NY - NIGHT
text: A drunk Jacob sees the ring stock car door open, filled with
text: people's legs hanging out and loud voices from within.
scene_heading: INT. RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - GOSHEN, NY - NIGHT
text: Jacob hops up into the car. Kinko is giving a party, with a
text: bottle in his hand and drunken hospitality on his face.
text: Thirty performers cram the area usually occupied by Marlena's
text: horses, including BARBARA and another Coochie girl, NELL.
text: Kinko and Queenie are performing tricks. Jacob watches. He
text: admires the talent and humor of Kinko and Queenie's act. At
text: the end, the girls laugh and applaud. Jacob joins in:
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: BRAVA QUEENIE! BRAVA!
text: But the sound of Jacob's voice immediately makes Queenie stop
text: and growl at him. Jacob stops.
text: Kinko, Barbara and the Coochie girls stop laughing and stare
text: the drunken young man, with his shirt out of his pants. He is
dialog: ripe for the picking! They get an idea!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: KINKO
dialog: JACOB MY FRIEND!! Folks, this is my
dialog: friend and roommate Jacob. I'd like
dialog: you all to make him feel at home!
text: Kinko starts laughing uncontrollably and before Jacob can
text: protest or escape, Barbara and Nell approach him, moving in
text: for the kill. Blurry-eyed, Jacob staggers back but the others
text: refuse to let him leave. In fact, he is picked up bodily,
text: raised above their heads and transported to Silver Star's
text: empty stall as Barbara and Nell disrobe him.
text: IN BLACK OUT....WE HEAR A SCRAPING NOISE THEN SEE A SLIVER OF
text: LIGHT AS A LID IS OPENED.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN CAR/CLOWN ALLEY CAR - EN ROUTE - MORNING
text: Kinko opens the lid of a trunk, speaking to someone inside;
speaker_heading: JACOB (O.S.)
dialog: Where am I?
text: Kinko moves about a car filled with racks of costumes, props
text: and an open trunk containing the hidden Jacob.
speaker_heading: KINKO
dialog: Where are you right now or where
dialog: are you in an Aristotelean context
dialog: because right now you're in a
dialog: trunk.
text: Inside the trunk, O.S. Jacob lifts his arm to Camera and
text: discovers he is dressed in a red silk dressing gown...
speaker_heading: JACOB (O.S.)
dialog: Where are my clothes? I'm not
dialog: wearing anything underneath this---
speaker_heading: (THEN:)
dialog: OH MY GOD...SOMEBODY SHAVED MY...
speaker_heading: KINKO
dialog: Huh-huh.
text: As Jacob struggles out of the trunk, we only see his arms.
speaker_heading: JACOB (O.S.)
dialog: What the hell did I do last night?
speaker_heading: KINKO
dialog: You threw up on Barbara...And maybe
dialog: Nell.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: JACOB (V.O.)
dialog: I feel sick.
speaker_heading: KINKO
dialog: You look a little pale.
text: Kinko holds the mirror to Jacob. We see for the first time:
text: JACOB'S FACE HAS BEEN PAINTED AS A CLOWN.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN CARS - CONTINUOUS - MORNING
text: Jacob races through each car - past musicians, clowns and the
text: Coochie Girls - clutching his robe, rubbing the make-up off.
text: Along the way, the circus company taunt and tease him with
text: sexy hoots and hollers. Kinko follows him, delighted.
scene_heading: INT. KINKO'S ROOM - TUXEDO PARK, NY - MORNING
text: Having cleaned up, Jacob is dressing in his own clothes.
text: Kinko sits on his cot "reading Shakespeare" with a melancholy
text: Queenie at his side. When Jacob scratches his shaven balls...
speaker_heading: KINKO
dialog: Your balls itchy?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: YES THANK YOU!
text: Pissed off, Jacob continues to dress.
speaker_heading: KINKO
dialog: It'll grow back. Aw come on, you
dialog: still store about last night? Now I
dialog: figure we're even. In fact, I
dialog: probably owe you one. Feel free to
dialog: borrow a book.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Let's just drop it.
text: Kinko opens a book to read. Jacob notices Queenie's quiet.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: What's wrong with Queenie?
speaker_heading: KINKO
dialog: What do you mean "wrong"?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I mean she's not hating me.
dialog: Something's wrong.
speaker_heading: KINKO
dialog: (Concerned, pets her)
dialog: Yeah, she's been like this all day.
dialog: I don't know...she must have eaten
dialog: something. She did her business and
dialog: it was kind of...watery.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Her stool? Did you look at it for
dialog: parasites?
speaker_heading: KINKO
speaker_heading: (SHAKES HEAD)
dialog: I don't like looking at my own.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Get some honey from the cookhouse.
dialog: And if you can find any slippery
dialog: elm powder. But the honey should do
dialog: it. If not, we'll check her for
dialog: parasites.
text: Jacob starts to exit. As Kinko reads his book;
speaker_heading: KINKO
dialog: Jacob?
speaker_heading: (JACOB STOPS)
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Sure Kinko.
text: He moves to exit again. Kinko never looks up from book;
speaker_heading: KINKO
dialog: Jacob?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: KINKO
dialog: My real name's Walter.
text: They never look at each other but a friendship is formed.
text: Jacob exits.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 62.
scene_heading: EXT. RING STOCK CAR - CIRCUS GROUNDS - MORNING
text: When Jacob hops out, he sees performers and roustabouts all
text: gathered by a performer train car, huddling and discussing.
text: He crosses to investigate, meeting up with August Diamond Joe
dialog: and Mr. Erwin...
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: We got big trouble. Lucinda died.
dialog: Now we've got no center ring star
dialog: act and no sideshow star...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: How did she die?
speaker_heading: MR. ERWIN
dialog: I don't know where we're gonna find
dialog: a fat lady this late in the season.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: I don't care where you find one,
dialog: but find one.
dialog: (To Diamond Joe)
dialog: Better get some kind of rig set up
text: to lift her out of the car. How did
dialog: you carry Silver Star out?
speaker_heading: DIAMOND JOE
dialog: In pieces.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Oh yes...
dialog: (considers for a second)
dialog: Mmmm...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: August!
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: No, no, of course, don't be silly!
dialog: Right. Well, figure something else
dialog: out Joe but get it down for the
dialog: performance. Put her in the hippo
dialog: tank for now.
speaker_heading: (TO JACOB)
dialog: You better start on that elephant.
dialog: We need her performing yesterday.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 63.
scene_heading: EXT. ROSIE'S TRAIN CAR - MORNING
text: Out of the darkness of her car, the enormous elephant
text: emerges, being led down a ramp by Jacob.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAINING RING - TUXEDO PARK, NY - LATE MORNING
text: Jacob - cleaned, dressed and hung over - sits crossed legged
text: in front of Rosie. The two stare at each other. Rosie's nose
text: searching the ground for something to eat. Jacob, without
text: energy or focus, his head pounding, orders her;
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Rosie...Up.
text: Rosie just looks at him without moving.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Up. Rosie. Up.
text: Rosie's trunk starts to sniff around Jacob.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Rosie....Walk!...STEP!..Rosie STEP!
text: Rosie's trunk investigates Jacob's body, tapping his head.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Rosie please. My hair hurts.
text: Rosie's trunk snakes around him.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: No...No more Cracker Jack until you
dialog: do something....Rosie!...
text: Rosie curls her trunk around Jacob and slowly topples him
text: sideways, turning him over as he weakly threatens;
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm getting really mad now....I
dialog: mean it...Rosie stop...
text: Rosie gets the Cracker Jack from his back pocket...
speaker_heading: AUGUST (V.O.)
dialog: You just can't get enough of
dialog: somebody in your pants, can you?
text: Jacob quickly gets up as August strides towards him;
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (V.O. (CONT'D)
dialog: Heard you had a rough night?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Does everybody know what happened?
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Can somebody tell me?
text: August suppresses a laugh.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: I'm opening the midway and the
dialog: menagerie this afternoon for some
dialog: extra cash before the show tomorrow
dialog: night. We'll see how she does with
dialog: the crowd. She got any skills?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Finding food? But I don't really
dialog: know how to do this.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Well, first of all, you can't do
dialog: anything with a bull without the
dialog: bull hook.
text: August takes the BULL HOOK from the ground.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: It's the only way to train them.
dialog: Watch.
text: Jacob steps back.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: UP!..UP!...COME ON UP!
text: August stabs Rosie behind the shoulder..Jacob winces. Rosie
text: lifts her foot a little.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
text: HIGHER UP...UP!
text: August keeps jabbing her with the hook...dotting her flesh
text: with blood. Jacob gets upset.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: August, there's got to be another
dialog: way.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: We don't have the time! She has to
dialog: start earning her keep MOVE! UP!
dialog: UP!!
text: August stabs her other shoulder...harder...continuing to
text: shout. Rosie is getting agitated...pulling away from him but
text: constrained by her chain. Her eyes fearful.
text: Other performers rehearsing in the area begin to watch as
text: August strikes Rosie harder and harder. She begins to bleed.
text: Jacob tries to stop August by going for the bull hook...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Please, August, let me try again.
text: But August angrily pulls it away and turns on Jacob:
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Don't tell me my business! You
dialog: don't want to watch this, get the
dialog: hell out! Making love to it ain't
dialog: going to work. Besides, from what I
dialog: hear, you're not that good at it.
speaker_heading: (TO ROSIE)
dialog: GET UP! UP!!!
text: Jacob watches, upset and furious at August's treatment.
scene_heading: INT. MENAGERIE TENT - TUXEDO PARK, NY - LATER THAT DAY
text: Rosie's flesh is dotted with wounds from August's bull hook.
text: Jacob is applying zinc ointment to them.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'm so sorry girl. Just a few more
dialog: here. Hold still.
text: The un-staked canvas flaps behind Rosie wave up with the
text: breeze....Rosie's trunk rises. She smells something from
text: outside the tent.
text: When Jacob bends down for more ointment, Rosie tries to turn
text: around but her chain is still staked into the ground. As
text: Jacob straightens up, he sees:
text: Rosie's trunk carefully wrap itself around the stake and pull
text: it up out of the ground....She then manages to turn herself
text: around, her butt to Jacob. Rosie's trunk then dives down and
text: up under the canvas flaps.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Rosie?
scene_heading: EXT. MENAGERIE TENT/MIDWAY - TUXEDO PARK - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: A VAT OF LEMONADE LEFT ON THE CONCESSION STAND, which is in
text: the process of being dismantled. Work men are carrying items
text: back to the train.
text: WE SEE: Rosie's trunk come out from under the canvas, her
text: body hidden, searching for the lemonade.
text: Jacob peers out to see: Rosie's trunk dip itself into the vat
text: of lemonade and drink the entire contents.
text: Jacob is amazed. He looks around: Workmen are some distance
text: away loading the train. No one else sees her.
text: Rosie finishes then turns back into the menagerie.
scene_heading: INT. MENAGERIE TENT - TUXEDO PARK, NY - CONTINUOUS - DAY.
text: Rosie's trunk gathers up the stake and then stakes it back
text: into the ground. Jacob can't believe his eyes. He laughs.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN - EN ROUTE T0 NEW JERSEY - DAY
text: As the train travels to Weekhawken, New Jersey...Jacob is
text: looking out of open car to NYC skyline across the river.
speaker_heading: JACOB (V.O.)
dialog: We were on our way to the
dialog: Manhattan/ Jersey show and Mr.
dialog: Erwin still hadn't found a fat
dialog: lady. Tickets sales were low. So
dialog: August, ha,ha...August pulled a hat
dialog: trick.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET PARADE - WEEHAWKEN, N.J. - DAY
text: August is sitting atop Rosie, smiling, waving his top hat,
text: then forlornly placing it against his chest and lowering his
text: head in respect for Lucinda. Manhattan is in the distance.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: JACOB (V.O.)
dialog: A parade like you never saw, a
dialog: funeral and a celebration, saying
text: goodbye to one star, introducing a
dialog: new one...playing those rubes dying
dialog: to get a peek like he was rolling a
text: coin over his finger tips...
text: Rosie leads a small parade of clowns, including Walter and a
text: perky, healthy Queenie down the main street. Marlena sits
text: atop a Percheron, in full costume. Jacob walks astride.
text: Lucinda's Wagon, carrying "the dead Lucinda", follows.
speaker_heading: JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: It wasn't really Lucinda in there.
text: It was Barbara in a fat suit and
dialog: wig inside the hippo den. We buried
dialog: the real Lucinda by the railroad
dialog: tracks between towns. Cemeteries
dialog: cost too much. We were the only
dialog: family she knew.
text: People line up to cheer and offer their silent respects...and
text: satisfy a ghoulish fascination at the "dead" fat lady.
speaker_heading: JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: August sure was right about Rosie.
dialog: She pulled the people right in.
dialog: Rosie played that crowd like a pro.
text: The rubes love the exotic Rosie...kids run up to pet her with
dialog: their parents.
text: As Rosie passes, we see AN OLD WOMAN standing in front of her
text: green shuttered house waving with delight. We see she has a
text: abundant vegetable garden which Rosie eyes covertly.
scene_heading: EXT. BIG TOP - SPEC LINE UP - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - DAY
text: WE HEAR: The Band playing from inside the Big Top as the
text: performers and ring stock are lined up for the Grand Spec.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: But as soon as the Spec started, we
dialog: all knew it was too soon for
dialog: Rosie's debut.
text: Rosie heads the line. Marlena sits atop her, in her sequins
text: and headdress, grabbing onto Rosie's leather halter.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 68.
text: August stands beside with the bull hook. His face is cold and
text: still. His fingers clutch and release the bull hook.
text: The SPEC MUSIC begins and everyone makes last minute
dialog: adjustments...Kinko and Queenie included....August shouts
text: into Rosie's ear.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
speaker_heading: MOVE! MOVE!
text: Rosie hesitates so August strikes her right shoulder with the
text: bull hook. The pain sends Rosie flying through the Big Top
text: flap, causing Marlena to adeptly flatten her back atop Rosie
text: so as not to hit her head on the pole that runs across the
dialog: Big Top flap.
text: Others gasp at the near accident. August is already furious.
text: Jacob senses danger ahead. He follows in, curling the edge of
text: the sidewall so as not to impede the Spec performers.
scene_heading: INT. BIG TOP - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Jacob watches as Rosie makes it twenty feet down the
text: hippodrome track then stops.
text: Without missing a beat, Marlena yanks herself upright, beams
text: a smile and thrusts her hands in the air, her back arched,
text: her toes pointed - as if it were all a part of the act.
text: The crowd goes wild - clapping, throwing peanuts, whistling.
text: Rosie only moves in fits and starts, causing the rest of the
text: Spec to pass them by at times. She trots ahead of August and
text: then when August reaches her she stops, making August halt
text: awkwardly. August feels humiliated until:
text: The crowd laughs, thinking it's the act. They applaud.
text: August realizes the crowd loves it. So August, the performer,
text: starts to play the infuriated fool to the audience, acting
text: comically angry and frustrated with Rosie..
text: But when he turns back to Rosie, he is red-faced with real
text: anger, poking under her shoulders with the bull hook.
text: After three stops and starts, August plunges the bull hook
text: sharply into her shoulder blade...and Rosie takes off at a
text: faster speed, curling her trunk in the air. The crowd cheers!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 69.
text: Marlena grasps Rosie's halter as they fast approach the
text: dangerous pole above the entrance. If Marlena doesn't bail,
text: she'll be knocked off by the pole.
text: Jacob, August, the Spec and the audience watch enthralled as
text: Rosie charges toward the entrance...when suddenly:
text: Marlena lets go of the halter and leans hard to the left.
text: Just as Rosie bolts out of the Big Top, Marlena grabs hold of
text: the pole above the entrance and is left hanging there as
text: Rosie exits the Big Top...
text: For a moment, the audience doesn't know if this is part of
text: the act. Jacob wants to run to help her...
text: But Marlena quickly decides what to do; She lets go of the
text: pole with her left hand and quickly swings around so she is
text: facing the audience, still hanging from the pole.
text: Her face lights up and she points to her toes. The Band
text: Leader takes this as a signal and conducts the band into a
text: drum roll. The crowd relaxes and applauds.
text: Marlena begins swinging, gaining momentum as the band roll
text: mounts. Soon, in one final burst of performance inspiration,
text: she releases herself from the pole, sails through the air
text: tucking her body into a ball, rolling twice, uncurling for
text: one sideways rotation and lands firmly in the sawdust in her
text: feet. She straightens up and thrusts her arms in the air.
text: The crowd goes wild. The Band plays victory music. Coins are
text: thrown from the bleachers. Even the Spec performers cheer.
text: August acknowledges the audience's response by bowing as if
dialog: it were all his creation.
text: But after a moment, Jacob can see Marlena is in pain as she
text: turns and subtly limps out of the Big Top. He follows her.
scene_heading: EXT. BIG TOP - WEEHAWKEN NJ - DAY
text: Jacob rushes to her. Marlena, in pain, collapses in his arms.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: Oh Jacob...
text: August rushes out and is stopped cold by the sight of
text: Marlena in Jacob's arms. He immediately tenses up.
speaker_heading: JACOB
text: August, she's hurt.
text: August takes her in his arms. Barbara appears to help.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: I'm here, darling, I've got you.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Bring her to my tent, it's closer.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Jacob, send Joe for ice. You go and
dialog: find that Goddamn bull before we're
dialog: run out town. And take the hook!
text: August is seething, his expression cold, as he carries
text: Marlena O.S. Jacob, concerned, takes the hook and runs O.S.
scene_heading: EXT. OLD WOMAN'S GREEN SHUTTERED HOUSE - WEEHAWKEN - DAY
text: Rosie is standing in a vegetable garden calmly feeding
text: herself cabbages. The owner is the OLD WOMAN who was
text: delighted by Rosie in the parade. She is now screaming
text: hitting her with a small garden shovel...Jacob runs up.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'm sorry ma'am. I'll get her.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: You better before she gets at my --
text: AAHHH, MY TOMATOES! YOU MONSTER!!
text: Rosie has helped herself to tomatoes. Jacob steps in.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Rosie, no! Stop!
text: Rosie pauses for a moment, flapping her ears at Jacob, then
text: shoves a bush of tomatoes in her mouth. Jacob almost laughs.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Bad elephant, that's not nice. This
dialog: kind lady hasn't invited you.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: ARE YOU CRAZY TALKING TO AN
text: ELEPHANT!? SHOOT IT! BEFORE IT EATS
dialog: MY HOUSE! I'M CALLING THE POLICE!
text: She exits into the house as Rosie wraps her trunk around
text: cabbages, uprooting them, as Jacob tries to battle her trunk.
text: Greg arrives with a bucket he places in front of Rosie. Her
text: trunk stops fighting Jacob and sniffs inside the bucket.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What's in the bucket?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Gin and ginger ale. Elephants love
dialog: booze. One whiff of this and she's
dialog: not thinking about cabbages no
dialog: more.
dialog: (Bats her trunk away)
dialog: ... moj malutki paczuszek?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Greg, right? Are you Polish?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Grabowski.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Jankowski.
text: Greg again pushes Rosie's trunk away from the bucket.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Last show I worked, one bull faked
dialog: a belly ache just to get the
dialog: whiskey...Better grab the hook.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Are you a bull man? August would
dialog: hire you in a minute.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Don't want the job. Not for him.
dialog: Besides, I'm not bull man. I just
dialog: like big beasts.
text: Jacob gets it and follows Greg who carries the bucket.
speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)
dialog: Is she following?
text: Jacob turns around to see and sure enough:
text: Rosie is leaving the garden and trotting behind to catch up
text: to the bucket of gin and ginger ale. Jacob's impressed.
scene_heading: EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - TWILIGHT
text: The show is still in progress - we can hear the band playing
text: for the aerialist act in the background.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 72.
text: As Jacob makes his way to Marlena's stateroom he crosses
text: paths with August, whose face is "dark as thunder".
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: How's Marlena?
speaker_heading: AUGUST
text: A little shaky. Sore wrists.
dialog: Bruised heel. Doc says she'll be
dialog: fine. Did you catch the bull?
speaker_heading: JACOB
text: She's in the menagerie.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Good.
text: August takes the bull hook from Jacob and walks with cold
text: blooded intent towards the menagerie. Jacob panics, realizing
text: what August about to do. Jacob follows to stop him;
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: August! Wait! She was good! She
dialog: came back on her own! Besides, you
dialog: can't do anything now! The show is
text: still going on.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
speaker_heading: (WALKING)
dialog: Good. The band will drown it out.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: AUGUST, NO!
text: Jacob touches August's arm. August turns on Jacob with a
text: murderous expression, shoving him to the ground. Jacob is
text: about to get up to fight but August cautions him with the
text: bull hook to stay down. August smiles slightly. Would he
dialog: really use that bull hook on Jacob or is he kidding? Jacob
text: stays down. August continues on, entering the menagerie tent.
speaker_heading: MARLENA (O.S.)
dialog: Jacob!
text: Jacob sees Marlena running towards him.
scene_heading: EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS - WEEHAWKEN - TWILIGHT
text: Jacob and Marlena run across the grounds to the menagerie as
text: workmen are running out of the menagerie tent, hearing August
text: screaming from inside. They enter the menagerie tent to see:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 73.
scene_heading: INT. MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - WEEHAWKEN - TWILIGHT
text: August is beating Rosie, who cries out with each blow. The
text: animals are panicking from inside their cages - the lions
text: roaring, the monkey's squealing. Marlena freezes at the
text: entrance as Jacob runs to August.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: AUGUST...STOP!!!
text: August turns to see her. Enraged, he stops Jacob with:
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Get her out of here! NOW!
text: Jacob wants to help Rosie but can not disobey August in this
text: moment. He returns to Marlena and ushers her out, as August
text: continues to beat Rosie.
scene_heading: EXT. MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - WEEHAWKEN - TWILIGHT
text: Marlena and Jacob step away, hearing Rosie cry out. Marlena
text: can't bear it. She grabs Jacob's hand for support. Jacob
text: tentatively holds onto her waist, guiding her away. She leans
text: into him. Jacob loves being this close to her.
text: The screams of August O.S. pull their attention to see:
text: Earl and his men physically dragging a maniacal August out of
text: the tent, his bull hook and clothes bloodied by his rage. He
text: is kicking and struggling against them like a madman.
text: Jacob is shocked by August's behavior. But Marlena has seen
text: it before. She pulls away from Jacob and exits O.S. alone.
scene_heading: INT. MENAGERIE TENT - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Rosie is lying on her side, her foot still chained to the
text: stake. She is quivering, riddled with bloodied holes.
text: Jacob is kneeling, applying zinc ointment, not knowing where
text: he can touch that won't hurt her. He is heart broken.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Rosie, what am I going to do with
dialog: you?
text: Rosie's eyes look up to him, her lashes blinking. Her trunk
text: lifts and wipes at her own eye.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 74.
text: Greg appears with a bucket and several bottles of whiskey. He
text: begins pouring whiskey bottles into a bucket.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Here this will help. Poor beast. He
dialog: really hurt her. Told you about
dialog: him.
dialog: (Curses August in POLISH)
dialog: Don't understand why a man like
dialog: that wants to be around animals in
dialog: the first place. He shouldn't have
dialog: the right, if you ask me.
text: Listening to Greg, Jacob gets increasingly angry. He sees the
text: bull hook. He grabs it and marches out of the menagerie.
scene_heading: EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - NIGHT
text: Earl's men are smoking, when one sees Jacob marching angrily
text: towards August's stateroom, carrying the bull hook. Alerted;
speaker_heading: EARL'S MAN
dialog: Somebody better find Earl.
scene_heading: INT. MARLENA AND AUGUST STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
text: Jacob reaches the platform to find the door ajar. He moves
text: through it. The stateroom is in a shambles. An open suitcase
text: of women's clothes lies strewn across the floor.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (O.S.)
dialog: Marlena...!
text: August appears from behind the curtain ; he looks
text: uncharacteristically distraught...teary eyed and unkempt.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you know where Marlena is? Did
dialog: she send you?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No....What happened?
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: She won't speak to me...
text: He can't finish. He sits, burying his head in his hands.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: ...She won't let me apologize...
dialog: She won't forgive me.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 75.
text: Jacob is astounded by August's sad, pitiable state.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't know what happens to me,
dialog: Jacob. When I saw that bull running
dialog: wild with Marlena, I...I lost my
dialog: mind. But it's because I love her.
dialog: Why can't she understand that?
dialog: (Jacob stands coldly)
dialog: Isn't there anyone who understands?
dialog: (Jacob remains silent)
dialog: Ah, it's all my fault, I know it
dialog: is. I've spent too much money on
dialog: that bull. I can't pay the workmen.
dialog: Our debts are piling. We're losing
dialog: attendance at every show. I have no
dialog: Star Attraction. I don't know
dialog: what's going to happen to us if
dialog: Rosie doesn't sell tickets.
speaker_heading: (CONFESSES)
dialog: If I lose this circus, I'll lose
dialog: Marlena - I know it.
text: Jacob softens, seeing August in this helpless, humble light.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'm sure that's not true.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Maybe you can talk to her. She's
dialog: tired of my apologies but, this
dialog: pressure I'm under...Of course,
dialog: that's no excuse for what I did...
dialog: (Rubs the images away)
dialog: ...I can't believe what I did. Is
dialog: she all right? The bull. Rosie.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: She'll be OK.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Would you tell Marlena? And tell
dialog: her...tell her I'll do anything.
dialog: Anything she wants.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: August, I can't...
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: I'm sure she'll forgive you...She
dialog: loves you...Anyone can see that.
text: August wants to believe him. He seems more hopeful.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Thank you. My friend.
text: Jacob nods, confused, his anger diffused. As he exits;
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: Jacob?
text: Jacob stops and turns back as August asks:
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: What were you planning to do with
dialog: that bull hook?
text: Jacob realizes he's holding the bull hook. August smiles.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: Ha. You look like me.
text: Jacob looks in the mirror and indeed - with Rosie's blood on
text: his open shirt, bull hook in hand - he looks like a violent
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe there is someone who
dialog: understands me.
text: August smiles. But Jacob is unnerved by the smile...and the
text: comparison. Suddenly, Earl enters and looks around, on alert;
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Everything's fine, Earl.
text: August nods to Jacob, who pushes past Earl to exit.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN - CONTINUOUS - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - NIGHT
text: Jacob jumps down off the platform. Confused and disgusted, he
text: takes the bull hook, wedges it under the train and breaks it
dialog: in half.
scene_heading: INT. MENAGERIE TENT - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
text: Jacob enters to find Greg still treating Rosie.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: How's she doing?
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Oh she's a strong one, this one.
speaker_heading: (TO ROSIE)
dialog: Jestes dobra dziewczynka
text: Jacob watches as Rosie lifts her foot and Greg rubs ointment.
text: Jacob sees the many empty whiskey bottles.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Is she drunk?
speaker_heading: GREG
speaker_heading: (LAUGHS)
dialog: She's four tons..she'll just sleep
dialog: good.
dialog: (Screwing ointment top)
dialog: Potoz noge.
text: Jacob watches as Rosie puts her foot back on the ground.
speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)
dialog: Masz, moja piekna
text: Jacob watches as Greg digs in his pocket and pulls out a
text: mint, brushing off the lint. Rosie's trunk investigates, then
text: nimbly plucks it out of his hand and into her mouth.
text: SUDDENLY, JACOB HAS AN EPIPHANY.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Oh my God...
scene_heading: EXT. MIDWAY - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: An excited Jacob is leading August to the menagerie tent.
scene_heading: INT. MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
text: Jacob leads August to Rosie. A curious Greg stops tending to
text: Rosie. Jacob hands August a slip of paper with Polish words.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Just read those out loud. To Rosie.
text: August reads the words in Polish with Jacob's help...
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Rosie...da--da---
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Daj.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Daj...daj..no-ge.
text: Rosie does nothing. August looks to Jacob. Jacob is worried.
text: Greg suggests, in a low whisper;
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Might help if he said please.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Say...Prosze Rosie daj noge.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Pros--Prozze Rosie...daj noge.
text: Rosie lifts her foot. August's eyes gleam.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Go on.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: (Reads and recites)
dialog: Rosie...potoz noge.
text: Rosie puts her foot down. August starts to understand.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: (Reads and recites)
dialog: Do tylu, Rosie! Do tylu!
text: Rosie sighs, shifts her weight, then takes a couple of steps
text: backward. August is amazed. Jacob is thrilled.
speaker_heading: JACOB (V.O.)
dialog: That Fox Bros bull man didn't tell
dialog: us was the elephant tramp who sold
dialog: Rosie to them was Polish...
text: August grabs Jacob and kisses him on the mouth.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: We've got a new star!
text: Greg remains cautious.
scene_heading: PRE-LAP : LIVE JAZZ BAND MUSIC.
scene_heading: INT. NEW YORK CITY SPEAKEASY - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: The live band plays on a raised platform. The dance floor is
dialog: jammed with couples.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 79.
text: Tables and U-shaped booths surround the dance floor. Tuxedoed
text: bartenders serve from a wooden bar lined with hundreds of
text: bottles in front of a smoky mirror.
text: August, Jacob and Marlena sit in a booth. They are drunk on
text: their third bottle of champagne. Marlena is wearing a
text: beautiful, low cut beaded red gown. Jacob can barely keep his
text: eyes off of her.
dialog: Marlena is particularly drunk - we've never seen her this
text: wild or spontaneous. She sings along with the band...she
text: keeps rhythm by banging her hands on the table.
text: However, she is acting distant to August.
text: August is happy she is having a good time. When he slides
text: next to her and puts his arm around her, Marlena stiffens;
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Would you like to dance, darling?
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: No, thank you.
text: Awkward beat. Marlena takes her champagne glass and drinks
text: the last of it. August tries to make light of it.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: We need more champagne.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'll get it.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: No, you stay with Marlena.
text: August kisses her cheek, but Marlena is clearly still upset.
text: August lets her be. He exits O.S.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You ever going to let him off the
dialog: hook?
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: Hook? That's an unfortunate choice
dialog: of words.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Rosie's going be great. He won't
dialog: hurt her again. I know it.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: Jacob, what you know about August
dialog: is pretty much nothing.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 80.
text: Jacob feels put down. Marlena realizes that came out too
text: brusquely. She softens, and explains with vulnerability;
speaker_heading: MARLENA (CONT'D)
dialog: You know how many star acts we've
dialog: had? How much money we've made and
dialog: lost and made...? Silver Star paid
dialog: for our new stateroom and look what
dialog: happened to him. Everything August
dialog: touches gets fed to the cats one
dialog: way or another.
speaker_heading: (SADLY)
dialog: He'll never change.
text: Jacob is moved. Marlena shifts gears and rises.
speaker_heading: MARLENA (CONT'D)
dialog: I want to dance.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Maybe you should wait for August.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: I want to dance now!
text: She pulls him up onto the dance floor. Marlena dances light
text: as air. She spins from Jacob then returns to his arms, so
text: that her back is to him. Jacob's forearm is on her collarbone
text: - skin to skin. Her chest rises and falls under his arm. Her
text: hair under his chin, Jacob can smell her fragrance - then she
text: unwinds away from, like a ribbon.
text: When the music stops, everyone applauds their dance -
text: including Marlena. Jacob beams. He looks up to the bar:
text: August stands stock still. His eyes glaring at Jacob. The
text: dark expression we've come to know. Seething with quiet rage.
text: Jacob takes a step back from Marlena when suddenly they hear;
speaker_heading: OFF CAMERA SHOUT
text: RAID!! RAAAAID!!! EVERYBODY OUT!!!
text: PANDEMONIUM: Jacob is swept by a crush of bodies. People
text: scream, shoving their way towards the exit. Marlena is shoved
text: along with them, a few heads in front of Jacob.
text: Jacob reaches through the sea of flesh and grabs a hand. By
text: Marlena's expression, we know he has grasped her hand. Jacob
text: scans the panicked crowd for August but all he sees are

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I wonder if August got out...

speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: ...I don't know how we're going to

speaker_heading: MARLENA

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What...what about August?
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: I don't know where he is, do you?
dialog: And he doesn't know where we are.
dialog: It's not our fault. Like you said,
dialog: who knows how long it'll take us to
dialog: get back.
text: Jacob is hesitant. Marlena takes his hand and softly pleads;
speaker_heading: MARLENA (CONT'D)
dialog: Just a few hours, Jacob. For just a

dialog: anywhere...we don't belong to
dialog: anyone...Please.

speaker_heading: MARLENA

speaker_heading: JACOB
speaker_heading: (HOPEFUL)

speaker_heading: MARLENA

speaker_heading: JACOB

speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: It's all right. No one can hear.
dialog: We'll never get another chance to

text: Marlena looks into Jacob's eyes and finally addresses what
dialog: they're both thinking;
speaker_heading: MARLENA (CONT'D)
dialog: Nothing can ever happen with us,
dialog: you know. It's too dangerous.
dialog: August will never let me go. You
dialog: don't know what he's capable of.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: How can you be with a man you're
dialog: frightened of?
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: I'm not. I don't have to feel
dialog: afraid of him if I don't feel
dialog: anything...After all these years,
dialog: I've learned how to do it so well.
dialog: I tell myself, "I'm managing. I can
dialog: manage him. August loves me. Nobody
dialog: else ever did. Who am I to say it's
dialog: the wrong kind of love?" .. See,
dialog: there's no place for a woman like

speaker_heading: MARLENA

speaker_heading: (TO CAMEL)

scene_heading: EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - MOMENTS LATER - WEEHAWKEN - DAWN

speaker_heading: MARLENA

speaker_heading: (EATING)

dialog: "It wasn't me".
text: August turns back to the crowd to apologize and once again,

dialog: Thank you, August.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: It's from both of us.
text: Jacob looks to Marlena. It is awkward between them. They
text: can't kiss each other. Jacob nods and says courteously;
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Thank you, Marlena.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: You're welcome, Jacob.
text: As Marlena exits with the others, we discover August watching
dialog: from them a distance;
text: August's expression tells us he knows what they are hiding.
scene_heading: EXT. BIG TOP - SALEM, NJ - DAY.
text: Marlena and Rosie exits the Big Top. We hear tumultuous
text: applause coming from inside. Jacob awaits them, as usual.
text: Jacob commands Rosie, who lifts Marlena off his back and
text: places her carefully on the ground. Jacob pets and commands
text: Rosie to follow him, but stops when:
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: I wonder if you could help me.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
speaker_heading: (PROFESSIONAL TONE)
dialog: I've planned a surprise for August.
dialog: He's been so wonderful, don't you
dialog: think?
speaker_heading: (JACOB NODS)
dialog: Could you make sure Rosie is staked
dialog: in my tent after the show?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No problem.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: Thank you so much...Oh, and I'm
dialog: sure it would be nice for August if
dialog: you were there too.
text: Marlena turns and exits O.S. Jacob isn't sure what to think.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 98.
scene_heading: INT. MARLENA'S DRESSING TENT - SALEM, NJ - NIGHT
text: Rosie is staked into the grass inside Marlena's tent, happily
text: occupied with a pile of watermelons.
text: Marlena wears a silk beaded dress with the diamond necklace.
text: There is a serving table with silver domed platters and wine
text: bottles. Marlena is trying to open a champagne bottle when
text: Jacob enters.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: Oh, he'll be here any second.
dialog: Jacob, can you open this for me?
text: Jacob takes the champagne bottle and manipulates the cork.
text: Rosie's trunk is curious, inspecting the bottle in Jacob's
text: hand. Jacob laughs. Marlena sees and laughs as well.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Rosie...get away....ssstop!!
text: Rosie continues fooling around, causing Marlena and Jacob to
text: laugh even harder when the cork pops...
speaker_heading: AUGUST (O.S.)
dialog: What is this?
text: Jacob and Marlena turn to see August enter, laying down his
text: hat and coat, his shirt unbuttoned at the top.
speaker_heading: MARLENA/JACOB
dialog: OH!....SURPRISE!..SURPRISE!
text: Jacob pours the champagne into two flutes, which Marlena
text: rushes up to August, handing him a glass and kissing him.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Did you show Jacob the opening
dialog: night present I gave you?
text: Marlena turns to Jacob and indicates the diamond necklace.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: (indicating the necklace)
dialog: Oh. No...Do you see Jacob?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Beautiful.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: It looks stunning on you.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 99.
text: They kiss again. Marlena raises her glass of champagne.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: To August - an authentic miracle
dialog: man because he made a star
dialog: attraction out of me.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: To August!
text: August nods in gratitude. They tilt their glasses and drink.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Many thanks. Forgive me for
text: arriving too soon and spoiling the
dialog: surprise.
text: August takes out a cigarette and lights it.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: Don't be silly. I couldn't wait for
dialog: you to come.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: I could go back out to give you
dialog: more time...or better yet, yell
dialog: RAID and clear the place out so you
dialog: two can be alone.
text: In a split second, Jacob and Marlena know the danger present.
dialog: August gave no sign of it coming.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: I'm sorry. I'm probably wrong. I
dialog: assumed that night after the RAID
dialog: was the first time you two fucked,
dialog: but obviously it's been going on
dialog: longer than that.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: Auggie, you're being silly.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Did you think I didn't know?
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: August don't do this!
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Shut-up. SHUT UP!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 100.
text: Marlena gets frightened. August saunters over to the silver
text: tipped cane leaning against the flap. He picks it up as
text: Marlena and Jacob remain still. Suddenly they hear:
text: Rosie peeing where she is staked. She too is frightened.
speaker_heading: AUGUST (CONT'D)
dialog: How long did you think you could
dialog: keep this from me?
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: August, please, there's nothing-
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: GO ON! INTERRUPT ME ONE MORE TIME!
text: August swipes the tables with the cane, knocking all the
text: platters and glasses to the floor.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: We should go!
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: WE!...So you two are a couple?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: NO! I just don't think you're safe
dialog: to be around a woman right now.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: A woman? This is not a woman. This
dialog: is my wife you Ivy League lying
dialog: piece of shit! Say, I bet the
dialog: authorities would like to know you
dialog: practise without a license.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: Auggie, please... Don't you see how
dialog: much I love you?
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: I see you. I see you too clearly.
dialog: Always have. I have to admit that
dialog: was a nice touch when you got back
dialog: from the speakeasy. Being with me
dialog: in our bed, after being with him.
dialog: Covering your tracks. I should have
dialog: known a whore only performs for a
dialog: man like that when she wants
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Marlena, come with me...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: YOU DON'T EVEN DENY IT! LOUSY
dialog: TRAMP!!
text: Marlena drops the fluted glasses, crying:
speaker_heading: MARLENA
scene_heading: STOP IT!..AUGGIE STOP IT..PLEASE!
text: Suddenly, he's quiet. He stands still. Marlena approaches him
text: now, cautiously but tenderly.
speaker_heading: MARLENA (CONT'D)
dialog: Auggie? Are you all right now?...
text: August looks at her. Marlena's expression is one of care and
text: concern. Jacob watches carefully. Has it passed?
text: Suddenly, August flicks his lit cigarette into Rosie's open
text: mouth - Rosie reacts and Jacob moves to help her - as August
text: grabs Marlena, shoving her so hard she falls against the
text: table, knocking it and her to the ground. He attacks her,
text: trying to rip off her diamond necklace.
text: Jacob attacks August, pulling him off of Marlena.
text: JACOB AND AUGUST FIGHT: savagely pounding each other's faces,
text: crashing against broken plates and spilled gravy, banging
text: their heads viciously against the ground, rolling over each
text: other as they alternately share domination...
text: Marlena screams for them to stop. Rosie bellows, pulling on
text: her leg chain.
text: The FIGHT SPILLS OUT OF THE TENT INTO THE CIRCUS GROUNDS.
scene_heading: EXT. MARLENA'S DRESSING TENT - CONTINUOUS - SALEM, NJ - NIGHT
text: Jacob and August continue beating each other as they roll out
text: into the crowd.
text: August's madness empowers him. He manages to overpower Jacob
text: in a choke hold. Jacob is losing consciousness.
text: Because of Marlena's screams - Earl and his men run to the
text: tent. Within seconds, they are pulling August off of Jacob.
text: August gets to his feet. His cool expression is even more
text: frightening as he re-enters Marlena's tent.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: LET ME GO!! HE'LL KILL HER!!!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 102.
text: From inside the tent, they hear a crash. Marlena screams.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: HE'S HURTING HER!!LET ME GO!
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: No he won't, kid. Come on.
text: Earl disperses the crowd that has gathered, which includes
text: Walter, who sees Jacob's bloodied face and goes to him.
text: FROM INSIDE THE TENT, THEY HEAR: Two soft thuds..then a
text: louder one...Then an unnerving silence.
speaker_heading: EARL (CONT'D)
dialog: See, it's over. Can we let you go?
text: Jacob pants and nods. Earl and one of his men let Jacob go in
text: degrees, until he is standing up. Walter holds his waist.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Come on Jacob. Walk away.
text: With Walter's help, he tears his eyes from the billowing flap
text: and walks away, passing rubes who watch with fascination.
scene_heading: INT. KINKO'S ROOM - SALEM, NJ - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Walter uncorks a jug of moonshine and hands it to Jacob, who
text: holds a towel to his bloody, beaten face. Jacob drinks from
text: the jug, panting, until the pain subsides. Camel speaks from
text: behind the trunks.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: The only thing that's keeping you
dialog: alive right now are the rubes who
dialog: saw everything. August can't risk
dialog: getting rid of you here. But you
dialog: better not get back on this train
dialog: when we leave tomorrow night.
speaker_heading: CAMEL (O.S.)
dialog: What happened? Somebody turn me
dialog: around. Share some of that jug!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Shut-up Camel.
speaker_heading: CAMEL (O.S.)
dialog: Well, what the hell...!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 103.
text: Camel uses whatever strength his has to push aside the trunk
dialog: and see bloody Jacob.
speaker_heading: CAMEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus Christ! Who did that to you?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: August.
speaker_heading: (TO JACOB)
dialog: Is it true?
text: Jacob wants to deny it but his silence speaks the truth. He
text: can only manage to shake his head NO...But Walter can read
text: between the lines....He lowers his head in despair.
text: THE TRAIN STARTS TO MOVE. All three react with surprise.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Why are we moving? We have a
dialog: matinee tomorrow.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Something's gone wrong.
text: SUDDENLY, A KNOCK ON THE DOOR. The three men immediately are
text: on alert. Walter grabs his knife from beneath his pillow.
text: Camel tries to shove himself behind the trunks. THE KNOCK
text: COMES AGAIN as we hear:
speaker_heading: MARLENA (V.O.)
dialog: Jacob? Jacob, it's Marlena.
text: They breath a sigh. Jacob opens the door to reveal.
text: Marlena with a black eye. Jacob rises to her.
speaker_heading: MARLENA (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry. I had nowhere to go. I
dialog: told him I'm leaving him.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: My God. Are you all right?
speaker_heading: MARLENA
text: Looks worse than it feels.
dialog: (Re: Jacob's face, laughs)
dialog: Ha, look at the two of us.
text: Marlena awkwardly enters the room to Walter and Camel's
text: stares. She sees the moonshine and breaks the ice.
speaker_heading: MARLENA (CONT'D)
dialog: Can I have a swig of that?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 104.
text: Walter throws her the moonshine. Marlena drinks like a pro.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Why is the train moving?
text: Marlena sits with the jug, casually talking:
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: We're being run out. Apparently,
dialog: August was so optimistic about
dialog: money coming in for Rosie, he
dialog: figured he'd double down and find
dialog: himself a new fat lady to put him
dialog: really toe to toe with
dialog: Ringling...So he sent Mr. Erwin
dialog: into town who finds this rather
text: large woman in a restaurant and
dialog: offers her the job. Except, she...
speaker_heading: (STARTS LAUGHING)
dialog: ...she was the police chief's wife.
dialog: Mr. Erwin got a left hook in the
dialog: jaw and we got til morning to get
text: out of town.
text: This cracks everybody up. Laughter. A release of tension.
text: But the laughter turns to quiet sadness as the reality of
text: their situation sinks in....Marlena looks to Jacob and leans
text: into his arms. He holds her, clearly in love, then ushers her
text: out of the room for privacy.
text: Walter sees what he knew all along. He kisses Queenie:
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Aw girl. We're all in it now.
scene_heading: INT. RING STOCK CAR - EN ROUTE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
text: Marlena and Jacob exit Walter's room outside of which Marlena
text: placed her small suitcase. They pass by Marlena's horses..
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: Why are you hiding that roustabout?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Because Blackie and his men don't
dialog: work the performer train and
dialog: they'll red-light him if they find
dialog: him. He can't work anymore.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: My God.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 105.
text: They come upon Silver Star's stall - empty - right before the
text: door to the next car. They stop.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Does August know where you are?
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: No. He thinks I'm with Barbara and
dialog: the girls. He won't go there.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: He can't find you. As soon as we
dialog: stop - before we stop - we'll jump
dialog: off and I'll take you to a hotel in
dialog: town.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: And after that? August has all our
dialog: money. Where will I go?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Marlena, I'm not leaving you. We'll
dialog: find a way together. I won't let
dialog: you go back to him. I promise.
text: Marlena smiles, needing to hear him say those words. She
text: embraces him, grateful. Jacob holds her tight, assuring;
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: ..I'll call my dean at Cornell..If
dialog: I can take my finals again, get my
dialog: degree, I can get my license.
text: They lay in the Silver Star's empty stall. Moonlit through
text: the wooden slats. Making plans...
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: Oh Jacob, that would be wonderful.
dialog: You know, I bet Ringling would take
dialog: us both then - they'd be getting a
dialog: vet and a star attraction - that's
dialog: a sweet deal for them. Although I
dialog: won't be a star but I don't care.
dialog: I'll take no billing at all...We'd
dialog: be safe from August if we were with
dialog: Ringling.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Don't worry about him.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: Of course, I'd have to wait a while
dialog: until I can work again...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: Jacob...I'm going to have a baby.
text: Jacob is stunned...then confused...
speaker_heading: MARLENA (CONT'D)
dialog: It's yours. Please don't ask me how
dialog: I know...Is it all right? You can
dialog: change your mind. I'd understand.
text: Overwhelmed, Jacob keeps kissing her. Marlena lets go of all
text: the anxiety she had about him. He loves her. She knows it.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Change my mind??? Oh Marlena,
dialog: please...please be happy.
speaker_heading: MARLENA
dialog: (Cries, relieved)
dialog: I will...I promise...as soon as I
dialog: stop being terrified.
text: Jacob kisses her. He guides her to the ground, against the
text: hay. She nestles in his arms.
speaker_heading: MARLENA (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm so tired.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Rest...I've got you now.
text: Marlena tries, closing her eyes.....Then, without warning;
text: FROM THE ROOF, AUGUST, BLACKIE &amp; HIS MEN JUMP IN THROUGH THE
text: OPEN STOCK CAR DOOR. THEY CHARGE INTO THE ROOM CAUSING THE
text: HORSES TO PANIC. THE THUGS DRAG JACOB AWAY FROM MARLENA,
text: BEATING HIM. AUGUST FORCIBLY TAKES MARLENA, HITTING HER...
speaker_heading: MARLENA JACOB
text: DON'T HURT HIM!!!AUGUST NO!! MARLENA! MARLENA!...
text: AS BLACKIE AND HIS MEN DRAG JACOB PAST WALTER'S MAKESHIFT
text: DOOR, JACOB FIGHTS EVEN HARDER TO PULL THEM AWAY FROM
text: BREAKING INTO WALTER AND CAMEL'S ROOM.
speaker_heading: FAST CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 107.
scene_heading: INT. KINKO'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS - BRONX
text: Kinko sits against the door, holding a trembling Queenie
text: hearing the screams and struggle. Camel quivers in fear
text: behind the trunks.
speaker_heading: FAST CUT BACK:
scene_heading: INT. RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
text: AUGUST IS DRAGGING A SCREAMING MARLENA THROUGH THE DOOR TO
text: THE PLATFORM - TAKING HER THROUGH THE TRAIN BACK TO HIS CAR.
text: BLACKIE BEATS JACOB WHO CRIES OUT FOR MARLENA'S SAFETY,
text: HOLDING ONTO THE OPEN CAR DOORS. THE MEN BANG HIS HANDS WITH
text: THEIR FISTS UNTIL JACOB LOSES HIS GRIP AND BLACK TOSSES HIM
text: OFF THE FAST MOVING TRAIN.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - GRAVEL/GROUND - NIGHT
text: JACOB ROLLS DOWN THE GRAVEL. BLACKIE AND HIS MEN JUMP OFF THE
text: TRAIN AND RUN TOWARDS HIM. JUST AS JACOB GETS TO HIS FEET,
text: THE MEN REACH HIM - AND BEGIN TO BEAT HIM.
text: WITH A SINGLE BLOW TO THE BACK OF HIS HEAD, JACOB IS THROWN
text: INTO BLACKNESS.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS/STREAM - ALLENTOWN, PA - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: A heavy rain pours. A bloodied, battered Jacob is semi-
text: conscious face down in a stream in the woods.
text: Jacob, his eyes almost swollen shut, wakes out of
text: unconsciousness. He looks up through blurred vision.
text: Through the trees, he can see A DISTANT FLICKERING RED LIGHT.
text: He stands. His knees buckle and he crawls out to the ground.
text: He stands again. And he walks out of the woods towards the
text: flickering light.
text: He stumbles and falls. He rises and fumbles forward...using
text: all his strength to get himself out of the woods.
scene_heading: EXT. CLEARING TO TRAIN TRACKS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
text: Jacob struggles out of the woods to a clearing. Squinting
text: through the rain with swollen eyes, he sees:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 108.
text: THE FLICKERING RED LIGHT IS A SIGNAL LIGHT ON A TRAIN TRACK.
text: He walks, with legs barely able to move. He climbs up the
text: gravel to the train tracks and begins to walk...
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - PRE DAWN
text: Jacob is walking on the train tracks in the direction of
text: Marlena's train. He has walked all night and into the day.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - A PENNSYLVANIA TOWN - DAY
text: Jacob - beaten, bloodied, exhausted - looks up ahead:
text: THE BENZINI BROS. TRAIN and THE BIG TOP TENTS already set up.
scene_heading: EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - A PENNSYLVANIA TOWN - DAY
text: It's pre-matinee. All the tents have been set up. The rubes
text: are filling the grounds. The midway is packed with people.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN - BEHIND THE CIRCUS GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Nell is sitting by an open window fanning herself from the
dialog: heat when she sees:
text: Jacob wandering behind the back of the train where no one can
text: see him....Nell watches as Jacob tries to reach the train,
text: then falls unconscious.
text: Nell quickly brings Barbara to the window. Barbara sees Jacob
text: and immediately takes charge.
text: Camera tracks Barbara and the girls through the windows, as
text: they walk through the car...Barbara is organizing a plan with
dialog: the girls.
scene_heading: EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Nell and two Coochie Girls hold their robes closed as they
text: walk among the crowd. The Coochie girls head for Blackie and
text: his security men...They talk to them to distract them.
text: We see Nell approach Walter in full clown make-up doing
text: tricks with Queenie for the crowd. Nell whispers to Walter.
dialog: His expression tells us what we know.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 109.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN - BEHIND THE CIRCUS GROUNDS - DAY
text: Barbara and the Tattooed Man sneak to the fallen Jacob with a
text: blanket. They turn him over, shocked by his condition.
text: Jacob's eyes open - he's delirious.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Poor Kid...Help me with him..
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (delirious to Tattoo man)
dialog: Don't you work the matinee?
speaker_heading: TATTOOED MAN
dialog: Not today. I'm fading. I gotta re-
dialog: ink.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Don't talk.
text: Jacob nods. They cover him, pick him up and carry him off.
scene_heading: INT. KINKO'S ROOM - TRAIN EN ROUTE - NIGHT
text: Jacob opens his eyes. Walter is applying wet cloths to his
text: head. Camel watches nearby. Jacob suddenly rises;
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Marlena!!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Sshh. Lie back.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Where is she? Did he hurt her?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I don't know. Your pupils are two
dialog: different sizes.
text: Jacob pushes himself up onto his elbows but his world spins.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I have to get Marlena. What if he--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Jacob, look at me. You've got a
dialog: concussion and you're on a moving
dialog: train. There's nothing you can do.
dialog: Marlena can handle him. She's done
dialog: it for years...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I have to get her.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Jacob, you can't.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: She's going to have a baby.
text: Walter is stopped. Camel shakes his head.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Does August know?
dialog: (Jacob shakes his head)
dialog: What have you done to us?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: We're going to Ringling. Me,
dialog: Marlena. You can too.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I'm a fifth rate clown when second
dialog: rate circuses are folding all over
dialog: the place. Doesn't put me on top
dialog: of Ringling's list. They've got a
dialog: dozen of me in the wings. I
dialog: couldn't even go if I wanted to.
dialog: August won't pay anyone. Says the
dialog: show's debts have to come first.
dialog: First time in Benzini Bros history
dialog: performers haven't been paid.
dialog: People are starving out there,
dialog: Jacob. In the United States of
dialog: America. Starving. Where am I going
dialog: to go?
speaker_heading: CAMEL
dialog: What about family? Like my son.
dialog: Gotta have somebody...a mother.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Not a woman I have any use for.
dialog: She's sold me to this outfit when I
dialog: was 13.
speaker_heading: CAMEL
dialog: She sold you?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I'm not exactly cut out for farm
dialog: work. Don't worry about me..
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
dialog: ..If you and Marlena go, if August
dialog: doesn't kill you first - I'll know
dialog: what to do...I'll tell August how
dialog: well I got to know you and how I
dialog: can help him find you. Might even
dialog: get myself a better room out of the
dialog: bargain... It won't be anything
dialog: personal, you understand.
dialog: Beat. Each wants the other to survive at any cost.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Do whatever you have to, Walter.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You too, Jacob.
text: They exchange a final look, which is a goodbye. Walter turns
text: away from Jacob, holding Queenie to his chest.
text: Camel looks compassionately at Jacob and says:
speaker_heading: CAMEL
dialog: Ya poor kid. The night this train
dialog: passed ya...you shoulda kept on
dialog: running, I guess.
scene_heading: INT. KINKO'S ROOM - EN ROUTE - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Camel and Walter are snoring, asleep with their backs to
text: Jacob. Queenie is asleep, nestled in Walter's arms.
text: Jacob struggles to raise himself up. His world spins. He
text: holds tight to the bedroll, until the spinning subsides.
text: Jacob is a man with a mission. His eyes focus on: Walter's
text: Knife, sticking out from beneath Walter's pillow.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - EN ROUTE - NIGHT
text: The train is moving fast. The rain has returned.
text: Jacob is making his way towards the back of the train, as it
text: moves forward. He holds the knife in his mouth...moving like
text: a tightrope walker over the wet train roof, as rain pours.
text: When he reaches the car's end, he takes a deep breath. With
text: all his strength, he leaps across the divide between the cars
text: and lands, clinging to the top rail, panting like a dog.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 112.
text: He removes the knife from his mouth, having cut his lip. He
text: licks the blood back and replaces the knife, this time
text: keeping his lips retracted.
text: JACOB MAKES HIS WAY ACROSS SIX CARS...LEAPING FROM CAR TO CAR
text: BY LANDING ON THE ROOF, GETTING TO HIS KNEES THEN TO HIS FEET
text: AND MOVING ON TO THE NEXT...
scene_heading: EXT. ATOP MARLENA AND AUGUST'S STATEROOM CAR - NIGHT
text: Jacob leaps to the roof of Marlena and August's car. At this
text: moment, the train is making a curve.
text: Jacob climbs down over the side ladder. Beyond him, we see:
text: THE TRAIN IS TRAVERSING OVER A TRESTLE, FORTY YARDS ABOVE THE
text: BOULDERS OF A RIVERBANK ILLUMINATED BY MOONLIGHT.
text: Jacob jumps to the platform. He can see the rocky waters far
text: below the trestle. He catches his breath and waits, as the
text: train straightens out onto land again.
text: Jacob turns the knob of the door to the stateroom, slowly,
text: hearing a click, pausing, then opening it.
scene_heading: INT. MARLENA AND AUGUST STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
text: Jacob enters the stateroom, leaving the door open. He creeps
text: towards the velvet curtain which is closed. He grips the
text: knife. When he reaches it, he pulls the edge and peeks
dialog: inside.
text: August is asleep on his side, his arms locked around Marlena,
text: who is awake facing the curtain.
text: Jacob and Marlena's eyes meet. She sees the knife in his hand
text: August suddenly moves, pulls Marlena closer to his chest,
text: burying his face in her neck.
text: Jacob steps forward, raising the knife. His hands tremble.
text: The moonlight glints off the blade, throwing off light.
text: Marlena is looking up at him, tears in her eyes. She subtly
text: shakes her head "NO"...She doesn't want him to do this.
text: Jacob's hands are shaking now. The knife gripped in his hand.
text: He wants to rescue her, he's so close. We hold the moment...
text: Marlena's expression convinces Jacob not to do it...not to

text: Defeated, Jacob kneels beside her and hangs his head. Marlena
text: reaches out to touch him...this time she really is saying
text: goodbye. But Jacob can not bear it. He looks at her for the
text: last time, then rises and exits.
scene_heading: INT. RING STOCK CAR - EN ROUTE - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Jacob returns to the ring stock car, hopping down from the
text: roof. The Horses are stirring, agitated. He calms them...
text: And then Jacob sees: the door to Walter's room is open. He
speaker_heading: APPROACHES;
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Walter? Camel?
scene_heading: INT. KINKO'S ROOM/ RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
text: Jacob enters to find the room in a shambles. A terrible
text: realization comes over him:
text: Walter and Camel are gone. They have been red-lighted.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: WALTER! CAMEL!!
text: He finds Queenie, shaking with fear curled in a ball. He
text: takes her in his arms. Jacob panics.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: No..no..no..no....!!!!
text: With Queenie, he rushes back into the ring stock car...he
text: checks everywhere calling out their names. He stops at the
text: open stock car door. The rain continues to fall. Jacob
text: collapses, holding Queenie to his chest. Tears fill his eyes
text: as he tries to hold it together, looking out the moving
text: train, his worst nightmare realized.
scene_heading: POV; IN THE DISTANCE, THE TRESTLE THE TRAIN PASSED OVER
speaker_heading: JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I wanted to believe taking Walter's
dialog: knife didn't make a difference. But
dialog: still. I left him without a
dialog: fighting chance. Maybe they
dialog: survived. Maybe they were tossed
dialog: over grassy land...I couldn't let
dialog: myself believe what I already knew.
text: Jacob falls apart, crying without shame.

scene_heading: EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - ALTOONA, PA - LATE MORNING
text: A sunny day. The circus is completely set up. Townsfolk,
text: rubes, are already buying tickets for the matinee.
speaker_heading: JACOB (V.O.)
dialog: I waited almost til matinee time so
dialog: I could let myself be seen by as
dialog: many people from town.
scene_heading: EXT. RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - ALTOONA, PA - LATE MORNING
text: Jacob opens the ring stock car and jumps out, holding
text: Queenie. He hasn't slept all night.
text: As he walks through the circus grounds, working men like Greg
text: and performers like Barbara are shocked to see him alive.
text: With a fool's courage, he brazenly walks past Blackie and his
dialog: men, cutting a path through performers and working men, right
text: up to August, who stands with Earl at his side. He is dressed
text: and ready for the matinee's performance.
text: Jacob stops and they exchange looks. August glances at
text: Queenie in Jacob's arms. He says nothing.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'm not here to cause any trouble.
dialog: I'm leaving.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Funny, I thought you already left.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'd like to say goodbye. To the
text: menagerie. Just a few minutes and
dialog: then I'll go.
text: August's eyes narrow. Earl waits for the outcome.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: There's nothing more you can do to
dialog: me. Killing me'll be more trouble
dialog: than it's worth, now that the rubes
dialog: have seen me. You were right about
dialog: me from the start August, when you
dialog: said I wouldn't last...I can't
dialog: survive here...
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: I am nothing.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 115.
text: August feels victorious and therefore benevolent.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
text: Earl, take him to the menagerie.
dialog: Thirty seconds. Then escort him out
dialog: of my circus, into Altoona. And if
dialog: he comes back, you can shoot him,
dialog: as that is within our lawful rights
dialog: with regards to trespassers.
text: August walks away. Earl escorts Jacob to the menagerie. On
text: the way, they pass Barbara. Jacob pauses to hand Queenie to
text: her. She has tears in her eyes. Jacob continues with Earl.
scene_heading: INT. MENAGERIE TENT - MOMENTS LATER - ALTOONA, PA - DAY
text: Jacob enters alone. He takes in all the animals who look back
text: at him. He crosses to Rosie and stands before her. Her trunk
text: greets him, stroking him. He presses his head against her.
text: Rosie comforts him. It makes Jacob fall apart all the more...
text: After a few moments, Jacob turns and walks away. He stops in
text: the center of the menagerie. He looks at each animal in their
dialog: den - in the same way as when he first met them - this time
dialog: saying goodbye.
text: Each animal is at the front of it's den or cage, looking at
text: Jacob. There is a silent exchange between them. Earl enters.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Come on kid.
text: When Jacob starts to exit again, something happens:
text: ALL THE ANIMALS BEGIN BANGING AGAINST THEIR CAGES AND SHAKING
text: THEIR BARS OR STOMPING THEIR FEET, SCREECHING OR ROARING OR
text: BELLOWING, AS IF IN PROTEST OF THEIR JACOB'S DEPARTURE.
text: The lock on Rex's cage busts a little as he rams against it.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDESHOW TENTS/MIDWAY - ALTOONA, PA - DAY
text: As Earl escorts Jacob, they walk against the tide of audience
text: members walking to the Big Top entrance. Earl speaks low.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: It's good you're going. They must
dialog: have known you got back on the
dialog: train last night. He tossed more
text: than half a dozen working men.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: EARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Kinkers never get tossed. Never. So
dialog: that was meant for you.
text: We hear the GOUNOD WALTZ starting in the Big Top.
speaker_heading: EARL (CONT'D)
dialog: A few of the guys that got tossed
dialog: caught up with us again.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Walter! Is he---?
text: Instantly, Earl's expression tells Jacob it's bad news.
text: Jacob's breathing almost stops as he listens;
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Keep walking...They got tossed off
dialog: the trestle, if you can believe it.
text: Camel's head hit the rocks. He died
dialog: right away...
text: Jacob is heartbroken and dreads what he's about to hear. Earl
text: pauses for a beat...this part is harder to tell:
speaker_heading: EARL (CONT'D)
dialog: ...Walter...Walter's legs were
dialog: smashed up real bad..They had to
dialog: leave him.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: They don't reckon he lasted the
dialog: night.
text: Jacob is in shock. He can barely walk on...
speaker_heading: EARL (CONT'D)
dialog: The ones that came back...Bill...
dialog: Grady.. I don't know how but, one
dialog: way or another they're taking down
dialog: August tonight.
text: Hearing this, Jacob stops to face Earl.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Why are you telling me?
dialog: Earl can not find the words: it's clear the killing of these
text: men does not sit well with him.
text: SUDDENLY, WE HEAR THE BIG TOP MUSIC COME TO A CRASHING HALT,
text: FOLLOWED BY AN UNGODLY COLLISION OF BRASS THAT FINISHES WITH
text: A CYMBAL'S HOLLOW CLANG.
text: Earl shifts his focus - he's alarmed.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 117.
speaker_heading: JACOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Earl, what was that?
text: All the performers and work men on the midway are on alert.
text: WE HEAR THE BIG TOP BAND START PLAYING AGAIN...THIS TIME IT'S
text: "STARS AND STRIPES FOREVER".
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Oh Christ! Oh Shit...
text: Earl runs back towards the Big Top.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: The Disaster March!
text: Everyone with the show barrels towards the Big Top when Greg

speaker_heading: GREG
text: JACOB! IT'S THE MENAGERIE!! THE
text: ANIMALS ARE LOOSE.
text: JACOB RUNS THROUGH THE PANICKED CROWD, THE GROUND RUMBLING
text: BENEATH HIS FEET...THE SOUNDS OF HOOVES ON HARD DIRT.
scene_heading: INT. MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
text: Jacob shoots through the tent flap and is immediately flung
text: up against the sidewall as:
text: THE YAK THUNDERS PAST HIM, HIS HORN INCHES FROM JACOB, THE
text: HYENA ON HIS BACK. Jacob looks to the menagerie and faces;
scene_heading: A FULL FLEDGED STAMPEDE:
text: - ALL THE ANIMAL DENS ARE OPEN.
scene_heading: - CREATURES OF EVERY SORT...CHIMP, ORANGUTAN, LLAMAS, ZEBRA,
scene_heading: LION, GIRAFFE, CAMEL AND HORSES... RUN IN A MAD TERROR AS

text: Jacob is scanning the tent for Marlena when:
text: - THE ORANGUTAN RUNS THROUGH THE STAMPEDE DIRECTLY TO JACOB
text: AND CLUTCHES ONTO JACOB'S LEG. JACOB MOVES TO PICK HER UP
text: WHEN BOBO SWINGS FROM A ROPE AND JUMPS ONTO JACOB'S BACK.
text: Jacob manages to hold Bobo in one arm and the Orangutan in
text: the other as his eyes sweep the tent, searching for Marlena:
text: Then Jacob sees - THE PANTHER MAKES IT'S WAY THROUGH THE
text: CONNECTED WALKWAY TO THE BIG TOP AUDIENCE.
scene_heading: - SECONDS LATER, AUDIENCE SCREAMS OF TERROR ARE HEARD. THE
text: CROWD EXPLODES THROUGH THE BIG TOP, TRAMPLING OVER FELLOW

scene_heading: - THE CLOG BURSTS. PEOPLE AND ANIMALS FLEE IN EVERY

text: - A BENGAL TIGER FORCES ITSELF BETWEEN A WOMAN'S LEGS,
text: SWEEPING HER TO THE GROUND...
text: Searching and dodging animals, Jacob sees a flash of pink
text: sequins. He sees August with Marlena standing beside him, in
text: front of Rosie.
speaker_heading: JACOB
speaker_heading: MARLENA!
text: Marlena sees Jacob and makes a run for him, but August
text: quickly grabs her arm and flings her to the ground. She falls
text: out of view from Jacob.
text: Jacob runs to them, dodging the fleeing animals, when
text: suddenly: A BULL HOOK FLIES FROM OUT OF THE AIR ACROSS THE
text: ANIMALS AND PIERCES JACOB'S SHOULDER. He cries out.
text: Rosie cries out. She begins to stamp her feet. Marlena lies
text: with her face in the dirt, crawling beneath the ropes to get
dialog: under Rosie for safety.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 119.
text: August pulls Jacob with a new bull hook, tossing him the
text: ground. August glares at him, his eyes full of rage;
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: YOU! YOU DID THIS!!
text: He attacks but Jacob dodges the next blow, grabbing onto the
text: bull hook and twisting it with such strength, it topples
text: August who refuses to let it go...
text: JACOB AND AUGUST FIGHT SAVAGELY, AMIDST THE STAMPEDE. Like
text: madmen fighting with the intention to kill.
text: Jacob unleashes a rage and a strength we have yet to see in
text: him, as he beats August without mercy...
text: But August manages to overpower Jacob, unleashing his own
text: maniacal fury. By taking advantage of the bull hook wound,
text: August gets Jacob into a death grip around his neck.
text: Marlena screams out, unable to help as animals stampede
text: around the two men locked in combat.
text: Only Rosie, who towers above them, knows what to do.
text: Jacob, choking under August's grip, looks up at Rosie. She
text: raises her trunk to smile at him. Jacob looks down and sees
text: that ROSIE'S STAKE HAS BEEN PULLED OUT OF THE GROUND.
text: Jacob fights August to breathe as Rosie reveals she is
text: holding the stake loosely, resting it's end on the dirt. The
text: chain still attached to her foot.
text: Jacob flips himself which forces August to turn his back on
text: Rosie in order to keep his grip on Jacob.
text: Marlena covers her head in her arms, not wanting to see.
text: Jacob can not breathe..August is squeezing the life from him
dialog: AS:
text: Rosie lifts the stake as if it weighs nothing and brings it
text: down onto August, splitting his head in one clean move. She
text: continues to hold the stake until August topples forward,
text: dead, his skull opened like a hardboiled egg..
text: Released of August, Jacob rolls himself under the ropes just
speaker_heading: BEFORE:
text: A HERD OF ZEBRAS RUN PAST, CRUSHING AUGUST BENEATH THEM.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 120.
text: Rosie then slides the stake back to the ground. Marlena, head
text: hidden under her arms, sees nothing. The menagerie is clear
text: of the stampeding animals.
text: Marlena lifts her head up from beneath her arms, remaining
text: under Rosie. She sees August lifeless body. She looks to
text: Jacob. He rises, bloodied and beaten, but alive.
text: WIDE ANGLE: The empty menagerie except for: Jacob standing,
text: Marlena under Rosie and the two monkeys inspecting August's

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Not all of them! Some of these

speaker_heading: DICK NESCI
dialog: Do you have any proof?
text: Jacob is stalled. Greg appears.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: He's right. He's just an elephant

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You don't want her anyway. She

text: Skeptical, Dick Nesci steps up to Rosie.
speaker_heading: DICK NESCI
dialog: What's her name?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Gertrude.

speaker_heading: DICK NESCI
dialog: Gertrude! Gertrude, step up! UP!

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

text: The Cop is suspicious. Charlie covers:
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: He can't talk. Had a major stroke a
dialog: few years back. But he's doing
dialog: well. Ain't ya Pop?
text: Understanding the ruse, Jacob starts to play the part of a
text: stroke victim: he opens his mouth, his jaw quivers. He
text: reaches for his glass with a shaking arm. Charlie helps him.
text: Jacob holds out his tongue like a parrot's as Charlie helps
text: him drink. The Cop watches with a blank expression. Jacob
text: swallows and nods speechless, smiles and manages to drool.
text: Beat. The Cop wonders. Then, pulling out his card:
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: OK, well, thanks for your time.
dialog: Here's my number in case you hear

text: Jacob lets go of the walker and reaches his arm out to the
dialog: Orangutan's cage.
text: The Orangutan studies him for a moment. Judging.
text: Jacob keeps his arm extended, which isn't easy for him.
