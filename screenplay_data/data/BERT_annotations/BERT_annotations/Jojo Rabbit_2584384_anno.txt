dialog: - Neck kerchief tied.
dialog: = Socks pulled up.

text: He is dressed. We PULL to a CLOSE-UP, coming face to face
speaker_heading: with our HERO
dialog: 
text: JOHANNES BETZLER, (JOJO), a cute 10 year-old boy.
text: The room is covered with NAZI POSTERS and other
scene_heading: PARAPHERNALIA, including pictures of ADOLF HITLER. You
dialog: guessed it, he’s a little Nazi.
text: Jojo stares into a full-length mirror and takes a deep
dialog: breath.
dialog: gogo
dialog: Jojo Betzler. Ten years old. And today
dialog: you join the ranks of the Jungvolk in a
dialog: very special training weekend. It’s going
dialog: to be intense. But today you become a
dialog: man.
dialog: (deep breath, nervous)
dialog: I swear to devote all my energies and my
dialog: strength to the savior of our country,
dialog: Adolf Hitler. I am willing and ready to
dialog: give up my life for him, so help me God.
text: A STRANGE FIGURE passes behind him, an ADULT, dressed in a
text: NAZI UNIFORM. It feels ghostly and fantastical. We'll find
dialog: out who this guy is very soon.
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Yeah man, that’s right.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Now, Jojo Betzler, what is your mind?

speaker_heading: JOJO
text: A German soul.
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.8.)
dialog: Yeah man, you're ready.
dialog: gogo
dialog: Adolf, I don’t think I can do this.
text: The stranger leans into shot, revealing it’s none other than
text: Jojo's IMAGINARY FRIEND, ADOLF HITLER. However, it’s not the
dialog: Hitler we're all used to, he’s imaginary and therefore can
dialog: only know what Jojo knows. He’s more of a charming buffoon
text: who floats through life with carefree, whimsical abandon.
speaker_heading: ADOLF
dialog: What?! Of course you can. Sure you're a
dialog: bit scrawny, unpopular, and still can’t
dialog: tie your shoelaces without adult
dialog: supervision, but you're also the bestest,
dialog: most loyal little Nazi I've ever met. Not
dialog: to mention you're incredibly handsome.
dialog: 
text: Jojo smiles. Feeling better.
speaker_heading: ADOLF (CONT'D)
dialog: Now you're gonna go out there and have a

text: Jojo and Yorki sit with a large group of other young kids,

text: CAPTAIN KLENZENDORF, weathered, disillusioned, addresses the
text: crowd of kids. He has a DEAD-EYE and is accompanied by the

speaker_heading: KLENZENDORF

speaker_heading: KLENZENDORF
dialog: Jungvolk, welcome to the Hitlerjugend

dialog: Captain K.
speaker_heading: FINKEL
dialog: Captain K! Woo!
speaker_heading: KLENZENDORF
dialog: -and this is Sub-Officer Finkel. And
dialog: Fraulein Rahm.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So, a little about me. Who am I and why
dialog: am I here talking to a bunch of little
dialog: titty-grabbers instead of leading my men
dialog: into battle towards glorious death? Great
dialog: question. I’ve asked it myself every day
dialog: since Operation Screw-Up, where I lost a
dialog: perfectly good eye in a totally
dialog: preventable enemy attack. And according
dialog: to my superiors, you need two eyes to be
text: a meaningful part of the war effort.
dialog: 
text: Beat. He picks up a rifle and quickly fires a shot, hitting a
text: target 100 yards away. The kids applaud.
speaker_heading: KLENZENDORF (CONT’D)
dialog: Over the next two days you little
dialog: critters will get to experience some of
dialog: the things that the mighty German Army
dialog: goes through every day. And even though
dialog: it would appear our country’s on the back
dialog: foot and that there really isn’t much
dialog: hope us of winning this war, apparently
dialog: we're doing just fine.
dialog: (takes a breath, composes
dialog: himself, he’s sad)
dialog: Anyway. You boys have all been issued
dialog: with your Deutsches Jungvolk Daggers.
text: Jojo and Yorki inspect and admire their nice new DEUTSCHES
scene_heading: JUNGVOLK (DJ) KNIVES.
speaker_heading: KLENZENDORF (CONT’D)
dialog: These are very special and expensive
dialog: weapons, you should never be without
dialog: them. And don’t try to stab each other.
speaker_heading: FINKEL
dialog: No stabbing!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: KLENZENDORF
dialog: This is your first step towards being

text: drills, grenade throwing, trench digging,
dialog: map reading, gas defense, camouflage,
dialog: trap setting, ambush techniques, war
text: games, firing guns and blowing stuff up.
text: Huge cheers from the group of boys. Jojo and Yorki smile at
dialog: each other, this is going to be awesome.
speaker_heading: KLENZENDORF (CONT’D)
dialog: The girls will practice important womanly
dialog: duties such as dressing wounds, making
dialog: beds, and learning how to get pregnant.
text: Groans of disappointment from the girls. Klenzendorf holds
text: the bridge of his nose as if preparing for the impending
text: headache he’s about to endure over the weekend. He sighs.
speaker_heading: KLENZENDORF (CONT'D)
dialog: Alright, let’s get to it.
text: The crowd of kids salute and start screaming in excitement.
text: The older boys start yelling at smaller kids, rounding them
text: up and y'know, being Nazis. Finkel and Rahm lead them off.
speaker_heading: FINKEL
dialog: On your feet you little Nazis! Let’s go!
speaker_heading: FRAULEIN RAHM

text: angles, one ricochets, lodging itself in another kid’s thigh.
text: - GUN RANGE. Jojo and some other kids aim their KARABINER 98K

text: wearing RED SASHES and the other GREEN. They chase each other

text: words, along with others, on a blackboard. Above them is the
text: heading: THE JEW. Finkel stands nearby, observing and taking
dialog: notes.
speaker_heading: FRAULEIN RAHM
dialog: Fantastisch! Excellent work children. You
dialog: also forgot that the Jew is the offspring
dialog: of Satan and sucks the blood of Christian
dialog: children for their mitzvah.
text: Gasps from the children. Finkel nods - I'm afraid so.
speaker_heading: FRAULEIN RAHM (CONT’D)
dialog: It has been scientifically proven that we
dialog: Aryans are 1000 times more advanced and
dialog: civilised than any other race.
text: Gasps and applause from the children. Fraulein Rahm smiles.
speaker_heading: FRAULEIN RAHM (CONT’D)

text: Jojo and Yorki lie awake in sleeping bags, inspecting their
text: new DJ KNIVES.
dialog: gogo
dialog: Imagine being in a battle, you've just
dialog: run out of ammo, all you have is your DJ
dialog: Knife. I would take down 20 of them
dialog: before they got me. And I’d be laughing
dialog: when they did.
speaker_heading: YORKI
dialog: I don’t like that situation. I don’t want
dialog: to die at all.
dialog: Jogo
dialog: Live Faithfully, Fight Bravely, and Die
dialog: Laughing, Yorki, that’s the motto.
speaker_heading: YORKI
dialog: I know but I wouldn’t be laughing. I'd
text: probably be screaming.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: gogo
dialog: Then I’m afraid you might not be cut out
dialog: for Hitler’s personal guard. It’s really
dialog: hard to get chosen y'know. You need to
dialog: have perfect vision, perfect teeth and
dialog: you're only allowed a little bit of fat.
speaker_heading: YORKI
dialog: (prodding his chubbiness)
dialog: Jews sound scary, huh?
dialog: gogo
dialog: Not to me. If I met one I’d kill it like
dialog: that.
dialog: (tries to snap his fingers)
dialog: that.
dialog: 
dialog: Like
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YORKI
dialog: But how would you know if you saw one?
dialog: They can look just like us.
speaker_heading: JosO
dialog: Oh I'd know. I’d feel it’s head for
dialog: horns. And they smell like Brussels
dialog: Sprouts.
speaker_heading: YORKI
dialog: Oh yeah, I forgot about the Brussels
text: Sprouts bit.
dialog: gogo
dialog: Imagine catching one and giving it to
dialog: Hitler. That’d be a sure-fire way to get
text: into his personal guard.
speaker_heading: YORKI
dialog: He'd be so impressed.
dialog: gogo
dialog: Then we would become best friends.
speaker_heading: YORKI
dialog: I thought I was your best friend
dialog: gogo
dialog: Yorki, you're my second best friend.
dialog: First place is reserved for the Fihrer.
dialog: He, and only he can have that spot, so
dialog: unless you’re Hitler hiding in a fat

dialog: place.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CHRISTOPH
dialog: When you stand before the enemy and have
dialog: to end his life, which of you will have
dialog: the stomach for it?
text: Everyone raises their hands. Jojo too, although a little
dialog: slow.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPH (CONT'D)
dialog: There is no room in Hitler's army for
dialog: those who lack strength. We want hardened
dialog: warriors who are prepared to kill at
dialog: will. Can you do that?
speaker_heading: OTHER KIDS
dialog: Yes / Sure / Oh absolutely
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPH
dialog: Johannes? Can you kill?
dialog: gogo
dialog: Pf£f, of course. I love killing.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPH
dialog: Good...
text: Hans uncovers a small cage nearby - it is filled with little

speaker_heading: CHRISTOPH (CONT'D)
dialog: Kill it.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: ll.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: Jogo
dialog: Hmm?
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPH
dialog: Wring its neck. Kill the rabbit
dialog: gogo
dialog: Oh, I’m ok. I might do it later.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPH
dialog: No later, NOW. Or are you scared?
dialog: 
dialog: gogo
dialog: I’m not scared. I'm just allergic to fur
dialog: and I don’t want itchy hands all weekend.
text: Hans shoves the rabbit into Jojo's hands.
speaker_heading: HANS
text: Place both hands around its neck and then
dialog: one hard twist. He might scream but we'll
dialog: just use the boot to finish it off.
dialog: Rill... kill...
text: Jojo, shaking now, holds the bunny and looks at it directly
text: in the eye. He gulps. The boys join the chant
speaker_heading: OTHER KIDS
dialog: Kill, Kill, Kill, Kill...
text: The boys are like baying wolves; they crouch in around Jojo
text: as he leans over the rabbit.
text: Jojo DROPS the bunny, trying to shoo it away. But it doesn’t
text: run and Hans steps forward, grabs the rabbit, and snaps its
text: neck. Shocked gasps and squeaks of horror from the kids. One
text: of them faints. Probably Yorki.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPH
dialog: Coward. Just like your father.
speaker_heading: JOIO
dialog: He's not a coward, he’s in Italy.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPH
dialog: No one has heard from him in two years.
dialog: He's a deserting coward just like you.
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: Yeah, he’s a deserter.
speaker_heading: JOIO

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: He’s scared and so are you. You're as
text: scared as a rabbit.
text: He kicks Jojo to the ground. Hans places a boot on his neck.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPH
dialog: Scared little rabbit. Maybe we should
dialog: snap your neck too.
text: The rest of the kids taunt Jojo. He stands and runs into the
text: woods, trying to escape the laughter. Hans encourages them to
text: chant “Jojo Rabbit” as he runs.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DAY
text: Jojo sits alone on a log, sobbing to himself. He looks up to
text: see a little BUTTERFLY flitting around by his feet... and
text: then a voice comes from behind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Poor Jojo, what’s wrong, little man’
text: Jojo turns around, it’s Adolf
dialog: gogo
dialog: Hi Adolf.
text: Adolf takes a seat.
speaker_heading: ADOLF
dialog: Why so down in the dumps? A strong boy
dialog: like yourself shouldn't be sad, you
dialog: should be happy like a cloud! Clouds
dialog: don’t care about anything!
dialog: gogo
dialog: They called me a coward. And my papa,
dialog: they say he makes desserts instead of
dialog: fighting. But I know he’s still fighting
dialog: for you, for me, and for Germany.
speaker_heading: ADOLF
dialog: Oh, of course he is! And he is also
dialog: making nice desserts, nothing wrong with
dialog: that. My God, his custard tarts are the

dialog: Jogo
dialog: But now they call me a scared rabbit.
speaker_heading: ADOLF
dialog: Well you want to know something?
dialog: (Off Jojo's nod)
dialog: Just because they’re small and
dialog: delightfully cute doesn’t mean rabbits
text: are cowards. The rabbit faces a dangerous
dialog: world everyday, hunting carrots for his
dialog: family... for his country. Forget those
dialog: boys. They have their place and so do
dialog: you. My empire will be made up of all
text: animals, eagles, lions, elephants and
dialog: even the mighty rabbit.
text: Hitler offers Jojo a cigarette.
dialog: gogo
dialog: No thanks, I don't sm-~
speaker_heading: ADOLF
dialog: Can I give you some really good advice?
dialog: Be the rabbit. The humble bunny can
dialog: outwit all his enemies and that is why he
dialog: is a hero. Be. The. Rabbit.
text: He winks at Jojo who tries to wink back but still can only
text: manage a weird double wink-blink. Adolf wanders off.

speaker_heading: YORKI
dialog: Jojo! Are you alright Jojo? Who were you

dialog: Pretty much healed. It only eighty

dialog: here?
speaker_heading: KLENZENDORF
dialog: I’m also being made to teach the HJ boys

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: KLENZENDORF
dialog: If you see a Jew then we tell the Gestapo

dialog: Jew. And, because these are very paranoid
dialog: times, probably some other people just in
dialog: case. It’s a pretty drawn out process.
text: Jojo gulps.
dialog: gogo
dialog: Even if the Jew hypnotised someone to
dialog: make them hide the Jew in the first
dialog: place?
speaker_heading: KLENZENDORF
dialog: I'd be amazed if that could happen.
speaker_heading: FRAULEIN RAHM
dialog: It can. It happened to my uncle. This Jew
text: hypnotised him into drunk fishing and he
dialog: drowned.
dialog: (to Jojo, suddenly probing)
dialog: Did you see one? A Jew?
dialog: gogo
dialog: Nope. I’m not sure I'd be able to tell if
dialog: I did.
speaker_heading: KLENZENDORF
dialog: Me neither. Without their funny hats it’s
dialog: damn near impossible. Someone should
dialog: write a book on the subject. It’d make
dialog: everything a lot easier.
text: This sparks an idea in Jojo’s head.
text: A WHISTLE is heard and we cut to see a group of HITLER JUGEND

dialog: Ok, here’s the situation. If I tell on
dialog: you, you'll be in big trouble and I don’t
dialog: think you want that. But then you’ll tell
dialog: on me and my mother and we'll be in
dialog: trouble which I don’t want. And if you
dialog: tell my mother I know, then she'll kick

speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: But what people don’t know is that we are

dialog: Jogo
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: Cheese, bread, meat. Those things will

dialog: of ending my life, that’s the fastest

text: Jojo writes this down, stops. He gets it.

speaker_heading: ELSA

speaker_heading: DEERTZ
dialog: You see we deal with an overwhelming
dialog: number of reports, denunciations, and
dialog: general investigations which means we are
text: severely understaffed and overworked
text: Deertz opens the curtains and looks out the window
speaker_heading: DEERTZ (CONT’D)
dialog: Now, of course we are indeed interested
dialog: in problems of crime and anti-party
dialog: sentiment, but we still have one greater
dialog: concern; that of the Goldilocksies,
text: running amok, taking advantage of other
text: people in this city. Sneaking around

text: and then flicking a look to Elsa.
text: POV of the papers shows Inga when she was sick, GAUNT and
text: PALE; the two girls share a vague resemblance.
speaker_heading: KLENZENDORF

speaker_heading: ELSA

speaker_heading: DEERTZ,
dialog: Wait. What is this... Yoohoo...Jew?
dialog: 
text: Jojo gulps. Deertz spies Jojo’s BOOK sitting on the dresser.
text: He opens the book and starts flicking through the pages. The

text: then... he giggles.
speaker_heading: DEERTZ (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: DEERTZ
dialog: This is amazing. Guys, look at this.
text: Klenzendorf and the others gather round Deertz as he shows

speaker_heading: DEERTZ (CONT’D)
dialog: Where did you get all of these ideas?
dialog: gogo
dialog: It's an... exposé. For the Fuhrer.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: I just said that, Johannes.
speaker_heading: DEERTZ
dialog: An exposé. Oh, I think he would

dialog: (turning a page)
dialog: Ooh, this is a drawing of their anatomy.
dialog: Look, this one here shows the inside of
dialog: their heads. How wonderful.
text: The officers are all giggling now.
speaker_heading: KLENZENDORF

speaker_heading: DEERTZ
dialog: Oh look, this guy is killing a giant. oh

speaker_heading: ADOLF (CONT'D)
dialog: I am beginning to question your loyalty
