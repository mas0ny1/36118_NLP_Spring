text: A light rain and crickets CHIRPING. Somewhere in the night,

text: Water trickles out of a jagged pipe. Splashing up mud, the

text: The tiny stream ripples past glass and trash and the body of a
text: woman. Face up, breathing. Dead grass caught in her braids.
text: Her name is RONNA MARTIN. She's eighteen and bleeding.
text: Bleeding a lot.
text: She tries to push herself up, but the dirt around her crumbles.
text: Her legs are useless. Despite it all, there's a smile of

text: Ronna wakes up, a bit at a time, an IV dripping overhead. We
text: hear carolers SINGING in the distance.
text: Her nose crinkles, her tongue finds her lips. Finally a
text: swollen eye opens, looks around. A MEXICAN FAMILY is gathered
text: around the other bed in the room, the father dressed as Santa
dialog: Claus.
text: Ronna sees the IV dangling from her arm. She sits up with
text: difficulty, a head rush. She tries to get her bearings, but
text: genuinely doesn't know how she got here.
text: After a beat, she rips off the tape and carefuly pulls the
text: needle out of her arm.

speaker_heading: RONNA
dialog: Alright. Mistakes were made. Things

text: Claire's eyes -- understatement.
speaker_heading: RONNA [CONT'D]
dialog: But it wasn't exactly a banner night for

text: Claire stops, disbelieving -- if Ronna only knew. She turns on

dialog: to face her to say...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You are constantly using us.
speaker_heading: RONNA
dialog: Using you? You use me. Come on,

speaker_heading: MALE VOICE [O.S.]
dialog: It's Todd.
text: A beat, then Simon finally drops his panic. He keeps the gun
text: in hand as he pulls the chair away from the doorknob and slowly
text: undoes the lock. He leaves the chain on.
text: Looking out through the crack, we see Gaines, alone.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Jesus, Todd. Thank God.
dialog: (undoes chain)
dialog: You won't believe the shit I've been
dialog: through...
text: Without a word, Gaines grabs him by the collar and SMASHES him,
