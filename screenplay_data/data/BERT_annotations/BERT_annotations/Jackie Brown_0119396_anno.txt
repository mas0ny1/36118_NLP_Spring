dialog: 
text: One bikini beauty is singled out. She's a gorgeous

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: (to camera)
dialog: Hi, I'm Sidney. And I love to TEC-9.

scene_heading: INT. MELANIE'S BEAHC APARTMENT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The Black Voice belong to forty-five-year old ORDELL
speaker_heading: ROBBIE.
dialog: 
dialog: Ordell wears clothes nice and likes wearing nice clothes.
text: Stylish, athletic wear (Reebok), heavy, black leather
text: jackets (Hugo Boss), warm-colored berets and baseball
text: caps to cover his balding head are Ordell's "look." At
text: this moment Ordell's wearing an open silk shirt.
dialog: 
text: Ordell narrates the video playing on the big-screen V.
text: (the most expensive thing in the apartment). He holds a
text: cocktail in one hand (screwdriver, his drink of choice)
text: and the remote control in the other, pacing the floor in
dialog: his I-can-talk-anybody-into-anything voice.
dialog: 
text: LOUIS GARA, who looks like he does his shopping at the
text: Salvation Army (dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and
text: dungarees), sits on the sofa staring blankly at the
text: video, drinking Jack Daniels on ice. Louis, white, also
text: in his mid forties, has lived over half of his life in
dialog: penal institutions. The experience has affected both his
text: body language and his thought process.
dialog: 
text: While acutely aware of the rhythm of life inside a
dialog: correction facility, in the real world his timing is
text: thrown. It's like a song he doesn't know the lyrics to
text: but attempt to sing anyway.
dialog: 
text: The third person watching the video is the person who
text: lives in this apartment, MELANIE RALSTON. Melanie, thirty-
text: three, is a tanned, blonde, California beach bunny. Like
dialog: the kind you se in the old Crown International movies
dialog: from the seventies like "Pom Pom Girls" "Malibu Beach"
dialog: and "Beach Girls," except Melanie is older than any of
dialog: those girls ever are. She's dressed in her Melanie-
text: uniform of stringy Levis cutoffs and a stringy bra top.
dialog: So far Melanie has been able to make a living out of
text: lying in the sun, always finding a generous, wealthy man
text: more than willing to pay her rent and pick up her tabs.
dialog: In her prime (twenty two) it was Japanese industrialists,
dialog: film production guys, and Middle Eastern businessmen who
dialog: kept Melanie. And it was places like the Bahamas,
dialog: Acapulco, and the Virgin Islands where they kept her.
dialog: 
text: But now, at thirty three, she lives in an apartment in
dialog: Hermosa Beach, California that Ordell pays for an drops
text: in and out of. She's curled up in a reclining chair,
text: smoking weed from a pipe, reading Movieline Magazine and
text: paying no attention to the video.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: This TEC-9? They advertise it as
dialog: being the most popular gun in
dialog: American crime. Can you believe that
dialog: shit? It actually says that on the
dialog: little booklet that comes with it.
dialog: "Most Popular Gun in American Crime,"
dialog: like they're proud of that shit.
dialog: 
text: Ordell hits the fast-forward on his remote control.
dialog: 
text: Sidney is rushed off the screen and replace by CINDY, a
text: pretty, blonde bodybuilder clad in a red, white and blue
text: bikini, holding a Styer Aug.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Check out this body-builder chick...
dialog: Now see what she got. That's a Styer
dialog: aug. Styer Aug's a bad motherfucker.
dialog: Listen.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Cindy BLASTS the Styer Aug, loud.
dialog: 
text: Ordell imitates the sound of the weapon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit's expensive, man. Comes from
dialog: Austria. My customers don't know shit
dialog: about it, so there ain't no demand.
dialog: (to Melanie)
dialog: Baby, I could use some more ice.
dialog: 
text: Melanie puts down the magazine, takes his cocktail glass
text: from him and moves to the kitchen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL (CONT'D)
dialog: But put that bad boy in a flick,
dialog: every motherfucker out there want
dialog: one. I'm serious as a heart attack.
dialog: Them Hong Kong movies came out, every
dialog: nigga gotta have a forty-five. And
dialog: they don't want one, they want two,
dialog: cause nigga want to be "The Killer."
dialog: What they don't know, and that movie
dialog: don't tell you is a .45 has a serious
dialog: fuckin' jammin' problem. I always try
dialog: and steer a customer towards a 9-
dialog: millimeter. Damn near the same
dialog: weapon, don't have half the jammin'
dialog: problems. But some niggas out there,
dialog: you can't tell them anything. They
text: want a .45. The killer had a .45,

speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: See, what did I tell you? Man in New

dialog: 
text: Ordell puts one more shot in his head, BAM, tosses the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DARGUS (O.S.)
dialog: We could, smart ass... or we could
dialog: work out what's known as a
dialog: Substantial Assistance Agreement.
dialog: That is if you're willing to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLET (O.S.)
dialog: You got a good lawyer?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DARGUS (O.S.)
dialog: Can she afford a good one is the

dialog: Sybill Brand three weeks easy before
text: the Public Defender gets around to
dialog: her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLET (O.S.)
dialog: Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont
dialog: Livingston?
dialog: 
dialog: Not a word.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLET (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't know Beaumont? That's funny
dialog: 'cause Beaumont knows you. Well he
dialog: did know you, Beaumont was found in
text: the trunk of a car - dead. Shot
dialog: twice. Once in the head and once in
text: the chest.
dialog: 
text: Jackie, she puts the "ool" in "cool."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLET (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I had the chance to talk to Beaumont
dialog: yesterday. You see, like you,
dialog: Beaumont found himself in some hot
text: water. He was looking at ten years he
dialog: was pretty sure he didn't want to do
dialog: and was understandably concerned. Now
dialog: maybe you don't know Beaumont, but
dialog: Beaumont knew you, and maybe so does
text: the guy who blew Beaumont's head off.
dialog: 
dialog: Not a word.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DARGUS (O.S.)
dialog: If you don't want to talk to us, I

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Okay, let's go.
dialog: 
text: She stares down the cops.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DARGUS AND NICOLET
dialog: 
dialog: We cut to the detective and the special agent for the
text: first time in the scene.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DARGUS
dialog: You know, Miss Brown, there's
dialog: basically three types of people that
dialog: we come along in the performance of
dialog: our duty. One is, INNOCENT PEOPLE.
dialog: Victims, witnesses, innocent
dialog: bystanders... You ain't any of these.
text: Then there's two; CRIMINALS. These
dialog: sonabitches have dedicated their
dialog: lives to a life outside the law. That
dialog: ain't you either. Where you belong is
dialog: the third category. The category we
dialog: refer to as LOSERS.
dialog: 
text: Jackie's eyes don't even narrow at the insult. She just
dialog: says without expression;
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I'm not a loser.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DARGUS
dialog: Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were
dialog: flying for TWA and got busted for
dialog: carrying drugs. You were carrying
dialog: them for a pilot husband of yours. He
dialog: did time and you got off. But that
dialog: ended your career with the big
dialog: airlines. Cut to thirteen years
dialog: later. You're forty-four years of
dialog: age. You're flying for the shittiest
dialog: little shuttle-fucking piece of shit
dialog: Mexican airline that there is. Where
dialog: you make a whopping twelve-thousand
dialog: dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva
dialog: lot to show for a twenty year career.
dialog: And to top it off, you're going to
text: jail. Now true, the judge, even with
dialog: your prior, will probably only give
dialog: you a year or two. But this doesn't
dialog: seem like the time of life you got
dialog: years to throw away.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Now, we don't like trying losers like
dialog: they're criminals. But in the absence
dialog: of a criminal, we will try you. Now,
dialog: wasn't this money given to you by an
dialog: American living in Mexico by the name
dialog: of Cedric Walker?
dialog: 
text: Jackie remains unmoved by this monologue.
dialog: 
text: Nicolet joins back in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLET
dialog: You know, ol' Beaumont wasn't much
dialog: for talkin', either. Yeah, he told us
dialog: about you and Mr. Walker, but whoever
dialog: the hell it was he worked for out
dialog: here, he wouldn't say. Could it be
dialog: the same person you were supposed to
dialog: deliver this money to?
dialog: 
text: Jackie just stares at them, saying nothing.
dialog: 
text: Dargus sits behind his desk, with Jackie's flight bag on
dialog: it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DARGUS
dialog: I'd like your permission to open this
dialog: again. So we'll know exactly how much
dialog: money we're talkin' about here.
dialog: 
text: Jackie gets up from her chair, walks over to the desk,
text: unzips the bag, takes out the manila envelope and drops
text: it on the desk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Help yourself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DARGUS
dialog: While you're at it, let me see what
dialog: else is in there. You mind?
dialog: 
text: She reaches in the bag and brings out a pocketbook.

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: My pocketbook.

speaker_heading: DARGUS

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Beauty products.

speaker_heading: NICOLET
dialog: I'll count the money.

speaker_heading: DARGUS
dialog: What's this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE

speaker_heading: DARGUS

speaker_heading: NICOLET

speaker_heading: JACKIE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DARGUS
dialog: Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin'

text: She is an airline stewardess. Got

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: The bond for possession is only a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: They fuckin' wit' her. They callin'

dialog: happened to a movie star. It's
dialog: Possession.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
text: It still sounds high.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: She had, I believe it was... fifty

dialog: wanted her bond set at twenty-five

dialog: flight. Jackie being a stewardess and
dialog: all.

dialog: Very first motherfuckin' thing they

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Beaumont worked for you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: That's what the police thought. I

dialog: know was she doing things for me, was
dialog: she bringing me that money!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Was she?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: Is this, me and you, like a lawyer-

dialog: tell nothing he hears?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You're not my client until you get
dialog: busted and I bond you out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: If there's no - what do you call it -
dialog: confidentiality between us? Why would
dialog: I tell you anything?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Cause you want me to know what a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: Why would a stewardess bring me fifty
dialog: grand?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You want me to speculate on what you
dialog: do. I'd say you're in the drug
dialog: business, except the money's moving
dialog: in the wrong direction. Whatever
dialog: you're into, you seem to be getting
dialog: away with it, so more power to you.
dialog: Okay you want another bond, and you
dialog: want to move over the ten thousand
dialog: you put down on Beaumont to the
dialog: stewardess. That means paperwork. I
dialog: have to get a death certificate,
dialog: present it to the court, fill out a

dialog: collateral, then type up another

speaker_heading: ORDELL

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What's your brand?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: JACKIE

dialog: years. Does that sound right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I'd say if you're tried and found
dialog: guilty you won't get more than a year
dialog: and a day. That's State time. Prison.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (under her breath)
dialog: Shit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: But they won't want to take you to
dialog: trial. They'll offer you simple
dialog: Possession, a few months of County

dialog: (pointing to her drink)
dialog: How 'bout another?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Sure.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You know who put the dope in your

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Yeah, but that's not what this was
dialog: about. They were fuckin waitin' for
dialog: my ass. They knew I had that money,
dialog: they even knew the amount. The one
dialog: who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D.,
text: Dargus, hardly even looked at it.
dialog: "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand
dialog: here. What would you say?" But all
dialog: they could do was threaten me and
dialog: hand me over to Customs, and I could
dialog: tell they didn't want to do that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: They wanted you to tell them what you
dialog: know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I had 'em too. I burnt those two

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What did they want to know?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Who gave me the money and who I was
dialog: giving it to. And some guy they found

speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: That would be Beaumont Livingston.

speaker_heading: JACKIE

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I wrote him on Monday. They found him

speaker_heading: JACKIE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Same as you. Ten thousand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: The federal agent kinda half hinted
dialog: Ordell might of done Beaumont.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D.,
dialog: but you didn't mention the Federal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I didn't?

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No, you didn't. What branch?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE

dialog: 
text: Max puts it together.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: He's the one who wants you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: It was the other guy who busted me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: 'Cause if he busted you, you'd play
dialog: hell bonding out of federal court. He
dialog: doesn't want you mad at him, he wants
dialog: you to tell him what you know. He
dialog: uses you to get a line on Ordell,
dialog: make a case, then take him federal.
dialog: You know what Ordell's into?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I have a pretty good idea. Ordell
dialog: aint no bootlegger and I doubt he's
dialog: smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only
dialog: leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would
dialog: be interested in.
dialog: 
text: Jackie waits a moment before answering, weighs things in
text: her mind and makes a decision.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I used to bring over ten thousand at
dialog: a time. That's the legal limit, so I
dialog: never brought more than that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: How many trips did you make?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: With ten thousand? Nine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: He's got that kinda money?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico
dialog: bank. But he's got a problem. He's -
dialog: what do you call it when you got
dialog: money, but don't have cash?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Cash poor?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on
dialog: me till I finally said okay. I'll
dialog: bring whatever fits in a nine-by-
dialog: twelve envelope. I got paid five
dialog: hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr.
dialog: Walker, in Mexico gave me the
dialog: envelope.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: If you knew bringing anything over
dialog: ten thousand was against the law, why
dialog: not pack a hundred grand?
dialog: 
text: Jackie gets exasperated.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Whatever it was had to fit in my bag
dialog: and not hit you in the face if the
dialog: bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my
dialog: problem. I gotta figure out a way to
dialog: either keep my job or get out of
dialog: trouble. I'm of today, but if I can't
dialog: leave the country I'm out of a job.
dialog: And if I don't got a job, I can't
dialog: hire a lawyer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Ask A.T.F. They might give you
dialog: permission.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Yeah, if I cooperate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're
dialog: gonna have to give 'em something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's
dialog: name - I don't really know shit about
dialog: what he does or how he does it - That
dialog: don't give me much to bargain with.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL

text: While Johnny Cash continues crooning, Ordell puts on his

text: inside the complex, Ordell passes us and WE FOLLOW BEHIND
text: HIM, up to Jackie's ground-floor apartment door.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: For what?

speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: Who you think got your ass outta

speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: Oh, shit. I bet it was that present
dialog: Mr. Walker was sending Melanie.
dialog: Yaaaah, he's the one musta put it in
dialog: there if you didn't. Oh, man, that
dialog: shit's uncalled for, baby, and I
dialog: apologize. I 'magine they asked you a
dialog: shitload of questions about it, huh?
dialog: All that money, want to know where
dialog: you got it?
dialog: 
text: Jackie doesn't answer. She just walks up to Ordell
text: handing him his yellow drink in the darkness. Ordell
text: takes it, continues to look at Jackie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL (CONT'D)
dialog: I'magine they asked who you givin' it
dialog: to, too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: They asked.

speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: And what was your answer?

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.

speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: You positive about that? You weren't

dialog: 
text: Jackie says to his face;
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You're not asking the right

dialog:

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Beaumont Livingston.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: I knew it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: Yeah?

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I didn't tell 'em anything.

speaker_heading: ORDELL

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, that's mighty honorable of you.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL (CONT'D)
dialog: This fella Beaumont, they say what

speaker_heading: JACKIE

text: driving home in his Seville.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX IN CAR
dialog: 
text: Max drives home, an almost moony romantic look no his
text: face. He can't stop thinking about Jackie. During the
text: night she'd have a gleam in her eyes, the look saying;
text: "WE COULD HAVE FUN". Unless she was appraising kinda him
dialog: with the look, making a judgment and what it said was; "I

scene_heading: ORDELL AND JACKIE

speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: Yeah, somebody musta been real mad at

speaker_heading: ORDELL

speaker_heading: JACKIE

text: Except it's day. Jackie in a bathrobe steps into FRAME

dialog: visitor;
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You want your gun, don't you? Come
dialog: in. I'll go get it.
dialog: 
text: She leaves FRAME, and Max enters it, closing the door
text: behind him. Max stands by the door, a little surprised
text: and a touch pissed at the nonchalantness.
dialog: 
text: As he stands on the threshold to her living room, waiting
text: for her to return with the gun, feeling foolish, he
text: thinks about hauling her ass back to the stockade.
dialog: That'll change her expression, he'd bet.
dialog: 
text: She returns from the bedroom, gun in hand, wearing a sort
text: of sad smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Max, I'm sorry. I was afraid if I
dialog: asked to borrow it you'd say no.
dialog: You'd have to. Would you like some
dialog: coffee?
dialog: 
text: Then, as quickly as the anger rose in Max, it dissipates

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: If you're having some.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I am. Have a seat.
dialog: 
text: Jackie head to the kitchen, making the coffee. Max sits
text: at the dining table off of the kitchen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You get a chance to use it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I felt a lot safer having it. My milk
dialog: went bad when I was in jail.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Black's fine.
dialog: 
text: She puts a finger in the coffeemaker and starts scooping
dialog: coffee in it.

speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Thanks, but I have my own now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You went out this morning and bought

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: What, I couldn't hear you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You went out this morning and bought

dialog: 
text: Pouring water into the coffee machine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Let's just say I got one, okay?
dialog: 
text: She turns on the coffeemaker.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Somebody loan it to you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Yeah.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Max's eyes follow her to the living room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Want to hear some music?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Sure.
dialog: 
text: Jackie ends her knees and goes through a stack of records
text: leaned up against the wall on the floor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I couldn't wait till I got home last
dialog: night and wash my hair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: It looks nice.
dialog: 
text: She finds a record, takes it out of the pile, removes the
text: album from the sleeve, and places it on her stereo
text: turntable.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: You never got into the whole CD
dialog: revolution?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I got a few. But I can't afford to
dialog: start all over again. I got too much
dialog: time and money invested in my
dialog: records.
dialog: 
text: The song starts; it's an old romantic soul music number
dialog: from the early seventies.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah, but you can't get new stuff on
dialog: records.
dialog: 
text: Jackie picks up her cigarettes off the coffee table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I don't buy new stuff that often.
dialog: 
text: Jackie enters the kitchen door frame by Max. She lights a
text: cigarette and stands.
dialog: 
text: Max listens to the soul song.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: This is pretty.

speaker_heading: JACKIE

speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: JACKIE

speaker_heading: MAX

dialog: 
text: They listen for a moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I called in sick this morning. As far
dialog: as the airline knows, I'm still
dialog: available.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I don't know yet. 'm going to talk
dialog: with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do
dialog: what you suggested. Offer to help and
dialog: see what happens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What I meant was have a lawyer do the
dialog: negotiating for you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I want to talk to them first. I know
dialog: more now about Ordell's money.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one
dialog: who wants you, that'll only interest
text: him up to a point.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: It's a lot of money. About a half-a-
dialog: million dollars. All of it in Cabo in
text: safe deposit boxes and more comin in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: How'd you find that out?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: He told me last night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: He called you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: He came by.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What?... What'd you do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: We talked.
dialog: 
text: Jackie goes back in the kitchen. Coffee's almost there,
text: but not quite. She pulls down two mugs from a cabinet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE (CONT'D)
dialog: He had his doubts at first. But he's
dialog: always trusted me an wants more than
dialog: anything to believe he still can.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: He needs me. Without me all that
dialog: money is just gonna sit over there in
dialog: Cabo. Sugar?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No thanks. There's gotta be other
dialog: ways to get it out.
dialog: 
text: She pours the coffee.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Maybe, but 'm the only one he's ever
dialog: used. He can't trust his other
dialog: people. They're crooks. He can try
dialog: bringing I in himself, but Ordell
dialog: sure don't want to go through no
dialog: Customs line. Either he recruits
dialog: another Cabo stewardess, or he
dialog: continues to trust me. I made him
dialog: feel he still can.
dialog: 
text: Jackie walks to the table with the two coffee mugs and
text: sits down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: How do you get it out?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Same way I been don', but first they
dialog: got to let me go back to work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You're gonna offer to set him up?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck
dialog: 'em.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: It's very possible Ordell's killed
dialog: somebody.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't
dialog: doin' that probation thing again.
dialog: 
text: Max watches her a moment
dialog: 
text: Jackie takes a drink of coffee.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE (CONT'D)
dialog: How do you feel about getting old?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You're not old. You look great.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I'm asking how you feel. Does it
dialog: bother you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: It's not really something I think
dialog: about.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Really?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my
text: hair. It started falling out ten
dialog: years ago. So I did something about
dialog: it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: How'd you feel about it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of
dialog: done it, I did it to feel better
dialog: about myself, and I do. When I look
text: in the mirror it looks like me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: It's different with men.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You know, I can't really feel too
dialog: sorry for you in that department.
dialog: 
text: Jackie smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: In fact, I'd make a bet that except
dialog: possibly for an Afro - you look
dialog: exactly the same as you did at twenty
dialog: nine.
dialog: 
text: Jackie smiles into her coffee.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: My ass ain't the same.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Bigger?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
text: Max smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Nothin wrong with that.
dialog: 
text: Jackie's smile grows bigger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: Does something else worry you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I just feel like I'm always starting
dialog: over. You said how many bonds you
dialog: wrote?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Fifteen thousand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Well, I've flown seven million miles.
dialog: And I've been waitin' on people
dialog: almost twenty years. The best job I
dialog: could get after my bust was Cabo Air,
dialog: which is about the worst job you can
dialog: get in this industry. I make about
dialog: sixteen thousand, with retirement
dialog: benefits , ain't worth a damn. And
dialog: now with this arrest hanging over my
dialog: head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I
dialog: gotta start all over again, but I got
dialog: nothin to start over with. I'll be
dialog: stuck with whatever I can get. And
dialog: that scares me more than Ordell.

speaker_heading: LOUIS

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEALINE
dialog: I never got to know him, really. I

dialog: better than my Japanese.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: That sounds like a problem.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Not really. We didn't have much to
dialog: say to each other anyway. I never got

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I
dialog: ain't goin anywhere near that money.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You don't have to. I told 'em you're
dialog: real careful. You never pick up money
dialog: yourself. You always send someone,
dialog: and I never know who it is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: That's a good idea.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: If you just listen, you'll see it's a
dialog: damn good idea. The first time I do

dialog: hand the ten thousand to someone.

speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: Who?

speaker_heading: JACKIE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: But you don't?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: No, I give it to someone else first.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: And they follow the wrong one
dialog: thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: That's the idea.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: So we need two people, two women.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Can you cover that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: I got the woman covered. Where you
dialog: thinkin' about doin' this?

speaker_heading: JACKIE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: I suppose you see a piece of this for
dialog: yourself?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Well, it's my plan. We're in this
dialog: together.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't
dialog: need me a partner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I ain't your partner, I'm your
dialog: manager. I'm managing to get your
dialog: money out of Mexico, into America, in
dialog: your hands, and I'm managing to do
dialog: all this under the nose of the cops.
dialog: That makes me your manager, and
dialog: managers get fifteen percent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: Managers get ten percent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: That's an agent. Manager's get
dialog: fifteen percent.

speaker_heading: ORDELL

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You don't actually do it that way?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: He always just picked it up at my
dialog: place. But with A.T.F. involved, I
dialog: want to stage it. You know, make it
dialog: look more intriguing, like we know
dialog: what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's
text: up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T. F. guy to
text: follow the shopping bag.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Make the delivery somewhere in the

speaker_heading: JACKIE

speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Yeah, we were goin' over everything.
dialog: That's why all the bags.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I called you last night.

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I know, I got your message. Ray
dialog: wanted to have dinner. He wanted to
dialog: talk about the sting we're plotting.
dialog: That's what he calls it. A sting.
dialog: He's being real nice to me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You think he's got a thing for you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be
dialog: something like he wants the money for
dialog: himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I don't follow your logic. What does
dialog: his being nice to you have to do with
dialog: him wanting Ordell's money?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: He's setting me up to make a
dialog: proposition.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I see.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You don't propose something like that
dialog: unless you're pretty sure the other
dialog: person's into it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Has he hinted around?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Not really. But I knew this narcotics
dialog: cop one time. Told me that in a raid,
dialog: the whole package never gets back to
text: the station. His exact words.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You know some interesting people.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: We weren't bullshittin' either,
dialog: 'cause later he was suspended and
dialog: forced to retire.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Has Nicolet told you any colorful
dialog: stories like that?
dialog: 
text: She shakes her head "no."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
text: He tries to act cool.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No harm in that. He's a young guy
dialog: havin' fun being a cop. I know the
dialog: type, trust me on this. He's more
dialog: interested in Ordell than the money.
dialog: If he's gonna do anything suspect,
dialog: it'll be cutting corners to get the
dialog: conviction; but he wouldn't walk off
dialog: with the money. It's evidence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: What about you Max?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: No, I mean you, right now. Not it you
dialog: were somebody else.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: If I saw a way to walk off with a
dialog: shopping bag full of money, would I
dialog: take it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You know where it came from. It's not
dialog: like it's anybody's life savings. It
dialog: wouldn't even be missed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: A half-a-million dollars will always
dialog: be missed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You're avoiding the question.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Okay, sure. I might be tempted.
dialog: Especially now, since I'm getting out

speaker_heading: JACKIE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I'll be over here. You're too
dialog: conspicuous.
dialog: 
text: Louis looks over at the fitting room. Jackie is going
text: inside it, and the saleswoman is walking away towards

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Goddammit, not till I tell ya.

text: staring at him across the floor. Max smiles and gives
text: Louis a wave before turning his back to him and continues
dialog: to do what he was doing.
dialog: 
text: He quickly looks around the store to see anything else;
dialog: any more surprise guests, possible police surveillance.
text: Everything looks normal. The saleswoman is behind the
text: register ringing up Jackie's purchase. The few customers
dialog: there are doing customer stuff.
dialog: 
text: Then he sees Melanie come out with a Robinson's/May bag
text: and head down a different aisle.
dialog: 
text: He hurries down his aisle and cuts her off. Their whole
text: fight is said tense and low.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What are you doin'?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I'm getting out of here. What do you

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Lemme have the bag.

speaker_heading: MELANIE

speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the

speaker_heading: LOUIS

speaker_heading: MELANIE

speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Fuck you with your chill pill.
dialog: 
text: In mid-walk, Melanie asks him;
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Remember where we came in?
dialog: 
text: Louis stops dead. He looks around, confused.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MELANIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (like a teacher on Romper
dialog: Room)
dialog: Nooo, that's towards Sears. We came
dialog: in through Bullocks. I know where it

dialog: 
text: Pissed, he leaves FRAME. Melanie, wearing her Melanie

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY
dialog: 
text: Louis, clutching the shopping bag close to his chest,
text: walks rapidly down an aisle of parked cars.
dialog: 
text: Melanie follows close behind.
dialog: 
text: We STEDICAM alongside. We walk for awhile, Louis changes
text: direction to another aisle. WE'RE NOW IN FRONT of him. We
text: see he has a searching look on his face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: You have no idea where you parked, do
dialog: you?
dialog: 
text: Louis doesn't answer.
dialog: 
text: Melanie laughs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MELANIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus, but if you two aren't the
dialog: biggest fuck-ups I've ever seen in my
dialog: life... How did you ever rob a bank?
dialog: When you robbed banks, did you have
dialog: to look for your car then too? No
dialog: wonder you went to jail.
dialog: 
dialog: Louis could kill her right now. Just take his gun out of
text: his pants and shoot her in her snickering face. But
text: instead of doing what he wants, he does what he should.
text: He doesn't answer of look back. (If he looked back and
dialog: saw that Melanie-smirk, he couldn't e responsible for
text: what happens.)He changes directions, cuts down another
text: aisle and hopes for both their sakes she shuts the fuck
dialog: up.
dialog: 
dialog: But our Melanie just keeps on being Melanie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MELANIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Yeah, down the end.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: You sure?
dialog: 
dialog: They walk it; it's not it.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MELANIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Is it this aisle or the next one
dialog: over?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: This one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: You sure?
dialog: 
text: In between two cars, Louis spins on her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Don't say anything else, okay? I'm
dialog: telling you, keep your mouth shut.
dialog: 
text: Melanie was surprised by the spin, but is about to say
text: something anyway when Louis put his hand up and says;
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I mean it. Don't say one fuckin'
dialog: word.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Okay, Lou-is.
dialog: 
dialog: That did it!
dialog: 
text: Louis whips out the Beretta Ordell gave him, shoots
text: her... BAM... in the belly.
dialog: 
text: She bounces OFF one of the cars and goes down.
dialog: 
text: BAM... Louis shoots her again on the ground.
dialog: 
dialog: One; to make sure. Two; cause it felt good.
dialog: 
text: Then he hurries of for his car. WE FOLLOW IN FRONT OF
text: HIM. He looks around, then yells out;
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: See, just where I fuckin' said it
dialog: was!
dialog: 
text: He hops in the car, and throws it into reverse.
dialog: 
text: We can se Melanie's bare legs sticking out from a row of
text: cars. Louis stops the Toyota alongside the dead Melanie,

speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Hey, look. I found it!

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALESGIRL
dialog: Can I show you something?
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: (low)
dialog: And away we go.
dialog: 
text: Jackie looks at her reflection in the mirror. Then she
text: lifts her eyes, meeting Max's across the room. Max gives

text: and breaks contact, turning to Amy. We hear her say from
text: a distance. "This looks pretty good on me."
dialog: 
text: Max hears a commotion behind him and turns to see Louis
text: and Melanie hurriedly making their way towards Designer

dialog:

dialog: 
text: He sees Louis and Melanie squabbling.
dialog: 
text: He sees Jackie disappear into the fitting room.
dialog: 
text: He sees Amy leaving the fitting room entrance.
dialog: 
text: He watches Melanie, by herself, watch Amy leave. Melanie
text: watches the fitting room for a few moments. Gathering her
text: courage, then makes her move, entering the fitting room.
dialog: 
text: Max smiles to himself, "so far so good" he thinks. He
text: throws a look towards Louis, only to see Louis staring
text: dead at him with an unhappy look on his face. Max returns

dialog: 
text: Max continues his fake browsing.
dialog: 
text: He sees Melanie come out of the fitting room carrying a

dialog: 
text: She and Louis disappear.
dialog: 
text: He sees Jackie come out of the fitting room, go over to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Oh, somebody left a shopping bag in
text: there. Looks like beach towels.
dialog: 
text: She's gone.
dialog: 
text: Amy is left alone by the cashier counter.
dialog: 
text: It's Max's turn.
dialog: 
text: As Max looks at Amy, then at the fitting room entrance,
dialog: he says to himself;
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Max, old boy. You've spent nineteen
dialog: years dealing with people who take
dialog: incredible risks. You walk over to
dialog: that counter, you're gonna find out
dialog: what it's like.
dialog: 
text: Max takes a few moments...
dialog: 
text: ... then walks over to Amy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Excuse me, but my wife thinks she
text: left a bag of beach towels in the
dialog: fitting room?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Yeah, I think they're back there. Go
dialog: get 'em. There's nobody in there. I
dialog: think they're in the last stall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 
text: Max walks toward the fitting room, enters it, walks down
text: the length of stalls, and stops in front of the last one.
dialog: 
text: He opens the door to the stall. Sitting in the corner is
text: the Robinson's/May bag. He walks over to it, lifts out
text: the towels, and sees all that money. He replaces the

text: Designer Clothes, passes by Amy, says;
dialog:

dialog: drop in on him. He'll no doubt be
dialog: surprised to see me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: He's liable to shoot you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: On the phone I told him I have the
dialog: ten thousand he put up for your bond.
dialog: I could bring the money and the
text: papers for him to sign. Walk out and
dialog: call the Sheriff's department.
dialog: 
text: Jackie gets off the bed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Ray wants him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Everybody wants him, he's a homicide
dialog: suspect. It doesn't matter who brings
dialog: him in, he's gonna name you as an
dialog: accessory.
dialog: 
text: Jackie lights up a Davidoff.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the
dialog: case. I'm their witness. They
dialog: wouldn't have a case without me. If
dialog: it's his word against mine, who are
dialog: they gonna believe?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: It's not that simple.
dialog: 
text: Phone in one hand, smoke in the other, Jackie begins
text: pacing back and forth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: It never was, so I'm not gonna start
dialog: worrying about it now. Look, Ray more
dialog: or less believes my story, and he
dialog: more or less doesn't care. All he
dialog: really gives a shit about is getting
dialog: Ordell.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Get Ordell to come to your office.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Set him up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Uh-huh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Tell him you want to see him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Tell him I want to give him his
dialog: money.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I've chickened out. I'm afraid of
dialog: him. He'll like that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What do you tell Nicolet?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Ordell called and wants to meet me
dialog: and I'm scared.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: We get Ordell to come to my office.
dialog: Nicolet - is he already there, or
dialog: does he come busting in while we're
dialog: chatting?
dialog: 
text: Jackie takes a drag.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
text: He's already there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You want your money? Your bond

speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: ORDELL

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Uh-huh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: Well, give it to me then.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: She wants to give it to you herself
dialog: and collect her ten percent. She also
dialog: wants to explain why she had to hold
dialog: on to it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: I'd like to hear that too. Turn
dialog: around and put your hands on your
dialog: head.
dialog: 
text: Max does this, Ordell pats him down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd
dialog: already tried to get Jackie to go in
dialog: with her, split the half million
dialog: amongst themselves. What she did was
dialog: take quite a risk to see you get your
dialog: money.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: All I did was walk out with it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: And you did that to protect my
dialog: interest?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: In a way, yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: My ass be dumb, but I'm not a
dialog: dumbass. Go sit over there on the
dialog: couch.
dialog: 
dialog: Max does.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: This place stinks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: You get used to it after a while. Now

speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: And where's Jackie?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: ORDELL

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: She was afraid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: That I gotta see.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: She still is. She doesn't want to get
dialog: shot before she can tell you what
dialog: happened.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: Have her bring the money here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
text: It's in the safe. She can't get at

speaker_heading: MAX

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: You expect me to just walk in there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: If she wanted to set you up, you'd be
dialog: in custody right now. When you said
dialog: you'd name her as an accessory she
dialog: believed you. That scares her more
dialog: than anything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORDELL
dialog: That's why she's givin' up my money
dialog: huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie.
dialog: I didn't trust her ass neither, but I
dialog: knew how to handle her. She was my
dialog: blonde-headed little surfer gal. I
dialog: fuckin' told Louis he could've just
text: given her a punch in the mouth, he
dialog: didn't need to shoot her. She's at
dialog: your office.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
