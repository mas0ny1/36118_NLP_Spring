dialog: "FREQUENCY" -- by Toby Emmerich
dialog: The Child is the Father of the Man.
dialog: - William Wordsworth
dialog: ...the theory of black holes was developed before there was
dialog: any indication from observations that they actually existed.
dialog: I do not know of any other example in science where such a
dialog: great extrapolation was successfully made solely on the basis
dialog: of thought. It shows the remarkable power and depth of
dialog: Einstein's theory. There is still much we don't know, such
dialog: as what happens to objects and information that fall into a
dialog: black hole. Do the reemerge elsewhere in the Universe, or in
dialog: another universe? And can we warp space and time so much
dialog: that one can travel back in time? Maybe someone will come
dialog: back from the future and tell us.

scene_heading: EXT. MANHATTAN BRIDGE - PREDAWN - 1969
text: Darkness. Headlights bounce off thick sheets of RAIN. 6,500
text: gallon Esso OIL TRUCK barrels over wet studded pavement,
text: heading towards Manhattan. It's going fast. Too fast.
text: Up ahead...at the BASE OF THE BRIDGE:
text: A large reflective sign - lit up by arc lights: MEN AT WORK.
text: There are TWO WORK CREWS, several hundred feet apart.
text: THE FIRST CREW is CON ED. A corrugated vacuum tube feeds
text: into an open MANHOLE. A WORKER drops into the hole.
text: THE SECOND CREW is CONSTRUCTION. They're at the apron of the
text: bridge securing lumber supports for the roadbed.
text: It's late and the men are tired. A mistake is made. A FORK
text: LIFT loaded with LUMBER fails to negotiate a turn...whacks
text: into an abutment... spilling its load onto the roadway.
text: Bad timing, because right now that Esso OIL TRUCK hits the
text: OFF RAMP. Not a lot of time for the driver to react to a
text: roadway spewed with lumber.
text: He does his best. Slams the brakes, spins the wheel, hits
text: the horn, but it doesn't matter: 18 wheels skid across the
text: blacktop - spitting thick smoke and burnt rubber, lifting off
text: the slick pavement...twisting...flipping...hemorrhaging oil
text: from its ruptured tanks...grinding its way towards...
text: MEN AT WORK. Seconds to react as an 80,000 pound juggernaut
text: of death plows through parked cars like paper...crushing the
text: Con Ed equipment...lurching to a halt on top of the MANHOLE.

text: FRANK SULLIVAN, 40, is strapped into an open-air jumper seat.
dialog: A real life hard charger, Frank is the kind of iron's man
dialog: fire fighters want coming in after them, should they get
text: caught in harm's way. Kind-hearted and hard-fisted, he has
text: the grace and courage of a man living by his convictions.
text: Across from Frank sits GRAHAM GIBSON, 20. A good-looking
dialog: African-American, "Gib" is a Fire Fighter Fourth Grade, a
text: tank man... and one nervous probie.
text: Through a window into the CAB, we SEE LT. BUTCH FOSTER, 50,
text: on a walkie-talkie. A beefy old pro who's been through more

text: A walkie-talkie sits in a cradle between Frank and Gibson.
speaker_heading: BUTCH'S VOICE
dialog: (through walkie-talkie)

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hey, Rookie. Be cool. Just stay with

speaker_heading: GIBSON
dialog: (still tapping his watch)
dialog: I seem nervous, huh?
text: Frank laughs. Gibson grins, relaxes a bit. Frank checks his

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's 5:30, Gib.
speaker_heading: BUTCH'S VOICE
dialog: (through walkie talkie)
text: ...two Con Ed men trapped in an

text: Frank's eyes harden. His game face sets up.
scene_heading: EXT. MANHATTAN BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
text: A tableau of impending danger. Thick black OIL bleeds from
text: teh truck onto the street...pouring underneath the rig...and
speaker_heading: into the MANHOLE.
text: POLICE urgently cordon off the area, evacuating the workers.
text: EMERGENCY PERSONNEL deal with the badly injured TRUCK DRIVER.
text: Firemen wedge sandbags between the hull of the truck and the
text: three-quarters covered manhole -- trying to divert the oil
text: away from the underground vault.
text: FIRE COMMANDER O'CONNELL yells at his men to finish the job
dialog: and get the hell away.
text: The BIG TRUCKS ARRIVE. PUMPER ENGINE and Frank's LADDER
text: TRUCK -- rapidly guided into position by men on the ground.
text: Frank, Gibson, Butch and the rest of the unit are on the
text: ground instantly and ready for orders. They are looking at a

text: FIRE COMMANDER O'CONNELL and a CON ED SUPERVISOR approach.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: (deep irony)
dialog: A fun one.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: COMMANDER
dialog: We got high voltage cables ripped loose
text: in the underground. They hit water, that
dialog: fault's gonna arc.
text: Frank looks at the tanker over the manhole. There is now
dialog: nobody around it.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Why haven't they killed the juice?
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
text: Switches are shorted out.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You're shitting me!
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
dialog: Wish I was. Oldest part of the system
dialog: down there. We're on it, but it's gonna
dialog: take awhile.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We gotta go underground. Get those guys
dialog: out, now.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
text: We tried. Bulkhead door's rusted shut.
dialog: Won't budge.
speaker_heading: COMMANDER
dialog: The block is being evacuated. I don't
dialog: want anybody... including our
dialog: boys...within fifty yards of that
dialog: tanker...it's a fucking bomb.
text: Frank has been staring at the capsized rig.
text: Butch knows what he's thinking. But it's too late. Frank is
text: gone...slogging through the oozing oil to the hull of the
text: tanker. He kneels over the three-quarters covered manhole,
text: using a flashlight to peer into the darkness below. Sparks
text: from the loose cables spit off flashes of light as the cables
text: hiss and slap against the ceiling and walls of the vault.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: This is the Fire Department. Frank
dialog: Sullivan. You guys okay?
scene_heading: CON ED WORKER #1'S VOICE
dialog: Please man, you gotta get us out of

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: That's exactly what we're gonna do.

speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: (yells to Con Ed Supervisor)
dialog: How do we get to the vault door?
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
text: There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.
speaker_heading: BUTCH'S VOICE
dialog: Forget it, Frank. No way you reach those
dialog: men in time.
text: Frank grabs a "halaghan claw tool" and a walkie-talkie.
text: Gibson nervously picks out two helmet lights...and they are
text: off and running.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (yelling back)
dialog: I can do it, Butch. Me and my 'tank man'
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: COMMANDER O'CONNELL
dialog: (to all, and into walkie)
dialog: Start spraying down the street. Let me
dialog: know when we are fully evacuated.
scene_heading: EXT. MANHOLE - CANAL & BOWERY - CONTINUOUS
text: Frank uses the "adz" to rip open the heavy manhole cover.
scene_heading: INT. MANHOLE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
text: Frank and Gibson descend into the tunnel, strap lights on
text: their leather helmets to illuminate the damp darkness. They
text: race down the subterranean passage. The stench is thick.
text: Butch's voice suddenly booms out of the walkie-talkie:
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: (via walkie)
dialog: Frank, you hear me? Frank?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (into walkie)
dialog: Yeah, Butch?
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: (via walkie)
text: The gas level is getting serious.
dialog: The underground's combustible - it could
dialog: flashover. I want you to abort! Now!
dialog: Get the hell out of there!
text: Frank picks up the pace. Charges ahead. Guy's got balls.
speaker_heading: GIBSON
dialog: (into walkie)
dialog: Frank. We gotta go back. Frank...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (calling back to him)
dialog: Stay with me, Gib. We're gonna do this.
speaker_heading: GIBSON
dialog: (charging after him)
dialog: I should'a been a fucking mailman.
text: Frank reaches the rusted 'submarine-like' VAULT DOOR. Pounds
text: on the door... a faint response. He goes to work on it with
text: the halaghan tool. Gibson arrives...pretty rattled. Frank
text: gives him a wink and a smile. It's gonna be okay.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: (via walkie)
dialog: Frank, where are you?
text: Frank digs down, suddenly the DOOR GIVES WAY
text: Oil and water rush from the VAULT, pouring over Frank and
text: Gibson, foaming into the tunnel. But the door is mounted
text: three feet off the ground. There is still three feet of oil
text: and water trapped inside. And the smell of gas is now
dialog: overwhelming...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (into walkie)
dialog: We're in, Butch.
text: Frank probes the dark vault with the FLASHLIGHT BLADE.
text: Through smoke we see TWO MEN huddled in the corner, trapped
text: by three loose 'HOT' CABLES - WHIPPING AROUND THE TINY VAULT
text: LIKE AN ELECTRIC HYDRA. Con Ed Worker #2 shivers, ankle
text: broken, leaning on older Con Ed Worker #1.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Time to go home, fellas.
text: Gibson sprays the room, clearing out most of the smoke.
text: Frank steps into the vault.
speaker_heading: CON ED WORKER #1
dialog: Careful. If the hot end of those cables
dialog: hits you, it'll conduct to the water and
dialog: we're all fired.
text: Frank drops to his knees, ducking under the cables, shuffles
text: to center of the vault. Places his hands at opposite ends of
text: the halaghan tool, hoping for the cables to pass directly
text: over his head. A hairy beat, then...
text: Frank jackknifes out of the water, ramming the halaghan into
text: the ceiling. It worked. The teeth on the "claw-end" and the
text: spike on the "adz-end" are embedded into the concrete --
text: STAPLING THE CABLES TO THE CEILING. Make that balls of
dialog: steel.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Go, Gibby! Everybody move it.
dialog: Gibson and Con Ed worker #1 help injured Worker #2 out of the
text: vault. Frank checks to make sure they've cleared the vault
text: and lets go of the tool.
text: Frank jumps into the tunnel, hoists the injured worker over
text: his back and races back down the tunnel.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Gibson)
dialog: Haul ass, that claw ain't gonna hold for
dialog: long...

scene_heading: INT./EXT. MANHOLE - CANAL & BOWERY - CONTINUOUS
text: Frank, Gibson and the Con Ed men scramble towards the
text: manhole. Butch and another fireman are waiting up top. They
text: help the men -- who are covered in oil and slime -- up onto
text: the street. And then they all tear away from the
text: manhole...around a corner... collapsing on the pavement
text: against a building.
scene_heading: K-A-B-O-O-M -- A MUFFLED EXPLOSION
text: The vault ignites, the tunnel "FLASHBACKS" -- a towering
text: geyser of FLAMES AND DIRT ERUPTING out of the manhole from
text: which Frank has just escaped.
text: In the distance, FLAMES erupt out of the other
text: manhole...engulfing the OIL TRUCK...blowing it into a million
dialog: pieces.
text: Through the INFERNO at the base of the Manhattan Bridge,
text: Frank can see that no one is hurt. His eyes glistening with
text: adrenaline and relief, he sits back against the building and
text: throws an arm around Gibson.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You did good, Gib. Real good.
text: Frank looks over at the hyperventilating Butch and smiles.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
text: Elvis has left the building.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - MORNING
text: Inside the tunnel. Dark. Moving fast. Flashes of LIGHT

text: We are with Frank, wearing a leather jacket with the insignia
text: of his fire-fighting unit emblazoned on it, and a New York
text: Mets BASEBALL CAP pulled down tight, as he rockets his
text: chopper through traffic, out of the tunnel, and up into...
scene_heading: EXT. QUEENS - STREETS - CONTINUOUS
text: CREDIT MONTAGE begins as Frank cruises home. It has STOPPED

text: He circles a LITTLE LEAGUE ball field waving to some
speaker_heading: OLDSTERS.
scene_heading: EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - QUEENS - CONTINUOUS
text: Frank glides the Harley alongside his house. A feisty
text: DALMATIAN PUPPY ELVIS barks his welcome from behind a fence.
text: Feeling fatigued, Frank dismounts and enters teh backyard,
text: playing for a moment with Elvis while he uprights a TRAINING
text: BICYCLE, tidies up BASEBALL EQUIPMENT, and glances up at a
text: HAM RADIO ANTENNA secured to the roof, before entering
text: through a backdoor. There is a sense of routine to all this.
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: The kitchen is empty. Breakfast dishes in the sink. Frank
text: flips on the RADIO. It plays out under the rest of the
text: MONTAGE as coverage of the oil truck crash blends into other
dialog: news stories.
text: A note on the refrigerator reads: 8:15. Hey, Bud. I'm off
dialog: to work. Johnny's at school. Elvis is fed. I luvs you.
text: Setting a grapefruit and a slice of toast on the table, Frank
text: glances at the Daily News. But his eyes are tired, he stares
text: off into space...letting go.
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - MASTER BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: A radio in the bedroom is tuned to sports news. Frank soaks

dialog: does.
scene_heading: CREDITS END.
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
text: CRASH! A SOFTBALL BLOWS through the window from the
text: BACKYARD, landing on the rug next to the bed. Frank bolts
text: awake, staring at the busted window.
text: He checks the clock. It is 5:15. He steps to the broken
text: window. SEVERAL SMALL BOYS scurry from the yard. Two
text: others, JOHNNY SULLIVAN and GORDO HERSCH, both 6, stand
text: frozen in place. Elvis tears in circles around them. All is
text: very quiet. Then, from somewhere beyond the bedroom door, we

text: Frank, wearing FDNY sweats, moves into the kitchen flipping

text: her eyes at the sight of the ball. Say no more.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hey, bud.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Hey, bud.
text: Without breaking stride, he gives her a smack on the lips and
text: steps to the screen door to the back porch.
scene_heading: EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS
text: Johnny stands nervously outside the door. Elvis sits at his
text: side. Gordo watches from the safety of his own porch next

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Looks like two weeks worth of allowance,
dialog: Chief.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I know. Sorry, Dad.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Glad to hear that.
text: And Frank drops the softball into Johnny's mitt, closes the
text: screen door and turns back into the kitchen. Johnny turns
text: away into the yard.
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: With a shrug, and sharing a kids will be kids smile with
text: Julia, he grabs a cold Rheingold from the refrigerator and
dialog: heads into...
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (calling to Julia)
dialog: How about a little of the King?
speaker_heading: JULIA (O.S.)

scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - KITCHEN
text: Suddenly, a PAN of spaghetti sauce bubbles over.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Damn.
speaker_heading: FRANK (O.S.)
dialog: You alright?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I think I ruined the sauce...again.

speaker_heading: JULIA

speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: (singing lyrics)
dialog: Caught in a trap, I can't walk out,
dialog: because I love you too much b-b-baby.
text: We follow the music as it drifts out into the YARD where we
text: can SEE Johnny and Gordo looking in at the weirdness.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: How was your tour?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: The usual.
text: Frank spots Johnny and Gordo staring at them. He winks at

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: (loaded)
dialog: Butch called.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Did he?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: He did.
speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: JULIA

text: Hold on Johnny's eyes...fear.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Okay, start pedaling.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Daddy put the wheels back on. I'm gonna

speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Daddy, I'm scared.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: C'mon, Chief, show some guts.
text: Johnny takes a gulp of air, doesn't want to disappoint his
dialog: father, nods okay.
text: He starts pedaling. Slowly moving forward. Frank holds on
text: to the seat. Frank's still hanging on - jogging along side.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm gonna let go!
text: Frank let's go. Johnny's pumping those little six year-old
text: legs, but he starts to wobble out of control -- CRASH!
text: Johnny starts to cry, quickly gets up and runs back to the
text: house. Julia comes out of the kitchen door. Johnny runs
text: into her arms.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't quit on me now, Chief.
text: Johnny tears himself from Julia's arms, runs inside.
text: Frustrated, Frank lights up another cigarette.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Don't be so tough on him Frank, he's six
dialog: years old.
dialog: (softer)

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: GORDO (O.S.)
dialog: Sully! Is that you?

scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: Meet GORDON HERSCH, 35, computer geek, lovable dough boy.
dialog: Last seen by us in 1969 as a six-year old.
speaker_heading: GORDO
dialog: Hey, Sull. My cable's out again.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What the hell is that smell?
text: John glances at a mound of burnt bacon dripping on the stove.
speaker_heading: GORDO
dialog: Can you believe Ellen still won't let me
dialog: cook in the house? I melt one lousy
dialog: frying pan, y'know?
text: Gordy Jr. scoots into the kitchen.
speaker_heading: GORDY JR.
dialog: John, guess what? Dad's taking me
dialog: fishing. Wanna come?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Wish I could, Gordy. But you bring me
dialog: back a big one.
speaker_heading: GORDO
dialog: Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I think it's somewhere in the closet...
dialog: if you can find it.
text: Gordy Jr. runs out. O.S. sounds of him rummaging through
text: hall closet.
speaker_heading: GORDO
dialog: So Yahoo went up another two points.
dialog: Man, did we miss the boat on that one.
text: John puts the Bushmills bottle down, and grabs two Molsons.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Coulda, woulda, shoulda, pal.
text: John laughs, hands Gordo a beer, and lights up a cigarette.
speaker_heading: GORDO
dialog: Sam called Ellen.
text: John reacts. Nothing else needs to be said. A beat, then...
speaker_heading: GORDO (CONT'D)
dialog: Why don't you come with us? Three days
dialog: of fresh air and barbecue would do you
dialog: some good, man.
speaker_heading: GORDY JR. (O.S.)
dialog: Dad, John, c'mere...
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - ENTRY HALL - CONTINUOUS
text: Gordy Jr. sticks out of the closet, attempting to drag out a
text: large BLACK STEAMER TRUNK, stenciled with yellow letters.
speaker_heading: GORDO
dialog: Hey, Gordy, what 'ya doing?
speaker_heading: GORDY JR.
dialog: Dad, check it out. Fire Department! Can
dialog: I open it up?
text: John thinks about it for a second. Noting the curious glee
text: in little Gordy's face, nods OK.
text: Gordy Jr. pops open the latches, opens the trunk. Gordo
text: crouches down beside his son, checks out the dusty contents.
text: HOLD ON JOHN'S REACTION to what Gordy Jr. finds in the trunk.
speaker_heading: GORDY JR. (CONT'D)
dialog: Wow.
text: Gordy Jr. reaches in and takes out: FDNY HELMET & JACKETS.
text: Briefly puts on the enormous helmet, then sets it aside.
text: Reaches back into the trunk and pulls out the disassembled
text: pieces of a 12 gauge SHOTGUN.
speaker_heading: GORDO
dialog: Hey! Gimmie that!
text: Gordo takes the shotgun from the boy and places it gingerly
text: inside the closet.
text: Simultaneously, Gordy Jr. hands off a leather-bound SCRAPBOOK
text: to John. Before John can react, Gordy Jr. lifts up an
scene_heading: AMATEUR RADIO TRANSCEIVER.
speaker_heading: GORDY JR.
dialog: What's this, Dad?
scene_heading: ANGLE BACK ON JOHN
text: Powerful memories fill his face.
speaker_heading: GORDO
dialog: John, that's your Dad's old ham radio.
dialog: Remember? Remember how we used to beg
dialog: him to let us talk on that thing?
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON
dialog: the transceiver and microphone - mint condition 1965 Yaesu FT
text: 101, and a "Silver Eagle" Astatic D-104 microphone.
speaker_heading: JOHN/GORDO
dialog: This is not a toy.
speaker_heading: GORDY JR.
dialog: Can we try it Dad, can we try it?
text: Gordo looks at John.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What the hell.
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - CONTINUOUS
text: Glass doors separate the study from the family room. The HAM

text: of the radio is a diagram for the radio setup and "QSL"
dialog: cards: certificates from around the world acknowledging
scene_heading: "contact" with "WB2YXB" -- FRANK SULLIVAN, BAYSIDE NY.
text: Gordo hooks up the radio. Gordy Jr. shuts off the TV.
speaker_heading: GORDY JR.
dialog: So this was what people used before the
dialog: Net, huh?
speaker_heading: GORDO
dialog: Man, do I feel old.
text: GORDO TURNS THE RADIO ON. Shows Gordy how it works. Gordy
text: rotates the tuning dial, nothing but "dead bands." STATIC.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It's junk, kid. Nobody uses those things
dialog: anymore.
text: KNOCK. Front door opens. John's head turning around. Meet

speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Gordo, do you know what time it is?
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Hi, John.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Ellen.
text: Ellen notices John's weary look but says nothing. We get the

speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: C'mon Gordy, let's go.
speaker_heading: GORDY JR.
dialog: Oh, mom...
scene_heading: EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Gordo and family pour into the yard between the two houses.
text: John shuffles out behind them. Gordo and Gordy Jr. quickly
text: disappear into their house, but Ellen lingers for a moment -
text: looking back at John standing alone.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: You all right, John?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Oh, yeah.
text: Ellen holds her glance for a moment. John smiles, thinly
text: masking his sadness. Ellen nods okay, and she is gone. John
text: looks up at the stars, then down to the HAM RADIO ANTENNA on
text: his roof, now looking raggedy from 29 years of neglect.
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - LATER
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Hey, Ma, it's me. Checking in. Probably

dialog: night. Love you.
text: John puts down the phone. Stares at the FDNY trunk. He

text: "FIREMAN KILLED IN WAREHOUSE BLAZE"
text: He shoves the paper back in the scrapbook. Puts the album
text: down - he can't deal with those wounds. He glances up at the
dialog: TV:
speaker_heading: LARRY KING
dialog: Is this anomaly connected to the space
dialog: storm and the NASA satellite that
dialog: disappeared in 1969?
speaker_heading: HAWKING
dialog: We don't know. But given the
dialog: similarities of their location and
dialog: appearance, this is a question that
dialog: merits further investigation.
dialog: NOTE: Larry King's show plays for the duration of this
dialog: scene.
text: John settles in, takes off his work shirt. Underneath he has

speaker_heading: FRANK (O.S.)
dialog: CQ 15, come in 15.

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Uh, hello?
speaker_heading: FRANK (O.S.)
dialog: WB2YKXB, who've I got?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (slightly slurred)
dialog: Name's John.
text: In the BACKGROUND of FRANK'S VOICE, we barely hear WALTER

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Look, I don't really remember how this
dialog: thing works.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Listen, you can't broadcast without a

dialog: you gotta get off the band.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: Pal, my whole life's an emergency.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: FRANK
text: 15-band closes down at night. During the
dialog: day you can chew the band with China if

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I can't believe people are still using
dialog: these things.
text: As John releases the squawk bar, the distant sound of Frank's
text: TV filters out of the HAM.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Can you hold on a second?
text: And then John hears the sound of a door closing.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry 'bout that. So Queens, you psyched
dialog: for the Series?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (taking a swig)
dialog: I don't really follow baseball anymore.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I got fed up with all the bullshit.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Fed up? Lemme tell you something, in a
dialog: 1000 years, when school kids study
dialog: America, they're gonna learn about three
dialog: things: the Constitution, Rock 'n' Roll,
dialog: and Baseball.
text: Despite his mood, John has to smile.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: How can you live in Queens and not love
dialog: the Amazin's?
text: John warms to the topic of his boyhood heroes.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: If you're talking The Amazin' Mets, well,
dialog: that's different. You know people talk
dialog: about Seaver, but I'll love Ron Swoboda
dialog: til the day I die.
text: Static crackles out over the radio. The signal weakens.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (through static)
dialog: I'm right with you, man. He's got the
dialog: heart of a lion. Hey, how 'bout the
dialog: first game of the Series?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Yeah. It was all over after Buford
text: nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the
dialog: park.
text: More static.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No way, brother. Ain't gonna happen.
text: BZZZSSSSHHHH - loud static. THE SIGNAL IS GONE.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Who the hell was that?
text: Behind him, on TV, Larry King and Hawking continue talking.
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT - 1969
text: ANOTHER FINGER PRESSING DOWN ON THE RED SQUAWK BAR... FRANK
text: SULLIVAN. Seated at the polished wooden desk.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hello, Queens. You there?
text: Silence. The signal is gone. Frank leans forward, jiggles
text: the frequency dial, trying to regain the signal. No luck.
text: Slightly frustrated, he stands and opens the glass doors to
text: the family room where Julia is watching TV - a very young
text: STEPHEN HAWKING is being interviewed by WALTER CRONKITE, 52.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (a little distracted)
dialog: Sure.
text: He starts to take a step into the room, and stumbles over
text: Elvis, sleeping by the door...KNOCKING INTO and CRACKING a
text: GLASS PANE in one door.
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - 1998
text: John, dog tired and more than a little wasted, gets up from

scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - JOHNNY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1969
text: Frank unpins the police badge from Johnny's shirt, takes the

text: softly kisses Johnny's forehead. You can tell he loves this
dialog: kid more than anything in the world.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (lullaby-like)
dialog: Take me out to the ballgame, take me out

speaker_heading: The LEGEND reads:
scene_heading: OCTOBER 11th - FIRST GAME OF THE WORLD SERIES
text: Blue sky. A SOFTBALL soars into view. It drops down and
text: into a WILLIE MAYS' style basket catch by Frank Sullivan.
scene_heading: EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL FIELD - QUEENS - DAY - 1969
text: The same Little League field that Frank circled on his Harley
dialog: yesterday, October 10, 1969. And the same field at which
dialog: John sat in the stands drinking last night, October 10, 1998.
text: We are in the 9th inning of a friendly SOFTBALL GAME between
text: the local COPS and FIREMEN. A lot of NYPD and FDNY T-shirts,
text: sweats and caps. Plenty of Mets stuff, too.
text: Having made the catch, Frank coolly pulls the ball from his
text: mitt as he starts running toward the infield diamond.
text: Tagging up at 3rd, sorely tempted to try for home is SATCH
text: DELEON, 30, NYPD Detective. Satch feints for the plate,
text: Frank feints the throw. For a maddening, gleeful moment,
text: Frank has Satch caught between 3rd and home.
text: In the STANDS, Johnny Sullivan, Marge Hersch and the FAMILIES
text: of the other ballplayers scream for whomever they want to win
dialog: this game of chicken.
text: On the SIDELINES, Johnny, Gordo and the other KIDS serving as
text: BATBOYS and WATERBOYS, jump around in anticipation.
text: At HOME, Butch Foster stations himself to take the throw.
text: Suddenly, Satch fakes to 3rd, then bolts for home. Frank
text: pegs it to Butch, who tags the sliding Satch. Game over.
speaker_heading: SATCH
dialog: Lucky throw, fire boy.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (jogging in)
dialog: Luck, my ass.
text: They square off. Pretending to fight. Julia steps between
text: them. And they all descend into laughter.
text: Frank and Satch each wrap an arm around Julia and start off.
text: Within a step, Johnny slips in under Frank's other arm.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)

text: at something on the ground.
text: As John exits the car, the passenger door swings open and we
dialog: MEET a guy we haven't seen in 29 YEARS - SATCHEL DELEON, 59.
text: Shaved head, square jaw. A ram-rod straight, craggy warrior.
text: Thirty-plus years on the force now endow him with a rare
dialog: combination of smarts, guts and sense of humor.
speaker_heading: SATCH
dialog: (as they walk)
dialog: Don't choke on your pride, Sull. You
dialog: ain't ever gonna catch another one like
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: She made up her mind. Nothin' I do is
dialog: gonna change it.
speaker_heading: SATCH
dialog: Nothing you're willing to do.
text: Spotting John and Satch, a UNIFORM approaches them. They
dialog: keep on walking.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What's the story?
speaker_heading: UNIFORM
text: Survey crew found a body. Actually a
dialog: skeleton. Over here.
text: The uniform leads John and Satch around some overgrown weeds
text: to SEE a patch of freshly unearthed dirt...out of which
text: sticks a HUMAN SKULL and COLLAR BONE.
text: In the B.G., a CRIME SCENE unit can be seen arriving by van.
speaker_heading: SATCH
dialog: Be real careful when pulling it out. And
dialog: get the dirt around it.
text: As Satch turns to talk to a second UNIFORM and a couple of
text: SURVEYORS, John notices a man raking leaves in a yard not far
text: away. As he starts to him, to Satch:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I think I'll visit the neighbor.
scene_heading: INT. SHEPARD RESIDENCE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Thanks.
text: John looks out the window.
speaker_heading: MR. SHEPARD
dialog: Used to get breakfast there all the time
dialog: back from the boat. Them Greeks were

dialog: up on Dyckman, they lost all their
dialog: business.
text: John glances around the room - notes family PHOTOGRAPHS.
text: There's a picture of Shepard in younger days on a commercial
text: fishing boat. Next to it a faded black and white picture of
text: Mrs. Shepard, 35. A few pictures of the Shepards and their
text: YOUNG SON. And at the end, a color photograph of the same

text: discreetly glances at his watch.
scene_heading: EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - MOMENTS LATER
text: THUNDER in the distance. CRIME SCENE personnel have made
text: some progress in unearthing the skeletal remains. A couple
text: of drops of rain tap the ground and the bones.
text: John stands looking down at the skeleton. A long beat. And
text: then he turns to Satch and they start for the car. Behind
text: them, the skeleton is carefully pulled free from the ground.
text: WE SEE its wrists are BOUND with GLASS TAPE.

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: You work too hard, John.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Look who's talking.

dialog: Julia knows what he's thinking...
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: 29-years tomorrow.
text: A long beat.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I wish I could remember him better.
dialog: Truth is, most of the stuff I know is

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Sun spot?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah, that's how Hams work.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Wait a sec...there was something on the

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Thirty-five? That would make it...

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Yeah...I think so.

text: A death shudder creeps up Frank's spine. And for the first
text: time in his life, Frank Sullivan is SCARED SHITLESS.
text: Frank stares up at the sky, transfixed. THUNDER punches the

text: And in the distance, as if from inside the burning building,
text: a FAINT SCREAMING is first heard, and growing louder.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hear that?
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: What?

text: Frank and Gibson step into the warehouse. Butch behind them.
text: Flames haven't reached this area yet, but the ROAR of the
text: fire above them is deafening, and smoke billows down THE
text: STAIRWAY before them. They sprint towards it and start up.
text: ONE FLOOR. TWO FLOORS. THREE FLOORS, and suddenly they are
text: face to face with a WALL OF FIRE blocking access to the 4th
dialog: floor.
text: Frank and Gibson stop and stare into the inferno.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: It looks open on the other side.
speaker_heading: GIBSON
dialog: Don't know what's behind it.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: One way to find out.
text: And he barrels through the line of fire onto the 4th floor.
text: Gibson starts to do the same when the 5th floor gives way
text: above Frank, sending burning timber and debris cascading
text: around him and cutting off Gibson's route.
text: Now Frank's only way to go is up the stairs toward the 5th
text: floor. He turns to Gibson. Coming up behind him is Butch.
text: Across a gulf of flames Frank yells and waves at them to get
text: the hell out. And then suddenly, part of the 3rd floor
text: around Gibson and Butch starts to go.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: (screaming over fire)
dialog: Get out...while you still can...

scene_heading: INT. BUXTON WAREHOUSE/6TH FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: FRANK

text: A SMALL METAL SWINGING DOOR.
scene_heading: INT. BUXTON WAREHOUSE/CHUTE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: EXT. BUXTON WAREHOUSE/EAST RIVER CANAL - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: GIBSON
dialog: You okay, man?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (starting to giggle)

text: IN on itself, sending flames shooting high into the sky.
text: Frank lies back, floating on the water, the rain pelting

text: CRASH! The GLASS SHATTERS AGAIN! CRASH...CRASH...
text: Camera ratchets into the exploding storm of the flying glass,
text: ice and whiskey. And then time stops as we hold close on a
text: frozen shard - in it, the cracked reflection of John's eye.
text: The camera moves through the reflection and into.
speaker_heading: JOHN'S EYE
text: A burst of light and then...distorted images. Like looking

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No, but we can. We can do it together.
dialog: Spirit and guts, Chief.
text: A long beat. Johnny takes a deep breath, nods OK, slowly
text: getting on the bike. Frank's holding on to the seat.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Take your time. I'm not gonna let go
dialog: 'til you say okay.
text: Johnny takes a gulp of air, starts pedaling. Slowly moving

speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: You ready?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Wait...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I'm right here behind you...
text: Frank's still running alongside, holding on to the seat.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Okay!
text: Frank lets go. Johnny keeps pumping those little six-year

dialog: Johnny's eyes: determination & self-confidence.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (clapping)
dialog: Yes! That's it! You got it, you got it!

speaker_heading: JOHNNY

scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT - 1998
text: John walks in the front door, takes off his coat...
text: The house looks different. Cleaner, furnishings less ragged.
text: John moves through his home, taking in the subtle changes.
text: He reaches the study. And there, beside the desk, is
dialog: something that makes him stop:
text: A PHOTOGRAPH on the wall beside the desk -- FRANK, JULIA &
scene_heading: FOURTEEN YEAR-OLD JOHNNY SULLIVAN.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Oh my God...
text: The picture changed. John aged from 6 to 14. Julia's
dialog: hairstyle and clothes changed from 60's to 70's. Frank's
text: hair receded and grayed. Jon is staring at evidence of a
dialog: history that didn't exist before.
text: John grabs the old family scrapbook he found in Frank's
text: trunk. Opens it, unfolds "FIREMAN KILLED" CLIPPING.
scene_heading: The main headline still reads: "OCTOBER 13, 1969. AMAZIN'S
scene_heading: TAKE GAME 2. 2-1 LEAD. SEE SPORTS."
text: But the sub headline now reads: "FIREMAN RESCUES RUNAWAY FROM
speaker_heading: INFERNO"
text: John turns, stares at the radio questioningly. He starts to
text: sit down at the desk when he spots something on the front
text: edge of it. WORDS CARVED INTO THE WOOD, 29 YEARS AGO by fire
dialog: fighter Frank Sullivan. The day John saved his father's
dialog: life: I'M STILL HERE CHIEF
text: The last letter is missing. But then a patch of wood starts
text: to morph - as if it were being carved by an invisible knife.
text: A BURST OF STATIC. RADIO CRACKLES TO LIFE.
speaker_heading: FRANK (O.S.)
dialog: (through radio)
dialog: ...can you hear me?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

dialog: Dad...?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Chief?! Is that you?
scene_heading: INTERCUT FRANK AND JOHN
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Yeah, it's me.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You're the voice of an angel, Johnny. If

text: Frank cuts himself off in mid-sentence.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Dad, you there? You okay?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah. I'm okay.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What about you? I want to know. About
dialog: you. And your mom.
text: John hesitates for a moment. Lights up a smoke.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We're doing all right, Dad. We're doing
dialog: good.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Tell me.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It's hard to explain. Something happened
dialog: today. It was like a dream. And when I
dialog: woke up I had all these new memories.
dialog: Good times. Times we never had before.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I'm glad.
text: But John looks troubled. Something bothering him. He takes
text: a hit off his cigarette.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Dad, I gotta tell you this...cause you
dialog: should know. Cause I still remember.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What, Johnny? What is it?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What it was like when you died in the
dialog: fire...
text: Both men are silent for some moments. The hum of static. A
dialog: breath, then --
speaker_heading: JOHN (cont'd)
dialog: We needed you. I needed you. So many
dialog: times...I wished for you. But you
dialog: weren't there for me.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Mom tried. But she was hurting. I used
dialog: to hear her, every night, for years,
text: crying herself to sleep.
text: Frank grips the radio mic, stunned.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I didn't think...
text: The static grows. John leans into the mic
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Well, you think about it. And you
dialog: remember, cause I don't wanna lose you
dialog: again. I don't ever want Mom...
text: John's voice cracks, choking back the tears.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (over static)
dialog: You won't. I swear to God you won't. I
dialog: love you, son.
text: A blast of static. The signal is gone. It is quiet.

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - LATE NIGHT - 1969
text: Through several glass windows a CLOCK READS: 11:52 PM.
text: Julia and other medical personnel are working on a heart
text: attach victim and they are winning. She is in charge and she
dialog: is impressive. Cool...efficient...expert.
text: A sixth sense causes her to look up to see:
speaker_heading: FRANK.
text: Standing behind the windows. Motionless. Gazing at his
dialog: wife.
text: Julia holds on him for a split second, concern and surprise
text: etching across her face. She turns back to her work, then
text: says something to another ER nurse, who nods okay. Satisfied
text: the patient is out of the woods, she peels off her gloves and
text: heads for the door.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM/HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Julia steps through the door as Frank approaches.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Frank...what's wrong?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Nothing. I just wanted to see you.
text: He takes her in his arms, snuggling his head against her
text: neck, losing himself in the scent of her hair.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont'd)
dialog: (whisper)
dialog: I'm not goin' anywhere, Jules. For the
dialog: rest of your life.
text: It's hard to tell, we can't see his face, but it looks like
text: Frank is crying.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Frankie, what is it?
text: But Frank is silent. So they just stand there, holding each
text: other. And then Julia notices the burn and scrape marks on
text: Frank's arms and neck.
speaker_heading: JULIA (cont'd)
dialog: I got a bad feeling today...I was
dialog: worried.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I'm here. Bruised but not broken.
text: Frank pulls his head back, looks into his wife's eyes and
text: kisses her on the mouth. It's a long kiss.
text: As they come up for air.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Where's Johnny?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I tucked him in at Gordo's.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: You give him his drops?
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: One in each ear.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What would you do without me?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Probably marry some rich doctor and never
dialog: have to work...
text: Julia sees something through a glass door that stops her
text: short. A YOUNG INTERN is standing over a gurneyed PATIENT.
text: The YOUNG INTERN is changing the I.V. BAG.
speaker_heading: JULIA (cont'd)
dialog: What's he doing? Frank, I gotta...
text: He knows she's back on the job. Waves "no problem."
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY CUBICLE - CONTINUOUS
text: Julia interrupts the Young Intern as he hooks up the bag.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Excuse me doctor, is that Benazepril?
speaker_heading: INTERN
dialog: Yes.
text: Julia quickly shuts off the I.V.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I gave this patient 50 mills of Benedryal
dialog: on admittance.
dialog: (unhooking I.V. bag)
text: Mix them and he's dead.
speaker_heading: INTERN
dialog: Why wasn't I made aware?
speaker_heading: JULIA
text: It's in his chart.
text: The intern steps back: "Oh shit." Julia takes charge.
text: The patient stirs: a SCRAGGLY HIPPIE, looks kind of like
text: Pacino in SERPICO. A breathing mask covers his bearded face.
text: Barely conscious, his eyes focus on Julia.
text: After a quick double check of the patient, Julia looks up.
text: Through the glass door she can see Frank watching.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (mouthing to words)
dialog: I love you, Bud.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: (mouthing back)
dialog: I love you more.

text: But the room does not change back. He goes to teh bathroom.

scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY
text: The same horrible instant replay. Flashes of faces swimming

speaker_heading: JOHNNY'S POV
text: He is CROUCHED UNDER A TABLE. STARING AT THE CASKET. Alone.

scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING
text: The kitchen looks different: dirtier, uncared-for. John
text: looks different too: like a guy on the tail end of a lifetime

dialog: On the slam of John's phone, we got to...
scene_heading: INT. JULIA'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - MANHATTAN - MORNING
text: John knocks on the door. It opens to reveal a Jamaican woman
text: clutching a crying infant, a toddler hanging off her leg.
text: Behind them we half recognize Julia's apartment. We know
text: it's her apartment because of the BAY WINDOW and the view of
text: THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE. But everything else is
dialog: different. Different furniture. Different pain job.
text: John stands speechless. The Jamaican woman regards him...
speaker_heading: JAMAICAN WOMAN

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (relaxed)
dialog: I'm looking for Julia Sullivan.
speaker_heading: JAMAICAN WOMAN
dialog: I think you have the wrong apartment.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: But this is her place. 910 Riverside.
dialog: Apartment 3C.
speaker_heading: JAMAICAN WOMAN
dialog: I'm sorry, but no one by that name lives
dialog: here.
text: John just stands there, lost, questioning his grip on
text: reality. Liquor on his breath, fear in his eyes, he is a

dialog: the door.
scene_heading: INT. 23RD PRECINCT - DETECTIVE SQUAD - COFFEE ROOM - LATER
text: ON SATCH, scavenging the fridge while absorbed in some
dialog: papers.
text: Through the open door he SPOTS JOHN across the squad room.
text: Even at that distance, Satch can see John's unsteady walk and
text: fucked up demeanor. Satch's eyes go to stone.
scene_heading: INT. 23RD PRECINCT - MEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: John leans over the sink, wet paper towels pressed to his
text: face. He barely reacts to the SOUND of the door. He does
text: react to the silence that follows. Satch stands in the
text: doorway...looking him over.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What?
text: A long silence.
speaker_heading: SATCH
dialog: Another rough night, huh? That it?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Yeah. That's it.
text: John moves for the door. But Satch grabs him, slams him

speaker_heading: SATCH
dialog: Do not disrespect me. Disrespect
dialog: yourself all you want. But not me. Or
dialog: anybody else around here. You got that?
text: John shrugs, sagging against the wall.
speaker_heading: SATCH (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JOHN

scene_heading: INT. 23RD PRECINCT - DETECTIVE SQUAD ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Satch and John approach their adjoining desks. Satch slides

speaker_heading: SATCH
dialog: Bad memories...

speaker_heading: JOHN

text: filled with police and forensics reports. And PHOTOS. Crime
text: scene shots of 9 DEAD WOMEN. Linked by TWO gruesome details -

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What kinda twisted animal.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Dad, we did something. Something to make

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Whatta you mean...
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: He didn't just kill three women anymore.
dialog: He killed ten.
speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Something we did changed the
dialog: case...changed history.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Mom wasn't dead. But then after you

dialog: was like a spree...seven more women.
speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I'll warn them.
speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: No. Nobody got...
dialog: (realizing)

dialog: gonna do before he does it.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: So what should I do? Call the police?
dialog: You think they'll believe me?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: They will if they catch him in the act.
dialog: You can make that happen, Dad. You can
dialog: tail the victim and call it in at just
dialog: the right moment.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I don't know, John. I'm a fire fighter.

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: You ever talk to a victim's family? The
dialog: one's left behind? They don't act like
dialog: what you'd think. There's panic and
dialog: fear. But mostly, it's like there's this
dialog: logic problem. And if they could only
dialog: solve it, everything would be okay.
dialog: (a breath)
dialog: But if you look real close - look at

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What if the radio stops working? Christ,
dialog: what if I can't reach you again?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Then you get Mom the hell out. But Dad,

text: as Karen enters the bar, at a point near the murder site
text: described by John. He pauses to stare at it.
scene_heading: INT. COZY'S BAR & RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Frank enters the place. Sort of a singles atmosphere, but a
text: comfortable one. It's HAPPY HOUR. On the TV, the Mets' Gil
text: Hodges offers his analysis of Game 3.
text: Frank looks about, down the bar and into an area with booths
text: and tables. A few folks at the bar. A group of YOUNG WOMEN
text: laughing in a booth. But NO KAREN REYNOLDS. Frank's blood
text: runs cold in a spasm of panic when...
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Hey, Chuck.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Hey, Karen.
text: Frank wheels around just as Karen passes him from teh LADIES
text: ROOM. There is the trace of a bump, enough for Karen to take
text: note of Frank. Ad lib EXCUSE ME. She then starts moving
text: down teh bar towards the booth of young women.
text: Frank checks out everyone in the bar, not knowing quite what
dialog: he's looking for.
text: Karen slips into the booth with her friends. Ad lib HELLOS.
text: Frank orders a beer, but his eyes are fixed on the booth.
text: Karen and a friend take note of Frank staring at them.
text: Embarrassed, he turns away, checking his watch: 6:40PM. And
text: at just that moment a SCRAGGLY MAN passes by, taking a seat
dialog: at the end of the bar. We have seen this man before.

speaker_heading: SATCH

speaker_heading: YOUNG DETECTIVE

speaker_heading: SATCH
dialog: You're pulling over with a .44 bulldog
dialog: tucked in your pants getting ready to
dialog: blow somebody's brains out...I figure
dialog: the last thing you're thinking about is

text: Young Detective nods, impressed. John is less impressed.
speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: SATCH

text: the bar, past the Scraggly Man and walks to the booth.
text: Charmingly shy, Frank is kind of at a loss for words.

speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN #3

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: KAREN

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: KAREN

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: KAREN

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: SATCH
dialog: (looking at corkboard)
dialog: April 16...? That means she was the

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Which means he probably knew her.
speaker_heading: SATCH
dialog: This case just got hot. We pull on this

text: But for some strange reason John has stopped listening to

text: changing...Karen Reynolds' forensic photo disappears. In fact
dialog: everything about her, all evidence of her murder - police
dialog: reports, photos, witness reports - is GONE.
text: John's eyes shoot to the corkboard. The head shot of Karen

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: JULIA

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: JULIA

speaker_heading: JULIA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Coupla days ago they dug up a body in
dialog: Washington Heights - Mary Finelli. Girl
dialog: disappeared in '68. Turns out she was

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: JULIA

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: My six year-old here keeps telling me he

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: JULIA

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Yeah. I just wish I'd told her how proud
dialog: I was of her.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I'm sorry. I didn't realize...

text: Little Gordo reaches for the microphone.
speaker_heading: JULIA (CONT'D)
dialog: I better go. It's been good talking with
dialog: you.

speaker_heading: GORDO

speaker_heading: GORDO (CONT'D)
dialog: This is the Space Cowboy. I'm an

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Gordo?
speaker_heading: GORDO
dialog: How'd you know my name, mister?
text: John sits back, marvelling at how young Gordo sounds. A

text: lights up...realizing the opportunity.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Hey, Gordo. My name is Santa Clause.
dialog: And I'm gonna give you the biggest

text: Gordo looks at Frank: is this for real? Frank nods, smiling.
speaker_heading: GORDO
dialog: I better give you my address then.

dialog: It's a magic word and I never want you to
dialog: forget it.
speaker_heading: GORDO
dialog: You got a deal, mister. I mean Santa.
text: The sound of Julia's voice calling Gordo to bed. Gordo
text: scampers out. Static filters through both radios, then...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: John, you still there?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I'm right here, Dad.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You all right?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Yeah, I think so...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Don't worry, Chief. I'm not gonna let
dialog: anything happen to her...no matter what.
text: BZZZZ-SHHH. A burst of loud static. The band goes dead.
text: John takes a beat to come down. He gets up, making his way
text: into the KITCHEN. There's a half-full bottle of BUSHMILLS on
text: the counter. John reaches out to grab but the bottle. But
text: then he stops. It is time to stop. John turns on the faucet

text: Daryl shakes his head "no."
scene_heading: INT. PEPPERMINT LOUNGE - EVENING - 1969
text: End of the night. The place winds down. An old movie on the
text: TV's. Elvis' SUSPICIOUS MINDS plays softly.
text: Frank watches as Sissy picks up her last tip and heads to the
text: back to change into her street clothes.
speaker_heading: SISSY
dialog: See you, Fireman. Don't talk so much
dialog: next time.
text: Frank smiles, checks the time. 2:00AM. He looks around.
text: Nobody suspicious about. He starts up for the bathroom...
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT - 1998
text: Satch enters with a fresh cup of coffee, settles back to
dialog: watch.
scene_heading: INTERCUT - INTERROGATION AND OBSERVATION ROOMS
text: With great ceremony John removes his watch, his gun, and
text: lastly, his badge, and sets them off to one side.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You know, Daryl, sometimes, despite all
dialog: the training we cops go through. Despite
dialog: all that we are taught about right and
dialog: wrong. Despite all that we would like to
dialog: honor in ourselves, we can come to a
dialog: place where we don't give a fuck. Know
dialog: what I mean?
text: And John starts up from his seat and walks toward Daryl.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: You are going to tell me what I need to
dialog: know, Daryl.
text: SUDDENLY, in the door strides...
speaker_heading: SATCH
dialog: John.
text: John freezes. Looks towards Satch.
speaker_heading: SATCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Got a minute?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Yeah. Sure.
text: Satch opens the door and steps out. John collects his watch,
text: badge and gun and follows.
scene_heading: INT. SQUAD HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: SATCH
dialog: He ain't our guy, John.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Just cause he didn't want to look at the
dialog: photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer.
dialog: Not everyone fits the profile.
dialog: Long beat.
speaker_heading: SATCH
dialog: If he was gonna give something up he
dialog: would'a done it already.
text: John pauses for several seconds, then nods slowly.
scene_heading: INT. PEPPERMINT LOUNGE - MEN'S ROOM - EVENING - 1969
text: SUSPICIOUS MINDS filters in. Frank zips up, heads to the
text: sink. Bends over to wash his hands, and suddenly.
text: His face is smashed on the edge of the sink. He twists to
text: the floor, fighting to maintain consciousness.
text: A black Frye boot explodes into Frank's gut. He rolls over,
text: looks up at the LONG HAIRED GUY from the bar. Frank seems to
text: recognize him. We know him too - SCRAGGLY MAN. But we don't
dialog: know his name yet. So we'll call him...
speaker_heading: KILLER
dialog: You following me?
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON
text: Killer's eyes, evil fuckin' black dots. He lifts Frank to
text: his knees. Then rips a fist into Frank's face.
speaker_heading: KILLER (CONT'D)
dialog: I asked you a question, asshole.
text: Frank is clearly incapacitated. Killer lifts him to his feet
text: so they are eye-to-eye.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (barely able to speak)
dialog: Mary Finelli...
text: A look of absolute shock wipes across the Killer's face.
speaker_heading: KILLER
dialog: Who the fuck are you?
text: Caught off guard, Frank is able to slam his knee into
text: Killer's balls. Killer goes down like a stone, but Frank is
text: too battered to take advantage.
text: He collapses on top of Killer, who pushes him off, scrambles
text: up, and delivers a massive kick to his head. Frank is out
dialog: cold.
text: Quickly, Killer rolls Frank over and rifles his pockets
text: finding his WALLET. He grabs something from it, then tosses
text: it aside. He then takes something out of his pocket, a thin
text: leather garrote. He coils it around his hands and snaps it
text: taut. He bends down to start the job when suddenly, the
text: bathroom door opens and...
text: TWO very stoned MEN stumble in.
speaker_heading: STONED MAN #1
dialog: Whoa, dude. Is he okay?
speaker_heading: KILLER
dialog: Yeah. He just needs a little time
text: kissing the porcelain.
text: And Killer muscles Frank into a toilet stall and puts his
text: head in the bowl. He closes the door, quickly leaving.
text: In the stall, Frank spills onto the floor, his legs sticking
text: out into the bathroom. His face flush to the tile, his eyes
text: trying to focus on something lying just outside the stall...
dialog: His WALLET.
scene_heading: EXT. 23RD PRECINCT - PARKING LOT - NIGHT - 1998
text: John gets in his car. Sits there, staring into the night.
scene_heading: INT. PEPPERMINT LOUNGE - MEN'S ROOM - EVENING - 1969
text: Frank starts to come around. He reaches out and grabs his
text: wallet off the floor. His money still there. Credit cards,
text: too. But something's missing. His DRIVER'S LICENSE.
scene_heading: SUDDENLY PANIC SEIZES FRANK.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT HOUSE STAIRWELL - LATER
text: Frank tears up the stairs...
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT HOUSE CORRIDOR - SISSY'S DOOR - CONTINUOUS
text: Frank bangs on it. Scared. Desperate.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: OPEN UP, OPEN THE DOOR...ah...ummm...THIS
text: IS THE POLICE.
text: Frank keeps banging on the door. A NEIGHBOR'S DOOR swings
text: open a crack. AN OLD LADY peers out from behind a security
text: chain. Frank stops banging.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: It's okay, Ma'am. I'm the police.
text: Old Lady skeptically looking him up & down - noticing Frank's
text: bruised face. She quickly closes the door.
text: Frank reaches inside his jacket pocket, pulls out a small
text: bent metal wire, homemade LOCKPICK. He goes to work on
text: Sissy's lock. CLICK, CLICK, CLICK - got it. He opens the
text: door, steps inside.
scene_heading: INT. SISSY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: It's dark. And then a sound...scratching and popping, the
text: sound of a PHONOGRAPH NEEDLE makes when it reaches the end of
text: the vinyl and is scratching against the label.
text: The wind catching a curtain allows the shaft of a street
text: light to beam brightly into the room, and in one swift
text: moment, Frank is staring at a NIGHTMARE: Sissy Clark's
text: murdered body. Her dress hiked above her waist. Her panties
text: ripped off. Paper stuffed into her mouth. Her hands bound
text: with glass tape. Frank is transfixed and sickened by Sissy's
text: twisted face, her eyes frozen open in horrible death.
scene_heading: EXT. SISSY'S APARTMENT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Frank staggers out of the building towards his Harley. He
text: bends over and blows his dinner, then mounts the bike and
text: kicks the motor over. As he roars off down the street, WE
text: SEE in the building window...
text: THE OLD LADY looking down at him.

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It's not your fault, Dad.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yes it is...we did this. We changed

dialog: Dreams where I die...in the fire.

dialog: I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: ANGLE ON

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: This is wrong...it's like we cheated...
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I know...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But Dad, you can't go back. You didn't

dialog: do, nothing is gonna change that. So all
dialog: we can do is deal with this...and try to
dialog: make it right.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I don't think I can. I'm not a cop. I
dialog: can't. I can't stop this guy.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: But we can, we can do it together.
dialog: Spirit and guts, remember?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Johnny, I know, but...
text: Frank starts to light up a Lucky. But he stops, stubbing the
dialog: cigarette out.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I need you to believe in me. To believe
dialog: that we can do this.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: John, he's got my driver's license.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: He took my driver's license, John, he
dialog: knows where we live.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: He took your wallet?
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: In my pocket.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We got him! Dad you got him!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: His prints. You've got his prints. I'll
dialog: run them through criminal index. You
dialog: gotta get me that wallet.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: How the hell am I gonna do that?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: Listen to me, very carefully, take your

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What...
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Please, Dad, just do it.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Okay, okay...
text: Frank does as John asks. Taking out his wallet.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: I got it.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Right, now I need you to tape it up on

dialog: prints keep.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Then you gotta hide it somewhere.
dialog: Somewhere where nobody's gonna find
dialog: it...for 29 years!
dialog: (looking around the room)
text: Put it under the loose floorboard by the
dialog: window!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (getting it now)
dialog: I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It's gonna work, Dad. We're gonna stop
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hang on.
text: Frank fishes around the desk drawer for some electrical
text: tape...quickly ripping off strips of tape...covering the
text: wallet. Then he goes to the window. Crouches on the floor,
text: digging his nails around edges of the loose floorboard.
speaker_heading: BACK TO JOHN
text: getting up.
speaker_heading: FRANK (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: (over the HAM)
dialog: Okay.

speaker_heading: CARL SHEPARD

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: SHEPARD
dialog: Glad you did. Come on in. Buy you a cup
dialog: of coffee?
scene_heading: INT. SHEPARD RESIDENCE - CONTINUOUS
text: They enter the living room. No Mrs. Shepard. John's eyes

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Wife around?
speaker_heading: SHEPARD

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Oh. Sorry. How so?
speaker_heading: MR. SHEPARD
dialog: Well, she, Eve was murdered, Detective.
dialog: An ugly one to tell you the truth.
text: John's breath catches. His look shifts back to the photo of
dialog: Carl Shepard.
text: Mr. Shepard reaches to open an album. There are several
text: photographs of the young Mrs. Shepard. A couple where she is
text: dressed in a NURSE'S UNIFORM.
text: John is stunned. One can only imagine what is now racing
text: through his mind.
speaker_heading: MR. SHEPARD (CONT'D)
text: The mother of a cop, and they never found

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Happens that way sometimes.

dialog: Son still on the job?
speaker_heading: MR. SHEPARD
dialog: Nah. Doin' P.I. work now. Got caught up

scene_heading: INT. BROOKLYN WATERFRONT RESTAURANT - LATER

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You used to be on the job?
speaker_heading: SHEPARD
dialog: Yeah, long time ago. I know you?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I look familiar?
speaker_heading: SHEPARD

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: SHEPARD
dialog: A hot shot, huh?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Nah, just working the job.
speaker_heading: SHEPARD

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: As a matter of fact, I caught a case that

dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: SHEPARD
dialog: No kiddin'?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: No. Missing teenager. Disappeared
dialog: thirty years ago. Found her bones last

dialog: by Dyckman street. Mary Finelli.
text: John waits again for Shepard's reaction...
speaker_heading: SHEPARD
dialog: Huh.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (sipping drink)
dialog: Talk about dumb luck. Odds of anybody
dialog: finding that girl, thirty years later.
dialog: And then the chances of hitting a
dialog: dental...forget about it. Bets part is

speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: The past is a funny thing. We've all got

dialog: you in the ass, Carl.
text: John slips something on the bar, next to Shepard. It is a

speaker_heading: SHEPARD
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I'm the train wreck you didn't see

speaker_heading: SATCH

speaker_heading: JOHN (O.S.)
dialog: (over the HAM)

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (into radio)
text: John, hold on a second.
dialog: (to Satch)
dialog: I'm in the middle of something important
dialog: here. You mind if...
text: Frank suddenly spots something through the front window.
text: Satch's partner, PHIL HAYES, and TWO UNIFORMS out at the

text: Half a penny drops. All his senses go on alert. And

speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is
dialog: here John. You hear me? Satch is here.
speaker_heading: SATCH
dialog: I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come
dialog: outside.
text: Frank releases the squawk bar.
text: Johnny and Gordo remain fixed on the game, oblivious to

speaker_heading: JOHN (O.S.)
dialog: (over the HAM)
dialog: Dad, what the hell is going on?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (into mic)
dialog: Just a minute, John...okay? Don't go
dialog: away.
text: Julia now becomes aware of the tension in the voices in the

speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: What is going on here, Satch? What are

speaker_heading: SATCH
dialog: I think you know, Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No, I don't.
speaker_heading: SATCH
dialog: Let's go outside and talk. We need to do
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: SATCH
dialog: Let's go. Do us both a favor.
text: A long beat. Frank sees Julia staring at them. She is now a

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Okay.
dialog: (to Julia)
dialog: It's okay, Bud. I'll be right back.
dialog: (into radio)
dialog: Stay there, John.
text: And then he and Satch walk out the front door.
scene_heading: EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS
text: ...and towards a spot halfway between the house and the cops.
text: From inside the house, Johnny and Gordo have begun to take in
dialog: the activity.
speaker_heading: SATCH
dialog: Where were you last night, Frank?
text: The rest of the penny drops. Frank stalls, trying to think
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: SATCH
dialog: Do you know where I found this?
text: And he hands FRANK his missing DRIVER'S LICENSE. Frank looks
text: like a truck hit him.
speaker_heading: SATCH (CONT'D)
text: 415 Greenwich St. #302. Under the body
dialog: of a murdered woman.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No. This isn't what you think.
speaker_heading: SATCH
dialog: I wanna be wrong here. But we need to go

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Okay, okay. I need to go say something
text: to Julia and finish up with the guy on

speaker_heading: SATCH

text: back into the house.
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Julia, who has been watching through a front room window with
text: Johnny, moves to meet Frank. Behind Frank, Satch signals

text: Frank steps into the house and wraps his arms around Julia,
text: turning so he can see both Satch outside and where he wants
dialog: to go inside.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Trust me, Bud. Do that for me.
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - CONTINUOUS
text: Frank moves Julia toward teh desk, lulling Satch a moment,
text: then quickly steps to the HAM radio and hits the squawk bar.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: John, you there?
speaker_heading: JOHN (O.S.)
dialog: (over the HAM)
dialog: Yeah, Dad. What the hell is going on?
speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: SATCH (O.S.)

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: ...you gotta help me, Chief.

text: Johnny tears into the room and clutches onto his mother.
dialog: "Daddy, Daddy!"
speaker_heading: SATCH
dialog: That's not the deal, Frank. Don't do

speaker_heading: JOHN (O.S.)
dialog: Dad! Dad! What's going on? Satch?!

scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:

speaker_heading: JOHN'S POV
dialog: We see what John sees in 1998. But we also go inside his

scene_heading: INT. 17TH PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY - 1969
text: Frank sits at a metal table bolted to the floor, Satch sits

dialog: does not.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Carl Shepard. Detective out of the 15th

speaker_heading: SATCH

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: As nuts as that sounds, yes.
speaker_heading: SATCH

speaker_heading: SATCH

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: He's not gonna stop, Satch. He's gonna

speaker_heading: SATCH
dialog: Are you listening to me? You're in a

text: Frank sits up - takes a beat.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What if I could prove it to you, Satch?
speaker_heading: SATCH
dialog: How's that?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What if I told you that in the bottom of

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: SATCH

speaker_heading: FRANK
text: In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna

dialog: (beat)
dialog: Go watch the game, Satch.
speaker_heading: SATCH
dialog: Go watch the game? Go watch the fucking
dialog: game? Frank, they're gonna make you for

dialog: His wife is here. She wants to talk to
dialog: you.
text: Satch nods okay to Phil. He closes the door.
speaker_heading: SATCH
dialog: Whatta you want me to tell her?
text: Frank struggles for an answer...but comes up speechless.
text: Satch looks like his heart is breaking. Unable to comprehend
text: how Frank could have slipped this far. A long beat, then...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: She's in harm's way. He's gonna be
text: coming for her.
text: Satch snorts, incredulous. Frank reaches over the table and
text: takes his hand, deadly serious.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Promise me, as a friend. October 22,
dialog: don't let her out of your sight.
text: Satch nods okay. They have an understanding.
scene_heading: INT. 17TH PRECINCT - SGT'S DESK - MOMENTS LATER
text: Satch walks down the stairs. Julia alone on the bench.
text: She sees Satch approaching, stands up, looking at him for an
dialog: answer, for an explanation...for hope.
speaker_heading: SATCH
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Let's walk, get a cup of coffee.
text: Julia nods okay. They exit the precinct house and into...
scene_heading: EXT. 17TH PRECINCT - CONTINUOUS
text: ...the street. Around the corner we catch sight of someone
text: familiar - someone Julia and Satch don't recognize: Shepard.
scene_heading: INT. 17TH PRECINCT - SGT'S DESK - CONTINUOUS
text: Shepard approaches the desk, flashes his shield at Sergeant.
speaker_heading: SHEPARD
dialog: You got a collar in here for the
dialog: Nightingale murders?
speaker_heading: DESK SGT.
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: SHEPARD
dialog: I'm working with one of the victims outta

dialog: at him?
speaker_heading: DESK SGT.
dialog: That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
speaker_heading: SHEPARD
dialog: They around?
speaker_heading: DESK SGT.

speaker_heading: SHEPARD
dialog: Where's the collar, in the cells?
speaker_heading: DESK SGT.
dialog: No, I think he's up in interrogation.
speaker_heading: SHEPARD
dialog: I'll go find Hayes.
text: Shepard turns, gliding through the lobby like a shark...
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER
text: Satch and Julia sit at a booth in the back. Satch stirs his
text: coffee, trying to start a very hard conversation. As he
text: struggles to begin, the camera notices something in the B.G.
text: At the counter: a few stray people gathered around watching
text: the WORLD SERIES on an old TV.
scene_heading: AUDIO COMES UP.
scene_heading: INT. 17TH PRECINCT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Shepard passes the COFFEE ROOM. It is packed with
text: detectives, gathered around a TV...watching the game. Phil
text: Hayes is among them. And as Shepard passes, Phil half
text: catches a glimpse of him as he glides down the hall and
text: enters.
scene_heading: INT. 17TH PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Frank looks up to see Shepard, who quickly closes the door
text: behind him... and unholsters his gun. An eerie moment.
speaker_heading: SHEPARD
dialog: On your feet.
text: Frank waits a beat. Then very slowly, he stands.
speaker_heading: SHEPARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Now turn around, face the wall.
text: Frank steps back, slowly turning. Shepard holsters the gun.
text: Kicks Frank up against the wall as he reaches into his pocket
text: and takes out the leather garrote we saw in the Peppermint
text: Lounge Bathroom. He coils it around his hands.
speaker_heading: SHEPARD (CONT'D)
dialog: How did you know?
text: Frank is trembling.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (facing the wall)
dialog: You twisted animal...
speaker_heading: SHEPARD
dialog: Evidence says you're the animal.
dialog: (snapping garrote tight)
dialog: That's why you hung yourself.
text: But Frank turns.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You try putting that thing around my neck
dialog: and I'll rip your throat out. You want
dialog: me dead, use the gun.
text: Shepard smiles, unfazed...
speaker_heading: SHEPARD
dialog: Let me draw you a picture. You live at
dialog: 1060 41st Ave. You have a wife who works
text: at New York Hospital. And a six-year old
text: at P.S. 130.
text: Shepard gives Frank a look that would make a Marine Drill
dialog: Sergeant shit his pants. Shepard knows Frank's weakness, the
dialog: one thing that would make him submit to death.
text: Closing his eyes, Frank turns to face the wall...But the door
text: handle rattles, someone is outside coming in. Shepard
text: quickly yanks Frank away from the wall, shoving him in a
text: chair at the interrogation table.
text: The door opens.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: What the hell is going on here?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You got to help me. He's trying to kill
dialog: me.
text: Shepard just laughs. Phil scans the room - everything looks
text: normal, a cop questioning a perp.
speaker_heading: SHEPARD
dialog: Mind if we take it outside?
text: Phil shrugs okay.
speaker_heading: SHEPARD (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Frank)
dialog: I'll be right back.
text: Shepard and Phil step out - bolting the door behind them.
scene_heading: INT. 17TH PRECINCT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Shepard and Phil stand outside the door.
speaker_heading: SHEPARD
dialog: ...didn't mean t step on your toes. They
dialog: sent me up from downstairs, I thought
dialog: you'd be in there with him.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: What are you looking at him for?
scene_heading: INT. 17TH PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Frank's expression begins to harden. His eyes search teh
text: room. CLOSE ON his EYES. He looks like John - controlled
text: rage piercing through that Sullivan thousand yard stare.
text: He stands, turning around, looking for something, anything
dialog: that he can use to get the hell out of there.
text: His mind's racing, fire fighter training kicking in. And
text: then he looks up - just below the ceiling, above the door - a
scene_heading: 2'X2' ELECTRICAL CONDUCTOR BOX.
text: Follow Frank's eyes to something else. An AIR CONDITIONER
text: MOUNTED IN THE WINDOW.
text: Frank goes to the window. Runs his fingers along the air
text: conditioner's thick electrical cord - thinking. He unplugs
text: it. And then he RIPS cord out of the unit, exposing wire.
scene_heading: INT. 17TH PRECINCT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: A loud cheer rises out of the coffee room - the game is
text: heating up. Shepard and Phil are still standing outside the
text: interrogation room. Shepard flashes a smile, having said
dialog: something that makes Phil laugh...
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Yeah, half the uniforms are either at the
dialog: game or on the street. It's gonna be a
dialog: riot if they pull it off.
speaker_heading: SHEPARD
dialog: (glancing down the hall - in
dialog: direction of sound of TV)
dialog: What's the score?
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP - CONTINUOUS
text: Julia's crying. Satch has no words to comfort her, now way
text: of explaining any of this. He reaches out across the
text: table...taking her hand. And as they sit quietly.
text: CAMERA tracks towards the counter. And we hear something
text: that Satch does not. The sound of a voice. TV ANNOUNCER.
text: THE SERIES...
speaker_heading: TV ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
dialog: Cleon Jones thinks he's hit. I think the
text: ball hit him in the foot...
scene_heading: INT. 17TH PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Frank uses the heel of his shoe to rip the plug off the other
text: end of the electrical cord. Both ends now have exposed
dialog: wires.
scene_heading: INT. 17TH PRECINCT - COFFEE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Close on a MATCH. Pull back to reveal Shepard lighting
text: Phil's cigarette, then one for himself. They are inside the
text: squad's coffee room now. All eyes on the TV:
speaker_heading: TV ANNOUNCER
text: Hadges is coming outta the dug out. He's
dialog: calling for the ball. Can we get a shot
dialog: of the ball?
text: Shepard inhales deeply, sneaking a glance down hall at the
text: closed interrogation room door.
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP - CONTINUOUS
text: Satch looks past Julia, distracted, curious.
speaker_heading: SATCH
dialog: Can you excuse me for a second?
text: Julia seems bewildered as Satch gets up out of the booth,
text: making his way through the restaurant and towards the TV.
scene_heading: INT. 17TH PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Frank, in full throttle, drags a chair against the wall.
text: Climbs on the chair, uses a dime to unscrew the ELECTRICAL
scene_heading: CONDUCTOR BOX.
text: He then unscrews the master fuse and SHOVES ONE END OF THE
text: ELECTRICAL CORD'S EXPOSED WIRE AROUND THE FUSE CYLINDER.
text: After re-tightening the fuse, and careful not to touch the
text: other end of the cord, he jumps off the chair.
text: FOOTSTEPS. Frank freezes. Someone's walking down the hall.
scene_heading: INT. 17TH PRECINCT - COFFEE SHOP - CONTINUOUS
text: Wall to wall cops. Mesmerized by the game, especially Phil.
speaker_heading: TV ANNOUNCER
dialog: There's a scuff mark on the ball! The
dialog: umpire has reversed his decision. He's
dialog: sending Jones to first base!
text: The cops erupt. Cheering.
speaker_heading: SHEPARD
dialog: (yelling over the noise)
dialog: You mind I go back at teh fire boy for a
dialog: while? I won't lay a hand on him, just
dialog: want to see what he's got?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Go ahead, knock yourself out.
text: Shepard gives Phil one last smile, then slips out - casually
text: heading down the hall...towards the interrogation room.
scene_heading: INT. 17TH PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Frank, sweating bullets now, takes the two coffee cups off
text: the table and pours their contents ON THE FLOOR. The coffee
text: forms a SMALL PUDDLE which Frank is careful not to let slip
text: over the door saddle.
text: He puts the cups down. Then opens the cabinet, rifling
text: through, finding a can of LYSOL spray.
text: Sounds of cops cheering filter in under the door.
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Satch is riveted to the TV as Clendenon steps up to the
text: plate. Strike on.
text: Satch jumps - Julia has come up behind him, touching him on
text: the shoulder. She looks mad: how the hell can he be watching
dialog: the ball game at a time like this?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: What's going on, Satch?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: SATCH
dialog: (dumbfounded)
dialog: I don't know.
scene_heading: INT. 17TH PRECINCT - SQUAD ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: All eyes on the TV. Another strike to Clendenon. 0-2 count.
scene_heading: INT. 17TH PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: The door knob turns. The door half-opens. Shepard sticks
text: his head in, scanning the room. He relaxes a bit when he
text: sees Frank sitting quietly at the table.
text: Shepard opens the door a little further, takes a half step
text: into the room...and into the puddle of coffee!
text: Frank raises his arm. He's holding the live electrical cord.
text: Shepard: What the fuck? Frank flicks the cord...which lands
text: like a snake at Shepard's feet...in the puddle of coffee.
text: 5,000 volts surge through Shepard's body.
text: SPARKS AND SMOKE SHOOT OUT OF CONDUCTOR BOX...
scene_heading: INT. 17TH PRECINCT - SQUAD ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: CLOSE ON TV. Clendenon still up. 1-2 count. The wind up...
text: But something is wrong with the TV. A spark shoots out of
text: the back of the set.
text: And then the entire 17th Precinct goes DARK. Frank has
text: shorted out the electrical system.
text: The cops look at each other in a moment of pissed confusion.
scene_heading: INT. 17TH PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
text: Frank lunges over the table, smashing a wooden chair over
text: Shepard's head. He's in overdrive. Kicking the still live
text: cord out of the coffee puddle, he then drags Shepard's body
text: into the room, shutting the door.
text: Frank quickly rips off Shepard's SPORTS JACKET, pocketing
text: Shepard's WALLET and BADGE.
text: And then, moving very fast, Frank grabs the LYSOL can and the
text: matches Phil left on the table. He LIGHTS A MATCH and holds
text: it IN FRONT OF THE LYSOL CAN. He points the can at the
text: ceiling - at the FIRE ALARM SENSORS. Hits SPRAY button -
text: Professional Fire Fighter ingenuity - HOMEADE BLOW TORCH.
scene_heading: INT. 17TH PRECINCT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: FIRE ALARMS sound off. SPRINKLER SYSTEM kicks in, water
text: gushing from the ceiling. Cops begin to move, investigating.
scene_heading: INT. 17TH PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Frank cracks open the door and slips out. As the door
text: closes, Shepard's eyes pop open.
scene_heading: INT. 17TH PRECINCT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Sprinklers rain down on Frank as he moves down the hall.
text: Through the darkness he can see someone coming. It's Phil.
text: Frank covers his face...searching for a place to disappear.
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP - CONTINUOUS
text: Nobody breathes. All eyes on the TV.
text: The count is now 2-2. The pitch is a high fastball.
text: Clendenon takes a massive swing. He nails it. HOME RUN!
text: The coffee shop breaks into cheers. Everyone screaming their
text: heads off. Everyone except Satch, who just stands there, in
text: complete and utter shock. Julia looking at him
text: questioningly.
speaker_heading: SATCH
dialog: (yelling over the madness)
dialog: He was right! Everything he said. He
dialog: was telling the truth.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Then you believe him?
speaker_heading: SATCH
dialog: Yeah I do. You bet your life I do.
text: And they hug. The weight of the world sliding off Julia's
text: shoulders. But someone is trying to get Satch's attention.
text: It is the counter man, he's holding a phone.
text: Satch takes the phone, beat, his face goes ashen.
speaker_heading: SATCH (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm on my way...
text: He drops the phone, heading for the door.
speaker_heading: SATCH (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Julia)
dialog: Wait here, I'll send a uniform.
text: And Satch is gone.
scene_heading: INT. 17TH PRECINCT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Power is still off. Sprinklers still gushing. Amidst the
text: chaos, a bathroom door swings open. A man steps out. A cop.
text: Leather jacket, gold shield. It's Frank. He slips through
text: the madness, heading down the hall and towards the stairs.
scene_heading: EXT. 17TH PRECINCT - CONTINUOUS
text: Satch races down the crowded block...dodging celebrating
text: Mets' fans...bolting up the precinct steps into the house.
scene_heading: INT. 17TH PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Phil runs in. Scanning the room. But it is empty. No
text: Frank. No Shepard. Just a puddle of coffee on the floor.
scene_heading: INT. 17TH PRECINCT - SGT'S DESK - CONTINUOUS
text: Satch charges into the lobby. The lights start to flicker
text: back on. Chaos giving way to order.
text: Satch heads for the stairs.
text: And there is Frank, wearing Shepard's jacket and shield. But
text: in his hurry, Satch has not spotted him.
text: Frank quickly steps behind a pillar as Satch tears by him and
text: up the stairs.
text: Stay with Frank as he turns...calmly walking by the
text: Sergeant's desk, gliding out the precinct door and...
scene_heading: EXT. 17TH PRECINCT - CONTINUOUS
text: ...disappearing into the street.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (little smile)
text: Elvis has left the building.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY - 1998
text: John stalks down an apartment building hallway, gun drawn. He
text: reaches a door. Two locks and a bell. Fuck 'em. John
text: smashes his bulk into the door...one...two...three times. It
text: bursts off its hinges. John charges in.
text: Place is empty. Like somebody got the hell out in a hurry.
text: A few odds and ends left behind in the haste...including a
text: pile of unpaid bills. CARL SHEPARD.
text: John's eyes glaze over in rage and fury. But then he sees
text: something that makes him stop and think. There is a
text: telephone on the floor, in a corner. John stares at the
text: phone, wheels spinning. He reaches in his coat and takes out
text: his notebook. Flipping through pages. Notes on Shepard:
text: social security, address, DMV registration, and a series of
text: phone numbers...home, office, cellular.
text: John runs to the phone. Punches in the cell number. Ring.
speaker_heading: SHEPARD

scene_heading: INT. SHEPARD'S APARTMENT - WEST 74TH ST. - DAY - 1969
text: CLICK, CLICK -- dead bolt turning...
text: Front door opens and SHEPARD WALKS IN. His '69 apartment is
dialog: far nicer than the place we just left John in '98.
text: Shepard runs to the bathroom. Rips off the toilet's tank
text: lid, reaches down and pulls out a .357 Magnum Colt Python,
text: wrapped in clear plastic.
text: He rips off the plastic, shoves the pistol in his waistband,
text: heads into the kitchen.
text: He gropes behind the refrigerator, close on an envelope glass
text: taped to back of the fridge. Shepard's hand finds the
text: envelope...he rips it loose. And then he opens it -
text: revealing its contents, souvenirs, POLAROID PHOTOS OF THE
scene_heading: NIGHTINGALE MURDERS, WOMEN'S JEWELRY, NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS...
text: Shepard takes out a match to burn the photos. But then...
text: The broom closet door bursts off its hinges. Frank instantly
text: on top of Shepard. The souvenirs go flying in the air.
text: Frank pummels Shepard's head and back. But Shepard smashes
text: his elbow in Frank's Adam's apple, lands a solid uppercut
text: square on Frank's nose. Frank's eyes watering up, VISION
speaker_heading: BLURRING.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON
text: Frank's hand, groping for the handle of a glass pitcher atop
text: the kitchen counter.
text: Shepard reaches for his gun, points the .357 at Frank's head.
text: Shepard's finger squeezing the trigger. It's over. But...
text: FRANK SMASHES THE GLASS PITCHER down on Shepard's skull.
text: Shepard drops. CRACK, the gun fires, BLASTING AIR.
text: FRANK scrambles for the window. He's outta there, expertly
text: thundering down fire escape.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY BEHIND SHEPARD'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
text: Frank hits the pavement, twisting his ankle. Hears metal
text: rattling, looks up. Shepard's clattering down after him.
text: Shepard tries to get off a shot through the fire escape grid.
text: BANG! The shot ricochets wildly. Frank takes off, limping
text: and staying close to the building out of the line of fire.
text: The streets are still empty, the city glued to their TV's.
text: Frank hits CPW. He glances left, right, straight ahead.
dialog: Central Park.
text: Frank runs into the park.
scene_heading: INT. SHEPARD'S APARTMENT - W. 74TH ST. - DUSK
text: The door is kicked open. Satch and Phil enter, guns drawn.
text: They take in the damage from the fight. Following the trail
text: of blood back to the kitchen. And there, strewn across the
text: floor are Shepard's photos of his victims, the newspaper
text: clippings, the jewelry, and the envelope with the glass tape
text: still on it.
dialog: Satch knows.
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK BRIDGE - UNDER CONSTRUCTION - CONTINUOUS
text: Frank hears pounding footsteps - Shepard is catching up.
text: Frank's adrenaline kicking in, sprints around a bend in the
text: path, reaches long wooden bridge spanning Central Park Lake.
text: The bridge is being restored. Barricades across the
dialog: entrance.
text: Frank hurdles over the barricades, runs onto the bridge.
text: Shepard trips in the dirt. Gets back up, reaches the bridge,
text: knocks over a barricade, runs to the middle of the bridge.
text: FRANK'S DISAPPEARED. Shepard stops, listens - nothing.
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK BRIDGE - UNDERNEATH - CONTINUOUS
text: Frank dangles below the bridge, holding onto the steel girder
text: of substructure - 8 ft. above water. Not moving a muscle,
text: not making a sound, barely even breathing.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON SEWER RAT
text: Crawling on Frank's arm. Caught off guard, Frank flinches,
text: sending the rat tumbling.
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK BRIDGE - TOP OF BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
text: Bridge side railings have been removed for construction.
text: Shepard hears something hit the water. Rushes to the side of
text: the bridge, points his gun at the water. BANG!
text: Shepard leans out further aiming the gun at the water.
text: Shepard's outstretched arm only a few feet from Frank's head.
text: Frank silently swings his body forward reaching out...
text: Snags Shepard's arm, pulling him hard, over the side.
text: SHEPARD FALLS, grabs for something, anything. Wraps his arms
text: around Frank's leg, hangs on tight.
text: Frank struggles, kicks wildly, trying to shake Shepard off.
text: Shepard hangs on with his left arm. Pulls out the gun with
text: his right. He aims it at Frank's head. Cocks back the
dialog: hammer.
text: FRANK LETS GO. KERPLUNK. They plunge into:
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LAKE - CONTINUOUS
text: Murky water, thick with dirt and slime, 5' deep.
text: Frank's hanging on to Shepard's arm, trying to wrestle the
text: gun free. But Shepard's using his free hand to gouge Frank's
text: eyes. Frank bites down hard on Shepard's wrist.
text: The gun sinks silently to the muddy lake bottom.
text: But Shepard gets both hands on Frank's throat. Shoving his
text: head into the shallow water. Shepard's grip is like a vise,
text: Frank futilely tries to pry Shepard's fingers open.
text: Frank is blinded by polluted water. Starting to lose
text: consciousness. Desperately, he searches the muddy lake
text: bottom for the gun. But he's getting weaker, fading out...
text: Then he feels something. A BRICK, fallen off the bridge,
text: half buried in the mud. Frank struggles to dig it up.
text: Summons his last ounces of strength, yanking it back and
text: forth, it's getting loose.
text: But Shepard's hands are squeezing tighter. Frank finally
text: goes limp. A few last bubbles float to the surface. Shepard
text: smiles. Catching his breath, slightly loosens grip on
text: Frank's lifeless neck.
text: Frank springs off the lake bottom, rises out of the water
text: like a jack-in-the-box. Holding the brick with both hands,
text: he swings. CONTACT.
text: The brick smashes against Shepard's head. Knocking him to
text: yesterday. He drops like a rock.
text: Frank waits for Shepard to come up for air. Nothing.
text: Frank crawls out of the water, collapsing onto the
text: embankment. He just lies there, heart pounding, chest
text: heaving.
text: And suddenly, Frank is startled by a MASSIVE ROAR - the sound
text: of eight million New Yorkers screaming in unison. The Mets
dialog: have just won the World Series.
text: Frank laughs, slowly getting to his feet.
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST & 65TH - PAY PHONE - DUSK
text: Frank's dripping blood and filthy lake water. The streets

scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT - 1998
text: John is woozy. He reaches down to his holster - it is empty!
text: Shepard has got John's 9mm in his left hand. Holding the .45

text: tosses it aside. He then snaps a handcuff around John's
text: wrist, begins dragging him to the radiator.
text: John's FOOT ERUPTS up into Shepard's groin. The .45 goes

text: strong. BANG! The gun goes off.
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1969
text: Julia is paralyzed against the wall. Staring into the dead
text: as-marble eyes of Shepard. He looks her up and down.
speaker_heading: SHEPARD
dialog: Nice.
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Frank's wrists are bleeding. He can't get out. But then he
text: sees something. Something he can use. His WATCH. Frank
text: struggles to unfasten the watch strap. He does it. He
text: pinches the metal clasp with his thumb and forefinger and
text: guides it to the keyhole in the left handcuff. He works it.
text: Nothing. Then CLICK. He's out!
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT - 1998
text: John Shepard fight furiously. But John has managed to get

scene_heading: FACE...TEARING FLESH, DRAWING BLOOD.
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT - 1998
text: CLOSE ON SHEPARD, struggling with John. A LARGE SCAR ETCHES

scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT - 1969
text: Shepard grabs Julia by the throat. Slams her against the

scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT - 1998
text: BANG! BANG! John keeps squeezing that trigger.
text: CLICK. CLICK. No more bullets.

scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT - 1969
text: Shepard is on top of Julia in the shower. He uncoils the

text: And then a SOUND. Instantly recognizable. Beyond adequate
dialog: description. But once you've heard it, you don't forget
dialog: it...
scene_heading: CHUUT, CHUUT, CHUUT: THE SOUND OF A 12-GUAGE PUMP-ACTION

speaker_heading: SHEPARD

text: SHEPARD'S RIGHT HAND EXPLODES...blood spattering everywhere.
text: Like a wounded animal, Shepard bolts, blowing past Frank.

text: the doorway. Safe and sound.
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT - 1998
scene_heading: SHEPARD RIGHT HAND GOES LIMP AROUND JOHN'S NECK. HE STARES
text: IN SHOCK AS HIS HAND BEGINS TO DISFIGURE.
text: John starts to choke back to life...
text: And then something happens. Some kind of SHOCK-WAVE ripples
text: through the house -- bending light - bizarrely distorting
text: everything in its path, including Shepard and John.
text: The shock-wave is over. But the house is different.
dialog: Changed.
text: Shepard scans the changed room - disoriented, bewildered.
text: CRASH! John pounces. Pounding blows to Shepard's head.
text: John is on top of Shepard, hands on his neck. As John
text: squeezes the life out of him, Shepard struggles to reach down
dialog: his leg with his good hand...
text: There's something down there. An ankle holster. Shepard
text: strains to get his hand on the gun. He does.
text: In a flash, Shepard has the gun to John's temple.
text: CLICK. Shepard cocks back the hammer.
speaker_heading: SHEPARD
dialog: You were the kid. I remember now.
text: Keeping the gun pressed against John's temple, Shepard gets
text: to his feet.
speaker_heading: SHEPARD (CONT'D)
dialog: But this time, no Daddy.
text: John closes his eyes. It's over, he knows he's gonna die.
text: SILENCE. Then a sound. A sound we've heard before. A sound
dialog: you never forget. Music to our ears.
scene_heading: CHUUT, CHUUT, CLICK: THE SOUND OF A 12-GAUGE PUMP-ACTION
text: SHOTGUN RATCHETING A ROUND IN THE CHAMBER.

speaker_heading: GIBSON
dialog: (to pitcher)
dialog: Take it easy on him son, he's older than
dialog: Moses.

dialog: the warehouse 29-years ago.
text: PHIRE POWER twirls his arm...
text: Frank takes a big swing...contact...the ball fouls back
text: behind the plate. Towards the parking lot. Where among the
text: old Chevys and Fords sits a brand new MERCEDES. The custom
text: license plate reads: YAHOO.
text: CRASH! Frank's foul ball comes down hard. As the Mercedes'
text: windshield spiderwebs we hear an off-camera scream...
text: It is Gordo, jumping up, running across the field. From the
text: parking lot his eyes meet Frank's. An I'M SORRY shrug, and
text: Frank turns his attention back to the game.
text: The next pitch is high and outside.
text: Frank takes a looping swing...driving the ball to the gap in
text: right center. Frank jogs to first. An easy single.
text: From first, Frank glances over at the third base coach:
text: JULIA. Her hair pinned up under a Mets cap, Julia puts two
text: fingers in her mouth and belts out a loud whistle as...
text: The next batter steps out of the dugout. It is John
dialog: Sullivan.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON
text: John as he makes his way to the plate.

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Bring me home, son! Bring me home!
text: PHIRE POWER uncorks the fastest softball pitch you've ever

text: The crew in the stands are on their feet, cheering.
text: Frank rounds third, John catches up. A double high-five from
text: Julia and they jog home together. The game is over.
text: Frank puts his arm around John. Heading for the bleachers.

dialog: His name is Frank Jr.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Hey there, Chief.
text: John gives his son a kiss, glances up at Samantha in the

speaker_heading: FRANK JR.

speaker_heading: CLOSE ON
