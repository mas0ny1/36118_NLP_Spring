scene_heading: INT. BUNK CAR
text: The dormitory of the section gang. The men are through for the day and
text: lounging on their bunkbeds. DUFF ANDERSON plays checkers with FRANKIE, using
text: bottle tops as pieces. Duff makes the winning move and Frankie, disgusted,
text: turns over the board. He saunters over to JOCKO, who is shaving in a broken
text: mirror. Frankie watches him with a grin.
speaker_heading: JOCKO
dialog: Go to hell, Frankie.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Man, you sure one ugly cat!
text: He takes the cigarettes Jocko has rolled, sailor-style, into the sleeve of
text: his T-shirt.
speaker_heading: JOCKO
dialog: Why don't you guys buy your own?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: 'Oughta give up smoking, Jocko.
text: He stops in front of an older man, who is writing a letter.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: How much longer we got on this stretch, Riddick?
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Five weeks, maybe six.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Man, what a dump.
text: He circles restlessly past two cardplayers back to Duff, who is clipping his

speaker_heading: FRANKIE

speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: (with a grin)
dialog: Why don't you relax, Frankie?
speaker_heading: RAILROAD TRACK
text: Duff, Frankie, and Jocko are riding a track-car, powered by a small engine,
text: into the nearest town. The sun is setting. A church bell rings.
speaker_heading: POOL HALL
text: Jocko, a cigar in his mouth, is playing a pinball machine. Duff and Frankie
text: stand at the bar. They are joined by DORIS , a sad-looking woman with bad
dialog: skin.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Who's going to buy me a beer?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: (scornfully)
dialog: What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: It sure is.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: See Duff. He's the money man.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: What d'you say, Duff?
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: (to the bartender)
dialog: Give her a beer.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Thanks, Duff. You' a nice guy. Not like Frankie.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: You know, Doris - you'd make some guy a swell
dialog: wife.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: You think so, Frankie?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Hell, you got steady work.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Quit ridin' her, Frankie.
text: The bartender serves her a bottle of beer
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: I ain't ridin' her. Wouldn't ride her on a bet.
text: Duff pays for the beer and turns to leave.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Where' you goin'?
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Out.
speaker_heading: DORIS

speaker_heading: DUFF

speaker_heading: STREET (Night)
text: Duff is walking along the deserted street in the black part of town.
text: Music from the pool hall fades and we pick up the strains of gospel singing
text: from a nearby church.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH
text: The choir is singing "Precious Lord." The women are spirited and the
text: congregation in the small wooden building is alive to the music.
text: Duff appears in the open doorway and stops to listen.
text: When the song ends, REVEREND DAWSON rises from his chair.
speaker_heading: REVEREND
dialog: I'm glad to see this meeting off to a good
dialog: start. Now we'll take a break and then come back
dialog: to hear from our distinguished guest - Reverend
dialog: Butler of the Morgan Street Baptist Church in
dialog: Birmingham. See you all in a little while.
text: Reverend Butler compliments him on the choir.
speaker_heading: CHURCH YARD
text: Long tables laden with food are lit by strings of lightbulbs. The sound of a
text: gospel piano from inside the church.
text: A smiling middle-aged woman has taken Duff in tow and leads him over to a
text: young woman (JOSIE), who is serving food.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Josie - this is Brother Anderson. Now you give
dialog: him some of that good food. He's a fine young
dialog: man.
dialog: (on her way)
dialog: Ain't it a wonderful meetin'?!
text: Duff studies Josie with a smile. She is clearly middle class. While she puts
text: food on a paper plate, she glances at him - matching his ironic detachment
text: with her own. She hands him the plate
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Thank you, Ma'am. That's fine.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: You must be new in town.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: (with a grin)
dialog: I'll have me some of that punch there, too.
text: She serves the punch.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: Haven't seen you around, have I?
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: No. I'm new in town.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: (unwilling to give up)
dialog: You working?
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Yeah. On the section gang.
text: He is sure that this will put a stop to her curiosity. It doesn't.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: (interested)
dialog: Oh yeah?
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: You work around town?
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: I'm a teacher.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Went to college, huh?
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: In Birmingham.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Oh yeah? That's my home town.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: Your folks live there?
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: No. My mother's dead.
dialog: (after a moment)
dialog: You goin' back inside?
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: Yes, aren't you?
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You
dialog: goin'?
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: (with a smile)
dialog: My father's the preacher.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: (a bit tentatively)
dialog: Look, I don't know what you been told 'bout
dialog: section gangs, but how 'bout seein' me sometime?
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: (with a non-committal smile)
dialog: Maybe.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH
text: The visiting revival preacher is in full swing, preaching and singing. The

text: of it, though she sits in their midst.
text: Duff has been standing in the doorway. He turns away.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH
text: Duff walks away, past a shack. The singing fades. A dog barks.
speaker_heading: BUNK CAR (Night)
text: Duff, Frankie, Jocko, and an older man (POP) are playing cards. While waiting
text: for his turn, Jocko catches a fly and sneaks a look at Frankie's cards.
speaker_heading: JOCKO
dialog: You got a lousy hand, Frankie.
text: Frankie throws down the cards.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Yeah, I quit.
text: He gets up. At loose ends, he picks up an old Flit-gun and squirts it at
text: Duff, who is polishing his shoes.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: You got nothin' on your mind but your hair,
dialog: Frankie. How 'bout your car, Riddick?
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Yeah, you can have it.
speaker_heading: JOCKO
dialog: Man, you won't like that back seat.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like
dialog: that? You won't get no place.
speaker_heading: JOCKO
dialog: Hell, they're all after the same thing.
speaker_heading: POP
dialog: Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.
speaker_heading: JOCKO
dialog: What d'you know about women, Pop?
speaker_heading: POP
dialog: Well, I got married to one of them.
speaker_heading: JOCKO
dialog: Hell, I didn't know you was married.
speaker_heading: POP
dialog: Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
speaker_heading: JOCKO
dialog: Is that right?
dialog: (to Duff)
dialog: Think you're gonna make it with her?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Just get her drunk.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: (to Riddick)
dialog: How 'bout the key?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: I bet she's easy jam.
scene_heading: DAWSON DINING ROOM (Night)
text: A middle-class tableau. Dinner is over. Reverend Dawson is reading the paper.
text: Josie, dressed for an evening out, sits across from her step-mother, who is
text: looking at her with pursed lips.
speaker_heading: MRS. DAWSON
dialog: I know you pay no mind to my feelings, but
dialog: d'you think it's right for you to go out with
dialog: him?
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: I'm twenty-six years old, Susan.
speaker_heading: MRS. DAWSON
dialog: Perhaps you ought to tell her, Frank.
text: Reverend Dawson has no stomach for confrontations, but turns to Josie
text: dutifully.
speaker_heading: REVEREND DAWSON
dialog: Well, we have a position in town, Josie. You
dialog: have to remember that. There're lots of other
text: young men.
speaker_heading: MRS. DAWSON
dialog: I don't think your mother would have approved.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: MRS. DAWSON
dialog: Well, there's just one thing you can be looking
dialog: for in a man like that.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: I know that's what you think.
speaker_heading: REVEREND DAWSON
dialog: Hush your mouth, child.
text: The doorbell rings.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: (leaving the table)
dialog: Good night, Dad.
speaker_heading: ROAD HOUSE
text: On the dimly lit, smoke-hung floor a large crowd is dancing. Josie is having
text: a great time. When the music ends, she and Duff return to their table.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: What d'you expect?
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: You know, baby, I can't figure you out.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: How d'you mean?
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint
dialog: like this?
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: You don't think much of yourself, do you?
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: (put off)
dialog: Well, that's a funny thing to say.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: You keep asking me why I'm here.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: I like a place with lots of life.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: How about another beer?
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: No thanks.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Go on - you can have one!
text: His attention is drawn by something off screen.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Hell!
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: What is it?
text: Frankie and Jocko swagger toward them, beer in hand.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Well, if it ain't Duff!
speaker_heading: JOCKO
dialog: How you doin'?
dialog: (to Josie; with
dialog: a bit of a leer)
dialog: Hi there!
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: JOCKO
dialog: Mind if we sit down?
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: We was just leavin', fellows.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Let's go, Jocko. The man's got homework.
speaker_heading: JOCKO
dialog: (leaving)
dialog: See you, Duff.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Yeah, see you in hell.
text: Frankie follows Jocko out of the frame.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
text: They must work on the section gang.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
text: Well, they seem just like everyone else.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Hell, baby, I bet you think we got tails.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE'S VOICE
dialog: (off-screen)
dialog: We do!
text: Frankie and Jocko have occupied the adjoining table and are grinning at them.
text: Duff gets up, camouflaging his irritation.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Come on, baby.
text: He ushers Josie out. Frankie looks after them.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: School teacher! My nappy head!
scene_heading: INT. RIDDICK'S OLD CONVERTIBLE (Night)
text: Duff has parked on a country road.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: I guess it's hard working on the road like that.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a
dialog: week.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: How d'you mean?
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Well, I don't get on so well most places.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: I see. That beer made me dizzy.
text: Duff is looking at her.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: You got a lovely face, kid. Ain't too often I
dialog: get to meet a girl like you. Hell--
text: He kisses her, but releases her very quickly.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Baby, how many times' you been kissed?
text: Josie takes a moment to collect herself.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: Well, let's see now - not counting tonight ...
dialog: must be about twenty-eight times.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: (with a grin)
dialog: You got a problem all right.
text: Someone moves in back of her. A white man in his early twenties has emerged
text: from the dark and looks down at them.
speaker_heading: WHITE
dialog: (with a smile)
dialog: Hi.
text: The voice of a second white man calls from off screen.
speaker_heading: SECOND WHITE
dialog: They doin' anything?
speaker_heading: WHITE
dialog: (calling back)
dialog: Nah, nothin'!
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Get out of here!
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: (frightened)
dialog: Don't Duff--
speaker_heading: WHITE
dialog: Relax, man!
text: The second white man joins him.
speaker_heading: SECOND WHITE
dialog: What's goin' on?
text: He shines his flashlight into Duff's face.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Cut that out!
text: The white man shines the flashlight across Josie's breast.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: (very tense)
dialog: I said: Cut it out!
speaker_heading: WHITE
dialog: Don't start no trouble, boy!
speaker_heading: SECOND WHITE
dialog: Let's go! That's the preacher's girl. Mess with
dialog: him and you got old man Johnson on your back.
dialog: Come on.
text: The white men leave.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: Let's go, Duff.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Take it easy.
text: We see that he has a knife in his hand. He closes and pockets it.
text: The white men drive off, whooping and beating on the side of their car.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Don't sound human, do they?
scene_heading: INT. MOVING CAR (Night)
text: Duff is driving through the center of town.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: How come you stay 'round here?
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: Well, my mother was the only good teacher the
dialog: colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with
dialog: those kids.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: That's why you come back, huh?
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to
dialog: stay. Another year, anyway.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good
dialog: town.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago
dialog: they still had a lynching here. They tied a man
dialog: to a car and dragged him to death. My father
text: knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Scared, huh?
text: The car pulls up in front of the Dawson house and Duff parks.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Well, good night, baby.
text: He is about to kiss her.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: Not here, Duff.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: I get it.
dialog: (with a laugh)
dialog: Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun
dialog: right now.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: But I would like to see you again.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't
dialog: go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: What d'you mean?
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: You almost got into trouble back there.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: (with a smile)
dialog: I wouldn't have let you.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well,
dialog: look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a
dialog: nice long chat in the parlor?
speaker_heading: JOSIE
text: No, on the porch.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Oh yeah, and then what?
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get
dialog: married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and
dialog: I don' want to get married.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: (defensively)
dialog: All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want
dialog: with me?
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're
dialog: kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had
dialog: a feeling that you're different. That's why I
dialog: went out with you. I thought we might have
dialog: something to say to each other.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: Good night, Duff.
text: She gets out of the car and starts toward the house.
text: He looks after her, then drives away.
speaker_heading: OPEN FIELD
text: The section hands are hunting rabbits, scaring them up out of the tall grass
text: and then clubbing them with sticks that have a heavy bolt fastened to the end.
text: Jocko is fishing from a trestle. Pop fries skinned rabbit in a skillet. Duff
text: is whittling.
speaker_heading: CLASSROOM
text: The grade school children, all black, are writing at their desks.
text: The end-of-school bell rings and one of the boys jumps up.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: Are you finished, Jackie?
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Yes, Ma'am.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: Well, I'm not. Wait till class is dismissed.
text: She walks over to close the window.
text: In the yard below, Duff is sitting on one of the swings.
text: Josie smiles and turns to the kids --
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: All right. Class dismissed.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOLHOUSE
text: A bus crowded with noisy kids pulls away to reveal the yard. Duff and Josie
text: are sitting on two swings side by side.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: At first it was real strange. Hell, Japan is a
dialog: long ways from Alabama. Really got under my
text: skin, though. Almost didn't come back.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: Why did you?
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: 'Been up north?
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months
dialog: after the Army. You been there?
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Well, it ain't that good up there neither. Might
dialog: as well make it here. 'Course I ain't really
dialog: makin' it now.
text: He gets up and gives her swing a forceful shove.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Anyway, they can't get to you if you keep movin'!
text: Josie laughs.
scene_heading: FRONT YARD, DAWSON HOUSE
text: It is raining. Duff and Josie dash up the path to the front door.
speaker_heading: DAWSON PARLOR
text: Duff and Josie barge in out of the rain and find themselves face to face with
text: Reverend Dawson and a middle-aged white man - Superintendent Johnson.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: Come on in, Josie. We're all through.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: Daddy - this is Duff Anderson.
speaker_heading: REVEREND DAWSON
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: How are you?
speaker_heading: REVEREND DAWSON
dialog: All right, son.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: This is Mr. Johnson, our school superintendent.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: (with a friendly smile)
dialog: How are you?
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: I'll be right back.
text: She leaves.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: So you're courtin' the preacher's girl. Well,
dialog: just watch your step, boy, or he'll preach you
dialog: right into hell.
dialog: (to Reverend Dawson)
dialog: I'm counting on you, Reverend.
speaker_heading: REVEREND DAWSON
dialog: I understand.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a
dialog: time like this.
speaker_heading: REVEREND DAWSON
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: (on his way out)
dialog: I'll talk to the Mayor.
speaker_heading: REVEREND DAWSON
dialog: That'll make the folks very happy.
text: Johnson leaves.
text: Reverend Dawson sits down in a rocker.
speaker_heading: REVEREND DAWSON
dialog: It's hard to know how to talk to the white folks
dialog: these days.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Guess it's never been easy.
speaker_heading: REVEREND DAWSON
dialog: It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Thank you.
text: He sits down opposite Reverend Dawson.
speaker_heading: REVEREND DAWSON
dialog: Well, it looks like we'll be getting our new
dialog: school.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same
dialog: school?
speaker_heading: REVEREND DAWSON
dialog: Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any
dialog: trouble in town for eight years, and we're not
dialog: going to have any now.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Can't live without trouble, can you?
text: (he sees he is on
dialog: the wrong track)
dialog: Nice place you got here. Real nice.
speaker_heading: REVEREND DAWSON
dialog: Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I
dialog: guess you're a church man, aren't you?
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: I guess I ain't.
speaker_heading: REVEREND DAWSON
dialog: Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do
dialog: a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites
dialog: that need it real bad.
speaker_heading: REVEREND DAWSON
dialog: I think if you tried livin' in a town like this,
dialog: instead of running free and easy, you'd soon
dialog: change your tune.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: I doubt it.
speaker_heading: REVEREND DAWSON
dialog: I see.
dialog: (rising)
dialog: Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: I guess not.
speaker_heading: REVEREND DAWSON
dialog: And since we're talking, my wife and I don't
dialog: want you hanging around our daughter.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Well, that figures.
dialog: (he too stands up)
dialog: Kind of fits in with everything else, don't it!
speaker_heading: DAWSON PORCH
text: Duff comes out. Josie joins him a moment later.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Ain't your fault.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: That's the way he is.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Yeah. It's just like I figured.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: What d'you mean?
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I'
dialog: been thinkin'.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working
dialog: tomorrow.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: Just for the day?
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Goin' to see my kid.
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: I didn't know you had one.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Yeah. Well, I do.
speaker_heading: JOSIE

speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: (with a grin)
dialog: Well, what-do-you-know?
speaker_heading: JOSIE
dialog: Surprised?
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
speaker_heading: JOSIE

speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
speaker_heading: JOSIE

speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR

speaker_heading: DUFF

speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
dialog: All right, then. All I want you to do is tell

speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
dialog: Then do like I said.

dialog: you-all.
dialog: (to Duff)
dialog: Well, how about it?
text: Duff looks at the supervisor in silence, fully aware that he is about to be

dialog: All right, go down' the office and get your pay.
dialog: Tell them you're through.

speaker_heading: DUFF

speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: Don't look like there's a right way.
speaker_heading: REVEREND DAWSON
dialog: Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say

dialog: along - and get what you want.
speaker_heading: DUFF
dialog: It ain't in me.
speaker_heading: REVEREND DAWSON
dialog: You'll be in trouble, son.

speaker_heading: ELLIS
