scene_heading: EXT/INT. JEEP - WEST COAST OF JUTLAND - AFTERNOON
text: May 1945. World War 2 is over.
text: CU A Danish soldier, Carl (41)(military rank: Sergeant) is
text: driving along in a jeep. He turns into a gravel road.
text: After a while he comes to the dunes overlooking the beach.
text: Carl parks the jeep and steps out. He walks over the
text: dunes. On his back is a big backpack from which little
text: black flags are sticking out. Carl stops on top of one
text: of the dunes and looks across the beach. Clearly, this is
text: a post-war landscape. As far the eye can see the beach
text: is covered with lines of barbwire and signs saying.
text: ‘DANGER! MINES.'
text: Carl pushes some sand off with his foot. (He looks at a
text: mine map) A wooden plank (Pansermine) appears beneath the
text: sand. Carl puts his backpack down and digs further up
text: ahead. Another plank appears. Carl puts his backpack
text: back on and walks along the planks down towards the sea.
text: He treads carefully, it is obvious that the entire beach
text: is littered with mines. You can even see some of them
text: poke up through the sand.
text: Carl goes all the way to the water before he stops. He
text: looks down the beach. He pulls a flag out of his backpack
text: and sticks it into the sand. Then we walks along the
dialog: water.
scene_heading: INT. ARMY TRUCK - AFTERNOON
text: CU of young German soldier on the back of an army truck.
dialog: This is Sebastian(16).
text: Besides Sebastian are 11 other German boys.
text: We see their faces one by one. Manfred(16), Werner(17),
text: Ernst(17), Helmut(19), Ludvig(16), Wilhelm(15) and so on.
text: 12 boys in all. They are just teenagers, nevertheless
text: their youngish faces have a worn-out look to them. Like
dialog: they have borrowed them from much older, and more
text: experienced men. Hard and weary. The boys all look like
text: they have been starving, some more than others. They are
text: in various types of uniform. All of which are worn and
text: torn.
text: Two of the boys (Werner and Ernst) are like two peas ina
text: pod. They are obviously twins. Hidden from the view of
text: the others, they are holding hands.
text: Sebastian peers out through the a gap in tarpaulin cloth
text: that covers the back of the truck. He squints as the
text: setting sun gets in his eyes. The truck is driving along
text: a straight road through a forest near the Danish North
dialog: Sea coastline.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Carl is driving his jeep along. He drives past long lines
text: of German prisoners of war walking south along the road,
text: heading back down towards Germany.
text: Further ahead there is a scuffle between some Danes and
text: the German POV's. Carl pulls up to them. Honks the horn.
text: He stops and gets out.
text: Carl drags the Danes away. The Germans are about to
text: continue walking. Carl turns towards them.
speaker_heading: CARL (in German)
dialog: You stay here. Understood?
text: The Germans wait.
text: Carl goes over and talks to the Danes. (From afar) We
text: can't hear what they are saying. The Danes point over at
dialog: the Germans.
text: Carl turns around and goes over to the Germans. He smiles
text: at them. He stands there for a bit. He offers one of
text: them a cigarette. The German takes one and smiles back.
text: Carl takes out a lighter.
dialog: Long beat.
text: Carl headbutts the German. He goes down. Carl looks at
text: the other Germans. They make no move to interfere. They
text: look scared.
text: Nobody speaks.
text: The German who was knocked down by Carl gets back up.
text: They start walking.
scene_heading: EXT. ARMY BARRACKS S@NDERBORG AREA - LATE AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: The truck with Sebastian and the boys drives through a
text: gate. It stops on a large open square. We see several
text: trucks pull up next to it. Pebbles crunch under the heavy
text: truck tires.
text: German prisoners of war in all ages spill out from the
text: trucks and settle in the square. A few Danish armed
text: soldiers are there to receive them.
scene_heading: EXT. ARMY BARRACKS S@NDERBORG AREA - LATE AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: About 70 German prisoners of war of various ages are lined
text: up outside of the square outside the main building. Quite
text: a few of them are teenagers. They look wretched in their
text: worn-out torn uniforms.
dialog: 3.
text: A young Danish officer, Ebbe(29) (rank: Lieutenant) comes
text: out of the main building. Ebbe walks briskly and stops
text: in front of the Germans.
text: Ebbe smiles and addresses the POW's in German.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: My name is Lieutenant Ebbe Jensen
dialog: from the Danish Pioneer Corps.
dialog: (Minenkommando
dialog: Danemark)
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: To those of you who are still
dialog: unaware of what you are doing
dialog: here: You have been brought here
dialog: to Denmark to clean up after the
dialog: war.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Denmark is neither your friend,
dialog: nor your enemy. Having said that,
dialog: do not expect the Danes to welcome
dialog: you with open arms. Nobody wants
dialog: you Germans here. For us you
dialog: serve one purpose only: To clear
dialog: the Danish west coast of German
dialog: land mines that you put there in
dialog: the first place.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: I know that most of you have never
dialog: done any minesweeping or de-mining.
dialog: That is why we have brought you
dialog: here, before you are to de-mine
dialog: the beaches. We will teach you
dialog: as much as we can in the little
dialog: time we have. In other words. We
dialog: are here to help.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: EBBE (in German) (CONT'D)
dialog: Welcome to Denmark!
scene_heading: INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS/ BARRACKS - EVENING
text: Sebastian and the other boys walk in a line down a long
text: hallway. They are shown into the sleeping quarters. A
text: small room. Filled with bunk beds without mattresses.
text: Sebastian looks around. It seems most of the beds are
dialog: occupied.
text: Sebastian spots an empty bed, next to the window. He
text: sits down on the bed.
text: One of the older boys, Helmut(19), comes over. He looks
dialog: at Sebastian.
text: He stands there for a long time before he speaks.
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: Move. That's my bed.
text: Sebastian looks at the boy. Clearly, this is not his
text: bed. Sebastian thinks about standing his ground. Decides
text: against it. He gets up.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Of course.
text: Sebastian finds a spot on the floor, where he sits down.
text: He looks around the room. He pulls his blanket around
dialog: him.
text: There is not enough beds for everyone and several others
dialog: have also had to settle for the floor.
text: Sebastian lies down. Looks around at the others before
text: he shuts his eyes.
scene_heading: INT. INTERIM CLASSROOM - MORNING
text: Sebastian and most of the boys he came with in the truck
text: are standing to attention in a small classroom. The young
text: commanding officer Ebbe comes in. He is flanked by two
text: Danish soldiers. He stands in front of the boys. On a
dialog: table are several land mines.
text: Ebbe looks around the room. He pulls down a map of
dialog: Denmark.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Good morning!
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: Good morning, lieutenant!
text: Ebbe smiles. Ebbe outlines the western coast of Denmark
text: on the map with his cane.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: There are currently 2.2 million
text: land mines spread out along the
dialog: Danish west coast.
text: He looks at the boys.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: This is more than in all the other
dialog: European countries together ...
dialog: Someone must have thought that
dialog: the invasion from the west would
dialog: take place right here..
text: Ebbe points again.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: +-On the Danish coastline to the
dialog: North Sea. What a shame for him.
dialog: And what a shame for you lot too!
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: My only purpose here is to teach
dialog: you lot how to find and disarm
dialog: these mines. Nothing else. This
dialog: is what I do. This is what I am
dialog: good at. In other words, I don't
dialog: need to know your names, your
dialog: background. I don't need to get
dialog: to know you. You have each other
dialog: for that. I am simply not
dialog: interested.
text: Nobody says anything.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Understood?
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: Yes, lieutenant!
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: How many have seen or handled a
dialog: land mine?
text: Most of them raise a hand.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: How many have disarmed one?
text: Only a few hands.
text: Ebbe walks over to the table. He picks up a German teller
dialog: mine.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Who has seen one of these before?
text: Most of them put their hands up.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Good. They are also the most
dialog: common ones.
text: The two soldiers pass the mine around for inspection.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: For an optimal impact these mines
dialog: are buried 15 to 20 centimeters
text: below the sand. This makes them
dialog: relatively easy to find.
text: Ebbe picks up another type of mine.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Who knows what this is?
text: Everyone puts their hand up.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes, you.
dialog: Ebbe picked Wilhelm, the youngest of the boys.
speaker_heading: WILHELM
dialog: It is a Schrapnell mine,
dialog: lieutenant.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Correct. We call it Bouncing
dialog: Betty. This kind of mine is always
dialog: placed in the heather or in the
dialog: dunes. If the grass is not too
dialog: long they are visible - in most
dialog: cases.
text: Ebbe puts two schrapnell mines on the table. He strings
text: an almost invisible wire between them.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
text: A thin metal wire is strung between
dialog: them. If you trip it, one or
dialog: more mines will launch a meter
dialog: into the air and ...
text: Ebbe gestures an explosion.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
text: Ka-BOOM! Out comes hundreds of
dialog: little iron pellets. Not good!
scene_heading: INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS/ BARRACKS - NIGHT
text: Sebastian and the boys are in their beds. Most have gone
text: to sleep. Sebastian looks around. Ernst (one of the
text: twin brothers) is having a nightmare. Werner(17) his
text: brother carefully wakes Ernst up. He whispers to him.
text: Holds him. Ernst calms down. Werner keeps watch over
dialog: his brother.
text: Sebastian closes his eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. ARMY BARRACKS - DAY
text: Following day. Sebastian and some of the other boys are
text: crawling around in a giant sand box. Ebbe, flanked by
text: two soldiers, is walking among the boys. Ebbe speaks
text: while observing the boys.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Faster, everyone! Each one of
dialog: you must disarm at least 6 mines
dialog: an hour!
dialog: Cut to:
text: A bit further away. Carl is over by a barn. He is loading
text: wooden planks onto a trailer. Peter (39), a Danish soldier
text: is helping him.
text: While working Carl looks over at Ebbe.
text: Peter looks at Carl.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I thought you two were inseparable?
text: Carl doesn't answer. He keeps loading the trailer.
text: Peter stops.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: In my opinion you should put it
dialog: behind you, Carl. The war has
dialog: ruined too God damn much already,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Did anyone ask for your.opinion?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, but I am just saying, that he
dialog: did everything he could to help
dialog: you from over there.
text: Carl looks at Peter. He goes over to him. Carl puts his
text: face right up against Peter's. This makes Peter nervous.
text: Carl smiles at him.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Did he? And what do you know
dialog: about it, little Peter? How did
dialog: he help me, exactly? Or my dad
dialog: for that matter? None of you did
dialog: shit. You all sneaked out and
dialog: ran. You call that help?
dialog: Peter Says nothing.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: 3 years we were locked up. Not
dialog: you. Not him!
text: Carl gently slaps Peter on the side of the head.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: And what did you do, exactly,
dialog: over there in Sweden? Tell me.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We were mobilizing.. Training.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Mobilizing ... More like hiding
dialog: out and fucking all the Swedish
dialog: women and having a good time.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: And then you return all hero-like..
dialog: After the danger is gone, promoted
dialog: with pretty new ranks?
text: Carl looks at Peter's uniform.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you now? Senior Sergeant?
dialog: How the fuck did that happen?
text: Peter says nothing.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Is there anything else you want
dialog: to say to me?
text: Peter shakes his head.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: No? I didn't think so. So keep
dialog: your mouth shut.
dialog: Cut to:
text: Ebbe is walking in between the boys.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: 60% of the mines you will be de-
dialog: mining are made from non-metals.
dialog: That is, things like concrete,
dialog: plastic, glass or like this one,
dialog: wood.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you think that means for
dialog: you guys?
text: No one answers.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Nobody?
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: It means that the metal detectors
dialog: you see over there are absolutely
dialog: useless to you.
dialog: (Ebbe points)
text: Ebbe holds up his little wooden stick.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: This stick, however, can.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Unlike me, the stick is now your
dialog: new best friend.
text: Suddenly Ebbe whacks one of the boys Ludvig (16) across
text: the hands with the stick.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Boom! You just lost your hands.
text: Ebbe is standing over him.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Keep going. Go on. There is no
dialog: time to feel sorry for oneself.
text: Ludvig fiddles with the mine once more. Ebbe whacks him
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Boom! You are dead.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Again!
text: Ludvig fiddles again. His hands are red from the blows.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Boom! I believe we have our first
dialog: terminal casualty here. You don't
dialog: want to see your family again?
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you really going to be the
dialog: first one to die?
text: Ludvig mumbles.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: What? I can't hear you.
speaker_heading: LUDVIG
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: No, what?
speaker_heading: LUDVIG
dialog: No, lieutenant! I am not to be
dialog: the first one to die!
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: I am happy to hear it! Try again.
text: Ludvig's hand are shaking. He tries again.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Boom! Dead again.
dialog: 10.
text: Sebastian and the other boys are taking note of what is
text: happening, while they are prodding away in the sand.
text: Manfred (16) is digging next to Sebastian.
speaker_heading: MANFRED
dialog: Idiot.
text: Ebbe hears it. He comes over to Sebastian and Manfred.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Is there anything you want to
dialog: share with the group?
text: Ebbe addresses Manfred.
speaker_heading: MANFRED
dialog: No, sir!
text: Ebbe looks over at Sebastian.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: No, sir. I have nothing I want
dialog: to share with the group.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: No really. I saw you smile. Do
dialog: tell. Lord knows, your friends
dialog: here could do with something to
dialog: smile about.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: It was nothing.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Yes, sir, lieutenant. Absolutely
dialog: sure.
text: Most of the boys look down again and keep searching for
dialog: mines.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Show me what you got then!!
text: Sebastian prods with the stick, carefully.
text: Sebastian hits something. He carefully digs with his
text: hands. A teller mine (a practice mine) appears. He
text: quickly disarms it. He picks it up and puts it away. We
dialog: see that this is his fifth one.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: What is your name?
text: Sebastian doesn't answer.
dialog: 10
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: What is your name soldier?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I didn't think the lieutenant was
dialog: interested in knowing our names,
dialog: sir?
text: Ebbe whacks Sebastian's fingers with his cane. Sebastian
text: pulls his hands back.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Good work. Keep it up.
text: Ebbe walks on.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Remember that your stick is your
dialog: best friend now. Your own little
dialog: magic wand!
text: Ebbe stops behind one of the others boys - Helmut(19) (the
text: boy who took Sebastian's bed). Ebbe whacks Helmut's hands.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Boom! You are dead too!
text: Helmut pulls his hands back.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Get moving! Show me some magic!
text: Ebbe stops and looks over at Carl, who drives off ina
dialog: jeep.
scene_heading: INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS / BARRACKS - NIGHT 10
dialog: 
text: Sebastian is sitting / lying down with some of the other
text: boys in the sleeping quarters. The boys are talking in
text: hushed voices. Manfred(16) is telling jokes.
speaker_heading: LUDVIG
dialog: Tell it again..
speaker_heading: MANFRED
dialog: No, I don't want to.
text: Ludvig laughs.
speaker_heading: WILHELM
dialog: Go on, we want to hear it too. I
dialog: will tell one afterwards.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: MANFRED
dialog: Okay then..
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: MANFRED (CONT'D)
dialog: So Hitler and Géring are standing
text: on top of the Berlin radio tower.
text: Hitler shakes his head and says,
dialog: "Berlin sure isn't what it used
text: to be, eh?" G6dring shakes his
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: MANFRED (CONT'D)
text: Hitler looks at Géring and says
text: how he longs to put a smile back
text: on the lips of the Berliners.
text: G6ring looks at Hitler and says,
dialog: "Then why don't you go ahead and
dialog: jump?"
text: The boys all burst out laughing. All, except Helmut. He
text: is stone-faced.
text: Manfred smiles at Helmut.
speaker_heading: MANFRED (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, man. That is funny.
text: Helmut looks at Manfred.
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: Yeah? What was the funny bit?
text: The others laugh even harder.
speaker_heading: HELMUT (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't see what is so funny.
speaker_heading: MANFRED
dialog: Well, you know ... It would have
dialog: prevented the war.
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: Yeah, I get that. And? You think
dialog: that is funny?
text: The others don't know whether to continue laughing or ...
text: Helmut looks angrily at Manfred.
speaker_heading: HELMUT (CONT'D)
dialog: Why are you shaking your head!?
dialog: Because of me?
text: Manfred doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: HELMUT (CONT'D)
dialog: You think you are funny? Or do
dialog: you think I am stupid?
speaker_heading: MANFRED
dialog: No.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: What then?
text: Manfred doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: HELMUT (CONT'D)
dialog: You! I am talking to you.
speaker_heading: MANFRED
dialog: No, of course not. I am just
dialog: goofing around, man.
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: You think this is funny?
text: He spreads out his arms to include their whole situation.
text: Manfred doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: HELMUT (CONT'D)
dialog: What about this? Is that funny?
text: Helmut gets up and grabs hold of Manfred.
text: Sebastian steps between them.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Hey, calm down. He was just joking
dialog: around, right?
text: Manfred nods.
text: Helmut lets go of Manfred and turns to Sebastian.
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: You want somthing? You think you
dialog: are special, don't you?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: Then why don't you stay the fuck
dialog: out of it? Do you think that you
dialog: are better than the rest of us?
text: Sebastian doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: HELMUT (CONT'D)
dialog: Where did you serve?
text: Again, Sebastian doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: HELMUT (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you know what I did?
speaker_heading: HELMUT (CONT'D)
dialog: I was an officer.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: So?
text: There is high tension in the air.
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: So? I will tell you what. You
dialog: would never have been able to do,
dialog: what I did in the war. You know
dialog: why? Because you lack courage! A
dialog: good leader and soldier should
dialog: have courage and never show fear.
text: Sebastian doesn't answer.
text: Helmut is right in front of Sebastian. Right in his face.
text: In a calm voice he says.
speaker_heading: HELMUT (CONT'D)
dialog: You think I don't know your kind?
dialog: Is that what you think? You think
dialog: I don't recognize a stupid little
dialog: blue-collar boy, when I see one?
text: Helmut smiles.
speaker_heading: HELMUT (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh yes. A stupid little working-
dialog: class nobody. That is what you
dialog: are, right?
text: Sebastian suddenly looks up at Helmut. With a quick
text: movement Sebastian grabs Helmut by the throat with one
text: hand. He tightens his grip. Helmut tries to get Sebastian
text: to let go. Sebastian stares straight into Helmut's eyes.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: You! I don't know you. You ask
dialog: me all these questions and think
dialog: you are entitled to an answer?!
dialog: Why?
text: Helmut can hardly breathe.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You don't wanna know, where I
dialog: was. If I told you, where I was
dialog: and what I did, you would be
dialog: shitting your pants right now ...
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Are we clear ..?
dialog: 11
dialog: 15.
text: Helmut manages to nod even though he can barely breathe.
text: Sebastian lets go of Helmut.
dialog: Beat.
text: Helmut is stunned. He goes back to his bed.
text: The others are quiet.
scene_heading: EXT. ARMY BARRACKS / SANDBAG SILO - MORNING 11
dialog: 
text: Ebbe, flanked by two soldiers, is in a kind of silo made
text: from sandbags. The boys are standing around them. In
text: the middle on the ground lies a teller mine. Spread out
text: with amble distance between them are several other teller
dialog: mines.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: These mines are not dummy mines.
dialog: I repeat; they are not dummies!
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: This means that if you slip up,
dialog: you will either get hurt very
dialog: badly or die. Do I make myself
dialog: clear?
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Good. Who volunteers to go first?
text: Nobody answers.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Either someone will volunteer or
dialog: I will pick one. There is no way
dialog: around it. You are all going to
dialog: disarm a real mine today.
text: Still no reply.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: You didn't think that your first
dialog: live mine would be on the beach,
dialog: did you?
text: Helmut raises his hand. Ebbe sees it, but ignores him
text: and points to one young Wilhelm(15).
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: You! Yes, you. Come over here.
text: Wilhelm stands to attention in front of Ebbe.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: You will go first.
speaker_heading: WILHELM
dialog: Thank you, sir.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: When you have disarmed the mine,
dialog: you leave through there. You
dialog: bring the top of the mine out
dialog: with you, as proof. Understood?
speaker_heading: WILHELM
dialog: Yes, lieutenant.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Good. The rest of you come with
dialog: me.
text: Ebbe, the two soldiers and the rest of the boys leave the
dialog: silo.
speaker_heading: EBBE (Shouting) (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you ready in there?
speaker_heading: WILHELM
dialog: Yes, lieutenant.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Begin!
text: Wilhelm begins. His hands are trembling. (CU) The mine.
text: Wilhelm does it. He wipes the sweat from his brow and
text: leaves the silo.
text: He shows the lieutenant the fuse.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Good.
text: Wilhelm puts it in the box that one of the soldiers is
dialog: holding.
text: The boys are lined up.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Next.
text: Helmut goes in.
text: Ebbe shouts.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ready?
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: Ready, lieutenant.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Begin!
text: Helmut is quick. He comes out and throws the fuse in the
dialog: box.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Well done, and quick. Good!
text: Ebbe pats Helmut on the shoulder. Helmut almost grows 3
text: feet from the praise.
text: Ludvig tries to hide his nervousness. His hands are
text: shaking out of control. He clutches them behind his back.
text: It is as if time is standing still for him. He hardly
text: notices how the line is getting shorter and shorter, that
dialog: it will be his turn very soon.
text: Now only Sebastian, Ludvig and Manfred remain.
text: Sebastian goes in. He comes out again, almost immediately.
text: Ebbe is surprised. Helmut smiles. His eyes say ‘finally
dialog: everyone sees that I am both quicker and more brave than
dialog: Sebastian’.
text: Sebastian lifts up his arm, opens his hand. The top of
text: the mine - the fuse - is in his hand. He puts it in the
dialog: box.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: That would be one disarmed mine,
dialog: Sir.

text: Sebastian winks at Ludvig, when he walks past him.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You've got this.
text: With heavy steps Ludvig walks into the silo. He stops
text: just inside the entrance. Ludvig looks at the mine, then
text: at all the disarmed ones. He goes over to the mine.
text: There are only two left. Ludvig sits down and looks at
text: the two mines, then he picks one up. (CU) the mine. His
text: hands are shaking.
text: Outside Sebastian, the boys, the two private soldiers and
text: Ebbe are waiting.
speaker_heading: EBBE (shouting)
dialog: Come on. The others would have
dialog: done the lot by now.
text: Inside the silo. Ludvig hears Ebbe's cry faintly. His
text: right hand slowly turns the fuse.
text: Outside. Ebbe looks at his watch.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you asleep in there?
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Permission to go in and get him,
dialog: sir?
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Not a chance!
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: God damn it!
text: Ebbe goes over to the silo.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: I am coming in!
text: Ebbe enters the silo.
text: When Ebbe comes into the silo, Ludvig is sitting in the
text: middle cross-legged looking at the mine.
text: Ludvig slowly looks up at Ebbe.
speaker_heading: LUDVIG
dialog: I can do this..
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Get up.
speaker_heading: LUDVIG
dialog: No, I can do this.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Put that mine down right now,
dialog: soldier! That is an order!
speaker_heading: LUDVIG
dialog: No, I can do this! I want to do
dialog: it.
text: Ebbe looks at Ludvig's shaking hands.
text: The boys outside cover their ears.
text: Ebbe comes out.
text: Ludvig turns the last of bit of the top. Nothing happens.
text: He carefully disconnects the copper wires. He did it.
text: Ludvig gets up. He proudly exits the silo. He drops the
text: top in the box. The others applaud. Even Ebbe is smiling.
text: The only one who hasn't been in yet is Manfred(16). He
text: looks at the boys.
dialog: 12
dialog: 13
dialog: 14
dialog: 19.
text: Ebbe sends in Manfred.
text: The others are still thrilled that Ludvig made it.
text: Suddenly there is a huge explosion.
text: Black smoke pour out of the silo.
dialog: Fade to black
dialog: Cut to:

scene_heading: INT. ARMY TRUCK - MORNING 13
text: As in the beginning Sebastian and the boys are back in an

dialog: 16
dialog: 17
dialog: 20.
text: The boys are assembled in the quietness. They look around.
text: They are outside a barbwire fence. A sign says: Achtung
dialog: Minen! Danger Mines! No Access!
text: In front go the entrance are two guards armed with guns
text: and rifles. Sebastian and the boys pass the guard point.
text: They head down the the small gravel road. Towards the
text: dunes and the sea.
scene_heading: EXT. GRAVEL ROAD / WEST COAST - DAY 15
dialog: 
text: The boys march along a gravel road with barb-wire on either
dialog: side.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The boys and Sebastian reach an old tarred wooden fishing
text: hut inside the fenced off area. The hut is right in the
text: middle of the dunes. It is a beautiful setting.
dialog: If it hadn't for all the barbwire and the fencing it would
dialog: have been scenic.
text: Not far from the fishing hut is a little run-down two-
text: winged farmhouse. We see, that a girl (5) is playing just
text: outside the farmhouse.
scene_heading: EXT. FISHING HUT - DAY 16
text: A military jeep with a trailer pulls up in front of the
text: fishing hut. The boys, who were sitting down, get up and
text: stand to attention. Carl is driving the jeep. He stops
text: the jeep in front of the hut. He looks casually at the
text: boys before he jumps out and walks over to the farmhouse.
text: Carl knocks on the door to the farmhouse.
text: It takes a while before Karin(52), the owner of the
text: farmhouse, opens the door. They talk a little before
text: Karin puts on her wooden clogs and follow Carl across to
text: a barn. They stop in front of a traditional wooden door.
text: Karin unlocks it.
scene_heading: INT. CARL'S ROOM - DAY 17
text: Inside. A tiny room with a low ceiling. Carl goes in
text: first. The room has a simple bed with a mattress, a small
text: table and a chair.
text: His expression says it all. He is clearly not happy with
dialog: the standard of the accommodation.
speaker_heading: KARIN
dialog: I know it is not much, but ...
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: No, it's fine. We appreciate
dialog: that you can accommodate us.
dialog: 18
dialog: 21.
text: Karin is just standing there. She looks at Carl somewhat
text: perplexed. Carl notices.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: KARIN
dialog: I don't know if I need to mention
dialog: it, but I don't want any Germans
text: near the farmhouse. The fishing
dialog: hut is okay. As long as they
dialog: stay over there.
text: Carl looks up at Karin and smiles.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: They will keep to the hut.
text: Karin smiles.
speaker_heading: KARIN
dialog: Okay then ... if you need anything
dialog: or have any questions, let me
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Okay.
text: Karin goes out and closes the door.
text: Carl sits on the bed a while. Carl takes out a bottle of
text: whisky from his bag. He pours himself a glass. He drinks
dialog: it down.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE - AFTERNOON 18
text: Carl comes back out. He walks over to the fishing hut,
text: where the boys are still standing to attention.
text: Carl whistles. Carl's dog, Otto, comes running from the
text: jeep and over to Carl. He plays with it. Carl fill upa
text: bowl of water and sets it down. The dog drinks from the
dialog: water.
text: Carl washes his neck and hands from the tap on the outside
text: of the farmhouse. He fills up his canteen.
text: Carl sits down on the stairs to the fishing hut. The dog
text: comes over and sits next to him. He strokes it.
text: The sun is high in the sky and it is hot.
text: Carl is carrying a gun and wearing an English army uniform,
text: with a red arm band with yellow text saying "Dansk
dialog: Minekontrol".
text: Carl drinks again. The boys are thirstily eyeing his
text: canteen, and the tap.
dialog: 22.
text: Carl gets up and stands in front of the boys. He looks
text: at the boys. He looks tough. The boys are still standing
dialog: to attention.
text: Carl goes over and stands in front of one of the boys.
text: Wilhelm (15) is the youngest of the boys. Evidently.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Name?
speaker_heading: WILHELM
dialog: Hahn. Sir.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: First name?
speaker_heading: WILHELM

text: Carl moves on to the next boy.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Name?
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: Morbach. Helmut Morbach. Sir!
text: He stands in front of the twins.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: And you two. I take it that you
dialog: two are brothers?
speaker_heading: WERNER
dialog: Twins, sir!
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Really? And you are?
speaker_heading: WERNER
dialog: Lessner. Werner and Ernst Lessner.
dialog: Sir.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Did I ask about your brother's
dialog: name?
text: Carl stares at Werner and is about to move on.
speaker_heading: WERNER
dialog: Sorry, sir.
text: Carl stops. He smiles to Werner.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Sorry for what?
text: Werner just stands there for a while.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry for what? What exactly are
dialog: you apologizing for, huh?
text: Werner looks down.
speaker_heading: WERNER
dialog: For saying my brother's name,
dialog: sir.
text: Carl slaps Werner in the face.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Look at me when I am talking to
dialog: you!
text: Werner looks up.
text: Carl smiles.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Try again. What are you
dialog: apologizing for?
speaker_heading: WERNER
dialog: I am not surel...
text: Carl slaps him in the face again.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: What do you want to apologize
dialog: for?
text: Werner doesn't say anything.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Speak up, man!
speaker_heading: WERNER
dialog: I don't know what I am supposed
dialog: to say, Sir!
text: Carl leans in close to Werner and whispers in his ear.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Do I really need to tell you?
text: Werner looks timidly at Carl. Hesitantly he says:
speaker_heading: WERNER
dialog: The war?
text: Carl looks at him and around on all the boys. He slaps
text: him on the shoulder.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Your excuses are no good to me.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: WERNER
dialog: Yes, sir. Sergeant, sir!
text: Carl now looks at Ernst.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Name?
text: Ernst replies quietly.
speaker_heading: ERNST
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Ernst. Lessner. Sir!
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Speak up, boy!
speaker_heading: ERNST
dialog: Ernst Lessner, sir.
text: Carl moves on. All the boys are a little uneasy. They
dialog: can't figure him out.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Name?
speaker_heading: LUDVIG
dialog: Hafke. Ludvig Hafke, sir.
text: Carl goes around to everyone and comes to the last boy.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: And you?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Schumann. Sebastian Schumann.
dialog: Sir.
text: Carl goes a bit further back and faces the boys.
text: Carl looks. at his dog.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: What do you say, Otto? Shall we
dialog: let the boys have some water?
dialog: Shall we? Do you think they are
dialog: thirsty or what?
text: The dog (Otto) shakes his tail. Carl crouches down. He
text: lets the dog lick his face.
text: He looks at the boys.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: You may go get some water.
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: Thank you, sir!
dialog: 19
dialog: 20
dialog: 25.
text: The boys run over. They take turns filling up their
text: canteens. Drink. They drink like they have never tasted
dialog: anything sweeter in their lives.
scene_heading: EXT. DUNES - AFTERNOON 19
text: A little later. Carl is walking through the dunes. The
text: boys walk after him in single file.
text: They reach the top of the dunes. Carl stops. He looks
text: out across the sea and down to the beach. Despite the
text: bunkers and all the barbwire spread out along the beach,
text: it is a stunning sight for Carl and the boys. Waves crash
text: onto the beach.
text: Carl walks down the dunes and onto the beach itself. The
text: boys follow. Single file. He climbs onto a bunker, 6
text: meters up.
scene_heading: EXT. BUNKER - DAY 20
text: Carl is standing on top of the bunker looking down.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Come up here.
text: The boys climb up.
text: Carl is balanced on the very edge of the bunker. He leans
text: into the wind. The wind is strong enough to hold him at
text: an angle without him falling over.
text: Carl looks back at the boys. He smiles.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Can you see the black flag down
dialog: there?
text: Carl points to the north along the beach. The boys look
text: for the flag. They see it. It is a long way away. At
dialog: least 500 meters.
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Carl turns around and looks south. He points again.
text: Down the beach is another flag.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: In the area between those flags
text: and the road are 22.000 mines.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: You will disarm all of them. You
dialog: do this, and you get to go home.
dialog: Do you understand? Then you can
dialog: go home. But not a second before.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: With six mines an hour, and
dialog: provided you don't blow yourselves
dialog: up, it will take you three months.
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: The boys grimace despairingly.
text: Carl turns and look at Sebastian. Sebastian looks at him
text: skeptically. Carl goes over to him.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Do you want to say something?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Absolutely sure, sir!
text: Carl looks at the boys. He stands there for a while.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Do I need to point out what happens
dialog: to anyone who tries to escape?
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: No, sir!
dialog: Cut to:
text: The boys are ready with long sticks and long yarns of
text: string. Carl is crouching on the sand. He scoops away
text: some sand to reveal a wooden beam just below the sand.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Can everyone see these?
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: CARL
text: These rafters run from the dunes
text: down towards the sea approximately
dialog: every 150 meters. You can step
dialog: safely up to 1 meter on either
text: side of such a rafter. Some are
text: almost impossible to see, some
dialog: have rotted away. You must find
dialog: every single one of these rafters
dialog: in the area, before we begin. It
dialog: is absolutely essential that we
text: clear the beach systematically in
text: a precise grid.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: You start by clearing out a safe
dialog: path here. We need a passage
dialog: from here and all the way up to
dialog: the dunes. Is that understood?
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: Yes, sir.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: You. Yes, you with the map.
text: Carl looks at Ludvig.
speaker_heading: LUDVIG
dialog: Ludvig, sir.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Come here.
text: Ludvig quickly goes over and stands to attention in front
dialog: of Carl.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Did they teach you to read maps
dialog: in your training?
speaker_heading: LUDVIG
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: What is the name of the area we
dialog: are standing in right now?
text: Ludvig looks down at the map. Not sure.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Guess!
speaker_heading: LUDVIG
dialog: Area number 3, Sir!?
text: Carl smiles.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Try again. This time give me the
dialog: correct answer.
text: Ludvig is sweating nervously.
text: Sebastian next to Ludvig points to area number 7 on the
text: map. Carl sees this, but makes no comment.
speaker_heading: LUDVIG
dialog: Area number 7, sir.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Correct! And how many mines are
dialog: buried within this area, according
dialog: to the map?
text: Ludvig looks at the map. He is not sure. He looks to
dialog: Sebastian for help.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: We want an answer today, Ludvig.
text: Ludvig spots a number next to area 7, but he is still not
dialog: sure.
speaker_heading: LUDVIG
dialog: 1200 mines, sir!?
text: Carl smiles.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Correct! This area is to be your
dialog: main throughway, your safe zone
dialog: to and from the beach. From here
dialog: we work our way into the other
dialog: areas. We always use this passage
dialog: when going up to the house or
dialog: carrying disarmed mines up to the
text: pickup point by the road. No
text: shortcuts through other areas.
dialog: Is this clear to everyone?
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: Yes, sergeant!
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: There are mine maps for almost
dialog: all. the areas.
text: The boys are standing around him as Carl points to the
dialog: map.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: The area is defined by a number -
dialog: the dots or stars tell us what
dialog: type of mine we are dealing with.
dialog: The number is always in the left
dialog: corner.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Those of you who will be in charge
dialog: of the count must make sure that
dialog: these mine maps are always up-to-
dialog: date. This task is as important
dialog: as the de-mining itself. Don't
dialog: you ever forget that!! This map
dialog: is the only thing, that proves
dialog: that a given area has been cleared
dialog: of mines. Do you understand?
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Helmut walks a few steps into the sand to get a better
dialog: look.
text: Carl sees it. He lets him stand like that for a moment.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Stop!
text: Helmut stops and turns.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: What is your name, soldier?
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: Helmut, sir.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Helmut ..
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: Yes, sir?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Helmut, are you stupid?
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Well, do you have a death wish?
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: No, sir.
text: Carl looks really irritated at Helmut.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: How many meters from the raft did
dialog: I say?
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: One meter, sir!
text: Helmut looks down. He realizes that he has walked 3-4
text: meters onto the beach.
text: Helmut freezes. Carl turns around and walks away. From
text: a safe distance he shouts.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: The rest of you, come with me.
text: The boys look at Helmut and then follow Carl.
text: Otto, Carl's dog, stays and looks at Helmut.
dialog: 21
dialog: 22
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: Here boy, come here, boy.
text: Carl whistles. Otto turns around and runs to Carl and
text: the other boys.
text: Helmut just stands there for a while. Then he nervously
text: walks back towards safety.
dialog: Cut to:
text: Carl with the boys up by the road.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: You.
text: Carl points to Sebastian.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Repeat!
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: This is where we deposit the
dialog: disarmed mines that we do not
dialog: detonate ourselves. The teller
dialog: mines are to be lined up in
text: straight lines of 25 each. With
text: the front of the mine pointing
dialog: forward.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Always remember the mine count
dialog: and take down the precise number.
dialog: Every time.
text: Carl stands a while. Then smiles.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Good.
scene_heading: EXT. DUNES - EVENING 21

dialog: speaks.
text: We see the other boys doing the same.
scene_heading: INT. FISHING HUT - EVENING 22
text: Sebastian and Wilhelm are standing in the door way of
text: their sleeping quarters, the tiny fishing hut. It isa

dialog: 31.
text: They place the blocks of peat on the bunk beds, to sleep

speaker_heading: WILHELM
dialog: This is not so bad ... this whole
dialog: thing.
text: Sebastian doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: WILHELM (CONT'D)
dialog: So what are you going to do when

text: Sebastian doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: WILHELM (CONT'D)
dialog: I am going to be a machinist. My

dialog: real nice place. He will take me
dialog: in as an apprentice.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: WILHELM (CONT'D)
dialog: That's good, right? He promised
dialog: me that I can start as soon as I
dialog: get back home.
text: Helmut smiles sarcastically.
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: Aren't you forgetting a minor
dialog: detail?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Stay out of this.
text: Wilhelm looks puzzled.
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: Why? He might as well understand
dialog: that his bright future is a fairy
dialog: tale fantasy.
speaker_heading: WILHELM
dialog: It is no fantasy. It is reality.
dialog: He already promised me.
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: And what if ...
text: Sebastian stops Helmut.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Stop it.
text: Wilhelm doesn't really understand what is going on.
dialog: 23
dialog: 32.
text: Helmut stays quiet. He shakes his head .
speaker_heading: WILHELM
dialog: (to Sebastian)
dialog: If you want, I could ask if he

dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: WILHELM (CONT'D)
dialog: Only if you want to?
text: Sebastian fakes interest.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Sure. Yeah. That would be great.
text: Wilhelm smiles. Helmut gets up and leaves. He shakes

speaker_heading: WILHELM
dialog: No problem. I will ask him. I
dialog: am sure they can use one more.
dialog: Especially when I tell them how
dialog: good you are.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: WILHELM (CONT'D)
dialog: Then we could go to work together

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN

scene_heading: INT/EXT. FISHING HUT - MORNING 28

dialog: The area they are in has already been precisely measured

text: They all cry out, they have all found one.
dialog: Total.
text: Panorama of the entire beach.
text: This task seems endless.
text: Foam from the salty waves tumbles playfully across the

dialog: ++» even beautiful.
scene_heading: EXT. GRAVEL ROAD / WEST COAST - DAY 30
text: Later. The sun is shining. It is very hot. Ludvig,
text: Werner and Ernst are dragging a trolley full of disarmed
text: mines along the gravel road. They can see Carl and his
text: dog further down the road. The trolley is heavy with its
text: load of disarmed mines.
speaker_heading: LUDVIG
dialog: First two things when I get back

speaker_heading: ERNST
dialog: Make money! Work and get rich,
dialog: right Werner?
speaker_heading: WERNER
dialog: That is correct, my friend.
speaker_heading: LUDVIG
dialog: What kind of work?
speaker_heading: ERNST
dialog: Bricklayers .. What else? The

dialog: ‘Werner, Ernst & Sons’.
speaker_heading: LUDVIG
dialog: And sons?
speaker_heading: ERNST
dialog: Yeah, when we have kids they will

speaker_heading: LUDVIG
dialog: But first: Beer and pussy, right?
text: They laugh.
dialog: Cut to:
text: Carl is showing the boys how to stack the mines correctly
text: by the side of the road.
text: Ludvig has accounted for the mines on the mine map.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: How many personnel mines?
speaker_heading: LUDVIG

speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you standing around for?
dialog: Get going!
text: The boys run off with the trolley.
text: Carl walks after them. The dog is by Carl's side at all
dialog: times.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - AFTERNOON 31
text: Later. Sebastian is disarming yet another mine. He is
text: sweating profusely now and his hands are shaking. He
text: almost messes it up. But he makes it.
dialog: 39.
text: Behind Sebastian are 9 disarmed mines already. He
dialog: carefully places the 10th one with the others
text: Helmut seems annoyed that Sebastian's speed. The others
dialog: are nowhere near as fast as Sebastian.
text: They are all belly down on the sand. Several have taken
text: off their uniforms in the intense heat.
text: Wilhelm the youngest of the boys are on top of the dunes.
text: He throws a handful of sand down onto the boy below in
text: the sand. The sand startles the boy. When he looks up.
text: Wilhelm ducks down out of sight.
text: William does it a few times. The boy finally gets up and
text: looks around. Still nothing to see.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Stop it! It is not funny!
text: No reply. Wilhelm is still ducked down out of sight. He
text: is clasping his mouth, in tears laughing.
speaker_heading: BOY (CONT'D)
dialog: I know that somebody is there ..
text: Wilhelm makes no reply. The boy gives up and goes back
dialog: to work.
text: A little while later Wilhelm is about to do it again.
text: This time Carl is standing right behind him. Carl pushes
text: Wilhelm with his leg, so he falls to the sand. He steps
text: on Wilhelm's hand, pushes it down into the sand. Wilhelm
text: is in pain. Carl looks at Wilhelm's pile or disarmed
dialog: mines: only two.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: You wanna stay here forever?
speaker_heading: WILHELM
dialog: No, sir.
text: Carl yells in Wilhelm's face.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Then stop playing and get to work!!
speaker_heading: WILHELM
dialog: Yes, Sergent!
text: Further down the beach we see several more German POV de-
text: mining platoons, they look like lines of tiny ants crawling
text: on the beach.
text: Suddenly we hear a thud from far away. A cloud of smoke
text: appears on the horizon. Cold fear runs through the veins
text: of the boys. A reminder of what happens, if they are not
dialog: careful.
dialog: 32
dialog: 40.
text: The boys get up. They look at the cloud of smoke. Then
text: they keep going. Nobody says anything. They know that
text: it could just as well have been one of them.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Six mines an hour!! Get on with
dialog: itl!
text: The boys lie down on the sand and get back to work.
scene_heading: EXT/INT. FISHING HUT - EVENING 32
text: Later. Outside the fishing hut. Some of the boys are
text: sitting outside. Wilhelm is sitting on an old fence trying
text: to use a leaf of grass to whistle.
text: Two other boys have a little throwing game going where
text: they take turns throwing stones into a boot.
text: The doors and windows to the hut are open. Sebastian is
text: lying down inside, looking out the window. He can see
text: the others outside. Sebastian is building a wooden frame.
text: The little girl (Elizabeth) from the farmhouse is walking
text: around just outside the barbwire surrounding the area of
text: the fishing hut. Sebastian smiles when he sees her.
text: She is dressed in a home made dress - vaguely resembling
text: a princess' gown. She is pushing an old-fashioned pale
text: blue baby stroller with a doll in it.
text: She walks up to the fence. She looks at the boys sitting
text: outside. Initially, the boys ignore her.
text: The twins Werner and Ernst are sitting next to each other.
text: Werner smiles at the girl.
text: Helmut is sitting close by. He looks at the twins.
text: The girl walks back and forth a couple of times. She
text: picks up her doll from the cart and shows it the boys.
text: The doll is very worn and almost all its hair has fallen
text: out. She strokes the doll's bald head.
text: She holds up the doll, so the boys can get a good look.
text: The girl moves the arm of the doll so it looks like it is
text: waving.
text: Werner waves back and smiles.
text: Suddenly the girl picks up a piece of bread and takes a
text: bite from it. She puts the bread back in the doll's pram.
text: Werner, one of the twins, sees this and goes to the fence.
text: Werner crouches down and smiles to the girl.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: WERNER (in German)
dialog: What is her name?
text: The girl looks at Werner, perplexed.
speaker_heading: WERNER (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you understand German?
text: The girl smiles.
speaker_heading: GIRL (in Danish)
text: Today is her birthday. She turns
dialog: five.
text: Werner knows that she doesn't understand him. But then
text: again, he also has no clue what she is saying either.
text: Sebastian can see and hear everything that is going on
text: outside.
speaker_heading: WERNER (in German)
dialog: Well, she is really cute.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: You can all attend her birthday
dialog: party, if you want. There will
dialog: be layered cake and hot chocolate.
text: Werner reaches through the fence and strokes the doll's
text: head. His other hand is reaching for the bread.
speaker_heading: GIRL (CONT'D)
text: She has a boo-boo. Look.
text: The girl points to a band-aid on the doll's leg.
text: Werner pulls his hand back and covers his mouth. The
text: girl smiles.
speaker_heading: GIRL (CONT'D)
dialog: Ow.
speaker_heading: WERNER (tysk)
dialog: I'll say. Ow, indeed.
text: Werner takes out a tiny strip of gauze from his pocket
text: and reaches for the doll. Through the barbwire.
speaker_heading: WERNER (CONT'D)
dialog: May I?
text: The girl hands him the doll. Werner carefully wraps the
text: doll's leg.
speaker_heading: WERNER (CONT'D)
dialog: There you go. As good as new.
text: The girl touches the gauze and smiles.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: WERNER (in German)
dialog: You are welcome.
text: Suddenly Karin, the girl's mother, is standing behind the
text: barbwire to the farmhouse.
speaker_heading: KARIN
dialog: Elizabeth. Elizabeth!! Get over
dialog: here right away!
text: Karin runs over and grabs the girl by the hand. Pulls
text: her away. Away from them.
speaker_heading: KARIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on.
text: The girl is resisting. She doesn't want to follow.
speaker_heading: KARIN (CONT'D)
dialog: What is wrong with you? Come
dialog: here!
text: Karin pulls the girl along. The girl reluctantly lets
text: herself be pulled away.
text: On the way back the little girl turns around and waves.
text: Werner waves back. He smiles at both of them. The mother
text: ignores him.
text: Werner straightens up and goes back and sit down. Helmut
text: gets up and stands directly in front of Werner.
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: We were told; No contact with
dialog: Danish civilians!
text: Werner ignores Helmut.
speaker_heading: HELMUT (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you deaf?
text: Sebastian looks out at them through the open door. Werner
text: gets up and stands in front of Helmut. He puts his face
text: an inch in front of Helmut's face.
speaker_heading: WERNER
dialog: Did you want something, Mr.
dialog: officer?
text: Helmut stands there a moment. Werner shows no fear. Helmut
text: turns around and goes into the fishing hut. From behind
text: his uniform Werner takes out the bread he took from the
text: girl. He tears it in half and gives Ernst half.
speaker_heading: WERNER (CONT'D)
dialog: Eat, brother.

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: You are good at making friends,
dialog: huh?
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: Mind your own business.

speaker_heading: HELMUT (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: HELMUT (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: No, I don't think you do. But

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN

scene_heading: EXT. FISHING HUT - EVENING 37
text: The boys are sitting outside looking across to the farm.

speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: I think Sebastian should do it.
text: None of the boys say anything. Sebastian looks at Helmut.
speaker_heading: HELMUT (CONT'D)
dialog: Those who want Sebastian to do it
dialog: raise your hands.
text: Only a couple of boys raise their hands.
speaker_heading: HELMUT (CONT'D)
dialog: What is with you guys?! Are you
dialog: not hungry?
dialog: (to Sebastian)
dialog: And you ... why don't you do
dialog: something? You think we don't

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: He has no food! Don't you get
dialog: it? And if he had food, he would
dialog: never give it to us! He doesn't
dialog: care about us. They all hate us.
dialog: Get it into your heads! We are

scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE - EVENING 38
text: Sebastian carefully opens the door.
dialog: 45.

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN

scene_heading: EXT. THE BEACH - MORNING

scene_heading: EXT. GRAVEL ROAD - MORNING
text: Meanwhile. Carl is up by the road. During the night,

speaker_heading: WILHELM
dialog: I am fine ... I am fine ...

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: That is good, Wilhelm, that is

speaker_heading: WILHELM
dialog: If I could just rest for bit.
dialog: Maybe just for an hour. Then
dialog: I'll be good to go ..
text: The other boys on the beach are frozen in their positions -
dialog: in their own areas.
text: Sebastian is calmly holding Wilhelm. Evidently this is
text: not the first time he has dealt with death and mayhem.
text: Sebastian looks up at Helmut, Ernst and Werner. He yells.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Help me!!
text: They do not react.
text: Sebastian starts to put pressure on the wounds to slow

text: standing a short distance away.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Helmut. I need your help. We

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: No, like this. Tightly, Okay?
dialog: You got him?

text: From the farmhouse Karin peers out his front door,
text: curiously. She quickly shuts the door once she realizes
dialog: what has happened.
text: Sebastian runs over to the jeep and finds a first aid
text: kit. He opens it. It is half empty. He empties the
text: contents of the bag on the ground. Other than a bit of
dialog: gauze there really isn't anything of use.
dialog: Cut to:
text: Sebastian applies pressure and wraps gauze on Wilhelm's
text: arms, trying to prevent him bleeding to death.
text: Sebastian yells for Carl.

speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Shh...
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Thank you, sir.
text: Carl doesn't say anything. He gets up and walks back.
text: Sebastian looks at Carl walking away. Did Carl help to
dialog: stop the screaming or because he actually felt sorry for
dialog: the boy?
scene_heading: EXT. FISHING HUT - DAY 52
text: Wilhelm is on the back of a military truck. A samaritan
text: is behind the wheel. Sebastian and Werner are looking

scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE / CARL'S ROOM - AFTERNOON 53
text: Later. Sebastian knocks on Carl's door. No answer.
text: Sebastian goes in. He is still covered in blood.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Sergent?
text: Carl is lying on the bed. He looks briefly over at
dialog: Sebastian.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: What did I tell you about the
dialog: farm being off limits?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I think we have a problem, sir.
dialog: 54
dialog: 53.
scene_heading: INT. FISHING HUT - DAY 54
text: Carl and Sebastian come in. Inside the boys are lying on
text: the floor and in the beds cramped up in fetal positions,
text: clutching their bellies. They are sweating and shaking.
text: In turns they scream and cramp up. It is a nightmarish
text: scene. They are all pale and seriously sick.
text: Both Sebastian and Carl are surprised.
text: In his bed Helmut props himself up on his elbow as they
dialog: enter.
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: Sergeant! Everything is my fault,
dialog: sir.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: What is? What happened?
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: It is my fault, sergeant. We
dialog: were all so hungry last night,
dialog: that I went over to the farm last
dialog: night and took some animal feed.
dialog: I am sure that is what made
dialog: everyone so sick.
text: Carl takes it in. Then he smacks Helmut hard across the
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: HELMUT (CONT'D)
dialog: I am so sorry, sir. I am the
dialog: only person to blame. We have
dialog: had no food for several days now.
dialog: Beat.
text: Carl looks furious. He looks around at the boys. Many
text: of them are throwing up onto the floor.
speaker_heading: HELMUT (CONT'D)
dialog: I am so sorry, sir.
text: Carl hits him again.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Shut up!!
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)

text: standing behind Carl. Karin comes to the door.
speaker_heading: KARIN
dialog: What is he doing here? I told
dialog: you that I want nothing to do
dialog: with them. No contact. That was
dialog: the deal.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Come with me.
scene_heading: INT. BARN - DAY 56
text: Carl pushes open the barn door. Carl and Sebastian enter.
text: Karin follows.
speaker_heading: KARIN
dialog: When I tell you, that there is
dialog: nothing edible in here, I am not
dialog: kidding.
text: They look around. Evidently it has been many years since
dialog: this was a farm with animals.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: They said that they had stolen
dialog: some animal feed from in here.
text: Karin walks down through the empty barn
speaker_heading: KARIN
dialog: As you can see, there is nothing
dialog: here.
text: Carl stops at the stairs leading to a small loft.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: What is up there?
speaker_heading: KARIN
dialog: What do you mean? This is the hay
dialog: loft.
text: They go up. Upstairs is a sack of very old animal feed.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: What is in that one?
text: Karin looks into the sack.
dialog: 57
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: KARIN
dialog: If they have eaten from this it
dialog: is no wonder they got sick. It
dialog: is full of rat shit. You see?
text: Karin picks some of it up in his hand. She shows it to
text: Carl and Sebastian. She can't help smiling.
speaker_heading: KARIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hell, that right here could kill
text: a horse.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: And what is funny about that?
speaker_heading: KARIN
dialog: So I finally did get me a few
dialog: Germans after all.
speaker_heading: KARIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, they can finish it off if
dialog: they like.
text: Carl and Sebastian leave.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY 57
text: Carl and Sebastian cross the yard. Karin and the little
text: girl are watching them from the door.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: What was she laughing about?
text: Carl stops. He looks at Sebastian.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Let me just clarify one thing for
dialog: you. You and I don't talk. You
dialog: understand? You don't speak to
dialog: me. I ask you, and the you answer.
dialog: And you address properly. Are we
dialog: clear?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Yes, sir!
text: Carl and Sebastian walk across the yard.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Why didn't you eat any of it?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: He didn't offer it to me, sergeant.
text: Carl acknowledges his answer.

scene_heading: EXT. FISHING HUT - DAY 59
text: The boys are lined up. They are drinking sea water. And
text: throwing up.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Listen up! You have eaten rat
dialog: shit. All of you. Which can be
dialog: fatal. So get it all out of you
dialog: system.
text: Sebastian helps out where he can.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes, I know. It is horrible.
dialog: But you have to swallow it. Drink
dialog: it down. empty those stomachs.
text: The boys vomit, emptying their stomachs. Carl is sitting

scene_heading: INT. FISHING HUT - AFTERNOON 60
text: Later. The boys are sleeping. Shaking, freezing, sweating.
dialog: Cut to:
text: Sebastian nails the two boards back around the back of

text: Carl follows him around, making sure it is done properly.
text: Nobody speaks.
scene_heading: EXT. FARM HOUSE / CARL'S ROOM - EVENING 61
dialog: 
text: Carl is drinking whisky, outside, alone. He throws a

scene_heading: EXT. FISHING HUT - EVENING 62
text: Carl is standing in front of Sebastian, who is sitting
text: outside.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Get inside!

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Permission to show you something,
dialog: sir?
text: Carl nods.
dialog: 63
dialog: 64
dialog: 57.
text: Sebastian goes into the hut and comes out with the frame
text: he built earlier. He has attached 4 strings to it so
dialog: they make 9 squares.
text: Sebastian puts the frame on the ground. He puts a stick
dialog: in each square.
text: Carl is impressed although he doesn't show it. This will
dialog: no doubt lessen the risk and make the de-mining work
dialog: easier.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I know how much the sergeant hate
dialog: us. And that the sergeant don't
dialog: care where we die of starvation
dialog: or get blown up by a mine. But I
dialog: believe that it will look much
dialog: better for you if we die on the
dialog: beach, de-mining ... Sir.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean the beach has to be cleared,
dialog: right?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Get in the house.
text: Sebastian stands there for a moment.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Get inside, I said!
text: Carl puts the board across the door to the hut. He stands
text: there for a moment. He walks back across the yard.
scene_heading: INT. FISHING HUT - CONTINUOUS 63
text: Sebastian is sitting inside the fishing hut looking at
dialog: the sick boys.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN / BARRACKS - MORNING 64
text: The following day. Carl walks down a long hallway. We
text: follow him from behind. He goes through a door and into
text: a kitchen. He is alone. Carl looks around. Then he
text: goes into the pantry. He fills a crate with potatoes,
text: onions and loaves of bread.
text: Suddenly a chef enters. He looks at Carl.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: What are you doing here?
dialog: 65
dialog: 66
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: What does it look like? I am
dialog: being the fucking gofer and picking
dialog: up the food you should have
text: delivered to the officers already.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: I haven't heard anything about
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Du you want to go and deliver it
dialog: yourself?
text: The chef doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: I didn't think so.
text: Carl smiles to the chef and leaves.
scene_heading: EXT. BARRACKS - MORNING 65

speaker_heading: NURSE (CONT'D)

scene_heading: EXT. FISHING HUT - MORNING 67
text: Carl puts the box of food in front of the fishing hut.
text: He unlocks the door and goes over to his own place.
dialog: Cut to:
text: Sebastian is ladling out food to the boys. It is a thick
text: broth of potatoes, onions and bread. They all look better
text: already. He boys sit outside the hut. They wolf down
text: the food as if it was their last meal ever.
text: Sebastian looks thankfully over at Carl who sits some
text: distance away looking at them.
dialog: Cut to:
text: Later. Carl is now over by the fishing hut.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Attention, everyone ..!
text: The boys look up.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: I have good news and bad news.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: The good news is that I have just
dialog: been to see Wilhelm. They are
text: taking good care of him and he is
dialog: well, considering the
dialog: circumstances. The most important
dialog: thing is that he will survive.
dialog: And as soon as he is well enough,
dialog: he will go back to his family.
dialog: He sends his regards to you all.
text: Helmut looks relieved. The boys are happy.
text: Carl stands there a moment looking at the boys.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: The bad news is that we are far
dialog: behind on our schedule, and we
dialog: have to sped up a lot. We will
dialog: be doing long shifts with a minimum
dialog: of 8 mines an hour for the rest
dialog: of the week.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Understood?
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: Yes, sir!
dialog: 68
dialog: 69
dialog: 70
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Be ready in ten minutes.
text: The boys get up and run into the house to get ready.
text: Carl looks at Sebastian. There is something about his
dialog: gaze.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BEACH / THE DUNES - DAY 68
text: The boys are once more clearing mines. Their pace is
text: quicker now. It seems like they have been re-energized.
text: And they are using Sebastian's new invention, the frames.
text: Carl walks around among them. He shouts:
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Eight mines an hour!! Tempo!
dialog: Cut to:
text: Carl whistles loudly. That is the signal for the end of
dialog: the shift.
dialog: Cut to:
text: the boys are walking through the dunes. Towards the

scene_heading: EXT. FISHING HUT - EVENING 69
text: Carl locks the door to the fishing hut.
dialog: Fade to black
dialog: Cut to:
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE / CARL'S ROOM - NIGHT 70
dialog: 
text: A few days later. Carl is lying on his bed. He is asleep.
text: An empty whisky bottle is on the table. A half-naked
dialog: woman (one we haven't seen before)
text: We hear a lot of noise coming from the yard out in front.
text: People are laughing and yelling.
text: Carl wakes up and gets up with great difficulty. He opens
text: the door and looks out. By the hut is a truck and two
text: jeeps.
text: Carl looks at the woman who is rummaging around for her
dialog: clothes.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: You just stay there until I tell
dialog: you you can go! Do you understand?
text: Carl puts on his uniform and goes outside.
dialog: 71
dialog: 61.
scene_heading: EXT. FISHING HUT - EVENING 71
text: In front of the fishing hut Ebbe and a group of high-
text: ranking Danish and British officers are standing in a
text: circle. They are laughing loudly and are obviously drunk.
text: Ludvig is on his knees in the circle. In front of him is
text: an English officer. He is pissing all over Ludvig's face.
text: Carl comes over.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Good evening, Carl..
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: What the hell are you doing?
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: What we are doing? What does it
dialog: look like, Carl?
text: Ebbe grabs Carl by the shoulders in a friendly manner.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: We are having a bit of fun.
text: Carl doesn't comment on Ebbe's comment.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I'll say..
text: Ebbe smiles.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Right?
text: Another officer steps into the circle and starts peeing
text: on Ludvig's face. The officer is laughing.
text: Carl is looking on. Sebastian and the other boys are
text: standing just near by.
text: One of the officers takes out his hand gun. He aims it
text: at the boys. He changes his aim from boy to boy.
text: A third officer steps forward to piss on Ludvig. He pulls
text: out his dick, but nothing comes out. He can't piss. The
text: others laugh.
scene_heading: BRITISH SOLDIER
dialog: Shit in his mouth instead!
text: The others laugh.
text: The officer laughs and pulls his pants down and turns
text: around. He sits places his ass over Ludvig's face.
speaker_heading: OFFICER GARTH
dialog: Open your mouth, Nazi boy!!
dialog: 62.
text: Ludvig is crying.
text: Carl looks around at this madness. Something inside a
text: transformation takes place. He is repulsed by these Danish
dialog: and British officers.
text: The officer with the gun goes over and points it at Ludvig.
speaker_heading: OFFICER GIVENS
dialog: Do as your fucking told, Nazi
dialog: boy!! Open your goddamn mouth!!
text: Ludvig opens his mouth.
text: The others are laughing loudly. Sebastian jumps in and
dialog: protects Ludvig.
speaker_heading: OFFICER GIVENS (CONT'D)
dialog: Aww, isn't that sweet. Two nazi
dialog: brothers looking out for each
dialog: other.. Think I won't just shoot
dialog: you both?
text: The officer puts the gun to Sebastian's head.
speaker_heading: OFFICER GIVENS (CONT'D)
dialog: How ‘bout I start with you, eh?
text: Suddenly Carl steps in. He puts his hand on the gun.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: As much as I would like to see
dialog: him dead too, I need him on the
dialog: beach..
dialog: Beat.
text: The British officer turns around a sends Carl a look.
text: Carl smiles back to him. He is calm.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: I need him down there, okay? I
dialog: need all of these boys down there.
dialog: 6 mines an hour, remember?
text: Carl points towards the beach. After a while the officer
text: smiles at Carl.
speaker_heading: OFFICER GIVENS
dialog: Just having a laugh, eh?
text: He pats Carl on the shoulder. He shouts to the others.
speaker_heading: OFFICER GIVENS (CONT'D)
dialog: Alright, we should get going,
dialog: boys.
dialog: Cut to:
dialog: 63.
text: Carl is next to Ebbe and the Brits behind a truck. On
text: the back is a bunch of metal detectors. A guy takes a
text: few of them and drops them on the ground.
text: Ebbe and Carl are standing next to each other.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: This is not cool, Ebbe.. I had
dialog: just managed to get a real good
text: pace going on the beach..
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: What is this I hear about you
dialog: picking up food for the Germans?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Yeah? Where did you hear that?
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Is it true, though?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I picked up some food for myself.
dialog: I have a healthy appetite... And
dialog: a few bits for my dog.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: If I were you I wouldn't even
dialog: think about doing that again. It
dialog: upsets people, you know? They
dialog: get uptight.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: You mean it upsets you?
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Maybe I just find it very peculiar
dialog: that you need to go and get food,
dialog: when we are paying the old farmer
dialog: here very generously for your
text: board and lodging.
text: Ebbe doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you hear what I am saying,
dialog: Carl?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Yeah, yeah. I hear you, Ebbe.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Hey, look at me when I am talking
dialog: to you!
text: Carl turns to Ebbe.
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I hear you ... And now I see you
dialog: too .. Do you hear me?
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: You forgot to tell me that I would
dialog: be given a bunch of German kids.
dialog: That pretty much changes the whole
dialog: damn situation, don't you think?
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Does it? I don't see why. If
dialog: they were old enough to go to
dialog: war, they are old enough to clean
text: up after it.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I want you to help me get some
dialog: older and more experienced men
dialog: for my unit.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Do you know what they call it
dialog: when a child steals?
text: Carl smiles.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, you know this one?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: You are not answering my request.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Yes I am. Just listen carefully.
text: Ebbe smiles.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: If a child steals, it is called a
dialog: ‘mania’. Right? If grown-ups
dialog: steal, it is 'klepto-mania'. You
dialog: with me so far?
text: Ebbe smiles.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: But what is it called when a
dialog: country steals?
text: Ebbe provides the answer.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: ‘Ger-mania'!
text: He bellows with laughter at his own joke. Carl is stone
dialog: faced.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: None of these boys have a clue
dialog: about what they are doing...
text: Ebbe smiles.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Well, you will just have to teach
dialog: them then, won't you? After all,
dialog: that is why you are here..
text: Ebbe smiles and looks at Carl.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: They are Germans, Carl. Young,
dialog: old ... all Germans. Relax.
dialog: Enjoy life, for christ's sake..
dialog: It is just a bit of payback, right?
dialog: If we lose a couple here and there,
dialog: so be it. It is part of the job.
text: Ebbe smiles to Carl.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: You haven't started caring about
dialog: the enemy have you?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Fuck no. I mean, they don't mean
dialog: shit to me.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Good. Better them than us, right?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Yeah .. Hell, yeah.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Good, Carl. You had me worried
dialog: there for a second..
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: No, no. It's all good, you know?
text: Carl clenches his fist. Ebbe sees.
text: Ebbe looks at Carl. He pats him on the shoulder.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: See you later, my friend. Enjoy
dialog: your Saturday...

speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Get rid of it.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: But?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Now!!
text: The two guards crawl over the ditch and start taking down
dialog: the scarecrow.
text: Carl looks over at a big stack of disarmed mines by the

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I would like to thank you, sir.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: For pretending to look out for
dialog: us, sir.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: You think I don't mean it?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: It doesn't matter that much, sir.
dialog: It helps them. That is what is
dialog: important.
text: They sit for a moment.
speaker_heading: CARL

text: looks at carl.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: It was for the best, Sergent.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CARL

speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Does it help you?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Sometimes.. Sir.
text: sits a while, then he takes off the necklace
dialog: it to Carl.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Try holding it, sir.
text: smiles.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: No, thanks.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Yes, go on, sir. Try holding it.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: No, thanks.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Really, take it, sir. Try holding

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: BOOM!

dialog: 74
dialog: 75
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: My dad gave it to me. That is the
dialog: main reason I wear it. He always
dialog: did that. Gave me a fright every

dialog: it.
text: They sit a while without saying anything. Carl gets up.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Good night, Sebastian.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Good night, sergeant.
text: Carl gets up and leaves.

scene_heading: EXT. FISHING HUT - EVENING 74
text: Carl puts the board across the door to the hut. He stands

text: back to the farm.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BEACH/THE DUNES - DAY 75
text: The following day. Sebastian is on the beach. The sun is
text: shining. He is disarming a mine and is about to lift it
text: up, when he sees another mine just underneath it. Two
text: mines on top of each other.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Shit!
text: Sebastian puts it back carefully. He gets up and shouts
text: to the others. They can't hear him.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ludvig! Stop! There are two mines
dialog: on top of each other!
text: Ludvig hears him and stops.
speaker_heading: LUDVIG
dialog: What is the matter, Sebastian?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: They've put two mines on top of

speaker_heading: LUDVIG
dialog: What? I can't hear you.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Werner and Ernst (the twins) are far away. They are doing

dialog: Ahh.. I got you, you little
dialog: bastard.
text: Ernst suddenly hears the other boys shouting at them.
speaker_heading: ERNST
dialog: Hey, Werner, stop. The others

dialog: wrong.
text: Werner keeps on working.
text: Werner lifts up the mine. He smiles. Suddenly his facial

text: Werner looks over at his twin brother, Ernst. An enormous
text: explosion goes off. The effect of two mines. Werner
text: evaporates.
text: Ernst's face gets splattered by the blood and flesh of
text: his own brother. He is stunned. Then he jumps up and
text: runs desperately over to Werner's area.
text: He looks for his brother, calls out his name. Werner is

text: the mine field, confused, shocked looking for pieces of
dialog: his twin brother.
text: He screams. Ludvig and Sebastian come over. They
text: overpower Ernst and hold him down.
text: Helmut who has seen everything just sits there, stunned,
text: his hands keep on working, though.
text: Out of the corner of his eye, he sees a piece of Werner's
text: body stuck in a low sand pine tree just off to his side.
text: Helmut works faster and faster.
text: Sebastian runs over and try to stop him.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN

speaker_heading: HELMUT

speaker_heading: HELMUT (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you want? What do you
dialog: want from me?!! You have
dialog: everything. Do you understand!
dialog: You have won!
text: Helmut sits down and begins working. He is crying.
text: Carl comes running.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: That is enough, soldier! You are
dialog: a danger to us all, when you are
dialog: digging like that!
text: Helmut keeps digging. Carl draws his gun. He points it
dialog: at Helmut.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop or I will shoot you!
text: Sebastian gets up.
text: He speaks calmly.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Helmut. Stop. You hear me? Stop
dialog: digging.
text: Helmut stops digging.
text: Sebastian sits down and holds him. Helmut breaks down
text: crying.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Helmut, look at me.
text: Helmut can't look at him.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Helmut, look at me. It is okay.
dialog: You hear? It is okay. We need
dialog: your strength now. I need you.
dialog: You hear? We must stand by each
dialog: other now, right?
text: Helmut looks up.
text: Helmut believes him. He smiles through his tears.
text: Carl looks at them. And at Sebastian. Then he finally
text: lowers the gun.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BEACH - DAY 76
text: Later. Four of the boys are carefully walking in the
text: minefield picking up the bits and pieces of Werner. They

scene_heading: INT. FISHING HUT - AFTERNOON 78

speaker_heading: ERNST
dialog: Sergent. Is that you? Have you
dialog: found my brother? We have to go
dialog: down and get him. We can still
dialog: save him.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: We will look again tomorrow, it

speaker_heading: ERNST

dialog: Fade to Black.
scene_heading: EXT. GRAVEL ROAD / WEST COAST - DAY 79
text: A jeep stops. Two young German boys (Gustav(19), Albert
text: (17)) that we haven't seen earlier sit in the back.
text: The jeep drives off.
text: The two German boys look around. Everything is quiet.
text: They are standing just outside the guards and the barbwire
dialog: fence.
text: They gather themselves and go through the gate. Down the
text: gravel road. Down towards the dunes and the sea. Towards
text: the fishing hut.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BEACH - CONTINUOUS 80
text: The boys are in the shallow of the sea. Carl's hund is

dialog: 72.
text: The two new boys are standing on top of a dune. Carl
text: sees them. He calls Ludvig.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Ludvig!
text: Ludvig looks up at Carl. Carl points to the two new guys.
text: Ludvig runs up to them.
speaker_heading: LUDVIG
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: GUSTAV
dialog: Hello. Is this the de-mining
dialog: unit?
speaker_heading: LUDVIG
dialog: Yes.. We are it.
speaker_heading: GUSTAV
dialog: We are supposed to join your
dialog: platoon. Where is Sergent
dialog: Rasmussen?
speaker_heading: LUDVIG
dialog: Yeah, that is him over there.
dialog: But you can report to me.

speaker_heading: LUDVIG

dialog: Are you?
dialog: 81
dialog: 73.
text: The smile at each other.
speaker_heading: HELMUT (CONT'D)
dialog: 1-2-3-Go!
text: Sebastian and Helmut race along in the wet sand near the
dialog: water.
text: The run. They are both very fast.
text: They have a bet going. Whoever reaches the black flag
text: down at the far end is the winner. It is a long way.
text: Helmut just gets there first. He grabs the flag and raises
text: it triumphantly.
text: Both Sebastian and Helmut collapse on the sand.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: You are crazy..
text: For the first time Helmut's smile is genuine.
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: Maybe..
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Peace?
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: Peace.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BEACH / DUNES - EARLY EVENING 81
dialog: 
text: Later. The two new boys, the old crew and Carl with his
text: dog are walking towards the dunes and the fishing hut.
text: Everyone is in high spirits. They are walking in area 7,
text: their safe passage that they cleared out initially. Carl
text: throws the tennis ball across a little stream that runs
text: down the beach. Otto runs to get it. Otto jumps through
text: the stream. He picks up the ball. And runs back towards
dialog: Carl.
text: Suddenly there is a huge explosion. Otto the dog stepped
text: on a mine.
text: Everything is dead quiet. The only sound is Otto
text: whimpering. The dog is not dead. Carl runs over. He
text: sits down. Holds the dog.
text: The boys stay in the background, watching. They don't
dialog: know what to do.
text: Helmut is about to go to them. Sebastian holds him back.
text: Carl lifts up the dog and walks, a lone figure, up towards
text: the fishing hut.
text: The boys just stand there. They don't know what to do.
dialog: 82
scene_heading: EXT. FISHING HUT - EARLY EVENING
text: A few moments later. When the boys carefully approach the
text: fishing hut, Carl is nowhere to be seen.
text: A shot rings out from the barn.
text: Helmut looks at Sebastian.
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: I think one of us should go over
text: to him.
text: Sebastian shakes his head.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Let's just leave him alone.
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: Leave him alone? Why? It was an
dialog: accident. Who knows what he might
dialog: do?
text: Suddenly the boys see Carl walking towards them. The
text: boys quickly get into their uniforms and lace up their
text: boots. They know this means trouble. The boys run out
dialog: and stand to attention.
text: Carl goes over and stands in front of Ludvig.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Private, Ludvig Hafke. You were
dialog: responsible for area number 7,
dialog: correct?
speaker_heading: LUDVIG
dialog: That is correct Sergeant. And
dialog: everything was accounted for!
dialog: 1.200 mines buried, 1.200 mines
dialog: found, disarmed and accounted
dialog: for, Sergeant!
text: Carl stands there. His expression has changed. He
text: suddenly has killer eyes. He moves his faces close to
text: Ludvig's. There is a lot of tension.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: But everything wasn't accounted
dialog: for, now was it? You miscounted,
dialog: didn't you, soldier?!
speaker_heading: LUDVIG
dialog: No, sergeant, sir. I counted
dialog: them several times to be sure,
text: Sergeant. 1.200 mines buried.
dialog: 1.200 mines taken out. Sir!
text: Carl knocks Ludvig over and places his knee right on his
dialog: chest.
dialog: 75.
text: He is squeezing hard on Ludvig's throat and neck, pinning
text: him down.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Are you calling me a liar?
text: The boys are very surprised at Carl's aggressive reaction.
text: The two new guys are shocked.
text: Tears well up in Ludvig's eyes. He can barely breathe.
speaker_heading: LUDVIG
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: It sounds to me like you are
dialog: calling me a liar, soldier?!
text: Ludvig can't breathe. He gasps.
text: Sebastian run over and pushes Carl off.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Stop it!!
text: Carl sits on the ground. Ludvig holds his neck. He is
text: crying.
speaker_heading: LUDVIG
dialog: (while sobbing)
dialog: No, sir. I am just saying ...
dialog: that maybe the mine maps are
dialog: incorrect?
text: Carl smiles a sinister smile. Just like he did a lot in
dialog: the beginning.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Maybe the maps are incorrect?
speaker_heading: LUDVIG
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Carl gets up. He goes over to Sebastian and punches him
text: in the face. Sebastian takes the punch and keeps quiet.
text: Carl looks at Sebastian, then he looks at all the boys.
text: He shakes his head.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Idiots! You are a bunch of German
dialog: idiots. All of you. You know
dialog: that? Idiots.
text: The boys just stand there. Carl just stands there. He
text: keeps shaking his head.
dialog: 83
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you think will happen
dialog: next?
text: None of the boys speak.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: How can we know for sure, that
dialog: there are no more mines in that
dialog: area? How can I guarantee that
dialog: the beach is safe?
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: We could do a re-count, sergeant?
dialog: See if the numbers add up?
text: Carl looks at Helmut. He yells.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Fuck if the numbers add up! What
dialog: good are the numbers now? Tell
dialog: me. Can you say for sure that
dialog: that area is secured?
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: No, sergeant.
text: Carl stands a while.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I have been too nice to you.
dialog: That is the problem. You have
dialog: taken advantage of me and my
dialog: generosity!
text: Then he turns around and goes to his room.
text: The boys stay where they are. They look at each other,
text: perplexed.
scene_heading: INT. FISHING HUT - NIGHT 83
text: The boys are inside the fishing hut. Helmut is cursing
text: and swearing. He looks at Ludvig, who is sitting next to
text: Ernst, who is still in his bed.
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: You idiot! You know that? This
dialog: is your fault!
text: Sebastian interferes.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Stop it, Helmut. It was an
dialog: accident.
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: No it wasn't. He miscounted.
dialog: 84
dialog: 77.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: HELMUT (CONT'D)
dialog: It was an act of stupidity. And
dialog: now we will all pay for it!
text: Nobody speaks.
speaker_heading: HELMUT (CONT'D)
dialog: You don't get it, do you? Nobody
dialog: gets it. He practically told us.
dialog: What will happen next? That dog
dialog: could have been either one of us.
dialog: How do you know, that he is not
dialog: going to punish us?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Because he is a good man.
text: Helmut rolls his eyes back.
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: A good man! What the fuck do you
dialog: know about that? Tell me!
text: Helmut gets up. He pushes Sebastian.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Don't do that.
text: Helmut pushes again.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop it.
text: Helmut pushes him once more.
text: The two boys jump each other. They fight hard for a long
dialog: time.
text: The other boys barely manage to separate them. Helmut
text: gets up and leaves the house. He heads down to the beach.
text: The other boys stay with Sebastian. Ludvig looks at
dialog: Sebastian
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop looking at me!
text: Ludvig looks away. Sebastian is furious.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING 84
text: Next day. Carl is digging a hole. He bends down and
text: carefully lowers the dead dog, Otto, into the hole.
text: All the boys are standing a little distance away. They
dialog: watch.
dialog: 85
dialog: 78.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BEACH - MORNING 85
text: Following day. Carl is in the dunes. He is looking down
text: onto the beach.
text: All the boys are lined up forming a long chain across the
text: beach. Their arms are interlinked. Two armed guards, we
text: haven't seen before, are standing behind them. The boys
text: look confused and scared.
text: Carl walks down there. He stands in front of them.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: A mine field is secure, when we
dialog: have found and disarmed the same
dialog: amount of mines as indicated by
dialog: the map. Correct?
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: Correct, sir!
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Not correct!! A mined area is
dialog: secure, when all the mines have
dialog: been removed. What happened
dialog: yesterday clearly indicates that
dialog: you have not done your job well
dialog: enough!!
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: Yes, sir!
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Do I need to remind you that a
dialog: civilian could have stepped on
dialog: that mine?!
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: No, sir!
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: From now on, every time you have
dialog: cleared an area, you will walk
dialog: through that area arm in arm,
dialog: side by side, and make sure that
dialog: no mistakes have been made. My
dialog: mistake was to place my trust in
dialog: you.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Are we clear?
text: The boys look at each other. They are terrified.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: I said, Are we clear?!
dialog: 86
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: Yes, sir!
speaker_heading: HELMUT (whispering)
dialog: I told you. He might as well line
text: us up against the wall and shoot
dialog: us ..
text: Carl hears him. He goes over to Helmut.
text: Carl punches him in the face.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Were you saying something, soldier?
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: No, Sergent!
text: Carl looks at the boys with and ice-cold stare.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Forward march!
text: The young boys walk in a daisy-chain across the entire de-
text: mined area. Fully aware that every step might literally
dialog: be their last.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: The entire beach. We will canvas
dialog: every inch of this beach until we
dialog: are sure.
text: Sebastian looks over towards Carl.
text: Carl turns his back to them and walks off. The two guards
dialog: stay.
scene_heading: EXT. BUNKER / THE BEACH - EVENING 86
text: Later. Carl is sitting on a bunker. He looks down at
text: the beach and the boys down there.
text: The boys are still marching arm in arm.
text: The two armed guards follow at a safe distance.
dialog: They have a lot more ground to cover.
text: One of the guards are talking to the boys. We see this
text: from Carl's point of view. The guard comes up to Carl.
speaker_heading: GUARD
text: Sergent. They are asking if they
dialog: can have a break. And some food?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: They can have some food when they
dialog: are done.
dialog: 87
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Carl sits and watches for a while. Then he gets up and
dialog: leaves.
scene_heading: INT. FISHING HUT - EVENING 87
text: Sebastian and the boys are sitting in the fishing hut.
text: They hear Carl put the board across the door and lock up.
text: The boys sit a while. Helmut looks around at all of them.
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: I say we get the fuck out of here
dialog: now. Before we all die.
text: Nobody says anything.
speaker_heading: HELMUT (CONT'D)
dialog: Hallo? You accept this?
dialog: Personally I would rather be shot
dialog: by the Brits, than walk on that
dialog: beach one more time.
text: Sebastian looks at him.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: We stay until its done. Then we
dialog: go home. That is the best option.
dialog: We finish our job. The sergeant
dialog: promised that we get to go home,
dialog: when we are done.
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: And you think he is a man of his
dialog: word?
text: Sebastian doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: HELMUT (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, I am getting the fuck out
dialog: of here. If anyone wants to come
dialog: along, they are welcome.
text: He looks around at the others. Nobody makes any response.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: You stay.
text: Helmut gets up.
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: If you want to do his march of
dialog: the dead, you are welcome. But
dialog: you don't tell me what to do.
dialog: Nobody does.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Yeah, that maybe so. But happens
dialog: to us when he sees that you are
dialog: gone? I cannot allow it.
speaker_heading: HELMUT
dialog: It is not up to you. I am
dialog: leaving!!
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: HELMUT (CONT'D)
dialog: You don't get it, do you? You
dialog: think he is your friend? He
dialog: detests you ... all of us! You
dialog: know the other de-mining units
dialog: use armored vehicles to check the
dialog: beaches? But us? We have to
dialog: walk. You think that is because
dialog: the sergeant is our friend?
text: Sebastian looks at the other boys.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Get hold of him. Tie him down..
text: The other boys look at Sebastian.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I said, Tie him down!
text: The other boys jump Helmut and ties him down on the bed.
text: He is yelling and screaming.
text: Sebastian stuffs a piece of cloth in his mouth.
speaker_heading: HELMUT
text: Mmmmmmm.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Are you going to shut up?
text: Helmut tries to get out but he is pinned down.
speaker_heading: HELMUT
text: Mmmmmmm.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I will only remove the cloth if
dialog: you are quiet. Will you be quiet?
text: Helmut nods.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you sure?
text: Helmut nods again. Sebastian takes out the gag. He looks
dialog: at Helmut.

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)

scene_heading: EXT. FARM HOUSE / CARL'S ROOM - MORNING 89

text: to Carl's room. Carl isn't there.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. FISHING HUT - MORNING 90
text: Karin tears off the board to the fishing hut and opens
text: the door. Karin is so out of breath that she can hardly
dialog: speak.
speaker_heading: KARIN (In Danish)
dialog: Where is the sergeant?
speaker_heading: KARIN (in Danish) (CONT'D)
dialog: Quick, quick, you must come and
dialog: help me.
text: The boys are just waking up. They all look befuddled at
text: each other. There is no reaction from Ernst, who is still
text: in his own world.
speaker_heading: HELMUT (In German)
dialog: What is she saying?
text: Ludvig unties Helmut.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: KARIN
dialog: (in Danish)
dialog: Where is the Sergeant?!!
text: Karin looks around frantically. Then she runs back out
dialog: again.
scene_heading: EXT. DUNES / THE BEACH - MORNING 91
text: The boys are running towards the beach. Through the dunes.
text: Karin is running up ahead of them.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BEACH - MORNING 92
text: When they come down onto the beach they see, what is going
text: on. The little girl, Elizabeth, has walked out into one
text: of the mine fields that has not yet been de-mined.
dialog: 93
dialog: 94
dialog: 95
dialog: 83.
text: The girl is standing still. Frozen. She is holding her

scene_heading: EXT. FISHING HUT - MORNING 93
dialog: Total of the fishing hut.
text: The jeep drives up in front of it.
text: Carl gets out of the jeep and walks over to the fishing

scene_heading: INT. FISHING HUT - MORNING 94
text: Except from Ernst with his back to him, nobody is there.
text: Silence. Carl walks over to Ernst.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Where are the others, Ernst?
text: Ernst doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: The others. Where are they? How
dialog: did they get out??
dialog: Still nothing.
text: Carl pulls Ernst up from the bed.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Where are they, Ernst?! Have
dialog: they run away?
text: Ernst is blank.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BEACH - MORNING 95
text: When Carl gets to the dunes, he sees the boys.
text: By the time Carl gets down there, he knows what is going
dialog: on.
text: Sebastian and Helmut have already started clearing a
dialog: passage to the girl.
text: They are going as fast as they can. Struggling. Sebastian
text: turns around.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: It is going to take a while..
text: Suddenly the girl starts moving. Everyone starts yelling!
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: Sit down!
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: KARIN
dialog: You have to sit down, my little
dialog: darling!
text: The girl doesn't hear them. She smiles and waves.
text: Ernst suddenly appears behind the crowd. Nobody notices
dialog: him.
text: Suddenly he walks through the crowd. Past Carl. Past
text: the other boys. He steps over the barbwire and into the
text: fenced-off area.
text: Ernst walks into the mine field. Going in a straight
text: line. He walks past Sebastian, who is disarming a mine.
text: He heads straight towards the girl.
text: Everyone drops to the ground.
text: Sebastian stops working and looks up at Ernst, astounded.
text: But no mines go off and Ernst reaches the girl. He sits
text: down and smiles to her.
speaker_heading: ERNST (in German)
dialog: Shall I take a look at her?
text: The girls smiles, she thinks he is Werner to whom she
dialog: spoke earlier.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: You talk funny.
text: ERNST (pointing to the doll)
dialog: Boo-boo?
text: The girl smiles and hands Ernst the doll. Ernst looks at
text: the bandage around the doll's leg. It is dirty. Ernst
text: unwraps it. And gets out a new piece of gauze from his
dialog: pocket.
text: He is going to wrap the doll's left leg. The girl shakes
text: her head. Ernst understands. It is no longer the leg
text: which is injured.
dialog: Ernst tries various places. Right leg? Right arm? Left
text: arm? In the end Ernst and the girl agree, that the doll
text: needs her head bandaged. They help each other wrap the
text: doll's head.
text: The girl smiles. Ernst has tears in his eyes.
text: Meanwhile Sebastian has cleared a narrow path through the
text: mine field out to the girl and Ernst.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Ernst? Hand her to me.
text: Ernst lifts the girl up and passes her over to Sebastian.
dialog: 96
dialog: 85.
text: Sebastian carries her back.
text: Karin takes her.
text: Slowly everyone gets up. Ernst is still out there. He
text: looks at everyone and the mother, who is crying and
text: frantically hugging the girl.
text: Sebastian looks out towards Ernst.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you coming, Ernst?
text: Ernst looks at Sebastian for a long time. He smiles at
text: him. Sebastian returns the smile.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Come her, Ernst. Please.
text: All of a sudden. Ernst turns and walks on further into
text: the minefield. Ernst keeps walking. And walking ..
text: The others are shouting for him to stop. Sebastian is
text: about to run after him. Suddenly we hear a loud click.
text: Ernst looks down at his right leg. A shiver runs through
text: his body. He looks around. Looks back at the others.
text: At Sebastian. Somehow Ernst looks at ease, almost
dialog: relieved.
text: Explosion. Ernst is blown to bits. He is gone.
text: All that's left is a cloud of black smoke, slowly
text: dispersing in the wind.
text: Silence falls on the beach. We see the faces of the crowd.
text: Carl, Sebastian, the girl, Karin and all the boys. They
text: are quiet. The joy has been replaced by an eerie
dialog: emptiness.
dialog: CU Sebastian.
scene_heading: EXT. FISHING HUT - LATER 96

speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Where is Sebastian?

dialog: to Sebastian.
text: Carl stops. He looks at Sebastian who is sitting
text: motionlessly , staring vacantly into the air. Carl goes
text: over to him. He holds out his hand to Sebastian.
text: Sebastian ignores Carl completely. Carl leaves his hand
text: in front of Sebastian for a long while. In the end,
text: Sebastian slaps the hand away. Carl tries again.
dialog: 86.
text: Sebastian gets up. He looks angry. For the first time
text: Sebastian can no longer hold back his feelings. He pushes
text: Carl. Carl doesn't budge. Sebastian pushes him again.
text: Carl lets him. He is a lot bigger than Sebastian.
text: Sebastian is furious. Carl stands right in front of him.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Go ahead and hit me, if that is
dialog: what you want.
text: Sebastian lock eyes with Carl. Then he punches Carl in
text: the face. Carl doesn't budge.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Again. Do it again.
text: Sebastian hits Carl again. Carl still doesn't budge.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Again..
text: Sebastian shakes his head. A tear runs down his cheek.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN

dialog: understand.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Take it easy, Sebastian... You
dialog: are done soon. It is going to be
dialog: okay. Then you can go back home
dialog: again.
text: Carl finally lets go of Sebastian. Sebastian wipes his
text: eyes. He looks into Carl's eyes.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: You are right to hate me. I ama
dialog: very bad person. If you knew
dialog: some of the things I have done..
dialog: Oh, my God.
text: Sebastian breaks down completely. Carl holds him again.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: You did what you were told..
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: No.. I did more than that..
dialog: Much more.
text: Sebastian can hardly breathe.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: We all did..
dialog: Cut to:
text: We now see that Helmut is sitting inside the hut, just on
text: the other side of the wall. He has heard everything.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BEACH - MORNING 97
text: Carl is walking on the beach. He is carrying the same

scene_heading: EXT. FISHING HUT - MEANWHILE 99
text: Sebastian, Helmut, Ludvig and a forth German boy are
text: rolling up barbwire and depositing it in big piles ready

dialog: Cut to:
scene_heading: EXT. THE BEACH - CONTINUOUS 100

text: Carl comes running up to Sebastian and the boys. He stops
text: in his tracks. Flabbergasted.
text: All the mines on the truck have exploded. There are dead
text: bodies and loose body parts all over the place. The truck

scene_heading: INT. FISHING HUT - MORNING 102

speaker_heading: KARIN

scene_heading: INT. ARMY TRUCK - MORNING 103

scene_heading: INT. HQ BARRACKS - DAY 104
text: Later. Carl is walking quickly inside the HQ building
text: greeting a few people in passing. Evidently most of the

text: Carl stops in front of a young private.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Is he in?
speaker_heading: PRIVATE
dialog: Yes. Go right through.
text: Carl goes through another door.
speaker_heading: CARL

speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Smell that.
text: Ebbe breathes in deeply through the nose.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Can you smell it? The smell of
dialog: Denmark, of spring and summer.
dialog: It is going to be a great year.
dialog: Don't you think?
text: Carl smiles.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Yeah, a great year.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: You are probably wondering why
dialog: you have been summoned?
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: You can say that again.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: The reason that I am here, is
dialog: that we are going to need more
dialog: experienced men at Skallingen
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Yeah? Okay. I can do that. But
dialog: I thought you wanted me in
dialog: Ringsted?
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Oh, I do. I wasn't talking about
dialog: you.
text: Carl doesn't understand.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Okay.. So what are you saying?
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: We really need to reassign "your
dialog: German boys" down there. The
dialog: whole place is one big mess. All
dialog: the mines have shifted and they
dialog: need some skillful Germans with
text: experience. The men are dying by
text: the handfuls down there.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Yeah? Well, I wish I could help
dialog: you. But my unfortunately my
dialog: boys have already left.. They
dialog: have been shipped back to Germany
dialog: just this morning.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Yeah, I heard.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Out of 14, 4 made it.
text: Clearly Ebbe couldn't care less.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: "Your" German boys are not on
text: their way home, Carl.
text: Carl doesn't understand.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Like I said, we really need their
dialog: experience.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: And that is why they have been
dialog: reassigned to Skallingen. Which
dialog: is where they will remain until
dialog: all the mines down there have
dialog: been cleared.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: With all due respect, you promised
dialog: me that they would be allowed to
dialog: return home after clearing that
dialog: area. I made them a promise God
dialog: damn it! How does that make me
dialog: look. .?
text: Ebbe looks at Carl.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: There is nothing we can do about
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: What are you talking about? When
dialog: was this decided? I was
dialog: specifically told that these boys
dialog: could return home after their job
dialog: was done!!
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Carl. This isn't just your boys.
dialog: All German soldiers still in the
dialog: country are retained until all
dialog: the mines are gone. And I mean
dialog: all.
text: Carl stands there a few moments.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: God damn it, Ebbe.. I am asking
dialog: you as your friend. You and I
dialog: have been friends for how long?
dialog: I am begging you, just let those
dialog: four boys return home. Let them
dialog: go. They will die down there.
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Of course, you want them to go
dialog: home. I totally understand. But
dialog: unfortunately, the order has
text: already been carried out.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: It is only four boys, God damn
dialog: itl!
speaker_heading: EBBE
dialog: Now listen to me, Carl!
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 105
dialog: 106
dialog: 107
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't know what the fuck is
dialog: going on with you, but if I hear
dialog: one more word about those boys I
dialog: will personally go down to
dialog: Skallingen and shoot them myself.
dialog: You hear me?!!
text: Carl says nothing.
speaker_heading: EBBE (CONT'D)
dialog: You think these are nice boys!
dialog: They are not. They have been
text: brainwashed by monsters from early
dialog: on! You have no idea what they
dialog: have done in the war!
text: Carl goes over and grabs hold of Ebbe's neck. Ebbe can't
text: breathe. Carl really squeezes hard. He looks Ebbe
text: straight in the eyes.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: You lied to me.. I can tell just
dialog: by looking at you. You knew this
dialog: all along ... These boys are just
text: little boys, Ebbe. They cry out
dialog: for Mommy, when they are afraid,
dialog: or when their hands get blown
dialog: off. You understand? The tables
dialog: have turned. We are the monsters
dialog: now.
text: Carl lets go of Ebbe.
text: Carl turns around and leaves.
scene_heading: EXT. BARRACKS - LATER 105
text: Carl gets in the jeep. He is furious. He starts the
text: engine and drives off.
scene_heading: INT. CARL'S ROOM - DAY 106
text: Carl comes into his room. He sits down on his bed.
text: Carl pulls out a bottle of whisky from under his bed. He
text: opens the bottle and sits a while before he chugs from
dialog: the bottle.
text: He stares emptily into the air. We see his face.
text: He notices a little package on the table. He picks it up
text: and opens it. Inside is Sebastian's silver cross and a
text: note. The note says: "BOOM!"
scene_heading: EXT. OKSB@L CAMP / SKALLINGEN - DAY 107
text: Sebastian and the boys are now part of a new and much
text: larger platoon. They are standing to attention.
dialog: 108
dialog: 93.
text: An older Danish sergeant is standing in front of them.
text: All the other soldiers in the unit are older than
text: Sebastian, Helmut, Ludvig and the forth boy.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Welcome to the Oksbgl Camp and
dialog: Skallingen! We have reason to
dialog: believe that roughly 72.000 mines
dialog: have been laid down here on
dialog: Skallingen. So this place is not
dialog: for sissies
text: He grins.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT (CONT'D)
dialog: The reason I use the terms ‘reason
dialog: to believe' and 'roughly' is that
dialog: some of you have had the luxury
dialog: of having detailed mine maps at
dialog: your disposal... At Skallingen we
dialog: have no such maps!
text: The boys' faces have the look of betrayal written all
text: over them.
dialog: Zoom in on and CU of Sebastian. We stay with him for a
dialog: long time.
text: The sound fades down completely. We hear only Sebastian's
dialog: breathing.
text: Sebastian's POV. A soldier comes over to the sergeant.
text: He passes him a note. The sergeant looks irritated.
dialog: Cut to:
text: Sebastian wakes up when he is slapped in the face.
speaker_heading: SERGENT
dialog: Sebastian Schumann!!? Do you
dialog: hear me? Report to the mess hall
dialog: on the double!
text: Sebastian re-focuses his attention. He looks over at
text: Ludvig, Helmut and the 4th boy, who have already stepped
text: out of the ranks.
speaker_heading: SERGENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Get going. Now!
text: Sebastian goes over to the others. They leave.
scene_heading: EXT. MESS HALL SKALLINGEN - DAY 108
text: Sebastian and the others are heading to the mess hall. A
text: Danish soldier is there, behind a military truck. He
text: walks up them them.

text: Sebastian and the boys stop.
speaker_heading: DANISH SOLDIER (CONT'D)
dialog: Sebastian Schumann? Is that one
dialog: of you?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Yes, it is me.
text: The soldier lifts aside the truck's tarpaulin.
speaker_heading: DANISH SOLDIER
dialog: Get in..
text: Sebastian, Ludvig, Helmut and the forth boy are not sure
dialog: what is happening.
speaker_heading: DANISH SOLDIER (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, get in. We don't have
dialog: all day.
text: The boys climb into the back of the truck. They sit down.
text: The soldier closes the tarpaulin after them. He slams
text: the side of the truck with his hand. The truck starts up
text: and drives off.
text: Sebastian and the others look at each other, dumbfounded.
dialog: Cut to: (scene 108B)
text: Later. The truck stops. We hear the sound of the driver
text: opening the door, getting out and walking around to the
text: back of the truck. Ludvig looks nervously at Sebastian.
text: The tarpaulin is pulled aside. Carl appears.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Come on, get out.
text: The boys jump out. Carl points to the forest nearby.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: That way.. The border is a hundred
dialog: meters that way. Then you are in
dialog: Germany.
text: Sebastian looks at Carl. Carl looks back at him.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Run..
text: Sebastian and the boys run across the field.
text: CU Sebastian stops and looks back at Carl.
text: Sebastian and the boys disappear into the forest.
dialog: Fade to black.
