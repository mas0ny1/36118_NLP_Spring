dialog: Whiskey commercial shoot.
text: The set is full of activity as the JAPANESE CREW work. Bob,

text: The Director (with blue contact lenses) says a few long
dialog: sentences in Japanese.
text: TRANSLATOR, a middle-aged woman in a coordinated outfit,
text: translates but it is only a short sentence now.
speaker_heading: TRANSLATOR
dialog: He wants you to turn, look in camera
dialog: and say the lines.
text: Bob wonders what she's leaving out, or if that's the way it
dialog: works from Japanese to English.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: That's all he said?
speaker_heading: TRANSLATOR
dialog: Yes, turn to camera.
dialog: Bob thinks let's just get it over with.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Turn left or right?
text: The Translator blots her face with a tissue, and asks the
text: director in a Japanese sentence 5 times as long. The Director
text: answers her in a long excited phrase.
speaker_heading: TRANSLATOR
text: Right side. And with intensity.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Is that everything? It seemed like
dialog: he was saying a lot more.
text: The excited Director says more in Japanese. Translator nods

speaker_heading: TRANSLATOR
dialog: Could you do it slower, and with
dialog: more intensity?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Okay.
text: The Translator answers for him in four sentences.
text: ON THE MONITOR - we see the next take: the moody lighting

scene_heading: INT. BOB'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Bob comes back to his room. The maids have left everything
text: perfect, his beige bed is turned down, and the TV has been
text: left on to a channel playing a montage of flower close-ups
text: in nature while sad violin music plays. It's supposed to be
dialog: relaxing, but it's just sad.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Bob lies in bed. He flips through TV channels from the remote
text: control. He passes a Japanese game show, to an 80s Cannon
text: Ball run-type movie with him in it dubbed into Japanese. He
text: turns it off as he hears a knock at the door.
text: He goes to the door, and opens it part way.

text: Bob's POV - We see her back to us as she puts a CD on the
text: stereo - it begins to play: Serge Gainsberg and Brigitte

text: and shimmies over to Bob.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
text: (as she tries to
dialog: undress him)
dialog: Mr. Harris?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: WOMAN

speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: My stockings.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Take them.
text: He fumbles with her stockings, trying to do as she says.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: No - Lip them... Don't touch me!
text: He takes his hands back confused.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Lip my stockings!
text: He backs away, as he tries to understand her.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Lip them!
text: She throws her leg up to him on the bed.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Huh?
text: She pantomimes ripping them. He finally understands.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Oh, you want me to rip them?
text: He pulls at her stockings trying to rip them, but they just
dialog: snap.
text: She pretends to struggle.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Please let me go!
text: He pulls his hands away. She grabs them and puts them back
text: on her, and keeps struggling dramatically. They wrestle around
text: awkwardly, her pretending to try to get away, but not letting
text: him go. She rips her stockings and falls off the bed in fake-
dialog: defense.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Let me go!
text: She pulls a confused Bob down on top of her. He doesn't know
dialog: what she wants.
text: She rips another stocking and pins him on the ground. He
text: tries to crawl away, she grabs his leg and trips him. He
text: grabs a nearby table leg as he falls, the lamp crashes to
text: the floor, the room goes black.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I think you should leave.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY
text: In the harsh sunlight of the big windows Bob eats breakfast

dialog: and drink coffee.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ELEVATOR - DAY
text: Bob gets into the ded elevator. He is stopped momentarily by
text: the Concierge who asks him if everything is fine for his
dialog: stay.
text: In the elevator Bob's surrounded by JAPANESE BUSINESSPEOPLE
text: and a FAMILY dressed for a wedding.
text: Across, at the other side of the elevator he sees CHARLOTTE,
text: a pretty Ivy-league girl in her mid-twenties, and the only
text: other Westerner in the elevator. Her honey-colored hair stands
text: out in the crowd.
text: She's looking at him like you do when someone new comes in
text: the elevator, but the Japanese look straight ahead at the
text: elevator doors.
text: Charlotte and Bob look at each other across the Japanese
text: heads. She smiles, from one foreigner to another. The door

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT
text: Bob, still in his tuxedo and make-up from the shoot, sits
text: alone having a drink. A JAZZ BAND FROM SAUSALITO performs.
text: The SINGER is a middle-aged woman with red wavy hair, dressed

dialog: instruction panel'99 it is all in Japanese.
text: He pushes a button, and the machine starts beeping, then a
text: soothing woman's voice recites instructions in Japanese.
text: He gets on it, and sinks. He tries to make the arms and foot
text: peddles coordinate. He pushes a button and it starts moving
text: too fast. In an upward rotation he tries to reach the control
text: panel, but is not fast enough. The soothing woman's voice
dialog: continues instruction.(she occasionally includes an English
text: word- gently, gently...vigorous) He tries to keep up
text: with it, and tries again to push the right button to slow it

speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: I just don't know what I'm supposed

speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE

speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Did that help? Did you learn anything?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: We established that we have no

speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: We used to have fun, she used to
dialog: like to go to places with me for my

dialog: weirdos, but now she's tired of it
dialog: all. She never wants to leave the
dialog: kids, she doesn't need me, and they
dialog: don't need me, I feel like I'm in
dialog: the way. It gets complicated when
dialog: you have kids... that changes
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: That's too scary.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: When they're born its like Vietnam.
dialog: It's terrifying.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE

speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador
