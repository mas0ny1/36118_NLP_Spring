speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: Cards.
text: The four take them. Lick the back, slap them to their
text: foreheads -- two deuces (Jensen and Roque), a three
text: (Pooch), and an eight (Cougar). Pitiful cards.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENSEN
dialog: Got a feeling about this one, Roque.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: Your mama had that feeling too.
dialog: 
text: At which point, JENSEN PULLS A KNIFE...
dialog: 
text: ...and tosses it into the center of the circle. HIS BET.
text: Roque responds by tossing a .357 MAGNUM from his belt in.

speaker_heading: POOCH
speaker_heading: (INTRIGUED)
dialog: That the one with the hollow points?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: Yup.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POOCH
dialog: Oh, shit, I'm definitely in then.
dialog: 
text: He puts in a Desert Eagle. Jensen pulls a second, meaner

speaker_heading: JENSEN
dialog: This even me up?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: Exactly how many knives do you
dialog: have, anyway?
dialog: 
text: Jensen grins and STABS IT down into the pot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POOCH
dialog: Cougar - your bet.
dialog: 
text: The Silent Man stares at the others. Two deuces and a

speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, losers!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP PAN to
dialog: Clay. Mid-30's. Their leader, and you gotta be a bad-

speaker_heading: SMASH TO:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: POOCH
speaker_heading: (GRUMBLING)

speaker_heading: ROQUE
speaker_heading: (DISTASTE)

dialog: We don't get to pick what needs to

dialog: Quaeda-wannabe name of Fadhil is

speaker_heading: JENSEN
text: I'm shocked. Shocked, I say.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: We find it, we paint it for a laser
dialog: targeted bomb. No muss, no fuss.
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: For that we had to put on a
text: blindfold and turn around three
dialog: times?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POOCH
dialog: You'd rather take on fifty mujas
dialog: with AK's?

scene_heading: EXT. DESERT BLUFF -- AFTERNOON
dialog:

speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: I got eyes on Fadhil.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Paint it.
dialog: 
text: Pooch fires up the LASER DESIGNATOR and aims it at the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: POOCH
dialog: Call me Michelangelo.
dialog: 
text: Cougar sights down the LASER SCOPE of his LONG RIFLE.
text: Just taking in the scenery. Jensen, into a field radio:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENSEN
dialog: Dropkick, this is Pinball, confirmed
dialog: eyes on, target is designated.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. AFGHAN SKY -- DAY

scene_heading: EXT. DESERT BLUFF -- DAY

speaker_heading: JENSEN
dialog: Roger, we'll break out the earplugs.
dialog: (to the others)
dialog: So who wants to get a game? We
dialog: got eight minutes-
dialog: 
text: And then, for the first time COUGAR SPEAKS. With concern:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COUGAR
dialog: Boss?
dialog: 
text: Clay immediately looks THROUGH HIS SCOPE --
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
text: A GROUP OF CHILD-SLAVES on the ground BY THE PRISON,
text: being led off a truck. The others look too. Reacting:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Call it in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENSEN
speaker_heading: (INTO RADIO)
dialog: Dropkick, children are at target
dialog: site, repeat, we have eyes on
dialog: children at target site - advise.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RADIO VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Hold the line...
dialog: 
text: STATIC. Seconds tick by...
speaker_heading: RADIO VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
text: Acknowledged, maintain position.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: Maintain position? Colonel-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENSEN
speaker_heading: (INTO RADIO)
dialog: Dropkick, we strongly recommend
dialog: cancellation of payload delivery-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RADIO VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Abort order can only come from
scene_heading: MISSION CONTROLLER-
dialog: 
scene_heading: Clay GRABS THE RADIO from Jensen:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Mission Controller is Agency,
dialog: Codename Max, repeat, Codename Max,
dialog: so get him on the horn and-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RADIO VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Already have, Pinball, your orders
dialog: stand. Prep for exfil.
dialog: 
text: STATIC. A beat. The others stare at Clay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Cougar?
dialog: 
text: Cougar takes the butt of his rifle and SMASHES THE LASER
text: DESIGNATOR TO BITS! Clay, into the radio:
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Dropkick, this is Pinball, targeting
dialog: equipment has suffered system
dialog: failure, am calling an abort.
dialog: 
scene_heading: STATIC. Then, a DIFFERENT VOICE:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX (O.S.)
dialog: Well, that was stupid.
dialog: 
text: The voice is even. Distinctly unmilitary. Almost stoned.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Who is this? This is a secure
scene_heading: MILITARY NETWORK--
speaker_heading: MAX (O.S.)
dialog: Very stupid, Colonel... Franklin...
dialog: Clay.
dialog: 
text: Clay blinks - no one uses names on comms.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Max? There are children on site-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX (O.S.)
dialog: And you think I didn't know that?
dialog: Not the sharpest of knives in the
dialog: drawer, are you? We locked
dialog: coordinates the moment you painted;
dialog: delivery will occur on schedule.
dialog: Max out.
dialog: 
text: STATIC. Clay hits the send button to respond - gets a
text: SQUELCH. Cursing, tossing the radio to Jensen:
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Shit! Jensen, call the General at
dialog: the Firebase, get him to abort-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENSEN
dialog: Can't, they're jamming us-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: Then contact the plane directly-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENSEN
dialog: (trying all channels)
dialog: Negative, we're screwed!
speaker_heading: (LOOKING UP)
dialog: There's nothing we can do...
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
text: His face, stricken. They all are. And then:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: There's something we can do.
dialog: 
text: Clay hefts his rifle.
dialog: 
text: The others stare at him. Automatically begin checking
text: their own weapons. Roque runs it down for them:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: Five against a fortress, and we've
dialog: got maybe six minutes before an
text: airstrike sets the world on fire.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: So?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: So, I'll drive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. AL GHOZAR FORT -- DAY
dialog: 
text: WHAM! BAD GUYS firing wildly as our guys' HUMVEE PLOWS
dialog: through the GATE!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POOCH
dialog: I guess we're going with the fifty
dialog: mujas with AK's option after all!
dialog: 
text: A SERIES OF SHOTS -- We see just how good these guys are.
text: Cougar on his knee in the back -- snipes SINGLE SHOT KILLS --
text: takes out SEVEN MEN. Roque pulls to a halt in the center
text: of the compound -- Bad Guys, coming out of the woodwork
text: with AUTOMATIC WEAPONS. As the guys hop out:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
text: Pooch and Jensen, get a truck for
dialog: the kids, the rest of us will be
dialog: out in five-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
speaker_heading: (CHECKING WATCH)
dialog: -airstrike's in four and change-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: -out in four. On me!
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
text: Clay leads ZONE COVERAGE toward the building -- Roque and
text: Cougar run middle -- QUICK DEATH STRIKES. Images BLAST
text: fast and savage as these men KILL THEIR WAY INTO THE FORT.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. AL GHOZAR FORT - KHYBER PASS - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Roque calmly kicks in the door -- kills FIVE MEN sitting
text: around a table with TWO YOUNG GIRLS in the middle -- the
text: terrified girls run to him. The BAD GUYS have no chance --
text: Fast. Precise. SPECTACULAR. Our crew takes the fort.
dialog: 
text: MOVING THROUGH a tight hallway, they find the children
text: locked in a large empty room. They start leading them
text: out. One LITTLE BOY stops Clay. In PASHTUN:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LITTLE BOY
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Clay checks the time. 3 MINUTES TO AIRSTRIKE...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: (to Roque and Cougar)
dialog: Get 'em out.
dialog: 
text: Roque and Cougar hustle the kids toward the exit while
text: Clay moves DOWNSTAIRS into the darker sublevels...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. AL GHOZAR FORT -- DARKER SUBLEVEL -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Clay kicks in a door to find A MAN - Looming over a
text: SHACKLED BOY. Unbuckling his pants.
dialog: 
text: The Man pales. Realizing the American understands what
text: he was about to do, backing away, BEGGING IN PASHTUN:
speaker_heading: PERVERT
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Omar DOESN'T MOVE. Instead, he eerily raises his hand
text: and wordlessly POINTS TO A CELL. In the corner. And
text: Clay hears a MOAN emit from it. VAGUELY HUMAN.
dialog: 
text: Omar lowers his arm. Goes upstairs, dragging his bear.
dialog: 10.
dialog: 
text: Clay turns. Approaches the cell. Looks down into it...
text: it's clear from Clay's face that it's SOMETHING HORRIFIC.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SOMETHING HORRIFIC
dialog: ...shooooot meeee...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You're American?
dialog: 
scene_heading: SOMETHING HORRIFIC
dialog: ...Max sent you...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
speaker_heading: (SURPRISED)
dialog: How do you know that name?
scene_heading: SOMETHING HORRIFIC
dialog: ...was IA Field Ops hunting rogue
dialog: agents... Max caught me...
dialog: 
text: He torture rasps and spits small chunks of death...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Max is rogue?
dialog: 
text: Something Horrific leans forward out of the shadows...
dialog: 
scene_heading: SOMETHING HORRIFIC
dialog: You're off-mission aren't you?
dialog: 
text: Clay just stares.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOMETHING HORRIFIC (CONT'D)
dialog: What's the mission?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Fadhil.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SOMETHING HORRIFIC
dialog: Max doesn't care about Fadhil...
dialog: He's cleaning up the mess. You're
dialog: his mop. I'm the mission....
dialog: 
text: Clay's just staring into the burning, crazed eyes of
dialog: Something Horrific.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOMETHING HORRIFIC (CONT'D)
dialog: Kill me...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I can get you out-
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SOMETHING HORRIFIC
dialog: Already dead... Kill ME-
dialog: 
text: BLAM! A BULLET pierces what used to be left of Something
text: Horrific's CHEST. Not fired by Clay...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOMETHING HORRIFIC (CONT'D)
dialog: Thaaaank...
dialog: 
text: And he dies. Clay turns - COUGAR. Lowers his rifle.
dialog: Speaks one word.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COUGAR
dialog: Mercy.
dialog: 
text: Holds up his watch. 40 SECONDS LEFT. Speaks another:
speaker_heading: COUGAR (CONT'D)
dialog: Run.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. AL GHOZAR FORT -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Clay and Cougar BURST from the fort, FIRING and RUNNING
text: FULL TILT towards the commandeered TRUCK LOADED WITH KIDS.
text: As they leap into the back, Pooch hits the gas:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POOCH
dialog: Jesus, you stop for coffee in there?
dialog: 
text: As he RUNS OVER two Bad Guys trying to stop them at the
text: gate. The sound of a JET APPROACHING. Roque to Jensen:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: What kind of blast radius we looking
dialog: at?
text: Jensen, calculating on the computer tablet. Shows an
text: animation mock-up to Roque - huge blast radius. To Pooch:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE (CONT'D)
scene_heading: DRIVE. MUCH. FASTER.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SKIES ABOVE AL GHOZAR FORT -- DAY
dialog: 
text: The Fort and the retreating Truck below us mere specks as
text: the DESERT HAWK SWOOPS IN and RELEASES ITS PAYLOAD...
dialog: 
text: A moment of silence as it falls... and then STRIKES below,
text: an orange FIREBALL BALLOONING OUTWARDS...
dialog: 12.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TRUCK (MOVING) -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Ripping across the dunes, FIREBALL EXPANDING behind them...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENSEN
dialog: I think we're in the clear-
dialog: 
text: As the fireball ENGULFS THEM.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK (MOVING) -- DAY
dialog: 
text: IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIRESTORM: All Pooch can see is
text: FLAMES through the WINDSHIELD as they plow through the
text: destruction. Glances in the REAR-VIEW:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POOCH
dialog: Uh, Coug?
dialog: 
text: Cougar's sleeve, FULLY ABLAZE. He casually rips it off
text: and tosses it out the back.
dialog: 
text: THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD - The fire clears... to reveal a
text: 30 FOOT DROP. The guys scream as they PLUNGE OVER IT...
dialog: 
text: WHOOMP! The Truck buries itself nose first in the sand.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. AFGHAN DESERT -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Silence. Smoke rises from a crater that was once the
text: Fort. The doors of the truck creak open. Most of the
text: YOUNGSTERS GIGGLE. Fun ride. As the guys help them out:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENSEN
dialog: Yeah, that was great, wasn't it?
dialog: My favorite part was when we were
dialog: completely on fire. What was yours?
dialog: 
text: Sounds of a BLACKHAWK CHOPPER APPROACHING...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POOCH
dialog: Exfil incoming. How are we gonna
dialog: explain the kids, Colonel?
dialog: 
text: Clay doesn't seem to hear him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POOCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Colonel?
dialog: (Clay looks up)
dialog: The kids. What do we tell 'em?
dialog: 13.
dialog: 
text: A beat. Clay seems to shake off his daze as the BLACKHAWK
text: sets down. Walking up to the chopper:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Lieutenant, you're to evac these
dialog: civvies to the Firebase immediately-
dialog: 
scene_heading: BLACKHAWK PILOT
dialog: Negative, our orders are to
text: transport a five-man team only.
dialog: 
text: Clay's eyes dart down to the Pilot's neck. A SILVER
text: CRUCIFIX hangs around it. Clay, softer:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You really want to leave twenty
dialog: three kids in the desert to die?
dialog: 
text: A beat.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BLACKHAWK PILOT
dialog: Not enough room for them and you...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Then it's them.
dialog: 
text: The Pilot nods. Our guys begin loading the kids on...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENSEN
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Clay helps Omar on last. The kid looks at him. He knows
dialog: perfectly well what Clay saved him from in that basement.
speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Clay nods. A beat. The Pilot pulls the stick back and
text: the CHOPPER ASCENDS. The kids wave goodbye to our guys.
dialog: 
text: Omar, holding Clay's gaze as they rise. Only broken as
text: the chopper begins to recede into the distance. The last
text: Clay sees of him is that ratty little TEDDY BEAR...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POOCH
dialog: Cute little buggers. Hope they
dialog: can make it to our court-martial.
dialog: 14.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: Relax, Pooch, we're not going to
dialog: be court-martialed - if anything,
dialog: we're going to die of thirst
dialog: wandering the desert, right Colonel?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
speaker_heading: (IGNORES THIS)
dialog: Jensen, see if you can cut into
dialog: that Blackhawk's chatter--I want
dialog: to know if he rats us out.
dialog: 
text: As Jensen tunes his radio...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POOCH
dialog: So, how we getting back? Hitchhike?
dialog: Magic carpet? I say magic carpet...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
speaker_heading: (NOTICING)
dialog: Guess they hustled up some air
dialog: support after all - that's a
dialog: Pakistani MiG up there...
dialog: 
text: Jensen's tuning into the MIG's frequency. Looking nervous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENSEN
dialog: Guys... This is bad...
dialog: 
text: TURNS UP THE VOLUME:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIG PILOT (O.S.)
text: Max, Cobra One. Bandit locked,
dialog: twelve o'clock low...
text: Their eyes go wide with understanding....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX (O.S.)
text: Understood, Cobra One. Kill Bandit.
dialog: 
text: Clay and Cougar have ALREADY BEGUN RUNNING towards the

text: BEHIND THE BLACKHAWK....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIG PILOT (O.S.)
speaker_heading: (CALMLY)
dialog: Fox One.
dialog: 
text: WOOSH... The MIG FIRES - AIR TO AIR MISSILE... WHOOMP!
text: The Blackhawk's tail rotor SHEARED OFF, the chopper
text: spinning and falling but still intact...
dialog: 15.
dialog: 
text: Pooch, the pilot, from somewhere SCREAMING:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POOCH
dialog: Auto-rotate, go with it, you can
dialog: still put her down if you-
dialog: 
scene_heading: FROM THE RADIO:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX (O.S.)
dialog: And again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: NO!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIG PILOT (O.S.)
dialog: ...Fox Two.
text: The SECOND MISSILE from the MiG SLAMS INTO THE BLACKHAWK
text: proper. Burning, spinning... FALLING. Clay and Cougar,
text: screaming by the time they reach the wreck...
dialog: 
text: OMAR'S TEDDY BEAR, BLACKENING to a crisp. Clay tries to
text: dive into the flames, but COUGAR DRAGS HIM BACK. No use,
dialog: anyway...
dialog: 
text: Nothing's alive inside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SLAM TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PAKISTAN - KARACHI SAFE HOUSE -- DAY
dialog: 
text: A safe house. A LARGE MAN stands in the shadows, watching
text: as Roque, Jensen, Pooch, Cougar, and Clay yell back and
text: forth at FENNEL - a CIA Handler:
speaker_heading: FENNEL
dialog: What are you talking about "MAX?"
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: He set up the Operation-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FENNEL
dialog: There was no operation! You were
dialog: never radioed orders!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I talked to him!
dialog: 16.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FENNEL
dialog: You kill a friendly Afghan warlord,
dialog: probably lose us the support of
dialog: half the tribes in the region, and
dialog: your alibi is "MAX?"
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: Wait - are you saying you're Max?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FENNEL
dialog: Colonel, Max is an Agency code for
dialog: a rogue agent or operation-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: What are you talking-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARGE MAN (O.S.)
dialog: There is no specific Max.
dialog: 
text: The LARGE MAN finally steps out of the shadows. Special
dialog: Forces, like our guys. WADE. They know him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: "Max" is catch-all for exactly
dialog: what you've been accused of.
dialog: Terminology's been around since
dialog: the 50's.
dialog: 
text: Silence as the guys take this in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: We didn't kill those kids, Wade.
text: Wade studies him. Finally:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I believe you.
dialog: 
text: Fennel sighs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FENNEL
dialog: Stay here. We'll be back.
dialog: 
text: They watch Wade and Fennel leave. Now alone. SILENCE.
text: After a bit, Pooch looks down. Under a little table...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POOCH
text: Wade left his suitcase.
dialog: 17.
dialog: 
text: It hits them all at the same time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: Ah, shit...
dialog: 
text: They BOLT for the door. LOCKED. Run to the window.

speaker_heading: AISHA

speaker_heading: AISHA
dialog: It's not too tough if you know

dialog: exactly subtle.
dialog: 
text: A FIRE ENGINE screams past them towards the burning hotel,
text: as if to illustrate her point.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: How'd you know I was alive?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AISHA
dialog: Counted the number of teeth found

text: Not nearly enough for five men.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Who else knows?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AISHA
dialog: That you're alive? Just me.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: So what's to stop me from putting

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AISHA
dialog: You want Max and I can tell you

speaker_heading: CLAY

dialog: otherwise.
dialog:

speaker_heading: AISHA

speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: What a brilliant plan, and oh, so
dialog: simple too. What's the cargo?
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Right. So you want me to steal

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: At most--at most that was a "break

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FENNEL
text: As of this moment, the truck is

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIDDY
dialog: Understood and acknowledged, sir.

scene_heading: EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: A silenced AIR BLAST -- we TRAVEL FAST with Roque's

scene_heading: INT. TOWN CAR - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: EXT. CRESCENT CITY CONNECTION

scene_heading: EXT. CRESCENT CITY CONNECTION -- DAY

speaker_heading: THE CHASE VAN

speaker_heading: CONTROL (V.O.)

text: DEEP RUMBLING. Thick bass vibrations...
dialog: 
text: The thick tear gas being blown aside by the thunderous
text: twin-rotor downwash of a CHINOOK HEAVY LIFT CHOPPER!
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CRESCENT CITY CONNECTION -- UPPER SUPERSTRUCTURE

scene_heading: EXT. CRESCENT CITY CONNECTION -- DAY

scene_heading: INT. CHINOOK -- WINDOWLESS HOLD -- DAY

speaker_heading: FADE TO:

scene_heading: EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- EVENING

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CHINOOK -- WINDOWLESS HOLD -- EVENING
dialog: 
text: Fennel and the SWAT Guys try to maintain balance and

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FENNEL
dialog: We're down, okay! You go the second

scene_heading: EXT. CHINOOK -- EVENING
dialog: 
text: Aisha clambers onto the Chinook's hull, clutching a RUBBER

speaker_heading: AISHA
dialog: Open the valve.
dialog:

speaker_heading: SOLDIER 1
dialog: Sir, that smell! It's- gasoline!

dialog: Their EYES GO WIDE...
dialog: 
text: HYDRAULICS WHINE. The RAMP LOWERS. The gas drenched

dialog: 
text: CLAY STANDS ALONE. The men fan out around him. Multiple
text: rifles TRAINED AT HIS HEAD from every direction. Fennel
text: blinks, surprised to see him alive. Nevertheless:
dialog: 56.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FENNEL
dialog: Eat the ground, or they blow your
dialog: head off!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I don't think so.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FENNEL
dialog: First and only warning, Clay!
dialog: 
text: Clay calmly LIGHTS A CIGARETTE. TIGHT ON THE BURNING
text: CHERRY: The soldiers, wide eyed...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Gasoline. Muzzle flash. Think

dialog: 
text: GASOLINE DRIPS from the muzzle of his own tooled up H&amp;K

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Things'll kill you.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Good boys. Now, let's see what
dialog: kind of cargo you got in there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FENNEL
dialog: Clay, no bullshit - you open that

text: Clay steps up to him. Near nose to nose.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I'm already dead, remember?
dialog: 
text: WHAP! Clay's fist to Fennel's jaw. Knocking him cold.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: TIGHT ON FENNEL as he and the Team sit bound and gagged
text: in the back of the Chinook. As the ramp rises, he shoots
text: panicked glances to Clay. The ramp closes between them.
dialog: 
text: Clay turns back to
dialog: 57.
dialog: 
text: THE CRATE on the ground in front of our guys. Pooch and
text: Cougar hydro-pop the locks. OPEN TO REVEAL an interior
text: crate. Smaller, polished steel. A TEN DIGIT numeric
text: KEYPAD on top, and a LOGO STAMPED on the side - GOLIATH.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENSEN
dialog: Goliath the oil company?
dialog: 
text: Clay looks to Aisha.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AISHA

speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: Great. The super evil bad guy is

dialog: 
speaker_heading: POOCH
dialog: You want me to go ask Fennel the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENSEN
dialog: Nah, I can bypass no problem.
dialog:

speaker_heading: JENSEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Voila! Ten million dollars of

dialog: 
text: The second crate opens...

speaker_heading: POOCH

speaker_heading: CLAY

speaker_heading: JENSEN

speaker_heading: (OPENING LAPTOP)

speaker_heading: ROQUE
speaker_heading: SHOULD WE-

speaker_heading: POOCH

speaker_heading: CLAY

speaker_heading: AISHA
speaker_heading: (STRANGELY CALM)

speaker_heading: ROQUE

speaker_heading: AISHA

speaker_heading: AISHA

speaker_heading: ROQUE
speaker_heading: (FEVER PITCH)

speaker_heading: ROQUE
speaker_heading: (CONFUSED)

speaker_heading: CLAY

scene_heading: INT. CHINOOK -- WINDOWLESS HOLD -- NIGHT

speaker_heading: FENNEL

dialog: This is his solution!
dialog: 
text: Clay JAMS A GUN to his temple...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Elaborate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FENNEL
dialog: He wanted us to nuke a U.S. target,

dialog: freedom is on the march again!
dialog: The same people who want us to
dialog: pull back will be screaming to
dialog: turn the place into a parking lot!
speaker_heading: POOCH

speaker_heading: FENNEL
speaker_heading: I CAN'T-

text: They stare down at him in disbelief...
dialog: 62.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FENNEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm serious! It's his sense of

speaker_heading: JENSEN
speaker_heading: (AMAZED)
dialog: Holy shit, it's like we were framed

speaker_heading: AISHA
dialog: What about Goliath?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENSEN
dialog: Yeah, what would an oil company
dialog: want with the Middle East?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FENNEL
speaker_heading: (STILL FREAKED)
dialog: The ships that service their

dialog: US Customs! It's how Max gets the
dialog: drugs in and out of the country-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: This is conspiracy theory bullshit-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FENNEL
dialog: It's not! There's proof!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: FENNEL
dialog: Max's heroin operation - Goliath
dialog: keeps accounts of the shipments!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENSEN
dialog: Come on, dude, they'd be morons to
dialog: keep records of shit like this-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FENNEL
dialog: It's on a stand-alone hard drive!
dialog: It's their insurance policy against
dialog: Max - they know he's crazy, this
dialog: way they have something on him!
dialog: 63.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: So this hard drive - it contains
dialog: evidence of what Max has been doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FENNEL
dialog: Yes!
dialog: 
dialog: Our guys exchange looks...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Can you get us this drive?
dialog: 
text: Fennel goes even paler.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FENNEL
dialog: I don't know where it is! They
dialog: don't let me have access! But-
dialog: 
text: Fennel goes pale when he sees Clay MOVE TOWARD HIM:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FENNEL (CONT'D)
dialog: No, wait! Please don't kill-
dialog: 
text: Clay plasters DUCT TAPE over Fennel's mouth. Stepping
text: outside the Chinook. The others, going with him...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The Warhead, still sitting there. Nobody speaks for a
dialog: bit. Then:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I say we hit Goliath headquarters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: And do what - go after this non-
dialog: existent hard drive?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: We find out if it exists. If it

dialog: 
text: Roque stares at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: That's your plan?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You got a better one?
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 64.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Max gives us back our lives or we
dialog: upload the data to the net, show
dialog: the American people what's being
dialog: done in their names.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: Why risk our lives again when we

dialog: 
text: He gestures to the WARHEAD. Clay, shocked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You want to give it back to him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: I want to at least discuss it before
dialog: signing up for another suicide
dialog: mission on the say-so of some flunky-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: It's not happening.
dialog: 
text: Roque blinks at Clay's abruptness. Pissed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: So you want to take down Goliath
dialog: now? Then who? McDonald's?
dialog: American Airlines? Microsoft?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You don't want Max to pay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: I want my life back! This is
dialog: supposed to be us getting clear -
dialog: not saving the world!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POOCH
speaker_heading: ROQUE-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: We're not the goddamn good guys

dialog: 65.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Don't raise your voice at me-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: I will raise whatever the hell I
dialog: want - you got a death wish because
dialog: you got beat by a voice on a radio-
dialog: 
text: WHAP! Clay throws a STRAIGHT RIGHT to Roque's jaw! Roque,

text: through the blood, DRAWING A KNIFE:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm gonna cut your head off...
dialog: 
text: This got serious quick. Pooch steps between them.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: POOCH
speaker_heading: (SOFTLY)
dialog: Put it away...
dialog: 
text: A long beat... and Roque slides the knife back into it's
text: SCABBARD. Clay, staring at him:
dialog: 66.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You want your life back, you're

speaker_heading: JENSEN

speaker_heading: POOCH

speaker_heading: (PAUSE)

scene_heading: EXT. NEW ORLEANS POLICE DEPARTMENT -- DAY
dialog:

speaker_heading: POOCH

speaker_heading: POOCH

speaker_heading: JENSEN
dialog: You won't believe how detailed

speaker_heading: JENSEN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: POOCH
dialog: When we first went over in 2001,
dialog: Jolene and my oldest Tina wanted
dialog: to do the yellow ribbon thing,
dialog: right? Only problem was there was
dialog: no yellow ribbon to be found - all
text: the stores had been cleaned out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: Military neighborhood...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POOCH
dialog: No doubt. And Tina's four at the
dialog: time, and what she can't understand
dialog: is why the ribbon's gotta be yellow.
dialog: So Jolene sings her the song, right?
dialog: To show her where the idea comes
dialog: from. And when she's all done,
dialog: Tina, four years old, looks my
text: wife dead in her eye and says
dialog: "that's the dumbest song I ever
dialog: heard."
speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: So my wife and my four year old

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
speaker_heading: (SMILING)

speaker_heading: POOCH
dialog: Yeah...

speaker_heading: THEN:

speaker_heading: POOCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Jolene dated a guy last summer.
dialog: Didn't turn into anything and I
dialog: sure as hell can't blame her, but

text: ...And landing in an EMPTY ROOM.
dialog: 
dialog: No computers. No stand-alone drives. No nothing. Except
text: for PAR-SEC GUARDS with weapons trained at his head...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CHEVY VAN - GOLIATH TERMINAL
dialog: 
text: Pooch sitting in the van, into the radio:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POOCH
dialog: Jensen, you get it? Jensen?
dialog: 
text: Does not see the FIVE PAR-SEC SOLDIERS moving in on his
text: car, long guns up and out...
scene_heading: EXT. GOLIATH OIL TANK - SAME
dialog: 
text: Cougar flexed and aimed. Scope locked in on the fire
text: alarm... CLICK! Safety off on a gun pressed to his
text: temple. Fuck. He LAYS DOWN THE GUN and puts his hands
text: behind his head. Furious at himself for GETTING CAUGHT...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GOLIATH SHIPPING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: From the shadows, WADE ENTERS. Clay looks up at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Hello, Clay. Been awhile.
speaker_heading: (NODDING)
dialog: Roque.
dialog: 
text: Head wounds bleed bad. The crowbar caused a mother of a
text: gusher on Clay. He wipes blood from his eyes. Manages:
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: When...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: After the truck. I got tired of
dialog: waiting for you to save us, so I
dialog: up and saved myself. Reached out
dialog: like I said and cut a deal - I set
dialog: this up, I go free.
dialog: 
text: He begins walking around Clay as he talks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Traitor...
dialog: 102.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: You gave me no choice. It was
dialog: always gonna end like this, Clay.
dialog: Us captured or dead. It was always
dialog: a dead end. You made sure of it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
speaker_heading: (SPITTING BLOOD)
dialog: Bullshit...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: Not bullshit. You were gonna keep
dialog: planning missions and ways to hit
dialog: Max until it got us all killed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: No...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: Yes, Clay. Yes. Only difference
dialog: with this situation is at least I
dialog: get to walk away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: We all could have walked... used
dialog: the drive...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: Don't you get it yet? There is no
dialog: drive. There never was...
dialog: 
text: Wade BEGINS LAUGHING. Clay looks like he's been slapped.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE (CONT'D)
text: Fennel made it up to save himself.
dialog: When I told Wade, he planted the
dialog: info at Goliath to lead you here.
dialog: 
text: Clay stares at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE (CONT'D)
dialog: You really thought there was a
dialog: happy ending coming? Pooch was
dialog: gonna get his family back, we were
dialog: gonna get to be soldiers again?
dialog: (leans down; softly)
dialog: We lost the moment we went off
dialog: mission. This is just the logical
dialog: conclusion of that playing out.
dialog: You didn't want to hear it.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 103.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE (CONT'D)
dialog: You just wanted your revenge.
dialog: Your face-to-face with the big bad
dialog: wolf. I'm sorry, buddy, but it's
dialog: the way of the world...
dialog: 
text: Roque straightens back up, shaking his head:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE (CONT'D)
dialog: Guys like us don't beat guys like
dialog: him.
dialog: 
text: In the corner, Wade nods at this. Behind him, A LARGE
text: SEMI pulls up to the CASH CONTAINER. Over the following,
text: a hydraulic lift hoists the cash container onto the truck:
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Kill me now... Maybe you live
dialog: through this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Oh, we're not gonna kill you.
dialog: Someone's gotta get away with the
dialog: cash. Your crew? I'm definitely
dialog: wasting them. But you?
dialog: 
text: He nods to the HYDRO-WINCH slowly lowering the CASH
text: CONTAINER onto the flat bed, with a smile...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WADE (CONT'D)
dialog: You're about to steal a billion
dialog: dollars from the Central
dialog: Intelligence Agency.
dialog: 
text: Clay stares at daggers at both of them.
speaker_heading: WADE (CONT'D)
dialog: It's for our replacement nuke.
dialog: When a billion goes missing, people
dialog: tend to ask who took it.
speaker_heading: (CHUCKLING)
dialog: Max really does love to frame you...
dialog: 
text: Several Par-Sec Guards arrive. Wade points to Clay:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WADE (CONT'D)
dialog: Take him away. Drop him in Newark.
speaker_heading: (TO ROQUE)
dialog: I'll see you at Turner Airfield.
dialog: 104.
dialog: 
text: The Guards handcuff Clay and drag him to his feet. Pushing
text: him towards the door. As he hustled past Roque:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: Wait.
dialog: 
text: They stop. Roque looks at his old friend.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry it had to end this way.
dialog: 
text: Clay stares back at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You're going to die very badly.
text: The guards hustle Clay out the door...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GOLIATH TERMINAL - DAY
dialog: 
text: PAR-SEC GUARDS lead the Pooch, Jensen, and Cougar towards
text: the far end of the terminal. Each, bound. Cougar looks
text: up to see a separate set of Guards leading CLAY the
text: opposite way. Their eyes connect - both knowing:
dialog: 
dialog: They've lost.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: (answering the question)
dialog: Roque.
dialog: 
text: Cougar lowers his head, sadly. Clay's pushed into A TRUCK.
dialog: 
dialog: Gone.
text: The Guards take Pooch, Jensen, and Cougar BEHIND A
text: WAREHOUSE. Looking at each other. Knowing, this is the
text: end of the line. The Lead Guard RACKS HIS MACHINE GUN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEAD GUARD
dialog: On your knees.
dialog: 
text: Pooch SPITS AT HIM. The Lead Guard calmly SHOOTS HIM in
speaker_heading: BOTH LEGS!
dialog: 
text: Pooch SCREAMS. Falls. The Par-Sec boys force Cougar and
text: Jensen down too, CLUBBING THEM with their rifles. Pooch
text: looks up at his assailant. Gasps through the pain:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POOCH
dialog: Get on with it...
dialog: 105.
dialog: 
text: The Lead Guard smiles. Looks to Cougar, who's shredding
text: his skin to the bone trying to claw out of the cuffs...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEAD GUARD
dialog: That's a nice hat.
dialog: 
text: He steps forward to take it, but Cougar is too quick for
text: the man, MOVING HIS HEAD AWAY. He reaches for Cougar
text: again. Again, Cougar evades. The guards laugh at their
text: colleague, who continues trying to grab Cougar's hat.
dialog: 
text: The Lead Guard has had enough of Cougar's antics.
text: Levelling the rifle at his head...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEAD GUARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't really care of there's a
dialog: hole in it. One wash, good as...
speaker_heading: (NOTICING)
dialog: What are you smiling at?
dialog: 
text: Cougar's nods past him...
dialog: 
text: As the Guards turn to see ON TOP OF AN OIL TANK...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AISHA
dialog: 
text: As she rises up to standing, A SLANT-K 600 ROCKET HIP
text: BLASTER locked and loaded. Looking like an Old Testament
text: style Goddess of Vengeance and Destruction. A moment of
text: FROZEN SHOCK on the rest of Wade's Hit Crew...
dialog: 
text: And she pulls the trigger. A HIGH PITCHED WHISTLE as
dialog: 
text: THE ROCKET STREAKS across the Terminal! Headed straight
text: for an ENORMOUS FUEL TANK...
text: KA-BOOM! The explosion ROCKS THE ENTIRE TERMINAL...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK (MOVING)
dialog: 
text: The Truck Clay is prisoner in is BLOWN INTO THE AIR by
text: the SHOCKWAVE... SMASHING down onto it's side, skidding...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BY THE WAREHOUSE
dialog: 
text: Cougar and Jensen DESTROY the remaining Par-Secs with
text: legs. Grabbing cuff keys and freeing themselves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENSEN
dialog: Shouldn't have gone after the hat...
dialog: 106.
dialog: 
text: WHAM! Cougar kicks the Guard in the face, knocking him
text: cold. Aisha rappels off the Oil Tower in the distance.
text: VARIOUS PAR-SEC TEAMS fire at her! Cougar scoops up two
text: rifles and tosses one to Jensen - they give her covering
text: fire as she comes! As he shoots, to the wounded Pooch:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENSEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Can you stand?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POOCH
dialog: I've been shot in both legs, what
dialog: kind of dumbass question is that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENSEN
dialog: Oh, so we're Mr. Grumpy now? You're
dialog: not the only one who's been shot
dialog: recently, you know!
dialog: 
text: He empties a full clip into a Par-Sec team and reloads...
dialog: 
text: AISHA -- Pinned down forty yards away. Almost out of
text: AMMO. Par-Sec Team, almost on top of her when
dialog: 
text: A FIGURE emerges from an OVERTURNED TRUCK. GUN in each
text: hand, BLAZING. The Par-Secs cut down one by one. The
text: figure lowers his guns. Desert Eagles. Walks up to her.
text: Underneath the blood, oil, and grime, it's
dialog: 
text: CLAY. They stare at each other...
dialog: 
text: Then, incredibly, Aisha RAISES HER WEAPON AT HIM.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AISHA
dialog: Did you kill my father?
text: Jensen comes running up, interrupting:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENSEN
dialog: Clay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Kind of in the middle of something
dialog: here, Jensen-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AISHA
dialog: Did you kill him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENSEN
dialog: There was no drive, Clay-
dialog: 107.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: (eyes on Aisha)
speaker_heading: I KNOW-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENSEN
dialog: There was no drive and Roque's
text: gone and Par-Sec's regrouping and
dialog: Pooch could bleed out-
dialog: 
text: Aisha's had enough, thumbing the hammer back:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AISHA
dialog: Did you kill him?
dialog: 
text: Clay, about to respond when:
speaker_heading: COUGAR (O.S.)
dialog: I did.
dialog: 
text: They turn to see our LONG TALL SNIPER standing above them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COUGAR (CONT'D)
dialog: He asked us. It was mercy. But
dialog: you're his family, so I understand.
dialog: 
text: And then, incredibly, Cougar lays his rifle at her feet.
dialog: 
text: SURRENDERING...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COUGAR (CONT'D)
dialog: But only me.
dialog: 
text: Clay and Jensen blink, shocked. Aisha stares at Cougar,
text: equally surprised. She levels her pistol AT HIS HEAD...
dialog: Silence. We CUT WIDE to see...
dialog: 
text: A GUNSHOT. Muzzle flash from Aisha's gun. COUGAR FALLS...
dialog: 
text: In close again. Aisha stands over Cougar's body.
dialog: 
text: The others, stunned... And then Cougar rises. Face
text: BLOODY. Cheek ripped open, from where the bullet creased
text: his flesh. She FIRES AGAIN - BLAM!
dialog: 
text: Identical scar on his other cheek. Blood runs down his
text: face. He doesn't move to wipe it away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AISHA
dialog: Wear it. Remember him.
dialog: 108.
dialog: 
text: Cougar nods. Leans down, picks up his rifle. Debt paid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENSEN
dialog: Okay, excellent, very tribal--We
dialog: need to go.
dialog: 
text: As if on cue, BULLETS kick up DUST around them! A new
text: Par-Sec team, incoming. Clay, Jensen, Aisha, and Cougar
text: hightail it back to where Pooch lies.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Can you stand?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POOCH
dialog: This is stupid question day, isn't
dialog: it? It's stupid question day and
dialog: someone forgot to tell me...
dialog: 
text: Clay slings Pooch over his shoulders fireman carry style.
text: Looks across the Terminal to where Pooch's van is parked.
text: PUSH IN on Clay's face for:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Let's go.
dialog: 
text: And they do. Sprinting across the open space IN SLO-MO,
text: Cougar and Aisha WASTING EVERYTHING THAT MOVES. A full
text: on ballet of fully automatic mayhem...
dialog: 
text: They make it to the van! Piling in! Cougar behind the
text: wheel GUNS THE ENGINE and they PEEL OUT...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VAN (MOVING) -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Pulling on to the HIGHWAY. Silence sets in. The high of
text: the firefight, over. Just pain and loss now.
dialog: 
text: Five people, some terribly wounded, with nowhere to go.
text: Just the rocking of the van as it heads down the road.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FINALLY:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: They won. We lost. Way it goes.
dialog: 
dialog: Silence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POOCH
dialog: Way it always goes.
dialog: 
text: Clay looks at him.
dialog: 109.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POOCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Guess we should just head home.
dialog: Oh, wait, that's right. We don't
dialog: have homes.
dialog: 
text: Clay doesn't respond. Aisha studies him. Nods. Knows
text: what has to be done. They all do. From behind the wheel:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COUGAR
dialog: Where to, Colonel?
dialog: 
text: Clay looks up at the use of rank...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PRIVATE AIRSTRIP -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Wade pulls up in a Corvette. Gets out and walks over as
text: Roque finishes supervising Par-Sec guards finish loading
text: the CASH onto a HUGE TRANSPORT PLANE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Your friends jack-rabbitted. Should
dialog: we be worried?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: Clay doesn't take risks. It's why
dialog: I'm here and he's not.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: You're sure?
dialog: 
text: Roque nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WADE (CONT'D)
dialog: Can I ask you something? Why'd
dialog: you stick with those losers for so
dialog: long?
dialog: 
dialog: Roque considers. Then:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: They were good guys.
dialog: 
text: Wade half smiles at this. Shaking his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: No such thing. I'll go call Max.
dialog: 
text: He begins walking towards HANGAR...
dialog: 
text: CRACK! As the FENCE by the AIRSTRIP is SMASHED INWARDS
text: by the Van! Headed straight for him! Clay, WAVING:
dialog: 110.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Hi, Wade!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BY THE PLANE
dialog: 
text: Roque turns to the Pilot:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: Declan, start the plane...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BY THE HANGAR
dialog: 
text: WADE raises his UZI and FIRES - Taking out the Van's front
text: tires! THE VAN Flips! Smashing end over end, finally
text: coming to a rest on it's side! Climbing out, groaning:
speaker_heading: POOCH
dialog: Next time, remind me - car crash
dialog: first, then get shot...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENSEN
dialog: Sounds less painful that way...
dialog: 
text: Clay looks across the tarmac to see the plane begin to
text: Taxi. ROQUE stands in they back - loading ramp still
text: down. FLIPS CLAY A SALUTE...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Cougar and I are going after that
dialog: plane. The rest of you, get Wade.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENSEN
dialog: Me and legless Pooch are on it!
speaker_heading: (RE: AISHA)
dialog: Where the hell is she going?
text: Aisha is heading off to the fenceline... Clay and Cougar
text: run for Wade's CORVETTE. Cougar slides behind the wheel
text: and starts her up, PEELING OUT after the plane...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POOCH
dialog: You call me legless Pooch again,
dialog: you're gonna be Headless Jensen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENSEN
dialog: What, it's a cool name! It makes
dialog: you sound like a pirate!
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: Fine, let's go kill Wade...
dialog: 
text: ON THE RUNWAY
dialog: 111.
dialog: 
text: Cougar guns the engine, catching up to the TAXIING
text: TRANSPORT PLANE. Clay leans out the window, shooting at
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: 
text: Huddled in the plane's CARGO HOLD, RETURNING FIRE. The
text: PILOT, yelling to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: We don't have enough runway to
dialog: take off - we're going to have to
dialog: turn around and come back to get
dialog: up to speed!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: Fine, just get us in the air!
text: He fires ANOTHER BURST from his weapon at the Vette!
scene_heading: CLICK - his WEAPON DRY.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm out!
dialog: 
scene_heading: IN THE CORVETTE -- SIMULTANEOUSLY, Clay, WEAPON DRY.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I'm out.
dialog: 
text: He stares through the windshield to look at Roque.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Get me closer...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HANGAR -- NIGHT
text: Jensen enters, carrying a MACHINE GUN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENSEN
dialog: Yoo-hoo! Wade!
dialog: (a'la the Warriors)
dialog: Come out and plaaaayyy-
dialog: 
text: The ROAR of an engine -- Jensen DIVES out of the way as
text: Wade WHIPS PAST on a MOTORCYCLE! Heading for the runway!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENSEN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (INTO RADIO)
dialog: Hey, Wade's coming at you! I...
dialog: 
text: He trails off. Looking at THE LEAR JET that Wade arrived
text: in. Sitting in the Hangar's Corner. Keys the radio...
dialog: 112.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENSEN (CONT'D)
dialog: I think I just found our way out
dialog: of here...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. AIRSTRIP -- DAY
dialog: 
text: The Corvette, pulling behind the still lowered REAR RAMP
text: of the TRANSPORT PLANE! Clay, onto the CORVETTE'S HOOD...
dialog: 
text: Roque, rising to meet him. Waiting for him...
dialog: 
text: Clay JUMPS! Landing on the ramp!
dialog: 
text: IN THE CARGO HOLD - Roque smiles. Pulls a WICKED LOOKING
text: KNIFE. The two men stand there. Sizing one another up...
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: Gotta admit, I always wondered how
dialog: this would play out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Aisha thinks you kill me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: It's a distinct possibility...
dialog: 
text: They begin circling one another. Clay, still weaponless.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE (CONT'D)
dialog: You don't have a knife?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Don't need one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: Bit of as longshot for you...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
speaker_heading: (SMILING)
dialog: No. It's not.
dialog: 
text: Roque LUNGES AT HIM...
dialog: 
text: But Clay does have a knife. He PULLS IT and SLAMS IT
text: into Roque's belly! Roque, stunned! Staggers back...
dialog: 
dialog: For most men, that would be the end of the fight. But
text: not these two. Roque gives Clay a bloody grin.
dialog: 113.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROQUE
dialog: Now I really am gonna cut your
dialog: head off...
dialog: 
text: He LUNGES AGAIN! And now it is FULLY ON...
dialog: 
text: The blades whip up and down - almost too fast to see
text: Roque gets Clay with a left cross, then buries his knife
text: in Clay's shoulder. Clay twists free, slashes at Roque.
dialog: 
text: Ten seconds in, the men separate again. Breathing hard...
dialog: 
text: Clay sees Roque doesn't have his knife. Looks - realizing
text: it's still embedded in his own shoulder. Pulls it out,
text: TOSSES IT BACK TO ROQUE. They stand there, both panting...
text: Then RUN AT EACH OTHER full tilt!
dialog: 
text: Here's how it ends. And pay attention, IT HAPPENS FAST:
dialog: 
text: Clay goes low -- coming up to grab Roque's knife hand,
text: which is arcing DOWNWARDS TOWARDS CLAY'S THROAT -- Clay
text: manages to HALT THE HAND, blade inches from his Adam's
text: apple -- and there's a moment where Roque could overpower
text: him and actually cut his head off... But Clay THROWS HIS
text: WEIGHT FORWARD and BREAKS ROQUE'S RIGHT ARM!
dialog: 
text: And for the first time, Roque SCREAMS.
dialog: 
text: Which seems to make Clay happy.
dialog: 
text: So he BREAKS ROQUE'S LEFT ARM too.
dialog: 
text: Roque falls to his knees, BROKEN, BLOODY, AND BEATEN...
text: TO REVEAL -- The PILOT. Leaning out of the cockpit, DESERT
text: EAGLE levelled at Clay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
speaker_heading: SHIT-
dialog: 
text: The Pilot PULLS THE TRIGGER. The bullet slams into Clay's
text: abdomen and BLOWS HIM off his feet backwards -- FLYING
text: OUT OF THE PLANE -- And landing on hood of
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE CORVETTE
dialog: 
text: Clay SMASHES DOWN ON the windshield -- Cougar pumps the
text: brakes and spins the wheel -- desperately trying to keep
text: Clay from rolling off the hood...
dialog: 114.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE PLANE
dialog: 
text: TURNING AROUND at the end of the runway. Beginning it's
dialog: final run to get up to speed...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE CORVETTE
dialog: 
text: Now driving TOWARDS IT on a chicken-like collision course
text: when WHOOSH! WADE FLIES PAST ON HIS MOTORCYCLE! Clay
text: turns to Cougar through the spiderwebbed windshield:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Rifle...
dialog: 
text: Cougar passes Clay his SNIPER RIFLE and FLOORS IT...
scene_heading: VISUALIZE THIS --
dialog: 
text: AT ONE END OF THE RUNWAY, the plane starting to take off.
dialog: 
text: AT THE OPPOSITE END, Wade's motorcycle heading full speed
text: at the approaching plane. Cougar and Clay, chasing Wade.
dialog: 
text: And then AISHA steps out INTO THE MIDDLE of the runway.
text: The ROCKET LAUNCHER clutched in her hands.
dialog: 
text: She takes a knee. Aims at the plane, which is almost at
text: lift speed. ROQUE sees her from the cockpit.
dialog: 
text: She locks eyes with him and GRINS -- FIRING into the
text: LANDING GEAR of the plane AS...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE CORVETTE
dialog: 
text: PULLS EVEN WITH WADE. Instead of shooting, Clay THROWS
text: Cougar's RIFLE BETWEEN THE SPOKES of Wade's FRONT TIRE,
dialog: causing the bike to
dialog: 
text: CATAPULT WADE OFF and FORWARD...
dialog: 
text: ...THROUGH THE AIR and into the RIGHT NUMBER TWO JET ENGINE
text: of the now flying cargo plane. The ENGINE EXPLODES.
dialog: 
text: Aisha, somehow safe on the ground, looking up at the
text: escaping plane. Clay looking up. All of them watching...
dialog: 
text: ...as Roque dies very badly.
dialog: 
text: WHOOMP! The big plane EXPLODES in a MONSTER FIREBALL--VA
text: DOOOM! Burning gas and iron and cash. FIRE RULES.
dialog: 115.
dialog: 
text: ON THE GROUND
dialog: 
text: Our guys. Bloody, eyes bitterly triumphant. Clay stares
text: at the sight before him. Only one word for it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Outstanding.
dialog: 
text: Jensen approaches, supporting Pooch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENSEN
dialog: Not to rain on everyone's we killed
dialog: all the bad guys parade, but we
dialog: should probably get gone - legless
text: Pooch has a Learjet all gassed up
dialog: for us in the Hangar.
dialog: (off Pooch's look)
dialog: It's a cool name-
dialog: 
text: From the smashed up bike Wade was driving, WADE'S CELL
text: PHONE RINGS. Clay gets off the hood of the Vette and
text: Cougar and Aisha help him hobble over. Answering it:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Hello?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NORTH INDIA -- HANGAR -- DAY
dialog: 
text: MAX and the INDIANS. INTERCUT with Clay:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: We good?
dialog: 
text: TIGHT ON CLAY realizing who he's talking to.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Not by a longshot. You're not
dialog: having a real great day, Max.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Who is this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
text: Just a voice on the phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Where's Wade?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
text: Working on the engines.
dialog: 116.
dialog: 
text: A beat as it hits Max.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Clay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: It's Colonel.
dialog: 
text: In the distance, SIRENS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Colonel, yes. Well done.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I understand you've always wanted
dialog: to meet face to face. I'm sure
dialog: that could be arranged...
dialog: 
text: A beat. Then:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I don't think the guys you're about
dialog: to stiff for a billion dollars are
dialog: going to allow that to happen.
dialog: (looks to the others)
dialog: We win. You lose. Goodbye.
dialog: 
text: He snaps the phone shut and tosses it into the fire.
text: Turns to the others.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAY (CONT'D)
