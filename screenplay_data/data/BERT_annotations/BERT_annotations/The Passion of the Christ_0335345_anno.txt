text: Loud whiz of night insects.
text: Moonlight is reflected on silver leaves in the olive grove. A
text: thin cloud drifts over the face of the moon. A DEEP VOICE,
text: somewhere in the olive garden murmurs low, undecipherable
dialog: words.
text: We search for the SOURCE of the voice, and approach the mouth
text: of a hidden GROTTO.
text: The nearer we get, the louder the BUZZ of insects.
text: JOST INSIDE the GROTTO, the OUTLINE of a LARGE MAN (JESUS OF
text: NAZARETH) is visible, kneeling against rock, His head resting
text: on His RIGHT FOREARM.
text: A night predator’s SCREECH outside interrupts His prayer.
text: His arm drops from his forehead, He stands and steps out of
text: the cave, into the moonlight. The HISS of insects intensifies
text: to a new pitch of hysteria.
text: JESUS is a tall, strongly built man. There is vigorous
text: authority in His features, even though His face is DRENCHED
text: with perspiration. He steps away from the mouth of the cave
text: and up toward a large TREE under which THREE FIGURES lie
dialog: sleeping.
text: An OWL perched one of its branches sees JESUS approach, takes
text: silent flight. As it rises, we pull back.
text: The WALLS of JERUSALEM are revealed, in the distance.
text: Between them and the Garden, TORCHLIGHT. We move in.

text: A GROUP OF SOLDIERS have stopped by a STREAM (CEDRON). Three

text: OLD FALLEN TREE-TRUNK from where it has been placed, across
dialog: the torrent.
text: The soldiers holding the torches scan the area, wary and
text: watchful. The WALLS of JERUSALEM are visible, half a mile
dialog: away.

speaker_heading: JESUS
dialog: Peter.
text: The three men abruptly WAKE, scramble to their feet.
speaker_heading: JESUS (cont’d)
dialog: Could you not watch with me a while?
text: Their dark CLOAKS fall away and their faces are revealed:
text: PETER, bearded and gruff, with clear eyes on a mobile face;
text: JAMES, thoughtful, more private; JOHN, young, whose
text: passionate faith in JESUS is boundless and palpable.
text: The three men stare at the SWEAT-SOAKED face of JESUS.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Master, what has happened to you?
speaker_heading: JORN
dialog: (whisper)
dialog: Should T call the others, Lord?
text: JESUS starts to tremble. The three APOSTLES start to reach
text: out, but He shakes His head.
speaker_heading: JESUS
dialog: No, John, They should not see me under
dialog: this cloud.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Master...are you in danger? Should we
dialog: take flight?
speaker_heading: JESUS
dialog: Stay here, Peter. Keep watch, pray.
text: He turns away from the three baffled Apostles and steps back
text: down toward the GROTTO below.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (whisper)
dialog: What is happening to Him?
speaker_heading: PETER
text: He is afraid. He spoke of danger, even as
dialog: we ate supper. Of betrayal and...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The HIGH-PICHED SIZZLE of insects interrupts Peter ~ they
text: have begun their hissing with the same suddenness with which
text: they stopped. The three men look down at the SILHOUETTE of
text: JESUS approaching the mouth of the GROTTO.
scene_heading: EXT. GROTTO. GARDEN OF OLIVES. NIGHT.
text: JESUS stops in front of the cave, stares at the SHADOW of a
text: dead tree-trunk, then lifts His eyes to the sky.
text: A cloud slides over the moon, killing her light.
text: JESUS turns again to the TREE STUMP, which, in the sudden
text: darkness, casts a PALE UN-SHADOW onto the ground, an
text: INVERSION OF A SHADOW, which SLITHERS INTO THE GROTTO.
text: The HISS of the insects has reached a maddening pitch.
text: JESUS steps inside the dark cave,
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CHAMBER IN THE TEMPLE. JERUSALEM. NIGHT.
text: The SCREECH and GROAN of metal against wood. A heavy door is
dialog: closed.
text: The rich chamber is lit by wall torches.
text: Here and there the brilliance of gold is reflected.
text: An intelligent face, eyes bright with anticipation (JUDAS)
text: looks over his shoulder as a TEMPLE GUARD OFFICER (MALCHUS)
text: closes the doors, turns to face the room.
text: A half-dozen MEN in opulent robes stand in the center of the
text: chamber, at self-conscious distance from JUDAS,
text: The man in the RICHEST ROBES (CAIPHAS) addresses MALCHUS, who
text: has already reached into a SATCHEL inside his shirt.
speaker_heading: CAIPHAS
dialog: Thirty, Malchus,.
text: CAIPHAS turns slowly to look at JUDAS as he speaks. JUDAS
text: is focusing exclusively on MALCHUS.
speaker_heading: CAIPHAS (cont’ d)
dialog: That is what we settled on,,..thirty, was
dialog: it not, Judas?
text: JUDAS nods as time slows down.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: MALCHUS pulls a STRING OF SILVER COINS from the satchel and
text: tosses it at JUDAS. The THROW is not well aimed, and JUDAS is
text: forced to back away and spin toward the HIGH PRIESTS and
text: their accolites, whose expressions of contempt FLASH before
text: his eyes as he leaps up and snatches the string of coins out
dialog: of the air.
text: CAIPHAS laughs.
text: JUDAS looks down at the silver in his hands.
text: TIME slows down further as JUDAS turns to MALCHUS, who has re-
text: opened the doors. A handful of SOLDIERS stand outside,
text: expectantly. Inside,
text: laughter has broken out among the high priests.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GROTTO. GARDEN OF OLIVES. NIGHT.
text: A LOUD, AGONIZED GROAN.
text: Startled, PETER scrambles to his feet once again. JOHN and
text: JAMES also sit up, tense. Quick exchange of looks.
text: Moonlight floods the Garden of Olives. The HISS of insects
text: has receded and been replaced with OTHER NOISES, less easily
text: identifiable, coming from the grotto area.
text: A CRY OF PAIN, followed by CACKLES and GUFFAWS.
text: JOHN starts to step down toward the GROTTO but PETER grabs
text: his arm, stops him.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, you stay here, both of you. I will
dialog: join him...you stay and keep watch.
text: PETER steps quickly down toward the GROTTO entrance but STOPS
text: when he hears PANDEMONIC NOISES coming from inside.
text: An odd LIGHT illuminates the underbrush hiding the cave
text: entrance and the VIOLENT SOUNDS INSIDE THE CAVE INCREASE.
text: PETER looks back. JAMES
text: and JOHN stand under the tree and peer back at him.
text: PETER faces the GROTTO again.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
scene_heading: INT. GROTTO. GARDEN OF OLIVES. NIGHT.
text: JESUS’ face is now covered with blood as well as sweat.
text: He kneels in the center of the cave, facing a large SHAPELESS
text: FORM, so DARK that, by contrast, the darkness around it is
dialog: made visible,
text: Parts of the FORM stretch out, then quickly withdraw as they
text: get too close to JESUS. A cacophony of airless grunts and
text: howls fills the air in the grotto. Then silence, A light,
text: musical voice, rich with the dissonance of malice:
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: Do you really believe that one man may
dialog: bear the penalty for...all sin?
speaker_heading: JESUS
dialog: Hear me, Father. Be my defence, keep me
dialog: safe from traps that are set for me.
dialog: Shelter me, Lord, I place myself in your
dialog: care, I place my trust in you.
text: As JESUS prays, the DARK FORM LIFTS OFF THE GROUND and raises
text: a PORTION OF ITSELF HIGHER STILL. WITHIN IT, as if a fetid
text: curtain had been lifted, the FLASH-IMAGE of a TEEMING
text: MULTITUDE of MEN and WOMEN appears, dissolves within itself
text: and reemerges again. FROM the hellish IMAGE a SNAKE EMERGES,
text: slithers to the ground and toward JESUS.
text: PETER stumbles into the darkness and calls out:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Master, what is it? Speak to me, say
dialog: something...I can’t see where to look
dialog: for you.
text: PETER‘s eyes adjust. He sees JESUS, on His knees, His entire
text: body rigid with concentration,
text: PETER scrambles toward Him, then stops. A sudden wash of
text: moonlight floods the cave revealing JESUS’ face to him.
speaker_heading: PETER (cont’d)
dialog: You are bleeding, Lord! What is
dialog: happening...?
text: JESUS remains motionless on His knees. He seems completely
text: unaware of PRTER.
text: PETER starts to move to reach for JESUS but STOPS as he
text: becomes aware of the SNAKE. The reptile slides over PETER’s
text: hands and HISSES.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: PETER looks for JESUS, but now sees ONLY DARKNESS. He BACKS
text: OUT of the cave on all fours, gasping for breath.
text: JESUS has not moved.
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: No man can pay the price, I tell you. It
dialog: is too high. No man can offer what is
dialog: owed. Ever. (beat) Never.
text: JESUS does not respond. The CACOPHONY from within the
text: darkness starts again, and increases in volume.
speaker_heading: COT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF JERUSALEM. NIGHT.
text: The streets of Jerusalem near the TEMPLE building. MALCHUS,
text: JUDAS and a dozen SOLDIERS carrying torches emerge from the
text: TEMPLE and quickly make their way down narrow cobbled
text: Streets. Men, women and children are still out and about,
text: sporadically highlighted by the TORCHES.
text: JUDAS seems surprised by the speed and urgency with which the
text: SOLDIERS are moving. He holds the STRING OF SILVER COINS in
text: his hands.
text: The group arrives at one of the CITY GATES of JERUSALEM and
text: come to a stop. MALCHUS signals GUARDS to open the gates,
text: then turns to JUDAS who is looking down at the string of
text: silver coins in his hands. Sensing the eyes of MALCHUS on him
text: JUDAS looks up.
speaker_heading: MALCHUS
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: JUDAS
dialog: (points)
dialog: Gethsemani.
text: MALCHUS’ eyes meet those of a SECOND OFFICER, who NUDGES
text: JUDAS forward. The party moves out.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN OF OLIVES. NIGHT.
text: INSIDE the GROTTO, the unnatural groans and howls contained
text: within the DARK FORM seem to MULTIPLY.
text: The face of JESUS is soaking with sweat and blood, a mask of
text: internal conflict. He kneels, and sits back on His heels,
text: clutched fists resting on the ground beside Him.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JESUS
dialog: Father, all things are possible to You.
dialog: If it is possible, let this chalice pass
dialog: from me. But only if it is Your will. May
dialog: Your will be done.
text: The cries and groans coming from the dark form in front of
text: Him subside. The SNAKE slowly slides up to where JESUS is
text: kneeling, and stops directly in front of Him.
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: (low, edge of hesitancy)
dialog: Who are you?
text: JESUS slowly stands up, He does not dignify the question with
text: an answer, nor even look to the reptile at His feet.
text: He lifts His foot and brings it down with force on the
text: snake’s head. The NOISE of it expunges all other sound.
text: JESUS steps out of the grotto into moonlight. He lifts His
text: tormented eyes to the moon, A breeze. Then silence. A deep
text: silence, like a weight. JESUS lowers His eyes, scans the ROAD
text: below the garden. His eyes stop.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD TO GETHSEMANL. NIGHT.
text: Torches. SOLDIERS. Then the TWO MEN CARRYING the LOG they
text: lifted from across the CEDRON TORRENT. The group STOPS.
text: MORE TORCHES as MALCHUS and JUDAS’ gang do not stop, but the
text: SOLDIERS greet/insult each other with familiarity.
text: MALCHUS and a SECOND OFFICER step in, order silence and
text: separate the two groups, shoving their men forward. As the
text: two parties separate, MALCHUS takes JUDAS by the arm
speaker_heading: MALCHUS
dialog: Does the Nazarene have men with him?
text: JUDAS laughs.
speaker_heading: JUDAS
dialog: Men? You mean soldiers? No.
dialog: He has a few fishermen,
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN OF OLIVES. NIGHT.
text: JESUS walks up to where PETER, JAMES and JOHN have once more
text: Sat back against the tree and are again asleep.
text: He looks down on them with affection, then leans forward and
text: shakes each of them lightly.
speaker_heading: JESUS
dialog: Wake up, friends. Now is not the time for
dialog: sleep, but for prayer.
text: He points downward, to the road JUST BELOW THE GARDEN OF
text: OLIVES. The Apostles rise to their feet. Sleepy, frightened,
text: they peer down at where He’s pointing.
text: POV: TORCHES moving along the road, slowly, searchingly. The
text: MEN are unrecognizable, but not their uniforms.
speaker_heading: JESUS (cont’d)
dialog: The man who will betray me is drawing
dialog: near.
text: PETER reaches under his cloak, where a SWORD is revealed, in
text: its SCABBARD. JESUS rests a hand on PETER’s shoulder and
text: shakes His head.
scene_heading: EXT, PATH IN GETHSEMANI. NIGHT.
text: MALCHUS at the head of his TEMPLE GUARDS. JUDAS marches
text: beside him, unhappily. Suddenly MALCHUS raises his hand and
text: stops. The rest follow suit.
text: Still in the garden, just off the path, JESUS emerges out of
text: the darkness. PETER, JAMES, JOHN are by His side. They step
text: out onto the path. JESUS motions His Apostles to stop. He
text: then steps forward.
text: JUDAS takes a step back, then a second. He is turning to run
text: when MALCHUS’ hand GRABS him and YANKS him back.
speaker_heading: JESUS
dialog: Who are you looking for?
text: MALCHUS still holds JUDAS by the scruff of the neck. He
text: glances at JUDAS, his jaw set hard, then faces JESUS.
speaker_heading: MALCHUS
dialog: We are looking for JESUS of Nazareth.
text: As he speaks, MALCHUS glances back at his men, nodding curtly
text: to his SECOND OFFICER, The soldiers holding torches shift
dialog: these to their LEFT HAND,
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: JESUS turns His eyes to JUDAS.
speaker_heading: JESUS
dialog: I am he.
text: The SECOND OFFICER signals his men, who tighten their ring
text: around JESUS and the three Apostles.
text: It is a tense, uneasy gathering. Faces flicker in torchlight
text: and reflect the men’s uncertainty.
text: MALCHUS turns to JUDAS, whose eyes have never left JESUS’
text: PETER, JAMES and JOHN look at JUDAS in silent outrage. PETER
text: takes a step but two of the soldiers grab onto his arms.
text: PETER struggles with ferocity, breaks loose, loses his
text: balance and falls to the ground.
text: JUDAS glances at MALCHUS, then steps forward. As he reaches
text: JESUS, he nervously opens his arms:
speaker_heading: JUDAS
dialog: Hail, Rabbi.
text: He lurches forward and awkwardly wraps his arms around JESUS,
text: kisses Him on the cheek. He then stumbles back, feverishly
text: wiping at his lips as if they had been burned.
text: JESUS’ eyes never leave those of JUDAS.
speaker_heading: JESUS
dialog: Judas...you would betray the Son of Man
dialog: with a kiss?
text: Time slows down.
text: MALCHUS waves his men forward, pointing at JESUS.
text: The soldiers grab hold of JAMES and JOHN.
text: This time it is JOHN who struggles with fury against the
text: Strong hold of the soldiers. They try to hold him, but he
text: HITS HARD. They can only hold his clothes. He tugs and pulls
text: so violently that he wiggles right out of them and DASHES off
text: into the night, wearing only a loin cloth.
text: PETER, who has watched JUDAS’ act of betrayal from where he
text: fell now watches the soldiers burst into action.
text: IGNORED by all, JUDAS backs away from the scene. He is
text: guickly engulfed in darkness, still wiping his lips.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10,
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: FLASH:
scene_heading: EXT. ORCHARD OUTSIDE WALLS OF JERUSALEM. NIGHT.
text: The pale figure of JOHN running toward the city walls, ZIG-
text: ZAGGING between the fruit trees, his face slapping against
text: the occasional low branch.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PATH IN GETHSEMANI. NIGHT.
text: PETER reaches for his SWORD as he scrambles to get back to
text: his feet. Knocked back and buffeted by the momentum of the
text: surge, he cannot see what is happening. Pulling his sword
text: from its scabbard, eyes reddened by anger, he catches sight
text: of MALCHUS stepping in to arrest JESUS.
text: The sword descends with deadly energy.
text: JESUS, whose hands suddenly BECOME FREE, pushes MALCHUS away
text: from the FULL FORCE of IMPACT, but the sharp weapon still
text: catches MALCHUS on the side of the head, CLEANLY SEVERING OFF
text: HIS EAR, WHICH FLIES THROUGH THE TORCHLIT AIR. THE EAR LANDS
text: IN THE DUST IN FRONT OF JESUS.
text: MALCHUS falls to the ground, howling with pain.
text: PETER has stopped as his eyes meet those of JESUS.
text: The SOLDIERS around them have completely lost their
text: composure, They tighten their grip on JAMES, bringing him to
text: his knees and holding his arms behind his back.
text: SHOUTS, CLANG of metal weapons, confusion in the melee.
text: JESUS is the only one who has retained His calm. Afraid
text: of PETER, the arresting soldiers have not taken hold of Him.
text: He steps forward, places one hand on PETER’s shoulder and
text: takes the sword from him. He LETS DROP the weapon which falls
text: to the dust, next to the BLOODY EAR,
text: ONLY MALCHUS’ CRY OF PAIN NOW FILLS THE AIR.
text: JESUS reaches down, PICKS UP THE BLOOD-SOAKED EAR, YANKS
text: MALCHUS to his feet, his face covered with blood, his hand
text: held over the wound, Very matter-of~factly, JESUS then takes
text: MALCHUS’ hand away from the wound and SLAPS THE EAR BACK IN
speaker_heading: ITS PLACE.
text: The ear stays where it belongs. The blood is no longer blood,
text: only dust. MALCHUS touches his ear, looks at his hand and

text: an even smaller ALLEY, stops breathing as the men walk past,

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PATH IN GETHSEMANI. NIGHT.

text: MALCHUS is frozen in place, his hand resting on his ear, his
text: eyes glued to those of JESUS.
speaker_heading: JESUS (cont! d)
dialog: You have come to arrest me with chains

text: down at her hand.
text: The room is quiet, dimly lit by oil-lamps.
text: The faint sound of sleep-breathing.
text: A WOMAN (MAGDALEN) lies on a cot near MARY’s bed. She
text: seems to be asleep. At the foot of her cot, TWO MORE WOMEN,
text: their faces covered by veils, lie fast asleep.
text: MARY swings her feet to the floor, stands up, steps toward

text: stumbles to the floor as he avoids crashing into her.
text: MAGDALEN screams. JOHN’s chest is heaving with breathless
text: exhaustion, his face is covered with cuts and dirt, his eyes
text: are red with tears. Suddenly conscious of his near-nakedness,
text: he lowers his head in shame and despair.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: They have seized him, Mary...tied him in

text: The group has reached the middle of the low bridge. Though
text: the hands of JESUS have come loose, the ropes and chains
dialog: which bind Him make it nearly impossible for Him to move,
text: This obvious vulnerability inspires the brutality of His
text: captors. The SHADOW of this is reflected in the water of the

text: In the shadows UNDER the bridge a pair of luminous eyes watch
text: the reflection of the violent beating. JUDAS, still wiping
text: and pawing at his now bloodied lips.
text: The BEATING of JESUS reaches such a fevered pitch that He is
text: literally PICKED UP and BODILY TOSSED over the side.
text: UNDER THE BRIDGE, JUDAS watches JESUS FALL INTO THE SHALLOW
text: WATER ON ALL FOURS, FIRST ON HIS KNEES then HIS HANDS,
text: entangled in a disorder of hemp and chain.
text: JUDAS withdraws further into the SHADOWS, where he seems to
text: become ENFOLDED in a mantle of darkness. He becomes AWARE
text: that what surrounds him is ANIMATED and tries to BREAK FREE

text: all of him EXCEPT HIS EYES, which widen as they peer at
text: reflected torchlight on the water where:
text: JESUS, bruised and now drenched, looks up and SEES JUDAS,
text: TIME SEEMS TO STOP for a brief moment.

text: before the ROPES and CHAINS are once more YANKED UPWARDS and
text: He is strangled half to death before being dumped back onto
text: the bridge. More beatings.
text: UNDER the bridge, the darkness drifts away from JUDAS, who
text: darts out into the open stream and watches the violent
text: procession move along the road. He lowers his eyes to the
text: water, reaches down, splashes some of it onto his bloodied
text: lips, GASPS, MUFFLES a SCREAM of pain and rushes out of the

speaker_heading: WOMAN ONE

speaker_heading: MAGDALEN

scene_heading: EXT. SHEEP PEN NEAR THE WALLS OF JERUSALEM. NIGHT.
text: By the side of the road is a pen filled with sheep and
text: LAMBS, all watching the approaching TORCHES.
text: A DARK FIGURE leaps over a FENCE into their midst. The
text: ANIMALS scatter with LOUD, PLAINTIVE BLEATINGS. JUDAS, his

text: PEOPLE suddenly appear alongside the road, some from within

scene_heading: WOMAN BY ROADSTDE

speaker_heading: SECOND OFFICER
dialog: If that’s what you think, then he has

scene_heading: MAN BY ROADSIDE
dialog: What you say is false. He is a healer. By
dialog: whose authority have you arrested him?
dialog: Set Jesus free.
text: This provokes a general murmur among the onlookers, which

text: ranks even more. Some of the onlookers RUSH the soldiers and
text: are met with LASHING WHIPS. Confused confrontation,
text: JESUS looks utterly calm, though His bruised face shows the
dialog: effect of the blows he has suffered.
text: Hidden in the PEN, JUDAS TEARS AT HIMSELF with ferocity. The
text: LAMBS leap about, frightened by him as well as by the torches
text: and brouhaha that’s broken out on the road. The SILVER in
text: JUDAS’ hands is COVERED IN BLOOD. The sight of it confuses
text: him, He WHEEZES, SHRIEKS and races off into the darkness,
text: toward the city walls. The LAMBS scatter to keep away from
text: him and race toward the FENCE where they STOP, stare at the

text: LAMB’s NECK. The gesture is short and the cut swift and tiny.
text: JESUS then hands the knife to the YOUNG MAN, who completes

text: JUDAS’ eyes widen, He stares down at the string of SILVER
text: COINS in his hand, whimpers, lifts his eyes to CAIPHAS who is

speaker_heading: JUDAS (cont'd)
dialog: He is innocent. Take back your silver, I
dialog: don’t want it. HERE...TAKE IT!
text: The echo of his shout bounces off the walls of the narrow

speaker_heading: CAIPHAS
dialog: If you think you sold innocent blood to
dialog: us, Judas, that is your affair. We
dialog: know what we have bought. You

text: CAIPHAS is distracted by lights and CROWD NOISES at the end
text: of the street, near the Temple entrance.
text: JUDAS, too, looks. Then their eyes meet. With a BELLOW of

text: JUDAS then RUNS down the empty street toward the torchlit

dialog: Pharisees.
text: JUDAS, too, sees CAIPHAS approach. He turns, RUNS then sees

text: JOHN, MARY and MAGDALEN take a step toward him. He looks

text: The CROWD cheers again, louder and obviously for EFFECT as

text: The CROWD surges forward, fixing to enter the Temple grounds,

dialog: however, are kept open.
text: MAGDALEN moans. She and MARY hold on to JOHN’s clothes as he

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Peter...oh, Peter...

text: PETER and JOHN exchange a look of shared helpless misery

text: JESUS looks exhausted by the long march from Gethsemani.
text: A TEMPLE SOLDIER who was not part of the arrest party now

scene_heading: JOSEPH OF ARIMATHEA
dialog: This entire proceeding is offensive,

text: literally SHOVE them out the door.
text: JESUS watches his few supporters leave or be thrown out.
text: CAIPHAS is filled with secret pleasure as JOSEPH and the

speaker_heading: CAIPHAS
dialog: Have you nothing to say, then? No answer
dialog: to any of these accusations?

text: The light of the moon suddenly fills the night. He stops,
text: looks over his shoulders at the walls of JERUSALEM.
text: A BLAST OF WIND HITS JUDAS, then silence and stillness
text: descend on the valley around him. An EERIE quiet.
text: JUDAS SCREAMS. He is staring at the SKIN on his PALE FOREARM
text: which HAS SWOLLEN INTO AN ODD SHAPE. JUDAS TRIES TO COVER THE
text: SWELLING with his other hand, but he CANNOT. It MOVES. He
text: tries again and the swelling moves OUT OF REACH. Frantic now,
text: JUDAS begins to TEAR at his own skin, but HOWEVER HARD HE
text: TRIES TO GRAB HOLD of the KNOB, IT FVADES HIS TOUCH. His
text: watery eyes, bloody face, torn hair and twisted face present
text: a mask of self-inflicted torment. His screams bloodcurdling,
text: JUDAS struggles to TEAR OUT the mysterious GROWTH as it
text: travels about his body, always out of reach, alternating
text: between HOWLS of rage and fear and breathless, wretched
text: silences.
text: Suddenly he stops and GAPES AT THE MOON through the branches

speaker_heading: DEMON

scene_heading: INT. TRIBUNAL HALL. TEMPLE. NIGHT.

text: hair, or His beard and ripping away fingerfuls of it, others
text: SPITTING at HIM or HITTING HIM with their hands or with
dialog: sticks.
dialog: 
text: PETER’s eyes fill with anguish. He roughly ELBOWS away a

speaker_heading: ELDER
dialog: Look! There. Who is that man? That one,
dialog: yes...why is he interfering?

speaker_heading: CAIPHAS
dialog: Not officially, no...

text: ANNAS turns to a particularly large, BRUTISH MAN among the

scene_heading: RESTLESS, LOUDER, MORE UNPREDICTABLE.
text: CAIPHAS, ANNAS and the members of the SANHEDRIM enter.

text: floor, bloodied, filthy, in obvious pain, exhausted. Instead
text: of helping Him rise, the Temple GUARDS KICK at Him until He
text: Slowly, agonizingly, stands up again. JESUS is
text: UNRECOGNIZABLE, yet has retained a mysterious majesty.
text: A CUP of wine is brought to PILATE. He takes it, scans the

speaker_heading: PILATE
dialog: You brought this man to me earlier, and I

text: Baffled silence. Then the air EXPLODES with a roar.
text: The nervous ROMAN SOLDIERS surrounding the Praetorium are

text: around the crowd of angry PHARISEES.
text: The moment is tense, teetering on violent confrontation,

dialog: have any idea what is happening.

dialog: The CHAOS and MOTION of the people is such that they are

text: toward the foot of the stairs where JESUS stands, They
text: suddenly step past the crowd, into the clearing,
text: MARY rushes forward, almost reaches JESUS but is held back by
text: a ROMAN SOLDIER just as her hands are about te touch JESUS’
text: face. MAGDALEN has fallen to her knees and her face has
text: broken into inaudible sobs at the sight of Him. JOHN has gone
text: pale and become motionless.
text: The shouts: CRUCIFY HIM, CRUCIFY HIM gain in power.
text: MARY lifts her eyes to PILATE. The ROAR of the people becomes

speaker_heading: PILATE
text: NO. I WILL CHASTISE HIM, BUT THEN I WILL
scene_heading: SET HIM FREE.
text: He has addressed only MARY, JOHN and MAGDALEN and only they
text: seem to hear his words. MARY stands. The SOLDIER tries to

text: JOHN steps forward and takes MARY’s arm.
text: PILATE frowns at the bloodthirsty roar of the PHARISEES, then
text: signals a ROMAN OFFICER to set BARABBAS free.
text: The chains around BARABBAS’ hands and feet are loosened. He
text: slowly descends the stairs, to the acclaim of the crowd. He
text: cannot believe what is happening to him, and stops at the
text: bottom, directly in front of JESUS,
text: Face to face, JESUS’ eyes PIERCE into the very soul of
text: BARABBAS, who cannot sustain the power of them, and abruptly
text: TAKES OFF through the crowd, knocking down people as he makes
text: his way to the exit.

text: JESUS slowly, painfully rises to His feet. The TEMPLE GUARDS
text: now once again TIE Him up with chains and ropes, the same as
text: when they first arrested Him. He is then FORCED to His

text: MAGDALEN WAILS. She is the only one who always lets the full
text: force of her despair express itself.
text: PILATE signals the ROMAN HORSEMEN. A TRUMPET IS SOUNDED and

text: JESUS tries, but the full weight of the log on His shoulder
text: is too much for Him. The BRUTISH GUARD waves a couple of his
text: men over. They grab hold of JESUS under His arms as well as
text: the LOG. Trembling with pain and exhaustion, JESUS now lifts
text: Himself to His feet. The weight of the wood is crushing. He
text: supports the LOG on His right shoulder, helping Himself with
text: His right arm.
text: The CORDS fastened to the the belt around His waist are held
text: by TEMPLE GUARDS both in front of Him and behind.
text: ROMAN FOOT-SOLDIERS LINE the street and prevent the CROWD
text: from approaching the THREE CONDEMNED MEN.
text: The streets and rooftops, however, are dense with curious
text: men, women and children. Many shout indecipherably as JESUS
text: passes in front of them, others watch silently.
text: The slow, painful procession, under the HEAT of the sun, now
text: approaches an AQUEDUCT under which the roadway is in VERY
text: POOR SHAPE. At the center of the road is a HOLLOW FILLED WITH
speaker_heading: DIRTY WATER,
text: JESUS reaches the hollow, exhausted, and FALLS, HIS FACE
text: slamming onto a rock. The LOG tumbles to the ground.
text: The fury and sadism of the Temple GUARDS redoubles. They
text: SHOUT and KICK JESUS, who remains momentarily MOTIONLESS.
text: Then, in the middle of the violent display by the GUARDS,
text: JESUS slowly reaches out an arm in a gesture that asks for
text: help. No one does. He lifts His head and looks up at the
text: bright SUN, directly overhead.

text: THIEVES, DISMAS and GESMAS, carrying their crosses.
text: MARY searches past DISMAS and GESMAS and sees JESUS. She
text: brings her hands together and becomes utterly still.
text: JESUS looks as if He were SINKING beneath the weight of His
text: cross. His head droops away from the wood, bleeding
text: continuously from the LONG THORNS sunk in His skull and
text: forehead. Despite His desperate condition, He manages to cast

text: The CROWD around the ROMAN SOLDIERS, TEMPLE GUARDS and the
text: THREE CONDEMNED MEN has become BOISTEROUS, despite the MANY

text: PILATE appears leading the ROMAN HORSEMEN.
text: SIMON’s CHILDREN, EXCITED by the sight of the horses and
text: uniforms RUN AHEAD of SIMON and push through the crowd. The
text: CHILDREN STOP abruptly as they SEE what is in reality

text: Carrying the heavy LOG on His bent shoulder, His HEAD
text: COVERED WITH BLOOD, JESUS STUMBLES. The LOG slides off His
text: shoulder once again and JESUS falls a THIRD TIME.
text: It is at this moment that SIMON manages to get past the
text: dense, JEERING CROWD lining the street, in pursuit of his
text: CHILDREN, who stand next to where JESUS has fallen, staring

text: SIMON takes in the horrific scene: the GUARDS - DISMAS and

speaker_heading: BRUTISH GUARD

speaker_heading: ROMAN SOLDIER
dialog: Are you blind? Don’t you see the man
dialog: cannot continue like this? He’1l die

text: The BRUTISH GUARD scans the faces, trying to gauge what he
text: can get away with. A SECOND GUARD mutters to him:
speaker_heading: SECOND GUARD
dialog: The Roman is right, look at him! Maybe we
dialog: should get someone else to carry his
dialog: cross.
text: The BRUTISH GUARD’s eyes have just fallen on SIMON OF CYRENE,

speaker_heading: BRUTISH GUARD
dialog: This blasphemer has been condemned to be

speaker_heading: SIMON OF CYRENE
dialog: No, I’m sorry, but I cannot do what you
dialog: ask. This is none of my business. You’1l

text: The CHILDREN, all crying now, clutch at SIMON’s clothes.
text: The BRUTISH GUARD looks at them, indifferently, shrugs and
text: interrupts SIMON, threateningly.
speaker_heading: BRUTISH GUARD
dialog: I’m not asking for your help. I’m
dialog: ordering you to pick up that cross. Now
dialog: let’s go.
text: JESUS's blood-drenched eyes meet SIMON’s, then turn on the
text: frightened CHILDREN hanging onto SIMON’s cloak, Their grip on
text: SIMON’s clothes loosens.
speaker_heading: SIMON OF CYRENE
dialog: Allright. (raises his voice for all to
dialog: hear) But remember, all of you, that I

dialog: innocent man, have been asked to carry

text: ({SERAPHIA, aka VERONICA) is pouring some wine into a goblet.
text: By her side is a YOUNG GIRL,

scene_heading: The PROCESSION of ROMAN SOLDIERS, TEMPLE GUARDS, DISMAS,

text: The ROMAN SOLDIERS are too distracted to notice SERAPHIA as
text: she majestically STRIDES toward JESUS. By the time they
text: notice the tall woman and the girl, SERAPHIA has knelt down
text: in front of JESUS. She hands the GOBLET to the girl and
text: reaches up to His face with the VEIL:
speaker_heading: SERAPHIA
dialog: Permit me, my Lord.
text: JESUS tremblingly takes the veil in his hands and places it
text: over His face. This removes some of the BLOOD, SWEAT and
text: GRIME. He hands the veil back to her.
text: By now the GUARDS as well as the SOLDIERS have taken note of
dialog: what’s happening.
text: The BRUTISH TEMPLE GUARD steps back toward JESUS just as the
text: GIRL tries to hand JESUS the GOBLET of wine. He KNOCKS THE

speaker_heading: BRUTISH GUARD (cont‘ d)
dialog: GET ALONG, MARCH! MOVE IT!
text: JESUS takes a weak step forward, then slips and falls to His
text: knees a FOURTH TIME. This triggers a BURST of rage in the
text: GUARD, who LASHES OUT AT JESUS with his stick. The other
text: GUARDS are galvanized by his ferocity and so fail to hear the
text: HEAVY THUD of the LOG as it falls to the ground, off SIMON of
text: CYRENE’s shoulder. SIMON strides up to the BRUTISH GUARD,
text: GRABS THE STICK OUT OF HIS HAND AS HE IS ABOUT TO STRIKE

speaker_heading: AWAY.
speaker_heading: SIMON OF CYRENE

text: The SOUND of HORSEHOOVES. PILATE appears over the rise and

text: nagged by his conscience,
text: PILATE abruptly WHIPS his mount into a GALLOP.
text: WE FOLLOW PILATE’S CRAZY RIDE down the steep road toward the

text: the CROWD of PHARISEES and SADDUCEES suddenly BURST INTO
scene_heading: HATEFUL, JEERING SHOUTS.
text: CAIPHAS and ANNAS and members of the Sanhedrim look on,
dialog: triumphant:
text: The EXECUTIONERS TIE DOWN the RIGHT ARM OF JESUS with a cord
text: after DRAGGING HIS RIGHT HAND to where the HOLE has been
text: drilled in the wood beneath it. One of the men then HOLDS the
text: right hand OPEN while a second man places the end of one of
text: the LONG THICK NAILS ONTO HIS WRIST and, with a HEAVY HAMMER,
text: DRIVES THE NAIL INTO THE FLESH AND THROUGH IT, DEEPLY INTO
text: THE WOOD. The LONG POINT of the nail emerges on the OPPOSITE
text: SIDE OF THE WOOD.
text: JESUS lets out a DEEP, SUPPRESSED GROAN.
text: BLOOD GUSHES out of JESUS’ palm, partly spraying the face of
text: the executioner banging the nail through the hand.
text: MAGDALEN GASPS, then SCREAMS. This is followed by a long

text: JESUS lifts His HEAD off the cross, in a spasm of agony as
text: the BLOOD-SOAKED EXECUTIONERS now stretch His LEFT ARM toward
text: the MARKED HOLE which they earlier carved in the arm of the
text: cross. Curses and loud imprecations. The hole has been
text: drilled too far from where JESUS’ WRIST lies.
text: The BRUTAL TEMPLE GUARD strides up to them, knocks them back
text: and peers down at the arm of the cross.
scene_heading: BRUTAL TEMPLE GUARD
dialog: Idiots! Here, let me show you how it’s
dialog: done! Like THIS...
text: He takes hold af JESUS’ hand and wrist and PULLS with ALL HIS

speaker_heading: BRUTAL TEMPLE GUARD (cont’d)
dialog: (grunting with effort)
text: There! NOW GET IN THERE, HOLD THE HAND
dialog: OPEN, NO...NOT LIKE THAT! LIKE 50, YOU
dialog: IDIOT! YES! THERE! NOW!...
text: The EXECUTIONER he’s addressing BANGS THE NAIL INTO PLACE
text: THROUGH JESUS’ WRIST, into the arm of the cross.
text: JESUS’ LEGS TWIST, CONTRACT and SHAKE UNCONTROLLABLY. His
text: groan becomes a long cry of agony.
scene_heading: FADE TO WHITE:
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE OF NICODEMUS. JERUSALEM. NIGHT.

text: HIS CONTRACTED LEGS and PULL HIS FEET DOWN THE LENGTH OF THE
text: CROSS and TIE THEM TOGETHER, holding one foot over the other.
text: The VIOLENCE and TENSION of THESE ACTIONS is compounded by
text: the SKINLESS condition of His legs as they, too, are PULLED
scene_heading: OUT OF JOINT:
speaker_heading: JESUS
dialog: My God, my God...
text: A MUCH LONGER NAIL THAN THE OTHERS is now BANGED THROUGH BOTH

scene_heading: FADE TO WHITE:
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE OF NICODEMUS. JERUSALEM. NIGHT.
text: JESUS lowers His hands and puts the pieces of bread back in

speaker_heading: JESUS
dialog: I am in the Father, and the Father is in
dialog: me. I say this to you now; whoever

text: one hand, one of the bread morcels with the other. Turning to
speaker_heading: JOHN:
speaker_heading: JESUS (cont’d)
dialog: Take this and eat. This is my body, which

speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
dialog: 77.
scene_heading: EXT. GOLGOTHA. DAY.
text: JOHN is frozen into place, standing next to MARY. They both

text: SIMON’s eyes have filled with tears.
text: MAGDALEN, on her hands and knees, now moves toward the cross
text: to which JESUS is nailed, lying on the ground and surrounded
text: by the EXECUTIONERS. No one seems to notice her as she
text: approaches, except ABENADAR, who does not stop her, but
text: points her out to one of the FOOTSOLDIERS.
text: ABANADAR himself is mesmerized by the grunting, sweaty, blood-
text: soaked EXECUTIONERS. He is distracted by MOVEMENT. CAIPHAS,
text: ANNAS and some cf the ELDERS approach the cross,
text: They STAND OVER the stretched and agonizing figure of JESUS,
text: ignoring the groans of DISMAS and GESMAS nearby.
text: A ROMAN SOLDIER is preparing to NAIL the WOODEN BOARD to the
text: cross, on which PILATE INSCRIBED “KING OF THE JEWS”.
text: CAIPHAS signals ANNAS, who reaches into a satchel he wears
text: around his neck, and produces a small BAG. The ring of silver
text: catches the ROMAN SOLDIER‘s attention.
speaker_heading: ANNAS
dialog: For you. In exchange for...that (nods
dialog: at the board)
text: ABENADAR has spurred his mount and approached silently.
speaker_heading: ABENADAR
dialog: Sargent! You have your orders...
text: The SARGENT nails the board onto the top of the cross, then
text: runs back to the periphery of the execution ground.
speaker_heading: ABENADAR (cont’d)
dialog: (looks at Annas and Caiphas)
dialog: You...all of you, get back to where you
text: were, behind the guards. No one is
dialog: allowed here without dispensation. .go.
text: Offended, and trying to look dignified, they retreat. On his
text: way, CAIPHAS nods secretly to the BRUTISH GUARD.
text: The EXECUTIONERS have all noticed MAGDALEN as she has come to
text: a stop near the cross. She ignores them, the soldiers, even
text: ABENADAR on his tall mount. Her eyes are fixated on JESUS,
text: nailed and tied down to the cross.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MAGDALEN POV:
text: Details of the crucifixion. They are jumpy, sometimes IN
text: FOCUS, other times not: the CROWN of THORNS, the BLOOD
text: dripping from His head onto the wood of the cross, the
text: movement of his FINGERS beyond the hands immobilized by the
text: nails, the trembling of His knees, BACK TO THE NAILS... the
text: POINTS OF THE NAILS which have been HAMMERED IN, THROUGH and
text: OUT THE OPPOSITE SIDE of the wood.
text: MAGDALEN has reverted to primordial sounds, but these
text: abruptly STOP as she SCANS the wood UNDER the cross. She
text: lifts her eyes to the agonizing figure of JESUS lying flat on
text: the wood. Her head shakes in silent disbelief.
text: The BRUTISH Temple GUARD is focusing again on the cross. He
text: sees MAGDALEN peering UNDERNEATH the wood. He looks. His face
text: widens with sadistic anticipation. He locks at the
text: EXECUTIONERS, who have started to put away their tools. He
text: hits them, pushes them toward the cross:
speaker_heading: BRUTISH GUARD
dialog: LOOK, you monkeys! No...UNDER there! See
dialog: anything? Do you see that?
text: He CROUCHES, points, touches the point of one of the nails,
text: sticking out by six inches.
speaker_heading: BRUTISH GUARD (cont’d)
dialog: Turn it on its face, imbeciles! Nail them
dialog: DOWN FLAT, damn you all, or his
dialog: majesty’1l drop off the minute we plant
dialog: this tree! UP and OVER..!
text: The men take hold of one whole side of the cross and HEAVE it
text: upward until it TEETERS perilously on its SIDE.
text: There is a minute of suspended motion, then the cross slowly
text: DROPS ON ITS FACE. As it FALLS, THREATENING TO CRUSH JESUS
text: UNDER ITS WEIGHT, TIME SLOWS DOWN.
text: MAGDALEN covers her face with her hands.
text: ABENADAR tries to control his mount, which has raised itself
text: on its hind legs and is backing away, snorting and shaking
dialog: its head.
text: MARY and JOHN rush forward, eyes wide with horror.
text: The ROMAN FOOTSOLDIERS all turn to look as the CROWD gasp in

dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: CAIPHAS, ANNAS and the members of the SANHEDRIM have gone
text: still as they watch the cross COLLAPSE ONTO JESUS.
text: Even DISMAS and GESMAS, suffering though they are on THEIR
text: crosses, watch with foreboding.
text: The NOISE of the wood CRASHING onto ground is TREMENDOUS,
text: A CLOUD OF DUST. Silence.
scene_heading: FADE TO BLACK:
scene_heading: EXT, GOLGOTHA. DAY.
text: Darkness gradually enlarges to light. The silence is broken
text: by the METALLIC SOUND OF HAMMERS ON IRON. Then the
text: PICTURE of the UPSIDE-DOWN CROSS, the POINTS OF THE NAILS
text: bending under rhythmic hammer-blows.
text: MAGDALEN’s tear-filled eyes blink with each impact. She has
text: not moved from where she was when the cross went over. Now
text: she lowers herself to the ground and LOOKS.
speaker_heading: MAGDALEN’s POV:
text: The CROSS is SOLIDLY UPSIDE DOWN, yet NO PART OF JESUS
text: touches the ground underneath it.
text: MAGDALEN raises her head, looks at the faces of the
text: EXECUTIONERS, then at the BRUTISH Temple GUARD, at ABENADAR,
text: the soldiers...NO ONE HAS SEEN WHAT SHE HAS.
text: MARY and JOHN, through a FOG. Now visible, now gone. They
text: haven’t MOVED A MUSCLE. They haven’t seen it either.
text: MAGDALEN lowers her head to the ground, and again looks.
text: JESUS HOVERS above the ground, in a SPACE which WAS NOT THERE
text: UNTIL HE OCCUPIED IT. MAGDALEN’s eyes close.
text: The HAMMERING STOPS. A CACOPHONY of shouts and jeers errupts
text: from the crowd, punctuated by sadistic LAUGHTER.
speaker_heading: BRUTISH GUARD (0S)
dialog: Get the ropes ready. There. NO...not the
dialog: arms, you blathering fools... the TRUNK!
dialog: That’s it.
text: MAGDALEN lifts her face, glares at the BRUTISH GUARD.
speaker_heading: BRUTISH GUARD (cont’d)
dialog: Now straighten it. Quickly. We don’t want

dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The sweaty, grumbling EXECUTIONERS take up the arm they used

text: The BRUTISH GUARD looks worried as he peers at JESUS, whose
text: body DANGLES awkwardly and in terrible agony.
speaker_heading: BRUTISH GUARD (cont’d)
text: ON ITS BACK. QUICKLY. LET GO...NOW!
text: The CROSS CRASHES to the ground, right side up.
text: The EXECUTIONERS rush forward, tie ROPES to the arms of the
text: cross then haul these to a BEAM fixed to the ground at the
text: HOLE on the highest point of the plateau.
speaker_heading: BRUTISH GUARD (cont’d)
text: MOVE THE FOOT TOWARD THE BEAM,..AIM it,
dialog: you simpleton! That’s it! NOW PULL, ALL
dialog: OF YOU!
text: The EXECUTIONERS pull the ropes, grunting rhythmically, The
text: CROSS starts to LIFT. TWO of the men wrap a THICK ROPE around
text: the foot of the trunk, to prevent it from sliding in
text: sideways, SLOWLY the cross continues to rise up over
speaker_heading: GOLGOTHA,
text: Then, with one last heave by the men, the cross DROPS into
text: the hole prepared for its reception. A GREAT SHOCK.
text: The ENTIRE BODY OF JESUS is STRETCHED off the nails and
text: ropes, and the wounds on his hands and feet TEAR open. JESUS
text: cries out.
text: ALL SOUND CEASES. Then a long, low RUMBLE OF THUNDER.
text: The FULL EXTENT OF THE TORTURE JESUS HAS ENDURED IS NOW
text: VISIBLE FOR ALL TO SEE. THERE IS SO LITTLE FLESH LEFT ON HIS
scene_heading: BODY, SO LITTLE MOVEMENT THAT HE APPEARS TO BE DEAD, HIS HEAD
text: LOWERED TO HIS RAW CHEST. ONLY THE CONTINUOUS FLOW OF BLOOD
text: INDICATES THAT HE IS STILL ALIVE.
text: The EXECUTIONERS now BACK AWAY from the crosses.
text: MARY and JOHN, followed by SIMON and MAGDALEN, slowly
text: APPROACH the cross of JESUS.
text: ABENADAR watches them step forward with dignity. He climbs
text: off his horse, eyes glued to the bleeding figure of JESUS.
text: JOHN is first to reach the cross, and looks up.
scene_heading: FADE TO WHITE:
dialog: 81.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE OF NICODEMUS. JERUSALEM, NIGHT.
text: The APOSTLES watch in silence as, still suffused with
text: BRIGHTNESS, JESUS puts down the plate on which He had placed
text: the MORCELS of BREAD. He picks up the CHALICE on which the
text: plate had rested, and turns to PETER.
text: PETER POURS wine into the CHALICE. It is a DEEP RED WINE and,
text: as it FLOWS into the chalice, it is suffused with the RADIANT
text: LIGHT coming from JESUS. When the chalice is full, He lifts
text: it over His head with both hands.
speaker_heading: JESUS
dialog: T will not drink again of the fruit of
dialog: the vine until that day when I shall
dialog: drink again with you in the kingdom of my
dialog: Father.
text: JESUS lowers the CHALICE, takes a small sip of wine and hands
text: the chalice to JOHN.
speaker_heading: JESUS (cont'd)
dialog: Take and drink; this is my blood which is
dialog: given for you.
text: JOHN looks at the WINE inside the chalice, then again at the
text: RESPLENDENT face of JESUS.
speaker_heading: JESUS (cont’d)
dialog: Do this in memory of me.
speaker_heading: cuT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GOLGOTHA. DAY.
text: The BLOOD of JESUS is RUNNING along His torn limbs and down
text: the length of the cross to the ground.
text: JOHN’s eyes follow the flow and fill with fresh tears. MARY
text: stands next to him, her eyes lifted to the face of her Son.
text: Her eyes are open and DRY. They meet His with a love and a
dialog: dignity only matched by His own.
text: A NEARBY laugh, low and filled with malevolent scorn:
speaker_heading: GESMAS
dialog: If you are the son of God, Jesus of
dialog: Nazareth, why don’t you save yourself?
dialog: Climb dewn off that cross...prove to us
dialog: that you are who you say you are,
text: JESUS slowly turns His eyes away from those of MARY.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: GESMAS scans the gathered witnesses, particularly to CAIPHAS,
dialog: ANNAS and the rest of the members of the Sanhedrim and,
text: gritting his teeth, growls derisively:
speaker_heading: GESMAS (cont’d)
dialog: Ha! I tell you, the demon this fool is
text: possessed by is about to leave him.
text: CAIPHAS approaches and looks up arrogantly at JESUS.
speaker_heading: CAIPHAS
dialog: You said you could destroy the Temple and
dialog: rebuild it in three days...and yet you
dialog: cannot come down, off that cross.
text: He turns and faces the crowd of witnesses:
speaker_heading: CAIPHAS (cont’d)
dialog: If he is the Christ, the King of Israel,
dialog: I say let him come down from the cross,
dialog: that we may see and believe
text: This is met by derisive laughter by many in the crowd.
text: CAIPHAS laughs, starts to walk away.
text: JESUS lifts His head upward and in a low voice:
speaker_heading: JESUS
dialog: Father, forgive them, for they know not
dialog: what they do.
text: CAIPHAS stops dead in his tracks, an astonished look on his
text: face. He turns, looks at JESUS on the cross.
text: DISMAS, who has watched the performance of GESMAS and CAIPHAS
text: with distaste, now speaks out:
speaker_heading: DISMAS
dialog: Listen to him. He is praying for you. He
dialog: is truly a prophet I say to you, a king,
dialog: the son of God.
text: This causes the jeers to commence again, though less noisily,
text: more hesitant. CAIPHAS spits at DISMAS, then withdraws again
text: to the margins of the execution ground. DISMAS then turns to
speaker_heading: GESMAS:
speaker_heading: DISMAS (cont’d)
dialog: How can you speak the way you do? We
dialog: deserve this, Gesmas, but he does not. He
dialog: has done no evil!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: DISMAS then bursts into tears of pain and guilt:
speaker_heading: DISMAS (cont'd)
dialog: I have sinned, Jesus, and I am being
dialog: justly punished. Condemn me, go ahead.
dialog: You would be justified...
text: JESUS turns to DISMAS who, in agony, is hyperventilating with
text: pain. He is dying, eyes turned to JESUS.
speaker_heading: DISMAS (cont’d)
dialog: T ask only that you remember me, Lord,
dialog: when you enter your kingdom.
speaker_heading: JESUS
dialog: Amen, I tell you, on this day you shall
dialog: be with me in Paradise.
text: DISMAS becomes RIGID. Air rattles out of his mouth. Slowly
text: his features relax and he slumps down.
text: GESMAS ROARS with demonic laughter. His malice is what seems
dialog: to keep him alive.
text: JESUS turns to MARY and JOHN, MAGDALEN, SIMON and ABENADAR
text: who has joined them at the foot of the CROSS.
text: MARY and JOHN reach out and TOUCH THE FEET OF JESUS.
text: JESUS is breathing with difficulty. He tries to speak again,
text: but His lips are so parched that a moment passes before the
dialog: words can form:
speaker_heading: JESUS (cont’d)
dialog: I thirst.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JESUS (cont’d)
dialog: Could you not have given me a little
dialog: water?
text: JOHN turns, mortified, to MARY. Then again at JESUS:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (whisper)
dialog: We did not think, Lord...
text: One of the ROMAN SOLDIERS nearby pours some liquid into a
text: SPONGE and approaches the cross. ABENADAR stops him:

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: ABENADAR
dialog: No, don’t mix vinegar with gall. Give him
dialog: only vinegar. It will give him some
dialog: relief...
text: The SOLDIER squeezes out the liquid, refills the sponge with
text: vinegar, places the sponge on a long reed and lifts it to the
text: mouth of JESUS, who drinks from it.
text: MARY’s face looks as if it might suffer fracture.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (whisper)
dialog: Oh Jesus, let me die with you... flesh
dialog: of my flesh bone of my bone, heart of my
dialog: heart...
text: JESUS transfixes her with His eyes, then He looks at JOHN
speaker_heading: JESUS
dialog: Woman, behold, he is your son,
text: From JOHN He turns again to MARY:
speaker_heading: JESUS (cont/’d)
dialog: John, behold, she is your mother.
text: MARY is overcome, She breaks into breathless sobs. JOHN
text: helps her step away from the cross. ABENADAR
text: takes the elbows of MAGDALEN and SIMON and guides them away
text: from the cross, following JOHN and MARY.
text: An eerie SILENCE has fallen on the scene of crucifixion.
text: GESMAS turns to JESUS and laughs.
speaker_heading: GESMAS
dialog: See them? They are running away...
dialog: abandoning you. You are alone.
text: There is no one left. No one.
text: JESUS lifts his eyes to the darkness enfolding GOLGOTHA. His
text: eyes fill with tears, which mingle with the blood pouring
text: down His cheeks.
text: Suddenly, in the HEAVY SILENCE, with a violent spasm of His
text: tortured body, He shouts in a clear, powerful voice:
speaker_heading: JESUS
dialog: Eloi, Eloi, lamma sabacthani? (My God, my
dialog: God, why have you forsaken me?)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
text: MARY hears the cry of JESUS, She spins around to look at the
text: cross, which stands out against a dark silver sky, slips away
text: from JOHN’s sustaining hands and runs back.
text: MARY is now the only one near the cross. Her suffering is so
text: much a part of JESUS’ own, and her KNOWLEDGE of the moment a
text: mysterious part of what is taking place that the REST of the
text: men and women on GOLGOTHA do not interfere.
text: JESUS’ eyes are closed. His tears, mixed with the blood of
text: His passion, roll off His cheeks to the ground.
text: JESUS’ eyes open and He SEES MARY. There is a silent moment
text: of transcendental understanding in each of their expressions,
text: of anticipation, pain and relief. Then:
speaker_heading: JESUS (cont'd)
dialog: (softly)
text: It is accomplished.
text: The ONLY LIGHT NOW seems to emanate from JESUS’ face.
text: MARY, alone, now witnesses JESUS as He slowly raises His head
text: to the silver~dark heavens and in a strong voice.
speaker_heading: JESUS (cont'd)
dialog: Father, into Thy hands...I commend... my
