speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: Ah, Michael? I'm Chad.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: We'd like a dual horse-shoe formation for
dialog: the meeting set-up - an enclave for Ms
dialog: Clark, an enclave for the Pentagon
dialog: delegation. First names acceptable to all
dialog: parties and politely we request the
dialog: presence of both carbonated and non-

speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: Thanks so much.
text: He walks purposefully off.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: My God. Who was that, Young Lankenstein?
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Oh he'll be running something relatively

dialog: It's like Bugsy Malone, but with real

scene_heading: 18 INT. FOREIGN OFFICE GRAND MEETING ROOM - DAY 18
text: Chad's dual horse-shoe is packed with people. The room's
dialog: pretty much full.
text: KAREN CLARK from the State Department is surrounded by
text: ten or so aides and functionaries, security people and
dialog: assistants. (Including Chad and LIZA one of Karen's
text: senior aides.) Then there is Bob Adriano's gang of
text: advisors, smaller but sitting separately.
text: Next to them is a Pentagon delegation, including
text: uniformed members of all three services.
text: Lots of hubbub.
text: SUZY leads SIMON, TOBY and JUDY in, and shows them to
dialog: their seats.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: 18 CON TINUE D: 18
text: They're as far away from the US delegation as it's
text: possible to be, and Simon's seat is actually behind a
text: pillar. Suzy goes off to join Michael and the Foreign
text: Office delegation near the front. Suzy looks over to
text: Toby, uses her hands to make mock binoculars, as if to
dialog: say, 'you're very far away, look how close and therefore
dialog: important I am'.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: No-one will hear me if I say anything.
dialog: How's your view? Can we swap?
text: Simon and Toby swap seats, but Simon can still barely see
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: SIMON (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Judy)
dialog: Can I swap with you?
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I think the meeting's starting.
dialog: It is.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Well, quickly then, swap.
text: Simon and Judy swap seats.
text: The meeting is now underway. We're with Karen Clark.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: We all agree this is a very tough time,
dialog: but I don't want a consensus to form
dialog: around the premise that conflict is
dialog: necessarily the primary option at this
dialog: point.
text: Back with Simon, Judy and Toby. Simon still straining to
dialog: see.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Are people thinking that? That's -- a bit
dialog: hardcore.
text: He cranes again to see.
speaker_heading: SIMON (CONT'D)
dialog: No, this is worse. Swap back.
text: Simon and Judy swap seats again.
text: Back with Karen. She's holding up a paper in a red

speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: This paper, authored by one of my aides,

dialog: grounding this do you Liza?
text: Liza reacts. Her paper? In a big meeting. Is this good or
dialog: bad?
speaker_heading: KAREN (CONT'D)
dialog: Illuminates the logistical factors we
text: face. She highlights a number of reasons
dialog: why, in practical terms, we can't
dialog: envision a theatre deployment for twelve
dialog: months.
speaker_heading: BOB ADRIANO
dialog: Although not everyone might agree with
dialog: the assumptions made in that paper.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Really - such as what?
speaker_heading: BOB ADRIANO
dialog: The committee feels a much quicker
dialog: deployment is possible.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Which committee?
speaker_heading: BOB ADRIANO
dialog: (covering)
dialog: This has been discussed in a number of
dialog: committees. If I said one committee...
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You did.
speaker_heading: ADRIANO
dialog: Then that was a slip of the tongue
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Have you accidentally alluded to some
dialog: secret committee? A war committee?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: If I can interject here, I'm aware we're
dialog: pushed for time. I'd like to move us on
dialog: agenda-wise. Our next item is
dialog: international relief co-ordination.
text: Karen is conferring with Liza, Adriano with his guy.

speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: (to Judy and Toby)
dialog: Should I say something? She invited me, I
dialog: should say something. If you don't say
dialog: something in the first 10 minutes, you
dialog: can end up not saying anything at all.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I don't know whether you should say
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: I'm saying something ... I think I'm
dialog: going to try saying something.
text: Simon goes to put his hand up, Toby maybe puts a calming
text: hand on his hand. They look at one another. Has Toby
dialog: crossed a line?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Look - I just think it's worth noting
dialog: that Ministers in The UK Government,

speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: She's talking about me!
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Has made it clear that for them currently

dialog: Simon?
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Well, yes, I mean, that's what I said.
dialog: And I stick to what I said.
text: SIMON sits down. Them stands back up.
speaker_heading: SIMON (CONT'D)
dialog: But that doesn't mean that what I said

dialog: here and see how much time we have at the
dialog: end for this discussion?
dialog: He's ended the debate.
text: Suzy comes round the back of the meeting all smiles and
text: hands Judy a note with a smile.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Thanks.
text: She opens the note it reads, `Simon is acting like a
dialog: massive tit. Stop him.'
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: Is that all fine?
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: That's all fine. Thanks for that.
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: Thanks.

text: look pleased. Karen is still talking to the meeting.
text: Simon shuts up. He'll have this out later.

text: The big meeting is breaking up. Simon is annoyed, leading
text: Judy and Toby out of the room and into any private space
text: he can find - they back into a huge huge ballroom
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Come here - we need to talk
dialog: (they go into the massive

dialog: What do you mean stop being a `tit'? In
dialog: what way was I being a tit? Why am I even
dialog: over here if I'm not meant to say
dialog: anything?
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: You were just meat in the room, Simon.
speaker_heading: SIMON

dialog: Whichever committee they don't want me to

speaker_heading: LIZA
dialog: Okay. Right.
text: Chad arrives. Karen talks to someone else.
speaker_heading: CHAD

dialog: trying.
speaker_heading: LIZA
