text: Paddy grips the steering wheel with labor-calloused hands and
text: drives over the P.J. McArdle Bridge and up a winding hill. He
text: listens to "MOBY DICK" on tape as the last piece of daylight

scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - SAME
dialog: 
text: TOMMY CONLON (28), hard miles on a handsome face, sits on the

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PADDY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Paddy pulls up to the curb in front of the house, clicks off

dialog: eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: Tommy?
dialog: 
text: Tommy gives a drunken, crooked smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PADDY (CONT'D)
dialog: What're you doing here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I was just passing through. Figured
dialog: why not have a belt with the old
dialog: man.
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Father and son look at each other. It's obvious it's been a
text: long, long time. Tommy takes a bemused look down at the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY (CONT'D)
text: She looks good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: (patting car hood)
dialog: Yeah, she's hanging in there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Well, you always did take good care
dialog: of her. Paddy Conlon. Man of
dialog: priorities.
dialog: 
text: Paddy grins uncomfortably. Lets the remark go and climbs the
text: stairs as Tommy reaches into his duffel bag and produces a
text: fresh BOTTLE of Jameson. He offers it to Paddy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Got a little something for ya. Mom
dialog: always said never go anywhere empty
dialog: handed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: She did. But that's not for me
dialog: anymore, Tommy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: What? You change brands?
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. PADDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Paddy and Tommy walk through the front door. The house is

text: stands in the den and looks around, breathing the old place
text: in, as Paddy makes his way into the kitchen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I like what you've done with the
dialog: place.
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PADDY (O.S.)
dialog: Appreciate that.
dialog: 
text: The sound of glasses CLINKING in the kitchen as Tommy takes
text: off his watch cap and begins to look around his old home. He
text: glances down at a BIBLE on a table beside a weathered Barca
text: lounge chair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: There's not much of a woman's touch
dialog: around here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PADDY (O.S.)
dialog: No more women for me, Tommy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Yeah? Must be hard to find a girl
dialog: who can take a punch nowadays.
dialog: 
text: Tommy takes another swig from his bottle and looks at a
text: series of old PHOTOGRAPHS lining the walls as Paddy walks
text: into the room carrying a coffee pot and saucers on an old
text: wicker tray. Tommy looks at him, incredulous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: Here you go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Coffee? You haven't seen a guy in

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: I told you, I'm off it. I'm coming

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: C'mon, just one drink.

speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: No.

dialog: 
text: Tommy's eyes are drawn to another picture, likely taken at a

speaker_heading: PADDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Remember Tess? They've got two

dialog: 
text: Tommy turns back to the photos and looks at another one of
text: the woman. Obviously his MOTHER. He puts it down, glances at
text: the bible, then stares hard at Paddy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: So you found God, huh? That's
dialog: awesome. Mom kept calling for him,
dialog: but he wasn't around. I guess Jesus
dialog: was down at the mill forgiving all
dialog: the drunks. Who knew?
dialog: 
text: Paddy sips his coffee. Says nothing. Tommy keeps pressing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: So, you gonna ask about her, or you
dialog: just gonna sit there all sober?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: I know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Oh, you know? What do you know? Do
dialog: you know it wasn't enough just to
dialog: drive west to get away from you?
dialog: When we hit the water we drove
dialog: north, too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: When I got sober I hired a man to

speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: (taking a swig)
dialog: Is that one of the 12 steps? Or
dialog: does a guy like you get 24?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: Just the 12.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Did your guy tell you what you
dialog: needed to know?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: Just that your mother died in
dialog: Tacoma. And you were in the
dialog: Marines. That was all. That was
dialog: enough.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: That's too bad. You could've gotten
dialog: some good details.

speaker_heading: TOMMY (CONT'D)

dialog: save her. Did your man tell you
dialog: that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: I'm sorry, Tommy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: It's good to know you're sorry,
dialog: Pop. Goes a long way.
dialog: 
text: Paddy chokes up. Tommy looks at him. Closes his eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: I think I liked you better when you
dialog: were a drunk.
dialog: 
text: An overwhelmed Paddy sips his coffee and looks at Tommy, who
text: is fading. The pills are kicking in. He tries to open his
text: eyes, but it's no use, and after a few moments he's out.
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Paddy glances down, where some pills have fallen out of
text: Tommy's pocket and scattered on the rug. He watches his son.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Em, you want to open your presents?
dialog: 
text: The make-over ends abruptly at the mention of "presents."
text: Emily, little sister in tow, runs over to a table filled with
text: gifts as PARENTS and CHILDREN gather around.
dialog: 
text: Brendan gets out of the lawn chair and follows Tess over to
text: the gift table. Amidst all the presents is one BOX, covered
text: in pink wrapping paper, that is far larger than the rest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TESS (CONT'D)
dialog: (off pink box)
dialog: This an awfully big box.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: It's her birthday.

scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Hey babe, I'm late. Mom's saying
dialog: goodbye to the girls. She's gotta

speaker_heading: TITO
dialog: Acceleration.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Acceleration, right. If you have

dialog: 
text: Brendan, sleeves rolled up and a bemused look on his face,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (CONT'D)
dialog: There we go. Alright Tito, well

speaker_heading: BRENDAN (CONT'D)

dialog: 
text: He turns and shoos away the two cheerleaders peering in the

text: is putting a beating on his SPARRING PARTNER. The obsequious
text: nature of the entourage makes it clear that Mad Dog is
dialog: somebody important.
dialog: 
text: In the ring, the sparring partner takes a vicious spinning
text: back fist to the chin, goes down in a heap, and doesn't get
text: up. COLT BOYD (40s), clearly in charge, throws up his hands
text: as Mad Dog laughs.

speaker_heading: COLT BOYD
dialog: Do me a favor guy, go back to your

dialog: 
text: Colt Boyd waves Tommy into the ring. Mad Dog's entourage
text: starts whispering amongst themselves. Snickering at what lays
text: in wait for Tommy as the fallen sparring partner is helped
text: out of the ring.
dialog: 
text: A TRAINER tapes Tommy's hands and gives him some MMA gloves.
text: He slips them on, then at the sound of a BUZZER he starts
text: moving toward Mad Dog, who smirks at Tommy's aggression and
text: then starts circling him. Tommy nails him with a front kick
text: to the chest. Grimes staggers back and shakes it off.
dialog: 14.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAD DOG
dialog: Gonna be a hero? Alright.
dialog: 
text: He crouches down, gets serious. He throws a right. Blocked. A

text: does it again. And again. Then he DECKS HIM with a hard
text: right, sending Mad Dog to the canvas to the shock of his
text: entourage and Colt Boyd.
dialog: 
text: Fenroy looks up from his post and walks over to the ring.
text: Within moments everyone in the gym stops what they're doing
text: and watches as Tommy grabs the back of Mad Dog's head, hauls
text: it down, and launches knee after knee into his face.
dialog: 
text: Tommy starts throwing Mad Dog around like a rag doll,
text: striking him with vicious punches and kicks, as Fenroy pulls
text: out his CELL PHONE and starts filming the action. As Colt
text: Boyd screams at Mad Dog to cover up, Tommy shoves him against
text: the ropes and blasts away.
dialog: 
text: Tommy continues to pound. It's a full-fledged beating going
text: on in there. Finally, he crushes Mad Dog with a vicious left
text: hook and sends him sprawling through the ropes, UNCONSCIOUS.
dialog: 
text: SILENCE in the gym. What the hell just happened here? The
text: entourage rushes to Mad Dog's aid, but he's out cold. Colt

dialog: That's the problem. It's the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: You said that three times already.
dialog: I get that. But I'm asking you if

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAN TAYLOR
dialog: Well, you've already refinanced

speaker_heading: BRENDAN

speaker_heading: DAN TAYLOR

speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: 90 days is not enough. My wife and

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAN TAYLOR
dialog: Let me ask you a question: have you

speaker_heading: BRENDAN (CONT'D)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: Ah, Brendan. I was a drunk. I mean,

speaker_heading: BRENDAN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIDAN (V.O.)
dialog: I wish I knew, Bryan. I wish I knew

dialog: fact that I don't know is strange.
dialog: In an internet age where there are
dialog: no secrets, this guy is a complete

dialog: But the reason a lot of his fans
dialog: are in the stands is because of

dialog: stunning than the Mad Dog Grimes
dialog: video. Let me describe it for you
dialog: folks for the few who haven't seen
dialog: it, and I don't know anyone who
dialog: hasn't, but Tommy Riordan ripped

dialog: battle, saving lives in the

dialog: the door off a tank!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIDAN (V.O.)
dialog: Tommy Riordan is a genuine war

dialog: reputation is larger than life.
dialog: 
text: The crowd strains to get a look at the legend as he makes his

text: takes a quick glance at Koba, then looks away. She can't bear
dialog: it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I want you to look right at him
dialog: when he comes in here. Don't take

dialog:

speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm proud of you brother. This is
dialog: your cage.
dialog: 
text: Finally, the creepy music subsides, and the great Russian
text: climbs into the cage. He's massive, and the crowd stares at
text: him like an exotic animal.
dialog: 
text: Josh Rosenthal calls Brendan and Koba to the center of the
text: cage. The Russian looks at Brendan with the cold,

speaker_heading: CALLEN (V.O.)
dialog: Now the question is, how long can
dialog: Brendan Conlon stay alive?
dialog: 
text: Franks screams at Brendan to keep his distance. Tess watches
text: through her fingers. And Koba keeps coming, snapping
text: Brendan's head back with a jab and bludgeoning him with an
text: uppercut to the chin. The Russian is doing whatever he wants
text: to Brendan. He slices him up with strikes. Bruises his legs
text: with kicks. Works him against the fence. Power slams him.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLEN (V.O.)

text: The minutes passes in no time. It's time to go again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSH ROSENTHAL
dialog: Let's go to war!
dialog: 
text: Koba comes right after Brendan, and it's soon more of the
text: same. Power slams. Brutal strikes. Brendan's face is carved
text: up and battered. He tries to go for a take down, but Koba
text: snuffs it, then lifts Brendan off the mat again and carries
text: him through the air. Frank screams, but there's nothing he
text: can do. Brendan is brutally SLAMMED into the ground.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIDAN (V.O.)
dialog: Uh oh, Brendan's going for ride!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLEN (V.O.)
dialog: That one shook the entire building!
dialog: 
text: As Brendan writhes on the ground, Koba grabs him and slings
text: him against the fence like it's nothing. Brendan flies
text: through the air and RATTLES against the cage. Then Koba
text: climbs on top of him and starts whaling away. Tess can't even
text: watch it. Once again, just as Rosenthal is about to stop the
text: fight, the HORN sounds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIDAN (V.O.)
dialog: Everyone has gotta be concerned
dialog: about Brendan Conlon's bravery
dialog: getting him into trouble here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLEN (V.O.)
dialog: His bravery can get him killed,
dialog: Sam. He's got nothing more to
dialog: prove. He's already lasted two
dialog: rounds against Koba, which is more
dialog: than anyone else can say. You
dialog: wonder what's keeping this guy up.
dialog: 
text: Brendan drags himself off the ground and limps to his stool.
text: Frank enters the cage. His usual positive attitude is gone.
text: He comes at Brendan with aggression instead.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Sit down. Breathe.
dialog: (grabbing Brendan's face)
dialog: Look at me! Look at me! Why are we

dialog: me, `cause if we're not, I'll throw
dialog: in the towel right now. We'll get
dialog: Tess and we will go home. You don't
dialog: knock him out, you lose the fight.
dialog: Understand me? You don't knock him
dialog: out, you don't have a home.
dialog: 
text: Josh Rosenthal claps his hands. Frank takes his cue to leave,
text: but not before giving Brendan one last look. It's now or
text: never. Brendan looks across the cage at Koba. Steels himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSH ROSENTHAL
dialog: Let's go to war!
dialog: 
text: Brendan comes out and meets Koba in the center of the cage,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLEN (V.O.)
text: Conlon somehow answering the bell
dialog: for round three, but Koba's all

dialog: 
text: Koba roughs the battered Brendan up some more, but then
text: Brendan starts responding. Throws a couple effective leg
text: kicks. A decent punch or two.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIDAN (V.O.)
dialog: Brendan's giving back, Bryan. There

dialog: out.
dialog: 
text: Frank screams at Brendan to stay calm. To wait for his
text: moment. Koba continues to squeeze. Brendan's face turns more

text: the strength he has left, and TOSSES the Russian on his back,
text: freeing himself from the choke in the process.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLEN (V.O.)

dialog: 
text: Tommy, flap down, tears of pain pouring down his face, stands
text: defiantly in his corner. In the other corner, Frank attends
text: Brendan. In the crowd, Tess covers her mouth. She can't
dialog: believe what Tommy allowed to happen to him.
dialog: 
text: Frank puts the stool down and gives Brendan some water.
text: Brendan's face is wracked with guilt and concern over his
dialog: brother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Relax, breathe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I heard it tear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You popped his shoulder? Good. I
dialog: want you to pop his other shoulder.
dialog: 
text: This is not what Brendan wants to hear. He looks over to Josh
dialog: Rosenthal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Josh!
dialog: 100.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Frank snaps. Grabs Brendan by the face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hey! Hey! No Josh! Look at me! You
dialog: got two rounds left! You need both
dialog: rounds! Go in there, kick him in
text: the head, take him down, and finish
dialog: him!
dialog: 
text: Rosenthal claps his hands. Frank exits the cage. The wounded
text: Tommy stands in his corner, his ruined left arm hanging low.
text: Brendan makes eye contact with him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Tommy! What are you doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Shut up! C'mon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: What are you that crazy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSH ROSENTHAL
dialog: Let's go to war!
dialog: 
text: The BELL sounds. Round Four begins. Tommy throws useless
text: right jabs. He's one handed and has no chance. Brendan stays
text: away from him, not wanting to hurt his brother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: What are you doing? It's over!
dialog: 
text: Frank screams at Brendan from cageside to take the wounded
text: Tommy out, but Brendan is reluctant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (CONT'D)
dialog: It's over, Tommy. C'mon. We don't
dialog: have to do this.
dialog: 
text: Tommy and Brendan circle each other. Tommy throwing rights
text: and wincing in agony at any movement. Brendan stares at him.
text: Everything about him says "Quit, Tommy." But Tommy won't.

scene_heading: INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA TUNNEL - SAME
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BOARDWALK HALL CAGE - SAME
dialog: 
text: Brendan continues to circle and not engage. Frank is livid.
text: He knows he'll lose the fight on the judges' scorecards if he
dialog: doesn't do something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Finish him! You finish him!
dialog: 
text: Tommy keeps throwing defiant right jabs at Brendan. Finally,
text: with no choice, Brendan fires back. He batters the
text: defenseless Tommy up against the cage and POUNDS away at him,
text: blasting his left shoulder with punches that make Tommy wince
dialog: in pain. It's anyone's guess how he can take it.
dialog: 
text: Brendan presses his brother up against the cage. Begging him
text: to quit. But Tommy merely responds by elbowing Brendan in the
text: face again. This sets the older brother off, and he resumes
text: pounding on Tommy until the HORN sounds and Rosenthal pulls
dialog: Brendan away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSH ROSENTHAL
dialog: Break! Break!
dialog: 
text: Brendan heads back to his stool as Tommy leans against the
text: cage in agony. The Marines scream for him, but his eyes are
text: glazed over. It's unthinkable that he hasn't broken yet.
dialog: 
text: From near cageside, Paddy looks to the corner and makes eye
text: contact with Brendan. They exchange a small look of
text: understanding. A NOD. They both know what needs to be done.
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Tommy and Brendan stand for Round Five. Tommy's face is
text: battered after Round Four and Brendan's face is ruined.
dialog: 102.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: In the crowd, the "Tommy" CHANT begins in earnest. In fact,
dialog: it may be louder than ever. Having done the impossible and
text: carried on with one arm, Tommy is more superhuman and heroic
text: than ever before. But his face tells another story. Soaked in
text: pain and anguish. All his stoic walls crumbling down.

text: and squeezes. Tommy struggles, but he's got one arm and
text: there's NO ESCAPE. His face getting red from lack of oxygen.
dialog: 
text: As an anguished Tess and a shaken Paddy look on, Brendan
text: CHOKES his brother. As he does, he pleads with him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I'm sorry, Tommy! I'm sorry!
dialog: 
text: Tommy continues to struggle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Tap, Tommy! Tap!
dialog: 
text: Tears pour down Tommy's face. Brendan is crushing his wind
text: pipe. Tommy's eyes bulge.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I love you, Tommy! I love you!
dialog: 
text: Tommy, about to pass out, no more air to breathe, slowly
text: opens his left hand, looks at Brendan, and TAPS his shoulder
text: on the Conlon family crest. Finally submitting.

scene_heading: INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME
dialog: 
text: Tommy buries his head in Brendan's chest. A torrent of
text: sobbing gushes from him, years of pain pouring out in heavy
text: bursts. From the crowd, Paddy stares into the cage and
text: watches as Brendan comforts his little brother, then helps
text: him to his feet.
dialog: 
text: Callen, Sheridan, and J.J. Riley make their way inside for

text: Frank continuing to run interference, Brendan pushes through
text: the crush of people, arm around Tommy, and exits the cage.
dialog: 
text: The crowd parts for Tommy and Brendan. Paddy watches them, a
