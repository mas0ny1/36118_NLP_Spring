text: A full moon pokes a white hole in a black sky. 0.S. we
text: hear FESTIVE ROCK ‘N ROLL and the WHOOPS and HOLLERS of
scene_heading: JOYFUL REVELERS.
text: We PAN DOWN TO Spooky Island, a tropical island/theme
text: park. This cheesy tourist trap is hardly a Disneyland or
dialog: Magic Mountain, nor even, sad to say, a Legoland. Like
dialog: Rome, it was not built in a day. Unlike Rome, it very
dialog: well likely could have been.
text: We PASS a colorful Fiberglass “haunted" castle that sits
text: atop a small mountain. We PASS palm trees and huge
text: papier mache heads impaled on stakes. We APPROACH a lit
dialog: sign that reads: °
text: WELCO E TO SP ORY ISLAND
text: WHERE FEAR IS Y UR ONLY FRIEND
text: We MOVE PAST the sign and OUT OVER a crowd of college
text: students. Dancing. Partying. Pouring beer on
text: themselves and each other. Men in skeleton costumes
text: pounce out of the shadows frightening nary a soul.
text: We MOVE TO a film crew following a pretty, peppy
text: REPORTER. The Reporter walks through the young people.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: We MOVE ON, PAST cardboard gravestones wobbling in the
text: WIND. PAST island natives -- that is, employees of
dialog: various ethnicities wearing grass skirts and war paint --
text: holding a limbo stick for students. PAST a hunchback
text: boinking giggling visitors with a plush hammer.
text: We ARRIVE AT a rocky mountainside, where a young, sullen-
text: looking woman, ISABEL ROGERS, sits on the stoop of a fake
text: gallows. Isabel is "Goth." She wears all black. Her
text: hair is dyed black and gelled into tall spikes. Her eyes
text: are circled by thick, dark rings of makeup.
text: Two fat, sweaty students slam their hairy bellies
text: together in front of her.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: This place sucks.
text: Isabel’s friend MANDY stands beside her, peering through

speaker_heading: MANDY

scene_heading: INT. WOODEN HALL

speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: Ha! It’s another one of those

speaker_heading: MANDY

scene_heading: INT. DOORWAY HALL

dialog: inside. .
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMB FRONT OFFICE

dialog: is... What kind of mask?
speaker_heading: SHAGGY
dialog: So you’1l go with us?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Can’t, Shag. My book tour.
dialog: Tomorrow I’m off to Evanston, I --
speaker_heading: SHAGGY

speaker_heading: SHAGGY

speaker_heading: FRED

dialog: Right? He’s not a real guy, is

text: Fred is struck by an idea.
speaker_heading: FRED
text: It could be a hypno-wheel.
speaker_heading: SHAGGY
dialog: Those red-and-white twirly things

speaker_heading: FRED

speaker_heading: PSYCHOLOGIST

speaker_heading: SHAGGY

speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Well, Scoob, you have to admit --
dialog: relatively speaking, measured
dialog: against a human, you are a moron.
text: Scooby, offended, snatches a notebook off the back seat.
text: He furiously writes something on it.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: So, Velma, are you in? This’1ll be
dialog: a real doozy of a news story if
dialog: all five of us go.
speaker_heading: VELMA
dialog: On one condition. When we
text: announce the hypno-wheel to the
dialog: press, I take the TV interviews.
text: Scooby shows the notebook to Velma, to prove that he’s
dialog: not a moron. It reads:
dialog: 12
dialog: +7
dialog: = 12
speaker_heading: VELMA
dialog: That’s not right.
text: Scooby fiddles with the equation. Fred looks at Shaggy.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: But it’s tradition that I do that.
speaker_heading: VELMA
dialog: Fine. Forget it.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Breaking tradition, that’s like...

speaker_heading: VELMA
dialog: Okay, when we get in there, just
dialog: follow my lead. Daphne’s not

speaker_heading: FRED

text: over them. She downs one with a swipe to the spine and
text: another with a heel to the kidney.
text: Daphne stands frozen, crouched, her fist out in front of

speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: Where are you go -- What do you
dialog: mean, ‘you understand?’
speaker_heading: VELMA
dialog: It’s easy for us. But for you,
dialog: always getting captured and tied
dialog: up, always having to be saved by
dialog: someone else. I can see where
dialog: being the damsel in distress is
text: humiliating.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: But I’m not like that anymore!

text: They slide down it, spinning, and are flung splashing

text: The Soul Snatcher, an upright metal device with an

speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Yes, we did!

text: Fred away.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: Fred, cut your crap!
speaker_heading: FRED

speaker_heading: SCOOBY -DOO

speaker_heading: SHAGGY (0.S.)
dialog: Scooby!

speaker_heading: SCOOBY

speaker_heading: SHAGGY

speaker_heading: SCOOBY

speaker_heading: SCOOBY
dialog: Raggy roves Rooby again?!
speaker_heading: SHAGGY
dialog: I always did.
speaker_heading: SCOOBY
dialog: And Rooby roves Raggy!

speaker_heading: SHAGGY
dialog: Ha hal Cut it out, Scoob!
speaker_heading: N‘GOO
text: appears over Shaggy. A nearly-sobbing Mondavarious is by

text: when Shaggy was stuck in the vase, he starts to run away.
text: N‘Goo grabs Shaggy’s neck. He lifts him off the floor.
speaker_heading: MONDAVARIOUS
dialog: You! You have eradicated a

text: Mondavarious and N’Goo hear a LOUD GROWLING. They turn.

dialog: frightening.
speaker_heading: SCOOBY
dialog: Reave Raggy rarone.
text: He barrels toward them. Mondavarious and N’Goo’s

scene_heading: INT. COAST GUARD STATION - DAY (NEWS FOOTAGE)
text: Press bulbs flash on Mondavarious and N’Goo. They are

speaker_heading: CORESPONDENT
dialog: Fred, can you tell us how you
dialog: masterminded the apprehension of
dialog: Raphael Mondavarious?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Yes! It all started when I was
text: giving a speech at Coolsville,
dialog: and --
text: Fred notices Velma standing quietly beside them, gazing
text: at the floor.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: And I think, really, that the
dialog: Velmster should take it from
dialog: there.
text: The Correspondents all thrust their mikes toward a
text: surprised Velma. Her eyes smile warmly at Fred.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: VELMA
dialog: Yes. Firstly, we don’t believe
dialog: there is any such person as

dialog: the conclusion that he’s
dialog: actually --
text: With the dexterity of Vanna White turning letters, Daphne
text: pulls off the Mondavarious mask to reveal...
speaker_heading: VELMA
text: Garret Rogers, Shaggy’s uncle. It
dialog: makes sense: He wanted Scooby-Doo
dialog: to be part of his evil plan, so he
dialog: prodded us into coming to Spooky
dialog: Island... At least that’s what we
dialog: thought until we called Garret in
text: Coolsville and he was still home.
dialog: Consequently, this is just another
dialog: mask covering his real identity --
text: Daphne pulls a Garret mask off to reveal...
speaker_heading: VELMA
dialog: Fred Jones, who set up the whole
dialog: situation just so Mystery Ink
dialog: would return to the spotlight!
text: PAN TO Fred, who is hurt by the accusation.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: But I’m standing right here.
speaker_heading: VELMA
dialog: Right. It was ludicrous that we
dialog: suspected Fred, since we’ve often
text: seen he and Mondavarious together.
dialog: So it could only be the one person
dialog: so unmercifully nefarious as to
dialog: concoct this evil scheme.
text: Daphne yanks off the Fred mask to reveal...

dialog: (re: Fred)
dialog: And him! I figured out the
dialog: mystery of Moody Manner and he
dialog: took all the credit!
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Sorry, Don. But that’s no reason

speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: I know we’ve seen it before, but

speaker_heading: FRED

speaker_heading: VELMA

text: They look at him.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Not to toot my own horn, but I’ve

speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: A mysterious call?
speaker_heading: SHAGGY
dialog: I don’t know. They said they were
dialog: from the Jell-O pudding factory
dialog: and there were some sort of
dialog: sightings of, like, a Jell-o

dialog: they hung up.
speaker_heading: SCOOBY

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: VELMA

speaker_heading: FRED (0.S.)
dialog: Don’t jump to conclusions, Shag!
text: Fred steps out of the Mystery Machine behind Shaggy.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: If you expect it to be a man ina

dialog: it’ll take you unaware, perhaps
text: shooting acidic wads of pudding at
dialog: your head, tearing off your face!
speaker_heading: SHAGGY
dialog: That’s exactly what Scooby said!

speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: Right. I can always be in Mean
