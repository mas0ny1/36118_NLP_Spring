scene_heading: INT. HATCHBACK - DUSK
text: In the backseat lies TWO FULL TRASHBAGS open enough to see
text: the contents: PAPER RINGS LINKED IN A LONG CHAIN. On each
text: sheet of folded paper we can make out HANDWRITING.
text: The wind jostles them as the car speeds down the road.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY/ RECYCLING BIN - NEXT - DUSK
text: EVAN (30) carries the bags from his car to the bin.
text: One goes in easy. The other TEARS so he has to scoop up the
text: tangled paper chain by hand. It clumps like intestines.
text: LUCAS and PETER, both 12, bike down the alley. Lucas heads
text: toward Evan who’s getting back in the car. Peter hesitates:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What are you doing? Lucas.
text: Peter listens from a distance. Lucas is at the car window:
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: When can we come over? You know.
dialog: Come ove-
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: Yeah, I get it. Couple weeks. We’1l
dialog: see.
text: Peter doesn’t get it. The hatchback takes off.
scene_heading: INT. PLANT NURSERY - DAY
text: Evan scans through the aisles, hunting for a certain flower.
text: He rubs his fingers on the GREEN LEAF of one. Not it.
text: Another shows more promise, an ORCHID. He scrapes a leaf
text: wollen KNIFE, producing a TURQUOISE POWDER, fine like
text: He grabs a handful of the plant’s soil and sifts through it.
text: Then another handful until he finds a TINY WHITE INCHWORM.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: He buys four of the potted orchids at the checkout.
dialog: Revision 1 2.
scene_heading: EXT. EVAN’S HOUSE/ BACK YARD - DUSK
text: He pulls the last of the plants from its pot, shakes the
text: dirt off the roots, and throws it in a fire.
text: He dumps the pot soil onto a SIFTER and starts shaking it,
text: leaving behind rocks, twigs, and SEVERAL WHITE INCHWORMS.
scene_heading: INT. EVAN’S HOUSE/ BACK ROOM - NEXT - DUSK
text: TwO EMPTY GLASS JARS sit on the desk. One has a HAPPY FACE
text: sticker, the other a FROWN with X’s for eyes.
text: Evan scans over the sifter, picking up worm after worm.
text: One SQUIRMS in his palm. He throws it in the happy jar.
text: Another lies STILL. Dead. It goes in the frown jar.
text: Behind him, an OLD MAN, GILL plays ONLINE POKER.
scene_heading: EXT. EVAN’S HOUSE/ BACK PORCH - NIGHT
text: Peter cautiously bikes in to see Lucas amusing a group of
text: TEENAGERS. He’s positioning an older boy, MONTY, in the
text: middle of the porch then gets him to down a shot of BLACK
speaker_heading: LIQUID.
text: Lucas pours himself a shot from his TRAVEL MUG, downs it,
text: shakes out his arms, and puts his hands over Monty’s eyes:
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Close ’em. Close ya eyes. Just
dialog: trust.
text: Monty does. Lucas stands at his side and prepares.
text: Lucas slowly raises his right hand, swirls his index finger.
text: Monty’s right hand MIMICS the motion in perfect unison.
text: Lucas gets more creative, making hand gestures, using both
text: arms. Monty, eyes closed, instantly matches move for move.
text: He’s a PUPPET. Lucas gestures to the others:
speaker_heading: LUCAS (cont’d)
dialog: Go ahead. Throw it up. Throw it.
text: Someone throws a BALL at Monty who smacks it down,
text: controlled by Lucas. Then a STICK, EMPTY CAN, etc.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: CONTINUED: Revision 1 3.
text: Lucas stands facing Monty so that their every move is a
text: mirror opposite (not mirrored, get it?). They poke each
text: other’s shoulders, play-smack each other’s face, like an
text: extremely complex game of patty cake.
text: Lucas stops when he sees Peter.
speaker_heading: LUCAS (cont’d)
dialog: Wait, wait. Peter. Peter! Come
dialog: here! Peter’s left-handed. He’s a
dialog: lefty.
scene_heading: INT. EVAN’S HOUSE/ BACK ROOM - NEXT - NIGHT
text: Evan sits back, allowing Lucas to run the process at the
text: desk and show off for Peter. He grabs a live inchworm from
text: the DOZEN in the happy jar and references the 100 dead ones
dialog: in the frown jar:
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: See how many you gotta go through
dialog: to get a good one?
text: He puts it on a COCKTAIL STRAINER and pours PEPSI over the
text: worm, letting it collect in a shot glass for Peter. Lucas
text: moves the worm and strainer to his own mug while...
speaker_heading: LUCAS (cont’d)
dialog: Pete’s a bit of a germaphobe so let
dialog: me get mine going and I’1l show
dialog: there’s nothing-
text: Peter’s not going to be pushed so he just downs it fast.
text: Lucas looks up, surprised. He doesn’t see the worm fall
text: THROUGH the strainer into his mug. Behind them, Gill does:
speaker_heading: GILL
dialog: Hey, boy! Watch that.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Yeah, I got it. I know. See, I
dialog: know. Nobody wants that. Come here
dialog: little guy.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: No, no. Just throw-
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: No, I know. Throw this batch out.
dialog: That’s that. I know. See. Start
dialog: over.
dialog: Revision 1 4.
text: He pours out the mug, wipes it with a napkin.
scene_heading: EXT. EVAN’S HOUSE/ BACK PORCH - NEXT - NIGHT
text: Lucas faces Peter. The others watch. Peter’s nervous.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Ready?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No.
text: He looks around, embarrassed to be the center of attention.
text: Lucas throws up a jab. Peter instantly mirrors him with a
text: jab of his own. Their fists meet. He’s shocked. It’s
dialog: involuntary.
text: Lucas throws random jabs, slaps, and hooks, all met by
text: Peter, moving in perfect unison. Now he’s enjoying it,
text: laughing. It doesn’t stop even as they talk and the others
speaker_heading: CHEER.
speaker_heading: PETER (cont’d)
dialog: How are you doing it?
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: I’m not. You are.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I’m not. You are.
speaker_heading: LUCAS AND PETER
dialog: I’m not you are. You’re doing it.
dialog: You are.
scene_heading: EXT. NEAR TRAIN BRIDGE - DAWN
text: Lucas applauds NOELA (11) as she does cartwheels in the
dialog: grass.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: They hold each other, leaning against a boulder. She shares
text: his mug. He whispers something in her ear and...
text: Without hesitation she walks out on a NARROW WALL of
text: concrete jutting from the hillside. The fall would be 30
text: feet. She doesn’t seem to care. Nearby, Peter watches,
text: getting worried.
text: He panics, moving to help as she prepares for a cartwheel...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: 9A
scene_heading: CONTINUED: Revision 1 5.
text: But when she places the first hand down she suddenly wakes
text: up to the danger, wobbles, steadies herself. She steps
dialog: back...
text: ...and comes right after Lucas, violently SLAPPING at him.
speaker_heading: NOELA
dialog: The hell’s...wrong...with you!
scene_heading: EXT. CITY MARATHON - DAY
text: 1000 RACERS move through the suburbs. One racer, JEFF,
text: passes by a man with a DOG on the roadside, BRENT.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Watch your dog.
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Get your dog out of the road.
text: Jeff stops, comes back, dithers, before finally approaching:
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont’d)
dialog: Where you from? You from here?
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: That’s my house.
text: Jeff takes off, blowing off the odd feeling he seems to
text: have. Brent calls after him:
speaker_heading: BRENT (cont’d)
dialog: Where are you from?
text: Jeff waves it off, runs away:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Nothing. Nowhere.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: KRIS (30, LONG DARK HAIR) runs in a stream of racers.
text: She slows to a stop, answers her ear bud phone, turns the

speaker_heading: KRIS (ON PHONE)
dialog: You can see his foot. A grip,
dialog: gaffer, I don’t know, somebody’s
dialog: foot, a shadow. Right but if I can
dialog: see it they’re going to see it too.
dialog: Ok I’m going to ask five people
dialog: around me if they notice and if
dialog: one-
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: ROTH (40) leans against her cubicle wall.
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: Cut them loose. Hire another team.
dialog: You can’t keep having the same

dialog: think?
text: She ponders.
speaker_heading: KRIS
dialog: I think they were the best of the
dialog: lot and the rest aren’t great...and
dialog: I can’t keep having the same
text: conversation with them.
scene_heading: INT. DOWNTOWN/ RESTAURANT - NEXT - DAY
text: She finishes a salad at the bar, scanning 12 INDEX CARDS
text: fanned out in front of her. Each card lists a different

scene_heading: INT. EVAN’S HOUSE/ BACK ROOM - DUSK
text: Evan sets aside TWO CAPSULES from a TYLENOL bottle...
text: .carefully opens one, empties the medicine...
text: .places an inchworm inside, recloses the halves...
text: -marks a TINY DOT on the capsule with a pen.
text: He holds the tampered and untampered capsules up to the
text: light, comparing them before they both go in a SMALL BAGGY.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (OFF SCREEN)
dialog: What is it?
scene_heading: INT. DOWNTOWN/ NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT
text: Sitting in a back booth, he’s showing her the baggy under
text: the table discreetly. He’s coy, flirting. She is too.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: You have more?
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: One for me. One for you.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: My friends though.
text: This disappoints him, but he doesn’t let her see.
dialog: Recovering:
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: When are they coming?

scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN/ SIDEWALK - NEXT - NIGHT
text: He walks through the crowd, scanning faces, hunting.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN/ MINI-MART - NEXT - NIGHT
text: Leaning against the wall, he hangs the baggy just outside
text: his jean pocket, trying to get the attention of a man ina
speaker_heading: SUIT.
text: Suit ignores him. Evan shakes it off, dismayed. He leaves.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN/ STREET - NEXT - NIGHT
text: He grabs a BROWN GROCERY SACK from his car, tests out a
text: TASER, and walks off.
scene_heading: INT. DOWNTOWN/ RESTAURANT - NEXT - NIGHT
text: We follow Kris to a back hallway where the restrooms are.
text: She tries the women’s, but it’s locked. She waits, checks
text: her phone, flicks through messages. Beyond her...
text: ...Evan waits outside the men’s.
text: He approaches with his phone out to show her:
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: Are you getting a signal in here?
dialog: Got a new phone and I can’t tell if
dialog: it’s me or-
text: She looks over, but it doesn’t matter because now he’s close
text: enough to jam a TASER under her ribs. She seizes up and
text: collapses against the wall.
text: In one practiced move he puts the taser away and cradles her
text: in one arm. She looks like any other drunk girl.
dialog: 19
dialog: Revision 1 9.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN/ ALLEYWAY BEHIND RESTAURANT - NEXT - NIGHT
text: The exit door BANGS OPEN.
text: He lays her on the pavement. She’s gasping for breath, not
text: able to make a sound.
text: He retrieves the GROCERY SACK from behind a dumpster and
text: sits on her chest as he unpacks a RESUSCITATOR.
text: He places it over her mouth and twists the valve. WATER
text: starts to drip. He squeezes the resuscitator bag that we now
text: see is full of liquid. It flows into her, forcing her to
text: swallow. For an instant we see an INCHWORM in the tube
text: before it disappears into her mouth.
text: She swallows one last time. He takes the device away,
text: allowing her to breathe. He stands up like he’s just roped a
dialog: calf.
text: She gasps, crawling to her knees. She stumbles to her feet,
text: trying to escape down the alley.
text: He grabs her PURSE from the ground and slowly follows,
text: keeping his distance, observing. A subtle transformation
dialog: takes place:
text: Her panic ebbs until she is walking casually, unsure of her
text: own motivation. She suddenly veers off, but Evan corrects
dialog: her:
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: No no. Come on. This way.
text: She obeys. By the time they reach the heavy foot traffic on
text: the main street, she is more like a companion than victim.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: Turn left here.
text: She does. They enter the thick congestion of people.
speaker_heading: EVAN (cont’d)

text: pull into the long driveway.
scene_heading: INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ OFFICE - NEXT - NIGHT
text: At the desk Evan thumbs through bills, financial statements,
text: etc. He sets aside blank "BALANCE TRANSFER CHECKS".
text: He opens her checkbook to see the balance: "$5189.23".
text: He checks his watch, thinks. He pulls a PAPERBACK copy of
text: "WALDEN" from his back pocket, rests it on the desk.
text: He taps the cover while scanning the room.
scene_heading: INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ HALLWAY CLOSET - NEXT - NIGHT
text: He pulls out various BOARD GAMES, looking for something.
text: He finds a case of POKER CHIPS, tucks it under his arm.
scene_heading: INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ FOYER - NEXT - NIGHT
text: KRIS’ BARE FEET are within ONE WHITE TILE of the tiled
dialog: floor.
text: She stands, relaxed, almost nodding off against the wall.
dialog: Evan SNAPS his fingers:
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: No no. Stay awake. You feel
text: refreshed.
speaker_heading: KRIS
dialog: Is there food?
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: All the food is poisoned. You’re
dialog: throat is parched. Go to the
dialog: kitchen. Make a pitcher of ice
dialog: water. Bring a small glass.
text: She looks to the kitchen and then to her feet, confused.
speaker_heading: EVAN

speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: I have to apologize. I was born
text: with a disfigurement where my head
dialog: is made of the same material as the
dialog: sun. It makes it impossible for you
text: to look directly at me. It has
dialog: always been this way.
text: Kris is hit with a FLOOD OF LIGHT. She squints, turns away.
text: Evan’s head is a BRIGHT LIGHT, illuminating the room.
text: He pours a tiny amount of water into the glass.
speaker_heading: EVAN (cont’d)
dialog: The water before you is somehow
dialog: special. When you drink it you feel
text: revived and full of energy. It is
dialog: better than anything you have ever
dialog: tasted. Take a drink now.
text: She does, surprised at how good it is. He pours again.
speaker_heading: EVAN
text: There are two approaching armies:
dialog: hunger and fatigue. But a great
text: wall keeps them at bay. The wall
dialog: extends to the sky and will stay up
dialog: until I say otherwise. Each drink
text: is better than the last, leaving
dialog: you with a desire to have one more.
dialog: Take a drink now.
text: She does, immediately eyeing the pitcher, wanting more.
speaker_heading: EVAN (cont’d)
dialog: The next drink must be earned and
dialog: I’m going to tell you how. Focus
dialog: closely on my instructions. I will

scene_heading: INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: She is organizing the poker chips in stacks of 10:
speaker_heading: KRIS
dialog: Ten chip. Ten chip. Eight, nine,
dialog: ten chip. Three, four, and six, ten
dialog: chip...
text: She does a quick count of the stacks with her finger.
text: Satisfied, she grabs a nearby SHEET OF PAPER full of her
text: HANDWRITING. She folds it over and adds it as another "link"
text: in the CHAIN OF PAPER RINGS she has been constructing all
text: night. She uses a glue stick and then counts while she holds
dialog: it tight:
speaker_heading: KRIS (cont’d)
dialog: One one thousand, two one thousand,
dialog: three one thousand, four and five
dialog: and stick...
text: She lets go of the paper, watching to make sure it sticks.
text: It does so she gets her treat, filling the glass precisely
text: to a MARKER LINE drawn by hand. It’s barely a sip.
text: She downs the drink and takes a moment to enjoy it before
text: realizing she wants another. She gets back to work.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Evan enters with his coffee and a disconnected TELEPHONE.
text: Kris finishes transcribing a page from "WALDEN" to a sheet

speaker_heading: EVAN
text: The water has lost its appeal. It
text: doesn’t seem as enticing as before.
dialog: You have no craving for it.
text: She continues her work, but slowly the passion for it goes
text: missing as if she is questioning it for the first time.
dialog: He places
text: the telephone RECEIVER to his ear as a prop:
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: Kris, I’ve just got a call. It’s
dialog: your mother. She says she’s been
text: taken by several men.
speaker_heading: KRIS
dialog: Oh no.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: She says they won’t let her go
dialog: unless you pay them.
speaker_heading: KRIS
dialog: No. Oh no. Do you have money?
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: No, I don’t. I’m sorry. Can you

speaker_heading: KRIS

speaker_heading: EVAN

speaker_heading: KRIS
dialog: I just. Don’t. Feel. Like I should.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: Do you want me to look away? Would
dialog: that make you feel better?
text: She hesitates. He’s still directly behind her but...
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: I’ve stepped outside. You are
dialog: comfortable and secure. You have
text: taken control. Confident and
dialog: empowered.
text: She opens the panel revealing a HANDGUN, PAPERS, and 3
scene_heading: VELVET CASES.
text: Evan sees the gun and eyes Kris, but she’s oblivious to it,
text: only removing the cases before returning the panel.
scene_heading: INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ BATHROOM - NEXT - DAY
text: She’s on the toilet after a night of drinking water.

text: TRASH BAGS she stands, heading to the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ KITCHEN - NEXT - DAY
text: She sits on the floor eating from the refrigerator with the

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: She’s gone. The refrigerator contents have been ransacked

scene_heading: INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ BEDROOM - NEXT - DAY

scene_heading: INT. BLOODSTREAM

scene_heading: INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Still asleep, Kris’ arm UNFURLS and twists seemingly under
text: its own control until it extends out to the edge of the bed.
text: One at a time her legs reach out to full extension.
text: On her left calf something that looks like a LARGE VEIN
text: rises against the inside of the skin and ELONGATES toward
dialog: her foot.
text: The same happens on her left forearm.

text: Sitting on the floor against the counter Kris frantically
text: tries to push the worm along her ankle with her hand. With
text: the other hand she reaches up to a drawer and withdraws a
speaker_heading: KNIFE.
text: She summons bravery and then CUTS into her leg. She’s able
text: to pull out the end of the worm, but the more she pulls the
text: more agonizing the pain.
text: With 6 inches of worm in her grip she slices off its end.
text: Immediately, we hear a HIGH-PITCHED TONE. She passes out.
speaker_heading: DAY
text: She’s still lying in the same spot. Unconscious.
speaker_heading: NIGHT

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

text: Alone, WESLEY (50) unloads 10 LARGE SPEAKERS from his truck.

speaker_heading: NIGHT
text: EARTHWORMS writhe in the mud.
text: Far away Wesley sits in his chair taking notes under a book

text: an empty rehearsal hall. After a few bars...
text: He skips to another clip, an OBOIST:
speaker_heading: OBOIST (IN VIDEO)
dialog: My name is Kevin Anderson. I’1l be
dialog: playing Ilaiyaraja’s score from
dialog: Dalapathi in G.
text: 3 seconds in, Wesley skips to a FRENCH HORN, TRUMPET, etc.
text: HEADLIGHTS approach on the road. He leans to his telescope:
text: The car stops. Kris steps out in a nightgown, moving into
text: the field toward the speakers.
text: Wesley packs up.
text: Kris walks almost trancelike, stopping once before
text: continuing. Nearby, more worms writhe on the ground. Dark
dialog: everywhere.
text: She gets to the speakers. The bass switches off suddenly.
text: The SILENCE wakes her.
text: Wesley hits the truck headlights and moves to her.
text: She raises her arms, showing him CUTS on all her
dialog: extremities.
speaker_heading: KRIS
dialog: It won’t come out.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: No. Not like that.
scene_heading: INT. LIVESTOCK BUILDING/ EXAM ROOM - NEXT - NIGHT

text: She sits on a COT downing a tall glass of a MILKY MIXTURE.
text: She eyes Wesley who is marking up the clipboard.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: What did you weigh...before the
dialog: growth?
speaker_heading: KRIS
dialog: One fifteen. Maybe. Why?
text: All business, he puts another full glass of the mixture in
text: front of her. She grabs it and prepares to drink.
speaker_heading: KRIS
dialog: Will you say why?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: It’s fine. This guy’s 11 pounds.
speaker_heading: KRIS
dialog: Is that good?
text: Wesley silently continues writing.
speaker_heading: KRIS,
dialog: How long does it take?
text: He pours another glass to a precise level for her.
speaker_heading: KRIS (cont’d)
dialog: This’11 kill it?
text: He makes the mistake of looking at her and melts a bit:
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: I can answer all your questions

dialog: your body a place he doesn’t want
dialog: to be. Eleven pounds makes him
dialog: thirty feet long so it’1ll take
dialog: around three and a half days.
text: He closes his clipboard, set to leave. She’s scared.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: It doesn’t come from anywhere. You

dialog: think you’re awake. You’re not
dialog: awake.
scene_heading: INT. LIVESTOCK BUILDING/ EXAM ROOM - NIGHT
text: Wesley puts in EARPLUGS to muffle Kris’ SCREAMS of agony
text: coming from down the hall. He ties TWO RAW BEEF STEAKS
text: together with GAUZE.
scene_heading: INT. LIVESTOCK BUILDING/ WHITE ROOM - NEXT - NIGHT
text: Wesley searches Kris’ extremities: left arm, left leg, right
text: arm, right leg. That’s where he finds the NUB of the worm’s
text: head peeking out. He wraps the layers of beef over it.
text: He pulls the cot to the other side of the room for better
text: access, nearly deaf to her screams.
scene_heading: INT. LIVESTOCK BUILDING/ EXAM ROOM - MORNING
text: Wesley has prepped an area on the belly of an unconscious
text: PIG for surgery. He washes it with iodine.
text: He begins to cut out a SQUARE SEGMENT with a scalpel.
scene_heading: INT. LIVESTOCK BUILDING/ WHITE ROOM - NEXT - MORNING
text: He checks between the steaks to see the worm has traveled
dialog: through the first and entered the second.
text: He inserts a WOODEN DOWEL under the worm and manages to loop

text: from Kris. She screams.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 55
dialog: 56
scene_heading: CONTINUED: Revision 1 23.
text: He wheels the pig into the room on a gurney, positioned next

text: He affixes the second steak, worm still embedded, to the
text: square wound on the pig.
speaker_heading: NIGHT
text: Kris moans, passed out from exhaustion. Wesley pours more
text: mixture, wakes her.
text: She pushes it away, screaming:
speaker_heading: KRIS
dialog: NO! NO!
text: She looks toward the pig and goes quiet. After some thought
text: she downs the poison. She has seen:
text: The setup is orderly and running well. The worm goes from
text: her leg, around the dowel (now supported on a stand) a few
text: times, and then disappears into the pig.
speaker_heading: DAY
text: Wesley turns the dowel for the last time, removing the last
dialog: part of worm from Kris.
text: He wheels the pig out of the room. 12 inches of worm still
text: protrudes from its wound.
scene_heading: INT. LIVESTOCK BUILDING/ EXAM ROOM - DAY
text: Reading from his notes he adds a line to a page of names and
scene_heading: serial numbers: "KRIS FISCHER 20110802-Kris"
text: On a SMALL TAG he copies the serial number: "20110802-Kris"
text: He PIERCES the pig’s ear with the tag. By now the worm has
text: crawled further in with only a few inches now left outside.
scene_heading: EXT. PIGPEN - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. RURAL ROAD NEAR REFINERY - DAY
text: Kris wakes in her car. She has been placed behind the wheel.
text: The car is parked just off the road. 4 STRIPED TOWERS of an
text: oil refinery lie in the distance.
text: For a moment she is frozen in terror, eyes wide. She
text: suddenly takes a huge breath, waking to her surroundings.
text: She nervously checks the backseat, the glove box, the
text: floorboard, looking for any clue to how she got here.
text: A moment of thought leads her to a greater fear: she lifts
text: her nightgown and puts a hand in her underwear. She inspects
text: her fingers but nothing is confirmed either way.
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE STATION - NEXT - DAY
text: She drives into the parking lot...
text: ...turns off the ignition, about to open the car door but...

speaker_heading: NEIGHBOR

speaker_heading: WIFE (OFF SCREEN)

text: Closer still and he can see Husband’s thoughts:
scene_heading: INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - INTERCUT - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. PIGPEN - INTERCUT - DAY

scene_heading: INT. COMMUTER TRAIN - NIGHT

speaker_heading: KRIS

dialog: Not yours.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Not ours. From her perspective
dialog: everything flipped just like that.
dialog: The guy she thought she married
dialog: turned out to be somebody else, a
dialog: junkie basically. The savings she
dialog: thought we were building, the
text: plans, reset to zero. Lights turn
dialog: on. I’m on a bender holed up ina

speaker_heading: BEAT
speaker_heading: KRIS

scene_heading: EXT. PIGPEN - MORNING
text: ...GROUND. They stay asleep, surrounded by pigs.
text: PAN OVER to see Wesley pushing a WHEELBARROW to the pen.

speaker_heading: KRIS

scene_heading: INT. CHAIN HOTEL/ RESTAURANT KITCHEN - NEXT - NIGHT
text: He leads her by the hand to the back entrance to the
dialog: kitchen.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The place is empty. They eat burgers they made themselves.
speaker_heading: KRIS
dialog: They always remind me of family
dialog: vacations. I think it’s the smell,
dialog: the chlorine or bleach on the
text: sheets. Glasses in plastic.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: There was this place in Vermont we
dialog: would go when we were kids. It was
dialog: some sort of colonial historical
dialog: site- museums and you know...but
dialog: what stands out is the hotel we
dialog: would stay at had an indoor pool
dialog: and this was just the biggest deal
dialog: in the world for us, for my

scene_heading: EXT. PIGPEN - NEXT - DAY
text: He approaches with a BAG OF PEANUTS, eating a few. He stops
text: at the fence, watching...
text: In a corner of the pen TWO PIGS, K and J have isolated
text: themselves from the others. K lies down and J looks like
text: he’s standing guard.
text: Wesley moves to them while staying outside the fence. He
text: throws a couple peanuts on the ground. J gobbles them up.
text: Wesley throws some more, this time closer to the rest of the
text: pigs. J moves in that direction but won’t go past a certain
text: point. Other pigs finally come for the peanuts. J gives them
text: a LOW GRUNT, warding them off. Wesley’s not happy with this.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: No! No!

speaker_heading: WESLEY (cont’d)

text: He sees she was hoping for a different answer...
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont’d)
dialog: I thought we could go though. If
dialog: you want.

speaker_heading: JEFF (cont’d)
dialog: Do you want to?

dialog: idea.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I have been very careful not
dialog: to...lie. But through omission you
dialog: may have gotten the wrong- I gave
dialog: you a different impression than
dialog: is...real. And if we walk into that
dialog: hotel you’re gonna know.
text: Kris looks to the door like she might bolt. She doesn’t.
speaker_heading: KRIS
dialog: Okay...
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I’m not an advisor. I don’t broker.
dialog: I do...interdepartmental reports.
speaker_heading: KRIS
dialog: That still sounds impressive-
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: It’s not. I work with interns.
text: Alongside interns. Craig pays me in

text: Kris almost smiles, relieved, but still wonders...
speaker_heading: KRIS
dialog: I don’t...what does that last part

speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Oh, yes. These are lovely.
speaker_heading: PHOEBE
dialog: Should I take some?
text: Elise is looking elsewhere, not able to hide her

speaker_heading: PHOEBE

text: Phoebe finds her ignorance sweet but doesn’t let on:
speaker_heading: PHOEBE

speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Did you write today?
speaker_heading: PHOEBE
dialog: I opened it. But...nothing really

scene_heading: INT. CABIN - DAY
text: Phoebe is working on an ELABORATE FLORAL ARRANGEMENT.
text: RIBBONS, SOIL, many different kinds of PLANTS and FLOWERS

scene_heading: INT. GREENHOUSE - NEXT - DAY

speaker_heading: PHOEBE

dialog: Why not...if the other girls like
dialog: him?
speaker_heading: PHOEBE
dialog: So I should go along with whatever
dialog: random girls say?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: No, I’m asking why. The boy doesn’t

scene_heading: INT. KRIS & JEFF’S HOUSE - DAY
text: The refrigerator is DRIPPING WATER onto the tiled floor.
text: Kris crouches down, inspecting. The water pools, slowly
text: spreading throughout the channels of grout in the tile.
text: She moves to the outer edge of the spread where a single
text: STREAM is creeping towards a 4-way split. She’s captivated
text: by it, which says more about her mood than anything. She
text: sets down a HALF-FINISHED GLASS OF WINE on the floor
dialog: waiting.
text: The water finally meets the junction and does what we

scene_heading: INT. CERULEAN PLAZA HOTEL/ GUEST ROOM - NIGHT
text: Phoebe refills TwO GLASSES from a WINE BOX. She turns to

speaker_heading: PHOEBE
dialog: Love it. Very you. Perfect. I have
dialog: a pair of hose for you instead of
dialog: those socks.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: No. I like socks.
speaker_heading: BALCONY
text: They enjoy the air, the wine, city sounds. Phoebe has the
text: new journal open on her lap, pen in hand.
speaker_heading: PHOEBE
dialog: Gram, I don’t think you could
dialog: explain any of these things either.
dialog: Like, you quit smoking and my mom
dialog: can’t. Why? I mean why, uh, why’d
dialog: you pick that car when all you do
dialog: is complain about the color? Why’d
dialog: you marry grandpa? Why anything.
text: That last one resonates with Elise.
speaker_heading: PHOEBE
dialog: It’s impossible to know for most
dialog: things.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: No, not impossible. But it will be,
dialog: looking back. That’s why you keep a
dialog: record.
scene_heading: INT. KRIS & JEFF’S HOUSE - DAY
text: Kris is tipsy now. She’s balancing herself like a tightrope
text: walker, arms out at her side, wine glass in one hand.
speaker_heading: ELISE (OFF SCREEN)
dialog: If not you’1l say oh I must have
dialog: been thinking this or that or maybe
dialog: I’m just that kind of person. It’1l

text: On the next step her foot hovers over the tile, not ready to
text: land. Slowly it MOVES OVER to an adjacent tile on the right.
text: Again it hovers there like she’s not sure if it will support
text: her. She TOUCHES DOWN and slowly rests more weight on it,
text: then moves the other foot over. A tiny change has occurred.

scene_heading: INT. KRIS & JEFF’S HOUSE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Goodness.
speaker_heading: KRIS
dialog: You like it? The color?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Yeah, it’s...beautiful. Goodness.
dialog: What are you wearing?
speaker_heading: KRIS
dialog: This is how I dress.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: No, it isn’t.

speaker_heading: KRIS
dialog: I’m not sick. My mind is healthy.
dialog: There is no imbalance chemically.

speaker_heading: JEFF (cont’d)
dialog: You stopped taking your meds?
text: She doesn’t say no. She’s staying calm, knowing he won’t.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont’d)
dialog: How long?
speaker_heading: KRIS
dialog: Eight months. Eight months and I’ve
dialog: been fine. No highs and lows.
dialog: Just...normal.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Yeah. Was it normal when you locked
dialog: us in the bathroom with a handgun?
speaker_heading: KRIS
dialog: We did that. We locked ourselves
dialog: in. We-
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Now I’m realizing. Now it makes
dialog: some kind of sense. You show up at
dialog: my work. You’re manic. I feed off
dialog: it. It’s delusional. No wonder -
speaker_heading: KRIS
dialog: It was us.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: It was you!
speaker_heading: KRIS.
dialog: You’re rewriting it.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Oh. Oh.

speaker_heading: JEFF (cont’d)
dialog: You. Will. Take- I am not doing

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: What is this beautiful orchid? The

dialog: Tremendous.
speaker_heading: PHOEBE
dialog: I don’t think it has a name. We

dialog: family has.
text: Elise watches from a distance. She shares a smile with
dialog: Phoebe.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: It’s so easy, just a little

speaker_heading: KRIS,
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: Boss
dialog: Of course. Who are you interviewing

speaker_heading: FRONT AREA

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: She searches the phrase "friend of human progress" on her

speaker_heading: WESLEY

scene_heading: 199 INT. MUSIC HALL - NEXT - DAY
text: They enter on an upper level, looking out over the hall.

speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: They’ve refinished the second tier
text: there...at the exit.
speaker_heading: VOLUNTEER
dialog: Yes sir. That was done end of last
dialog: year.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: They use the same materials? Same

speaker_heading: VOLUNTEER
dialog: Uh, great question. I’1l1 look into
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Wesley sets up a GREY BOX on stage and steps away.
text: He hits a button on a REMOTE. A LOUD TONE emits from the
text: grey box, echoing against the back of the hall, dying down
text: after a few seconds. He turns his head and tests again.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Again he tests the acoustics, this time from a floor seat.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: WESLEY

speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: ...but it leaves no room for
dialog: expression-
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: That’s exactly right. Your
dialog: complaint is exactly the right
dialog: thing to be complaining about.
dialog: Perfect. Strings have to be that.
dialog: Every. Loop. Perfect. No not
dialog: perfect, identical. However you
dialog: start has to be repeated forever
dialog: good or bad. Because over here with
dialog: choral and timber we’re organic and
dialog: we need a gauge, something to
dialog: contrast or it’s all just a moving
dialog: mess.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Then use a metronome. Get a
dialog: synthesizer.
text: The other players are quiet. Leah might have crossed a line.
text: The room is tense. Wesley stays calm, even amused.
scene_heading: 201 EXT. MUSIC HALL STEPS - NIGHT
text: The two sit alone, intimate. She takes a sip of his COFFEE:
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: We could do it artificially, throw
dialog: it to percussion et cetera. That
dialog: would be easy. The challenge is to
dialog: reproduce it in the analog. Remove
dialog: passion from where it shows up
dialog: naturally.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 202
dialog: 203
scene_heading: CONTINUED: Revision 1 85.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: You can’t say it’s worth doing just
dialog: because it’s difficult. That’s
dialog: confusing two separate ideas. Were
dialog: you born into money? Rich people
dialog: always use the word challenge when
dialog: they want everyone else to do
dialog: something hard.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: No, we weren’t rich.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Poor?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Uh...it rose and fell with the

scene_heading: INT. MUSIC HALL - DAY
text: Wesley conducts a FULL ORCHESTRA rehearsal on stage.
text: Among the violinists Leah plays with intense concentration.

speaker_heading: WESLEY

scene_heading: INT. KRIS & JEFF’S HOUSE/ BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Now on their bed, he struggles for words. Kris listens.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: ...and I filled it with something I

dialog: difference. But if none of it’s
dialog: true, if it’s all a fiction I

scene_heading: INT. KRIS & JEFF’S HOUSE/ BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Kris wakes, sits up in bed, about to stand, takes a moment.

text: we see the title "REPETICO", "Composer Wesley Van Kraus",
dialog: and on a dedication page "For Becky, my life."
text: Jeff, staring ahead, suddenly turns to the audience behind
text: them. Kris senses it too: something is out there.
text: APPLAUSE wakes them and they turn to the stage where Wesley
text: steps out, bowing slightly. He scans the audience, the
text: balcony, his eyes lingering too long. He senses something
dialog: too.
text: Wesley raises the BATON. A moment of silence.
text: He thrusts it. The music begins softly but we only see...
scene_heading: MICROSCOPIC CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL REACTIONS. The TURQUOISE
text: POWDER effervesces against the surface of an ORGANELLE
text: before disappearing inside. BLOOD FLOWS, carrying the
dialog: powder.
text: After fading to an echo, the music returns with a CRESCENDO:
text: Kris feels the effects, looking like an invisible hand is
text: slowly pushing her over. She almost loses consciousness.
text: Jeff is breathing hard, trying to withstand the spell they
text: seem to be under. He braces against the armrests.
text: Kris tries to stand. Jeff helps her. They move to the aisle.
text: As they walk to the back exit, they notice a MAN in the

text: Kris, Jeff, and 9 OTHER ABDUCTEES are assembled in a group.
text: They look to each other, searching faces while the music

text: Kris notices that one of the men, GRAHAM, lingers near the
text: door. He presses his head to it, listening. A young woman,
text: DOROTHY, follows too, leaning against the other door. One by
text: one they move into the doorway huddled together in a trance.
text: Kris joins them, letting go of Jeff’s hand. He resists,
text: covering his ears. He backs away, headed outside.
text: APPLAUSE ERUPTS. The symphony is over. Doors open. The

scene_heading: EXT. MUSIC HALL - NEXT - NIGHT
text: Jeff walks around the back of the building. He pulls on an
text: unmarked door. Locked. He moves on.
text: He tests another door. Locked.
text: He heads toward a fleet of BLACK TOWN CARS parked on the

dialog: something...
text: He turns just before a door 20 feet back BANGS OPEN. Wesley

text: Kris is still with the abductees. She steps to Jeff as he
text: approaches. He’s stunned, almost smiling:
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: He saw me. He looked at me. He
dialog: knows me.
text: This excites her. She’s thinking of a next step.
scene_heading: EXT. RURAL ROAD NEAR REFINERY - NEXT - NIGHT
text: THREE CARS idle at the fork, parallel to each other.
text: Inside all 11 abductees silently write on index cards.
text: The cards are passed from car to car to car. Kris tallies:
speaker_heading: KRIS
dialog: Seven lefts. Four rights.
text: The cars drive off down the leftmost road.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Next fork. Another vote. They take off right.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

text: Five left. Six right.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Again? Why’s it so close?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: Another vote.
speaker_heading: KRIS.
text: Six to the left.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: It shouldn’t count if it’s that
dialog: close. If there were twelve of us
dialog: it’d be a tie.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Another fork. They continue.
dialog: 211
dialog: Revision 1 90.
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - NEXT - NIGHT
text: Cars gas up. People are tired. They split off into small
text: chats. Dorothy shakes her head, despondent. Keith checks his
text: watch, yawning. The mood is dour.
text: Brent and Jeff confer over a road map:
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: I wouldn’t call it a circle, but if
dialog: we are going somewhere this would
dialog: be the longest possible route to
dialog: it.
text: Carol flips through the votes, comparing, finds something
dialog: odd.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: She walks to Kris with the cards.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Kris? You’re Kris? Will you look at
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Kris marches angrily to an OLD COUPLE, NORA and CLYDE:
speaker_heading: KRIS
dialog: What are you people doing!?
text: They stare back, dumbfounded. Kris holds up index cards:
speaker_heading: KRIS
dialog: What’s wrong with you?! Why are you
dialog: wrecking it? Why are you always the
dialog: same? Every single vote you guys
dialog: agree. Even when you’re wrong you
dialog: agree!
text: They have no answer. Kris turns to Clyde:
speaker_heading: KRIS,
dialog: Show me your ankle. Right now.
speaker_heading: CLYDE
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: He sits. She crouches, pulls down his sock, and sees the
dialog: scar.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 212
scene_heading: CONTINUED: Revision 1 91.
text: Satisfied, she turns to Nora:
speaker_heading: KRIS
dialog: You. Come on. Show me.
text: Nora doesn’t move, obstinate. She looks to Clyde for help.
speaker_heading: KRIS
dialog: You’re not one of us. Are you?
text: Nora refuses to answer.
speaker_heading: CLYDE
dialog: Nora?
speaker_heading: NORA
dialog: It happened to Clyde so it happened
dialog: to me.
text: Kris, furious, SLAPS Nora. Jeff pulls her off.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Kris. Kris. It’s just a story. She
dialog: just made a story.
scene_heading: EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT
text: The cars idle. Index cards are passed in. Brent tallies.
text: Keith leans in the window to see how things are going:
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: Eight to two, seven to three...nine
dialog: to one. Last one was unanimous, an
dialog: even ten.
text: Keith gets back in his car, announces:
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Good votes. Think we’re getting
dialog: close.
text: The cars drive off.
text: Kris, in the front passenger seat, senses something, turns
text: around, scans each face, lands on Graham. What is it?
text: He’s lost in his own world, staring at the door. Ominous.
text: Kris sees that Carol also feels something from Graham.

scene_heading: INT. WESLEY’S FARMHOUSE/ KITCHEN - NEXT - DAWN
text: Wesley eats toast over his morning paper at the counter.
text: Hearing VOICES, he turns to see the abductees out front.
text: They are huddled together, trying to decide something.
text: Recognizing them, he’s a bit surprised but not unhappy. He
text: cleans up his breakfast, tucks in his shirt, and moves
text: toward the front of the house, looking to welcome them.
scene_heading: EXT. WESLEY’S FARMHOUSE - NEXT - DAWN
text: On the edge of the group Carol stares at the pigpen. Kris
text: follows her gaze and ends up staring too.
text: There is a faint discussion about what to do next but it
text: dies down, as one by one they all turn, drawn in.
text: Kris steps first and before long the group is walking toward
text: the pen, everyone but Graham who is nowhere to be seen.
text: Suddenly Kris stops, turns back to the house.
text: We hear a GUNSHOT. The group turns to the house.
text: ANOTHER GUNSHOT, the MUZZLE FLASHES inside the house.
text: Wesley CRASHES through the front door and falls to the
text: ground, escaping from Graham who follows him, GUN
text: outstretched.
text: Stunned silence. They all watch Wesley crawl, slowly die.
text: Jeff moves to disarm Graham but Kris stops him. She knows:
speaker_heading: KRIS
dialog: Wait.
text: Graham puts the gun to the roof of his mouth.

text: The abductees move through the house, silently looking.
scene_heading: INT. LIVESTOCK BUILDING/ WHITE ROOM - NEXT - DAY
text: The cot is still there. Clean linen. Well lit.
text: They file in like they’re touring an historic landmark.
text: When the others leave, Carol can’t tear herself away.
scene_heading: INT. LIVESTOCK BUILDING/ EXAM ROOM - NEXT - DAY
text: They crowd around the desk studying Wesley’s notes,
text: sketches, the CLIPBOARD of abductees’ names.
text: Kris scrolls to the top of the list to the only one without
dialog: a last name...
speaker_heading: KRIS
dialog: Becky.
scene_heading: EXT. PIGPEN - DAY
text: The abductees spread out into the pen.
text: Kris walks alone, slowly but directly, to K. She crouches.
text: JEFF approaches holding the clipboard. He compares K’s tag:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: It’s you.
text: Kris wells up, it finally hitting her that she’s not crazy.
speaker_heading: KRIS
dialog: I know.
text: Beyond them, the others are finding their matching pigs.

dialog: Revision 1 94.
scene_heading: EXT. YELLOW PIGPEN - DAWN
text: The pigs empty out of a LIVESTOCK TRAILER into a large pen
text: surrounded by an AGED YELLOW-PAINTED FENCE.
text: Nora and Clyde wrangle them while other abductees continue
text: repairs on the fence, replacing decay with new lumber.
text: A TRUCK arrives on the road. On the side is painted "’No man
dialog: should be allowed to be President who does not understand
text: hogs.’ - President Harry Truman". A NEW VET emerges.
text: Carol greets her, leads her alongside an OLD YELLOW
speaker_heading: FARMHOUSE.
scene_heading: INT. YELLOW FARMHOUSE - DAY
text: The place is DUSTY, seemingly abandoned for decades. Brent
text: has to practically knock the door down to get in. He carries
text: BOXES of Wesley’s sketches and notes, which he stacks in the
dialog: corner.
text: He looks around at their new workplace.
scene_heading: EXT. YELLOW FARMHOUSE - DAY
text: Over a picnic-table lunch, they all question New Vet:
speaker_heading: CLYDE
dialog: How much space is ideal for them?
dialog: Do they roam? Would they rather
dialog: have smaller pens but more of them
dialog: if that makes sense-
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: NORA
dialog: -so I thought we’d mix in a lot of
dialog: fresh produce, vitamin supplements,
dialog: a lot of whole grains. Is that
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: -no, I’d prefer to keep them
dialog: groomed, get them bathed every
dialog: other day but if the natural
dialog: instinct- I mean if they like being
dialog: shaggy I don’t want to just force-
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: Revision 1 95.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: SELMA
dialog: Do the women, the sows I mean, ever
dialog: separate off? Do they like being
dialog: mixed in all the time? I would
dialog: think-
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: That reminds me...when it does get
dialog: colder...at what temperature do we
dialog: need to start thinking about maybe
dialog: an indoor pen? Space heaters and
dialog: you know...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: All of them, yeah. We just-
dialog: whatever vaccines are available.
text: All of them. All the shots.
speaker_heading: NEW VET
dialog: This is a list of recommended
dialog: vaccines and I’1l certainly inspect
dialog: each animal. The truth is you can
dialog: defend against all manner of
dialog: disease, make them healthy as can
dialog: be. But at some point the cost
dialog: outweighs what you hope to recoup
dialog: at slaughter.
text: The abductees share a look.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Let me stop you. Don’t worry about
dialog: cost. These pigs are going to be
dialog: better cared for than most people’s
dialog: kids. It’s going to be
dialog: embarrassing. Now. If they could
dialog: choose anything...what is it that
dialog: they really love to eat?
text: New Vet looks around the table: is this a joke? Finally she
dialog: just goes
text: with it and laughs...
speaker_heading: NEW VET
dialog: Okay.

dialog: Yes, is this Marsha Potter? My name
dialog: is Brent West. I have...some
dialog: information that...I hope might
dialog: help you.
scene_heading: EXT. YELLOW FARMHOUSE - DAY
text: A CAR drives up. HUSBAND (the one whose wife died) gets out,
text: checks the address against his handwritten note.
text: He walks toward the house as Jeff opens the door for him.
scene_heading: EXT. CREEK/ DRAINAGE DITCH - DAY
text: Elise and Phoebe scout for orchids. Elise is frail now and
text: walks with a cane, slowing their progress. Again we spend
text: too much time trying to see her ankles, still socked.
text: Phoebe has to leave her to step down the incline to the
text: white orchids we have seen before. She scans for the
text: turquoise.
text: She calls back up to Elise:
speaker_heading: PHOEBE
dialog: Gram, there’s none here either.
dialog: Maybe further up? Should I grab
dialog: white?
text: She turns upstream, still hopeful.
dialog: 228

scene_heading: EXT. PLANT NURSERY - DAY
text: Evan is shopping for the orchids, checking leaves like
text: before. He looks all around, not finding them.
text: Peter, trying to help, brings him a candidate. Evan scrapes
text: the leaf with a knife but doesn’t like the residue.
text: He grabs a bit of soil to be sure, checking for worms. No
text: luck so he tosses it and looks elsewhere. Peter follows,
dialog: learning.
scene_heading: EXT. YELLOW PIGPEN - DUSK
text: Kris sits against the fence, content.
text: She holds a newborn PIGLET, lifting it to her face like
text: she’s playing with a baby.
text: All around her K’s other PIGLETS clumsily explore.
