scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES, DAY
text: A hot summer day in downtown LA. The streets are crowded with
text: traffic, dubious street vendors and preachers loudly
text: proclaiming the Apocalypse. The mostly Hispanic crowd mixes
text: with tourists, who stare at this unfamiliar spectacle.
text: BILLY BRODY, early twenties, a street-smart hustler, attempts
text: to cross the street. Billy’s basically a nice guy, despite
text: having walked down some mean streets.
scene_heading: INT. STANLEY'S KITCHEN, DAY
text: The place, a true “hole in the wall” hasn’t seen a new piece
text: of furniture since the day it opened. The big blue “C” for
text: cleanliness prominently displayed, fits. A few locals
text: contemplate their lives over coffee as the air-conditioning
text: hums away. Billy slides onto a stool at the counter.
text: The waitress, SARAH, a beautiful young woman in her late
text: teens, comes out of the kitchen carrying plates of food.
text: Sarah smiles at an older man sitting at the end of the
text: counter while sliding a plate in front of him, then swerves
text: to deposit the others. She glides toward Billy. The two know
text: each other. There is an obvious attraction.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Hi. What can I get you?
text: Billy stares and smiles as Sarah.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Well, I was thinking about the...
text: Sarah starts writing.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: ...Turkey-sandwich?
text: She winks at him. Billy’s delighted she knows it by heart.
speaker_heading: SARAH (CONT'D)
dialog: Just guessing.
text: Sarah sticks the order on the ticket spindle behind her and
text: moves to a soda dispenser, filling a glass and puts it in
text: front of Billy.
speaker_heading: SARAH (CONT'D)
dialog: Diet coke?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: That’s right. How’s everything?
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Just another slow day. Anything else I
dialog: can get you?
text: Billy hesitates. Something is on his mind.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: No, not really. Thanks.
text: Sarah is about to walk away. He calls to her.
speaker_heading: BILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: I was wondering...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yes?
text: There is an awkward pause. Then:
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: It’s been weeks now, me showing up here,
dialog: eating my turkey sandwich...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I was thinking: What if I show up here
dialog: like tomorrow and you’re no longer here?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I guess I’m somewhere else. My day off.
dialog: Like I should be so lucky.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I didn’t mean that.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Why wouldn’t I be here?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You could like decide to get another job,
dialog: or somebody gets sick at home and you'd
dialog: have to leave. Anything can happen, you
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Well, I wasn’t planning to spent the rest
dialog: of my life in this place.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You see? That’s my point. Suppose you
dialog: left with me never finding out your
dialog: favorite ice cream, your favorite movie,
dialog: if you like pizza over hamburgers
dialog: -..stuff like that...or--

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You wanna go out with me sometime? I got
dialog: Dodger’s tickets this Saturday. Wanna go?
text: Sarah is charmed. Billy smiles.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Let me think about it.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I knew it. You don’t like baseball.
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S8.)
dialog: Sarah!
text: Sarah turns and sees her BOSS, a heavy-set man in his
text: fifties, waiving his fingers toward her.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I gotta go.
text: Billy, disappointed, looks on as Sarah disappears into the
text: kitchen. He peeks into the kitchen, catching glimpses of
text: Sarah, as she argues with her boss. Billy sighs. Bad timing.
text: He leaves a ten-dollar note on the counter, then strolls past
dialog: a sign saying “Thank you, have a nice day”.
scene_heading: INT. PARKING-STRUCTURE - TOP FLOOR, DAY
text: Billy exits the elevator of a parking-structure with his cell
text: phone pressed to his ear while walking along rows of parked
text: cars toward a beat-up, sixties, yellow convertible.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: It's Billy.
text: Billy keeps Stanley’s Kitchen on the opposite side of the
text: street, in view. He spots Sarah, still in her waitress
text: uniform, exiting Stanley’s Kitchen. She pulls out a cigarette
text: and lights up.
speaker_heading: BILLY (CONT’D)

scene_heading: EXT. STREET, DAY
text: Aggravated and confused, Sarah is pacing in front of
text: Stanley’s. Billy approaches without her noticing.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Hey!
text: Sarah turns, surprised.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Oh, hi.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I saw you coming out.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We never finished our conversation about--
dialog: He sees there’s something the matter.
speaker_heading: BILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s wrong?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You must be a psychic. Remember you said
dialog: what if you came by tomorrow and I
dialog: wouldn’t be here. Well, guess what?
dialog: Stanley’s is closing. I’m out of a job.
text: They stare at each other.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I don’t know what to say. I’m really
dialog: sorry. Hey, it might be a blessing in
dialog: disguise. Maybe better things are waiting
dialog: to happen for you.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I sure hope so. I got bills and rent due.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Is there anything I can do?
text: The front door of Stanley’s opens. Sarah’s Boss calls.
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: Sarah, you wanna finish your shift?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I’m coming.
text: Her boss's face disappears as quickly as it popped up.
speaker_heading: SARAH (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyway, not a good day.
text: Sarah turns to leave. Billy calls out again.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Why don’t I give you my number. You know,
dialog: just in case, you feel like calling.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Ook.
text: Billy quickly pulls out an old receipt, but struggles to find
text: a pen. Sarah chuckles, then pulls out her pen.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Thanks.
text: He scribbles down his name and number, hands the paper back
text: to her. Sarah looks at it, brightens.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Funny. I didn’t even know your name.
dialog: Billy. I like it.
text: She turns to leave. He calls out to her.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Your pen!
text: Smiling, she spins around, picks her pen from his fingers.
text: Sparks are flying.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Thanks. See ya later, Billy.
text: Billy watches Sarah slip inside, a big smile on his face.
scene_heading: INT. BILLY’S MOTEL ROOM, NIGHT
text: A dark, cheap bedroom. Billy is asleep in his clothes. The
text: telephone rings persistently. Billy, sleepily, reaches out to
text: the phone on his night table.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Yeah? Hello?
text: A look of alarm comes over him.
speaker_heading: BILLY (CONT’D)
dialog: Sit tight. I’m on my way.
text: He falls out of the bed, fumbles for car keys, throws on a
text: jacket and exits the room.
text: It sits empty for a few seconds before the phone starts to
text: ring again, insistent and ominous.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS, NIGHT
text: Dark and empty, barely illuminated, ignored neighborhoods.

scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
text: Billy steers the car over the rough pavement, old train
text: tracks of downtown LA. An occasional neon flashes by. He
text: squeezes the steering-wheel and keeps flooring the pedal as
text: the old V8 roars at hair-raising speed.
scene_heading: EXT. SARAH’S APARTMENT BUILDING - EAST LA, NIGHT
text: The convertible comes to a screeching halt in front of an old
text: apartment building. Billy jumps out of the car, quickly makes
text: his way through the front door of the dilapidated building.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - APARTMENT-BUILDING, NIGHT
text: Billy runs up the staircase facing a gloomy, long hallway. He
text: walks down the corridor, checking for the right apartment.
text: From an apartment door at the far end of the hallway, a dark
text: figure watches Billy who momentarily senses it: He quickly
text: turns and peeks down the corridor: Nothing. Puzzled he moves
text: on. Suddenly, a loud BANG as a door is slammed shut. Billy
text: whirls around. Again. Nothing. Billy finds his way to the
text: correct apartment. He takes a breath, knocks.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Sarah? It’s me, Billy. Open up!
text: No answer. He turns the knob.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT, NIGHT
text: A true dump: Dim light, trash everywhere, cheap furniture.
text: Dirty, yellow walls show cracks, dubious spills. Drug
text: paraphernalia spread out on a coffee table.
text: The twisted and lifeless body of a girl is spread out on a
text: nearby sofa.
text: As Billy slowly enters he freezes at the sight of the dead
text: girl, syringe still sticking in her arm. His face drops as he
text: moves closer toward the dead girl: Sarah.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (a horrified whisper)
dialog: Shit! Sarah!
text: Suddenly Billy’s jolted by the sound of a faint sob. He turns
text: and recognizes a familiar silhouette which gives hima
text: moment's relief: It’s Sarah. The resemblance between the dead
text: girl and her is striking.
speaker_heading: BILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Sarah...what is going on here?
text: Sarah is tear-stained, traumatized.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Ellen, she...I...I...couldn’t..she--

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Jesus Christ, Sarah.
text: Suddenly, police-sirens can be heard in the distance. Billy
text: grabs Sarah by the arm.
speaker_heading: BILLY (CONT’D)
dialog: C’mon grab your stuff...Now!
text: A series of JUMP CUTS
text: Billy helping Sarah dress/Billy stuffing clothing and other
text: random belongings into an old duffel-bag/Sarah rapidly stuffs

scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP/TRUCKSTOP - OUTSKIRTS LA, DAWN
text: Customers sit at the counter of a retro-style coffeeshop.
text: Billy sips a soda in a secluded booth towards the back.
text: Returning from the bathroom, Sarah slides into the booth.
text: She is red-eyed from hard crying and still dazed.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You're ok? Have some coffee, a muffin.
dialog: You’1l feel better.
text: He points to the coffee and an English muffin in front of
text: her. Sarah glances at Billy nervously.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I suppose I owe you an explanation. It’s
dialog: fucked up...how life can turn on you so
dialog: god damn quick. Just yesterday I was full
dialog: of hope, things were changing for the
dialog: better. Finally. Next thing I know I’m
dialog: out of a job, hours later I find my best
text: friend with a needle in her arm. Dead.
text: For a moment, it looks like she’s going to lose it.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Take it easy.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: The girl...is...was...Ellen. My roommate.
text: Billy nods, trying not to pressure her.
speaker_heading: SARAH (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, you've figured out by now I’m not
dialog: this sweet, innocent girl you probably
dialog: might’ve thought I was...
text: A couple of moments pass. Sarah removes her jacket and
text: stretches out her bare arms. She turns both her arms,
text: revealing numerous scars. Needle marks. Healed up.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
speaker_heading: SARAH (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s the past. I don’t do that anymore.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Okay.
text: Quietly, she continues.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: A few months ago, Ellen said she'd had
dialog: enough of all this drug bullshit. She
dialog: wanted to go back to school. So, she
dialog: decides we should both check into rehab.
dialog: She’s on the phone for days till she
dialog: Manages to find a place that takes us.
dialog: She even paid for it. So, we got really
dialog: stoned and we went to this clinic. Except
dialog: when I woke up, she was gone. I stayed.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: What happened to her?
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: They woke her in the middle of the night.
text: Her parents had died in a car crash the
dialog: day before we checked in.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Wow. That’s really fucked up.(pause) What
dialog: about tonight?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: We got into a fight because I asked her
dialog: not to get loaded around me. I tell her
dialog: I’m trying to stay clean and seeing her
dialog: get high doesn’t make it any easier. I
dialog: don’t think any of it registered, y’know?
dialog: Couple of hours later I hear her fighting
text: with the guy from next door, her dealer.
dialog: Our dealer. At some point I fell asleep.
text: Sarah winces at the memory, starts to tremble.
speaker_heading: SARAH (CONT'D)
dialog: And then I just woke up, for no reason,
dialog: y'know, how that happens sometimes? And I
text: see her on the couch sleeping...only she
text: isn’t making noises, like she’s
dialog: breathing...
text: She starts to sob quietly, again. She puts her forehead
text: between her hands. Billy gently touches her wrist.
speaker_heading: SARAH (CONT'D)
dialog: If only I’d just gone next door and told
dialog: that prick to leave us alone!
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Thing is, if it wouldn’t have been that
dialog: dealer, she’d have gotten her dope
dialog: someplace else. If this didn’t happen
dialog: last night maybe it would have happened
dialog: today. Some people just have a short
dialog: ticket on this planet. There’s no rhyme
dialog: or reason for it. It just is.
text: Sarah stares at Billy. She pulls out a cigarette, nervously
dialog: plays with it. Then:
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What am I doing laying all this shit on
dialog: you. We don’t even know each other.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: We sort of do now, don’t you think?
text: Sarah sighs, glances far away.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I should go to the police.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Why? Won’t make any difference now. It’s
dialog: nobody’s fault.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What am I going to do? I don’t even know
dialog: where I’m going to stay.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: How about your folks? Where’s home?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Wisconsin? No thanks. Not interested.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You can stay with me if you like.

scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL ROOM, DAY
text: Leaning against the railing of the second floor, Billy, cell
text: phone to his ear, overlooks the old swimming pool of the
text: fifty plus room motel. In jeans and T-shirt, Sarah steps
text: through the open door. Billy turns, closes up his cell phone.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Good morning.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Look. Thanks for getting me out of there
dialog: last night. That was really cool, but I
dialog: totally don’t want to take advantage of
dialog: you. I should probably go and sort out my
dialog: own problems...
text: Billy interrupts gently.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: +..you can stay as long as you like.
text: She studies him for a beat. Gives a searching look.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You don’t think I’m trash?
speaker_heading: BILLY
text: (shrugs, shakes his head)
dialog: I do not. Everybody’s got a story, a bad
dialog: thing that happened. My theory on life is
dialog: ‘what happened, happened’. It’s what you
dialog: do here and now and tomorrow that counts.
text: Sarah permits herself a smile.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Okay then Mr. Glass Half Full. How about
dialog: you? Like I know nothing about you. Why
dialog: are you living in a motel?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Ahh, it’s temporary. I’m waiting for my
dialog: brother to come back from overseas. He’s
dialog: setting up shop in LA, pending how it
dialog: goes with his suppliers. Wants me as his
dialog: right-hand man.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What kind of business?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Import-Export. That kind of thing.

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Well, I know you’re from Vegas, your Mom
dialog: owns a wedding chapel....you told me that
dialog: the first time you were at Stanley’s.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You know more about me than most.
text: Sarah gets a far-away rueful look in her eye.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I haven’t been to a ball park since I was
dialog: five. That would've been really nice.
text: Billy moves in and gently kisses Sarah.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: So, you do like baseball after all.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I love it.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Billy, spread out on the king size bed, watches baseball on
text: TV, while Sarah rummages through her duffel-bag. However,
text: instead of socks she pulls out several envelopes.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: This is not my stuff.
text: Perplexed, she drops into a nearby chair, pulls out a letter
text: from an already open envelope.
speaker_heading: SARAH (CONT'D)
dialog: I got some of Ellen’s mail by mistake.
text: Sarah starts reading out loud.
speaker_heading: SARAH (CONT'D)
dialog: Law offices of Cameron Brogden, State of

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (reading out loud)

dialog: Alabama law I have filed in probate
dialog: court... a process that might take up to
dialog: ninety days. If you have any questions
dialog: please contact me at your convenience,
dialog: signed Cameron Brogden, attorney at

text: Once again Sarah digs through the bag’s content. Suddenly,
text: she holds up a wallet. Billy moves closer.
speaker_heading: BILLY (CONT’D)
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: It’s Ellen’s wallet.
text: Billy gets up from the bed, steps close to Sarah.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I know, its none of my business, but I
dialog: just wanted to see something.
text: Sarah hands Billy the wallet.
text: CU: DRIVERS LICENCE, displaying Ellen’s picture.
text: Billy looks up at Sarah. As we have seen earlier, the

speaker_heading: BILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Unbelievable.

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I got an idea. It just might work...

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Beautiful.
speaker_heading: BILLY
text: Beautiful but terrifying.
text: She looks at him incredulous.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Why terrifying?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Anything that awesome makes me know for
dialog: sure I’m gonna die.
scene_heading: INT. CAR, NIGHT
text: Its late. Sarah is asleep. Billy can barely keep his eyes
text: open. He reaches towards the dashboard, starts playing with
text: the dial of the radio. He tunes into an old Smashing
text: Pumpkings song, hums along.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: .--- Shakedown 1979, cool kids never have
text: the time - on a live wire right up off

text: An oppressive sun beats down on the green landscape. There is
text: a large Billboard which reads: TREMO - WE’RE FRIENDLY FOLKS.
text: A dirt road extends toward the right. Sarah points.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: This way.
text: Billy turns the wheel and onto a dirt road they go.
scene_heading: EXT. NILES ESTATE, DAY
text: The car approaches a huge five-bedroom plantation-style
text: mansion built in the civil-war years. The grounds are
text: surrounded by large weeping willows and dense woods. Billy
text: and Sarah climb out of the convertible and stare at in awe at
text: the estate of ZACHARY NILES IV. Once impressive the mansion
text: is old and worn, the paint completely gone. They walk toward
text: the large front door.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT PORCH, DAY
text: Billy moves to the left of the porch and starts searching the
text: top edge of the molding, framing two large windows. No luck.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I thought I’d try.
text: Suddenly, a key drops onto the wooden porch. Puzzled, Sarah

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (under her breath)
dialog: I don’t know... creepy shit.

text: floods the hallway.
scene_heading: EXT. TREMO, ALABAMA - POPULATION 2003, DAY.
text: A quiet and lazy day. The DARK FIGURE tailing Billy and Sarah

text: crosses the street, peaks inside the El Camino. The keys
text: swing free in the ignition.

scene_heading: INT. NILES MANSION - LIVING-ROOM, DAY
text: The interior of the mansion matches its outside. Everything

text: Billy, entrenched in a leather couch surrounded by numerous

text: displayed on the tall walls. Even though it’s morning and all

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: My name is Ellen Niles. I was born on
dialog: February seventh, 1986, that makes me 21
dialog: years old. I visited my late, uncle
dialog: Zachary, once, almost fifteen years ago.
dialog: I don't really remember much because I
dialog: was really young.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Why did Niles leave all his cash to Ellen
dialog: - to you?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: He never had any children of his own.
dialog: Besides my parents, who passed away
dialog: recently, I'm his only living relative.
text: Billy fires off the next question:
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: How did Niles get so rich?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: My grandfather was a hot-shot lawyer and
dialog: developer in Pasadena.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Very good.
text: Sarah's attention is caught by a large antique rifle above
text: the fireplace.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Look at this thing.
text: She lifts the rifle from the wall. The weapon is a several
text: pounds too heavy for her, the long double barrel swings up
text: and down. Billy nervously watches. Sarah smiles.
scene_heading: EXT. NILES MANSION - DIRT ROAD, DAY
text: Edward steers with one hand checking the pistol with the
dialog: other.
scene_heading: INT. NILES MANSION - LIVING-ROOM, DAY
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Sure is heavy. Feels like lead. I wonder
dialog: what he used it for?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: It’s a hunting rifle. Be careful...
text: Intrigued, Sarah continues to examine the weapon.

speaker_heading: BILLY (CONT’D)
dialog: Would you put that gun down?
scene_heading: EXT. NILES MANSION - DRIVEWAY, DAY
text: Edward pulls behind some bushes a little ways from the house.
text: Shoving the pistol into his pants he gets out of the car and
text: cautiously approaches the house.
scene_heading: INT. NILES MANSION - LIVING ROOM, DAY
text: The long barrels of the gun keep swinging, pointing in
text: Billy’s direction. Billy gets up and moves toward Sarah,
text: attempting to push the rifle out of the way.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Put it away now. Please.
text: Sarah, rifle in hand, walks up to Billy and kisses him
text: softly.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: This old thing couldn't hurt a fly if it
dialog: wanted to.
text: She smiles seductively, steps backwards. Billy grabs for the
text: rifle, but latches onto the tip of the barrel instead. Sarah
text: laughs, then, suddenly, she trips and falls backwards. He
text: falls on top of her. A playful mock fight breaks out between
text: the two. Sarah pushes Billy with one hand, rifle in the
text: other. He leans in, kisses her. Sarah, still holding the
text: rifle in one hand, moves forward and puts an arm around
text: Billy. She carelessly throws the rifle away from her, onto
text: the floor. As it hits the wooden planks:
text: BOOM! The hunting rifle goes off, blasting out a front
text: window. There's a definite THUMP, as somebody hits the porch
text: outside. Puzzled Billy and Sarah look at each other. Billy,
text: Sarah jump up from the floor.
speaker_heading: SARAH (CONT'D)
dialog: Holy shit!
text: Billy puts his index finger over his mouth, indicating to
text: Sarah to be quiet. He stealthily heads out toward the porch.
scene_heading: EXT. NILES MANSION - PORCH, DAY
text: Billy opens the front door and looks out. Nobody. He sees a
text: small pool of blood in the dirt. Billy looks down: The
text: pistol. Sarah moves up behind him, scared.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Maybe it was an... animal or something.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I don't think so.

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Stay here.
text: Billy cautiously walks toward the car.
scene_heading: INT. EL CAMINO, DAY
text: Billy looks inside the truck. He opens the glove compartment

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Car is registered to a Sal Marinaro.

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I’m freaking out, Billy. Let’s go inside.
text: Sarah turns to go inside the house. Billy remains standing.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You go ahead, I’m gonna look around. Take
text: the gun, just in case. The safety is off,
dialog: be careful. All you do is point and pull
dialog: the trigger.
text: Reluctantly Sarah takes it. Her hands are shaking.
speaker_heading: BILLY (CONT’D)
dialog: Easy, easy. Listen, it was probably an
dialog: accident.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I’m sorry about me playing with that old
dialog: rifle. That was really stupid.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Don’t worry about it.

scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY, NIGHT
text: Edward is staggering along the shoulder of a highway. Pale

scene_heading: INT. NILES MANSION, NIGHT
text: A fan whirls overhead. The front door opens, Billy enters.

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Thank God, you're back. I was worried.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I looked everywhere. There’s nothing but
dialog: woods for miles. Whoever it was...
dialog: disappeared.
text: Billy picks up the pistol, crosses the room and places it
text: into a drawer of a nearby bureau. He slides down next to
text: Sarah, puts his head into her lap and sighing with
dialog: exhaustion.
speaker_heading: BILLY (CONT’D)
dialog: (Pause) You didn’t tell anyone about us
dialog: coming here, did you?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Are you nuts? I can’t believe this.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I’m sorry, I was only asking. (Pause)
dialog: Wanna know what I think? I think some
text: curious hillbilly stuck his nose into the
dialog: wrong place at the wrong time, got some
text: buckshot his ass and hightailed out of

dialog: more to it.
speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: SARAH

scene_heading: INT. NILES MANSION/CELLAR, DAY
text: Billy holds a flashlight as he pries the cellar door open.

text: The space is cluttered with junk. He reaches out and dusts
text: off a cast iron sculpture of a stork. One knee is broken but
text: it still stands, almost three feet high. He turns to leave,
text: but a large framed painting catches his attention. It's an

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: An injunction? Who?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: I don't know, he's... he's claiming he’s
dialog: Niles son.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Las Vegas? Very strange.
text: Billy and Sarah are uneasy. Cameron notices.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Yes, it is strange. My gut feeling is,
dialog: most likely, he’s somebody just looking
dialog: for a quick pay off.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I don’t get it, doesn’t the will leave
dialog: everything to me?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Yes, it does. However, if Niles didn't

speaker_heading: CAMERON

dialog: your case a lot stronger,...but you need
dialog: something more.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: More?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Well, it's not his letter. What you need
dialog: is something he's written, that
dialog: specifically says he wants all of his
dialog: estate going to Ellen, despite any other
dialog: claims.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: What are the odds of finding that?
text: Cameron stands up, puts the letter into his briefcase.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: No reason to get concerned. You see, the

scene_heading: INT. CONVERTIBLE - OUTSKIRTS - TREMO, DAY

speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You look real good, baby. Far cry from
dialog: what I remember. Truly amazing this

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Yeah, sure.

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: EDWARD

speaker_heading: SARAH

dialog: And by the way. I want my piece back.
dialog: Come by tomorrow. Any time between noon

text: Edward simply looks at her. Sarah doesn’t know what to say or
text: do. He mock-tenderly touches her chin.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I’ll be there.
text: Edward pulls out a small plastic bag and drops it between
text: Sarah's legs.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Just that you know, I’m with you, Sarah.

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Back in Vegas I worked with this friend

speaker_heading: BILLY

text: It’s a delicate situation. After a moment:
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: We're this close and you’re doing really

speaker_heading: SARAH

text: We watch as the two are swimming below the surface of the

speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: I’ve had a look at a coroner’s report
dialog: concerning your uncle and it appears that

text: like he was suffocated. Its been ruled a
dialog: homicide. I’m terribly sorry.
text: Sarah pauses. Billy steps into the room, listening. Suddenly

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Well, I didn’t kill him if that’s where

dialog: Billy.
speaker_heading: CAMERON (V.O.)

speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Go right ahead.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: In your professional opinion, how much
dialog: longer is this whole ordeal gonna last?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Well, once foul play is suspected,

dialog: least a month, closer to two.
text: The blinds won’t lower. Billy pulls on it, but it’s stuck.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: A month or two? I don’t think we can stay
dialog: that long.
text: Billy twists the cord way over to the right, then rips it
text: back to the left. Finally the blinds lower.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Are you folks strapped for cash? Since I
dialog: do have power of attorney, it wouldn't be

text: Finally, she removes a disposable syringe.
text: In one bold move, she jolts upward and sticks the needle into
text: Edward's left eye. Edward drops his gun as he covers his face

text: Her voice trembles with fear, anger, anxiety.
speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Mr. Brogden?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: You must be crazy to still be here.
speaker_heading: BILLY

speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: You got the tape?
text: Billy taps with his index finger on the videotape placed next

speaker_heading: CAMERON (CONT’D)
dialog: I hope this is what I came for?
speaker_heading: BILLY

speaker_heading: CAMERON

speaker_heading: CAMERON (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Well, I figured it out pretty quickly.
dialog: I’'d happened to come across this article
dialog: about Ellen’s parents’ accident. Next
dialog: thing I know, you kids show up here with
dialog: your hands out, well, it didn’t exactly

text: Cameron starts to back away.
speaker_heading: CAMERON (CONT'D)
dialog: I hung around this dead-end shithole for

dialog: have it. But, hell, I tried to be fair to
dialog: you. I gave you and that chippie of yours
dialog: every chance to run... but now... you're

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You can't prove I killed the old man,

speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: No, they got enough evidence that Jamie

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Who’s he?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
text: The young fellow who tried to retrieve

speaker_heading: BILLY

speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: I don’t know. The police is going to find

dialog: called you from his cabin several times,
dialog: so it's going to look like...well, you've
dialog: been in contact for... quite a while.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Keep dreaming. You’re not going to see a

speaker_heading: CAMERON (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, do you really think I’m gonna let
dialog: you walk out of here with ten big ones...
dialog: of my money?
text: Cameron whips out a PEARL HANDLED PISTOL, aims, but Billy is
text: ready: He fires his - Edward’s - gun at Cameron from

speaker_heading: CAMERON (CONT'D)
dialog: Fucker...
scene_heading: EXT. NILES MANSION, NIGHT
text: The patrol car, headlights off, slowly approaches the Niles

text: Sarah is aiming at Cameron.
speaker_heading: CAMERON (CONT'D)
dialog: Silly me. I forgot all about you.
text: Dragging his right leg, Cameron limps toward Sarah.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I will pull the trigger.
text: Sarah pulls the trigger. The gun fires nicking Cameron’s ear.

speaker_heading: CAMERON

speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Bob? Jesus Christ, what the hell do you

speaker_heading: SHERIFF ROBERT
dialog: I’m here to arrest these two for criminal
dialog: fraud, trespassing, identity theft and a

speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Then how come you’re pointing your pistol
dialog: at me?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF ROBERT
dialog: Looks like you’re gonna have some
dialog: questions to answer yourself. Put the gun
dialog: down Cameron.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
text: Robert, just turn around, walk away and
dialog: pretend you never drove up here. I’m
text: taking care of the two hoodlums.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF ROBERT
dialog: You mean besides being a hot shot

dialog: What’s left for me then, Cameron?
speaker_heading: CAMERON

text: goes down: Almost simultaneously.
scene_heading: CU: LONG DOUBLE BARREL. BANG!!

speaker_heading: SHERIFF ROBERT
dialog: Let ‘em go Earl.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF ROBERT
text: They’11 wind up behind bars or in the
dialog: obituary page without us lifting a

speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Go on. You heard the Sheriff. Get movin’.

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: How're you feeling? You’ve been sleeping

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You did that?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yep.

speaker_heading: SARAH (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Sure. You seen my jacket somewhere?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Its in car.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I got a surprise. I think you gonna like
dialog: it.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL, DAY
text: Limping, Billy steps out of the motel room. He looks about
text: the parking lot. Except his convertible, there is no other
text: car in sight. Billy spots an ice cream machine close to the
text: front office. He checks his change.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL, FRONT-OFFICE, DAY
text: CU: LARGE BUTTON, being pushed. Seconds later, a wrapped ice
text: cream bar spirals down the dispenser. Billy picks up the
text: frozen treat, then slowly crosses towards his car.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL, PARKING-LOT, DAY
text: CU: CAR-DOOR. Billy opens the door and grabs his jacket from
text: the backseat. He checks the inside pocket, pulls out the cash
dialog: envelope we saw earlier.
text: CU: TRUNK-LOCK. Billy turns the key, opens the trunk lid.
text: He reaches deep inside the trunk. Amidst the junk inside is
text: the broken flamingo sculpture from Niles basement. He slams
text: the hood shut, carrying the weird looking flamingo. Nothing
text: but the sound of traffic in the distance.
speaker_heading: AT THE DOOR
text: The door is slightly ajar. Billy gives the door a gentle
text: kick, it sways open. He steps inside. The room appears empty.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Hey, remember at Stanleys, when I asked
dialog: you about your favorite ice cream? Check
dialog: this out... I brought along a keepsake
dialog: from the plantation...
text: He holds the ice cream bar, puts the flamingo down. There’s
text: no answer. Something isn’t right.
speaker_heading: BILLY (CONT’D)
dialog: Sarah?
text: A gush of wind goes through the room. Curtains blow, doors
text: swing. A series of quick cuts follow:
text: CU: SARAH’S REFLECTION in a mirror on the bathroom door.
text: EDWARD'S large hand covers her mouth.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library

text: WHIP-PAN TO CU: BILLY, as he spots Sarah’s reflection. He
text: whirls his head back to the parking lot, staring at a car at
text: the far end of the parking-lot. It’s the CADILLAC.
text: WHIP-PAN TO CU: A COCKED GUN, pushed into Billy's cheek.
text: WIDE: THE SCENE UNFOLDS. Billy standing inside the room.
text: Keeping Billy at gunpoint, Edward steps out of the corner of
text: the room, tossing Sarah onto the bed.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Ice cream? What flavor?
text: Edward takes the ice cream out of Billy’s hand, licks the
text: bar. A split second later he pistol whips Billy. Billy falls
text: onto the floor, as Edward slams the front-door close.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL, DAY
text: Edward is not a pretty sight, but unmistakably he cleaned
text: himself up since spending time inside the trunk of the
text: Cadillac. His clothes are several sizes too big, obviously
text: stolen. His injured eye is hidden behind an eye patch. Hurled
text: up in the corner of the room, Billy is leaning on Sarah's
text: shoulder. Edward pulls out a small plastic container, tears
text: off the lid with his teeth and starts chewing away on several
dialog: pain killers.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I know... I look terrible. Had to borrow
dialog: some clothes, and what not... but all
dialog: things considered not a bad comeback,
dialog: what do say, Sarah? I even found myself a
dialog: nice 38 along the way...oh... one piece
dialog: of advice: Billy, next time you’re on the
dialog: run, don’t ever park a fucked up car like
dialog: yours along a highway. Might as well put
text: a balloon with a for sale sign on it.
text: Edward pulls out a pint of liquor from his jacket, washes the
dialog: pills down.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT’D)
dialog: Tell me, Billy Boy. You got any money for
dialog: me?
text: Billy hesitates. He takes out the envelope from his jacket,
text: throws it on the bed.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Ten grand’s all I got out of that
dialog: friggin’ lawyer.
text: A grotesque grin comes across Edwards face. He quickly
text: crosses the room, grabs Billy by his shirt and pulls him away
text: from Sarah. Edward sticks the barrel of the 38. into Billy’s
dialog: mouth.

text: Edward cocks the gun.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT’D)
dialog: Where is the rest?
text: Billy, shaking with fear, mutters something incomprehensible.
text: Edward slowly removes the pistol from Bills mouth, keeps the
text: barrel point at him.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You can turn the place upside down.
dialog: That’s all there is, I swear.
text: Edward steps back and sits down on the bed. He takes the
text: envelope and start counting the bills.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Thief like you invests all that time baby
text: sitting little Sarah and ten measly
dialog: grand’s all you got to show for? Billy,
dialog: that’s about five cents on every dollar
dialog: you owe me. That’s not good. Not good at

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Billy... what’s he talking about?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Go ahead, tell her.
text: Billy stays silent while Edward keeps counting the dollar
dialog: notes.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Tell me what?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You see Sarah, your boyfriend sold a
dialog: half a kilo of my dope to pay his
dialog: gambling debts. Turns out that Billy’s
dialog: buyer just happens to be an acquaintance
dialog: of mine... Get the picture? Well, me nice
dialog: guy that I am, instead of chopping his
dialog: good for nothing head off, I let him have
dialog: a chance to redeem himself. All he had to
dialog: do is give you a helping hand collecting
dialog: your look-alike’s fortune. Sarah baby,
dialog: you follow? You look confused. You were
dialog: set up, you understand?
text: Sarah stares at Billy in disbelief.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I need a cigarette.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
dialog: 102.
text: Edward pulls out a pack of smokes and throws the cigarettes
text: toward Sarah. Close to a nervous breakdown, she lights up.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Take the money and let us go.
text: Edward raises his voice.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Got yourself a little romance in the
dialog: works, Billy? Can’t blame you, I took a
dialog: joyride myself with that sweet pumpkin.
dialog: And boy, does she have a surprise waitin’
dialog: and I ain’t talking about strawberry ice
dialog: cream. Sorry folks, there ain’t gonna be
dialog: no happy ending... ‘cause the both of you
dialog: made one very bad mistake.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: What’s that?
text: Edward moves toward Billy and Sarah, clinches his fist.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I got hurt real bad and I’m really...
text: (searches for the word) ... pissed off.
text: SUDDENLY, Edward is struck by a terrifying wave of rage. He
text: picks up the whiskey bottle and throws it against the wall.
text: The bottle smashes into pieces, the liquor drenches the
text: carpet. He strikes Billy with his gun across the face. Billy
text: cries out in pain.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Stop it!!
text: Sarah throws her arms up, attempting to hit Edward. The lit
text: cigarette goes up in the air, then hits the alcohol-drenched
text: carpet. The carpet ignites. Edward punches her into the
text: stomach. Sarah falls to the ground, groaning, coughing.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You wanna to kill me, baby? Well, you
dialog: don’t know what you’re doing. Forgot to
dialog: make sure to kill me dead! Let me show
dialog: you how its done...
text: Edward points his gun at Billy. Billy’s eyes drift towards
text: the flames. For a snip of a moment Edward turns around, sees
text: the blaze going up the wall behind him. Billy takes
text: advantage, jumps up and tackles Edward. Viciously fighting,
text: both men fall onto the bed while the fire spreads around
text: them. Sarah, coming to, looks on in horror.
text: CU: GLASS TOP, NIGHT-STAND, as it crashes, leaving large
text: pieces of glass spread about the carpet.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
dialog: 103.
text: Meanwhile, the fight continues. Despite his injuries Edward
text: appears to gain the upper hand as he slowly pushes the gun
text: towards Billy's chest. Billy, helplessly, stares into
text: Edward’s face.
text: CU: EDWARD'S FACE, twitching with pleasure. Suddenly, he
text: grimaces with pain.
text: Sarah, a large piece of glass in both hands repeatedly
text: thrusts the sharp object into Edward’s back. Finally, her
text: stabbing-frenzy comes to an end, Edward stumbles backwards.
text: As if that wasn’t “enough”, Sarah spots the flamingo with its
text: broken off leg, exposing a metal rood. She grabs the
text: sculpture and plants the stake-like pole deep into Edwards
text: chest, leaving the flamingo standing tall. Sarah shouts:
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Dead enough for you, asshole?
text: In the meantime, most of the room, including the money, is
text: consumed by fire. Billy takes Sarah’s hand and pulls her out
text: the front door.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL, DAY
text: The couple comes dashing out the room. A dark cloud of smoke
text: follows them. The twosome runs toward the convertible.
text: Moments later the car takes off, leaving the burning motel
text: and Edward behind.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY, YELLOW CONVERTIBLE, NIGHT
text: Billy is at the wheel. Sarah peeks into the dark. Both look
text: pale and tired. A long silence. Then:
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: So, was it all true, what he said?
text: Billy stares into the night ahead.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: It was my only chance to get out. So, I
dialog: went along.
text: Sarah is almost amused by how disappointing it all is.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: They must've had a school to train you to

speaker_heading: BILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Somehow in my fucked-up head I kept
dialog: thinking that once I found a way around
dialog: the lawyer, we'd be set up for life, and
dialog: how it started wouldn’t matter. It’s a
dialog: bad gambler’s habit: You need a lucky
dialog: streak so bad you get convinced it’s
dialog: gotta come.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You really want me to believe that?
text: Billy pulls over onto the shoulder of the highway. There is
text: silence as the engine idles calmly. Then:
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Sarah, there is no excuse for what I did,
dialog: But, if I would have known about... what
dialog: he did to you, I would have killed that
dialog: monster a long time ago.
text: Sarah looks ahead with a strange calm.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: --. he lied. Nothing happened. (beat)
dialog: You’11 never know how sad it feels when a
dialog: guy says just what you want to hear but
dialog: none of it’s true. Every kiss, every
dialog: look... nothing but a fairy-tale.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: But it was true.
text: Sarah half-laughs, half cries at him saying that.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: How do you get off saying that?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I was in love with you from the first
dialog: moment I walked into Stanley's. No matter
dialog: what else I said, no matter what else I
dialog: did, that was always true. It still is.
text: Billy pulls out a rolled up canvas from the back seat and
dialog: hand it to Sarah.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Remember the painting?
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: The one above the fireplace.
speaker_heading: BILLY
