scene_heading: 1 INT. SUV -- DAY 1
text: No sound. We are in a speeding SUV. The passenger, LARA,
text: unsnaps her seat belt and reaches for the door handle. The
text: driver, JOHN, sees her door open and dives to GRAB her. The
text: SUV spins, HORNS BLARE, TIRES SCREECH, cars swerve to avoid
dialog: collision. We aren't sure what is happening, but we know

scene_heading: THE LAST THREE YEARS
scene_heading: 2 INT. STEAK HOUSE -- NIGHT 2
text: Two couples sit at a table, picking at dessert, JOHN and
text: LARA BRENNAN on one side, MICK and ERIT on the other. JOHN
text: is attractive in a worn kind of way, but has the eyes of a
dialog: kid with a discipline problem. You have to really know him
dialog: to understand if he is mocking you or agreeing with you. He
dialog: is a master of irony and has a true enjoyment of the absurd.
text: LARA looks beautiful even in her wrinkled suit. She appears
text: to have had a hard day at the office. She's been drinking
text: at dinner; it hasn't eased her nerves. John's good-looking
text: brother, MICK, boasts his blue collar roots and a gorgeous,
text: if slightly trashy, girlfriend, ERIT, who isn't ashamed of
text: her body or sharing her opinions. JOHN and MICK are laughing.
text: Lara puts cash on the tray beside Mick's credit card.
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: You know what? If you were smart
dialog: you would stop talking right now.
speaker_heading: ERIT
dialog: Sue me. I just know that women should
dialog: never work for women.
text: John laughs and applauds. Mick buries his head.
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: How can you say that??
speaker_heading: ERIT
dialog: They're always threatened. Especially
dialog: if you're beautiful and they're not.
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: Erit, you are so full of shit.
speaker_heading: ERIT
dialog: So, your boss isn't threatened by
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: 2 CONTINUED: 2
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: Because she's a bitch! --
dialog: (as John and Mick laugh)
dialog: --Not because she's a woman.
speaker_heading: ERIT
dialog: And you would describe her as
dialog: "attractive"?
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: That has nothing to do with it!
speaker_heading: ERIT
dialog: And there is my answer.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Either of you like another drink?
text: Lara shoots John a burning look as Erit builds on her victory.
speaker_heading: ERIT
dialog: Women should work under men, men
dialog: under women. That's it.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (egging her on)
dialog: But men under men?
speaker_heading: ERIT
dialog: That's fine, too.
dialog: (the men burst into laughter)
dialog: They're used to it! Why are you
dialog: laughing?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: (re: Erit)
dialog: I don't know, bro, but I think I'd
dialog: rather work under you than her.
speaker_heading: ERIT
dialog: (insulted, shoots back)
dialog: Oh please, I'd rather work under
dialog: him, too.
text: That was a dig at Mick but Lara is primed for a fight.
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: You'd rather "work under" John?
speaker_heading: ERIT
dialog: You have a problem with that, too?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: 2 CONTINUED: (2) 2
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: No, why would I have a problem with
dialog: your little sexual innuendo?
speaker_heading: ERIT
dialog: What is up your ass tonight??
dialog: Mick throws John a "This is all your fault and now it is
text: going to explode" look. John feigns complete innocence.
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: So, I shouldn't take offense that
dialog: you're coming on to my husband right
text: in front of me.
speaker_heading: ERIT
dialog: (claws out now)
dialog: Lara, if I wanted your husband I
dialog: would have him.
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: How? You couldn't possibly show him
dialog: more of your tits.
text: The men are on their feet before blows are exchanged.
speaker_heading: ERIT
dialog: -- You know what your problem is?!
speaker_heading: JOHN MICK
dialog: That was a great meal! Okay--okay!
scene_heading: 3 EXT. STEAK HOUSE PARKING LOT -- NIGHT 3
text: Mick and Erit head toward Mick's sporty pickup. John and
text: Lara step into foreground, Lara still fuming.
speaker_heading: JOHN
text: She is completely full of shit.
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: DON'T try and agree with me now.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You know what? I don't even believe
dialog: she is in the dental profession.
text: Lara knows this game; he is trying to get her out of her
text: black mood, and she has no intention of letting him.
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: 3 CONTINUED: 3
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I bet she can't even spell
dialog: anesthesiologist. Woman's a complete
dialog: fraud.
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: We went to her office party, idiot.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I think she hit on me that night,
dialog: too.
text: Lara opens the back door of their black Prius and tosses in
text: the raincoat she was carrying. They climb in, under....
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: You are completely delusional. She
dialog: wasn't even hitting on you in there;
dialog: I just don't like her.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I understand. People who look like
dialog: that should not be allowed anywhere
text: near oral surgery.
text: She feels a smile coming to her lips and tries to force it
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: You are such an asshole.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You're in the chair trying to stay
dialog: calm; how are you supposed to do that
dialog: with those things hanging over your--
text: She can't stand how attractive he is in this moment -- she
text: stops him short by kissing him passionately. His hands slip
text: under her blouse; she tugs at his sweater.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Someone's going to --
text: Her hand goes to his pants. He yanks at the seat lever and
text: it goes crashing back, Lara landing atop him.
text: After a moment he sits up quickly and pushes down the visors.
text: She laughs and kisses him and they disappear into each other.
scene_heading: 4 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - BACK DOOR -- NIGHT 4
text: Lara and John enter, Lara carrying her raincoat, her hair
text: sticking up in the back, John's shirt untucked.

speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: Hello!
text: JENNA, the teenage baby-sitter, sees right through them.
speaker_heading: LARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Did he cry?
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Only when I dropped him down the
dialog: stairs.
text: Lara shoots her a look, hangs up her coat and exits upstairs.
scene_heading: 5 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY 5
text: She peeks in her son's room, sees him sleeping soundly.
scene_heading: 6 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FOYER 6
text: Lara comes down to find John paying Jenna. John nods for
text: her to check the mirror. She tugs at the knot in her hair.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Thanks. See you next weekend.
text: Jenna exits. Lara shows him that his sweater is inside out.
text: John reacts: "Oh God." Lara's smile broadens; she kisses
text: him. He pins her to the wall and they start all over again.
text: He feels for the light switch. He finds it; we cut to BLACK.
scene_heading: 7 INT. JOHN AND LARA'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 7
text: Lara wakes, troubled. It's the middle of the night.
scene_heading: 8 INT. LUKE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 8
text: Lara finds Luke's window closed but unlocked. She locks it
text: and looks out. Satisfied, she sits and watches her son sleep.
scene_heading: 9 INT. KITCHEN -- MORNING 9
text: Three year-old LUKE holds a knife and fork as he sits at the
text: table watching his dad cut up his pancakes.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Okay, your turn.
text: Luke skewers a piece with his fork. Lara passes, hustling
dialog: to get to work.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Very good, very good...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: 9 CONTINUED: 9
text: Luke puts it in his mouth.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: No, no, no; you feed me.
dialog: (to Lara)
dialog: Your son is hopeless.
text: Lara grabs her phone and leans over them to take a photo.
speaker_heading: LARA
text: Squeeze in tight.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You can't do this every morning. It
dialog: is way too corny.
speaker_heading: LARA
text: Smile. It's just until he's eighteen.
text: It flashes. Lara kisses John, puts an alien-looking electric
text: toothbrush on the table &amp; walks off to pour coffee to go.
speaker_heading: LARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Present.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (examining it)
dialog: Sweetie, you have to stop believing
dialog: everything you read in a catalogue.
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: You hate brushing your teeth; this
text: one brushes them in thirty seconds.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (as if stung)
dialog: I love brushing my teeth.
dialog: (to Luke)
dialog: The lies your mother tells.
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: (ignoring him)
dialog: When's your last class?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Three, and I have papers to grade.
dialog: Can you pick up Luke?
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: After yesterday I probably don't
dialog: have a job anyway. Do you think it
dialog: was wrong to call her a useless cow?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: 9 CONTINUED: (2) 9
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Bosses admire that kind of frank
dialog: exchange.
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: (pulls note off fridge)
dialog: Did you call your father?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: (heading for bathroom)
dialog: "When?" Yesterday, for his birthday!
scene_heading: 10 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - BATHROOM 10
text: Lara puts her foot up and jabs herself with insulin.
speaker_heading: JOHN (O.S.)
dialog: I sent him flowers and a handmade
dialog: card.
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: You're completely impossible.
speaker_heading: JOHN (O.S.)
dialog: Did you notice what I got for my
dialog: birthday this year? A grunt.
scene_heading: 11 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - KITCHEN 11
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Mom said Happy Birthday and my father
dialog: went <grunts>. Made me tear up.
text: Lara returns, trying hard not to smile.
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: Ever think that someone has to be
dialog: the bigger person here?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (to Luke)
dialog: Remember this for the custody hearing:
dialog: how Mommy is always scolding Daddy.
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: How are you going to feel if Luke
dialog: grows up and doesn't call you?
text: Lara can't keep a straight face and heads to the foyer.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: 11 CONTINUED: 11
speaker_heading: JOHN
text: Now she's driving a wedge between us.
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: I give up.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: And now she is abandoning you.
text: Lara grabs her raincoat and notices a stain on the back
text: shoulder. Irritated, she heads back to the bathroom.
scene_heading: 12 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM 12
text: Lara rinses the stain under the sink, surprised to see it
text: run red. She looks at her hands: blood. The doorbell rings.
scene_heading: 13 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - KITCHEN 13
text: John rises to answer the door.
scene_heading: 14 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM 14
text: Lara looks at her coat, wonders how the hell she got blood
text: on her shoulder. She rubs liquid soap into it.
scene_heading: 15 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FOYER 15
text: As John opens the door, DETECTIVE QUINN shows his badge.
text: DETECTIVE COLLERO and a team of detectives push past. John
text: has no time to react.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE QUINN
dialog: Police. Mr. Brennan?
text: LUKE sees the police rush past him and gets scared.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE QUINN (CONT'D)
dialog: My name is Detective Quinn. This is
dialog: a search warrant for these premises.

speaker_heading: DETECTIVE QUINN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: DETECTIVE COLLERO
dialog: Lara Brennan?
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: WHAT?!
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE COLLERO
dialog: Lara Brennan, you are under arrest

speaker_heading: DETECTIVE QUINN
dialog: I will only --
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (tries again)
dialog: She didn't do anything!
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE QUINN
text: Put him in cuffs.
text: The uniform pushes him up against the wall and cuffs his

text: out in handcuffs and the house is torn apart. Cut to BLACK.
scene_heading: 18 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- NIGHT 18
speaker_heading: LUKE (O.S.)
dialog: Daddy!... DADDY!!
text: A light comes on. John steps out of his bedroom and enters
text: his son's room.
speaker_heading: JOHN (O.S.)
dialog: It's okay. Just a bad dream.
text: He comes back out carrying Luke, now SIX YEARS-OLD.
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: 19 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 19
text: John lays Luke on the bed and climbs in beside him.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You okay?
text: Luke nods.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, you can sleep here as long as
dialog: you stay on this side of the bed.
text: Luke immediately scrambles over his father to take his side.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: You're such a snake, I don't know why
dialog: I keep falling for the same trick.
text: John kisses Luke, who closes his eyes and snuggles his pillow.
text: John reaches for the lamp. Beside it sits the framed photo
dialog: that Lara snapped of the three of them that fateful morning.
text: He switches off the lamp, and the screen goes BLACK.
scene_heading: 20 EXT. PITTSBURGH -- DAY 20
text: The "T," the city's fast-moving trolley, rises up from

scene_heading: 21 EXT. ALLEGHENY COUNTY JAIL -- DAY 21
text: Tilt down from a passing T-Train to find John and Luke,
text: walking toward the huge, modern Allegheny County Jail.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Not at lunch.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Does he take your food?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Good. Where did you hit him?
speaker_heading: LUKE
text: Near the swings.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Wow. I bet that hurt.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah.
scene_heading: 22 INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- DAY 22
text: - John waits in a long line, mostly women. He glances over
text: at the pleasant and colorful play area in the corner and
text: sees children playing. Luke plays by himself.
text: - John puts his key ring in a plastic container. The guard
text: takes it and puts the keys with other visitors' belongings.
text: John guides his son toward the metal detector. Luke walks
text: through and the buzzer goes off.
text: John instinctively moves forward to help. A guard stops him
text: with a hand on his chest. On the other side of the metal
text: detector another guard runs a wand over Luke, pulls something
text: from his pocket, looks at it curiously.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It's a toy!
text: The guard runs the wand over the child again; no screech.
text: The guard waves John through. No beep. John kneels and

speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't worry. We'll get it back.

scene_heading: 24 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- DAY 24
text: John stares out the window at the city beyond. Life seems
dialog: so close.
text: He looks back into the large communal visiting room; a dozen
text: round tables and plastic chairs. The concrete block walls
text: are covered with naive paintings in bright colors and messages
text: of hope. Luke plays at his feet with a basket of Legos.
text: The door at the far side buzzes, a guard opens it and
text: prisoners in red jump-suits marked VISITING ROOM enter.
text: Lara enters and looks around. She is pale, thin and her
text: hair has returned to its natural color. Lara hurries to him
text: and gives him a real kiss. She breaks and steps to Luke,
text: who plays with his back to her.
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: Hi honey. Can Mommy get a kiss?
dialog: (no response. Tickles him)
dialog: Come on, give Mommy a kiss.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Rat-Bag. Give Mommy a kiss.

speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: Is Daddy reading you my letters?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Every night at bedtime.
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: What are you building? A fort?
text: Lara pulls him into a hug; no response. She kisses his head
text: and sits at the table with John. She squeezes his hand.
speaker_heading: LARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Was he scared going to school?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I walked him to class, gave him a kiss;
text: he didn't even look back to wave.
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: What did you make him for lunch?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 13.
scene_heading: 24 CONTINUED: 24
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Turkey sandwich, just butter and
dialog: bread, no "vegetables" on it. He
dialog: swore he ate his apple.
text: He hands her a pack of photos. Lara devours them.
speaker_heading: LARA
text: Look at his friends. And his desk.
dialog: This is his teacher?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Miss Phillips.
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: You may have to move to another school
dialog: district.
speaker_heading: JOHN
text: Already spoke to a realtor.
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: (still looking at photos)
dialog: How was your first day?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Excellent. Over half my class stayed
dialog: awake. Talked to your mom.
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: When is she coming?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: She's having a lot of trouble with
dialog: her business.
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: It's only been a couple of years,
dialog: I'm sure she'll get around to it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Have you heard anything?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: About the appeal? Yes, and I'm just
dialog: not telling you. What did Meyer
dialog: say?
speaker_heading: LARA

speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: I saw that woman. She was there.
dialog: She couldn't have just disappeared.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Meyer's looking for a new
dialog: investigator.
speaker_heading: LARA
text: Her coat snagged my purse, I felt a
dialog: button pop - they must have been
dialog: blind not to find it.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: He'll go through all the evidence
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: Great, because I haven't quite
dialog: bankrupted us yet.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We're doing fine.
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: (fondly)
dialog: You just lie and lie.
dialog: (strokes his face)
dialog: But you are very handsome.
dialog: (admiring him)
dialog: Can you do me a favor?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I don't know, I'm a little busy.
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: I need you to run for governor.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: -- Oh, that I can do.
speaker_heading: LARA
dialog: You can change this rule about no
dialog: conjugal visits, because I don't
dialog: think I can last another twenty years.
text: She smiles but is already traveling toward a dark place. He
text: reaches out and holds her tight, stroking her back.
speaker_heading: LARA (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm okay. I'm okay.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

scene_heading: 24 CONTINUED: (3) 24

dialog: again?
scene_heading: 25 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- LATER 25
text: The prisoners file out and are patted down. Lara turns and
text: blows Luke and John a kiss. They watch with the other
text: visitors, who all stand on the far side of the room.
scene_heading: 26 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CHANGING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 26
text: Lara and the female inmates pull off their visiting jump-
text: suits and hand them to a female guard, who searches them for
text: contraband. Lara retrieves her regular jump-suit and pulls
text: it on over her underwear. Another small, daily humiliation.
scene_heading: 27 INT. JOHN'S BATHROOM -- NIGHT 27
text: Start VERY CLOSE ON JOHN'S DIGITAL WATCH. Widen to see Luke
text: standing on a low step at the sink in his pajamas using a
text: complicated-looking electric toothbrush. John sits on the

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty.

text: Luke nods.
scene_heading: 28 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - GARAGE AND ALLEY -- MORNING 28
text: The garage door opens; the Prius has a lot more miles on it.
text: John backs out, Luke in his child seat. He brakes and finds

speaker_heading: PAULA
dialog: They won't recycle these unless you

dialog: (cap vs. bottle)
dialog: This is trash. This is recyclable.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Ok. Thanks.
text: John drives off, wondering what kind of world he lives in.
scene_heading: 29 EXT. PARK -- DAY 29
text: Sitting on the park bench, John allows his feelings to wash
text: over his face. He watches Luke play with a girl his age.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Luke! Let's go, Toad. Come on.
text: Luke runs to him. John pulls Luke's jacket on. He doesn't
text: notice the young mother on the next bench, NICOLE, watching
text: him admiringly. She calls to the girl Luke was playing with.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Time to go, Carrie!
text: John glances in time to see CARRIE plop down in the sand,
text: arms folded. He shares a sympathetic smile with Nicole, who

scene_heading: 30 INT. CRIMINAL COURTHOUSE -- DAY 30
text: John waits as a courtroom lets out. MEYER FISK steps out

scene_heading: 31 INT. COURTROOM -- A SHORT TIME LATER 31
text: John sits on a bench, pale and shaken, flipping through the
text: ruling. The courtroom is empty, save a bailiff eating at
text: his desk. During this he gets up and walks out past them.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: But what if we find the woman who
dialog: was leaving the parking lot?
speaker_heading: MEYER
dialog: The PCRA was rejected. No new
dialog: evidence can be submitted. Not
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It was a robbery! Someone stole her
dialog: purse!
speaker_heading: MEYER
dialog: And if they'd used her credit cards
dialog: we would have had something to argue.
dialog: I'm sorry; this really...sucks.
text: John offers a smile at Meyer's unlawyer-like choice of words.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: So, that's it. Now we just have the
dialog: Supreme Court.
speaker_heading: MEYER
dialog: John, in the last thirty years, the
dialog: Supreme Court hasn't heard one murder
dialog: case. No decent lawyer would even
dialog: file the pleadings.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: So, I need to find an indecent one?
speaker_heading: MEYER
dialog: No, I'm going to file it. But I

speaker_heading: MEYER

scene_heading: 51 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - KITCHEN -- NIGHT 51

scene_heading: 150 INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- DAY 150
text: Face chalk white, John heads for the exit, fighting the urge

speaker_heading: DETECTIVE COLLERO

speaker_heading: MALE NEIGHBOR

scene_heading: 196 EXT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 196
text: John's father watches through the window as his son leaves.
text: In his gut, George knows something is wrong.
scene_heading: 197 EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT 197
text: John sits in his car down the street, watching the corner
dialog: where he noticed kids selling drugs.
text: A car shows up - the same flashy car he saw weeks ago. The
text: street dealer looks around, runs to the window, makes an
text: exchange, and then the car drives off again. John checks
text: his watch and settles in to wait.
scene_heading: 198 EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT 198
text: John watches as other cars drive up and score drugs. And
text: then finally the flashy car cruises up again. John checks
text: his watch: it has been two hours. Again the street dealer
text: runs up and hands the driver an envelope. We recognize the
dialog: driver -- he is the one from earlier, whom we are going to
text: call DAVID. He drives away. John follows.
scene_heading: 199 EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT 199
text: John follows the flashy car at a distance. It stops at
text: another corner and something is exchanged. It drives on;
text: John follows.
scene_heading: 200 EXT. HILL DISTRICT - NEIGHBORHOOD -- NIGHT 200
text: Not the best part of town. It looks rough even for The Hill.
text: The flashy car parks and David crosses the street.
text: Half a block back, John turns left at the corner and then
text: makes a quick right into the alley. He guesses how many
text: houses from the corner David stopped, gets out and checks
text: over the fences.
text: He stops a few houses away when he sees the porch light on a
text: house flick on. David waits on the dilapidated back porch.
text: He waves to whoever is watching him through the pinhole and
text: the light goes out again.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: WHITE 9-10-09 68.
speaker_heading: 200 CONTINUED: 200
text: John inches closer as the back door opens. David exchanges
text: a few words with whoever opened it and then packages are
text: exchanged. The door closes and David walks off the way he
dialog: came.
text: John waits a moment, then moves down the alley, hops the
text: fence, and sneaks through the twisted bramble of the back
text: yard. He finds a place to hide, on the ground right beside
text: the back porch. He pulls out his gun and settles in to wait
text: between the trash cans, his heart pounding in his ears.
text: Fade to BLACK. Beat, then: BANG! BANG! BANG!
scene_heading: 201 EXT. DRUG DEALER'S BACK YARD -- LATER THAT NIGHT 201
text: John WAKES to HAMMERING on the door. The porch light flicks
text: on and John is bathed in bright light -- he didn't realize
text: he'd fallen asleep. David stands above him on the porch,
text: holding the screen door open -- if he glanced down there is
dialog: no way he wouldn't see him.
text: John holds his breath and waits. The porch light flicks
text: off, the locks are unbolted, and finally the thick door opens.
text: As before, the two exchange words, but now the POUNDING in
text: John's ears is so loud we can barely hear anything else.
text: John takes a deep breath and springs to his feet -- knocking
text: over the trash cans -- and onto the porch!
text: He smacks David with the gun, grabs him by the hair and jams
text: him forward into the doorway, preventing the supplier --
text: ALEX -- from slamming the door on them.
scene_heading: 202 INT. ALEX'S HOUSE -- NIGHT 202
text: Alex releases his BARKING German shepherd and it immediately
text: attacks David, biting his leg. David screams in agony.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (to Alex)
dialog: Back up! Get back!
text: Suddenly a THUG comes barreling in from the kitchen and aims
text: a sawed-off shotgun at John, who keeps himself right behind
text: David's head. The dialogue is almost drowned out completely
text: by the sound of POUNDING in John's ears and David's SCREAMING.
speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: -- Good idea!

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (to thug)
dialog: -- Put the gun down!
text: The thug obeys, rests it against the wall.
speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: -- Release!
text: The dog stops its attack but goes back to barking.
speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: -- Give me that chair!
text: Alex doesn't obey, so David grabs it and hands it to him.
text: John props it under the handle of the closet door.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Move!
text: He shoves David forward, closer to Alex.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You're dead.
speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You brought him!
speaker_heading: DAVID

text: John shoves David to the floor and waves the gun between
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: On your knees! Hands behind your
dialog: head!

text: it, flips open the cylinder and spills out the cartridges.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I can't kneel!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: On the floor!

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You won't even shoot a dog.
speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Shoot the floor again, impress me.
text: John pistol-whips him and Alex goes down. John holds his

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I'm going to kill you both.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: No, I'm going to kill you both.
speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: ALEX

dialog: See? You aren't going to kill me.
dialog: That was the worst you can do. So,
dialog: now you've done it. Go home. I'll
dialog: come find you and kill you.
text: John looks around desperately. He spots an open bottle of

text: it on the floor.
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: You're wasting some good shit.
text: Now he pours it on Alex.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Yeah, good shit; high alcohol content.

speaker_heading: THUG (O.S.)
dialog: What's going on?! Let me out!
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You going to burn me out?

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: ALEX

text: gun in his temple and shoves him into the front hall.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Let me go!!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Get up there!!
text: John pushes him up the stairs as a shield, following the

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The house is going to explode!
scene_heading: ANGLE ON BACK DOOR
text: Fire spreads, the thug yells, the dog barks. The shotgun

scene_heading: 204 INT. ALEX'S HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR -- NIGHT 204
text: John moves David quickly up the stairs in front of him and
text: down the hall. They peer into one room, nothing. Into the
text: next - what is clearly a CHILD'S ROOM.
text: Alex kneels on the far side of the room, barely visible behind
text: the small bed, his back to us.
text: Until he wheels, gun in hand, and FIRES twice.
text: A bullet strikes David in the chest, the second grazes John's
text: side. Both men are knocked back into the hall and onto the
text: floor. John pulls himself out from under David as...
text: Running on adrenaline, Alex stands and strides forward.
text: David looks up at him. Alex shoots him again and steps over
text: him into the hall. He sees John, raises his weapon and....
text: John fires twice, hits Alex in the chest, knocking him down.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: 204 CONTINUED: 204
text: John stands. Alex lies dead, sprawled over David. David
text: looks around through the roiling smoke:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Is anyone up here?!
text: He steps over Alex and into the room. He checks the closet --
text: empty of clothes; clearly no child lives here. John turns
text: to where Alex was kneeling, sees a bureau pushed aside, a
text: safe crudely installed in the wall lying open, a trash bag
text: on the floor half-filled with cash.
text: John drops to his knees and shovels the remaining cash into

scene_heading: 205 INT. ALEX'S HOUSE - BACK HALL -- CONTINUOUS 205

dialog: knows is a mistake. Cut to BLACK.
scene_heading: 207 INT. ALEX'S HOUSE - BACK HALL -- MOMENTS LATER 207
text: John carries David past the closet just as the thug's boot
text: kicks a hole in the door. Cut to BLACK.
scene_heading: 208 EXT. ALLEY BEHIND ALEX'S HOUSE -- NIGHT 208
text: John, bleeding himself, shoves the badly wounded dealer into
text: the back seat. He throws the trash bag into the passenger
text: seat and slams the door closed behind him. Not even a
text: heartbeat later THE GERMAN SHEPHERD leaps up and snaps at
text: the partially open window. John struggles to get the car
text: turned on and the window up as THE DOG tries to force his
text: way into the car.
text: Through the front windshield he sees THE THUG leap over the
text: back fence, landing sprawled in the alley with the shotgun.
text: John jams the car into reverse and backs away -- the man in

dialog: shoulder.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don't want to die. I don't want
dialog: to die.
text: Now at a safe distance, John pulls over and looks into the
text: back seat. We don't have to see the body to know he's dead.
text: John sits there a moment, listening to the sounds of
text: approaching fire engines. He catches a glimpse of himself
text: in the rearview mirror before pulling out. Cut to BLACK.
scene_heading: 211 EXT. BUS STOP -- NIGHT 211
text: John's car idles at the curb, his back door sits open. He
