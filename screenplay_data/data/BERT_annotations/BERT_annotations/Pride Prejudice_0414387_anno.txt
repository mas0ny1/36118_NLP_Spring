speaker_heading: TITLE:
dialog: "It is a truth universally

text: Its a whirlwind of activity. Servants bustle around,

scene_heading: 2 EXT. LONGBOURN HOUSE - DAY. 2
text: Elizabeth Bennet, 20, good humoured, attractive, clearly
text: nobody's fool, walks through a field of tall meadow
text: grass. She is reading a novel entitled 'First
text: Impressions'. She approaches Longbourn, a fairly run down
text: 17th Century house with a small moat around it. Elizabeth
text: jumps up onto a wall and crosses the moat by walking a
text: wooden plank duck board, a reckless trick learnt in early
text: childhood. She walks passed the back of the house where,
text: through an open window to the library, we see her mother
dialog: and father, Mr and Mrs Bennet.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: My dear Mr Bennet, have you heard that
dialog: Netherfield Park is let at last?
text: We follow Elizabeth into the house, but still overhear
text: her parents' conversation.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you not want to know who has taken it?
speaker_heading: MR BENNET
dialog: As you wish to tell me, I doubt I have
dialog: any choice in the matter...

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
scene_heading: 3 INT. LONGBOURN - CONTINUOUS.
text: As Elizabeth walks through the hallway, we hear the sound
text: of piano scales plodding through the afternoon. She walks
text: down the entrance hall past the room where Mary, 18, the
text: bluestocking of the family, is practising, and finds
text: Kitty, 16, the second youngest, and Lydia, 15, the
text: precocious baby of the family, are listening at the door
dialog: to the library.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
speaker_heading: (TO ELIZABETH)
dialog: Have you heard? A Mr Bingley, a young man
dialog: from the North of England, has come down
text: on Monday in a chaise and four.
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: With five thousand a year!
dialog: Jane, (the eldest, most beautiful and most charmingly
text: naive of the girls), joins them at the door.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Goodness!
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: - and he's single to be sure!
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY - LONGBOURN - CONTINUOUS.
text: Mr Bennet is trying to ignore Mrs Bennet.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: What a fine thing for our girls!
speaker_heading: MR BENNET
dialog: Bow can it affect them?
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: My dear Mr Bennet, how can you be so
dialog: tiresome! You know that he must marry one
dialog: of them.
speaker_heading: MR BENNET
dialog: Oh, so that is his design in settling
dialog: here?
text: Mr Bennet takes a book from his table and walks out of
text: the library into the corridor where the girls are
dialog: gathered, Mrs Bennet following.
scene_heading: 4 INT. CORRIDOR - LONGBOURN - THE SAME.
text: Mr Bennet walks through the girls to the drawing room
text: pursued by Mrs Bennet.
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: - So you must go and visit him at once.
scene_heading: 5 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 5
text: Mr Bennet walks to the bookshelf to replace the book he
text: is carrying. Mary is there practising the piano. The
text: girls come in to listen.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Oh, yes, Papa.
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: Please, Papa!
speaker_heading: MR BENNET
dialog: There is no need, for I already have.
text: The piano stops. A frozen silence. They all stare.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: You have?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: when?
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: â¢ How can you tease me, Mr Bennet. You have
dialog: no compassion for my poor nerves?
speaker_heading: MR BENNET
dialog: You mistake me, my dear. I have a high
dialog: respect for them; they are my constant
dialog: companions these twenty years.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: Is he amiable?
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: Is he handsome?
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: He's sure to be handsome.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: (IRONICALLY)
dialog: With five thousand a year, it would not
dialog: matter if he had a big pink face.
speaker_heading: MR BENNET
dialog: I will give my hearty consent to his
dialog: marrying whichever of the girls he
dialog: chooses.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: So will he come to the ball tomorrow?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: MR BENNET
dialog: I believe so.
text: Lydia and Kitty shriek with excitement.
speaker_heading: KITTY
speaker_heading: (TO JANE)
dialog: I have to have your spotted muslin,
dialog: please!
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: I need it!
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: - if you do, I'll lend you my green
text: slippers.
text: Mr Bennet winks at Elizabeth and turns to Mary, a
text: serious, somewhat pedantic young woman.
speaker_heading: MR BENNET
dialog: And what do you say, Mary? Are you not
dialog: excited by the prospect of a ball?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Society has claims on us all, Papa. As
dialog: long as I have my mornings to myself, I
dialog: consider an interval of recreation and
dialog: â¢ amusement as quite desirable.
text: Elizabeth laughs.
scene_heading: 6 INT. ASSEMBLY ROOMS -- MERYTON VILLAGE - NIGHT.
text: The local subscription dance is in full swing. It's a
dialog: rough-and-ready, though enthusiastic affair...yeoman
text: farmers, small-time squires with their ruddy-cheeked
dialog: daughters.
text: Lydia and Kitty, with their mother, are fussing over
text: their clothes - straightening their dresses, tidying
dialog: their hair and so on.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: (fussing over her dress)
dialog: I literally can't breathe its so tight.
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: My toes hurt.
text: Elizabeth and Jane are a little apart from their family.
text: Jane looks breathtaking.
dialog: 0
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: â¢ Well, if every man in this room does not
text: end the evening completely in love with
dialog: you then I am no judge of beauty.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Or men.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Oh, they are far too easy to judge.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: They are not all bad.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Humourless poppycocks, in my limited
dialog: experience.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: One of these days, Lizzie, someone will
dialog: catch your eye and then you'll have to
dialog: watch your tongue.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: And eat my hat.
text: She stops speaking. And stares. A dazzling group enters
text: the room: George Bingley, 25, a good hearted soul but
dialog: â¢ prone to bumbling embarrassment when his enthusiasms get
text: the better of him, his sister Caroline, 23, a victim of
dialog: every latest fashion, counting herself superior to most
text: company she encounters, and finally, Mr Fitzwilliam
text: Darcy, 27, dashing, brooding with an introversion which
text: could be misconstrued as hauteur. They are dressed in the
text: highest fashion. Darcy surveys the hall. He catches
text: Elizabeth's eye. She stares, with a kind of surprised
text: shock. Jane notices and looks at Darcy. He turns away.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Luckily, you are not wearing a hat.
text: A hush falls as the local people turn to stare. The
text: newcomers - creatures from another world - make quite a
dialog: stir.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Caroline Bingley, standing next to Darcy, gazes at the
text: somewhat provincial gathering with distaste.
scene_heading: CAROLINE BINGLEY
dialog: We are a long way from Grosvenor Square,
dialog: are we not, Mr Darcy?
text: He does indeed look superior to the assembled company. On
text: the dance floor a young couple, staring at the newcomers,
text: trip over each other, stumble and burst out laughing.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
text: Mr Bingley spots Jane Bennet. For a moment he forgets
text: himself and openly looks at her.
speaker_heading: MR BINGLEY
dialog: I find it very charming.
scene_heading: CAROLINE BINGLEY
speaker_heading: (TO DARCY)
dialog: My brother is so easily pleased, is he
dialog: not?
text: Darcy does not answer.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: Elizabeth has found her great friend Charlotte Lucas - an
text: intelligent, sensible woman in her late twenties. They
text: spy through the crowd.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: So which of the painted peacocks is our
dialog: Mr Bingley?
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
text: He is on the right, and on the left is
dialog: his sister.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: And the person with the disagreeable
dialog: expression?
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: That is his good friend, Mr Darcy.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Poor soul.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: On the contrary, he has ten thousand a
dialog: year and owns half of Derbyshire.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: Sir William Lucas, 53 a hale but unsophisticated member
text: of the self-made gentry, takes it upon himself to
dialog: introduce Mr Bingley and Mr Darcy to his daughter
dialog: Charlotte and the Bennet family.
speaker_heading: SIR WILLIAM
dialog: (to Mr Bingley)
dialog: My eldest daughter you know, Mrs
dialog: Bennet ...miss Jane Bennet, Elizabeth and
dialog: Miss Mary Bennet.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: It is a pleasure. I have two others but
dialog: 40
text: they are already dancing.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: MR BINGLEY
dialog: Delighted to make your acquaintance.
dialog: Â¢
speaker_heading: SIR WILLIAM
dialog: And may I introduce Mr Darcy.
speaker_heading: (SIGNIFICANT LOOK)
dialog: -- of Pemberley, in Derbyshire!
text: A stiff bow from Darcy, Elizabeth smiles, Darcy does not.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Moments later. Elizabeth is standing in a small group
text: with Jane, Bingley, Miss Bingley and Darcy. Bingley can't
text: keep his eyes off Jane, but is frightfully at a loss in
text: disguising his instant ardour.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: How do you like it here in Hertfordshire,
dialog: Mr Bingley?
speaker_heading: MR BINGLEY
dialog: (smiling at Jane shyly)
dialog: Very much.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: The library at Netherfield, I've heard,
dialog: is one of the finest in the country.
dialog: Â¢
speaker_heading: MR BINGLEY
dialog: Yes, it fills me with guilt.
text: He looks at Jane a little blush starts around his collar.
speaker_heading: BINGLEY
dialog: Not a good reader, you see. I like being
dialog: out of doors. I mean, I can read, of
speaker_heading: COURSE -
text: His sister steps in. as the blush threatens to engulf his
dialog: ears.
speaker_heading: MISS BINGLEY
speaker_heading: (TO DARCY)
dialog: Your library at Pemberly, Mr Darcy, is
dialog: astonishingly good.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Thank you. It is the work of many
dialog: generations.
speaker_heading: MISS BINGLEY
dialog: And then you have added so much to it
dialog: yourself.
dialog: 0
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I wish I read more, but there always
dialog: seems so many other things to do.
speaker_heading: BINGLEY
dialog: That's exactly what I meant.
text: He beams at Jane.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Mr and Mrs Bennet stand a little apart from Elizabeth and
text: the other young people. Lydia and Kitty bound up to them
text: in a state of high excitement.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Mama! The regiment is arriving next week!
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: And will be here for the whole winter!
dialog: Mrs Forster told us!
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: They're going to be stationed in the
dialog: village!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Mr Bingley'turns to Jane.
speaker_heading: MR BINGLEY
dialog: May I have the honour?
text: They leave, to dance.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Do you dance Mr Darcy?
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Not if I can help it.
text: Elizabeth, Darcy and Miss Bingley stand in silence as
dialog: they over hear the following...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: officers! Lots of officers!
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: How will we meet them?
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: It's easy. You just walk up and down in
text: front of them and drop something.
text: Lydia pantomimes the actions for Kitty.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: â¢ They pick it up. You say 'oh thank you
dialog: sir' and blush prettily and then you're
dialog: introduced!
speaker_heading: MR BENNET
dialog: I have long suspected that we have two of
dialog: the silliest girls in the county.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: Oh Mr Bennet! I remember the time when I
dialog: liked a red coat myself, and if a smart
dialog: young colonel with six thousand a year
dialog: should want one of my girls I shall not
dialog: say nay to him.
text: Mr Darcy overhears this. Profoundly embarrassed, Lizzie
text: moves away.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The dance floor. Mr Bingley is dancing with Jane. His
text: ears blushing with thrilled embarrassment. Mrs Bennet,
text: with a group of other mothers, watches the young couple
text: with rather too obvious satisfaction.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: 7 That dress becomes her, does it not. 7
dialog: â¢ Though of course my Jane needs little
text: help from couturiers.
text: Elizabeth wanders through the throng. She looks at
text: Bingley and Jane ending the dance - she is coy and
text: demure, he clearly smitten -
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Darcy is joined by Bingley exhilarated by the dance.
speaker_heading: BINGLEY
dialog: Come Darcy, I must have you dance. I hate
dialog: to see you standing by yourself in this
dialog: stupid manner.
speaker_heading: MR DARCY
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: You know how I detest it.
speaker_heading: MR BINGLEY
dialog: Upon my word, I've never seen so many
dialog: pretty girls in my life.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: You are dancing with the only handsome
text: girl in the room.
dialog: Â¢
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: BINGLEY
dialog: Oh, she is the most beautiful creature I
dialog: ever beheld, but her sister Elizabeth is
dialog: very agreeable.
text: They have stopped at the edge of the dance floor and have
text: not seen Elizabeth and charlotte who are standing close
text: behind them. Elizabeth smirks as she overhears their
dialog: conversation.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Perfectly tolerable, I dare say, but not
dialog: handsome enough to tempt me.
text: Elizabeth's smile drops.
speaker_heading: DARCY (CONT'D)
dialog: You had better return to your partner and
dialog: enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting
dialog: your time with me.
text: Bingley goes off.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Elizabeth and Charlotte, who have overheard Darcy and
dialog: Bingley's exchange.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Ignore him, Lizzie, he is such a
dialog: disagreeable man it would be a misfortune
dialog: to be liked by him.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Don't worry. I would not dance with him
dialog: for half of Derbyshire.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Later. Bingley politely dancing with Charlotte. As he
text: does so, he catches sight of Jane dancing with somebody
text: else. A look of pure longing, but he cannot dance every
text: dance with her. Lizzie too is dancing and clocks this.
text: Lydia and Kitty are exuberantly dancing too, laughing and
text: chatting. Darcy stands watching, a look of infinitely
text: superior boredom on his fine features.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Bingley is standing with Jane, Elizabeth, Mrs Bennet and
dialog: Darcy.
speaker_heading: BINGLEY
speaker_heading: (TO LIZZIE)
dialog: Your friend Miss Lucas is a most amusing
text: young woman.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: â¢ Yes! I adore her.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
text: It is a pity she is not more handsome.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Mama!
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: But Lizzie will never admit she is plain.
speaker_heading: (TO BINGLEY)
dialog: Of course it's my Jane who's considered
dialog: the beauty of the county.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh, Mama, please!
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: When she was only fifteen there was a
dialog: gentleman so much in love with her that I
dialog: was sure he would make her an offer.
dialog: However, he did write her some very
dialog: pretty verses.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: (IMPATIENTLY)
dialog: And so ended their affection. I wonder
dialog: â¢ who first discovered the power of poetry
dialog: in driving away love?
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I thought that poetry was the food of
dialog: love.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Of a fine, stout love it may. Everything
dialog: nourishes what is strong already. But if
text: it is only a thin, slight sort of
dialog: inclination, I'm convinced that one good
dialog: sonnet will starve it away entirely.
text: Darcy looks at Elizabeth with surprise. A glimmering of
dialog: interest.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: So what do you recommend, to encourage
dialog: affection?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Oh dancing, of course. Even if ones
text: partner is barely tolerable.
text: She gives him a dazzling smile. Darcy looks startled. He
text: has no idea she heard him. He blushes.
dialog: Â¢
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
text: Elizabeth is dancing happily in a round, Jane and Bingley
text: â¢ are also in the same dance. At the edge of the dance
text: floor Darcy is watching.
scene_heading: 7 INT. BEDROOM -- LONGBOURN - NIGHT. 7
text: Elizabeth and Jane are both tucked up in the same bed,
text: but are too excited to sleep.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Mr Bingley is just what a young man ought
dialog: to be. Sensible, good humoured -
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (completing the list)
dialog: Handsome, conveniently rich -
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You know perfectly well I do not believe
dialog: marriage should be driven by thoughts of
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I agree entirely, only the deepest love
dialog: will persuade me into matrimony, which is
dialog: why I will end up an old maid.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Do you really believe he liked me,
dialog: Lizzie?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Jane, he danced with you most of the
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I was flattered, I must admit. I did not
dialog: expect such a compliment.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: That is one great difference between us.
dialog: Compliments always take you by surprise.
dialog: Well, Mr Bingley is certainly very
dialog: amiable, and I give you leave to like
dialog: him. You've liked many a stupider person.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Lizzie!
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You're a great deal too apt to like
dialog: people in general, you know. All the
dialog: world is good and agreeable in your eyes.
dialog: 0
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: Â¢ JANE
dialog: Not his friend. I still cannot believe
dialog: what he said about you.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Mr Darcy? I could more easily forgive
dialog: his vanity had he not wounded mine. But
dialog: no matter. I doubt we shall ever speak
dialog: again.
text: She blows out the candle.
scene_heading: 8 INT. BREAKFAST ROOM - LONGBOURN - DAY. 8
text: Mrs Bennet presides over breakfast with an endless
text: description of the ball. Mary is doing some needle work,
text: whilst Lydia, Kitty and Jane blearily eat.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: And then he danced the third with Miss
dialog: Lucas. Poor thing, it is a shame she is
text: not more handsome. The fourth with a Miss
dialog: King of little standing. And the fifth
dialog: again with Jane.
speaker_heading: MR BENNET
dialog: â¢ If he'd had any compassion for me he
dialog: would have sprained his ankle in the
dialog: first dance.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: Oh, Mr Bennet! Anybody would think the
dialog: girls looked forward to a grand
dialog: inheritance.
text: Elizabeth rolls her eyes at Mr Bennet, they've heard this
dialog: speech many times before.
speaker_heading: MR BENNET
speaker_heading: (NOT LISTENING)
dialog: Kitty, be so kind as to pass the butter.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: As you well know, Mr Bennet, when you
dialog: die, which may in fact be very soon, our
dialog: girls will be left without a roof over
dialog: their head nor a penny to their name.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Oh Mother, please! It's ten in the

speaker_heading: MRS HILL

text: Mrs Hill gives the letter to Jane.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET (CONT'D)
dialog: Make haste, Jane, make haste. 0 happy
dialog: day!
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: It is from Miss Bingley.
text: Mrs Bennet is stopped in her tracks.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: She has invited me to dine with her.
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
text: Her brother will be dining out.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: This is most unfortunate.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: I didn't think he was so good looking
dialog: anyway.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Can I take the carriage?
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: Certainly not my dear, you will go to
text: Netherfield on horse back.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Horseback?!
text: Mrs Bennet leaves with a secret smile on her lips.
scene_heading: 9 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY. 9

scene_heading: 12 EXT. GARDEN - DAY. 12

speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: Excellent. Now she will have to stay the

speaker_heading: MR BENNET
dialog: Good grief, woman. Your skills in the art
dialog: of match-making are without question.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Though I don't think, mama, you can
dialog: reasonably take credit for making it

dialog: returning home until I am better -- but do
dialog: not be alarmed excepting a sore throat, a.
dialog: fever, and a headache there is nothing
dialog: wrong with me." This is ridiculous.
speaker_heading: MR BENNET
dialog: Well, my dear, if your daughter does die
dialog: it will be a comfort to know it was all
text: in pursuit of Mr Bingley.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: People do not die of colds.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Though she might well perish with the

text: Mr Bennet laughs.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I am going to Netherfield at once.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: Nonsense, the horse is with Jane. And the
dialog: girls took the carriage to town.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Then I will walk there. We should not
text: leave Jane alone in her condition.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: Walk! You will not be fit to be seen by
dialog: the time you get there.
speaker_heading: MR BENNET
dialog: Why the devil not. We could have them all

dialog: are eating breakfast.
dialog: 
dialog:

text: â¢ newspaper; Caroline Bingley is reading a letter.
scene_heading: CAROLINE BINGLEY
dialog: (puts down the letter)
text: Apparently, Lady Bathurst is redecorating
text: her ballroom in the French style. A

speaker_heading: FOOTMAN
dialog: Miss Elizabeth Bennet.
text: Lizzie comes in, her face flushed, her skirt covered in

speaker_heading: BINGLEY
dialog: I thought she showed remarkable spirit

scene_heading: CAROLINE BINGLEY
dialog: The eldest Miss Bennet, as you know, I

scene_heading: CAROLINE BINGLEY
dialog: You write uncommonly fast, Mr Darcy.
speaker_heading: MR DARCY
dialog: (without looking up)
dialog: â¢ You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.
text: Caroline Bingley lingers, annoyingly.
scene_heading: CAROLINE BINGLEY
dialog: How many letters you must have occasion
dialog: to write, Mr Darcy. Letters of business

speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: It is fortunate, then, that they fall to

scene_heading: CAROLINE BINGLEY
dialog: Please tell your sister that I long to

speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I have already told her once, by your

speaker_heading: DARCY

scene_heading: CAROLINE BINGLEY
dialog: What do you mean, Charles?
speaker_heading: MR BINGLEY
text: They all paint tables, and embroider

speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: The word is indeed applied too liberally.
dialog: I cannot boast of knowing more than half

dialog: that are truely accomplished.
scene_heading: â¢ CAROLINE BINGLEY
dialog: Nor I, to be sure!
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Goodness! You must comprehend a great
dialog: deal in the idea.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I do.
scene_heading: CAROLINE BINGLEY
dialog: Absolutely. She must have a thorough
dialog: knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
dialog: dancing and the modern languages, to
dialog: deserve the word. And something in her
dialog: air and manner of walking.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: And of course she must improve her mind

speaker_heading: CAROLINE BINGLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: It's refreshing, is it not, after sitting
dialog: so long in one attitude?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: And it's a small kind of accomplishment,
dialog: I suppose.
text: Darcy meets Lizzie's eye, briefly. He goes back to his
text: letter-writing. More walking up and down. Caroline
text: Bingley turns to Darcy.
scene_heading: CAROLINE BINGLEY
dialog: Mr Darcy, will you join us?
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: You can only have two motives, Miss
dialog: Bingley, and I would interfere with
dialog: either.
scene_heading: CAROLINE BINGLEY
dialog: (to Lizzie, archly)
dialog: What can he mean?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Our surest way of disappointing him will
dialog: be to ask nothing about it.
scene_heading: CAROLINE BINGLEY
speaker_heading: (TO DARCY)
dialog: Please tell us!
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Either you are in each other's confidence
dialog: and have secret affairs to discuss, or
dialog: you are conscious that your figures
dialog: appear to the greatest advantage by
dialog: walking. If the first, I should get in
dialog: your way. If the second, I can admire you

scene_heading: CAROLINE BINGLEY
dialog: Oh no, Mr Darcy is not to be laughed at!
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Are you too proud, Mr Darcy? And would
dialog: you consider that a fault?
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: That I couldn't say.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: For we're trying to find a fault in you.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Maybe it's that I find it hard to forgive
dialog: the follies and vices of others, or their
dialog: offences against myself. My good opinion,
text: once lost, is lost forever.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: â¢ Oh dear, I cannot tease you about that.

dialog: to stay here, Mr Bingley.
speaker_heading: BINGLEY
dialog: Absolutely I find the country very
dialog: diverting. Don't you agree, Darcy?
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I find it perfectly adequate even if
dialog: society is a little less varied than in
dialog: town.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: But I assure you there is quite as much
dialog: going on in the country as there is in
dialog: the town.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Indeed Mania, I think Mr Darcy merely

speaker_heading: BINGLEY
dialog: When your sister has recovered you shall

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I think a Ball is a perfectly irrational

scene_heading: CAROLINE BINGLEY
dialog: Indeed much more rational but rather less

speaker_heading: MR COLLINS

dialog: counter.
scene_heading: 42 EXT. MILLINER'S SHOP - DAY. 42
text: The girls emerge from the shop with Wickham.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You're too generous.
speaker_heading: WICKHAM
dialog: I know. Fivepence halfpenny!
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: It all adds up.
speaker_heading: Â¢ LYDIA
dialog: I'll pay him back.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: WICKHAM
dialog: Oh yes. I'll make sure of that.
dialog: Â¢
text: They laugh. Elizabeth is really rather taken with him.
text: They walk down the street.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Will you be stationed here all winter, Mr
dialog: Wickham?
speaker_heading: WICKHAM
dialog: That depends on what the French have in
dialog: mind. Of course I look forward to
dialog: action...
dialog: (smiles at her)
dialog: But on the other hand
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Lizzie - look!
text: They stop. Jane's face lights up.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Mr Bingley !
text: It is indeed Bingley, riding towards them. He is
text: accompanied by Darcy.
text: â¢ Bingley jumps off his horse and hurries over to Jane. His
text: open, friendly face is filled with delight.
speaker_heading: BINGLEY
dialog: I was on my way to your house.
speaker_heading: LYDIA -
dialog: Please Mr Bingley, when are you going to
dialog: give a ball?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Lydia!
speaker_heading: BINGLEY
dialog: I was just waiting until your sister was
dialog: quite well.-
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: She is!
dialog: Elizabeth pays no attention to the following
text: conversation, instead she is looking at Darcy who, in
text: turn, is staring at Wickham. They both obviously
text: recognize each other and look very uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: - when, then?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: MR BINGLEY
dialog: Â¢
text: As soon as they have made the white soup.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Be sure to invite Mr Wickham.
text: Darcy turns and rides off without a word.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Lydia, you can't just say that -
speaker_heading: MR BINGLEY
dialog: Will you excuse me ladies? Mr Wickham.
dialog: Enjoy the day.
text: Elizabeth looks at Wickham, puzzled.
scene_heading: 43 INT. DRAWING ROOM - THE LUCAS' HOUSE - DAY. 43
text: A small cards party is underway. Three tables have been
text: set up. Elizabeth, Wickham, Jane, Lydia, Kitty, Charlotte
text: and Sir William and Lady Lucas are present. A small
dialog: number of officers and other ladies are also present. We
text: move around the tables. Kitty is sat with Sir William and
text: Charlotte and Mary. Jane sits at a table with Mr Collins
text: and Lady Lucas. Lizzie sits with Lydia and two other
text: officers. Lydia flirts outrageously.
dialog: Â¢
speaker_heading: LYDIA.
dialog: We have asked mama if we might have new
text: dresses for the Netherfield ball.
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: Yes, white, they must be white.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: White is the only colour to be worn this
dialog: season.
speaker_heading: SIR WILLIAM
dialog: So I believe.
text: Mr Collins is at a table with Lady Lucas, he glances over
text: at Elizabeth, as he talks.
speaker_heading: COLLINS
dialog: - of course, when you understand that
dialog: Lady Catherine de Bourgh is its
dialog: proprietor you will realise what an
dialog: immense compliment that is. Lady
dialog: Catherine spent eight hundred pounds on a
text: chimney-piece alone.
text: â¢ Wickham who has been talking to some of the other
text: officers comes and sits beside Elizabeth, passing by Mr
text: collins on the way.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: WICKHAM
dialog: (aside to Elizabeth)
dialog: Your cousin is blessed with an uncommon
dialog: capacity for charm.
text: Elizabeth laughs and plays a hand.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Will you be attending the Netherfield
dialog: ball, Mr Wickham?
speaker_heading: WICKHAM
dialog: I hope to.
speaker_heading: (TO ELIZABETH)
dialog: How long has Mr Darcy been a guest a
dialog: Netherfield?
text: Elizabeth pounces on this reference to Mr Darcy and takes
dialog: her chance.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: About a month. Are you acquainted with,
dialog: Mr Darcy?
speaker_heading: WICKHAM
dialog: Indeed, my fate has been very intimate
dialog: with that gentleman. I have been
dialog: connected with his family since infancy.
text: Elizabeth is genuinely surprised, there is a pause while
text: she is forced to play her hand.
speaker_heading: WICKHAM (CONT'D)
dialog: You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet,
dialog: especially given the cold manner of our
dialog: intimacy this afternoon. Are you well
dialog: acquainted with that gentleman?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: As much as I could ever wish to be. I
dialog: have spent four days in the same house as
dialog: him, and I think him very disagreeable.
speaker_heading: WICKHAM
dialog: I cannot pretend to be sorry.
text: Elizabeth blushes.
speaker_heading: WICKHAM
dialog: But really I speak out of turn.
text: Collins voice breaks the moment.
speaker_heading: COLLINS
dialog: Miss Elizabeth, I was just saying to Sir
dialog: William what appalling weather we've been
dialog: having.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 37.
text: Elizabeth cannot believe her misfortune in Mr Collins,
text: â¢ but she smiles politely.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I think I shall take a little air.
text: She rises and walks through the room towards a balcony.
text: As she passes the other tables we follow and witness
text: snippets of their conversations.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
speaker_heading: (TO MARY)
text: It seems Mr Wickham has met with
dialog: universal approval. Though Lizzie looks
text: singularly pleased with him.
speaker_heading: MARY
text: At the moment she has more suitors than
dialog: sense.
text: Charlotte looks over at Mr Collins. Elizabeth passes Sir
text: William's side of the table.
speaker_heading: SIR WILLIAM
dialog: Now any one for a round of bridge?
dialog: Elizabeth?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Â¢
dialog: Really I need to take some air.
text: Mr Collins makes his way to join Elizabeth.
speaker_heading: SIR WILLIAM
dialog: Mr Collins?
speaker_heading: COLLINS
dialog: Oh, I am not so familiar with the game,
dialog: Sir William.
speaker_heading: SIR WILLIAM
dialog: Absolute nonsense. I insist that you join
dialog: us.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Please, Mr Collins, I'd be happy if you'd
speaker_heading: PARTNER ME_
text: Collins resigns himself to his fate. Elizabeth smiles and
text: slips out into the night air.
scene_heading: 44 EXT. BALCONY - THE LUCASES HOUSE - MERYTON - NIGHT. 44
text: Elizabeth breathes in the cold night air. She senses
text: someone join her. She looks round to see Wickham has
text: followed her as she had hoped.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: â¢ I hope your plans in favor of Meryton
dialog: will not be affected by your difficult
dialog: relations with the gentleman we were just
dialog: speaking of.
speaker_heading: WICKHAM
dialog: Oh no - it is not for me to be driven
dialog: away. If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he
dialog: must go not I.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I must ask you Mr Wickham, what is the
dialog: manner of your disapproval of Mr Darcy?
speaker_heading: WICKHAM
dialog: Do you really want to hear?
text: Lizzie nods.
speaker_heading: WICKHAM
dialog: He ruined me.
text: She stares at him.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: How so?
speaker_heading: WICKHAM
dialog: My father managed his estate. We grew up
dialog: together, Darcy and I. His father treated
dialog: me like a second son. Oh he was the
dialog: kindest of men and bequeathed me the best
dialog: living in his gift, for I had my heart
text: set on joining the church. But when he
dialog: died Darcy ignored his wishes and gave
text: the living to another man.
speaker_heading: LIZZIE
dialog: Why did he do that?
speaker_heading: WICKHAM
dialog: Out of jealousy, for his father loved me
dialog: more than he loved him.
speaker_heading: LIZZIE
dialog: How cruel! Are you sure?
speaker_heading: WICKHAM
speaker_heading: (NODS)
dialog: And out of pride, for he considered me
dialog: too lowly to be worth his consideration.
dialog: Â¢
text: Pause. Lizzie gazes at him with horror and sympathy.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 39.
scene_heading: â¢ 45 INT. BEDROOMS - LONGBOURNE - THE SAME. 45
text: We pan through the bedrooms as the Bennet girls prepare
text: for the Netherfield ball. Kitty is helping Lydia into her
text: dress, they are both wearing white.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Aggghh!
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: Breathe in!
text: We move to the quieter preparations of Jane and
dialog: Elizabeth. This conversation has been going on for some
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: JANE
speaker_heading: (HORRIFIED)
dialog: - I still think there must have been a
dialog: misunderstanding.
speaker_heading: LIZZIE
speaker_heading: (EXASPERATED LAUGH)
dialog: Oh Jane, do you never think ill of
dialog: anybody?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: 0 How could Mr Darcy do such a thing? I
dialog: will discover the truth from Mr Bingley
dialog: at the ball this evening.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: If it is not true let Mr Darcy contradict
dialog: it himself. But until he does, I hope
dialog: never to encounter him.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Poor, unfortunate Mr Wickham.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: On the contrary, he is twice the man
dialog: Darcy is.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: And lets hope for you a rather more
dialog: willing dancer.
text: Jane leaves Elizabeth, at the mirror, taking very
text: particular care of her makeup. she smil6s to herself.
scene_heading: 46 INT. NETHERFIELD - HERTFORDSHIRE - NIGHT. 46
text: â¢ The great doors of Netherfield open to reveal the ball in
text: full swing. Compared to the somewhat clod-hopping
text: Assembly, its a dazzling affair.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 40.
text: There are hundreds of guests. All the women, roughly two
text: hundred, are dressed in white. The men are either in red
text: â¢ officer uniform or dressed in black and white. There are
text: a number of rooms each occupied by a different activity,
text: cards, buffet, women's closet. The final and grandest
text: room is the ball room, a swirl of elegant dance.
text: The Bennet's enter the first reception room, the girls,
text: including Mrs Bennet, are all dressed in white. Mr
text: Collins is slightly detained as people pass. Mr Bingley
text: bounds up to Jane.
speaker_heading: BINGLEY
dialog: You're here! I'm so pleased.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: And so am I.
speaker_heading: BINGLEY
dialog: How are you, Miss Elizabeth?
text: Elizabeth is not paying attention, instead she is
text: searching over Mr Bingleys' shoulder for a sight of
dialog: Wickham.
speaker_heading: BINGLEY
dialog: Are you, looking for someone?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: â¢ No, no not at all. Admiring the splendor
dialog: of the ball.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: It is lovely, Mr Bingley.
text: Bingley and Jane move off leaving Elizabeth with Mrs
text: Bennet and others. While Mrs Bennet talks we focus on
text: Elizabeth searching the sea of red coats.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: (refering to Jane and
speaker_heading: BINGLEY)
dialog: I dare say I have never met a more
dialog: pleasant gentleman in all my years. Look
dialog: how he dotes on her! Still Jane has
dialog: always done what is best for her family.
text: Elizabeth takes this opportunity to slip away into the
text: next room. Elizabeth looks around but cannot see Mr
text: Wickham. Suddenly she thinks she sees him, so starts to
text: a r, move over. The man turns round, it is not Wickham but
text: someone else.
text: Elizabeth walks nonchanantly into the next room, again
text: looking for Mr Wickham. She cranes around trying to see
text: â¢ him then she is suddenly surprised by Charlotte Lucas.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Â¢
dialog: Have you seen Mr Wickham.
text: She shakes her head.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
text: Perhaps he is in the ballroom.
text: They both walk into the ball room. We pull back to reveal
text: a sea of dancers. Wickham is nowhere to be seen. Jane
text: appears and catches Elizabeths arm.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: He's not here. Apparently otherwise
dialog: detained.
text: The disappointment is palpable on Elizabeth's face.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Detained?
text: Mr Collins arrives, breathless. He smiles eagerly at
dialog: Elizabeth.
speaker_heading: COLLINS
dialog: There you are.
speaker_heading: Â¢ ELIZABETH
dialog: Mr Collins. What a pleasant surprise.
speaker_heading: MR COLLINS
dialog: Perhaps you will do me the honour, Miss
dialog: Elizabeth?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Oh. I didn't think you danced, Mr
dialog: Collins.
speaker_heading: MR COLLINS
dialog: I do not consider it incompatible with
dialog: the office of a clergyman to indulge in
dialog: such an innocent diversion.
text: Elizabeth tries to smile, politely.
speaker_heading: MR COLLINS (CONT'D)
dialog: In fact several people, her ladyship
dialog: included, have complimented me on my
text: lightness of foot.
text: Elizabeth's face is a matey rictus.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: â¢ They dance, the style of which is not unlike English
dialog: Country dancing.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: COLLINS
dialog: â¢ To be sure, dancing is of little
dialog: consequence to me, but it does afford the
dialog: opportunity to lavish'ones partner with
dialog: delicate attentions which is my primary
dialog: object of the evening.
text: Elizabeth turns as part of the dance and for a moment she
text: dances beside Jane.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Apparently Your Mr Wickham has been
dialog: called on some business to town, though
dialog: my informer told me he would have been
dialog: less inclined to be engaged had it not
dialog: been for the presence at Netherfield of a
dialog: certain gentleman.
text: Jane indicates towards where Darcy stands watching them.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: That gentleman barely warrants the name.
text: The dance leads Elizabeth back to Mr Collins.
speaker_heading: COLLINS (CONT`D)
dialog: It is my intention, if I may be so bold
dialog: to remain close to you throughout the
dialog: evening.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Couples are preparing for the next dance. Elizabeth and
text: Charlotte are standing to one side when Mr Darcy
text: approaches.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: May I have the next dance, Miss
dialog: Elizabeth.
text: Elizabeth is stunned.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You may.
text: Darcy walks away.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: What was I thinking? Have I no presence
dialog: of mind?l
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: I dare say you will find him very
dialog: agreeable, Lizzie.
dialog: 0
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: Â¢ ELIZABETH
dialog: Heaven forbid! That would be the greatest
dialog: misfortune of all - to find a man
dialog: agreeable whom one is determined to hate!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Elizabeth dances face to face with Darcy. Neither can
text: speak. They dance for a moment in silence.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I do love a Sarabande.
speaker_heading: DARCY
text: Indeed. Most invigorating.
text: They continue, for a moment, in silence.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: It is your turn to say something, Mr
dialog: Darcy - I talked about the dance, now you
dialog: ought to remark on the size of the room
dialog: or the number of couples.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I am perfectly happy to oblige, please
dialog: advise me of what you would like most to
dialog: â¢ hear.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: That reply will do for the present.
dialog: Perhaps by and bye I may observe that
dialog: private balls are much pleasanter than
dialog: public ones. But for now we may be
dialog: silent.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Do you talk as a rule while dancing?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: We are each of an unsocial, taciturn
dialog: disposition, unwilling to speak, unless
dialog: we expect to say something that will -
dialog: amaze the whole room, and be handed down
dialog: to posterity with all the eclat of a
dialog: proverb. So a little lubrication to avoid
dialog: embarrassment might be advantageous.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I see no striking resemblance of your own
dialog: character in this, how near it is to mine
dialog: I cannot say. (beat) Tell me do you and
dialog: your sisters very often walk to Meryton?
dialog: Â¢
text: They are suddenly parted by the choreography of the
dialog: dance.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 44.
text: We stay with Elizabeth who is whisked round the floor by
text: an elderly man who smiles at her toothlessly, Elizabeth
text: â¢ looks back at Darcy who is dancing with Lydia. He stare
text: at Elizabeth as he dances. Elizabeth smiles at her
dialog: current partner in embarrassment.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Very mild weather we've been having.
speaker_heading: DANCING PARTNER
dialog: (deaf as a post)
dialog: Sorry.
text: The dance spins again and she is back with Darcy.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Yes, we often walk to Meryton - it is a
dialog: great opportunity to meet new people. In
dialog: fact when you met us we had just had the
dialog: pleasure of forming a new acquaintance.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I will admit your Mr Wickham is blessed
dialog: with such happy manners as may ensure his
dialog: making friends - whether he is capable of
dialog: retaining them is less certain.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: He has been so unlucky as to lose your
dialog: friendship. I remember hearing you once
dialog: say that your resentment once created was
dialog: unappeasable. You are very cautious, I
dialog: suppose, as to its being created?
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I am. May I ask to what these questions
dialog: tend.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: To make out your character, Mr Darcy.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: And what have you discovered?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: very little.
text: The dancefinishes.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: I hear such different accounts of you as
dialog: puzzle me exceedingly.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I hope to afford you more clarity in the
dialog: â¢ future.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 45.
text: â¢ They bow to each other and Elizabeth moves quickly away
dialog: from Darcy.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Elizabeth is at the buffet watching Kitty quaff a huge
text: glass of wine and having the glass immediately refilled.
text: She is joined by Caroline Bingley who also looks at Kitty
text: disapprovingly.
scene_heading: CAROLINE BINGLEY
dialog: Miss Elizabeth. Let me recommend you as a
dialog: friend not to give too much confidence to
dialog: all of the assertions your friend Mr
dialog: Wickham might make. He is indeed a
dialog: charming man, but one should never forget
text: from where he is descended.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: His lack of trustworthiness and descent
dialog: appear by your account to be the same
dialog: thing,
scene_heading: CAROLINE BINGLEY
dialog: Please excuse my interterence, it was
dialog: kindly meant.
text: â¢ A breathless Mr Collins appears.
speaker_heading: COLLINS
dialog: Is that Mr Darcy, of Pemberley in
dialog: Derbyshire?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I believe so.
speaker_heading: COLLINS
dialog: But I must make myself known to him
dialog: immediately!
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: But sir -
speaker_heading: COLLINS
dialog: He is the nephew of my esteemed
dialog: patroness, Lady Catherine.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: (SURPRISED)
dialog: He is?
text: Mr Collins starts making his way determinedly towards
dialog: Darcy.
speaker_heading: Â¢ ELIZABETH
dialog: Please, Mr Collins! He'll consider it an
speaker_heading: IMPERTINENCE --
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 46.
text: Elizabeth watches from a distance, with acute
text: embarrassment, as Collins interrupts Darcy. Darcy does
text: not notice him so Collins raises his voice.
speaker_heading: COLLINS (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr Darcy!
text: The room around him stops. Darcy is surprised and turns
text: round. In dumbshow we see Darcy is horrified by Collins'
text: obsequiousness, during the conversation Collins points
dialog: Elizabeth out to Darcy.
scene_heading: CAROLINE BINGLEY
dialog: What interesting relatives you have, Miss
dialog: Bennet.
text: Elizabeth walks away into another room.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The other room, where Mary is singing badly at the piano.
text: Elizabeth is horrified. She turns to leave only to see Mr
text: Bennet looking on. He winces as Mary misses a high note.
text: Mary finishes the song with an off key flourish. Polite
text: applause. Mary smiles and prepares for another song.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Aren't you going to do something?
dialog: Â¢
text: Mr Bennet walks over to the piano.
speaker_heading: MR BENNET
dialog: Mary dear, you've delighted us long
dialog: enough.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: But they asked for another song.
text: Mr Bennet shuts the lid.
speaker_heading: MR BENNET
text: Let the other young ladies have a turn.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Later. Charlotte and Lizzie are sat together.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Perhaps my family have made a competition
dialog: to see who can expose themselves to the
dialog: most ridicule.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
text: Well, at least Bingley has not noticed.
dialog: Â¢
text: They look over and see Jane and Bingley dancing. Bingley
text: clearly besotted by Jane.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: â¢ Yes. I think he likes her very much.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: But does she like him? There are few of
dialog: us who are secure enough to be really in
dialog: love without proper encouragement.
dialog: Bingley likes her enormously but might
dialog: not do more if she does not help him on.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: She is just shy and modest. If he does
dialog: not perceive her regard he is a fool.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: We are all fools in love. He does not
dialog: know her character as we do. She should
dialog: move fast. Snap him up. There is plenty
dialog: of time for us to get to know them after
dialog: we're married -
text: Elizabeth looks over the dancefloor to see Lydia dancing
text: with a soldier. she's a little drunk, and very
text: flirtatious. He says something; she shrieks with
dialog: laughter.
speaker_heading: CUT TO;
scene_heading: 47 MONTAGE OF THE BALL 47
text: Elizabeth sits at the side of the dance-floor. She looks
text: at Mrs Bennet dancing in outrageous fashion. Cut to
text: later: Lydia is getting more and more leery with a group
text: of soldiers, Elizabeth walks away in embarrasment only to
text: see Mr Collins smiling at her from across the room. Cut
text: to: Elizabeth dancing joylessly with the excruciating Mr
text: Collins, as she turns in the dance she sees Darcy look on
text: with obvious disdain. Cut to: much later, the band are
text: exhausted, guests are leaving. The staff are asleep on
text: their feet. Elizabeth almost alone watching her parents
text: dancing almost the only people left on the dance floor,

scene_heading: 48 INT. ENTRANCE HALL-- NETHERFIELD - THE WEE HOURS 48
text: Day light creeps through the curtains. Mrs Bennet is
text: sprawled on a sofa. Lydia completely drunk. Kitty asleep.
text: Jane sitting demurely. Collins looking longingly at
text: Elizabeth. Mrs Bennet is holding court, whilst the
text: footmen behind are literally ready to drop. Bingley is
text: standing, the perfect host, but obviously willing the
dialog: â¢ Bennets to leave.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: I have never had such a good time in my
dialog: life. Mr Bingley you must have such a
dialog: ball once a month at least.
text: Caroline who is standing with her brother, yawns
dialog: ostentatiously.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Mother. I really think it is time to go.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: Don't be impertinent. our hosts are
dialog: perfectly happy with our company, are you
dialog: not, Mr Bingley? I hope I can entice you
dialog: to Longbourn to sample our hospitality.
dialog: We would make sure you had 3 or 4 courses
dialog: at least.
text: She holds out her glass for a top up and carries on.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET (CONT'D)
dialog: So tell me Mr Bingley. Whom did you like
dialog: least of all your guests this evening?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Really. This is enough.

scene_heading: 49 INT. CARRIAGE - HERTFORDSHIRE - MORNING. 49
text: The Bennet's are squeezed into their carriage. It is

speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: Allowing for new carriages, dresses
dialog: etcetera, etcetera. We will be having a

speaker_heading: is MR COLLINS
dialog: Mrs Bennet I was hoping, if it would
dialog: not trouble you, that I might solicit a
dialog: private audience with Miss Elizabeth in
text: the course of the morning.
text: Elizabeth is open mouthed.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: Oh! Yes. Certainly - Lizzy would be very
dialog: happy indeed. Please -- go ahead. No time
dialog: like the present. Everyone. Out. Mr
dialog: Collins would like a private audience
dialog: with your sister.
text: Everyone looks in amazement.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Wait. I beg you. Mr Collins can have
dialog: nothing to say to me.that anybody need
dialog: not hear.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: No. Nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you-will
dialog: stay where you are. Everyone else, to the
dialog: drawing room. Mr Bennet.
speaker_heading: â¢ MR BENNET
dialog: But...
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: Now!
text: Mrs Bennet makes sure everyone leaves, winks at Mr
text: Collins then shuts the door before Elizabeth has time to
text: do anything. Elizabeth looks at Mr Collins who looks at
text: her in earnest. There is a horrible pause of intense
dialog: embarrassment.
speaker_heading: MR COLLINS
dialog: Dear Miss Elizabeth, you can hardly doubt
dialog: the purpose of my discourse. My
dialog: attentions have been too marked to be
dialog: mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the
dialog: house I singled you out as the companion
dialog: of my future life.
text: Elizabeth stares at him, astonished.
speaker_heading: MR COLLINS
dialog: But before I am run away with my feelings
dialog: perhaps I may state my reasons for
dialog: marrying. Firstly, that it is the duty of

speaker_heading: MRS BENNET (V.0.)

speaker_heading: MR COLLINS
dialog: My object in coming to Longbourn was to

dialog: next in the entail of the estate and such

dialog: this.
dialog: (drops to his knee)
dialog: And now nothing remains for me but to

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Mr Collins -
speaker_heading: MR COLLINS

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH

dialog: Mr Collins -
speaker_heading: MR COLLINS
dialog: So I must conclude that you simply seek

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Sir! I am not the sort of female to

speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: Yes, or I shall never see her again?
speaker_heading: MR BENNET
dialog: Well, Lizzie. From this day on you must

speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
speaker_heading: (TO LIZZIE)
dialog: - who will maintain you when your father

dialog: speaks to anyone who will listen.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: Oh, ungrateful child! I shall never speak
dialog: to her again! Not that I have much

dialog: who suffer as I do from nervous
dialog: complaints can have no inclination for
dialog: talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer...
text: She jabbers on but her voice fades. We're with Jane, re-
text: reading the letter.

text: Jane passes Elizabeth the letter.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: "Mr Darcy is impatient to see his sister

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH

text: Jane's carriage moves away and the family wave. Mr Bennet
text: talks to Elizabeth.
speaker_heading: MR BENNET
dialog: Poor Jane. However, a girl likes to be

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: (DRYLY)
dialog: I'm sure that will cheer her up,Papa.
speaker_heading: MR BENNET
dialog: It's your turn now, Lizzie. Since you've

dialog: Wickham? He is a pleasant fellow and
dialog: would do the job credibly.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Thank you, but a less agreeable man would
dialog: satisfy me. We must not all expect Jane's

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: (WEAKLY)
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: I'm not a romantic, you know. I ask only
dialog: a comfortable home, and considering Mr
dialog: Collin's character, and situation in
dialog: life, I am convinced that my chance of
dialog: happiness with him is as fair as most

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: And that's all you expect?
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE

speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Yes.

dialog: No, not at all.
speaker_heading: LADY CATHERINE
dialog: Your sisters, do they draw?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH

dialog: Not at all, Lady Catherine.
speaker_heading: LADY CATHERINE
dialog: Mmmm. Are any of your younger sisters
dialog: out?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Yes, ma'am. All.
speaker_heading: LADY CATHERINE
dialog: All! What, five out at once? Very odd!
dialog: â¢ And you only the second - the younger
dialog: ones out before the elders are married!
dialog: Your youngest sisters must be very young.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. But I
dialog: think it would be very hard on younger
dialog: sisters, not to have their share of
dialog: amusement because the elder is still
dialog: unmarried. And to be kept back on such a
dialog: motive! It would hardly encourage
dialog: sisterly affection.
speaker_heading: LADY CATHERINE
dialog: Upon my word, you give your opinion very
dialog: decidedly for so young a person. Pray,
dialog: what is your age?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH

speaker_heading: DARCY

speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: I'm afraid Mr and Mrs Collins are gone on
dialog: business to the village.
text: A pause. What on earth does Mr Darcy want? He paces up
dialog: and down.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: This is a charming house. I believe my
dialog: aunt did a great deal to it when Mr
dialog: Collins first arrived.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I believe so -- and she could not have
dialog: bestowed her kindness on a more grateful
speaker_heading: SUBJECT-
dialog: Another pause.

speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: No. Thankyou.

speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Good day, Miss Bennet. It's been a

speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: What on earth have you done to poor Mr

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH.

scene_heading: 71 EXT. HUNSFORD CHURCH - DAY. 71
text: Sunday service is over and worshippers are leaving the "

text: Lady Catherine, who is sweeping out with her miserable-

text: joins Colonel Fitzwilliam. They walk down the path
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: How long do you plan to stay in Kent,
dialog: Colonel?
speaker_heading: FITZWILLIAM
dialog: As long as Darcy chooses. I am at his
dialog: disposal.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I do imagine your cousin brought you down
dialog: with him chiefly to have someone to order
dialog: around. I wonder he does not marry and
dialog: secure a lasting convenience of that
dialog: kind.
speaker_heading: FITZWILLIAM
dialog: She would be a lucky woman.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: FITZWILLIAM
dialog: Darcy is a most loyal companion. From
dialog: what I heard, on our journey here, he
text: recently came to the rescue of one of his
text: friends just in time.
text: Darcy, waylaid by various people, comes out of the
text: church. His eyes search for Elizabeth. He sees her with
text: Fitzwilliam and hesitates. Too late! Mr Collins steps up
text: to him and engages him in conversation. Elizabeth stops,
text: at the churchyard gate.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: What happened?
dialog: Â¢
speaker_heading: FITZWILLIAM
dialog: He saved the man from an imprudent
dialog: marriage.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: (FALTERING SLIGHTLY)
dialog: Who was the man?
speaker_heading: FITZWILLIAM
dialog: His closest friend. Mr Bingley.
text: A silence.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Did Mr Darcy give you his reasons for
dialog: this interference?
speaker_heading: FITZWILLIAM
dialog: There were apparently strong objections
dialog: to the lady.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: What kind of objections? Her lack of
dialog: fortune?
speaker_heading: FITZWILLIAM
dialog: I think it was her family that was
dialog: considered unsuitable.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: So he separated them?
speaker_heading: FITZWILLIAM
dialog: I believe so. I know nothing else.
text: Elizabeth grows pale. She turns to look at Darcy who is
text: joined by his aunt.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I wish Mr Darcy and all his friends well

scene_heading: 72 EXT. ROSINGS PARK - DAY. 72
text: Lizzie walks across the park - anywhere, she hardly

text: Darcy do such a terrible thing! It starts to rain.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: â¢ A Grecian summer house by the lake. The rain is now
text: bucketing down. Lizzie hurries into the summer house and
text: sits down, heavily, on a bench.
text: Her poor sister; Lizzie gazes in despair at the rain-
text: lashed landscape.
text: A man approaches, across the park. He draws nearer.
text: It's Darcy. Elizabeth stiffens. He's hurrying towards
text: her. Sodden, breathless, he comes into the. summer house.
text: He is in a state of agitation - far too agitated to
text: notice her upset face.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Miss Bennet, I have struggled in vain but
dialog: I can bear it no longer ... . The past
dialog: months have been a torment...
text: He pauses, unable to speak. Elizabeth stares at him in
text: astonishment. He struggles on.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I came to Rosings with the single object
dialog: of seeing you...I had to see you...
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: â¢ Me?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: â¢ I've fought against my better judgement,
dialog: my family's expectation...
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: The inferiority of your birth.. .my rank
dialog: and circumstance...
speaker_heading: (STUMBLINGLY)
dialog: all those things.. .but I'm willing to put
dialog: them aside... and ask you to end my
dialog: agony...
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I don't understand...
speaker_heading: DARCY
speaker_heading: (WITH PASSION)
dialog: I love you. Most ardently.
text: Elizabeth stares at him.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Please do me the honour of accepting my
dialog: hand.
text: A silence. Elizabeth struggles with the most painful
text: confusion of feeling. Finally she recovers.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: (VOICE SHAKING)
dialog: Sir, I appreciate the struggle you have
dialog: been through, and I am very sorry to have
dialog: caused you pain. Believe me, it was
text: unconsciously done.
text: A silence. Gathering her shawl, she gets to her feet.
speaker_heading: DARCY
speaker_heading: (STARES)
dialog: Is this your reply?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Are you laughing at me?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Are you rejecting me?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: I'm sure that the feelings which, as
dialog: you've told me, have hindered your
dialog: regard, will help you in overcoming it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 72.
text: A terrible silence, as this sinks in. Neither of them can
text: â¢ move. At last, Darcy speaks. He is very pale.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Might I ask why, with so little endeavour
dialog: at civility, I am thus repulsed?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (trembling with emotion)
dialog: I might as well enquire why, with so.
dialog: evident a design of insulting me, you
dialog: chose to tell me that you liked me
dialog: against your better judgement. If I was
dialog: uncivil, that was some excuse -
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Believe me, I didn't mean -
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: But I have other reasons, you know I
dialog: have!
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: What reasons?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Do you think that anything might tempt me
dialog: to accept the man who has ruined, perhaps
dialog: for ever, the happiness of a most beloved
dialog: sister?
text: Silence. Darcy looks as if he's been struck across the
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Do you deny it, Mr Darcy? That you
dialog: separated a young couple who loved each
dialog: other, exposing your friend to the
dialog: censure of the world for caprice, and my
dialog: sister to its derision for disappointed
dialog: hopes, and involving them both in misery
dialog: of the acutest kind?
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I do not deny it.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: (BLURTS OUT)
dialog: How could you do it?
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Because I believed your sister
text: indifferent to him.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: â¢ Indifferent?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: â¢ I watched them most carefully, and
dialog: realized his attachment was much deeper
dialog: than hers.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: That's because she's shy!
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Bingley too is modest, and was persuaded
dialog: that she didn't feel strongly for him.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Because you suggested it!
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I did it for his own good.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: My sister hardly shows her true feelings
dialog: to me!
dialog: (pause, takes a breath)
dialog: I suppose you suspect that his fortune
dialog: had some bearing on the matter?
speaker_heading: DARCY
speaker_heading: (SHARPLY)
dialog: No! I wouldn't do your sister the
dialog: Â¢
dialog: dishonour. Though it was suggested -
speaker_heading: (STOPS)
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: What was?
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: It was made perfectly clear that-an
dialog: advantageous marriage...
speaker_heading: (STOPS)
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Did my sister give that impression?
speaker_heading: DARCY -
dialog: No!
text: An awkward pause.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: There was, however, I have to admit...
dialog: the matter of your family -
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Our want of connection? Mr Bingley didn't
dialog: vex himself about that!
dialog: Â¢
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: No, it was more than that.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: How, sir?
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: (pause, very uncomfortable)
dialog: It pains me to say this, but it was the
dialog: lack of propriety shown by your mother,
dialog: your three younger sisters - even, on
dialog: occasion, your father. Forgive me.
text: Lizzie blushes. He has hit home. Darcy paces up and down.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: You and your sister -- I must exclude from
dialog: this...
text: Darcy stops and gazes at her. He is in turmoil. Elizabeth
text: glares at him, in a blaze of fury and misery.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: And what about Mr Wickham?
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Mr Wickham?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: What excuse can you give for your
dialog: behavior to him?
dialog: Â¢
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: You take an eager interest in that
dialog: gentleman's concerns!
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: He told me of his misfortunes.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Oh yes, his misfortunes have been very
dialog: great indeed!
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You have ruined his chances, and yet
dialog: treat him with sarcasm?
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: So this is your opinion of me! Thank you
dialog: for explaining so fully. Perhaps these
dialog: offences might have been overlooked, if
dialog: your pride had not been hurt -
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: My pride?
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: - by my honesty in admitting scruples
dialog: about our relationship.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: DARCY (CONT'D)
dialog: Could you expect me to rejoice in the
dialog: inferiority of your circumstances?
dialog: Â¢
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: And those are the words of a gentleman?
dialog: From the first moment I met you, your
dialog: arrogance and conceit, your selfish
dialog: distain of the feelings of others, made
dialog: me realize that you were the last man in
dialog: the world I could ever be prevailed upon
dialog: to marry.
text: Darcy recoils, as if slapped. A terrible silence.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Forgive me, madam, for taking up so much
dialog: of your time.

text: suddenly Darcy's face appears. She freezes. They stare at
text: each other without speaking. Finally...
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I came to leave you this.
text: He places a letter on the table behind her. Elizabeth
text: does not turn but watches him through the mirror.
speaker_heading: DARCY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm not going to renew the sentiments
dialog: which were so disgusting to you, but to
dialog: address the two offenses you have laid
dialog: against me. I had not long been in
dialog: Hertfordshire before I saw that Bingley
dialog: Â¢
dialog: preferred your eldest sister. I observed
dialog: my friend's behaviour attentively and I
dialog: could perceive that his partiality for
dialog: Miss Bennet was beyond what I have ever
text: witnessed in him.
text: Elizabeth cannot bring herself to look at Darcy. She
text: stares at her own reflection as he speaks.
speaker_heading: DARCY (CONT'D)
dialog: Yet when I observed your sister .1
dialog: detected no symptom of peculiar regard,
dialog: and witnessed only the families coarse
dialog: appetite for having their daughters
dialog: married favorably. And so in London,
dialog: perhaps erroneously, I persuaded him of
dialog: the unfitness of the match citing your
text: sisters coolness towards him.
text: We zoom in on Elizabeth's reflection.
speaker_heading: DARCY (CONT'D)
text: It was unknowingly done and though the
dialog: motives which governed me may to you
dialog: appear naturally insufficient, they were
dialog: done to protect a friend. As to the other

speaker_heading: MRS GARDINER
dialog: I'm so glad you changed your mind.
text: Elizabeth is alert, her eyes bright with curiosity. The

text: Elizabeth's face. She gasps. The Gardiners gasp.
text: A huge, wide shot of Pemberley House. It's vast,

speaker_heading: MRS REYNOLDS
dialog: This is my master - Mr Darcy.
speaker_heading: MRS GARDINER
dialog: A handsome face. Lizzie, is it a true

speaker_heading: MRS REYNOLDS
dialog: Does this young lady know Mr Darcy?

dialog: Is your master much at Pemberley?
speaker_heading: MRS REYNOLDS
dialog: Not as much as I would wish, sir, or he --

text: Relaxed again Elizabeth wanders off as the Gardiners talk
dialog: to Mrs Reynolds.
speaker_heading: MRS GARDINER
dialog: If he should marry, you might see more of
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: MRS REYNOLDS
dialog: Yes madam, but I do not know when that
dialog: will be. I do not know a lady who is good
dialog: enough for him.
speaker_heading: MRS GARDINER
dialog: What do you mean?
dialog: Â¢
speaker_heading: MRS REYNOLDS
dialog: I've known Mr Darcy since he was a boy.
dialog: He was always a kind and generous person
dialog: even then. Not everyone can see it,
dialog: because he does not make a meal of it
dialog: like a lot of young men nowadays. But he
dialog: is the most sweet-tempered and kind-
dialog: hearted man I have ever known.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: As the Gardiners look at more paintings, Elizabeth drifts
text: out through the open doors and onto a terrace. In the
text: bright sunlight the view of the gardens and valley beyond
dialog: is exquisite. Outside the music we heard before is
dialog: louder.
scene_heading: 92 EXT. TERRACE - PEMBERLY - THE SAME. 92
text: Elizabeth wanders aimlessly across the terrace, being
text: unconsciously drawn by the music. Suddenly Elizabeth
text: recognizes the tune (perhaps it is one she has played
text: earlier - but this time it is played exquisitely). She
text: follows the music round a corner, intrigued as she gets
text: â¢ closer and closer to its source. She finally realizes she
text: is outside the room where the music is being played.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 87.
text: She steals herself a moment, but her curiosity gets the
text: better of her and she discretely peeps in.
dialog: Â¢
text: Through the window she sees Georgina Darcy, a beautiful
text: fifteen year old playing the piano with great passion and
text: fluency. She is moved by the music and listens. After
text: sometime, then someone steps into her view but is mostly
text: hidden by shadows in the room. He is directly behind
text: Georgina and gently puts his hands over her eyes.
text: Georgina stops playing and laughs uproariougly. She
text: stands and kisses the figure, the sunlight hits his face.
dialog: It is Darcy.
text: Georgina and Darcy kiss. Elizabeth is stunned to see him
text: there. Darcy glances up and sees Elizabeth watching him.
text: For a moment they both stare at each other frozen with
text: surprise. Georgina starts in fright at the figure,
text: Elizabeth turns and runs. Darcy comes out after her.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Miss Bennet!
text: Elizabeth stops, appallingly embarrassed. Darcy catches
text: up with her. They both blush, deeply.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I thought you were in London.
speaker_heading: DARCY
speaker_heading: (STUPIDLY)
dialog: No... I'm not.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: No.

text: Another pause. She extends her hand.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I'm so sorry to intrude. They said the
dialog: house was open for visitors. I had no
dialog: idea...
text: She shakes his hand and starts to walk away.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: May I see you to the village?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Oh no! I'm very fond of walking.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Yes.

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: (STARES)
dialog: To dine with him?
speaker_heading: MRS GARDINER
dialog: - there is something pleasing about his
text: mouth, when he speaks.
speaker_heading: MR GARDINER
dialog: You don't mind delaying our journey for

text: A footman escorts Elizabeth and the Gardiner's through
text: the stupendous library. From the drawing room, the sound
text: of a piano playing.. It's the same music Elizabeth played
dialog: at Rosings, but this time played very beautifully.
text: Elizabeth is filled with trepidation; we can almost feel
text: her heart racing.
text: The footman opens the double doors to reveal the
text: magnificent drawing room. Darcy is there. So is the

text: Elizabeth smiles, surprised and delighted. And grateful
dialog: to be rescued. What does Mr Darcy mean by this?
text: She moves away, to speak to her uncle. Miss Bingley moves
text: closer to Darcy.
speaker_heading: MISS BINGLEY
dialog: In six months I have never seen anyone so
text: altered. How brown and coarse she has
dialog: become!
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I perceive no alteration' except she is
text: rather tanned. Hardly a miraculous
dialog: consequence of travelling in the summer.
speaker_heading: MISS BINGLEY
dialog: I remember, when we first knew her in
dialog: Hertfordshire, you said "she a beauty? I
dialog: would have as soon called her mother a
dialog: wit!"
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: You must have mis-heard, Caroline. Even

text: at two large fish that lie beside him.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: It is so beautiful up here. I will be

speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Miss Elizabeth.
text: She cries on.
speaker_heading: DARCY (CONT'D)
dialog: Miss Elizabeth.
text: She eventually gathers herself.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: It is the most dreadful news. Lydia has

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: No, this is my fault. I might have

dialog: with my sisters rather than too proud
dialog: with my knowledge.
text: Mr and Mrs Gardiner look at each other perplexed.
speaker_heading: MRS GARDINER
dialog: Has anything been done to recover her?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Father has gone to London. But I know

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: (IN DESPERATION)
dialog: You don't know what he's like
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: Now where will they live? Purvis Lodge
dialog: might do. Ashworth is vacant of course,
dialog: but it's too far off, I couldn't bear to
dialog: have her ten miles from me -

text: She comes into the house with Wickham. Her mother kisses

speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: - and then we passed Sarah Sims in her
dialog: carriage so I took off my glove and let
text: my hand just rest on the window frame, so
dialog: she might see the ring, and then 1 bowed
dialog: and smiled like anything!
text: Kitty shrieks with envy. Lizzie moves away; she cannot

scene_heading: 109 INT. DINING ROOM - LONGBOURN - DAY. 109

speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Jane, I take your place now, and you must

speaker_heading: LYDIA

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Lydia, rattling on to Lizzie.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Well, Monday morning came and I was in
dialog: such a fuss -
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I don't want to hear -
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: - there was my aunt, preaching and
text: talking away just as if she was reading a
dialog: sermon, she was horrid unpleasant -
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Can't you understand why?
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: - but I didn't hear a word because I was
dialog: thinking of my dear Wickham. I longed to
dialog: â¢ know whether he would be married in his
dialog: blue coat...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Mary turning to Wickham.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: The north of England, I believe, boasts
dialog: some spectacular scenery...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Lydia burbling on, to a stony-faced Lizzie.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: - and then my uncle was called away from
dialog: the church on business and I thought -
dialog: who is to be our best man if he doesn't
dialog: come back? Lucky he did come back or I
dialog: would have had to ask Mr Darcy -
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: (STARES)
dialog: Mr Darcy?

speaker_heading: LYDIA

speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: Yes, come on!
text: Wickham looks slightly abashed - a trapped man. What has
dialog: he let himself in for?
text: Lizzie comes into the garden, looking for her younger
text: sister. Wickham detaches himself and comes over to her. A
text: rueful smile.
speaker_heading: WICKHAM
dialog: I hope we can be even better friends, now
dialog: we're brother and sister.
text: An attempt at a twinkling smile, but Elizabeth is now
text: immune to his charm. She nods, briefly.
speaker_heading: WICKHAM
dialog: I hear you visited Pemberley. My dear old
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: (NODS)
dialog: I met Mr Darcy's sister.
speaker_heading: WICKHAM
speaker_heading: (A BEAT)

dialog: aside.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: (LOW VOICE)
dialog: Why was Mr Darcy there?
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: I'm not supposed to tell.
text: Lizzie abandons her pride. She takes Lydia's hand.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Please, Lydia!
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Because he paid for it.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: (STARES)
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: LYDIA
speaker_heading: (CARELESSLY)
text: The wedding, Wickham's commission.
dialog: Everything.

speaker_heading: KITTY
speaker_heading: (CALLS)
dialog: Lydia! It's your turn!
text: Lydia moves to go.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: People kept saying Wickham owed them
dialog: money, it was so tedious. So Darcy
dialog: settled his debts but I don't really like
dialog: him, do you?
text: Lizzie pulls her back.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: But why did he do it?
speaker_heading: LYDIA
speaker_heading: (SHRUGS)
dialog: I don't know, do I? Anyway you're not to
dialog: tell because it's supposed to be our
dialog: uncle who paid, and he wouldn't have

dialog: favorite.

speaker_heading: BUTLER
dialog: Mr Darcy.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I have some business with Mr Bingley.
text: Darcy goes inside and the door shuts. The camera cranes
text: slowly upstairs until we can see through the first floor
text: window and into the drawing room. Mr Darcy enters and
text: bows to Mr Bingley. He starts to talk in earnest. Bingley
text: looks stunned by what Darcy is relaying to him. We

speaker_heading: WICKHAM
dialog: Please relay my affections to the Darcy's

dialog: will be pleased to hear things have
dialog: worked out so well.
text: He joins Lydia.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: (through the window)

speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: Mr Bingley?
text: Mrs Hill indicates a woman in the butcher's shop.
speaker_heading: MRS HILL
text: Mrs Nichols is ordering a haunch Of pork,

speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: Tomorrow?
speaker_heading: (RECOVERING)

speaker_heading: (MOVES AWAY)
dialog: No, we shall not mention a word about it.
dialog: (comes back to Mrs Hill)

speaker_heading: MRS HILL

speaker_heading: (BLUSHING)
dialog: Not that I'm afraid of myself, but I
dialog: dread other people's remarks.
text: A brave smile. Lizzie, of course, is not convinced in the
text: slightest. They go into the shop.
scene_heading: 114 EXT. LONGBOURN -- DAY. 114
text: Mr Bingley rides towards Longbourn, a look of slight

text: Mary is practising her scales. Jane and Elizabeth are

speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: He is here! He is here, he's at the door!
dialog: Â¢
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: Oh my goodness! Everybody act naturally.
text: Jane completely freezes. Everybody else goes into a

speaker_heading: MRS BENNET (CONT'D)
dialog: Whatever you do, do not appear
dialog: overbearing.
text: Kitty looks out through a window.
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: Look. There's someone with him. Mr whats

text: Elizabeth looks through the window at Darcy, her heart
text: leaps to her mouth.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: Mr Darcy indeed! The very insolence of
dialog: 0 0 it. What does he think of coming here?

text: bow. Bingley smiles warmly at Jane, who blushes.
text: Elizabeth glances at Darcy. His face is strained. Mrs
text: Bennet is all smiles for Bingley. She ignores Darcy.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET (CONT'D)
dialog: How very glad we are to see you, Mr
dialog: Bingley! There are a great many changes
dialog: since you went away. Miss Lucas is
dialog: married and settled. And one of my own
dialog: daughters too, you will have seen it in
dialog: the papers though it was not put in as it
dialog: ought to have been. Very short, nothing
dialog: about her family.
speaker_heading: BINGLEY
speaker_heading: (SMILES)
dialog: I did hear of it, and offer my
dialog: congratulations.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: - but it's very hard to have my Lydia
dialog: taken away from me. Mr Wickham has been
dialog: transferred to Newcastle, where ever that
dialog: is. Thank heaven he has some friends.
text: Mrs Bennet shoots a frosty glance at Mr Darcy. This is
dialog: more than Elizabeth can bare.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Do you hope to stay long in the country,
dialog: Mr Bingley?
speaker_heading: BINGLEY
dialog: Just a few weeks. For the shooting.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: When you have killed all your own birds,
dialog: Mr Bingley, I beg you will come here and
dialog: shoot as many as you please.
speaker_heading: MR BINGLEY
dialog: Thank you -
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: - Mr Bennet will be vastly happy to

speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I return to town tomorrow.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: (A PAUSE)
dialog: So soon?
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: My Jane looks well, does she not?
text: Mr-Bingley stands up abruptly.
speaker_heading: BINGLEY
dialog: She does indeed. Well, I must be going, I
dialog: suppose. Darcy -
text: Darcy cannot quite believe it. He gives Bingley a harsh
text: stare, Bingley has not completed his task.
speaker_heading: BINGLEY (CONT`D)
dialog: It was very pleasant to see you all
dialog: again. Elizabeth, Miss Jane..
text: Bingley can almost not bear to look Jane in the eye as he
text: acknowledges them all very briefly and bolts for the
text: door. Mrs Bennet fusses around him.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: You must come again. For when you were in
dialog: town last winter you promised to take a
dialog: family dinner with us. I have not forgot
dialog: you see. At least three courses.
text: Bingley and Darcy take their leave, leaving the Bennets

speaker_heading: BINGLEY
dialog: Oh damn, damn, buggery, damn.
speaker_heading: DARCY

speaker_heading: BINGLEY
dialog: Damn and blast, oh buggery, damn.
scene_heading: 117 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - DAY. 117
text: The girls are now spread around the room. Jane in.

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Well, I'm glad that's over. We can now

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: Oh yes? Jane, take care.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You cannot think me so weak as to be in
dialog: Â¢
dialog: danger now.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I think you are in great danger of making
dialog: him as much in love with you as ever.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I'm sorry, though, that he came with Mr
dialog: Darcy.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: (BLURTS OUT)
dialog: Oh Jane, I have acted so stupidly. Had I
dialog: been in love, I could not have been more
dialog: blind!
speaker_heading: JANE
speaker_heading: (STARES)
dialog: What do you mean?
text: The door bell rings.
speaker_heading: KITTY

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

dialog: 
dialog:

text: Everyone has regained their decorous positions. They hear
dialog: Â¢
text: Bingley's voice at the door and he comes in very
text: awkwardly. He smiles. His face is crimson with
dialog: embarrassment.
speaker_heading: BINGLEY
dialog: I, erm, I know this is all very
dialog: embarrassing, but I would like to request
dialog: the privilege of speaking to Miss Jane -
text: They all look at him.
speaker_heading: BINGLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: - alone.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
text: Girls. Everybody to the kitchen.
dialog: Immediately. Oh, Mr Bingley. It is so
dialog: good to see you again so soon.
text: She ushers everyone out, not before squeezing Jane's
text: hand. Now Jane and Bingley are alone, facing each other
text: with extreme embarrassment.
speaker_heading: BINGLEY
dialog: Miss Bennet, you have been the victim of
dialog: a huge misunderstanding. Suffice to say,
dialog: I have been an unmitigated and
dialog: comprehensive ass. And therefore, I would

speaker_heading: MR BENNET
dialog: I am sure they will do well together,

speaker_heading: MRS BENNET

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Unfathomable.
speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh Lizzie, if I could but see you so
dialog: happy. If there were such another man for
dialog: you!
text: There is a noise outside.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may
text: meet with another Mr Collins in time.
dialog: What is that?
text: More noise, it sounds like a carriage, then a loud

speaker_heading: LADY CATHERINE
dialog: (to Mrs Bennet)
dialog: And these are your daughters, I suppose.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: All but one, the youngest has been lately
dialog: married your ladyship. And my eldest was

dialog: Â¢
speaker_heading: LADY CATHERINE
dialog: You have a very small garden, madam.

speaker_heading: MRS BENNET

speaker_heading: MR BENNET
speaker_heading: (TENTATIVELY)
dialog: Could I offer you a cup of tea, perhaps?
speaker_heading: LADY CATHERINE
dialog: Absolutely not! I must speak to Miss
dialog: Elizabeth alone, as a matter of complete
dialog: urgency.
text: The Bennets all look at each other", bewildered by this

scene_heading: 125 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - NIGHT. 125
text: Elizabeth leads the way into the drawing room - lights an

dialog: them.
speaker_heading: LADY CATHERINE
dialog: You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to
dialog: understand why I am`here.
text: â¢ Lit only by the oil lamp Lady Catherine resembles a
text: flickering ghoul.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Indeed you are mistaken. I can not
dialog: account for this honour at all.
speaker_heading: LADY CATHERINE
dialog: Miss Bennet, I warn you, I am not to be
text: trifled with. A report of a most alarming
dialog: nature has reached me that you intend to
dialog: be united with my nephew, Mr Darcy.
text: Elizabeth stares at her, amazed.
speaker_heading: LADY CATHERINE (CONT'D)
dialog: I know this to be a scandalous falsehood,
dialog: though not wishing to injure him by
dialog: supposing it possible, I instantly set
dialog: off to make my sentiments known.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: If you believed it impossible, I wonder
dialog: you took the trouble of coming so far.
speaker_heading: LADY CATHERINE
text: To hear it contradicted, Miss Bennet.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: (COOLLY)
dialog: Your coming here will be rather a
dialog: confirmation, surely, if indeed such a
dialog: report exists.
speaker_heading: LADY CATHERINE
dialog: If? Do you then pretend to be ignorant of
dialog: it? Has it not been industriously
dialog: circulated by yourself?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I have never heard of it.
speaker_heading: LADY CATHERINE
dialog: And can you declare there is no
dialog: foundation for it?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I do not pretend to possess equal
dialog: frankness with your ladyship. You may ask
dialog: the questions, which I may not choose to
dialog: answer.
speaker_heading: LADY CATHERINE
dialog: This is not to be borne. Has my nephew
dialog: made you an offer of marriage?
speaker_heading: IS
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Your Ladyship declared it to be
dialog: impossible.
speaker_heading: LADY CATHERINE
dialog: Let me be understood. Mr Darcy is engaged
dialog: to my daughter. Now what have you to say?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Only this - if that is the case you can
dialog: have no reason to suppose he will make an
dialog: offer to me.
speaker_heading: LADY CATHERINE
dialog: Oh obstinate girl! This union has been
dialog: planned since their infancy. Do you think
dialog: it can be prevented by a young woman of
dialog: inferior birth, of no importance in the
dialog: world and wholly unallied to his family?
dialog: Whose own sister's elopement resulted in
text: the scandalously patched-up marriage,
dialog: only achieved at the expense of your
dialog: uncle? Heaven and earth, are the shades
dialog: of Pemberly to be thus polluted? Now tell
dialog: me once and for all, are you engaged to
dialog: him?
dialog: Â¢
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I am not.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: LADY CATHERINE
dialog: And will you promise never to enter into
dialog: such an engagement?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I will not. And I certainly never shall.
dialog: Allow me to say, the arguments which you
dialog: have supported this extraordinary
dialog: application have been as frivolous as the
dialog: application was ill-judged. You have,
dialog: insulted me in every possible method and
dialog: can now have nothing further to say. I
dialog: must ask you to leave immediately. Good
dialog: night.
text: Elizabeth throws open.the door, revealing the family
dialog: outside.
speaker_heading: LADY CATHERINE
dialog: I have never been thus treated in my
dialog: entire life.
text: Lady Catherine storms past the family and out into the

text: Elizabeth walks out into the open countryside. The mists

text: is alone, vulnerable. Then she sees it is Darcy.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Mr Darcy!
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: What are you doing out here so early?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I could not sleep.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Me neither. I have been up.most of the
dialog: night.
dialog: Â¢
dialog: Elizabeth hardly knows how to react at this unexpected
text: meeting. Rather politely she thanks Mr Darcy.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Mr Darcy, I must thank you for your
dialog: unexampled generosity to both my sisters.
dialog: I know what kindnesses you have done for
dialog: poor Lydia and suspect your hand in the
dialog: happy resolution for Jane also.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I am alarmed that you know of what I have
dialog: been so in earnest to keep silent. But
dialog: you must know that your happiness was one
dialog: of my prime inducements.
text: Elizabeth looks at Darcy.
speaker_heading: DARCY (CONT`D)
dialog: I know you are too generous to trifle
dialog: with me. I believe you spoke with my Aunt
dialog: last night, and it has taught me to hope
dialog: as I had scarcely allowed myself before.
dialog: If your feelings are still what they were
dialog: last April, tell me so at once. My
text: affections and wishes are unchanged, but
dialog: Â¢
dialog: one word from you will silence me
dialog: forever.
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: DARCY (CONT'D)
dialog: If, however, your feelings have

text: Elizabeth gazes at him.
speaker_heading: DARCY (CONT'D)
dialog: I would have to tell you, you have
dialog: bewitched me body and soul and I love and
dialog: love and love you. And never wish to be
dialog: parted from you from this day on.
text: Elizabeth looks at him. She does not say a word. Darcy is
text: staring at her for a reply. A tear rolls down Elizabeth's
dialog: cheek.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I am very happy to inform you that not
dialog: only have my sentiments changed there are
dialog: no other words which could give me
dialog: greater pleasure.
text: Darcy stares at her. They both start to cry. Darcy very,
text: very slowly and gently touches her face. She closes her
text: eyes. They kiss. She touches his face with her hand, the
text: kiss becomes passionate.
scene_heading: 130 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - DUSK. 130
text: The place is in an uproar. Bingley, Jane, Mary, Kitty, Mr
text: and Mrs Bennet are all gathered, fretting terribly about
text: Elizabeth's whereabouts. Through a window we see
text: Elizabeth lead Darcy along the duck board plank across
text: the moat. Elizabeth enters the house, everybody starts.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET
dialog: Lizzie, where have you been. We thought
dialog: something had happened to you.
text: Darcy follows Elizabeth in.
speaker_heading: MRS BENNET (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr Darcy! What on earth are you doing

text: Elizabeth paces outside the door of the library, waiting.
text: After a while Darcy emerges, he gives Elizabeth the
text: briefest of smiles and leaves the door open. Elizabeth
text: walks in. Her father is in a state of shock.
speaker_heading: MR BENNET
dialog: Lizzie, are you out of your senses? I
dialog: thought you hated the man.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: No, Papa.
speaker_heading: MR BENNET
dialog: He is rich, to be sure, and you will have
dialog: more fine carriages than Jane. But will
dialog: that make you happy?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: (UNCOMFORTABLE)
dialog: Have you no other objection than your
dialog: belief in my indifference?
speaker_heading: MR BENNET
dialog: None at all. We all know him to be a
dialog: proud, unpleasant sort of fellow, but
dialog: this would be nothing if you really liked
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (tears in her eyes)
dialog: I do like him!
speaker_heading: (WITH PASSION)
dialog: I love him! He's not proud. It's I who's
dialog: been prejudiced, who didn't realize ...
dialog: You don't know him, Papa...if I told you
dialog: what he's really like. What he's done.
speaker_heading: MR BENNET
dialog: What has he done?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: MR BENNET
dialog: Good Lord. I must pay him back.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: No, you mustn't tell anyone! He wouldn't
dialog: want it.
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: We misjudged him, me more than anyone. In
dialog: every way,not just in this matter. I've
dialog: been so blind. He's been so blind! About
dialog: Jane, about so many things. Then so have
dialog: I...
speaker_heading: (BREATHLESS PAUSE)
dialog: You see, he and I are so similiar...we're
dialog: both so stubborn...
speaker_heading: (SHAKY LAUGH)
dialog: Oh Papa...
text: Mr Bennet gazes at his daughter-. He still can't quite
dialog: take it in.
speaker_heading: MR BENNET
dialog: You do love him, don't you?
text: Elizabeth nods.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: â¢ Very much.
text: He looks at her earnestly, searching her face. He loves
text: his daughter very deeply. What he sees leaves him in no
dialog: doubt.
speaker_heading: MR BENNET
dialog: I cannot believe that anyone can deserve
dialog: you, but it seems I am over-ruled. So I
dialog: heartily give my consent.
text: Elizabeth jumps up and puts her arms around him.
speaker_heading: MR BENNET
dialog: I could not have parted with you, my
dialog: Lizzie, to any one less worthy.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Oh thank you!
text: She starts to rush out.
speaker_heading: MR BENNET
dialog: (calls out after her)
dialog: And if any young men come for Mary or
dialog: Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at
dialog: â¢ leisure.

scene_heading: â¢ 134 EXT. PEMBERLY - NIGHT. 134
text: We move through a vast wedding party, following Elizabeth
dialog: and Darcy. We meet all our characters. Lydia and Wickham
dialog: are missing. Let everyone have an end.
text: Darcy and Elizabeth kiss, then Darcy pulls Elizabeth off
text: into the shadows. We see them disappear into the park.
text: Coming close, we see them in the moonlight. It's Darcy
text: and Elizabeth. Deer turn to gaze at them. The music fades
text: as they walk further from the house, up the hill, past
text: the outcrops of rocks. An owl hoots. Darcy turns to
text: Elizabeth and smiles.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Allow me, Mrs Darcy.
text: He puts out his hand. She takes it. He helps her up the
text: rocks. When they get to the top they sit there, side by
text: side, and gaze at the distant lights of Pemberley.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: How did it begin?
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I cannot fix the hour, or the spot, or
dialog: Â¢
dialog: the look. It was too long ago and I was
dialog: in the middle before I knew it had begun.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Now be sincere, did you admire me for my
dialog: impertinenc?
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: For the liveliness of your mind, I did.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You may as well call it impertinence,
dialog: though make a virtue of it by all means.
dialog: My good qualities are under your
dialog: protection, and you are to exaggerate -
dialog: them as much as possible. And, in return,
dialog: it belongs to me to find occasions for
dialog: teasing and quarrelling with you as often
dialog: as maybe... and I shall begin directly...
text: We draw back-their figures diminish, smaller and
text: smaller under the immense, star-spangled sky. . .Fainter
text: and fainter, the sound of music and laughter...
