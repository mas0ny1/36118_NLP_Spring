scene_heading: EXT. LARRABEE ESTATE - EVENING
speaker_heading: NARRATOR:
dialog: Once upon a time, on the North Shore of Long Island,
text: some 30 miles from New York, there lived a small girl on
dialog: a large estate. The estate was very large indeed and had
text: many servants. There were gardeners to take care of the
text: gardens and a tree surgeon on a retainer. There was a
text: boatman to put the boats in the water in the spring and
dialog: scrape their bottoms in the winter. There were specialists
dialog: to take care of the grounds, the outdoor tennis court and
text: the indoor tennis court, the outdoor swimming pool and the
dialog: indoor swimming pool. And aman of no particular title
text: took care of a small pool in the garden for a goldfish
dialog: named George.
dialog: Also on the estate there was a chauffeur by the name
dialog: of Fairchild, who had been imported from England years
text: ago, together with a new Rolls-Royce. Fairchild was a
text: fine chauffeur of considerable polish, like the eight
dialog: cars in his care. And he had a daughter by the name of
dialog: ... Sabrina.
dialog: It was the eve of the annual six-meter-yacht races
dialog: and, as had been traditional on Long Island for the past
dialog: 30 years, the Larrabees were giving a party. It never
text: rained on the night of the Larrabee party. The Larrabees
dialog: wouldn't have stood for it.
scene_heading: INT. LARRABEE MANSION - EVENING
speaker_heading: NARRATOR:
dialog: There were four Larrabees in all â€” father, mother and
dialog: two sons. Maude and Oliver Larrabee were married in 1906
dialog: and among their many wedding presents was a town house
dialog: in New York and this estate for weekends.
text: The town house has since been converted into Saks Fifth
text: Avenue. Linus Larrabee, the elder son, graduated from
dialog: Yale, where his classmates voted him the man most likely
dialog: to leave his alma mater 50 million dollars. His brother,
dialog: David, went through several of the best Eastern colleges
dialog: for short periods of time, and through several marriages
text: for even shorter periods of time. He is now a successful
text: six-goal polo player and is listed on Linus's tax return
dialog: as a 600-dollar deduction. Life was pleasant among the
dialog: Larrabees, for this was as close to heaven as one could
dialog: get on Long Island.

dialog: Her name is Gretchen Van Horn, Chase National Bank.
dialog: I hate girls that giggle all the time.
dialog: You hate every girl David looks at. You can't go on

dialog: FAIRCHILD: You know, it's not every girl that's lucky enough
dialog: to go to Paris.
speaker_heading: SABRINA: I know.
dialog: FAIRCHILD: And it's the best cooking school in the world, Sabrina.
dialog: If your mother were alive, she'd be very happy to know
dialog: that you were going there. She was the best cook on Long
dialog: Island. Oh, I'm not telling that you have to be a cook as
dialog: she was, or that I want you to marry a chauffeur like me.
dialog: But you know how I feel about it. Your mother and I had
dialog: a good life together. We were respected by everyone.
dialog: And that's as much as anyone can want in this world.
dialog: Don't reach for the moon, child.
dialog: SABRINA: No, Father.
dialog: FAIRCHILD: Besides, it never hurt a young girl to learn how to
dialog: cook, did it, Sabrina? I'll wake you at seven. The boat

scene_heading: INT. SABRINA'S ROOM - NIGHT

text: Sabrina writes a letter to her father that reads, "Dearest Father.
dialog: I don't want to go to Paris. I want todie. Please forgive me for
text: what I am about to do. Goodbye, Sabrina." She thinks for a moment
text: and then adds another line which reads, "P.S. Don't have David
text: at the funeral. He probably wouldn't even cry." She closes the
text: envelope, walks over and feeds her fish.
scene_heading: EXT. GARAGE - NIGHT
text: Sabrina slips the envelope under Fairchild's door and then walks
text: down to the garage. She opens the garage door and goes in.
text: Sabrina closes the garage door and starts all of the cars. The
dialog: very last one makes a lot of noise.
text: SABRINA: Shh! Shh!
text: She begins to cough.
dialog: LINUS: What's going on here? Fairchild! Fairchild!
dialog: Anybody here?
text: He begins turning off the cars and opens another garage door.
text: Sabrina tries to hide, but her cough gives her away.
dialog: LINUS: Who's that? Sabrina, come out of there. Come on.
dialog: Come on, out of there.
speaker_heading: SABRINA: Hello.
dialog: LINUS: What are you doing here?
text: SABRINA: Just checking the spark plugs.
dialog: LINUS: The what?
dialog: SABRINA: Father was worried because one of the spark plugs was
dialog: missing. I wanted to find out which one it was.
dialog: LINUS: So you started all the motors and closed all the doors?
dialog: SABRINA: I didn't want to disturb anyone.
dialog: LINUS: You might never have disturbed anyone again. Does your
dialog: father know about this?
dialog: SABRINA: No! I wanted to surprise him.
dialog: LINUS: I think you'd better get out of here.
text: Linus escorts Sabrina out of the garage.
dialog: LINUS: Here, now. Now, breathe deep. That's right.
dialog: Now, deeper.
speaker_heading: SABRINA: Mmm.
text: Linus catches Sabrina as she faints. He carries her on his shoulder
text: up to her room.
speaker_heading: SABRINA: What happened?
dialog: LINUS: You passed out.
text: SABRINA: I'm all right. You don't have to carry me.

dialog: Mrs. Van Horn? Gretchen's mother?
dialog: Uh-huh.

dialog: CHEF: Very well. You have five seconds! Four seconds.
dialog: Three seconds. Two seconds. One second. To the ovens!
text: The students open the ovens and pull out their soufflÃ©s.
text: CHEF: Too low. Too pale. Too heavy. Too low. Too high.
dialog: You are exaggerating. Fair. So-so. Sloppy. Mmm!
dialog: Superb! My dear Baron, you have not lost your touch.
text: The Chef looks at Sabrina's soufflÃ©.
dialog: CHEF: Much too low.
dialog: SABRINA: I don't know what happened.
dialog: BARON: I will tell you what happened. You forgot to turn on
dialog: the oven.
speaker_heading: SABRINA: Oh!
dialog: BARON: I have been watching you for a long time, Mademoiselle.
dialog: Your mind has not been on the cooking. It has been
dialog: elsewhere. You're in love. And Iwill venture to goa
dialog: step further. You are unhappily in love.
dialog: SABRINA: Does it show?
text: BARON: Very clearly. A woman happily in love, she burns the
text: souffle. A woman unhappily in love, she forgets to turn
dialog: on the oven. Am I correct?
text: SABRINA: Yes. But I'm trying to get over it.
dialog: BARON: Why try to get over itP You speak of love like it was

dialog: The girl is Elizabeth Tyson of the Oyster Bay Tysons."
dialog: LINUS: Well, congratulations.
dialog: DAVID: Did you plant this?
dialog: LINUS: Me?! I thought it was common knowledge about you and
dialog: Elizabeth Tyson. You like her, don't you?
dialog: DAVID: 1 like her a lot.
dialog: LINUS: Well?
dialog: DAVID: 1 like a lot of girls a lot.
dialog: LINUS: You can say that again.
dialog: 12
dialog: DAVID: What are you gonna do with that gun?
text: Linus shoots several times into a barrel.
dialog: DAVID: Put that thing away, Linus!
dialog: LINUS: Look at that. The greatest plastic ever made. Not
dialog: ascratch on it. Say, I wonder how this would stand up
text: against a bazooka. Miss McCardle, ask General Stanton
dialog: on Governors Island and ask if we can borrow a bazooka.
dialog: McCARDLE: Yes, Mr. Larrabee.
dialog: DAVID: To get back to my problem, if you don't mind.
dialog: LINUS: Lend me your lighter.
dialog: DAVID: Get this straight, Linus. I have no intention of
dialog: marrying Elizabeth Tyson!
text: Linus holds a lighter under the plastic shield.
dialog: LINUS: Doesn't burn, doesn't scorch, doesn't melt. How about
dialog: that!
dialog: DAVID: Look, Linus. I've been married before. I've had it.
dialog: I've had it three times.
dialog: LINUS: Yeah, but this is the first time the family approves
dialog: because for once you're gonna settle down and do something
dialog: constructive. Taste it.
dialog: DAVID: What's so constructive about marrying Elizabeth Tyson?
dialog: LINUS: Taste it.
dialog: DAVID: It's sweet.
dialog: LINUS: That's right. It's made of sugar cane.
dialog: DAVID: Sugar cane. Wait a minute. This wouldn't have anything
dialog: to do with the fact the Tysons own the largest holdings of
dialog: sugar cane in Puerto Rico, would it?!
dialog: LINUS: Second largest. The largest have no daughter.

dialog: You make it sound so vulgar, David. As if the son of
dialog: the hot-dog dynasty were being offered in marriage to the
dialog: daughter of the mustard king. Surely, surely you don't
dialog: object to Elizabeth just because her father happens to
dialog: have 20 million dollars? That's very narrow-minded of
dialog: you, David.
dialog: Just one thing you overlooked. I haven't proposed,
dialog: and she hasn't accepted.
dialog: Oh, don't worry. I proposed, and Mr. Tyson accepted.
dialog: Did you kiss him?
dialog: Now look, David. Elizabeth is one of the loveliest
dialog: girls around. Sooner or later you're gonna propose to

dialog: mind.
dialog: Then why don't you marry her?
dialog: Me?
dialog: Well, what's so funny? You want to die an old maid?
dialog: Well, I was just thinking that if I were able to get
dialog: married, I'd have to take a Dictaphone, two secretaries
text: and four corporation counselors along on the honeymoon.
dialog: I'd be unfaithful to my wife every night of my married
dialog: life with vice presidents, boards of directors, slide-rule
dialog: accountants... This... this is my home. No wife would
dialog: ever understand it.
dialog: Well, neither can I. You've got all the money in the
dialog: world.
dialog: Well, what's money got to do with it? If making money
dialog: were all there was to business, it'd hardly be worth while
text: going to the office. Money is a by-product.
dialog: Well, what's the main objective? Power?
dialog: Ah! That's become a dirty word.
dialog: Well, then, what's the urge? You're going into plastics
dialog: now. What will that prove?
dialog: 14
text: LINUS: Prove? Nothing much. A new product has been found,
text: something of use to the world. A new industry moves into
text: an undeveloped area. Factories go up. Machines are brought
dialog: in. A harbor is dug, and you're in business. It's purely
dialog: coincidental, of course, that people who've never seen a
dialog: dime before, suddenly have a dollar. And barefooted kids
text: wear shoes and have their teeth fixed and their faces washed.
dialog: What's wrong with a kind of an urge that gives people
dialog: libraries, hospitals, baseball diamonds and, uh, movies
dialog: on a Saturday night? Miss McCardle, will you send in the
dialog: secretaries?
dialog: McCARDLE: Yes, Mr. Larrabee.
dialog: DAVID: Now you make me feel like a heel. If I don't marry
dialog: Elizabeth, some kid's gonna be running around Puerto Rico
text: barefoot with cavities in his teeth.
dialog: LINUS: Here. Look at this stuff. You'll fly in a plane made
dialog: of it. You'll wear a suit made of it and before we're
dialog: through with it, you'll probably be able to eat it.
dialog: We're organizing Larrabee Plastics. Larrabee Construction
text: is ready with the blueprints. Larrabee Shipping bought

dialog: DAVID: Now, wait a minute.

dialog: Is your father on the board of directors of all those

dialog: Well, you might say he runs things.

dialog: BUTLER: Oh, welcome home, Sabrina!
dialog: SABRINA: Ernest! Jenny Happ! How are you? Don't cry, Margaret.

dialog: A real Paris hat for you to wear to church on Sundays.
dialog: And Jenny, I've got something for you.
dialog: SABRINA: Father!

speaker_heading: SABRINA: All right.

dialog: Well, I guess you wouldn't think so much of it after
dialog: Paris.
dialog: SABRINA: I'll love it!
dialog: DAVID: Then we'll go dancing, and when they throw us out of

dialog: DAVID: Why, yes, of course.

dialog: SABRINA: Hello, Linus. I'm back!
dialog: DAVID: It's Sabrina. Isn't it amazing? Would you have

dialog: painted with Mercurochrome. How do you like those legs
dialog: now?
dialog: LINUS: David?

text: FAIRCHILD: No, nothing has changed. He's still David Larrabee.

text: FAIRCHILD: I don't like it.
dialog: MARGARET: Oh, Tom, you ought to be happy for her. This is what
dialog: she wanted. This is where she belongs.
text: FAIRCHILD: No, it's not. And it's not where I belong. Remember
dialog: the chauffeur on the Harrington estate? His daughter
dialog: fell in love with the son of the house. And the first
dialog: thing he knew, he was driving the family to the church,
text: changing his uniform and walking down the aisle to give
dialog: the bride away. That's not for me. I don't like it.

dialog: of a welcome home.
dialog: SABRINA: David's been wonderful, Mrs. Larrabee. He met me at
dialog: the station.
dialog: MAUDE: Did he? How nice of him.
dialog: DAVID: Yes, uh, she's been to Paris, you know.
dialog: MAUDE: Yes, 1 know. You must come over some time and cook

dialog: SABRINA: You don't remember?
dialog: DAVID: Well, I remember I had a pair of roller skates.
dialog: SABRINA: I was nine years old, and you had your arms around me
dialog: because you were teaching me to skate backwards. Suddenly,
dialog: you kissed me. I've never forgotten.
dialog: DAVID: Sabrina, let's get out of here.
dialog: SABRINA: Yes, let's.

dialog: LINUS: Wonderful girl.
dialog: DAVID: Were you nice to her?
dialog: LINUS: As nice as I could be.
dialog: DAVID: Oh, what a brother. I've been trying to write my poem

dialog: with 'glass'?
dialog: LINUS: Glass? Glass ... uh... â€˜alasâ€™.

dialog: LINUS: Any time.

dialog: OLIVER: That's nice. With the chauffeur's daughter?
dialog: LINUS: I don't care if he runs off with gardener's grandmother.
dialog: Ijust don't want him to run off with the plastics merger.
dialog: OLIVER: I've got a very simple solution. We'll fire Fairchild.
dialog: LINUS: Not after 25 years, Father.
dialog: OLIVER: All right then, we'll write her a nice little check and
dialog: tell her to forget about David.
dialog: LINUS: She doesn't want money. She wants love.
dialog: OLIVER: I thought they discontinue that model.
dialog: LINUS: The last of the romantics. L'amour, toujours l'amour.
dialog: OLIVER: What? Why does she have to pick on David? Why can't
dialog: she be in love with someone else?
dialog: LINUS: We will do our best.
dialog: OLIVER: Oh, oh, Is that the idea?
dialog: LINUS: Yep.

dialog: You've taken her out now three nights in a row. Is

dialog: Who said I was going? She is going because she'll think

dialog: It is not!
dialog: I'm going to tell Sabrina that I'll meet her on the boat.
text: When the boat is ten miles out at sea, she'll find out that
dialog: I'm not on the boat.
dialog: Uhh?
dialog: My cabin will be empty. Just a note of apology anda
text: few presents to soften the blow.
dialog: Excellent.
dialog: Yes, I thought you'd like it.
dialog: (into intercom) Miss McCardle, I want flowers in Miss
text: Fairchild's cabin. Candy, fruit and the usual what-
dialog: have-yous. Next, cable Miss Show to get her a car in
text: Paris, also an apartment. Next, a letter of credit on
dialog: our Paris bank. She can draw up to 50,000.
dialog: Easy, now.
dialog: Next, transfer to Thomas Fairchild 1,000 shares,
dialog: Larrabee Common.
dialog: 1,000 shares?!
dialog: Make it 1,500 shares, Larrabee Preferred.
dialog: Seems to me there ought to be a less extravagant way

dialog: Sabrina? What happened to you? It's twenty past
dialog: eight.
dialog: Good evening, Linus. I knowI'm late. I guess
dialog: I should have called you earlier. I can't see you
dialog: tonight. I'm very sorry I just can't make it.
dialog: I tried but I'm all tied up. _No, I'm not in Long
dialog: Island. I'm in New York. Oh, downtown in a phone
dialog: booth in a building. What difference does it make,
dialog: what building, Linus? I, I can't see you tonight.
dialog: Oh, all right, it's, it's the Larrabee Building,
dialog: but I'm not coming up.
dialog: Look, Sabrina, suppose you tell me exactly what's
dialog: on your mind, slowly and clearly? You talk and
dialog: I'll listen.
text: Linus quickly lays the phone down on his desk.
speaker_heading: SABRINA:
dialog: Well, you see it was really David's idea I go out
dialog: with you because he wants you to help him. But the
dialog: trouble is, it's not helping me any. I shouldn't
dialog: have been seeing you, Linus. I shouldn't even be
dialog: talking to you on the phone. In fact, I'm really
dialog: only calling to say goodbye because tomorrow you'll
dialog: be on the boat to Paris.
text: The elevator doors open and Linus steps out into the lobby.
dialog: SABRINA: In a way, I'm glad you're going. You do know
dialog: what I mean, don't you, Linus? Linus? Hello,
dialog: Linus? Where are you, Linus?
dialog: LINUS: Your three minutes are up.
dialog: SABRINA: Oh, hello. This is silly, 1 was talking to
dialog: myself.
dialog: LINUS: You've wasted a dime, too. Come on.
dialog: SABRINA: You're not angry with me, are you?
dialog: LINUS: Of course, not.
dialog: SABRINA: I have a perfectly good reason why I shouldn't see
dialog: you tonight.
dialog: LINUS: Not here, Sabrina.

dialog: LINUS: All right, Sabrina, what is that perfectly

dialog: it? What's bothering you?
dialog: SABRINA: It's me that's bothering me.
text: Linus turns on the lights.
scene_heading: SABRINA: Please don't.
dialog: LINUS: I'm sorry.
dialog: SABRINA: I know I'm not making much sense, Linus.
dialog: LINUS: Would you like a drink?
dialog: SABRINA: I don't think I want a drink.
dialog: LINUS: I think I do.
text: Linus walks over to the bar.
dialog: LINUS: Why don't you sit down?
dialog: SABRINA: I can only stay a minute.
dialog: LINUS: Mind if I turn on this little one?
speaker_heading: SABRINA: If you want.
dialog: LINUS: I'd hate to fix myself a martini with creme de menthe.
text: The intercom buzzes.
dialog: LINUS: Yes?
dialog: McCARDLE: I cancelled your dinner reservation, Mr. Larrabee.
dialog: What about the theatre tickets?
dialog: SABRINA: Oh, I couldn't possibly go anywhere.
dialog: LINUS: They're all yours, Miss McCardle. Good night.
text: Linus walks back over to the bar.
dialog: LINUS: You're sure you won't have even one?
dialog: SABRINA: No, thanks.
dialog: LINUS: You must be hungry.
dialog: SABRINA: I hadn't thought about it.
dialog: LINUS: Well, I'm starved. I was sort of saving myself
dialog: for 21 tonight.
dialog: SABRINA: I've spoiled your evening, Haven't IP
dialog: LINUS: No, you haven't. We can have dinner right here.
dialog: Let's see what Miss McCardle is hoarding. Probably
text: maraschino cherries and stale crackers.
text: Linus opens the cupboard.
text: LINUS: Tomato juice, puffed rice, sardines, tomato juice,
dialog: tomato juice, tomato juice.
dialog: SABRINA: That's an awful lot of tomato juice.
dialog: LINUS: Suppose you could fix something out of this?
dialog: SABRINA: Isuppose so. I'ma graduate cook, you know.
dialog: I have a diploma.
dialog: LINUS: Oh, it'll take a diploma.
dialog: SABRINA: I wanted to be so sure I couldn't go out with you
dialog: tonight. And here I am cooking for you. I guess maybe
dialog: I should have worn an apron.
text: LINUS: One apron, coming up.
text: Linus finds an apron in a bottom cupboard.
dialog: LINUS: Pots. Pans. Canopener. Stove. All the comforts
dialog: of home. You know, Miss McCardle once cooked dinner
dialog: here for the board of directors. After the first course,
text: there was a move to adjourn. It was passed unanimously.
dialog: What do we start with?
dialog: SABRINA: I haven't decided yet.
text: Sabrina begins to cry.
dialog: LINUS: Now, Sabrina, let's have none of those.
dialog: SABRINA: I'm so ashamed, Linus.
dialog: LINUS: You have no reason to be.
dialog: SABRINA: I've known you only a few days, just a few days really.
dialog: And I've been in love with David all my life. I can't
dialog: understand what's the matter with me. I went away to grow
dialog: up and I thought I had grown up, but I guess I haven't
dialog: really. I just got myself a new hairdo, that's all.
dialog: Please say something.
dialog: LINUS: Like what?
text: SABRINA: I don't know. Tell me I'm imagining things. Tell me
dialog: you never even thought of taking me on the boat to Paris
dialog: with you. Tell me to put on my coat and go home before
dialog: I make a complete fool of myself. But don't let me go
dialog: home. I couldn't bear it. This is the last time we'll
dialog: see each other. I'll behave, Linus. I'm all right now.
dialog: LINUS: That's good. How about dinner?
dialog: SABRINA: I just remembered I didn't have any lunch today.
dialog: LINUS: You didn't?
dialog: SABRINA: Or any breakfast, either.
dialog: LINUS: That may account for a lot of things.
dialog: SABRINA: Would you like a soufflÃ© for dessert?
dialog: LINUS: Out of tomato juice?
dialog: SABRINA: Out of crackers, of course.
dialog: LINUS: Not too soggy, huh?
dialog: SABRINA: You'd better get out of the kitchen.
text: Linus walks out onto the ledge and looks at the LibertÃ©.
dialog: SABRINA: Which one is the LibertÃ©?
text: LINUS: The one on the right.
dialog: SABRINA: Are you sure? You mustn't take the wrong boat.
dialog: LINUS: I'll try not to.
dialog: SABRINA: You haven't forgotten my instructions, have you?
dialog: Never an umbrella in Paris, and under all circumstances
dialog: rain the very first day.
dialog: LINUS: I haven't forgotten a word, Sabrina. My sister has
dialog: a yellow pencil. "Ma soeura un crayon jaune."
dialog: SABRINA: Very good. Tres bien. Watch. One, two, three,
text: crack. New egg. It's all in the wrist.
text: There must be an egg beater somewhere.
text: Sabrina goes over to the desk, and happens to notice two tickets
dialog: for the LibertÃ©.
scene_heading: SABRINA: Linus!
dialog: Linus! Why didn't you tell me? You do want to take
dialog: me with you, don't you?
text: She shows Linus the tickets.
dialog: LINUS: These don't mean what you think they mean.
dialog: SABRINA: I know why you didn't tell me. Because you think
dialog: it's wrong. They'll say I'm too young for you, there'll
dialog: be a awful scandal, and the market will go down. Linus
dialog: Larrabee Esquire is taking me to Paris.
dialog: LINUS: Sabrina, I... I wasn't going to take you to Paris.
dialog: I was going to send you.
dialog: SABRINA: Alone?
dialog: LINUS: Yes, all alone.
dialog: SABRINA: But there's a ticket for you.
text: LINUS: For an empty cabin.
dialog: SABRINA: You were joining me in Paris, is that it?
dialog: LINUS: I'm afraid not.
dialog: SABRINA: I think I understand.
dialog: LINUS: I'm sorry.
dialog: SABRINA: But why? Why did you do it, Linus?
dialog: LINUS: High finance. Expansion. Marriage. A merger. Anew
dialog: plaque on the Larrabee Building. You got in the way.
speaker_heading: SABRINA: David?
dialog: LINUS: That's right.
dialog: SABRINA: How inconsiderate of me. And how inconvenient for you,
dialog: such a busy man, having to waste so much time to get me
text: on a boat.
dialog: LINUS: I'm ashamed to say I enjoyed every minute of it.
dialog: SABRINA: And I suppose, in your empty cabin, there would have
text: been a farewell note, dictated to and typed by Miss
dialog: McCardle? And perhaps a few flowers.
dialog: LINUS: A little more than that.
text: Linus walks over to his desk and reads off the arrangements.
text: LINUS: A letter of credit. An apartment in Paris. A car.
dialog: 1,500 shares of Larrabee Preferred for your father.
dialog: SABRINA: You're very generous.
dialog: LINUS: We regard it as a necessary business expense.
dialog: SABRINA: I'll just take one of those tickets.
text: Linus hands her a ticket.
speaker_heading: SABRINA:
dialog: I was happy in Paris. I think you would have been,
dialog: too. Good night, Mr. Larrabee. I'm sorry I can't stay

dialog: it, anyway. You did get over David, didn't you?
dialog: SABRINA: Dear David. Yes, I did get over that. I'm cured.
dialog: Now I have to get over the cure!
dialog: FAIRCHILD: It wouldn't have worked out really, darling. The
dialog: papers and everybody else would have said "How fine and

dialog: DAVID: Do what?
text: LINUS: She's all alone out there.
dialog: DAVID: Not according to the afternoon papers.

dialog: LINUS: Did you plant this?
dialog: DAVID: Me? I thought it was common knowledge about you and
dialog: Sabrina.
dialog: ELIZABETH: Who is Sabrina?
dialog: DAVID: Our chauffeur's daughter, that's who she is. Now, how
dialog: about that, gentlemen? Linus Larrabee, wizard of finance,
dialog: man of distinction, chairman of the board of Larrabee
text: Industries, getting mixed up with his chauffeur's daughter.
dialog: LINUS: That's enough, David.
text: DAVID: She went after me for a while, but she switched to Linus.
dialog: I guess it's because he's got more money.
dialog: Now we all know about those kind of girls. Believe me,
dialog: gentlemen, this one is no different, just seems to be.
dialog: LINUS: I said that's enough.
dialog: DAVID: Maybe you got smart, Linus. Or maybe you just got lucky,
dialog: because you're here and she's out there. Brother! She
dialog: would have taken you for plenty.
text: Linus punches David in the face.
dialog: DAVID: I was just helping you make up your mind. You are in
dialog: love with her! What are you waiting for?
text: David throws Linus his hat and umbrella.
text: DAVID: There's an elevator outside, a police escort downstairs
text: and a tugboat standing by at the Larrabee pier. Get moving!
dialog: LINUS: Well, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, it appears I have

dialog: OLIVER: That's the 20th century for you. Automobiles. Garages.
