text: This Superhero (30). Unshaven.
text: Disheveled. Worn. A face

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
text: In the eyes, we can see his soul. Intense. Fierce. An exposed
text: nerve, snagged in a fish hook.
text: He hangs in the air, tired, rain-soaked, pissed-off.
text: He stares down at the earth below and he beholds the saturated
text: visage of SHEEPSHEAD BAY, a seaside Brooklyn neighborhood.
text: And from the bowels of his very soul, this Superhero belches a
text: thunderous ROAR. He pivots in the air and dives toward land.
text: He slices through the downpour, arms extended, body erect,
text: engulfed in the dimensions of his cape.
text: The ground approaches, fast. He accelerates as if to embrace it.
text: Velocity sucks up all remaining space and there is IMPACT.
text: An EXPLOSION as he rips through the street surface, penetrating
text: the asphalt - head first. Debris and concrete spew from the

text: There is an expulsion of subterranean pressure and it launches

text: Rain sloshes against a kitchen window. Where the sink is. Not

scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT
text: A subway TRAM idles by a passenger ramp. STEAM hisses from its
text: side and plumes into a wall of white mist.
text: And from this cloud of angry vapors, a figure appears. He
text: surfaces from the dark subway tunnel, a cool nonchalance in his
text: gait.
text: It is the Superhero, his identity safely concealed under the
text: collar of a tattered TRENCHCOAT. He traverses the loading deck,
text: PASSENGERS boarding and disembarking around him.
text: He wades through them - to a deserted section of the subway. He
text: strolls over to a CIGARETTE MACHINE, up against the grafetti-
text: raped subway wall.
text: On the wall, a line of profanity declares that...
text: "YOUR MOTHER TAKES IT UP THE ASS."
text: He surveys the machine. His right arm appears from the coat
text: pocket. Fingers merge into a tight fist. And casually, he rips
text: into the metal vendor like it was Jello.
text: His fist withdraws a handful of bills, coins. He pockets the
text: loot. He reaches back in and withdraws a carton of LUCKY STRIKE.
text: Deposits it under his coat.
text: And with that, he heads for the stairs - to the flooded streets
dialog: above.
text: At the ramp, and on cue, the subway tram closes its doors.
text: Trembles. Moves. Steams into the deep dark tunnel. White SMOKE
text: mushrooms from its tail. It lingers in the air as we...
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: see STEAM, rising from a faucet of running HOT water.
text: It rises from a sink of soiled dishes - where Mary deposits
text: another set of pots. She's clearing the table.
text: Down a dark hallway, a streak of light escapes from an open

text: Hancock eyes Fish, mentally dissecting the vermin with his bare
text: hands. He withdraws from his coat the WAD of loot. Pushes it
text: under the window.
text: And while Fish collects, he leans into the window and emits a
text: deep GROWL. Fish recoils. The bills fly.
text: Hancock takes the key. Exchanges it with a metal ORB - the
text: strangulated remains of the bell. It rolls out of his palm and
text: CLINKS off the counter.

text: On a bed, sprawled on his back, Aaron gazes up at the empty

text: Aaron brings his hand before his eyes. Looks at it. Studies it.
text: Slowly, his fingers converge into a tight FIST - a boy's

text: The sky answers again, this time with the tattered body of FRED,

text: Everybody ducks. Trash and paper batter about behind his draft.
scene_heading: INT. BANK - DAY
text: Tom and the Jerrys stand shackled in their spots.
text: Their eyes wander about, lost in confusion. The WHIR outside

text: A loaded beat.
text: Tom, in mid-swallow, watches as a spectacular EXPLOSION of

text: in the blink of an eye, Hancock has Jerry #2 by the collar. With

scene_heading: EXT. BANK - DAY
text: Jerry #1 rides air and glass out and across the street into

scene_heading: INT. BANK - DAY
text: Smoke and debris smother the air. And as they subside, all eyes

text: Mary can't believe her eyes. She surveys every inch of his

scene_heading: INT. BANK - DAY
text: The bank floor in shambles. No one in sight. But movement jars

text: Confronts the object inside - Tom.
scene_heading: INT. BANK SAFE - DAY
text: There he is, in the corner, a sweaty piece of misery. Tom bears

speaker_heading: TOM

speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)

speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (HYSTERICAL)
dialog: What're you doing?

speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: (FIRES)

text: It rips Tom's right EAR from his head.
speaker_heading: HANCOCK
dialog: (catching the renegade slug)
dialog: Why'd you go and do that for?

text: And there Aaron is, twisted in a contorted heap of arms and legs
text: - his body eternally locked within the stranglehold of SPENGLER

text: Aaron's face, another BLACK EYE makes it a set. Rage distorts
text: his mouth out of symmetry. He stares at PERCEVAL, before him -

text: We HEAR water, a stream of liquid-something SPLASHING about,
text: SPRAYING. Perceval - he's taking a leak on Aaron's exposed leg.
scene_heading: EXT. BANK - DAY

speaker_heading: JUMPER'
speaker_heading: (SELF-PITY)

text: His mother's FREAKING from the window.
text: Below, the crowd makes its way across the street. They point and
text: gasp at the infant's every movement - leaving the jumper by his

text: The baby teeters along the edge. It heads for a FLAG pole,
text: dazzled by the red-white-and-blue. It reaches out at fabric.
text: Almost. Not quite. The baby DROPS from the precipice.
text: On the street, people CHOKE on their tongues as gravity pulls
text: the infant down.
text: But wait... Hancock swoops out of the thin blue, swift and
text: silent. He cradles the baby from utter concrete.
text: He deposits the youngster with.the ecstatic crowd - they, of
text: mostly the FEMALE persuasion, all form around the savior.
text: We SEE in the background and across the street, the Jumper nose-
text: diving into the sidewalk - without much fanfare.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY

scene_heading: INT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT
text: A room, a place we don't know. It's dark save the street light

speaker_heading: (SUPER-PSYCHOTIC)
dialog: What are you thinking?

speaker_heading: (FAINTLY)
dialog: And so we ask... who is this man?
dialog: Speculation abounds - government super-

dialog: Where are you now, superguy? Call me.
speaker_heading: (SMILES)
dialog: We'll get together. Have a drink.
scene_heading: INT. BAR - NIGHT
text: HADES - a smoky bar in the armpit of town.
text: NEON beer signs. POOL tables. CIGARETTE machines. This is home
dialog: to mean people, tough guys - children of a fucked-up god.
text: We cut through the nicotine air to find the bar. A figure
text: hunches on the far end, smoking. Popping vodka like mountain
text: water in Dixie cups.
text: It's Hancock and his trenchcoat. The long day wears heavy on his
text: face - those perpetually red eyes, the horror they've seen.
speaker_heading: HANCOCK
speaker_heading: (MUTTERING)
dialog: What he's got to do... a man's got to do
dialog: it.
scene_heading: EXT. BAR - NIGHT
text: Hancock stumbles out, incognito, frazzled under his guise. Up
text: above, the sky - so dark under the storm clouds.
text: We HEAR commotion in the side alley. And so does Hancock. He
text: peers into the alley.
text: There, by a lighted PHONE BOOTH, a WHORE is fending off a horny
text: JOHN. Hancock simply watches she drives her knee between his
text: legs. He drops. SQUEALS like a little girl.
text: The John finds a two-by-four in the dirt. He reaches for it...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 38.
text: A COUGH stops him - it's Hancock and he discourages further
dialog: violence.
text: Up and out of the alley, the John flees - tail, between his
dialog: legs.
text: A long stare ensues - Hancock and the Whore, looking into each
text: other's eyes for answers.
text: The Whore approaches him. Touches his face - studies it. Moves
text: it into the light.
speaker_heading: WHORE
dialog: (the sage)
dialog: You've been to Hell, it looks. And you're
dialog: tired...
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: and in need.

text: Hands it to him.
speaker_heading: WHORE (CONY' D)

scene_heading: EXT. SKY - NIGHT
text: From the black night - a dark figure plummets, caroms off the

text: into the trash cans below.
text: Hancock stumbles from the wreckage, the garbage. Falls. He leans
text: against the building, glazed over with drunkenness.
text: He turns to the only source of light that of a building across
text: the street: KILLYBEGS TEXTILES, looming above the rest. Boarded-

scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
text: Something overcomes this fevered superman. He begins to unravel.

speaker_heading: MARY (V.O.)
dialog: "Golden slumber fills your eyes. Smiles

text: Aaron cuts into an alley, lungs pumping...
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY - DAY

text: They converge, baffled. Erlick inspects the solid wall. Spengler
text: scratches his head. But'Perceval's no fool. He spots the trash
dialog: can.
text: He motions the fellas over. They circle the can. A beat. They
text: ATTACK... an empty can. No one inside. Nothing.
dialog: That's because above them, no strings and no cables, Aaron
text: hovers - under Hancock's capable arm.
text: In mid-air, they hang for a second. Then, Hancock takes them

text: He reaches for his belt. Pulls out a cigarette. Lights it.
speaker_heading: HANCOCK
dialog: You smoke?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: What?
dialog:

speaker_heading: HANCOCK

speaker_heading: HANCOCK (CONT'D)

text: Aaron under pressure, acquiesces. He takes the stick. Sucks on

speaker_heading: HANCOCK (CONT'D)
dialog: Good, huh? Tastes like compost... your

speaker_heading: (BEAT)

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Principles?
speaker_heading: HANCOCK
dialog: Principles. Here's one; very simple. Just
dialog: about all you need to know: a man's got
dialog: to do what a man's got to do.
dialog: (beat; smokes)
dialog: I look at your face, the shiners. You
dialog: took a shove and you let it go clean. Not
dialog: good. That's a formula for future
dialog: abuse... an invitation to the loser's

dialog: ,(shakes head)
dialog: Bad policy. Won't be long 'fore you're

speaker_heading: AARON

speaker_heading: AARON

speaker_heading: HANCOCK
dialog: What is necessary.
speaker_heading: (HEAT)
dialog: Let me tell you something, kid. There was

dialog: outnumbered.
dialog: (thinks about it)
dialog: Wait, let me put it in kid terms. So you
dialog: relate, OK? There's a fox, you relate? A
dialog: fox and he's walking through what, the
dialog: woods, the forests, right? Next thing the
text: fox knows, he's staring down a pack of...
dialog: hounds. Bloodhounds. And there's this
text: chase, the fox's running his ass off,
text: over boulders and through streams and,
dialog: but the damn hounds are still on his
text: tail. Finally the fox comes to this
dialog: cliff, a precipice... and it's what, a
text: seven hundred foot drop onto jagged
dialog: rocks. He's in trouble 'cause the hounds
dialog: are closing in and they're going to tear
dialog: him to pieces. So what does he think...
dialog: "I jump and I die for sure. I stay,
dialog: confront them and I'll get my ass
text: butchered." Decision time. He thinks,
dialog: "stay and least I'd have something, a

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: The hounds come. What do you think
dialog: happens?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: (thinking about it)
text: He gets away.
text: Hancock inhales what's left of his cigarette. Blows smoke.
speaker_heading: HANCOCK
text: No. The fox gets his ass kicked and
dialog: some... I mean ripped apart by the dogs,
text: like cheap fabric.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: What're you saying?
speaker_heading: HANCOCK
dialog: But you know, when the last hound was
text: through with him,-and he's walking away,
dialog: he hears this noise. It's the fox and
text: he's muttering something under his
text: breath... words. The dog goes over. Gets
dialog: up close. To hear what he's saying. You
dialog: know what the fox's saying... just before
dialog: he keels off?
dialog: Aaron - negative.
speaker_heading: HANCOCK (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
text: Now he's gurgling, choking on his own
dialog: blood, right? A massacre. The fox's lying
dialog: next to his entrails, you know... and you
dialog: know what he says?
text: (raises his fist in the air)
dialog: "No regrets."
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HANCOCK
dialog: No regrets. You make a decision and you
dialog: stick to it. Like a man's got to do. And
