text: This is December 24, 1944, in the first safe area directly
text: behind the battle line, in the Italian theatre.
text: In the distance occasional artillery light flashes are seen
text: and artillery rumbles are heard. The battered terrain shows
dialog: the effects of battle.
text: In the foreground is a recreation area, covered with
text: camouflage; entertainment is in progress on a raised stage.
text: Men of the division are seated about on benches, boxes, and
text: the ground. A camouflaged motor pool of jeeps and tanks is
dialog: nearby.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - NEAR RECREATION AREA
text: We can HEAR LAUGHTER and APPLAUSE from the men as a jeep
text: with two stars on the front indicating it is the General's
text: car jounces along a road toward the side of the recreation
text: area. A YOUNG SERGEANT is at the wheel, an ADJUTANT beside
text: him, and in the rear are GENERAL WAVERLY and GENERAL CARLTON.
scene_heading: JEEP - MED. CLOSE
text: As it jounces along. General Waverly is weather-beaten and
text: weary; his uniform, while neat, shows the effects of long
text: wear. General Carlton, on the other hand, is stiff, clean
text: and fresh from the Pentagon.
text: He is staring off at the recreation area.
speaker_heading: GENERAL CARLTON
dialog: (To Adjutant)
dialog: What's this all about, Colonel?
speaker_heading: ADJUTANT
dialog: (Turning)
dialog: A little entertainment for the men,
dialog: sir. Tonight's Christmas Eve.
speaker_heading: GENERAL CARLTON
dialog: These men are moving up tonight.
dialog: They should be lined up for full
dialog: inspection!
text: The jeep has come to a halt.
speaker_heading: GENERAL WAVERLY
dialog: (Eyeing him)
dialog: You're absolutely right.
dialog: (To Adjutant)
dialog: There's no Christmas in the Army,
dialog: Colonel.
speaker_heading: ADJUTANT
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Waverly and the Adjutant alight from the jeep.
speaker_heading: GENERAL WAVERLY
dialog: (To Carlton)
dialog: There's always a slip-up or two during
text: a change in command. The men get a
dialog: little loose. But I know I'm leaving
dialog: them in good hands.
speaker_heading: GENERAL CARLTON
dialog: (Stiffly)
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (To Driver)
dialog: Sergeant, take me to headquarters
dialog: immediately! We'll have those men
dialog: turned out on the double!
text: The Sergeant looks at General Waverly.
speaker_heading: GENERAL WAVERLY
dialog: Goodbye, Sergeant. Take the short
dialog: cut.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Yes, sir!
text: The jeep pulls off and makes a half circle. The Adjutant
text: makes a gesture, as if to stop it. The General stops him.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - GENERAL WAVERLY AND ADJUTANT
text: The Adjutant turns to him.
speaker_heading: ADJUTANT
dialog: That's not the way to headquarters!
speaker_heading: GENERAL WAVERLY
dialog: Joe, you know that, and I know that,
text: but the new General doesn't know it.
dialog: Or he won't for about an hour and a
dialog: half.
speaker_heading: ADJUTANT
dialog: That Sergeant'll be a private
dialog: tomorrow!
speaker_heading: GENERAL WAVERLY
dialog: Yes... isn't he lucky?
text: He takes the Adjutant by the arm and leads him toward the
dialog: recreation area.
scene_heading: RAISED PLATFORM - MED. SHOT
text: CAPTAIN BOB WALLACE (BING CROSBY) is wearing a makeshift

scene_heading: TWO SHOT - GENERAL AND ADJUTANT
text: The General notices them - motions for them to sit down again,

dialog: 5D.
scene_heading: PLATFORM - FULL SHOT
text: The number concludes to applause. Bob holds up his hand for
text: silence. He removes his beard.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Thanks, fellows. I guess by now you
dialog: know the Old Man's being replaced by
dialog: a new Commanding General fresh out
dialog: of the Pentagon... this divisions's
dialog: been awfully lucky so far, but tonight
dialog: they're running a special on St.
text: Christophers at the PX... The Old
text: Man's heading back to the rear -
dialog: he's never moved in that direction
dialog: in his life. All I can say is, we
dialog: owe so much to General Waverly and
dialog: the way --
speaker_heading: WAVERLY'S VOICE
dialog: (A bellow)
speaker_heading: ATTENTION!
text: Automatically, Bob stiffens. Phil does the same.
scene_heading: AUDIENCE - FULL SHOT
text: Every man is at attention and every head has turned to where
text: General Waverly has taken up a position near the front of
dialog: the platform.
speaker_heading: GENERAL WAVERLY
dialog: Captain Wallace, button your shirt.
dialog: You're out of uniform!
dialog: (Bob, grinning, hastily
dialog: buttons his shirt)
dialog: This division is now under the command
dialog: of General Harold G. Carlton, and I
dialog: don't want anyone to forget it --
dialog: not that he'll let you. He's tough --
dialog: just what this sloppy outfit needs.
dialog: You'll be standing inspection night
dialog: and day -- you may even learn how to
dialog: march. And if you don't give him
dialog: everything you got, I may come back
dialog: and fight for the enemy. Merry
dialog: Christmas!
text: The boys respond with "Merry Christmas".
speaker_heading: GENERAL WAVERLY
dialog: (Embarrassed)
dialog: Well -- I guess that's about it - uh -
dialog: uh --
text: Bob, covering his embarrassment:
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Perhaps I can help you out, sir.
text: He turns to the musicians, gives the downbeat. They play
text: THE OLD MAN, which is sung by the entire outfit.
text: The General stands at attention through the first chorus,
text: visibly moved. During the second chorus he starts up the
text: aisle, revealing for the first time that his left leg is
text: bandaged to the knee. The Adjutant puts out his arm to help.
text: Waverly refuses. Toward the finish of the song, he turns,
text: faces the men and salutes them. The men return the salute.
dialog: (This is not a military mistake, the General salutes the
text: enlisted men as a deliberate gesture.) There is a Red Cross
text: ambulance standing by.

text: THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a hand lighting a candle on
text: a tiny makeshift Christmas tree. We reveal a number of

text: Bob and Phil. One of the men looks at his wristwatch. Now
dialog: another does.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - WRISTWATCH
text: The hand is approaching midnight.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - SOLDIER

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - WRISTWATCH

scene_heading: FULL SHOT OF SCENE
text: This is the prearranged signal for Bob to begin singing WHITE
text: CHRISTMAS. Phil accompanies him on a harmonica. Toward the
text: end of the song, an enemy barrage DROWNS out the music. A
text: shell BURSTS in the vicinity.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND PHIL
text: Phil pulls Bob down in time to save him from the shrapnel
text: burst. This has also pushed Bob's face into the mud, which
text: he thinks is unnecessary. Phil, ignoring Bob's hostile look,
text: brightly continues with WHITE CHRISTMAS from where the song
text: left off. Bob finishes with him, but eyeing him.

scene_heading: MED. SHOT - INT. THEATRE - AUDIENCE
text: Perhaps twenty people, photographed at a slant. They're

dialog: stars in New York.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Listen, I just heard what you're
dialog: doing -- giving the cast a week off
dialog: with pay for Christmas. You don't
dialog: know how touched I am. I'm all choked

text: Rita shows up in front of Phil.
speaker_heading: RITA

dialog: You said you had something to rehearse
dialog: with me after the show. What is it?
text: Phil evidently was trying to hide this from Bob and is self-

speaker_heading: PHIL
text: It's a kind of new dance number.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (Eagerly)
dialog: I'm ready.
speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: You were sneaky enough to take it.
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE SHOT - BETTY AND JUDY
text: Betty looks from the tickets and sees that Judy is covertly

dialog: Phil. A little louder)
dialog: Ahem! All right dear, relax.
speaker_heading: JUDY

dialog: in Waco, Texas.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: (Mock seriousness)
dialog: Canton, Ohio wasn't so much.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: One of these days you're going to
dialog: meet somebody extra cute and the

speaker_heading: JUDY

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Shoot.
speaker_heading: PHIL
text: Four feet two inches tall. Pudgy.
dialog: Round races. Have big bows in their
dialog: hair. Always smiling.
dialog: (He parodies a smile)
dialog: Lots of teeth. Sister acts have
dialog: more teeth than anybody else. Two,
dialog: three hundred teeth at a time. The
dialog: American Dental Association is
dialog: investigating it.
text: There is a drum roll from the orchestra. Betty takes off
text: her glasses and puts them in their case, on the bar. The

dialog: her! The girl in the oxygen tent!
dialog: I told you about her! The road
dialog: company of "Student Prince." The
dialog: whole company went to church and
dialog: prayed for her! It was the most
dialog: touching thing I've ever seen in
dialog: show business.
speaker_heading: (HE GETS UP.)

speaker_heading: JUDY

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Vermont? What's there?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Snow. We spent last Christmas in
dialog: South Carolina, the year before in
dialog: Hawaii. They didn't seem like
dialog: Christmases. There ought to be snow.
dialog: This one's going to be real white.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well, it's the way you've been raised.
dialog: If you saw a lot of snow when you
dialog: were a kid you miss it more around
dialog: Christmas. There's a lot of snow
dialog: around St. Paul.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Is that where you come from - St.
dialog: Paul?
text: It dawns on him, slowly. He shows no emotion.
speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: JUDY

speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: BETTY

speaker_heading: PHIL

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What I admire are the details, the

dialog: the big one. It takes talent.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Oh, it's nothing.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Don't say that. Don't belittle

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I'm positive. I trained her myself.
speaker_heading: BOB
text: She's in the ring with the champ,

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Well, you keep an eye on him, and

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Fine. We can make out the probation

text: The orchestra blends into a vocal chorus of the song. (To
text: be decided upon.) The vocal is shared by Bob, Betty, Judy
text: and Phil, individually. Toward the end of the vocal Phil
text: dances Judy out to the terrace overlooking the water. This
text: blends into their dance. The staging of the number should

speaker_heading: NOVELLO
dialog: Yes, don't get excited, you still

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: That's considerate! How'd you arrange
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: NOVELLO
dialog: I'm a taxpayer here! You better go
dialog: in and change, girls! You haven't
dialog: much time!
text: The girls start off, confused. Novello, Bob and Phil follow.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: May I enquire what you are being
dialog: arrested for?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: The owner of the hotel we were at
dialog: says we dropped a cigarette on his
dialog: rug and burned it.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: We couldn't have dropped a cigarette
dialog: because we don't smoke.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: He wants two hundred dollars, but
dialog: it's just plain stealing.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: We left the money for our bill in an

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Then we dropped the bags out the

dialog: You have to give another show.

speaker_heading: PHIL
text: The old burned rug routine.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Kind of old fashioned, isn't it?
dialog: I thought that went out with the
dialog: Cherry Sisters. We'll have to do
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (Hopefully)
dialog: Got a flash?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: A glimmer. Have to stir it around a

speaker_heading: LANDLORD
dialog: That's the second dessert you've
dialog: had, Sheriff!
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Real good, too.
speaker_heading: LANDLORD
dialog: I haven't got all night to wait here
dialog: while you eat free food! You've got
dialog: your warrant, arrest those girls!
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: (Displeased)
dialog: Now, we agreed to let them finish
dialog: their show first.
speaker_heading: LANDLORD
dialog: I didn't agree!
dialog: (To Novello)
dialog: That was his idea!
speaker_heading: NOVELLO
dialog: I've got some rights, too. You don't
dialog: get those girls until after they've
dialog: done their number!
speaker_heading: LANDLORD
dialog: Well, how long is it going to take?
text: Novello puts his hand up, listening.
speaker_heading: NOVELLO
dialog: Wait a minute! That's their music!
text: He gets up, opens the office door, and we HEAR their entrance
text: music, as before, and the Orchestra Leader's voice, "The

scene_heading: MED. SHOT - CAFE FLOOR
text: Bob and Phil stand with their backs to the audience.

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Get out of these clothes! Toot sweet!
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Ma, unhook my bra!
text: The office door opens behind them, which they do not see.
text: The Sheriff steps out, followed by the Landlord and Novello.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: (Calm)
dialog: Just a second, folks! I'll handle
dialog: this!
text: (He walks to the
dialog: dressing room door)
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE SHOT - DRESSING ROOM DOOR

speaker_heading: SHERIFF

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Okay, boss.
text: The Sheriff continues to the window of our dressing room.
scene_heading: MED CLOSE SHOT - DRESSING ROOM WINDOW
text: It opens. The Sheriff watches it. Out comes Phil's legs,
text: meaning to get out backwards. The Sheriff applies both hands
text: and pushes back.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Back you go, boys!
text: He pushes Phil in. Nimbly, he raises himself in.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - INT. DRESSING ROOM
text: The Sheriff is in the room. He looks coolly at the boys,
text: who are now in their own clothes. He stares at them. They
text: stare at him. Recognition comes all at once.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Pete!
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Phil! Bob!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Pete!
text: They all throw their arms around each other, pounding
dialog: violently. 'No! Wow! You dirty skunk! You grave robber!'
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (Unbelieving)
dialog: Are you the Sheriff here?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: You bet I am!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: How'd you get in this line of work?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: After I got out of the army I sat
dialog: down and figured it out! Who never
dialog: got in trouble in the army? The
dialog: M.P.'s! They were the ones who
dialog: arrested you! So I came back here
dialog: and ran for Sheriff!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: A civilian M.P.! If the fellows
dialog: ever saw you now! They'd skin you
dialog: alive!
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: You ever see any of them?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Whitey Harris and Jack Ross have a
dialog: filling station near here!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Jack Ross! Will you ever forget the
dialog: party he threw in Naples?
speaker_heading: PHIL
text: In a captured brewery. Very sensible,
text: giving a party in a brewery. Cuts
text: out the middleman.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Do you remember when Danny Beasly
dialog: climbed up -
dialog: (As he says 'Danny
dialog: Beasly' he recalls
dialog: Danny is dead)
dialog: - the tower of the City Hall and
text: rang the bell by swinging on the
text: clapper? He couldn't hear anything
dialog: for two days.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Danny Beasly! Too bad he didn't
dialog: make it.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Not everybody was lucky.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: We were lucky in one thing - the old
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: You can say that again. Say I'm
dialog: supposed to arrest a couple of dames!
dialog: A fellow swore out a warrant!
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: He's a crook! Burned a hole in a
text: rug and is trying to hold up two
dialog: kids.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: You don't say!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (At his watch)
dialog: We got to get our bags and be at the

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Do you think we can make it?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: This thing goes over a hundred an
dialog: hour! Hold on!
text: He starts with his red lights going, his siren screaming,
text: and tires grinding.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - INT. DRESSING ROOM
text: The Sheriff watches them go, pleased. A pounding on the
text: door recalls the Landlord, and he frowns. He strides to the
text: door, takes out his key and opens it.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - CORRIDOR
text: The Landlord and Novello are looking out the window at the
text: departing police car, the noise having distracted them from
text: the door pounding. The siren is still heard, retreating.
text: The Sheriff snaps his cigarette at their feet. They turn to
text: him, faces alight.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: They escaped! We're pursuing 'em!
speaker_heading: LANDLORD
dialog: Escaped!
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: (Pointing)
dialog: What do you mean smoking on theatrical
dialog: premises!
speaker_heading: LANDLORD
dialog: That's not mine! I wasn't smoking!
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: What's that burning? A lollypop?
text: (He grabs him by the
dialog: shoulder, not too
text: gently, and starts
dialog: him out)
dialog: Come on!
text: He protests, 'What - !' 'But!' Novello is openmouthed.
speaker_heading: WIPE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STATION - (NIGHT)
text: The train is already moving as the police car arrives.
text: The girls are on the observation platform. The police car

text: make the train, the girls pulling them aboard.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: (Seriously)
dialog: You didn't steal the police car?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: No, no. Friend of ours.

dialog: accomplished their escape.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well, we'll be together as far as

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Maybe it'll snow in New York for
dialog: Christmas. If it doesn't, we'll
dialog: mail you a snowball from Vermont.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I haven't been on ice skates in years.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Ice? You mean the stuff in a Scotch
dialog: and soda?
dialog: (Suddenly)
dialog: Bob, how about snow for Christmas?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You'll only thaw it out.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Come on, Bob, we could have a great
dialog: week up in Vermont.
text: Bob looks from him to Judy, whose expression is almost
dialog: pleading.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I see what you mean. But Wednesday
dialog: we've got to be back in New York.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: All right -- so it's just for a couple
dialog: of days. Don't you want me to enjoy
dialog: the winter sports?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You enjoy them all year round.
dialog: (He looks to Betty)
dialog: We won't get in your way, will we?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: As long as your friend doesn't try
dialog: to take my sister for a sleigh ride.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: If he tries it, I'll smash his
dialog: flexible flyer.
dialog: (To Phil)
text: It's all set.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (Really pleased)
dialog: The thing I like about you, Bob, is
dialog: you're not only kind and generous,
dialog: you're handsome.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: We're going to have to sit up all
dialog: night. Let's get some shut eye.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - EXT. TRAIN - (NIGHT)
text: The rhythm of the wheels and the engine funnel, underscored
dialog: musically.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - INT. TRAIN
text: All but Phil are half dozing. One or two other people are
text: seen in the background, asleep. There is an air of peace
text: and quiet in the car, as the music underscoring continues.
text: Their faces are occasionally streaked with light flashes
text: emanating from the surrounding countryside. Phil turns to
text: the side of the car and sees a bill poster showing a copy of
text: a winter scene from the Grandma Moses collection, advertising
text: Vermont. CAMERA PULLS UP TO scene, the music swells and we
text: DISSOLVE to a similar landscape in stylized concept. This

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Are you sure this is the right
dialog: Vermont?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: This isn't a southern Vermont?
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I don't understand it.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: There has to be snow! This place is

speaker_heading: BOB

scene_heading: MED. SHOT - INT. COLUMBIA INN
text: MARTHA, a sixty year old spinsterish woman, good of heart,
text: forbidding exterior, is occupied at the desk.
text: The door opens and a pretty fifteen year old, SUSAN, carrying
text: the mail, walks toward her.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Mail, Martha.
text: She puts the mail on the desk.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
text: (As she shuffles
dialog: through it)
dialog: What's the weather forecast down at

speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Awful. Fair and warmer.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: If we don't get snow soon we can
dialog: turn this hotel into a haunted house.
dialog: We haven't had a guest for three
dialog: weeks.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (As Martha keeps
dialog: searching through
dialog: the mail)
dialog: What are you looking for?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (Not finding it)
dialog: Your grandfather's written Washington
dialog: asking if he can get back in active
dialog: service. I think he wants to fly
dialog: jets.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I think he could do it.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: He says older men have been called,
dialog: and besides, he misses the food. I
dialog: tell you, Susan, he tried to make it
text: a casual letter, with little jokes,
dialog: but it came out just begging.
text: Through the huge window behind Susan and Martha we see the
text: figure of a man in overalls, bending over an incinerator,
text: shoveling the ashes into a wheelbarrow.
text: His back is to CAMERA.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (Moved)
dialog: Oh, Martha! What are we going to
dialog: do?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (Blowing her nose)
dialog: I don't know. Don't let on we know
dialog: he's written. He'll start in I'm
dialog: only his housekeeper and that I found
dialog: out through some chicanery or
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (Soothing her)
dialog: How did you find out?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Like any housekeeper -- I read the
dialog: carbon paper.
dialog: (She hands the mail
dialog: to Susan)
dialog: Bring him the mail.
text: Susan starts out as CAMERA MOVES UP to window. After a
text: moment, Susan appears and crosses to the man in overalls.
text: He straightens up, dusts off his hands, and as he turns to
text: take the letters, we see for the first time that he is General
text: Waverly. He looks through them, eagerly, then, downcast,
text: shoves them in his overalls and goes back to his work.

speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: How do you do?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (Offering pen)
dialog: What kind of accommodations would
dialog: you like? We can give you a fairly
dialog: wide choice--any room in the Inn,

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: We're not here as guests. We're the

speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (Disappointed)
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: My friend and I are guests. We've

speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: We take it in during the day!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (Looking around)
dialog: What are your rates here?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Make us an offer.
dialog: (To the girls)
dialog: I'm afraid we won't be able to use
dialog: you. We'll pay you the half salary
dialog: for canceling.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Oh, no! Are things that bad?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: We're using the ski-tow to hang the

dialog: (To Bob)
dialog: You're not going to stay either, are
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (Shaking his head)
dialog: I'm afraid not, ma'am.
text: Through the door comes Waverly, carrying a load of wood in

text: Bob turns away.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'll tell Phil to leave the luggage -
dialog: (It hits him, he comes

dialog: General Waverly! Sir!
speaker_heading: WAVERLY
dialog: (Easy, simple)
dialog: At ease! How are you, Captain.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'm fine, sir.

speaker_heading: WAVERLY
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: We just try to keep the General part
dialog: quiet.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Why?
dialog: (Reminding himself)
dialog: Begging your pardon, sir.
speaker_heading: WAVERLY
dialog: Well, to put it in one sentence,
dialog: people don't expect major generals
dialog: to carry firewood.
text: Through the door comes Phil, fast, talking:
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Bob, I was thinking we ought to -
text: Phil has his arm out indicating the direction of the door,
text: when he sees Waverly. He freezes. He brings his hand up to
text: a salute, from that position.
speaker_heading: WAVERLY
dialog: At ease!
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Oh, sir!
dialog: (Horrified)
dialog: A janitor!
speaker_heading: WAVERLY
dialog: Never thought I'd make it, he?
dialog: ...Matter of fact, it's worse than
dialog: that. I own this hotel.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: He got it in a shrewd business move.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (To Bob)
dialog: Was everybody in your outfit? We

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: The Draft Board didn't know when to

speaker_heading: WAVERLY
dialog: If I start the introductions, can I

dialog: (Indicating them)
dialog: My housekeeper, Miss Martha Allen,

speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: MARTHA

dialog: Don't worry -- I've already told

speaker_heading: WAVERLY
dialog: Why? We have a floor, haven't we?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Last time I looked. But who are
dialog: they going to sing to?
speaker_heading: WAVERLY
dialog: Even if it's only to you and me, it
dialog: will be well worth it. Besides,
dialog: there will be six inches of snow
dialog: tonight and we'll be full up tomorrow.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (Happily)
dialog: Is that the weather forecast?
speaker_heading: WAVERLY
dialog: No. But if there was one thing I
dialog: learned in the army it was to be
dialog: positive -- especially when you don't
dialog: know what you're talking about. You'll

dialog: Yes, sir!
speaker_heading: WAVERLY
dialog: (To Betty and Judy)
dialog: And you two charming ladies, I want

dialog: Incidentally, how much will this
dialog: cost?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (Clears his throat)
dialog: We are coming out - even.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: You mean flat?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: That's the same as even.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Wheels within wheels. It's nice how
dialog: you take care of the money for both
dialog: of us because you're older and so
dialog: level headed. I wonder where I'd be
dialog: now if hadn't saved your life?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Do you want me to cancel the troupe
dialog: coming?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (Getting off the desk)
dialog: No, no. Let's go through the gesture.
dialog: If you had been on the Titanic when
dialog: it went down, you wouldn't've been
text: satisfied just to sink into the ocean.

text: The scene is a melee of the excitement accompanying
text: preparations for the show. The little stage has been enlarged -
text: the draperies pulled back right and left and a side wall
text: pushed back a little farther. There is hammering and painting
text: going on in various parts of the room. Trunks have been
text: unpacked and wardrobe hung up in odd places, as more trunks
text: arrive. Girls in abbreviated rehearsal clothes walk around,
text: do cartwheels; two people sing at the piano; six girls kick
text: in unison; altogether, it is quite a contrast to the bareness
text: of the previous scene.
text: THE CAMERA TRUCKS through all the activity, taking in our
text: group at the doorway, which features Bob and Phil, the girls
text: standing nearby. Martha and Susan are amazed at the activity.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I can't believe it! You mean you
dialog: brought the whole show up here?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: When you hired the Stewart sisters
dialog: you also hired a New York show. It
text: was in the small print.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: And you can't get out of it. We've
dialog: got lawyers.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I can't thank you enough, but I wonder
dialog: if Gramp'll let you do it?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: MARTHA

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Now just a second. We're not doing
dialog: this for him!
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Oh no! We're bringing the show down
dialog: here to rehearse!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: The company's been getting a little
dialog: ragged. We'd appreciate the use of
dialog: the hall.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Of course we don't expect it free!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: We'll pay a little, but not much. -
dialog: You see, the audience will be guinea-
dialog: pigs -- and for us, that's quite an
dialog: improvement.
text: This has not fooled Susan. She throws her arms around Bob
dialog: and then Phil.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I don't know what to say!
text: She cannot refrain from tears of gratitude and turns and
text: runs out. There is a moment of silence.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I hope this is not an indication of
text: advancing age, getting kissed out of
dialog: gratitude.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: You didn't expect a girl that pretty
dialog: to kiss you because she wanted to?
speaker_heading: BOB
text: A body keeps hoping.
text: Betty steps up to him and gives him the biggest smack.
text: Bob is quite surprised.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (Sincerely)
dialog: That was the nicest thing I ever saw
dialog: anybody do.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: It was still gratitude.
speaker_heading: PHIL

dialog: I'm his partner. I'm entitled to
dialog: half the credit.

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (Not too good a job)
dialog: Well, sir. We have this show, and

speaker_heading: PHIL

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well, sir, this nice empty room.
dialog: The minute we looked at it we said
dialog: it was ideal. Didn't we?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: That's what we said. Ideal.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: And then we'll have an audience to
dialog: play to. You see, sir, you need an
dialog: audience on which to try out your
dialog: new material.
speaker_heading: WAVERLY
dialog: Where are you going to get the
dialog: audience?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Oh, what guests there are in the
dialog: other hotels. They're pretty bored
dialog: here without snow, and a New York
dialog: show's kind of a novelty in Vermont.
speaker_heading: WAVERLY
dialog: I would think so.
dialog: (He thinks)
dialog: How will they know you're here?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Oh, word gets around.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Yes sir, and we also took the girls
dialog: twice around the town for a little

speaker_heading: BOB AND PHIL

speaker_heading: PHIL

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: It just takes time.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: We wouldn't be any good as generals.
speaker_heading: WAVERLY

dialog: (Friendly, not

dialog: You know your trouble, Betty? You're

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (An effort)
dialog: And Bob?
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: He's different, deeper, and he's
dialog: funny, too. It'd be nice to be

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Good thing they're not a quartette.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: (Oblivious)
dialog: If I was Catherine the Great, that's

dialog: other way around?
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - JUDY AND BETTY
dialog: SHOOTING PAST Betty. Is it possible our Betty has a suspicion
dialog: of a tear?
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Phil'd be more fun in a night club,
dialog: but eventually a girl wants a pipe
dialog: and slipper fellow. That's Bob,
text: smoking a pipe and petting a cocker
dialog: spaniel. Still, Phil could learn to
text: smoke a pipe. Breaking a fellow in

text: She is looking toward the window. As the curtains billow
text: outward we see a diffused figure of Bob, sitting on a fence,
text: putting out his pipe. This is followed by an equally diffused
text: figure of Betty, leaving her bed, crossing the furniture,
text: and joining Bob. Bob takes her in his arms. At this point

speaker_heading: BETTY

speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (Amused)
dialog: How's that?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Different foods make for different

dialog: it in the American Medical Journal
dialog: under 'W'. Ham and Swiss cheese,

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: It is my pleasure to identify the
text: man who has been doing the chasing.
dialog: I am him! - Or he! - Or it! Anyway,
dialog: Judy has caught me. What I'm trying
dialog: to say is, we're engaged.
text: He looks fondly at Judy, taking it for granted she is
text: overwhelmed at this method of announcing to her that he is
text: going to marry her. He hugs her amidst a general reaction
dialog: of congratulations.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - BOB
text: He is flabbergasted.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - GROUP
text: Phil and Judy are separated by the congratulators.
text: Betty, hiding her emotion, grips Phil's arm.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I hope you realize that you're getting
dialog: he most wonderful girl in the world.
text: Bob sees her emotion through the speech. Betty notices Judy
text: upset, shaking off the people around her and running through
text: the doorway to the kitchen.
text: Betty makes her way through the crowd to follow her, as the
text: orchestra goes into HER COMES THE BRIDE.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - INT. KITCHEN
text: Judy is crying into her hands as Betty enters.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Darling, don't cry.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: (Turning to her)
dialog: I didn't know he was going to make
dialog: that announcement, I swear I didn't.
text: Betty puts one arm around her.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I know you didn't.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: He had no right to do that.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: You do love him, don't you?
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: That doesn't matter.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Nothing else matters.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: We're not going to break up our act.
text: Phil enters the kitchen.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: I've been looking for you, Judy.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Excuse me.
text: She goes through the corridor toward the living room.
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE SHOT - CORRIDOR OFF BUTLER'S PANTRY
text: In the background we see the General in the butler's pantry
text: getting some drinks for the guests. He is not seen by Betty
text: who stops at the mirror in the corridor to wipe away a few
text: tears. Bob comes into view in the mirror, entering the
text: corridor from the living room.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Don't take this too much to heart.
dialog: Phil is a great kid but constancy
text: isn't his long suit.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I'm not the least bit worried.
dialog: (Phil and Judy enter
dialog: from the kitchen)
dialog: Frankly, this couldn't come at a
dialog: better time. They want me to come
dialog: back to The Carousel again - I used
dialog: to sing there before Judy and I teamed
dialog: up - and I had to turn it down because
dialog: they can only use a single.
dialog: (Not too well)
dialog: So - this couldn't be more convenient.
dialog: You stay with the show and I'll go
text: back to The Carousel.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: When did you get this offer?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Just today, as a matter of fact. I
dialog: got a telegram.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Why didn't you mention it before?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I didn't want to hurt your feelings.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Where is the telegram?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I threw it away. What is this, a
dialog: third degree? You don't think I
dialog: made it up?
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Yes, I do.
text: There is a pause, and Waverly, who has been watching each
dialog: one, speaks.
speaker_heading: WAVERLY
dialog: Well now, I wouldn't bet any large
dialog: sum of money on that, since I took
text: the message over the telephone, and
dialog: I had to deliver the telegram.
dialog: (To take the tension
dialog: off)
dialog: And she didn't tip me, either.
text: Betty looks at him gratefully.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Oh, Betty!
text: (She throws her arms
dialog: around her)
dialog: I'm sorry! I misunderstood!
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Now, baby! It's all right!
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Well, everything's fine now!
text: Happy, he beams at Judy.
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND WAVERLY

text: him watching Betty.
scene_heading: SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - RAILROAD STATION - DAY
text: Train about to leave. The General is in the foreground

speaker_heading: GENERAL
text: (Shouting over noise

dialog: Where are you going to be?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: The Carousel.
text: The General looks at her, questioningly.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (Whispering, during a
dialog: lull in the noise)
dialog: I sent them a telegram this morning.
text: The General smiles; Betty waves a farewell to him and crosses
text: to the train, starting up the steps. The notion behind this
text: scene is to be able to hear only intermittent dialogue due
text: to the whistle, bells, and escaping steam. The manner of
dialog: playing, though, indicates the sentiment. To emphasize it:
text: Bob is fonder of Betty than he realizes, and Betty fully
text: realizes how fond she is of him but that he does not return,
text: consciously, her affection. We hear Betty:
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Take care of my little sister.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: She can take care of herself. Worry
dialog: about the menfolk. Now don't forget
dialog: to write.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I'll send you picture postcards.
text: Not all of this is heard, since the sound effects pick their
text: spots, but the attention is on the General, who is watching
text: the scene with a whimsical look. He, as does the audience,
text: realizes Bob's true feelings. As the train starts to leave,
text: Betty and Bob shake hands. She holds his handshake a little
text: longer than necessary, and Bob is forced to move along with
text: the train. Finally she releases him, and Bob looks after
text: the train, puzzled.
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: THE CAMERA is now on the train platform, Bob out of sight.
text: Betty wipes away a tear. In the background we see the General
text: in the buggy noticing this.
scene_heading: MED. LONG SHOT - TRAIN IN DISTANCE
text: Bob is in the foreground, the General in the background.
text: Bob joins the General at the buggy. From Waverly's expression
text: we can see that he has decided on a plan of action.
speaker_heading: WAVERLY
dialog: Must be interesting to be a woman.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: The idea's never occurred to me,
dialog: sir.
speaker_heading: WAVERLY
dialog: Well, think about it.
dialog: (Bob is thinking about
dialog: it)
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Not interested!
speaker_heading: WAVERLY
dialog: A man like you must be an expert on
dialog: women.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: It's a little immodest to say so,
dialog: but I consider myself an authority
dialog: on the fair sex, I've made a study
dialog: of the subject. They're simple
dialog: creatures.
speaker_heading: WAVERLY
dialog: They couldn't fool you?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'm single.
speaker_heading: WAVERLY
dialog: 'Pride goeth before a fall.'
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: 'Who knows his own strength is twice

speaker_heading: WAVERLY
dialog: It's always a pleasure to meet an
dialog: expert in any field. Tell me, why
dialog: do you think Betty went to New York?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (Not willing to admit
dialog: it)
text: She has a job in The Carousel.
speaker_heading: WAVERLY
dialog: Expert, you're wrong! She went to
dialog: New York because she's so in love
dialog: with someone here she just couldn't
dialog: stand it.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Phil.
dialog: (A mixture of
dialog: resentment and
dialog: frustration)
dialog: I'm darned if I can figure out why.
speaker_heading: WAVERLY

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (Fitting the action)
dialog: Good, Judy.
dialog: (During the dancing)

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Betty get off all right?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (Slightly belligerent)
dialog: Certainly.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Betty left something for you. She

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I don't get it.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Don't get what?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I just don't see it. You' re skinny,

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Who? Me?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yes, you! Nothing personal though.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: No, of course not.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'm just trying to figure out what
dialog: anyone sees in you.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Well, stop worrying about it. When
dialog: I ask you for a date just turn me
dialog: down. Come on, Judy.
text: They dance away. Bob crosses to the piano and picks up the

speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: WAVERLY
dialog: Yes. I miss the Army.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Where are you going to be sent, sir?
speaker_heading: WAVERLY
dialog: Well, I'm not sure yet. I've always
dialog: been a combat officer, but I got an
dialog: idea they're going to try and palm
dialog: off one of the training commands on

dialog: better not.
dialog: (He's worked up now)

speaker_heading: WAVERLY
dialog: (Solemn)
dialog: This is the one.
dialog: (He opens it, He

speaker_heading: WAVERLY

speaker_heading: BOB

dialog: appreciated more than you imagine.
dialog: Of course you've got plenty of time
dialog: to be amusing, sitting on that porch,
text: rocking away, while we put in a full

speaker_heading: WAVERLY

speaker_heading: WAVERLY
dialog: (He must have had a

dialog: I am not satisfied with the conduct
dialog: of this division! Some of you men
dialog: are under the impression that having
dialog: been at Anzio entitles you not to
dialog: wear neckties! You are wrong!
dialog: Neckties will be worn in this area!
dialog: I have also noticed a deterioration
dialog: in the quality of saluting! This is
dialog: to be improved! I have also had
dialog: complaints from the commanding officer
dialog: of the rest area in Naples! He
dialog: informs me that the non-fraternization
dialog: rule is constantly being broken by
dialog: men of this division! In fact, this
dialog: division is outstanding in its
dialog: violations of non-fraternization!
dialog: You all know the rules! The non-
dialog: fraternization ban expressly declares
dialog: you are not to talk to women!
dialog: (A slightly different
dialog: tone)
dialog: Don't talk to them! That is all!

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: And wasn't it awful the way they

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: For a month's pay all we got was 950

scene_heading: AT HOTEL DESK - MED. SHOT
text: The lobby is empty; in b.g. are the doors to the dining

speaker_heading: WAVERLY
dialog: (Into phone, gruffly)
dialog: Hurry up, hurry up, I'm busy.
dialog: Yes, this is General Waverly.
text: He suddenly snaps to attention, the old soldier.
speaker_heading: WAVERLY
dialog: (Quietly)
dialog: And a Merry Christmas to you, Mr.
dialog: President... Yes, practically the
dialog: whole outfit is here. A little
dialog: paunchy, but they're here. It
dialog: certainly was a surprise -- more
dialog: like a frameup. As usual, my
dialog: Intelligence was not functioning
dialog: efficiently... Yes?
dialog: (Long pause)
dialog: That's very nice of you, Mr.
dialog: President... any time you want me,
dialog: just say the word... but may I add
dialog: this? It isn't always necessary to
dialog: take a job... sometimes it's enough
dialog: just to know it's there.
text: Through the window behind the General we have seen it begin
text: to SNOW. The General notices it for the first time, and his
text: face brightens.
speaker_heading: WAVERLY
dialog: If you ever take it into your mind
dialog: to grab a little rest from all that
dialog: work I wish you'd drop in on us here --
dialog: I can't promise you any golf but --

dialog: falling snow)
dialog: -- we can certainly give you plenty

dialog: President... What?
dialog: (Smiles)
dialog: Thanks, Ike.
text: He hangs up the phone, and proudly, head erect, he walks
text: through the lobby, smiling, eyes wet. He lifts the bell on

speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: You frightened me to death! That

speaker_heading: GENERAL
dialog: Get this area policed up. No telling

text: Martha salutes.
speaker_heading: MARTHA

scene_heading: STAGE - FULL SHOT - MOVING CAMERA
text: Center stage, there is a large cutout of a decorated Christmas
text: tree. Also, there is considerable Christmas holly, mistletoe,
text: etc. Bob and Betty are seen singing. Throughout action of
text: this number Phil and Judy dance. In addition there is staged
text: movement by the ensemble. Bob and Betty are on each side of
text: the cutout Christmas tree, but it is obvious that Betty is
text: preoccupied with some stage business which she is manipulating
text: with one hand behind the cutout tree.
text: CAMERA FOLLOWS Bob and Betty as their movement takes them
text: behind the tree. It is now that we see very clearly that
text: the rear wall of the stage (two immense barn doors) has
text: opened; in b.g. we see the Vermont countryside being covered
text: by the falling snow. Also, we see pine trees in the snow
dialog: that are decorated.
text: Betty steers Bob to a point directly beneath a sprig of
text: mistletoe from which is also hanging the mate to the sock
text: she gave him in scene 110. Bob looks up, sees the mistletoe
text: and the sock, and smiles at Betty.
text: She lifts one of his trouser legs and we see that he is
text: wearing the other sock. They laugh and embrace.
