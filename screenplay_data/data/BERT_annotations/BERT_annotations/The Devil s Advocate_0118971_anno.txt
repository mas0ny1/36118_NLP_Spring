scene_heading: 1 INT. FLORIDA COURTROOM - DAY 1
text: Northern Florida in the midst of a heat wave. Air
text: conditioners fighting a losing battle. The gallery is
text: full. The JUDGE a stern, old hand. The PROSECUTOR, an
dialog: efficient man with a good case.
text: The witness is BARBARA. She is maybe 13. She is a
text: witness in a criminal trial. Her testimony has been
text: carefully rehearsed.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: ... we go back to our homeroom for
dialog: dismissal, unless you have a pass
dialog: for sports or something.
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR (O.S.)
dialog: And is that what you did on the
dialog: day in question?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: No. Mr. Gettys asked me to stay
dialog: after class.
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR
dialog: What happened next, Barbara?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
text: Mr. Gettys closed the door.
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR
dialog: Everyone else had gone?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Yes. He told me to sit in the
text: chair beside his desk.
text: MR. GETTYS, the defendant, is 50. The very picture of
text: respectability. His perfect wife and son staunchly
dialog: enduring this testimony.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: 1 CONTINUED: 1
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR
dialog: In your own words, Barbara, can
dialog: you tell us exactly what happened
dialog: during the next few minutes?
text: KEVIN LOMAX. Defense counsel. Taking it all in.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (O.S.)
dialog: I told him I was afraid I would
dialog: miss my bus. He promised I would
dialog: get to the bus on time if I would
dialog: help him to do something...
text: Kevin -- his eyes -- drifting around the courtroom --
dialog: taking inventory -- assessing damage --
speaker_heading: BARBARA (O.S.)
dialog: ... Then he put -- before I could
dialog: say anything -- he placed his hand
dialog: inside my blouse...
dialog: Kevin -- checking the jury and --
speaker_heading: BARBARA (O.S.)
dialog: ... I was so frightened I didn't
dialog: move. I thought if I was just
dialog: quiet it would be okay...
text: Kevin -- checking Gettys -- seeing something that stops
dialog: him cold --
speaker_heading: BARBARA (O.S.)
dialog: ... Then his other hand went up
dialog: under -- inside my skirt...
text: Gettys' hand -- down below the table -- down where no one
text: but Kevin could possibly see it -- Getty's fingers subtly
text: feeling their way along the leg of his chair --
speaker_heading: BARBARA (O.S.)
dialog: ... his hand then, it started, he
dialog: started, moving back and forth --
dialog: farther and farther inside my
dialog: skirt...
text: Kevin -- glancing around -- nobody else can see it --
speaker_heading: BARBARA (O.S.)
dialog: ... he said he was testing to see
dialog: if I had any special feelings,
dialog: that he wanted to find out what
dialog: kind of feelings I had...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: 1 CONTINUED: (2) 1
text: Gettys' hand -- excited now -- stroking the chair leg --
text: absently -- involuntarily -- unmistakably sexual --
speaker_heading: BARBARA (O.S.)
dialog: ... I didn't know what to say, I
dialog: was trying to think of something
dialog: to say but I was confused and he
dialog: just kept on -- with his hand --
dialog: moving it -- under my dress --
dialog: higher and higher...
text: Kevin is rocked. Trying not to show it.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (O.S.)
dialog: ... then I, I was asking him to
dialog: stop but it was like he couldn't
dialog: hear me -- he just kept on --
text: Suddenly, Gettys' hand stops moving --
speaker_heading: BARBARA (O.S.)
dialog: -- and then I screamed...
text: Kevin looks up to find Gettys' eyes waiting for him.
text: Gettys quickly returns his hand into his lap. He's been
text: caught -- watching, as Kevin turns away and --
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: ... then he, he got mad and said
dialog: we would have to try again
dialog: sometime.
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR
dialog: And did he try again?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Not with me.
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR
dialog: With friends of yours?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR
dialog: And when you told them what he had
dialog: done to you, they told you what he
dialog: had done to them, isn't that true?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR

dialog: from me.
speaker_heading: GETTYS
dialog: Why? What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: The wife. The kid. The outrage.
dialog: You definitely had me fooled.
speaker_heading: GETTYS
dialog: You're my lawyer! You're here to
dialog: defend me!
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: You know what I'm thinking? Why
dialog: don't we put you on the stand and

speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Well, hell, there you are. Rumor
dialog: was you were out wandering in
dialog: traffic.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Not now, Larry.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: What's the game plan, Kevin? I
dialog: got a four-thirty deadline. I
dialog: need a quote. Gimme a quote.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Fuck off.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: 'Mr. Lomax had no comment on
dialog: today's events. Speculation,
dialog: however, was widespread that the
text: young lawyer's unblemished string
dialog: of victories would come to an end
dialog: in this courtroom.'
text: Kevin pulls some cold water to his face. Startled, as
text: THUNDER EXPLODES overhead -- then just as suddenly,
text: becomes nothing more than the urinal flushing...
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: It was a nice run, Kev. Had to
dialog: close out someday. Nobody wins

speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Math hasn't exactly been your
dialog: subject this year, has it?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Any theories on why you've done so
dialog: poorly in math this year?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: It's not my fault.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Would you say Mr. Gettys is the
dialog: problem?
dialog: (as she shrugs)
dialog: You're not sure. Have you had
dialog: any discipline problems in math
dialog: class this year?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: No? Isn't it true Mr. Gettys has
dialog: had to talk to you repeatedly
dialog: about your behavior? Isn't that
dialog: why he asked you to stay after
dialog: class?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Have other teachers ever asked you
dialog: to stay after class?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Once or twice.
speaker_heading: KEVIN

speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I don't know what the other

speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: You ever pass notes in class,
dialog: Barbara? Maybe a note that made
dialog: fun of Mr. Gettys?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: No.

speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: (right to

speaker_heading: BARBARA

speaker_heading: KEVIN

dialog: for breakfast.' You're writing
dialog: here about Mr. Gettys, aren't you?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: It was meant to be a joke.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Have you ever had a party at your
dialog: house when your parents were away?
dialog: (waiting)
dialog: Yes or no?
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR
dialog: Objection. This is way out of...
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Credibility and bias.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Overruled. Answer the question.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: (rattled)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: The word special came up in your
dialog: testimony earlier. You claimed
dialog: that Mr. Gettys asked you whether
dialog: you had special feelings, if you
dialog: felt special.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Have you ever heard of a game
dialog: called 'Special Places?'
dialog: (waiting)
dialog: You're under oath, Barbara. A

speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: This special party, Barbara, this
dialog: was the first time you told the
dialog: story about Mr. Gettys.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: I've spoken to the other children
dialog: who were there that day. Can you
dialog: think of anything else, Barbara,
dialog: they might have told me about that
dialog: party?
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR
dialog: Objection. Your Honor, if he has
dialog: other witnesses let him call them.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: (right at Barbara)
dialog: If I need to call those other
dialog: children, I will.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: I'm gonna sustain that, Mr. Lomax.
dialog: Rephrase your question.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: You threatened those children,
dialog: didn't you?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: That's not the way it happened --
speaker_heading: KEVIN

speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: They happened to me.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: So you made up a story. A
dialog: special story, about a math

speaker_heading: KEVIN
