text: JAKE, a four year old boy, sits in a bathtub. The door to thi

text: walking back and forth in the bedroom, getting dressed to go
text: out. The STEREO is blaring in the bedroom, the music echoes
text: off the tile in the tiny bathroom.
text: Jake is playing with a plastic airplane. He answers a

speaker_heading: JAKE (cont'd)
dialog: My... blue sword. No! The one with

text: He lands the airplane on the water. He giggles.

speaker_heading: JAKE (cont'd)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: My daddy, but he doesn't know about it

speaker_heading: JAKE (cont' d)

text: reading him a story. Jake is nearly asleep.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Well, I was walking in the night, and
dialog: I saw nothing scary. For I have never
dialog: been afraid of anything. Not very. I
dialog: was deep within the woods when,
text: suddenly, I spied them. I saw a pair
text: of pale green pants with nobody inside
dialog: them! I wasn't scared. But, yet, I
dialog: stopped. What could those pants be
dialog: there for? What could a pair of pants

scene_heading: EXT STREET DAY
text: The Chicago skyline looms over the street they live on. Not
text: the suburbs, but not quite downtown either. Racially mixed.
text: Two story brick houses jammed side by side, barely room for a
text: raised voice across the narrow driveways. Bar on the corner,
text: neon sign -- "BERNIE'S TAP." A HOMELESS GUY rants his way
text: down the opposite sidewalk.
text: Tom, Maggie, and PHILIP, early twenties, come out of the house
text: and head down the steps. Tom carries the baby monitor (the
text: receiver) in one hand. Jake's breathing is clearly audible on
dialog: the speaker.
text: Tom's on the sidewalk. Maggie, still three steps up, stops
text: and puts her arms wide. Tom turns around and Maggie lets
text: herself go, falling straight forward. Tom catches her on his
text: back and carries her piggy-back. She leans around and bites
text: his ear.

speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: `Bout a million to one.
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: Any hot mommies?

dialog: Depends. How big you like `em?
text: The hot engine of a Yellow Trans-Am fires up in the driveway
text: of the house across the street. It backs into the street, its
text: passenger door hanging open. The DRIVER honks the horn and a
text: SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD KID runs out of another house and jumps
text: into the moving vehicle. They take off. The Homeless Guy
text: berates them, shaking his fist.
text: They reach the steps of the house next door. PARTY NOISE
text: comes from within, shadows move in the windows. Tom swings
text: Maggie around, puts her on the step, wraps his arms around

dialog: There was no way I was gonna make it

speaker_heading: TOM

speaker_heading: MAGGIE

speaker_heading: LATER,
text: the clock reads 2:31 a.m. Maggie is asleep, Tom is lying on
text: his back, still awake.
text: He looks over at the clock, agitated. He stares up at the
text: ceiling. He closes his eyes.
text: A BARRAGE OF IMAGES
text: races across the back of his eyelids:
text: -- Philip's face, close to his, a finger held in front of him.
text: -- A flame, leaping out from a cigarette lighter.
text: Six more faces, pressed in close to his.
text: Himself, floating in an armchair above an empty movie
dialog: theatre.
text: IN THE BEDROOM,
text: Tom snaps his eyes open. He rolls over onto his side,
text: punching his pillow. He closes his eyes again.
scene_heading: MORE IMAGES COME,
dialog: faster this time. We share his point of view:
text: -- A twelve year old boy beats us up in an alley near a

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: -- A vicious dog sinks its teeth into our calf.
text: -- Maggie, drowning, reaches out to us.
text: The images Increase in speed, a half a dozen flip by so fast
text: they're almcst subliminal -- a car tire, a broken arm, falling
text: into water, breaking window, ham and eggs, a bolt of
dialog: lightning.
text: IN THE BEDROOM,
text: Tom sits up abruptly, shaking his head to clear it.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: .the fuck, man?
text: He puts his hands to the side of his head. It hurts. A lot.
text: Maggie stirs, but doesn't wake up. Tom gets up and walks out.
text: As he passes Jake's room, he does a double take.
text: IN JAKE'S ROOM,
text: the four year old is awake. Not just awake, but standing next
text: to his bed, perfectly straight, staring at the open doorway.
text: Tom steps in. He can see by the light of the nightlight.
speaker_heading: TOM
speaker_heading: (WHISPERS)
dialog: Jake?
text: The little boy doesn't answer. Tom walks slowly over to the
text: boy and squats down in front of him, putting his arms on the
text: boy's shoulders.
speaker_heading: TOM (cont' d)
dialog: Are you okay?
text: Jake just looks at Tom, straight into his father's eyes. The
text: boy's face lights up in a wide smile. He reaches out with one
text: hand and rests his fingertips on Tom's forehead.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Don't be afraid of it, Daddy.
dialog: The hell does that mean?

scene_heading: INT BATHROOM NIGHT
text: Tom shakes some Advil into his palm; washes three down with a

text: his face. He straigltens, looks in the mirror as he wipes his
text: dripping face. He stares at himself for a moment, then
text: summons his nerve and closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: IMMEDIATELY,
text: more images come.
text: -- The front of Tom's own house, from a distance. A MAN IN AN
text: OVERCOAT stands on the porch, waving to us to come in.
text: -- Rough hands attack us, covering our eyes and face.
text: -- A face, close to ours but blurry and distorted, as if seen
text: through dirty, blue-tinted eyeglasses.
text: -- Wooden floorboards as we race down toward them. We hit,
text: hard, and our blood sprays out onto the wood.
text: IN THE BATHROOM,
text: Tom's eyes pop open. That was disturbing.
scene_heading: INT LIVING ROOM NIGHT
text: Tom strides into the living room. Their house is small,
text: crowded with kids' toys and furniture they got for their
text: wedding. Tom paces back and forth, holding his head in his
text: hands. He turns and bolts into the kitchen.
text: IN THE KITCHEN,
text: Tom rips the refrigerator open and searches the top shelf. He
text: finds what he's looking for, a large carton of orange juice.
text: He opens a cabinet, takes out a glass and fills it.
text: He upends the glass, drains it in one gulp. Still
text: unsatisfied, he picks up the carton. He drinks the rest.
text: Juice runs down his chin.
text: BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM,
text: Tom drops onto the sofa. He sits for a moment, trying to
text: regain himself. His breathing returns to normal. He sits
text: forward, picks up the remote off the coffee table, points it
text: at the TV and turns it on. When he sits back --
text: -- there's a woman sitting next to him.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: She's eighteen or nineteen years old, so pale her skin's

text: billowy black dress with a diamond pattern, bangles up and
text: down each wrist. Her lips are light blue, her eyes red-
text: rimmed. Steam rises softly from her hair and skin; when she
text: speaks, her breath comes out of her mouth in clouds of vapor.
speaker_heading: WOMA I
dialog: You can kiss me if you want to.
text: Tom bolts to his feet and staggers away from the couch. The
text: woman stares intently at him and says something else, but her
text: words are lost under the rising sound of static on the
dialog: television.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What?!
text: She repeats, but he can only see her lips moving, the words
text: are lost under the static. Realizing, Tom turns hurriedly
text: toward the TV and hits the mute switch. When he turns back --
text: -- the woman is gone. He stands in the middle of the room,
text: looking all around him. But he's alone.
scene_heading: INT BEDROOM NIGHT
text: Tom crawls back into bed and pulls the blankets up tight
text: around him. He's shivering.
speaker_heading: A HAND

speaker_heading: TOM

text: the front of his own house.
speaker_heading: HE REMEMBERS
text: one of the images that blasted through his mind last night.
text: It's his own house, on a wintry day. A man in an overcoat is
text: standing on the porch, waving an arm in a friendly way --
text: "C'mon in." But the image is silent, slow and eerie. We move
text: slowly toward the porch, toward the man in the overcoat.
text: BACK IN THE PICKUP,
text: Tom turns slowly away from his house, just as
speaker_heading: THE FOOTBALL
text: BANGS off his windshield, nearly breaking it. TWO BODIES
text: hurtle through the air and land on his hood with a loud metal
text: CLANG.
text: Tom jumps a foot. He gets out of the car. ADAM McCARTHY,
text: seventeen, climbs off the hood, embarrassed.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Jesus, you guys scared the shit out of

text: hand. Tom looks at him.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Hell of an arm ya got there.

dialog: almost ten years?
text: Tom is terribly distracted, looking back over his shoulder,

speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Yeah, `bout that.
text: They round a corner. Just ahead, a high school football field
text: is surrounded by bright lights, mobbed with STUDENTS and
text: PARENTS. A BAND plays on the field, it's just about time for

speaker_heading: FRANK
text: (raising his voice over the

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

dialog: If they'd just give him he carries he

text: He pulls out a pint bottle of schnapps and has a bump, offers
text: one to Tom, who declines. A SEXY TEENAGE GIRL walks past.
text: Frank notices. Carefully.
scene_heading: BEHIND THEM,
text: Sheila and Maggie walk together. Sheila stares at Frank as he

speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: Look at him. Why doesn't he just lick

speaker_heading: MAGGIE
speaker_heading: (LAUGHS)

dialog: I've got a few ideas.

speaker_heading: SHEILA (cont' d)
dialog: Look at that! He's not even picky. I

speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Are you okay?

dialog: yards a game? He hits a thousand and

text: He passes Tom the bottle. This time, he takes a swig.
scene_heading: EXT FOOTBALL FIELD NIGHT
text: They come through the tunnel and into the stands. Below, the
text: field is brightly lit. Frank's voice is, thankfully, drowned
text: out by the enthusiasm of the crowd.
text: They make their way to the first open seats in the bleachers
text: and sit down. The crowd is delirious with anticipation, and a
dialog: bit loaded -- there's a lot of schnapps in that crowd, and
dialog: beers snuck in here and there. And that's the grown-ups.
text: ON THE FIELD,
text: the visitors kick off.
text: IN THE STANDS,
text: the crowd ROARS. Tom tries to concentrate on the game, but
text: he's totally distracted. He looks to the right, drawn by a
text: flash of light.
text: A car is pulling into the parking lot at the end of the field
text: with its high beams on. Tom stares at the lights. The
text: BUZZING sound comes back, louder the longer he stares.
text: The crowd ROARS its approval of something. Tom turns back,
text: tries to follow the game. He wipes sweat from his forehead.
text: Maggie is staring at him. She takes his hand and leans over,

text: A GIANT LIGHT STANCHION towers over them. When Tom s\ares
text: directly into the dozen large globes, the BUZZING souni

speaker_heading: MAGGIE

scene_heading: EXT BUSY STREET NIGHT
text: Tom bursts out onto the busy sidewalk, threading his way
text: between PEOPLE and cars as fast as he can. Maggie follows a

scene_heading: EXT OUR BLOCK NIGHT
text: Tom races around the corner and onto his block. He bolts
text: across the street, forcing a car to lock `em up at the last

text: He reaches the sidewalk just in front of his house and stops
text: in his tracks, staring at the house, wild-eyed.
text: All the lights are off.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Oh, no.

text: are rumpled.
dialog: But Jake Js gone.
text: Tom races out. Still staring at that empty bed, we can hear
text: other doors in the house being thrown open, lights being

scene_heading: EXT STREET NIGHT
text: Maggie comes hurrying up the steps of the porch just as the

speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: What the hell is the-
speaker_heading: TOM

speaker_heading: TOM

speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Oh, my God!
text: She bounds up the steps, calling out for Jake.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: She can't be that far!
text: He runs to the corner, desperate, and looks up and down the

dialog: could be anywhere.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He turns, looks up and down the side street. Nothing in the
text: first direction, but when he looks the other way, he hears a
text: faint BUZZING sound in the distance. He doesn't hesitate,
text: just takes off toward it.
scene_heading: TWO BLOCKS AHEAD,
text: Tom is running as hard as he can. He stops, abruptly. The
text: buzzing sound is gone. He looks to his right. Behind a wall,
text: there is a large parking lot filled with buses.
text: He turns around. A dull white glow comes from the windows of
text: the place on the corner. He looks up, at the sign.
text: It's a Greyhound bus station.
text: Tom hurries back toward it, reaching the door just as Maggie
text: comes running up from the opposite direction.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Wait right here, keep your eyes open!
text: He opens the door and goes inside.
scene_heading: INT BUS STATION NIGHT
text: Tom steps into the station, still breathing hard. The BUZZING
text: sound returns. But from where? Is it in his mind this time,
dialog: or really here, in the bus station?
text: The place is empty except for one person, sitting on a wooden
text: bench with their back to him, near the departure doors. Tom
text: walks slowly across the place to the figure. It's Dorothy.
text: As he draws closer, he sees Jake's face, over Dorothy's
text: shoulder. Jake's eyes are open, and he's staring up at the
dialog: ceiling.
text: Tom follows his son's gaze. Jake is staring up at the lights,
text: the old-style fluorescent tubes that give the place its
text: cancerous look. The tubes BUZZ loudly. It's the sound Tom's
dialog: been hearing.
text: Jake sees his father and smiles. Tom puts a finger to his
text: lips -- "Shhhh." Jake yawns, closes his eyes, and drops his
text: head onto Dorothy's shoulder. He goes back to sleep.
text: Tom walks slowly around the end of the bench. Dorothy is
text: SINGING softly, an old nursery rhyme.
text: She looks up suddenly and sees Tom. She starts to jerk to her
text: feet. Tom puts a hand out -- take it easy. Dorothy sits
text: back, caught. Tom steps closer to her, carefully. He holds
text: both his hands out, palms up.

text: Tom raises an eyebrow. She knows what he means.
speaker_heading: TOM (cont'd)
dialog: Give him to me, Dorothy.
text: Trembling, Dorothy reaches out, Jake in her arms. Tom gently

speaker_heading: JAKE

dialog: Oh, hi, Mommy.
text: She's relieved, but livid.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE

speaker_heading: TOM

dialog: Take him home! I'll be there as soon
dialog: as I can!
text: He runs after Dorothy.
scene_heading: EXT PARKING LOT NIGHT
text: Dorothy races out of the bus station and into the forest of
text: parked buses. Tom comes out a few seconds later, giving
text: chase.
text: Dorothy cuts between two parked buses --
text: -- and is nearly hit by a third that's just arriving. Its
text: horn BLARES as she trips and falls to the ground, the bus just
text: missing as it ROARS past her.

speaker_heading: TOM

dialog: What else did he say?
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Nothing. I was sitting there, I was

scene_heading: INT MRI ROOM DAY
text: The MRI machine is a long tunnel with a body slab sticking out

speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: How's it work?
text: Elizabeth goes to a computer terminal and types in some
dialog: commands.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: It creates an electromagnetic field
dialog: thirty thousand times stronger than
dialog: the earth's. That stimulates your
text: brain's protons to align themselves.
dialog: Then we shoot radio waves into you,
text: which knocks the protons out of
text: alignment. They then realign
text: themselves, sending out radio signals
dialog: we record on the scanner. The
text: computer reads the signals and makes a
text: series of detailed cross-sections of
text: the layers of tissue.
text: Tom looks at the machine, then back at her.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Can I have another Valium?
text: A FEW MINUTES LATER,
text: Tom lies down on the "tongue." The Nurses wrap sheets around
text: his arms and tuck them in under his body, immobilizing them.
text: He looks at one of them questioningly.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: So your arms don't touch the sides of
dialog: the machine.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: That would be bad?
text: She smiles and nods. The other Nurse puts a white cloth over
text: his hair.
speaker_heading: NURSE 2
dialog: Your party hat.

text: IN THE MRI ROOM,

text: a drawer sliding back into the wall of the morgue.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE MACHINE,
text: it's only about two feet across, and less from top to bottom.
text: Tom blinks, staring up at the ceiling as the tongue comes to a

speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Kinda hot in the coffin.

speaker_heading: MOVING.
speaker_heading: TOM

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH

text: IN THE TUNNEL,
text: Tom's eyes widen. The hammers whip faster. Their POUNDING is
text: tremendous. Tom's music starts playing from the speakers.
dialog: It's The Doors, "People Are Strange."
text: The hammers whip faster. Elizabeth was right, it's good the
text: music is loud, because the sound coming from the hammers is
text: deafening, like gunshots going off all around his head.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
text: TRY TO RELAX. THIS'LL ONLY TAKE AN
scene_heading: HOUR OR SO.

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (cont' d)
dialog: It's the parietal lobe. Here.

speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: How uncommon?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: One in a half million, maybe, it

text: Gingerly, she closes it again. She opens a drawer and puts it

text: Jake suddenly looks up, confused by something. He stares past
text: the juggler, through the flames. Behind the juggler, a

text: back, the flaming pins flying up between them.
text: Tom moves on, his boy still on his shoulders. The Cop turns

text: Tom walks down the steps of the porch, staring at them as they
text: SCREAM. At the last second, one of the kids turns away. The

text: Tom stands frozen on the sidewalk. A bird swoops low over his
text: head; he really flinches this time. The Mailman waves to him,
text: headed down the block. Too stunned, Tom doesn't wave back.
text: He turns, panicked, and looks at Frank's house. He starts to

scene_heading: INT VIVIAN'S APARTMENT NIGHT

speaker_heading: NEIL (cont' d)
dialog: Like any other part of our body, our
dialog: brains have evolved a lot in a hundred
dialog: thousand years. Our first thoughts
text: were formless. Struggling
text: consciousness. Sensation. An
dialog: instinctive tie to our environment.
dialog: But then our brains began to focus.
dialog: We sacrificed the intuitions we first
dialog: had so our thoughts could be directed,
dialog: so we could master specific functions.
dialog: That's where we are at the moment.
dialog: We're brilliant with technique, but
dialog: we've given up instinct. So the next
dialog: evolutionary step, the step yet to
dialog: come, or perhaps it's already in the
dialog: making, is actually backward. To
dialog: maintain our higher functions, but
dialog: reawaken the part of our brain that
dialog: was pure intuition. That was
dialog: receptive to anything, because it
dialog: didn't know enough not to believe.
dialog: You're a freak of nature, pal, an
dialog: evolutionary step. You're double-
dialog: jointed.

dialog: they used to call a medium. You're
text: like a man in a dark tunnel with a

text: once in a while. When it flickers on,

speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: It is. A lotta people know.
dialog: Unfortunately, the easiest people to
dialog: convince, the believer types, they
dialog: also tend to be the dumbest. And
dialog: people who demand proof -- well, this
dialog: isn't something we can control, it
dialog: comes when it comes, so if you can't

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT BASEMENT NIGHT
text: In the basement, Tom abruptly stops digging, staring at the
text: dirt. The corner of something shiny is sticking out from the
text: pile. He bends down and pulls it out.

dialog: 
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: It's a piece of clear blue plastic sheeting, about two inches
text: square. Tom's hand starts to shake as he holds it.
speaker_heading: AN IMAGE
text: flas.es through his mind again, the one he's seen twice
text: befoi-. A FACE, too close to his, sting at him through that
text: blurr blue, like through bad eyeglasses.
text: IN THE BASEMENT,
text: Tom turns and leaps into the hole, shovel in hand. He begins
text: to dig, wildly, flinging dirt in all directions. At one end
text: of the hole, his shovel slips, the dirt spilling off it as it
text: sticks on something. Something buried.
text: Tom drops the shovel. He falls to his knees and uses his
text: hands to rake the dirt away from whatever it was.
text: More blue plastic.
text: Tom tugs out about eight inches of the plastic, gets a good
text: grip on it with both hands. He pulls it up.
text: Like a rope pulled out of the sand, the edge of the blue
text: plastic rises up, unearthing itself in a line down the middle
dialog: of the pit.
text: Breathing hard, Tom grabs the shovel again.
speaker_heading: THE DIRT,
text: flies away from the plastic as Tom works furiously.
speaker_heading: TOM'S FACE
text: is of a man possessed. He digs as fast as he can.
speaker_heading: FINALLY,
text: Tom stands back, staring down at what he has unearthed.
text: Above him, we see what it is. A long piece of blue plastic,
text: wrapped around something about five and a half feet long and
text: two and a half feet wide.
text: Tom bends down and lays one hand on the plastic. He flinches.
speaker_heading: AN IMAGE
text: pops into his mind, another familiar one. A FIGURE IN Afl
text: OVERCOAT, standing on the front porch of Tom's own house in
text: winter, waving to us to come up.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: IN THE BASEMENT,
text: Tom jerks his hand off the plastic. He swallows.
text: He goes to hi= toolbox and pulls out a utility knife. He
text: slides the ra or blade forward.
text: He goes to one and of the plastic, bends down, and jams the
text: knife through the sheeting. He walks the length of it, making
text: a slit down the middle. He reaches out with shaking hands and
text: pulls part of the plastic back.
text: The first thing he sees is a partially decomposed human hand.
text: Around the withered wrist, there are a half dozen multi-
text: colored bracelets.
text: Tom yanks the rest of the plastic away, revealing the half-
text: decomposed body of Samantha Muller, still in the black dress
text: with the diamond pattern. Tom stands there, his chest
text: heaving.
text: He looks at her hand, thinking.
text: He sits down next to her.
text: He reaches out for her hand, then pulls his own back.
dialog: Can't do it.
text: But he's gotta. He opens his hand, reaching out for hers. He
text: slides his hand underneath --
text: takes a deep breath --
text: -- and closes his living fingers around her skeletal ones.
text: He GASPS.
text: His face turns a horrible shade of pale, his lips go ice blue,
text: and STEAM comes out of his mouth, the way it did hers when he
text: first saw her in his living room.
scene_heading: EXT TOM'S HOUSE DAY
text: It's a wintry day. That same steam rises up in front of us,

speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Come on, baby, how `bout a little

text: His belt buckle comes into our view, and his hands on it. We

text: From behind, something hits us very hard. The floorboards
text: race up at us, all of a sudden. We land on them, hard, bounce
text: off, our own blood spraying out on the unfinished wood.
text: Our head lands sideways on the floor. We see Adam McCarthy,
text: vomiting in the corner.
text: Abruptly, we're rolled over and are staring at the ceiling.
text: Kurt Damon is on top of us, his face too close. Her hands
text: rise up, try to push him off, but he's stronger.
text: Samantha starts to SCREAM. Hands close over our face. She
text: bites, and the hands are pulled away. She SCREAMS again.
speaker_heading: KURT (cont' d)
dialog: SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
text: Kurt holds her down, begins to try to undress her. She

text: In the corner, Adam McCarthy has his hands over his ears.
speaker_heading: ADAM
text: MAKE HER STOP! MAKE HER STOP
text: SCREAMIN', MAN, MAKE HER STOP!

text: muffled and distorted through the blue plastic. We see the
text: image that has haunted Tom, the face of Kurt Damon, a blue
text: demon as he grapples on top of us.
text: IN TOM'S BASEMENT,
text: Tom is sprawled out beside the corpse, their hands locked
text: together. His color is cadaverous. He's suffocating. He
text: thrashes.
text: IN THE HOUSE,
text: back in Samantha's point of view, we struggle, we thrash, it
text: seems to go on forever. Slowly, the sounds become fainter and
text: fainter and fainter...
text: and everything stops. We hear the muffled voices of Kurt
text: and Adam SCREAMING at each other.
text: The sheet is ripped off. We stare up at them as Kurt and Adam
text: stand above us, chests heaving, revolted looks on their faces,

scene_heading: INT BASEMENT NIGHT
text: Tom's fingers twitch open and his hand pulls free of
text: Samantha's. He opens his eyes and gulps air. The color
text: returns to his face as he pulls his hand away from hers.
text: But as he does so, he stops, staring intently at something in
text: her fingers. We don't see what it is.
text: Tom draws himself to his feet and climbs the ladder that leads
text: upstairs.
text: As he goes, we pause, looking between two rungs near the top
text: of the ladder. In the darkened crawl space under the rest of
dialog: the house --

scene_heading: EXT TOM'S HOUSE NIGHT

scene_heading: ON FRANK'S FRONT PORCH,

text: Tom crawls over to Maggie and grabs hold of her, putting
text: himself between her and Harry, who still has the gun.
text: Over at the fireplace, Kurt Damon pulls the poker out of its
dialog: holder.
text: Harry aims the gun.
text: Kurt lunges forward with the poker.
dialog: BANG! BANG!
text: Two shots ring out from the doorway to the dining room. Harry
text: clutches his chest and drops to the floor.
text: They all turn. Frank stands in the doorway to the dining
text: room, clutching his 38. Kurt rushes toward him, SCREAMING,
dialog: poker raised high.
text: Frank pulls the trigger two more times.
text: Kurt goes down.
text: Maggie SCREAMS. Tom huddles over her.
text: Frank lets the weapon slip from his fingers. It hits the
text: hardwood with a CLATTER.
text: Tom and Maggie look up. Frank looks at them. In that red
text: shirt, he is exactly the image Tom saw of him in his dream.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: They were gonna kill you, Tommy. You
dialog: and Maggie both.
text: Frank turns and walks to the front door. He opens it, walks
text: out onto the porch, and sits down on the top step, facing the
dialog: street.
text: Tom looks at Maggie. They're both in shock, can hardly speak.

scene_heading: EXT FRONT PORCH NIGHT
text: Tom comes out of the house. Frank, sitting on the top porch
text: step, makes no attempt to flee. Tom sits down beside him.
text: From all around the block, voices are starting to rise up --
dialog: "Did you hear that?" "What the hell?!" "Somebody call a
text: cop!" Frank shakes his head.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Cold-blooded murder. I can't let
dialog: something like that happen. Not here.
text: He looks at Tom.
speaker_heading: FRANK (con t' d)
dialog: This is a decent neighborhood.
text: A few tentative faces gather across the street, staring at
text: Tom's house, wondering what the hell. A SIREN wails in the
dialog: distance.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I thought so, Frank. I sure as hell
dialog: always thought so.

scene_heading: INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR DAY
text: A NEWBORN BABY stares up at us from inside a rolling bassinet.
text: The bassinet is wheeled swiftly down a hospital corridor by a
text: NURSE. It's a long trip, wherever it's going, but the baby
text: waits patiently, staring up at the ceiling, eyes open.
text: Above the baby, the lights streak by, white blurs.
text: The Nurse leans down and looks at the baby. To the baby,
text: she's just a fuzzy blob.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Almost there!

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The baby turns and looks sideways. The doors of the hospital
text: rooms whiz by, brown smears.
speaker_heading: NURSE (cont' d)
dialog: Just around this corner!
text: She rolls the bassinet around a corner and toward one or in
dialog: particular.
text: The baby sees a bunch of shapes inside the room.
scene_heading: INT HOSPITAL ROOM DAY
text: Maggie, who has recently given birth, struggles to sit up in
text: bad as the Nurse rolls the bassinet into the room. Tom,
text: grinning, gets up from the chair he's sitting in with Jake.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Meet the family!
text: She picks up the baby and holds her out to Maggie, who takes
text: her eagerly.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Hi, baby, did you sleep well? I sure
dialog: didn't.
text: The baby sees Maggie's face, blurry, but friendly.
text: Tom leans in.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: So you're the one that's been kicking
dialog: my wife!
text: The baby sees Tom's blurry face. Jake steps up, onto a step
text: stool, so he can see over the edge of the bed.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Let me see, let me see!
text: Maggie turns the baby so she's facing Jake. The infant looks
text: at her older brother. At first, his face is as blurry as
text: everybody else's. But slowly, Jake's face becomes crystal
text: clear, even though everything around him stays out of focus.
speaker_heading: JAKE (cont' d)
dialog: Can I hold her?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: If you're very, very careful. Climb

text: Jake climbs up on the bed. Maggie puts some pillows around
text: him and carefully places the baby in his lap. Jake looks down
text: at the infant. His expression becomes very serious. Gently,
text: he reaches out with one hand and puts his fingertips on the
text: baby's forehead, the same way he did to Tom's forehead that
dialog: first night.
text: The baby and Jake stare at each other for a long moment. So
text: long, in fact, that the adults become uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Well, they... certainly get along,
dialog: don't they?
text: Suddenly, Jake breaks into a wide grin and looks up at his
text: parents, thrilled. Then he looks back at his sister. He
text: leans down and whispers softly in her ear.

dialog: Don't be afraid of s t.
