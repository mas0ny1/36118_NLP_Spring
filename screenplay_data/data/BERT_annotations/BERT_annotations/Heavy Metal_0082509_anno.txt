speaker_heading: FADE UP ON
speaker_heading: A WHEATFIELD
text: A beautiful field of wheat glistens in the morning sun.
text: As the camera skims overtop, titles start to roll. Ahead
text: of us an odd-looking service van comes into view, sputtering
text: along a dirt road. Getting closer, we can see the driver, a
text: thin, bookish man with a neat mustache. This is AUSTIN GRIMALDI.
text: The truck pulls up to a strange Victorian house in the middle
text: of the wheatfield. The house has several futuristic radar
text: devices on the roof that rotate constantly.
text: AUSTIN gets out, opens the van's rear doors, and pulls out
text: two large metal boxes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: THE ATTIC WINDOW
text: The curtains part ever so slightly, and a pair of eyes peer
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO
speaker_heading: THE VAN
text: AUSTIN shuts the van's rear doors, and carries the two metal
text: boxes into the house. The titles stop rolling as we;
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: INSIDE THE HOUSE
text: AUSTIN is reading a schematic diagram as he sits in front of
text: the exposed chassis of a complicated futuristic electronic
text: contraption, twice his size. There are strange tools all
text: over the floor.
text: Putting down the diagram, he opens one of the metal cases and
text: takes out a sophisticated-looking glass sphere with electronic
text: receptacles mounted in the sides.
text: He places this sphere in a space in the middle of the contraption,
text: clamps it down, and plugs some wires into the globe's receptacles.
text: Then he opens the second box. Inside is a glowing green ball.
text: Using a pair of special tongs, AUSTIN carefully lifts the ball
text: out, and inserts it into an opening at the base of the machine,
text: in the back.
text: As soon as the ball is inside, the machine hums to life. The
text: glass sphere sparkles, and a holographic picture of a green
text: planet in space appears inside it.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
text: (looking at the holograph)
dialog: Hmmmm ....
text: He takes a strange tool, and moves out of frame to make an
text: adjustment underneath the machine. Suddenly a wire comes
text: loose from the sphere and begins to spark.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: (seeing sparks)
dialog: Uh - oh ....
text: As the camera pulls closer to the holograph screen, the
text: green planet begins to silently shake.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: SPACE
text: With an explosion that rocks the universe, a huge chunk rips
text: out of the green planet and shoots off into space, leaving
text: thousands of glowing particles in its wake.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
text: Not noticing the silent image on the holograph, he quickly
text: repairs the sparkling connection and returns to his other
dialog: adjustments.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: A FOREST
text: From the forest floor we see the green planetoid fly overhead,
text: dropping balls. We watch as it moves away and disappears beyond
text: a far-off mountain range. The forest rumbles as the planetoid
text: crashes in the distance.
text: The camera then pans over to a forest patch, where a beautiful
text: girl approaches, picking mushrooms.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
text: A GREEN BALL NEAR HER FEET
text: An ominous note is struck as the girl notices the glowing
text: ball, and is drawn to it. Picking the sphere up, she looks
text: at it. Something inside her warns her of its danger, but,
text: unable to resist, she puts it in her basket and continues on.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO
scene_heading: THE GATES OF KRAAN
text: Night falls over this futuristic chromoid city as the beautiful
text: girl passes through the glass gates and heads home.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: THE GIRL'S BEDROOM
text: The girl yawns and gets into bed as the camera pans over to
text: her basket in the corner. Through its side, the green ball
text: begins to glow brightly.
text: Getting closer, we see a slimy silk-like webbing ooze out of
text: the ball and move towards the sleeping girl, pulling the green
text: ball behind it.
text: The ball starts to glow and pulse as the webbing begins to
text: surround the girl, like a cocoon. Slowly the camera pans
text: up the wall, and moves out through the window, and beyond
text: the city gates, rising higher and higher.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: THE OUTLANDS
text: Flying quickly overtop futuristic villages, the camera
text: heads further and further out into the less civilized sectors,
text: where the rusting pipelines and crumbling utility stations of
text: a past civilization have been overgrown by scrub-bush and weeds.
text: The camera zooms across this strange landscape toward the distant
text: mountains where the huge planetoid fell. Finally, from high
text: above the foothills, we begin to come down.
text: In the hills below us, hundreds of blue humanoid barbarians are
text: moving along, mesmerized, toward a pulsing green glow high in
text: the mountaintops. Suddenly the mountains begin to rumble.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: THE LINE OF BARBARIANS
text: At the front of the line, the largest barbarian - obviously
text: their leader - stops and points.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: THE MOUNTAINS
text: A strange, green, foamy liquid comes pouring down the mountains
text: toward the barbarians.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: THE LINE OF BARBARIANS
text: The barbarians stand frozen as the foam washes over them and keeps
text: on going. One by one, their eyes turn green and they start to
text: change, becoming hairier, uglier, and stronger.
text: As their transformations are complete, the barbarians gather
text: behind their leader into an ever-growing mob of murderous
text: looking sub-humans.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO
scene_heading: THE GATES OF KRAAN
text: A frightened Kraanian councillor spurs his horse forward through
text: the beautiful glass gates, as in the distance we hear the sound
text: of ten thousand approaching footsteps.
text: The camera pans to a hillside overlooking Kraan. In the glow
text: of sunset, the outline of the BARBARIAN LEADER, riding a black
text: war-horse, appears at the hillside and stops. Then with a
text: thundering of footsteps, the outline of five thousand barbarians
text: comes into view behind him, filling the horizon.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: THE BARBARIAN LEADER
text: He is now wearing a strange medallion around his neck as, wild-
text: eyed, he screams to signal the attack. The bloodthirsty horde
text: charges down the hill behind him.
text: The camera moves with the barbarians as they crash through the
text: gates of the city, destroying everything in their path. Smoke
text: and flames are everywhere. Ahead of us, terrified Kraanians
text: run from the onslaught.
text: As we track up over the burning rooftops, we see the BARBARIAN
text: LEADER riding his war-horse in the streets below. Shouting
text: a command, he waves his men on as they move toward an impressive
text: doomed building in the middle of the city.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: THE COUNCIL CHAMBERS
text: At the far end of this huge glass hall, the Kraanian Council
text: sits around a marble table. From outside, we hear the battle
text: raging.
text: Pulling closer we can hear the worried voices of the Council
dialog: members.
speaker_heading: COUNCILMAN #3
dialog: They're killing everyone. We
dialog: must escape!
speaker_heading: COUNCILMAN #2
dialog: The city is burning!
speaker_heading: COUNCILMAN #4
dialog: (throwing a parchment
dialog: before the Elder)
text: Even the mountains glow green and an
text: evil slime oozes down!
speaker_heading: COUNCILMAN #1
dialog: Elder, we must arm ourselves! We
dialog: must fight!
speaker_heading: ELDER
dialog: Silence!
text: Everyone gets quiet. Looking at the parchment thrown before
text: him, the ancient, withered ELDER rises to his feet.
speaker_heading: ELDER
dialog: We are not a race of warriors.
dialog: We are statesmen, and scientists.
dialog: From our very beginning it was ordained
dialog: that the warrior-race of Taarak the
dialog: Defender would aid us in times of need.
dialog: This was the Pact!
speaker_heading: COUNCILMAN #1
dialog: Taarak the Defender? His race is
dialog: dead! They cannot defend anyone!
speaker_heading: COUNCILMAN #2
dialog: Some say that the race is not dead
dialog: - that one still lives.
speaker_heading: COUNCILMAN #1
dialog: One? What good is one?
speaker_heading: ELDER
dialog: One of Taarak's blood can do much.
text: Outside, the sounds of battle grow louder. A boy appears at
text: the doorway.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Elder! They are at the walls!
speaker_heading: COUNCILMAN #3
dialog: Well who is this last Defender?
dialog: How can he be summoned?
speaker_heading: ELDER
dialog: It is Taarna, of the blood of
dialog: Taarak the Defender - the last of
dialog: the race. And must be summoned as
dialog: my forefathers summoned Taarak
dialog: himself - from within!
speaker_heading: COUNCILMAN #2
dialog: But will this Defender answer?
speaker_heading: ELDER
dialog: A Taarakian has no choice. They
dialog: must answer. It is in their blood.
text: The clattering of armour becomes audible.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: They are in the halls! They are coming!!
speaker_heading: ELDER
dialog: (calmly to the boy)
text: Bar the door.
dialog: (to the Councilmen)
dialog: We will summon the
dialog: Defender together.
text: The Councilmen nod.
speaker_heading: ELDER
dialog: (shutting eyes)
dialog: Taarna ... Taarna ...
text: As the Councilmen take up the chant;
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: THE DOOR
text: As the boy begins to bar the door, it bursts open, flinging him
text: aside. Standing in the doorway, surrounded by his men, is
text: the BARBARIAN LEADER.
text: With a laugh, he raises a Medieval-looking multiple cross-bow
text: and fires a burst of arrows into the boy's chest, as the crazed
text: troops rush in around him.
text: The chanting continues as we;
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: THE OUTLANDS
text: We look down over this uncivilized wilderness with only
text: decaying pipelines and the occasional jagged rock structure
text: breaking the barren uniformity of the land. As the Council's
text: distant chanting fades out, all is quiet.
text: Suddenly from behind us, we hear the sound of flapping wings
text: and a huge rush of air. Just above our heads, TAARNA THE
text: DEFENDER comes flying in, sitting proudly in the saddle of
text: a giant crimson bird.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: TAARNA'S FACE
text: She is beautiful, with dark eyes and wild red hair blowing
text: behind her in the wind.
text: Below her, on the ground, she sees a humanoid running in terror,
text: chased by an ugly, four-legged mutant creature.
text: Spurring her bird forward, TAARNA sweeps down over the ugly
text: beast and lassoes it. She then hoists the creature up into
text: the air and, tossing her end of the rope over a tall jagged
text: rock, she leaves the snarling beast hanging helplessly.
text: Flying down to the grateful humanoid, she dismounts. As
text: she approaches we see that he has a barbarian medallion
text: on a chain around his neck.
speaker_heading: HUMANOID
dialog: I owe you my life. Let me
dialog: repay you ...
text: He takes off his medallion and places it around her neck.
text: Suddenly he twists the chain tight in his hand, pulling her
text: towards him. His eyes change to a bright green as he forces
text: her to the ground and starts ripping at her clothes. As he
text: molests her, TAARNA is distracted. She hears something - voices
text: inside her, chanting her name.
text: Quickly she grabs the chain and rips it apart. Then she
text: powerfully smashes both her hands together around her attacker's
text: ears. As he holds his ringing ears, she gets up, lifts him
text: above her head, and hurls him mercilessly to the ground.
text: Still hearing the chanting, she jumps on her bird, pulls out
text: a second rope, and lassoes the barbarian's feet. She then
text: lifts him up and leaves him hanging from the tall, jagged rock,
text: next to the growling creature.
text: As TAARNA flies off, the hanging beast eyes the barbarian
text: hungrily.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: AUSTIN GRIMALDI
text: He is still sitting on the floor, working on his machine.
text: As the camera pulls closer, we see that AUSTIN is reaching
text: deep inside the machineworks, trying to solder a small orange
text: diode in place with an odd-style soldering iron. The connection
text: breaks, and the diode and some hot solder fall deeper into the
text: machine and start smoking and sputtering. As the smoke grows
text: thicker, the machine starts to buzz loudly.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Dammit!
text: AUSTIN pulls his face out of the smoking chassis, grabs a pair
text: of needlenose pliers, and reaches back to retrieve the part.
text: The camera follows AUSTIN'S arm into the chassis, where smoke
text: surrounds it and clouds over everything. The buzzing sound
text: grows, and changes into the sound of powerful, throbbing
text: engines. Slowly the smoke begins to clear as we hear a voice
text: crackling over a radiophone.
speaker_heading: BOMBARDIER
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Where the hell are we?
text: Suddenly the smoke dissipates and a formation of B-17 bombers
text: come tearing out into the moonlit night.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
text: THE GROUND BELOW
text: The sound of jungle night creatures fills the air. We see
text: palm trees silhouetted against the moon bright sky. The
text: scene is almost serene. The camera pans and suddenly the
text: nose of a large parked bomber fills the screen, and as the
text: camera continues panning, we pass a large red rising sun on
text: the bomber's fuselage. The pan stops at the tail of the
text: aircraft, and we see a Japanese soldier - a guard.
text: There is a moment of tranquillity, as jungle sounds fill the
text: air. The soldier almost dozes ... suddenly the cacophony of
text: sound stops, and for a brief moment there is complete silence
text: ... then with an agonizing wail an air raid siren shatters
text: the silence and the guard looks skyward, startled.
text: Instantly all hell breaks loose as we hear pounding feet.
text: Silhouetted figures rush by.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: A GUN EMPLACEMENT
text: Japanese soldiers crank the barrel of an anti-aircraft gun
text: skyward. We begin to hear the sound of approaching engines.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: CLOSEUP OF A SHELL
text: It is thrust into a breech.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: THE B-17 FORMATION
text: As the bombers press on, the camera moves in to the lead
text: aircraft. In the moonlight we see her name, "Pacific Pearl".
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: INT. - THE "PACIFIC PEARL"
speaker_heading: NAVIGATOR
dialog: We're there Stepek, right on
dialog: target ... Rabual dead ahead!
text: Suddenly a cacophony of explosions split the air as anti-aircraft
text: shells explode ahead of the aircraft, lighting the inside with
text: electric blue flashes.
speaker_heading: BOMBARDIER
dialog: Gee! Thanks for telling me,
dialog: Holden. I thought it was Cleveland.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: THE GROUND
text: Ackack guns blast shells skyward. The gun blasts light up
text: the palm tree background, causing momentary silhouettes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: THE BOMBARDIER
speaker_heading: BOMBARDIER
dialog: For Christ sake, hold her steady!
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: THE BELLYGUNNER
text: He can be seen from outside the plane as the shell flashes
text: light up his turret.
speaker_heading: BELLYGUNNER
dialog: Quit yer bitching Stepek, just drop
dialog: 'em and let's get outta here!
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO
speaker_heading: THE BOMBARDIER
speaker_heading: BOMBARDIER
dialog: Keep your shirts on guys, tonight I'm
dialog: gonna hit something.
text: (he settles over the bomb sight)
dialog: Left two degrees ... steady ...
dialog: steady ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: THE BELLYGUNNER
text: The flak is severe, with electric blue flashes lighting up
text: the fuselage interior.
speaker_heading: BELLYGUNNER
dialog: Hey kid, how ya doing back there?
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: THE TAILGUNNER
text: Tailgunner momentarily lit with a shell burst, he's scared
text: shitless. He looks nervously back behind the aircraft at
text: the flak puffs behind the tail.
speaker_heading: TAILGUNNER
dialog: Gulp, ah ... I'm ah ... okay
dialog: ... I think.
speaker_heading: PILOT
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Button it up, we're almost there.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: THE BOMBARDIER
text: He is crouched over his bomb-sights, concentrating.
speaker_heading: NAVIGATOR
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: C'mon Stepek, there's the
dialog: whole island of Rabaul down
dialog: there, you can't miss!
speaker_heading: BOMBARDIER
dialog: Screw you ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: THE PILOT'S COMPARTMENT
text: Suddenly a shell explodes almost on the windshield and the
text: pilot rears back with the blast. The right windshield is
text: shattered.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: We took a hit ...
text: The co-pilot sags forward, held back only by his shoulder
text: straps. His eyes stare. Blood runs from under his helmet.
dialog: We know he is dead.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Shit. Elkhorn just bought it.
speaker_heading: BELLYGUNNER
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: We took one back here too.
dialog: C'mon Stepek, blast 'em!
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: THE BOMBARDIER
speaker_heading: BOMBARDIER
dialog: (hand on the release button)
text: Steady ... steady ... bombs away!
dialog: Let's get the hell outta here!
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: THE GROUND
text: We hear the shriek of descending bombs. The explosions walk
text: across the airfield, and in the light of the explosions we
text: see devastation. The last bomb hits a fuel dump, causing an
text: enormous ball of fire.
speaker_heading: BOMBARDIER
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Yahoo! Bullseye!
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO
speaker_heading: THE PACIFIC PEARL
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: (exhilarated)
dialog: Nice shooting Stepek, how are the
dialog: rest of you guys?
scene_heading: FLIGHT ENGINEER
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Flight Engineer okay.
speaker_heading: RADIO OPERATOR
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Radio okay.
speaker_heading: NAVIGATOR
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Navigator check.
speaker_heading: BELLYGUNNER
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Belly okay.
speaker_heading: TAILGUNNER
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Ah ... tail okay ...
text: There is abrupt silence.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Bellson ... Lewis?
text: Still silence, no reply from either name.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Kid, check the waist positions, see if
dialog: they're okay.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: THE TAILGUNNER
speaker_heading: TAILGUNNER
dialog: Yeah ... will do, skipper.
text: TAILGUNNER crosses himself, then exits back into the body of
text: the machine.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: THE PILOT
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: (wearily)
dialog: Let's go home.
text: We hear jumbled comments from all positions. Everyone is
dialog: happy.
speaker_heading: CREW
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
text: Cheers and whoops.
text: The mood of high spirits is stopped abruptly as the tailgunner
text: reports back.
speaker_heading: TAILGUNNER
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
text: Skipper, Bellson and Lewis are both
dialog: dead.
text: This is the first time the kid's voice is not scared, just
text: puzzled.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Dammit!
speaker_heading: BOMBARDIER
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Well kid, now you got a real
dialog: bombing mission under your belt.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: THE BOMBARDIER
text: He removes his oxygen mask and takes a long swig from a
dialog: bottle.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: EXT. - THE "PACIFIC PEARL"
text: She rejoins the rest of the group. The formation is not
text: quite as tight as before. As the formation flies along,
text: puffs of cloud pass by, occasionally obscuring a machine.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: LOW VIEW OF THE "PACIFIC PEARL"
text: Under the "Pacific Pearl's" belly, we see the bellygunner
text: suspended in his small glass pod. A red glow brightens up
text: as he drags on a cigar. The rest of the formation are
text: visible stretched to the side and behind as puffs of cloud
text: waft past. We begin to feel as if the weather might be
dialog: changing.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
text: THE NOSE OF THE "PACIFIC PEARL"
text: The BOMBARDIER is relaxing inside as he swigs from the bottle
text: and sings raucously. From the front we look in on the pilot
text: with the dead co-pilot sagging in his seat next to him.
speaker_heading: BELLYGUNNER
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Sorry about Elkhorn, skip.
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: I dunno. The shell exploded and he
dialog: collapsed. I think he took it in
text: the head.
speaker_heading: BELLYGUNNER
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Are ya sure he's dead, Skipper?
speaker_heading: PILOT
text: He's dead.
speaker_heading: BOMBARDIER
dialog: (sings drunkenly)
dialog: Oh I put my finger in a woodpecker's
dialog: hole and the woodpecker said God
dialog: bless my soul; take it out, take it
dialog: out, take it out, remove it ...
speaker_heading: TAILGUNNER
dialog: (bolder)
dialog: Hey Stepek, just shut up, okay?
speaker_heading: BOMBARDIER
dialog: Up yours kid, wassa matter, you don't
dialog: like my voice?
text: While all this banter has been going on the cloud has been
text: thickening. Suddenly a serious voice cuts in on the small
text: talk. It's the NAVIGATOR.
speaker_heading: NAVIGATOR
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Something's wrong!
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: THE NAVIGATOR
text: He is frantically tapping the compass.
speaker_heading: PILOT
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: You got a problem, Holden?
speaker_heading: BOMBARDIER
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Naw, the kid's the one with the
dialog: problem. He don't like my voice!
speaker_heading: PILOT
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Button it up Stepek. What's the
dialog: problem, Holden?
speaker_heading: NAVIGATOR
dialog: I must have a malfunction, my compass
dialog: says we're heading north!
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: PILOT
text: He looks at his compass.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Mine says east.
speaker_heading: NAVIGATOR
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Hey, can you guys see the rest of the
dialog: squadron?
speaker_heading: BELLYGUNNER
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
text: Negative, there's too much cloud.
text: A sudden flash of lightning illuminates the whole inside of
dialog: the plane.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: THE COCKPIT
text: The dead co-pilot's pale face is momentarily electric blue,
text: lit by the lightning flash. We pan past him to the compass in
text: the instrument panel. It is spinning madly.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: What the hell ...
text: He reaches forward to tap the compass.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Hey Holden, now my compass has gone
text: crazy. It's spinning like a son of
dialog: a bitch!
speaker_heading: NAVIGATOR
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Mine too, we must have hit a magnetic
dialog: field or something !!
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE PLANE
text: We see a dull glow coming from all crew positions from the
text: on-board lights. Suddenly a curtain of rain lashes the machine.
speaker_heading: PILOT
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Christ, now they're all doing it!!
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: THE INSTRUMENT PANEL
text: All the dials are going haywire. Above the instrument panel
text: we see the windshield is spattered with rain.
speaker_heading: BOMBARDIER
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: You guys quit talking business?
dialog: I'm trying to sing here! Oh I
dialog: put my finger in a woodpecker's ...
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: (irritably)
dialog: Can it Stepek, we got real problems.
text: Just then through the rain, a strange green glow is seen
text: in the distance. It begins to curve toward the aircraft.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE PLANE - NEAR BELLY TURRET
text: The turret swings as the gunner spots the glow.
speaker_heading: BELLYGUNNER
dialog: Jesus! Look at that!!
text: From under the starboard wing, we see the object approaching.
speaker_heading: PILOT
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Look at what ... look at what!!?
speaker_heading: BELLYGUNNER
dialog: It's out there, just look at it ...
speaker_heading: PILOT
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: For Christ sake, give us a position!
speaker_heading: BELLYGUNNER
text: It's about four o'clock, just below
dialog: ... Holy Shit, it's coming right at us!
text: The glow suddenly zooms at the plane with great speed and hits
text: the starboard inner engine.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: PILOT'S POV
text: He has to push the dead co-pilot back to peer out the
text: broken starboard window ... the number three prop is bent
text: and windmilling wildly. It has a strange green luminescence
text: about it ... the whole machine shakes.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Damn.
text: The PILOT tries to fly the plane and do the co-pilot's job of
text: feathering the bad engine. Suddenly it's too late as the prop
text: wobbles loose and cartwheels over the wing.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE PLANE
text: The prop flies back and slices a great gash in the aircraft's
text: skin, near the TAILGUNNER'S position.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: THE PILOT
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: We lost the goddamned prop ...
dialog: Did it do any damage? Kid, check
dialog: the tail.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Come in kid ... kid are you okay?
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Travis; go check the back.
speaker_heading: BELLYGUNNER
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Will do, skipper.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: INSIDE HATCH
text: TRAVIS' turret opens and TRAVIS pulls himself up into the fuselage.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: THE PILOT
text: The gauges are now settled except for the oil pressure to
text: No. 2 engine. The pressure drops. The engine heat gauge
text: climbs rapidly. A red warning light begins to flash.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Goddamn it, now what?
text: He glances out of his window just in time to see a strange,
text: claw-like feeler coming out of the engine casing. It detaches
text: one of the cooling gills, then another, and another. They blow
text: away in the slipstream.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Gremlins!
dialog: (rubbing his eyes)
dialog: Jesus, I must be getting tired.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: THE BELLYGUNNER
text: He looks in to the kid's reargun compartment. All that is left
text: of him is a tattered skeleton.
text: TRAVIS turns, horror frozen on his face. Quick as a flash,
text: from seemingly nowhere, something flies at him and grabs his
text: throat. The mask on his face falls off, and we get a split
text: second look of abject horror as he falls out of frame.
speaker_heading: PILOT
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Travis, what's goin' on back there?
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
text: His eyes are open but he is obviously dead. Through his helmet
text: headphone, we hear his name.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: THE PILOT
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Holden, how far to base?
speaker_heading: NAVIGATOR
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Skip, with everything screwed up here, I'd,
dialog: I'd guess about two hundred miles.
text: All the time the engine pops and bangs wildly.
speaker_heading: PILOT

text: to a green ball stuck in engine No. 3.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: THE PILOT
text: He has landed, and is undoing his parachute harness. He looks
text: around incredulously. The island is a junkyard - a veritable
text: graveyard of aircrafts. There are many aircrafts, both old
text: wrecks and futuristic-looking ones lying everywhere. Skeletal
text: corpses are still left in some of the wrecks. The camera pans
text: to the remains of one machine. It is an old American Lockheed
text: Electra. It glints dull in the half light of dawn. Painted
text: on its side are two names; "Amelia Earhart" and "Fred Noonan".
text: The camera continues to move through this panorama of metallic
text: junk until it stops on a long chrome rod sticking up out of
text: a pile of scrap.
text: Tilting up to the sky we see the clouds part as two gargantuan
text: metal arms emerge and descend down toward the junkpile. The
text: metal arms reach the chrome rod, grip it tightly, and begin to
dialog: lift it up.
text: WWe follow as the cylinder is pulled higher and higher, finally
text: coming to a stop in front of a giant eyeball. The camera pulls
text: back to reveal that the eyeball belongs to AUSTIN GRIMALDI,
text: who carefully scrutinizes the orange diode held tightly in his
text: needlenose pliers.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Got it.
text: Satisfied that this is the piece he had lost in the machine,

speaker_heading: AUSTIN

speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: Okay.
text: The LITTLE GIRL wanders around to the other side of the machine,
text: as AUSTIN flips a switch. Once again the glass sphere sparkles
text: and the holographic screen lights up. AUSTIN uses a tool to
text: fine-tune the holograph and an image begins to materialize;
text: the glass gates of Kraan.
text: As the image becomes clearer, the camera pulls closer and closer
text: to the holograph screen.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: THE GATES OF KRAAN
text: The Council's voices still ringing in her head, TAARNA flies

text: Gliding overtop the deserted streets, she sees a column of
text: smoke rising through the wrecked dome of the building in the
text: town's center. As she watches the smoke rise, she pulls hard
text: on the reins, and heads her bird up.
text: The camera follows as she rides in through the shattered dome
text: down to the Council Chambers below.
text: Corpses of the Councilmen are strewn everywhere. In the
text: center of the room, a large pile of ancient books and
text: manuscripts lie smouldering. Reaching the floor, TAARNA
text: dismounts and starts to look around. At the head of
text: the marble table sits the ELDER - dead. In front of him,
text: a roll of parchment lies on the table. TAARNA opens it.
text: Carefully painted on the parchment is a circle of mountains,
text: their tops glowing green.
text: TAARNA looks at it, and puts it in her sack. Then she notices
text: that the ELDER is clutching something in his hand. Prying
text: his stiff fingers apart, she finds a blood-stained medallion
text: just like the one her attacker wore on his chain.
text: Looking at the dead ELDER, TAARNA grips the medallion tightly

speaker_heading: CUT TO

text: TAARNA flies back out through the shattered dome and surveys

text: Entering, TAARNA sees the slimy silk-like cocoon on the bed.
text: The basket of fruit still sits on the floor. From
text: within the webbing, the green ball is glowing brightly.
text: TAARNA looks at the parchment in her sack, then at the glow
text: coming from the cocoon. Cautiously, she approaches the cocoon,
text: sword drawn.
text: Suddenly a hand from within the cocoon grabs the ball and
text: shoots forward, ripping through the webbing and holding the
text: ball up to TAARNA's face. The hand belongs to a hideously
text: ugly witch, who emerges from the cocoon, cackling through
text: snake-like fangs.
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: Behold! The Sphere of Uluhtec!
dialog: Look upon it, Taarna. Look upon

dialog: in your hands. For death is upon
dialog: you. And as you perish ... so dies
dialog: your race!
text: The witch's eyes go green.
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Take it !!
text: She hurls tha ball at TAARNA, who dodges it. The ball sails
text: past her, out the window. Then TAARNA, sword raised, leaps
text: at the WITCH, slicing through her in rapid strokes.
text: The WITCH cackles and crumbles into dust, but her green eyes
text: stay suspended in the air, and her cackle echoes through
dialog: the room.
text: TAARNA backs away, climbing out the window, onto her bird. As
text: she flies off, she sees the WITCH'S green ball high above her,
text: rising into the clouds and disappearing.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: SPACE
text: The WITCH'S green ball zooms through space, as Earth appears
text: in the distance. Then another object comes into sight. Getting
text: closer we see that is is a modern winged rocketplane of no
text: determinable nationality, soaring high above Earth. The green
text: meteorite passes, briefly bathing the rocketplane in its glow.
text: The rocketplane banks sharply, then stabilizes. Slowly the
text: hatch-doors in its belly open up, revealing the underside of
text: an automobile suspended in the open hatch.
text: Hydraulic metal arms emerge, lowering the automobile out from
text: the belly of the cruising rocketplane. We can see now
text: that the car is a white, '59 Corvette convertible.
text: With a "thunk", the metal arms release the car, and
text: as the rocketplane blasts away, the Corvette begins its
text: free-fall to Earth.
text: As the car falls gracefully through space, the driver plays
text: with the wheel, causing the Corvette to bank smoothly one
dialog: way, then the other.
text: Once his direction is stable, the driver clicks on the car
text: radio and adjusts it through various channels, until he settles
dialog: on one.
text: With the music playing, the car falls closer and closer to
text: Earth, entering and emerging from the cloud cover over the
text: atmosphere. In the heat of entry the vehicle's paint starts
text: burning up.
text: As he heads down over a deserted area, the driver begins his
text: approach. Touching down at breakneck speed, the smoking
text: Corvette bounces violently, every part straining at the
text: repeated impact.
text: The driver's face is expressionless as he jams the car into
text: high gear and floors it, spinning the wheels in an attempt
text: to translate downward momentum into forward motion. Then
text: he pops his drag chute to help slow down.
text: TThis accomplished, the expressionless driver releases the

text: and run off with a vibrator or
dialog: something?
text: As they move through the room, and out the other side, they
text: pass FISTE, who is sitting quietly near the receiving jar,
text: hands folded. Looking around, FISTE notices a green glow
text: coming from the bottom of the jar. He gets up, quietly opens
text: the jar, and pokes through the scrap robot parts.
text: Finding the small green ball in ANRAK'S head, he pulls it
text: out and looks at it.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: CONTROL CONSOLE
text: ZEKE and EDSEL are sitting at the controls, driving carefully.
text: FISTE, carrying the green ball, comes up and sits down beside
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: There it is, man. I'm gonna hang
dialog: a louie here.
speaker_heading: EDSEL
dialog: (to Fiste)
dialog: Yeah, well it won't be long now. Are
dialog: you sure you're gonna testify for Sternn.
text: FISTE says nothing. He just clutches the green ball and stares
text: into space.
text: ZEKE and EDSEL look at each other and shrug.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE SPACESHIP
text: An enormous, brightly-lit, multi-level space station/courthouse

text: approaching the mammoth structure.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: SPACE-STATION LANDING DOCK
text: The ship locks into the dock, and the exit hatch opens.

speaker_heading: and FISTE.
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: ... alright, alright. I'll marry
dialog: you - but on one condition ... I
dialog: want a Jewish wedding.
speaker_heading: ROBOT
dialog: A Jewish wedding!?!!! But this is
dialog: space. 95% of the population are
dialog: robots.
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: Well, find me a robot-rabbi!
speaker_heading: ROBOT
dialog: Okay, okay!
speaker_heading: EDSEL
dialog: I give them six months, man.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: He doesn't even look Jewish!
text: GLORIA and the ROBOT disappear around a corner as ZEKE and EDSEL
text: escort FISTE through the hatch. FISTE is carrying the small
text: green ball.
text: As they lead FISTE away, the camera pulls back, out through
text: a space-port, and moves along the outside of the slowly
text: rotating space-station. At the top, the camera zooms down
text: through a massive glass-domed ceiling and into a huge
text: inter-galactic courtroom.
text: Voices echo below us.
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR
dialog: Are you Captain Lincoln F. Sternn?
speaker_heading: STERNN
dialog: I am.
text: As we move down, we see square-jawed CAPTAIN STERNN, his
text: shifty-eyed lawyer, and the cold Prosecutor all standing
dialog: before the Judge.
text: STERNN is smirking confidently as the Prosecutor reads from
text: a long page of charges.
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR
dialog: Lincoln Sternn - you stand here
dialog: accused of twelve counts of murder
dialog: in the first degree ... fourteen
dialog: counts of armed theft of Federation

speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN STERNN

speaker_heading: STERNN
dialog: Not guilty!
speaker_heading: LAWYER
dialog: (whispers to Sternn)
dialog: Not guilty?!? Are you nuts?!?
speaker_heading: STERNN
dialog: (whispers to lawyer)
dialog: It's okay, Charlie. I got an

speaker_heading: JUDGE

speaker_heading: GUARD #4

text: ZEKE and EDSEL sit down, while HANOVER FISTE, small and

text: his lawyer continue to argue.
speaker_heading: LAWYER
dialog: (pleading)
dialog: Lissen Sternn ... change the plea
dialog: to guilty. Throw yerself on the
dialog: mercy of the court.
speaker_heading: STERNN
dialog: I told you, Charlie. I got an

text: HANOVER FISTE is sworn in, as Sternn's lawyer begs.
speaker_heading: LAWYER
dialog: But the most we can hope for is to
dialog: get ya buried in secrecy so yer grave
dialog: don't get violated! Plead guilty!
speaker_heading: STERNN
dialog: Shut up, Charlie. I got an angle.
speaker_heading: LAWYER
dialog: What angle?
speaker_heading: STERNN

dialog: You know the defendant,

speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO

speaker_heading: FISTE

scene_heading: STERNN & LAWYER

speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO
speaker_heading: WITNESS STAND
speaker_heading: FISTE

dialog: He's nothin' but a low-down, double-dealin',

text: STERNN and his lawyer look on, horrified, as FISTE'S body
text: starts to grow.
speaker_heading: FISTE
dialog: Hangin's too good for him!!
text: New muscles tear through FISTE'S shabby clothes.
speaker_heading: FISTE
dialog: Burnin's too good for him!!
text: Growing larger, he starts foaming at the mouth.
speaker_heading: STERNN
dialog: Hanover ...
speaker_heading: FISTE
dialog: He should be torn into little bitsy
dialog: pieces and buried alive!!!
text: FISTE rams his hands down onto the Witness Stand, shattering
dialog: it completely.
speaker_heading: STERNN
dialog: Hanover ...
speaker_heading: FISTE
dialog: I'll kill him!
text: He hurls the Prosecutor aside, and moves towards STERNN with
text: thundering footsteps.
speaker_heading: FISTE
dialog: KII - ILLL!!!
text: Still growing, he rips apart the Judge's bench as he passes
text: it. Finally he stands towering in rage over the terrified
speaker_heading: STERNN.
speaker_heading: STERNN
dialog: (to Fiste)
dialog: H-h-hey, Hanover ...
dialog: n-now take it easy, Hanover,
dialog: I'm sure we can talk this ov ...
text: Instinctively, STERNN leaps back as FISTE'S giant hands come
text: smashing down in the spot where STERNN stood. The gallery
text: scatters screaming as STERNN runs for the door. Slavering,
text: FISTE thunders after him. STERNN runs through the exit,
text: bolting the door behind him. FISTE follows, tearing the
text: door apart, and bringing the entire courtroom wall down in
dialog: the process.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: STERNN
text: Running down a hallway, STERNN passes a group of Regolian
text: cops, who raise their weapons in an attempt to block the
text: rampaging FISTE.
speaker_heading: REGOLIAN #1
dialog: Halt, clik, in the name of the
dialog: Federation, clik. Where is your
dialog: corridor pass?
dialog: (to other Regolians)
text: Unco-operative humanoid, clik,
dialog: blast him.
text: They open fire, but FISTE is unstoppable. Still growing,
text: he grabs the Regolians's weapons, crunches them up and eats
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: REGOLIAN #1
dialog: You are now in violation of Code
scene_heading: 103-N-17, clik, paragraph A-64 ...
dialog: unauthorized consumption of Federation
dialog: property. Please come quietly, clik,
dialog: ... thenk yew.
text: With a single clap of his enormous hands, FISTE crushes the
text: Regolian's metal skulls together into an accordian the thickness
dialog: of a dime.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: STERNN
text: He races through a metallic hallway, and ducks into a boiler
text: room, then down a long dark tunnel. At the end of the tunnel,
text: STERNN comes to a dead-end, and stops to rest.
speaker_heading: STERNN
dialog: Oh, this looks good.
speaker_heading: FISTE
dialog: (growls)
speaker_heading: STERNN
dialog: Oh, duck under here ...
speaker_heading: FISTE
dialog: I'll get you!!
speaker_heading: STERNN
dialog: I think I'll turn here!
dialog: (runs, gasping)
dialog: Come on feet, don't fail me now!
speaker_heading: FISTE
dialog: Sternn!!!
speaker_heading: STERNN
dialog: Uh oh ...
dialog: (runs)
dialog: Ah, gasp, ah whew, lost him!
speaker_heading: FISTE
speaker_heading: STERNN!!
speaker_heading: STERNN
dialog: Okay, Hanover, you've had this
dialog: coming!
text: Taking a deep breath, STERNN reaches into his pocket, pulls
text: out a wad of bills, and counts them out as he hands them to
speaker_heading: FISTE.
speaker_heading: STERNN
dialog: Let's see, thirty-three, thirty-
dialog: four, thirty-five thousand zuleks.
dialog: Thanks Hanover.
speaker_heading: FISTE
dialog: (taking money)
dialog: S'nothin, boss.
text: Counting his money, FISTE starts shrinking back to his
dialog: normal size.
speaker_heading: STERNN
dialog: And Hanover ...
speaker_heading: FISTE
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: STERNN
dialog: Goodbye.
text: STERNN pulls a lever, which opens up the floor below FISTE,
text: who screams, falling out into space. As FISTE slides out,
text: STERNN grabs the money from FISTE'S hand and smiles.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: THE OUTLANDS
text: All is quiet across this vast expanse of rusted pipes and
text: barren desert. The silence is broken by a whistling sound which
text: gets louder and louder. Then, thud!
text: A green ball lands in the dirt in front of us. Fluttering down
text: around it are HANOVER FISTE'S tattered clothes. Then the
text: burnt ashes of Hanover's body land in a small pile beside his
text: clothes. Panning up we see TAARNA flying on her bird in the
dialog: distance.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: TAARNA
text: She swoops down and flies through a maze of rusting pipes and
text: cables which look like the ramnants of an ancient power station.
text: Then she steers her bird through a hidden opening in the rotting
text: floor, and enters a magnificent secret hideaway cut deep into
dialog: the rock.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: INSIDE TAARNA'S HIDEAWAY
text: Landing her bird on a circular slab of gleaming marble, TAARNA
text: dismounts and walks over to a shimmering pool. Here she disrobes,
text: and picking up a small gold pitcher, she pours an ancient oil
text: over herself. It shines and sparkles as it touches her skin.
text: Then she steps into the water, where her body seems to sparkle
text: even brighter.
text: Finishing her sacred bath, she steps out and walks to a stone
text: wall. When she touches it, a rock panel slides away to reveal
text: a gold chest. TAARNA opens it.
text: Inside the chest lies a glistening set of armoured garments,
text: so bright that TAARNA must shield her eyes for a moment. Then,
text: as she looks down at the armour, the voice of TAARAK THE
text: DEFENDER comes into her head.
speaker_heading: TAARAK
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: To defend - this is the Pact.
dialog: but when life loses its value,
dialog: and it taken for nought, then
dialog: the Pact is ... to avenge!!
text: Through a series of dissolves we see TAARNA'S hands sensuously
text: fitting the various metallic pieces over her firm body. Finally
text: we pull back to see her fully.
text: Standing before us, glistening in the torch-light, she looks
text: magnificent. Reaching once more into the chest, TAARNA pulls
text: out a golden sword. As she holds it, it seems to vibrate,
text: almost buzzing in her hands. Suddenly she swings it, slicing
text: cleanly through one of the stone torches on the rock wall. As
text: the burning torch falls to the ground, TAARNA leaves.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: THE SKY
text: From over our heads, TAARNA comes soaring past, her armour
text: gleaming in the rays of the setting sun. Below her, she
text: sees a metallic holiday-town filled with barbarian soldiers.
text: Drunken blue men fight in the streets, strange animals run
text: around loose, and dead or drunken bodies lie in the gutters.
text: Looking down, amidst the melee, she sees three winged creatures
text: tied up in front of a bar. The camera zooms in on one of the
text: creature's saddlebags. It has a silver medallion set into the
text: leather, identical to the one which TAARNA pried from the
text: Elder's fingers.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
text: INSIDE THE BARROOM
text: Barbarian honky-tonk music fills the crowded room, as
text: various barbarian soldiers sit drinking and fondling the
text: bar-girls who are dressed in cheap, flashy metal outfits.
text: Three of the blue barbarians are particularly drunk and
text: rowdy as they push a non-barbarian down, dump a drink on his
text: head, laugh and kick him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: THE BARROOM DOOR
text: TAARNA walks in through the swinging silver and plexiglass
text: doors, past the three soldiers kicking their victim. She sits
text: down at the bar.
text: The three brutish blue soldiers finish stomping the man and
text: walk over to the bar, crowding close around TAARNA.
speaker_heading: BARBARIAN #1
dialog: Hey, look. A new one.
dialog: (to Taarna)
dialog: Where you from, baby?
text: TAARNA ignores him.
speaker_heading: BARBARIAN #2
dialog: Doesn't talk much, does she ?
speaker_heading: BARBARIAN #3
text: She doesn't have to talk for what
dialog: I want to do with her.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: TAARNA'S HAND
text: It slowly moves down to her sword, and unclips the safety strap.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO
speaker_heading: THE BARBARIANS
speaker_heading: BARBARIAN #3
text: (running his hand across her breastplate)
dialog: C'mon baby, let's see what's under there.
speaker_heading: BARBARIAN #1
text: (starting to undo her breastplate)
dialog: Yeah, let's have a look.
text: Taarna slowly stands up, pushing their hands away, and takes
text: a step back.
speaker_heading: BARBARIAN #2
dialog: Heey, she's tough.
speaker_heading: BARBARIAN #3
dialog: Maybe she wants to fight?
text: They all laugh.
speaker_heading: BARBARIAN #1
dialog: ... or maybe she wants to take
dialog: us all on?
text: Still laughing, they move towards her.
text: In a blinding flash, TAARNA draws her golden sword, and wielding
text: it like a Samurai master, slices off all three of their heads.
text: In an instant, the sword is back in its sheath.
text: The barbarian's heads stop laughing as they fall to the ground.
text: The music stops, and everyone in the bar stares at TAARNA.
text: Stepping over the bodies, TAARNA walks up to the bartender,
text: pulls out the parchment picture of the glowing mountains, and
text: shows it to him. The bartender looks at it carefully, then
text: points out the window.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
text: Beyond the oasis.
text: TAARNA nods and leaves.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO
speaker_heading: THE BARTENDER
text: His eyes start to turn green. The camera gets closer and
text: closer to his glowing eyes, until the green glow turns into
text: the image of a ball, lying in the ground, in AUSTIN'S holograph.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
text: AUSTIN is crouched over the machine turning several knobs,
text: trying to make the ball move. Nothing happens.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Hmmm ... must be jammed.
text: Frustrated, AUSTIN picks up a flashlight, opens up a compartment
text: underneath the control knobs, and takes a look inside. While
text: AUSTIN fiddles inside the machine, we see two hands appear on
text: the holograph screen and pick up the green ball. AUSTIN looks
text: over to the holograph and notices.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Where'd it go?
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: THE HANDS
text: As the hands cradle the green ball, the camera pulls back
text: to reveal a skinny, unco-ordinated boy wearing thick eyeglasses,
text: carrying the sphere across his backyard. This is DAN.
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: It all started when I found the green
dialog: meteorite. I read in Farraday's "Life
dialog: of the Planets" that smaller ones like
dialog: this are supposed to burn up when they
text: enter the atmosphere, but for some reason
dialog: this one didn't ...
text: DAN carries the ball into a typical small-town house.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO
scene_heading: T.V. ANTENNA ON ROOF - STORMY NIGHT
text: As the narration continues, we follow two red wires down
text: from the T.V. antenna, along the roof, and into DAN'S attic
text: window. The wires run through a bucket of water and are hooked
text: up to some electronic parts on DAN'S desk.
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: ... so I brought it up to my room,
dialog: stuck it in my rock collection and
dialog: forgot about it. I was experimenting
dialog: with natural electricity ...
text: The camera pans around the room to show various displays of
dialog: DAN'S scientific tinkering - blue-ribbon science projects,
text: transparent models of a man and a woman showing all internal
dialog: organs, and many books.
text: In the corner, the green ball sits in DAN'S rock collection.
text: At his desk, DAN impatiently shuffles through the dusty pages
text: of an old scientific journal.
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: ... and with the storm warnings up,
dialog: I figured maybe tonight I'd hit the
dialog: jackpot. All I needed was a little
dialog: juice.
text: He looks out the window at the gathering storm.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: THE STORM
text: Crackling from the sky, a bolt of lightning strikes the
text: television antenna and surges along the wires into the attic.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: DAN'S ATTIC ROOM
text: The lightning flashes into DAN'S apparatus, lighting it up
text: brightly.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: It works!
text: Suddenly, an electric arc jumps from the bucket of water
text: and crosses the room to join with thw ball on his shelf.
text: Caught in the middle, DAN begins to glow green.
speaker_heading: DAN
text: (looking at his
dialog: green arms)
dialog: Oh Jesus!
text: The electrical field opens up a shimmering gateway into another
text: universe and DAN de-materializes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: THE TRANSFORMATION
text: We float in darkness for a moment as black shapeless images
text: zoom past.
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: I felt like I was nothing
text: - just atoms floating in the
dialog: darkness ...
text: Then, tiny beams of light join to form a glow in the corner
text: of the screen. The glow gets brighter and starts moving slowly
text: around the screen. Now, we can make out some of the images
text: whipping past - a half-formed hand, pages of a book, a crumbling
text: pyramid, a green ball.
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
text: Then, a body started to re-form
dialog: around me. Only it wasn't my
dialog: body - this one had muscles.
text: Sturdy muscular parts begin to materialize around the moving
text: light. They join up with each other to form a powerfully built
text: human figure.
text: Finally a man's face takes shape, and as it forms, eveything
text: gets brighter and clearer.
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: It was a great body, but I
dialog: wasn't too crazy about the
text: face.
text: The powerful figure, DEN, turns slowly as he floats and begins
text: to look at his hands and arms. Moving his mouth, he speaks in
text: a new voice - deep and powerful.
speaker_heading: DEN
dialog: (feeling head)
dialog: Hmmm ... no hair.
text: Suddenly, the background explodes into fields of radiant colours
text: as the body accelerates away from us and passes through a second
text: shimmering gateway.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID
text: DEN, strong, masculine and hairless, materializes cradled in
text: the hand of a huge stone idol. He is naked and unconscious
text: Above him, the glowing green ball is held in the idol's other
dialog: hand.
text: The camera pulls back to show that the idol is standing on the
text: deck, stop a huge, truncated pyramid. The deck forms a walkway
text: around a swirling pool of green water.
text: Kneeling all around the seething pool, are lizard-men, wearing
text: priest's robes. Two of them stand beside a glass coffin. Inside
text: the coffin, lies a naked girl, bound and gagged.
speaker_heading: PRIESTS
dialog: (chanting softly)
dialog: Uluhtec, Ulutec ...
text: Directly in fron of the idol, a regal-looking QUEEN, wearing
text: a revealing velvet cloak, is praying to the raging water.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: By the powers of the glowing
dialog: Loc-Nar placed in your idol's
dialog: hand, I demand you come forth,
dialog: Uluhtec!
text: The waters of the sacrifical pool rage more violently and
text: a low rumble is heard far below.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: THE IDOL'S HANDS
text: The green ball, (Loc-Nar), glows brightly as DEN opens his eyes,
text: looks down and notices his enormous genitals.
speaker_heading: DEN
dialog: Hmmm ... big!
text: Seeing an animal-skin hanging from the idol, he rips off a
text: piece and wraps it around himself.
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: There was no way I was gonna
dialog: walk around this place with
dialog: my dork hangin' out!
text: Suitably covered, he surveys the ritual taking place below him.
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Wow! This looked like something

speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: EDGE OF RAGING POOL
text: The QUEEN is kneeling before the seething water.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Grant me your strength in return
dialog: for a living mortal sacrifice! It

dialog: I demand it!
text: Two lizard priests remove the terrified girl from the glass
text: case and hold her out over the swirling water. The QUEEN
text: nods and the two priests drop her in.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: THE IDOL'S WATER
text: Seeing the girl struggle in the water, DEN'S eyes grow wide.
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: What'd they do that for?
text: He stands and dives into the raging pool, swimming powerfully
text: towards the drowning girl.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: UNDER WATER
text: Reaching her, DEN grabs the girl's bound ankles, hooks them
text: over his head and drags her through a decayed hole in the
text: underwater wall. Inside a stone tunnel, they are swept along
dialog: by the current.
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Normally, I'd be dead by now. I
dialog: kept thinking I was going to run
dialog: out of air, but my new body worked
dialog: great. I just hoped her body was
dialog: working as good as mine.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD OF LILIES - DAY
text: DEN and the girl are washed out into a pond at the center of

speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Thank you.
text: She takes DEN'S hand and lies back in the flower, her
text: beautiful breasts exposed in the sunlight.
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: She had the most beautiful eyes.
dialog: I wanted to make some conversation
dialog: but I found my new self asking the
dialog: same old stupid questions.
speaker_heading: DEN
dialog: Are you from around here?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Well, you may not believe this, but
dialog: I'm from another world - from a place
dialog: called Earth.
speaker_heading: DEN
dialog: Earth? I too am from Earth.
dialog: How did you get here?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: My name is Katherine Wells, and
dialog: I'm from the British colony of
dialog: Gibraltar. Time makes no diff-
dialog: erence here, but there it was
dialog: the summer of 1892. It was
dialog: evening - I'd gone for a walk on
text: the cliffs when suddenly a sphere
text: fell from the sky. Following its
text: glow, I came to a shining gate made
text: out of light. Unable to resist, I
text: stepped through it and awoke in
dialog: this world. There I was thin and
text: weakly, fit only to stay indoors.
dialog: (she stands up)
dialog: But here, somehow I am stronger,
dialog: more alive,
dialog: (she stretches seductively)
dialog: ... more fully a woman.
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: You're not kidding.
speaker_heading: DEN

text: Even my fingers seem to hold
dialog: great strength.
text: KATHERINE walks up close to DEN, takes his hand and touches
text: the fingers to her breast.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: You saved my life. I have no
dialog: reward to give you, but if any
dialog: part of me pleases your senses
dialog: - I would give it willingly.
text: She circles her nipple with his baby finger.
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Wow! This was great! There was
dialog: no way I'd get a chick like this
dialog: back on Earth. I mean, look at
dialog: her!!
text: Taking KATHERINE in his arms, DEN lays her down on a bed of
text: flowers and begins to tenderly make love to her.
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: There was only one problem ...
text: A spiked boot appears in the frame. The camera pans up to
text: show a large, ugly hairy beast-man standing over DEN and
scene_heading: KATHERINE.
text: The camera then pulls back to reveal the entwined couple,
text: completely surrounded by a horde of grim, bestial warriors.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (V.O.
dialog: I don't know who these jerks
dialog: were, but they sure picked a
dialog: bad time to show up ...
text: The ugly beast-men grab DEN and KATHERINE as we;
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO
scene_heading: ARD'S THRONE ROOM
text: The beast-Captain keeps his machine gun trained on DEN as
text: the soldiers lead him into the cavernous room.
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: They split us up and took me to
dialog: this weird castle-type place.
dialog: I wanted to find out where they'd
dialog: taken Katherine, but none of these
dialog: guys seemed to speak English.
text: In the middle of the room there is a round stone pedestal
text: with a throne carved into it. On the throne sits ARD, a
text: child-like ruler with a sadistic glint in his eye.
speaker_heading: ARD
dialog: They tell me you are Den of Earth,
dialog: the one who dared to steal the
text: female sacrifice from the Queen.
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: This guy was a shrimp so I figured
dialog: I'd play it tough.
speaker_heading: DEN
dialog: Where is the girl?
speaker_heading: ARD
dialog: I am Ard - supreme leader of
dialog: the revolution and the next
dialog: ruler of the world.
speaker_heading: DEN
dialog: (tougher)
dialog: The girl!!
speaker_heading: ARD
dialog: Well, aren't we fierce?
dialog: If you are truly as tough as
dialog: you seem, then you will serve
dialog: me well. But first, a test.
dialog: Guards! Castrate him!
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Uh oh.
text: Two bestial guards approach from behind, brandishing curved
text: short-swords. DEN turns instinctively, dodges the first thrust
text: and delivers a bone-shattering elbow to the beast's head,
text: crushing his skull.
text: Spinning with his own momentum, DEN throws a rock-hard fist
text: into the second guard's chest, snapping his rib-cage and
text: sending him flying across the room.
text: Without pausing, the bald muscleman grabs the nearby beast-
text: Captain and lifts him into the air by his machine-gun. The
text: Captain hangs on as DEN twists the gun, butts it into the
text: creature's groin and then drives the weapon through the
text: Captain's jaw.
text: The creature crumples, leaving DEN with the gun.
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Boy! I was pretty good at this
dialog: stuff.
speaker_heading: ARD
dialog: Excellent. You are worthy to
dialog: serve me.
speaker_heading: DEN
dialog: (aiming machine-gun at him)
dialog: Give me the girl or die.
speaker_heading: ARD
dialog: (taking it lightly)
dialog: Well, if I have a choice, I'll
dialog: take death.
speaker_heading: DEN
dialog: So be it.
text: DEN fires, spraying a row of bullets across ARD'S body. The
text: bullets blast big yellow holes in ARD'S chest, but there is
text: no blood. ARD looks up and laughs.
speaker_heading: ARD
dialog: Ha ha ha! You'll have to
dialog: do better than that.
text: As DEN looks on, ARD'S wounds miraculously close up and heal
text: themselves over.
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: I could see why they made this
dialog: guy their leader.
speaker_heading: ARD
dialog: (standing up)
dialog: ... but if you're really interested
dialog: in the girl; I've had her encased in
dialog: glass.
text: ARD pulls the velvet covering off of a glass box to reveal
text: KATHERINE, unconscious, sealed inside.
speaker_heading: DEN
text: She's dead.
speaker_heading: ARD
text: Actually no. She's sleeping,
dialog: but only I can awaken her.
speaker_heading: DEN
dialog: What do you want of me?
speaker_heading: ARD
dialog: I want you to steal the sacred
dialog: Loc-Nar.
speaker_heading: DEN
dialog: What is this Loc-Nar?
speaker_heading: ARD
dialog: The Queen's glowing sphere, you
dialog: fool. The sacrifice to Uluhtec
dialog: can only be performed by the
text: possessor of the sacret Loc-Nar.
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Norl!
text: NORL, a huge gorilla-man, in a purple cloak, steps forward.
speaker_heading: ARD
dialog: (to Den)
dialog: This is Norl, my bravest warrior.
dialog: You will go with him to the Queen's
text: castle and steal the Loc-Nar. Then
dialog: I will give you the girl.
speaker_heading: DEN
dialog: And if I refuse?
speaker_heading: ARD
dialog: If you refuse, you die, she dies,
text: everybody dies.
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Sounded reasonable to me.
text: DEN looks down at KATHERINE'S motionless body.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO
scene_heading: RIVER BANKS NEAR THE QUEEN'S CASTLE
text: In the moonlight, DEN and NORL lead a squad of beast-warriors,
text: armed with automatic weapons, along the river towards the Queen's
dialog: castle.
speaker_heading: NORL
dialog: (to Den)
dialog: Ssh. Guard post ahead. We
dialog: must go underground.
text: NORL lifts a rock to reveal an underground passageway.
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: This guy Norl seemed to know what
dialog: he was doing. And, for a gorilla,
dialog: his English wasn't half bad.
text: DEN and the warriors enter the underground passage.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: UNDERGROUND TUNNEL
text: The group, carrying torches, moves along the dark tunnel. They
text: pass a bubble-window with shark-faced eels swimming on the other
dialog: side.
speaker_heading: NORL
dialog: (to Den)
text: We're underneath the castle moat.
text: DEN nods. An ugly growl echoes through the tunnel up ahead.
text: the warriors freeze and murmur to each other in their own
dialog: languages.
speaker_heading: DEN
dialog: (to Norl)
dialog: What are they saying?
speaker_heading: NORL
text: They talk of the savage beast who
text: prowls these catacombs with a fierce
text: hunger and sharp teeth ...
dialog: (gestures)
text: six inches long.
text: A dog-faced warrior shakes his head and says something to NORL.
speaker_heading: NORL
dialog: Sorry ...
dialog: (indicating)
dialog: ... sixteen inches long.
text: Suddenly, a savage beast appears and chomps his long, razor-sharp
text: teeth into one of the warriors at the end of the line. DEN, NORL,
text: and the remaining warriors run on through the tunnel as, behind
text: them, the monster pulls his victim apart.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: DOORWAY IN CATACOMBS
text: DEN, NORL, and the remaining warriors arrive at a door in the
text: rock wall.
speaker_heading: NORL
dialog: (to Den)
dialog: Now we separate. You and Korg
dialog: take this door into the Queen's
dialog: quarters. The rest of us will
text: move through the walls and enter
text: her chamber from the other side.
dialog: Whoever gets the Loc-Nar first will
dialog: return it to Ard. Good luck, Den.
text: DEN nods, puts out his torch and carefully opens the door as
text: NORL moves off.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: DARK ROOM
text: DEN and KORG silently enter. Across the dark room, the
text: glow of the green ball casts a pale light.
speaker_heading: KORG
dialog: (whispers and points)
dialog: Loc-Nar.
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Wow! It was just like the
text: ball I dug up in my back yard.
text: They tip-toe towards it.
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
text: As I saw the Loc-Nar's glow I
dialog: had this real funny feeling. All
dialog: by themselves, my hands reached
dialog: forward to touch it. But the
text: Loc-Nar moved out of the way.
dialog: Instead, my hands felt something
text: else - warm flesh. Then the lights
dialog: came on.
text: In the brightly lit room, DEN is standing before the beautiful
text: semi-clad QUEEN, and holding her firm, naked breasts in his hands.
text: Looking around, he sees that he and KONG are surrounded by a
text: brigade of the Queen's ugly guards, swords raised.
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Talk about embarassing!
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Kill them.
text: The Queen's guards attack with battle-axes, clubs and swords.
text: As DEN knees one in the groin and swings his gun into another's
text: face, four of the guards surround KORG and club his brains out.
text: But DEN, still going strong, throws two guards into the wall
text: and heaves a third out the window. As the QUEEN watches with
text: glee, more guards rush into the room and DEN is finally over-
text: powered and held down. The Captain of the guards places a long
text: knife against Den's throat.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Can I slit his throat, your
dialog: Majesty?
text: The QUEEN, eyeing Den's magnificent body, sighs.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Yes, slit his throat.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Thank you, your Majesty.
text: As the Captain presses his knife against Den's flesh, the
text: QUEEN suddenly raises her hand.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Stop! I have, ah, something better
dialog: in mind.
text: She takes Den's hand and leads him into an adjoining room, as
text: the guards grumble to one another.
speaker_heading: GUARD #1
dialog: Jeez, not again.
speaker_heading: GUARD #2
dialog: This always happens.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Look, she's the Queen. She
dialog: can do whatever she wants.
speaker_heading: GUARD #2
dialog: Yeah, sure.
speaker_heading: GUARD #1
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: THE QUEEN'S BOUDOIR
text: The QUEEN stands before DEN, hands on her hips and a funny look
text: in her eye.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: If you please me, I may let
dialog: you live.
text: She smiles, and approaches DEN.
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Uh oh.
speaker_heading: DEN
dialog: What must I do?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Satisfy my appetites.
text: The QUEEN lets her cloak drop to the floor as she gets closer.
text: She is naked underneath.
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Wow! Eighteen years of nuthin'
dialog: and now, twice in one day. What
dialog: a place!
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Come with me.
speaker_heading: DEN
dialog: Mmmm.
text: She steps forward and takes his hand, leading him towards the
dialog: bed.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO
scene_heading: THE QUEEN'S BED
text: DEN and the QUEEN are lying undressed on the enormous bed.
text: The QUEEN has a very contented look on her face. DEN looks
text: exhausted. As the Neverwhere moon rises outside the chamber
text: window, the QUEEN slowly runs her hand over DEN'S bulging
dialog: muscles.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: (softly)
dialog: The rising moon climaxes our
dialog: love, Den. Is is a sign, a
dialog: new beginning.
speaker_heading: DEN
dialog: Yes, a sign.
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: I had no idea what she was
text: talking about.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: (stroking him)
dialog: Neverwhere is a troubled land,
dialog: but together we could calm it.
dialog: We could rule side by side.
dialog: Your strength has brought great
dialog: peace to my restless body. It
dialog: could bring great peace to all
dialog: the troubled people of this land.
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: I knew I was good, but I didn't know
dialog: I was that good.
text: Suddenly the Captain and his guards burst through the door.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Your Majesty! The Loc-Nar is missing
dialog: - stolen!
text: The QUEEN jumps to her feet in a rage and points to DEN.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Fiend! You make love to me while
dialog: your accomplices steal the magic
dialog: sphere! Guards! Take him!
text: The guards grab DEN as the QUEEN snatches one of their big
text: spiked clubs.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: (to guards)
dialog: Hold him still! I will kill
dialog: him myself!
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Boy, was she pissed off!
text: Heaving the guards aside, DEN breaks free and jumps out the
text: chamber window.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: THE CASTLE WALL
text: DEN falls down, down into the swirling waters of the castle
dialog: moat.
speaker_heading: (CUT TO)
speaker_heading: THE QUEEN
text: She is livid.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Prepare the flying lizards.
dialog: I want his head!
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE CASTLE
text: Pulling himself out of the moat, DEN knocks a guard off his
text: leopard/horse and rides off.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID
text: ARD is kneeling at the edge of the sacrificial pool. Beside
text: him sits a long glass case wrapped in chains. Through the
text: chains we see KATHERINE trapped inside - fully conscious and
text: terrified. Ard's bestial warriors stand all around carrying
text: torches and spears.
text: Above them, the Loc-Nar sits glowing in the stone idol's hand.
speaker_heading: ARD
dialog: By the power of the magic Loc-Nar
dialog: placed in your idol's hands, I
dialog: command you - come forth Uluhtec!
text: The green water in the pool immediately begins to churn
text: violently and leap into the air. A bolt of lightning
text: crackles in the sky.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: THE NEVERWHERE DESERT
text: DEN is racing across the barren desert on his leopard/horse.
text: Visible in the distance is the outline of the huge, truncated
text: pyramid where he first saved KATHERINE.
text: As he rides, he sees the green glow of the Loc-Nar, sparkling
text: in the glass surfaces of the coffin in front of it.
speaker_heading: DEN
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Katherine!
text: He spurs his leopard/horse on into the night.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: ANOTHER PART OF THE NEVERWHERE DESERT

speaker_heading: of DEN.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER

dialog: There he is, your Majesty!
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: QUEEN'S P.O.V.
text: Up ahead, silhouetted in the moonlight, she sees DEN, riding up

text: atop the torch-lit pyramid.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: The Loc-Nar!
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: THE QUEEN
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: (shouting to her men)
dialog: Faster! To the pyramid!
text: She whips her lizard harder.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID
text: ARD is incanting to the raging water while two hooded monks
text: stand beside him, holding the struggling KATHERINE out over
dialog: the pool.
speaker_heading: ARD
dialog: Here is your sacrifice, Uluhtec.
dialog: Now, give me your power!
dialog: (to monks)
dialog: Throw her in.
text: Chanting the name "Uluhtec", the two monks start to throw
text: the girl in when suddenly a third monk leaps forward and
text: grabs her, kicking the other two monks into the water.
text: The intruder's hood falls away and his bald head gleams in the
text: moonlight.
speaker_heading: DEN
dialog: Katherine!
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Den!
speaker_heading: ARD
dialog: No! You'll ruin everything!
text: ARD jumps up and runs toward the Loc-Nar, perched in the stone
text: idol's hand. Grabbing it, ARD holds the glowing ball above him.
speaker_heading: ARD
dialog: (to his guards)
dialog: Kill them! Kill them both!
text: Suddenly, a hand leaps out of the darkness, gripping the
text: Loc-Nar just above Ard's hand - it is the QUEEN.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: The Loc-Nar is mine!
speaker_heading: ARD
dialog: (struggling)
dialog: Stupid bitch! Get away from me!
text: As ARD and the QUEEN fight over the Loc-Nar, the Queen's troops
text: pour in and battle with Ard's soldiers. Thunder roars overhead.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: DEN
text: Holding KATHERINE in one arm, DEN smashes a nearby soldier and
text: grabs the beast's spear. With the battle raging all around
text: him, DEN looks up at the sky.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: THE SKY
text: Lightning crackles, illuminating the night with electricity.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO
speaker_heading: DEN
text: DEN reaches down, picks up the long chain that was wrapped around
text: the glass case and attaches one end to his spear. He kicks the
text: other end into the raging water, then heaves the spear
text: with all his might into the head of the stone idol.
text: In the same instant, a bolt of lightning fires down from the sky,
text: striking the idol full force. The lightning bolt travels through
text: the spear and down the chain, into the water. Suddenly, the
text: electrical energy arcs across to join with the Loc-Nar.
text: Holding onto the Loc-Nar, ARD and the QUEEN begin to glow green,
text: then de-materialize into a shimmering dimensional warp. The
text: troops stop fighting and look on in amazement, until all
text: that remains is the glowing Loc-Nar, hanging in mid-air.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: (to Den)
dialog: Where did they go?
speaker_heading: DEN
dialog: They are gone. That is all
dialog: that matters.
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: They probably went back to Earth.
dialog: Boy, will Mom be surprised.
text: Suddenly, the Loc-Nar falls to the ground at Den's feet.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: (looking down)
dialog: The Loc-Nar ... you could have the
dialog: power of Uluhtec. You could be
dialog: ruler over all these people.
speaker_heading: DEN
text: (looking over the throng)
dialog: Forget it.
text: In a single powerful leap, DEN, carrying KATHERINE, bounds up
text: onto the Queen's flying lizard and they fly off. The amazed troops
text: watch for a moment, then shrug and resume fighting.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: DEN'S FLYING LIZARD
text: KATHERINE clings to DEN as they fly.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Oh, but Den, with the Loc-Nar
dialog: you could have returned to Earth.
speaker_heading: DEN
dialog: I like it better here.
text: The lizard banks sharply away from us and carries them into the
dialog: distance.
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: On Earth, I'm nobody. But here,
dialog: I am DEN.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID
text: The camera pans down the stone statue to the glowing sphere,
text: which lies abandoned on the ground. The soldiers are gone. As
text: we watch, time begins to accelerate and the Neverwhere Pyramid
text: ages and crumbles all around the green ball. The earth heaves
text: and shifts, and dense vegetarian grows up through the cracks in
dialog: the ground.
text: A prehistoric man walks up and sees the glowing ball under a fern.
text: Fascinated, he picks it up and looks at it, as the foot of a
text: Tyrannosaurus Rex comes down, crushing him.
text: Time advances again as the dinosaur becomes a skeleton, and
text: a Biblical tent-community grows up around the ball. In the
text: fire-light, the Nomadic tribesmen are watering their animals,
text: when one of the camels paws at the ground, uncovering the glowing
text: ball. Scared, the camel struggles and trys to break its ropes.
text: Out of nowhere a Roman Legion attacks, slaughtering the tribesmen.
text: Time accelerates again, and the conquering Romans build a temple,
text: placing the green ball in the head of a golden idol. Then the
text: Romans grow fat and debauched, while slave-girls feed them grapes.
text: As the ball glows, the temple crashes down around the debauched
text: Romans, covering them and the green ball in rubble.
text: Over the ruins of the temple, a succession of primitive mud and
text: clay huts evolve into the thatched-roof cottages of a Medieval
dialog: village.
text: A Medieval stone-cutter finds the ball, and mortars it in with
text: his stones as he builds a water well in the centre of the village.
text: Satisfied with his work, he lowers the bucket to draw himself
text: a drink. Behind him, an ox-cart comes roaring around a corner.
text: The axle breaks and a heavy wooden wheel careens along, striking
text: the stone-cutter in the back and knocking him into the well.
text: Time advances once more as the Medieval village grows and
text: transforms into a Victorian-style town. It is evening, and
text: the stone well now sits under a gazebo at the centre of a gas-
text: lit village green.
text: A fancy carriage carrying a Victorian gentleman passes by and
text: circles the green.
text: Moving in through a window across the street, we see a seductive-
text: looking woman dressing herself in black garters and lace. This
text: is intercut with the carriage circling the green, until the
text: woman, who looks like a high-class harlot, finishes dressing and
text: leaves her room. Crossing the street, she walks up to the gazebo
text: and leans provocatively up against the well.
text: The gentleman gets out of his carriage, approaches the woman
text: and propositions her. She smiles, touches, and teases him. We
text: pan down their legs to the green ball glowing in the well-wall.
text: Suddenly red blood begins to drip over the ball, and the woman's
text: body falls to the ground. The camera pans up to the well-bucket,
text: where the gentleman is washing the blood from his hands.
text: As time begins to move forward again, the man ages and hobbles
text: away, as the well crumbles and cheap turn-of-the-century row-
text: housing grows up, covering the green ball. The town becomes
text: dirtier and blacker, and smokestacks blow soot into the morning
text: sky. Almost on cue, the doors of the houses open, and grim
text: coal-miners emerge, shuffling through the filthy streets on
dialog: their way to work.
text: The camera pans down to a drain in the gutter. A rat appears.
text: Panning back up, the street is now empty. A bell is heard
text: ringing, and a horse-drawn Red Cross cart pulls around a corner
text: and into view. Masked workers follow the cart. One rings
text: the bell, while the others pull corpses from the doorways and
text: load them into the cart. The gutters and windowsills are now
text: full of rats. Time advances again and the buildings become
text: deserted derelicts. Their decaying timbers groan under the
dialog: weight.
text: A support snaps, and one of the buildings starts to collapse.
text: Falling amidst the crumbling plaster and rotting wood is the
text: glowing green ball. As the ball hits the ground, it is covered
text: over by rubble.
text: The rubble becomes bleached by the hot sun and the landscape
text: grows drier. Sand blows all around, covering over everything.
text: As the sandstorm clears, the entire terrain is nothing but
text: desert. In the distance we can see a group of people walking.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
speaker_heading: PEOPLE
text: The people appears to be a band of aboriginal workmen, carrying
text: futuristic laser-shovels over their shoulders. They are led by
text: a goateed archaeologist with an elaborate metal detector. As
text: he walks, his detector starts bleeping. He points to a spot
text: on the ground, and the natives start digging with their laser-
text: shovels.
text: One of the workers finds something.
speaker_heading: WORKER
dialog: Kuma! Kuma! Kuma!
text: The archaeologist waves the workers away and directs a tread-
text: driven shovel-sifter up to the spot. The shovel-sifter digs
text: in and pulls up a large chunk of desert. When the sand has
text: sifted out, we see the tarnished Loc-Nar in the machine's grip.
text: It is not glowing. The machine swivels, and a native foreman
text: plucks the Loc-Nar from the shovel-sifter's teeth.
text: As the foreman touches it, the Loc-Nar starts glowing brightly.
text: The foreman's hands turn green. He looks at his green hands,
text: then he looks over to the archaeologist. Suddenly the foreman's
text: entire body glows green, and crumbles into dust.
text: The archaeologist and the natives stare in horror at the
text: glowing Loc-Nar, lying in the pile of green dust.

scene_heading: NEW YORK - AERIAL SHOT - DAY
text: The camera comes down from high above the city. The general

speaker_heading: HARRY
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: Yeah, New York, big deal. Scum-centre

text: Moving down through the skyscrapers, the city gets dirtier and

text: in the garbage-filled street.
speaker_heading: HARRY
speaker_heading: (V.O.)
dialog: ... and now they're talking about
dialog: letting in low-lifes from other planets,
dialog: too.
text: Under the narration, the camera turns a corner and zooms down
text: through the roof of a parked taxicab. It stops full frame on
text: the newspaper held in the cabdriver's hands. A slow pan across
text: the front page reveals that the paper is the New York Times,
dialog: July 6, 2031
text: One headline reads: "400,000 Traffic Deaths Over Holiday Weekend".
text: Another reads: "Venus Declared 73rd State".
text: The camera stops on a headline reading: "Professor Discovers
dialog: Ancient Relic --- to be shown in N.Y. Museum".
text: There is an accompanying photo of the goateed archaeologist and
