scene_heading: 1	FULL FRAME - WHITE NOISE
text: Credits begin. The entire frame is filled with white noise within which one can make out thefaint
text: image of a television program. Every few moments the channel changes, revealing a new ghostly
dialog: image.
text: The camera pulls back very slowly. We reveal that this image is coming from a twenty seven inch
dialog: television.
text: The camera pulls back some more and we see a man's hand enter frame holding a remote
text: control. The hand changes channels frantically.
text: The camera pulls back into its final position and we see STEVEN BARTOWSKY, thirty
text: years old, sitting on his couch. He is trying to find a channel with viewable reception.
text: Unfortunately for him  his cable is not hooked up.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (looks at watch)
dialog: Jesus, where's the cable guy already?
scene_heading: END OF CREDIT SEQUENCE
scene_heading: 1A	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: It is a stylish old apartment. There are half unpacked boxes strewn about the floor. Steven has just
text: moved in. The phone rings.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: Hello.
scene_heading: 2	NEWSROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: We see Steven's best friend RICK standing in the middle of a busy newsroom. He is a rough
text: looking, cynical local news cameraman. In the background, hanging from the ceiling is a television
dialog: set.
text: ON THE TV - An anchorman sits at his desk fixing his hair as he waits to go on the air. A graphic
text: on the screen says "Sam Sweet Trial Update."
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: How's the move going?
scene_heading: 3	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: Steven unpacks as they speak. The phone call intercuts between the two locations.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
text: Horrible. The cable guy is missing in
dialog: action. Apparently he's going to be here
dialog: sometime between eight AM and my death.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: You haven't called Robin have you?
dialog: Please tell me you didn't call her.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: No, I'm giving her space.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I can't believe she's doing this.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: You never should have asked her to marry
dialog: you. You're the mad smotherer.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: All she had to do was say no. She didn't
dialog: have to kick me out. I feel like Felix
dialog: Unger.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: You forced her to evaluate the
dialog: relationship. If you didn't propose she
dialog: would never have realized how unhappy she
dialog: was.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I don't want to talk about it.
dialog: So what time are you going to come by?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I can't. I'm working double shifts the
dialog: rest of the week.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: It's my first night here. Don't do this
dialog: to me.
speaker_heading: RICK
text: The other camera guy pulled out his back.
dialog: Besides, I spent the last two weeks with
dialog: you on my couch. Isn't that enough?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Fine, fine.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: One piece of advice. Slip the cable guy
dialog: fifty bucks, he'll give you all the movie
dialog: channels for free. Even the dirty ones.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I couldn't. I'm not good at that stuff.
dialog: What if he says no? I'll feel like an
dialog: idiot.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: None of them say no, believe me. I'll
dialog: talk to you later.
text: Steven hangs up, and waits.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 4	INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER
text: Steven continues unpacking. He is very neat. He opens a box and finds a pictures of him with his
text: ex-girlfriend. He looks at one sadly, considering whether or not to put it on display. He puts it
text: back in the box.
scene_heading: 4A	EXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
text: Establishing shot of a renovated apartment building built in the nineteen twenties. A moving truck
text: pulls into a gated side garage.
scene_heading: 5	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - LATER
text: Movers deliver a small breakfast table and chairs. Steven directs them as to where to put them.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP OF CLOCK - 3:52 P.M.
scene_heading: 6	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - LATER
text: Steven puts a few feet of tin foil on his antenna to help the reception. He changes channels. Still
text: nothing. He pulls it off frustrated.
scene_heading: 7	INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER
text: Many of the boxes are gone. Steven lies on the couch, staring at the ceiling, fidgeting. He is unable
dialog: to fill his day without cable.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Where the hell is he?
scene_heading: 8	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - LATER
text: Steven paces back and forth across the room. He stares at his watch frequently.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP OF CLOCK - 5:12 P.M.
scene_heading: 9	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - LATER
text: Steven slowly eats a sandwich in his empty kitchen. He looks at the clock. It says five-thirty. He
text: picks up the phone and dials. A machine picks up.
speaker_heading: ROBIN (VO)
dialog: Hi, this is Robin. Leave a message. If
dialog: you are trying to reach Steven he can now
dialog: be reached at 555-3837.
text: Steven hangs up.
scene_heading: 10	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - SUNSET
text: Steven does sit ups. He looks at the clock.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP OF THE CLOCK - 6:48 P.M.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Forget it. Idiots.
text: He gets up, and walks into the bathroom.
scene_heading: 11	INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Steven gets undressed. He turns on the shower, adjusts the heat, then gets in. He tries to lose his
text: tension by letting the hot water engulf him. He takes some shampoo, and lathers up his hair.
scene_heading: THE DOORBELL RINGS
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: Oh great.
scene_heading: THE DOORBELL RINGS SEVERAL TIMES
text: Steven jumps out of the shower, soaking wet, throws on a bathrobe and runs to the door.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Don't leave! I'm here! I'm here!
scene_heading: 12	INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Steven runs to the door.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY (OS)
dialog: Hello! Cable Guy!
text: Steven reaches the door, and looks through the peep-hole.
scene_heading: P.O.V. THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE
text: The CABLE GUY is walking away.
scene_heading: INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM/HALLWAY - DAY
text: Steven opens the door and yells to the Cable Guy.
dialog: (Revised 11/14/95 - Pink)
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Hey, wait!
text: The Cable Guy turns back.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Well, look who decided to show up. I was
dialog: just gonna go collect my retirement
dialog: pension.
text: The Cable Guy wears a clean white jump suit, and is extremely confident despite the fact that he
text: speaks with a slight lisp. This lisp gives him a child-like quality.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You were supposed to be here four hours
dialog: ago.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Was I? So I'm the tardy one. Good to
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Yes. I had to go to the Bed 'n Bath
dialog: place, but now it's closed.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: (turns to leave)
dialog: Maybe I shouldn't have come at all  jerk
dialog: off!
dialog: (turns back smiling)
dialog: I'm just joking. Let's do this.
dialog: (looks around)
dialog: Oh, the old McNair place. I never thought
dialog: they'd get the floors clean after what
dialog: happened here.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: (long beat)
dialog: They had a lot of cats.
text: They walk into Steven's living room.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Hey, this could be a cool pad. Here is a
dialog: comment card.
text: He pulls out a card, and hands it to Steven without turning back to look at him.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Please mail it in when I am done.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: These go to your boss?
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: No, they go to me. I'm a
dialog: perfectioniss perfectioniss
dialog: (he strains to lose his lisp)
dialog: perfectionisst.
dialog: Now let's take a look at what we're
dialog: dealing with.
text: The Cable Guy walks around the room with his hands out, sensing the space.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Come on baby. Come on baby. Talk to me
dialog: baby. Tell me where you like it. That's
dialog: it baby.
text: He zones in on one wall. He fells the wall in a sensuous manner.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Here's your sweet spot.
text: He pulls out his drill, and begins drilling.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: So your lady kicked you out.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: In preparing your service I noticed you
dialog: were previously wired across town at 1268
dialog: and a half Chestnut. Last week the
dialog: billing was transferred to one Robin
dialog: Harris. Smells like heartbreak to me.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I really don't want to talk about it with
dialog: you. Could you please just install my
dialog: cable? I'm going to get dressed.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: No sweat.
text: Steven walks away, into the hallway. A moment later the Cable Guy runs to him.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Hey, I'm going to go to the hallway so I
dialog: can access the floorboards. Don't be
dialog: spooked if you hear someone crawling
dialog: underneath you.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Okay, whatever.
text: Steven walks toward his bedroom.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Put on your bathing suit 'cause you'll be
text: channel surfing in no time.
text: The Cable Guy pulls the trigger on his drill twice to punctuate his joke.
scene_heading: 13	INT. - STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER
scene_heading: CLOSE UP - THE TELEVISION
text: RIKKI KLIEMAN from COURT TV broadcasts from their studio.
speaker_heading: RIKKI KLIEMAN
dialog: (to camera)
text: So ends day fifty-four of the trial of
dialog: former child star Sam Sweet who has been
dialog: accused of shooting his twin brother,
dialog: Stan, in cold blood. The twins were
dialog: stars of the hit sitcom "Double Trouble"
dialog: which aired from nineteen seventy-seven
dialog: till nineteen eighty-four.
text: A video package rolls in - We see several photographs of Sam Sweet and his twin brother at
text: various ages. Included is the cast photo of "Double Trouble." Pictured in the photo are eight-year-
text: old Stan and Sam and Conrad Janis as their single dad.
text: We see a brief clip from "Double Trouble," starring the two eight-year-old boys, then a shot of
text: Sam Sweet being taken out of a police car in handcuffs.
speaker_heading: RIKKI KLIEMAN
dialog: (to camera)
dialog: Life wasn't so sweet after the cancellation
dialog: of their program. Hollywood chewed them
text: up and spit them out. A frustrated Sam
text: turned to petty larceny, while his more
dialog: impressionable brother, Stan, fell in
dialog: with a fringe cult called "The
dialog: Brotherhood of Friends." Reduced to
text: tabloid fodder a fury was growing inside
dialog: of Sam. A burning need to be recognized
dialog: as an individual, not a person famous for
dialog: having an identical twin. A need that
text: took the form of four shotgun blasts on
dialog: the night of November fourteenth. And so
dialog: today his attorneys continue the unusual
dialog: defense of "Twin Envy."
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: Steven re-enters the room. The Cable Guy is watching television.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: How's it going?
text: The Cable Guy holds up one finger as if to say "quiet." His eyes never leave the TV.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Guilty, guilty, guilt-freakin-tee. I
dialog: hope they fry this bastard.
text: Steven sees that the Cable Guy has completely redecorated the room in a fashion which makes the
text: room impractical for anything other than watching television. The TV is now on the stairs
text: blocking the entrance into the living room. All furniture faces the TV, making conversation
dialog: impossible.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (looks around)
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: (jumps to his feet)
dialog: The arrangement of your major appliances
dialog: and your furniture was causing some noisy
dialog: pics and hum bars in your reception. I
text: moved a few things. Cleared it right up.
dialog: Is that cool?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (non-confrontational)
dialog: I guess so.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: You programmed?
dialog: (off of Steven's look)
dialog: Then let me slave your remotes.
text: He picks up Steven's remotes, punches in a complicated series of commands, then points them at
text: each other. As he holds them together he makes a face as if their power is surging through him.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Ooh, maybe we should leave these two
dialog: alone.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: So after this I'll only need one remote
dialog: for everything?
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: You know you're pretty good at this. You
dialog: could be a cable guy yourself.
dialog: (he finishes)
dialog: Now let me check your levels.
text: With amazing alacrity he adjusts color setting, sound controls, closed captioned, etc. Then he
text: clicks through the channels. A music video, documentary on Hitler, Oprah Winfrey Show, starving
text: kids, Barney, court TV. The Cable Guy watches emotionless.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: All right. That about does it. I just
dialog: have some paperwork for you to fill out.
dialog: Sign here.
dialog: Steven does.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: That gave me power of attorney over you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Joking.
text: Steven laughs. The Cable Guy joins him, but then continues to laugh way too hard for way too
text: long. As the laugh ends it quickly turns into an awkward moment. The Cable Guy does not want
dialog: to leave.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: I'm about finished here.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Okay. I feel good about this.
text: Cable Guy walks to the door.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: One thing.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: (turns back immediately)
dialog: Yeah!
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I uh I have this friend and he said
dialog: he gave his cable guy fifty bucks and he
dialog: got free movie channels. Have you ever
dialog: heard of anything like that?
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: (deadly serious)
dialog: You mean illegal cable?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Uh yes.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Who told you that? I want his name.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Forget it.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: You're offering me a bribe? What you
dialog: have just done is illegal, and in this
dialog: state if convicted, you could be fined
dialog: five-thousand dollars or spend six months
text: in a correctional facility.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Please that was dumb. I was just
dialog: making conversation 
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: I'm just jerking your chain. Wake up
dialog: little snoozy. I'll juice you up. All
text: it is is a push of a button.
text: He puts his arm around Steven and walks him toward the front door.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Oh, great. How much?
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Don't worry about it. I couldn't charge
dialog: you. Your girl just booted you.
dialog: Consider it one guy doing another guy a
dialog: solid.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: That is so nice.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Hey, you're a 'nice' guy. You'd be
dialog: surprised how many customers treat you
dialog: like shit, like I'm a god damn plumber or
dialog: something.
dialog: (hands him a card)
dialog: Here is my personal beeper number. It's
dialog: just for my preferred customers. Never
dialog: call the company, they'll just put you on
dialog: hold.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Thanks. Really.
dialog: (holds up comment card - jokes)
dialog: You're gonna get some good marks here.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Maybe some day I'll take you out to the
dialog: satellite and show you how all this stuff
dialog: works. It's really incredible.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Sure. We should do that one day.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: How 'bout tomorrow?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Tomorrow? Tomorrow's not good.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: What are you going to do, sit home and
dialog: stew about your ex?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: (insulted)
dialog: Oh, okay. I guess I crossed the line.
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (guilty)
dialog: You didn't cross the line.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: No? Cool. I'll pick you up at six-thirty.
text: On the flip side.
text: The Cable Guy leaves before Steven can reconsider. Steven cannot believe he just got roped into
dialog: that.
dialog: (End Revision - Pink)
scene_heading: 14	INT. CITYWIDE LAND DEVELOPERS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: Steven is in the middle of a presentation to his co-workers. His boss, HAL DANIELS, looks
dialog: impressed.
text: Steven pulls a sheet off of an architect's model of a condominium complex.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: There are twenty-four classrooms; each
dialog: can be converted into a 1400 square foot
text: home. The facility has two tennis courts,
text: an Olympic size pool and full gym, with a
dialog: stage if the residents decide they want
dialog: to perform "Oklahoma."
text: Everyone laughs. Steven is very good at his job.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: The kitsch appeal of living in an old
dialog: schoolhouse should be very attractive to
text: young, upwardly mobile home buyers. And
dialog: most important, the structure is
dialog: available in foreclosure. If we put down
dialog: a cash bid, we're going to steal this
dialog: thing.
text: There is a pause, then everyone applauds. Mr. Daniels walks over to Steven and puts a proud arm
text: around him. They speak as the meeting breaks up.
speaker_heading: MR. DANIELS
dialog: Great work Steve-o. So you're feeling
dialog: good?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MR. DANIELS
dialog: Did I hear something about you having
dialog: some troubles at home?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Robin and I have been having a difficult
dialog: time. I moved out, but I really think
dialog: it's only temporary.
speaker_heading: MR. DANIELS
dialog: Gotcha. I love this project, but it's a
dialog: big mother. Know what I mean? If it
dialog: fails, corporate's going to have my ass.
dialog: I've got confidence in you, but you hear
dialog: where I'm coming from, bro?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Absolutely. Now I've got more time than
dialog: ever. It's a good thing.
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: I know I can pull this thing off.
speaker_heading: MR. DANIELS
dialog: (playfully)
dialog: Then what are you doing talking to me?
dialog: You've got a lot of work to do. Get to
dialog: it!
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Thank you. I will.
text: Hal goes down the stairs to his office. Steven watches him disappear, then turns to his secretary,
speaker_heading: JOAN.

dialog: I'll be right back.

scene_heading: 16	INT. ROBIN'S OFFICE AT SASSY MAGAZINE - DAY
text: ROBIN HARRIS, an attractive woman in her late twenties, sits at her desk at "Sassy Magazine."
text: Her office is fairly nice, but she is definitely not at the upper level of the company yet. There are
text: papers spread all over her desk. On her walls are pictures from the magazine, and articles she has
dialog: written.
text: Steven peeks his head in her door.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Hello.
text: Robin's face drops.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Steven, what are you doing here?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I was just in the area. Thought I'd pop
dialog: by. How's work? How'd the big teen crush
dialog: article come out?
dialog: (Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: They liked it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I thought we agreed we weren't going to
dialog: see each other for a month.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I know, it's just Daniels accepted my
text: proposal to renovate the old schoolhouse.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: That's wonderful, congratulations.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I know I'm breaking the rules, but come
dialog: have dinner with me tonight to celebrate.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I don't think we should.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Come on, this is the biggest day of my
dialog: career.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Don't put me in this position.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: What position? I want to share this with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: (feeling pressured)
dialog: I love you, but I need to take some time
dialog: on my own to see how I feel. You agreed
dialog: to this. I mean this is exactly why we
dialog: broke up, because you never listen to me.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: What? Now we're broken up? What
dialog: happened to 'trial separation?'
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I can't get into this now. If you haven't
dialog: noticed, I'm at work.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Sorry to disturb you.
text: He turns to leave.
dialog: (Revised 11/14/95 - Pink)
speaker_heading: ROBIN

scene_heading: 17A	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - SIX-THIRTY P.M.
text: Steven is watching television. He looks lonely and depressed. He clicks around in a daze, never
text: stopping for more than a second.
text: He hears a horn honking outside.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY (OS)
dialog: Steven!!!! Stev-ey!!!! Let's go!!!!
text: ON THE TV - A commercial for Medieval Times Restaurant.
text: Steven walks over to the window and sees The Cable Guy standing in front of his van, leaning in
text: his window honking the horn.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Steven!!!!
dialog: (waves)
dialog: Hey buddy!!! Come on down!!!
text: Steven waves and then steps back from the window. He doesn't know what to do. He looks at the
dialog: television.
text: ON THE TV - The local news.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
text: Coming up next a special report,
dialog: "Loneliness, America's Silent Killer."
text: Steven looks back out the window and sees the Cable Guy smiling and waving for him to come

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (begins walking to the door)
dialog: What the hell.
scene_heading: 18	EXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DUSK
text: Steven walks from his apartment to the customized van. On the side of the white van it says, "The
dialog: Cable Company - Get Wired Today."
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: How's it going?
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
text: Howdy partner. Climb aboard.
text: Steven gets in.
scene_heading: 19	INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS
text: The van drives onto the main boulevard.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Thanks for coming out. You know most
dialog: people think cable is just a simple co-ax
text: that comes out of the wall. They never
dialog: take the time to understand how it works.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Where exactly are we goin?
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: We're going to take a ride on the
dialog: information superhighway.
scene_heading: 20	EXT. CITY - DUSK
text: Birds eye P.O.V., shot follows the Cable Guy's van as it drives through the city.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: It all started in Lansford,
dialog: Pennsylvania where Panther Valley
text: Television, with the assistance of Jerrod
dialog: Electronics, created the first cable
dialog: television system.
text: The van drives up into the hills, finally revealing a huge satellite dish on top of a small mountain,
text: overlooking the entire city.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: I went to Lansford once. It's the Cable
dialog: Guy's Mecca. It was very emotional.
scene_heading: 21	EXT. WOODED AREA - DUSK
text: Steven and the Cable Guy get out of the van, and walk down a trail.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: I come here to think sometimes. To clear
dialog: my head.
text: They turn a corner and the satellite dish is right in front of them. It is enormous. Next to it is a
text: one-hundred and fifty foot antenna. Next to that is a small fenced-in shack where the satellite's
text: controls are located.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
text: There she is. Right now she's sending
dialog: entertainment and information to millions
dialog: of satisfied citizens.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: That's pretty impressive.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: See, I knew the moment I met you that
dialog: you would appreciate this.
text: The Cable Guy runs to the dish. A few seconds later he appears inside of it.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: (with wonder)
dialog: The future is now. Soon every American
dialog: home will integrate their television,
dialog: phone, and computer. You'll be able to
dialog: visit the Louvre on one channel, and
dialog: watch female mud wrestling on
dialog: another. You can do your shopping at
dialog: home, or play Mortal Kombat with a friend
dialog: in Vietnam. There's no end to the
dialog: possibilities.
dialog: (waves to Steven)
dialog: Come on up! What are you waiting for?!
scene_heading: 22	INT. SATELLITE DISH - NIGHT
text: The Cable Guy and Steven are lying in the middle of the dish, looking up at the night sky.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Sometimes I'll sit here and imagine that
dialog: there are billions of bits of information
dialog: surging through me.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I've watched a lot of TV in my life. I
dialog: guess I've always taken it for granted.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: When I was a kid my mom worked nights.
dialog: Never met dad. But the old TV was always
dialog: there for me.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I know what you mean. My dad was there,
dialog: but he might as well have been gone. My
dialog: mom is a stewardess. She was always out
dialog: of town.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: (moved)
dialog: That's tough. You must have a lot of
dialog: abandonment issues. Reality isn't "Father
dialog: Knows Best," it's a kick in the face on
dialog: Saturday night. But what doesn't kill us
dialog: makes us stronger, right?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (tentative)
dialog: You know my brother's a speech therapist.
text: The Cable Guy sits up. He looks angry.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: So?
text: There is a long silence. Steven doesn't know how to react.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Never mind.
text: The Cable Guy sits back down and pretends Steven never mentioned it.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So, you're pretty love struck about your
dialog: lady, huh?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I miss her. I asked her to marry me, and
dialog: she asked me to move out.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: I hate that.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: She said she felt pressured. Can you
dialog: believe that?
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Women are a labyrinth. Can I be frank? I
dialog: don't think you listen to her. I think
dialog: you try to tell her what she wants to
dialog: hear. She wants you to thirst for
dialog: knowledge about who she is. All the
text: complicated splendor that is woman. When
dialog: your love is truly giving, it will come
dialog: back to you ten-fold.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You're right. That is remarkably
dialog: insightful.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Yeah, it was Jerry Springer's final
text: thought on Friday's show.
scene_heading: 23	EXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER
text: The van pulls up in front of Steven's apartment building.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: You know what? Women are suckers for
dialog: "Sleepless in Seattle." It's on HBO this
dialog: month. That's your bait right there.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Robin loves that movie.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: They all do. Next time you talk to her
dialog: tell her you're cooking yourself dinner,
dialog: and watching it by yourself. Sound like
dialog: you're happier than a pig in shit.
dialog: She'll come running. Betcha. Then just
dialog: play it cool.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Maybe I will.
text: Steven gets out of the car.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Thanks a lot. I'm embarrassed to say
dialog: this, but I don't know your name. What
dialog: is it?
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: (touched)
dialog: You really want to know my name? You do?
dialog: Really? It's Ernie Douglas. But my
dialog: friends call me Chip.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I'll see ya' Chip.
text: Before he can exit the van, the Cable Guy is staring him in the eyes.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Let's just remember right now. You know
dialog: some people walk through their entire
dialog: lives and never find a true friend.
dialog: (long pause)
dialog: I guess we're the lucky ones.
dialog: (End Revised - Pink)
text: STEVEN'S P.O.V. - The Cable Guy is in slow motion. He blinks once.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Uh good-bye.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Later buddy. I'll catch ya' on the
dialog: flip side.
text: Steven exits the van feeling a little uncomfortable.
scene_heading: 24	INT. COFFEEHOUSE - NEXT DAY
text: Steven and Robin are talking. Robin does not look happy to see him.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I don't listen to you. I pretend to
dialog: understand but I'm really just saying
dialog: what I think you want to hear. So from
dialog: now on I'm going to try my best to listen
dialog: more because I do love you and am
dialog: interested in learning about every detail
dialog: about the complicated splendor that is
dialog: you.
text: Robin looks at him, somewhat shocked.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I want us to get back together, but I can
dialog: see why taking this time might be good
dialog: for us. So, I'm not mad.
text: After a long beat, Robin smiles.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Sometimes time apart is healthy.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You're right. Well, that's what I came
dialog: here to say. Look, I've got to get back
text: to the office.
text: He starts getting up.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: So, are you doing anything tomorrow?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I'm just going to cook myself dinner and
dialog: watch a movie. "Sleepless in Seattle" is
dialog: on cable.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: If you're around you should drop by and
dialog: check out the new apartment.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Okay, maybe I will.
text: He exits the room. As he does we see a television broadcasting the Sweet case.
text: ON MTV - Sam Sweet sits behind the defendant's table. TABITHA SOREN is giving the news
dialog: update.
speaker_heading: TABITHA SOREN
dialog: Today in the Sam Sweet case the
dialog: prosecution played the 911 call that Sam
dialog: Sweet made the night he murdered his

text: The courtroom listens to a 911 phone call. The transcription is seen on the screen.
text: SAM SWEET V ON THE TAPE
dialog: (crying and babbling)
dialog: Hello, please send help. My twin brother
text: has been shot.
speaker_heading: 911 OPERATOR
dialog: Slow down sir. What happened?
speaker_heading: SAM SWEET
dialog: Oh my god, they shot him with a shot gun
dialog: four times. I mean I think it was a
dialog: shotgun. Who would do such a thing?! I
dialog: think it was an Asian gang or something.
dialog: They were speaking some other language.
text: Sam leans over and whispers something in his lawyer's ear.
speaker_heading: TABITHA SOREN
dialog: Hmm. Who indeed? Coming up next, a rare
dialog: interview with Michael Jackson's zoo-
dialog: keeper.
scene_heading: 25	INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM - DAY
text: Steven is playing a pick-up, full court basketball game with some of his friends. It is a competitive,
text: but friendly game. Steven is on skins, Rick is on shirts.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Here, here, here.
text: A player passes to Steven. Rick is covering him. Steven drives to the basket and puts in a lay up.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Shit! My fault! My fault!
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Not your fault. I'm in the zone. There
dialog: is no stopping me today.
text: Play begins again. A player named JEFF takes the ball out, then passes to a heavy-set player who
text: catches the ball, then drives to the basket. When he does he twists his ankle, dropping the ball. The
text: ball rolls out of bounds into a dark corner of the gym. We follow it as it rolls on the ground until it
text: hits a man's sneaker. A pair of hands pick up the ball. The camera tilts up the man's body. It is the
text: Cable Guy. He is holding another ball. He starts dribbling the two balls in a circular pattern.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Hey, you guys play here, too? Cool. I
dialog: was just in the neighborhood. Thought I'd
text: run the court for a couple of innings.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (gestures to injured player)
dialog: Great. We need another man.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: This is Chip Douglas my cable guy.
text: Rick smiles in recognition.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: We met about a week ago during a routine
dialog: installation, but I feel like I've known
dialog: him my whole life.
text: Steven can't believe this is happening.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Oh really. That's sweet. All right Chip
dialog: Douglas, you're on shirts. Let's play.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: No, I want to be on Steven's team. I'm
dialog: skins.
text: The Cable Guy quickly takes off his shirt. Steven looks shocked because underneath his clothes he
text: is rippled with muscles. The dichotomy between his nerdy face, and his awesome physique is
dialog: scary.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I don't care, I'll be shirts. Let's just
dialog: play.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Wait a sec'. I've got to warm up.
text: The Cable Guy starts running wind sprints across the court, touching all the main lines. Everyone
text: stares at him until he finishes.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Let's get it on!
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Are you any good?
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Feed me under the boards and you'll find
dialog: out.
text: Play begins. The shirts inbound to Jeff. The Cable Guy is all over him, covering him as tightly as
text: humanly possible. He keeps his hands near Jeff's face, whacks him in the back as he dribbles, etc.
text: He couldn't be more annoying. Jeff passes to Rick who drives to the basket and puts up a shot
text: which goes in. Rick and Jeff slap hands.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: (doing the traveling hand signal)
dialog: Traveling! That's traveling!
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Yeah, whatever you say Chip.
text: Everyone runs down the court, ignoring him.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: All right, so we're playing that type of
dialog: game. Prison rules. I get it.
text: Steven takes the ball out. The cable Guy runs around the court, attempting to get open. He criss
text: crosses all over the court.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Feed me the rock! Feed me the rock! I'm
dialog: open!
text: Steven passes to the Cable Guy, who drives to the basket, pushing Jeff out of the way in the
text: process. The ball goes in.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: (does the foul hand signal)
dialog: And one! That's definitely a foul!
dialog: (to Jeff)
dialog: You want to mug me, my wallet is in my
dialog: other pants.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (to Cable Guy)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Don't play from fear Steven. We can take
dialog: these guys.
scene_heading: MUSIC UP - SLOW MOTION - STEVEN'S P.O.V.
text: a. The shirts put a shot which doesn't go in. The Cable Guy swings his elbows wildly as he pulls it
dialog: down.
text: b. The Cable Guy drives to the basket in slow motion violently taking down two men, including
dialog: Rick.
text: c. Rick drives to the basket. On his way he fakes out Steven who falls to the floor. Rick scores.
text: The Cable guy helps Steven up. As the Cable Guy walks across the court he bangs shoulders
dialog: with Rick.
text: d. The cable Guy passes the ball to Steven, then sets a nasty pick against Rick, who goes down
dialog: hard.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Take it to the hole!
text: Steven is so un-nerved by the Cable Guy's behavior that he misses a simple lay up. Steven grabs
text: his own rebound. When he puts up a second shot, Rick gently fouls him. Steven stumbles to the
text: ground. The ball does not go in.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Hey, are you okay?
text: He pulls Steven up.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Yeah. I'm fine.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Let's switch. I'll cover Rick.
text: The cable Guy gets in Rick's face and gives him a death stare.
text: Steven takes out the ball. He passes to a teammate who passes it to the Cable Guy who drives to
text: the basket, then literally steps on Rick's back and leaps into the air and dunks the ball.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (enraged)
dialog: What the hell was that? That's it. I've
dialog: had enough.
text: Everyone begins to exit the court.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Thanks for bringing your "friend".
text: The Cable Guy runs up to Rick.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Good game.
dialog: (slaps Rick on the butt)
dialog: You were tough out there. Your play
dialog: brought me up to a higher level. I mean
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (dismissive)
dialog: Yeah.
text: He shakes his head and exits with the rest of the players.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: It was payback time. I was protecting
dialog: you.
dialog: (Revised 11/14/95 - Pink)
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You ruined the game.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: I don't appreciate your tone Steven.
dialog: That's not the way friends speak to each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: What are you talking about? I don't even
dialog: know you!
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Well let's fix that. Let me buy you a
dialog: Heineken?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: No, I'm going home.
text: Steven turns to leave.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Well, uh, I guess we'll talk later. I've
dialog: got to go shower up and do some stuff.
dialog: I'll call you if I get a chance. Or you
dialog: call me or something.
text: The Cable guy puts his hand up for Steven to high five. Steven slaps it halfheartedly. Then the
text: cable guy extends his palm out low by his knee.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: And down low.
text: Steven stares at it for a beat. The cable Guy waits. He'll wait as long as it takes. Finally Steven
text: gives him a low five just so he can leave.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
text: (pulls his hand away so Steven misses it)
dialog: Too slow. Have a good one.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (as he walks away)
dialog: Yeah, have a good one.

text: Steven runs in with a small bag of groceries. He is dressed for a date. He pulls out a bottle of

dialog: (beep tone)
dialog: I was just taking a whiz, thought you
dialog: might have called. Okay later.
dialog: (beep tone)
dialog: Sorry, I had call waiting, didn't get to
dialog: it, thought it might have been you. All
dialog: right, bye.
text: Steven is beginning to get a little wigged out by this. He fast forwards through a sampling of the
dialog: rest of the calls.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: (fast forwards)
dialog: We're having ourselves quite a little
dialog: game of phone tag here. You're it!
dialog: (fast forwards)
dialog: I was just blow drying my hair and I
dialog: thought I heard the phone ringing.
dialog: (fast forwards)
dialog: you're a tough man to reach.
dialog: (fast forwards)
dialog: I guess you're too busy to call your
dialog: friends.
dialog: (Revision Ends - Blue)
text: Steven fast forwards the machine. All he hears is sighing. Then 
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
speaker_heading: (ON THE MACHINE)
text: (long beat - then quiet and distant)
dialog: Shit.
text: The doorbell rings. Steven takes a deep breath then opens the door. It is Robin. She is dressed
text: casually, but looks beautiful.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Hey, good to see you.
text: There is an awkward moment where Steven intentionally doesn't kiss her hello.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Come on in. What do you think of the
dialog: place?
text: She looks at the odd placement of furniture.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: You made some interesting choices laying
text: out the room.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: That's actually where the movers put the

speaker_heading: ROBIN

text: The food is all eaten. Steven and Robin are sitting on the couch having an awkward conversation.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: So how's work?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Work's good.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: How's Hal?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Don't get me started. That guy has no
dialog: vision. It's like working for Mr. MaGoo.
dialog: He's just worthless.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: It's just great that you're getting to do
dialog: it. It's a real step up.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I know. Now if only someone at corporate
dialog: smartened up enough to dump Hal, then I
dialog: could really get some stuff done.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: It's nice to see you doing so well.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Well, it's nice just to see you.
dialog: (looks at his watch)
dialog: Hey, it should be starting.
text: They sit on the couch. Robin moves to sit in closer to Steven. Steven turns on the television. The
text: screen is filled with white noise. The sound is loud static. He changes channels looking for the
text: signal. Then fumbles with the remote control as he attempts to lower the volume.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Damn cable is out. Son of a bitch.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: It's alright. We can watch it another
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: No, no. We really should see it now.
dialog: Now's a good time.
text: He plays with the remote, hoping it will magically come back. It doesn't.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Wait, wait. I know what to do.
text: He walks over to the phone, then pulls the Cable Guy's beeper number out of his wallet. He dials
text: it, then presses the number in.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: The Cable Guy's a friend of mine. I'll
dialog: just page him. We'll have this fixed in
dialog: no time.
dialog: (Revised 11/14/95 - Pink)
text: Steven dials the Cable Guy's beeper number into the phone. The moment he is finished dialing 
text: THERE IS A KNOCK - THE CAMERA WHIP PANS TO THE DOOR
text: Steven walks to the door and opens it. Standing there is the Cable Guy looking dark and
text: disturbed, different than we've ever seen him before. Steven is startled.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: That was fast.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Is there a problem with your service?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Yeah my cable went out.
text: Steven pushes him out into the hall.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Really?
text: The Cable Guy holds up a cut cable cord.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: So you called me. Interesting how you
dialog: call when you need something. Is that how
dialog: you treat people?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I've been really busy. You've got to get
dialog: my cable going, Robin is here. This is
dialog: really important.
text: He peeks in to get a look at Robin. They make momentary eye contact. Steven pushes him back
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: But calling me back isn't?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I'm sorry. Please, you've got to help me.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Why should I help you? I gave you free
dialog: cable. What have you ever done for me?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Anything you want. Name it  quickly.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Tomorrow night, we hang out.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Fine, whatever you want.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: God bless you. You're too good to me.
text: The Cable Guy walks over to a fuse type box, turns one knob, then walks back to Steven.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: (loud-normally)
dialog: All set.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: So what's with the cut cord?
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: (nonchalantly)
dialog: That's for effect. See ya' tomorrow
dialog: Steven.
dialog: (conspiratorially)
dialog: She's pretty. And don't kiss her. Don't
dialog: even touch her. Fight the urge at all
dialog: costs. It will pay off later with
text: He makes a motion which implies sex.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Enjoy the flick.
text: The Cable Guy walks away. Steven walks back inside.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Who was that?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Nobody.

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Pretty well. We'll see. Look, about the

speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Only the best restaurant in town.
text: They walk around a corner.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY

dialog: Okay, but play it cool. Just turn like
dialog: you are looking for the waitress.
text: Steven puts up his hand, and turns as if he's going to call for the waitress. He sees the woman. She

text: cable Guy, annoyed.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Ha-ha. I'm just messing with your mind.

dialog: there. I just knew it.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Oh lord.
dialog: (tries to get back on track)
dialog: I want you to know --
text: The lights change. Trumpets play a fanfare. The host walks out onto the stage, interrupting
dialog: Steven.
speaker_heading: HOST
dialog: We have reached the climax of our
dialog: competition good people! Now, two noble
dialog: men from our audience will battle to the
dialog: death to resolve a grievance. Will a
dialog: Master...
text: (looks at his clipboard)
dialog: Steven M. Bartowsky and Lord Ernie
dialog: Douglas make you way to the fighting
dialog: pit!
text: A spotlight shines on them. Steven is shocked.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: We're going to do battle. It'll be fun.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Is this a normal part of the show?
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: No, but I give all the Knights free
dialog: cable. They said it would be cool if we
dialog: just went at it for a little while.
text: Two PIMPLY FACED SERFS from the show come and lead them away.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Is this safe?
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: That's what the armor's for.
scene_heading: 34	INT. FIGHTING PIT - LATER
text: Steven and the Cable Guy are being dressed in armor by the two serfs. The Cable Guy could not
text: be happier. Steven is freaked out.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: What are we supposed to do? We've got to
dialog: be careful we don't hurt each other.
text: The Cable Guy doesn't answer him. He has his game face on.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: I cannot listen to any of your
dialog: instructions for you are my sworn enemy,
dialog: and are about to meet your demise.
text: Before Steven can answer him the trumpets blare.
speaker_heading: HOST
dialog: Let the battle begin. Come now people,
dialog: let me hear your voices!
text: The crowd cheers. Music plays. The serfs hand them each a sword and shield, then walk them to
text: the center of the pit.
text: The Cable Guy crouches in a war-like position. He begins to circle Steven like a cat. Steven
text: mirrors him, not sure of what to do.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Just take it easy.
text: The Cable Guy runs at Steven, and swings his sword. In fear, Steven puts his shield over his head.
text: The sword smashes into it sending sparks into the air. The Cable Guy darts toward Steven and
text: pokes him several times with his sword. Each time Steven blocks it with either his sword or his
dialog: shield.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (enraged)
dialog: What are you doing?!
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: (matter of fact)
dialog: I'm trying to kill you.
text: The Cable Guy grabs a mace (a stick with a chain and ball attached to it) off of a weapon filled
text: wall and runs at Steven, swinging with abandon. Steven blocks the deadly mace with his shield.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Hey, watch it!
text: The Cable Guy leaps onto Steven. Then he speaks into his ear as he pushes him down onto the
dialog: ground.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: This is just like when Spock had to fight
dialog: Kirk on 'Star Trek.' Best friends forced
dialog: to do battle.
text: Steven gets angry and pushes the Cable Guy off of him. He swings at the Cable Guy with his
text: sword, just missing him. The Cable Guy rolls on the ground and pops back up in the air.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: That's the spirit. Let's give 'em a good
dialog: show.
text: Steven charges at the Cable Guy, swinging wildly. It is a real battle now. He bangs away at the
text: Cable Guy's mace until he knocks it out of his hands. The Cable Guy runs backwards, then falls on
dialog: the ground.
text: By the look in his eyes we can tell that the Cable Guy's feelings are hurt.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: So that's how it's gonna be, huh? All
dialog: right. If you want to play rought, Daddy
dialog: can play rough.
text: The Cable Guy charges at Steven with his shield. He upper cuts the shield to Steven's face,
text: sending him to the ground.
text: The Cable Guy runs to the wall and grabs a huge battle ax, a four foot long stick with a fancy
text: silver blade on the end of it. He swings it in circles like a Japanese master. Steven grabs a similar
text: weapon, and then begin to circle each other.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Chip, this isn't funny! Will you stop
dialog: it!
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: The name is Spock. If we don't battle to
dialog: the death, they'll kill us both. Good-bye
dialog: Jim.
text: He swings his sword, and they battle 'Star Trek' style. The Cable Guy begins to sing the "Star Trek
text: Battle Music" as they fight.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: This isn't 'Star Trek!'
scene_heading: MUSIC UP: STAR TREK BATTLE MUSIC
text: They bang the handles of their battle axes together, jockeying for position. The Cable Guy pushes
text: Steven away from him, then takes a huge swing, but Steven leaps in the air over the blade. The
text: Cable Guy swings over his head, and Steven blocks it with his ax handle. They continue to swing
text: and roll in a vicious battle.
text: Then the Cable Guy takes a swing which Steven is unable to block. The battle ax cuts through part
dialog: of Steven's protection.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (looking down)
dialog: Jesus.
text: The Cable Guy runs to a horses' entrance. There is a long pause, and then we hear the sound of
text: pounding horse hooves. A moment later the Cable Guy rides out on a horse holding a jousting
dialog: stick.
text: The show's host runs up to Steven.
speaker_heading: HOST
dialog: Quickly, muster a top your steed.
text: (Steven doesn't move - the host drops character)
dialog: Get on the god damn horse! I don't think
dialog: he's kidding!
text: Left with no choice, Steven jumps on a horse and grabs a joust. The host smacks Steven's horse
text: sending it straight toward the charging Cable Guy.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Don't do this!
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Jim, we have no choice!
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Oh my god.
text: They run toward each other. A horrible game of chicken. Neither gives in. When they reach one
text: another Steven knocks the Cable Guy off his horse with his jousting stick.
text: The Cable Guy flies through the air, lands on his back. Steven rides to him. Jumps off his horse,
text: throws off his helmet.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: Are you okay?
text: The Cable Guy sits up and smile at him.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Well done good sir. You are the victor,
dialog: but we shall meet again.
text: The two serfs put Steven on a chair connected to two poles. They carry him to the center of the
text: arena in victory. The crowd cheers wildly. Steven feels the adrenaline rush. He holds up his arms
text: in triumph, and smiles.

speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: You've got a real warrior's instinct.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I've got to admit there's a real feeling
text: of power holding that jousting stick.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: If Robin saw you tonight, she would be

scene_heading: 36AA	INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Steven turns on the lights.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: What do you think?
text: Steven's entire stereo system and TV have been replaced with a sixty-five inch television, laser disc
text: player, karaoke machine and a brand new stereo system. All top of the line.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: I took the liberty of updating your in
dialog: home entertainment system. I got you the
dialog: big screen, plus THX quality sound that
dialog: would make George Lucas cream in his
dialog: pants.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You went in my house when I wasn't home?
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: How else was I supposed to get the stuff
dialog: in here? Magic?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: How much did this cost?
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Practically nothing. I have a connection.
dialog: Preferred customer. I hook him up, he
dialog: hooks me up.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Look, I can't accept this. I wouldn't
dialog: feel right.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Yes but you give me something so much
dialog: more valuable friendship.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: And you've given me friendship, so we're
dialog: even.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Really, don't take it personally, but
dialog: you've got to take it back.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: (sadly)
dialog: Well, my buddy with the pick-up truck
dialog: works all week. Is it all right if I
dialog: leave it here till Saturday?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (guilty)

speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Mm-hmm.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Staple gun?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Oh, right.

speaker_heading: STEVEN

speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: I knew I'd get you on the phone that way.

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY

dialog: You've got to come over.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: (listens for a beat)
dialog: I can't. I'm going to dinner with
dialog: someone.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Dinner? What, like a date?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Not really a date.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You've got a date?! I thought things
dialog: were going well between us.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: They are.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: So why are you going out on a date?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I made it before we got together the
dialog: other night. I knew you would freak out.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I'm not freaking out.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Yes, you are freaking out.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I'm not. I just can't believe you would
dialog: do this.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm allowed
dialog: to date. It's not like we're back
dialog: together. We had a good time the other
dialog: night, and you're already pressuring me.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (pissy)
dialog: Fine, enjoy yourself. Have fun.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I will.

dialog: should too.

dialog: Damn right I'm right.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Oh, I got you a little something.
text: He hands a box to the Cable Guy.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: I thought you said we were even. You're
dialog: breaking the rules.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: So shoot me.
text: He opens it. The box says, "Lose Your Lisp in Thirty Days." The Cable Guy is so moved he

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: My brother said it might help with your

text: The Cable Guy looks Steven in the eye for a long beat, then hugs him hard.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Words cannot express
text: (he is too moved to finish his sentence)
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: It's no big deal.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Yes it is.

text: Whoa, chick alert at three o'clock. A
dialog: real barn burner. Don't look.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You're playing with me again.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: No sirree Steven. This woman is all over
dialog: you like a lamp-shade.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Shut up.
text: He turns and sees a stunning woman standing in the middle of a group of male and female misfits.
text: When he looks at her, she smiles. He quickly turns back.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Did it just get hotter in here?
dialog: (grabs his crotch)
dialog: Oh, that hurts.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Who'd she come with?
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: I don't know, but she looks pretty
dialog: available to me. I'd strike while the

dialog: masturbates, know what I'm saying?
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: A nerdy, balding man walks over to Rick.
speaker_heading: ODD MAN

speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Where do you know him from?
speaker_heading: ODD MAN

speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I don't know what your story is "Chip

speaker_heading: OFF DUTY COP

speaker_heading: CABLE GUY

speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Okay, just to stop that guy from begging.
dialog: This number is dedicated to all of the

speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: (rapping)
dialog: (Lyrics to "Bust A Move.")
text: During the musical break the Cable Guy begins to break dance. He knows all the moves. The

scene_heading: ANGLE ON STEVEN AND HEATHER
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You sounded just like Olivia Newton John.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I've been practicing for years.
speaker_heading: STEVEN

speaker_heading: CABLE GUY

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: What do you mean it was "your treat?"
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (getting concerned)
dialog: Buy what?
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: You know, the women.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You mean Heather is a prostitute?
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Of course she is. Do you think a woman
dialog: like that would hang out with us if we
dialog: weren't paying? Don't tell me you didn't
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I can't believe this.
text: He sits in a chair, and leans over in pain.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: She's clean I assure you. I tried her out
dialog: last week to make sure she was top
dialog: quality, and I'm as healthy as a horse. Not
dialog: a drip. She's the best, ask any of my
dialog: friends.
text: Steven cringes.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You've got to be kidding? Please tell me
dialog: she's a friend of yours. You're just
dialog: playing with my mind again, right?
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: I wish I had friends like that.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Get out of my house!
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Don't be ashamed of yourself. I know she
dialog: was a working girl, but she kind of liked
dialog: you. You might have been able to
dialog: get a freebie.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Out, now! I don't ever want to see you
dialog: again.
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Robin is never going to forgive me.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: I'll tell you how to handle that. Don't
dialog: tell her. You want to get her back, I'll
dialog: help you get her back.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I don't want your help. I want you to
dialog: leave.

speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: BlockSki? That sounds right.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: So, Gail told me you're just coming off a

speaker_heading: ROBIN

speaker_heading: RAY

speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: My pleasure.
text: The man puts out his hand to take the paper towel, but the Cable Guy doesn't hand it to him, he
text: grabs the man's hands and surrounds them with several paper towels, and begins drying them
text: furiously. When he's done, he takes a beat and wipes them over and over, just to make sure they're
text: dry. The man is aghast.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Enjoy your meal
text: The man exits. Ray walks toward the stalls.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Good evening sir. Pleasant night, isn't
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (curt)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY

speaker_heading: CABLE GUY (OS)
dialog: If you need anything, just let me know.
dialog: Anything at all.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (getting annoyed)
dialog: I think I can handle it.
text: Ray unzips his fly, and prepares to pee standing up. Suddenly, as if out of thin air, the Cable Guy
text: is standing right behind him. He speaks into Ray's ear, startling him.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: I'm here to serve you.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Jesus! Get out of here!
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Most people never bother to take
dialog: advantage of all my services, for
dialog: instance 
text: The Cable Guy grabs the back of Ray's shirt, kicks his feet out from under him, and slams his face
text: into the toilet bowl, sloshing it around. Ray struggles, but the Cable Guy is too strong.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: I can help you wash up. Cleanliness is
dialog: so very important.
text: He pulls his face out.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Then once you're done I have a variety of
dialog: skin care products which can make you
dialog: look years younger.
text: The Cable Guy kicks the door open, and pulls Ray toward the counter. He grabs a bottle of lotion.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: This lotion is superb at removing liver
dialog: spots.
text: He slaps it onto Ray's face.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: This one is an excellent moisturizer.
text: The Cable Guy pours some after cologne into his hands, and rubs his hands together as if he's
text: about to put it on Ray's face.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: And one can never underestimate the
dialog: effects of a good cologne.
text: The Cable Guy rears back and slaps Ray across the face.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: (sniffs)
dialog: Mm High Karate. And now a touch of
dialog: powder.
text: He takes a large powder puff, and smashes it into Ray's face temporarily blinding him.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: (grabs a tweezer)
dialog: Ooh, I almost forget, it's oh so very
dialog: important to be properly tweezed.
text: The Cable Guy plucks several hairs out from between Ray's eyebrows.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: You're on a big date, you'll need fresh
dialog: breath.
text: He takes a clear jar of combs, and pours the blue fluid and the combs into Ray's mouth.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Whoops, that's not mouth wash. But that
dialog: reminds me. Proper hair care is a must.
text: The Cable Guy combs his soaking wet hair into a very goofy looking side part.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Looking good, now let's dry you off.
text: He runs Ray face first into the starting button of an automatic hand dryer. It turns on. The Cable
text: Guy puts his face right up next to the air.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Now suck it. Suck the air!
text: Ray hesitantly puts his mouth around the nozzle, and his cheeks start fluttering like an astronaut
text: experiencing heavy G-Force.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: from this angle you look just like Neil
dialog: Armstrong experiencing G-Force. I
dialog: believe you have the "right stuff."
text: The Cable Guy pulls him away, and smashes his face into the tip basket.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Don't worry about the tip. But I've got

dialog: He's a good man. He mentioned that you

speaker_heading: ROBIN

speaker_heading: CABLE GUY

speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Well, you were right. Something's
dialog: happening with him and he won't even
dialog: acknowledge it.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: If he refuses to admit he has a problem,
dialog: we may have to let him hit bottom. He's
dialog: gonna need some tough love.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: (tentatively)
dialog: You know his lawyer said that nobody
dialog: named Ernie Douglas works for the Cable
dialog: Company.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: (chuckles)
dialog: Did he do a name search? 'Cause I work
dialog: under a pseudonym so the customers won't

dialog: Tate.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: And he's saying he received all the
dialog: stereo equipment from you.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: (I know, and I'm not mad. He's been
dialog: cornered, so he's telling some wives
dialog: tales. He doesn't mean to hurt me.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I just feel like I triggered this with
dialog: him. It's not that I don't want to get
dialog: married, it's just I felt like he wanted
dialog: to get married just to get married. I
dialog: don't deal well with pressure.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Hey, welcome to the human race. We're
dialog: not perfect. We all think we have to
dialog: look like a 'Baywatch' babe and be as

speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Steven, what's with you tonight? I'm

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Maybe it's because I just got out of

scene_heading: STEVEN'S MOTHER
dialog: (to the Cable Guy)
dialog: Thank you again for that.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We owe you an apology. I didn't realize
dialog: the seriousness of your problems. You're
text: obviously going through some kind of
dialog: personal hell and I need to be more
dialog: understanding. We didn't get involved
dialog: with things like that when I was your

text: Steven cannot figure out what kind of lie the Cable Guy has told them.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: I know we haven't been there for you

scene_heading: STEVEN'S MOTHER

scene_heading: ON THE CABLE GUY
text: As he talks we realize he has not been in slow motion, he's just been pretending he's in slow

speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: It's from "Goodfellas." Remember the
dialog: intro scene at the bar. I'm Johnny Two
dialog: Times.
text: He moves in slow motion some more. Everyone laughs.
text: TONY, Steven's six year old nephew, runs to the Cable Guy with a toy gun.
speaker_heading: TONY/CABLE GUY
dialog: Pow, pow, pow. You're under arrest.
text: Everyone laughs. The Cable Guy starts running around the table. Tony makes chase, laughing all
dialog: the way.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: You'll never catch me copper.
text: The Cable Guy stops, grabs a piece of asparagus and puts it between his lip and nose, and pretends
text: it's a moustache.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: I'm gonna wear a disguise.
text: Steven looks at the Cable Guy and remembers something.
text: STEVEN'S P.O.V. - He sees the Cable Guy. The artist's rendering of the man who beat up Robin's

text: he's been shot.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Oh, you got me.
text: The Cable Guy plays dead. The kid walks over to him. When he gets close, the Cable Guy lunges

speaker_heading: CABLE GUY

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You stay away from Robin.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY

speaker_heading: CABLE GUY

speaker_heading: ROBIN

speaker_heading: STEVEN

speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: But you took the credit for it?
speaker_heading: STEVEN

dialog: They're professionals. And I didn't even

speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: So that makes it better?
speaker_heading: STEVEN

speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: He didn't have sex with a whore. You
dialog: did.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Robin you don't --
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I don't want to hear it. Breaking up was
dialog: the best thing we ever did. You have

text: The prosecutor's words turn into gibberish as Steven's eyes go heavy and he falls asleep.
text: 99	ON STEVEN - HE IS ASLEEP	HE SLOWLY WAKES UP.
text: The gibberish turns into clearly spoken words, only this time the voice sounds more familiar.
text: ON THE TV - We see the Sam Sweet trial. A prosecutor makes a passionate final summation. We
text: reveal that it is the Cable Guy.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: This man killed his own brother. Some

text: Steven slams the door. Then looks through the peep hole.
scene_heading: 101	P.O.V. THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE
text: The Cable Guy begins to run full speed at the door. As he does he gets bigger and bigger, and

scene_heading: 102	INT. STEVEN'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Steven runs away from the front door. The door smashes open, and the Cable Guy runs after him.
text: Steven runs away down the hallway. The hallway appears to be a mile long. He tries to run fast
text: but appears to move in almost slow motion. Every time he looks over his shoulder he sees the
text: Cable Guy running at an alarmingly fast rate of speed toward him, grunting like a wolf. He looks
text: back another time and the Cable Guy is gone.
text: He keeps running, and the hallway starts getting smaller and smaller, till he can barely fit through.
text: He becomes trapped at the end of the hall. Arms come out of the window behind him and grab
text: him. Fifty Cable Guy faces pop out of the wall on both sides.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY

speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Steven, you're just like me. We're cut

speaker_heading: STEVEN

dialog: (Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: I'm close. So very close.
text: The camera rotates and reveals that the Cable Guy is actually lying down. Then the camera rises
text: up and reveals that the Cable Guy is lying in the floorboards right underneath Steven. A single
text: beam of light shines across his face. As he speaks a large daddy long legs spider crawls across his
text: face. He never acknowledges it.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: You know, I don't think you're right for
dialog: Robin. She needs someone who can be
dialog: sensitive to her needs. Someone who
dialog: understands her soul.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You stay away from her.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Aren't we the control freak. Looks like
dialog: you're starting to sweat.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I got the camera. You can't see me.
text: Steven begins to pick his face.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Oh yeah? Then why are you picking your
dialog: face?
text: Steven throws the phone. When it lands we see the speaker phone light is on. He begins looking
text: for the camera. He smashes his TV.
text: JUMP CUTS - Steven tearing through everything in his apartment.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: You're getting closer.
text: Steven overturns a CD rack.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Pity, such a nice CD rack. You know
dialog: sometimes the answer is right under your
dialog: nose.
text: Steven lloks at the floorboards, then runs out of the room, and returns a moment later with an ax.
text: He starts chopping at the floorboards, tearing the out.
text: He looks down into the hole, he sees nothing. Then a hand grabs him by the shirt and pulls his face
text: into the space in the floor. The Cable Guy's face appears in front of him, screaming like a mad
text: man. He licks Steven's face quickly, then disappears back into the hole. Steven falls back. He hears
text: the Cable Guy scuttle away.
text: Steven sticks his head back down into the hole only to see the dust in the floorboards swirl in the
text: aftermath of the Cable Guy's exit. He hears the Cable Guy crawling through the walls above him,
text: then through the side walls, and away into the distance. When it clears he discovers a small
text: makeshift observation room has been set up in the crawlspace.
text: There are a few photos pasted to the floorboards. One shows the Cable Guy as a child standing
text: next to his mother. Steven's picture has been pasted into those photos making him look like the
text: Cable Guy's brother. The only other photo is of Jerry Springer. Steven sees a small television
text: monitor and a set of headphones from which the Cable Guy has been watching him. He looks at a

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Hey Rick. I'm really excited to hear
dialog: what you found out about this nut.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I hit the Holy Grail. This guy is deeply
text: troubled. Only child. His mother was
dialog: arrested for prostitution, and phone
dialog: solicitation. Apparently she was some
dialog: phone sex pioneer.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: And get this, he was discharged from the
dialog: Marines. He got mad at his Sergeant so
dialog: he sent a weapons silo to Defcon Two
dialog: using a Radio Shack computer. And that's
dialog: not the half of it.
text: As Rick gets closer Steven steps forward out of the shadows, and we reveal that it is not Steven,
text: but the Cable Guy, dressed like Steven, doing a perfect impression (actually the real voice of
text: Steven looped into the Cable Guy's mouth - with a very slight lisp).
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Really? Tell me more.
text: Rick's face turns white. He stumbles backwards, trying to get away.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: I'm very interested in learning
dialog: everything I can about that wacked out
dialog: cable installer.
text: He turns and runs. He is fifteen feet away from the Cable Guy.
text: The camera pushes in on the Cable Guy. He pulls out a staple gun, and fires. We hear but do not

speaker_heading: STEVEN

speaker_heading: CABLE GUY

speaker_heading: ROBIN

text: He pushes him under the water again. After a moment he pulls him back up. Steven gasps for air.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: Who would have thunk it?
text: Enraged, Steven punches him in the mouth with such tremendous force that it appears to have

speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: (without any lisp)
dialog: You're gonna have to do better than that
dialog: Steven.

speaker_heading: ROBIN

scene_heading: 124	EXT. SATELLITE DISH - LATER

text: WIRE and begins tightrope walking toward her. He walks very slowly, almost losing his balance
dialog: several times.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Hang on.
text: CLOSE ON: The opposite wire. The Cable Guy's muddy hands slam onto it. He pulls himself up.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: (laughs maniacally)
dialog: I know what your saying. Who does this
dialog: guy think he is, Jason?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Stay away from her!
text: Suddenly, the Cable Guy does a front flip, and lands perfectly on the wire.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: I saw that in Trapeze, starring Tony
dialog: Curtis. He was just on "Life-styles of
dialog: the Rich and Famous." He still looks
dialog: terrific.
text: Steven is about ten feet from the dangling Robin, but the reverberation from the Cable Guy's

dialog: there.
text: The Cable Guy sees this, and begins to run incredibly fast toward Robin.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: And the race is on.
text: He does a cartwheel on the strut, hops on one leg, then takes off toward her, running at full speed.
text: Steven, left with no other option, simply bounces up and down on the wire. Robin sees this and
text: joins him.
text: The Cable Guy begins to lose his balance.
speaker_heading: CABLE GUY
dialog: (knows he's about to fall)
dialog: This is such an anti-climactic way to end
dialog: this.
