text: A THREAD of COTTON noses it’s way through the eye of the
dialog: needle.
text: FANNY BRAWNE aged 18 is SEWING by FIRST LIGHT while her 9-
text: year old sister MARGARET sleeps. Her stitches are confident,
text: intricate and fast. The WHITE MUSLIN she is sewing is
text: delicate and fine. The glint of the STEEL NEEDLE as it
text: weaves then pulls, weaves then pulls a trail of perfect
dialog: stitches.
scene_heading: INT. THE KITCHEN ELM COTTAGE - MORNING 3
text: MRS BRAWNE 40 enters the KITCHEN dressed to go out. Fanny,

text: 14-year old brother, sits apart munching toast.
speaker_heading: MRS BRAWNE
dialog: Have you forgot we are going to Mr and Mrs
dialog: Dilke for tea? We are to meet Mr Brown’s poet
dialog: friend Mr Keats.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: No I have not forgot. Can you help Margaret,
text: the stitches must be small and exactly even.
text: Mrs Brawne takes over from her youngest daughter.
speaker_heading: FANNY (cont’d)
dialog: What if Mr Brown has already poisoned Mr Keats
dialog: against me? I shall not be afraid to take
dialog: them on in wit. If I am in the mood I could
dialog: lash them both.
speaker_heading: MRS BRAWNE
dialog: Why not ignore Mr Brown?
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: He provokes me! Mama it is his game. I must
dialog: defend myself.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM ELM COTTAGE - MORNING 4
text: Fanny finishes some intricate hair arrangement, with the help
text: of little Margaret, who passes the pins to her mother who is
dialog: securing them.
scene_heading: BLUE PAGES 04/04/08 2.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN ELM COTTAGE - MORNING 5

text: Fanny, a vision in white, walks elegantly between her family
text: out onto Hampstead Heath, past the WASHER WOMEN and a maze of
text: WASHING LINES.
scene_heading: EXT. HAMPSTEAD HEATH FIELD - DAY 7
text: Fanny and her family walk down the Heath between CLOTHES
text: spread out on BUSHES with a distant London beyond. They pass
text: a FAMILY evicted from their house with their possessions,
text: BED, WARDROBE and TABLE for sale. The air is SMOKE FILLED
text: from the burning of AUTUMN LEAVES.
scene_heading: EXT/INT. WENTWORTH HOUSE - DAY 8
text: The Brawne family group turn into the gate of WENTWORTH
text: HOUSE. Fanny dauntless, her head high, her cheeks pink and
dialog: ready for battle.
text: MARIA DILKE greets them at the door, adoring Fanny’s new
text: dress and it’s petal embroidery. Fanny greets everyone
text: warmly, MR DILKE and little CHARLES their son. MR BROWN
text: joins the group. Fanny frowns and looks away.
speaker_heading: MR BROWN
dialog: Ah, the very well stitched little Miss Brawne
dialog: in all her detail.
speaker_heading: MRS BRAWNE (TO MARIA DILKE)
dialog: Where is Mr Keats?
speaker_heading: MARIA DILKE
dialog: I'm afraid he is not joining us. He is next
text: door in Mr Brown’s half of the house.
text: Mr Brown puts out his hand to Fanny who moves past, ignoring
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: MR BROWN
dialog: What is this? What have I done? How have I
dialog: offended?
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: I don’t shake hands with an enemy.
speaker_heading: MR BROWN
dialog: An enemy? What have I done to you?
scene_heading: BLUE PAGES 04/04/08 3.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: You do nothing to me, or for me and that is
dialog: how I prefer to keep it.
text: Mr Brown holds up his arms in mock wonder, enjoying teasing
text: Fanny as he might a lap dog.
speaker_heading: MR BROWN
dialog: What!?
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: All right, your offence is to my fashion to
dialog: which I am “so helpless slavish!”
speaker_heading: MR BROWN
dialog: I didn’t say that, Mrs Dilke? I never would
dialog: say such nonsense. I have been ill quoted.
text: The gathering moves into the DRAWING ROOM where tea is
text: served. Maria is bowing her head guiltily.
speaker_heading: MR DILKE (TO MR BROWN)
dialog: Baiting...baiting...
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: ...“her obsession with flounce and cross
dialog: stitch?”
speaker_heading: MR BROWN
dialog: Cross stitch? Miss Brawne I don’t even know
dialog: what it means, I have been wrongly used.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: I feel the same about your poems Mr Brown, I
dialog: know nothing of what they mean. In fact, they
dialog: have the quality of your cigar, they puff,
text: smoke and dissolve leaving nothing but
dialog: irritation...
speaker_heading: MRS BRAWNE
dialog: Fanny why not talk to one of us you hold in
dialog: higher favour?
speaker_heading: FANNY
text: Mr Brown sets out to irritate and he is
dialog: successful, now I set out to demolish and I am
dialog: only begun.
speaker_heading: MR BROWN
dialog: Ohhh...
speaker_heading: MARIA DILKE
dialog: Fanny take this tea to poor Mr Keats, he is in
dialog: very poor spirits.
speaker_heading: FANNY (LOOKING CONCERNED)
dialog: Oh. Will he have sugar?
scene_heading: BLUE PAGES 04/04/08 4.
speaker_heading: MR BROWN
dialog: He is composing and does not want disturbing.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: It is my finding in the business of disturbing
dialog: you are the expert.
speaker_heading: MRS BRAWNE
dialog: Fanny that is too far.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: I am praising him!
speaker_heading: MRS BRAWNE
dialog: Fanny...
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: What now I am restrained because I compliment
dialog: him too much? I withdraw. Let someone else
dialog: take Mr Keats’s tea, I want to be left alone
dialog: to examine the length of my stitches.
speaker_heading: MARIA DILKE (POURING KEATS'S TEA)
dialog: Please Fanny I want you to go, I am wanting to
dialog: know what you shall say about Mr Keats. I
dialog: have been waiting two weeks that I may enjoy
dialog: your opinion. I cannot look upon him without
text: smiling and he is quick with his thoughts
text: though now they are mostly sad.
speaker_heading: MR DILKE
dialog: His brother Tom is not at all better, very
dialog: diminished.
text: Fanny’s sympathy is engaged.
speaker_heading: MARIA DILKE
text: Mr Keats nurses him alone. It is difficult
dialog: work.
speaker_heading: MRS BRAWNE
dialog: Are there no other family members?
speaker_heading: MARIA DILKE
text: No. The parents are both dead. There is only
text: a much younger sister and a brother who
dialog: emigrated to America.
speaker_heading: MRS BRAWNE
dialog: How old is Tom?
speaker_heading: MR DILKE
dialog: Only 19, very painful and Keats is not much
dialog: older.
speaker_heading: MRS BRAWNE
dialog: I am so sorry.
scene_heading: BLUE PAGES 04/04/08 5.
scene_heading: INT. MR BROWN’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON 9
text: Fanny stops mid corridor to check her hair and self in the
dialog: hall glass.
text: She is possessed, neither pleased or displeased with her
text: appearance and dispassionate in her attention.
text: Outside Mr Brown’s DOOR Fanny stops to knock and then to turn
text: the handle but KEATS surprises her by pulling the door
text: suddenly open (expecting Mr Brown).
text: Keats and Fanny are eye to eye, each other’s petite equal.
text: They laugh. The tea sloshes.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: You like jokes Mr Keats? I like jokes. I hope
dialog: we shall play some on each other. Mr Brown I
dialog: warn you, does not like my jokes, he complains
dialog: I care for nothing but fashion. Should you
dialog: like cake?
text: Fanny turns to leave.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: And what shall be said of me? You have come
dialog: to spy.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: I came to bring you tea.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: How will you describe me? My character?
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: I am not the least interested in your
dialog: character.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: My jacket then or my pantaloon?
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: You need a new jacket that is what I would
dialog: say.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: That is all?
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: That it should be of velvet.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: Tell me Miss Brawne, how are you so sure?
scene_heading: BLUE PAGES 04/04/08 5A.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: All that I wear I have designed and sewn
dialog: myself. Is it not well done?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 10
dialog: 11
scene_heading: BLUE PAGES 04/04/08 6.
speaker_heading: FANNY (cont'd)
dialog: I am often told I am clever to exception about
dialog: design, I have originated the pleated edge
text: upon the ribbon. It is charming and it has
dialog: been copied...
text: Mr Brown enters the room and sits at his spot at the WRITING
text: DESK opposite Keats, pushing his chair back to look at Fanny.
speaker_heading: MR BROWN
dialog: Has she annoyed you sufficiently? She has
dialog: done brilliant well with me. Men's room,
dialog: men's room, OUT, thank you. Poets writing.
text: Mr Brown picks up his PEN and acts writing. Fanny leaves
text: calmly as if Mr Brown was not scuttling her.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: Goodbye minxstress.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: My stitching has more merit and admirers than
dialog: your two scribbling’s put together.
speaker_heading: KEATS AND MR BROWN
dialog: Ohhhh. Ohhhh.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: And I can make money from it.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: Ouch!
scene_heading: EXT. STREET HAMPSTEAD HEATH - DAY 10
text: Margaret and Samuel make their way to the BOOKSHOP, careful
text: not to catch the eye of the HUNGRY and HOMELESS.
scene_heading: INT. BOOKSHOP - DAY 11
text: The BELL on the BOOKSHOP DOOR rings. Margaret and Samuel
text: enter. Their boots clunk on the boards of the quiet shop,
text: they walk to the counter. There is no-one there, they stand
text: in front of it. A VOICE speaks from a shelf behind.
speaker_heading: SHOPKEEPER
dialog: Yes?
text: Samuel moves to the counter.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: Have you got John Keats’s poem book Endy...
speaker_heading: SHOPKEEPER
dialog: Endymion? I’ve not heard much good about it.
dialog: I’ve not sold one and took twenty.
dialog: 12
dialog: 13
scene_heading: BLUE PAGES 04/04/08 7.
text: The SHOPKEEPER takes a copy from a tallish pile.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: My sister has met the author. She wants to
dialog: read it for herself and decide if he is an
dialog: idiot or not.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM ELM COTTAGE - DAY 12
text: Fanny at home in her room sews the tiny pleats of a TRIPLE
text: MUSHROOM PLEATED COLLAR. Her needle weaving in and out, then
text: drawing the thread through. Her eyelashes caught in the PALE
text: WHITE SUN. Standing in her PETTICOAT, she holds the almost
text: complete collar to her neck and checks it’s effect in the
text: glass. She gently tilts her head to the side and points her
dialog: toe.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM ELM COTTAGE - DAY 13
text: Margaret and Samuel come upstairs and enter Fanny’s bedroom.
text: Margaret takes off her COAT and sits. Fanny's steel needle
dialog: pauses.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Unwrap it.
text: Margaret takes the BROWN PAPER from the book. Fanny watches.
text: She takes the book in her own hands, turns it over, opens it
text: to the title page. Then passes it back to Margaret.
speaker_heading: FANNY (cont’d)
dialog: Read it.
text: Her needle weaves in and out of the pleats, drawing it’s pale
text: thread behind it.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
speaker_heading: ENDYMION
speaker_heading: BOOK 1
dialog: “A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:
dialog: Its loveliness increases; it will never
dialog: Pass into nothingness; but still will keep
text: A bower quiet for us, and a sleep
dialog: Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet
dialog: breathing.
dialog: Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing
dialog: A flowery band to bind us to the earth”
text: Fanny’s eyes stop and go deeply inside, she is listening.
text: Her needle again weaves in and out of the fine pleat. She is
dialog: sewing faster.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
text: “Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth”
dialog: 14
scene_heading: BLUE PAGES 04/04/08 8.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Stop.
text: Margaret stops and looks to Fanny. Fanny stops sewing.
speaker_heading: FANNY (cont’d)
dialog: I am completely lost...
text: Fanny takes the book from Margaret.
speaker_heading: FANNY (cont’d)
dialog: “...yes, in spite of all,
text: Some shape of beauty moves away the pall
dialog: From our dark spirits.”
scene_heading: INT. THE ROYAL ARTILLERY MESS - EVENING 14
text: The ROYAL ARTILLERY MESS at WOOLWICH, a DANCE and Fanny in
text: the centre of it in her new gown. She dances with a studied
text: grace. The effect is elegant yet mannered.
text: In the interval she sights an under dressed Keats sitting
text: back, ignoring the dancers absorbed in his thoughts. Near
text: him Mr Brown and their friend REYNOLDS and his SISTERS talk
text: loudly. Fanny whispers to her younger brother Samuel.
text: Samuel slouches over to Keats.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: My sister Miss Brawne wishes to greet you Mr
dialog: Keats.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: And where is she?
text: Fanny is all alone waiting for him strategically posed by a
text: large ORNATE MIRROR near the dining hall.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: “A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:
dialog: Its loveliness increases; it will never
dialog: Pass into nothingness;”
text: Keats looks surprised.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: You have read Endymion?
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: I wanted to adore it.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: But you hate it?
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: I cannot say.
scene_heading: BLUE PAGES 04/04/08 9.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: Are you afraid to speak truthfully?
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Never.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: Well tell me then.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: No. I am not at all clever with poetry.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: Neither it seems am I. Still I have hope for
dialog: myself. What do you make of my hope Miss
dialog: Brawne?
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: I think hope very useful.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: But...
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: But hope and results are very different. One
dialog: does not create the other.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: Could practice help?
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Yes it might. I was not always able to stitch
dialog: so well.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: Ah ha, I must practice my stitches.
text: Fanny looks at Keats.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Let me do the sewing, I have such a start.
dialog: This is the first frock in Woolwich or
dialog: Hampstead to have a_ triple-pleated-mushroom
dialog: collar.
text: Keats looks about to realise there is only Fanny, himself and
dialog: their reflection.
speaker_heading: KEATS (INTIMATELY )
dialog: Behind you I see one I fear to be identical.
text: Fanny disconcerted, turns to see her own reflection, she
text: laughs very pleased with the joke.
text: She sees a GROUP of MILITARY MEN, dance partners searching
text: for her. She puts her back to them so she may finish
dialog: talking.
dialog: 15
scene_heading: BLUE PAGES 04/04/08 10.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: My card is completely full; three I have met
text: before and are suitors. Mr Tarrant is scaring
dialog: me with his talk of estates and his dogs, he
dialog: has eleven. Maman says it is possible to love
dialog: almost anybody and I will come to understand
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: KEATS (GESTURES )
dialog: Even Mr---?
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Tarrant? Yes, isn’t that a miracle? But you
dialog: don’t dance Mr Keats. I love to dance.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: I don’t feel like dancing..
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Your brother is still ill?
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: He is no better.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: I have thought of him often and wish to make
dialog: him something. Would lemon wafers be
dialog: agreeable?
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: He would like so much that you had thought of
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: My Papa was ill for as long as I can remember.
dialog: He died when I was still a child.
text: Fanny tears up. She takes out a small WHITE EMBROIDERED
text: HANDKERCHIEF and pats her eyes.
text: The TWO MILITARY MEN spot Fanny and come over.
text: Keats bows and departs while Fanny is led out on to the dance
text: floor. She has recovered herself and is dancing with
text: quaintly exaggerated hand movements aimed at affecting a
text: personal stylishness. The Reynolds sisters notice and
text: comically impersonate. Apparently for Keats’s benefit. He
text: is not amused by them or by Fanny but is alone and alienated
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN ELM COTTAGE - DAY 15
text: On the kitchen table Fanny and the maid are grating LEMON
text: RIND. Dabbing WAFER MIX onto an OVEN TRAY. Stoking the
text: FIRE. From the cooked wafers Fanny tosses all but the most
text: perfect onto a rubbish heap. She lines a BASKET with LINEN.
text: Then pausing, she turns from the table.
dialog: 16
dialog: 17
scene_heading: BLUE PAGES 04/04/08 11.
text: Quickly she swoops on Margaret’s frock where she snips a
text: LEMON RIBBON off her neckline and begins to tie it
text: decoratively on the basket.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Mother! Fanny has taken my ribbon and she
dialog: never asked. Mama!
text: Margaret goes in search of her mother who she finds in the
dialog: hall way.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: She has cut my ribbon.
text: Mrs Brawne enters the kitchen to see a mess of SHATTERED and
text: DISCARDED wafers and Fanny tying the ribbon on her basket of
text: 20 PERFECT wafers.
speaker_heading: MRS BRAWNE
dialog: What are you doing Fanny?
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: I am trying to bring some comfort to a dying
dialog: man.
text: Mrs Brawne picks up one of the discarded wafers from a huge
dialog: stack.
speaker_heading: MRS BRAWNE
dialog: What dying man? Where are you taking them?
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: I cannot offer poor Mr Keats’s brother
dialog: anything that is not perfect.
speaker_heading: MRS BRAWNE
dialog: But so many of them look quite well.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Mama, quite well! He may die. I cannot offer
dialog: him anything but our most beautiful and our
dialog: best.
scene_heading: EXT. WENTWORTH HOUSE - DAY 16
text: Fanny carries the BASKET of wafers as the THREE young
text: Brawne’s walk up the path to Wentworth House.
scene_heading: INT. WENTWORTH HOUSE - DAY 17
text: Inside the house they walk down the corridor to Mr Brown’s
text: apartment. Fanny knocks.
speaker_heading: MR BROWN
dialog: No thank you, poets at work.
scene_heading: BLUE PAGES 04/04/08 12.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: It is me, Miss Brawne. I have something to
dialog: deliver to Mr Keats.
speaker_heading: MR BROWN
dialog: Leave it at the door.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Is Mr Keats not there?
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: I am here.
speaker_heading: MR BROWN
dialog: We are working Miss Brawne.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: I have something for Mr Keats's brother.
text: Heavy footsteps. Mr Brown opens the door. Fanny holds out a
text: basket with a LACE NAPKIN laid over the top. Mr Brown whips
text: off the LACE COVER and pinches a wafer.
speaker_heading: MR BROWN
dialog: Mmmm. ..delicious...
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: You vile, disgusting, ape!
text: A sad Keats turns his head towards Fanny at the door and
text: watches listlessly.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: Invite Miss Brawne inside. Let them all come
dialog: in.
text: Mr Brown stands aside, gobbling his wafer.
speaker_heading: MR BROWN
dialog: Be careful you enter the apes cage, (mimicking
dialog: a monkey) Hoo, hoo, hoo.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: You are invisible to me, you idiot, you...
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: Come and sit here, next to me Miss Brawne. My
text: prospects in the world feel very faint.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: This room is so poorly cared for. It is half
dialog: night in here for want of pulling your drapes
dialog: back.
text: She passes over the wafers.
dialog: 18
scene_heading: BLUE PAGES 04/04/08 13.
speaker_heading: FANNY (cont’d)
dialog: Please try one. I am anxious they will cause
dialog: him to choke.
text: Keats takes one. Mr Brown puts his hand into the basket
text: Fanny whips it away.
speaker_heading: FANNY (cont’d)
dialog: No! They are baked for someone very ill. Try
dialog: another and I swear I shall bite you.
speaker_heading: MR BROWN
dialog: Ohhh, I’m very scared.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: Take care, she has sharp teeth. She has sunk
dialog: her fangs into my poor poem and shook it
dialog: apart.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: I am very sorry I could not love your Endymion
dialog: completely Mr Keats. Perhaps I did not say
dialog: but I thought the beginning of your poem
dialog: something very perfect.
text: Fanny turns to go.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: No, don’t leave us. You can see for yourself,
dialog: nothing is happening. All day we lie about
dialog: the room begging for inspiration. Tell me
dialog: what I must do.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: There is something sordid and menacing that I
dialog: don’t at all enjoy in the atmosphere. I am in
dialog: a hurry to get myself away. I feel I am
text: inside a cage with two monkeys.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: We monkeys just want a little company.
text: Mr Brown steals another wafer. Fanny spins away.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: How dare you!
scene_heading: EXT. HAMPSTEAD HEATH - DAY 18
text: Fanny, Margaret and Samuel walk back fast through the Heath.
text: A great GUST of WIND sends the AUTUMN LEAVES spiralling
text: upwards. Keats, flush faced is jogging after them but
text: somewhat behind them. He has Fanny’s basket in his hand.
scene_heading: BLUE PAGES 04/04/08 13A.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: If we've finished tiffing, come and say
dialog: “hello” to Tom, it might cheer him.
scene_heading: BLUE PAGES 04/04/08 14.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: We will have to ask Mama.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: No we don’t Toots.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yes we do, isn’t that so Samuel? We have to
dialog: stay together.
text: Samuel shrugs. Fanny walks off.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Well then, I am going and you will have to
dialog: come with me.
text: Keats stands at the junction of many tracks.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: Should you like to go by the pond or through
dialog: the wood? I have explored all these paths
dialog: which are more in number than your eyelashes.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: My eyelashes?
text: Fanny bats her eyelashes and laughs. She walks beside Keats.
speaker_heading: FANNY (cont’d)
dialog: It amazes me that you can sit opposite Mr
dialog: Brown all day. I have never heard him say one
dialog: thing of wit. Not one!
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: You favour wit?
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: I rate it the highest.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: You like the fashionables?
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Yes, I do.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: Men who say things that make you start without
dialog: making you feel?
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: No, things that are amusing.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: I know these dandy’s, they have a mannerism in
dialog: their very eating and drinking, in their
text: handling of a decanter.
dialog: 19
dialog: 20
scene_heading: BLUE PAGES 04/04/08 15.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: You are making an attack on me.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: No, I am defending Mr Brown’s generous good
dialog: heart.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: By attacking myself?
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: Forgive me. I have been too long at my
dialog: brother's sick bed.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Can we not still appreciate clever humour?
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: What witty thing can be said of a nineteen
dialog: year old drowning in his own blood?
text: Fanny suddenly realises the seriousness of Tom’s illness.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Nothing, nothing at all.
scene_heading: EXT. KEATS’S APARTMENT WELL WALK - DAY 19
text: The three Brawne’s led by Keats, arrive in the COURTYARD of

dialog: Excuse me.
scene_heading: INT. TOM’S ROOM WELL WALK - DAY 20
speaker_heading: He enters TOM’S ROOM
text: In the other room Fanny glimpses Keats holding his pale,
text: groaning brother who struggles to breathe. It looks grim,
dialog: hopeless.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I want to go. I want to leave. It smells.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Shush, or I’1l cut your hair in the night.
text: Keats comes back out looking pale and saddened.
speaker_heading: KEATS
text: He is feverish and cannot speak.
dialog: 21
dialog: 22
scene_heading: BLUE PAGES 04/04/08 16.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Should I call a nurse?
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: I trained for 5 years as a doctor, there is
dialog: nothing to be done.
text: Tears spring to Fanny’s eyes, she gives Keats the LEMON
speaker_heading: WAFERS.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: The wafers.
scene_heading: EXT. WENTWORTH HOUSE - EVENING 21
text: Wentworth House in the evening. Both sides of the house are

scene_heading: INT. HALL WENTWORTH HOUSE - EVENING 22
text: Inside Fanny and her family are removing their PELISSES and
text: OVERCOATS with the Dilke’s help when Keats arrives. There
dialog: are lots of “Good Evenings” and jollities.

speaker_heading: REYNOLDS SISTER 1
dialog: You have not seen it?
speaker_heading: MARIA DILKE
dialog: In this house we do not acknowledge it.
speaker_heading: FANNY

speaker_heading: MARIA DILKE
dialog: I can’t bring myself to remember...
scene_heading: BLUE PAGES 04/04/08 18.
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS SISTER 2
dialog: It has stuck in my mind. “...no man, whose

speaker_heading: REYNOLDS SISTER 1
dialog: Do you like poetry Miss Brawne?
speaker_heading: FANNY

dialog: “I have clung to nothing, loved a nothing,
dialog: nothing seen or felt but a great dream! OT
dialog: have been presumptuous against love against
dialog: the sky, Against all elements, against the tie
dialog: of mortals each to each.”
dialog: The rhythm is beautiful and unique. There are
text: rhymes but not on the beat, they are quiet but
dialog: binding and the repetitions set you up to fly.
dialog: “I have clung to nothing, loved a nothing,
dialog: nothing seen.”
dialog: 
text: Reynolds indicates the expanse of flight.
speaker_heading: JOHN REYNOLDS (cont'd)
dialog: Here you come out

text: Fanny’s needle is thread with a light GREEN COTTON. Her

text: Brawne who is all solicitude.
speaker_heading: MR BROWN
dialog: I woke with the strange sensation of someone
text: holding my hand. I opened my eyes and there
dialog: was John. I knew immediately what had
dialog: happened and then he said “Tom died at 8
dialog: o'clock quietly and without pain.” Of course
dialog: Mr Keats can’t go on living there, so I have
dialog: invited him to stay with me.
text: Mr Brown stands, sighing, looking towards a numb Keats.
speaker_heading: MR BROWN (cont'd)
dialog: Aghuh, we have a long schedule of visits.
text: Fanny sits with her eyes downcast. Keats is watching her

speaker_heading: MRS BRAWNE
dialog: I don’t want to interfere with your city plans
dialog: but you are most welcome to have dinner with

speaker_heading: BLACK CLOTH.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
text: She has been sewing it all through the night.
text: Keats begins to unwrap it, enough to see the beautiful
text: stitching and the simple pattern of wild flowers on the edge.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: I am afraid I will break down. Tell me what
dialog: it is?
speaker_heading: FANNY
text: It is a pillow slip.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: Then I shall rest Tom’s head upon it.
speaker_heading: MR BROWN
dialog: Keats, the Reynolds are expecting us.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: I will catch you up. Thank you.
text: Keats kisses the pillow slip.
text: Mr Brown has come across and is whispering in Keats ear.
speaker_heading: MR BROWN
dialog: Let us get out of here.
text: It is a loud whisper, loud enough so that Fanny and Keats
text: both hear. Fanny, shamed, watches as the two men continue
dialog: discussing, she catches phrases, “would like to stay”, “we
text: are expected by HAYDEN and LAMB”.
text: Keats puts on his COAT.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: Invite me again, alone.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Come for Christmas.

dialog: Yes. Hurrah. Please do, please!
speaker_heading: MR BROWN
dialog: But Marianne Reynolds invited us for

dialog: remember they are having musicians?
text: The Brawne children are crestfallen. Fanny defiant.
speaker_heading: MR BROWN (cont'd)
dialog: I am sorry to spoil things.
speaker_heading: MRS BRAWNE
dialog: Not at all. Wherever Mr Keats is happy we are
text: happy for him.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Why can’t he be happy with us?
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Because Mr Brown wants Mr Keats all to
dialog: himself.
speaker_heading: MR BROWN
dialog: I am merely remembering to Mr Keats a previous

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Mr Keats has come!
text: Margaret runs out the kitchen back door. Fanny’s hands are

scene_heading: INT. BRAWNE DRAWING ROOM ELM COTTAGE - EVENING 35
text: Keats is crouched on the sitting room floor stroking the

speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: I wondered this morning if you are sleeping in

speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: Pardon?
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Are you sleeping in my bed?
text: Keats is confused and amazed.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: You see I believe you are. Have you forgot
dialog: that we rented Mr Brown’s half of the house
dialog: this summer while you were journeying in
dialog: Scotland? Which room did you sleep in?
speaker_heading: KEATS
text: The one overlooking the back garden.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: That was my bed. For proof, pull it out from
dialog: the wall and by the pillow you will finda
dialog: figure I drew with pin holes.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: Is the figure you?
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: No. It was a fairy princess.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: Should I be feeding her?
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: No, she refuses to eat. But what she might
dialog: like is a good night poem. Mr Keats will you
dialog: teach me poetry? I want to understand, but I
dialog: don’t know how to begin.

dialog: instructed to stir their teas in different and complimentary
text: rhythms, clanging the edges of their cups with their SPOONS

speaker_heading: KEATS
text: The English drawing room, now the Scottish.
text: Keats nods to Samuel who begins to play an impression of a
text: highland tune on his VIOLIN.
text: With PLEATED NAPKINS tucked into his pantaloons kilt-like,
text: Keats does a wild impression of a highland fling.
speaker_heading: KEATS (SCOTTISH ACCENT) (cont'd)
dialog: Theeey Kick and jump it and toe and go it and
text: twirl it and wheel it, stamp and sweat and
dialog: tattoo the floor!
text: The family clap and laugh. Keats bows and removes his
dialog: napkins.
speaker_heading: MRS BRAWNE
dialog: Formidable, very good.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: A poem!
speaker_heading: OTHERS
dialog: Oh yes, a poem.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
text: A short one.
text: The others laugh.
text: Fanny is quiet, watching, scared to betray her growing
text: affection for Keats, her head bowed.
text: Keats sits opposite and as he sits he begins to speak so
text: naturally they are only gradually aware he is reciting.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: “When I have fears that I may cease to be
dialog: Before my pen has glean’d my teeming brain,
text: Before high-piled books, in charactery,
text: Hold like rich garners the full ripen’d grain;
dialog: When I behold, upon the night’s starr’d face,
text: Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance.”

scene_heading: BLUE PAGES 04/04/08 26.
text: The family look at Keats, there is an awkward pause.
speaker_heading: KEATS (cont'd)
dialog: I do apologise, I have gone blank.
text: But Keats seems tranced.
speaker_heading: MRS BRAWNE
dialog: You must be tired. Should you like coffee and
dialog: cakes, we have not had cake.
text: Mrs Brawne is getting up, clearing the table.
text: Fanny sits opposite Keats. Neither move. Finally with what
text: seems an enormous effort Fanny rises and moves around the
text: table to take Keats’s plate. As Fanny leans forward, Keats
text: leans in towards her. As they touch, there is a suspension
text: of time, of breath in the room that makes even Samuel puzzle
text: a moment as he loosens his bow. Keats looks up at Fanny, at
text: her irresistible closeness. He runs a finger across Fanny’s
text: wrist, both confirming and breaking the spell.
speaker_heading: KEATS
text: “Two witches eyes above a cherub’s mouth.”
scene_heading: INT/EXT. FRONT DOOR SELM COTTAGE - NIGHT 37
text: At the door everyone is saying goodbye and waving. Fanny
text: walks out into the street with Keats.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Mr Keats have you remembered the poem?
scene_heading: KEATS (HE NODS AND CLEARS HIS THROAT)
text: ”“,..»Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance,
dialog: And think that I may never live to trace
text: Their shadows, with the magic hand of chance:
dialog: And when I feel, fair creature of an hour,
dialog: That I shall never look upon thee more,
dialog: Never have relish in the faery power
text: Of an unreflecting love; - then on the shore
dialog: Of the wide world I stand alone, and think
dialog: Till love and fame to nothingness do sink.”
text: Fanny and Keats look at each other. Keats is bewitched, so
text: is Fanny. Keats makes an awkward bow and coughing, walks
text: into the frosty night.
scene_heading: INT. WENTWORTH HOUSE HALL - DAY 38
text: In the dark hallway Fanny knocks on Keats and Mr Brown's

dialog: Poetry classes!
scene_heading: INT. BROWN’S DRAWING ROOM WENTWORTH HOUSE - DAY
text: Fanny and Keats sit together. Fanny listening intently.
text: Keats seems a little flat.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: A poet is not at all poetical, he is the most
dialog: un-poetical of anything in existence, he has
dialog: no identity - he is continually filling some
dialog: other body, the sun, the moon...
text: Mr Brown watches disturbed.
speaker_heading: MR BROWN
dialog: I cannot restrain my credibility longer. Miss
dialog: Brawne may I ask you a question?
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: You may.
speaker_heading: MR BROWN
dialog: Is this really you? Or are you acting?
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: It is really me.
text: Keats is looking irritated.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: Charles I have a pupil, desist or depart.
dialog: 39
text: Mr Brown gets up, takes some BOOKS and his TEA CUP with him.
speaker_heading: MR BROWN (UNDER HIS VOICE)
dialog: My modest hope is the cost of the lessons will
dialog: not be the poet.
speaker_heading: FANNY (STANDING)
dialog: The cost Mr Brown is that Mr Keats will
dialog: forthwith discuss poetry with me not you as I
dialog: shall study.
speaker_heading: MR BROWN
dialog: You don’t mean to read the poems?
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: I do until I know all the poets and poems in
dialog: the world. I have an excellent brain and
dialog: nothing to do as you have so many times noted.
scene_heading: BLUE PAGES 04/04/08 27A.
speaker_heading: MR BROWN
dialog: Let me bow to your ambition.
scene_heading: BLUE PAGES 04/04/08 28.
text: Mr Brown exits.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Now Mr Brown has gone I shall find it easier
text: to talk, he is forever scrutinising.
text: Fanny looks at Keats. She is unsettled by his darkening
dialog: mood.
speaker_heading: FANNY (cont'd)
dialog: .».Can you say something of the craft of
dialog: poetry?
text: Keats’s face darkens.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: Poetic craft is a carcass, a sham. If poetry
dialog: does not come as naturally as leaves to a tree
dialog: it had better not come at all.
text: Fanny is writing NOTES as Keats speaks.
speaker_heading: KEATS (cont'd)
dialog: I am mistaken I am not sure I can teach you.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Am I so extremely hopeless? Is it Mr Brown? I
dialog: was too rude? I can apologise.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: I don’t think I have the right feeling towards
dialog: women. I’m suspicious of my feelings.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: I don’t understand you.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: If you knew what a slave to my affections I
dialog: fear myself to be, and the fury it brings
dialog: about in me, you might understand.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Do you not like me?
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: I am attracted without knowing why, all women
dialog: confuse me, even my mother. I yearn to be
text: ruined by shrews and saved by angels and in
dialog: reality, I have only ever loved my sister.
text: Fanny begins to put on her BONNET.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: I am annoyed by my sister as often as I love
dialog: her. And I still do not know how to work a
dialog: poem out well.
scene_heading: BLUE PAGES 04/04/08 29.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: You do not work out a poem. That would undo
dialog: it’s magic. Poems need understanding through
dialog: the senses, they develop your negative
dialog: capability not rational capability.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: And what is negative capability?
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: Your capacity for being in uncertainties,
dialog: mysteries, doubts, without any irritable
dialog: reaching after fact and reason.
text: Fanny listens, not understanding.
speaker_heading: KEATS (cont'd)
dialog: The point of diving in a lake isn’t
dialog: immediately to swim to the shore but to be in
text: the lake, to luxuriate in the sensation of
dialog: water. You do not work the lake out, it is an
dialog: experience beyond thought. Poetry soothes and
text: emboldens the soul to accept mystery.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: I love mystery.
speaker_heading: KEATS
dialog: I found your little princess, on the wall by
dialog: my bed.
speaker_heading: FANNY

speaker_heading: FANNY

speaker_heading: KEATS

speaker_heading: KEATS

speaker_heading: FANNY
