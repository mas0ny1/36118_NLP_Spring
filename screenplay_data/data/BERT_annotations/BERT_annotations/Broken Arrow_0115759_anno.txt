speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: A FIST HITS A FACE
text: The fist is in a boxing glove. It belongs to VIC DEAKINS, 38.
text: The face belongs to RAWLEY HALE, 28. They are in...
scene_heading: INT. GYMNASIUM, WHITEMAN AFB - DAY
text: Hale and Deakins are sparring in a ring. Other people are
text: lifting weights, shooting baskets.
speaker_heading: IN THE RING
text: Hale and Deakins circle each other. Hale is shaking cobwebs out
text: of his head.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: You know what happened there?
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Hell, I barely know what day it is.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: I set you up. I fake right, go
dialog: left three times in a row. You
dialog: expect it again, I take the right
dialog: in hard. That's what boxing's all
dialog: about. Make your opponent think
dialog: you're gonna do one thing, then do
dialog: another. Like Ali in Zaire, using
text: the rope-a-dope on Foreman.
dialog: (mimes rope-a-dope)
dialog: Everyone thought Ali's arms were
dialog: getting destroyed, when he was
dialog: really just letting Foreman tire
text: himself out. Eighth round, Ali
dialog: starts hitting, George's got
dialog: nothing left -- fight's over.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: The fact that I can't feel the
dialog: left side of my face -- that's
dialog: okay, right?
text: Deakins laughs. Hale seizes the relaxed moment and suddenly
text: launches into Deakins with a flurry of punches.
text: THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE GYM
text: Take notice -- the fight is getting real. They move to the ring.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: Several of Hale's punches land. Deakins staggers back, caught
text: off guard. It looks like he might even go down.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: He cocks his arm back. He could finish Deakins off. But he
text: doesn't. He drops his fist.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: Seizes the opportunity and slugs back.
speaker_heading: THE CROWD
dialog: Loves it.
scene_heading: HALE AND DEAKINS
text: Now Deakins has the upperhand. He backs Hale around the ring.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Don't watch my hands -- watch my
dialog: shoulders. That's where the punch
dialog: starts. Ready?
text: Deakins hits Hale hard in the face, sending him back.
speaker_heading: THE SPECTATORS
text: Are circling the ring, following the fighters, cheering.
scene_heading: HALE AND DEAKINS
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: You were looking at my hands.
dialog: Let's try it again. Ready?
text: Deakins hits Hale hard. He's got Hale on the run.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Come on. Focus. Ready?
speaker_heading: (PUNCH)
dialog: My shoulders. Ready?
text: Deakins fakes left, puts everything into one big uppercut. It
dialog: connects.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Lands, dazed, blood trickling out of the corner of his mouth.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: He's in silhouette, the lights above him.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Looks up at Deakins, catches his breath.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
scene_heading: HALE AND DEAKINS
text: Deakins offers his hand. Hale pushes it aside. Deakins ignores
text: Hale, grabs him and helps him to his feet. Deakins climbs out
text: of the ring between the ropes.
text: Hale grabs the top rope and flips himself over, landing on his
text: feet. Deakins gives Hale a look, laughs, shakes his head.
scene_heading: INT. SHOWERS
text: Hale lets the water rinse the blood off his face.
scene_heading: INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY
text: Hale and Deakins are sitting on the bench between their lockers,
text: getting into their flightsuits, pulling on boots. Deakins is
text: smoking a cigarette. The smoke curls up into the light slanting
text: down across the room from high windows.
speaker_heading: HALE'S LOCKER
text: Is in sunlight. On the inside of his locker door are pictures
text: of exotic planes -- the SR-71, a swept-wing fighter, an artist's
dialog: rendition of the Aurora, etc.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS' LOCKER
text: On the shady side of the room. Nothing on the inside of his
text: locker door. The locker is spare, Zen-like in its neatness.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Here.
speaker_heading: HALE'S HAND
text: Slams a twenty dollar bill down on the bench.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: I can't take that.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Oh, shut up.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Really. I feel bad. How many times
dialog: have we fought and how many times
dialog: have you won?
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Jerk.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Well, if you insist.
text: Deakins grins, folds the bill and jams it into his flightsuit.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: You know why I beat you?
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Because you've been boxing for
dialog: twenty years and you're much
dialog: better at it than I am?
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: You don't want it enough. You had
dialog: me today. I was back on my heels.
dialog: But you didn't close the door.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: We were just sparring.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Life isn't sparring, Hale.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: I think I saw that on a T-shirt.
text: Deakins pulls out the twenty dollar bill; hands it back to Hale.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Here.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: No, that's yours.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: If you weren't giving it
dialog: everything you've got, then I
dialog: don't want it.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: No, I mean -- that's yours,
dialog: literally. I took it out of your
dialog: wallet when you were in the shower.
text: Deakins laughs, puts the money away.
scene_heading: EXT. WHITEMAN AIR FORCE BASE - DUSK
text: Planes taxiing, vehicles moving.
scene_heading: INT. WHITEMAN MISSION BRIEFING ROOM
text: Deakins and Hale enter to find GENERAL BOONE, 50s.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS/HALE
dialog: General.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: BOONE
dialog: Gentlemen.
text: (nods at NO SMOKING
speaker_heading: SIGN)
dialog: Deak?
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: (puts out cigarette)
dialog: What's the mission, General?
speaker_heading: BOONE
dialog: Simulate a border penetration. Hug
dialog: the ground. Scare some cows. See
dialog: if anyone can spot you.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: The usual ...?
speaker_heading: BOONE
dialog: No, actually, it's a little
dialog: unusual. You're carrying a couple
dialog: of nukes tonight, fellas.
dialog: (off their looks)
dialog: Palmdale's afraid low-level gamma
dialog: and x-ray diffusion might screw up
dialog: the peripherals. They asked us to
dialog: send a couple on a run, see if
text: anything glows.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: '61s?
speaker_heading: BOONE
dialog: (shakes head)
dialog: Big ones. '83s.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Ooh. Crowpleasers.
scene_heading: INT. HANGAR
text: A BOMB TRUCK carrying two B-83 nuclear weapons drives under the
text: wing of a big, black plane, toward the open bomb bays. GROUND
text: CREWMEN are hurrying about.
scene_heading: HALE AND DEAKINS
text: Enter and walk under the plane, nodding to the ground crew. Hale
text: and Deakins are royalty. Deakins and Hale climb up the
text: airplane's Crew Entry steps and disappear.
scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT
text: Hale and Deakins climb into a very strange cockpit. There are
text: two pilots' seats in this plane, with duplicate controls.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
text: But instead of the usual dials and gauges on the control panels,
text: there are FOUR COMPUTER SCREENS in front of each pilot. Hale
text: gets into the left seat; Deakins the right. They review
text: information on their screens, flip switches.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH BOMBS
text: Being loaded into the bomb bays. When they've been clamped into
text: place in the rotary bomb racks...
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: (into helmet mike)
dialog: Ready for rollout.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. HANGAR
text: Alarm horns sound, wheels roll on track and the huge hangar
text: doors open revealing...
speaker_heading: THE GHOST
text: An enormous black flying wing.
scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT
text: Deakins looks at maps on his computer screens. Hale looks over,
text: sees the map of Utah.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: You know, these exercises are
dialog: fantastic. I mean, when that day
dialog: comes and we finally go to war
dialog: against Utah, we are really going
dialog: to kick ass.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CANYONLANDS NATIONAL PARK, UTAH - NIGHT
text: Bright moonlight shows a campfire burning at the edge of an
text: escarpment, the Colorado River a thousand feet below. Near the
text: campfire is an Army surplus tent. Next to it, an easel holds a
text: painting in progress.
text: A PARK RANGER TRUCK
text: Drives up, stops. The driver's door open, and out gets...
speaker_heading: A RANGER
text: We don't see his face in the dark. He switches on a flashlight,
text: walks over and taps on the tent.
speaker_heading: RANGER
dialog: Park Ranger. I'd like to talk to
dialog: somebody about this fire.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
text: We hear a man and a woman -- JIM and WANDA, 60s -- wake up.
speaker_heading: JIM (O.S.)
dialog: Wha--? Oh, hell.
speaker_heading: WANDA (O.S.)
dialog: I'll talk to him, Jim.
speaker_heading: JIM (O.S.)
dialog: Wanda, you stay put.
text: Jim comes out of the tent, the ranger's light in his face.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I know -- no wood fires in the
dialog: Park. It's just -- Wanda's got a
dialog: cold and I wanted her to stay warm.
speaker_heading: RANGER
dialog: Sir, you see any other hikers,
dialog: campers anywhere around here?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Not this time of year. What's the
dialog: fine for something like this?
speaker_heading: RANGER
dialog: Your life.
text: Jim grins. But the ranger pulls out a pistol and shoots Jim,
text: who falls into the fire. He then puts three shots through the
text: wall of the tent. Nothing moves. The Ranger -- call him
text: BAKER -- pulls out a walkie-talkie, clicks on.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Done.
speaker_heading: HEADLIGHTS
text: Come on and two Humvees roll in and four men get out. Three of
text: them -- JOHNSON, a tech-whiz; LETT, gangly, grim, and NOVACEK,
text: a wiry guy in a baseball cap -- start setting up what looks to
text: be a high-tech missile launcher. The fourth man is...
scene_heading: MR. PRITCHETT
text: A neatly groomed man, 40s, with a perpetually sour attitude. He
text: looks like -- and is -- a lawyer.
speaker_heading: PRITCHETT
dialog: (to Baker, re: Jim in
speaker_heading: FIRE)
dialog: Jesus. Do you think maybe you
dialog: could get him out of the fire?
dialog: Unless you like that smell.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
scene_heading: EXT. THE NIGHT SKY
text: The Ghost flies overhead, roaring.
scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT
text: Deakins and Hale check their screens.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: (thinks of something)
dialog: Weren't you going to call Taylor
dialog: today about the Aurora Project?
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Yeah. Turns out he wants people
dialog: with more fighter hours.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: What'd you say?
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: What could I say?
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Jesus. You are such a pussy. You
dialog: never fight for anything.
text: Hale is stung. Pissed, he goes on the offensive.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Yeah, well you know what your
dialog: problem is?
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Because I said what your problem
dialog: is, you're gonna--?
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: You fight too much.
dialog: (Deakins look at him)
dialog: Right? You said it yourself --
dialog: you should be at least Wing
dialog: Commander by now. Maybe you would
dialog: be if you didn't insist on telling
dialog: people what they're doing wrong
dialog: all the time.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: I'm usually right though, aren't I?
text: Hale shakes his head, grins. Deakins clicks on his mike.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Ghost 7 to McMurran. Hey,
dialog: Wilkins, you old bag of dirt, your
dialog: boys in Utah still awake?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
scene_heading: EXT. MCMURRAN AIR FORCE BASE - UTAH
text: Establishing shot of McMurran Air Force Base.
scene_heading: INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER
text: Jammed with MEN looking at radar screens and computer monitors.
text: COLONEL WILKINS, 50s, seen it all, talks over a headset.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
text: Ready and waiting, Mr. Deakins.
dialog: And tell our favorite hotshot,
dialog: he's not gonna lose us tonight.
scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT
text: Deakins covers his mike, turns to Hale.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Wilkins says you won't lose them
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Tell Colonel Wilkins I could fly
dialog: this puppy up his ass without him
dialog: knowing.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: (grins, shakes his
dialog: head; into helmet
speaker_heading: MIKE)
dialog: Hale says ... if anyone can catch
dialog: him it'd be you.
scene_heading: INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER
speaker_heading: CU RADAR SCREEN
text: The Ghost makes a prominent blip on the screen.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: Everyone get a fix! They're about
dialog: to turn out the lights!
scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT
text: Deakins turns to Hale.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Ready, Major?
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: On your word.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Go to war.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON CONTROL PANEL - THREE BUTTONS
text: The left, labeled TAKE OFF, is lighted. The other two buttons
text: are MISSION and LANDING. Hale pushes MISSION.
speaker_heading: THE COCKPIT
text: everything goes quiet.
scene_heading: EXT. NIGHT SKY
text: The plane's running lights go out. The roar of the engines
text: quickly drops to a low rushing sound. The plane in in full
text: stealth mode.
scene_heading: INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER
speaker_heading: CU RADAR SCREEN
text: The Ghost's blip disappears.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: Lost 'em on active! Who's still
dialog: got 'em?
speaker_heading: IR CREWMAN
dialog: Got their heat signature, sir.
dialog: (points to computer
speaker_heading: SCREEN)
dialog: Their engines may be cold, but the
text: air is colder.
scene_heading: CU COMPUTER SCREEN
text: Half of the screen shows a waveform, like a voiceprint. The
text: other half shows a triangle moving across a map of Colorado.
scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT
text: Deakins studies the maps on the computer screens.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: Descend to 400 feet AGL. River
text: valley approach.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Airspeed lock at point-seven Mach.
text: Blue line descent on throttle to
text: 400 feet AGL.
text: Hale pulls back on the throttle. The plane descends.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Time to limbo down. How low can
dialog: we go.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
scene_heading: EXT. NIGHT SKY
text: The Ghost drops away from us, a stark black cut-out against the
text: moonlit Colorado landscape. The Colorado River is a winding
text: silver ribbon five miles below.
scene_heading: EXT. CANYONLANDS NATIONAL PARK, UTAH - NIGHT
text: A PARK RANGER TRUCK
text: Driving along the blacktop. The driver is not Baker. It's...
scene_heading: TERRY CARMICHAEL
text: Pretty, late 20s. Her radio squawks.
speaker_heading: CLYDE (V.0.)
dialog: Terry? You been through the
dialog: Needles entrance tonight?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (grabs mike, answers)
dialog: No. Why?
speaker_heading: CLYDE (V.0.)
dialog: Mrs. Parker called --
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Oh, God. What is it this time?
dialog: UFO abduction? Ritual human
dialog: sacrifice?
speaker_heading: CLYDE (V.0.)
dialog: She said she saw a bunch of trucks
text: going through the Needles entrance
dialog: an hour ago and thought they
dialog: looked suspicious.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yes, well, this is a woman who
text: chopped off one of her own fingers
dialog: because it'd "turned on her."
speaker_heading: CLYDE (V.0.)
dialog: Thing is, she said one of the
dialog: trucks was ours, and you're the
dialog: only one out.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (arches eyebrow)
text: She was probably hallucinating,
dialog: but I'll check it out.
scene_heading: EXT. COLORADO RIVER VALLEY - THIRTY MILES UP RIVER
text: We feel the Ghost before we hear it. It rushes over, close to
text: the river, below the ridgelines on either side of the valley.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
scene_heading: INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER
text: The triangle representing the Ghost disappears from a computer
dialog: screen.
speaker_heading: IR CREWMAN
dialog: Lost 'em.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: Stay on it. They're gonna have to
dialog: come up for air sooner or later.
scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT
text: Deakins reads his computer screens.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: We're under the radar. Proceed to
dialog: primary target.
text: Hale hits a button, lets go of the stick -- they're on
text: autopilot. It's a moment of peace. Hale looks out.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: I tell people I became a pilot
dialog: because I wanted to fly cool
dialog: planes. It's also for this. When
dialog: we're up here, I feel... closer
dialog: ... I don't know.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: To God? Is that what you're going
dialog: to say? That you feel closer to
dialog: God up here?
speaker_heading: (SNORTS)
dialog: Hell, Hale, with the payload we're
dialog: carrying, we are God.
text: Deakins notices something odd on his screen. He checks between
text: the screen and what he can see through the windshield.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Hale, take a look out your side.
dialog: I think our terrain following is
dialog: off. It's got us two klicks from
text: the left flank ridge.
text: Hale turns to look out the window on his side.
speaker_heading: HALE'S POV
text: Looking out the window. There's some movement in the reflection
text: in the glass. QUICK PULL FOCUS to see, distorted in the curve
text: of the window, Deakins reaching inside his flight suit.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Turns his head back toward Deakins.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Deak, you can't smoke in here --
text: But then Hale sees it's not a cigarette that Deakins is pulling
text: out of his flight suit. It's shiny, metal. It's...
speaker_heading: A GUN
text: And Deakins levels it right at Hale's head and his finger starts
text: to squeeze the trigger.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Grabs Deakins' hand, pushing up as...
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: Pulls the trigger and the gun FIRES.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: The bullet cuts a line through the top of his helmet, punching
text: a hole in the window by his head.
text: DEAKINS AND HALE
text: Deakins goes for another shot, but Hale grabs the gun and pushes
text: up, sending bullets through the ceiling of the plane, into the
text: walls. Deakins forces the gun down, fires.
speaker_heading: THE BULLET
text: Tears through Hale's harness, blowing apart a shoulder strap.
scene_heading: HALE AND DEAKINS
text: Hale brings Deakins' gun hand hard against Hale's own helmet.
text: Deakins yowls and the gun goes flying. Then Hale sees something.
speaker_heading: THE PLANE
text: Is banking towards a ridge-line cliff wall.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Sees it, yanks on the stick.
speaker_heading: THE PLANE
text: Banks hard away from the cliff, just missing.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 14.
scene_heading: EXT. CANYONLANDS
text: Baker gives a sign. Johnson, standing beside the missile
text: launcher-like device, hits a button. Instead of a missile, a
text: brilliant light shoots out.
scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT
scene_heading: ARMAMENTS CONTROL BUTTONS
text: Buttons include ONE, TWO, LOCK, LEFT, RIGHT, OPEN, CLOSE, ARM
text: and RELEASE. Deakins presses ONE and TWO, then RIGHT.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: No!
text: He pulls at Deakins' arms.
scene_heading: CU COMPUTER SCREENS
text: Graphics of bomb racks rotate, the B-83 nukes -- labeled and
text: glowing red -- move into the bottom spot. The word RELEASE
text: appears on the screen. Next to it, the word UNARMED flashes.
scene_heading: HALE AND DEAKINS
text: Deakins hits Hale with the back of his hand, knocking him back.
text: Hale grabs Deakins' helmet, yanks it off his head and smashes
text: Deakins back with it. Hale keys the armament buttons.
scene_heading: CU COMPUTER SCREENS
text: The nukes rotate out of the release position. RELEASE and
text: UNARMED disappear.
scene_heading: HALE AND DEAKINS
text: Deakins grabs a fire extinguisher, swings it, getting Hale in
text: the face. Hale is almost knocked out, blood running from his
dialog: nose.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - NEEDLES AREA
text: Terry is standing by her truck, talking on the radio.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Clyde, tell Mrs. Parker that
dialog: there's nothing weird going on. No
text: truck, no UFOs, and, except for
text: the odd human head on a stick, no
text: sign of Satan.
text: She feels it before she hears it or sees it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: THE GHOST
text: Rushes over Terry, no more than fifty feet above the ground. The
text: jet-wash rocks the truck, almost knocks Terry down.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Holy shit.
scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT
text: Hale groggy, hears a loud click. He looks down to see...
speaker_heading: DEAKINS' HAND
text: AUTO to MANUAL. Deakins grabs Hale's EJECTION HANDLE.
scene_heading: HALE AND DEAKINS
text: Hale tries to push the handle down as Deakins pulls it up as...
scene_heading: EXT. THE GHOST
text: Heads into the beacon light.
scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT
text: Hale and Deakins look at each other as the plane enters the
text: light and the light, in SLOW MOTION, washes across their faces.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: Suddenly lets go of Hale's hand, then hits Hale hard under the
text: chin with the fire extinguisher.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: His head snaps back as Deakins pulls.
scene_heading: HALE'S EJECTION SEAT HANDLE
text: Pop, hiss like a huge vacuum-sealed can is being opened.
scene_heading: EXT. ABOVE GHOST
text: The ejection hatch blows and is ripped away by the wind.
speaker_heading: HALE'S POV
text: As he rockets up out of the cockpit.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: When the chute opens, he almost spills out because of the
text: severed shoulder harness. He grabs the straps, holds on.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 16.
scene_heading: EXT. ON THE GROUND
text: Terry, on the radio with Clyde.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Somebody ejected!
scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT
text: Debris -- coffee cups, flight bags, anything not nailed down --
text: is whipping around the inside of the cabin. Deakins reaches
text: through the maelstrom, then reaches to the ARMAMENT BUTTONS and
text: punches them.
scene_heading: INT. BOMB BAYS
text: The the clamps snap back and the two B-83s drop toward the earth.
scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT
text: Deakins looks around, then gets an idea. He hits the LANDING
text: mission mode button and the cockpit lights up.
scene_heading: INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER
text: The Ghost starts popping up on everyone's screens. There's a
text: chorus of "I got em!" and "They're ba-a-a-ck!" Wilkins looks at
text: a screen, puzzled.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: They're not due for another
dialog: halfhour.
scene_heading: INT. GHOST COCKPIT
text: Deakins yells into his helmet mike as he gets ready to eject.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: (into helmet mike)
dialog: This is Deakins! Hale lost it!
dialog: I have to punch out!
text: Deakins pulls his second handle. BLAM! WHOOSH! He's gone. He
text: hear and feel the plane dropping, screaming toward the earth.
scene_heading: INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER
speaker_heading: CU RADAR SCREEN
text: The Ghost's blip suddenly disappears from the screen. A chorus
dialog: of "What the hell?" and "Jesus."
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: That's not good.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 17.
scene_heading: EXT. MCMURRAN RUNWAY
text: Alarm horns blare. FIVE MEN are running to a waiting Blackhawk
text: helicopter. Waving the men on is Wilkins. The last man up is...
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT COLONEL SAM RHODES
dialog: 40s, short grey hair: he could snap your neck with a look.
text: Wilkins pats Rhodes on the shoulder and Rhodes jumps into...
speaker_heading: THE HELICOPTER
text: And it lifts up and flies off.
scene_heading: EXT. CANYONLANDS
text: Hale lies, unconscious, his parachute whipping in the wind.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. SEARCH AND RESCUE HELICOPTER/DESERT
text: The helicopter glides over wind-whipped sand, searchlights on.

speaker_heading: RHODES

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PENTAGON - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CHAIRMAN

speaker_heading: GILES
text: Baird's intensely competent assistant.
speaker_heading: BAIRD

speaker_heading: GILES
dialog: Aviation Week has been following

speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: GILES (cont'd)
dialog: And when we put out a press

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: We might as well tell the truth.
speaker_heading: BAIRD
dialog: (mock shock)
dialog: The truth? How the hell did you

text: A few chuckles in the room. Baird looks at the Chairman --
text: well? The Chairman thinks for a second, nods. Baird turns to
dialog: Rick.
speaker_heading: BAIRD
dialog: Rewrite it. What Giles just said.
text: Rick grits his teeth and hurries out. Baird looks at Giles.
speaker_heading: BAIRD
dialog: I want you in Utah. Now.
text: Giles nods, heads out. Baird grabs his arm.
speaker_heading: BAIRD

speaker_heading: GILES

speaker_heading: BAIRD
dialog: Broken Arrow?
speaker_heading: CHAIRMAN
dialog: That's what we call it when we
dialog: lose a nuclear weapon.
speaker_heading: BAIRD
dialog: Oh, Jesus.
dialog: (thinks, shakes head)
dialog: I don't know what's scarier --

speaker_heading: BAIRD
dialog: They dropped from a plane but they
dialog: didn't go off...?
speaker_heading: CREELEY
text: They have to be armed to detonate.
speaker_heading: BAIRD
dialog: Then they're destroyed?
speaker_heading: CREELEY
dialog: (shakes head)
dialog: They're designed to survive

speaker_heading: BAIRD
dialog: How did this happen?
speaker_heading: CREELEY
text: In his last transmission, Colonel
dialog: Deakins said Major Hale lost

dialog: when a plane's auguring in, you
dialog: start pushing every button you can.
text: Baird stands, looks at a picture of a Ghost shakes his head.
speaker_heading: BAIRD
dialog: Hell, we should take the cost of

dialog: billion dollars a pop, that could
dialog: take a while.
scene_heading: EXT. CANYONLANDS - DAWN
text: Hale is still unconscious, lying beside his parachute. There's
text: the crunch of footsteps and a FIGURE looms over Hale. The figure
text: reaches down to touch Hale's shoulder and...
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Spins, grabs the shirt of the figure and cocks his arm about to

dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: TERRY
text: She seizes Hale's hesitation and punches him hard.
speaker_heading: HALE AND TERRY

text: Hale gets up, runs, sprinting off over the rocky terrain.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: Jarring, racing over rock and then...
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Pulls up fast, almost not fast enough.
speaker_heading: HALE'S POV

speaker_heading: TERRY (O.S.)
dialog: That would be the wrong way.
speaker_heading: TERRY

speaker_heading: HALE
speaker_heading: (TURNING)
dialog: Look, I --
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (not interested)
dialog: Gimme your hands.
text: Hale sticks his hands behind him. Terry handcuffs them.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: I'm going to tell you something I
dialog: can't tell you.
text: Terry puts away her gun, spins Hale around and starts marching
dialog: him off.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: There were nuclear weapons on that
dialog: plane. The guy I was flying with
text: is trying to steal them.
text: Terry reacts to that, but keeps Hale moving.

speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: I only ran because you punched me.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: What, we're ten years old now?
dialog: "You started it. No you started
dialog: it."
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: He has men on the ground. I --
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Save it. My dog's waiting for his
dialog: breakfast.
text: Terry starts to push Hale along again and...
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Jumps up and through the handcuffs.
speaker_heading: TERRY
text: Reaches for her revolver, but...
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Grabs it from her, puts it to-her head, but not before...
speaker_heading: TERRY
text: Whips a knife from her belt and puts it under Hale's chin.
speaker_heading: HALE AND TERRY
text: Don't move. A beat while they catch their breath.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: This isn't a stand-off, okay? I've

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yeah, well, I never keep my gun

speaker_heading: HALE AND TERRY
text: Terry holds out her hand. Hale lets the revolver swing down on
text: his finger. Just as Terry takes it...
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Moves fast, grabs Terry's knife hand, then kicks her legs out
text: from under her. Hale lands on top of her, still holding her
text: knife hand, putting the knife to her throat.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: I'm telling you the truth.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: This is a good way to convince me.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: I could kill you now. Right?
text: Terry nods, bewildered and more than a little scared.
text: Hale lets go of Terry's hand holding the knife.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: I need your help.
text: Terry looks at Hale for a long moment. She's still holding the
text: knife. She exhales, then sticks the knife in the dirt.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. HELICOPTER
text: The helicopter flies low. Rhodes looks at a device on his lap.
scene_heading: ON THE DEVICE'S SCREEN

speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Got 'em!
scene_heading: EXT. CANYONLANDS

speaker_heading: HALE

dialog: (off her look)
dialog: That's what I'd do.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Who is this guy?
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: (a flash of the
dialog: horrible betrayal he
speaker_heading: FEELS)
dialog: Someone I would've trusted with my

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: You've gotta get to a phone.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Me? What are you going to do?
dialog: (no answer, she
speaker_heading: REALIZES)
dialog: Wait. You're gonna go after this
dialog: guy? Isn't he going to have a lot
dialog: guns and shit? I don't want to
dialog: sound insulting or anything, but
dialog: ... you're just a pilot.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: I don't have any choice. The
dialog: nukes are my responsibility.
dialog: Besides...
dialog: (pulls something from
speaker_heading: POCKET)
dialog: I do have one thing going for me.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: What's that?
dialog: Hale sticks...
scene_heading: A TWENTY DOLLAR BILL
text: Under a rock.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: The last thing in the world he

speaker_heading: LETT

speaker_heading: DEAKINS (O.S.)
dialog: Sorry to disappoint you, Mr.
dialog: Pritchett.
text: They all look over to see...
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: Walk out of the shadows, smoking a cigarette. While soldierly
text: with his men, Deakins is courteous and polite with Pritchett.
speaker_heading: PRITCHETT
dialog: You said nothing would go wrong!
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Well, point of fact, nothing has.
speaker_heading: PRITCHETT
dialog: You didn't drop the nukes where
dialog: you were supposed to!
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Ah, but we always planned on the
dialog: search and rescue team finding the
dialog: weapons for us, and they have. Mr.
dialog: Pritchett, I really have thought
dialog: of everything.
text: Johnson walks up, pointing to his radio headgear.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
text: Newsflash. Two gunships just left
dialog: from McMurran and they're headed
dialog: this way.
speaker_heading: PRITCHETT
dialog: You thought of that?
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: That'll take care of itself.
speaker_heading: PRITCHETT
dialog: What about the other pilot? We
text: saw him eject.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: You don't have to worry about
dialog: Major Hale. He's probably hiding
text: behind a rock somewhere, praying
dialog: I don't find him.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: Someone else might find him.
dialog: (off Deakins' look)
dialog: A Ranger called her base, said she
text: saw a pilot come down and was
dialog: gonna go look for him.
text: Deakins thinks it over, turns to Novacek.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Get ready. You'll go when the
dialog: clean-up's done.
text: Novacek nods, goes to the helicopter.
dialog: Ext. Canyonlands - 4wd trail

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Is that the new uniform?
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Yeah. Less constricting.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: The dayshift guy left some work
dialog: clothes in the truck. You can
dialog: have them if you want.
text: Hale nods. His feet crunch on something.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Don't walk there.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Don't walk where?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: On that black stuff. That's
dialog: cryptogamic soil. It's very

speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Hello? McMurran? Come in.
text: Suddenly, there's a soft popping sound and Reed drops.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Reed? What the --?
text: Rhodes looks down, sees blood on Reed. Before he can say
text: another word, there's a fusillade of soft popping sounds as

dialog: down.
scene_heading: INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER
text: Silence from the speakers.
speaker_heading: WILKINS

scene_heading: EXT. BOTTOM OF THE CREVICE
text: Rhodes whispers to Kelly.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: We'll open up the access panels,
text: put in a couple grenades. The
dialog: nukes won't go nuclear, but they
dialog: will go dirty. I won't lie and
dialog: say we'll be all right. We won't.
dialog: But if we're gonna go, might as
dialog: well take those bastards with us.
text: Rhodes scrambles off.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Just one thing, sir.
speaker_heading: RHODES
speaker_heading: (TURNS)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: This.

text: Kelly yells up top.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Done!
text: Kelly grabs the rope, climbs fast.
scene_heading: EXT. ATOP THE CREVICE
text: Mr. Pritchett looks at Deakins, surprised. Deakins -- putting

scene_heading: THE TWENTY DOLLAR BILL
text: From his flightsuit and puts it into his shirt pocket.
speaker_heading: KELLY
text: Climbs into view.
scene_heading: INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER
text: Kelly's voice comes in over the speaker.

speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: Who is this?
speaker_heading: KELLY (V.0.)
dialog: It's Lieutenant Kelly, sir.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: What happened, Kelly?
scene_heading: EXT. ATOP CREVICE
text: Kelly talks over the helicopter's radio mike. Deakins is behind
text: him, shaving with an electric shaver.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Colonel Rhodes is dead, sir!
dialog: They're all dead!
speaker_heading: WILKINS (V. 0.)
dialog: What happened?
text: Deakins puts the shaver to the radio mike. There's a wash of 40
text: static. Deakins pulls the shaver away, nods to Kelly.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: It's the nuke, sir! It's open!
dialog: Wide open! Oh, God, what am I
dialog: going to do?!
text: Deakins puts the shaver to the mike again -- more static. He

scene_heading: INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER

speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: Brought a tear to my eye.
dialog:

speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I'd just like to thank the members
dialog: of the Academy.
speaker_heading: PRITCHETT
dialog: (to Deakins)
dialog: I hope you've got another surprise
dialog: up your sleeve. If I'm not
dialog: mistaken, there are two attack
dialog: helicopters headed this way.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: Not any longer.
text: They look at him; he taps his radio headgear.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: They've just been recalled.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: You see, Mr. Pritchett, they think
dialog: they've got an exposed core.
dialog: They'll want to get a satellite to
dialog: take a look, but it'll take ninety
dialog: minutes minimum to shift the
dialog: orbit. Until then? Well, people
dialog: get a little weird when it comes
dialog: to radiation. No one'll have the
dialog: balls to come near here unless
dialog: it's NEST -- the Nuclear Emergency
dialog: Search Teams --and it'll take the
dialog: nearest team at least two hours to
dialog: get out here, and we only need an
dialog: hour to reach our connection with

speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: What's your dog's name?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Bear. I was going to call him
dialog: Death, so I could say things like,
dialog: "I walk with Death," and "Death
dialog: chewed my boots," but I chickened
dialog: out. You?
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: No dog.
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Do you have a name, or is that
dialog: classified?
text: Before Hale can answer...
scene_heading: THE SEARCH AND RESCUE HELICOPTER
text: Rises up in front of them, Novacek piloting. Novacek thumbs a
text: button and machine guns on the sides open up.
scene_heading: TERRY AND HALE
text: Terry jumps on the brakes. She and Hale bail out as...
speaker_heading: THE TRUCK
text: is riddled with bullets and explodes.
scene_heading: TERRY AND HALE
text: Sprint up the trail.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: We've gotta hide!
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Follow me!
text: Terry leads Hale up a short slope. Hale scrambles over the top

speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Hide where?
scene_heading: IN THE HELICOPTER
text: Novacek grins, shoots.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Looks at the helicopter as the bullets whistle in. When he

speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: What the --?
speaker_heading: TERRY (O.S)
dialog: Come on!
text: Hale runs in the direction of her voice.
speaker_heading: NOVACEK'S POV

speaker_heading: HALE

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: This way.

speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: How do you --?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (looks back, still
speaker_heading: RUNNING)
dialog: I'm a Ranger. I've been over
dialog: these trails a million times.
text: Not looking, Terry runs straight into a wall, smacks her head
text: and drops like a rock.
scene_heading: IN THE HELICOPTER
text: Novacek can't see his prey. He gets an idea and reaches back.
scene_heading: TERRY AND HALE
text: Terry is trying to get her eyes to focus.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Please don't tell anyone I did
dialog: that.
scene_heading: IN THE HELICOPTER
text: Novacek has a box of grenades beside him. He pulls the pin on
text: a grenade and drops it.
scene_heading: TERRY AND HALE
text: Hale is helping Terry to her feet as BOOM -- the first grenade
text: goes off. They run.
speaker_heading: THE HELICOPTER
text: Chases them, strafing them. BOOM! -- a grenade goes off in
text: front of them. They run back. They're cornered. Hale looks
text: around, looks up.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Can you climb up?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yeah ...?
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Give me your gun.

speaker_heading: TERRY

speaker_heading: THE HELICOPTER
text: Novacek swivels the helicopter around.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: This has nothing to do with me.
speaker_heading: NOVACEK
dialog: Tell me where he is!
speaker_heading: HALE

scene_heading: IN THE HELICOPTER
text: The bullets fly up from below. One hits Novacek. He slumps,
text: pushing the joystick to one side.
speaker_heading: THE HELICOPTER
text: Starts to lean over sideways.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Is surprised -- it worked!'
speaker_heading: TERRY

dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: TERRY
text: Dives and rolls over the edge of the cliff as...
scene_heading: THE ROTOR BLADES
text: Hit the rock, sparking, grinding, right over Terry's head. The

scene_heading: THE TAIL OF THE HELICOPTER
text: Up and over, in a high arc.
speaker_heading: TERRY
text: Looks up.
scene_heading: THE TAIL --SECTION
text: Is swinging over fast and the tail rotor is coming right for her.
speaker_heading: HALE AND TERRY
text: Hale runs up, grabs Terry, pulls her to her feet as...
speaker_heading: THE TAIL SECTION
text: Swings down, rotor spinning. It digs into the dirt and sand a
dialog: split-second after...
speaker_heading: HALE AND TERRY
dialog: Run clear.
scene_heading: EXT. ATOP CREVICE

speaker_heading: PRITCHETT

text: Deakins shakes his head.
speaker_heading: PRITCHETT
dialog: Then how come the helicopter
dialog: crashed?
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: (a flicker of worry)
dialog: Pilot error.

scene_heading: BAKER AND KELLY
text: Who have taken the three-foot, pointed, front section off each

text: Pritchett walks up behind Deakins, still nagging.
speaker_heading: PRITCHETT
dialog: Tell me again how I don't need to
dialog: be here.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Mr. Pritchett, I understand your
dialog: concerns. You and your associates
dialog: gave me a lot of money to mount
dialog: this operation. But they're
dialog: getting ten times that back if we
dialog: succeed.
speaker_heading: PRITCHETT
dialog: If we succeed?
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: All I can do is my part. We've
dialog: got the weapons, we're ...
dialog: (checks watch)
text: ... seventeen minutes ahead of
dialog: schedule and everything will be in
dialog: place within two hours. But I
dialog: can't guarantee that the assholes
dialog: in Washington won't do something
dialog: stupid like not pay.
speaker_heading: PRITCHETT
dialog: What if they don't?
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Then the next census for this

speaker_heading: WILKINS

speaker_heading: GILES
dialog: That's kind of strange -- if

speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: Point?
speaker_heading: GILES
dialog: Probably nothing. I asked for a
dialog: transcript of the last cockpit

text: Wilkins nods to a CORPORAL who hands some papers to Giles. Giles
text: reads them quickly.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: I don't know what you expect to

speaker_heading: CU TRANSCRIPTS

scene_heading: CROSSCUT WITH GILES IN MCMURRAN CONTROL ROOM
speaker_heading: GILES
dialog: In the last transmission from the
dialog: plane, Colonel Deakins said Major
dialog: Hale lost it and made the plane
dialog: crash. We all assumed that meant
dialog: pilot error. But what if Deakins
dialog: meant Hale made the plane crash.
text: Murmurs of "That's insane" "No way" fill the room.
speaker_heading: BAIRD
dialog: Why would he do that?
speaker_heading: GILES
dialog: Two nuclear weapons would be worth
dialog: a hell of a lot of money.
speaker_heading: CHAIRMAN
dialog: To whom? Son, there are easier
dialog: ways for someone to buy nuclear
dialog: weapons. You go to one of the old
dialog: Soviet republics, you can get one
dialog: for the price of a BMW.
speaker_heading: GILES
dialog: I meant they'd be worth a lot of
dialog: money to us. How much would we
dialog: pay to get them back? To make
dialog: sure they weren't used in this
dialog: country?
text: A flurry of looks around the room.
speaker_heading: BAIRD
dialog: Hold on, hold on.
dialog: (to Creeley)
dialog: These nukes have codes or

speaker_heading: CREELEY

speaker_heading: BAIRD

speaker_heading: CREELEY

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Get out? I don't think that

dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Deak'd have a back-up. He'd be
dialog: prepared.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: If they've got trucks they could
dialog: take the four-wheel-drive trail we
dialog: were on.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: He wouldn't want to go towards

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: He could go to the river.

scene_heading: EXT. 4WD TRAIL

speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: You a fan of boxing, Mr. Pritchett?
speaker_heading: PRITCHETT
dialog: I think it's barbaric.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Me, too! I love it! Two men
dialog: trying to do as much damage to the

dialog: can get, don't you think?
speaker_heading: PRITCHETT
dialog: I think it should be banned.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: So do I! God, wouldn't that make
dialog: it more exciting? Having to go

scene_heading: EXT. CANYONLANDS
text: Hale and Terry stand on an outcropping overlooking the 4WD trail.

speaker_heading: THEIR POV
text: The two Humvees make their way along the trail.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: See the one in front? It just has
dialog: a driver? They wanted to keep the
text: weight down. It has the nukes.
text: Hale takes Terry's gun from her.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: You gonna shoot out the tires?
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Humvees can reseal and inflate
text: with the flick of a switch. That's
dialog: why Deak chose 'em.
text: Terry looks at Hale -- then what is he going to do?
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: I'm gonna steal it.
dialog: (checks gun)
dialog: You get to a phone and call
dialog: McMurran.
speaker_heading: TERRY
text: The nearest phone is a two-hour
dialog: walk.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Then you better start walking.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Look, I know my way around here.
dialog: You're gonna need me.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: (very serious)
dialog: I appreciate what you've done so
dialog: far. But now it gets hairy. Go
text: to the phone.
text: He scrambles off over the rock.
speaker_heading: THE HUMVEES
text: Come around a corner. The trail hugs the face of a ten-foot-
text: high cliff. Suddenly, from off the cliff...
speaker_heading: HALE AND TERRY
text: Jump down onto the roof of the lead Humvee. Hale looks at
text: Terry, angry. But before he can say anything...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 43.
scene_heading: IN THE HUMVEE
text: Baker swerves, trying to throw them off. He pulls out a pistol,
text: shoots up through the ceiling.
speaker_heading: HALE AND TERRY
text: Bullets punch up. Hale pulls out the gun. It falls from his
text: hand. Terry grabs it as a sharp swerve sends...
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Flying. He lands hard behind the Humvee.
scene_heading: IN THE SECOND HUMVEE
text: Deakins points at Hale, getting to his feet.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Run him down.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Sprints after the leading Humvee. Deakins' Humvee closes fast.
speaker_heading: TERRY
text: Looks back, sees Hale's predicament.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Here!
text: She slides the pistol along the truck roof.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Grabs the gun out of the air as...
speaker_heading: BAKER
text: Slams on the brakes.
speaker_heading: TERRY
text: Comes flying off the top, landing on the hood, barely holding on.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Is going to be crushed between the Humvees. He jumps up,
text: turning, as the bumpers come together. He lands on the tailgate
text: facing backwards and fires into Deakins' windshield.
scene_heading: DEAKINS AND KELLY
text: Kelly ducks below the dash and slams on the brakes but Deakins
text: doesn't flinch. The bullets bounce off the glass --bulletproof.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 44.
text: IN THE LEAD HUMVEE
text: Baker sticks his gun out the window and aims at Terry and starts
text: to pull the trigger when he stops, feeling a gun against the
text: back of his head.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Is behind him. Hale gets into the passenger seat.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Gimme the gun and get out.
speaker_heading: BAKER
speaker_heading: (SMIRKING)
dialog: I don't know. I think we got
dialog: ourselves a little stand-off.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: No, we don't.
text: Hale shoots Baker in the thigh. Baker howls.
speaker_heading: TERRY
text: Reaches forward and grabs Baker's gun as...
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Kicks Baker out of the Humvee.
speaker_heading: BAKER
text: Bad timing for him. He tumbles out, right in front of...
scene_heading: DEAKINS' HUMVEE
text: And is run over.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Holds the steering wheel, yells to Terry.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: You drive!
speaker_heading: TERRY
text: Climbs into the Humvee, takes the wheel from Hale. She jams
text: Baker's gun into her belt.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: I'd yell at you for coming after
dialog: me, but you did just save my life.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 45.
text: There's a look between them, then Hale climbs into the back. He
text: finds what he is looking for -- a jerry can of gasoline and an
text: emergency tool box.
scene_heading: IN THE SECOND HUMVEE
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: What're you doing, Hale?
scene_heading: IN HALE AND TERRY'S HUMVEE
text: Hale keeps his back to the other Humves. He pulls gaffer's tape
text: off a roll, tears it with his teeth, grabs...
speaker_heading: A FLARE
text: Out of the tool kit.
scene_heading: IN THE SECOND HUMVEE
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Maybe he'll set off a nuke. That'd
dialog: show us.
scene_heading: BETWEEN THE HUMVEES
text: Hale tosses the jerry can of gasoline out the back of the Humvee.
scene_heading: THE JERRY CAN OF GASOLINE
text: Flies through the air. There's a burning flare taped to the
text: side of the plastic can.
speaker_heading: ECU TIP OF FLARE
text: As the plastic of the can bubbles and melts and...
scene_heading: IN THE SECOND HUMVEE
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Stop!
dialog: But it's too late and...
speaker_heading: THE JERRY CAN
text: Explodes.
scene_heading: THE SECOND HUMVEE
text: Skids to a stop, showered with burning gasoline. Deakins and
text: his men bail out. Kelly, Johnson and Pritchett run for cover.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: Coolly grabs a fire extinguisher and starts spraying.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 46.
scene_heading: IN HALE AND TERRYS HUMVEE
text: Hale climbs up into the front seat. Terry looks at him,
text: genuinely impressed.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: We need somewhere to hide.
speaker_heading: TERRY
speaker_heading: (THINKS)
dialog: I know a place.
scene_heading: EXT. 4WD TRAIL
text: Deakins keeps spraying the burning Humvee with foam.
scene_heading: EXT. MINE ENTRANCE
text: Terry and Hale have taken the Humvee to the parking area in
text: front of an abandoned mine. The winch on the Humvee strains.
text: The cable is attached to the handles on the padlocked metal
text: doors. The doors are slowly pulling out, groaning.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: It was a copper mine, barely
text: squeaking along for years. They
dialog: shut it-down a few months ago when
text: they hit an underground river.
text: The hinges on the metal doors buckle and snap and the doors rip
text: loose. Hale shuts down the winch, unhooks it from the doors.
text: He motions for Terry to drive it in.
scene_heading: INT. MINESHAFT ENTRANCE
text: Terry drives the Humvee into the mineshaft entrance. Hale uses
text: a flashlight to look around. He finds a switch a flips it. A
text: gas generator comes to life. Another click and lights come on.
text: Now they can see the rest of the entry area, including a wire-
text: mesh-enclosed elevator. As Terry looks around, Hale grabs the
text: Humvee radio, tries to tune in other frequencies, gives up.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: They hardwired in their frequency.
dialog: We can't call out.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: What are we gonna do?
text: Hale goes to the back of the Humvee, pulls down the tailgate.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: I'm gonna take away Deakins'
dialog: reason for being here.
text: Hale grabs a screwdriver from the tool kit and pries open a
text: panel on the side of one of the B-83s.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: INSIDE PANEL
text: There's an LCD DISPLAY, a NUMERIC KEYPAD and a CLOCK showing the
text: current time. The keys are oversized and brightly colored.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Fisher-Price makes nuclear weapons?
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: They're designed to be used by
text: guys wearing gloves in Alaska.
text: He reaches in, hits a key and the LCD display lights up.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: These nukes have security codes.
dialog: If you enter the wrong code three
dialog: times, the nuke goes dead -- all
text: the circuitry shorts out and shuts
dialog: down. Kind of like the security
text: systems with car radios.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: And people say the public doesn't
dialog: benefit from defense spending.
speaker_heading: HALE
speaker_heading: (GRINS)
dialog: Hand me the radio.
text: Terry goes for the radio mike. Hale sees something.
scene_heading: A PLASTIC NAME TAG
text: Sticking out from under one of the nukes.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Pulls it out, looks at it.
speaker_heading: ECU NAMETAG
text: It's from "St. Judes Hospital, Radiology Department."
speaker_heading: HALE AND TERRY
text: Hale turns to Terry as she pulls over the radio mike.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Where's St. Judes Hospital?
scene_heading: INT. 4WD TRAIL -- DEAKINS' HUMVEE
text: The fire is out. The radio crackles.
speaker_heading: HALE (V.0.)

text: Deakins and Kelly look at each other.
speaker_heading: HALE (V.O.)
dialog: Ding, ding, ding, Deak. We're
dialog: starting a new round. You took
dialog: the first couple, but I've got you
dialog: on the ropes now, you son of bitch.
text: Deakins gets in the passenger side, grabs the radio mike.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Hey, there. What was that last
dialog: part? There was some static.
dialog: (clicks off mike; to
speaker_heading: JOHNSON)
dialog: Find them.
dialog: (to Pritchett and
speaker_heading: KELLY)
dialog: Let's go!
text: Johnson pulls out a radiation detector scanner like the one
text: Rhodes used. Kelly and Pritchett get back in the vehicle.
text: CROSSCUT BETWEEN HALE AND DEAKINS
text: Kelly drives Deakins' Humvee along the trail as they talk.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: I know you're stalling while you
dialog: try to find the nukes with your
dialog: scanner, but you're gonna be too
dialog: late. Hear that?
text: Hale holds the radio mike up to the keypad as he enters numbers.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: I'm entering the wrong code, you
dialog: bastard. A couple more times and
dialog: these are gonna be useless to you.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: You really got me there. I sure
dialog: didn't think of that.
text: Hale slows down -- something's wrong -- Deakins doesn't cars.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: All that time we spent in the
dialog: cockpit together and you think I'm
dialog: stupid? I got some new boards and
text: circuits from a friend at Pantex.
dialog: But nice try.
text: Hale curses to himself. Terry looks at him. He shakes his head
dialog: they're in trouble.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: You know, Hale, I thought of
dialog: asking you to join me on this. You
dialog: wanna know why I didn't?
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Because I would've said no?
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: I would've just killed you if you
dialog: said no. I was more afraid you'd
dialog: say yes. Because I knew I
dialog: couldn't count on you. You can
dialog: pretend you've got guts, but when
dialog: and if it comes down to it, you're
dialog: gonna run off crying like a little
dialog: girl.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: You better hope that's true, Doak.
dialog: Because I've got the nukes, and
dialog: there's nothing to stop me from
dialog: entering the right code, if you
dialog: know what I mean.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: (flash of worry)
dialog: You wouldn't do that.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Nah. You're right. I wouldn't
dialog: have the guts.

speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: How deep is this mine?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I don't know. A couple thousand
dialog: feet.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: That's deep enough.

speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: Got it! They're --
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: In the mine.

scene_heading: INT. MINE ENTRANCE

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: We can still hide them!
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: He's got a scanner. He'd find
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: You're talking about setting off
dialog: a nuclear weapon!
speaker_heading: HALE
text: They set them off underground in
dialog: Nevada all through the fifties and
dialog: sixties. There's no risk.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Tell it to the two-headed cows.
text: Hale grabs the straps around one of the nukes, pulls. He can
text: barely move the thing. He turns to Terry.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: No! I am not helping you set off
dialog: a nuclear weapon.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: We won't be down there when it
dialog: goes off. This isn't a suicide

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: No!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: HALE
speaker_heading: (IMPATIENT)
dialog: All right. Fine. Though I think
dialog: you should know, before I ejected,
dialog: I heard Deakins say the nukes were
dialog: going to be used to wipe out the

speaker_heading: HALE

scene_heading: EXT. MINE - BOTTOM OF ELEVATOR SHAFT
text: The elevator comes down. Hale slides open the gate. He and
text: Terry drag the nukes out.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: We'll each drag one down a tunnel?
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: No. I'm only going to set off one.
dialog: We'll leave the other one here.
dialog: It'll be buried under a billion
text: tons of rock.
text: They are startled when the elevator starts going up behind them
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: We better hurry.

scene_heading: INT. MINE ENTRANCE

speaker_heading: BAIRD

scene_heading: INT. END OF MINE TUNNEL
text: Hale and Terry have stopped at the end of a tunnel. Hale has
text: opened the guts of the nuke. He's pulling out a chip.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: How do you know how to do this?
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Pilots who fly with nuclear
dialog: weapons have standing orders to ...
dialog: (quoting from the
speaker_heading: MANUAL)
dialog: ... "retrieve if possible, disable
dialog: if necessary and destroy if we
dialog: must," and destroy I must.
text: He stands, looks around. He sees...
speaker_heading: EYEBOLTS
text: Screwed into the cross beaus on the ceiling.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: I'm gonna need your belt and one
dialog: of your socks.
scene_heading: INT. BOTTOM OF ELEVATOR SHAFT
text: The elevator descends into view. Deakins, Kelly and Johnson get
text: out. They see the other nuke lying there.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Send it up?
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: (shakes head)
dialog: Let's take care of Hale first.
text: Spread out.

scene_heading: INT. END OF MINE TUNNEL
text: In one hand Hale holds Terry's sock, filled with sand. His
text: other hand grips the eyebolt. Terry is giving Hale a log up,
text: straining under the weight.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Take your time. Really.
text: Hale has pushed the open end of the sock through the eyebolt. He
text: tightens a belt around the open end of the sock.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Okay.
text: Terry lets Hale down. Hale picks up a big rock and loops the
text: free end of the belt around it. Then he picks up a smaller rock.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON NUCLEAR WEAPON
text: One chip has been pulled out of a circuit board. Hale very
text: gingerly lays the small rock on top of the chip.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: We make a small hole in the sock,
dialog: and when enough sand drains out --
dialog: and we're hopefully in New
dialog: Mexico -- the sock is pulled
text: through the eyebolt, the rock
dialog: drops...
dialog: (re: smaller rock)
dialog: ... hitting the rock on this chip,
text: closing the firing circuit and
dialog: that's it.
text: Hale finishes putting the small rock in position. He stands.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: How much time are we going to have?
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: I don't know precisely. This
dialog: isn't a Swiss sock. Ten minutes,
dialog: maybe --
text: Hale is cut off by...
speaker_heading: BULLETS
text: Flying in, ricocheting off the rock walls, fired by...
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
text: Thirty yards down the tunnel.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: HALE AND TERRY
text: Dive to the ground. They pull pistols, start shooting.
speaker_heading: THE SOCK
text: One of Johnson's bullets cuts through it.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Feels sand hitting his face, looks up.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: Sand is draining out of the sock very fast.
speaker_heading: HALE AND TERRY
text: Reaches up to grab the big rock, but Johnson sends a spray of
text: bullets in. Terry grabs Hale.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Come on!
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: The sock --
text: More bullets. Terry pulls Hale. They run down a side passage.
text: Hale and Terry fire back at Johnson as they run out of sight.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
text: Shoots after them, then runs up to the weapon. He reaches for
dialog: the rock, stops -- maybe that'll set it off.
speaker_heading: THE SOCK
text: The last sand pours out; the sock is sucked through the eye-bolt.
speaker_heading: THE ROCK
text: Drops fast toward the nuke.
speaker_heading: A HAND
text: Grabs it, stopping it just in time. The hand belongs to...
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: He looks at Johnson in disgust, exhales, and tosses the rock. He
text: pulls out a walkie-talkie, clicks on, talks into it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: We're at the end of tunnel three.
dialog: (clicks off; to
speaker_heading: JOHNSON)
dialog: You two get this one set. I'll
dialog: take the other one up.
speaker_heading: HALE AND TERRY
text: Running along a tunnel.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: What do we do?
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Beat 'em back to the elevator.
dialog: Stop 'em from getting out.
text: Terry nods. They hurry off around a corner and are met by...
text: A FLURRY OF BULLETS
dialog: Fired by...
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: With his Uzi.
speaker_heading: HALE AND TERRY
text: Run back down the side tunnel, bullets winging off the rock all
text: around them, shooting back. Hale starts shooting out the
text: lights, plunging the tunnel into darkness.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: Slows down.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: The bit with the sock was good.
dialog: I like it. Still, I'm gonna use
dialog: the the Field Expedient Tactical
dialog: Timer. It's a little more precise.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: See, Hale -- you aren't the only
dialog: one who's thought of setting off
dialog: a nuke in this mine.
speaker_heading: BY THE NUKE
text: Kelly is there with Johnson. Kelly flips on a lamp on a
text: headstrap, giving him better light as he opens up the metal
text: briefcase he's been carrying.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE BRIEFCASE
text: An elaborate electronic timer.
dialog: 
dialog:

scene_heading: IN THE TUNNELS
text: Deakins pulls out a fresh clip.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: I need a demonstration. Otherwise,
dialog: some swinging dick in Washington
dialog: is going to say I don't have the
dialog: balls or the ability to set off a
dialog: nuclear weapon. I'm gonna show
dialog: these puppies I'm ready, willing
dialog: and able. Hell, I'm eager.
text: Deakins jams in his clip, walks into the dark part of the tunnel.
speaker_heading: HALE AND TERRY
text: In the dark, waiting to ambush Deakins and then...
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: Opens fire -- but not at Hale and Terry -- at the cable along
text: the ceiling connecting the lights. The cable snaps and
text: electrical sparks shoot out, flooding the tunnel with light,
dialog: showing...
speaker_heading: HALE AND TERRY
text: Suddenly exposed to Deakins' fire. The bullets whiz in.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: The muzzle flashes from his Uzi give away his position and Hale
text: and Terry's bullets scream in at him. He backs around a corner.
speaker_heading: HALE AND TERRY
dialog: Take cover. It's a stand-off.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Well, Hale, I better be going.
dialog: Look at it this way, partner. If
dialog: you wanted to get closer to God,
dialog: you are about to get your wish.
text: Hale hears Deakins' footsteps start off.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: You're gonna ransom Salt Lake
dialog: City, aren't you?
text: The footsteps stop.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: What makes you think that?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: That's where St. Judes Hospital
dialog: is. You're gonna hide the nukes
text: near the radiology department so
dialog: they won't show up an any
text: satellite radiation scans.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: I'm impressed.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: How much are you gonna ask for?
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Enough. I've got a broker in
dialog: Stockholm. Monday morning he's
dialog: going to buy me five percent of
dialog: Volvo. For the rest of my days
dialog: I'm going to live off the
dialog: dividends, happy in the knowledge
dialog: I'm helping to build the safest
dialog: car in the world.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: So that's it? You're just doing
dialog: 'this for the money? I'm kind of
dialog: disappointed.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Why would you do it, Hale?
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: That's the thing -- I wouldn't.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: If you were me.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: If I were you...?
dialog: (thinks, starts in)
dialog: Because ... because I got passed
dialog: over for promotion and goddamnit
dialog: I'm going to show the bastards
dialog: that I'm smarter than them all.
dialog: (getting angry)
dialog: Because ... everyone's selling out
dialog: and cashing in, so why not me?
speaker_heading: (ANGRIER)
dialog: Because ... because my ex-wife was
dialog: sleeping around. Because my
dialog: parents abused me. Because I ate
dialog: some sugar.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: HALE (cont'd)
speaker_heading: (FURIOUS)
dialog: Because I don't like Mondays.
dialog: (takes a breath,
speaker_heading: GRINS)
dialog: It's all bullshit, Deak. There
dialog: are no reasons. Not really.
dialog: There's no difference between you
text: and the guy who shoots up the
dialog: schoolyard with an M-16. You both
dialog: think you have reasons. You both
dialog: think you were wronged. The
dialog: truth? You're both just fucked in
dialog: the head.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS' FACE
text: Grim, evil -- fades into darkness as he turns and walks off.
speaker_heading: HALE AND TERRY
text: They hear footsteps, receding. Hale bolts out of their hiding

scene_heading: INT. MINESHAFT ENTRANCE

speaker_heading: HALE AND TERRY
text: Back around a corner, side by side, shooting their pistols.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
text: Is shot, drops.
speaker_heading: KELLY
text: Grabs Johnson's Uzi and, firing both guns, backs to the

speaker_heading: HALE AND TERRY

scene_heading: INSERT - ECU NUKE TIMER

speaker_heading: TERRY

speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Come on.
text: Hale pulls Terry, running, down the far tunnel.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: What're you --?
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: You said they shut down the mine

scene_heading: INT. MINESHAFT ENTRANCE

speaker_heading: THEIR POV
text: Dark water rushes by ten feet below them.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Any idea where it goes?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: No.

speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: No time. And if they get out,

speaker_heading: HALE AND TERRY
text: Dodge them, push off, duck under. And then they notice that...
speaker_heading: THE CEILING
text: Is getting lower, getting closer to the surface of the water.
text: They're running out of breathing room. Three feet, two feet,
text: one foot. They take big breaths, maybe their last, and

speaker_heading: UNDERWATER

speaker_heading: PRITCHETT

speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: Very suddenly and very violently lashes out. The side of his

speaker_heading: PRITCHETT

dialog: of the local brain trust was
text: robbing old Bob Kearney in front
dialog: of the ATM. I bear old Bob
text: yelling and I see Tommy heading
dialog: for his car, so I tossed a bag of
text: groceries at him at thirty miles
text: an hour. A frozen chicken in the
text: bag hit him in the forehead and he
dialog: dropped like a rock. Next thing
dialog: I know, I'm a Ranger.
text: Hale looks at Terry with a new appreciation.
scene_heading: EXT. 4WD TRAIL
text: Deakins pilots the Humvee along the trail.
scene_heading: EXT. COLORADO RIVER - RIVERBANK TRAIL
text: Hale and Terry are crouching behind a rock, looking down.
speaker_heading: THEIR POV
text: A zodiac raft has been pulled up on the river bank. A man with
text: an Uzi -- SHEPPARD -- waits, duffel bag by his feet.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Get me a frozen Zacky's fryer and
text: he's a dead man.
text: There's the sound of an approaching engine. Sheppard stands,
text: gun ready. The engine stops. A few seconds later...
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: Appears, walking down a footpath toward Sheppard.
speaker_heading: SHEPPARD
dialog: Where is everyone?
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: I am everyone. Let's go.
text: Sheppard hurries to Deakins. They disappear up the footpath.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: HALE AND TERRY
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: We're the only ones who know
dialog: what's going on, and I don't have
dialog: the faintest idea how we're gonna
dialog: stop them.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: You'll think of something.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Why do you say that?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: You have so far.
text: Hale looks at Terry -- she's right. But it almost pisses him
text: off more than it gives him confidence. He grumbles to himself
text: and starts off down toward the raft.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Sink it?
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Steal it.
text: They get down to the raft. They climb in. Hale grabs the
text: engine throttle, slumps.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Keys.
text: Hale looks around, spots Sheppard's duffel bag lying on the
text: riverbank. He hops out and starts rummaging through it when
text: they hear grunting and feet approaching.
text: Hale looks around for a place to hide. There isn't any. Terry
text: tries to get out of the raft, but she trips on a tarpaulin
text: bunched on the bottom of the raft. she drops.
text: WITH DEAKINS AND SHEPPARD
text: Coming down a path, lugging the last remaining nuke.
speaker_heading: THEIR POV
text: Of the raft. Hale and Terry are nowhere to be seen.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Is alone, in the water, on the far side of the raft, very
text: silent. He hears Deakins and Sheppard load the nuke into the
dialog: raft.
speaker_heading: SHEPPARD (O.S.)
dialog: Why were you driving around with
dialog: a dead guy?
speaker_heading: DEAKINS (O.S.)
dialog: Because I like him. He doesn't
dialog: ask a lot of annoying questions.
dialog: All right?
text: A few seconds later the engine starts up. Hale ducks down under
text: water as the raft takes off over him. He surfaces to watch the
text: raft zooming off into the distance. He is very worried.
scene_heading: ON THE RAFT - MOVING
text: The nuke is on a pallet in the middle of the raft. Sheppard
text: pilots the raft. Deakins looks around, sees what he wants.
speaker_heading: A TARP
text: Is lying on the deck of the raft along one side, all bunched up.
dialog: It'd be the kind of thing you'd hide under.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: Grabs the tarp and pulls.
speaker_heading: UNDER THE TARP
text: There's no one there.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: Throws the tarp over the nuke. As he does, we PAN OVER to...
text: A LONG CRATE MARKED "LIFE JACKETS"
text: Strapped to one of the side pontoons. A small triangle of cloth
text: is sticking out from inside the crate -- like the corner of a
text: shirt. It's quickly pulled out of sight from within.
text: BACK ON THE RIVERBANK
text: Hale climbs out of the water and looks around, not knowing quite
dialog: what to do.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE POWELL - TRANSFER POINT
text: The zodiac boat is on the shore. Sheppard and four man -- call
text: them the GUNMEN -- are hauling the nuke to the truck. Deakins
text: walks with another man -- MAX, 50s. Max checks his watch.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: The depositing instructions are in
dialog: the envelope that came with this
dialog: tape. This deadline is not
dialog: negotiable, and there is no grace
text: period. The device is on a timer.
dialog: Shortly after you receive this,
dialog: the timer will be activated. At
dialog: nine a.m., I will make a call. If
dialog: I find out you've done as you've
dialog: been told, I will stop the timer.
dialog: If you have not complied --
text: The screen suddenly cuts to a flurry of images of nuclear
dialog: destruction -- buildings being knocked sideways, mushroom
text: clouds, shockwaves, fires.
speaker_heading: CHAIRMAN
dialog: Turn that off!
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE POWELL
text: Hale runs along the shoreline, headed for...
speaker_heading: A MARINA
text: Where houseboats are rented out. Hale's eyes focus on a sign
text: with a picture of a phone on it.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE POWELL - TRANSFER POINT
text: The back gate of the truck is shut from the inside. The truck
text: starts up and rumbles off, slowly at first.
speaker_heading: TERRY
text: Jumps up from the raft and runs after the truck, staying right
text: behind. She grabs a handhold and pulls herself up. She holds
text: on tight as the truck bounces off down the dirt road.

scene_heading: INT. PENTAGON SITUATION ROOM
text: Loud voices and crosstalk. Baird is on the phone, nodding.
speaker_heading: BAIRD
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Creeley's phone rings. He answers it.
speaker_heading: CREELEY
dialog: Creeley.
speaker_heading: BAIRD
dialog: (covers phone; to
speaker_heading: CHAIRMAN)
dialog: The President wants to know if we
dialog: know where the device is headed.
speaker_heading: CHAIRMAN
dialog: If Deakins had a plane waiting, it
dialog: could be anywhere. We just don't
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: CREELEY
dialog: I do.
dialog: (all eyes on him)
text: Major Hale is alive. According to
text: him, Colonel Deakins is headed for
dialog: Salt Lake City.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE POWELL - MARINA
text: Army helicopters are landing near the marina. Two are already
text: down. One has TROOPS standing outside of it.
scene_heading: HALE, WILKINS AND GILES
text: Are walking toward the second helicopter.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: We found the raft on the other
text: side of the lake. Tracks from a
text: heavy truck ran out when they hit
dialog: the paved road.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: If we get a rad scanner we can
dialog: track them.
text: A brief look between Wilkins and Giles.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: Actually, Major, we're going back
dialog: to McMurran.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: What?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: GILES
dialog: We'd just like to ask you a few
dialog: questions.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: I'm not wasting time answering
dialog: questions. We've got --
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: No debate, Major. I was given
dialog: orders. Now, you can come with us,
dialog: or you can go with them.
text: Wilkins nods over at the other helicopter. The troops standing
text: in front of it are MPs. Hale looks at Wilkins, astounded.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. WILKINS' HELICOPTER - IN FLIGHT
text: Wilkins is up front with the pilot. Hale and Giles are in back.
text: All wear headsets. Hale is yelling at Wilkins.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Deakins thinks I'm dead. He
dialog: thinks it's over. You've got to
dialog: let me go after him. I can help.
dialog: I know how his mind works.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: Major, I know this is personal for
dialog: you, but I think we can handle it.
dialog: We're putting a wall of men and
dialog: machines around Salt Lake City as
dialog: we speak. That truck is not
dialog: getting through.
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK
scene_heading: CLOSE ON THE NUCLEAR WEAPON
text: Dusty slices of light come through the truck's slatted walls.
text: The nuclear weapon is lashed to a hammock, straps running off to
text: D-rings on the sides. Max is hooking up an electronic timer.
scene_heading: INT. WILKINS' HELICOPTER
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: What about the Ranger?
speaker_heading: GILES
dialog: What about her?
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: When you find that truck, you'll
dialog: hit it hard. Chances are she'll
text: be killed in the crossfire.
dialog: "Regrettable but unavoidable."
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 77.
text: Giles and Wilkins share a look -- Hale is right.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Look, she's not supposed to be
dialog: there. She should be checking
dialog: camping permits, finding lost
dialog: kids. She...
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: She saved my life.
text: Giles wants to help. So does Wilkins, but...
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: We were ordered to take you back
dialog: to McMurran. You understand what
dialog: orders are, don't you, Major?
text: Wilkins turns away. Hale sits back, mind racing, not knowing
text: what to do. He quickly grabs a pistol from the helicopter's
text: weapons rack and puts it to Wilkin's neck.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: Major, put that away or say
dialog: goodbye to your career and hello
dialog: to twenty years in Leavenworth.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: If that's what it takes.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: You'll have to shoot me.
text: Hale thinks, but there's no way he can do that. He lowers the
text: gun, sits back.
text: Giles gets Hale's attention, then points to his own head. Hale
text: doesn't understand, so Giles grabs Hale's gunhand and puts the
text: gun up to his head.
speaker_heading: GILES
dialog: Colonel! How about this?
text: Wilkins looks back, sees Hale holding the gun to Giles' head.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: (bad acting)
dialog: I swear to God I'll shoot.
text: Wilkins grins.
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK
text: Max finishes hooking up the timer. He looks at Deakins.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Ready when you are.

speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Wait until I get back. I'm going
dialog: to check on Sheppard.
text: Deakins goes to a ladder that leads up to the ceiling.
scene_heading: INT. WILKIN'S HELICOPTER
text: Hale is looking back and forth between what he sees out the
text: window and the map on his lap.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: I don't know what you're looking
dialog: for, Major. Every road between
dialog: here and salt Lake has already
dialog: been sealed.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Deak would know that. Maybe he's
text: not on the road.
text: Wilkins doesn't understand.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: They were using maps like these to
dialog: set up the roadblocks?
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: Yes...?
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Then that's the answer.
text: Wilkins doesn't understand. Hale points outside, down at...
speaker_heading: TRAIN TRACKS
text: On the ground. Old ones, half-covered by weeds.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: It's an old spur. Probably hasn't
dialog: been used in twenty years. Nobody
dialog: bothered to put it on the new maps.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: What are you --?
speaker_heading: HALE
text: The nuke isn't in a truck,
text: Colonel. It's on a train.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN
text: A freight train -- engine, a car carrier (carrying a load of
text: Toyotas), several boxcars and a caboose. A hatch opens up an
text: the roof of one of the boxcars near the tail of the train and...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: Climbs out and we discover that indeed they are not in a truck,
text: they're in a train. The "nuke boxcar" has a small satellite
text: dish mounted on the roof.
scene_heading: THE FOUR GUNMEN
text: Are in position at points along the train, ready with Uzis.
scene_heading: INT. WILKINS' HELICOPTER
text: Wilkins hangs up the radio mike.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: Radio's still down. We'll head
dialog: north, look for a phone, then look
dialog: for a train.
text: Giles nods. Hale is thinking. Wilkins starts to tell the pilot.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: No. Go south.
speaker_heading: GILES
dialog: Salt Lake is north.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: He's not going to Salt Lake.
speaker_heading: GILES
dialog: But you said it would be Salt
dialog: Lake. You found that hospital tag.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: He planted that. He wanted
dialog: whoever found it to think that's
dialog: where he was going.
dialog: (Shakes head)
dialog: He's been doing a rope-a-dope.
text: Giles and Wilkins look at him like he's nuts.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: It's a boxing term. When Ali --
dialog: Look, I know this guy. If
dialog: everything has been saying he's
text: heading north, then he's heading
dialog: south.
text: They look at him, then Wilkins grabs the map.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: What's south of here?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: ECU MAP
text: Wilkins' finger follows the train line on the map. It goes

speaker_heading: HALE

speaker_heading: GILES

scene_heading: INT. TRAIN ENGINE - DRIVER'S COMPARTMENT
text: Sheppard is working with a torch, welding the brake and

speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: How much longer?
speaker_heading: SHEPPARD
dialog: Almost done.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN ENGINE ENGINE AREA
text: Behind the driver's compartment is the engine itself, with

speaker_heading: TERRY
text: Creeps-up to one of the doors that lead into the driver's

speaker_heading: SHEPPARD (O.S.)
dialog: How long until the helicopter gets

scene_heading: INT. DRIVER'S COMPARTMENT
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Five minutes. We'll leave from

scene_heading: INT. TRAIN ENGINE - ENGINE AREA

speaker_heading: TERRY

text: As Deakins goes out the back door of the engine, Terry follows.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN - BETWEEN ENGINE AND BOXCAR
text: Terry comes out the door and is about to step across to the
text: ladder on the boxcar when we PULL BACK to reveal...
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: As he puts a gun to the back of Terry's head.
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION AND MINI-MART
text: A RANCHER comes out of the mini-mart with a cup of coffee and

text: he hears, incongruously, whump-whump-whump. He looks up as...
scene_heading: WILKINS' HELICOPTER
text: Comes in, gets about three feet off the ground and Giles jumps
text: out. As Giles runs to a payphone, the helicopter pulls up and
text: flies away, leaving the Rancher agog.
scene_heading: INT. NUKE BOXCAR
text: Terry comes down the ladder from the hatch, followed by Deakins

speaker_heading: DEAKINS

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (to Terry)
dialog: A pleasure.
dialog: (to Deakins)
dialog: What the hell is a "Terry" and why
dialog: is it still live?
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: She asked me how I thought I was
dialog: going to get away with this and I
dialog: thought I'd tell her.
dialog: (to Terry)
dialog: We're going to a cabin in the
dialog: mountains, not far from here. When
dialog: we get there I'm gonna make two
dialog: phone calls.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS (cont'd)
dialog: The first is to the Pentagon. I'm
dialog: gonna tell them where the train
dialog: is.
speaker_heading: (GRINS)
dialog: See, all their forces are up at
dialog: Salt Lake by now. By the time
dialog: they could get a F-15 down here
dialog: the train will be on the outskirts
dialog: of Vegas. And I'll remind them
dialog: about the impact trigger -- if
dialog: they hit this train hard, the
dialog: nuke'll blow.
dialog: (shakes head)
dialog: They won't have any choice.
dialog: They'll have to let the train get
dialog: into the city and because of that,
dialog: they'll have to pay.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: You said two phone calls.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: The second will be to my bank in
dialog: Geneva. If the money's in my
dialog: account, I use this...
dialog: (pulls out what looks
dialog: like a modified cell-
speaker_heading: PHONE)
dialog: ... and shut down the timer. If
dialog: not, we sit back, put on some
text: shades and get a quick tan.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: But -- radio isn't working.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: You saw the dish on the roof?
dialog: Microwave. It's not affected by
dialog: EMP. See? I really have thought
dialog: of everything.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You kept her alive just so you can
dialog: impress her with how smart you are?
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: (to Max)
dialog: No, I kept her alive because I
dialog: want her to do me a favor. See,
dialog: if something goes wrong and this
text: thing goes off, a half a million
dialog: people are going to be vaporized.
dialog: I don't want that on my
dialog: conscience. So I'm not going to
dialog: arm the nuke.

scene_heading: ECU TERRY'S EYES

speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Seven ... Star ... One...

text: The images of the retirees, the teenagers and the children each
text: bleach out to white, fast, as if hit by a nuclear blast.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: Then ENTER and it's done.
speaker_heading: TERRY
text: Her finger hovers over the ENTER button, almost pushes it, then

text: The display goes blank.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: Stunned. He shakes his head.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Ooh. You really shouldn't have

dialog: you, and I will.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I'm gonna be dead either way. I
dialog: don't want any part of this.
text: Deakins shrugs -- he sees her logic. He puts his gun to Terry's
text: head. Terry shuts her eyes.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Night-night.
text: Deakins is about to pull the trigger when Max stops him. Max
text: gestures -- listen. They hear a helicopter approaching. Max
text: checks his watch.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: They're early.
text: Just then, they hear gunfire. Max gives Deakins a look.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: It's not a problem. Set the

speaker_heading: MAX
text: Presses ENTER and finishes setting the timer.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: There.
speaker_heading: TERRY AND MAX
text: Terry swings hard and fast with the wrench, knocking the gun out
text: of Max's hand. Max spins, and when Terry swings at him again.
text: Max kicks the wrench out of her hand, then steps up fast and
text: hits Terry under the chin with the heel of his hand. She drops
text: straight back.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Thought I was just friendly old
dialog: Max, huh? Lady, I was a Navy SEAL.
dialog: You should see what I can do with
dialog: just my thumb.
text: Max goes for his gun.
speaker_heading: TERRY'S HAND
text: Grabs onto something. It's the wrench.
speaker_heading: TERRY AND MAX

speaker_heading: TERRY

scene_heading: DEAKINS AND THE GUNMAN

speaker_heading: DEAKINS

speaker_heading: HALE AND TERRY
text: Drop ten feet to the roof of a boxcar. Hale shoots as they fall.
speaker_heading: SHEPPARD
text: Is hit and drops.
speaker_heading: THE HELICOPTER
text: Banks away fast, making ugly sounds, smoke billowing out. The
text: engine cuts out and the helicopter drops to a hard landing
text: beside the tracks.
speaker_heading: HALE AND TERRY
text: Watch the helicopter land as the train rolls on. They look at
dialog: each other.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: You stop the nuke. I'll stop the
dialog: train.
text: Hale nods. Terry starts forward, then turns.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I'd yell at you for coming after
dialog: me, but you did just save my life.
text: Hale grins. They hear a helicopter in the distance. They look
dialog: over to see...
scene_heading: A RED CROSS HELICOPTER
text: Coming in fast.
speaker_heading: HALE AND TERRY
text: Any excitement turns to confusion when they see...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: A MAN
text: Standing in the doorway of the Red Cross helicopter, holding a
dialog: gun.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: That's Deakins' escape route.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Not any more.
text: Terry nods. They share a last look, then Terry heads off. Male
text: coils up the winch cable, slings it over his shoulder and heads
text: for the nuke boxcar and his old friend Deakins. He picks up...
speaker_heading: THE SHOTGUN
text: Left by deceased Gunman #2.
scene_heading: EXT. CAR CARRIER
text: Makes her way past the Toyotas.
scene_heading: EXT. WILKINS' HELICOPTER - BESIDE TRAIN TRACKS
text: Wilkins and the pilot stand outside their disabled helicopter.

dialog: turn to see...
speaker_heading: A PICKUP TRUCK
text: Tearing toward then along a dirt road, horn honking.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON PICKUP
text: The RANCHER from the mini-mart is driving; Giles beside him.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN ENGINE - DRIVER'S COMPARTMENT
text: Terry comes into the driver's compartment. She tugs at the
text: brake and accelerator levers. It's useless. She looks around,
text: spots a cigarette lighter.
scene_heading: INT. BOXCAR
text: Deakins and the one remaining GUNMAN hear the helicopter. They
text: start toward the ladder to the roof hatch when they hear
text: footsteps on the roof of the car. Deakins gestures to the
text: gunman. He raises his gun, trying to figure out where to shoot.
text: Then they hear someone tugging at the hatch handle. The gunman
text: opens fire on the hatch.
scene_heading: EXT. ON TOP OF BOXCAR
text: Bullets stream up through the hatch cover, but Hale is nowhere
text: in sight. One end of Hale's helicopter winch cable is tied to
text: the hatch cover.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 90.
text: We follow the cable fast, over to the side of the boxcar to
dialog: find...
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Standing, tugging on the cable, still attached to the harness.
text: Hale racks a load in the shotgun and jumps back off the side of
dialog: the train.
scene_heading: INT. BOXCAR
text: The gunman hears a sound, starts to turn, just as...
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Swings into the boxcar on the cable, firing the shotgun.
speaker_heading: THE GUNMAN
text: Is picked up by the blast and smashed back through the wood slat
text: wall of the boxcar and out of the train.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: Climbs up fast through the hatch to the roof.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Shoots at Deakins, misses. The shotgun clicks empty. Hale
text: tosses the gun then unhooks the cable from the harness. He
text: drops to the floor-of the boxcar and runs to the ladder.
scene_heading: EXT. CAR CARRIER
text: Terry has a three-foot length of gasoline-soaked cloth stuffed
text: into the gas tank opening of a Toyota on the lower level of the
text: car carrier. She lights it and hurries off.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN
text: Deakins steadies himself as...
scene_heading: THE RED CROSS HELICOPTER
text: Hovers in sideways toward the train. The MAN in the doorway
text: holds out a hand to Deakins.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: Is reaching for the man's hand and grabs it when...
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Reaches out of the hatch and grabs onto Deakins' foot.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 91.
scene_heading: HALE AND DEAKINS

text: Moves sideways over the train.
scene_heading: IN THE HELICOPTER
text: Deakins turns, pulling his gun and shoots down at the train as...
speaker_heading: THE HELICOPTER
text: Moves back sideways over the train.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS' POV
text: No sign of Hale on the train roof.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Get us out of here!
speaker_heading: THE PILOT
text: Nods and starts to lift and bank. Then he gets an odd
text: expression. The helicopter isn't doing what he wants.
speaker_heading: THE HELICOPTER
text: Is hovering over the train, but it can't fly away because...
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Is hanging onto the skids and he's hooked the cable to the skid.
text: The other end of the cable is still attached to the hatch.
speaker_heading: THE HELICOPTER
text: Strains against the cable, but it doesn't snap.
scene_heading: IN THE HELICOPTER
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Hurry!
speaker_heading: POWER LINES
text: Cross the track, a quarter-mile ahead.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: Leans out of the helicopter with his Uzi, shooting down at...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Who grabs onto the cable and slides down it to the roof of the
text: train, bullets plugging in all around his. He jumps down
dialog: through the hatch as...
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: Sees what's coming and jumps.
speaker_heading: THE HELICOPTER
dialog: Hits...
scene_heading: THE POWER LIKES
text: Which snap, shoot sparks and wrap around the helicopter's rotor.
speaker_heading: THE HELICOPTER
text: Breaks up and flies apart as the train rolls on.
scene_heading: EXT. CAR CARRIER
text: The flame burning up the gas-soaked cloth goes into the Toyota
dialog: gas tank and...
speaker_heading: THE TOYOTA
text: Explodes.
scene_heading: INT. NUKE BOXCAR
text: Hale gets to his feet, goes to look at the nuke.
speaker_heading: ECU NUKE TIMER
text: Five minutes and counting.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Looks at it, trying to figure out how to disarm it. He hears
text: the whoosh-thump of someone jumping down into the boxcar. He
dialog: turns.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: Stands there, trying to smile, trying to be cool, but...
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: They would've paid and I would've
dialog: stopped it. You've made a very,
dialog: very big mistake.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: It's over, Deak. I beat you.
dialog: Disarm it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: If it's over and you beat me, you
dialog: disarm it.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Deak...
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Course you are going to need this.
dialog: (holds cell-phone
speaker_heading: REMOTE)
dialog: All you have to do is get it.
dialog: (puts remote in
speaker_heading: POCKET)
dialog: And if you do, as a special added
dialog: bonus, you get this.
text: Deakins pulls out...
scene_heading: THE TWENTY DOLLAR BILL
text: Then pockets it.
scene_heading: HALE AND DEAKINS
text: Share a look. Deakins puts up his fists.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Ready?
text: Hale puts up his fists.
scene_heading: EXT. CAR CARRIER
text: It's a chain reaction, with one flaming Toyota setting off the
text: one above it or next to it.
scene_heading: BETWEEN BOXCAR AND CAR CARRIER
text: Terry is looking under the car carrier.
speaker_heading: TERRY'S POV
text: The train car axle is smoking, grinding, glowing red in the heat
text: from the flaming Toyotas.
scene_heading: INT. BOXCAR
text: Hale and Deakins circle each other.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Modern boxing is a pussy sport.
dialog: They want to make it about scoring
dialog: points. It's not about scoring
dialog: points! It's about this!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 94.
text: Deakins fakes a right, jabs with his left, catching Hale on the
text: chin. Hale is jarred. Blood runs from his mouth.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Okay. You're bleeding. Good. In
dialog: the old fights, there'd be so much
dialog: blood, guys would slip and fall.
dialog: Let's see if we can't get a little
dialog: more of that red goo out of you.
dialog: Ready?
text: Again Deakins fakes right, jabs left. Hale half blocks it, but
text: is sent back.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN
speaker_heading: CU TRAIN AXLE
text: The axle is bending, grinding, groaning.
speaker_heading: TERRY
text: Is between the car carrier and a boxcar, looking down at the
text: axle, not knowing what the hell she's going to do when she hears
text: a horn honking. She turns.
scene_heading: INT. BOXCAR
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Used to be, every fight was to a
dialog: knockout. You know what happens
dialog: when you get knocked out? It's
dialog: your brain slapping against the
dialog: inside of your skull. Here. I'll
dialog: let you see what it's like. Ready?
text: Deakins steps toward Hale, about to finish him off. Deakins
text: swings. Hale ducks, comes up hard with all he's got, gets
text: Deakins under the chin and Deakins sails up and back, landing
text: prone, seeing stars.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Stands over Deakins, in silhouette, the light of the hatch above
dialog: him. And then...
scene_heading: EXT. THE TRAIN AXLE
dialog: Snaps and...
speaker_heading: THE TRAIN
text: Jumps the tracks.
scene_heading: INT. BOXCAR
text: Hale is thrown off his feet.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 95.
scene_heading: THE NUCLEAR WEAPON
text: Swings wildly in the hammock webbing.
speaker_heading: THE STRAPS
text: Securing the webbing to the walls of the car start to snap.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN
text: The front cars accordion sideways off the tracks, down a short,
text: steep, embankment. It's all grinding, twisting, groaning metal.
scene_heading: FLAMING TOYOTAS
dialog: Fly, tumble, explode.
scene_heading: INT. BOXCAR
text: Hale tries to get to his feet, but then the floor starts
text: dropping below him as...
scene_heading: EXT. THE TRAIN
speaker_heading: THE NUKE BOXCAR
text: Goes down the steep slope of the embankment and stops.
speaker_heading: THE TRAIN
text: The sounds of the crash cease. Dust and smoke. Burning Toyotas.
scene_heading: INT. BOXCAR
text: Flickering light from a burning Toyota comes in through the
text: slatted walls. In this weird light, Hale sees...
scene_heading: THE NUCLEAR WEAPON
text: It's above him, at the end (top) of the car. It's hanging in
text: mid-air, tangled up in the webbing. Two straps are the only
text: things keeping the nuclear weapon from dropping twenty feet to
text: the bottom of the car.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: Is lying at the bottom (end) of the car, directly under the
text: nuke, not moving.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Looks around for something. He sees it --
scene_heading: DEAKINS' REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE
text: On the floor.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS' EYES
text: Flicker open. He sees...
speaker_heading: A PISTOL
text: Lying a few feet away.
speaker_heading: HALE
speaker_heading: DEAKINS (O.S.)
dialog: You have to push amber, then red.
dialog: You might have time to push amber.
dialog: You won't get to red.
text: Hale turns to see...
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: Pointing a gun at him.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: The nuke is armed, Deak. If it
dialog: falls, the impact trigger will set
dialog: it off.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Half a million people will die.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: (thinks, shrugs)
dialog: Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
scene_heading: ONE OF THE STRAPS
text: Holding the nuke tears through. One strap left.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: His finger hovers over the amber button.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
dialog: Do it and I shoot.
text: Hale looks at Deakins.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: I guess you really don't know me
dialog: that well after all.
text: Hale presses the amber button.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: Shoots.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Spins back, blood spraying from his shoulder.
speaker_heading: THE REMOTE
text: Falls from his hand.
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: Is about to shoot again, then hears a tearing and looks up as...
speaker_heading: THE LAST STRAP
text: Rips through and...
speaker_heading: THE NUKE
text: Drops toward him, point first.
scene_heading: HALE'S BLOODY HAND
text: Grabs the remote and his finger presses the RED button.
speaker_heading: ECU NUKE TIMER
text: Mid-air, dropping, the clock and display go blank as...
speaker_heading: DEAKINS
text: His eyes fill with true terror as...
scene_heading: THE NUCLEAR WEAPON
text: Punches into Deakins, point first, crushing him.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Gets to his feet and stands over Deakins. He reaches down,
text: opens Deakins' pocket and pulls out the twenty-dollar bill.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Ready.
text: He heads out of the boxcar.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN TRACKS
text: Hale climbs out of the boxcar and starts running through the
text: train wreckage and burning cars, looking for Terry.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: A TV NEWSVAN
text: Pulls up and a REPORTER and CAMERAMAN jump out.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Keeps running through the wreckage. He stops, unable to breathe
dialog: when he sees...
speaker_heading: A FOOT
text: In a boot, sticking out from under a burning Toyota.
speaker_heading: HALE
text: Runs to the car, pulls at the foot, tries to push the car off
text: the body underneath. O.S. another vehicle drives up.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Come on! Oh, God. Oh, no.
text: Hale is pulling hard on the foot when...
speaker_heading: TERRY (O.S.)
dialog: The Air Force pays you so little
dialog: you have to steal shoes off dead
dialog: people?
text: Hale turns to see...
speaker_heading: TERRY
text: Walkins over from the Rancher's pickup truck.
scene_heading: WILKINS AND GILES
text: Are behind her, grinning.
speaker_heading: HALE AND TERRY
text: Run to each other. They embrace, start smoothing each other's
text: hair, start wiping blood off each other's faces, start kissing,
text: only to be interrupted by...
scene_heading: THE TV REPORTER AND CAMERMAN
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: What happened here?
text: Hale and Wilkins and Giles share a look.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Uh...
dialog: (looks at flaming
speaker_heading: TOYOTAS)
dialog: ... somebody was trying to steal
text: some Toyotas.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 99.
text: The reporter asks more questions. Hale and Terry walk off, arms
text: around each other. As they go, Hale sticks out his hand to
dialog: Terry.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Rawley Hale.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Terry Carmichael.
text: They shake hands and walk on as we...
