speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Darkness. That's the first thing I
dialog: remember. It was dark, and it was
dialog: cold. And I was scared.
dialog: 
text: The silhouette of a body appears as it drifts into a ray of
text: light, refracted through water, which turns into...
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A MOON - SEEN IN REFLECTION ON A SHEET OF ICE
dialog: 
text: The moonlight intensifies almost magically, and the ice above
text: begins to spider-web and crack.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FROZEN POND - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Snow-covered trees in every direction. The ice in the pond
text: continues to crack, until finally a hole splinters open. A
text: young man floats out of the water, bathed in the intense
text: moonlight. This is JACK FROST - thin, pale, barefoot, his
text: tousled hair frosted white.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: But then...then I saw the moon. It
dialog: was so big and it was so bright,
dialog: and it seemed to chase the darkness
dialog: away. And when it did...I wasn't
dialog: scared anymore.
dialog: 
text: Jack floats back down onto the ice as the hole closes up
text: underneath him.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Why I was there, and what I was
dialog: meant to do - that I've never
dialog: known. And a part of me wonders if
dialog: I ever will.
dialog: 
text: Jack looks around, confused, then turns toward the moonlight
text: as it dims a bit.
dialog: 
text: Jack carefully treads across the ice until he hits something
text: with his feet. He looks down, and at his feet is a wooden
text: staff. Curious, he picks it up. Almost immediately the
text: staff begins to glow a cold blue in his hands. Odd.
scene_heading: Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Jack almost drops it as the base of the staff comes in
text: contact with the ground. Frost shoots out and spreads across
text: the ice. Jack is visibly confused.
dialog: 
text: He touches a few trees with his staff sending frost up their
text: trunks. Then he swings the staff again, more confident, as
text: he begins to run across the frozen pond.
dialog: 
text: Another swing, and a gust of wind swirls him high up into the
text: air. Jack floats for a moment only to fall back down to
text: earth and into the trees. Jack grabs hold of a tree branch
text: and pulls himself up to see a small town off in the distance.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BURGESS SETTLEMENT - TOWN CENTER - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: A collection of simple timber houses with thatched roofs.
text: Jack comes in for a landing, and it's a rocky one. He stands
text: up, still elated, and brushes himself off.
dialog: 
text: As Jack makes his way into town, settlers are warming their
text: hands by campfire. Jack doesn't recognize anyone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to the townsfolk)
dialog: Hello. Hello. Good evening,
dialog: ma'am.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Ma'am?
dialog: 
text: The settlers walk past Jack, not noticing him. Jack crouches
text: down as a YOUNG BOY runs toward him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, ah, excuse me, can you tell me
dialog: where I am?
dialog: 
text: The boy runs right through Jack, as if he were a ghost. Jack
text: staggers back in shock. He's speechless, as if the wind had
text: been knocked out him. His emotions causing it to snow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hello! Hello!
dialog: 
text: Townsfolk continue to pass through Jack, unaware of his
text: presence. Shaken, Jack turns and retreats into the forest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: My name is Jack Frost -- how do I
dialog: know that? The moon told me so.
dialog: But that was all he ever told me.
dialog: And that was a long, long time ago.

scene_heading: EXT. NORTH POLE - DUSK
dialog: 
text: FIERY GYPSY VIOLIN MUSIC as we move through clouds to reveal
text: a MASSIVE ICE CANYON, and just around a bend, the incredible
text: hidden fortress of NORTH, aka SANTA CLAUS.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NORTH'S WORKSHOP - DUSK
dialog: 
text: We glimpse a familiar-looking RED JACKET and CAP with white
text: trim on a coat hanger just as a pair of tongs SLAM a block of
text: ice onto a stone work table--
dialog: 
text: IN QUICK CUTS: A CHAINSAW shears the block in half, spraying
text: ice. North lifts up the chainsaw revealing a massive tatoo
text: on his arm, the word NAUGHTY clearly visible.
dialog: 
text: Three ELVES huddle in a doorway around a plate of cookies,
text: each licking their own tasty morsel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NORTH (O.S.)
dialog: Still waiting for cookies!
dialog: 
text: As North crosses the background, the elves lower the cookies
text: from their mouths, their faces frozen in fear.
dialog: 
text: The elves duck out of the way as North launches himself
text: across the floor on his rolling chair -- CLOSE as his huge
text: HAND gropes furiously among his WORK TOOLS, finally grabbing
text: a miniature HAMMER. As North's humming along with his music,
text: delicately CHISELING into the ice, we see a second arm sleeve
text: tatoo, the word NICE clearly visible--
dialog: 
text: His INTENSE BLUE EYE magnified in a JEWELER'S EYEPIECE -- a
text: delicate SCULPTING TOOL cuts fine details into the ice--
dialog: 
text: His hands place the finished piece on a curving ICE TRACK: An
text: ice LOCOMOTIVE. It belches ice vapor and chugs down the
dialog: track, picking up speed--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NORTH
dialog: Yes!
dialog: 
text: North's hand grabs a cookie from a plate held up by the two
dialog: Elves.
scene_heading: Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: One of the elves gives his cohort a look and points to the
text: plate as it chews with a mouth full of food, to which it then
text: unfurls its tongue and lets the half eaten morsels spill out
text: onto the plate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NORTH
dialog: Ah, finally!
dialog: 
text: He takes a bite and leans toward the ice track. He chuckles
text: as the train hits a loop, and launches off a ramp into midair
text: -- then WINGS unfold -- JET ENGINES sprout and ignite and the
text: train lifts off the track--
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, the DOOR is thrown open by one of North's concerned
text: YETIS, sending the flying ice locomotive skidding across the
text: floor in pieces.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YETI
dialog: Arghbal...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NORTH
dialog: Ach!
dialog: 
text: The yeti cries out covering his mouth in shame. North cries
text: out, devastated. The yeti, equally emotional, lets out
text: another whimper. North looks down at the broken toy and
text: takes a moment to collect himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NORTH
dialog: How many times have I told you to
dialog: knock?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YETI
dialog: Warga blarghgha!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NORTH
dialog: What...? The Globe?
dialog: 
text: North leaps up -- draws a HUGE SCIMITAR from its sheath and
speaker_heading: HEADS OUT--
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NORTH'S GLOBE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: A sea of tiny BELLS on the heads of panicking elves part as
text: North's huge boots stomp through.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NORTH
dialog: Shoo with your pointy heads. Why
dialog: are you always under boot?
dialog: 
text: He pushes his way past a couple of his YETI WORKERS --

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE GLOBE OF BELIEF
dialog: 
text: Covered with LIGHTS blanketing the continents. But North
text: notices that all at once, HUNDREDS OF LIGHTS suddenly go out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NORTH
dialog: What is this?
dialog: 
text: Now MORE LIGHTS, in GREATER NUMBERS, as if something is
text: snuffing them out by the thousands. North's concern grows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NORTH
speaker_heading: (TO YETI)
dialog: Have you checked the axis? Is
dialog: rotation balanced?

speaker_heading: YETI
speaker_heading: (SHRUGS SHOULDERS)
dialog: Wardle bawddrel.
dialog: 
text: Before the Yeti can finish, a WIND whips up from out of
text: nowhere -- North stares in outrage as a blanket of SWIRLING
text: BLACK SAND, crawls over the lights, and shrouds the ENTIRE
text: GLOBE in inky DARKNESS--
dialog: 
text: The elves scurry in a panic, then all at once the BLACK SAND
text: WHOOSHES UP off the Globe -- rushes up through the ceiling as
text: the remaining sand bursts into a puff of smoke and dissipates
dialog: into the air --
dialog: 
text: As the wind dies, the scattered pieces of debris settle to
text: the ground, and the globes lights come back on, North whirls
text: to see a HUGE SHADOW flash across the floors and curving
text: walls of his fortress. It quickly disappears, leaving
text: nothing but the distant ECHO of...LAUGHTER?
dialog: 
text: North is frozen, looking up into the darkness, gravely:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NORTH
dialog: Can it be?
dialog: (then calls off)
dialog: Dingle!
dialog: 
text: A group of elves step forward gleefully pointing to
text: themselves, as if they're all "Dingle". The excitement
text: quickly turns to confusion.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NORTH
dialog: Make preparations! We are going to
dialog: have company.
dialog: 
text: North reaches out for a large EMERGENCY LEVER, TWISTS and
speaker_heading: PRESSES IT--
scene_heading: Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The Globe pulses with ENERGY, which lights up and ZOOMS UP
text: the AXIS SHAFT toward the roof--
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NORTH POLE - CONTINUOUS

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOOTH (O.S.)
dialog: Wait!
dialog: 
text: And suddenly everything stops. Tooth whips around, and we
text: finally see her beautiful FACE.
scene_heading: Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She's holding up a little tooth, and gazing at it with dreamy
text: adoration. The surrounding fairies tweet with excitement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOOTH (CONT'D)
dialog: It's her first tooth. Have you
dialog: ever seen a more adorable lateral
dialog: incisor in all of your life?!
speaker_heading: (GASPS)
dialog: Look how she flossed!
dialog: 
text: The fairies' tweets turn to concern, turning Tooth's
text: attention to North's AURORA SIGNAL stretching across the sky.
text: She gasps, and flies off like a rocket toward the source of
text: the signal, accompanied by a few of her ranking fairies.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NORTH (V.O.)
dialog: My fellow Guardians - It is our job
dialog: to watch over the children of the
dialog: world, and keep them safe - to
dialog: bring wonder, hope and dreams.
dialog: And so, I've called us all here for
dialog: one reason, and one reason only -
text: the children are in danger.
dialog: 
dialog: Much of this we hear over the following...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT./INT. CHILD'S BEDROOM
dialog: 
text: We pull out from the face of a sleeping child to reveal a
text: stream of sand swirling overhead. It's a dream and it's taken
text: the shape of a child playing soccer.
dialog: 
text: We FOLLOW the Dreamsand stream out his window and up into the
text: sky where we see DOZENS of strands of sand descending to
text: earth. Keep following up, through majestic CLOUDS...
dialog: 
text: ...to reveal a small, GLOWING GOLDEN CLOUD of Dreamsand
text: shimmering among the clouds, trailing the golden threads.
dialog: 
text: The strands are being controlled by a small portly figure,
text: THE SANDMAN. Suddenly, North's emergency signal zips by. The
text: Sandman turns to look and his eyes narrow, visibly concerned.
dialog: 
text: Sandy closes his eyes and in an instant the Dreamsand cloud
text: suddenly SWIRLS around him, changing form into a small
text: BIPLANE, with Sandy in the cockpit. He BARREL ROLLS the
text: plane into a dizzying dive through the spectacular cloudscape
text: and flies off into the distance.

speaker_heading: NORTH (V.O.)
dialog: An enemy we have kept at bay for

scene_heading: INT. EGG TUNNEL
dialog: 
text: A few EASTER EGGS pop up out of the ground; their little legs
text: carry them out of the way of a fast approaching object.
dialog: 
text: Speeding along through a subterranean tunnel, we can barely
text: keep up with a DIMLY-LIT FIGURE as it races at blinding
text: speed, leaping and zigzagging through a series of TUNNELS --

scene_heading: EXT. A SNOWY EXPANSE IN THE NORTH POLE
dialog: 
text: A hole opens in the snow, and a pair of rabbit ears pops out.

text: The six foot tall figure is BUNNYMUND.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUNNYMUND
dialog: Ah, it's freezing.
dialog: 
text: He shivers with cold, then goes slogging through the snow.

speaker_heading: BUNNYMUND

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUNNYMUND (O.S.)
speaker_heading: (LAUGHS)
dialog: North, I, I don't have time for

dialog: could we concentrate on the matter--
dialog: 
text: Sandy can't take it anymore, grabs an elf by his hat, and
text: vigorously shakes it's bell. The other Guardians are finally
text: silenced and all turn to look at Sandy, who points up, a sand

text: away. Finally the others turn to see the shaft of moonlight
text: as it concentrates on the circle between them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NORTH
dialog: Aah! Man in Moon! Sandy, why
dialog: didn't you say something?
dialog:

speaker_heading: NORTH
dialog: (to Man in Moon)
dialog: It's been a long time old friend!
dialog: What is big news?
dialog: 
text: Everyone looks to the center of the intense spot of

dialog: 
text: -- which resolves into the shadowed silhouette of PITCH. The
text: Guardians look on, stunned.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUNNYMUND
dialog: It is Pitch.
dialog: 
text: North pats his belly and gives Bunny a look.

speaker_heading: NORTH
dialog: (back up to the moon)
dialog: Manny...what must we do?
scene_heading: Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 13.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: In answer, the shadow of Pitch disappears and the circle of
text: moonlight intensifies and SHRINKS, concentrating further

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOOTH
dialog: Ah, guys, you know what this means?

text: A mail man walks across the street and a PATCH OF ICE

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Hey wind...
dialog:

text: smiling as the wind blows past.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Take me home!
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. FROZEN POND

speaker_heading: this is JAMIE.

dialog:

dialog: 
text: He then puckers his lips, and blows onto it with his icy

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SNOWY HILL
dialog: 
text: WHOOSH! - the snowball goes flying through the air and -

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAMIE
speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: Okay, who threw that?
dialog: 
text: Jack flies in and lands amongst the group of kids.

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, wasn't bigfoot kiddo.
dialog: 
text: Jamie scans the horizon for the culprit. His eyes land on a

dialog: 
text: MONTY (oddball with big glasses) with his back turned

speaker_heading: (WALLA)

dialog:

dialog: There's traffic!
dialog: 
text: Jamie suddenly shoots out between the trees and careens past
text: a set of parked cars.
dialog: 
text: Jack's path of ice covers the street. As Jamie turns, his
text: speed only escalates, sending him directly into traffic.
text: Jamie barely misses a moving truck, spinning it out of
text: control, sending furniture out the back, and causing a four
text: car pile up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Whoa!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK

dialog: 
text: Jamie flies off the sidewalk and back into the middle of the
text: street, almost knocking over a postman. As Jack flies by
text: Jamie's side he sees the look of excitement come into Jamie's
text: face. Jack smiles, knowing he's responsible.
dialog: 
text: Jack sees an oncoming snowplow and quickly jumps ahead,
text: carried by the wind, to divert the ice trail.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Whoa.

speaker_heading: AAAAHHHHHHHH!
dialog: 
text: Jamie closes his eyes as the ramp launches Jamie over the

text: awe, mouths wide open, as he sails through the air.
dialog:

dialog: If there's something I'm doing

text: on his lips.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Right on time, Sandman.
dialog: 
text: The Dreamsand descends from the sky, and drifts into windows

speaker_heading: NORTH

dialog: 
text: Jack looks down to find an elf pointing at his bare feet.
text: The elf then directs his attention to two approaching elves,
text: carrying a pair of ceremonial boots. Jack's confusion
text: escalates.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Huh?
dialog: 
text: A Yeti hands North an old large book. North blows off the

text: continue to fawn, Sandy's smiling, Bunny's apathetic, and
text: North looks on with pride.
dialog: 
text: Jack suddenly SLAMS his staff down, sending a blast of FROST

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What makes you think I want to be a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Look, this is all very flattering,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NORTH
dialog: Very nice! Keep up good work!
dialog:

speaker_heading: (TO YETI)
dialog: I don't like it. Paint it red.

dialog: 
text: North dusts his hands and turns to Jack. His sleeves are
text: rolled. Jack notices that on one of North's forearms is
text: tattooed the word NAUGHTY, and on the other, NICE. North
text: grabs a plate from a nearby elf.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NORTH
dialog: Fruit cake?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Ah, no, thanks.

dialog: Now we get down to tacks of brass!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: (TO HIMSELF)
dialog: Tacks of brass?
dialog: 
text: As North cracks his knuckles, Jack stands silent. The wind

text: to the door, it locks itself, and he turns back. North moves
text: in close to Jack, backing him up against the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NORTH
dialog: Who are you, Jack Frost? What is
dialog: your center?
dialog: 
text: North pokes Jack in the chest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: My center?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NORTH
dialog: If Man in Moon chose you to be a
dialog: Guardian, you must have something
dialog: very special inside.
dialog: 
text: North stands up straight and begins to stroke his beard as he
text: gives Jack a curious look.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NORTH
dialog: Hmmmm?
dialog: 
text: North is standing in front of a shelf of Russian nesting
text: dolls. One is carved to look like North himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NORTH (CONT'D)
dialog: Here. This is how you see me, no?
dialog: Very big, intimidating. But if you
dialog: get to know me a little--
dialog: (hands the doll to Jack)
dialog: Well, go on.
dialog: 
text: Jack gives North a curious look, then sets down his staff.
text: He twists the doll in half, and inside is another carved
text: North doll, this one is a more typical Santa Claus - red
text: cheeked and cheery.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You are downright jolly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NORTH
dialog: Ah, but not just jolly...

dialog: I am also mysterious.
dialog: (twist - smaller doll)
dialog: And fearless.
dialog: (twist - smaller doll)

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: There's a tiny wooden baby?

speaker_heading: NORTH

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You have big eyes?

dialog: my center. It is what I was born
dialog: with. Eyes that have always seen
dialog: the wonder in everything!
dialog: 
text: North raises his hands, and the toys on the shelves suddenly
text: spring to life. Jack-in-the-boxes pop, toy trains speed
text: around the room, soldiers march about, toy planes fly
text: overhead. An elf gets carried aloft by a balloon.
dialog: 
text: A flying toy plane glides by and we follow it as it makes its
text: way around the room. A Christmas tree is ablaze with bright
text: lights. Two double doors suddenly open as the flying car
text: enters the factory floor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NORTH
text: Eyes that see lights in the trees,
dialog: and magic in the air!
