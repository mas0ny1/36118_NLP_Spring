scene_heading: IN BLACK --
text: We hear the feral, primeval sounds of a jungle at night. A
text: timpani bangs an ominous beat.
scene_heading: FADE IN ON:
scene_heading: A JUNGLE - NIGHT
text: A BUNNY nervously walks through the dark, foreboding forest,
text: frightened by every shadow and moving leaf.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY (V.O.)
dialog: Fear. Treachery. Bloodlust!
dialog: Thousands of years ago, these were
dialog: the forces that ruled our world. A
dialog: world where prey were scared of
dialog: predators. And predators had an
dialog: uncontrollable biological urge to
dialog: maim and maul and...
text: The timpani crescendos. A JAGUAR leaps out of the shadows,
text: attacks the bunny, who screams--
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INSIDE A BARN - A JUNGLE (SET) - NIGHT
text: The action continues-- as imagined by an amateur stage
dialog: production.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY
dialog: Blood, blood, blood!
text: Reams of red papier mâché entrails ooze from the bunny. And
text: when those run out-- projectile ketchup.
text: Reveal: These are ANIMAL KID ACTORS. The bunny, JUDY HOPPS,
text: 10, is our hero. And this is her play being staged. A banner
text: reads: CARROT DAYS TALENT SHOW!
speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)
dialog: And death.
text: The CROWD looks on, confused. The music goes discordant as
text: BOBBY CATMULL, a bobcat, bangs a drum.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Back then, the world was divided in
text: two. Vicious predator or Meek prey.
dialog: 2.
text: TWO BOXES drop down, labeled VICIOUS PREDATOR and MEEK PREY.
text: The PREDATOR box lands on the jaguar. The MEEK PREY box lands
text: on Judy. Her entrails get stuck outside the box. She drags
text: them underneath with her.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: But over time, we evolved, and
dialog: moved beyond our primitive savage
dialog: ways.
text: A YOUNG SHEEP wearing a white muumuu and a cardboard rainbow
text: on his head does an improvisational dance across the stage.
text: Judy and the jaguar burst out of their boxes, now wearing
text: white muumuus, too.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, predator and prey live in
dialog: harmony.
text: Judy and the jaguar shake hands as the sheep throws glitter.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)
dialog: And every young mammal has
dialog: multitudinous opportunities.
speaker_heading: ASTRONAUT SHEEP
dialog: Yeah, I don't have to cower in a
dialog: herd anymore.
text: The Jaguar rips off his muumuu. She's wearing a homemade
text: astronaut costume.
speaker_heading: ASTRONAUT SHEEP (CONT'D)
dialog: Instead I can be an astronaut.
text: Catmull plays a slide whistle.
speaker_heading: ACTUARY JAGUAR
dialog: I don't have to be a lonely hunter
dialog: any more.
text: The Jaguar rips off his muumuu. He's dressed in a suit.
speaker_heading: ACTUARY
dialog: Today I can hunt for tax
dialog: exemptions. I'm gonna be an
dialog: actuary!
speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY
dialog: And I can make the world a better
dialog: place! I am going to be...
text: Catmull plays a 70s-style cop show theme on the boom box.
text: Judy rips off her muumuu, revealing a POLICE OFFICER UNIFORM.
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)
dialog: A police officer!
text: Judy's parents, BONNIE &amp; STU, look stunned. A mean fox kid,
text: GIDEON GREY, snickers. He's sitting next to a WEASEL KID.
speaker_heading: GIDEON GREY
dialog: Bunny cop. That is the most
dialog: stupidest thing I ever heard.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY
dialog: It may seem impossible to small
dialog: minds--
dialog: (points at Gideon)
dialog: I'm looking at you Gideon Grey.
text: Catmull drops down a backdrop showing a bright city skyline.
text: He hits play on an uplifting song.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)
text: But just 211 miles away stands the
dialog: great city of Zootopia! Where our
dialog: ancestors first joined together in
dialog: peace, and declared that anyone can
dialog: be anything! Thank you and good
dialog: night!
text: Judy gives a mighty thespian bow, to the sound of Catmull on
text: organ. The audience applauds. Judy's parents look concerned.
scene_heading: EXT. CARROT DAYS FESTIVAL - LATER THAT DAY
text: A festival replete with food booths, games and rides-- all
text: aggressively carrot-themed. Judy, in her Cop Costume, bounces
text: along with her folks. We catch their conversation mid-stream.
speaker_heading: STU HOPPS
dialog: Judy, you ever wonder how your mom
dialog: and me got to be so darn happy?
speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: STU HOPPS
dialog: Well, we gave up on our dreams and
dialog: we settled, right Bon?
speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS
dialog: Oh yes, that's right, Stu. We
dialog: settled hard.
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: STU HOPPS
dialog: See, that's the beauty of
dialog: complacency, Jude. If you don't try
dialog: anything new, you'll never fail.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY
dialog: I like trying, actually.
speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS
dialog: What your father means, hon, is
dialog: it's gonna be difficult--
dialog: impossible even-- for you to become
text: a police officer.
speaker_heading: STU HOPPS
dialog: Right. There's never been a bunny
dialog: cop.
speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: STU HOPPS
dialog: Bunnies don't do that.
speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS
dialog: Never.
speaker_heading: STU HOPPS
dialog: Never.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY
dialog: Oh. Then I guess I'll have to be
dialog: the first one. Because I am gonna
dialog: make the world...
dialog: (parkours against a
dialog: vendor's stand)
dialog: A better place!
speaker_heading: STU HOPPS
dialog: OR... um, heck, you wanna talk
dialog: about making the world a better
dialog: place--
text: The trio arrives at the Hopps Family Farm carrot booth, which
text: is manned by too many children to count.
speaker_heading: STU HOPPS (CONT'D)
dialog: --no better way to do it than
text: becoming a carrot farmer.
speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS
dialog: Yes! Your dad, me, your 275
dialog: brothers and sisters-- we're
dialog: changing the world.
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: STU HOPPS
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS
dialog: One carrot at a time...
speaker_heading: STU HOPPS
dialog: Amen to that. Carrot farming is a
dialog: noble profession.
text: Judy spots GIDEON GREY stalking some SMALL ANIMALS. She
text: remains fixed on Gideon as Stu and Bonnie yap on obliviously.
speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS (O.S.)
dialog: Mmm hmm. Just putting the seeds in
dialog: the ground.
speaker_heading: STU HOPPS (O.S.)
dialog: Ahh, at one with the soil.
text: We're back on Bonnie and Stu's conversation now.
speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS
dialog: You get it. I mean, it's great to
dialog: have dreams.
speaker_heading: STU HOPPS
dialog: Yeah, just as long as you don't
dialog: believe in em too much.
text: (finally noticing Judy's
dialog: absence)
dialog: Where in the heck'd she go?
text: ACROSS THE FAIR... From behind a tree, Judy watches as Gideon
text: Grey intimidates the astronaut sheep, SHARLA.
speaker_heading: GIDEON GREY
dialog: Gimme your tickets right now, or
dialog: I'm gonna kick your meek little
text: sheep butt.
speaker_heading: SHARLA
dialog: Ow! Cut it out, Gideon!
speaker_heading: GIDEON GREY
dialog: Baa-baa. What're ya gonna do, cry?
text: Gideon swipes Sharla's fair tickets.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY (O.S.)
dialog: Hey!
text: Judy charges toward the danger.
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)
dialog: You heard her. Cut it out.
text: Gideon turns. There's Judy, projecting the image of a tiny
dialog: Clint Eastwood.
speaker_heading: GIDEON GREY
dialog: Nice costume, loser. What crazy
dialog: world are you living in where you
dialog: think a bunny could be a cop?
speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY
dialog: Kindly return my friends' tickets.
text: Gideon pats the tickets in his pocket.
speaker_heading: GIDEON GREY
dialog: Come and get `em.... But watch out,
dialog: `cause I'm a fox-- and like you
dialog: said in your dumb little stage
dialog: play, us predators used to eat
dialog: prey. And that killer instinct's
dialog: still in our Dunnahh.
scene_heading: TRAVIS THE WOLF HENCHMAN KID
dialog: (sotto, to Gideon)
dialog: Uh, I'm pretty much sure it's
dialog: pronounced D-N-A.
speaker_heading: GIDEON GREY
dialog: Don't tell me what I know, Travis.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY
dialog: You don't scare me, Gideon.
text: Gideon shoves Judy. Hard. She falls. The other prey animals
text: flee to safety behind a nearby tree, leaving her to face the
text: thugs alone.
speaker_heading: GIDEON GREY
dialog: You scared now?
text: Judy starts to tear up. Her nose starts to twitch.
scene_heading: TRAVIS THE WOLF HENCHMAN KID
text: Lookit her nose twitch. She is
dialog: scared!
speaker_heading: GIDEON GREY
dialog: Cry little baby bunny. Cry, cry --
text: Suddenly-- BAM! Judy kicks Gideon in the face with her hind
text: legs. He stumbles back, then checks his lip for blood.
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: GIDEON GREY (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, you don't know when to quit, do
dialog: ya?
text: He unsheathes his claws like a switchblade, then slaps her,
text: drawing blood from her cheek. She cowers, as do her scared
text: friends behind the tree.
speaker_heading: GIDEON GREY (CONT'D)
dialog: I want you to remember this moment--
dialog: the next time you think you will
dialog: ever be anything more than just a
dialog: stupid, carrot farming dumb bunny.
text: Gideon and his pal head off, laughing and high-fiving. The
text: prey animals run back over to Judy, who wipes the blood from
text: her cheek. She fights tears, defeated.
scene_heading: GARETH THE DOUBTING SHEEP BOY
dialog: That looks bad.
speaker_heading: SHARLA
dialog: Are you okay, Judy?
speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY
dialog: Yeah... Yeah, I'm okay.
text: Judy smiles and then whips out the tickets as she gets up.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Here you go.
speaker_heading: SHARLA
dialog: Wow! You got our tickets!
scene_heading: GARETH THE DOUBTING SHEEP BOY
dialog: You're awesome, Judy!
speaker_heading: SHARLA
dialog: Yeah! That Gideon Grey doesn't know
dialog: what he's talkin' `bout.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY
dialog: Well, he was right about one
dialog: thing...
text: Judy picks up the cop hat, puts it on her head.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't know when to quit.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 8.
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE ACADEMY TRAINING FACILITY - DAY
text: Hopps and the comparatively huge CADETS sit in a circle as

speaker_heading: MAJOR FRIEDKIN
dialog: Listen up Cadets! Zootopia has 12
dialog: unique ecosystems within its city
dialog: limits-- Tundra Town, Sahara

dialog: face!
scene_heading: TUNDRA TOWN ICE WALL:

scene_heading: THREE QUICK CUTS OF FAILURE:
speaker_heading: MAJOR FRIEDKIN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Dead! / Dead! / Dead!
text: IN THE TOILET:
text: Hopps ruses into a stall. The toilet is considerably larger
text: than she is. She shuts the door. We see her climb up the
text: toilet. In the next stall, we see the feet of a Hippo.
text: Then, KERSPLASH! Hopps falls into the toilet.
speaker_heading: MAJOR FRIEDKIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Filthy toilet. You're dead, fluff
dialog: butt!
scene_heading: HOPPS ON HER OWN--
text: She runs at sunset-- after everyone else has called it a day.
text: We HEAR the drill instructor's voice echoing in her mind.
speaker_heading: MAJOR FRIEDKIN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Just quit and go home, fuzzy bunny!
dialog: Then those of her parents...
speaker_heading: STU HOPPS (V.O.)
dialog: There's never been a bunny cop.
speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS (V.O.)
dialog: Never.
speaker_heading: STU HOPPS (V.O.)

speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Guys-- I've been working for this
dialog: my whole life.
speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS
dialog: We know. And we're just a little
dialog: excited for you, but terrified.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: The only thing we have to fear is
dialog: fear itself.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: STU HOPPS
dialog: And also bears. We have bears to
dialog: fear, too. To say nothing of lions,
dialog: and wolves...
speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS
dialog: Wolves?
speaker_heading: STU HOPPS
dialog: ...weasels...
speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS
dialog: You play cribbage with a weasel.
speaker_heading: STU HOPPS
dialog: And he cheats like there's no
dialog: tomorrow. You know what, pretty
dialog: much all predators-- and Zootopia's
dialog: full of `em.
speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS
dialog: (scolding)
dialog: Oh, Stu.
speaker_heading: STU HOPPS
dialog: And foxes are the worst.
speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS
dialog: (retreating)
dialog: Actually, your father does have a
dialog: point there. It's in their biology.
dialog: Remember what happened with Gideon
dialog: Grey.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: When I was 9. Gideon Grey was a
dialog: jerk, who happened to be a fox. I
dialog: know plenty of bunnies who are
dialog: jerks.
speaker_heading: STU HOPPS
dialog: Sure. Yeah, we all do. Absolutely.
dialog: But just in case, we made you a
dialog: little care package to take with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS
dialog: And I put some snacks in there.
text: Stu begins pulling a bunch of PINK FOX DETERRENTS from a bag.
speaker_heading: STU HOPPS
dialog: This is fox deterrent.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS
dialog: Yeah that's safe to have there.
speaker_heading: STU HOPPS
dialog: This is fox repellent...
speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS
dialog: Okay, the deterrent and the
dialog: repellent. That's all she needs.
speaker_heading: STU HOPPS
dialog: Check this out!
text: Stu removes a Fox Taser, fires it up. It sizzles.
speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS
dialog: Oh for goodness sake. She has no
dialog: need for a fox taser, Stu.
speaker_heading: STU HOPPS
dialog: Oh c'mon. When is there not a need
dialog: for a fox taser?
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Okay, look-- I will take this to

speaker_heading: TRAIN CONDUCTOR
dialog: Arriving-- Zootopia Express!
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: OK. Gotta go. Bye!
text: Judy heads for the train, head held high. No turning back.
text: Stu and Bonnie watch, both holding back tears. Suddenly, the
text: emotion catches up with Judy. She turns, runs back to her
text: parents, hugs them tight.
speaker_heading: JUDY (CONT'D)
dialog: I love you guys.
speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS
dialog: Love you, too!
text: One more squeeze, then Judy runs off and jumps on the train.

speaker_heading: STU HOPPS
dialog: Oh cripes, here come the

speaker_heading: JUDY

scene_heading: CROWD OF BUNNIES
dialog: Bye!
text: As the train pulls away, her family runs next to it, waving.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Bye!
text: Judy looks back as their faces recede into the distance. The

text: Judy pulls out her iPhone and clicks play... her new life is
dialog: about to begin and we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: A MONTAGE --
text: As Hopps takes the train, it rounds a curve. She looks up.
text: Her eyes light up. There in the distance is...
scene_heading: EXT. ZOOTOPIA CITY - ESTABLISHING
text: ...THE UNBELIEVABLE ANIMAL METROPOLIS of ZOOTOPIA, which is
text: comprised of amazing habitat "boroughs." The train whips past
scene_heading: TUNDRATOWN, SAVANNA CENTRAL, RAINFOREST DISTRICT,

speaker_heading: HOPPS (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh hi, I'm Judy! Your new neighbor!
speaker_heading: KUDU POOTOSSER
dialog: Yeah? Well we're loud.
speaker_heading: ORYX POOTOSSER
dialog: Don't expect us to apologize for
dialog: it.
text: Before Hopps can respond, they're gone, leaving Hopps alone.
text: She looks around... blank-faced so it's tough to read her
dialog: emotions.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
text: Greasy walls... rickety bed...
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: KUDU POOTOSSER (O.S.)

speaker_heading: ORYX POOTOSSER (O.S.)

scene_heading: WAKE UP MONTAGE - MORNING
text: Quick, rhythmic cuts of:

dialog: - Dressing: Vest. Badge. Belt.
text: On the bedside table sits the PINK FOX REPELLENT. Judy

scene_heading: INT. ZOOTOPIA POLICE DEPARTMENT - MORNING

speaker_heading: CLAWHAUSER (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: (a little wince)
dialog: Ooo, uh, you probably didn't know,
dialog: but a bunny can call another bunny

dialog: it, it's a little...
speaker_heading: CLAWHAUSER

dialog: Number two: There are some new
dialog: recruits with us I should
dialog: introduce. But I'm not going to,
dialog: because I don't care. Finally...
text: He turns to a push pin-pocked MAP that's covered in photos of
text: MISSING MAMMALS. Hopps's eyes go wide.
speaker_heading: BOGO (CONT'D)
dialog: ...We have 14 missing mammal cases.
dialog: All predators, from a giant polar
text: bear, to a teensy little otter. And
dialog: City Hall is right up my tail to
dialog: find them. This is priority number
dialog: one. Assignments!
text: HIGGINS hands Bogo a stack of CASE FILES. Bogo puts on his
text: reading glasses, examining the files as he assigns cases.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: BOGO (CONT'D)
dialog: Officers Grizzoli, Fangmeyer,
dialog: Delgato-- your teams take Missing
text: Mammals from the Rainforest
dialog: District. Officers McHorn,
dialog: Rhinowitz, Wolfard, your teams take
dialog: Sahara Square. Officers Higgins,
dialog: Snarlov, Trunkaby: Tundratown. And
dialog: finally, our first bunny, Officer
dialog: Hopps.
text: Hopps sits up, expectant but steely. Bogo looks at the final
text: case file in his hand. He takes a dramatic breath, then:
speaker_heading: BOGO (CONT'D)
dialog: Parking Duty. Dismissed!
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Parking duty?
dialog: (runs after Bogo)
dialog: Uh, Chief? Chief Bogo?
text: Bogo looks around... then down to find Hopps.
speaker_heading: HOPPS (CONT'D)
dialog: Sir, you said there were 14 missing
dialog: mammal cases?
speaker_heading: BOGO
dialog: So.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: So I can handle one. You probably
dialog: forgot, but I was top of my class
dialog: at the academy.
speaker_heading: BOGO
dialog: Didn't forget. Just don't care.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Sir, I'm not just some "token"
text: bunny.
speaker_heading: BOGO
dialog: Well, then writing a hundred
dialog: tickets a day should be easy.
text: He goes, slamming the door behind him. Judy stomps her foot.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: 100 tickets...? I'm not gonna write
dialog: 100 tickets... I'm gonna write 200
dialog: tickets!
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: HOPPS (CONT'D)
dialog: (then, to the closed door)
dialog: Before noon!
scene_heading: INT. / EXT. METER MAID CART - DAY
text: Hopps dons a vest, buckles her seat belt, floors the pedal
text: and... takes off at 2 miles an hour. Which leads to a
scene_heading: PARKING METER MONTAGE --
text: Hopps zooms past a row of cars, marking their tires. Cruising
text: the streets, her super-sensitive ears hear a meter ding. She
text: slams her brakes-- then proudly issues Ticket #1.
text: Ding! Another meter goes off. Then another. And another.
text: She's on a roll. She looks down at her counter. It's at 200.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Boom! 200 tickets before noon.
text: A final ding... Reveal: her own traffic cart is at an expired
text: meter. Hopps rolls her eyes and writes herself a ticket.
speaker_heading: HOPPS (CONT'D)
dialog: 201.
text: As Hopps puts the ticket on her windshield, she hears a voice
text: across the street:
speaker_heading: TRUCK DRIVER (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, watch where you're going, Fox!
text: Hopps looks across the street to see... a RED FOX. Hopps
text: looks at him, a little suspicious.
text: The Fox looks around, then slinks into a café. Hopps runs
text: across the street and peeks in the window. It's an ice cream
dialog: parlor, but... the FOX IS GONE.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Where'd he go...
scene_heading: INT. JUMBEAUX'S CAFE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Elephants scoop ice cream with their trunks, suck up nuts
text: with their trunks. It's cute but also disgusting. As Hopps
text: enters, she spots the fox, NICK WILDE, at the front of the
text: line and overhears the proprietor, JERRY, addressing him.
dialog: 21.
scene_heading: JERRY JUMBEAUX, JR.
dialog: Listen, I don't know what you're
text: doing skulking around during
dialog: daylight hours, but I don't want
dialog: any trouble in here... So hit the
dialog: road.
text: Hopps unsnaps the holster of her PINK FOX REPELLENT.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I'm not looking for any trouble
dialog: either, sir. I simply want to buy a
dialog: Jumbo Pop for my little boy.
text: Ready for action, slowly creeping forward, Hopps's expression
text: changes when she sees that Nick is with his TODDLER SON.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: (to the boy)
dialog: You want the red or the blue, pal?
text: Staring at the cute little boy, Hopps is embarrassed by her
text: impulse. She snaps the Repellent holster and begins to leave.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: (disgusted with herself)
dialog: I'm such a...
scene_heading: JERRY JUMBEAUX, JR.
dialog: Oh come on, kid. Back up. Listen,
dialog: buddy, what? There aren't any fox
dialog: ice cream joints in your part of
dialog: town?
text: Hopps suddenly stops. Her ears go up and she turns around.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Uh, no no, there are. There are.
dialog: It's just, my boy--
dialog: (tousles boy's hair)
dialog: --this goofy little stinker-- he
dialog: loves all things elephant. Wants to
dialog: be one when he grows up.
text: The boy gives a TOOT-TOOT with his toy elephant trunk.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Isn't it adorable? Who the heck am
dialog: I to crush his little dreams, huh?
dialog: Right?
scene_heading: JERRY JUMBEAUX, JR.
dialog: Look, you probably can't read, fox
dialog: but the sign says...
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 22.
scene_heading: JERRY JUMBEAUX, JR. (CONT'D)
text: (slowly reads SIGN,

speaker_heading: ELEPHANT
dialog: You're holding up the line.
text: The little fox is about to cry, when Hopps walks up.
speaker_heading: HOPPS (O.S.)
dialog: Hello? Excuse me?
scene_heading: JERRY JUMBEAUX, JR.
dialog: Hey, you're gonna have to wait your
dialog: turn like everyone else, metermaid.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Actually...
dialog: (revealing badge)
dialog: I'm an officer. Just had a quick
dialog: question. Are your customers aware
text: they're getting snot and mucous
dialog: with their cookies and cream?
text: An ELEPHANT COUPLE overhear and spit out their ice cream.
scene_heading: JERRY JUMBEAUX, JR.
dialog: What are you talkin' about?
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Well, I don't wanna cause you any
dialog: trouble, but I believe scooping ice
text: cream with an un-gloved trunk is a
dialog: Class 3 Health Code Violation...
text: A guilty EMPLOYEE releases a scoop from their trunk.
speaker_heading: HOPPS (CONT'D)
dialog: ...Which is kind of a big deal. Of
dialog: course-- I could let you off with a
dialog: warning if you were to glove those
dialog: trunks and, I don't know, finish
dialog: selling this nice dad and his son
dialog: a... what was it?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: A Jumbo Pop. Please.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: A Jumbo Pop.
dialog: 23.
scene_heading: JERRY JUMBEAUX, JR.
dialog: (stews for a beat, then)
dialog: Fifteen dollars.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Thank you so much.
dialog: (to Hopps)
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (then, digs for wallet)
dialog: Oh no, are you kidding me? I don't
dialog: have my wallet. I'd lose my head if
dialog: it weren't attached to my neck,
dialog: that's the truth. Oh boy, I'm sorry
dialog: pal. Gotta be about the worst
dialog: birthday ever. Please don't be mad
dialog: at me.
dialog: (kisses him, to Hopps)
dialog: Thanks, anyway.
text: He turns to go. Hopps slaps some money on the counter.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Keep the change.
scene_heading: EXT. JUMBEAUX'S CAFE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Hopps has the Toddler's hand. Nick holds a HUGE JUMBO-POP.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Officer, I can't thank you enough.
dialog: So kind, really, can I pay you
dialog: back?
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Oh no, my treat-- it just-- y'know,
dialog: it burns me up to see folks with
dialog: such backward attitudes toward
dialog: foxes. I just wanna say, you're a
dialog: great dad and just a... a real
dialog: articulate fella.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Ah, well, that is high praise. It's
dialog: rare that I find someone so non-
dialog: patronizing... Officer...
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: (totally misses his dig)
dialog: Hopps. Mr...
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Wilde. Nick Wilde.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: (to Toddler)
dialog: And you little guy, you want to be
dialog: an elephant when you grow up... you
dialog: be an elephant-- because this is
dialog: Zootopia, anyone can be anything.
text: Hopps puts a STICKER BADGE on the boy's chest.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Ah, boy, I tell him that all the
dialog: time. All right here ya go--
dialog: (hands him popsicle)
dialog: Two paws. Yeah. Oh, look at that
dialog: smile, that's a happy birthday
dialog: smile! All right, give her a little

text: The kid toots.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Toot, toot!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Bye now!
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Goodbye!
text: Hopps walks off with a spring in her step.
scene_heading: EXT. SAHARA SQUARE - DAY
text: Hopps continues to write tickets. As she leaves a ticket on
text: another car, she can see a few blocks away. It's NICK and his
text: KID. Hopps gives them a wave, but they don't notice her.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Oh! Hey, little toot toot--
text: Hopps realizes they are melting their jumbo-pop in the hot
text: sun, channeling the juice into jugs. Huh? Nick and his kid
text: pack the jugs into a van and NICK'S SON gets in the driver's
text: seat. They drive off, passing Hopps, who stares, confused.
scene_heading: EXT. TUNDRATOWN - A LITTLE LATER
text: Hopps follows them to... Tundratown, where Nick's "son" uses
text: his little paw prints to create molds they pour the popsicle
text: juice into, creating dozens of smaller popsicles. Hopps looks
text: on, scandalized.
dialog: 25.
scene_heading: EXT. SAVANNAH CENTRAL - A LITTLE LATER
text: Hopps watches them resell the "Pawpsicles" at marked-up
text: prices to LEMMINGS... when one buys one, they all do.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Pawpsicles! Get your pawpsicles!
text: Nick rakes in the cash. As the lemmings leave, they throw
text: their used popsicle sticks into a RECYCLING BIN. A second
text: later, Nick's "son," FINNICK, emerges from the bin with a
text: bundle of used popsicle sticks. Hopps is mortified.
scene_heading: EXT. LITTLE RODENTIA - A LITTLE LATER
text: Hopps watches Nick plop down a big bundle of USED POPSICLE
text: STICKS in front of a MOUSE CONSTRUCTION WORKER.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Lumber delivery!
scene_heading: MOUSE CONSTRUCTION WORKER
dialog: What's with the color?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: The color? Uh... It's redwood.
text: Hopps has now graduated to genuine anger.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE LITTLE RODENTIA - MOMENTS LATER
text: Nick hands Finnick a wad of cash.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: 39...40. There you go. Way to work
dialog: that diaper, big guy. Hey, no kiss
dialog: bye-bye for daddy?
speaker_heading: FINNICK
dialog: (super-deep voice)
dialog: You kiss me tomorrow, I'll bite
dialog: your face off. Ciao.
text: As Finnick drives off in his van, BLARING LOUD FRENCH RAP
text: MUSIC. We discover HOPPS behind it, and she is not happy.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Well. I stood up for you, and you
dialog: lied to me. You liar!
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: It's called a hustle, sweetheart.
dialog: And I'm not the liar, he is.
text: Nick points behind Hopps. She turns... no one. She turns
text: back. Nick is gone-- his tail disappears around a corner.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Hey!
text: Nick walks on, calmly. Hopps hurries up to him.
speaker_heading: HOPPS (CONT'D)
dialog: Alright, slick Nick, you're under
dialog: arrest.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Really, for what?
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Gee I don't know, how `bout selling
dialog: food without a permit, transporting
dialog: undeclared commerce across borough
dialog: lines, false advertising...
text: Nick smiles and produces those documents.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Permit. Receipt of declared
dialog: commerce. And I didn't falsely
dialog: advertise anything. Take care.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: You told that mouse the popsicle
dialog: sticks were redwood!
speaker_heading: NICK
text: That's right. "Red wood." With a
text: space in the middle. Wood that is
dialog: red.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You can't touch me, Carrots, I been
dialog: doing this since I was born.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: You're gonna wanna refrain from
dialog: calling me Carrots...
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: My bad. I just naturally assumed
dialog: you came from some little carrot-
dialog: choked podunk, no?
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: (isn't it obvious?)
dialog: Ah, no. Podunk is in Deerbrooke
dialog: County, and I grew up in
dialog: Bunnyburrow.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Okay. Tell me if this story sounds
dialog: familiar:
dialog: (harsher now, rapidly)
dialog: Naïve little hick with good grades
dialog: and big ideas decides, "Hey lookit
dialog: me, I'm gonna move to Zootopia--
text: where Predators and Prey live in
dialog: harmony and sing Kumbaya!" Only to
dialog: find-- whoopsie, we don't all get
dialog: along. And that dream of becoming a
dialog: big city cop? Double whoopsie!
dialog: She's a meter maid. And whoopsie
dialog: number threesie-- NO ONE cares
dialog: about her or her dreams. And soon
dialog: enough those dreams die and our
text: bunny sinks into emotional and
text: literal squalor living in a box
text: under a bridge. Til finally she has
dialog: no choice but to go back home with
dialog: that cute, fuzzy wuzzy little tail
dialog: between her legs to become-- you're
dialog: from Bunnyburrow, is that what you
dialog: said?-- so how `bout a carrot
dialog: farmer... That sound about right?
text: She's speechless-- How did he get my number so quickly? A
text: RHINO almost crushes her.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Be careful now, it won't just be
dialog: your dreams getting crushed.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: (ever-so-slightly rattled)
dialog: Hey! Hey! No one tells me what I
dialog: can or can't be! Especially not
dialog: some jerk who never had the guts to
dialog: try to be anything more than a
dialog: popsicle hustler!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Alright look, everyone comes to
dialog: Zootopia thinking they can be
dialog: anything they want. Well you can't.
dialog: You can only be what you are.

text: Dumb bunny.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: I am NOT a dumb bunny.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Right. And that's not wet cement.
text: She looks down. She's landed in wet cement.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: (as he goes)
dialog: You'll never be a real cop. You're
dialog: a cute meter maid though. Maybe a
dialog: supervisor one day. Hang in
dialog: there...
scene_heading: INT. HOPPS'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - EVENING
text: CLOSE ON HER WELCOME MAT: Hopps wipes off her cement covered
text: feet. Then she enters
scene_heading: THE APARTMENT --
text: Hopps turns on the radio. Everybody Hurts plays. She changes
text: the station. A sadder song comes on. She changes the station
text: repeatedly, each song progressively sadder. Finally, she
text: lands on a treacly instrumental that will score the scene.
text: She puts in a microwave dinner: CARROTS FOR ONE. Hopps takes
text: her food (A SINGLE CARROT) and sits at a small table.
text: Her phone rings. INSERT: MOM &amp; DAD FACETIME. Hopps shakes her
text: head, sighs, then puts on a fake smile and answers.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Oh hey, it's my parents!
speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS
dialog: Aw there she is! Hi sweetheart!
text: THE FACETIME cuts between Bonnie on her phone. Stu will pop

speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: It was real great.

speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS

dialog: Oh my sweet heaven-- Judy, are you
dialog: a meter maid?
text: Hopps is still wearing her vest, and her hat is on the chair.
speaker_heading: HOPPS

dialog: Oh this? No! Oh, no no! This is
dialog: just a temporary thing--
speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS
dialog: It's the safest job on the force!
speaker_heading: STU HOPPS

speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS

speaker_heading: HOPPS

speaker_heading: ORYX POOTOSSER (O.S.)
dialog: Hey Bunny! Turn down that
dialog: depressing music!
speaker_heading: KUDU POOTOSSER (O.S.)
dialog: Leave the meter maid alone! Didn't

speaker_heading: HOPPS

speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Stop!
text: Hopps spots the Weasel, who's using two mouse cars as skates.

text: the Weasel jumps off the top of a mouse building, he knocks
text: it over, but Hopps is able to save them from crashing.
text: Resuming the chase, Hopps jumps off the building-- landing

speaker_heading: HOPPS (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh! Oh, sorry! Coming through!
dialog: `Scuse me! `Scuse me. Pardon...

speaker_heading: DUKE WEASELTON
dialog: Bon voyage, flat foot!
text: But Hopps won't quit. She takes a short cut and knocks him

speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Hey! Stop right there!
text: The Weasel throws an ornamental donut at Hopps.
speaker_heading: DUKE WEASELTON
dialog: Have a donut, coppah!
text: But the donut misses and rolls towards some SHREWS coming out

speaker_heading: FRU FRU SHREW

speaker_heading: FRU FRU SHREW
dialog: Aw... thank you.
text: Meanwhile, the Weasel spots the bag he was stealing and

speaker_heading: DUKE WEASELTON

speaker_heading: BOGO

speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Hate to disagree with you, sir, but
dialog: those aren't onions. Those are a

speaker_heading: BOGO

speaker_heading: BOGO

scene_heading: MRS. OTTERTON
dialog: My husband has been missing for ten

speaker_heading: BOGO
dialog: Yes, I know.
scene_heading: MRS. OTTERTON
dialog: He's a florist. We have two
dialog: beautiful children. He would never

speaker_heading: BOGO

scene_heading: MRS. OTTERTON
dialog: Please. There's got to be somebody

speaker_heading: BOGO
dialog: Mrs. Otterton--
speaker_heading: HOPPS (O.S.)
dialog: I will find him.
text: Mrs. Otterton races over to Hopps and gives her a big hug of

scene_heading: MRS. OTTERTON
dialog: Oh, thank you! Bless you, bless you
dialog: little bunny!
dialog: (hands picture of family)
dialog: Take this. Find my Emmitt. Bring
dialog: him home to me and my babies.

text: Bogo grunts and ushers Mrs. Otterton back outside.
speaker_heading: BOGO
dialog: Mrs. Otterton? Please wait out
dialog: here.
scene_heading: MRS. OTTERTON
dialog: Of course. Oh, thank you both so
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: BOGO

text: He closes the door and turns to Hopps, furious.
speaker_heading: BOGO (CONT'D)
dialog: You're fired.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: What? Why?!
speaker_heading: BOGO
dialog: Insubordination. Now, I'm going to
dialog: open this door and you're going to
dialog: tell that otter you're a former
text: meter maid with delusions of
dialog: grandeur who will not be taking the
dialog: case.
dialog: 37.
text: Bogo opens the door, to find... Bellwether, hugging Mrs.

speaker_heading: BELLWETHER

dialog: taking the case!
speaker_heading: BOGO
dialog: Assistant Mayor Bellwether...
speaker_heading: BELLWETHER
dialog: (texting)
dialog: The Mammal Inclusion Initiative is
dialog: really starting to pay off! Mayor
dialog: Lionheart is just gonna be so
dialog: jazzed!
speaker_heading: BOGO
dialog: No! No, let's not tell the mayor
dialog: just yet--
speaker_heading: BELLWETHER
dialog: And I sent it, and it is done, so I
dialog: did do that. All right, well I'd
dialog: say the case is in good hands! Us
dialog: little guys really need to stick
dialog: together! Right?
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Like glue!
speaker_heading: BELLWETHER
dialog: (amused laughter)
dialog: Good one! Just call me if you ever
dialog: need anything, okay? You've always
dialog: got a friend at City Hall, Judy.
dialog: Alright, bye bye!
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Thank you, ma'am.
text: Bogo forces a smile and closes the door, even more pissed.
speaker_heading: BOGO
dialog: I will give you 48 hours.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: YES!
speaker_heading: BOGO
dialog: That's two days to find Emmitt
dialog: Otterton.
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: BOGO
dialog: But, you strike out-- you resign.
text: Hopps is taken aback by that for a moment... then nods.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Oh, uh... okay... deal.
speaker_heading: BOGO
dialog: Splendid. Clawhauser will give you
dialog: the complete case file.
scene_heading: INT. ZPD - DESK AREA - A LITTLE LATER
text: Clawhauser places the Otterton file on his desk for Hopps.
speaker_heading: CLAWHAUSER
dialog: Here ya go! One missing otter!
text: Hopps opens the file. It's a single piece of paper. What?
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: That's it?!
speaker_heading: CLAWHAUSER
dialog: Yikes! That is the smallest case
dialog: file I've ever seen! Leads: none,
dialog: witnesses: none-- and you're not in
dialog: the computer system yet, so
dialog: resources: none.
dialog: (chuckles)
dialog: I hope you didn't stake your career
dialog: on cracking this one.
text: Clawhauser takes a bite of his donut and the crumbs land on a
text: picture in the file, drawing Hopps's attention to it.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Okay.
dialog: (deep breath)
dialog: "Last known sighting..."
text: Hopps brushes away the crumbs, revealing a picture of Mr.
text: Otterton on the street. Clawhauser annoyingly slurps from a
text: soda bottle. Hopps squints at the picture, intrigued.
speaker_heading: HOPPS (CONT'D)
dialog: Can I just borrow--
dialog: (grabbing soda bottle)
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 39.
text: Hopps uses Clawhauser's bottle to enlarge the picture. She
text: sees Mr. Otterton holding a PAWPSICLE.
speaker_heading: HOPPS (CONT'D)
dialog: Pawpsicle.
speaker_heading: CLAWHAUSER
dialog: The murder weapon!
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Get your pawpsicle...
speaker_heading: CLAWHAUSER
dialog: Yeah, `cause that... What does that
dialog: mean?
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: It means I... have a lead.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - LATER

speaker_heading: HOPPS

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Hey, it's Officer Toot Toot.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: (fake laugh, humoring him)
dialog: Ha-ha-ho, no actually it's Officer
dialog: Hopps, and I'm here to ask you some
dialog: questions about a case.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What happened, meter maid? Did
dialog: someone steal a traffic cone? It
dialog: wasn't me.
text: Hopps looks ahead, Nick has gone around the corner. Hopps
text: pulls in front of Nick and sounds her siren.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, Carrots, you're gonna wake the
dialog: baby, I gotta get to work.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: This is important, sir. I think
dialog: your ten dollars worth of popsicles
dialog: can wait.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I make 200 bucks a day, fluff. 365
dialog: days a year, since I was 12, and
dialog: time is money, hop along.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Please, just look at the picture.
text: Hopps holds up the traffic cam picture of the Otter.
speaker_heading: HOPPS (CONT'D)
dialog: You sold Mr. Otterton that popsicle
dialog: right? Do you know him?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I know everybody. And I also know
dialog: that somewhere there's a toy store
dialog: missing its stuffed animal, so why
dialog: don't you get back to your box.
text: Hopps' ears droop.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Fine. Then we'll have to do this
dialog: the hard way.
text: She puts a boot on the stroller.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Did you just boot my stroller?
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Nicholas Wilde, you are under
dialog: arrest.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: For what? Howting your feewings?
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Felony tax evasion.
text: Nick smile drops a bit.
speaker_heading: HOPPS (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah. 200 dollars a day... 365 days
dialog: a year... since you were 12, that's
dialog: two decades, so times twenty...
dialog: (calculating)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: HOPPS (CONT'D)
dialog: ...which is one million four-
dialog: hundred sixty thousand-- I think, I
dialog: mean I am just a dumb bunny, but we
dialog: are good at multiplying-- anyway,
dialog: according to your tax forms...
dialog: (presenting the forms)
dialog: ...you reported let me see here:
text: zero. Unfortunately, lying on a

speaker_heading: NICK

scene_heading: NICK (ON CARROT PEN RECORDER) (CONT'D)
dialog: "200 bucks a day, fluff. 365 days a

speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Actually, it's your word against
dialog: yours. And if you want this pen,
dialog: you're going to help me find this
dialog: poor missing otter or the only
dialog: place you'll be selling popsicles
dialog: is the prison cafeteria.
dialog: (dramatic smirk)
dialog: It's called a hustle, sweetheart.
text: Nick is utterly speechless.
speaker_heading: FINNICK
dialog: She hustled you.
dialog: (rude laugh)
dialog: She hustled you good! You're a cop
dialog: now Nick, you're gonna need one of
dialog: these! Have fun working with the
dialog: fuzz!
text: THWAP! Finnick slaps his JUNIOR OFFICER STICKER on Nick.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Start talking.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I don't know where he is.
dialog: I only saw where he went.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Great, let's go.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: HOPPS

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Okay. You're the boss.
scene_heading: INT. THE MYSTIC SPRING OASIS - LATER
text: The Mystic Spring Oasis is new agey, full of incense, etc. A

dialog: I'm looking for a missing mammal,
dialog: Emmitt Otterton. Right here--

text: The Yak looks at Hopps' picture. His eyes go wide, as if he's
dialog: about to say something really important, and then:
dialog: 43.
scene_heading: YAX THE HIPPIE YAK
speaker_heading: AH-CHOO!
dialog: (flies go everywhere)
dialog: Yeah, Ol' Emmitt! Haven't seen him
dialog: in a couple weeks. But hey, you
dialog: should talk to his yoga instructor,
dialog: I'd be happy to take you back.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Oh, thank you so much, I'd
dialog: appreciate that more than you can
dialog: imagine. It would be such a big--
dialog: (scream)
dialog: You are naked!
text: The Yak comes around the counter and he IS naked.
scene_heading: YAX THE HIPPIE YAK
dialog: Huh? Oh for sure, we're a

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yeah, in Zootopia anyone can be
dialog: anything. These guys... they be

scene_heading: YAX THE HIPPIE YAK
text: Nangi's just on the other side of
dialog: the pleasure pool.
text: The Yak opens the doors to a POOL AREA, with tons of naked
text: animals sunning themselves, playing in the pool, etc. Hopps'
text: eyes nearly pop out of her head. Nick leans in.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Does this make you uncomfortable?
dialog: Because, if so, there's no shame in
dialog: calling it quits.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Yes there is.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Boy, that's the spirit.
scene_heading: EXT. NATURALIST CLUB - COURTYARD - MOMENTS LATER

scene_heading: YAX THE HIPPIE YAK
dialog: Yeah, some mammals say the
dialog: naturalist life is weird, but you
dialog: know what I say is weird? Clothes
dialog: on animals! Here we go.
text: Nangi's engaging in a string of fairly evocative yoga poses.
speaker_heading: YAX THE HIPPIE YAK (CONT'D)
dialog: As you can see, Nangi's an
dialog: elephant, so she'll totally
dialog: remember everything. Hey Nangi,
dialog: these dudes have some questions
dialog: about Emmitt the Otter.
speaker_heading: NANGI
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: YAX
dialog: Uh, Emmitt Otterton? Been coming to
dialog: your yoga class for like 6 years?
speaker_heading: NANGI
dialog: I have no memory of this beaver.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: He's an otter actually.
speaker_heading: YAX
dialog: He was here a couple Wednesdays
dialog: ago. `Member?
speaker_heading: NANGI
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: YAX
dialog: Yeah, he was wearing a green cable-
text: knit sweater vest, and new pair of
text: corduroy slacks. Oh, and a paisley
dialog: tie. Sweet Windsor knot. Real
dialog: tight. Remember that Nangi?
speaker_heading: NANGI
dialog: No.
text: Nangi doesn't want to be bothered. And she's useless. Yax is
text: a gold mine, though! Hopps writes down everything he says.
speaker_heading: YAX
dialog: Yeah, and we both walked him out
dialog: and he got into this big ol' white
dialog: car with a silver trim? Needed a
dialog: tune up. The third cylinder wasn't
dialog: firing. `Member that, Nangi?
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: NANGI
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: You didn't happen to catch the
dialog: license plate number, did you?
speaker_heading: YAX

speaker_heading: HOPPS

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Well, I had a ball. You are welcome

dialog: that pen and bid you adieu.
text: As Nick reaches to take it, Hopps realizes something and
text: leaves him hanging.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: The plate... I can't run a plate...
dialog: (frustrated grunt)
dialog: I'm not in the system yet.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Give me the pen please.
text: Hopps gets an idea...
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: (still withholding pen)
dialog: What was it you said? "Any moron
dialog: can run a plate?" Gosh... if only

dialog: up to the task...
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Rabbit, I did what you asked, you
dialog: can't keep me on the hook forever.
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Not forever. Why, I only have 36

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: HOPPS

speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: What did you do that made Mr. Big
dialog: so mad at you?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: I uh, I may have sold him a very
dialog: expensive wool rug... that was made
text: from the fur of a... skunk's butt.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: (pissed at Nick)
dialog: Oh, sweet cheese and crackers.
text: Pull out to reveal the car passing through the security gate

scene_heading: INT. MR. BIG'S RESIDENCE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Nick and Hopps are shoved into a room that's right out of The

dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Is that Mr. Big?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: No.
text: Now an even BIGGER POLAR BEAR enters...
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: What about him? Is that him?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (sotto, frustrated)
dialog: No.
text: ...and then another. The BIGGEST POLAR BEAR yet...
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: That's gotta be him.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Stop talking stop talking stop
dialog: talking--
text: The huge polar bear growls at Nick, then reveals a tiny chair
text: upon which sits... a TEENY, TINY ARCTIC SHREW... this is MR.
text: BIG. He sounds like Marlon Brando sped up to 78 rpm.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr. Big, sir, this is a simple
dialog: misunder-
text: Mr. Big holds out a TINY FINGER for NICK to KISS HIS RING.
text: Nick painstakingly does so.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: This is a simple misunderstanding.
text: Mr. Big motions for Nick to shut up.
speaker_heading: MR. BIG
dialog: You come here unannounced... on the
dialog: day my daughter is to be married?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Well actually we were brought here
dialog: against our will, so...
dialog: (Mr. Big is not impressed)
dialog: Point is, I did not know it was
dialog: your car, and I certainly did not
dialog: know about your daughter's wedding.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: MR. BIG
dialog: I trusted you, Nicky... I welcomed
dialog: you into my home... we broke bread
dialog: together... Gram-mama made you her
dialog: cannoli. And how did you repay my
dialog: generosity? With a rug... made from
text: the butt of a skunk. A skunk butt
dialog: rug. You disrespected me. You
dialog: disrespected my gram-mama who I
dialog: buried in that skunk butt rug. I
dialog: told you never to show your face
dialog: here again, but here you are,
dialog: snooping around with this...
dialog: (re. Hopps)
dialog: What are you, a performer? What's
dialog: with the costume?
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Sir, I am a c--
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Mime! She is a mime. This mime,
dialog: cannot speak. You can't speak if
dialog: you're a mime.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: No. I am a cop. And I'm on the
dialog: Emmitt Otterton case, and my
dialog: evidence puts him in your car, so
dialog: intimidate me all you want, I'm
dialog: going to find out what you did to
dialog: that otter if it's the last thing I
dialog: do.
text: Mr. Big considers this and makes that little grunt.
speaker_heading: MR. BIG
dialog: Then I have only one request: say
dialog: hello to Gram-mama. Ice `em!
text: The Polar Bears snatch Nick and Hopps.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Whoa-- I didn't see nothing-- I'm
dialog: not saying nothing--
speaker_heading: MR. BIG
dialog: And you never will--
text: The polar bears open a hidden door on the floor, revealing an
text: icy pool beneath.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Please! No no no! If you're mad at
dialog: me about the rug I've got more
dialog: rugs!
text: Nick and Hopps are about to be dumped in, when--
speaker_heading: FRU FRU SHREW
dialog: Oh, Daddy, it's time for our dance.
dialog: (sees them trying to kill
dialog: Nick)
dialog: What did we say? No icing anyone at
dialog: my wedding!
speaker_heading: MR. BIG
dialog: I have to, baby. Daddy has to.
dialog: (to Thugs)
dialog: Ice `em.
text: Nick and Hopps scream and--
speaker_heading: FRU FRU SHREW
dialog: Wait. WAIT! She's the bunny that
dialog: saved my life yesterday. From that
text: giant donut.
speaker_heading: MR. BIG
dialog: This bunny?
speaker_heading: FRU FRU SHREW
dialog: Yeah. Hi!
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Hi.
dialog: (warm, whisper)
dialog: I love your dress.
speaker_heading: FRU FRU SHREW
dialog: Aw, thank you.
text: Mr. Big motions for the Polar Bears to put Hopps down.
speaker_heading: MR. BIG
dialog: Put `em down.
dialog: (then, to Hopps)
dialog: You have done me a great service.
dialog: I will help you find the otter. I
dialog: will take your kindness... and pay
dialog: it forward.
text: Hopps and Mr. Big kiss on the cheeks. Nick stares at them...
dialog: What is happening?
dialog: 58.
scene_heading: INT. WEDDING RECEPTION - A LITTLE LATER
text: A lavish celebration full of arctic animals dancing. We find
text: Nick and Hopps at the head table, next to Mr. Big. They all
text: eat TINY pieces of WEDDING CAKE.
speaker_heading: MR. BIG
dialog: Otterton is my florist. He's like a
dialog: part of the family. He had
dialog: something important he wanted to
dialog: discuss. That's why I sent that car
dialog: to pick him up. But he never
dialog: arrived.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Because he was attacked.
speaker_heading: MR. BIG
dialog: No... he attacked.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Otterton?
speaker_heading: MR. BIG
text: Otterton. He went crazy. Ripped up
dialog: the car, scared my driver half to
dialog: death and disappeared into the
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: He's a sweet little otter.
speaker_heading: MR. BIG
dialog: My child, we may be evolved... but
dialog: deep down we are still animals.
text: Nick and Hopps trade a worried glance. OVER THE FOLLOWING WE
text: CROSS-DISSOLVE TO NICK AND HOPPS WALKING IN THE RAINFOREST:
speaker_heading: MR. BIG (V.O.)(CONT'D)
dialog: You want to find Otterton... talk
text: to the driver of the car. His
dialog: name's Manchas, lives in the
dialog: Rainforest District. Only he can
dialog: tell you more.
scene_heading: EXT. "RAINFOREST DISTRICT" - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Nick and Hopps make their way across a mossy rope bridge high
text: above the forest floor. It leads to a moss-covered apartment.
dialog: 59.
scene_heading: EXT. "THE CANOPY" - MOMENTS LATER
text: At the door of the DRIVER'S APARTMENT, they ring the bell.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Mr. Manchas? Judy Hopps, ZPD. We
dialog: just want to know what happened to
dialog: Emmitt Otterton.
text: Beat. The door creaks open.
speaker_heading: MANCHAS (MUFFLED INSIDE)
dialog: You should be asking... what
dialog: happened to me.
text: The door opens to the chain, revealing... MANCHAS is... a
text: HUGE JAGUAR-- but he's been badly beaten up. He has a black
text: eye, and a scratches. Nick and Hopps are taken aback.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Whoa. A teensy otter... did that?
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: What... happened?
dialog: Off Manchas's look, we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: A FLASHBACK --
text: Manchas is driving when he's attacked from the back seat.
speaker_heading: MANCHAS (THROUGH DOOR GAP)
dialog: He was an animal... down on all
dialog: fours... he was a savage.
text: The car spins out. Emmitt growls at Manchas then runs off.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: THE CANOPY --
speaker_heading: MANCHAS
dialog: (haunted)
dialog: There was no warning, he just kept
text: yelling about the "night howlers."
dialog: Over and over, "the night
dialog: howlers..."
text: Nick and Hopps share a subtle look-- they have no idea what
dialog: "night howlers" are.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Oh. So you know about the night
dialog: howlers too? Good, good, good.
dialog: Because the night howlers are
dialog: exactly what we are here to talk
dialog: about.
dialog: (to Judy)
dialog: Right?
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Yep. So, uh, you just open the door
dialog: and tell us what you know and we
dialog: will tell you what we know. Okay?
speaker_heading: MANCHAS
dialog: (considering)
dialog: Okay.
text: Manchas closes the door and starts to unlock a series of
text: deadbolts. Judy gives Nick an impressed look.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Clever fox.
text: There's a commotion inside, followed by a scream.
speaker_heading: HOPPS (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr. Manchas?
text: The door creaks open just an inch. Nick and Hopps seem
text: startled... Hopps slowly pushes the door open, revealing
text: Manchas in the center of the room, hunched over and grunting.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Buddy?
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Are you... okay?
text: Hopps looks at Manchas.
text: RAAAGH!!! Manchas turns, right at them. His eyes are dilated,
text: he's turned savage! He's poised to pounce on Nick and Hopps.
speaker_heading: HOPPS (CONT'D)
dialog: Run. RUN!
text: The Jaguar tears after them, he's deranged, primal. Nick and
text: Hopps run! The jaguar is closing in.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What is wrong with him?!
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: I don't know!!
text: Nick and Hopps run across the bridge. Manchas closes in.
speaker_heading: HOPPS (CONT'D)
dialog: Jump!
text: They jump off the bridge to a lower branch. They duck into a
text: hollow log and Manchas follows them.
speaker_heading: HOPPS (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Nick)
dialog: Head down!
text: Hopps frantically picks up her police radio.
speaker_heading: HOPPS (CONT'D)
dialog: Officer Hopps to dispatch!
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - DISPATCH - SAME
text: We find Clawhauser showing a handcuffed PERP a video on his

speaker_heading: CLAWHAUSER
dialog: Are you familiar with Gazelle?

speaker_heading: CLAWHAUSER!

scene_heading: EXT. THE CANOPY - SAME

speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Clawhauser, listen to me! We have a

dialog: Tu-junja!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: It's Tujunga!
text: As they emerge from the log, Hopps slips, dropping her radio.
speaker_heading: CLAWHAUSER (ON RADIO)
dialog: Okay, we're sending back up! Hopps?
dialog: HOPPS?!
text: Nick and Hopps run, sliding around a corner. Ahead is a
text: gondola station.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: There! Head to the skytrams!
text: They run to the gondolas. Hopps darts out of Manchas' way,
text: but slips and is headed off the platform when she manages to
text: grab on-- dangling from the edge. Nick searches for her...
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Get in! Carrots? Carrots!
text: He tries to hold on to the gondola for Hopps, who is
text: struggling to pull herself back onto the platform.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Go!
text: As the gondola pulls away, Nick tries to stop it to no avail.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No, no, no!
text: Nick backs up... the jaguar stalks him.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Buddy, one predator to another-- *
text: The jaguar charges, but before it gets Nick-- clank! It's *
text: yanked back in place. We see a HANDCUFF on its back paw,
text: attached to a metal post. Hopps cuffed him!
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, I can tell you're a little
dialog: tense, so I'm just gonna give you a
dialog: little personal space--
text: The jaguar thrashes, knocking Nick and Hopps over the edge.
text: Hopps barely grabs a vine, but struggles to hold Nick in the
text: other hand. As Manchas growls at them from above, Nick looks
text: at the abyss below. Hopps looks around, her mind racing.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Rabbit, whatever you do, do not let
dialog: go!
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: I'm gonna let go!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No, you what? No, I said-- listen--
dialog: noooo!
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: One, two--
text: Hopps lets go, swinging them over to a netting of vines, kind
text: of on top of each other. They can't believe they're alive.
text: They look at each other, stunned, relieved...
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Carrots. You saved my life.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Well. That's what we do at the
dialog: ZP...
dialog: (the branch snaps)
dialog: Deeeeeeeeeeeee.....
text: Nick and Hopps plummet. They are about to hit the ground, but
text: a vine attached to their legs stops them right before impact.
text: Woo! A convoy of police arrive, screeching in front of them.
text: Out steps... Bogo. Hopps smiles, the cavalry has arrived.
speaker_heading: BOGO
dialog: Well, this should be good.
scene_heading: MOMENTS LATER --
text: Hopps leads the cops up to the canopy, full of confidence.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: I thought this was just a missing
dialog: mammal case, but it's way bigger.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: HOPPS (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr. Otterton did not just
dialog: disappear. I believe he and this
dialog: jaguar, they... went savage, Sir.
speaker_heading: BOGO
dialog: (scoffing)
dialog: Savage? This isn't the Stone Age,
dialog: Hopps. Animals don't go savage.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: I thought so too, `til I saw this:
text: Hopps pulls back some leaves to reveal: the jaguar is gone.
text: There is no sign of him... or his handcuffs. It's like it
text: never happened. Hopps' eyes go wide.
speaker_heading: HOPPS (CONT'D)
dialog: What? He was right here...
speaker_heading: BOGO
dialog: (not buying it)
text: The "savage" jaguar.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Sir, I know what I saw-- he almost
dialog: killed us.
speaker_heading: BOGO
dialog: Or maybe any aggressive predator
dialog: looks savage to you rabbits.
dialog: (calls out, to cops)
dialog: Let's go.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Wait-- Sir, I'm not the only one
dialog: who saw him!
dialog: (to Nick)
dialog: Nick!
text: Hopps turns to Nick, but before he can explain:
speaker_heading: BOGO
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: You think I'm going to believe a
dialog: fox?
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Well he was a key witness and I
dialog: enlisted--
speaker_heading: BOGO
dialog: (the last straw)
dialog: Two days to find the otter...
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: BOGO (CONT'D)
dialog: or you quit... that was the deal.
dialog: Badge.
text: Bogo extends his arm, waiting for Hopps to hand it over.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: But, Sir, we...
speaker_heading: BOGO
dialog: Badge.
text: Hopps looks at Bogo, then looks at her badge, she's about to
dialog: reach for it, when...
speaker_heading: NICK (O.S.)
dialog: Uh, no.
text: Bogo stops, and glares at Nick.
speaker_heading: BOGO
dialog: What did you say, fox?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Sorry, what I said was, "no." She
dialog: will not be giving you that badge.
dialog: Look, you gave her a clown vest and
text: a three-wheel joke-mobile and two
dialog: days to solve a case you guys
dialog: haven't cracked in two weeks? Yeah,
dialog: no wonder she needed to get help
dialog: from a fox, none of you guys were
dialog: gonna help her, were you?
text: Hopps looks at Nick, stunned he's sticking up for her.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Here's the thing Chief, you gave
dialog: her the 48 hours, so technically we
dialog: still have 10 left to find our Mr.
dialog: Otterton... and that's exactly what
dialog: we're gonna do, so if you'll excuse
dialog: us... we have a very big lead to
dialog: follow and a case to crack. Good
dialog: day.
text: Nick guides Hopps to a PASSING GONDOLA, motioning her in.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Officer Hopps?
text: The gondola pulls away, leaving Bogo and the rest of the
text: police watching, flabbergasted.
dialog: 66.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. GONDOLA - CONTINUOUS
text: Hopps and Nick both stare straight ahead.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Never let `em see that they get to
dialog: you.
text: Hopps looks at Nick, a little surprised. Nick looks out.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: So, things do get to you...
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No... I mean, not anymore. But I
dialog: was small and emotionally
dialog: unbalanced like you once.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Har-har.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (retreating into the
dialog: memory)
dialog: No, it's true. I think was 8, or
dialog: maybe 9, and all I wanted to do was
dialog: join the Junior Ranger Scouts.

dialog: ...the only fox.
speaker_heading: MEAN KID ANIMAL (O.S.)
dialog: Okay, Nick!
speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)

speaker_heading: MEAN KID ANIMAL

speaker_heading: YOUNG NICK
dialog: Yeah! Pretty much born ready.
text: They high five Nick. It looks promising and fun.
speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)
dialog: I was so proud.
text: Suddenly, a BIG KID turns off the lights. Other KIDS switch
text: on FLASHLIGHTS, shining them on Nick like gestapo spotlights.
speaker_heading: MEAN KID ANIMAL
dialog: Okay. Now raise your right hand and
dialog: deliver the oath.
speaker_heading: YOUNG NICK
dialog: I, Nicholas Wilde, promise to be
dialog: brave, loyal, helpful, and
dialog: trustworthy.
speaker_heading: MEAN KID ANIMAL
dialog: Even though you're a fox?
speaker_heading: YOUNG NICK
dialog: What?
text: Then, a bunch of KID ANIMALS tackle Nick. Soon, all of the
text: animals pile on, kicking and shoving him.
speaker_heading: YOUNG NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: No! What did I do wrong, you guys?!
dialog: No! Please tell me, what did I do
dialog: wrong?!
text: With Nick pinned, the primary mean kid straddles him. Someone
text: hands him a MUZZLE. The mean kid snaps it on Nick's snout.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: YOUNG NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: (muzzled)
dialog: What did I do?!
speaker_heading: MEAN KID ANIMAL
dialog: If you thought we would ever trust
dialog: a fox without a muzzle, you're even
dialog: dumber than you look.
text: Nick breaks free from the kids. Scrambles away from them in
text: fright. As they laugh, he races out the door.
speaker_heading: MEAN KID ANIMAL (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Aw, is he gonna cry?
text: Once out sight, Nick panics as he struggles to remove the
text: muzzle. It won't come off. Finally-- painfully-- he pulls it
text: off and throws it to the ground. He collapses, weeping.
scene_heading: THE GONDOLA --
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I learned two things that day. One,
dialog: I was never gonna let anyone see
dialog: that they got to me.
text: Hopps looks at Nick, who avoids eye contact.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: ...And two?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: If the world's only gonna see a fox
dialog: as shifty and untrustworthy,
dialog: there's no point in trying to be
dialog: anything else.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Nick, you are so much more than
dialog: that...
text: Hopps touches Nick's arm as the gondola pierces the clouds.
text: The city at dawn comes into view. It's gotten too real for
text: Nick. He abruptly changes the subject.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Boy, look at that traffic down
dialog: there.
dialog: (putting on radio voice)
dialog: How about we go out to Chuck in

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (lightbulb moment!)
dialog: The Jam Cams...!
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Seriously, it's okay...
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No-n-shh-shush! There are traffic

dialog: jaguar--
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: The traffic cams would have caught
dialog: it!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Bingo!
text: Hopps gives him a chuck on the arm, impressed.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Pretty sneaky, Slick.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: However. If you didn't have access
dialog: to the system before, I doubt Chief
dialog: Buffalo Butt is gonna let you into
dialog: it now.
speaker_heading: HOPPS

speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: But you're the Assistant Mayor of

speaker_heading: BELLWETHER

dialog: Tujunga, Tujunga... we're in.
text: Nick and Hopps watch the footage from the night before. We
text: can see the jaguar going nuts. Then a BLACK VAN skids up, and
text: some WOLVES hop out.
speaker_heading: HOPPS (CONT'D)
dialog: Who are these guys?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Timberwolves. Look at these
dialog: dumdums.
text: The Wolves suddenly capture the jaguar with a net. Judy
text: GASPS, shocked. Nick is unfazed.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Betcha a nickel one of em's gonna
text: howl.
text: The wolves howl...
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: And there it is. What is it with
dialog: wolves and the howling? It's like--
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: (light-bulb moment)
dialog: Howlers! Night howlers! That's what
dialog: Manchas was afraid of... wolves!
text: The wolves are the night howlers.
dialog: If they took Manchas...
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: ...I bet they took Otterton too.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: All we gotta do is find out where
dialog: they went.
text: She clicks the monitor... but as the wolves drive off, they
text: disappear through a tunnel and don't come out the other side.
speaker_heading: HOPPS (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait. Where'd they go?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You know, if I wanted to avoid
dialog: surveillance because I was doing
dialog: something illegal-- which I never
dialog: have-- I would use the maintenance
dialog: tunnel 6B... which would put them
dialog: out...
text: He clicks on another camera. Nothing... then... the wolves
text: emerge in the van.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: ...right there.
text: Hopps looks at Nick, impressed.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Well, look at you, Junior
dialog: Detective. You know, I think you'd
dialog: actually make a pretty good cop.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: How dare you.
text: Hopps goes back to clicking... we track the wolves through
text: alleys and back roads.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Acacia alley... Ficus underpass...
dialog: South Canyon...
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: They're heading out of town...
dialog: Where does that road go?
scene_heading: EXT. CLIFFSIDE ASYLUM - GOLDEN HOUR
text: The imposing CLIFFSIDE ASYLUM sits on the edge of a
text: waterfall. Nick and Hopps, hidden on the side of the road,
text: spy from a hundred yards away.
text: Nick and Hopps sneak up to the guard gate, where TWO WOLVES
dialog: are stationed.
dialog: 74.
text: Using elaborate hand signals, Nick motions he's going to
text: sneak past first. He gets around the gate, but as he gets
text: close... a wolf sniffs the air... he's onto him.
text: Nick reaches around and grabs a piece of wood to use as a
text: weapon. The wolf moves toward Nick... but before he reaches
dialog: him... Ooooooooooo!
text: A distant howl grabs his attention. It's Hopps, cupping her
text: mouth to make the howl sound distant. The wolf hears it and
text: can't help but howl as well. Another guard approaches.
speaker_heading: WOLF GUARD
dialog: Gary, quit it, you're gonna start a
text: howl.
scene_heading: GARY THE WOLF GUARD
dialog: I didn't start it.
dialog: (more howling off-screen)
dialog: Oooooooo!
speaker_heading: WOLF GUARD
dialog: Oooooooooo!
text: More wolves start to howl. Nick looks at Hopps, impressed.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Come on!
text: Nick and Hopps use the distraction to jump the fence and
text: sneak into the complex.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You are a clever bunny.
text: Above, they notice a drainage pipe leading into the building.
scene_heading: INT. CLIFFSIDE ASYLUM - LARGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Nick and Hopps emerge from the drain pipe into the creepy
text: asylum. They're in a large, cavernous room, full of old
text: MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. It's like a combination of an old hospital
text: and a turn-of-the-century zoo.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
text: It looks like this was a hospital.
text: Judy shines her light down a corridor, at the end of which is
text: a metal door with a blue light shining within. Nick nears the
text: door, about to open it... the tension builds and then...
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (turns to Hopps)
dialog: You know, after you, you're the
dialog: cop.
scene_heading: INT. CLIFFSIDE ASYLUM - MEDICAL WARD - MOMENTS LATER
text: Hopps cautiously pushes the door open to reveal: a room with
text: modern medical equipment. Nick pops up behind her.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Okay. All clear.
text: Hopps rolls her eyes and cautiously enters and looks around.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: All this equipment is brand new...
speaker_heading: NICK (O.S.)
dialog: Carrots...?
text: Nick points to the ground, which is scuffed with CLAW MARKS.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Claw marks...
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yeah. Huge, huge, claw marks. I
dialog: mean, what kind of--
text: RAAGH! A SAVAGE TIGER emerges behind the glass of a nearby
text: cage, startling Nick and sending him running to Hopps.
text: Hopps swivels her flashlight to reveal: dozens of reflective
text: eyes. Nick and Hopps make their way down a long corridor of
text: cages, looking for the jaguar.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Mr. Manchas.
text: He's still feral, on all fours and pacing in a cell. They
text: continue on, passing three, four, five, cages until finally,
text: in the last cage: a FERAL OTTER. It's EMMITT OTTERTON.
speaker_heading: HOPPS (CONT'D)
dialog: It's him. We found our otter.
dialog: (to the otter, gently)
dialog: Mr. Otterton, my name is Officer
dialog: Judy Hopps. Your wife sent me to
dialog: find you. We're gonna get you out
dialog: of here now.
text: Otterton screeches at her and lunges toward the glass.
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Or not. Guess he's in no rush to
dialog: get home to the Missus.
text: Hopps looks back down the corridor of cells, counting.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: ...11, 12, 13, 14. Not including
dialog: Manchas it's 14...
dialog: (lightbulb)
dialog: Chief Bogo handed out 14 Missing
dialog: Mammal files... They're all here.
dialog: All the missing mammals are right
dialog: here.
text: Before she can respond-- CLICK! A door starts to open, Nick
text: and Hopps retreat, stuck next to a DARK CELL.
speaker_heading: LIONHEART (O.S.)
dialog: Enough! I don't want excuses,
dialog: Doctor, I want answers.
text: Reveal: Mayor Lionheart berating the BADGER DOCTOR by his
text: side. He looks serious, intense, tired.
speaker_heading: BADGER DOCTOR
dialog: Mayor Lionheart, please, we're
dialog: doing everything we can.
text: Hopps whips out her phone, starts recording.
speaker_heading: LIONHEART
dialog: Really? Cuz I got a dozen and a
dialog: half animals here who've gone off
dialog: the rails crazy-- and you can't
dialog: tell me why. Now, I'd call that
dialog: awfully far from doing everything.
speaker_heading: BADGER DOCTOR
dialog: Sir, it may be time to consider
dialog: their biology.
speaker_heading: LIONHEART
dialog: What? What do you mean biology?
speaker_heading: BADGER DOCTOR
text: The only animals going savage are
dialog: predators. We cannot keep it a
dialog: secret. We need to come forward.
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: LIONHEART
dialog: Hmm... Great idea. Tell the public.
dialog: And how do you think they're gonna
dialog: feel about their mayor, who is a
dialog: lion?! I'll be ruined!
speaker_heading: BADGER DOCTOR
dialog: Well, what does Chief Bogo say?
speaker_heading: LIONHEART
dialog: Chief Bogo doesn't know. And we are
dialog: going to keep it that way.
text: Beep-beep-beep-- Hopps' parents call in. She frantically
text: tries to silence her phone.
speaker_heading: LIONHEART (CONT'D)
dialog: Someone's here!
speaker_heading: BADGER DOCTOR
dialog: Sir, you need to go, now!
dialog: (calls out)
dialog: Security! Sweep the area!
text: AN ALARM SOUNDS. The door to the cell Hopps and Nick are in
text: triggers shut. They notice WOLVES approaching.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Great! We're dead. We're dead.
dialog: That's it. I'm dead. You're dead.
dialog: Everybody's dead.
text: This gives Hopps an idea. She looks at the HUGE TOILET.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Can you swim?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What? Can I swim? Yes, I can swim.
dialog: Why?
text: The Wolves storm in, searching for the intruders... and see
text: the swirling water of a toilet disappearing down the drain.
text: Hopps and Nick fly through the water slide like tubes of the
text: sewer system, cascading over a waterfall. Both scream. They
text: land in the river below. Nick pop up first. He looks
dialog: desperately for Judy.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Carrots?! Hopps?! Judy?!
text: She emerges, gasping for breath, holding up the bagged phone.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: HOPPS

speaker_heading: CLAWHAUSER

speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Mayor Lionheart, you have the right
dialog: to remain silent. Anything--
speaker_heading: LIONHEART
dialog: You don't understand. I was trying

speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: You were just trying to protect

speaker_heading: LIONHEART
dialog: No. Listen, we still don't know why

speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Rrrgh. I am so nervous...
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Okay, press conference 101: You
dialog: wanna look smart?
speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Answer their question with your own

dialog: about the case?"
dialog: (pretending to be Hopps)
dialog: "Well, was this a tough case? Yes.
dialog: Yes it was." You see?
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: You should be there with me. We did

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: HOPPS

speaker_heading: BOGO (O.S.)

speaker_heading: BELLWETHER

text: As Hopps goes, Nick smiles. He's touched...
speaker_heading: BOGO
dialog: So now, I'll turn things over to

dialog: Officer Judy Hopps.

speaker_heading: PRESS
dialog: Officer Hopps! / Over here! / Here!
speaker_heading: HOPPS
text: (pointing to a REPORTER)
dialog: Yes?

speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: What can you tell us about the
dialog: animals that went savage?
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Well, the animals in question...
dialog: (glances at Nick)
dialog: Are they all different species?
dialog: Yes. Yes they are.
text: Nick smiles, gives a thumbs up.
speaker_heading: REPORTER 2
dialog: Okay, so what is the connection?
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Well, all we know is that they are
dialog: all members of the predator family.
scene_heading: ANOTHER REPORTER
dialog: So, predators are the only ones
dialog: going savage?
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: That is accu-- Yes, that is
dialog: accurate. Yes...
speaker_heading: REPORTER 3
dialog: Wow. Why is that happening?
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: We still don't know--
text: More disappointed rumbling.
speaker_heading: HOPPS (CONT'D)
dialog: (trying to appease)
dialog: Ah, it may have something to do
dialog: with biology.
dialog: On Nick-- huh? The press reacts, too... big time.
speaker_heading: REPORTER (O.S.)
dialog: What do you mean by that?
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: A biological component. You know,
dialog: something in their DNA...
speaker_heading: REPORTER 4
dialog: (more aggressive)
dialog: In their DNA? Can you elaborate on
dialog: that, please?
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Yes. What I mean is, thousands of
dialog: years ago... um... predators
dialog: survived through their aggressive
dialog: hunting instincts. For whatever
text: reason, they seem to be reverting
dialog: back to their primitive, savage
dialog: ways.
text: Nick doesn't like what he's hearing.
speaker_heading: REPORTER (O.S.)
dialog: Of course they did.
text: Nick looks at the posters of the muzzled animals and shakes
text: his head, disbelieving. FLASH BACK to his memory of being
text: muzzled as a child.
speaker_heading: MEAN KID ANIMAL (V.O.)
dialog: (during flashback)
dialog: Aw, is he gonna cry.
speaker_heading: REPORTER (O.S.)
dialog: (on Nick, as flashback
dialog: ends)
dialog: Officer Hopps, could it happen
dialog: again?
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: It is possible. So we must be
dialog: vigilant. And we at the ZPD are
dialog: prepared and are here to protect
dialog: you...
text: This sends the Press into an absolute frenzy.
speaker_heading: PRESS
dialog: Will more mammals go savage? / What
dialog: is being done to protect us? / Have
dialog: you considered a mandatory

text: Bellwether steps in, eager to put an end to the questions.
speaker_heading: BELLWETHER
dialog: Okay, thank you Officer Hopps, uh,
dialog: that's all the time that we have.
dialog: No more questions...
text: Bellwether ushers Hopps off stage.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Was I okay?
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: BELLWETHER
dialog: Oh, you did fine.
text: Hopps walks across the lobby to Nick, completely unaware that
dialog: she just started a controversy.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: (excited)
dialog: That went so fast! I didn't get a
dialog: chance to mention you or say
dialog: anything about how we--
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (upset)
dialog: Oh, I think you said plenty.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (sarcastic, hard)
dialog: Clearly, there's a biological
dialog: component? These predators may be
text: reverting back to their primitive,
dialog: savage ways. Are you serious?
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: I just stated the facts of the
dialog: case. I mean, it's not like a bunny
dialog: could go savage...
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Right. But a fox could? Huh?
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Nick, stop it. You're not like
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Oh, there's a them now?
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: You know what I mean. You're not
dialog: that kind of predator.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: The kind that needs to be muzzled?
dialog: The kind that makes you think you
dialog: need to carry around Fox Repellent?
text: Hopps sighs guiltily.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah, don't think I didn't notice
dialog: that little item the first time we
dialog: met.
dialog: (escalating anger)
dialog: So let me ask you a question. Are
dialog: you afraid of me?
dialog: (Hopps looks heartbroken)
dialog: Do you think I might go nuts? Do
dialog: you think I might go savage? Do you
dialog: think I might try to... EAT YOU?!
text: He lunges, like he's going to bite her. She flinches and
text: unthinkingly puts her hand on the repellent.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: (calm, hurt)
dialog: ...I knew it. Just when I thought
dialog: somebody actually believed in me...
text: He shoves the application at her.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Probably best if you don't have a
dialog: predator as a partner.
text: As he walks away, he takes off the sticker badge, crumples it
text: and tosses it away.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: No. Nick. Nick!
speaker_heading: REPORTER 5
dialog: Officer Hopps! Were you just
dialog: threatened by that predator?
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: No. He's my friend.

speaker_heading: HOPPS

speaker_heading: RABBIT KID

dialog: Whoa, whoa, whoa!
scene_heading: ADULT GIDEON GREY
dialog: Now there's a 4-dollar word, Mr. H.
dialog: My family always just called them
text: night howlers.
dialog: Wait. What?
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: I'm sorry, what did you say?
text: Stu gestures to the flowers growing on the edge of the crops.
speaker_heading: STU HOPPS
dialog: Oh, Gid's talking about those
dialog: flowers, Judy. I use `em to keep
dialog: bugs off the produce. But I don't
dialog: like the little ones going near `em
dialog: on account of what happened to your
dialog: Uncle Terry.
speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS
dialog: Yeah, Terry ate one whole when we
dialog: were kids and went completely nuts.
speaker_heading: STU HOPPS
dialog: He bit the dickens out of your
dialog: mother.
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: (a dawning realization)
dialog: A bunny can go savage...
text: We stay on Hopps as she pieces it together.
speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS
dialog: Savage? Well, that's a strong word.
dialog: But it did hurt like the devil.
speaker_heading: STU HOPPS
dialog: Well sure it did. There's a sizable
dialog: divot in your arm. I'd call that
dialog: savage.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: (as if doing an equation)
dialog: Night howlers aren't wolves.
dialog: They're flowers. The flowers are
text: making the predators go savage.
dialog: That's it! That's what I've been
dialog: missing!
text: Hopps races away, then turns back.
speaker_heading: HOPPS (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, keys! Keys! Keys! Keys! Hurry!
dialog: Come on! Thank you, I love you bye!
text: Stu tosses her the keys to his pick-up. Hopps jumps into the

speaker_heading: STU HOPPS
dialog: You catch any of that, Bon?
speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS
dialog: Not one bit.
speaker_heading: GIDEON GREY

scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE - LATER

speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Nick? Nick!
text: There's Nick, sitting on a lawn chair under the bridge.
speaker_heading: HOPPS (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, Nick! Night howlers aren't

dialog: think someone is targeting
dialog: predators on purpose and making
dialog: them go savage.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Wow. Isn't that interesting.
text: He gets up, walks under the bridge. She follows.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Wait! Wait, please-- I know you'll
dialog: never forgive me. And I don't blame
dialog: you. I wouldn't forgive me either.
dialog: I was ignorant and irresponsible
dialog: and small-minded... But predators
dialog: shouldn't suffer because of my
dialog: mistakes. I have to fix this, but I
dialog: can't do it without you.
text: He sighs, but still won't look at her.
speaker_heading: HOPPS (CONT'D)
dialog: (getting emotional)
dialog: And after we're done, you can hate
dialog: me, and that'll be fine, because I
dialog: was a horrible friend and I hurt
dialog: you... and you can walk away
dialog: knowing you were right all along, I
dialog: really am just a dumb bunny.
dialog: It seems she lost him, then:
speaker_heading: HOPPS (ON RECORDER) (CONT'D)
dialog: I really am just a dumb bunny. I
dialog: really am just a dumb bunny.
text: Hopps cocks her head. Huh? Nick turns to her... holding her

dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Don't worry, Carrots, I'll let you

text: Hopps sniffles and wipes a tear from her eye.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Alright, get in here.
text: Hopps leans her head on Nick's chest. He gives her a hug.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay. Oh, you bunnies... You're so
dialog: emotional. There we go. Deep
dialog: breath.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Are you just trying to steal the

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: DUKE WEASELTON
dialog: What's it to you, Wilde? Shouldn't

dialog: something?
dialog: (sees Hopps)
dialog: Hey, if it isn't Flopsy the Copsy.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: We both know those weren't moldy
dialog: onions I caught you stealing. What
dialog: were you gonna do with those night
dialog: howlers, Wessleton?
speaker_heading: DUKE WEASELTON
dialog: It's Weaselton. Duke Weaselton. And

speaker_heading: MR. BIG
dialog: (to polar bears)
dialog: Ice this weasel.
speaker_heading: DUKE WEASELTON
dialog: All right, all right, please! I'll
dialog: talk! I'll talk. I stole them night
dialog: howlers so I could sell `em. They
dialog: offered me what I couldn't
dialog: refuse... Money.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: And to whom did you sell them?
speaker_heading: DUKE WEASELTON (PRE-LAP)
dialog: A ram named Doug. We got a drop

scene_heading: EXT. SUBWAY STATION - A LITTLE LATER
text: Nick and Hopps approach an abandoned subway station.
speaker_heading: DUKE WEASELTON (V.O.)
dialog: ...Just watch it. Doug is the

dialog: unfriendly...
text: They arrive at the entrance and quickly sneak under the gate.
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED SUBWAY STATION - MOMENTS LATER
text: They emerge on a platform and spot an abandoned subway car.
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Come on!
text: As they sneak up to it... Hopps pulls open the window and
text: looks inside the car. They both jump into...
scene_heading: INT. THE GREENHOUSE CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: They both see the rows of night howlers.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: The weasel wasn't lying.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yeah, looks like old Doug's
dialog: cornered the market on night
dialog: howlers...
text: Click! A door opens off screen! They quickly hide under a
text: desk as a TOUGH SHEEP LABWORKER enters.
text: He goes through the process of harvesting the pollen,
text: eventually producing a small, blue paint ball pellet of night
text: howler toxin. Nick and Hopps watch it all.
text: The Sheep's phone RINGS.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: You got Doug here. What's the mark?
dialog: Cheetah in Sahara Square. Got it.
text: The Sheep loads a gun, cocks it. We see a MAP with pictures
text: of a various animal targets.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Serious? Yeah, I know they're fast.
dialog: I can hit him. Listen, I hit a tiny
text: little otter through the open
text: window of a moving car.
text: Hearing this, the pieces of the puzzle start falling into
text: place for Hopps. She looks up at the picture of Otterton-- we
text: FLASHBACK to see Doug hitting him with a serum pellet. Then
text: Hopps looks at Manchas's picture-- we FLASHBACK to that.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Yeah I'll buzz you when it's done.
dialog: Or you'll see it on the news. Ya
dialog: know, whichever comes first.
dialog: 97.
text: BAM, BAM, BAM! The goons have returned.
speaker_heading: WOOLTER (O.S.)
dialog: Hey Doug, open up! We've got your
dialog: latte.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Alright, Woolter and Jesse are
dialog: back, so I'm leaving now.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Out.
text: Hopps looks around, what is she going to do. As Doug goes to
text: the door to unlock it, Hopps creeps out of their hiding spot.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Hey. Hey! Where are you going? Get
dialog: back here! What are you doing?!
dialog: He's gonna see you! What are you
dialog: looking at? Hey! Whatever you're
dialog: thinking, stop thinking it.
dialog: Carrots! Carrots!
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: It better have the extra foam this
dialog: time--
text: BAM! Hopps kicks Woolter in the back, knocking him into the
text: other two Thugs. Hopps locks the door.
speaker_heading: WOOLTER (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, open up!
text: The Thugs start banging on the doors.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What are you doing?! You just
dialog: trapped us in here!
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: We need to get this evidence to the
dialog: ZPD.
text: Nick picks up the case.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Okay. Great. Here it is. Got it.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: No. All of it!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Wait, what?
dialog: 98.
text: Hopps rushes to the control room, tries to start the engine.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Great, you're a conductor now? Hey,
dialog: listen-- It would take a miracle to
dialog: get this rust-bucket going.
text: The train starts moving.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Well... Hallelujah!
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN TRACKS - SAME
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: We kinda got a situation at the
dialog: lab...
dialog: (noticing train)
dialog: Oh! It just got worse!
text: Doug and his minions race after the train.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY CAR - SAME
text: Nick and Hopps race away, feeling fairly confident.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Mission accomplished. Would it be
dialog: premature for me to do a little
dialog: victory toot-toot?
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: All right. One toot-toot.
text: Nick blows the train whistle.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Well, I can cross that off the
dialog: bucket list.
dialog: Things are looking up, when:
text: BAM! Woolter just busted into the car. Nick slams the door
text: closed right before Woolter gets to them.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: I may have to rescind that victory
dialog: toot-toot.
dialog: 99.
text: Noise from the roof above them... BAM! BAM! BAM!
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe that's just hail?
text: Uh-oh. Jesse busts through the window. He's stuck, but
text: flailing at Hopps. Nick tries to pull him away.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Back off!
text: Nick gets punched backward and notices Woolter charging
text: toward the door at full speed. Right before Woolter arrives,
text: Nick pulls the door open.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Incoming!
text: Woolter's momentum carries him into Jesse-- dislodging him
text: onto the tracks. Hopps is knocked out the window, but grabs
text: onto Woolter's horn. Hopps tries to hang on as the subway car
text: hurtles down the tunnel.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Carrots?!
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: (to Nick)
dialog: Don't stop! Keep going!
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (about to get run over)
dialog: No! No! Please stop!
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Do not stop this car!
text: Jesse dives to safety and Hopps gets bucked up onto the top
text: of the train. Nick takes the wheel as the train emerges above
text: ground. Hopps looks up to see... Another train coming toward
text: them... on the same track! She sees a turn-off switch ahead.
speaker_heading: HOPPS (CONT'D)
dialog: Speed up, Nick! Speed up!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (staving off Woolter)
dialog: There's another train coming!
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Trust me! SPEED! UP!
text: Woolter sees the train coming and tries to get unstuck, but
text: he can't. He struggles like crazy.
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: WOOLTER
dialog: Stop the train! Hey!
text: Then, at the last second, Hopps appears next to him:
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Hey. Need some help?
text: Hopps kicks Woolter off the train and he lands perfectly on
text: the turn-off switch on the tracks below. At the last possible
text: second, their train switches tracks-- just avoiding the
text: oncoming car.
dialog: Except...
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Oh no! Oh no, no, no! Too fast!
dialog: Hold on!
text: The train derails as it takes the curve. The night howlers
text: catch fire.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: I think this is our stop!
text: Hopps and Nick dive out of the car and onto a subway
text: platform... Just as the lab car EXPLODES.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Okay... Maybe some of the evidence
dialog: survived.
text: A second loud EXPLOSION. The train is destroyed.
speaker_heading: HOPPS (CONT'D)
dialog: Everything is gone. We've lost it
dialog: all.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (shaking head)
dialog: Yeah. Oh, except for this.
text: Nick holds up a case-- containing a gun and a pellet.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Oh, Nick! Yes!
text: Judy SMACKS him on the arm. Hard. Nick grimaces.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Ow.
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Come on! We gotta get to the ZPD.
dialog: Cut through the Natural History
dialog: Museum!
scene_heading: INT. NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM - NIGHT
text: Nick and Hopps race through the empty museum. The ZPD
text: entrance is just ahead.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Oh! There it is!
dialog: They're going to make it.
speaker_heading: BELLWETHER (O.S.)
dialog: Judy! Judy!
text: Judy and Nick stop and turn. There's Bellwether, standing
text: behind them with TWO RAM COPS.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Mayor Bellwether!
dialog: (out of breath, rapidly)
dialog: We found out what's happening.
text: Someone's darting predators with a
dialog: serum-- that's what's making them
dialog: go savage.
speaker_heading: BELLWETHER
dialog: (applauding)
dialog: I am so proud of you, Judy. You did
dialog: just a super job.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Thank you, ma'am.
dialog: (troubling realization)
dialog: How did you know where to find us?
speaker_heading: BELLWETHER
dialog: I'll go ahead and I'll take that
dialog: case now.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: You know what... I think Nick and I
dialog: will just take this to the ZPD...
text: Hopps turns toward the ZPD. Uh oh. One of Bellwether's RAMS
text: is blocking the way. Nick just now gets what's going on.
speaker_heading: HOPPS (CONT'D) NICK
dialog: Run! Run!
dialog: 102.
text: They take off-- away from the ZPD-- down a dark corridor.
speaker_heading: BELLWETHER
dialog: Get them!
text: Hopps looks over her shoulder as she runs-- not seeing a
text: sharp WOOLY MAMMOTH TUSK sticking out. It slashes her leg,
text: knocking her off her feet.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Ach!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Ah Carrots!
text: Nick goes to her. Her leg is bleeding badly.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: I got ya, come here, come here.
text: He carries her behind a pillar.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, now just relax.
text: Nick digs a handkerchief from his pocket. A few BLUEBERRIES
text: fall out with it.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Whoops... Blueberry?
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Pass.
speaker_heading: BELLWETHER (O.S.)
dialog: Come on out, Judy!
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Take the case. Get it to Bogo.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I'm not gonna leave you behind.
dialog: That's not happening.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: I can't walk.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Just, we'll think of something.
text: Bellwether finally appears, flanked by the Rams.
speaker_heading: BELLWETHER
dialog: We're on the same team, Judy!
dialog: 103.
scene_heading: WITH BELLWETHER &amp; THUGS --
text: Bellwether talks as they look for Hopps and Nick...
speaker_heading: BELLWETHER
dialog: Underestimated. Under-appreciated.
dialog: Aren't you sick of it? Predators.
dialog: They may be strong and loud, but
dialog: prey out-number predators 10 to
dialog: one.
text: Bellwether sees a SHADOW-- RABBIT EARS. She gestures to the
dialog: RAMS-- there they are.
speaker_heading: BELLWETHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Think of it-- 90 percent of the
dialog: population, united against a common
dialog: enemy. We'll be unstoppable.
text: The Rams are about to pounce on Hopps and Nick... only to
text: find the shadow is coming from a MUMMIFIED JACKALOPE being
text: illuminated by a shop light.
speaker_heading: BELLWETHER (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Goons)
dialog: Over there!
text: Hopps and Nick are making a run for it. They're going to make
dialog: it to the ZPD! When suddenly...
text: BAM! A RAM tackles them both, knocking the case out of Nick's
text: paws. Both of them fall into a sunken diorama. Bellwether,
text: with case in hand, looks over the edge.
speaker_heading: BELLWETHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, you should have stayed on the
dialog: carrot farm, huh? It really is too
dialog: bad; I really did like you.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: What are you going to do? Kill me?
speaker_heading: BELLWETHER
dialog: No! Of course not... he is.
text: Bellwether takes the dart gun out of the case, aims at Nick
text: and... THWICK! She darts him.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: No! Nick?!
text: Nick starts to shake and crouch. Bellwether dials her phone.
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: BELLWETHER
dialog: Yes, police! There's a savage fox
text: in the natural history museum.
dialog: Officer Hopps is down! Please
dialog: hurry!
text: Nick is starting to turn.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: No. Nick, don't do this. Fight it.
speaker_heading: BELLWETHER
dialog: Oh, but he can't help it, can he?
dialog: Since preds are just biologically
text: predisposed to be savages.
text: Nick stalks Hopps, who tries to limp away.
speaker_heading: BELLWETHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Gosh, think of the headline: "Hero
dialog: Cop Killed By Savage Fox..."
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: So that's it, prey fears predator,
dialog: and you stay in power?
speaker_heading: BELLWETHER
dialog: Yeah, pretty much.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: It won't work.
speaker_heading: BELLWETHER
dialog: Fear always works. And I'll dart
dialog: every predator in Zootopia to keep
dialog: it that way.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: (as Nick stalks her)
dialog: Oh, Nick! No!
speaker_heading: BELLWETHER
dialog: Bye-Bye, Bunny.
text: Nick lunges. He attacks. Hopps screams. Bellwether smiles.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Blood, blood, blood! And death.
text: Bellwether looks confused. Nick stands up.
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: All right, you're milking it.
dialog: Besides, I think we got it, I think
dialog: we got it. We got it up there,
dialog: thank you yakkety-yak-- you laid it
text: all out beautifully.
speaker_heading: BELLWETHER
dialog: What?
text: Bellwether looks at her gun, in disbelief.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yea, oh, are you looking for the
dialog: serum?
dialog: (holds it up)
dialog: Well, it's right here.
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: What you've got in the weapon there-
dialog: - those are blueberries. From my
dialog: family's farm.
text: Livid, Bellwether sees a blueberry in the gun's chamber.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: They are delicious.
dialog: (licking fingers)
dialog: You should try some.
speaker_heading: BELLWETHER
dialog: I framed Lionheart, I can frame you
dialog: too! It's my word against yours!
speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: Oooo, actually--
text: Hopps holds up the carrot pen.
scene_heading: BELLWETHER (ON CARROT PEN RECORDER)
dialog: And I'll dart every predator in

speaker_heading: HOPPS
dialog: --It's your word against yours.
dialog: It's called a hustle, sweetheart.
dialog: Boom.
text: Bogo and a TEAM OF COPS burst onto the scene. Bellwether
