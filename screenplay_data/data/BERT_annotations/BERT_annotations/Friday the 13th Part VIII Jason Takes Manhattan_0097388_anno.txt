scene_heading: FRIDAY THE 13TH PART VIII: JASON TAKES MANHATTAN
dialog: Written by Rob Hedden
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT
text: A dark, rumbling sky. Haze clings to the lake as we float
text: across it, clearing to bring the opposite shoreline into
text: view. A few scattered streetlights. Dilapidated cabins.
text: An abandoned campsite. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE.
text: We continue to drift towards it, hearing the faint sound
text: of seductive music and an occasional giggle. A small
text: HOUSEBOAT floats into our foreground, its interior light
text: flickering as TWO BODIES move around inside.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT
text: A teenage boy and girl, JIM and SUZY, are slow-dancing.
text: Jim's lips softly touch her lissome shoulders.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Well...how do you feel?
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: Ask me in about five minutes.
text: She bites his ear, giggles, then kisses him fully..
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I'm talking about graduation. Being
dialog: totally free to do whatever we want
dialog: now.
text: Her hands slip inside his Pendleton shirt. He sighs.
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: It feels excellent.
text: Her mouth finds his again. After a long kiss, he gently
text: pulls away from her with a teasing smile.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Gotta throw the anchor over.
text: He leaves the cabin. She slips under the bed sheets.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSEBOAT DECK - NIGHT
text: as Jim tosses a small anchor overboard.
scene_heading: TIGHT ON WATER SURFACE
text: as the weighty object splashes, sinking into black
text: oblivion, pulling its cable down with it.
speaker_heading: JIM
text: glances at the lake, at their eerie surroundings. He
text: feels a chill, heading back inside.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)
text: as the anchor drifts to the lake bottom, dropping a few
text: feet from a THICK POWER CABLE which rests in the lake
dialog: silt.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT
text: as Jim returns with an uneasy expression. He crawls on
text: top of the bed, kissing her again, but not with the same
dialog: enthusiasm as before.
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Nothing.
text: He starts to pull off his shirt and join her. She senses
dialog: his anxiety.
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: C'mon, Jimmy. Something's bothering
dialog: you.
text: Jim pauses, turning off the mood music.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: It's just that we're right around that
dialog: old summer camp where all those
dialog: murders took place.
text: The boat creaks. She's instantly nervous.
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: What murders?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Never mind, you don't want to know
dialog: about it.
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: Tell me.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: There's nothing to worry about, Suzy.
text: The guy's dead now, somewhere at the
dialog: bottom of this lake...if you believe
dialog: the stories.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Let's drop it, okay?
text: He starts to kiss her again. She stops him.
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: What stories?
text: He doesn't want to go into it but Suzy's face insists.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: There was this boy named Jason
dialog: Voorhees who drowned in Crystal
dialog: Lake...
speaker_heading: FLASHBACK
text: Eight year old JASON is desperately trying to tread
text: water, flailing his arms like a marionette to get
text: attention as he gulps down gallons of mossy lake water.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JASON
dialog: Hhhhelp....me....I'm drowning...
speaker_heading: JIM (V.O.)
dialog: None of the counselors heard him.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JASON
dialog: Mmmmmmommy....
text: ...And Jason finally slips under the surface for good.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: A bunch of years went by and everybody
dialog: forgot about it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That's when the murders started.
speaker_heading: FLASHBACK MONTAGE (STOCK)
text: as our senses are bombarded with QUICK CUTS of assorted
text: teenagers just about to die, their screams echoing over
text: each other. We do not see the attacker. As the
text: cacophony reaches a screeching crescendo, CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT
text: as the silence hits us hard again.
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: Jason did it...?
speaker_heading: JIM'
dialog: That's what some people thought. But
dialog: they were wrong.
speaker_heading: FLASHBACK (STOCK)
text: as MRS. VOORHEES comes directly at camera wielding a huge
text: knife and a primal scream.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: His mother blamed the counselors for
text: his death and tried to kill them all.
dialog: (dramatic pause)
text: She got her head chopped off by one of
dialog: them.
dialog: We don't need to see this clip...Suzy's reaction is quite
dialog: sufficient.
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: So the murders stopped?
text: He gives her a long, penetrating look.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: FLASHBACK MONTAGE (STOCK)
text: We're bombarded with QUICK FLASHES of a hockey masked
text: JASON wreaking havoc on assorted teenagers...brandishing
text: everything from hatchets to knives to chainsaws. Just as
text: Jason is about to stab us, CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT
text: Suzy flinches as if she were getting the knife.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Legend has it that Jason came back to
text: avenge his mother's death, vowing to
dialog: kill every teenager from the area.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And every now and then, the murders
text: start up again.
text: The boat lurches slightly, tugging at the anchor cable.
text: She's scared: he's frightened himself a little, too.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Forget about it, Suzy. They're just
dialog: stories.
text: He brushes her hair back, kissing her cheek gently,
text: finding the nape of her neck again. She closes her eyes,
text: trying to dismiss what he's dredged up. But she can't.
text: Suzy begins to rationalize.
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: We're the last graduating class,
dialog: right?
text: Jim's kissing her body, putting Jason behind him.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: I mean, Lakeview High just closed its
dialog: doors for good, right?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: So there's no reason for him to come
dialog: back because there won't be any of us
dialog: around...right?
text: Jim stops, looking her squarely in the eyes.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Right. Except that Jason isn't real
dialog: so none of it matters anyway.
text: She starts to relax, returning his kisses.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)
text: as the anchor drifts along the lake floor, tugging hard
text: on the power cable. Camera TRACKS along the cable,
text: coming to a RUSTY SET OF CHAINS TANGLED AROUND IT.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS
text: as Jim slides on top of Suzy. Thoughts of Jason are
text: starting to slip away along with their clothes.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)
text: as the chains emit a dull tinkle due to movement from the
text: tugging anchor. Camera continues to TRACK again...and we
text: find to our horror that the waterlogged, fish-eaten body
text: of JASON IS SECURED BY THESE SAME CHAINS. (NOTE: Jason's
text: face is obscured.)
scene_heading: INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS
text: Teenagers in love, lost in not-so-innocent passion. At
dialog: the same moment:
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)
text: The anchor tugs one last time and RIPS THROUGH THE CABLE.
text: SPARKS INSTANTLY FLY, chasing along the cable, finding
text: the chain which secures Jason and ENGULFING HIM IN
scene_heading: ELECTRICITY.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSEBOAT - ON LAKE SURFACE (EFX)
text: as BRIGHT FLASHES OF BLUE LIGHT strobe-under the surface.
text: ARCING CURRENT chases up the anchor cable, sparking
text: across the hoist.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - WIDE SHOT FROM WATER
text: as the electricity feeding the streetlights is abruptly
text: extinguished, plunging the campsite into darkness.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS
text: as Suzy's eyes flash open.
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: Did you hear that?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Hear what?
text: He pulls her back down.
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: C'mon, I'm serious.
text: He knows the mood is broken.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: All right, I'll check it out.
text: He slips on his jeans, exiting the cabin. She pulls the
text: sheet up around her fearfully.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)
text: as the cable smolders, void of electricity now. TRACK to
text: find the chains again...but they're dangling loosely.
dialog: JASON IS GONE.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS
text: Suzy is tensely kneeling on the bed now. The black void
text: of night is all she sees out the cabin door, which Jim
text: has left open. An uncomfortable amount of time passes.
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: Jimmy...?
text: No answer. Her heart starts to pound.
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: Jim...?
text: Again, nothing. She wraps herself in the sheet, moving
text: towards the open door. The ship creaks again.
scene_heading: SUZY'S POINT OF VIEW
text: as she grows closer to the doorway, nothing but pitch-
text: black beyond it.
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: Stop screwing around, Jim. I mean
dialog: it...
text: ...And just as she reaches the door:
text: A HOCKEY MASKED MONSTER
text: leaps out, clutching a HUGE KNIFE. Suzy barely has time
text: to scream before JASON PLUNGES THE KNIFE INTO HER CHEST.
speaker_heading: SUZY
text: stands there in speechless shock, looking down at her
text: mortal wound. But there's no blood.
speaker_heading: THE MONSTER
text: pulls the knife back out, pushing the blade in and out
text: with his hand. It's a retractable rubber knife. JIM
text: pulls off the hockey mask with a huge grin, tossing it
dialog: aside.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Gotcha good, baby cakes.
text: She doesn't know whether to hug him with relief or kick
text: him in the balls. He pulls her back onto the bed,
text: laughing.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSEBOAT - CLOSE ON HOCKEY MASK
text: sitting dormant on the deck, where Jim tossed it. A
text: SHADOW FALLS ACROSS IT...followed by a SLIMY, DECOMPOSING
text: HAND. The hand grabs it like it's an old friend, pulling
dialog: it away.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS
text: as Jim holds his angry girlfriend down on the bed, trying
text: unsuccessfully to kiss her.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: All right, all right -- I'm a major
dialog: ass.
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: And you'll never do it again.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: And I'll never do it again. Forgive
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: No.
text: She's resisting only for effect. Her legs curl around
text: him, finally giving in.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT
text: A deadly-sharp SPEAR GUN rests in its rack outside the
text: cabin. JASON'S HAND REMOVES IT.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS
text: The sheets begin to roll like waves as they work each
text: other. Thoughts of Jason are nonexistent now.
scene_heading: ANGLE - CABIN DOOR
text: Nothing there for a moment...then a pair of moss-covered
text: BARE FEET SLOSH INTO FRAME.
speaker_heading: SUZY
text: closes her eyes with pleasure...
scene_heading: ANGLE - CABIN DOOR
text: ...and camera RISES from the mossy feet, up the bloodless
text: legs and torso to ultimately reveal the hockey-masked
text: face of our anti-hero: JASON VOORHEES.
speaker_heading: SUZY
text: lets out a broad smile, her eyelids fluttering. They stay
text: open long enough to regard the visitor in the doorway.
text: She tries to choke out a warning to Jim, who's just
dialog: collapsed himself.
speaker_heading: SUZY
speaker_heading: JJJJJJJJason...
text: He doesn't follow her glance, smiling instead.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Uh-huh. You must really think I'm an
dialog: ass.
text: But she continues to stare in horror as:
speaker_heading: JASON
text: raises the spear, taking aim.
scene_heading: ANGLE - SUZY AND JIM
text: Hs starts to kiss her but she bolts up with a blood-
text: curdling SCREAM. A second later, JASON FIRES THE SPEAR,
text: PIERCING HER NECK, PINNING HER TO THE HEAD BOARD.
text: Jim stares point-blank at his dead girlfriend, not able
text: to assimilate it quickly enough. He spins around to see
dialog: the monster himself.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Ohmygod...
text: Jim springs off the bed, looking around for anything to
text: defend himself with, grabbing the bedside lamp. He
text: SMASHES IT OVER JASON'S HEAD which has little effect. Jim
text: scrambles to get past him, but Jason LIFTS JIM IN THE
text: AIR, SLAMMING HIM DOWN ON ONE OF THE SPIKED BEDPOSTS.
scene_heading: EXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT
text: as the HOUSEBOAT silently drifts onward. The lone
text: silhouette of Jason emerges from within, taking the helm.
text: He's back.
scene_heading: FADE OUT/MAIN CREDITS.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. HARBOR - ESTABLISHING - DAY
text: Only the faintest sign of daylight can be seen through a
text: thick blanket of gray fog. In the distance, speckled
text: lights outlining a smaller LUXURY CRUISE SHIP
text: intermittently appear.
scene_heading: EXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY
text: Standing at the boarding ramp is CHARLES MCCULLOCH,
text: clipboard in hand. He's just finished checking off a pair
text: of new-agey SENIOR GIRLS. McCulloch is approaching fifty,
text: wearing a tie and unwrinkled clothes, as well as the
text: disposition of a stern puritan.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Remember girls, the shuffleboard
dialog: tournament will start at six p.m.
dialog: sharp. A non-attendance will restrict
dialog: your time in port, understood?
text: They nod for his benefit, exchanging derogatory whispers
text: as they head up the ramp. Camera ADJUSTS to find a small
text: parking lot adjacent to the docks, where several cars are
text: just now arriving -- parents dropping off their high
text: school seniors, hugging them bon voyage.
scene_heading: CLOSER ANGLE PARKING LOT
text: as SEAN ROBERTSON walks toward the ship with pal MILES
text: WOLFE. Sean's a tall, nice looking, somewhat serious guy;
text: Miles is shorter, athletic and more extroverted.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You're telling me this boat has a pool
dialog: with a three meter board?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: It's a ship and that's right. Plus a
text: disco, gym, game room and a lot more.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I think I'm gonna blow off New York
dialog: and just stay on this thing.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: You'll do no such thing, Mr. Wolfe...
text: Camera ADJUSTS to reveal McCulloch, holding his list,
dialog: checking off their names.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Your itinerary has been carefully
dialog: planned and make no mistake, it will
dialog: be executed accordingly.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Of course...wouldn't want to risk
dialog: enjoying this trip.
text: McCulloch gives him a frown. Sean steps up to him
dialog: tentatively.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr.
dialog: McCulloch?
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Rennie's not coming.
text: He's devastated.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: But I thought...
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: She changed her mind.
dialog: (eyeing list)
dialog: Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom
dialog: one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are
dialog: in two-twenty-five.
text: A booming VOICE from above interrupts them:
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL ROBERTSON (O.S.)
dialog: Sean -- where the hell have you been?
dialog: We're already into early departure
dialog: protocol...
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Standing on the upper deck is a no-nonsense, uniformed
text: Navy man, ADMIRAL ROBERTSON. The captain of the ship. And
text: Sean's father. Sean's sadness about Rennie's absence is
text: immediately replaced with anxiety.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Be right up, Dad.
text: He and Miles head up the gangway, both boys giving
text: McCulloch one last glare.
scene_heading: INT. '76 BMW 2002 - DAY
text: Behind the wheel is MISS COLLEEN VAN DEUSEN, thirties,
text: attractive, a progressive attitude. RENNIE WICKHAM sits
text: next to her -- she's seventeen, pretty, slightly
text: withdrawn. Rennie's dog TOBY, a border collie, rides in
text: the back seat.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: I'm glad you decided to come after
dialog: all.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles
dialog: will be.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: You let me worry about him, okay?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Personal experiences are what fuel the
dialog: minds of great writers, Rennie. You
dialog: made the right decision.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: What about not-so-great writers?
text: Rennie smiles self-deprecatingly, Miss Van Deusen
text: grinning back. But Rennie's smiles are few and far
text: between, this one disappearing as she glances out the
dialog: window.
scene_heading: RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (SECOND UNIT)
text: as the countless gallons of harbor and lake water spread
text: out before her, eery in the bog. A small ROWBOAT grazes
text: across it occupied by two indistinguishable people.
dialog: RETURN TO SHOT
text: Rennie's eyes show a hidden terror. She quickly turns
text: away, shivering briefly. Miss Van Deusen notices. She
text: turns a corner, heading into the parking lot.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: Everything okay?
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: Just felt a little chill.
text: Rennie rubs her arms, faking coldness.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: Did you know that I'm giving up
dialog: teaching?
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
text: Since the school is closing anyway,
dialog: I'm going to write that novel I've
dialog: been threatening on everybody.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: That's wonderful, Miss Van
dialog: Deusen...what's it about?
text: She parks the car, turning off the ignition.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
text: A senior class cruise to Manhattan,
dialog: laced with romance, adventure and
dialog: murder.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Or a Gothic cook book. I haven't
dialog: decided which.
text: She's coaxed the smile out of Rennie again. Miss Van
text: Deusen pulls a small wrapped box from her glove
text: compartment, handing it to Rennie, who seems utterly
dialog: surprised.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: Go on, open it.
text: Rennie pops off the lid, revealing an antique ink-dip
dialog: pen.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: Stephen King supposedly used it when
dialog: he was in high school.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: I don't know what to say...
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: Rennie, you're the best student I ever
dialog: had...you have a real gift. If anybody
dialog: can make use of that pen, it's you.
text: Rennie hugs her teacher. Camera RISES above the car's
text: window, finding a Mercedes 560 SL pulling in a short
text: distance away.
scene_heading: CLOSER ANGLE - MERCEDES
text: A sexy, money-dressed blonde is behind the wheel. TAMARA
text: MASON. She climbs from her leather seats as a trio of
text: SENIOR GIRLS walk by, offering enthusiastic hi's and
text: hellos. She's obviously Miss Popular. Tamara crosses to a
text: cute Japanese girl unloading luggage from a beige Honda,
scene_heading: EVA WATANABE.
speaker_heading: . TAMARA
dialog: Are you ready for drugs, sex and rock
dialog: 'n roll or what, girl?
text: Eva gives her a warning glance, nodding to her left.
text: Eva's MOTHER appears by the passenger door, forcing a
text: smile at Tamara.
scene_heading: MRS. WATANABE
dialog: Hello, Tamara.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Hi, Mrs. Watanabe. Just kidding.
scene_heading: MRS. WATANABE
dialog: Yes, I'm sure.
text: Embarrassed, Eva hurries to her Mom, rushing a kiss
dialog: goodbye.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Don't worry about a thing, Mom. I'll
dialog: have a terrific time and I won't do
dialog: anything stupid, okay?
text: Before Mrs. Watanabe can squeeze a word in, her daughter
text: is gone. She waves a bittersweet goodbye to her graduate.
scene_heading: MRS. WATANABE
dialog: I love you...
text: TRACKING WITH TAMARA AND EVA
text: Once they're out of Mrs. Watanabe's earshot --
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: I hear the crew members are cute guys
text: in their twenties.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: I'm sure we'll have no problem getting
dialog: them to party with us...especially
dialog: with this.
text: Tamara unzips her purse, revealing a baggie filled with
text: fine white powder. Eva looks very nervous.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It
dialog: cost over a thousand bucks but it's
dialog: the best.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: He bought you that?
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: More or less. It's part of my college
dialog: fund.
dialog: 
text: She grins coquettishly, walking on. Camera HOLDS on the
text: calm, foggy harbor...where the faint image of a HOUSEBOAT
text: is aimlessly drifting into port.
scene_heading: CLOSER ANGLE - HOUSEBOAT
dialog: Sure enough, it's the same one we saw JASON on last
text: night...but no one is behind the helm. It seems to be a
dialog: ghost ship.
scene_heading: EXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY
text: as Tamara tries to slip past McCulloch, busy with another
text: pair of seniors.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: You can stop right there, Miss Mason.
text: He motions the others onward. Busted. Tamara instantly
text: hands Eva her drug-filled purse, paralyzing Eva.
speaker_heading: MCCULL40CH
dialog: Only graduating seniors are allowed on
dialog: this cruise.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCB
dialog: You never turned in your final biology
dialog: project, so I've had your diploma
dialog: rescinded.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: You can't do that...
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: It's already been done.
dialog: (turning to Eva)
dialog: Congratulations on the 3.9 average,
dialog: Miss Watanabe. You're in stateroom two-
text: fifty-five.
text: Eva smiles awkwardly, reaching for her luggage, stalling
dialog: to see what happens with Tamara.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Look, Mr. McCulloch, I got in a car
dialog: accident yesterday and missed our
dialog: appointment. It's okay, no big deal,
dialog: just a bruised arm...
dialog: (squeezes her arm)
dialog: ...so I brought my project along
dialog: today. It's in my suitcase. Really.
text: He looks at her suitcase, not buying a word of this.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: She's telling the truth, Mr.
dialog: McCulloch. I saw her pack it.
text: He's surprised to hear this...and so is Tamara.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: All right. But if it mysteriously
dialog: disappears en route, I'll have you
dialog: sent back home the minute we dock.
dialog: Understood?
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Perfectly.
text: She grabs her purse back from Eva, quickly moving on
text: before he changes his mind. Their voices become whispers.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
text: A major prick.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: What are you going to do?
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Improvise, of course.
scene_heading: EXT. DOCK PILINGS - SAME TIME
text: as the HOUSEBOAT haphazardly bumps into barnacle-covered
text: dock pilings, still around fifty yards from the cruise
dialog: ship.
text: POINT OF VIEW OUT HOUSEBOAT WINDOW
text: The window is splattered with blood, but still clear
text: enough to make out Tamara and Eva walking up the gangway,
text: along with a half dozen other teenagers mingling on
dialog: board.
scene_heading: TIGHT ON HOUSEBOAT'S ANCHOR CABLE
text: --or rather the remnants of it. It's a piece of frayed
text: woven metal charred by extreme electricity, severed just
text: above water level. Suddenly there's blurry movement
text: behind it; camera RACK FOCUSES just in time to catch a
text: glimpse of JASON SLIPPING OFF THE SIDE, FLOATING TOWARDS
text: THE PILINGS.
scene_heading: EXT. DOCKSIDE - SAME TIME
text: as McCulloch impatiently checks his watch and list again.
text: Miss Van Deusen walks up to him.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked
dialog: in?
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never
dialog: showed up. I'm a little concerned.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: Don't be. They probably decided to
dialog: explore each other rather than New
dialog: York.
text: He gives her a disdainful look, starting up the ramp.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Let's go -- we're running two minutes
dialog: late.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: Charles, there's someone else coming
dialog: along too.
text: He stops, following her glance. His face tightens.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Rennie is walking toward them with a small suitcase, her
text: dog Toby striding next to her. She walks up to him,
text: starts to say something, then decides against it. Rennie
text: heads up the gangway. HOLD on McCulloch and Miss Van
text: Deusen. He's livid.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: You have no right...
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: And neither do you. It's up to Rennie
dialog: to decide what she wants to do.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: She doesn't know what she wants. She's
dialog: never had a stable life.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: And she sure doesn't have one now,
dialog: either. She needs to live.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: I'm her legal guardian, not you or
dialog: anybody else, and I alone know what's
dialog: best for her. End of discussion.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: No, I think it's just the beginning.
text: She walks past him.
scene_heading: EXT. RAMP/SHIP - ON RENNIE
text: as she reaches the top of the gangway, her heart
text: pounding. Rennie pauses, working up the courage to look
text: out at the lake again.
scene_heading: RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW
text: The ROWBOAT she saw earlier is still there, even closer
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: RENNIE'S PUPILS
text: contract, her blood pumping faster. Then she hears a
text: FAINT VOICE BELOW HER...
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Hhhhelp me...
text: Rennie looks straight down at the water beneath her and
dialog: sees:
scene_heading: AN EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY
text: floundering in the water. It takes us only a moment to
text: recognize him -- IT'S YOUNG JASON. He's gasping, sucking
text: in huge amounts of liquid, exactly like he did in the
dialog: prologue.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JASON
dialog: Hhhhelp me....I'm drowning...
speaker_heading: RENNIE
text: leans back in terror, falling into Miss Van Deusen.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: What's wrong, Rennie??
text: Rennie frantically points over the ramp edge, unable to
text: speak. Miss Van Deusen quickly looks and sees:
scene_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN'S POINT OF VIEW
text: The water is calm. No Young Jason.
dialog: RETURN TO SHOT
text: as Rennie gets a hold of herself.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: I just got a little dizzy. I'm fine.
text: She continues up the ramp. HOLD on Miss Van Deusen,
text: watching her go, somewhat troubled by it. RACK to
text: McCulloch below her, also watching. Extremely concerned.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
text: continues along the starboard side, not risking another
text: glance overboard. She passes an older, very deranged DECK
text: HAND, mopping the deck. HOLD on him, his bloodshot eyes
text: following her like a crazed raven.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE - CLOSE ON HARPOON - DAY
text: Sharp and rusty, mounted on the wall amidst jagged
text: scaling knives, shark jaws and other artifacts. WIDEN to
text: reveal they are surrounding a navigational chart on the
text: cruise ship's bridge. Admiral Robertson and his CHIEF
text: ENGINEER are preparing for departure, checking the OMEGA
text: satellite computer as well as the LORAN.
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
dialog: (checking watch)
dialog: Let's take in the brow.
speaker_heading: CHIEF ENGINEER
dialog: Yes Sir.
dialog: (into intercom phone.)
dialog: Take in the gangway and single up all
dialog: lines.
text: SEAN and MILES enter the room; Sean gets a glance from
text: his Dad. Miles is very impressed with the bridge.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Hello, Dad.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Hey, Admiral Robertson. Love your
dialog: ship.
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
dialog: She's a beauty, isn't she? I should've
dialog: retired from the Navy ten years ago.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You've really been generous to give us
dialog: this cruise. I know I speak for
text: everybody on board.
text: Everybody...with the possible exception of Sean. He
text: avoids eye contact with his father.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
dialog: Hell, there's just twenty or so of you
dialog: -- we only need a skeleton crew and
dialog: it's a pleasure to sail her anyway.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: By the way, congratulations on winning
dialog: the intramural diving championships,
dialog: Miles. I'm sure you made your old man
dialog: proud.
text: Admiral Robertson gives his own son a glance; maybe Sean
dialog: should think about doing the same.
speaker_heading: CHIEF ENGINEER
dialog: Have you decided on your departure
dialog: protocol, Admiral?
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
dialog: Actually, I thought I'd leave the
dialog: honors to my son.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Dad, I don't think...
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
dialog: (to Chief Engineer, ignoring
dialog: Sean)
dialog: Relinquishing command of the Princess
dialog: Ruby to Captain Sean Robertson.
text: Sean has no say in the matter. Miles can feel his
text: friend's nervousness as well.
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
dialog: But before you take the helm, take
dialog: this.
text: He tosses Sean a wrapped box. Sean opens it. Inside is a
text: navigational computer the size of a calculator, sitting
text: next to a rusty old sextant.
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
dialog: Something old and something new. I
dialog: used the sextant when I was your age,
dialog: but now they have these goddamn
dialog: computers to do all the work for you.
speaker_heading: CHIEF ENGINEER
dialog: (to Sean)
dialog: Have you decided on a plan of
dialog: departure, Captain?
text: Sean's nervous. He eyes the Omega, quickly glancing at
text: the LORAN, briefly referring to the navigational chart.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: How about if we start up the forward
dialog: engines and come around. 180
dialog: degrees...
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
dialog: Aren't you forgetting something?
text: Sean looks flustered. Admiral Robertson storms to a
text: large button, pressing it three times, piercing the air
text: with three long blasts of the ship's horn. It
text: underscores his frustration.
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
dialog: We're in foggy weather! Send out the
dialog: international maritime signal that a
text: vessel is backing down, followed by a
dialog: security broadcast warning other
dialog: ships!
text: He shoves the mike out at Sean, but he doesn't grab it,
text: leaving the bridge, humiliated. There's an awkward moment
text: for Miles, unable to find any appropriate words. He exits
text: as well. Admiral Robertson stares out the bridge window,
dialog: saddened and frustrated. It wasn't supposed to go this
dialog: way.
scene_heading: EXT. DECK - ON SEAN
text: as he continues away, his retreat blocked by the DECK
text: HAND. The crazy old man pierces a dead serious stare at
dialog: Sean.
speaker_heading: DECK HAND
dialog: This voyage is doomed.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Yeah, tell me about it.
text: Sean sidesteps him, moving on.
scene_heading: EXT. HARBOR - DAY (CRANE SHOT)
text: Parents and relatives wave gleefully from the docks as
text: CAMERA RISES AND ROTATES to find eighteen or so teenagers
text: 1ining the upper deck, happily waving back. The ship
text: begins to slice through serene water. The voyage has
dialog: begun.
scene_heading: CLOSER ON HULL
text: The water begins to ripple as the ship's speed increases.
text: All seems normal...until JASON'S HANDS APPEAR, CLINGING
text: TO A LOOSE MOORING LINE DRAGGING IN THE WATER. He
text: slithers up the side towards the deck as dense fog
text: breezes past him.
scene_heading: EXT. DECK - DAY
text: as Sean continues along, hands in pockets. He turns a
text: corner and collides with RENNIE, walking her dog. His
text: eyes instantly brighten, as do hers.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Rennie...
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: Hi, Sean.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I heard you weren't coming.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: (glances at Toby)
dialog: We changed our minds.
text: Sean pats her dog. There's an awkward pause...they are
text: obviously in the early stages-of a relationship.
text: Sean reaches into his coat pocket, bringing back a small
text: necklace-sized box.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I got you a present.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: But I didn't get you one...
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Forget it. It's a dumb little thing
dialog: anyway.
text: Rennie opens it up, exposing a petite silver necklace
text: with a Statue of Liberty pendant on it. She's touched.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: Sean...it's beautiful.
text: Sean takes it from her, snapping it around her neck.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I thought maybe we could hike to the
dialog: top of the Statue when we got there,
dialog: if you felt like it. It's supposed to
dialog: be 22 stories tall.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: I'd love to.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH (O.S.)
dialog: Your father was looking for you, Mr.
dialog: Robertson.
text: McCulloch appears behind them. The mood has been broken.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I guess I'll see you later.
text: Sean leaves. McCulloch steps up to Rennie, pointing out
text: to the foggy sea. Her respiration increases as she
text: psyches herself up to look.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: There's a storm predicted tonight.
text: Rennie looks at the ocean, forcing herself not to turn
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: You're making a big mistake, Rennie.
dialog: It's not too late to put you back on
dialog: land.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: I'm staying.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you
dialog: were of...
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: She didn't push me into coming.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Why are you doing this to yourself?
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: I don't even know why I'm afraid,
dialog: Uncle Charles. I can't even remember
dialog: when it started. Don't you think it's
dialog: time I found out and got over it?
text: He takes a measured pause.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Facing your fear doesn't always
dialog: conquer it.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: I'm staying.
dialog: He's not going to change her mind.
scene_heading: P.O.V. - RENNIE AND MCCULLOCH (B &amp; W/VIEWFINDER MATTE)
text: through a porthole window...and through the viewfinder
text: of a video camcorder. McCulloch shakes his head, turning
text: away from Rennie and walking away. A sinister electric
text: guitar solo screeches out. PAN with McCulloch as he
text: passes the window, coming around 180 degrees into a CLOSE
text: UP of J.J. JARRETT, fingering a sleek Gibson "Flying V."
dialog: J.J.
dialog: (into camera)
dialog: Is this axe awesome or what?
scene_heading: INT. J.J.'S STATEROOM - DAY
text: as J.J., a female rocker in the vein of band "Vixen,"
text: continues to wail on her guitar. She's wearing a black
text: leather corset, with wildly teased deep red hair. Holding
text: the camcorder is WAYNE WEBBER, MTV-acclimated, wearing
text: the latest hip prescription glasses.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Too cool, J.J. Your parents came
dialog: through.
text: She pops out the guitar cable from her practice amp.
dialog: J.J.
dialog: No lie. I hear there's a big power
dialog: room down below where I can get
dialog: supreme concert hall echo. Come down
dialog: and shoot a basement tape on me, okay?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Sure...but I gotta shoot some
text: shockumentary footage first.
text: He avoids eye contact when he says it. She gives him a
dialog: look.
dialog: J.J.
dialog: Man, don't tell me you're still trying
dialog: to scam on Tamara...
text: His non-answer means yes. J.J. walks over to him,
text: grabbing his cheeks, shaking them like jello.
dialog: J.J.
dialog: How long have we known each other?
dialog: Don't be a dweeb, Wayne. She's not
dialog: interested in you, only what you can
dialog: do for her. She's a user.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: She's sexy.
dialog: J.J.
dialog: So's this guitar. So what?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I'll catch you later.
dialog: 
text: He exits. She mumbles something under her breath, coiling
text: up her amp cord.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - TRACKING WITH WAYNE
text: as he walks onward. DROP DOWN to find his FEET as he
text: passes a DARK ALCOVE...which happens to have SLIMY
text: FOOTPRINTS AND SEAWEED leading into it. Camera FOLLOWS
text: the footprints, RISING again and with dim recognition,
text: our eyes fall on JASON. Lurking in the shadows. But not
dialog: for long.
scene_heading: INT. POWER ROOM - DAY
text: Massive, very dark, backlit steam seeping from a maze of
text: pipes overhead. No windows. A wall of circuit breakers
text: and voltage meters decorate one wall, quietly humming
text: generators on the opposite side. J.J. appears with her
text: guitar, amp and ghetto blaster, appreciative of the
dialog: surroundings.
dialog: J.J.
text: This place is aching for a video.
dialog: Wayne, you're an asshole.
text: She finds an outlet and plugs in her equipment.
scene_heading: JASON'S POINT OF VIEW
text: We're peering at J.J. predatorially through the steam,
text: moving through it, behind the generators.
dialog: J.J.
text: pops a cassette into her blaster, jamming the "play"
text: button. A loud rock 'n roll rhythm track blasts out.
scene_heading: JASON'S POINT OF VIEW
text: moving around the generators, eyeing her sleek leather
text: pants as she bends over to plug in her axe.
scene_heading: TIGHT ON ELECTRIC GUITAR
text: as J.J. snaps the male end of the plug into the female.
text: receptacle.
speaker_heading: JASON'S FACE
text: appears for an instant through the vapor, then vanishes.
dialog: 
dialog: J.J.
text: screams out the opening licks of her solo in sync with
text: her playback. The generators are causing a breeze which
text: makes her hair dance, steam flowing between her legs.
text: She's lost in her music, building to a crescendo, bending
text: the high "E" string above the upper octave fret. She
text: opens her eyes with the pleasure of it and sees:
speaker_heading: JASON
text: emerging from a cloud of vapor like her worst nightmare.
scene_heading: EXT. UPPER DECK - SAME TIME
text: as J.J.'s SCREAM echoes from an exhaust duct. WHIP PAN to
text: find the crazed DECK HAND standing just below it,
text: reacting with dread. He's the only one who has heard it.
scene_heading: INT. POWER ROOM - SAME TIME
text: as Jason tears the guitar off her body, raising it in the
text: air like a hatchet. The horrified girl flees down a
text: narrow maze of steel steps, forced back against a
text: generator with nowhere to go. PUSH IN on her face for one
dialog: last look at her before:
speaker_heading: JASON
text: swings the guitar downward and buries it in J.J.'s skull.
scene_heading: EXT. UPPER DECK - SAME TIME
text: as the Deck Hand flinches upon the thick, dull sound of
text: her demise, followed by discordant feedback from her
text: guitar...and eventual silence. He reaches into his breast
text: pocket, his hand shaking badly as he sips from a flask of
dialog: Early Times.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT (EFX)
text: as LIGHTNING FLASHES over a gray, choppy sea. A storm is
text: imminent. The Princess Ruby finally appears, cutting
text: through whitecaps, no land in sight.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP - INK DIP PEN
text: as Rennie's hand carefully dips it in India ink, moving
text: to a blank page in her journal. She hesitates for several
dialog: beats.
scene_heading: INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - NIGHT
text: No inspiration. She puts down the pen, looking at her
text: dog, who's curled up on the bed.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: What do you think...time for some
dialog: personal experiences to fuel our
dialog: minds?
text: The dog's eyes blink, but no more than that.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: I agree.
text: Rennie moves to her closet, finding a silk blouse and
text: some black satin pants.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE DECK - SAME TIME
text: Wind is picking up, sweeping thick mist past a row of
text: decorative flags. One of them flaps back...AND EXPOSES
speaker_heading: JASON.
scene_heading: THROUGH JASON'S EYES (FLYING WALL EFX)
text: as the flag whips our faces. We MOVE through it, down the
text: empty passageway, coming to a porthole window. Rennie's
text: window. We peer through it with unnerving intensity at
text: the backside of Rennie as she pulls off her T-shirt,
text: slipping on the blouse. Camera continues through the
text: tiny round window, floating across the room, over Toby
text: and the bed...until we're INCHES FROM THE BACK OF
text: RENNIE'S HEAD. She suddenly spins around in fright,
dialog: facing us point-blank, and:
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: Nobody is there, her porthole window empty. But there's
dialog: something surreal about the window...
scene_heading: TIGHT ON PORTHOLE WINDOW (EFX)
text: Empty grayness...then EIGHT YEAR OLD JASON FLOATS UP FROM
text: BELOW, BUBBLES ESCAPING FROM HIS LIPS. The porthole has
text: become a window into the depths of Crystal Lake.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
text: feels her throat catch with terror and an instant later:
speaker_heading: DOG TOBY
text: begins to bark vociferously, rushing to her cabin door,
text: scratching to get out.
speaker_heading: RENNIE'S EYES
text: are distracted to Toby for a second; when she looks back
text: at the porthole, she sees:
scene_heading: AN EMPTY WINDOW
dialog: No water, no drowning boy.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
text: snaps out of it, moving to the door, where her dog is
text: frantically clawing with his fur up.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: Okay Toby, calm down...
text: She's talking to herself as much as the dog. Rennie
text: closes the curtains on her window, then steps to her
text: door. She swings the door open for Toby...and exposes
text: an empty hall. Toby scrapes his way out of the room,
text: dashing off down the hall, snarling.
scene_heading: INT. SHIP CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: as Toby runs straight toward us. PAN with him as he
text: rushes around a corner, leading us into a view of TAMARA
text: and EVA, disappearing down a staircase.
scene_heading: INT. MENS GYM - DAY
text: A strong seventeen year-old black kid, JULIUS GAW, is
text: going a few rounds with another senior boy who's clearly
text: losing the boxing match. Julius dances around him on the
text: mat like he's Mike Tyson, several other boys cheering
dialog: them on.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE - LOCKER ROOM WINDOW
text: as Tamara and Eva step into view. Eva glances around,
text: feeling out of place in the men's locker room.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: I'm not sure we're supposed to be
dialog: here, Tamara.
text: A couple of skinny boys wearing only towels walk by. But
text: Tamara doesn't notice them, her face pressed up against
text: the glass, watching Julius.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Is that a muscular bod or what?
text: Tamara puts on a sexy smile. The other boxer sees her
text: instead, instantly distracted. Julius lays him out with a
text: left-right-left combination. The onlookers applaud.
text: Julius pulls out his mouthpiece, giving Tamara a wicked
dialog: smile.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: He's undefeated, you know that?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Julius is the only senior I'd even
dialog: consider doing it with. If he wasn't
dialog: black, that is.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: (awkward)
dialog: My parents are open minded about that
dialog: sort of thing.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: My stepmom couldn't care less, but
dialog: Daddy would have a shit fit.
dialog: (lets it slip out)
dialog: He might even pay some attention to
dialog: me.
text: Tamara quickly puts up her veneer again, spotting
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Gorgeous guy at ten o'clock. Look
dialog: sensual.
text: Both girls slip into instant sultry as a CREW MEMBER in
text: his mid-twenties passes them, wearing a tool belt. Very
text: masculine. He gives the girls a pleasant smile. Tamara
text: turns around to check out his back side.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: I think it's time for some
dialog: recreational activity, girl.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Sounds good. I hear there's a
text: shuffleboard court on deck -- it might
dialog: be kinds cool...
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: You're joking, right?
text: She wasn't, but Eva tries to act like she was. Tamara
text: walks on, Eva following.
scene_heading: INT. STATEROOM HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: as McCulloch steps from Rennie's room, looking very
text: worried. Wayne Webber passes by, his eye stuck in his
text: viewfinder. McCulloch yanks the camcorder away from his
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Have you seen my niece anywhere?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Yeah, motivating downstairs, I think.
dialog: What's the problem, Mr. McCulloch?
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Senior predictions started five
text: minutes ago and she hasn't shown up.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Some of us don't want our futures
dialog: predicted.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: In your case I'm sure that's true.
text: He brushes past Wayne angrily.
scene_heading: INT. SERVICE AREA - NIGHT
text: as Tamara drags Eva into a secluded service area, pulling
text: out her mirror, straw and baggie.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: The night time is the right time.
text: Tamara hands the straw to Eva.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: (nervous)
dialog: No thanks.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: What? Don't be a lightweight...this is
dialog: top dollar toot.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: It's not that, it's just that...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It I get caught, I'll lose my science
dialog: scholarship and everything.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: You're talking to the prom queen,
dialog: Eva. Do you really think I'm going to
dialog: risk getting caught?
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: I guess not.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Do you realize how many people would
dialog: kill to be sitting here right now?
dialog: Come on, it's grad night. You've got
dialog: your whole life to be uptight.
text: Eva takes the straw.
text: STALKING POINT OF VIEW
text: as we move down the corridor, in and out of shadows,
text: hearing giggles from Tamara and Eva up ahead. Jason's
dialog: coming...
scene_heading: ANGLE - TAMARA AND EVA
text: as Eva takes a nosefull, sneezing badly.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Is that unbelievable or what?
text: Tamara giggles, getting ready to tap out another line.
text: But the snickering stops upon the sound of APPROACHING
text: FOOTSTEPS. They both look up, every muscle tensing with
dialog: fear as:
speaker_heading: RENNIE
text: appears from the shadows, just as startled to see them.
text: It's not Jason at all. Rennie can't help noticing the
text: cocaine, trying hard to ignore it.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Jesus, you scared the hell out of us.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: Have you seen my dog? I think he came
dialog: this way.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: No, we haven't.
dialog: (awkwardly)
dialog: Care for a hit?
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: No thanks.
text: Rennie continues on. After she's gone...
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll
dialog: narc on us...
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: I have her in Creative Writing and
dialog: she's fairly nice.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Nobody related to McCulloch can be
dialog: nice.
text: Tamara puts the straw to her nose.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - RENNIE
text: as she presses on, the corridor getting darker.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: Toby?
text: No reply. She walks on, turning down the left hallway...
text: but camera turns down the right hallway. Suddenly JASON
text: REVEALS HIMSELF, quietly stepping from the GAME ROOM.
text: He's holding a pool cue, which he proceeds to snap in
text: half, providing a splintery sharp shaft.
scene_heading: INT. SERVICE AREA - SAME TIME
text: as Tamara finishes off her line, wiping her nose with a
text: sniffle.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Oh yeah. Ready to party and then some.
text: She rolls up her baggie, stuffing it into her purse.
text: STALKING POINT OF VIEW
text: as we come down a corridor, turning into the Service
text: Area, stomping right up to Tamara and Eva. They both
text: GASP; Tamara drops her mirror, which SHATTERS on the
dialog: ground.
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: They are facing McCulloch.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: What are you doing in here?
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Nothing.
text: He eyes the broken mirror. He wasn't born yesterday.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Are you girls using drugs?
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Do you think I would use drugs, Mr.
dialog: McCulloch? We were just exploring the
dialog: ship.
text: He doesn't want to believe Eva is a druggie. But Tamara
text: is a different matter. He levels his eyes on her.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: I'11 be coming around your stateroom
dialog: in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss
dialog: Mason. You'd better have your biology
dialog: project ready or I'm phoning your
dialog: parents.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: They're out of town.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Then I'll make sure you remain on
dialog: board while your classmates see the
dialog: sights.
text: He's gotten to her with that one. McCulloch storms away.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: What are you going to do?
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Relax, I've got McCulloch covered...
dialog: but that little narcing bitch niece of
dialog: his is a different matter.
dialog: (calculating)
dialog: Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid
dialog: of the water...
speaker_heading: SPLASH!
text: as a body pierces the surface of the deck swimming pool.
text: It's MILES, having just completed a dive from the high
text: board. Miss Van Deusen and several others stand at
text: poolside, giving him some applause.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
text: Poetry in motion, Miles.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: A half-twist short. I'll hone that
dialog: dive yet.
text: He swims to the side, leading us to a view of Rennie.
text: She's very cautious about getting too close to the pool
text: edge as she approaches Miss Van Deusen.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: Rennie -- I was just on my way over to
dialog: your room
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: Have you seen my dog anywhere?
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: No, but I'm sure Toby's fine. The
dialog: ship's only so big and there's
dialog: certainly no way off it, is there?
text: She smiles reassuringly, but her words are less than
dialog: comforting.
scene_heading: INT. SHIP CORRIDOR - TRACKING WITH TOBY - SAME TIME
text: as the canine continues to sniff out Jason through the
text: maze of corridors. TRACK with the dog as he slows his
text: pace, knowing he's getting close to something.
scene_heading: TOBY'S POINT OF VIEW (STEADICAM)
text: Low to the ground, creeping past a steam vent which
text: obscures his vision, then turning down a metal staircase,
text: weaving into another passageway. Then with absolutely no
text: warning, A BODY FALLS FROM ABOVE, THUDDING DIRECTLY IN
speaker_heading: FRONT OF US.
speaker_heading: TOBY
text: rears back with teeth bared, but:
speaker_heading: THE BODY
text: is quite dead: Toby is snarling at the corpse of the
text: TEENAGE BOXER who lost his bout against Julius. He's
text: still in his boxing shorts...BUT JASON'S SPLINTERY POOL
text: CUE HAS BEEN STABBED THROUGH HIS CHEST.
scene_heading: EXT. DECK POOL - ON RENNIE AND MISS VAN DEUSEN
text: as they walk along the edge of the pool.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: So, are you having fun yet?
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: (lying)
dialog: Yeah...a lot.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: I seem to detect a hint of
dialog: ingenuousness in your tone.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: In other words, level with me.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: There's something I haven't told
dialog: you...
text: ...But before she can begin the next sentence, Rennie is
text: shoved from behind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATER ANGLE
text: as she SPLASHES INTO THE POOL'S DEEP END.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
text: spins around, seeing Tamara standing there with Eva.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Wow, sorry...
speaker_heading: RENNIE
text: flounders at the surface, nobody realizing the terror
text: she's experiencing. She's too scared to even cry for
dialog: help.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
text: isn't looking at Rennie, her attention on admonishing
dialog: Tamara.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: Why on earth would you do something
dialog: like that?
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: It was an accident, I swear...
text: Eva avoids eye contact, feeling awful. Sean comes walking
text: up, seeing Rennie.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: What happened?
dialog: (to Rennie)
dialog: Rennie, are you okay?
scene_heading: RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW
text: She's can't even hear Sean, her vision being splashed by
text: the chlorinated water. She sinks under the surface,
text: turning around...AND COMING FACE TO FACE WITH YOUNG
text: JASON. The eight year-old corpse GRABS HER ANKLE AND
text: TRIES TO DRAG HER DOWN.
scene_heading: SEAN'S POINT OF VIEW
text: as Rennie sinks under the surface, all alone, thrashing
dialog: in terror.
speaker_heading: SEAN
text: realizes she's in trouble. He immediately dives in after
text: her, pulling her to the pool's edge, where Miss Van
text: Deusen helps to lift her out.
speaker_heading: TAMARA AND EVA
text: quickly move on.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: That was truly excellent.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: (feels like shit)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Time to check out the waiters.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: I think I'll pass. See you later,
dialog: okay?
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: But...wait a minute!
text: Eva walks away. Tamara acts angry, but deep down she's
dialog: hurt.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Some friend you are.
scene_heading: EXT. POOL SIDE - SAME TIME
text: as Sean climbs from the pool to join Miss Van Deusen, who
text: is trying to comfort Rennie.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: (to Sean)
dialog: Bring her a towel, okay?
text: Sean nods, hurrying off as others start to crowd around.
text: Miss Van Deusen looks up at them.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: She's fine -- everybody go back to
dialog: what you were doing.
text: They disperse. Rennie slowly starts to cry, holding tight
dialog: to her teacher.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: Care to talk about it?
text: After a moment to compose herself...
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: I can't swim.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: I gathered that.
text: Rennie says nothing else. Miss Van Deusen knows she's
text: holding out.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: I had a skiing accident in high
dialog: school, broke my left leg. It took
dialog: three winters before I would even look
dialog: at the snow again...but the solution
dialog: kept eluding me.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I finally took lessons. I've never
text: broken a bone since.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: It's not that simple.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: Maybe not. But you're not telling me
dialog: everything, are you?
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: (long pause)
dialog: Whenever I get near the water, I see
text: this young boy drowning. He tries to
dialog: pull me down with him.
text: The teacher didn't expect this, taking a thoughtful
dialog: pause.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: When did this start?
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: About four years ago...at Crystal
dialog: Lake. I spent a few summers there with
dialog: Uncle Charles inbetween boarding
dialog: school.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: After your parents passed away?
text: Rennie nods somberly.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: Did you have an accident in the lake?
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: No. It was just a normal summer. I've
dialog: never been able to figure it out.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: Only one young boy ever drowned in
dialog: that lake, and that was before you
dialog: were even born. His name was Jason
dialog: Voorhees.
dialog: The name has triggered some deep memory...but the
text: recollection vanishes upon the sound of her uncle's
dialog: voice.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH (O.S.)
dialog: Dear God...
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: as McCulloch rushes over to Rennie, seeing that she's
text: soaked. He's livid.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Oh, I can see that. You've done a
dialog: wonderful job of supervising the kids,
dialog: Miss Van Deusen.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: It wasn't her fault.
text: He gets Rennie to her feet just as Sean runs back with a
text: towel. McCulloch grabs it from him, wrapping it around
text: his niece, facing both Miss Van Deusen and Sean.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Stay away from her...both of you.
text: He starts to lead her away. The crazy DECK HAND blocks
text: their path, slipping his flask away.
speaker_heading: DECK HAND
dialog: He's come back and you're all going to
dialog: die.
text: Rennie gazes at the Deck Hand, then back at McCulloch.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: Just...leave me alone...
text: She pulls away from him, hurrying off, confused and
text: frightened. McCulloch's retinas pierce the Deck Hand with
text: scorn. He checks his watch, then storms off.
scene_heading: INT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - NIGHT
text: as a loud, firm KNOCK punctuates the silence. Then comes
text: a sultry voice...
speaker_heading: TAMARA (O.S.)
text: The door's open.
text: McCulloch swings it open.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: I'm in no mood for any more stall
dialog: tactics, Miss Mason. Where is your
dialog: final project?
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: as Tamara fills a pair of champagne glasses with a bottle
text: of Dom Perignon. She's wearing a full body robe.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Wouldn't you like a glass of champagne
dialog: first, Charles?
text: He's about to lose his temper. McCulloch steps closer.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Where did you get that alcohol?
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: I packed it. Just for us.
scene_heading: EXT. DECK CORRIDOR - STALKING POINT OF VIEW
text: as we approach Tamara's porthole window, peering through
text: it. We can't hear the words but we can clearly see the
dialog: people.
scene_heading: INT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: as McCulloch takes the bottle from her, setting it down
text: on her nightstand.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: That's it. You're not setting foot off
dialog: this ship until we return home.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: But I haven't even shown you my
dialog: biology project...
text: Tamara unties her robe. PAN DOWN to the floor with it as
text: it softly piles at her bare feet.
scene_heading: ANGLE - PORTHOLE WINDOW
text: as the SHADOW OUTSIDE quickly blurs past the window.
scene_heading: RETURN TO SCENE
text: McCulloch is flabbergasted, too stunned to fully react.
text: Tamara is wearing a layered teddy, which she's beginning
text: to unsnap, exposing her lithe body...but that's not all.
text: Tamara has drawn all her major organs on her bare skin.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Take a closer look, Charles. I want to
dialog: make sure I labeled all my organs
dialog: correctly.
scene_heading: EXT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - STALKING POINT OF VIEW
text: as we approach her door, still cracked open from
text: McCulloch's entrance. We get there just in time to see
text: Tamara slip her arms around McCulloch, planting her lips
text: on his, pressing her nubile flesh up against his stiffly
text: starched shirt.
scene_heading: INT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: as she holds him tight. He finally breaks away in a fit
dialog: of anger.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Oh, you've done it now. Not only are
dialog: you going home, I'll see to it that
dialog: you spend next year back in a high
dialog: school classroom!
text: He storms for the door, swinging it open, coming face to
dialog: face with:
speaker_heading: WAYNE
text: who casually lowers his camcorder.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: I don't think so, Mr. McCulloch.
dialog: (to Wayne)
dialog: Did you get anything good?
text: His eyes are unable to leave her nakedness.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Oh yeah.
text: She quickly slips on her robe again, all business.
text: McCulloch realizes what has just transpired.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: You'll never get away with it.
dialog: (eyeing Wayne)
dialog: And you can forget about ever
dialog: attending any film school.
dialog: (serious beat)
dialog: You're both going to be very, very
dialog: sorry.
text: He storms off. Wayne looks very, very nervous. Tamara
text: steps over to him, cuddling up.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Relax, Wayne. He won't risk doing a
dialog: thing.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Can I have the tape?
text: He pops the eject button, absently handing it over. Wayne
text: steps into her room, nervous and excited to be there. He
text: lifts the glass of champagne she poured for McCulloch.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: This is going to sound supremely
dialog: lame...but I've had the major hots for
dialog: you since our sophomore year, Tamara.
text: He gulps down the fizz. She forces a smile, stashing the
text: incriminating videotape.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: That's sweet, Wayne. Look, I'd love to
dialog: chat but I'm really pressed for time.
dialog: (ushering him to door)
dialog: Let's try to get together later, okey-
dialog: doke?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: But I thought...
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Thanks for the camerawork.
text: And out he goes, the door shut in his face. Wayne stands
text: outside her room, realizing he's a major chump.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Wayne, you're an asshole.
text: He despondently exits.
scene_heading: INT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME (STEADICAM)
text: as Tamara heads for the bathroom, slipping off her robe.
text: She moves to the shower curtain and we're right behind
text: her. Her hand reaches up, grabbing the curtain, yanking
dialog: it back...
dialog: Nothing is there.
scene_heading: INT. LADIES RESTROOM - SAME TIME - NIGHT (EFX)
text: as Rennie enters, her eyes reddened. She moves to the
text: sink, looking at herself in the mirror. So much for the
text: silk blouse and satin pants, not to mention her soaked
text: hair. Rennie runs some warm water, rinsing her face.
text: When she starts to fill her hands a second time, BLOOD
text: POURS OUT THE FAUCET INSTEAD OF WATER. Rennie gasps,
text: jerking up and seeing YOUNG JASON REFLECTED ON THE OTHER
text: SIDE OF THE MIRROR, SPLASHING IN WATER.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: It's not real, it's not real...
scene_heading: INT. TAMARA'S SHOWER - SAME TIME
text: as water from the shower head SPLASHES CAMERA for a beat
text: before Tamara turns it off.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: as Tamara reaches for her robe, slipping it on. Her body
text: paint has been washed off.
text: She steps from the shower, glancing in her vanity mirror
text: AND SEEING THE REAL JASON REFLECTED IN IT. Tamara spins
text: around, looking face to face with JASON IN HER BATHROOM.
text: Just as she SCREAMS:
scene_heading: INT. LADIES RESTROOM - SAME TIME (EFX)
text: Young Jason reaches out to grab Rennie, HIS FIST CRASHING
text: THROUGH THE MIRROR. Right when Rennie SCREAMS:
scene_heading: INT. TAMARA'S BATHROOM - SAME TIME
text: The real Jason SHATTERS TAMARA'S VANITY MIRROR WITH HIS
text: FIST. He grabs a sharp chunk of it, advancing on a
text: whimpering Tamara.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Please...please don't...
text: Jason raises the shard above her and just as she
text: SHRIEKS...
scene_heading: CLOSE UP - STEAM WHISTLE OF SHIP
text: as it blasts loudly in the bleak stormy night. It begins
dialog: to rain.
scene_heading: EXT. LADIES RESTROOM - NIGHT
text: as Rennie comes rushing out, right into the arms of.
text: Sean. She clings to him, sobbing as the rain falls over
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: It's okay...you're going to be okay.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: I want to go home. I want off this
dialog: ship.
dialog: After a moment...
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Me too.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Let's go talk to my Dad.
text: He puts his arm around her, leading her toward the
dialog: bridge.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: as wind and rain pummel the bridge window.. Admiral
text: Robertson turns to his Chief Engineer.
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
dialog: Let's kick in the stablilizers, Mr.
dialog: Carlson, and get the seas off the
dialog: quarter. These kids are in for one
dialog: hell of a storm.
speaker_heading: CHIEF ENGINEER
dialog: Yes Sir. Activating comfort cruise
dialog: mode.
text: The Chief Engineer moves to a bank of toggle switches,
text: flipping a row of them.
scene_heading: TIGHT ON NAVIGATIONAL CHART WALL - SAME TIME
text: as a bloodstained HAND silently removes the rusty
text: harpoon hanging above the map.
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
text: gets a reflective look in his weary eyes.
scene_heading: ADMIRAL-ROBERTSON
dialog: How olds your boy now, Carlson?
speaker_heading: CHIEF ENGINEER
dialog: Nineteen months.
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
dialog: A tremendous age. Take some advice
dialog: from a salty old man: don't push him
dialog: too hard.
text: The Chief Engineer nods with a sympathetic smile as the
text: Admiral steps off the bridge, onto the stormy deck,
text: contemplating the sea. The Chief Engineer moves to the
text: radio/intercom console. He lifts a telephone, punching in
text: a three digit number. PUSH IN TIGHT ON HIS FACE.
speaker_heading: CHIEF ENGINEER
text: This is the bridge. Approaching
dialog: weather suggests we secure the main
dialog: deck and...
text: His sentence is sharply cut off, his head jerking from
text: excruciating, instant pain.
text: His mouth contorts with words no one will ever hear as he
text: stares into the face of:
speaker_heading: JASON
text: holding the opposite end of the harpoon. He shoves it
text: forward with one more staccato jerk and:
scene_heading: CLOSE UP - CHIEF ENGINEER'S BACK
text: -- The harpoon's bloody, corroded tip pierces through
text: his once-white uniform.
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
text: returns to the bridge as LIGHTNING flashes outside.
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
dialog: Better have them doublecheck the
dialog: lifeboat stations as well...
text: Admiral Robertson stops cold upon the sight of Mr.
text: Carlson. He hurries over to him, kneeling down, freezing
text: as a pair of MUDDY FEET ENTER FRAME. Admiral Robertson
text: bends his neck upwards to face:
speaker_heading: JASON
text: hovering over him, now clutching one of the scaling
dialog: knives.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: as Sean and Rennie walk up the corridor leading to the
dialog: bridge.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: Can he really take us home?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Not completing a voyage is against
dialog: everything he stands for. But I think
dialog: I can convince him to call a Coast
dialog: Guard cutter for you.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: What about you?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: If I go with you, he'll never
dialog: speak to me again.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But I'm never going to live up to his
dialog: expectations anyway...so maybe it's
dialog: the right thing to do.
text: He's made a big decision. Sean takes her hand as they
dialog: walk on.
scene_heading: THEIR POINT OF VIEW
text: moving closer and closer to the bridge door, having not
text: the slightest inclination of what's in store for them.
speaker_heading: SEAN
text: knocks on the bridge door. No answer. He's confused. He
text: pushes the door open but something is blocking it. Sean
text: puts his weight into it, shoving hard.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE
text: as the door slides open, Sean stepping inside. His eyes
text: roil downwards upon seeing THE DEAD CHIEF ENGINEER, THE
text: HARPOON PROTRUDING FROM HIS BLOODY CHEST.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Oh Jesus...Dad??
text: Sean looks over at the helm...where his father is still
text: sitting in the swivel chair, his back to them. Silent.
text: Sean sidesteps the Chief Engineer's corpse, moving toward
text: his father as Rennie remains frozen in shock.
scene_heading: SEAN'S POINT OF VIEW
text: Slowly walking toward Admiral Robertson...at least he
text: thinks it's his dad because he's unable to see his
dialog: face. Is it Jason now wearing the uniform?? When he's
text: about two feet away from him...
speaker_heading: SEAN
text: reaches out and swivels the chair around. It is his
text: father BUT HIS THROAT HAS BEEN SLIT. Sean staggers
text: backwards, uncomprehending, his senses overloaded. We
text: MOVE with him until he's backed into Rennie, clutching
text: onto him tightly.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: He's...he's dead...
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME
text: as Miss Van Deusen steps up to Rennie's door, gently
dialog: knocking.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: Ronnie? I just came by to see how you
dialog: were feeling...
text: No answer. She knocks harder...and it creaks open,
dialog: unlocked.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: Rennie...?
text: Suddenly the door is jerked from her grasp and swung
text: open. MCCULLOCH is standing on the other side of it.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: I thought I told you to stay away from
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: (holds her ground)
dialog: Where is she?
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCB
dialog: (accusing)
dialog: That's a very good question and I'd
dialog: appreciate an answer.
text: A LOUD BUZZER blares out of an intercom speaker next to
text: their heads, causing the teachers to both jump. Sean's
text: unsteady voice immediately follows.
speaker_heading: SEAN (V.O.)
dialog: Attention everybody, attention. This
dialog: is Sean Robertson...
scene_heading: EXT. SWIMMING POOL - SAME TIME
text: Miles is toweling off under the shelter of a gazebo as
text: Sean's voice blares out of a rain-pounded megaphone
text: speaker nearby.
speaker_heading: SEAN (V.O.)
dialog: There's been...
dialog: (swallows)
dialog: What I mean is, this is an
dialog: emergency...
text: Miles knows he can't be joking around. Wayne comes
text: walking by, covering his camcorder with his jacket.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Miles -- have you seen J.J.? She was
text: supposed to be jamming down in the
dialog: power room but...
text: Miles gestures for him to be quiet, listening very
text: worriedly.
speaker_heading: SEAN (V.O.)
dialog: Repeat, this is an emergency...
scene_heading: INT. GYM LOCKERS - SAME TIME
text: as JULIUS and two other senior boys finish dressing after
text: a shower, hearing Sean's words reverberate around them.
speaker_heading: SEAN (V.O.)
dialog: I want everybody to meet on the
dialog: bridge...
speaker_heading: JULIUS
dialog: What the fuck is this?
text: The others shrug, concerned.
scene_heading: EXT. SHUFFLEBOARD COURT - SAME TIME
text: The wooden shuffleboard disks are drowning in
text: precipitation. Eva stands alone in the rain, staring at
text: the court as Sean's voice continues.
speaker_heading: SEAN (V.O.)
dialog: Stay calm, but get here as quick as
dialog: possible. Walk with a friend if you
dialog: can...
text: Eva wipes the rain from her face, then walks away.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE - ON SEAN
text: trying his best to keep it together. He glances at his
text: dead father, still unable to believe it.
speaker_heading: SEAN (V.O.)
dialog: God, I wish this was a joke, but it's
dialog: not.
text: Sean slowly puts down the phone. He's lost in a daze.
text: Suddenly the SHIP LURCHES, a huge swell SPLASHING THE
text: BRIDGE WINDOW. Admiral Robertson's body falls from the
text: swivel chair.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: What is happening???
text: Sean regains his balance, moving to the computer console,
text: looking at the OMEGA and LORAN like he's never seen them
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I don't know...we've gone off course
dialog: or something...
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: What do you mean???
text: Another wave hammers the bow. She's in a state of awful
dialog: panic.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I don't know what I mean! All's I know
dialog: is that there's no one guiding this
dialog: ship anymore...
text: Sean is starting to lose it. The fear of the ocean
text: guiding her, Rennie rushes to him, gripping and shaking
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: Can't you call for help??
text: Sean tries to get a grip and assess the situation, pacing
text: frenetically.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I think so. But we have to lower the
dialog: anchors so we don't drift any
dialog: further...
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: Where are they?
speaker_heading: SEAN
text: The bow...front of the ship. There's a
text: hoist on each side that lowers them
text: She starts to exit.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I didn't mean for you to go!
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: Just radio for help, okay???
text: She hurries out the door, working on terror-induced
text: adrenaline. Sean rushes to the radio console, depressing
text: the keying button, speaking into the mike.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Mayday, mayday, mayday...
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: as JULIUS arrives with the others from the locker room.
text: They react to the dead bodies while Sean continues at the
dialog: radio.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Please...can anybody out there hear
dialog: me??
text: No response. WAYNE and MILES rush in.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Sean, what's going on?
text: Then he sees the corpses. He needs no further answer.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Jesus Christ...
text: He's too scared to even videotape it. Sean is bombarded
text: with questions as he tries to figure out the radio.
speaker_heading: JULIUS
dialog: Who did this, man?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Is the radio even working??
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Isn't there some international S.O.S.
dialog: thing you can do???
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (suddenly remembers)
dialog: Channel 16...the distress frequency...
dialog: (dialing knob)
dialog: Mayday, mayday, mayday...this is the
dialog: Princess Ruby. Please, somebody
dialog: answer...
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT (STOCK)
text: as a COAST GUARD CUTTER tracks through stormy seas.
speaker_heading: RADIO OFFICER (V.O.)
dialog: This is Coast Guard cutter Dallas.
dialog: What is the nature of your problem,
dialog: Ruby?
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE - ON SEAN AND OTHERS
text: as they hear the voice, reacting, relieved and thrilled.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: The Captain and Chief Engineer...
dialog: they've been...they're dead.
speaker_heading: RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.)
dialog: (a grave-pause)
dialog: What is your location?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I...I don't know...
speaker_heading: RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.)
dialog: Is your ship equipped with Omega
speaker_heading: satellite navigation or LORAN?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.)
text: The LORAN has a digital printout of
dialog: your latitude and longitude. Give me
dialog: the coordinates and we'll be there as
dialog: quick as we can.
text: Sean hurries to the LORAN, reading the numbers.
scene_heading: EXT. DECK - RADIO ANTENNA - SAME TIME (EFX)
text: as LIGHTNING STRIKES above it in the night sky. Camera
text: slowly ADJUSTS to find the RADIO ANTENNA CABLE. A second
text: later, JASON'S HAND REACHES FOR IT, GETTING A FIRM GRASP.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE - SAME TIME
text: as Sean hurries back to the radio, pressing it against
text: his spitless mouth.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I've got the numbers.
speaker_heading: RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.)
dialog: Give me the degrees first, followed by
dialog: minutes and sec...
text: Suddenly his voice is CUT OFF, followed by STATIC.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Hello? Are you there??
text: No response. A lump sinks into everyone's throat.
scene_heading: EXT. DECK - RADIO ANTENNA
text: as Jason drops the cable he's just torn out, marching
dialog: onward.
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: as McCulloch bursts onto the bridge, followed by Miss Van
dialog: Deusen.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: I demand to know what is going on...
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: Oh dear God...
text: She's seen the bodies. McCulloch follows her glance,
text: paling. He quickly takes charge, pushing through the
dialog: students.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Where's the radio?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: It's...dead.
speaker_heading: DECK HAND (O.S.)
dialog: You're all going to die.
text: All heads spin as the deranged DECK HAND treads out from
text: a shadowy corridor.
speaker_heading: DECK HAND
dialog: You're the last ones. He's come back
dialog: for you.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: What are you talking about?
text: The Deck Hand takes a final swig from his flask, dropping
text: it with unsteady hands.
speaker_heading: DECK HAND
dialog: Jason Voorhees.
text: There is a collective, disconcerting silence triggered by
dialog: the infamous name.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: You're insane, old man. Jason Voorhees
dialog: has been dead for over thirty years.
speaker_heading: DECK HAND
dialog: He walks this ship, here and now.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: A killer walks this ship indeed. And
dialog: it's certainly none of us...
text: The crazed old man gets his drift. Everyone looks at him
text: suspiciously. McCulloch grabs a SCALING KNIFE off the
text: wall, taking a step towards him.
speaker_heading: DECK HAND
dialog: You're the one who's insane!!
text: The raving man flees back the way he came. McCulloch
text: raises the flare gun; Miss Van Deusen grabs McCulloch's
text: arm, stopping him.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: What are you doing??
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: That lunatic has been spouting off
dialog: about Jason since we boarded...
dialog: (eyeing bodies)
dialog: It's no coincidence.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: But that doesn't prove that he's the
dialog: one!
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Walking corpses are not real!
speaker_heading: JULIUS
dialog: Yeah, well these dead bodies are sure
dialog: enough real.
dialog: (to the others)
dialog: I say we regroup and find this
dialog: motherfucker before he finds us.
text: There's a murmur; it makes sense.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: You'll do no.such thing and watch your
dialog: mouth, young man! I'm in charge here!
text: They all look at McCulloch defiantly.
speaker_heading: JULIUS
dialog: School's out, McCulloch.
dialog: (to the others)
dialog: Let's go.
text: Julius walks off the bridge; all the seniors follow
dialog: except Sean.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: Please everybody, stay here!!
text: They don't listen. McCulloch starts to go after
text: them...and then it hits him:
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Christ...where's Rennie??
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: She's...she's dropping the anchors. I
dialog: thought the Coast Guard could find us
dialog: easier if...
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: What?? You sent her out there with a
dialog: murderer running around loose??
scene_heading: EXT. DECK - NIGHT
text: as Rennie moves past wet, empty lounge chairs towards the
text: bow. She passes a row of translucent windows. The first
text: three are normal...but the fourth has the SILHOUETTE OF
text: JASON ON ITS OPPOSITE SIDE.
text: He begins to stride parallel to her, then disappears
text: when the windows end and a wall takes over.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: as Julius and his followers continue on, passing Eva,
text: who's coming up from a staircase. She stops Wayne.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: What's going on? I heard on the P.A.
dialog: system that...
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: The Captain's been murdered. The buzz
dialog: is that Jason might be on board.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Jason...Voorhees?
dialog: She knows the legend as weld as everybody else. Wayne
text: nods gravely, moving to catch up with the others. Eva
text: rushes up to him again.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Have you seen Tamara?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: No. And I'm not losing any sleep over
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: But she might be in trouble...
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: So what else is new?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude
dialog: to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise
dialog: up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: I don't care about being hip anymore.
text: She means it. Wayne nods with understanding.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I'm sorry, but I've gotta find J.J.
text: He hurries on.
scene_heading: EXT. BOW - NIGHT
text: as Rennie appears, fighting the wind and rain to get
text: closer to the anchor hoists.
scene_heading: POINT OF VIEW THROUGH DECK WINDOW - SAME TIME
text: --spying on Rennie like a wolf watching a lamb. We MOVE a
text: few windows down, getting a better view of her.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE - ON JASON
text: deciding that the time is right to strike. His hand moves
text: to the bow entrance door knob, slowly turning it, pulling
text: it open.
scene_heading: EXT. BOW - ON RENNIE
text: moving closer to the right anchor hoist, her back to us
text: as well as Jason. She climbs behind the hoist, looking at
text: the consoles. Then suddenly a BARK.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: Toby?
text: She turns, catching a glimpse of her dog running down the
text: side of the deck. Rennie leaves the hoist, going after
dialog: Toby.
scene_heading: JASON'S POINT OF VIEW
text: through the crack in the door, watching Rennie
text: unexpectedly take off. He's about to move after her when
dialog: ha hears:
speaker_heading: EVA (O.S.)
dialog: Tamara? Are you around here anywhere?
text: Jason quietly closes the door. Rennie will have to wait.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - TRACKING WITH EVA
text: as she cautiously walks along, poking her head in every
dialog: alcove.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Tamara?
scene_heading: JASON'S POINT OF VIEW
text: moving down the same corridor, catching a glimpse of Eva
text: before she turns a corner and disappears.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY/TAMARA'S STATEROOM - MOVING WITH EVA
speaker_heading: (STEADICAM)
text: Eva steps into the hallway outside Tamara's stateroom.
text: She walks up to Tamara's door, knocking on it. It swings
text: open, unlocked.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Tamara?
dialog: (no response)
dialog: I just want to talk with you.
text: She steps into Tamara's room and we go in with her. The
text: quarters are empty. Eva stands there for a beat, confused
text: and scared. She's about to leave when a CREAKING SOUND
text: causes her to look back at:
scene_heading: THE BATHROOM DOOR
text: It slowly swings open...splashing Eva's eyes with
text: grotesque multi-images of Tamara: SHE IS HANGING ON THE
text: DOOR HOOK, HER BODY PIN-CUSHIONED WITH A DOZEN MIRROR
speaker_heading: SRARDS.
speaker_heading: EVA
text: shrieks, running back out the door...
scene_heading: INT. STATEROOM HALLWAY
text: ...and sliding to a abrupt halt because JASON IS STANDING
text: AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY. He moves toward Eva like a
text: bulldozer. She turns a rapid 180 and sprints in retreat.
scene_heading: RUNNING WITH EVA (HAND HELD)
text: Gasping for oxygen, Eva has no time to even scream as she
text: flees from the monster, erratically turning down a spiral
text: staircase and running on.
scene_heading: JASON'S POINT OF VIEW (STEADICAM)
text: chasing after her with the smooth determination of a
text: shark, never letting her get too far in the lead.
scene_heading: INT. BOWELS OF SHIP - ON EVA
text: Empty for a second, then Eva appears, weaving her way
text: through a maze of corridors and passageways. She races
text: past a sign directing passengers to "CLUB RUBY."
speaker_heading: ANGLE - JASON
text: --entering the same corridor a beat after Eva exits it in
text: the direction of the disco. He tramples onward.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR/DISCO (STEADICAM)
text: The thudding low frequency of a mesmerizing dance tune
text: precedes Eva as she tears open a door, entering the
text: corridor. MOVE BACKWARDS WITH HER as she rushes forward,
text: curving through the shallow passageway and emptying out
text: onto a high tech DISCO FLOOR. A flashing Star Wars
text: lighting system assaults her all directions along with
text: the music. She's all alone in here.
speaker_heading: TIGHT ON EVA
text: The lights strobing across her face only accentuate her
text: terror. She spots another door on a small stage, rushing
text: to it. It's locked.
scene_heading: CROOKED ANGLE - ENTRANCE DOOR
text: as Jason enters the corridor, SLAMMING THE DOOR SHUT
scene_heading: BEHIND HIM.
speaker_heading: EVA
text: decides this is the wrong place to be. She moves for the
dialog: corridor again and:
speaker_heading: JASON
text: appears on the corridor steps for a brief second. The
text: spotlight goes black, then flashes on again. Now he's
dialog: gone.
speaker_heading: EVA
text: backs away, sliding along the edge of the dance floor
text: like she's on a building ledge. Chaser lights and mirror
text: balls fondle her body as she moves as far away from the
dialog: point where she last saw him. But:
speaker_heading: JASON
text: illuminates only ten feet from her, a crimson strobe
text: assaulting his hockey mask. She's on a collision course
dialog: with him.
speaker_heading: EVA
text: whirls dizzily to the center of the dance floor upon the
text: sight of him. Camera SPINS with her in 360 degree arcs,
text: PUSHING IN on her face.
scene_heading: EVA'S POINT OF VIEW
text: spiraling counter-clockwise on the dance floor, flashes
text: of Jason materializing where she least expects to see
text: him. And getting closer. Finally at the point of
dialog: exhaustion:
speaker_heading: EVA
text: stops, looking everywhere.
scene_heading: EVA'S POINT OF VIEW
text: He seems to be gone. She catches her breath...then
text: sensing his presence, she revolves a half-turn to face:
scene_heading: THE HOCKEY MASK
text: exploding under a pin spotlight, standing directly
text: before her. His forearms recoil with lightning speed as
text: he grips her throat...
speaker_heading: WIDE SHOT - DISCO
text: Thundering music. Frantic lights. And Jason and Eva at
text: the center of it all. HER FEET ARE TWENTY-FOUR INCHES OFF
text: THE GROUND, KICKING MADLY AS THE LIFE IS BEING CHOKED OUT
text: OF HER. Finally Eva's legs go rag doll limp. Jason flings
text: her to the ground like a sack of flour. This dance is
dialog: over.
scene_heading: EXT. DECK - NIGHT
text: Rennie appears again, scanning her no-visibility
dialog: surroundings.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: Toby? Where'd you go?
text: No sign of her dog. She remembers her mission, heading to
text: the anchors again.
scene_heading: EXT. BOW - CONTINUOUS
text: as Rennie arrives on the bow, climbing into the left
text: hoist box behind the huge anchor cable.
text: STALKING POINT OF VIEW
text: moving up to the bow door like Jason did before, cracking
text: it open, seeing Rennie from behind. And moving towards
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
text: is oblivious as she reads the directions above the
dialog: controls.
scene_heading: INSERT - HOIST LEVER (SECOND UNIT)
text: as Rennie's hand grabs it, shoving it forward.
scene_heading: INSERT - GREEN HOIST BUTTON (SECOND UNIT)
text: A moment later, her thumb finds it and depresses it.
scene_heading: INSERT - ANCHOR CHAIN (SECOND UNIT)
text: as the massive black chain links thunder to life.
text: STALKING POINT OF VIEW
text: He's now within ten feet of the unaware girl.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
text: remains in the hoist box, making certain it is operating
text: correctly. A second later, we see the fleeting outline of
text: a HUMAN SHAPE appear behind her.
text: STALKING POINT OF VIEW
text: Three feet from Rennie. She spins around to climb out of
text: the hoist box and GASPS.
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: She's facing MCCULLOCH. He immediately reaches past her,
text: yanking the lever back to its center position, and:
scene_heading: THE ANCHOR CHAIN (SECOND UNIT)
text: grinds to a halt.
dialog: RETURN TO SHOT
text: as McCulloch faces her, angrily grabbing Rennie's arms,
text: shouting over the storm.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: You had me worried to death!
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: But Sean said...
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: I'm the one you should be listening
dialog: to! Do you think dropping an anchor in
text: the middle of a storm makes any sense
dialog: whatsoever?
text: She tries to find some defense, but McCulloch leads her
text: off before any wards come forth.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP - EXERCISE MAT
text: as a pair of SKEET RIFLES, three FIRE AXES, a FLARE GUN
text: and several POOL CUES are dumped onto the foam padded
dialog: plastic.
scene_heading: INT. EXERCISE ROOM - NIGHT
text: where Julius has gathered his small group of vigilantes,
dialog: including Miles and Wayne.
speaker_heading: JULIUS
dialog: I managed to scrounge this shit from
dialog: the game room and hallways. Grab what
dialog: you want.
text: Wayne takes one of the rifles; Miles grabs the axe.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: What are you taking, Julius?
speaker_heading: JULIUS
dialog: (flexes fists)
dialog: Nothin'.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: (dead serious)
dialog: We're talking the possibility of Jason
dialog: Voorhees here.
text: Julius pauses. He's not stupid.
speaker_heading: JULIUS
dialog: Nothin' but this gun.
text: He reaches down, picking up the other rifle. And they
dialog: move.
scene_heading: INT. STATEROOM HALLWAY/RENNIE'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: as McCulloch guides his niece down the hallway, swinging
text: her door open.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: Can't we at least talk about it?
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: I refuse to discuss this ridiculous
text: notion that a ghoul is terrorizing
dialog: this ship.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: But what about the drowning boy I've
dialog: been seeing?
text: He avoids eye contact. McCulloch takes her hand, ushering
text: her across the threshold. She's standing inside her room
text: now; he's in the hallway.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Whatever you've been...imagining...
text: has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's
dialog: all I care about.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: I'm not staying in my room, Uncle
dialog: Charles.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: This isn't a request.
text: He closes the door on her face, pulling out a key,
text: locking the dead bolt. She pounds on it from the other
dialog: side.
speaker_heading: RENNIE (O.S.)
dialog: Uncle Charles!
text: He ignores her, briskly walking away.
scene_heading: INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME
text: as she throws her fists against the door a final time,
text: realizing it's futile.
scene_heading: INT. POWER ROOM - NIGHT
text: Steam continues to seep from the maze of criss-crossing
text: pipes. Wayne appears on one of the catwalks. He's holding
text: the skeet rifle under one arm, using the sun gun off his
text: video camera to guide him.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: J.J. -- you down here?
speaker_heading: CLOSER ANGLE
text: as Wayne carefully lets his light guide him down the
text: precarious walkway. An unexpected blast of steam scares
text: the crap out of him, causing him to stumble.
scene_heading: INSERT - WAYNE'S GLASSES (SECOND UNIT)
text: --They slip off the bridge of his nose, skittering down
text: through the catwalk and pipes to God knows where.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
text: lies helplessly on the metal grid work, realizing his
text: bleak predicament has just been squared. He pulls himself
text: to a standing position again.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: We got a major problem, Wayne.
scene_heading: WAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW
text: His vision now gives him shadows and shapes rather than
text: crisp images. He raises the gun and continues unsteadily
dialog: forward.
text: POINT OF VIEW THROUGH GRID WORK
text: as Wayne inches forward. Camera slowly PANS INTO A
text: PROFILE OF JASON, watching him from a catbird seat.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
text: takes another step, almost tripping on a set of stairs
text: leading down to the next level. And when he arrives
dialog: there...
scene_heading: WAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW
text: ...A LARGE FIGURE STEPS OUT, HOLDING WHAT APPEARS TO BE A
speaker_heading: KNIFE.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
text: instantly raises the rifle and FIRES...
scene_heading: WAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW
text: ...and the body goes down. He's hit him!
speaker_heading: WAYNE
text: stands there, breathing some relief. He gets an idea,
text: looking through his camcorder eyepiece. Wayne begins to
text: adjust the eyepiece diaptor.
scene_heading: WAYNE'S POINT OF VIEW (B &amp; W/VIEWFINDER MATTE)
text: as the figure on the ground slips in and out of focus,
text: finally becoming crisp. WAYNE HAS SHOT A CREW MEMBER --
text: the same good looking one Tamara and Eva ogled earlier.
text: He's holding a screwdriver from his waist band tool set,
dialog: not a knife.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
text: slowly lowers his camera as his heart rises into his
dialog: throat.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: No...
text: He raises his camcorder again, hoping a second view will
text: reveal a dead Jason rather than this young man.
scene_heading: WAYNE'S POINT OF VIEW (B &amp; W/VIEWFINDER MATTE)
text: He gets half his wish: a HOCKEY MASK NOW FILLS HIS
text: FRAME...but Jason is far from dead. Wayne catches a split-
text: second glimpse of Jason's fist coming towards him, then
text: the camera is KNOCKED FROM HIS EYE AND THE WORLD BECOMES
text: DARK AND BLURRY.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
text: screams, blindly running as fast as he can. He trips,
text: picking himself up, stumbling down the catwalk stairs.
text: Wayne makes it about ten feet before he stumbles over
text: something, bringing with it a harsh strum from an
scene_heading: ELECTRIC GUITAR.
scene_heading: ANGLE - WAYNE'S FEET
text: Sure enough, his left shoe is resting on the pickups of a
text: blood-streaked Gibson Flying V.
scene_heading: TIGHT ON WAYNE
text: --sprawled out on the metal floor. He gropes around, his
text: hands feeling something. It sends chills from his groin
text: up through his scalp.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: No no no...
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: Wayne's hands are touching J.J.'S BLOODY FACE, A LARGE
text: CRACK IN HER SKULL. He doesn't have time to scream or cry
dialog: because
speaker_heading: JASON
text: hoists him off of J.J.'s body and flings him into:
speaker_heading: THE SHIP CIRCUIT PANEL (EFX)
text: which shorts out with a fanfare of ELECTRICAL SPARKS
text: AND FIRE, INSTANTLY FRYING WAYNE.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE - SAME TIME
text: as the overhead lights briefly flicker, then resume
text: normal operation. Sean stands opposite the navigational
text: chart, ping-ponging between it and the ship's
text: computers as Miss Van Deusen paces nervously.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: What was that??
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (very worried)
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: (trying not to panic)
dialog: What happens if we don't get control
dialog: of the ship, Sean? I want you to tell
dialog: me the truth.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We could hit a reef, collide with
dialog: another ship...we could be out here
dialog: for weeks before anybody spotted us.
text: They are suddenly jolted with a DOOR SLAM as McCulloch
text: storms onto the bridge.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: Did you find Rennie?
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
text: She's locked safe in her room, no
dialog: thanks to either of you.
dialog: (like Sean isn't even in the
dialog: room)
dialog: Has he brought it back on course yet?
text: Sean doesn't look at him, still trying to assimilate the
text: wall of components.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: He's doing the best he can, Charles.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: He's the son of the Captain, for
dialog: Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able
dialog: to operate this thing!
text: Sean closes his eyes, trying to keep from losing his mind
text: and temper. A fierce WAVE slaps the windows in front of
text: Sean's face, motivating him to get his shit together. He
text: checks the Omega and LORAN.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Well?
text: Sean doesn't answer, moving to the seat behind the helm.
text: His father's seat. Sean takes the chair, adjusting the
text: wheel, watching the compass. He studies a series of
text: buttons on the console.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP - WALL OF BUTTONS
text: We PAN across them, stopping on one labeled "FIRE ALARM -
text: DO NOT BREAK EXCEPT IN CASE OF EMERGENCY." Camera
text: continues around to find we are in the POWER ROOM, NOT on
text: the bridge. Our vision suddenly lands on JASON, staring
text: at the alarm button, considering. He glances back over
text: his shoulder.
speaker_heading: JASON'S POINT OF VIEW (EFX)
text: Wayne's body is NOW ON FIRE...AND THE BLAZE IS SPREADING
text: THROUGH THE ROOM.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE - SAME TIME
text: as Sean makes up his mind, flipping several toggle
dialog: switches.
scene_heading: INSERT - AUTO PILOT COMPUTER
text: as Sean flips the last toggle and a green light
text: illuminates, indicating the AUTO PILOT is in effect.
dialog: RETURN TO SHOT
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: It worked...we're back on course!
text: Sean feels his confidence instantly rejuvenated. Miss Van
text: Deuten immediately embraces him. But a fraction of time
dialog: later:
scene_heading: TIGHT ON FIRE ALARM BUTTON
text: Jason's fist SMASHES the alarm button...
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
text: ...and a LOUD SIREN cries out across the entire vessel.
text: The blood drains from Sean's face.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: The fire alarm...
scene_heading: VARIOUS ANGLES ON BOARD SHIP - NIGHT
text: as the shrieking alarm assaults the main deck, hallways
text: and corridors, giving Julius, Miles and Wayne deep
dialog: pause for thought.
scene_heading: INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME
text: as the alarm bombards Rennie's ears like everybody
text: else's. She hurries to her curtained porthole window,
text: working up the energy to look outside. Rennie gets a grip
text: on them, FLINGING THEM OPEN. The DECK HAND'S CRAZED FACE
text: IS GAZING BACK AT HER. Rennie screams; a second later he
text: hurries off.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: as McCulloch tears open a cabinet door labeled EMERGENCY
text: FLARE GUN. The siren continues to blast.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Can you shut that damn thing off??
text: Sean moves to a bank of switches, his eyes darting around
text: for the appropriate switch. Miss Van Deusen sees
text: McCulloch remove the FLARE GUN from the cabinet.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: We already thought of that -- nobody
dialog: could possibly see it in this storm...
speaker_heading: MCCULIACH
dialog: There's only one person who needs to
dialog: see it. And I'm going to find him.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: What about the fire??
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: I doubt very much that one even
dialog: exists.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Use some common sense! Setting off a
dialog: fire alarm causes panic...the same
dialog: kind of panic caused by suggesting
text: Jason Voorhees is on board.
dialog: (resolved)
dialog: Enough is enough.
text: He marches out the door. Sean finds the alarm kill
text: switch, flipping it. The excruciating siren vanishes. He
text: grabs a pair of rain jackets, tossing one to Miss Van
dialog: Deusen.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: We have to get everybody together just
dialog: in case the fire's for real.
text: Sean heads for the door, shoving it forward.
scene_heading: EXT. DECK - ON DOOR
text: as it slams open...and JULIUS steps out, not Sean, from a
text: different deck door. TRACK with him as he treads along
text: the side of the ship, skeet rifle raised.
scene_heading: JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW
text: walking past the lifeboat stations, the wind and
text: precipitation battering the small boats. With no warning,
text: AN OBSCURE FIGURE LEAPS OUT, GRIPPING AN AXE.
speaker_heading: JULIUS
text: shoves the gun stock into his shoulder and takes
text: instantaneous aim...but he doesn't shoot. He slowly
text: lowers the rifle.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: as MILES lowers the axe. They've just scared the shit out
dialog: of each other.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I'll take the upper deck.
text: Julius nods. They separate. Neither boy notices the
text: smoke which is starting to emerge from a deck vent...
scene_heading: INT. POWER ROOM - NIGHT (EFX)
text: Filled with black smoke. The fire is spreading
text: dangerously close to a series of hoses attached to a fuel
text: pump, leading to tanks below. A sign over them reads:
scene_heading: DANGER - FUEL TANKS.
scene_heading: EXT. DECK POOL - NIGHT
text: --steaming and far from calm as the weather blitzes it.
text: Miles appears, climbing a ladder to the upper deck level.
text: POINT OF VIEW THROUGH LADDER
text: Someone is spying on Miles from below, watching his every
dialog: step.
scene_heading: EXT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS
text: as Miles arrives, axe raised. He pauses to regard his
text: surroundings, then moves on. RACK FOCUS TO FIND JASON
text: RIGHT BEHIND HIM, having followed Miles up the stairs.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Only darkness and rain for a beat, then Miles
text: materializes, curving around the gargantuan smokestack.
text: He passes us and we SWING AROUND, now looking at the back
text: of his head. He takes three more steps and JASON STEPS
text: INTO THE FOREGROUND. Miles senses his presence and JERKS
text: AROUND, RAISING THE AXE, BRINGING IT DOWN ON JASON'S
dialog: HEAD...
text: ...but Jason easily grabs the axe handle before it makes
text: contact, flinging it away.
scene_heading: EXT. LOWER DECK - ON JULIUS
text: He's pacing along when a clattering noise from above
text: makes him stop. Suddenly MILES' AXE THUDS INTO THE
text: MAHOGANY DECK NEXT TO HIS FOOT. Julius gazes at it,
text: jerking his head upward.
speaker_heading: JULIUS
dialog: Miles??
text: His answer is a LOUD CRACK OF LIGHTNING. At the same
dialog: time:
scene_heading: RUNNING WITH MILES
text: He's scrambling as fast as he can across the slippery
text: deck as the monster relentlessly pursues him.
scene_heading: JASON'S POINT OF VIEW
text: He's having no problem catching up to the defenseless
dialog: teenager.
scene_heading: EXT. DECK STAIRS - SAME TIME
text: as Julius zooms up them to aid his comrade.
scene_heading: EXT. RADAR MAST - NIGHT
text: as Miles slides up to the mast and begins scaling it. He
text: glances downward and sees:
scene_heading: MILES' POINT OF VIEW
text: Jason is right at his heels.
speaker_heading: MILES
text: slips on a rung, regains control, and continues upward.
text: He makes it three more steps, almost at the uppermost
text: point when JASON GRABS THE BACK OF HIS COAT, TEARING HIM
text: OFF THE MAST.
speaker_heading: STUNT FREEFALL
text: Miles cries out as he FREEFALLS BACKWARDS, somersaulting
text: and twisting like he's doing one of his better dives...
scene_heading: CLOSE UP - MILES' FACE
text: ...Empty space for a half-second, then MILES' FACE JOLTS
text: INTO FRAME with a look of ultimate agony. Something has
text: abruptly stopped his fall. Something quite fatal.
scene_heading: EXT. DECK - ON JULIUS
text: coming around a corner, stopping dead in his tracks, his
text: stomach wrenching as his eyes fall on:
speaker_heading: MILES (EFX)
text: ...who is staring right back at him with dead pupils.
text: MILES HAS BEEN HORRIBLY IMPALED OM A SHIP FLAGPOLE.
speaker_heading: JULIUS
text: doesn't get the chance to grasp the reality of it because
text: JASON'S HAND GRIPS HIS SHOULDER, SPINS HIM AROUND AND
text: SLUGS HIM SQUARELY IN THE FACE. The force of it sends the
text: boxer REELING BACKWARDS OFF THE RAILING...
scene_heading: EXT. STORMY OCEAN (TANK)
text: ...and Julius SPLASHES INTO THE ROUGH SEA. He's quickly
text: swallowed by the torrential waters.
scene_heading: INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - NIGHT
text: as Rennie's HAND jiggles her doorknob again, confirming
text: that it's locked tight. RISE to find her desperate face;
text: she begins furiously pacing and we DOLLY BEHIND HER
text: ...but Rennie stops cold upon hearing:
speaker_heading: YOUNG JASON (O.S.)
dialog: Hhhhelp....me....
text: Rennie whirls into a CLOSE UP, staring with disbelief at:
speaker_heading: YOUNG JASON (EFX)
text: ...who is standing on the oval rug in her stateroom, his
text: hands reaching out to her. But then comes the
text: inexplicable: THE OVAL RUG TURNS INTO LAKE WATER AND
text: JASON SINKS INTO IT. He's drowning in the middle of her
text: room, choking on murky water.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JASON
dialog: Hhhhelp me....I'm drowning...
speaker_heading: RENNIE
text: stands frozen, feeling herself drawn to him like a
text: magnet. She crawls to the edge of her rug, which is now a
text: deep lake, and extends her arms to him.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JASON
text: grabs her hand, pulling hard, then grinning wide.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
text: feels the skin on her face crawling off her skull, her
text: eyes expanding because she's now looking at:
speaker_heading: HERSELF!
text: Rennie is holding onto herself, about four years younger
text: in a bathing suit, drowning in the lake. YOUNG RENNIE.
speaker_heading: YOUNG RENNIE
dialog: Hhhhelp....me....
speaker_heading: RENNIE
text: screams with guttural fear, letting go of herself,
text: watching her younger self drown in the hole in her room.
speaker_heading: YOUNG RENNIE
text: disappears under the surface of the water...which seconds
text: later CHANGES BACK INTO HER OVAL RUG.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: as Rennie moves away, tears rolling down her face,
text: utterly confused. She backs against the wall next to her
text: porthole window and THE REAL JASON'S FIST SMASHES THROUGH
text: THE WINDOW, GRABBING HER THROAT. Rennie struggles,
text: gasping for air as he attempts to strangle her.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON RENNIE'S HAND
text: groping for a weapon to stop him, her fingers skittering
text: across her table like a spider.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - RENNIE AND JASON
text: Her head is pulled taut against the wall just below the
text: porthole, with Jason's hideous mask framed in the
text: circular shattered window. She's slowly dying.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON RENNIE'S HAND
text: Her movements slow as the oxygen leaves her system. But
text: Rennie's fingers miraculously find a recognizable object:
text: the ink-dip pen given to her by Miss Van Deusen. She
text: seizes it, getting a firm grip.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON JASON
text: as Rennie JABS THE PEN BACKWARDS, SENDING THE SHARP
text: INSTRUMENT THROUGH THE EYEHOLE OF HIS MASK. Jason
text: instantly releases her, reeling backwards.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
text: sinks to the floor, scrambling on all fours to get as far
text: away from the porthole as possible. She makes it across
text: the room to her stateroom door just as:
speaker_heading: THE DOOR
text: is SLAMMED OPEN FROM THE OTHER SIDE. She shrieks in
text: terror but it's SEAN who is standing there.

dialog: Rennie...??
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: The window...
text: Sean rushes to the shattered porthole, looking out,
text: seeing nothing. He steps back to her.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: I don't understand what is happening
dialog: to me...
text: She breaks down; he holds her.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: It's gonna be okay...
scene_heading: INT. POWER ROOM - NIGHT (EFX)
dialog: ...but Sean couldn't be more wrong. The flames are
text: lapping at the fuel pump and hoses, furiously burning
text: down into the tank. A second later the whole thing
text: EXPLODES IN A BALL OF FIRE.
scene_heading: EXT. SHIP HULL - UNDERWATER (EFX/MODEL?)
text: as a huge HOLE is blown through the thick steel hull:
scene_heading: INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME
text: The ship noticeably rocks from the explosion. Rennie
text: clings to him fearfully.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: What is it??
text: One second later, the lights begin to flicker.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: The power room...
scene_heading: INT. POWER ROOM - SAME TIME (EFX)
text: as huge amounts of water rush in from a gaping hole in
dialog: the hull.
scene_heading: INT. SHIP KITCHEN - SAME TIME
text: as the overhead lights flicker over McCulloch. There's
text: some fear mixed with the anger as he grips his flare gun,
text: moving onward.
scene_heading: PONT OF VIEW FROM KITCHEN OVENS
text: Someone is crouched behind a massive convection oven,
text: spying on McCulloch.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
text: almost flinches when the lights die and he's plunged
text: into blackness. He moves forward, every step tentative.
text: He passes the convection ovens and we REMAIN on them,
text: spotting the frightened face of the DECK HAND in the
text: shadows. The deranged old man is very sober now,
text: clutching a LARGE KITCHEN KNIFE for defense.
scene_heading: INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME
text: Sean paces feverishly in the blackness of her room,
text: trying to think, talking to himself.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Rule one, don't panic. Rule two,
dialog: assess the damage and act
dialog: accordingly...
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: Is the ship going to sink??
text: He returns to Rennie, the panic settling back in.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I don't know.
text: Her ultimate fear is staring her straight in the face.
text: Suddenly the dim blue lights flicker on.
speaker_heading: SEAN
text: The emergency lights just kicked in...
text: Sean makes Rennie look into his eyes. His words are meant
text: to convince himself as much as Rennie.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: We'll be okay. I want you to wait by
text: the lifeboats, just in case.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: (terrified)
dialog: I'm not going near any lifeboat!
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: But Rennie...
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: I'm not!!
scene_heading: INT. SHIP RESTAURANT ROOM - SAME TIME
text: as Miss Van Deusen gathers a handful of students who are
text: panicking, sitting them down.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: Everybody wait right here until I come
dialog: back with the others -- understand?
text: They nod, frightened to death. She dashes away, carrying
text: us into a view of the dining room windows. No one
text: notices the SILHOUETTE OF JASON passing by on the outside
dialog: desk.
scene_heading: INT. ENGINE ROOM - SAME TIME (EFX)
text: Sea water is pouring into the ship's motors. Clouds of
text: steam and black smoke fill the room as the engine
text: bearings begin to GRIND.
scene_heading: INT. SHIP HALLWAY - SAME TIME
text: as McCulloch rushes up to Rennie's already open door,
text: cautiously entering with flare gun raised.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Rennie??
scene_heading: MCCULLOCH'S POINT OF VIEW
text: The room is empty, shards of the porthole glass scattered
text: across her rug. He steps over to it, bringing his head up
text: to the gaping hole, peering outside. We wait for his
text: attack...but it doesn't come. McCulloch's eyes take us to
text: something across the room. The bathroom door is afar.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
text: cautiously steps up to the door, silently grabbing the
text: knob and SWINGING IT OPEN. It's empty. He hears
text: something, spinning around. Again, nothing is there.
text: McCulloch quickly moves to the telephone and dials. A few
text: seconds pass.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Come on, answer!!
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE - SAME TIME
text: TIGHT on the bridge telephone, ringing repeatedly. RISE
text: TO FIND JASON, ignoring the phone, scrutinizing the deck
text: below through rain-streaked windows.
scene_heading: JASON'S POINT OF VIEW
text: Miss Van Deusen is darting across the deck, gathering up
text: a trio of terrified seniors.
dialog: RETURN TO SHOT
text: Jason methodically moves to the bank of switches,
dialog: studying them.
scene_heading: INSERT - CONSOLE
text: In large, unmistakable letters over a red button are the
text: words "ABANDON SHIP ALARM." He flips back the plastic
text: safety cover, exposing the button.
scene_heading: INT. BOWELS OF SHIP - SAME TIME
text: A horrible grinding sound echoes through the narrow
text: corridor. Sean and Rennie appear at the opposite end,
text: coughing on the black smoke which clouds their
text: passageway. Sean looks down, seeing that they are
text: standing in a puddle of water.
speaker_heading: SEAN
text: Water has gotten to the engines.
dialog: (coughs)
dialog: We have to get everybody off this
dialog: ship...
scene_heading: INSERT - ABANDON SHIP BUTTON
text: as Jason presses it with firm deliberation, and:
scene_heading: INT. BOWELS OF SHIP - CONTINUOUS
text: A WHOOPING SIREN blasts through the passageway. Sean and
dialog: Rennie have no time to react because:
speaker_heading: ANGLE - CORRIDOR (EFX)
text: A sealed compartment door EXPLODES OPEN WITH THE PRESSURE
text: OF SEA WATER...
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE (EFX)
text: ...and a WALL OF WATER ENGULFS.RENNIE AND SEAN, KNOCKING
text: THEM DOWN. Sean fights to pull her up, but not in time
dialog: for her to witness:
speaker_heading: WAYNE'S CHARRED CORPSE (EFX)
text: which bobs up in front of her. Rennie cries out,
text: scrambling to grab onto Sean as what's left of Wayne's
text: body washes past them.
scene_heading: EXT. DECK - NIGHT
text: as a door opens and Miss Van Deusen guides a half-dozen
text: SENIORS over to the LIFEBOAT STATIONS.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: (shouting over storm)
dialog: Everybody climb in!
text: They follow her orders as the Abandon Ship alarm wretches
dialog: on. But little do they know that:
text: STALKING POINT OF VIEW
text: Someone is briskly moving towards the group and Miss Van
text: Deusen. Just as we are within a few feet of her...
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: --It's MCCULLOCH who's approached them. He grabs Miss Van
text: Deusen, shaking her violently.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: What did you do with Rennie??
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: Nothing! I went to her cabin and...
text: McCulloch rushes off before she can finish. Miss Van
text: Deusen turns back to the other kids, helping them into
dialog: the boat.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: Everybody hurry...please...
scene_heading: EXT. DECK - CLOSE ON MAHOGANY DECKING - SAME TIME
text: We slowly DOLLY BACKWARDS until Miles' AXE comes into
text: frame, still stuck in the mahogany decking. A beat, then
text: JASON'S HALAL DISLODGES IT FROM THE WOOD.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: as Sean climbs up from below, soaked to the bone, pulling
text: up a half-conscious Rennie. Sean carries her around a
text: corner, where he collides with McCulloch. McCulloch
text: pulls Rennie away from him.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: She never should've set foot on this
dialog: ship. This is your fault!
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: This is Jason's fault!
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Not another word, do you hear me??
scene_heading: EXT. LIFEBOAT STATIONS - NIGHT
text: as Miss Van Deusen throws the "down" lever and the
text: lifeboat hoist begins to lower the boat. Camera SLOWLY
scene_heading: CREEPS IN A SEMI-CIRCLE AS A SILHOUETTED FIGURE STEPS
text: INTO A POOL OF LIGHT BEHIND HER. JASON.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - LIFEBOAT
text: One of the students screams, the others clinging together
text: upon the sight of this infamous monster. But the boat is
text: already over the edge, past the point of return. And
text: lowering at a snail's pace.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
text: turns to see JASON APPROACHING THEM WITH AXE RAISED. She
text: backs away but Jason ignores her, heading directly for
text: the hoist. He arches back with his weapon and SLICES
scene_heading: DOWNWARD.
scene_heading: INSERT - HOIST CABLE (SECOND UNIT)
text: as Jason's axe CHOPS THE CABLE IN TWO, and:
speaker_heading: EXT. SHIP/OCEAN (TANK)
text: The bow cable SNAPS, DUMPING THE HALF DOZEN TEENAGERS
text: INTO THE TURBULENT SALT WATER. They last about five
text: seconds before succumbing to a drowning death.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
text: sees it all, her intestines constricting in agonizing
text: knots. She summons all her rationale and sends it down to
text: her legs, running away as fast as she can.
scene_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN'S POINT OF VIEW
text: --knocking down deck tables, chairs and chaise lounges as
text: she flees. The creative writing teacher swerves around a
text: column, heading for an interior door, sliding to a stop
text: as it BANGS OPEN IN FRONT OF HER. McCulloch steps
text: outside, carrying Rennie, with Sean right behind her.
text: Rennie is conscious now, squirming free of her uncle upon
text: the sight of Miss Van Deusen.
text: ANGLE TO INCLUDE ALL
text: as Rennie rushes into Miss Van Deusen's arms. The teacher
text: holds her, beginning to cry herself.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Why aren't you with the others,
dialog: woman??
text: Finally the message comes forth:
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: Jason...he has an axe...
text: His face grows taut with anger.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Jason Voorhees is dead!!
text: A PRIMAL SCREAM OF AGONY immediately cries out behind
text: them, the words unintelligible. They turn around to
text: witness THE DECK HANG STAGGERING TOWARDS THEM, GRIPPING
text: THE KITCHEN KNIFE.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
text: raises the flare gun with zero hesitation and FIRES IT...
speaker_heading: ANGLE - DECK HAND (EFX)
text: ...and the charge EXPLODES INTO HIS CHEST. He stands
text: there with his chest smoldering, almost like a gargoyle
text: in effigy. A second later the poor old man falls forward,
dialog: and:
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON HIS BACK (EFX)
text: They all see that JASON'S AXE HAS BEEN BURIED IN HIS
speaker_heading: BACK.
scene_heading: RETURN TO MASTER
text: McCulloch gazes with utter disbelief.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Dear Christ...
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: We have to get off this ship!!
text: They back away from the horrid sight and begin to run,
text: the Abandon Ship alarm still attacking their ears.
scene_heading: EXT. LIFEBOAT STATIONS - NIGHT
text: as McCulloch, Miss Van Deusen, Rennie and Sean scramble
text: to the closest lifeboat.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Everybody in -- I'll get the hoists
text: McCulloch has no time for politeness, moving to the
text: lifeboat ahead of the women. Rennie stops cold, gazing
text: classy-eyed at the small boat.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: Come on, sweetheart -- get in...
text: But she doesn't budge. McCulloch levels wild eyes on her,
text: quickly climbing back down.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Get in the boat, Rennie!
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: I...I can't...
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: (shaking her)
dialog: You can and you will!!
text: He tries to slap her out of it, dragging her over to the
text: boat, ignoring her terror-stricken frenzy.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Stop it!!
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: Leave her alone, Charles!
text: Miss Van Deusen quickly moves to a hysterical Rennie and
text: holds her, eyeing McCulloch vehemently.
scene_heading: EXT. DECK - TIGHT ON DEAD DECK HAND - SAME TIME
text: as rain begins to wash the blood from his back. JASON'S
text: FOOT TRUDGES INTO FRAME...then his HAND REACHES DOWN,
text: RETRIEVING HIS AXE FROM THE DECK HAND'S SPINE.
scene_heading: EXT. LIFEBOAT STATIONS - SAME TIME
text: as Rennie clings to	 Miss Van Deusen, crying.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: It's the only way, Rennie. Let's get
dialog: in the boat now, okay? Please...for
dialog: me?
text: Rennie finds herself nodding. Miss Van Deusen helps the
text: trembling girl up the steps, an angered McCulloch right
dialog: behind.
scene_heading: INT. LIFEBOAT - CONTINUOUS
text: as Rennie climbs over the boat edge, RECOILING AT THE
text: SOUND OF A SNARLING DOG. Toby is curled up in the
text: corner of the lifeboat, teeth bared.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: Toby...
text: She climbs in, moving to her equally, relieved dog,
text: McCulloch and Miss Van Deusen right behind her.
scene_heading: INSERT - HOIST BUTTON (SECOND UNIT)
text: as Sean jabs it and the hoist motor kicks in.
scene_heading: EXT. SHIP - WIDE SHOT (EFX)
text: just as a huge BOLT OF LIGHTNING cracks over the smoke
text: stack and upper deck. JASON steps out from behind it,
text: gaping down on them with frightening omnipresence.
text: Gripping the bloody axe.
scene_heading: EXT. LIFEBOAT STATIONS - CONTINUOUS
text: Sean climbs in the boat as it continues to lower. He
text: takes one look back at the ship and sees:
speaker_heading: JASON
text: rapidly moving down the staircase towards them. Sean's
text: view is CUT OFF as the lifeboat sinks below deck level.
dialog: RETURN TO SHOT
text: as Sean's eyes dart around, down to the sea, up at the
dialog: hoist.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Come on...faster....
scene_heading: JASON'S POINT OF VIEW
text: trampling towards the hoist, about thirty feet away now.
text: The boat has already disappeared over the edge.
scene_heading: EXT. SHIP/STORMY SEA - NIGHT (TANK)
text: as the lifeboat continues to lower, about ten feet from
text: making contact with the tumultuous ocean. The ship's hull
text: is crooked and sinking.
scene_heading: TRACKING WITH JASON
text: as he relentlessly moves to the hoist cable, raising his
dialog: axe.
scene_heading: EXT. SHIP/STORMY SEA (TANK)
text: as the ship finally touches water, and:
scene_heading: INSERT - HOIST CABLE (SECOND UNIT
text: Jason's axe blade CHOPS THE CABLE...
scene_heading: EXT. SHIP/STORMY SEA (TANK)
text: ...and the hoist cable falls limply over them. Jason's
text: too late. Sean looks up and sees:
speaker_heading: JASON
text: standing by the hoist, hovering over the edge. Very
dialog: angry.
speaker_heading: SEAN (TANK)
text: grabs an oar, turning back to McCulloch.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Start rowing!!
text: McCulloch takes the oar as Miss Van Deusen holds onto
text: Rennie tightly, the girl's eyes squeezed shut. Sean looks
text: up at the ship again, and:
scene_heading: SEAN'S POINT OF VIEW
dialog: Jason is none.
scene_heading: EXT. SHIP/STORMY SEA (TANK)
text: Sean looks around with confusion as huge waves, wind and
text: rain pummel them.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: He's gone...
scene_heading: POINT OF VIEW FROM WATER (TANK)
text: ...or is he? We're moving towards the lifeboat at water
text: level, almost like a shark preparing for attack.
speaker_heading: INT. LIFEBOAT (TANK)
text: Sean breathes with some relief, resuming his rowing with
text: McCulloch. They get about three strokes apiece before:
speaker_heading: A DARK FIGURE (TANK)
text: lunges from under the ocean surface, grabbing onto
text: Sean. Everybody SCREAMS...but it's JULIUS, gasping for
text: oxygen, spitting up seawater. Sean pulls him over the
dialog: edge.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: It's Julius!
dialog: Miss Van Deusen moves to help him and we:
scene_heading: SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STORMY OCEAN - WIDE SHOT - DAY (SECOND UNIT)
text: The ship is gone now, the lifeboat a speck in the ocean.
scene_heading: INT. LIFEBOAT - DAY (OCEAN?)
text: The water is less rough now, the rain replaced with fog.
text: Julius has taken McCulloch's place behind an oar;
text: McCulloch is flanking his shivering niece with Miss Van
dialog: Deusen.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: (miserable)
dialog: If we don't find the shore soon we're
dialog: all going to die.
text: Sean tries to ignore him, keeping his mind on rowing.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: (unable to hide fear)
dialog: Do you know where we are, Sean?
text: Sean pauses, utterly exhausted. He thinks for a moment,
text: remembering his father's gift. Sean reaches into his coat
text: pocket, removing the pocket navigational calculator. He
text: stares at it long and hard. Julius looks over at him,
text: seeing that Sean is on the verge of tears. He grips his
dialog: shoulder.
speaker_heading: JULIUS
dialog: Hey man, if I can make it, so can.
dialog: you.
text: Sean slowly nods, turning on the calculator.
scene_heading: SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT (TANK)
text: as the lifeboat rows into frame, the water relatively
dialog: calm.
scene_heading: INT. LIFEBOAT - NIGHT (TANK)
text: McCulloch, Rennie and Miss Van Deusen are asleep, Sean
text: and Julius rowing on sheer will power. Sean takes one
text: more stroke, feels himself passing out, then regains his
text: coherence again. Julius glances off the side of the ship
text: for no particular reason, then does a doubletake.
scene_heading: JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW (SECOND UNIT - N.Y.)
text: They are rowing right past THE STATUE OF LIBERTY,
text: illuminated in all its glory.
speaker_heading: INT. LIFEBOAT (TANK)
text: Julius feels his eyes widening and a huge smile taking
text: control of his haggard face. He tugs on Sean's sleeve,
text: his eyes never leaving the monument.
speaker_heading: JULIUS
dialog: Hey man, wake up! Check it out!!
text: The other stir as well, opening their eyes, not sure if
text: it's some kind of vision or if they are genuinely here.
speaker_heading: JULIUS
dialog: God damn, we're in New York! You did
dialog: it, my man!!
text: Julius howls with delight, Miss Van Deusen hugging Rennie
text: as Julius gives Sean the high-five. Toby barks.
scene_heading: WIDE SHOT - NEW YORK HARBOR - NIGHT (SECOND UNIT - N.Y.)
text: as the lifeboat rows toward the very famous skyline of
text: Manhattan, twinkling in the near distance. We can hear
text: the faint sound of Julius singing "New York, New York,"
text: relieved to be alive. They're going to make it.
scene_heading: EXT. EMPTY OCEAN - ANOTHER ANGLE (TANK)
text: as the sound of Julius' voice grows fainter. The water
text: begins to ripple...then the top half of a HOCKEY MASK
text: BREAKS THE SURFACE FOR A BREATH OF AIR, SINKING AGAIN.
dialog: And swimming onward.
scene_heading: EXT. CANNERY HARBOR - NIGHT
text: as Julius and Sean row the lifeboat up to a narrow barge
text: beneath deserted dock warehouses. They are not in the
text: safest part of town by a longshot.
speaker_heading: CLOSER ANGLE
text: as they climb onto the barge. Rennie breathes with relief
text: as she steps off the boat. She takes a final glance back
text: at it and sees:
speaker_heading: YOUNG RENNIE
text: flailing her arms in the water right next to the
text: lifeboat, drowning.
speaker_heading: YOUNG RENNIE
dialog: Hhhhelp...me....
text: Suddenly a DECOMPOSED HAND REACHES UP FROM BELOW,
text: GRABBING HER, DRAGGING HER UNDER.
scene_heading: EXT. BARGE - ON RENNIE
text: She gazes in utter shock, screaming:
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: No!!!
text: They all follow her eyeline...but the water is calm,
dialog: nothing there.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: (holding her)
dialog: It's okay...you're safe now...
text: McCulloch grits his teeth.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Come on -- everybody up the ladder.
text: He's the first one up. Sean looks at Rennie, concerned,
text: then hoists Toby up in his arms. They all begin climbing
dialog: the ladder.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON LADDER - NIGHT
text: as the last pair of feet disappear over the top edge of
text: the dock. Camera PANS back down the rungs, finding the
text: lifeboat and barge again. Suddenly JASON SPRINGS FROM THE
text: WATER, CLIMBING ONTO THE BARGE. He gazes up at his new
dialog: surroundings, quite different from all the years he's
text: spent at Crystal Lake. But an item at the far end of the
dialog: dock causes him the longest pause...
scene_heading: JASON'S POINT OF VIEW
text: A tattered billboard over one of the warehouses
text: advertises the NEW YORK RANGERS HOCKEY TEAM, featuring a
text: full shot of the HOCKEY-MASKED GOALIE.
speaker_heading: JASON
text: looks at it long and hard. He tears off his life

scene_heading: WIDE SHOT - BARGE AND DOCK WAREHOUSES - NIGHT
text: as Jason heads up the ladder. He's about to take

scene_heading: EXT. CANNERY WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT

speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: There must be a phone around here

speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: A wonderful choice of places to dock a

text: Sean looks away, trying to keep from losing his temper.
scene_heading: PREDATOR'S POINT OF VIEW - SAME TIME
text: We're spying on them from behind a stack of crates as

text: GUNS. Nervous young druggies.
speaker_heading: GANG RANGER #1
dialog: Hands up!!
speaker_heading: GANG BANGER #2
dialog: Do it!!
text: All hands go up. Gang Banger #2 grabs McCulloch's watch

speaker_heading: GANG BANGER #2
dialog: Got some good shit here, holmes.
speaker_heading: GANG BANGER #1
dialog: (eyeing Rennie)
dialog: You got that right...
text: He steps over to Rennie, brushing her hair back with the
text: barrel of his revolver, spotting the Statue of Liberty
dialog: pendant Sean gave her.
speaker_heading: GANG BANGER #L
dialog: Now ain't that sweet.
text: He tears it off her neck, pocketing it. Sean angrily
text: moves toward him and Gang Banger #l shoves the barrel
text: against Rennie's temple.
speaker_heading: GANG BANGER #1
dialog: Go ahead, superman. Be a hero.
text: Sean has no choice but to freeze. Julius flexes his
text: fists, but he too has Gang Banger #2's gun leveled on
text: him. McCulloch stares at the thugs with obvious contempt.
text: It doesn't go unnoticed.
speaker_heading: GANG BANGER #L
dialog: You got a problem, Dad?
text: McCulloch offers some rare silence, shaking a "no" to the
text: gun-toting kid. Rennie's dog-begins to growl, backing
text: away, ready to defend her. Gang Banger #1 points his
text: barrel at Toby with zero conscience, cocking back the
dialog: hammer.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: No!
text: She pushes his arm to the side just as the bullet
dialog: FIRES...
speaker_heading: ANGLE - TOBY

dialog: RETURN TO SHOT
text: Gang Banger #1 grabs Rennie by the hair, brutally jerking

speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: Please, don't hurt her...
speaker_heading: GANG BANGER #L
dialog: Hurt this princess?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Would I do that?
text: They cough out laughs. Gang Banger #1 looks into Rennie's
text: eyes, his barrel still on her skin.
speaker_heading: GANG BANGER #1
dialog: You look like a party girl, princess.
dialog: How'd you like to go on a date with me
dialog: and my friend? If you're free, that
dialog: is.
text: More phlegm-filled laughs. He drags her away, Gang Banger
text: #2 backing away with him with his gun still trained on
dialog: the others.
speaker_heading: GANG BANGER #2
dialog: You follow and we'll blow her fuckin'
dialog: head off, comprende?
text: The others watch helplessly as Rennie is abducted.
speaker_heading: JULIUS
dialog: We can't let those gang-bangers get
dialog: away, man...
text: Julius starts to move after them. McCulloch grabs him.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: You heard him! We have to call the
dialog: police
text: Julius jerks away from McCulloch's grasp. But he knows
text: McCulloch	is right.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Everyone split up -- we'll cover more
dialog: ground that way.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: I don't think that's such a safe idea
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: My niece's life hangs in the balance
dialog: right now!! Every second counts.
text: No more rebuttal. They hurry off.
scene_heading: EXT. GANG BANGER'S LAIR - NIGHT
text: It's a narrow passageway between warehouses...decrepit
text: brownstones with shattered chicken-wire windows, moss
text: growing on the bricks. The Gang Bangers appear with

speaker_heading: GANG BANGER #L
dialog: Welcome to the casbah, princess.
text: PAN AROUND with them as they walk through a thick blanket
text: of STEAM which pours out of a factory vent. We MOVE
text: through the mist with them, revealing a tattered, rain-
text: soaked couch and chair, upholstery shredded. A spool once
text: used for telephone wire functions as their coffee table.
text: They splash through puddles, throwing her down on the
dialog: couch.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE

scene_heading: CLOSE UP - SYRINGE

speaker_heading: RENNIE

speaker_heading: HER HARD.
speaker_heading: GANG BANGER #1

speaker_heading: GANG BANGER #1

text: THICKLY, HIS EYES BUGGING OUT.
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
text: Jason is standing right behind him, shoving something
text: into his back, out of frame. He thrusts it again,
text: bringing with it one more horrific grunt from the kid.
dialog: Jason goes for number three and:
scene_heading: CLOSE UP - GANG BANGER #1'S CHEST (EFX)
text: Jason's syringe gets shoved completely through him, the
text: needle sticking out his front side.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
text: opens her eyes, looking into the dead boy's face as
text: blood drips from his mouth. He collapses in front of
text: her, giving way to a view of JASON TOWERING OVER HER. At
dialog: the same time:
speaker_heading: GANG BANGER #2
text: comes around the corner.
speaker_heading: GANG BANGER #2
dialog: Forgot my money, holmes...
text: Ha stops dead in his tracks at the sight of Jason.
speaker_heading: GANG BANGER #2
dialog: Who the fuck are you?
text: Jason paces toward him. The kid glances at his dead
text: friend arched over the couch, quickly whipping out his
dialog: .38.
speaker_heading: GANG BANGER #2
dialog: You're dead, fuckhead.
dialog: BANG!
text: ...but Jason keeps on coming. Five shots later and
text: Jason's still standing, easily picking up the slime ball
text: and SHOVING HIM HEAD FIRST INTO THE MOSSY BRICK WALL. The
text: kid falls in a bloody heap.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
text: shoves Gang Banger #1 off of her as Jason returns his
text: attention to her. She grabs a loose brick and FLINGS IT
text: AT HIM, CRACKING HIS HOCKEY MASK, momentarily
text: disorienting him. Rennie sprints away.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY #1 - NIGHT (LONG LENS)
text: as Julius runs into view, looking down a menacing alley,
text: spotting a phone booth. He hurries for it.
scene_heading: PREDATOR'S POINT OF VIEW
text: Like a cat watching a bird, we watch Julius head for the
dialog: booth.
speaker_heading: JULIUS
text: slams open the booth door, grabbing the receiver,
text: punching the "operator" digit. SLOWLY PUSH IN on him as
text: he waits for an answer. Several more rings.
speaker_heading: JULIUS
dialog: C'mon...
text: Finally a click and muffled words from the operator.
speaker_heading: JULIUS
dialog: Get me the police -- this is an
dialog: emergency...
dialog: 
text: SMASH! as JASON'S FIST CRASHES THROUGH THE BOOTH WINDOW,
text: GRABBING JULIUS BY THE THROAT. Julius grips Jason's scaly
text: arm with all his strength, staring at the cracked hockey
text: mask framed in the shattered window. Julius summons all
text: his strength, tearing free of Jason's grasp and running
text: out the door. The phone is left dangling.
scene_heading: RUNNING WITH JULIUS (HAND HELD)
text: with no apparent direction. Literally running for his
dialog: life.
scene_heading: TRACKING WITH JASON
text: He's just as quick, but smoother and more methodical.
scene_heading: JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW (HAND HELD)
text: heading up the alley, spotting a fire escape, diverting
dialog: his course straight for it.
scene_heading: ANGLE - FIRE ESCAPE
text: as Julius LEAPS ONTO IT, dragging himself up, climbing as
dialog: fast as is humanly possible.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - JASON
text: ...but Jason is-far from human, easily negotiating the
text: wrought-iron stairs and rapidly catching up.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS
text: as Julius' head appears, clawing his way onto the tar-
text: papered surface, running to the opposite side. A second
text: later, JASON HOPS UP RIGHT BEHIND HIM.
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: as Julius soon learns the awful truth that the only way
dialog: up is the only way down...with the exception of a head-
text: splitting freefall. No way is he gonna jump. Julius turns
text: back to Jason, raising his fists, psyching himself up for
text: the fight of his life. He whispers to himself:
speaker_heading: JULIUS
dialog: Use the combos and keep the feet
dialog: light...
text: THE FIGHT BEGINS, man against monster, each sizing the
dialog: other up.
text: Jason takes the first swing, Julius deftly dodging him
text: and countering with left-right-left combination. They
text: have absolutely no effect. Julius follows up with a round
text: of kidney punches. Again, nothing. Julius finds himself
text: being forced back against the rings, which in this case
text: is the edge of the roof. He risks a glance backwards and
dialog: sees:
scene_heading: JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW
dialog: It's a long, rough way down. It's do or die time.
scene_heading: RETURN TO SCENE
text: as Julius SLAMS PUNCH AFTER PUNCH INTO JASON, forcing him
text: back to the center of the rooftop, spending every last
text: ounce of his energy in doing so. He throws one more
text: feeble punch, knowing it's his last.
speaker_heading: JULIUS
dialog: Take your best shot, motherfucker...
text: Jason gladly obliges, winding up and recoiling with a
dialog: punch none of us expected...
speaker_heading: JULIUS' HEAD (EFX)
text: gets literally knocked off his shoulders, cascading off
text: the edge of the rooftop, and:
scene_heading: ANGLE - SLANTED LOWER ROOF
text: --the decapitated head lands on a sloped roof below,
text: rolling down towards street level and falling into a
text: garbage-filled dumpster.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY #2 - NIGHT
text: as Rennie dizzily runs down the alley, the effects of the
text: drugs kicking in.
scene_heading: RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX)
text: Blurry, disoriented, erratic. Suddenly A FIGURE JUMPS OUT
text: FROM A CORRIDOR IN FRONT OF HER.
dialog: RETURN TO SHOT
text: It's SEAN. He rushes to her, sensing her disorientation.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Rennie...what'd they do to you??
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: Drugs...
dialog: (serious pause)
dialog: Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
dialog: Oh Jesus. He never expected this.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: We have to find the others.
text: Together they run off.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY #3 - NIGHT (OVERHEAD ANGLE)
text: as Miss Van Deusen briskly walks below us, far from
text: relaxed in this threatening environment.
speaker_heading: TRACKING SHOT
text: She moves forward, the only sound being her shoes against
text: wet asphalt. Four more steps, then a DARK, OUT OF FOCUS
text: FIGURE STEPS OUT BEHIND HER WITH A GUN.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Freeze.
text: RACK FOCUS to find a uniformed IRISH COP standing there,
text: service revolver raised. McCulloch steps out from the
text: alcove as well, recognizing Miss Van Deusen.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: It's okay -- she's with me.
text: She turns around, lowering her hands, utterly relieved.
speaker_heading: IRISH COP
dialog: My apologies, Miss. My unit's right
dialog: over here.
text: They head through an ABANDONED PARKING LOT towards a
text: concrete wall with stairs; about six feet above the wall
text: is an upper street, where his patrol car is parked. They
text: get halfway through the lot when they hear:
speaker_heading: SEAN (O.S.)
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: as Sean and Rennie run to join them from the alley.
text: McCulloch rushes to his niece.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Rennie, thank God...
text: But Rennie goes to Miss Van Deusen instead. It's a bitter
dialog: pill for McCulloch.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Jason's here in New York.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Don't be ridiculous!
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: Is it true, Rennie??
text: She nods, unable to repress her fear.
speaker_heading: IRISH COP
dialog: Is this the lass in question?
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: (stewing)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: IRISH COP
dialog: Who is...Jason?
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
text: He's a walking corpse, a phantasm from
dialog: hell.
text: The others stare at McCulloch angrily. Miss Van Deusen
text: turns to the confused policeman.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: I'm afraid you'll have some trouble
dialog: believing us.
speaker_heading: IRISH COP
dialog: So try me.
scene_heading: EXT. SQUAD CAR - NIGHT
text: parked above the abandoned garage, the interior dark. The
text: Cop and our heroes appear in the background, coming
text: towards it.
speaker_heading: IRISH COP
dialog: You're right -- I find it a tall tale
dialog: indeed.
dialog: But you seem like honest folks so I'm
dialog: inclined to believe at least some of
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MISS VAN DEUSEN
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: Thank you. The first thing we' have to
dialog: do is find Julius.
speaker_heading: IRISH COP
dialog: I'm sure he'll pop up soon enough. Why
dialog: don't you climb in the back while I
dialog: radio for backup.
text: ADJUST INTO A FULL SHOT OF THE BACK DOOR AS HE SWINGS IT
text: OPEN...but even in this darkness, we see that it's
text: empty. They climb in. The Cop opens his drivers door,
dialog: and...
scene_heading: INSERT - DOME LIGHT (SECOND UNIT)
text: The car dome light blinks on, and...
scene_heading: ANGLE - BACK SEAT
text: Our four survivors' faces are brightly illuminated,
text: INSTANTLY CHANGING TO GASPS AND SCREAMS because:
speaker_heading: THEIR POINT OF VIEW (EFX)
text: Julius' severed head is resting on the dash board,
dialog: staring back at them!!!
speaker_heading: ANGLE - COP
text: reacting to their terror, seeing Julius' head, quickly
text: grabbing the radio mike. But he has no time for a message
text: because JASON REACHES UP FROM THE PARKING LOT PIT BELOW,
text: GRABBING THE COP'S ANKLE, DRAGGING HIM DOWN. The radio is
text: still in his grasp.
scene_heading: INSERT - DISPATCH RADIO (SECOND UNIT)
text: as the radio cord grows taut, finally snapping. The
text: Irish cop's awful yell echoes over it, silencing after a
speaker_heading: sick THUD.
scene_heading: INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: The foursome instantly try to flee the car, but police
text: cars have no door handles in the back.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: There aren't any handles!!
text: Cocaine flowing through her veins, Rennie acts
text: hyperkinetically, scratching her way over the seats just
dialog: as:
speaker_heading: JASON
text: appears at the parking lot stairs, STALKING STRAIGHT
text: TOWARDS THE CAR.
scene_heading: INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: There is no time for escape. Rennie finds the ignition
text: and fires it up, jamming it into drive and STOMPING ON
text: THE ACCELERATOR. Julius' head rolls off the dash, onto
text: the floorboards.
scene_heading: RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX)
text: Her vision is still a stoned one but clear enough to set
text: her target. We come straight at the abominable creature
dialog: and:
speaker_heading: WHAM! (EFX)
text: Jason is mowed down.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
text: slams on the brakes, jerks it into reverse and FLOORS IT
speaker_heading: AGAIN.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON JASON (EFX)
text: as the automobile grinds back over him a second time.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
text: stomps on the brake pedal and the tires SCREECH TO A
text: HALT. They all take a moment to catch their breath,
text: looking out the front window...
scene_heading: THEIR POINT OF VIEW
text: Jason lies dead on the asphalt. For about two seconds. He
scene_heading: SLOWLY STANDS.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
text: desperately throws it into forward again, gripping the
text: wheel and RACING FORWARD.
scene_heading: POINT OF VIEW FROM FRONT BUMPER (STUNT DRIVE)
text: Jason's standing there for one second, but the next
text: moment he is LEAPING OUT OF THE WAY...
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED PARKING LOT (STUNT DRIVE)
text: ...and the squad car SMASHES THROUGH A CHAIN LINK FENCE,
text: FREEFALLING TO THE ABANDONED PARKING LOT BELOW.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY #3 - CONTINUOUS (STUNT DRIVE)
text: as the car bottoms out, then swerves into a sharp right
text: turn, racing down the alley.
scene_heading: POINT OF VIEW FROM FRONT BUMPER (STUNT DRIVE)
text: as Jason appears at the end of the alley, blocking their
dialog: retreat.
scene_heading: INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: as Rennie stomps the brake pedal, jerking it into
dialog: reverse...
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY #3 - CONTINUOUS (STUNT DRIVE)
text: as she backs up, changes gears and races down an
text: intersecting alley.
scene_heading: POINT OF VIEW FROM FRONT BUMPER (STUNT DRIVE)
text: speeding towards an escape when JASON POPS OUT AGAIN!
dialog: He's everywhere all at once...
scene_heading: INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: slamming on the discs one more time, flooring it into
dialog: reverse.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON TIRES - CONTINUOUS (SECOND UNIT)
text: as the squad car's rear tires smoke and spin, finally
text: gripping pavement.
scene_heading: POINT OF VIEW OUT REAR WINDOW (STUNT DRIVE)
text: as we fly backwards...and JASON APPEARS BEHIND THEM!!
scene_heading: TIGHT ON REAR VIEW MIRROR
text: --Rennie's terrified face filling it, seeing that Jason
text: is in back of them.
scene_heading: TIGHT ON REAR TIRES (SECOND UNIT)
text: as they screech to a halt one final time, rapidly
text: rotating in the opposite direction and speeding out of
dialog: frame.
scene_heading: INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: Rennie is almost maniacal now, her knuckles white around
text: the vinyl wheel, her foot practically mashed through the
text: floorboard.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Rennie, for God's sake slow down!!
text: She doesn't hear him, or anything for that matter. Her
text: eyes remain straight ahead, never blinking.
scene_heading: RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX)
text: There's a FIGURE standing in the distance. But it looks
text: too small to be Jason. We RUSH TOWARDS IT, CHANGING INTO
text: SLOW MOTION JUST BEFORE IMPACT. The figure is a dripping
text: wet boy with a sinister smile. YOUNG JASON.
scene_heading: EXT. BRICK WALL - A SPLIT SECOND LATER (EFX)
text: as the front of the squad car RAMS THE BRICK WALL HEAD-
text: ON, THE HOOD BURSTING INTO FLAMES.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: as the front passenger door is shoved open by Sean, who
text: drags out Rennie. McCulloch follows close behind, helping
text: Sean carry her away from the wreckage, over by a row of
text: old oil drums filled with slime and rainwater. Then it
text: suddenly hits Sean...
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Miss Van Deusen...
text: He takes two steps back to the car when:
speaker_heading: BOOM! (EFX)
text: The squad car interior is ENGULFED IN A BALL OF FLAMES.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
text: opens her dazed eyes, seeing Miss Van Deusen's body
text: charring inside the wreckage. It's incomprehensible. She
text: numbly gets to her feet, stepping towards it. Something
text: makes her hesitate: she peers down at the asphalt...
scene_heading: EXT. ASPHALT - RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX)
text: A pool of gasoline has collected, flames dancing across
text: its glassy surface. Suddenly a TINY ROWBOAT DISSOLVES IN,
text: not unlike the lifeboat she was so afraid of. The
text: rowboat glides across the surface of the burning
text: gasoline, TWO PEOPLE RIDING IN IT. The flames and asphalt
text: SLOWLY FADE OUT AND GIVE WAY TO A SERENE LAKE.
scene_heading: RENNIE'S FLASHBACK - CRYSTAL LAKE - DAY
text: Shimmering water, clouds and pine trees reflected in it.
text: The rowboat floats into view. The two occupants are YOUNG
text: RENNIE and MCCULLOCH. She's wearing a bathing suit and an
text: innocent smile. And not an inkling of fear about the
text: water. She stands, letting the sun soak into her.
speaker_heading: YOUNG RENNIE
dialog: What a beautiful day.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
text: She frowns at him, looking away.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: You've been coming out here every
dialog: summer for the last three years, young
dialog: lady, and you still haven't learned
dialog: how.
speaker_heading: YOUNG RENNIE
dialog: I'll take some lessons this time. I
dialog: promise.
text: She bends over, splashing the water.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: That's what you said last year. I
dialog: think the time for your first swimming
dialog: lesson has just come.
text: The splashing stops.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: You don't want to end up drowning like
dialog: that Voorhees boy, do you?
text: She's instantly tense.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: He never learned how either and he's
text: still at the bottom of this lake.
speaker_heading: YOUNG RENNIE
dialog: He is not.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
text: Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull
dialog: down anybody who falls in and can't
dialog: swim.
speaker_heading: YOUNG RENNIE
dialog: You're telling a lie.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Am I? Let's find out.
text: ...And quicker than she's able to react to it, MCCULLOCH
text: PUSHES HER OVERBOARD.
speaker_heading: SPLASH!
text: as Rennie's body violently disrupts the calm surface.
text: She immediately begins to flounder. McCulloch calmly
text: leans over the edge.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: Better swim before Jason drags you
dialog: down, Rennie. Come on, you can do
dialog: it...
text: ...but Rennie thrashes in the water, struggling to keep
text: from sinking under the surface.
scene_heading: RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW
text: Her uncle's face blurs and clears as water splashes her
dialog: eyes.
speaker_heading: YOUNG RENNIE
dialog: I...I can't...
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
speaker_heading: RENNIE
text: is too panicked to obey.
speaker_heading: YOUNG RENNIE
dialog: Hhhhelp...me....
text: She coughs on some water then disappears...
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER (TANK)
text: The world above her ceases to exist, murky lake water
text: taking over. Rennie looks-down, and to her horror...
scene_heading: RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (TANK)
text: Young Jason is grabbing her ankle and dragging her
text: down. The whole image BURSTS INTO FLAMES and we:
scene_heading: DISSOLVE BACK TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ASPHALT - NIGHT
text: as the gasoline continues to burn, the rowboat gone.
text: ADJUST to find RENNIE'S FACE, the flames of the car
text: wreckage flickering over her glassy eyes. She looks up at
text: Miss Van Deusen's body one last time before:
speaker_heading: ANGLE - SQUAD CAR (EFX)
text: The auto's fuel tank EXPLODES, SHRAPNEL FLYING
scene_heading: EVERYWHERE.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY #4 - CONTINUOUS
text: She looks up at her uncle with knowing eyes. Eyes that
dialog: tell him she's remembered everything.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: You pushed me...
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: (defensively)
dialog: I was only trying to teach you. But I
dialog: pulled you out, Rennie. I saved your
dialog: life.
text: Rennie just stares, incredulous.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You son of a bitch...
text: She lets it build until she's ready to explode...then:
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: He was down there!!!
text: And Rennie runs off. McCulloch starts to follow but Sean
text: grabs him, shoving him down.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You keep away from her!
text: Sean chases after Rennie. Camera methodically PANS BACK
text: TO MCCULLOCH, crumpled on the ground. A very bitter man.
text: He wipes his hands, getting ready to stand when THE
text: SHADOW FALLS OVER HIM. His skin fades to porcelain white.
speaker_heading: MCCULLOCH
dialog: You...are...NOT POSSIBLE.
text: But possible, and actual, he is. A PAIR OF ROTTED ARMS
text: EXTEND DOWN, RIPPING HIM OUT OF FRAME.
scene_heading: TRACKING WITH JASON
text: as the walking corpse lifts a screaming McCulloch over
text: his head, carrying him over to one of the scum-filled OIL
text: DRUMS, SHOVING HIM HEAD-FIRST INTO IT. Jason grips
text: McCulloch's thrashing legs as bubbles rise to the surface
text: of the slime, a pathetic gurgling reverberating out the
text: drum. At last McCulloch's appendages go limp. Jason
text: releases him, moving on.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY #5 - NIGHT
text: as Sean runs into view, glancing around, spotting Rennie,
text: crouched against a crumbled brick wall. No tears...only
text: hate. Sean sits down next to her. After several
dialog: moments...
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: I was at school when they told me.
dialog: 'Rennie, we have some very bad news...
dialog: your parents have been killed in an
dialog: auto accident.'
text: Sean gently takes her hand, sharing her internal agony.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: It seems like everybody I care about
dialog: ends up...
text: She can't finish. PUSH IN as Sean kisses her on the
text: forehead, then makes her look into his eyes.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Not this time.
text: He caresses her face; it develops into a tender kiss.
text: Finally she holds him back, letting it out. At the same
dialog: time:
text: STALKING POINT OF VIEW
text: Somebody is creeping at a low angle towards them.
speaker_heading: SEAN AND RENNIE
text: are lost in their shared quiet moment...until the
text: GROWLING SOUND becomes audible. They look up, seeing:
speaker_heading: TOBY
text: cautiously approaching them. Rennie stands, absolutely
dialog: relieved.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: Toby...
text: She starts to move towards him and her dog SNARLS
text: VICIOUSLY, CROUCHING BACK IN FEAR.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: What's wrong, boy?
dialog: Another protective growl, then:
speaker_heading: CRASH!
text: as Jason stampedes through a stack of crates and garbage
text: cans behind them.
scene_heading: SEAN, RENNIE AND TOBY
text: abruptly flee down the alley, Jason in mad pursuit.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY/SUBWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT
text: as Rennie, Sean and the dog run straight towards us,
text: Jason swiftly catching up. FAST TRACK WITH THEM over to a
text: deserted, rain-slicked SUBWAY ENTRANCE.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS (EFX)
text: as they bang through the glass doors, sailing past us.
text: Three beats later, JASON APPEARS, not bothering to open
text: the door, STAMPEDING RIGHT THROUGH THE GLASS.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY STATION - ESCALATORS (N.Y.)
text: Sean, Rennie and Toby sail down the escalators past a few
text: scattered COMMUTERS. Again, Jason appears, looming tall
text: at the top. He starts down the "up" escalator.
scene_heading: JASON'S POINT OF VIEW (ICY.)
text: as an ELDERLY COUPLE rises toward us. Their reactions
text: grow more bleak the closer we get, finally registering
text: terror as we plow right through them.
scene_heading: ANGLE - SUBWAY TURNSTILES (ICY.)
text: Sean and Rennie hop over a metal turnstile, Toby crawling
text: under it. A TICKET TAKER leans out his window, shouting
text: at them.
speaker_heading: TICKET TAKER
dialog: Hey!
text: The teenagers are soon forgotten as JASON SMASHES THROUGH
scene_heading: THE TURNSTILE LIKE THE TERMINATOR, TEARING THE ALUMINUM
text: WHEEL RIGHT OFF ITS BASE. The Ticket Taker reacts
text: speechlessly, deciding not to press his luck.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS (N.Y.)
text: as Sean and Rennie slide up to the edge of the track pit,
text: SEEING THE LIGHTS OF AN APPROACHING TRAIN which is taking
dialog: too long to get there.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Come on...
text: ...but Jason arrives before the train. Toby barks and
text: snarls, trying to protect them. Jason is unfazed. He
text: treads toward them and:
speaker_heading: DOG TOBY
text: leaps onto Jason, sinking his teeth into the monster's
text: throat. Jason wrestles the animal into submission just
dialog: as:
scene_heading: THE SUBWAY TRAIN
text: streaks into the station. A fraction of time later:
speaker_heading: JASON
text: heaves the dog in front of the train.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
text: shrieks in horror as Toby disappears inside the pit just
text: as the train roars by.
scene_heading: ANGLE - ONLOOKERS
dialog: They're New Yorkers, but not callous enough to stomach
text: this, quickly scattering. Even a group of severe
text: SKINHEADS decide they can wait for the next train,
text: quickly heading up the escalators after seeing Jason in
dialog: action.
speaker_heading: SEAN
text: makes Rennie look away, dragging her with him along the
text: platform edge in retreat as Jason returns his attention
text: to them. They reach the end of the platform, having no
text: choice but to board the front car.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN (N.Y.)
text: as the doors whoosh shut...but Jason PRIES THEM OPEN. The
text: TRAIN ENGINEER glances back from his booth, seeing Jason
text: making the improper entry.
speaker_heading: TRAIN ENGINEER
dialog: Hey pal, you can't do that...
text: A second later he's gotten a good look at Jason. It's too
text: late for a retraction as JASON SAVAGELY JAMS HIS HEAD
text: INTO THE TRAIN CONSOLE.
scene_heading: INSERT - TRAIN CONSOLE
text: as the Engineer's arm KNOCKS THE THROTTLE FORWARD...
scene_heading: EXT. SUBWAY STATION - CONTINUOUS (N.Y.)
text: ...and the train begins to move, racing into the black
dialog: tunnel.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT (N.Y.)
text: as Rennie and Sean run for their lives, arriving at the
text: end of a car, jamming the separating doors open and
text: entering the next car. Jason follows right behind.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT (N.Y.)
text: as the train thunders through the station without
text: stopping, baffling several waiting COMMUTERS.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - JASON'S POINT OF VIEW (N.Y.)
text: --seeing Sean and Rennie disappear through another
text: connecting door. We storm our way through it into the
text: next car right after them. A handful of TRAVELERS cower
dialog: away from us.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT (N.Y.)
text: as the train rapidly speeds past us, showing no signs of
text: slowing down.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - FINAL CAR (N.Y.)
text: as Sean and Rennie come through another set of separating
text: doors, rushing through... finding they're in the last
text: car. They look back, seeing Jason enter at the opposite
text: end. The monster stalks forward. Sean's eyes dart
text: around. He spots the EMERGENCY STOP CORD. HE LEAPS FOR
dialog: IT.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT (N.Y.)
text: ...and the train SCREECHES TO A HALT.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - CONTINUOUS (N.Y.)
text: The sudden stop throws Jason on his back. Sean throws the
text: rear door open, jumping out with Rennie.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT (N.Y.)
text: as Sean and Rennie sprint down the center of the tracks
text: toward the light of the next station, running out of
dialog: strength.
scene_heading: INT. TIMES SQUARE STATION - NIGHT (N.Y.)
text: as they emerge from the darkness, up to the edge of the
text: pit. Sean boosts Rennie up, starting to climb up himself
dialog: when:
speaker_heading: JASON
text: fires out from the tunnel, grabbing onto Sean's ankle.
text: Rennie screams as Sean is dragged down...but he manages
text: to latch onto a chain securing a garbage receptacle.
text: Jason pulls harder, stretching Sean to his limit as
text: Rennie watches helplessly.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: NO!!!
speaker_heading: RENNIE
text: runs straight towards the track pit like a football
text: punter, RECOILING WITH HER RIGHT LEG, KICKING JASON
text: SQUARELY IN THE FACE.
speaker_heading: JASON (EFX)
text: trips backwards and LANDS ON THE THIRD, ELECTRIFIED RAIL,
text: RECEIVING TEN THOUSAND VOLTS. His body smokes and
text: convulses, finally sizzling out. He appears to be
dialog: terminated!!!
scene_heading: ANGLE - SEAN AND RENNIE

scene_heading: EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (N.Y.) (CRANE SHOT)
text: as our heroes arise into the neon-filled big city
text: wonderland, relieved to be alive, gazing around at the
text: awesome spectacle known as Times Square. A huge DIGITAL
text: CLOCK tells us it's a quarter to midnight. Sean wraps his
text: arm around her.
speaker_heading: SEAN
text: It's over, Rennie. It's finally over.
text: Camera RISES ABOVE THEM, RACKING BACK TO THE SUBWAY EXIT.
dialog: Guess who has just made an encore...with more energy
dialog: than ever!!!
speaker_heading: SEAN AND RENNIE
text: look all around them, having never been to a city as big
text: as this. They finally turn far enough around to spot
text: JASON in a series of three quick cuts, each one closer
dialog: than the last.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: God...please no...
text: But Jason keeps on coming.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: Somebody help us!! He's going to kill
dialog: us!!!
text: But the heavy Times Square foot traffic ignores her,
text: bustling onward. Rennie and Sean have no choice but to
dialog: flee again.
speaker_heading: JASON
text: shoves his way through the preoccupied pedestrians;
dialog: they've certainly seen weirder characters than him here.
text: He moves past a group of STREET URCHINS listening to some
text: rap from their ghetto blaster. His foot obliterates
text: their stereo system with one stride. They instantly pull
text: out switchblades and chains.
speaker_heading: STREET URCHIN
dialog: You're dead meat, slime bag.
text: Jason stops, turning around, towering over the kids. He
text: has blood and gore caked everywhere, his skin charred
text: from the electrocution. Jason starts to remove his mask,
text: facing them squarely.
scene_heading: TIGHT ON STREET URCHINS
text: as Jason's mask comes off out-of-frame. Their tough faces
text: turn to putty, scared completely shitless.
speaker_heading: STREET URCHIN
dialog: Hey man, it's cool, it's cool...
text: They turn tail and race like the wind. Jason steps
text: forward so that we're looking at the back of his head,
text: never seeing his naked face. He slips his hockey mask on
text: again, turns into a CLOSE UP, then exits.
scene_heading: INT. TIMES SQUARE DINER - NIGHT
text: filled with noise, smoke and derelicts. A tough,
text: redheaded WAITRESS with a thick Brooklyn accent stands
text: behind the countertop, a wall of mirrors behind her. The
text: front door bangs open with the entrance of Sean and
text: Rennie, rushing up to the waitress.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (out of breath)
dialog: You have to call the police...
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: Please, hurry...
text: A telephone sits right next to her, but this is New York.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
text: There's a pay phone in back.
text: They start to run.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: ...but it's broken.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: You don't understand -- there's a
dialog: maniac trying to kill us!!!
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: (blase)
dialog: Welcome to New York.
text: There's no time for further response as JASON CRASHES
text: THROUGH THE DINER DOOR, MOWING A PATH STRAIGHT TOWARDS
text: THEM. Sean and Rennie run out the back as the Waitress
text: eyes Jason with complete disbelief.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: as the BURLY CHEF comes out to confront him. Jason FLINGS
text: HIM HEAD FIRST INTO THE JUKEBOX.
speaker_heading: THE WAITRESS
text: picks up the telephone, really pissed off.
speaker_heading: A BIKER
text: climbs off his counter stool, revealing a HUGE BOWIE
text: KNIFE. Jason plows straight for him and the Biker STABS
text: JASON IN THE HEART. Jason has little reaction, pulling it
text: out, tossing it aside. The Biker's face goes wan, backing
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: THE WAITRESS
text: stops in mid-dial. Fear is starting to register now.
speaker_heading: JASON
text: lifts the very large man and EFFORTLESSLY HEAVES HIM INTO
text: THE MIRROR OVER THE COUNTER.
speaker_heading: THE WAITRESS
text: feels the phone receiver slipping from her grasp, her
text: mouth trembling. She backs away from the beast as far as
text: she can. Jason has no time to waste on her, trampling out
text: the back after Rennie and Sean as the other patrons
text: shrink from him.
scene_heading: INT. REAR OF DINER - SAME TIME
text: as Sean fumbles to unlock three deadbolts and two chains,
text: finally getting the back door open and springing into:
scene_heading: EXT. DEAD END ALLEY - NIGHT
text: They run about ten yards before realizing the alley is a
text: dead end. Sean and Rennie start to head back the other
text: way when JASON MOWS OUT FROM THE DINER DOOR. Their vision
text: scatters everywhere in search of a retreat...
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: Look!
text: She's spotted a MANHOLE COVER, slightly ajar. They
dialog: haven't the luxury of thinking about it, Sean sliding the
text: cover back as Jason comes forth.
scene_heading: INT. SEWER - ENTRANCE CHAMBER - NIGHT
text: as they descend into hell...a massive chamber consisting
text: of tall columns, slimy catacombs and three feet of
text: stagnant water. Their alternatives are nil; Sean and
text: Rennie join hands, wading through the swill, splashing
text: deeper into the labyrinth.
speaker_heading: ANGLE UP STAIRS
text: as the dim streetlight glowing in the above world is
text: eclipsed by JASON, making his way down after them.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL #1 - NIGHT
text: An oval tunnel slanted downward into pitch blackness.
text: Dim overhead lights illuminate salt deposits and eery
text: rust formations. Rennie and Sean appear at the far end,
text: wading from the sewage as the tunnel rises toward us.
speaker_heading: TRACKING SHOT
text: as they come forward at a brisk but cautious pace,
text: strangers in a very strange land.
scene_heading: ANGLE - THEIR FEET
text: sloshing through the slime. All is silent until Sean's
text: foot TRIPS OVER A BARREL labeled HUGHES CHEMICAL PLANT.
text: A vaporous green substance oozes out the rusty end of
text: the container, sizzling on the around.
speaker_heading: SEAN AND RENNIE
text: carefully sidestep it, continuing on. They make it
text: another ten yards when A FIGURE LEAPS OUT FROM AN ALCOVE,
text: GRIPPING A HUGE WRENCH. Rennie's scream echoes through
dialog: the tunnel.
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: ...but it's a middle-aged SANITATION ENGINEER who lowers
text: the wrench, as frightened as they are.
speaker_heading: SANITATION ENGINEER
dialog: What the hell are you kids doing down
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Can you help us get out??
speaker_heading: SANITATION ENGINEER
dialog: I sure can and we don't have a minute
dialog: to waste.
text: He begins quickly packing up his tools.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: SANITATION ENGINEER
dialog: Toxic waste, son. This sewer floods
dialog: out with the stuff on the 13th of
dialog: every month, right at midnight.
dialog: (checks watch)
dialog: And that's less than ten minutes from
dialog: now.
text: Rennie looks down the dark tunnels in all directions,
text: swallowing hard.
speaker_heading: SANITATION ENGINEER
dialog: Follow me.
text: He clicks on his high powered flashlight and quickly
dialog: leads them down:
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL #2
dialog: ...no less threatening than the one they just left. When
text: they pass a lightless intersecting corridor, JASON EJECTS
text: HIMSELF FROM IT, TACKLING THE SANITATION ENGINEER AND
speaker_heading: SEAN.
speaker_heading: THE FLASHLIGHT
text: rolls through the muck, its beam splashing erratically
text: across the polluted walls.
scene_heading: THE SANITATION ENGINEER
text: begins BASHING JASON'S HEAD IN WITH HIS WRENCH but the
text: monster drags the kicking and screaming man into TUNNEL
dialog: #3.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
text: tries to help up Sean but he's been knocked into the
text: opposite wall, barely conscious.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Run, Rennie...
text: She's struck with indecisive shock, looking into Tunnel
dialog: #3, seeing:
text: A GRUESOME SHADOW ON THE WALL
text: Jason arches his back with wrench in hand, hammering it
text: over and over into the Sanitation Engineer's skull.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
text: backs away but does not run. The time has come to face
dialog: her fears.
scene_heading: ANGLE - SHADOW ON TUNNEL #3 WALL
text: as Jason takes one more vengeful stroke, finishing him
text: off. He steps from Tunnel #3 with the scarlet-coated
text: tool, his shadow becoming flesh. He moves straight for
text: Sean, who has no hope for escape. Jason cocks the wrench
text: over Sean's skull...and suddenly his hockey mask is
text: SPLASHED WITH A BRIGHT LIGHT. Jason stops, turning
text: directly into it.
scene_heading: JASON'S POINT OF VIEW
dialog: Rennie is blinding us with the sanitation Engineer's
text: flashlight, giving us only brief glimpses of herself in
text: the reflective wet surroundings.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: You never got me in the lake, Jason.
dialog: And you're not going to get me now
dialog: either.
text: Her voice is defiant. She carefully backstops, the
text: irritating light never leaving us.
speaker_heading: JASON
text: has been sufficiently taunted. He moves after her.
scene_heading: JASON'S POINT OF VIEW
text: as the bright beam leaves our eyes, Rennie dashing down
text: the intersecting tunnel (#1).
scene_heading: TIGHT ON JASON'S FEET
text: stomping through the sludge, picking up speed. He's
dialog: wanted to kill Rennie most of all.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL #L
text: as Rennie dashes up to the HUGHES CHEMICAL DRUM Sean
text: tripped over, using the back end of the flashlight to
text: crush in the can's rusted lid. The metal is flimsy but
text: still resists her blows. She frantically hammers harder.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL #2 - TRACKING WITH JASON
text: He's moving like a freight train now, an addict rolling
text: after his fix.
scene_heading: INSERT - CHEMICAL DRUM
text: as the butt of the flashlight dents the metal, ultimately
text: causing it to cave in.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL INTERSECTION - JASON'S POINT OF VIEW
text: --Looking through his unblinking eyes, whipping into
text: Tunnel #1...where we catch a fleeting glimpse of Rennie
text: flinging the contents of the oil drum. A half second
text: later a WAVE OF GRAY/GREEN LIQUID FLIES AT US...
scene_heading: TIGHT ON JASON (SLOW MOTION)
text: and his hockey mask is SPLASHED WITH TOXIC WASTE,
text: SEEPING INTO HIS MASK'S EYE SLITS. He careens back as if
text: her were a rabid dog receiving a load of point-blank
text: buckshot.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
text: drops the can, fumbling for the flashlight again.
speaker_heading: CLOSE UP - JASON (EFX)
text: as the radiant flashlight beam finds his mask, the
text: plastic beginning to bubble and melt. RUSH INTO A TIGHT
text: CLOSE UP AS JASON TEARS OFF HIS MASK, EXPOSING HIS
text: HIDEOUS FACE: rotted flesh, some of it sizzling from the
text: chemical. Worms slithering out his nostrils. And his
text: eyes...or lack thereof. They're like two raw quail eggs
text: frying in liquid green pollutant...and the yolks just
text: broke, running down his face.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON FLASHLIGHT
text: as the beam begins to waver in her quivering grasp. RISE
text: TO FIND RENNIE'S FACE, reacting to the stomach-turning
text: sight of Jason's visage. She grabs hold of her senses and
speaker_heading: RUNS.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: as Rennie skirts past the blinded creature: WHIP PAN WITH
text: HER as she turns down Tunnel #2, heading back toward
text: Sean. CONTINUE TO QUICKLY PAN AROUND until we've come
text: around 360 degrees and are back on JASON, in no way
text: ready to give up. He staggers after Rennie.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL #2
text: as Rennie skids up to Sean, still dazed. She grabs him,
text: shaking hard.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: Get up, Sean!!!
text: His eyes blink, only half coherent. Then an inconceivable
text: terror registers in her ears...A LOW, DEEP RUMBLING
text: SOUND, COMING FROM UP AHEAD. Her head jerks in the
dialog: direction of her planned retreat:
scene_heading: RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW
text: An ominously empty tunnel, soon to be filled with the
text: unthinkable. The sound of RUSHING LIQUID is growing at
text: leaps and bounds.
scene_heading: TIGHT ON RENNIE
text: as her trembling chin rises, looking at:
speaker_heading: ANGLE - TUNNEL #3 CEILING (EFX)
text: The dim overhead lights are beginning to vibrate from
text: the approaching flood.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
text: rotates her head and sees:
speaker_heading: JASON
text: vision or no vision, he is lurching towards her
text: relentlessly. She is literally sandwiched between hell
dialog: and high water.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
text: drags Sean to his feet with the strength of a possessed
text: woman, pulling him over to a SERVICE LADDER attached to
text: the intersecting alcove wall.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Climb!!!
text: She shoves him up it from below, Sean summoning
text: everything he's got to obey her. Rennie shoots a stare
text: back down the tunnel...
speaker_heading: RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (EFX)
text: The overhead lights are banging around like an earthquake
text: has just hit; the liquid will be arriving any second. Her
text: vision WHIP PANS 180 DEGREES TO FIND JASON APPROACHING
text: FROM THE OPPOSITE END, groping around with his scaly arms
text: like the claws of a roto-tiller.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - LADDER
text: as Rennie starts up after Sean, looking down and seeing:
speaker_heading: JASON
text: within ten feet of them, shifting directly for the ladder
text: like he's working on some kind of radar.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
text: slips on the rusty ladder, regaining her footing. and
text: rushing higher. She takes her final glance into the
text: tunnel, the ultimate horror registering in her corneas as
dialog: she sees:
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL #3 (MODEL EFX)
text: A million gallons of green-brown toxic waste splash into
text: the far intersection, FILLING THE TUNNEL, FLOODING
scene_heading: STRAIGHT FOR CAMERA.
speaker_heading: JASON
text: has just started to climb the ladder when the wind and
text: smell of the rushing toxic waste bombards him. His
text: decomposed head swivels to face:
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL #3 (MODEL EFX)
text: Tons of lethal sewage, stopping for no one. Arriving in
dialog: seconds.
scene_heading: JASON'S FINAL CLOSE UP (EFX/FIBER OPTIC LENS)
text: He doesn't need vision to confirm what his other senses
text: already know. Jason's mouth begins to quaver...AND THE
text: FIRST WORDS HE HAS EVER SPOKEN COME OUT, IN THE VOICE OF
scene_heading: AN EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY:
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: Mmmmmmmmmommy...DON'T LET ME DROWN,
text: MOMMY...
text: Camera speeds toward his gaping mouth and DOWN HIS THROAT
text: as lightning arcs off his mucous covered insides. We
text: sink deeper into his guts, fire and smoke flaring into
text: our eves, eventually coming to a WELL IN THE PIT OF HIS
text: STOMACH, FILLED WITH BLOOD...and EIGHT YEAR OLD JASON IS
text: DROWNING IN IT.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JASON
dialog: Hhhhelp me....
dialog: A split second later:
scene_heading: EXT. TUNNEL #3 (EFX) (SLOW MOTION)
text: The wall of deadly toxic liquid ENGULFS JASON.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL #3 - ON RENNIE AND SEAN (EFX)
text: The powerful flood thrashes the ladder about two inches
text: below Rennie's feet, the force of it fiercely shaking
text: their rusty support. They are clinging to the ladder with
text: their eyes squeezed shut. Praying for survival.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL #3 (MODEL EFX)
text: We are drowning in a chunky cloud of sewage, rushing over
dialog: and under us.
scene_heading: EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (EFX)
text: The digital clock we saw earlier abruptly CHIMES
text: MIDNIGHT, HUGE BOLTS OF LIGHTNING CRACKING OVER
speaker_heading: MANHATTAN.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - SEAN AND RENNIE (EFX)
text: as the sewage level begins to drop. Rennie opens her
text: eyes, glancing straight down and seeing.
speaker_heading: RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (EFX)
text: The ladder beneath them reappears...which gives way to a
text: PAIR OF HANDS GRIPPING THE BOTTOM RUNG. The liquid drops
text: further, unshrouding the now-dead corpse of EIGHT YEAR
text: OLD JASON. He's a relatively normal looking boy,
dialog: probably the way he looked back in 1957...right when he
dialog: drowned in Crystal Lake.
text: Jason Voorhees has finally been put to rest.
scene_heading: EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (N.Y.)
text: Rennie and Sean stagger out from a side street, holding
text: each other up...relief etched in their matured faces.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I hear there's a statue here that's 22
dialog: stories tall.
text: Rennie would smile if she could. She kisses his cheek.
text: They amble on.
text: STALKING POINT OF VIEW
text: ...coming out from another alley, creeping up behind them
text: through a crowd of pedestrians. About the height of a
dialog: small child.
speaker_heading: RENNIE AND SEAN
text: walk arm in arm, exhausted and oblivious to their
dialog: pursuer. But something, some innate perception causes
text: Rennie to slow...and stop. Her eyes register a horrid
text: fear and she WHIPS AROUND TO FACE...
speaker_heading: TOBY!
text: Limping on all fours, filthy with grease-matted fur. The
text: whimpering dog crawls up to her, Rennie bending down,
text: hugging her animal like she'll never let go.
speaker_heading: RENNIE
dialog: Oh Toby...
speaker_heading: HIGH ANGLE CRANE SHOT (N.Y.)
text: as Sean bends down too, ruffling the dog's fur, standing
text: again with Rennie. The three survivors enter the collage
text: of pedestrians, bright lights and skyscrapers.
text: It is finally over.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: THE END
dialog:
