scene_heading: DARKNESS.
text: We HEAR the strange, hollow cry of a BELL ringing in
text: reverse. The warbled sound grows louder and louder until
dialog: we...
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL BELL TOWER -- POTSDAM UNIVERSITY - MORNING
text: The morning sunlight gleams off the great IRON CAST BELL
text: as it continues ringing, but at its normal speed.
dialog: From this high up we can see how isolated the school is --
text: surrounded on one side by thick forest.
text: A small campus, mostly brick and ivy. In the Quad, a
text: fraction of the students amble to their classes.
text: We glimpse the highlights: THE FOOTBALL FIELD. SORORITY
scene_heading: ROW. AN ADMINISTRATIVE BUILDING. THE DORMS.
scene_heading: INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING
text: A boxed shrine to hip. From the “BLADE RUNNER” and
text: vintage “STAR WARS” posters to the book shelf lined with
text: plastic-sealed comics.
text: Tangled in black skull and crossbone sheets, we find
text: TERESA “Tree” GELBMAN, 19, beautiful.
text: Outside, the bell tolls one final time before a calm
text: settles over the room. The quiet doesn’t last long as
text: Tree’s CELL PHONE plays “Happy Birthday”.
text: Tree stirs through the fog of her hang-over, searching
text: for her phone. As she sits up, several things hit her at
text: once: she’s not in her room, she's wearing a guy's T-
text: shirt, and the guy it probably belongs to is bent down,
text: putting something away under the couch.
text: CARTER DAVIS, 19, good looks hidden behind grunge and
text: stubble, turns around and smiles at Tree.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You’re up. I wasn’t --
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Where are my clothes?
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: On the night stand.
text: Tree fishes her phone out -- 1 missed call from “DAD”.
text: She snaps it shut with an exasperated sigh.
text: Tree pulls off the T-shirt, exposing a black lace bra.
text: Carter quickly turns his back to her.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT’D)
dialog: I don’t know if you remember my
dialog: name. You were pretty wasted last
dialog: night. I’m Car--
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Tylenol?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: My head’s killing me. Do you have
dialog: any Tylenol?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Uh, sure. Hold on a sec.
text: He starts rummaging through the debris of his room while
text: Tree finishes getting dressed. Carter finds a bottle of
text: aspirin in a TOILETRY BAG that was hidden under a pair of
text: jeans. He offers her a pill. She snatches the bottle and
text: dumps three in her hand and dry-swallows them like a pro.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m Carter.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: (interrupting again)
dialog: Not a word of this to anyone. Got
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Sure...
text: Tree starts to leave. The door is covered in a collage of
text: band stickers and other bits and strips of randomness. In
text: the middle of it all is a BUMPER STICKER that proclaims:
text: “TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY OF THE REST OF YOUR LIFE”
text: Tree opens the door and collides with a lanky FRESHMAN.
text: The words are already leaving his mouth:
speaker_heading: FRESHMAN
dialog: Dude! Did you hit that fine-vagine
dialog: or what?!
text: He meets Tree’s hard stare and instantly shrinks. Tree
text: pushes past him.
text: Carter shoots the freshman a look.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Nice one, dickweed.
text: Carter’s eyes fall on Tree’s GOLD BRACELET, lying on the
text: floor, as it catches the light from the open window. She
text: must have knocked it off the night stand in her haste.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CAMPUS - MORNING
text: Dressed in a slinky outfit and heels, Tree is forced to
text: make the “walk of shame” across the already bustling
text: campus. She shields her eyes from the blinding sunlight.
text: She passes a female STUDENT who thrusts a petition at
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: STUDENT PROTESTER
dialog: Stop global warming!
text: Tree doesn’t deign to acknowledge the proffered
text: clipboard.
text: A nearby CAR ALARM goes off.
text: Next, Tree notices a PAIR OF STUDENTS studying on the
text: lawn as the sprinklers suddenly go off -- they’re getting
text: soaked as they scramble to protect their books.
text: On the left, TREE passes a group of FRAT PLEDGES singing
text: loudly. THE FRAT BROTHER stands beside a sign: “26th
dialog: Straight Hour”.
speaker_heading: FRAT PLEDGES
dialog: -- not a Willie or a Sam! I’m the
dialog: eighth ole’ man named Henry!
dialog: Henry the Eighth, I am!
speaker_heading: FRAT BROTHER
dialog: Second verse, same as the first!
speaker_heading: FRAT PLEDGES
dialog: Oh, Henry the Eighth, I am, I
dialog: am!...
text: The crowd of onlookers cheer as one EXHAUSTED FRAT PLEDGE
text: passes out, hitting his head hard on the pavement.
text: Tree reaches the end of the quad and starts down the
text: steps, as KEITH LUMBLY (18, a big-boned mouthbreather) is
text: just lumbering up the steps.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Morning Tree!
text: She genuinely doesn’t see him... He sighs.
text: The end of the steps lead to SORORITY ROW. Tree’s house,
text: KAPPA DELTA is a converted Mansion at the edge of the
dialog: park.
scene_heading: INT. KAPPA DELTA HOUSE - MORNING
text: Tree creeps into the house -- trying to avoid any of her
text: sisters. She’s got one foot on the stairs when:
speaker_heading: DANIELLE (0.C.)
dialog: Oh-my-god. You sneaky beeyotch!
text: Busted. Tree turns around to face DANIELLE BOUSEMAN, 20,
dialog: peroxide-pretty.
speaker_heading: DANIELLLE
dialog: Who was it?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Nobody.
speaker_heading: DANIELLLE
dialog: Sisters don’t keep secrets.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Seriously. It was nobody.
speaker_heading: DANIELLLE
dialog: Well, I hope nobody used a condom.
dialog: We don’t want somebody getting
dialog: chlamydia.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Thanks for that, Danielle. Really,
dialog: so thoughtful.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: What are sisters for?
text: Tree starts up the stairs.
speaker_heading: DANIELLLE
dialog: (calling after her)
dialog: Don’t forget! House meeting at
dialog: lunch!
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Living for it!
scene_heading: INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Tree has changed into new clothes and is running a brush
text: through her tangled bed-head when her roommate, LORI
text: SPENGLER (18, a cherubic faced redhead) steps from the
text: bathroom, wet, wrapped in a towel.
speaker_heading: LORI
text: She finally rolls in.
text: Shoving a pile of “rejected outfits” off her bed, Tree
text: curls up with her childhood stuffed animal.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Did I totally embarrass myself
dialog: last night?
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Not at all. Unless you consider
text: dancing on a table, starting two
text: fights, and barfing pretzel chunks
text: all over the bar embarrassing.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Please tell me you’re kidding...
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Oh, and you rammed your tongue
text: down Nick Sims’ throat right in
text: front of Danielle.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Get out!
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: For shizzle.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: But she was so nice to me this
dialog: morning?
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: I think she was as drunk as you
dialog: last night. Consider it collective
dialog: amnesia.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Thank god for that.
text: Tree looks at the clock.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Crap! I’m so late for class!
text: Tree starts putting her backpack together. Her side of
text: the room is a giant mess -- clothes, make-up, and trash
text: strewn everywhere.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: I can’t find my damn book!
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Maybe if you cleaned your side of
dialog: the room, you could actually find
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Just cause I’m not an OCD freak --
dialog: (finding her book)
dialog: Ha!
text: The TEXT BOOK is under a pile of mail on her desk. (Note:
text: there’s a BLACK ENVELOPE on top of the pile but Tree pays
dialog: it no attention.)
text: Lori clears her throat behind Tree -- Tree turns around
text: and discovers her roommate holding a CUPCAKE with a
text: single, burning candle.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Did you really think you could
dialog: keep it a secret from me?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: How did you find out?
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Driver’s license. Not the best
dialog: picture of you, I might add.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I assume you changed my ringer
dialog: too?
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: (sly)
dialog: Who me? Never.
text: Tree reluctantly takes the cupcake. Closing her eyes, she
text: makes a wish and blows the candle out.
speaker_heading: LORI (CONT'D)
dialog: What’d you wish for?
speaker_heading: TREE
text: A new roommate.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Wench.
text: And without a second thought, Tree dumps the cupcake into
dialog: the trash.
speaker_heading: LORI (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Sorry. Too many carbs.
text: Lori looks a little hurt. Tree grabs her bag.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Toodles.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Well, you’re welcome...
text: Tree’s already out the door.
text: Lori shakes her head: Tree thoughtlessly left the door
text: open with Lori still standing there in the towel.
speaker_heading: LORI (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello? Towel here -- !
scene_heading: INT. DR. BUTLER’S SCIENCE CLASS - MORNING
text: Tree “sneaks” into the rear of the lecture hall. DR.
text: GREGORY BUTLER (early 30’s, chiseled) jots notes on the
dialog: chalkboard.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: When extreme agitation occurs,
dialog: locomotive response in the
dialog: subjects show an acceleration
dialog: across the quantum plane, where --
text: A quiet entrance is ruined by a very loud, squeaky door
text: as Tree slinks into the room. As she takes a seat in the
text: back she makes eye-contact with her professor.
text: Was that a sneer or a smirk he just flashed her?
scene_heading: EXT. LUNCH PATIO - AFTERNOON
text: A group of Kappa girls have gathered around a table, as
text: Danielle conducts a house meeting with the intensity of a
text: U.N. assembly. To her right, MONICA KEENER, 18, a nervous
text: pledge, diligently takes notes on a legal pad.
text: The other girls, including Tree, absently suck on sugar-
dialog: free, no whip Mochas OR what they call...lunch.
text: Visibly absent is Lori.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: -- and we still need to pick this
dialog: year’s charity. I can say right
dialog: now, there is no way we're doing
dialog: the Special Needs art fair again.
dialog: All those tards want to do is hug.
dialog: Totally freaked my shit out.
dialog: Thoughts?
text: Another pledge, BECKY SHEPARD, 18, a little chunky but
text: doing her best to fit-in, joins the group with her tray.
text: All eyes fall on her food...a sandwich with a side of
text: pasta salad, and a tall glass of chocolate milk.
text: Feeling the weight of their collective stares:
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: What’s wrong?
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: I don’t know. What’s wrong Tree?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Nothing. Except for the buffet you
dialog: just dumped on our table.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: And is that chocolate milk I see?
text: Becky looks horrified.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: (ashamed)
dialog: I missed breakfast.
text: She gets up with her tray and SLAMS into Carter. The
text: chocolate milk slides off the tray and SPLASHES all over
text: Tree. Danielle cracks up.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Ass--
text: She looks up and sees who it is.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: --hole.
text: Carter grabs some napkins from the dispenser on the
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I’m so sorry, Tree.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: You two know each other?
speaker_heading: CARTER TREE
dialog: Yes. No.
text: They look at each other -- Tree’s eyes could burn holes
text: through him. Carter remembers her threat earlier.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (sheepish)
dialog: We...had a class together last
dialog: year.
text: Tree snatches the napkins from him and starts wiping
dialog: herself down.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT’D)
dialog: I just came by to return this.
dialog: 10.
text: He offers Tree her bracelet.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT’D)
dialog: I didn’t know where you lived--
text: Tree snatches it back and looks around to see if anybody
text: saw the exchange. Luckily, they didn’t.
text: He waits for a “thank you”.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Help you?
text: Carter’s hurt turns to indignation. But he doesn’t bark
text: at her. He’s better than that.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Sorry again about the mess.
text: Carter walks off.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: What a douche-bag.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPUS BOOK STORE - AFTERNOON
text: Tree, a BLUE WORK SMOCK over the CHOCOLATE MILK STAIN on
text: her blouse thumbs through a copy of US Weekly. Her boss,
text: LEONARD GILBERT, 40's, wormy, peers over her shoulder.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Teresa, I believe you’re supposed
text: to be unpacking the new shipment,
dialog: not reading about--
dialog: (reading the cover)
dialog: --Brangelina.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I’m still on my ten.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Your ten ended ten minutes ago,
dialog: missy.
text: Tree drops the magazine. As she heads toward the back,
text: she passes a display of school-spirit paraphernalia
text: including a stack of eerie MASKS (the school mascot).
dialog: 11.
scene_heading: INT. STOCK ROOM - AFTERNOON
text: Fluorescent lights HUM in the sterile room as we find
text: Tree hunched over a pile of text books, stamping the
text: covers with STICKERS that say “REDUCED”.
text: Immersed in the mind-blowing monotony of her job, Tree
text: doesn’t see the HULKING FIGURE standing behind her.
text: We SEE a BOX CUTTER in his dirty hand as the blade slowly
dialog: slides out...
text: The figure leans in and SLASHES!--
text: --the plastic band wrapped around a pile of books next to
dialog: Tree. She jumps!
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: Keith (the mouthbreather from before) standing behind
dialog: Tree.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Don’t sneak up on me, Keith. It’s
dialog: creepy.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Leonard wants to know if the books
dialog: are ready.
text: Tree picks up a stack and shoves them into Keith’s arms.
text: But he doesn’t move. He just stands there like a lug,
text: holding the stack.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Anything else, Keith?
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Um...I was wondering what you were
dialog: doing this Friday night?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Are you asking me on a date,
dialog: Keith?
text: His cheeks turn red.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Well...sorta...
dialog: 12.
text: Tree raises the gun and STAMPS Keith’s forehead with a
text: “REDUCED” sticker.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Sorry, I’m busy.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPUS HOSPITAL - AFTERNOON
text: Tree enters the lobby. Her cell phone plays “Happy
text: Birthday”. Tree checks the LCD: INCOMING CALL FROM DAD.
text: She instantly hits the IGNORE button as she stops in
text: front of the elevators. The doors open -- LORI steps out,
text: wearing her NURSING SCRUBS.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Lori...
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Hi.
text: She steps out. The doors close as Tree struggles with the
text: stilted air between them.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: So, I thought you only work
dialog: nights.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: I’m doing a double for Jen. She
dialog: has the flu.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: We missed you at the meeting
dialog: today.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: I didn’t think I needed to be
dialog: there to decide what color
dialog: Danielle’s hair should be this
dialog: season.
text: Tree laughs.
speaker_heading: LORI (CONT'D)
dialog: I guess I don’t have to ask what
dialog: you're doing here.
text: The levity between them dissolves instantly.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Gotta go.
text: Nudging past Lori, Tree presses elevator button.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Look, Tree...it’s none of my
dialog: business but I think eventually
dialog: something like that is bound to
dialog: have some pretty serious
dialog: consequences.
text: The doors open. Tree steps inside.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: You're right. It’s none of your
dialog: business.
text: The metal doors shut -- Lori’s disconcerted expression
text: reflected in the polished surface.
scene_heading: INT. 4TH FLOOR -- HOSPITAL - AFTERNOON
text: Tree exits the elevator and discreetly slips past the
text: nurse’s station and disappears behind a door marked “DR.
scene_heading: GREGORY BUTLER”
text: As the door closes, we SEE a POLICE OFFICER stationed
text: outside a door at the far end of the hall.
scene_heading: INT. GREGORY'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON
text: Tree pushes open the door of this small cramped office
text: and realizes she’s alone for a moment.
text: She notices a wedding picture of a happy bride and groom.
text: She smirks, places it face side down on the desk.
text: Gregory (Professor Butler) enters his office, closing the
text: door behind him.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: We can’t do this. There’s too
text: much going on in the building
dialog: today.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Okay. I'’11 go.
text: She takes his CAR KEYS out of his hand and dumps them in
text: his desk drawer.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: I have patients...
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Yeah, and I’m losing mine.
text: ZIP! She has her hands down his pants, kissing him hard.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: (between kisses)
dialog: This doesn’t mean you’re passing
dialog: my course.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Do I look like I care?
text: They start kissing passionately -- Tree accidentally
text: kicks the desk chair across the room. It wedges itself
text: between the door and a file cabinet.
text: Which is perfect, as, suddenly... SOMEONE OUTSIDE opens
text: the door and tries to enter, but it is jammed.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Gregory? Are you there?
text: In what seems like an instant later...
text: ... Gregory and a completely dressed Tree open the door
text: for STEPHANIE BUTLER (pretty, fragile) Gregory’s wife.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: Hey, Sweetie --
text: He gives Stephanie a kiss.
speaker_heading: GREGORY (CONT’D)
dialog: -- just wrapping up here.
text: Tree squeezes past Stephanie and forces a smile -- which
text: isn’t returned.
text: As Gregory closes the door, Stephanie glances back at
text: Tree, who wonders if Stephanie suspects anything.
scene_heading: INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - EVENING
text: Tree sits on her bed, painting her toenails while a “Road
text: Rules” marathon runs for the umpteenth time on MTV.
text: There’s a light knock at the door.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Enter...
text: Danielle walks in, all dolled-up. Tree sizes
dialog: furrowed.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Is that my top?
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: How cute is it on me?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Just don’t get anything on it,
dialog: please.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: You mean like Nick’s jizz?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Wow. Classy.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: (ignoring her)
dialog: What time are you going to the
dialog: party tonight?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I don’t know...later.
text: Tree goes back to painting her nails.
text: Just then, there is a BLACK OUT. It is 9:23.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: Our tuition dollars at work.
text: A moment later, the lights go back on.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE (CONT’D)
dialog: Anyhoo...don’t be too late or all
dialog: the cute Sigma boys will be taken.
text: Danielle leaves.
text: Looking down, Tree notices she messed up one
text: in the blackout. Tree growls. As she reaches
text: the bottle of POLISH REMOVER, she spills the
text: of RED NAIL POLISH on her bedspread.
dialog: 15.
dialog: her up, brow
dialog: of her toes
dialog: over to grab
dialog: open bottle
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Damn it!
text: Tree jumps up and grabs a crumpled towel hanging over her
text: desk chair. But something makes her freeze...
text: A PHOTOGRAPH...
text: Peeking out beneath her unopened mail (and the BLACK
speaker_heading: CARD).
text: She picks up the photo. We SEE Tree, dressed in her high
text: school cap and gown, framed between her proud FATHER and
text: MOTHER (Tree looks just like her).
text: The image cuts right to Tree’s heart -- so Tree does the
text: only thing she knows, she hides the photo in the top
text: drawer of the dresser. Out of sight, out of mind.
scene_heading: EXT. THE THOROUGHFARE - NIGHT
text: Tree, in a resplendent white cotton dress, leaves her
text: house and looks around. The area is completely empty of
text: people. Most everyone at their respective pledge houses.
text: Tree checks her VOICE MAIL as she walks at a brisk clip.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: Hey, it's me. I'll text you later
dialog: about meeting tonight. Not sure if
dialog: I can get away but I'll do my
dialog: best. By the way, that was close
dialog: this afternoon. But kinda hot.
text: Tree laughs.
scene_heading: SAVE -- NEXT MESSAGE...
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: (pissed)
dialog: Tree, it's dad. I sat in that
dialog: restaurant waiting for you for
dialog: almost an hour --
text: DELETE. Tree snaps her phone shut.
text: At the path she comes upon a blocked off area.
text: She glances at her watch. 10:43.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Shit.
text: The lights are off along the cordoned and torn up path.
text: But it is the shortest way to the Quad.
text: Tree steps around the wooden barriers...
scene_heading: EXT. THE PATH - NIGHT
text: Tree walks along the path, suddenly aware of... what?
dialog: Something? Someone?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Hello?
text: She comes across a large ditch exposing a water pipe.
text: She realizes she has to edge around, towards the trees.
text: Taking a deep breath, convinced she is alone, she edges
text: her way along the ditch. Her back to the trees.
text: Which is when a hand reaches out from the shadows and
text: grabs her around the mouth!
text: Her muffled screams are cut short when she’s suddenly
text: aware of the KNIFE that erupts from her chest! Before
dialog: she can make sense of it...
text: She’s tossed in the ditch...
text: ..-where her rapidly draining blood mixes with the water
text: and mud. She stares wide-eyed at an uncaring universe.
text: Then she is dead.
speaker_heading: SLAM CUT:
scene_heading: INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING
text: Tree bolts awake -- realizing it was just a nightmare,
text: she inhales deeply with relief. In the background we HEAR
text: the bell toll the hour. Suddenly her cell phone
text: rings...”Happy Birthday” plays.
text: Sitting up, Tree finds Carter bent over, putting
text: something away beneath the sofa. He turns around, smiles.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You’re up. I wasn’t --
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: My clothes?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Uh...on the night stand.
text: Tree fishes her phone out of her jeans -- 1 missed call
text: from “DAD”. She snaps the phone shut.
text: Tree starts changing into her clothes. Carter turns
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT’D)
dialog: I don’t know if you remember my
dialog: name. You were pretty wasted last
dialog: night. I’m Car--
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Carter.
text: He smiles, pleasantly surprised.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Tylenol?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: My head’s killing me. Do you have
dialog: any Tylenol?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Uh, sure. Hold on a sec.
text: Carter begins searching. Tree grows inpatient and grabs
text: his TOILETRY BAG under some clothes. She finds the bottle
text: and dumps the pills in her hand.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT’D)
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Wow. Have you been here before?
text: The question makes Tree pause. How did she know where the
dialog: aspirin was?
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT’D)
dialog: You okay?
dialog: 19.
text: Tree is still thinking.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Tree?
text: She turns and looks at his door -- there’s the sticker:
text: “TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY OF THE REST OF YOUR LIFE”
text: Suddenly, the door opens. Enter lanky freshman...
speaker_heading: FRESHMAN
dialog: Dude! Did you hit that fine-vagine
dialog: or what?!
text: He immediately shrinks at the sight of her. A little
text: freaked, Tree pushes past him and hurries out.
text: Carter shoots the freshman a look.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Nice one, dickweed.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CAMPUS - MORNING
text: Shielding her eyes from the glaring sun, Tree makes the
text: “walk of shame” again. But it’s all so familiar.
text: She passes the student protester.
speaker_heading: STUDENT PROTESTER
dialog: Stop global warming!
text: The CAR ALARM goes off...
text: Then the sprinklers, soaking the studying pair.
dialog: The frat pledges...
speaker_heading: FRAT PLEDGES
dialog: -- not a Willie or a Sam! I’m the
dialog: eighth ole’ man named Henry!
dialog: Henry the Eighth, I am!
speaker_heading: FRAT BROTHER
dialog: Second verse, same as the first!
speaker_heading: FRAT PLEDGES
dialog: Oh, Henry the Eighth, I am, I
dialog: am!...
text: Keith, waiting for Tree at the steps...
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Morning Tree.
text: This time, she notices him.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Keith, what day is it?
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Tuesday, the eighteenth.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Says so right here on my watch.
text: He offers his wrist but Tree turns and looks back. The
text: whole world looks a little off kilter to her.
scene_heading: INT. KAPPA DELTA HOUSE - MORNING
text: Tree doesn’t sneak in this time. But as she starts up the
dialog: stairs...
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: Oh-my-god. You sneaky beeyotch!
text: Tree turns around, clearly on edge.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE (CONT’D)
dialog: Who was it?
dialog: (off Tree’s blank
dialog: stare/offended)
dialog: Sisters don’t keep secrets.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: No, I’m totally having deja vu
dialog: right now.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: I have it all the time. It’s
dialog: supposed to mean somebody’s like
dialog: walking over your grave or
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Seriously. I’ve had it all
dialog: morning. It’s crazy.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: Maybe you should switch to water
dialog: next time, hon. You’re so Tara
dialog: Reid when you drink.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Thanks. I’1l keep that in mind.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: What are sisters for?
text: Tree starts up the stairs.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE (CONT’D)
dialog: (calling after her)
dialog: Don’t forget! House meeting at
dialog: lunch!
text: Tree stops again, turns around. Danielle misinterprets
text: the confused look in her eyes.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE (CONT’D)
dialog: It’s been on the schedule board
dialog: since last Thursday, Tree.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Yeah...I remember.
dialog: The problem is she remembers everything.
scene_heading: INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Tree is changing when Lori steps from the bathroom,
text: wrapped in a towel.
speaker_heading: LORI
text: She finally rolls-in.
text: Tree just stares at her.
speaker_heading: LORI (CONT'D)
dialog: You were sort of a mess last
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: TREE
text: Dancing on a table, barfing
dialog: pretzel chunks?
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: You remember. I’m shocked.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: (re: the deja vu)
dialog: So weird.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Oh, and you rammed your tongue
text: down Nick Sims’ throat right in
text: front of Danielle.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I‘'m...late for class.
text: Grabbing her backpack, Tree immediately finds her book on
text: the desk. When she looks up, Lori has the cupcake.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Did you really think you could
dialog: keep it a secret from me?
text: She hands the cupcake to Tree who is still totally
text: tripping.
speaker_heading: LORI (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t you wanna know how I found
dialog: out?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: You looked at my driver's license.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Well, aren’t you the clever one.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I gotta go.
text: Tree sets the cupcake down.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: But you didn’t even blow the
dialog: candle out.
text: She’s gone, pulling the door shut behind her. The wind
text: BLOWS the candle out anyway.
text: Confused by Tree’s odd demeanor, Lori looks down at the
dialog: cupcake.
text: CLOSE ON...
text: The candle...a sinewy rope of smoke rising from the
text: extinguished wick.
dialog: 23.
scene_heading: EXT. THE PATIO - AFTERNOON
text: The Delta’s are around the table as before. Tree is
text: spacing out as Danielle holds court.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: -- and we still need to pick this
dialog: year’s charity. I can say right
dialog: now, there is no way we're doing
dialog: the Special Needs art fair again.
dialog: All those tards want to do is hug.
dialog: Totally freaked my shit out.
dialog: Thoughts?
text: Becky arrives with her lunch tray.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: What’s wrong?
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: I don’t know. What’s wrong Tree?
text: Tree suddenly looks up -- she only caught the tail-end of
dialog: the conversation.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I’m just a little tired, I guess.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: No, dumb-ass. What’s wrong with
dialog: that?
text: She points at Becky’s food. Tree shakes her head.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE (CONT’D)
dialog: So not Kappa-cuisine. And is that
dialog: chocolate milk I see?
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: (ashamed)
dialog: I missed breakfast.
text: Humiliated, Becky stands with her tray, she starts to
dialog: turn...
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Becky, look out!
text: SLAM! Becky collides with Carter. The chocolate milk
text: splashes all over Tree. Danielle cracks up. Carter grabs
text: some napkins from the dispenser on the table.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I’m so sorry, Tree.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: You two know each other?
speaker_heading: TREE CARTER
dialog: No. Yes.
text: Tree slowly turns and looks at Carter -- he sees the fear
text: in her eyes. Translates it quickly:
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: We...had a class together last
dialog: year.
dialog: (to Tree)
dialog: Sorry again.
text: He starts to walk off.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Hey!
text: He stops turns around. Tree walks up to him -- clears her
text: throat awkwardly. Carter stares at her like she’s crazy
text: until he looks down and sees her open hand.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: My bracelet?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Oh. Yeah. Here--
text: Reaching into his pocket, he drops it into the palm of
text: her hand. For a split-second Tree pauses -- how did she
text: know he had it on him? Tree finally turns around and
text: walks away.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE (0.C.)
dialog: What a douche-bag.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPUS BOOKSTORE - CONTINUOUS
text: Tree, her blue smock covers her chocolate milk stain,
text: thumbs through her US Weekly... her brow is furrowed,
text: this is all so fucking familiar to her. It is irritating.
text: She suddenly recalls Leonard approaching. Tree quickly
text: hides the magazine and pretends to be pricing down some
text: dictionaries with a red pen. He eyes her suspiciously.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: (duh? )
dialog: Working.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: I believe you’re supposed to be
dialog: unpacking the new shipment, not
dialog: pricing dictionaries.
text: Tree drops the marker and gets up. As she heads toward
text: the back, she passes the display of school spirit
text: paraphernalia.
dialog: She freezes --
text: --and picks something up we don’t see.
text: Trees looks like she’s just seen a ghost. Her own.
text: Off screen, there’s a loud BANG! Tree looks to her right
text: where Keith has just dropped something. He looks at Tree.
text: There’s something peculiar in his eyes.
text: Tree hurries past the stock room door. Keith moves to the
text: display and studies what Tree just set down...
text: A MASK.
text: Keith’s big, meaty hand curls around the mask as he
text: slowly brings it to his face -- his breathing even louder
text: behind the eerie plastic grin.
text: There’s a FULL-LENGTH MIRROR to his right -- Keith twists
text: his head to the right and meets his masked reflection.
text: Off his silent stare...
scene_heading: INT. CAMPUS HOSPITAL - AFTERNOON
text: Tree enters the lobby. Her cell phone plays “Happy
text: Birthday”. Tree checks the LCD: INCOMING CALL FROM DAD.
text: She instantly hits the IGNORE button as she stops in
text: front of the elevators. The doors open as LORI steps out,
text: wearing her NURSING SCRUBS.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Lori...
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Hi.
text: She steps out. This time Tree steps into the elevator.
text: The doors start to close but Lori’s hand catches the
text: bumper. The doors open.
speaker_heading: LORI (CONT'D)
dialog: Everything okay?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Yeah. Fine.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: You were acting really weird this
dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I’m having a weird day.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Look, it’s none of my business but
dialog: I think eventually something like
dialog: that is bound to have some pretty
dialog: serious consequences.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Lori, I really can’t talk right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Fine...it’s your life.
text: Lori pulls her hand back, letting the doors close.
scene_heading: INT. GREGORY'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON
text: Alone, Tree turns over the wedding photo without looking
text: at it. She pushes the photo under some papers.
text: Gregory enters, and quickly closes the door.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: We can’t do this. There’s too
text: much going on in the building
dialog: today.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I need to talk to you.
text: She reaches around him... to LOCK THE DOOR.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: Tree, I know what you’re going to
dialog: say.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: You do?
text: Gregory puts his CAR KEYS in his desk.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: It’s normal for a young girl to
dialog: have feelings for an older man.
dialog: But you can’t let it cross that
dialog: line. You can’t fall in love.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I’m not falling in love with you.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: You’re not?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: No. I’ve been having--
text: Overcome with lust at her proximity, Gregory lifts her to
text: his desk and starts to kiss her -- Tree resists but he’s
text: not stopping. Tree is overcome by a sudden sense of
text: dread. She pushes him back.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: (breathless)
dialog: Your...wife?
text: He stops.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: Okay. That’s kind of a buzz kill.
text: A jangling of the doorknob. And then a loud knocking!
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE (0.S.)
dialog: Gregory? Are you in there?
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: (hushed)
dialog: Thank god you locked the door!
text: Tree and Gregory hurriedly adjust their clothing and open
text: the door -- Gregory giving a lame:
speaker_heading: GREGORY (CONT’D)
dialog: Didn‘t realize I locked the door.
dialog: Have you met my student Teresa?
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: No, I don’t think I have.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Hi.
text: Tree edges past. Stephanie gives Gregory a look regarding
dialog: Tree: What was that about...? Gregory gives the loopdy-
dialog: loop international sign for Parts On Order.
scene_heading: INT. 4TH FLOOR -- HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS
text: Heading toward the elevator, Tree passes the nurse’s
text: station and overhears a couple NURSES whispering.
speaker_heading: NURSE#1
dialog: Well, I’m not comfortable with it.
speaker_heading: NURSE#2
dialog: Me neither.
text: They both look up at Tree at the same time. Tree’s
dialog: immediate thought...Do they know about her and Gregory?
text: Diverting her eyes, Tree reaches the elevators. While she
text: waits, she notices the POLICE OFFICER sitting at the end
text: of the hall. Was he in her “dream”? (YES)
scene_heading: INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: “Road Rules” is on the TV. Tree is at her dresser,
text: looking at the same picture from her high school
text: graduation. There’s a knock at the door...
text: Tree stuffs the photo into the top drawer as Danielle
text: enters.
text: She’s all dolled-up. Tree recognizes her top instantly.
dialog: Reading Tree’s expression:
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: I know. I’m just borrowing it for
dialog: tonight. How cute is it on me?
text: Overwhelmed by her deja vu, Tree looks at the TV -- she
text: recognizes the challenge on “Road Rules”.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE (0.C.) (CONT’D)
dialog: What time are you going to the
dialog: party tonight?
dialog: (Tree doesn’t hear
dialog: her)
dialog: Hello?...earth to space-bitch...
text: Tree snaps out of it.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: (pretending to use
dialog: sign-language)
dialog: What-time-are-you-going-to-the-
dialog: party?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I don’t know...later.
speaker_heading: BLACKOUT.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my god!
text: The lights come back on.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: Our tuition dollars at work.
text: She sees the fear in Tree's eyes.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE (CONT’D)
dialog: Chill out. It’s just another
text: rolling blackout, sweetie.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: (hopeful)
dialog: It happened before?
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: Yeah, like two weeks ago. I
dialog: remember because I was running on
text: the treadmill and almost ate shit.
dialog: I don’t know what’s so hard about
dialog: keeping the electricity on.
dialog: Anyhoo...don’t be too late or all
dialog: the cute Sigma boys will be taken.
text: She leaves. We HOLD ON Tree -- her face wrought with a
text: mounting sense of dread.
scene_heading: EXT. THE THOROUGHFARE - NIGHT
text: Tree, in a resplendent white cotton dress, leaves her
text: house and looks around. The area is completely empty of
text: people. Most everyone at their respective pledge houses.
text: Tree checks her VOICE MAIL as she walks at a brisk clip.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: Hey, it's me. I'll text you later
dialog: about meeting tonight. Not sure if
dialog: I can get away but I'll do my
dialog: best. By the way, that was close
dialog: this afternoon. But kinda hot.
scene_heading: SAVE -- NEXT MESSAGE...
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: (pissed)
dialog: Tree, it's dad. I sat in that
dialog: restaurant waiting for you for
dialog: almost an hour --
text: DELETE. Tree snaps her phone shut.
text: At the path she comes upon a blocked off area. A palpable
text: dread washes over her.
text: She glances at her watch. 10:43.
text: The lights are off along the cordoned and torn up path.
text: But it is the shortest way to the Quad.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: (chiding herself)
dialog: You’re being an idiot. It was just
text: a dream.
dialog: 31.
text: Tree steps around the wooden barriers...
scene_heading: EXT. THE PATH - NIGHT
text: She walks the path...skittish, but nope. Nothing.
text: She comes across a ditch exposing a water pipe. She
text: needs to edge around it, towards the trees.
text: Off screen a branch SNAPS! Tree freezes...
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Hello? Somebody there?
text: She looks around. All seems quiet and still until she
text: catches something or someone move in her periphery....
text: Tree spins around. Just more space and the woods
text: beyond...but Tree’s eyes zero-in on something peeking out
text: from behind one of the trees...
text: A FAINT GLIMMER OF LIGHT.
text: LIKE THE TIP OF A KNIFE.
text: Is somebody hiding behind the tree? Waiting?
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Screw this.
text: Tree turns and runs back the way she came and practically
text: leaps over the wooden barrier.
scene_heading: EXT. FRAT HOUSE - EVENING
text: Hurrying up the path, Tree reaches the front door and
text: rings the bell. It’s oddly quiet for a usually racous
dialog: place.
text: Tree looks back over her shoulder to make sure she’s not
text: being followed. When she turns back the door is already
dialog: open.
speaker_heading: Tree’s POV --
text: -- THE MASK instantly appears out of the darkness!
text: Tree SCREAMS and throws a right hook! BAM!
text: The lights suddenly turn on revealing a CROWD gathered in
text: the doorway.
dialog: 32.
text: There’s a big “HAPPY BIRTHDAY” banner hanging on the
text: wall. Everyone is staring at Tree in shock.
text: Somewhere in the back of the crowd, someone says:
speaker_heading: PERSON (0.C.)
dialog: Happy Birthday?
dialog: The guy who just got slugged, NICK SIMS (21, major
text: hottie) pulls his mask off, rubbing his red and swelling
dialog: cheek.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What the hell, Tree?!
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Oh my god! I thought you -- I
dialog: thought I was -- I’m so sorry.
text: Danielle steps forward, addressing the crowd:
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: Don’t mess with a Kappa bitch!
text: The crowd cheers, bringing the levity back to the affair.
text: Somebody CRANKS the music as Danielle pulls Tree into a
dialog: hug.
scene_heading: INT. FRAT HOUSE - EVENING
text: The party is in full swing. Empty plastic cups shake on
text: the speakers pumping out some old school party anthem.
text: Pushing through the throngs of REVELERS we find Tree in
text: the corner with Danielle and some other randoms.
text: Tree checks her cell phone -- no new messages. The
text: disappointment registers on her face.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: That slut.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: Lori. She said she’d be here.
text: She’s so out of the house next
dialog: year.
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I think she had a double shift.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: Whatevs. She’s been boning some
dialog: mystery guy.
text: Nick saddles up to Tree and offers her a beer.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Truce?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: You know I didn’t mean it.
text: Danielle tries to wedge herself between these two --
text: there’s lots of hair-flipping and eye-lash batting but
text: it’s pretty obvious that Nick is more interested in Tree.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Why were you wearing that stupid
dialog: mask in the first place?
speaker_heading: NICK
text: Big game’s on Friday. Just showing
dialog: a little school spirit. Didn’t
dialog: think I'd get clocked for it.
text: Danielle laughs REALLY LOUD. It’s desperate and draws an
text: annoyed look from Nick.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I really am sorry. Did you ice it?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: It’s fine.
dialog: (devilish grin)
dialog: You can make it up to me later.
text: He gives her a knowing wink before heading off into the
text: crowd. Danielle looks like she’s going to kill Tree.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: Don’t “what” me. You know exactly
dialog: what you’re doing, Tree.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Danielle--
dialog: 34.
text: Danielle storms off in a huff. Tree’s CELL PHONE chimes.
text: She looks at the screen. 1 NEW TEXT.
dialog: It’s from Gregory:
dialog: “Sorry...can’t get away tonight. C U tomorrow?”
text: Hurt, Tree snaps the phone shut. Surrounded by people she
text: hardly knows or hardly wants to know, Tree looks sad and
dialog: alone.
text: Tree starts pushing her way toward the front door when
dialog: she sees something--
text: --Nick. Heading upstairs. He looks right at Tree and
text: flashes a smile that says “follow me”.
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HALL -- FRAT HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Tree reaches the top of the stairs, but Nick is already
dialog: gone.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Nick?
text: She starts down the hall. Tries the first door on her
dialog: right.
text: Tree’s POV -- THE BATHROOM. Two Kappa PARTY GIRLS (X-ing;
text: eyes-wide, pupils totally dilated) are standing shoulder
text: to shoulder at the sink. One of them is staring at
text: herself in the mirror while the other pets a wash-cloth
text: like it was her cat.
speaker_heading: PARTY GIRL #1
dialog: (staring)
dialog: I'm so pretty...
speaker_heading: PARTY GIRL #2
dialog: (petting)
dialog: It's so soft...
text: They don’t even see Tree as she closes the door.
text: A little further down the hall, Tree tries another
dialog: door...
text: Tree’s POV -- HALL CLOSET. A drunk COUPLE is getting it
dialog: on.
text: She quickly shuts the door.
dialog: 35.
text: The next door to her left is slightly ajar...
scene_heading: INT. NICK’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Nick is sitting on the bed wearing the MASK.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: You want me to hit you again?
text: He stands and approaches her. Face to face, Tree laughs:
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, I’m not into kinky. Lose the
dialog: mask.
text: She tries taking the mask off but he stops her with a
scene_heading: GLOVED HAND.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s going on?
text: She sees something over his shoulder...her eyes go WIDE
dialog: with terror!
scene_heading: ANGLE ON -- THE CLOSET
text: Nick’s semi-naked BODY lies on the closet floor. Blood
text: pooling around him.
text: Tree starts to scream as her KILLER grabs her throat! He
text: pulls out a knife! Before he can stab her, she’s already
text: swinging a FRATERNITY PADDLE she grabbed off the night
dialog: stand!
speaker_heading: WHACK!
text: The hard wood, cracks his arm, knocking the knife out of
text: the killer’s grip -- it drops behind the headboard!
text: Tree tries to go for the door but he blocks her!
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: SOMEBODY HELP ME!
text: The music and crowd-walla easily drown-out her cries for
dialog: help.
text: The killer grabs a HOCKEY STICK mounted on the wall as
text: Tree backpedals toward the window. She pulls it half-way
dialog: open when the killer takes a swing! Tree ducks!
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON
text: The bottom of the window frame as the hockey stick shears
text: off the bottom of the wooden frame, exposing the jagged
speaker_heading: GLASS.
text: Trying to squirm away, Tree loses her footing and falls
text: back onto the window sill. The killer’s gloved hand pins
dialog: her down!
text: Looking up, Tree sees the sharp, exposed GLASS directly
text: above her throat.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: NO!!!
text: The attacker grips the top of the frame and SLAMS the
dialog: window shut!
speaker_heading: SLAM CUT:
scene_heading: INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING
text: Tree wakes with a SCREAM. Clawing herself up into a
text: seated position. Outside, the bell chimes the hour as
text: Tree’s eyes dart around the room -- noting all the
text: familiar bits and pieces.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: This can’t be happening...this
dialog: can’t be real!
text: Carter is staring back at Tree, mouth agape.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Everything. ..okay?
text: Cue “Happy Birthday” from Trees cell phone. She grabs the
text: phone from her clothes on the night stand.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON -- THE LCD SCREEN
text: INCOMING CALL FROM “DAD”
text: On the brink of hysteria, Tree grabs her clothes and
text: starts changing.
text: Carter turns his back to her.
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT’D)
dialog: I don’t know if you remember my
dialog: name. You were --
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: --pretty wasted last night.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: And you’re name’s Carter?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (perking-up)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: But we’ve never met before?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Not until last night. I mean, I’ve
dialog: seen you around campus but we
dialog: don’t exactly move in the same
dialog: circles.
text: Tree’s eyes fill with tears.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: This is a nightmare....
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (hurt/defensive)
dialog: I’m sorry...but you’re the one who
dialog: wanted to come here last night!
text: Tree shoves him out of the way and runs for the door. She
text: sees the sticker again.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Oh-my-god.
text: Tree throws her weight into the door, as it swings open --
speaker_heading: FRESHMAN (0.C.)
dialog: Dude! Did you--
text: The door SMASHES the lanky kid in the face!
speaker_heading: FRESHMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ow! Sonofa--
dialog: 38.
text: He sees Tree. Sees the tears running down her cheeks.
speaker_heading: FRESHMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh. Hey.
text: Tree pushes him out of the way and runs down the hall.
text: The Freshman shoots Carter a look.
speaker_heading: FRESHMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Nice one, dickweed.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CAMPUS - MORNING
text: A distraught Tree hurries through the bustling campus.
text: She tries to side-steps the female PROTESTER who thrusts
text: a petition at her.
speaker_heading: STUDENT PROTESTER
dialog: Stop global warming!
text: Tree slaps the clipboard away.
speaker_heading: STUDENT PROTESTER (CONT’D)
dialog: (shouting after her)
dialog: A simple “no-thanks” would do!
dialog: Car alarm...
dialog: Sprinklers...
text: TREE passes a group of FRAT PLEDGES singing loudly. THE
text: FRAT BROTHER stands beside a sign: “26th Straight Hour”.
speaker_heading: FRAT PLEDGES
dialog: -- not a Willie or a Sam! I’m the
dialog: eighth ole’ man named Henry!
dialog: Henry the Eighth, I am!
speaker_heading: FRAT BROTHER
dialog: Second verse, same as the first!
speaker_heading: FRAT PLEDGES
dialog: Oh, Henry the Eighth, I am, I
dialog: am!...
text: The crowd of onlookers cheer as one EXHAUSTED FRAT PLEDGE
text: passes out, hitting his head hard on the pavement.
dialog: 39.
text: Horrified by the re-play, Tree begins to run blindly!
text: Reaching the end of the quad, Tree bounds down the steps
dialog: and CRASHES into...
dialog: Keith.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Morning Tree.
text: Tree backs away from him. Eyes wide with fear.
speaker_heading: KEITH (CONT'D)
dialog: Tree--
text: She keeps running.
scene_heading: INT. KAPPA DELTA HOUSE - MORNING
text: Tree slams the door shut. She starts for the stairs but
text: is forced to grab the rail. She’s having a hard time
dialog: breathing.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE (0.C.)
dialog: Oh-my-god. You sneaky beeyotch!
text: Tree turns around. Danielle sees tear-streaked cheeks,
text: the wild look in her eyes.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE (CONT’D)
dialog: What’s wrong?
text: She can’t answer. Doesn’t know how to explain. Instead,
text: she just runs up the stairs.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Tree?!
text: She vanishes around the corner.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE (CONT’D)
dialog: (baffled)
dialog: Freakshow.
scene_heading: INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Tree throws herself on her bed and sobs into her pillow.
text: Lori steps out of the bathroom, wet and wrapped in a
dialog: towel.
speaker_heading: LORI
text: She finally rolls-in.
dialog: 40.
text: Lori realizes Tree’s upset.
speaker_heading: LORI (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, what’s wrong?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I feel like I’m losing my mind,
dialog: Lori. I don’t know what’s
text: happening to me. I’m so confused.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Just calm down and start from the
dialog: beginning.
text: Tree takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Have you ever had deja vu?
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Sure. Everybody has.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Well, I’m having it but like...big
dialog: time. This isn’t going to make any
dialog: sense but, I’ve already lived
dialog: through this day. Twice.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Tree--
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I know! It’s not possible but it’s
dialog: happening! I swear to god!
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Look, Tree, I know this is a hard
dialog: day with your mom and all.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: You made me a cupcake! For my
dialog: birthday! You’re about to give it
dialog: to me, right? And later tonight
dialog: there’s a surprise party!
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Who told you? Was it Becky?
dialog: 4l.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: No! Nobody told me! Don’t you see?
dialog: I know what’s going to happen
dialog: before it happens!
text: Tree grabs Lori’s arm, desperate/afraid.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Lori, somebody’s going to kill me
dialog: today.
text: Lori looks at Tree in total shock -- but she suddenly
text: cracks a smile and laughs.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Okay. I get it. Who put you up to
dialog: this? Danielle?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: No! This isn’t some stupid joke!
dialog: I’m being totally serious! It’s
dialog: already happened! But I don’t know
dialog: who it is!
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Okay, Tree...you’re starting to
dialog: freak me out.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: How do you think I feel?!
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Tree, listen to me. Nobody’s
dialog: trying to kill you.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Yes, they are--
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Tree! Look at me!
text: Gripping Tree by the shoulders, Lori looks into her eyes.
speaker_heading: LORI (CONT'D)
dialog: You need to take the day off. Skip
dialog: class. Get some rest. Maybe you
dialog: can talk to somebody.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Who?
dialog: 42.
scene_heading: INT. STUDENT HEALTH CENTER - AFTERNOON
text: We're CLOSE ON a “FEELINGS CHART” (a poster featuring a
text: series of cartoon faces with categorized moods matching
dialog: corresponding expressions.)
text: Tree sits rigidly on a floral print sofa, surrounded by
text: other posters encouraging “COMMUNICATION!” and
text: proclaiming “DEPRESSION: IT’S NOT YOUR FAULT”.
text: A light rap on the door precedes the entrance of DR. MARY
text: TURTLEBAUM (late 30’s, wispy, doe-eyed, saccharine). She
text: checks her file before offering her hand.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Hello, Teresa, I’m Mary.
text: Mary sits down across from Tree, pen and pad at the
dialog: ready.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: So, Teresa...what brings you here
dialog: today?
text: Tree struggles with how to even broach her crisis. After
text: a few prolonged seconds of false-starts and hand-
text: wringing, she decides just to blurt it out:
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I’m reliving the same day over and
dialog: over.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: That’s fairly common. Lots of
text: people feel stuck in a rut. The
dialog: routine of life can often feel--
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: No, you don’t get it! I’m
dialog: literally living the same day over
dialog: and over! It’s like I can’t get
dialog: out of it! And somebody keeps
dialog: killing me!
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I’m sorry?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: He’s wearing one of those school
dialog: masks!
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: The other night -- which will
dialog: actually be tonight --he stabbed
dialog: me to death near the quad and then
dialog: last night he chopped my head off
dialog: with a window!
dialog: (off Mary’s reaction)
text: It was broken. He smashed it with
text: a hockey stick.
dialog: (off Mary’s raised
dialog: eyebrow)
dialog: Nevermind. Point is, I keep dying
dialog: and then waking up. I’m scared out
dialog: of my mind! I don’t want to die
dialog: again!
text: Mary takes a beat to put this all down in her pad. Tree
text: waits in agony for a response, for some miraculous
dialog: intervention that’s going to make sense of it all. What
dialog: she gets is:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (sing-song)
dialog: Okee-dokey. I’m just going to
dialog: recap to make sure I’m getting
dialog: this straight.
dialog: (reading from her
dialog: note pad)
dialog: You wake up today, Tuesday the
dialog: 18th, and you re-live the same day
dialog: over and over, and the same exact
dialog: things happen in a specific,
text: linear order, before a maniac
dialog: wearing a mask stabs you or chops
dialog: your head off, and then you wake
dialog: up and start all over again?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Yes! But you make it sound so
dialog: crazy when you say it like that!
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Teresa, first of all, there’s no
dialog: such thing as “crazy”. There’s a
dialog: very logical explanation for
dialog: what’s happening to you.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: There is?
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Of course. Stress, fatigue,
dialog: repressed emotional trauma --
dialog: these are all powerful triggers.
dialog: Now what we can do, together, is
dialog: figure out which of these factors
dialog: is playing a role in
dialog: your...situation.
text: Tree stares at Mary incredulously as Mary begins flipping
dialog: through her schedule book.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m a little booked tomorrow, but
text: Thursday is wide open.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Lady, have you heard a single word
dialog: I’ve said?! I can’t come in
dialog: Thursday! I’1l be dead!
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (placating)
dialog: I’m so sorry, Teresa. You’re
dialog: absolutely right. What I meant to
dialog: say was, in two days, which will
dialog: still be today, you can come in
dialog: and we can get down to the bottom
dialog: of this.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Right. Sounds great. I'll just die
dialog: a couple more times before I come
dialog: back here to sit on this ugly
dialog: couch so you can make me feel
dialog: crazy and then tell me there’s no
dialog: such thing as crazy even though
dialog: what’s happening to me is totally-
dialog: fucking-crazy!
text: Tree jumps up and grabs her bag.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks for the help.
text: She storms out and slams the door so hard the “FEELINGS”
text: poster falls off the wall.
dialog: 45.
scene_heading: INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - EVENING
text: The dresser slowly lumbers across the floor as Tree
text: pushes it flush against her bedroom door. Along the way,
text: a few items fall off the top -- including Tree’s
text: graduation PHOTO with mom and dad.
text: Tree picks it up, studies the image for a second, tracing
text: her finger over her mother’s smiling face.
text: Suddenly, somebody tries the handle. Tree looks at the
text: door startled.
dialog: There’s a knock then:
speaker_heading: DANIELLE (0.S.)
dialog: Tree? Why’s the door locked?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I’m...uh...just need a little
dialog: privacy.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE (0.S.)
dialog: What time are you going to the
dialog: party tonight?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I don’t know...later.
text: Tree looks at the clock -- 9:22
dialog: Then the digit changes to 9:23
speaker_heading: BLACKOUT.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE (0.S.)
dialog: Our tuition dollars at work.
text: The lights turn back on.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE (0.S.) (CONT’D)
dialog: Anyhoo...don’t be too late or all
dialog: the cute Sigma boys will be taken.
text: Tree listens to Danielle’s FOOTSTEPS walking away -- her
text: eyes suddenly filling with purpose...
dialog: 46.
scene_heading: INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - LATER
text: Tree has dismantled her Ikea night stand and is nailing
text: the wood panels over the windows. Finished, she gives
dialog: them a good tug to be sure they’re secure.
text: With the windows sealed-shut and the door locked and
text: securely blocked, she feels “safe”.
text: TV back on, Tree finds the CUPCAKE Lori made for her
text: sitting on her desk. She settles onto her bed and begins
text: peeling the paper off of her treat. About to take a bite,
text: Tree notices the “Road Rules” marathon is still playing.
text: It feels like a bad omen, she opts for a station change.
text: Tree begins searching for the remote but it’s nowhere to
dialog: be found.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: Lori...what’d she do with the
dialog: freagin’ remote?
text: Tree goes to her desk, riffling through loose papers when
text: she comes upon her stack of mail and THE BLACK ENVELOPE.
text: There’s no post mark and the front is blank.
text: Perplexed, Tree opens it...
text: Inside the envelope is one of those 3-D cards featuring a
text: weird little Elf waving a “Happy Birthday” sign attached
text: to a tiny spring. As the sign bounces the Elf GIGGLES
text: through a tiny, hidden voice box.
text: On the blank side of the card, written in black marker, a
text: child-like scrawl reads:
dialog: “HOPE IT’S YOUR LAST ONE...”
text: Disturbed, Tree slowly lowers the card when --
text: The TV turns off.
text: Tree looks at it.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell?
text: She walks over and turns it back on manually. “Road
text: Rules”. Tree immediately changes the channel.
dialog: 47.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON -- THE TELEVISION SCREEN
text: The first station change brings us to the famous opening
dialog: credits of “The Twilight Zone”.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: No shit.
text: She changes the channel again to an unfolding “Breaking
text: Story” on a local news station. A female REPORTER
text: standing outside the entrance to an EMERGENCY ROOM.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: --where suspected murderer Joseph
text: Tombs is being treated for a
text: gunshot wound following a deadly
dialog: shoot-out this morning that left
text: one officer dead.
text: The story CUTS TO a MUG-SHOT of the menacing killer.
speaker_heading: REPORTER (CONT’D)
dialog: Tombs had been the subject of a
dialog: nationwide manhunt--
text: The TV suddenly TURNS OFF AGAIN...
text: Tree freezes. In the stillness, we HEAR a scraping noise
dialog: coming from
speaker_heading: THE CLOSET.
text: At this moment, it dawns on Tree that she never checked
text: the room before she barricaded herself inside.
text: Picking up the HAMMER, Tree advances slowly toward the
text: closet -- the door is slightly ajar.
text: She grips the handle...raises the hammer, ready to
dialog: strike...
speaker_heading: PULLS!
scene_heading: ANGLE ON -- THE CLOSET
dialog: Empty.
text: Tree notes a lone wire hanger, gently scraping on the
dialog: wall.
dialog: 48.
text: She sighs with relief and closes the door. But as she
text: turns around, Tree’s focus moves to another part of the
dialog: room...
text: THE BATHROOM.
text: Through the open doorway, she can see the shower -- the
text: opaque curtain is drawn. Did it just move a little?
text: Tree crosses the room.
text: IN THE BATHROOM
text: Tree stops at the shower. As she reaches out for the
dialog: curtain...
text: The TV turns back on! A loud COMMERCIAL blares, scaring
dialog: the shit out of us!
text: Spinning around, Tree looks at the TV. Her eyes slowly
text: move to the bed and then the slip cover where the sole of
text: a BLACK BOOT is just sticking out from under the fabric.
dialog: He's hiding under the bed!
text: Tip-toeing back into the bedroom, Tree gingerly kneels
text: down in front of the bed, keeping her hammer at the
dialog: ready.
text: Looking over Tree’s shoulder, we SEE the shower curtain
text: is OPEN -- as the masked killer emerges from the
dialog: bathroom!
text: Tree doesn’t see him creeping toward her, the long blade
text: of his knife at his side...
text: Tree yanks the slip up and finds the boot -- but it’s not
dialog: attached to anybody. That’s when she HEARS it...
text: BREATHING.
text: Tree slowly turns around...
text: Before she can scream the killer strikes! Tree narrowly
text: dodges the blade as it digs into the mattress!
text: Running for her door, Tree tries to push the dresser out
dialog: of the way but there isn’t time! The killer is already
text: behind her.
dialog: 49.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE TREE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: We HEAR Tree screaming in agony as her blood begins to
text: spill-out under the crack of the blocked door...
speaker_heading: SLAM CUT:
scene_heading: INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING
text: The tolling bells outside are drowned out by Tree’s
text: hysterical awakening -- THRASHING and SCREAMING so loud
dialog: that Carter himself screams from the shock!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What’s wrong?!
text: Jumping out of bed too quickly, Tree suddenly doubles-
text: over in pain. Carter rushes to her side.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Tree ---
text: She shoves him back. Her cell phone plays “Happy
text: Birthday”. Tree grabs the phone and throws it against the
dialog: wall.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: SHUT UP!!!
text: Afraid, Carter jumps back. Tree grabs her head,
text: distraught.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ohmygod..ohmygod...make it stop,
dialog: please make it stop...
text: Carter tries to approach Tree again.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What’s wrong? Are you sick?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Just get away from me!
text: Pain subsiding, Tree pulls the T-shirt off and starts
text: changing into her clothes. Carter spins around.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I don’t know what’s going on but --
dialog: 50.
text: Carter turns around -- Tree’s already out the door. A
text: second later, the lanky freshman peeks into Carter's
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: FRESHMAN
dialog: Dude...what's up the psycho-
dialog: hottie?
scene_heading: EXT. THE CAMPUS - MORNING
text: Tree staggers through the crowded thoroughfare -- her
text: eyes darting left and right. Everyone she passes has an
text: air of menace.
dialog: Anyone could be her killer.
scene_heading: TREE’S POV -- VARIOUS “SUSPECTS” STARING BACK...
text: * A PROFESSOR peering at us over the rim of his coffee
dialog: cup.
text: * A PAINTER, wearing a bandana over his mouth, looks up
text: from his work to tracks us with his eyes.
text: * A STUDENT VENDOR, working behind an espresso kiosk,
text: stares at us through a glass partition.
text: Becoming winded again, Tree stops in the middle of the
text: walk way. The student protester thrusts the petition at
dialog: Tree!
speaker_heading: STUDENT PROTESTER
dialog: Stop global warming!
text: Tree staggers back.
text: The car alarm goes off.
text: Then the sprinklers.
text: Behind her, the FRAT GUYS are singing...
speaker_heading: FRAT PLEDGES
dialog: -- not a Willie or a Sam! I’m the
dialog: eighth ole’ man named Henry!
dialog: Henry the Eighth, I am!
speaker_heading: FRAT BROTHER
dialog: Second verse, same as the first!
dialog: 51.
text: Tree begins to turn in a circle, the world spinning
text: around her in a kaleidoscopic nightmare!
text: The protester, the car alarm and the frat guy’s voices
dialog: grow louder and louder!
text: Students begin to stop and stare at Tree, who is caught
text: in the middle like a trapped animal.
text: The world begins to whirl faster and faster...
text: The voices become louder and louder...
text: Until everything builds to a deafening crescendo!
text: And Tree collapses onto the pavement.
scene_heading: INT. TREE’S HOSPITAL ROOM - AFTERNOON
text: Tree is arguing with DR. ELLIOT WINTER (50’s, kind face).
text: Arms folded, pouting like an indignant little girl, Tree
dialog: doesn’t want to be here.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: It’s just a concussion right?
dialog: That’s not a big deal. Why can’t I
dialog: go?
speaker_heading: DR. WINTER
dialog: Where’s your father? We’ve been
dialog: trying to contact him but we must
dialog: have an old number on file.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: What do you need him for?
speaker_heading: DR. WINTER
dialog: We need your full medical history.
dialog: Our system’s down from the rolling
dialog: black-outs and we can’t retrieve
dialog: any records. Specifically, we're
dialog: trying to find out how many times
dialog: you've been hospitalized.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Never.
speaker_heading: DR. WINTER
dialog: Excuse me?
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I’ve never been hospitalized
dialog: before.
text: A grave expression falls over the doctor’s face.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
text: Dr. Winter opens a file and puts up a series of X-RAYS on
text: the LIGHT BOARD.
speaker_heading: DR. WINTER
dialog: We just got these back from the
dialog: lab. You see here --
text: He runs his finger over a CHEST X-RAY.
speaker_heading: DR. WINTER (CONT'D)
dialog: These are your lungs. There’s some
dialog: scar tissue here. At first we
dialog: thought it was a sign of
text: pneumothorax.
dialog: (off Tree’s blank
dialog: stare)
text: A collapsed lung. But then we saw
dialog: these...
text: He points to light-colored lines crisscrossing through
text: her NECK and LOWER ABDOMEN.
speaker_heading: DR. WINTER (CONT'D)
dialog: These are signs of major trauma,
dialog: Teresa. Given the severity of the
dialog: scar tissue and the size of the
dialog: lesions...
text: He shakes his head, unable to finish his sentence.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: What?!
text: Slowly, Dr. Winter turns his baffled gaze on Tree.
speaker_heading: DR. WINTER
dialog: You should be dead.
text: The words sink in slowly.
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: DR. WINTER (CONT'D)
dialog: We're going to keep you here for
dialog: observation. Your heart rate’s a
dialog: little low and we need--
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: I have to go.
text: Tree starts to get out of bed.
speaker_heading: DR. WINTER
dialog: Whoa. Hold, on. You’re not going
dialog: anywhere.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I have to go! He’s going to kill
dialog: me again!
text: Dr. Winter forces Tree back into her bed.
speaker_heading: DR. WINTER
dialog: Teresa, I need you to calm down...
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: NO! LET ME GO!
speaker_heading: DR. WINTER
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: I need a little help in here!
text: Two NURSE’S rush into the room.
speaker_heading: DR. WINTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Get me three cc’s of pentobarbital
dialog: right away.
text: Tree grabs Dr. Winter’s arms, pleading desperately:
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Please...I don’t want to die
dialog: again...
speaker_heading: DR. WINTER
dialog: Nobody’s going to hurt you Teresa.
dialog: We just want to help.
text: The nurse returns with the shot. Tree takes one look at
text: the needle and starts freaking out.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: DR. WINTER (CONT'D)
dialog: (shouting at the
dialog: nurses)
dialog: Hold her down, damn it!
text: Arms pinned, Tree is helpless as the needle sinks into
text: her skin. She begins to slow down, losing her motor
text: skills. In a matter of seconds, she’s out again.
scene_heading: INT. TREE’S HOSPITAL ROOM - EVENING
text: A thick silence fills the air as Tree slowly begins to
text: emerge from the fog of her sedation.
text: From her blurry POV we’re looking at the door. It slowly
text: begins to OPEN.
text: A MAN enters...
text: As he draws closer, we SEE he’s wearing THE MASK.
text: Tree opens her mouth to scream, but no sound comes out!
text: He reaches out to grab her! Tree recoils!
text: But Tree’s vision pulls into focus and she realizes it’s
text: just Gregory and he’s not wearing a mask.
text: He sits beside her.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: Hey...Tree it’s me. It’s okay.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: (alarmed)
dialog: What are you doing in here?
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: Just checking on you. I heard they
dialog: had to sedate you. The drugs take
text: a little while to wear off.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: What day is it?
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: Tuesday, the 18th. Why?
text: Tree closes her eyes. It wasn't a bad dream.
text: Her eyes fill with tears.
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Nobody...believes me.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: Believes what?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: That I’m dying...every day.
dialog: Must be the drugs.
text: Gregory brushes her hair out of her face.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: I can’t stay long. Stephanie’s
dialog: gotten us into some god-awful
dialog: charity thing tonight. But I‘1l
dialog: come check on you first thing in
dialog: the morning.
text: Tree licks her dry-lips.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I’m really thirsty.
text: Gregory starts to pour her some water.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: No water. Can you get me a Coke?
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: Sure. Be right back.
text: He kisses her forehead and leaves.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY -- HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER
text: Gregory fights with the machine as it won’t take his
text: dollar. It finally sucks it in. He punches the button as
text: the soda can dumps into the tray.
text: We TRACK Gregory back to Tree’s room.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: (announcing as he
dialog: enters)
dialog: Special delivery...
scene_heading: INT. TREE’S HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Entering the room, Gregory comes to an abrupt halt...
dialog: 56.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON -- TREE’S EMPTY BED
text: She's gone.
scene_heading: INT. 4TH FLOOR -- HOSPITAL - SAME
text: Tree quietly exits the elevator -- there’s only one NURSE
text: at the station but she’s too busy reading a cheesy
text: harlequin novel to notice Tree as she tip-toes right past
dialog: her.
text: Reaching the door to Gregory’s office, Tree glances to
text: her right and notices the POLICE OFFICER isn’t stationed
text: at the end of the hall. But his chair is still there
text: beside a fresh, steaming cup of coffee.
scene_heading: INT. GREGORY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Gingerly closing the door behind her, Tree goes straight
text: to Gregory’s desk and opens the top drawer. She grabs
dialog: what she came for...
scene_heading: HIS CAR KEYS.
scene_heading: INT. 4TH FLOOR -- HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS
text: Peering into the hallway, Tree makes sure the coast is
text: clear. But as she reaches the elevator, the doors
dialog: automatically open.
text: Tree freezes...
text: Gregory steps out.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: Tree? What are you doing?
dialog: Tree bolts!
speaker_heading: GREGORY (CONT’D)
dialog: Tree!
text: Running down the hall, Tree makes a desperate dash for
text: the emergency exit. She’s still weak so it’s easy for
text: Gregory to gain ground.
text: Passing a GURNEY, Tree stops to push it in Gregory’s
text: direction. It slows him down a little but not enough.
text: Tree collides with the FIRE EXIT DOOR but it doesn’t
dialog: budge.
dialog: 57.
text: Gregory stops a few feet away from Tree.
speaker_heading: GREGORY (CONT’D)
dialog: Tree, listen to me --
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: YOU KILLED ME!
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: Tree, you’re delirious. Let me
dialog: help you.
text: Tree turns back to the fire door and begins banging on
dialog: the handle.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Somebody help me!!!
text: She feels something WET hit her hospital gown. Tree spins
dialog: around...
scene_heading: ANGLE ON -- GREGORY
text: Eyes wide, blood running out of the corner of his mouth.
text: He collapses to the floor revealing THE KILLER STANDING
dialog: BEHIND HIM!
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: No...
text: The killer rips the knife from Gregory's back!
text: Tree kicks the handle this time. The door SWINGS OPEN
text: just as the killer steps over Gregory’s body.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS
text: Hobbling down the stairs, Tree looks up as the killer
dialog: pursues!
text: Using everything she’s got, Tree runs down four more
text: floors until she reaches the FIRST PARKING LEVEL.
scene_heading: INT. PARKING LEVEL 1 - CONTINUOUS
text: Bursting out the door, Tree screams for help but there’s
text: no one around.
text: Behind her, the killer continues his relentless chase.
dialog: 58.
text: Tree scans the area, desperately searching for Gregory’s
text: car. There’s too many! It could be anywhere! She starts
text: pressing the ALARM button on his key-chain.
dialog: The killer is getting closer!
text: Frantically pressing the button, an alarm finally goes
text: off two rows over. Tree and the killer are about
text: equidistant to the flashing lights and honking horn of
text: Gregory’s car.
text: They both pause for a split-second. Waiting to see who
dialog: makes the first move...
text: Sucking in a deep breath, Tree goes for it! Running
dialog: harder than she’s ever run before in her life!
text: The killer keeps pace. It looks like they’re going to
text: make it to Gregory’s car at the same time but Tree gets
dialog: there first.
scene_heading: INT. GREGORY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: Lunging into the car, Tree slams the door shut and hits
text: the LOCK BUTTON just as the killer SLAMS against the
dialog: driver’s side window!
dialog: Tree SCREAMS!
text: The killer immediately begins pounding the glass with the
text: butt of his knife. Tree tries to start the car but her
text: hands are trembling too much.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: COME ON!!!
text: The glass begins to crack!
scene_heading: CLOSE ON -- THE KEY
text: As it slips into the ignition. Tree starts the engine and
dialog: throws it in REVERSE!
text: Peeling rubber, Gregory’s car flies back and smashes into
text: a parked car. Looking ahead, Tree sees the killer
text: standing a few feet ahead.
text: Slamming the gear into DRIVE she stomps on the pedal --
text: the car lunges forward. The killer narrowly dives out of
dialog: the way!
dialog: 59.
scene_heading: INT. PARKING LEVEL 1 - CONTINUOUS
text: The killer slowly rises to his feet as Tree speeds off in
text: Gregory’s car.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN ENTRANCE -- POTSDAM UNIVERSITY - NIGHT
text: Racing off the campus grounds, Gregory’s car fish-tails
text: onto the main road.
scene_heading: INT. GREGORY’S CAR - NIGHT
text: The lights of the isolated campus fade from view as Tree
text: pushes the speedometer past 80.
text: Realizing she’s escaped, Tree is overcome by a wild
text: euphoria. She begins pounding the steering wheel,
text: laughing through her tears.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I did it!!!
text: Her celebration is cut short by the sound of SIRENS. Tree
text: glances into the rear-view window as a POLICE CAR closes-
text: in behind her.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit.
text: Tree slows down and pulls onto the shoulder. OFFICER BILL
dialog: SANTORA (40’s, seen too many Clint Eastwood movies)
text: saunters up to the driver’s side and raps his knuckles on
text: the glass. Tree rolls the window down, trying to stay
dialog: calm.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: I know. I was speeding.
speaker_heading: OFFICER SANTORA
dialog: Turn the engine off.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Sorry, officer.
text: She kills the engine.
speaker_heading: OFFICER SANTORA
dialog: License and registration.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Um...I don’t have them.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: OFFICER SANTORA
dialog: Pardon?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: (blurting out)
dialog: Someone’s trying to kill me again!
speaker_heading: OFFICER SANTORA
dialog: Again?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Yes!
dialog: (realizing how that
dialog: sounds )
dialog: I mean no! I mean...he’s tried
dialog: before but this time I got away
dialog: but I didn’t have time to get my

dialog: was in my pocket.
text: Santora grabs his FLASHLIGHT and shines it in Tree's
text: face. She squints back.
speaker_heading: OFFICER SANTORA
dialog: Ma’am, are you under the influence
dialog: of alcohol or any other controlled
dialog: substance?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: No! I’m not--
dialog: (pause/epiphany)
dialog: Wait. If I am, does that mean
dialog: you'll arrest me and put me ina
dialog: jail cell?
speaker_heading: OFFICER SANTORA
dialog: That’s usually how it works.
dialog: Realizing she couldn’t be in a safer place:
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I’m drunk!
speaker_heading: OFFICER SANTORA
dialog: You are?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Wasted! And I’m high. Pills, weed,
dialog: you name it man! I’m on it!
dialog: Santora couldn’t be more confused.
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: OFFICER SANTORA
dialog: Well...then I’m placing you under
dialog: arrest.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Good idea.
text: She gets out of the car. Santora cuffs Tree’s hands
text: behind her back and leads her to his cruiser. As he opens
text: the back door, Tree looks at him and smiles.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: Officer Santora: Weirdo.
text: He pushes Tree into the backseat. The POLICE RADIO
text: suddenly CRACKLES.
speaker_heading: DISPATCHER
dialog: All units, we've got a 187 at the
dialog: university hospital.
text: Santora pauses, listening to the homicide report.
speaker_heading: DISPATCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Suspect is believed to be an
dialog: escaped patient. Be advised--
text: As Santora looks at Tree’s hospital gown he’s suddenly
text: flooded by a BRIGHT LIGHT!
text: We HEAR an engine roar! Before he can even turn, Santora
text: is struck by a speeding car! The impact SHEERS the back
text: door right off as Tree SCREAMS in terror!
text: The UNKNOWN VEHICLE makes a hard 180 and stops.
text: Hands cuffed tightly behind her back, Tree struggles to
text: get out of the cruiser. Feet crunching over broken glass,
text: she finally manages to shimmy out.
text: The other car idles...Tree can’t see the DRIVER beyond
text: the blinding HIGH-BEAMS.
text: Then she hears it: a door squeaking open. Footsteps begin
text: to draw closer. Tree looks around, there’s nowhere to
text: hide. Just miles of woods...
text: The driver, steps in front of one of the headlights --
text: backlit, we SEE it’s the masked killer.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Why are you doing this to me?!
text: Unsheathing his hunting knife, the killer begins to
dialog: advance.
dialog: Tree runs!
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS
text: Fighting for balance, Tree makes a futile attempt to flee
text: as her killer, with a clear advantage, takes his time.
text: Toying with her.
text: Tree screams for help but there’s nothing but miles of
dialog: forest.
text: Branches whip Tree in the face as her bare feet crunch
text: over twigs and, tiny jagged rocks.
text: With only a two-second lead, Tree runs as fast as she
text: can. Looking over her shoulder, the killer is gaining
dialog: ground!
text: Ahead, Tree sees some LIGHTS through the trees up ahead!
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: HELP! HELP ME!
text: She looks back over her shoulder again -- she’s suddenly
dialog: confused.
text: He's not behind her anymore...
text: Breaking out of the forest, Tree reaches a short clearing
text: -- she can see the lights of a FARM come into view.
text: Then she DROPS OUT of frame!
text: She just ran off a cliff.
text: We HEAR Tree cry out as she plummets over two hundred
text: feet! As she’s about to make impact with the jagged ROCKS
dialog: below we...
speaker_heading: SLAM CUT:
scene_heading: *ALTERNATE DEATH SCENE -- CONT. FROM PAGE 61*
dialog: 63.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT
text: Tree has just been placed into the backseat by Officer
text: Santora. A split-second after he closes the car door...
speaker_heading: WHAM!
text: Santora is struck by a speeding car as it broad-sides the
text: police car in a flash of scraping metal and flying
dialog: sparks!
dialog: Tree screams!
text: Looking though the plexi-glass partition, she can see
text: Santora’s crumpled body, mercilessly displayed in the
text: police car's headlights.
text: Tree looks for the other car but it’s nowhere to be
dialog: seen...
text: Suddenly, a pair of HIGH-BEAMS appear -- blinding Tree as
text: the car roars toward her at full throttle!
text: Tree goes for the door handle! But there is none!
scene_heading: ANGLE ON -- THE SPEEDING CAR!
text: Blazing a head-on collision course!
text: Tree braces for impact but the other car SLAMS on its
dialog: brakes at the last second!
text: Tires SCREECH! Then...silence.
text: The cop car is completely flooded with light now. Tree
text: shields her eyes as we HEAR a door open and close outside
text: followed by slow, encroaching FOOTSTEPS.
text: Suddenly a HAND slaps against Tree’s window! Tree yelps
text: as the MASKED KILLER comes into view, peering at Tree
text: like a bug in a jar.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: What do you want?!
text: He presents something to her...A BIRTHDAY CANDLE?
text: The killer lights it.
text: What he does next is even more baffling to Tree. He
text: simply turns around and goes back to his car.
dialog: 64.
text: The killer's car starts to back away...headlights fading
text: until they’re the size of distant FLASHLIGHT BEAMS...
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: (dumbfounded)
dialog: Where’s he going?...
text: And then his lights just GO OUT.
dialog: Beat...
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE KILLER'S CAR:
text: The black-gloved hand emerges from the open driver’s-side
text: window holding the birthday candle. He drops it...
speaker_heading: WHOOSH !
dialog: A FLAME IGNITES!
text: The fire starts at the killer’s car (driver’s side)
text: quickly running toward the police car!
text: BACK IN THE POLICE CAR:
text: Tree beats on the glass but, it too, is bullet-proof.
text: Looking toward the rear of the police car, Tree can see
text: the damaged gas tank -- hemorrhaging GASOLINE from the
dialog: previous collision.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON -- THE FLAMES
dialog: Running faster and faster in Tree’s direction!
scene_heading: CLOSE ON -- TREE
text: Face framed in the window as the glass suddenly reflects
text: an ORANGE/RED glow...
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh Fu--
dialog: BOOM!!!
text: The car explodes into a massive ball of fire!
scene_heading: INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING
text: The tower bell rings one last time as Tree’s eyes SNAP
text: OPEN...
dialog: 65.
text: ECU -- we SEE the FIRE BALL flare and then vanish in the
text: reflection of Tree’s eyes.
text: She sits up and wipes the sweat from her brow. A brief
text: glance around the room reminds her she’s still trapped in
dialog: the same day.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: Here we go again...
text: The opening bass-line of a White-Stripes-ish song
dialog: starts...
speaker_heading: BEGIN MONTAGE:
scene_heading: EXT. KAPPA DELTA HOUSE - MORNING
text: The two KAPPA GIRLS (who were X-ing in the bathroom at
text: Tree’s B-Day party) stare up at the second floor as
text: BOOKS, PAPERS, even a LAPTOP fly out of Tree’s bedroom
dialog: window.
scene_heading: INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Desk cleared of debris, Tree sits down and begins to jot-
text: down a list of NAMES in a small note-pad. The “suspects”
text: include KEITH, STEPHANIE, DANIELLE, and GREGORY... (But
text: she immediately goes back and crosses off Gregory since
text: he already died in front of her.)
scene_heading: EXT. KEITH’S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
text: On her tippy-toes, Tree peers through a first-floor
text: window. From her POV we can SEE Keith, already fast-
text: asleep in his over-sized Sponge-Bob pajamas.
text: Tree looks disappointed as she crosses his name of the
text: top of the list. She turns around and--
dialog: --WHAM!
text: She collides with the masked killer. Looking down, Tree
text: finds the handle of a knife protruding from her stomach.
text: PRELAP: “Happy Birthday” plays on Tree’s cell phone.
dialog: 66.
scene_heading: INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING
text: Already, sitting up in Carter’s bed, Tree grabs her
text: ringing cell phone and makes a perfect basket-toss into
text: Carter’s trash can.
text: Carter looks at her: crazy bitch.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROM -- TREE'S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Tree cuts huge chunks of her hair off (which has already
text: been died a hot shade of bright-pink).
scene_heading: EXT. THE PATIO - AFTERNOON
text: Danielle and the other Kappa girls stare in
text: horror/disgust as Tree (sporting her new-do) sprays a
text: bottle of Cheeze-Wiz into her open mouth.
scene_heading: EXT. GREGORY’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Gregory escorts Stephanie (he’s in a tux, she’s ina
text: gown) out of their up-scale house.
text: CLOSE ON -- THE PAD as Stephanie’s name is crossed out.
text: Gregory's sedan pulls out of the circular driveway --
text: Tree is suddenly tackled by her killer! Tree falls
text: backward into a KOI POND. She manages to knock the mask
text: off, but the killer shoves her head UNDERWATER...
text: Tree’s POV -- through the rippling water, she can’t make
text: out the identity of her attacker.
scene_heading: INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING
text: Tree wakes up and instantly leans over Carter’s bedside
text: to puke a stream of pond-water.
dialog: On Carter: gross!
scene_heading: EXT. THE CAMPUS - MORNING
text: Shot tastefully, Tree strolls down the thoroughfare
scene_heading: COMPLETELY NAKED...
text: ANGLE ON -- THE STUDYING PAIR as they look up and see
text: Tree. The sprinklers go off but they don’t even react
text: because they’re too stunned.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON -~ THE STUDENT PROTESTOR
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: STUDENT PROTESTER
dialog: Stop global war--
text: She sees Tree and pulls her clipboard back.
text: ANGLE ON -- THE FRAT PLEDGES who follow Tree’s naked body
text: with shocked grins. So distracted are they, nobody
text: notices when the exhausted brother passes-out.
text: ANGLE ON -- THE STAIRS where Tree crosses paths with
text: Keith. His eyes look like they’re going to shoot out of
text: his head. As Tree streaks by, she winks at him. Keith
text: turns too quickly to follow Tree and loses his footing.
text: He eats shit down the stairs.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET -- ON CAMPUS - AFTERNOON
text: Tree is walking with Danielle when a student bumps
text: Danielle. A BLACK CARD falls out of her bag. Tree grabs
dialog: it...it’s just like the one she found in her room
text: earlier. Danielle looks guilty.
text: Tree attacks her and a cat-fight ensues right there on
text: the street. A few BYSTANDERS try to stop them. Danielle
text: and Tree fall off the sidewalk and onto the street.
text: We HEAR a HORN blare one long note...
text: Tree and Danielle both turn as an on-coming BUS speeds
text: toward them. They both scream in unison then -- SPLAT!
text: INSERT: Tree’s “suspect list” as Tree crosses off
dialog: Danielle’s name.
scene_heading: EXT. THOROUGHFARE - NIGHT
text: Tree, donning army fatigues and camo face paint, makes
text: herself small behind a Tree. She waits, clutching a
text: baseball bat, as we HEAR approaching footsteps...
text: Just as the killer enters her periphery, Tree jumps out
dialog: and SWINGS!
speaker_heading: CRACK!
text: He goes down. But Tree’s face falls when she realizes it
text: wasn’t the killer. It was just BECKY (her chubby Kappa
text: sister), sneaking onto campus with a box of doughnuts,
text: which are now splayed around her unconscious body.
dialog: 68.
text: Tree drops the bat and rushes to Becky’s aid. Suddenly,
text: there’s a SNAPPING SOUND behind Tree. She looks over her
text: shoulder and finds the killer hovering over her -- armed
dialog: with Tree’s own bat!
text: But instead of screaming, Tree just sighs...
text: SLOW MOTION: the bat swings in CLOSE-UP and connects with
text: the side of Tree’s SKULL! Continuing with the motion,
text: Tree’s head slowly tilts out of frame and lands on--
dialog: --A PILLOW as we
scene_heading: END MONTAGE.
scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING
text: Tree’s HEAD lies on the pillow in the same position. She
text: opens her right-eye, squinting...
text: Outside, the bell tolls -- wincing in pain, Tree
text: gradually pushes herself up:
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: This-is-getting-really-friggin'-
dialog: old...
text: Looking to her right, she sees Carter staring at her.
text: “Happy Birthday” plays on her phone.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m fine. Really.
text: Tree stands. She grabs her phone and dismisses the call
dialog: from her father.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I don’t know if you--
text: She holds her hand up.
speaker_heading: TREE
text: Carter...sshh. A moment.
text: Carter nods as Tree shuffles over to his desk and
text: unearths the toiletry bag. She helps herself to his
dialog: aspirin.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: How did you...
text: He watches Tree pour 2...3...6 pills into the palm of her
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT’D)
dialog: I don’t think you’re supposed to
dialog: take that many. You could die.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: If only it were that easy.
dialog: (snapping her
dialog: fingers)
dialog: Water, por-favor.
text: As Carter retrieves a bottle from his bedside, Tree is
text: already at his door. She pulls it open -- the lanky
text: Freshman is already there but before he can say it...
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hi. I’m the so-called “fine-
text: vagine.
dialog: Freshman to Tree -- How the hell did she know he was
dialog: going to say that?
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: And if that’s the way you refer to
dialog: girls, then you and your hand are
dialog: going to have a very lasting
dialog: relationship.
text: Tree pushes him back gently.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks for stopping by.
text: And she closes the door in the freshman’s stunned face.
text: Turning around, Carter is still wearing the same confused
text: look on his face. Tree takes the bottle of water from him
text: and knocks back the pills before chugging down what’s
text: left of the water.
text: She tosses the empty bottle on the floor and finally
text: acknowledges Carter’s dumbfounded stare.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Are you always this charming in
dialog: the morning?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: (shit-eating grin)
dialog: Just this one.
text: Tree pulls her T-shirt off. Carter spins around as she
text: starts getting dressed.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: So...bad dream?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Sorry?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You were screaming before you fell
text: out of bed.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Oh. I was dying. Again.
text: Dressed, she turns around.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s a long story.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I’ve got nothing to do.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Trust me. You’1l think I’m
text: bonkers.
text: Tree bends down to grab her shoes and starts to leave.
text: But the same damn sticker gives her pause.
text: “TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY OF THE REST OF YOUR LIFE”
text: Tree turns around...
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Seriously, I hate this sticker.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY -- CARTER’S DORM - CONTINUOUS
text: Carter catches up with Tree at the stairs.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Why are you following me?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I hate when people start something
text: and they don’t finish.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Look, no offense, but there’s
dialog: really no point in explaining any
dialog: of it to you. Every time I try, I
dialog: end up sounding crazy which, at
dialog: this point, I must be.
text: She reaches the exit.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CAMPUS - CONTINUOUS
text: Tree puts her shoes on just outside the dorm. Carter is
text: still tailing her.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: So you’re having bad dreams. I
dialog: took an elective course on
dialog: neurocognition and dream content.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Hooray for you.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Maybe I can help?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Can you stop me from re-living the
dialog: same day, everyday, only to be
dialog: murdered by someone I may or may
dialog: not know?
dialog: Carter stops. Huh?
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Thought so.
text: Tree keeps going. Carter catches up again.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You literally think you’re re-
dialog: living the same day?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Yup.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: And somebody kills you?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Yup again.
text: They pass the student protestor.
speaker_heading: STUDENT PROTESTER
dialog: Stop global warming!
text: She thrusts the clipboard at Tree, who takes it and hands
text: it off to Carter. It stalls him, leaving Carter in Tree's
dialog: wake. He has to run and catch up yet again!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Come on. You’re just messing with
dialog: me, right? You don’t seriously
dialog: think you’re re-living the same
dialog: day?
text: Annoyed, Tree stops.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Car alarm...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What?
text: Just then, the CAR ALARM goes off.
text: Tree turns, facing the pair studying on the lawn.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Sprinklers...
text: She snaps her fingers and the sprinklers go off.
text: Tree grabs Carter by his shoulders and turns him to face
text: the FRAT PLEDGES.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: See that pledge over there? The
dialog: one with the baseball cap?
text: She points to the exhausted FRAT PLEDGE.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: TREE
text: He’s going to pass out right now.
text: Thump. He goes down on cue. Shocked, Carter slowly turns
text: and looks at Tree.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Any further questions?
scene_heading: INT. DAIRY QUEEN - AFTERNOON
text: Muzak plays softly in the background as Tree noisily
text: sucks down the last drops of her Oreo Blizzard through a
dialog: straw.
text: Carter is staring at her, mouth agape.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Please stop looking at me like I
text: have a dildo stuck to my forehead.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Sorry. I’m just trying to work
dialog: this whole thing out.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: And how’s that going for you?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I guess it’s kinda like that movie
dialog: “Groundhog’s Day”, only you're not
dialog: Bill Murray and instead of zany-
dialog: fun you're being violently
text: butchered.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Well, you’re a nerd. Don’t you
dialog: have some scientific theory about
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: First of all, I wouldn’t classify
dialog: myself as a nerd.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Carter, you have a poster of Boba
dialog: Fett in your dorm room. You’re a
dialog: nerd.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Whatever. Just because I like
dialog: science fiction doesn’t make me an
text: expert on crazy chicks trapped in
dialog: the same day.
text: Tree looks down, a little hurt. Carter feels bad.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT’D)
dialog: Look, if I were you I would stop
dialog: trying to figure out how it was
text: happening and start figuring out
dialog: why.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: There has to be a reason you’re
dialog: stuck in this day. Out of all the
dialog: days of your life, this day must
dialog: have some kind of meaning.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: But it’s like any other day.
dialog: Except the dying part.
text: Suddenly, Tree’s phone rings -- she looks at her CALLER
text: ID. It’s DAD again. Tree thinks of answering it...but
text: balks.
text: Tree nods.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (off the ring-tone)
dialog: It’s your birthday?
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT’D)
dialog: Hello?!
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: So what? Birthdays are just
dialog: excuses people make to eat cake
dialog: and get presents and shit. There's
dialog: no real meaning to a birthday.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: It’s symbolic! Whoever is killing
dialog: you knows it’s your birthday!
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Here -—
text: Carter unfolds a napkin and removes a PEN from his shirt
text: pocket. Tree stares at the pen.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT’D)
dialog: Okay. That's nerdy. Let’s move on.
dialog: Who knows it’s your birthday today
dialog: and who would want to kill you?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Well, thanks to my sorority
dialog: sisters, the whole school knows
dialog: it’s my birthday. They’re going to
dialog: throw me this stupid surprise
dialog: party tonight. It could be anyone.
dialog: At first I thought it was Gregory,
dialog: but he got killed last night.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Who's Gregory?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: One of my professors. We’ve been
text: having an affair.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Nice.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Hey, mister “I brought a drunk
dialog: girl home and took advantage of
dialog: her". Don’t judge.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: For the record, I didn’t take
dialog: advantage of you. I slept on the
dialog: couch.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: We didn’t --
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: No. You were wasted and I was
dialog: worried you’d fall or choke on
dialog: your own vomit like Janis Joplin.
dialog: 76.
text: Sitting across from her in the booth, Tree discovers two
dialog: things about Carter: he’s probably the sweetest guy in
dialog: the whole world and he’s actually kinda cute.
text: But she’s not letting her guard down.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Well...thanks but I would have
dialog: been fine.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yeah, I can see that.
text: Tree manages a laugh. It’s the first time we’ve seen her
dialog: smile like this.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CAMPUS - AFTERNOON
text: Carter is walking Tree back to her house. The sun is out,
text: the flowers are in bloom, and if they weren’t talking
dialog: about Tree dying violently every day, the moment would
dialog: almost seem romantic.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: There has to be somebody you
dialog: didn’t think of.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: That’s it. Everyone who'd want to
dialog: kill me had a solid alibi.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: But it could be somebody who knows
dialog: you but you don’t necessarily know
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Carter, that’s just dumb. Do you
dialog: know how many dozens of people
dialog: that could be. I'd spend the rest
dialog: of my life dying trying to figure
dialog: that out.
text: Carter snickers.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You just said you’d have to spend
dialog: the rest of your life dying.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: It was ironic.
dialog: (off Tree’s blank
dialog: expression)
dialog: Get it...”rest of your life
dialog: dying”...
dialog: (she’s still not
dialog: laughing)
dialog: Sorry. I'll shut up now.
text: They reach Tree’s house. She plops-down on the short wall
text: and releases an exasperated sigh of defeat.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT’D)
dialog: Can I ask you a dumb question?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Go for it.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Why don’t you just leave the
dialog: country?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Oh, you mean like on my private
dialog: jet? I don’t even have a passport.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Look, my parents gave me a credit
dialog: card for emergencies. You have a
dialog: driver’s license, right?
text: Tree nods.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT’D)
dialog: That’s it, then. We’ll put you on
dialog: a plane. Europe. Mexico. Whatever.
dialog: By the time you get there it’1ll be
dialog: tomorrow. Even if they send you
dialog: back cause you don’t have a
dialog: passport it’1ll still be the next
dialog: day. You’ll be home free!
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: (genuinely touched)
dialog: You’d...do that for me?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: My parents will freak when they
dialog: get the bill but if it means
dialog: keeping you alive...yeah. Of
dialog: course.
dialog: 78.
text: PRELAP: A HORN beeping...
scene_heading: INT. CARTER’S VW JETTA - DUSK
text: Carter and Tree are stuck in a long line of cars trailing
text: back from the interstate on-ramp.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: This is ridiculous. There aren't
dialog: even enough people in this stupid
text: town to make a traffic jam.
dialog: (punching the dash)
dialog: God, I hate this day!
text: Carter clears his throat.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: So, apart from the obvious
dialog: reasons, why are you so down on
dialog: your birthday?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I just think it’s dumb.
text: He looks at her. He's not buying that answer.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: My mom and I were born on the same
dialog: day.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: And you've had to share it all
dialog: your life and it pisses you off?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: No. The opposite. It was always
dialog: the best day of the year. I’d get
dialog: to skip school, we’d go to the
dialog: beach. My dad would get mom and I
dialog: this big cake. There was always
dialog: just one candle on it. Dad said it
dialog: was cause on this one day the
dialog: greatest people he knew were born.
dialog: (she laughs)
dialog: Mom said it was cause the cake
dialog: would look like a bonfire if both
dialog: our ages were on it.
text: Her smile fades. Carter sees the sadness in Tree’s eyes.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: She died, huh?
text: Tree nods as she shoves her hurt back down.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Three years ago. Cancer.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Sorry. That sucks.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Yeah, well...that’s life right?
text: Everybody dies. Some more than
dialog: others.
text: Inching closer to the on-ramp, Tree suddenly sits up in
text: her seat -- her gaze fixed ahead.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my God...
scene_heading: ANGLE ON -- A POLICE OFFICER
text: Directing the traffic around a small fender-bender, we
text: immediately recognize him as the SAME COP that pulled
text: Tree over before.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: He died...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: It was my fault. I made it happen.
text: Tree looks stricken with guilt as she watches the cop,
text: dutifully waving the cars toward the on-ramp --
text: completely unaware that three cars away, a young girl
text: he’s never even met has seen him die violently.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Turn around.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Take me back!
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Tree, I’m getting you out of here!
text: Reaching over, Tree grabs the steering wheel.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: The car behind Carter SLAMS on its breaks as Carter’s car
text: flips a bitch, swerving into oncoming traffic!
text: Narrowly escaping a major accident, Carter slips into the
text: flow of traffic heading BACK TOWARDS campus.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON -- THE POLICE OFFICER
text: Shaking his head disapprovingly as he continues to direct
dialog: cars.
scene_heading: INT. CARTER’S CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: Checking his rear-view mirror, Carter sighs with a mix of
text: relief and frustration.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Are you crazy?!
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Every time I try to run, somebody
dialog: dies! Nick, Gregory, that cop! If
dialog: I leave who knows how many more
dialog: people will die?!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: So then what?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I don’t know, okay?! I just...I
dialog: don’t know.
text: Carter turns to look at her. His face is so sympathetic
text: it clams Tree’s frayed nerves like a salve.
text: Looking ahead, the horizon is ablaze with a crimson glow
text: as the school’s BELL TOWER rises above the woods.
text: Ominous. Foretelling.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: (softly)
dialog: I know one thing...no more
dialog: running.
dialog: 81.
scene_heading: INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY -- KAPPA HOUSE - EVENING
text: A vexed Danielle bumps into Tree as she exits Tree's
text: room, holding Tree’s blouse.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: Where were you?
dialog: (off Tree’s blank
dialog: stare)
dialog: You ditched our house meeting.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Danielle, I’m sorry. I'm
dialog: just...going through a lot right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: It’s mandatory, Tree. I just
dialog: finished telling your roommate the
dialog: same thing. If you guys want to be
dialog: Kappa sisters you have to stick to
dialog: the schedule or else you're out.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Then I’m out.
text: Tree yanks her top out of Danielle’s hands and walks off.
text: Danielle is floored.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: Have fun back in the dorms!
scene_heading: INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - EVENING
text: Lori is zipping-up a small bag when Tree enters the room.
text: As she flops down on the bed, Tree notices the cupcake
text: sitting on the night stand.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: She just bitch you out too?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I so could care less.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: You two fighting?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Danielle and I?
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: No, you and Gregory. He asked
dialog: where you were. Said you didn’t
text: show up to his class.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I can’t even think about that
dialog: right now.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: I'm off. I have--
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: --a double shift. I know.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: (weird)
dialog: Right.
text: Lori starts out the door but stops. Something is on the
text: tip of her tongue...but she chickens-out.
speaker_heading: LORI (CONT'D)
dialog: See ya later.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Bye.
text: Lori leaves. Tree lays back down on her bed. Exhaustion
text: and pain have taken their toll as she easily dozes off.
scene_heading: INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - LATER
text: Tree wakes up. Looks at the clock...9:19
text: Danielle bangs on the door before entering in a huff.
text: She’s all dolled-up sans Tree’s totally cute top.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: Well, it was supposed to be a
dialog: surprise but since you’re being a
dialog: total bitch I’ve decided to spoil
text: it. The party at the Sigma house
dialog: tonight is a surprise birthday
dialog: party for your ungrateful-ass so I
dialog: suggest you suck it up and go.
dialog: Just don’t even try talking to me
dialog: when you’re there. Got it?
dialog: 83.
text: Danielle storms out, slamming the door behind her.
text: Instead of getting upset, Tree grabs the cupcake Lori
text: made her and peels-off the paper shell. She’s about to
dialog: take a bite when...
speaker_heading: BLACKOUT.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: (in the dark)
dialog: Damn it!
text: The lights come back on and Tree finds the cupcake
text: resting upside-down on the floor.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: So much for that.
text: Tree picks it up and dumps it in the trash. She turns the
text: TV on. The “Road Rules Marathon” is still playing.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh for god’s sake, enough already!
text: She changes the channel.
text: The same LOCAL NEWS REPORT is on. But this time, she’s
text: catching the beginning of the story. Tree instantly
text: recognizes the HOSPITAL in a WIDESHOT -- it’s the one on
dialog: campus.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: I'm standing outside Potsdam
dialog: University Hospital where
dialog: suspected murderer Joseph Tombs is
text: being treated for a gunshot wound
text: following a deadly shoot-out this
dialog: morning that left one officer
dialog: dead.
text: Tree slowly rises from her bed as they CUT TO Tombs’ mug-
dialog: shot.
speaker_heading: REPORTER (CONT’D)
dialog: Tombs was the subject of a
dialog: nationwide manhunt that ended
dialog: after a five month pursuit, across
dialog: four state lines that left six
dialog: known female victims.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: REPORTER (CONT’D)
dialog: Authorities are still not sure if
dialog: Tombs is responsible for the
dialog: murders of more than a dozen other
dialog: victims he claims to have buried
text: across the vast deserts of Arizona
dialog: and New Mexico.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON -- TREE’S STUNNED FACE
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: He’s been here this whole time?
text: FLASHBACK IN TREE’S MIND: Tree is running from Gregory in
text: the hospital. As she passes the room where the OFFICER’S
text: empty chair sat, she catches a split-second glance at the
text: closed door -- in the tiny, glass window we SEE specks of
speaker_heading: BLOOD.
scene_heading: BACK ON TREE -- AS SHE REALIZES
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my god. He’s going to escape...
scene_heading: INT. 4TH FLOOR -- HOSPITAL - NIGHT
text: The same NURSE is reading her harlequin novel when Tree
text: runs up to her station, startling her.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: He’s going to escape! Call the
dialog: police!
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Who?!
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Joseph Tombs! Just call the cops!
text: Tree runs down the hall -- she catches a GLIMPSE of the
text: guarding OFFICER as he enters the room!
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait! Don’t go in there!
text: He didn’t hear her. Tree spots a FIRE AXE mounted on the
text: wall. She retrieves it and approaches Tombs’ room.
text: Behind her the nurse calls after Tree:
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Excuse me! What are you doing?
dialog: 85.
text: Tree ignores her and enters the room.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: The first thing Tree sees is the empty hospital bed with
text: a pair of ARM RESTRAINTS dangling from the guard rails.
text: Moving deeper into the room, Tree discovers the OFFICER'S
text: BODY lying on the other side of the bed. His throat has
text: been slit, his GUN is missing from its holster.
speaker_heading: TOMBS (0.C.)
dialog: (Southern drawl)
dialog: Hey...
text: Tree turns around and finds her killer standing behind
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: TOMBS (CONT'D)
dialog: That's a pretty big axe you got
text: there, little girl.
text: Tombs raises the officer’s stolen handgun. Tree starts to
text: swing the axe -- Tombs fires twice! Both bullets ricochet
text: off the blade, knocking the axe out of Tree’s grip.
dialog: Tree: Oh shit.
text: Tree bolts for the door! Tombs goes after her!
scene_heading: INT. 4TH FLOOR -- HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS
text: Running out the door, Tree slams into the nurse.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: What are you--
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Run!
text: Tree tries to grab her but the nurse pauses to peer into
dialog: the room.
scene_heading: BAM-BAM-BAM!
text: Three rapid-fire shots take the nurse down. Tree screams
text: and runs for the elevators. She sees another NURSE in the
text: hall -- she bolts for the elevator. By the time Tree
text: reaches her, the elevator doors are already closing!
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: WAIT!
text: Too late! The doors close on Tree. Tombs rounds the
text: corner. Tree is trapped in the small reception area. He
text: laughs -- cold-blooded and mocking.
text: Backed against the elevator doors, Tree watches
text: helplessly as Tombs advances, gun raised and ready to
dialog: fire!
text: Suddenly, Carter appears BEHIND Tombs. He tackles Tombs --
text: the gun goes off twice before falling from his grip!
text: Tree is quick to grab the gun. She aims at Tombs and
dialog: fires!
text: CLICK...
text: Tree’s eyes widen in horror. It’s empty.
text: Without missing a beat, Tombs pulls a hunting knife
text: tucked away and drives the blade into Carter!
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Carter!!!
text: He’s dead. Tree backpedals away from the elevator as
text: Tombs rises to his feet.
text: Tree turns and runs down another CORRIDOR. It dead-ends
text: at a door marked “STAIRS”.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL -- BELL TOWER - CONTINUOUS
text: Assuming it was another fire-exit, Tree discovers the
dialog: stairs only go up...
text: ...toward the BELL TOWER.
text: Tombs bursts through the door!
text: Tree races up the wooden steps of this small, cramped
text: stairwell (metal candle holders line the wall) -- Tombs
text: is close behind! He lunges --
text: -- when Tree reaches back and KICKS him hard in the gut!
text: He slips back a few steps! She kicks him again -- square
text: in the face, shattering part of the mask -- exposing half
text: of Tombs demented grin.
dialog: 87.
text: Catching her ankle, he yanks her hard and she nearly
text: tumbles atop him!
text: Tree’s kicking at him, but his grip is iron clad.
text: Tombs snaps a metal candle stick from the wall --
text: prepared to stab her with the jagged metal edge! He
text: brings it down hard, Tree dodges the blow as the pointed
text: edge jams into the soft wood of the stair!
text: Tree seizes the moment and CLAWS his face as hard she
text: can. Tombs screams in agony! Wriggling out from under
text: him, Tree clamors for the entrance to the bell tower.
scene_heading: INT. BELL TOWER - CONTINUOUS
text: Moments later, Tombs steps into the loft.
text: He looks, where could she have gone? There’s no way out.
text: Tree is standing on the railing.
text: He’s confused. She’s three flights up.
text: He notices the rope leading from the bell tower...
text: -..is tied around her neck.
text: She turns, glares him in the eye.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: See you tomorrow, asshole.
dialog: She leaps!
text: In mid-air, the rope pulls taught! The bell rings out as
dialog: we...
speaker_heading: SLAM CUT:
scene_heading: INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING
text: Outside, the bell is still tolling as Tree’s eyes snap
text: open. She sucks in a breath of air and exhales with a
text: wheeze. Tree looks pale -- we don’t know how many more
dialog: “lives” she’s got left.
text: But her eyes are filled with purpose. She knows who her
text: killer is and she’s not afraid anymore.
text: Tree sits up and sees Carter staring at her.
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You’re up. I wasn’t --
text: Weak but elated to see him alive, Tree jumps out of bed
text: and throws her arms around Carter.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Thank you! I can’t believe you
dialog: tried to save me!
text: Carter’s body is rigid in Tree’s awkward embrace. He
text: finally pats her back cordially.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: No biggie.
text: She pulls away as her cell phone plays “Happy Birthday”.
text: By the time she retrieves it, she’s missed her dad’s
dialog: call.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Damn it.
text: Tree pulls her T-shirt off. Carter spins around.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I don’t know if you remember my
dialog: name --
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Carter.
text: He looks surprised. Tree grabs a pillow from his bed.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Can I borrow this?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Uh...sure. Why not?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Thanks.
text: She pecks him on the cheek.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: See you at lunch.
text: Now he’s really confused but before he can even ask she’s
text: already starting out the door. The freshman is just
text: arriving. As she passes him, Tree SLAPS his ass.
dialog: 89.
text: The freshman looks at Carter -- WIF?
dialog: Cue a hot song with a nice beat...
scene_heading: EXT. THE CAMPUS - MORNING
text: A walk of shame no more, Tree ditches her heels and
text: chucks them in the bushes before strutting down the main
dialog: thoroughfare.
text: Sun in her eyes, Tree casually snatches a pair of
text: SUNGLASSES off a passerby and puts them on. He spins
text: around and watches Tree keep going, too shocked to
dialog: protest.
text: She comes across the PROTESTER...
speaker_heading: STUDENT PROTESTER
dialog: Stop global--
text: Tree grabs the clipboard out of her hand and signs the
text: petition. She shoves it back into the protester’s hands,
dialog: adding:
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I love Al Gore.
dialog: Next stop, the frat pledges...
speaker_heading: FRAT PLEDGES
dialog: -- not a Willie or a Sam! I’m the
dialog: eighth ole’ man named Henry!
dialog: Henry the Eighth, I am!
speaker_heading: FRAT BROTHER
dialog: Second verse, same as the first!
speaker_heading: FRAT PLEDGES
dialog: Oh, Henry the Eighth, I am, I
dialog: am!...
text: The EXHAUSTED FRAT PLEDGE starts to go down, but his fall
text: is broken by Tree. She gently lays him down and sticks
text: the pillow under his head. He’s already out like a light
text: as Tree plants a kiss on his forehead.
text: A hush has fallen over the cheering crowd of onlookers.
text: Tree doesn’t pay any attention to them as she keeps
dialog: going.
dialog: 90.
text: Reaching the end of the quad, Tree starts down the steps.
text: She sees Keith up ahead and waves to him.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Morning Keith!
text: He almost has a heart attack as she gives him a bear hug.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Have a great day.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Thanks?
text: As he watches Tree go, his confused expression yields to
text: a smitten grin.
scene_heading: INT. KAPPA DELTA HOUSE - MORNING
text: Starting up the stairs, Tree is accosted by Danielle.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: Oh-my-god. You sneaky beeyotch!
text: Tree turns around.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: (rapid-fire)
dialog: His name’s Carter. We didn’t have
dialog: sex. But I think if I get through
dialog: this, I might have his children.
dialog: Lots to do. Gotta go.
text: Tree’s really racking-up the baffled expressions today.
scene_heading: INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Dressed and ready for the biggest day of her life, Tree
text: smiles as Lori exits the bathroom.
speaker_heading: LORI
text: She finally rolls-in.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Lori, I’m late for class but I
dialog: wanted to say that I’m sorry for
dialog: being such a shitty roommate. I
dialog: know you’ve been seeing somebody
dialog: and you couldn’t even talk about
dialog: it with me and that’s wrong. I
dialog: should have been there for you.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: But I want to change that.
dialog: Starting today.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Are you okay?
text: Tree smiles.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Never better.
scene_heading: INT. DR. BUTLER’S SCIENCE CLASS - MORNING
text: Late for class, Tree enters the lecture hall. The door
text: squeaks open, drawing everyone’s attention -- including
text: Gregory's as he turns from the chalkboard.
text: Only Tree doesn’t sit down.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Dr. Butler...a word please?
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY -- OUTSIDE GREGORY’S CLASS - MOMENTS LATER
text: Tree is already waiting outside as Gregory practically
text: explodes out of the lecture hall.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: What the hell do you think you're
dialog: doing?!
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Ending this.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: Wait. What?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I wish I’d never started seeing
dialog: you. It was wrong. Anyway, I can’t
dialog: change that. But I can start doing
dialog: the right thing today.
text: Gregory laughs -- it’s smug and condescending.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: What lame self-help book did that
dialog: come from?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: You know something, you have a
dialog: wife who really loves you.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: If you can’t be committed to her
dialog: then have the balls to leave her.
text: That shut him up. Tree starts off.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: (shouting after her)
dialog: Don’t expect me to let you coast-
dialog: by in my class now!
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: I already dropped it!
text: She flips him the bird before disappearing out the door.
scene_heading: EXT. LUNCH PATIO - AFTERNOON
text: The Kappa lunch meeting is in full swing. Danielle is
text: holding court when she sees Tree approach the table with
text: a tray FULL of junk food. She sets it down and instantly
text: dives-into a wedge of cheesecake. Everyone is staring at
text: her like she’s a leper.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: (mouth-full)
dialog: This is totally amazing.
text: Becky arrives with her tray -- including a sandwich,
text: pasta salad, and the notorious glass of chocolate milk.
text: As she sits down...
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: Did I miss the memo?
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: Sorry?
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: What’s up with the fat-fest? We’re
dialog: Kappa’s.
text: Tree shoves her plate of cheesecake toward Danielle.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Live a little, hon. A few calories
dialog: won’t kill you.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: No, they’1l just turn me into a
dialog: chunker like Becky here.
dialog: 93.
text: Becky looks like she’s going to die. She starts to get up
text: with her tray of food. She doesn’t see Carter coming.
speaker_heading: SMASH!
text: They collide. Only this time, Tree’s ready as she nimbly
text: ducks out of the way. Becky’s chocolate milk flies off
text: the tray and splashes all over Danielle!
dialog: Tree cracks up!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Oh my god! I’m so sorry!
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Don’t be. That was perfect.
text: Becky starts laughing with Tree. Danielle gets up. As
text: more people see her dripping wet they start laughing too.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: Shut up!
text: Her tantrum only makes them laugh harder. Bursting into
text: tears, Danielle runs off with some of her Kappa cronies
text: chasing after her.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I didn’t mean to--
text: Tree grabs him and plants a big kiss on his lips. She
text: finally pulls away. Carter’s eyes are as wide as saucers.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT’D)
dialog: What was that for?
text: “Happy Birthday” starts playing again on Tree’s cell
text: phone. It’s dad again.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Look, I have to run but what are
dialog: you up to tonight?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Um...nothing.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Would you like to take me out for
dialog: my birthday?
dialog: 94,
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Okay. What’s the punch-line?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I’m being serious. I know it’s
dialog: kinda random but I’1l explain
dialog: everything tomorrow assuming there
dialog: is one. Just say yes.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yes?
text: Tree pecks him on the cheek. As she heads off, Carter
text: looks at Becky -- they both share confused grins.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - AFTERNOON
text: Tree’s dad, DAVID (late 40’s, distinguished), sits in the
text: half-empty restaurant -- an empty coffee cup in front of
dialog: him.
text: He looks at his watch with a sigh before waving the
text: WAITRESS over to his table.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Can I pay for my coffee?
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: You’re not going to eat, honey?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No. Thanks. Just the check.
text: The waitress leaves. David fishes out his wallet and
text: removes a ten. But when he looks up, he finds Tree
text: standing there.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Hi, daddy. Sorry I’m late.
text: Tree takes a seat across from him. She can tell he’s
dialog: hurt.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: You look nice. I like the tie.
text: David looks down at his tie.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 95.
text: An uncomfortable silence fills the air. Tree looks down,
text: ashamed she’s let the distance between them get this far.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: How’s school?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: It's fine. Dad, I don’t want to do
dialog: that anymore.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Do what?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: You know...small talk.
text: David looks surprised by her forthrightness.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: This day...it’s so hard. I miss
dialog: her so much. And I thought if I
dialog: just avoided it -- and you, it’d
dialog: be easier. But it’s worse. All
dialog: this running and hiding has made
dialog: me so unhappy. I think I finally
dialog: figured it out. It took something
dialog: crazy for me to get it. But I’m
dialog: here and I love you and--
dialog: (she chokes up)
dialog: I’m so sorry for hurting you.
text: Tree’s dad looks visibly moved. Tree wipes her own tears
text: away. David takes her hand and kisses it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Happy Birthday, baby.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Thanks daddy.
scene_heading: NEW SHOT -- FROM ACROSS THE ROOM
text: We SEE Tree and David engaged in conversation. Picking-up
dialog: where they left off three years ago.
scene_heading: INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - EVENING
text: We’re CLOSE ON a chef’s KNIFE as Tree slides it into the
text: back of her jeans before hiding the handle with a tight T-
dialog: shirt.
dialog: 96.
text: Pulling her hair back into a pony tail, she glances at
text: her reflection in the mirror. Her eyes say all we need to
text: know...she’s ready to take control of her destiny.
dialog: Teresa Gelbman is going to make it to Wednesday, the
dialog: 19th.
dialog: Even if it kills her.
scene_heading: INT. 4TH FLOOR -- HOSPITAL - NIGHT
text: We follow Lori as she comes down the hall -- she passes
dialog: the nurse’s station where our hopeless romantic (the same
text: nurse every night) has her face buried in the harlequin
dialog: novel.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Deena, I’m taking my break. Back
dialog: in a few.
text: The nurse doesn’t look up. She just answers with a “K”.
text: Lori steps into the elevator. As the doors close, we see
text: the adjacent doors open revealing Tree.
text: Our heroine slips by the nurse’s station. Much to her
text: relief, she finds the OFFICER just sitting down outside
text: Tomb’s room with his hot cup of coffee.
text: Tree quietly approaches him. He looks up at her,
dialog: surprised.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Help you?
text: Tree brings a finger to her mouth, shushing him.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: This is going to sound crazy, but
text: Joseph Tombs is going to escape
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: (you crazy?)
dialog: Come again?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Please. Just check on him.
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Look, I don’t know who you are,
dialog: missy, but you better turn around
dialog: and high-tail it out of here
dialog: before I have you thrown out.
text: He doesn’t even see it coming. Tree has the blade at his
text: throat before the officer can get the gun from his
text: holster.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I’m really sorry but you’re just
dialog: gonna have to do what I say right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: (scared)
dialog: Okay. Take it easy. Take it easy.
speaker_heading: TREE
text: Now stand up very slowly.
text: He does as he’s told.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: This is a real bad idea.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: So's getting killed for the sixth
dialog: time. Open the door.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Guiding the officer into the room, Tree’s relieved to
text: find Tomb’s still asleep in his bed.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: See? Safe and sound.
text: She nudges the officer closer.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER (CONT’D)
dialog: Look, he’s not--
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Shoot him.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: What?!
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: TREE
text: Shoot him in the head.
text: They both don’t see Tomb’s eyes slowly open...
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Girly, you are out of your
dialog: freakin’ mind!
scene_heading: CLOSE ON -- TOMB’S ARM RESTRAINTS
text: His wrists are just resting in them but the straps are
text: already UNDONE.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: He’s going to kill me! Shoot him!
text: Tombs suddenly LUNGES at the cop and shoves the knife he
text: was hiding into the police officer’s stomach!
text: Tree staggers back as Tombs rises from his bed. He picks
text: up the MASK sitting on the table beside his bed.
text: Tree grabs the fallen officer’s GUN! She aims it at Tombs
dialog: and squeezes the trigger! Nothing happens!
speaker_heading: TOMBS
dialog: The safety's still on little
dialog: girl...
text: The blood covered Tombs throws his full weight atop her!
text: She goes down hard -- shattering a rib! The gun sails
text: across the room from the impact!
text: He drops the knife, climbing atop her, choking her with
dialog: his bare hands!
speaker_heading: TOMBS (CONT'D)
dialog: I should cut off your head and be
dialog: done with it... but this feels so
dialog: much better, no?
text: But this isn’t the weak and defenseless Tree who has been
text: killed again and again. She focuses --
text: -- and drives her open palm hard into his nose! He cries
text: out in pain. Tree tries to run but he grabs her by her
text: shirt and throws her across the room! Tree hits the wall
text: like a rag doll.
dialog: 99,
text: Tombs retrieves the knife and slowly stalks over to Tree.
text: She’s in too much pain to move.
text: He he stands above her, the knife in the air. Tombs
text: flashes a sadistic grin.
dialog: But he’s surprised...
dialog: ..-when she smiles back?!
text: 9:23. Blackout.
text: Moments pass.
text: The lights come back on.
dialog: He is surprised that Tree... is gone?!
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Psst.
text: No, not gone. She took advantage of the blackout to
text: scramble a few feet away and pick up the gun.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks for the tip.
text: .--and as he lunges at her, knife in hand...
text: .-.-she empties the gun into his chest!
text: Tombs falls back onto the bed, a bloody mess. DEAD.
text: We HOLD ON Tree -- exhausted but still alive. A victim no-
dialog: more.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. KAPPA DELTA HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The police have gone, the ordeal is finally over. Carter
text: is walking Tree to her house.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: So this has to be strangest
dialog: birthday you've ever had.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: You have no idea.
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Did the police say how Tombs got
dialog: free?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: They really don’t know.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Like Houdini.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I guess.
text: They stop outside her front door.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: So, sorry our little date didn’t
dialog: happen.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: It’s okay. There’s always
dialog: tomorrow.
text: Tree glances at her watch. It’s 11:53 pm.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: (under her breath)
dialog: I hope so.
text: She kisses him.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Good night.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Night.
text: She goes inside. Carter lingers for a moment, totally
text: smitten.
scene_heading: INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Tree’s a little surprised to find the room empty. Lori
text: must be out with her “new man”.
dialog: But she left something behind...
scene_heading: THE CUPCAKE.
text: Tree grabs a book of matches sitting on a box of incense.
text: She lights the candle on the cupcake.
dialog: 101.
text: Sitting down on her bed, Tree closes her eyes. Thinking
dialog: of a wish.
dialog: Love? Money? Fame?
text: Doesn’t matter. She’s alive.
text: Tree opens her eyes and blows.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON -- THE WICK
text: As the flame is extinguished by Tree’s breath we are
text: plunged into DARKNESS.
speaker_heading: SLAM CUT:
text: THREE BEATS OF DARKNESS MAKE US THINK OUR STORY HAS ENDED
dialog: BUT...
text: THE TOWER BELL TOLLS THE HOUR...
text: Tree’s eyes flutter open. She’s a little groggy. Pushing
text: herself up, her eyes suddenly fill with an unspeakable
dialog: horror!
scene_heading: INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING
text: Carter is putting something under the couch when he
text: notices Tree sitting up in his bed. He smiles.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You’re up. I wasn’t --
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Carter...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I didn’t think you’d remember my
dialog: name. You were pretty wasted last
dialog: night.
text: Tree’s cell phone plays “Happy Birthday”. She grabs the
text: phone...the caller ID says “DAD”.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: No...this can’t happening! This
dialog: can’t be happening!
text: She jumps out of bed.
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: I killed him!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (alarmed)
dialog: Who? What are you talking about?
text: She pulls her T-shirt off. Carter spins around.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT’D)
dialog: You probably just had a bad dream.
dialog: It happens to me whenever I drink
dialog: too much.
text: But when he turns around, Tree’s already gone. He frowns.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT’D)
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Nice one, dickweed.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CAMPUS - MORNING
text: Tears streaking down her cheeks, Tree runs past
text: everything familiar. Nothing has changed. She’s trapped
dialog: in the same day forever...
scene_heading: INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: We can HEAR the shower running through the bathroom door
text: as a border-line hysterical Tree enters.
text: She immediately begins pulling clothes from her drawer
text: and tossing them on the bed.
text: The water stops as Lori emerges from the bathroom wrapped
text: in a towel.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Oh. She’s finally back.
text: Lori notices the pile of clothes building on Tree’s bed.
speaker_heading: LORI (CONT'D)
dialog: Going somewhere?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Yes! As far away as possible!
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: What’s wrong?
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: What’s wrong?! I’1ll tell you
dialog: what’s wrong! Me! I was wrong! I
dialog: thought if I stopped running I
dialog: could beat it! But it’s never
dialog: going to stop! So I’ll run! I’1l
dialog: run to the end of the god-damn
dialog: earth if I have to!
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Tree, you’re freaking me out.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Oh well! That’s me! A freak!
text: Tree yanks the closet open, searching for something.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Tree, look...
text: She turns around. Lori’s holding the cupcake she made for
dialog: Tree.
speaker_heading: LORI (CONT'D)
dialog: Happy Birthday.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Thanks, but I already ate it last
dialog: night--
dialog: Tree freezes. Last night...
text: She turns around to face her roommate -- her eyes locked
text: on the cupcake.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: I died in my sleep.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: You...killed me.
text: Lori slowly sets the cupcake down on Tree’s desk.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: (working it out;
dialog: aloud)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: It was poisoned. But I never ate
dialog: it before.
text: FLASH: We SEE Tree throwing the cupcake in the trash --
text: then dropping it on the floor after the black out.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: So you had to find another way.
dialog: Then Tombs fell right into your
dialog: lap...the perfect scapegoat.
text: FLASH: Tombs is rolled past Lori on a gurney. She follows
text: him with narrowed eyes as a plot is hatched in her mind.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: You had access to him. Did you
dialog: drug him first?
text: FLASH: Lori jams a hypordermic needle in Tombs’ arm.
text: While he’s unconscious, she changes him into “The
text: Killer’s Outfit”. She puts the MASK on his face and sets
text: the HUNTER’S KNIFE at his side. As she slips out of the
text: room, we SEE his wrists are no longer restrained.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: You knew he'd wake up and escape.
dialog: Then they'd just assume he killed
dialog: me.
text: FLASH: Tree’s FIRST DEATH. The masked killer stabs her
text: from behind.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: But it was always you...
dialog: 
text: FLASH: The killer pulls-up his mask REVEALING Lori’s
text: satisfied/hateful expression as she looks down on Tree’s
text: lifeless body in the ditch.
text: BACK TO TREE'S BEDROOM:
text: Lori’s stunned expression yields to a sardonic laugh.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: You’ve totally lost your mind. You
dialog: actually think I’d try to poison
dialog: you with a friggin’ cupcake?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Prove it.
text: Tree nods to the cupcake.
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Have a bite.
text: Lori hesitates. Tree picks it up.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Go ahead...
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: You really are nuts.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Fine. I'll just take it to the
dialog: police. I’m sure they can see what
dialog: your little birthday treat is made
dialog: of.
text: Lori’s expression falls. As Tree turns, Lori grabs Tree
text: by the hair! The cupcake falls on the desk! Lori swings
text: Tree into the wall! Tree hits the ground, dazed.
text: Lori slams the bedroom door shut and locks it. Blocking
text: the door, she looks down on Tree.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: (with venom)
dialog: You stupid little whore.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Why?..
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Oh, I don’t know. Maybe because
dialog: you wouldn't stop sleeping with
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Gregory?
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: But he kept choosing you over me.
dialog: Guess all he really wanted was a
dialog: cheap slut like you. But what I
dialog: want to know is...how did you
dialog: figure it out?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: You’ve killed me before.
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Then I guess I'll just have to do
dialog: it again.
text: Tree runs for the window but Lori tackles her! She flips
text: Tree over. Grabbing her by the hair, Lori begins BASHING
text: her head against the floor.
text: Suddenly, there’s a loud KNOCK at the door...
text: Lori stops for a second and immediately covers Tree's
text: mouth with her hand.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE (0.S.)
dialog: What the hell's going on in there?
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Everything's fine...Tree just
dialog: fell. She’s okay.
text: In her peripheral, Tree SPOTS the up-turned cupcake lying
text: on the desk -- just an arm’s length away...
text: Lori suddenly becomes aware of Tree grabbing the cupcake.
text: With her other hand, Tree PUNCHES Lori in the throat!
dialog: Lori gasps for air!
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Eat it, bitch!
text: And Tree crams the cupcake into Lori’s open mouth!
text: As Lori struggles to spit the cake out, Tree SLUGS her
text: again, knocking Lori off.
text: Tree gets to her feet fast. Lori rises, spitting the last
text: bits out.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Oh, you're dead now...
text: Looking up, Tree spies a built-in BOOKSHELF over the
text: window where Lori is standing.
text: With the last of her strength, Tree JUMPS UP and catches
text: the shelf with both hands then KICKS Lori through the
dialog: window!
dialog: 107.
scene_heading: EXT. KAPPA DELTA HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Glass and wood EXPLODE as Lori sails though the window!
text: Her body bounces off the ledge, before flipping over
dialog: backwards!
text: There’s a skull-crushing THUD as Lori hits the stone
text: walkway two-stories below.
scene_heading: INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Danielle’s door-pounding has intensified with all the
dialog: commotion.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE (0.S.)
dialog: What the hell was that?
scene_heading: ANGLE ON TREE -- BATTERED AND FADING
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: (winded)
dialog: Lori...ate...my birthday cupcake.
text: We can HEAR some of the sorority sister’s SCREAMS outside
text: as Tree’s eyes roll back into her head and she passes out
dialog: cold.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. POTSDAM UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - MORNING
text: It is a beautiful, sunny morning.
text: Half a dozen LOCAL and NATIONAL NEWS VANS parked out
text: front, all covering the story of the day.
scene_heading: INT. INTENSIVE CARE WARD - MORNING
text: Tree wakes up in the hospital bed. Beside her is Carter
dialog: and her dad.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: What... day is it?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Wednesday, you slept all night.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Wednesday? The nineteenth?
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That’s right.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: I made it.
text: She smiles... starts to get up, but can’t.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You're not supposed to move.
dialog: You've been banged up pretty bad.
text: She lets them lower her back down.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT’D)
dialog: Do you remember anything?
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Lori? She’s dead?
text: He shakes his head.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The police know everything. They
dialog: found her journal.
text: She takes Carter’s hand. Then her Dad’s. Tree is
text: grateful. Just then, Dr. Winter appears.
speaker_heading: DR. WINTER
dialog: She needs her rest. You can visit
dialog: her later.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I love you, too.
text: As dad starts off, Carter steals a little kiss, adding:
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You still owe me a date.
text: Tree smiles.
text: They leave. Alone with Dr. Winter: Tree winces.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: Can I get something for the pain?
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: DR. WINTER
dialog: In your condition, I’m afraid
dialog: anything I would prescribe could
dialog: be dangerous. You might need to
dialog: put up with some pain for a day --
dialog: can you do that?
text: Tree smiles.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: I can handle one day. Believe me.
text: Dr. Winter excuses himself.
text: Tree closes her eyes, soaking in the sunlight of this new
text: day, pouring through the window --
text: -- when she’s suddenly aware of a shadow over her.
text: She sees the silhouette of a nurse standing over her.
text: The woman is preparing a syringe.
text: Tree raises her hand to try to get a look at the nurse.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: Excuse me. What are you doing?
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: It’s for the pain.
text: The nurse brings the syringe to the I.V. tube.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: But... the doctor said no.
text: The nurse steps closer...
text: It's Stephanie -- Gregory's wife.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Not your pain, Teresa. Mine. Did
dialog: you think you’d get away with
dialog: screwing my husband?
text: Stephanie empties the syringe in the intravenous.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: You’ve got to be kidding me.
dialog: 110.
text: ..-whispers Tree, even as she begins to convulse...
speaker_heading: SLAM CUT:
speaker_heading: END CREDITS
scene_heading: *ALTERNATE ENDING*
scene_heading: INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING
text: The bell tolls outside. Tree stirs from her slumber. She
text: sits up...notices she’s wearing the same oversized T-
dialog: shirt.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: No...
text: She spies Carter -- bent over, in front of the couch
text: putting something away.
text: Tree’s eyes go wide with shock as her cell phone plays
text: “Happy Birthday”. She grabs it...
scene_heading: CLOSE ON -- THE LCD SCREEN
scene_heading: It says: PRIVATE NUMBER
dialog: Tree: What?
text: Carter turns around, holding his cell phone. He laughs as
text: he snaps it shut. Tree’s cell phone instantly stops
text: ringing as she realizes he was just fucking with her.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: You think that’s funny?!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Hilarious.
text: Grabbing a pillow, Tree takes a swing and misses. Carter
text: tackles Tree onto the bed. Pinning her down, he goes in
dialog: for the kiss...
text: But Tree suddenly pushes him back -- she looks worried.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT’D)
dialog: What’s wrong?
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: TREE
dialog: What if I get stuck in this day?
text: Carter kisses her. It’s passionate but tempered with
text: sweetness. He pulls away. A smiles breaks through Tree’s
dialog: anxiety.
speaker_heading: TREE (CONT'D)
dialog: I guess I could live with that.
text: Tree grabs Carter’s head and pulls him into another kiss.
dialog: Cue love-song that makes teenage girls prematurely
text: ovulate as we PULL AWAY from our lovebirds...
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL BELL TOWER - MORNING
text: The bell rings one last time as the sun rises over the
text: Potsdam University campus -- its incandescent light
