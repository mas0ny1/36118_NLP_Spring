dialog: "Medical journals report only 31 cases in history of people
text: swallowing their toothbrushes. The champion toothbrush

dialog: 1984. The all-time champion swallower of any object swallowed

scene_heading: ECU: A TOOTHBRUSH - CREDITS ROLLING
text: We HEAR a man clearing his throat. He enters and a shiny
text: glob of toothpaste is squeezed onto the bristles.
scene_heading: INT. BOB WILEY'S BATHROOM, MORNING
text: BOB WILEY, thirties, anxious, begins brushing his teeth.
text: Suddenly, in trying to brush a back molar, Bob looses control
text: of the toothbrush and swallows half of it whole. Choking,
text: gasping, he tries to pull the toothbrush out.
scene_heading: EXT. BOB WILEY'S APARTMENT BUILDING, SAME
text: PAN and TILT up from a woman walking her dog on the streets
text: of Manhattan to a third floor apartment window. There is Bob
text: struggling frantically with the toothbrush.
scene_heading: INT. BOB WILEY'S BATHROOM, MORNING
text: Bob is losing the battle, and in three excruciating swallows,
text: like a mouse going down the throat of a snake, the toothbrush
text: disappears down his throat. Bob pounds his chest, swallowing
text: as he does. Then, delicately, he belches. He takes a deep
text: breath, relaxes somewhat, and opens the medicine cabinet.
text: There sit ten packaged toothbrushes. Bob opens one.

scene_heading: EXT. A PARKING LOT, LAKE WINNIPESAUKEE, NEW HAMPSHIRE, DAY.
speaker_heading: AUTUMN
text: Pricey BMW's, MERCEDES, etc. sport license plates which read:
text: FREUD JUNGNRICH HEADDOC PERCA' DAN' etc. Three pre-teens
text: ride by on bikes and shove the trunks of the cars. Car alarms
text: sound off like birds. We PAN WITH THE KIDS then PAST THEM
dialog: out to sea to see:
text: EXT. THE MIDDLE OF THE LAKE, ABOARD A CRIS CRAFT, SAME
text: Four psychiatrists and three spouses are pleasure boating.
text: Here all is quiet except the wind and the sound of the birds

text: an intense doctor in his forties.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR 1 (FEINBERG)
dialog: I've had the same nightmare three
dialog: nights running.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR 2
dialog: Come on, David, we're on a vacation.
speaker_heading: FEINBERG
dialog: I'm leaving my office for summer
dialog: vacation, when suddenly my patients
text: rush up looking insane.
scene_heading: EXT. A PARK AVENUE OFFICE BUILDING, DAY. DREAM-LIKE SLOW
speaker_heading: MOTION
text: Dr. Feinberg exits the building with his suitcase. To his
text: horror an angry horde of men and women, looking like a
text: sadistic lynch mob, swarm him and attack.
speaker_heading: FEINBERG (V.O.)
text: "Don't leave us!" they scream. Then
dialog: they beat me and bite me and kill
dialog: me...!
text: As Feinberg runs to get away he is dragged down then overrun

text: BACK TO THE BOATS
speaker_heading: FEINBERG
dialog: It's the worst nightmare I've had
dialog: since residency. Night after night...
dialog: it's terrifying!
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: At least your nightmare is only a
dialog: dream. What about what happened to
dialog: Leo Marvin?
speaker_heading: A YOUNG DOCTOR
dialog: Who's Leo Marvin?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: You never heard of the famous Dr.
dialog: Marvin?
text: ANGLE ON A VACANT LOT ON SHORE
text: There is a dock, an overgrown slab, and a chimney.
speaker_heading: PHIL (O.S.)
dialog: That used to be his vacation house.
speaker_heading: FEINBERG (O.S.)
dialog: There's nothing there.
text: BACK TO THE BOAT
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Grab a strong drink and some
dialog: Dramamine. I'll tell you a story
dialog: that will send you into Rorschach.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER WIFE
dialog: Who's Leo Marvin?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Well, I really can't tell you about
dialog: Leo Marvin unless I first tell you
dialog: about Bob.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER WIFE
dialog: Who's Bob?
scene_heading: EXT. THE STREETS OF MANHATTAN, UPPER WEST SIDE, DAY
text: The SOUND of BIRDS segues to car alarms. We're on the streets

text: sweltering apartment.
scene_heading: INT. BOB WILEY'S APARTMENT, SAME
text: Bob Wiley sits on his bed in boxer shorts. On his night stand
text: are cardboard plaques: one lists the warning signs of
text: diabetes, another lists cancer's seven warning signals.
text: Stacked by the bed are psychology books and a few bottles of
text: prescription pills. In front of Bob is a vaporizer. Bob holds

dialog: steam.
speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: DOCTOR 4 (V.O.)
dialog: Was he the guy who specialized in
dialog: necrophiliacs?
speaker_heading: PHIL (V.O.)
dialog: No!
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: If you must.
scene_heading: INT. A PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE, DAY
text: The striking thing about DR. LEO MARVIN's office is order
text: and neatness. As Marvin talks on the phone, he unconsciously
text: adjusts the already meticulously placed gewgaws on his desk.
text: Marvin is mid-forties, authoritative, stiff, perfectly
text: manicured. Adorning the office are diplomas, personal
text: mementos, primitive masks, Mondrian-like paintings, his framed
text: medical school grades, a bust of Freud, and diplomas. On his
text: desk is a book titled Baby Steps TM with Marvin's picture on
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Of course I want to publicize the
dialog: book, Hugo and it's a wonderful
dialog: opportunity, but its my vacation.
dialog: The Today Show went to Dr. Ruth's
dialog: vacation house, why can't CBS Morning
dialog: come to Lake Winnipesaukee?... Would
dialog: you work on it?... Thank you Hugo. I
dialog: appreciate it.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY'S VOICE
speaker_heading: (OVER INTERCOM)
dialog: Dr. Marvin, there's a Dr. Carswell
dialog: Fensterwald calling. He says you
dialog: went to school together.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: (wracking his memory)
dialog: Fensterwald. Carswell Fensterwald.
dialog: It sounds familiar but... They sure
dialog: come out of the woodwork when you
dialog: get famous, Clair. Put him through.
speaker_heading: FENSTERWALD
speaker_heading: (ON SPEAKER PHONE)
dialog: Leo?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
scene_heading: (INTO SPEAKER PHONE)
dialog: Carswell?
scene_heading: INT. ANOTHER PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE, SAME
text: Carswell Fensterwald looks unstable. As he talks on his phone,
text: he is boxing up his office. Prominent on his desk is a copy
text: of Marvin's book. The conversation INTERCUTS.
speaker_heading: FENSTERWALD
dialog: Long time no see, huh? You have a
dialog: big book out. Things are clicking,
dialog: huh?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: That's the way I planned it.
speaker_heading: FENSTERWALD
dialog: Listen, Leo, I'm closing my practice.
dialog: Most of my patients are on the West
dialog: Side but I have one case I'd like to
dialog: refer you.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Carswell, thanks but --
speaker_heading: FENSTERWALD
dialog: I know, you're incredibly busy.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Swamped. I've raised my rate. I might
dialog: even cut my sessions to forty
dialog: minutes...
speaker_heading: FENSTERWALD
dialog: Leo, I know you don't like flattery
dialog: but if anybody I know is going to
dialog: win a Nobel Prize, it's you. You
dialog: gotta be thinking about your next
dialog: book so I know you'll find this case
dialog: particularly interesting.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: What sort of case is it, Carswell?
text: Marvin paces. He adjusts a diploma down, then up, then down.
speaker_heading: FENSTERWALD
dialog: Actually, Leo, I don't know.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Carswell, if this is a dysfunctional --
speaker_heading: FENSTERWALD
dialog: No no, nothing like that. He keeps
dialog: his appointments. Pays on time. See
dialog: him once. If he's not the most complex
dialog: and -- persistent -- case you've
dialog: ever seen, drop him. His name's Bob
dialog: Wiley. He needs someone brilliant.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Okay. I'll work him in for an
dialog: interview. Say, Carswell, how come
dialog: you're quitting the business?
speaker_heading: FENSTERWALD
dialog: We're a dying breed, Leo. Good luck.
text: Fensterwald hangs up. He lets out a silent jubilant howl of
text: gleeful laughter.
speaker_heading: FENSTERWALD
dialog: I feel good. I feel great. I feel
dialog: wonderful!
scene_heading: ANGLE IN MARVIN'S OFFICE
text: Marvin slowly hangs up his speaker phone.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Carswell Fensterwald...?
text: Again he racks his brains. He presses his intercom.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
speaker_heading: (INTO INTERCOM)
dialog: Claire, if I get a call from a Bob
dialog: Wiley, schedule him for a short
dialog: interview after vacation.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY (CLAIRE)
dialog: He's already called, Dr. Marvin.
dialog: Twice. He's coming in this afternoon.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: That's one kind of persistence.
dialog: Carswell Fensterwald...?
text: Marvin gives up. He picks up a copy of his book. He compares
text: his jacket photo with his reflection in the handle of his
dialog: letter opener.
scene_heading: EXT. ABOARD THE CRIS CRAFT BOAT, DAY
text: The shrinks are still listening to Doctor 3.
speaker_heading: FEINBERG
dialog: Leo Marvin. Now I remember. An
dialog: incredible asshole.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR 2
dialog: Had that stupid best seller, what
dialog: was the name of it?
speaker_heading: FEINBERG
dialog: Watching grass grow was more exciting
dialog: than Leo Marvin.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: All that changed.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR 2 (V.O.)
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: PHIL (V.O.)
dialog: That's what I'm trying to tell you
dialog: lummoxes: Bob.
scene_heading: INT. BOB'S APARTMENT, DAY
text: Bob is sitting by the steam repeating his mantra.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I feel good. I feel great. I feel
dialog: wonderful! I feel good, I feel great!
dialog: I feel --
text: Bob picks up the phone and frantically pushes buttons.
speaker_heading: BOB
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Hello, Claire, Bob again. Are you
dialog: sure Dr. Marvin doesn't have an
dialog: earlier cancellation?... Sorry. See
dialog: you at two, sharp.
text: Bob hangs up, finds a blood pressure gauge and takes his
text: blood pressure. That done, he stands, paces, then stops and
text: sprinkles food into a gold fish bowl.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Morning, Gil.
text: GIL the GOLDFISH nibbles the food. Bob sits on his bed, takes
text: a deep breath, then dials the phone. As he waits for an
text: answer, he flips through his "organizer" which is crammed
dialog: with notes and papers.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY'S VOICE
speaker_heading: (ON PHONE)
dialog: Overton.
speaker_heading: BOB
speaker_heading: (INTO HEADSET)
dialog: This is Bob Wiley calling...
dialog: (checks in his notebook)
dialog: Mrs. Patricia Lions please.
text: Bob waits a beat, still looking through the notebook.
speaker_heading: MRS. LIONS
speaker_heading: (ON PHONE)
dialog: Lions.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Mrs. Lions, I'm Bob Wiley. I represent
dialog: the Manhattan Dental Hygiene
dialog: Association. I can offer you a forty
dialog: percent discount on our toothpicks
dialog: plus a very attractive selection of
dialog: toothpick holders if...
speaker_heading: MRS. LIONS
dialog: Mr. Wiley --
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Bob.
speaker_heading: MRS. LIONS
dialog: Bob, this is an elementary school.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Elementary school?
dialog: (checks his notebook)
dialog: I thought you were Overton Cafeteria?
speaker_heading: MRS. LIONS
speaker_heading: (ON PHONE)
dialog: No, we're a school and we don't need
text: toothpicks.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I don't know. A young tooth is a
dialog: terrible thing to waste. I should
dialog: know. When I was that age nobody
dialog: gave a hoot about my teeth and now
dialog: they're terrible! Have you checked
dialog: out flavored floss?
speaker_heading: MRS. LIONS
dialog: Flavored floss?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: All you have to do is dream pink
dialog: gums, Patsy, and we can make them
dialog: happen. Give me your address and
dialog: I'll send you our flossing catalogue.
text: As Bob begins to write on his notebook, he flashes a "V" for
dialog: victory at Gil.
scene_heading: INT. BOB'S APARTMENT, LATER
text: Bob is now dressed to go out. A clock reads 1:45pm. Bob is
text: pacing at the door. He stops, glances at the clock, faces
text: the door, opens it, closes it. He paces, opens the door,
text: takes some deep breaths, twists his cheeks, then like a man
text: jumping into cold water, bolts out.
scene_heading: INT. THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE BOB'S APARTMENT, SAME
text: Bob exits his apartment, uses a Kleenex to close the door,
text: then heads down the stairs.
scene_heading: EXT. THE DOORWAY TO BOB'S APARTMENT BUILDING, DAY
text: Sweat pouring off his brow, Bob stands in sunglasses in the
text: entrance-way to his apartment. A bus squeals up to the curb,
text: belches smoke, then moves on. A garbage can is kicked over.
text: Bob starts to take a step when suddenly he gets dizzy. He
text: steps back and hyperventilates. Bob puts on a dust mask,
text: steps bravely onto the sidewalk, and walks, eyes fixed
dialog: forward.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I feel good, I feel great, I feel
dialog: wonderful.
dialog: (repeats)
text: A man passes Bob, eyes fixed forward.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Son of a bitch, dirty bastard, I'll
dialog: get you!
dialog: (repeats)
scene_heading: EXT. THE STREETS OF MANHATTAN, DAY. LONG SHOT
text: Bob walks through the city like a zombie, eyes fixed forward.
scene_heading: INT. AN OFFICE BUILDING LOBBY, MANHATTAN, SAME
text: Passers-by shuffle to and fro. Bob, still in sunglasses and
text: dust mask, enters. He walks in a straight line to the building
dialog: directory. He finds:
dialog: "Dr. Leo Marvin, A Psychiatric Corporation, suite 4616."
speaker_heading: DOORMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Help you?
text: This startles Bob but he recovers.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'm going to see Dr. Leo Marvin.
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
text: Second elevator. 46th floor.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Elevator. Thanks.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON THE ELEVATORS
text: Bob removes a Kleenex from a pack in his pocket, uses it to
text: push the elevator button, then paces nervously. The elevator
text: arrives and the door opens. The elevator is filling up with
text: passengers. Bob doesn't move.
scene_heading: INT. A STEEL AND CONCRETE STAIRWELL, SAME
text: We see a descending steel staircase and stairwell door marked
text: "Floor 40". We hear footsteps -- rhythmic and determined --
text: getting closer and closer.
speaker_heading: BOB (O.S.)
dialog: I feel good, I feel great, I feel
dialog: wonderful.
dialog: (repeats over and
dialog: over)
scene_heading: INT. DR. MARVIN'S RECEPTION ROOM, DAY
text: Clair sits behind her desk reading a book. Bob enters, red-
text: faced and out of breath, taking his pulse.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Hi... I'm... Bob...
scene_heading: INT. DR. MARVIN'S OFFICE, DAY
text: Dr. Marvin is at his desk. Claire shows in Bob.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Dr. Marvin. Bob Wiley. Thank you for
dialog: working me in.
text: Claire exits. Bob looks around then notices a framed photo
text: on Marvin's shelf. Using his Kleenex, Bob picks it up. He
dialog: smiles.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Your family?
dialog: (Marvin nods)
dialog: Wait, let me guess. I'm good at this.
dialog: Harriet, Kenny, Gretchen, Rita. Wait
dialog: wait, I know I'm close. Susan, Steven,
dialog: Andrea, Rita. Wait --
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: (emotionless)
dialog: My wife, Fay. My son, Sigmund. My
dialog: daughter, Anna. My sister, Lily.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Lily... I was close! What a wonderful
dialog: family!
text: Bob puts the photo back on the shelf. Marvin adjusts it.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Do I call you Dr. Marvin or Leo?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Whichever you prefer. Have a seat.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Call me Bob.
text: Bob stares at the chair. There is a box of Kleenexes on the
text: arm. Bob reaches in his pocket, takes out a Kleenex, and
text: uses it to move the box of Kleenexes to the table. He then
text: sits. Marvin walks to Bob and holds out a trash can. Bob
text: drops in the used Kleenex.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Thank you.
text: Marvin puts the trash can next to Bob's chair then sits. He
text: stares at Bob. He's waiting.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I guess I'm on, huh?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Well, the simplest way to put it is,
dialog: I have problems. I worry er, about
dialog: diseases. I have trouble with
dialog: toothbrushes. And I, er, I have
dialog: problems moving.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Talk about moving.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: As long as I'm in my apartment, I'm
dialog: okay. I have a phone job -- selling
dialog: dental supplies -- and that's fine.
dialog: But when I have to go out, I get...,
dialog: weird.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Talk about weird.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I get dizzy spells. Nausea. Cold
text: sweats. Hot sweats. Fever blisters.
dialog: Difficulty swallowing. Difficulty
text: breathing. Blurred vision. Involuntary
text: trembling. Dead hands. Weak ankles.
text: Twitching. Fainting spells. Numb
dialog: lips.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Do you think that's normal?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: That depends.
text: Suddenly Bob removes an air sickness bag from his pocket. He
text: opens it and pauses a long time as though he were about to
text: vomit into it. He doesn't. He puts the air sickness bag away.
text: Marvin leans in. Bob does too.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: You do go out, you know.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I do?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: You came here.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You're right!
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: What are you afraid of?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well. What if I break my neck and
dialog: become paraplegic? What if my heart
dialog: stops beating, or I can't find a
dialog: bathroom and my bladder explodes?
dialog: You ever heard of Tourette's Syndrome.
dialog: You know, where you involuntarily
dialog: shout profanity?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: That's exceptionally rare.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I have a neighbor who got it. Yells
text: "oh shit!" in church. "Douche bag!"
dialog: at customers at his job. Pretty funny,
dialog: actually, unless you're the one with
dialog: the disease. Then it's sad.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: OH SHIT EATING SON OF A BITCH! Just
dialog: kidding.
dialog: (pause)
text: TWAT LOVING DOUCHE BAG!
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Why are you doing this?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Sometimes, if I fake it, I know I
dialog: don't have it. Like, when I think my
dialog: heart is gonna stop. I fake it so I
dialog: know it's not happening.
text: Bob fakes a heart seizure -- very convincingly -- and falls
text: to the floor. After a moment, he sits back in the chair as
dialog: if nothing had happened.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: If I can't make it happen, I know
dialog: it's not happening. I know it's all
dialog: in my mind.
text: Marvin stands and walks towards Bob.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Get away from me with that knife!
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: See?
text: Marvin uprights the trashcan and walks back to his seat.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Are you married?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Divorced, actually.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Want to talk about it?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: The world is divided into two types
dialog: of people: those who like Neil Diamond
dialog: and those who don't. My ex-wife loves
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Um.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Dr. Marvin, do you think you can
dialog: help me?
text: There is a pause. Marvin leans in.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: There's a saying, Bob, that the best
dialog: psychiatrist in the world is right
dialog: inside of you. I can help you,
dialog: provided you're willing to help
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Are you kidding, I'll do anything!
text: Marvin stands and moves to the bookcase behind him.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: There's a ground breaking book that
dialog: just came out, Bob. Not everything
dialog: in it applies to you but when you
dialog: see the title, I think you'll see
dialog: that it can help.
text: There are twenty copies of Marvin's book on the shelf behind
text: Marvin. Marvin holds one up. Bob sees the cover. We see the
text: picture of Marvin on the back.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Baby Steps.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: It means setting small, reasonable
dialog: goals for yourself. One day at a
dialog: time, one tiny step at a time -- do-
dialog: able, accomplishable goals.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Baby steps.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: When you leave this office, don't
dialog: think about everything you have to
dialog: do to get out of the building, just
dialog: deal with getting out of the room.
dialog: When you reach the hall, just deal
dialog: with the hall. And so forth. Baby
dialog: steps.
text: Bob looks at Marvin then stands.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Baby step... through the office.
text: Bob takes small deliberate steps to the door. He opens it
text: and steps into the reception area.
speaker_heading: BOB (O.S.)
text: Baby step... out the door.
text: The door to the office closes. There is a long pause. Bob
text: opens the door and pops back in.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: It works!
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: All I have to do is take one small
dialog: step at a time and I can do anything!
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Exactly. But don't expect everything
text: all at once. Even a baby occasionally
text: falls and hits his head.
text: Bob walks around the room as though he were inhabiting each
text: small space with his body.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Baby step around the office. Baby
dialog: step around the office!
dialog: (to Marvin's family
dialog: photo)
dialog: Fay, Sigmund, Anna, Lily: Hi fam!
dialog: He's a genius!
text: Marvin hands Bob the book.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: This will give you plenty to digest
dialog: while I'm on vacation.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Vacation?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Certainly my secretary told you. As
dialog: of this afternoon, I'm on vacation
dialog: with my family until Labor Day.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: That's a whole month! What if I need
dialog: you? What if I need to talk?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Dr. Harmon, my associate will be
dialog: happy to talk.
text: He hands Bob Harmon's card.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: We have years ahead of us, Bob. A
dialog: month will seem like a baby second.
text: Marvin shows Bob the door. Bob, doing his baby steps, looks
text: lost and confused.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Can I call you in the Hamptons if I
dialog: need you?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Dr. Harmon is quite skilled.
text: Bob shuffles to the door.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I hear Maine is great this time of
dialog: year.
text: Marvin turns over his book and shows Bob his picture.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I'll be with you the whole month.
dialog: Try your baby steps.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Let's see... Baby step through the
text: office. Baby step out the door.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: That's perfect. Keep going...
speaker_heading: BOB (O.S.)
text: Baby steps to the hall. Baby...
text: Marvin closes the door and starts back to his desk.
text: Momentarily, Bob sticks his head back in.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: It's the Catskills, isn't it?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Bob...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Sorry. Baby steps. Baby steps...
text: Bob exits, closing the door. Marvin starts to pick up Bob's
text: trash can when Bob sticks his head in again.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You flying or driving?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Bob.
dialog: (firmly re-assuring)
dialog: I'll be back.
text: Bob looks at Marvin then starts out.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Baby steps, he'll be back. Baby steps,
dialog: he'll be back...
text: Bob closes the door behind him. From his desk Marvin takes a
text: plastic trash bag and dumps the contents of Bob's trash can
text: into it. He picks up a small tape recorder and presses
dialog: "record".
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: July 31, Bob Wiley, introductory
dialog: interview. Multi-phobic personality
dialog: characterized by an extreme need for
dialog: family connections. Bill $150 for
dialog: the session and $29.95 for the book.
text: He clicks the tape recorder off. There is a knock on the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Bob...
text: Claire puts her head in.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: It's your publicist. He says CBS
dialog: will come to Winnipesaukee.
text: Marvin strides triumphantly to the phone and lifts it up.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: I knew they'd come to me! Hugo, not
dialog: to change the subject but has a
dialog: psychiatrist ever won the Nobel Prize?
scene_heading: INT. THE HALLWAY OF MARVIN'S OFFICE BUILDING, SAME
text: Bob paces in front of the elevators, reading the book.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Baby step to the elevator. Baby step
text: to the elevator.
text: The elevator, full of passengers, opens. Bob, steps in.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Baby step to the elevator. Baby step
text: to the elevator.
text: The elevator doors close and it starts down. Bob screams.
scene_heading: EXT. THE NEW YORK MARINE AIR TERMINAL, DAY
dialog: Marvin and family (who we recognize from the pictures in
text: Marvin's office) exit a cab with their luggage and head into
dialog: the terminal.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Hurry hurry hurry. Hurry hurry hurry.
dialog: Hurry hurry hurry.
text: They pass a HOMELESS MAN with a hand out. Marvin's wife FAY
text: stops and roots in her purse.
speaker_heading: MARVIN

speaker_heading: BOB

scene_heading: EXT. ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE PARKING LOT, SAME
text: Marvin stops and faces Bob.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I think you know, Bob, that your
dialog: behavior is entirely inappropriate.
dialog: We talked about trust. We talked
dialog: about my needs. I want you to get on
text: a bus and go back to New York.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You're angry.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I don't get angry.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You're upset.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I don't get upset.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Then can't we just talk?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I don't see patients on vacation,
dialog: Bob. Ever. How many ways can I make
dialog: that clear?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: But you can't just send me away!
dialog: I've read your book, I've been doing
dialog: what you told me, but I've completely
dialog: relapsed! A little time would mean
dialog: so much. Please.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Bob, I'm driving away now and I don't
dialog: want you to bother me again. You
dialog: came for my advice, correct?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Absolutely.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Then take my advice and go back to
dialog: New York.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: But I can't go anywhere! I'm all
dialog: locked up!
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: You got yourself here.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Barely!
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Getting back will therapeutic.
text: Bob starts begging.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Please just talk to me. Just a little
dialog: talk.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: You're testing my patience, Bob.
speaker_heading: BOB
text: A teeny tiny talk. An itty bitty
dialog: talk...
text: ANGLE FROM INSIDE THE CAR, WHAT THE FAMILY SEES
text: Bob is kneeling in front of Marvin.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Pretty please... Pretty please with
dialog: sugar...
text: The family exchanges quizzical looks.
text: BACK TO BOB AND MARVIN
text: Marvin looks around, incredibly embarrassed. He tugs at the
text: kneeling Bob.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: (gritted teeth)
dialog: Get up. Come on, get up.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (standing)
dialog: Say you will. Please, say you will.
text: Marvin looks at his watch.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Bob, it's two o'clock. Go to the bus
dialog: station, buy a ticket home, then
dialog: wait in that restaurant.
text: He points to "GUTTMAN'S" coffee shop.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You'll meet me?!
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I'll call you.
dialog: (looks at his watch)
dialog: In two hours.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Oh my god, you're the greatest!
text: Bob moves to hug Marvin and Marvin reluctantly lets him.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: But you must buy your ticket and
dialog: give your word that you'll go home.
dialog: This is all about trust again, Bob.
dialog: We must have trust.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I trust. I absolutely trust. I'll go
dialog: buy my ticket. Right now!
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I'll call you at four.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You couldn't possibly make it three
dialog: thirty, could you?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Bob...
speaker_heading: BOB
text: Four it is. Four o'clock exactly.
dialog: Thank you, Dr. M.
text: Bob starts across the parking lot as Marvin gets in the car
text: and closes the door.
scene_heading: INT. THE MARVIN FAMILY STATION WAGON, SAME
text: As the car pulls out of the parking lot, Marvin's family
text: turns to look at Bob. Bob smiles and waves at the family.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Leo, you look disturbed.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Who was that poor man?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Nobody.

speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: He's cute.

scene_heading: INT. GUTTMAN'S COFFEE SHOP, LATER

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Baby step to four o'clock. Baby step
dialog: to four o'clock.
text: Bob covers his eyes then looks at the clock. No luck.
text: Frustrated, Bob paces again.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I feel good, I feel great, I feel
dialog: four o'clock!
text: Again he looks at the clock: three-o-one. The elderly couple
text: watch. They speak with thick European accents.
speaker_heading: ELDERLY WOMAN (MRS. GUTTMAN)
dialog: Sonny, your fishy's losing air.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: ELDERLY MAN (MR. GUTTMAN)
dialog: Your guppy.
text: Bob looks at Gil. The baggie is dripping.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Oh. Thanks.
text: Bob looks for something to do about the dripping baggie. Mr.
text: Guttman brings a glass and dumps Gil in.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: MR. GUTTMAN
dialog: Is there something we can help you
dialog: with?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Can you make it four o'clock? Dr.
dialog: Marvin's supposed to call me then
dialog: but I'm going crazy.
speaker_heading: MRS. GUTTMAN
dialog: Not Dr. Leo Marvin?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Do you know him?
speaker_heading: MRS. GUTTMAN
dialog: He bought our dream house. We worked
dialog: a lifetime, saved up for a down
text: payment, then he swooped down with
dialog: his fancy schmancy lawyers and grabbed
dialog: it out from under us.
speaker_heading: MR. GUTTMAN
dialog: Stay as far away from him as possible.
speaker_heading: MRS. GUTTMAN
dialog: Like the plague.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: No problem. I'm his patient but he
dialog: doesn't want me near him.
speaker_heading: MR. GUTTMAN
dialog: We'll show you where he lives.
scene_heading: EXT. THE MARVIN SUMMER HOUSE, SAME
text: Marvin and Siggy march to the end of the Marvin dock. There
text: is a diving board. Siggy stands in a black terry robe and
text: flip flops.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Take off your robe. Everything you
dialog: wear is black. I wish you'd get off
dialog: this death fixation.
text: Siggy reluctantly takes off his black robe. Under it he wears
text: a black t-shirt and black bathing suit.
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: How do you know it's a death fixation?
dialog: Maybe I'm in mourning for my lost
dialog: childhood.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: What do you mean by that?
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: What do you mean by asking?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Come on, get on the board and let's
dialog: see your approach.
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: (striking a pose)
dialog: My approach is to be suave and
text: debonair and sophisticated.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Come on, Siggy. 1, 2, 3 spring. Like
dialog: we learned last time. 1, 2, 3, spring.
text: Siggy reluctantly mounts the board. He stands, feet together,
text: then takes a step with his right foot.
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: 1, 2, 3 spring. 1, 2, 3 summer. 1,
dialog: 2, 3 fall. Time to go dad.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Cut it out, Siggy. Left foot...
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: This is no fun.
text: Siggy sighs then starts again. He awkwardly takes two steps
text: then stops at the end of the board, staring into the water,
dialog: afraid to dive.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Why didn't you dive?
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: With all the horror that's going on
dialog: in the world, what difference does
dialog: it make?
scene_heading: INT. MARVIN SUMMER HOUSE, SAME
text: The decor is New England cottage-y with a strong dose of Leo
text: Marvin: incredibly ordered. On a pedestal is a bust of Sigmund
text: Freud. On the mantle sit the family puppets: -- Anna, Siggy,
text: Fay, and Leo. Anna is at the family stereo, selecting a CD.
text: Fay is on the chordless phone at the kitchen window, giving
text: milk to some stray cats.
speaker_heading: FAY
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Of course I'm excited Ellie. The
dialog: last person they interviewed on
dialog: vacation was Dr Ruth.
text: Siggy enters and walks upstairs. Marvin enters and heads to
text: the living room chair. Fay hangs up.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: He didn't dive.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: He's a little afraid of it, dear.
dialog: Have patience.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: It's not like I'm making him jump
dialog: out of an airplane. When I was growing
dialog: up, I thought diving was fun.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I thought you were born grown up.
text: Marvin stares at Anna. She puts on raucous heavy metal.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: You're masking hostility, Anna Marvin.
dialog: Turn that down.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: It's full of Freudian symbols, dad.
dialog: It's educational.
text: Marvin turns down the volume, sits in his big easy chair,
text: then takes a deep breath. He picks up Freud's Understanding
text: Dreams. Anna puts on headphones and dances around wildly.
text: Marvin tries to read. Suddenly a face appears in the window.
text: It is Bob. He sees Marvin and taps on the window. Marvin
text: looks up and sees Bob.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: What the...?
text: (he bolts to the front
dialog: door)
dialog: What are you doing here?
text: Bob stands holding Gil (in the glass) and his bag.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'm sorry. Don't be mad. The Guttmans
dialog: brought me.
text: Bob turns and waves at the Guttmans who are walking into an
text: OLD TRAILER that occupies next lot.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Thank you Mr. and Mrs. G.!
speaker_heading: MRS. GUTTMAN
dialog: Your welcome, Bobby, Hello, Dr.
dialog: Marvin!
text: The Guttmans wave. Marvin waves back.
speaker_heading: MRS. GUTTMAN
dialog: Burn in hell, Dr. Marvin!
text: Marvin's hand falls. The Guttmans enter their trailer. Marvin
text: turns to Bob.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: We agreed that I would call you.
dialog: Your coming here is unbelievably
dialog: inappropriate.
text: Anna comes to the door.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Hi. I'm Anna.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I saw your picture. I'm Bob.
text: Fay comes to the door.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Hi. I'm Bob.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: I'm Fay.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Oh, Mrs. M. You're even prettier
dialog: than your picture.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Why thank you.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: (through his teeth)
dialog: Bob, I think you and I have some
dialog: things to talk about.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You do? You finally think so too?!
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: (to Fay)
dialog: Would you excuse us, dear?
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Bob, may I take your fish?
text: Bob hands Gil to Fay and she walks into the kitchen. Anna
text: just stands there.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Anna.
text: Anna rolls her eyes and follows her mother.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Nice to meet you, Bob.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You too.
text: Marvin leads Bob away. Bob sees the puppets on the mantle.
scene_heading: INT. THE MARVIN HOUSE STUDY, SAME
text: Bob and Marvin enter the downstairs study. Marvin indicates
dialog: for Bob to take a seat.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Great place. No wonder the Guttmans
dialog: wanted it. I really feel bad about
dialog: barging in like this.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Forget it. I understand.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You do?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Of course I do. Your problems don't
dialog: go away just because I go on vacation.
dialog: They've been with you a long time
dialog: after all.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Ever since I can remember.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: On the other hand, you're making
dialog: strides. You got here.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I baby stepped. I owe it to you.
text: Bob smiles. Marvin stares at Bob for a long time then:
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Bob, take a look around you. What
dialog: does everything you see have in
dialog: common?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Er... I don't know... It's all owned
dialog: by you, that's obvious. Humm...
dialog: Everything's from a garage sale!
text: There is a long pause. Marvin stares at Bob.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Vacation, Bob. Everything you see is
dialog: part of a vacation. Every year, for
dialog: one month, I bring my family to this
dialog: house on vacation. Nice, isn't it?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: It's wonderful. The lake. The trees.
dialog: The little town.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Do you know what the point of a
dialog: vacation is? Do you understand the
dialog: meaning of the word?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: You forget about your troubles. You
dialog: give up your worries. You drink from
dialog: the wellspring of relaxation that
dialog: enriches your soul.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Now I can't, at this time, give you
dialog: the kind of therapeutic attention
dialog: that you need to solve all your
dialog: problems. Know why?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Er, because you're on vacation?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Excellent. But what I can do -- and
dialog: only I can do this because you trust
dialog: me don't you Bob?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Why else would I be here?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Exactly. What I can do is this.
text: Marvin goes to a drawer and pulls out a prescription pad. He
dialog: writes.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Get on your bus and go back to New
dialog: York. Every time a problem comes up,
dialog: follow this prescription.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (holds up his bag)
dialog: I don't need pills. I have plenty of
dialog: pills.
text: Marvin tears off a prescription sheet and hands it to bob.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: It's not pills. Read it.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (taking it)
dialog: It says: "A vacation from my
dialog: problems."
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I'm giving you permission to take a
dialog: vacation, Bob. Not a vacation from
dialog: your work. Not a vacation from your
dialog: daily life. But a vacation from...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: My problems.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Every time you feel a problem coming
dialog: on, take that out and follow it to
text: the letter. Doctors orders.
speaker_heading: BOB
text: Doctors orders.
text: Marvin stands.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I'm glad you came. I'll see you in
dialog: my office next month.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: That's it?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: You came here for relief, Bob. Read
dialog: your prescription.
text: Bob stands a moment, looking at his prescription.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: This is... INCREDIBLE! This is
text: ASTOUNDING!! For the first time since
dialog: Menningers I feel free! I knew coming
dialog: up here was the right thing to do!
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: It feels right because you're here
dialog: and because you're leaving.
text: Bob comes over and hugs Marvin.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You've given me a great gift, doctor.
dialog: The gift of life. You're a great
dialog: man.
scene_heading: EXT.-INT. THE MARVIN HOUSE, DAY

speaker_heading: MARVIN

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Have a great vacation!
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: You too.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: A vacation from my problems. You bet
dialog: I will!
text: Bob exits. Marvin closes the door and looks up at the ceiling.
text: He takes a deep breath then turns back into the room. There
text: is a knock at the door.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
speaker_heading: (AT THE DOOR)
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: BOB
speaker_heading: (FROM WITHOUT)
dialog: It's Bob. I forgot Gil.
text: Marvin opens the door.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: My fish.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Oh. Right.
text: Bob strides into the kitchen and takes his fish. Sigmund,
text: now in his clothes, enters from upstairs.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You must be Sigmund.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
text: Siggy, this is Bob. He's just leaving.
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Hi. This is Gil. My fish.
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: Cool. Did you get him out of the
dialog: lake?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: No. He's a city fish.
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: Cool.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Your father is the most incredible
dialog: psychiatrist in the world! You better
dialog: appreciate him.
text: He strides to the door then turns wistfully.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Have a great vacation, fam.
speaker_heading: MARVIN

dialog: we now in a Becket play? Finally:
speaker_heading: MARVIN
text: It's too close to the wall.
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: Who cares?
text: Marvin moves to the couch and pulls it out from the wall
text: about three inches.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I care, and you should too. Our house
dialog: is going on national television
dialog: tomorrow. You want your friends to
dialog: think you live in a dump?
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: My friends would respect me for it.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: You know, there's nothing wrong with
dialog: neatness. People joke but it's
dialog: actually a sign of a creative
dialog: intelligence. Right, Fay?
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: In isolated cases, sure.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: What is that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: The room looks wonderful, dear.
text: Fay pecks him on the cheek and walks into the kitchen. Siggy
text: follows. Ditto Anna who starts cooking pancakes.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Seriously, what do you mean by that?
text: He gets no answer from the rest of the family who look at
text: each other and smile.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You're incredibly creative, daddy.
text: Marvin goes back to making minuscule adjustments: adjusting
text: diplomas, etc. At the front door is a knock.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I'll get it. It's probably the van
dialog: with my art.
text: Checking out his "set" as he goes, Marvin opens the door.
dialog: It's Bob.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Good morning! I'll bet you're
dialog: surprised to see me!
scene_heading: MARVIN STANDS DUMFOUNDED
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: When I walked out of here last night
dialog: I said to myself, "Dr. Marvin's
dialog: absolutely right. Take a vacation
dialog: from your problems. Blow em off.
dialog: Just say 'no'." So I did!
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: But... You're back.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: No I'm not.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: You're not?!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Of course not. I'm taking a vacation.
dialog: This isn't an appointment, I'm
dialog: dropping by. I told the Guttmans
dialog: what you said and they found me a
text: cottage nearby.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yeah, the town is packed but I guess
dialog: if you know the right people...
dialog: Anyway, I know we can't work but

text: Marvin is absolutely flabbergasted.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'm a little anxious about being

speaker_heading: SIGGY

speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: MARVIN

speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: That was Bob! I thought you said he
dialog: left town?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I did. I said exactly that.
text: Anna moves to the front door, after Bob. Marvin grabs her

speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: And I don't want you letting him in
dialog: this house.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Daddy, you're hurting me!

speaker_heading: ANNA

speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I don't have a problem.
text: Fay walks in.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Honey, who is that man?
speaker_heading: MARVIN

speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I've never seen him like this.
speaker_heading: FAY

dialog: supportive, okay?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: He should go punch some pillows.
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: Or get shock treatment.

speaker_heading: ANNA

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Wow... so that's the problem! And I

speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Well he's always uptight, even when
text: it doesn't show.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: He is?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Sure. Imagine growing up with a dad
dialog: who sees every stage of growing up
dialog: as a Freudian passage. Did you ever
dialog: have crayons?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Fat or skinny?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Er, skinny, I think.
speaker_heading: ANNA

dialog: Uh oh.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: ANNA
text: Dad saw crayons as phallic symbols.

text: was a personal assault on his manhood.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What'd he do, buy a Porsche?
text: Anna laughs.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I wish! He just kept psychoanalyzing

speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: ANNA

dialog: myself is he really smiling or is he
dialog: just orally fixated? When I smile
dialog: back, I wonder, am I really attracted
text: or just smiling out of some residual
dialog: Cro-Magnon instinct? If I ever
dialog: actually have sex, I'm not sure I'll
dialog: know the difference between an orgasm
dialog: and an anxiety attack!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I have the same problem.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: The kinds of urges other girls act
dialog: on impulsively, I analyze until either
dialog: the urge goes away or --
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Or what?
speaker_heading: ANNA
text: The boy goes away.
dialog: Long pause.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well. It sounds like your dad never
dialog: learned to leave his work at the
dialog: office.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Lot of good it does me!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You'll make some man very happy
dialog: someday.
text: This hangs in the air. Anna looks at Bob.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What are you doing today?
speaker_heading: BOB
text: Buying Kleenex.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Wanna come sailing?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well, I... I, er...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: That's okay. You don't have to.
text: Bob looks at Anna. He sees her attraction to him and it makes
text: him nervous but he doesn't want to reject her. He looks down
text: shyly.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Actually, it's not that I don't want
dialog: to go. It's just that I've never
dialog: been on a boat and I'm not sure I
dialog: can handle it.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: There's nothing to it. George Stark's
dialog: doing the sailing.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Just thinking about gives me hives.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE STARK'S DAY SAILBOAT, DAY. CLOSE ON BOB
text: Standing next to the mast, his hair blowing in the wind.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You're right, this is great! I never
dialog: actually thought I could do this. I
dialog: never thought this could be me!
text: PULL BACK TO REVEAL
text: That Bob, wearing life preservers on his body and legs, is
text: wrapped onto the mast from chest to toe with ropes. Anna,
text: George Stark (from the airport) and a few other kids sit
text: around enjoying the sail.
scene_heading: EXT. THE MARVIN PRIVATE DOCK, DAY
text: Marvin stands at the end of the diving board, holding Siggy
text: by his ankles out over the water. On the shore next door,
text: the Guttmans sit in lounge chairs, fishing.
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: This is child abuse! If you drop me,
dialog: I'll prosecute!
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I am not going to let go until you're
dialog: ready, okay? Trust me and put your
dialog: hands out like I showed you.
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: I'm not ready! Do you hear? I'm not
dialog: ready!!
text: George's sailboat heels by. From it wave Anna and some of
dialog: her friends -- and Bob.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (shouting and waving)
dialog: Hey Doctor M, look at me! I'm sailing!
text: Stunned, Marvin drops Siggy into the water. Siggy does a
text: belly flop then comes up for air, furious.
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: Murderer! Child molester...
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Siggy, it was an accident!
speaker_heading: THE GUTTMANS
dialog: Hitler!
scene_heading: EXT. A PIER NEAR WINNIPESAUKEE TOWN, LATER
text: Marvin walks along the shore towards the pier in time to see
text: Anna and a wobbly Bob disembark George's sailboat.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Anna!
text: Anna sees her father. She says good-bye to George and her
text: friends then walks towards her father. Bob starts towards
dialog: Marvin too.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Did you see me out there?! I'm getting
dialog: better all the time.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I want to see Anna alone.
text: Bob stops. Marvin waits while Anna walks to him.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I thought I told you to stay away
dialog: from Bob Wiley.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No. You just said I couldn't let him
text: in the house.
text: Marvin starts walking away from the sailboating party towards
text: the town green. He puts his arm around Anna so that she has
dialog: to walk with him.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Daddy, where are we going?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Home.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What about the car? I left it at the
dialog: pier.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Leave it. It's been a while since
dialog: I've had a walk with my daughter.
text: Anna looks back at her friends and Bob. She shrugs then turns
text: back to her father. From his pockets Marvin removes the Leo
text: and Anna puppets and hands her "Anna".
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Daddy, not here!
speaker_heading: MARVIN PUPPET
dialog: Anna, I know you think you're old
dialog: enough to know what's best for you
dialog: and I know you're at the age where
dialog: you don't want to listen to your
dialog: father. But as your father, who's
dialog: always loved you, I'm asking you not
dialog: to see Bob Wiley.
text: Anna grabs the Anna puppet and puts it on, defiantly.
speaker_heading: ANNA PUPPET
dialog: I don't understand the problem! Bob's
dialog: a nice guy!
speaker_heading: MARVIN PUPPET
text: Bob Wiley is a patient. He followed
dialog: me here from New York which is
dialog: bizarre. But even if it weren't
dialog: bizarre, my daughter seeing a patient
dialog: that I'm treating is entirely
dialog: inappropriate.
speaker_heading: ANNA PUPPET
dialog: Bob said you're not treating him
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: MARVIN PUPPET
dialog: He's right there!
speaker_heading: ANNA PUPPET
dialog: So if you're not treating him while
dialog: he's here, then he's not a patient
dialog: while he's here, is he? And I have
dialog: the right to see him!
text: She throws the puppet at Marvin then runs to her friends.
speaker_heading: MARVIN PUPPET
dialog: Anna, you're acting out!
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Bob's a perfectly nice guy! He's
text: intense and sensitive and he listens
dialog: which is more than I can say about
dialog: you. Bob!
text: Marvin stands a moment and watches. He is stunned.
speaker_heading: MARVIN PUPPET
dialog: Anna, come back!
text: Anna runs to Bob and takes his arm. They start walking down
text: the shore. Marvin is dumbstruck.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. THE MARVIN HOUSE, LATER
text: Siggy lies on the deck, looking up at the sky through
text: binoculars. Fay is in the kitchen, arranging driftwood. She
text: comes to the back door of the cottage.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Why don't you come in and talk about
dialog: it?
text: Siggy says nothing.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Just because your father dropped you
dialog: in the water doesn't mean you can't
dialog: trust me.
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: You sleep with him. You're his spy.
scene_heading: INT. THE FRONT DOOR OF THE MARVIN HOUSE, SAME
text: Marvin enters, looking absolutely stunned.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Leo, you've upset Siggy.
text: Marvin stares blankly at Fay then shuffles up the stairs.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Leo...?
text: Again Marvin doesn't answer and Fay starts towards him.
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: That's right, go to him! You always
dialog: do.
text: Fay stops, looks at Siggy then goes upstairs after Leo.
scene_heading: EXT. THE DECK, DAY
text: Siggy lies back down and peers through the binoculars. As he
text: does, a grotesque CLOSE UP OF BOB pops into Siggy's field of
text: view. He sits up with a start. Bob and Anna are standing
text: over him.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Hey, Siggy.
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: Oh. Hi, Bob. You scared me.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Sorry. Didn't mean to sneak up on
dialog: you.
text: Siggy lies back down and looks through the binoculars, clearly
text: not interested in being social. Bob looks at Anna. She shakes
dialog: her head.
speaker_heading: ANNA
text: Dad's at it again. I can tell.
dialog: (to Siggy)
dialog: Another vacation that's not a
dialog: vacation, right?
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: What's with him and diving? Maria
dialog: Shriver's not gonna watch me dive!
scene_heading: INT. THE MARVIN HOUSE BEDROOM, SAME
text: Marvin is prostrate on the bed, Marvin puppet still on his
text: hand, staring at the ceiling. Fay enters. She sits down next
text: to Marvin and strokes his hair.
speaker_heading: FAY
text: Leo, Siggy is really upset.
text: Marvin says nothing.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Leo...
text: Marvin looks at his wife.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Fay, I'm a failure.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Our daughter, our only daughter, has
dialog: fallen for a brilliant manipulator
dialog: twice her age.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Leo, for god's sake talk sense.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Anna and Bob!
scene_heading: EXT. THE MARVIN PRIVATE DOCK, SAME
text: Siggy is standing on the diving board, ready for his approach.
text: Bob and Anna watch from the pier. Next door the Guttmans sit
dialog: watching.
speaker_heading: BOB
text: Face a fear and it goes away.
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: Okay. I'm facing it, now what do I
dialog: do?
speaker_heading: BOB
text: Hit it. Fast. While it isn't looking.
text: Siggy takes a deep breath, summons up his courage, and makes
text: his approach. He springs but can't dive.
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: My mind says "yes yes" but my body
text: says "no no". It's hopeless.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: If I'm not hopeless, nothing's
dialog: hopeless...
text: Bob steps onto the board. He "baby steps" out to the end
text: where Siggy is standing.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Let's try something I saw in a pirate
dialog: movie.
scene_heading: INT. THE MARVIN BEDROOM, SAME
text: Marvin is down the hall in the bathroom, dousing his face
text: with water. Fay stands in the bedroom.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: For God's sake, I'm even a failure
dialog: in my own book! Can you believe it?
dialog: In Chapter 2, I wrote that a healthy
dialog: adolescent girl can never have a
dialog: sublimated father complex and my
dialog: daughter has one.
speaker_heading: FAY
text: It's a brief flirtation, honey. Anna's
dialog: perfectly healthy.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Then you're saying the book's wrong?
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Better that than Anna.
text: Marvin washes his face some more then looks up.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Fay, my god!
text: Marvin walks into the room, water dripping off his face,
text: looking like a man who's just seen his own death.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Leo, what? Leo, what is it?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I'm going on national television
dialog: tomorrow -- to promote a fraud!
scene_heading: EXT. THE MARVIN PRIVATE DOCK, SAME
text: Bob is standing near the end of the diving board holding
text: Siggy by the hips. Siggy is hanging over the water, hands
text: and head down, ready to enter the water diving. Anna is
text: watching. So are the Guttmans.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Don't think about boiling oil!
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: I'm not.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Or searing acid!
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: I'm not!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Our Father, we commit this soul to
dialog: the sea.
text: Bob gently releases Siggy. Siggy falls into the water, diving.
text: Anna applauds. So do the Guttmans. Siggy resurfaces and throws
text: a jubilant fist in the air.
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: Yeah!
scene_heading: INT. THE MARVIN BEDROOM, SAME
text: Fay holds Marvin's head in her bosom, stroking him.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I'm doomed!
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: No you're not.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I'll be a laughing stock!
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: No you won't. You've blow this way
dialog: out of proportion, Leo, and you have
dialog: to get control. Now try your
dialog: breathing.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Okay.
dialog: (breathes hard)
dialog: I'm being ridiculous.
dialog: (more breaths)
dialog: You're right.
text: He walks around breathing exaggeratedly.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: It's a brilliant book... Our
dialog: daughter's fine... I'm great.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: That's right.
text: Applause from outside can be heard in the room. Fay goes to
dialog: the window.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Fay, do you remember a Carswell
dialog: Fensterwald?
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: My God, Leo, look at this.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: The name is so familiar but --
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Leo, Siggy's diving!
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: What?
text: Marvin looks out the window. He sees:
scene_heading: EXT. THE MARVIN PRIVATE DOCK, SAME. MARVINS' POV
text: Bob releases Siggy for another perfect dive.
scene_heading: BACK TO MARVIN
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I'll put a stop to this!
text: Marvin storms out of the bedroom.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Leo!
scene_heading: EXT. THE MARVIN DOCK, SAME
text: Siggy stands at the end of the board, more confident now,
text: getting ready to do another dive. Bob holds Siggy again but
text: this time Siggy doesn't need much help if any. Marvin charges
text: down the dock, Fay right behind him.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Enough. Let go of him! That's enough!
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Leo!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Dr. M., watch this!
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: (leaning over to dive)
dialog: Watch, dad!
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Stop diving this instant!
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Dad!
text: Marvin leaps onto the diving board, shaking it. Bob loses
text: his grip and Siggy falls off the board, doing a back buster.
text: Bob falls in too.
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: Ow!
dialog: (daggers at Marvin)
dialog: You bastard!
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Leo! Look at what you're doing! Leo,
dialog: look at yourself!
text: Everybody looks at Marvin, standing alone on the board. He
text: realizes that he's lost all control, something he never does.
text: He looks at the Guttmans.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: What are you staring at? I had every
dialog: right to buy this house!
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (looking in the water)
dialog: Where's Bob? Where's Bob?!
text: Anna and Fay dive into the water. They go under looking for
dialog: Bob.
scene_heading: EXT. THE MARVIN HOUSE DECK, AFTERNOON
text: Bob is off a bit by himself, wringing out his clothes. Fay,
text: Anna and Siggy sit toweling off. Marvin comes out of the
text: house and talks in low tones to his family.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Listen, everybody, I'm not wrong
dialog: often, but when I am, I admit it.
dialog: I'm sorry. I mean it. How can I make
dialog: it up?
text: There is a pause. Anna and Siggy and Fay look at each other.
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: Knocking Bob in the water was awful.
dialog: What if he hadn't known how to swim?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: But he did. I'm not saying I was
dialog: right, but Bob can do a lot of things
dialog: no one thought he could do.
text: Anna, Fay and Siggy are silent.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Look, I said I was wrong now I'd
dialog: like to forget it. I'd like you all
dialog: to accept my apology.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What about Bob?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: What about Bob?!
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Don't you think you should apologize
dialog: to him?
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON BOB
text: at the outdoor shower, rinsing off his clothes. He can't
text: hear the family but he can see they're talking about him and
text: he's giving them his best hang-dog looks.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I will not apologize to Bob.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Because I won't.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Honey, why are you so hostile towards
dialog: the poor man?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Because he's a patient, Fay! Don't
dialog: you get it?
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: He's not a patient, he's a person.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: And a nice one.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: I think we should invite him for
dialog: dinner.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Dinner?!
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Dinner.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Really?!
speaker_heading: FAY
text: The poor fellow's devastated.
text: Fay heads towards Bob. Marvin turns to her. He keeps his
text: voice low to keep from being heard by Bob, but inside he is
text: about to explode.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I don't want Bob for dinner, Fay.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Leo...
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I don't want Bob for dinner, Fay. I
dialog: want to think about my interview.
text: Leo is trying not to explode. Fay hangs in the balance.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Do it, mom. Invite him. You'd be
dialog: making family history. It'd be the
dialog: first major thing you've done on
dialog: your own since I've known you!
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Right is right, Leo Marvin.
text: Fay heads to Bob. Marvin's mouth falls open.
speaker_heading: SIGMUND
dialog: Testing 1, 2, 3. Testing. For the
dialog: next few seconds we will be conducting
dialog: a test of the emergency broadcast
dialog: system:
speaker_heading: MARVIN SIGGY
text: Fay talks to Bob. Anna heads over to him too. Marvin stands
text: speechless, ready to commit hari-kari.
scene_heading: EXT. THE MARVIN HOUSE PATIO, EVENING
text: Dusk has descended over Lake Winnipesaukee. The glow of the
text: moon, the stars, and lights from the other cottages along
text: the lake shore provide peaceful illumination. The Marvin
text: family -- and Bob -- are dining out on their deck overlooking
text: the lake. Marvin sits silent, holding in his anger. Bob,
text: swinging at occasional moths, sits next to Siggy.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Get away. Get away!
speaker_heading: SIGGY
text: Ring around the moon. Rain coming
dialog: soon.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (edgy to Siggy)
dialog: Gee, is that true?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: It's superstitious nonsense.
text: Anna and Fay exit the cottage carrying trays of food.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (to Fay and Anna)
text: That looks scrumptious.
text: Anna smiles and hands the first plate of food to Bob. Marvin
text: sees this and crosses his arms. He shoots a death stare at
text: Anna. She defiantly shoots it right back. Bob sees this
dialog: exchange of looks.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Did I do something?
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: No, Bob. It's fine. Eat up. Leo.
text: Fay looks at Marvin and shakes her head "no".
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (eating)
dialog: Mmmm. Mmmmm. This sure is good. Mmmm.
text: Mmmmm. Mmmmm.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Would you please stop that?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Oh. Sorry, Leo. Would you pass the
dialog: salt?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: And don't call me Leo.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'm sorry. You said in your office
dialog: that I could call you Leo.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: That was in my office. In my home
dialog: you will call me Dr. Marvin.
text: Marvin snaps the salt down next to Bob. Bob looks helplessly
text: at Fay. Fay puts a hand on Bob's arm.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: (low)
text: He's nervous about the interview
dialog: tomorrow. Don't take it personally.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (to Marvin)
dialog: Hey, that's right, I heard about
dialog: your upcoming debut. Congratulations.
text: Marvin nods and eats. Bob throws salt over his shoulder then
dialog: salts his food.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Your book's going to do a lot of
dialog: people a lot of good, Le-- Dr. Marvin.
dialog: I'm walking proof of that.
text: Marvin chokes on the food he's eating. Siggy slaps his dad
text: on the back. Marvin keeps coughing.
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: Dad?
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Sweetheart?
text: Marvin turns red and points to his throat. He falls to the
text: deck on his side. Bob stands.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Don't panic! I know what to do!
text: Bob hurries to Marvin, lies beside him, and administers the
text: Heimlick maneuver. On the second try, Marvin's throat clears.
text: Marvin lies in Bob's arms, coughing.
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: Dad, you okay?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Daddy?!
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Honey?!
text: Marvin says something. Fay leans over him to hear.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Leo, are you okay?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I said..., get him off me!
text: Bob lets go of Marvin. Marvin coughs and crawls away.
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: Bob, you saved him!
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Incredible! Wonderful!
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Thank you!
text: Fay helps Marvin gets to his feet. Suddenly, there is a flash
text: of lightning. Bob jumps. Rain begins to fall. Marvin looks
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: Told you so.
scene_heading: INT. THE MARVIN HOUSE, NIGHT
text: The rain outside is coming down in buckets. Marvin is in the
text: living room, re-straightening the furniture and art ever so
text: meticulously. He adjusts a diploma over the mantle. Anna,
text: Fay, Siggy and Bob are in the kitchen, doing the dishes.
speaker_heading: BOB
speaker_heading: (SINGING)
dialog: "I'm singing in the rain, Just singing
dialog: in the rain, What a glorious feeling,
text: Bob throws his pack of Kleenex into the trash.
speaker_heading: BOB
speaker_heading: (SINGING)
dialog: I'm happy again!
text: Bob retrieves the pack of Kleenex from the trash.
speaker_heading: BOB
speaker_heading: (SINGING)
dialog: "I walk though the kitchen With a
dialog: bowl full of chicken
dialog: (puts the chicken in
dialog: the fridge)
dialog: I'm singing, I'm singing In the rain."
text: Anna and Fay and Siggy start a dance. Marvin enters.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Look, tomorrow morning is very
dialog: important and I'd like to call it a
dialog: night. I don't want to be rude but I
dialog: think it's time for Bob to sing his
dialog: way home.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: (re: the rain)
dialog: Honey, you don't expect Bob to walk
dialog: back in this do you?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Did I say that? I'll drive him.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: The car's still in town, daddy.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You said to leave it, remember? We
dialog: walked home.
text: Marvin seethes then looks darkly at Anna.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
text: The rain's bound to let up. Bob can
dialog: go then.
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: What if it starts up again while
dialog: Bob's on the way?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: (nastily)
dialog: He can borrow my slicker.
scene_heading: INT. THE MARVIN LIVING ROOM, LATE NIGHT
text: Marvin stands staring out the window like he'd like to murder
text: the rain that is still coming down in torrents. Bob is on
text: the couch, sitting alone, wearing Marvin's yellow slicker,
text: looking unwanted. Anna, Siggy and Fay sit quietly, watching
text: Marvin. Bob looks at Fay and shrugs like he's sorry. Fay
text: puts a sympathetic hand on Bob's.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Leo.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Shsh.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Leo...
speaker_heading: MARVIN
text: Quiet. It's letting up.
text: There is a crash of thunder that shakes the rafters. Marvin
text: reaches out and slowly scratches the window, creating a tiny
text: squeaking sound. Fay walks to him.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: (low)
dialog: Leo, we can't make the poor fellow
dialog: sit here all night. Let's let him
dialog: stay over.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Stay over? Honey, Maria Shriver's
dialog: coming in the morning. Maria Shriver!
dialog: You want some guy sleeping on our
dialog: couch when Maria Shriver gets here?
text: He almost laughs at the idea.
speaker_heading: FAY
text: There's an extra bed in Siggy's room.
dialog: Bob, would you like to spend the
dialog: night?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well I... Do you have a dacron pillow?
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: That's a great idea!
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Fay!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Are you sure I'm not imposing?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Of course you are -- !
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: -- aren't. Anna, find an extra set
dialog: of sheets. Siggy, get one of your
text: father's robes for Bob.
text: Fay shoots Marvin a dirty look then exits the room with Anna.
text: Marvin claws the window making a bone chilling squeak.
scene_heading: INT. SIGGY'S ROOM, NIGHT
text: Siggy's room has twin beds arranged head to head against the
text: corner. Bob, wearing one of Marvin's robes, enters. Siggy is
text: hanging up his clothes.
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: Did you find a toothbrush?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yeah.
text: (belches and hits his
dialog: chest)
dialog: Excuse me.
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: You care which bed?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'd prefer facing southeast.
scene_heading: INT. MARVIN'S BEDROOM, SAME
text: Marvin enters in his pj's. Fay is preparing for bed.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Have you seen my new toothbrush?
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: It should be in the bathroom.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Well it should be but it's not!
text: Fay shoots Marvin a dirty look then heads towards the
dialog: bathroom.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Just because you're nervous about
dialog: tomorrow, Leo Marvin, doesn't give
dialog: you the right to get snippy. If you
dialog: can't handle the pressure, postpone
dialog: the interview.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Fay, it's not the interview -- I
dialog: mean I am nervous about it -- but
dialog: that's not what's bugging me. It's...
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Him who? Bob?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: No, Siggy. Yes, Bob! Who else?
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Leo, quiet. He'll hear you.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Why shouldn't he hear me? Don't you
dialog: get it, he's a sick person. A
dialog: multiphobic mess! He faked suicide...

speaker_heading: SIGGY

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Sick. You ever had a bee buzz your

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well... The way I figure it, if it

dialog: be so bad. I mean what if it were
dialog: called "dink"?
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: Dink?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Then it would be fine. We'd say
dialog: "Grandma dinked." "The garbage man

speaker_heading: SIGGY

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Exactly. Then we wouldn't worry

speaker_heading: MARIA

dialog: condition would you like to share
dialog: with us?
text: Marvin looks at Bob. A tiny, sadistic smile comes across his

dialog: New pal? What's wrong with my old
dialog: pal?
text: Tomsky makes a motion of his head. Two big attendants move
text: to either side of Bob.
scene_heading: BIG ATTENDANT 1
dialog: Let us show you to your room.
text: They lead Bob off.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Hey! Don't touch me! I have seizures!
dialog: Dr. M! Dr. M!!
text: They take Bob into a building. Marvin turns to Tomsky.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I really appreciate your helping me
dialog: out on this, Kenneth.
text: Tomsky holds out a form for Marvin to sign. He does.
speaker_heading: TOMSKY
dialog: I can only hold him for twenty four
dialog: hours, Leo. Without staff
dialog: corroboration.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I'm not worried in the least, Kenneth.
dialog: I'm sure your entire staff will
dialog: corroborate. With intensive treatment
dialog: he should be out in about -- fifty
dialog: years.
text: Marvin hands the clipboard back to Tomsky. They shake.
scene_heading: EXT. THE MARVIN HOUSE DRIVEWAY, LATE AFTERNOON
text: The Marvin station wagon pulls into the driveway, radio is

speaker_heading: MARVIN AND TAPE
dialog: "I'll be what I am, solitary man.

scene_heading: INT. THE MARVIN SUMMER HOUSE, SAME
text: Marvin enters singing. Siggy and Anna see him.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Dad, you okay?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: (to "Oklahoma")

dialog: Leo Marvin, he's okay!"
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: Where's Bob?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yeah, dad, where's Bob?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Can't a man enjoy himself on vacation?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Dad -- ?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
text: Bob sends his regrets but he had to
dialog: take a trip.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What kind of trip? I thought you
dialog: were working with him.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I was.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Then why'd he go on a trip?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Why does a man climb a mountain,
dialog: Anna? Because it's there.
text: Marvin turns up the music and dances. Anna and Siggy stand
text: stunned.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: He didn't even say good-bye?
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: He just left?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: It's not like Bob not to say good-
dialog: bye.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: That's why he left, you see. He just
dialog: wasn't himself.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: He'll write.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Dad, if you did something to Bob...
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Anna, what do you take me for?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Everything's fine.
text: Marvin, looking perfectly content, turns off the music, goes
text: to his chair, picks up Freud's Understanding Dreams, the
text: book he's been trying to read since he arrived here. Siggy
text: and Anna stare at him suspiciously. Fay enters carrying the
text: cordless phone.
speaker_heading: FAY
text: Leo, a Dr. Tomsky says it's urgent.
text: Marvin takes the phone and walks into the kitchen. Anna and
text: Siggy look even more suspicious. Momentarily Leo strides out
text: of the kitchen and walks out the front door.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Leo, where are you going?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Out.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Just like that?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Be home by seven, okay?
text: Marvin doesn't answer because he's gone.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Something's rotten in Winnipesaukee.
scene_heading: EXT. THE TOMSKY CONVALESCENT HOME, LATE AFTERNOON

scene_heading: INT. THE TOMSKY CONVALESCENT HOME, SAME

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Wait, I've another one. Who knows
dialog: the difference between Freud and
dialog: Moses?
text: He sees blank, expectant faces, waiting for a punchline.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well if you don't know, I'm going to
dialog: another clinic!
text: All laugh. Tomsky sees Marvin enter and stands.
speaker_heading: TOMSKY
dialog: Excuse me.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: So a psychiatrist and a psychologist

scene_heading: INT. THE TOMSKY CONVALESCENT HOME HALLWAY, SAME
text: Tomsky joins Marvin in the hall. In the other room we see
text: Bob continuing to joke with the staff.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Kenneth, you have been duped by a
dialog: textbook narcissist. A brilliant
dialog: neuropath!
speaker_heading: TOMSKY
dialog: Brilliant enough to dupe my entire
dialog: staff? I doubt that.
text: Tomsky stuffs a paper into Marvin's shirt pocket.
speaker_heading: TOMSKY
dialog: I'm giving you back his admitting
dialog: forms, Leo, to save you any
dialog: embarrassment.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Embarrassment?!
speaker_heading: TOMSKY
dialog: It's perfectly natural for a patient
dialog: to bond with his analyst. It's a
dialog: normal part of therapy. If you want
dialog: to be rid of him, simply take him
dialog: back where you got him and go home.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: That's easy for you to say! He's
dialog: human crazy glue! If it were that
dialog: simple do you think I'd be here?
speaker_heading: TOMSKY
dialog: You should have never let him sleep
dialog: in your pajamas, Leo. His problems
dialog: don't go away just because you want
dialog: them too.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Whose side are you on?!
speaker_heading: TOMSKY
dialog: Relax, Leo.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I'm relaxed!
speaker_heading: TOMSKY
dialog: Take a vacation.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I'm on vacation!!
speaker_heading: TOMSKY
dialog: Are you sure? Maybe you should check
dialog: in here for a few days and get a
dialog: handle on things?
text: Marvin looks at Tomsky, amazed at the implication of this
dialog: statement.
scene_heading: EXT. THE COUNTRYSIDE OF NEW ENGLAND, DAY

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Intensive psychotherapy? -- boy, you
dialog: weren't kidding, were you? I mean
dialog: even Dr. T. didn't think I needed
dialog: that.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Look I have an idea -- how are your
dialog: afternoons? I mean since we're here
dialog: together with nothing else to do,
dialog: what say we work from two to four,
dialog: something like that?
scene_heading: EXT. THE COUNTRY ROAD, SAME
text: The Marvinmobile screeches to a halt and Marvin jumps out.
text: He rushes around the car and opens Bob's door.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Get out! Get out of my car, get out
dialog: of my life, don't ever come back!
text: Marvin drags Bob out of the car and slams the door.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Are you saying you'd prefer mornings?
text: Marvin gets back in and floors it. He speeds off.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What is this, isolation therapy?
text: Bob stands alone on the road.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You're the doctor.
text: Birds chirp and crickets crick. A pick-up truck passes and
text: Bob sticks out his thumb. The pick-up stops.
scene_heading: INT. MARVIN'S CAR, SAME
text: Marvin is about to bust a vessel. Telephone poles shoot by

speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: No! You won't catch me!! NO!
scene_heading: EXT. THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, ANOTHER SPOT, LATER

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Need any help?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Remember: be home by seven.
text: The pick-up drives on. The motorcycle cop hands Marvin a
text: ticket. Marvin gets back into his car, throws it in gear,
text: and the car jerks backwards into the guardrail.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Shit!
text: Marvin throws it into forward. The car, fender dented, tears
dialog: away.
scene_heading: EXT. THE PORCH OF A COUNTRY HOUSE, LATE AFTERNOON
text: Sitting on the porch of his house, an OLD MAN watches as
text: Marvin's car slows to a stop out in the road. The tire under
text: the dented fender is torn to ribbons by the metal and the
text: car is now riding on the rim. Marvin stops, gets out of the
text: car, and looks at the tire.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: First he ruins my life, now he ruins
dialog: my tire!
text: Cursing to himself, Marvin walks to the trunk and removes a
dialog: jack.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: God! Damn! Son of a bitching! Bob!
text: A WOMAN comes out of the house and joins the old man. They
text: watch in silence as Marvin jacks up his car. As he twists
text: and grimaces and kicks to get off the lug nuts, it starts to
speaker_heading: RAIN.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Shit piss crap! Son of a bitching
dialog: douche bag asshole!
text: THREE MORE PEOPLE come out on the porch and watch. As Marvin
text: struggles, the car slips off the jack and slams to the
text: pavement. Marvin begins kicking the tire and hitting it with
dialog: the jack.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: What about Bob?! Think about Bob!
dialog: What about Bob? What about Bob? WHAT
dialog: ABOUT BOB!!
scene_heading: EXT. THE MARVIN HOUSE, DUSK
text: Mumbling to himself, soaking wet, and filthy with tire grime,

speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I'm home!
scene_heading: INT. THE MARVIN HOUSE, DUSK. MARVIN'S P.O.V.

speaker_heading: PARTY GUESTS
dialog: Surprise!
dialog: (then sing:)
dialog: "Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday
dialog: to you! Happy Birthd...
text: The singing tapers into silence. Flabbergasted by Marvin's

text: kids approach, tentatively.
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: Dad, what happened?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Leo, look at yourself!
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Just a little car trouble, hon. I'm
dialog: fine.
text: Fay is speechless. So are Siggy and Anna. Not wanting to let
text: things sink, party-hardy well-wishers approach Leo.
speaker_heading: PARTY GUEST 1
dialog: Happy Birthday, Leo.
speaker_heading: PARTY GUEST 2
dialog: Some night to have car trouble. You
dialog: almost missed your own surprise party!
speaker_heading: BOB (O.S.)
dialog: Happy Birthday, Dr. M!
text: Marvin turns and stares at Bob.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I couldn't miss your birthday!
text: Marvin suddenly leaps at Bob and grabs him by the throat. He
text: pushes him through three rooms of the house, choking him.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I want you dead! Dead, you hear me,
dialog: dead!
text: Marvin falls on the floor on top of Bob. Guests go to pull
dialog: him off.
scene_heading: INT. THE MARVIN BEDROOM, NIGHT
text: Marvin lies in bed in the darkened room. He can hear the
text: party guests huddle outside in the hall, whispering. A guest
dialog: whom we recognize as the Doctor 3 from the boat, (the man
text: who is telling this story), enters carrying his doctor's
text: bag. He approaches Fay who is wringing her hands. Both speak
text: in whispers loud enough for Marvin to decipher.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: I've never seen him like this, Phil.
dialog: He's got this delusion about Bob
dialog: Wiley being the cause of all his
dialog: problems and I don't know what to
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: He's under a lot of stress, Fay. His
dialog: book, his interview which frankly
dialog: didn't go so well, his birthday.
dialog: That's a lot to bite off all at once.
dialog: I'll give him a sedative and he'll
dialog: be fine.
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: You really think so?
text: Phil puts a hand on Fay's hand and nods.
scene_heading: INT. THE MARVIN LIVING ROOM, NIGHT
text: Bob sits on the couch beside Siggy. Anna approaches.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You feeling better?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'm fine. It's your dad I'm worried
dialog: about. How is he?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Upstairs. Resting. I can't understand
dialog: why he'd attack you like that.
text: Anna sits next to Bob. Bob sees George Stark, standing across
text: the room, smiling at Anna.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I can't either. But one thing I've
dialog: learned about psychiatrists: they're
dialog: brilliant manipulators. I trust your
dialog: dad completely. I'm sure everything
dialog: he's done has been to help me.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: How come you aren't making a move on
dialog: George Stark?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (glancing at George)
dialog: Bob, we've talked about this.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: No, you've talked about it and I've
dialog: listened. In my opinion, George
text: Stark's smile is not Oedipal
dialog: regression and it's not confused
dialog: libido. It's one good looking guy
dialog: drooling over you, Anna Marvin.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Bob...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Go ask if you can put your tongue in
dialog: his mouth. I hear it works every
dialog: time.
text: Anna smiles then summons her courage, and smilingly approaches
text: George. He is clearly delighted. A woman walks up to Bob.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (LILY)
dialog: Hi. Fay said to introduce myself.
dialog: I'm Lily, Leo's neurotic sister.
text: We saw LILY MARVIN'S picture in Leo's office. Bob stands,
dialog: delighted.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: A pleasure. I'm neurotic too.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Really, what a coincidence. Am I
dialog: disturbing you?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Only in a good way. Sit down.
dialog: She does.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: It must be nice having an analyst in
dialog: the family.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I don't know, ask Leo. I'm an analyst
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: BOB

scene_heading: INT. MARVIN'S DARKENED BEDROOM, NIGHT
text: Phil empties a large syringe into Marvin's buttock. He swats
text: Marvin's behind and Marvin pulls up his pj's.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: That should give you some interesting
dialog: ideas for your next book. You might
text: even wake up feeling happy.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I doubt it. Phil, do you remember a
dialog: classmate named Fensterwald?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Carswell Fensterwald? Sure. Who could
dialog: forget?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I've forgotten and I don't know why.
dialog: Did anything unusual happen with
dialog: him?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: You're joking.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Do I act like a man who's joking?!
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Relax, Leo. I just can't believe
dialog: you'd block something like that out.
dialog: Carswell was at Harvard with us. You
dialog: turned him in for cheating.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: What...?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Don't you remember? You brought action
dialog: against him for stealing your
dialog: psychoanalysis notes and they booted
dialog: him. The only place that would take
dialog: him after that was University of
dialog: Guadalajara.
text: Marvin tries to speak but nothing comes out of his mouth.
text: Tomsky watches with concern.
speaker_heading: TOMKSY
dialog: Leo, is there something about Carswell
dialog: that's disturbing you? Leo...?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Thanks, Phil. Enjoy the party.
text: Phil lingers then leaves, closing the door. Marvin begins
text: shaking all over. As he does the bed rattles rapidly against
text: the wall. Leo's losing it. He's no longer the same sane man.
dialog: In the darkness we hear:
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Baby steps, make a plan.
scene_heading: INT. MARVIN'S BEDROOM, THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
text: Fay sleeps soundly next to Marvin who is wide eyed, staring
text: at the ceiling, twitching. Marvin pulls himself carefully
text: out of bed and crawls on the floor to the door.
scene_heading: EXT. THE MARVIN HOUSE, SAME
text: Marvin, carrying his shoes, crawls outside. He tries to put
text: his shoes on and falls flat on his face. He then pulls himself
text: up and hobbles away.
scene_heading: EXT. THE WINNIPESAUKEE GENERAL STORE, MORNING

text: FRED, the owner, works behind the counter.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Can I help you, doctor?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I want to buy a gun.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Okay.

speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: I've got Winchesters. Colts. What do
dialog: you plan on hunting?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Er. An animal. This tall. Hundred
text: and seventy pounds. Bermuda shorts.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Take a look at this baby. It'll shoot
dialog: through anything but it also leaves
text: a clean wound.
text: He hands Marvin a rifle. Marvin examines it.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Your wife was in with that Bob fellow.
dialog: Sure is a nice guy.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: (handing back the
dialog: rifle)
dialog: What do you have that leaves a messy

scene_heading: ANGLE ON THE CASH REGISTER AREA
text: Fred is ringing up Marvin's purchase: two rifles and a box

speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: I'll need you driver's license, social
dialog: security number, and you can pick
dialog: them up on Friday...
dialog: (checks a calendar)
dialog: the 18th.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: The eighteenth?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: There's a two week waiting period in
dialog: this state.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I can't wait two weeks! I need these
dialog: now!
text: He grabs the rifles. Fred keeps a firm grip on them.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Dr. Marvin, it's the law.
text: Fred wins the tug-of-war. Marvin stares at him.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: What about explosives? Any waiting
dialog: period there?
scene_heading: EXT. BOB'S COTTAGE, MORNING
text: Marvin, carrying a bag and singing to himself, walks up to
text: the cottage. He looks around then kicks open the door.
scene_heading: INT. BOB'S COTTAGE, MORNING
text: The place looks completely anonymous except for Gil in a
text: bowl and Bob's bag of clothes. Marvin sits on the floor,
text: filling a pair of milk cartons with gray powder.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: (singing)
dialog: "Bob fell in to a Burning ring of
dialog: fire. He went down down down And the
dialog: flames went higher. And it burned
dialog: burned burned, That ring of fire.
dialog: The ring of fire."
text: Marvin removes a wired mechanism from the bag and a timer.
text: He delicately pushes the wires into the milk cartons then
text: carefully ties on some fuse wires. He puts the milk cartons
text: and wired mechanisms into a BACKPACK and puts it under Bob's
text: bed. He begins laying the fuse wire along the floor towards
dialog: the door.
text: Marvin passed Gil, sitting on a table. Marvin picks up the
text: bowl and puts it under the bed next to the bomb. He then
text: goes back to laying the wire into the kitchenette.
scene_heading: EXT. BOB'S COTTAGE, SAME
text: Marvin lays the fuse wire across room and out the door. He
text: closes the door and starts to set the timer when he spots a
text: note hanging on the nearby mailbox:
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: (reading aloud)
dialog: "Dear Mr. and Mrs. G., If I'm not
dialog: here, I'm at the Marvins. Would you
dialog: feed Gil? Thanks. Bob. P.S. Your

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: Yeah, mom. Why?
speaker_heading: FAY
dialog: Because I say so, Siggy.
dialog: (to Bob)
dialog: Please don't think it's the way I
dialog: want it. It's just that Leo's not
dialog: himself.
speaker_heading: SIGGY
dialog: It's not Bob's fault.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Listen to your mom, Siggy. All of
dialog: you get out of here, okay? I'll

speaker_heading: FAY

dialog: head.
text: Siggy swats Bob's hand.
speaker_heading: SIGGY

scene_heading: NEW ANGLE, OUT THE LIVING ROOM WINDOW, SAME

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I guess this is good-bye, fam.
text: Bob shuffles to Marvin's chair. He stares at the book Marvin

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

speaker_heading: MARVIN

dialog: Music to die by, Bob!

dialog: No!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yes! I used to be so afraid of
dialog: everything, it was like dying a
dialog: thousand deaths a day. Now, that you
dialog: showed me I have only one death to
dialog: be afraid of, I'm not afraid of
dialog: anything anymore!
speaker_heading: MARVIN
speaker_heading: NOOOO!
text: Marvin runs out the back door of the house. Bob stands there
text: watching him.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Don't be so modest!
scene_heading: EXT. THE MARVIN DOCK, DAY
text: Marvin runs out to the dock and tries to start the little
text: motor boat that sits there. Bob stops at the back door of
text: the house, casually tosses the back pack onto a chair, then
text: follows Marvin.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Dr. M.?
text: Bob walks out onto the dock. Marvin is working frantically
dialog: to start the motorboat.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Dr. M., I'm really cured!
text: The house explodes. Debris rains down on Bob and Marvin.
text: After it settles, the bust of Freud lands on the dock in
text: front of them.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Did somebody leave the gas on?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Why won't you go away! I disgraced
dialog: myself on national television! No
dialog: one will buy my book! My family's
dialog: going to hate me!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Dr. M., your family loves you.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I'M FINISHED!
text: Marvin is about to attack Bob then stands limp, a beaten
text: man. What's left of the house is now burning. The Guttmans
text: have run out of their trailer.
speaker_heading: THE GUTTMANS
dialog: Burn. Burn! Burn!!
text: In the distance, SIRENS APPROACH.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Dr. M. you have the crown jewels of
dialog: England all around you. You have a
dialog: wife with a generous heart. You have
dialog: great kids and an incredible sister.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Stay away from my sister!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Dr. M, you have a fam!
text: Marvin stares at Bob then takes a small can of gas from the
text: old motorboat and pours gas on himself. The SIRENS get closer.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You know, I'm beginning to think
dialog: you're an ingrate.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: People are miserable all over the
dialog: world and you're killing yourself?
dialog: You should be ashamed.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Don't talk that way to me!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Maybe I was wrong about you.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Do you hear me?!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Maybe you're not so good after all.
text: Marvin leaps on Bob.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I'll kill you!
text: Marvin attacks Bob on the dock. Fire trucks arrive. Fay and
text: the family drive up too. As a couple of FIREMEN and the family
text: rush to separate Marvin and Bob...
scene_heading: LONG DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DOCTORS' HOUSE BOAT, SUNSET
text: The doctors and their wives sit around Phil, stunned. Off
text: their bow is the slab that was once the Marvin house.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: And they took him away.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR 1
dialog: My god, it was insanity. Bob drove
dialog: Marvin to complete insanity!
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Leo was taken to the Tomsky Institute
dialog: for a few days for observation. He
dialog: lost his medical license, of course.
dialog: A doctor can't try to kill one of
dialog: his patients and expect to get away
dialog: with it.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Well thank god for that.
dialog: (the other doctors
text: stare daggers at her)
dialog: I mean..., you know... I mean...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Then what happened?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Leo was returned to his family.
scene_heading: EXT. THE TOMSKY CONVALESCENT HOME, DAY
text: Leo stands, small suitcase in hand, looking sad and fragile.
text: Fay, Anna, Siggy, Lily and Bob get out of the station wagon
text: and look at him. No one says a word, then Bob goes up and
text: puts his arms around Leo. Leo stands motionless, shell
dialog: shocked.
speaker_heading: PHIL (O.S.)
dialog: Bob and the family rented a lakeside
dialog: cottage where they could help Leo
dialog: recuperate.
scene_heading: EXT. THE LAWN OF A LAKESIDE COTTAGE, DAY
text: Gil's bowl sits on a lawn table. In addition to Gil, the
text: bowl now contains several baby guppies. Marvin lies on a
text: deck chair, covered with a blanket, staring into nowhere.
text: Bob is next to him, talking on a cordless phone.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: I understand. Sure.
text: He hangs up and puts the phone down.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (to Leo)
dialog: Tough business.
text: Bob makes some notes in his organizer then gets up. He grabs
text: hold of both of Leo's shoulders.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (reassuringly)
dialog: I'm going over here. I'll be right
dialog: over here.
text: Leo doesn't look at him. A zombie would seem more alive. Bob
text: goes and joins the volleyball game.
speaker_heading: BOB (O.S.)
dialog: Okay, I'm with Siggy.
text: Marvin sits staring into nowhere. The phone rings. Again.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: (almost inaudible)
dialog: Phone.
text: The volleyball game continues.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: (a touch louder)
dialog: Phone.
text: After another ring, he reaches for it.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: (listlessly affectless)
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: VOICE ON PHONE
dialog: May I speak to Bob, please?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: (still staring into
dialog: nowhere)
dialog: Bob's... unavailable right now. Can...
dialog: I take a message?
speaker_heading: VOICE ON PHONE
dialog: I'm Mr. Jameson with the Tucson school
dialog: district. Bob contacted us about
dialog: buying some toothbrushes but we're
dialog: going to have to cancel the order.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: (writing)
dialog: Tucson canceling order... Any message
dialog: why?
speaker_heading: JAMESON
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: It's not a priority right now.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: (writing)
dialog: Not priority... right now.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: JAMESON
speaker_heading: (ON PHONE)
dialog: Well... money's tight and...
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Sure.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Though, you know there is another
dialog: way to look at it.
speaker_heading: JAMESON
speaker_heading: (ON PHONE)
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Well... if you gave a new toothbrush
dialog: and taught dental hygiene to every
dialog: student at your school... In the
dialog: long run you'd save them thousands
dialog: of dollars. I mean look at the cost
dialog: of dental bills. I bet I could have
dialog: put my kids through college with
dialog: what I've spent on fillings.
speaker_heading: JAMESON
dialog: That's an interesting point.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: It is, isn't it?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Maybe you should try the toothbrushes.
dialog: You might do a lot for education by
dialog: saving teeth.
speaker_heading: JAMESON
dialog: Huh. I never thought of that.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I tell you what. Tell Bob we'll take
dialog: the order and see how it goes.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Great.
text: Marvin hangs up the phone. He affectless expression suddenly
text: turns to one full of thought.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Fay.
text: Marvin sits up, gaining energy, even enthusiasm.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Fay!
text: The Marvin family hurries over.
speaker_heading: PHIL (V.O.)
text: Leo Marvin now makes toothbrushes.
text: Bob puts his arm around Leo as he gestures and talks more
text: and more animatedly to his delighted family.
speaker_heading: PHIL (V.O.)
dialog: The irony, of course, is that Bob
dialog: brought the family closer than they'd
dialog: ever been before. Harvey Green saw
dialog: Leo last month and said he never
dialog: looked happier.
scene_heading: EXT. THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE BOAT
text: The doctors are stunned.
speaker_heading: FEINBERG
dialog: My god. The poor bastard.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER DOCTOR
dialog: And you thought you had nightmares.
speaker_heading: FEINBERG
dialog: Unbelievable...
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: What happened to Bob?
dialog: The others jump in: "Yeah, what about Bob? What about Bob?
dialog: What about Bob?"
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Bob married Lily and had triplets.
dialog: He went back to school, got a degree
dialog: in marriage-family-counseling, and
dialog: now has a big practice on Park and

speaker_heading: DOCTOR 2 (V.O.)
dialog: Wait a minute. You're not telling me
dialog: that Bob Wiley is Dr. Robert S. Wiley,
dialog: the psychologist?!
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: That's exactly what I'm telling you.
text: A BIG HOUSE BOAT goes by. Phil yells to it.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Hey Bob! Hello, BOB!!
text: ANGLE ON THE BIG HOUSEBOAT
text: Bob is surrounded by Lily Marvin, three toddlers and lots of
text: friends. Smiling, Bob waves at the doctors.
speaker_heading: FEINBERG (V.O.)
dialog: Wrote that huge best seller? What's
dialog: it called?
text: Bob's boat turns. On it's stern, in huge letters is it's
dialog: name: "Vacation Therapy".
speaker_heading: FEINBERG (V.O.)
