scene_heading: INT. - A HUT - BEFORE DAWN
text: A MAN'S HAND, hardworking, rough, lights twigs under a kettle.
text: Predawn light trickles through the tin walls onto well worn
text: farming tools...hoe, pick, axe, a yoke for an ox. Animist
text: totems and charms hang. We are in a typical Mende FARMER'S
text: HUT. Except for the ENGLISH SCHOOLBOOKS on a shelf.
text: The HAND that lit the kettle takes the books off the shelf
text: and gently nudges a 14-year-old BOY awake with them. The
text: boy, DIA is his name, groans in sleepy protest.
text: SOLOMON VANDY smiles down at his son.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: (in Mende; subtitled)
dialog: Don't want to be late.
text: The boy sits up, half asleep. Sleepily pulls a shirt over
text: his head. His English is more schooled than his father's.
speaker_heading: DIA
dialog: (in Mende; subtitled)
dialog: English boys go to school every day?
text: Solomon fills a tin cup of powdered milk. He is a man marked
text: by quiet patience, in the worn trousers and white cotton
text: shirt of a Mende farmer. He hands the cup to the boy.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: {in Mende; subtitled)
dialog: Yes, they do.
speaker_heading: DIA
dialog: (in Mende; subtitled)
dialog: Not every day.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: (in Mende; subtitled)
dialog: Every day. Just like you. So you
dialog: can become a doctor. Not walk behind
dialog: an ox like your father.
text: The boy catches his MOTHER's eye as she breast-feeds his
text: INFANT BROTHER, His twelve-year old sister, N'YANDA, snuggles
text: with them. She sticks her tongue out at her brother.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't worry. She will be joining
dialog: you next year.
text: JASSIE sends both her men a kiss as they head out.
speaker_heading: JASSIE
dialog: (in Mende, subtitled)
dialog: Be careful on the road.
text: Solomon gives his wife an "I know" look.
scene_heading: EXT. HUT - VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS 2
text: Solomon and Dia emerge into the early light. Their hut is
text: in a hamlet amidst cassava patches eeked out of the jungle.
speaker_heading: DIA
dialog: Don't want to be a doctor.
dialog: (off Solomon's look)
dialog: I want to be President.
text: Solomon puts his arm around him. They head into the fields.
speaker_heading: CREDITS OVER
text: SOLOMON AS HE WORKS IN THE FIELDS. IT IS A TIMELESS 3
scene_heading: PICTURE. ONE OF PASTORAL BEAUTY AND SIMPLICITY.
text: AT NOONTIME, JASSIE AND N'YANDA GRING LUNCH. THEY SIT IN 4
text: THE SHADE OF A HUGE BEOBOB TREE.
text: DIA RETURNS HOME, CARRYING HIS SCHOOLBOOKS. NOW HE WORKS 5
scene_heading: BESIDE HIS FATHER.
text: THE SUN IS ALREADY LOW AS THEY RETURN TO THE VILLAGE 6
speaker_heading: CREDITS END
text: Solomon stands stock still, sensing something ... A few
text: chickens flit away without crowing. The oxen are skittish.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Go back inside... NOW!
text: Dia is confused. Solomon pushes him into the hut as grinning
text: TEENAGE REBELS appear. One wears a Tupac t-shirt. He rakes
text: everything with AK-47 FIRE. Huts. Animals. People.
text: Solomon dives to the ground. VILLAGERS run screaming.
text: Chickens squawk, oxen bray. A rumble. Two mud-splattered
text: PICK-UP TRUCKS with sawed-off roofs crash through the brush,
text: full of R.U.F. REBELS, who quickly jump off -- shouting,
text: wielding machetes and automatic rifles, BANDOLIERS OF AMMO
text: criss-crossed on their bare chests, GRENADES on their belts.
text: Solomon cowers amidst the gunfire, looks around frantically.
text: Men and boys are being rounded up. Huts set on fire.
text: Suddenly he is yanked up as two REBELS pull him away--
text: Jassie exits their hut, infant in her arms, mad with fear ~-
speaker_heading: JASSIE
dialog: Solomon!
text: He shouts back. Only one word.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Run!
text: She doesn't. She just stands there screaming his name. Now
text: Solomon's son and daughter come out of the hut.
speaker_heading: DIA
speaker_heading: PAPA!
text: Solomon, the rifle choking him, as he's dragged away.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: RUN!
text: Jassie grabs her son's arm. He resists, staring in anguish
text: at his father. But she tugs at him. And with the two younger
text: children in tow, they join others. Running.
text: Solomon watches them disappear into the bush.
text: IN THE NEXT MOMENT
text: he's rounded up with the OTHER MALES. Only a few able-bodied
text: among them. Most are old, skinny men and terrified boys.
text: REBELS prod them with rifles, making them form a line. All
text: under the watchful sunglasses of an R.U.F. COLONEL.
text: The FIRST VILLAGER is shoved to his knees in front of a tree
text: stump. A muscle-bound, SHIRTLESS REBEL with a gleaming AXE
text: struts over, his eyes glazed from palm wine and marijuana.
text: A second rebel grabs the village man's HAND and places it on
text: the stump. The man pulls his hand away. Tupac t-shirt puts
text: the Ak-47 to his head.
dialog: The choice is clear. Your head or your hands.
text: The villager tries to scramble away. RAT-A-TAT! Bullet
text: through his head. The choice is made for him.
text: The next man in line is made to kneel at the stump.
speaker_heading: TUPAC T-SHIRT
dialog: Long sleeve or short sleeve?
text: The other stoned rebels find this hilarious.
text: ON SOLOMON, witnessing his mutilation as terrified WAILS
text: rise around him. The discarded limb is thrown into a bag.
text: The next in line, A STRONG YOUNG MAN, is pushed to the stump.
dialog: 10
speaker_heading: R.U.F. COLONEL
dialog: Not him. He can work.
text: The STRONG YOUNG MAN is herded into a waiting truck. Next
text: comes AN OLD MAN. Shaking, he offers his withered hand.
text: ON SOLOMON. The “crunch" of the axe bores into his soul.
text: The old man is lifted to his feet in clinical shock. Both
text: his forearms end in bloody stumps.
speaker_heading: R.U.F. COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: You are the messenger. Spread the
dialog: word. Guv'ment say da future is in
dialog: your hands? We say R.U.F. is da
text: future. Revolution is at hand.
text: Solomon is next. He closes his eyes as his hand is placed
text: on the tree stump slick with blood. The Colonel looks him
text: over. Motions the henchmen to stop.
speaker_heading: R.U. F. COLONEL
dialog: You will need your hands.
text: Solomon is herded into the truck.
scene_heading: EXT. SIERRA LEONE -- (SEEN FROM ABOVE) 8
text: A seaplane soars above the bush. At the stick, DANNY ARCHER.
dialog: He has seen more in his thirty years than most people have
text: seen in a lifetime of watching bad television.
text: He scans the landscape then dips toward the estuary of a
text: broad river, eventually splashing to a stop.
scene_heading: NEARBY, ON THE SANDY BANK 9
text: Sitting in a lawn chair is COMMANDER RAMBO, a twenty year-
text: old R.U.F. fighter with a goatee, wrap-around sunglasses,
text: and a Bob Marley t-shirt. Arrayed behind him, several
text: BODYGUARDS cradle automatic weapons while eating m&m's. A
text: huge BOOM BOX throbs out Tupac's "If I Die 2Nite.”
scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT 10
text: FAWAZ, a thin Lebanese man, sits beside Archer and eyes the
text: rebels waiting on the riverbank. Murmurs a prayer in Arabic.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Say one for me, my friend.
text: Archer closes his eyes for a moment, then checks the clip on
text: his 9mm Sig-Sauer before tucking it into his belt and pulling
text: his shirt-tails over it. Takes a deep breath.
scene_heading: 11 EXT. ON SHORE 11
text: Archer wades in and approaches the group. Imagine teenagers
text: on a corner in Bed-Sty carrying AK-47's. Their menace is
text: palpable even as they laugh and pass around a big spliff.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: You are Colonel Zero?
speaker_heading: COMMANDER RAMBO
dialog: I am Commander Rambo.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: What happened to Colonel Zero?
text: No response. A few of the rebels giggle.
speaker_heading: COMMANDER RAMBO
dialog: He was not committed to the
dialog: revolution. You are here to help us
dialog: in our struggle against the oppressor.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: I'm here to do business.
text: They eye each other in silence.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: You have something for me.
speaker_heading: COMMANDER RAMBO
dialog: First you will show me what you have
dialog: brought.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: No. First you will pay for them.
text: Rambo looks at him with dead eyes. Archer looks back with
text: eyes equally dead. A nasty stand-off. Until Rambo hands
text: him a small, filthy cloth SACK. Archer tips a few rough
text: diamonds into his hand.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: (in Krio; subtitled)
dialog: This is not what was agreed.
speaker_heading: COMANDER RAMBO
dialog: (in Krio; subtitled)
dialog: Maybe I will take the weapons and
dialog: give you nothing.
text: Archer closes his eyes again, looks back at the seaplane.
text: The cargo door SLIDES OPEN, revealing the muzzle of a M-130
text: Assault Weapon. Fawaz racks its slide.
text: In response, the Rebels slide the bolts on their weapons.
speaker_heading: 11A
dialog: 12
dialog: 13
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: (in Krio; subtitled)
dialog: Maybe I'll just do my business with
dialog: the government. At least the
text: oppressor pays his bills.
text: He turns and starts back toward the plane.
speaker_heading: COMMANDER RAMBO
dialog: Wait... Wait...
text: Rambo smiles as if it has all been a joke. He reaches into
text: a rusty coffee can and pulls out a huge handful of diamonds.
speaker_heading: COMMANDER RAMBO (CONT'D)
dialog: This is what you want? Here... So
dialog: many, I don't know what to do with
dialog: them all.
text: He gestures for Archer to hold out his hands and pours hima
dialog: handful.
speaker_heading: COMMANDER
dialog: You bring a satellite dish next time,
dialog: yah? I want to watch NYPD Blue.
speaker_heading: MOMENTS LATER 11A
text: As the seaplane takes off, we see the rebels unloading crates
text: of RPGs with Ukranian markings.
scene_heading: INT. PLANE 12
text: Fawaz gleefully examines their haul.
speaker_heading: PAWAZ
dialog: I'm buying an electronics store.
dialog: Sit on my ass all day, drink sweet
dialog: tea and watch dvd's. How about it,
dialog: Danny?
text: Archer closes his eyes for a moment. He is free.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Fly the plane.
scene_heading: EXT. DIAMOND FIELD - SIERRA LEONE - DAY 13
text: An open pit alluvial mine carved beside a jungle river. Men
text: and boys toil knee deep in muddy water. They dig with their
text: hands, shoveling silt into wooden troughs. All under the
text: watchful eyes and guns of R.U.F. REBELS who stand on the
text: banks passing a fat joint rolled in newspaper.
text: Meanwhile, their leader -- CAPTAIN POISON -- spouts twisted
dialog: revolutionary dogma to the diggers:
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN POISON
dialog: The Freetown guv-a-ment and their
dialog: white masters have raped your land
dialog: to feed their greed! We have freed
dialog: you! No more slave and master here!
dialog: We are all brothers!
text: Solomon, his back straining under the weight of a circular
text: sieve, pauses to wipe sweat from his eyes. He's prodded
text: with a rifle, looks up into the fierce FACE of Captain Poison.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN POISON (CONT'D)
dialog: Back to work! Your work is your
dialog: liberation! Work harder! Dig harder!
text: Solomon turns back to his sieve. ANOTHER DIGGER, peers into
text: his sieve, plucks something out, holds it up in his hand.
speaker_heading: DIGGER
dialog: Kunaa!
text: All work stops. A rebel comes over. The digger hands him
text: the tiny, milky crystal. A diamond. Without a word, the
text: Commander wraps the stone in a piece of paper.
text: As work resumes, Solomon watches the piece of paper handed
text: off to a RUNNER, who runs it over to the SAME COMMANDER, who
text: sits under the shade of a palm frond umbrella reading a
text: Hustler magazine. He stuffs the diamond into his shirt pocket
text: without even looking at it.
text: Across from Solomon, a 3RD DIGGER glances around. Furtively
text: picks a stone from the sieve and slips it into his mouth.
text: He meets Solomon's eyes. Solomon looks away, keeps working.
text: When he becomes aware of Captain Poison's eyes on him.
text: Solomon tries to shake off the eyes by shaking the sieve.
text: Captain Poison remains staring at him, intently. Then, calmly
text: walks over to the 3rd digger with the diamond in his mouth.
text: AND SHOOTS HIM, at point blank range.
text: Everything stops. Poison turns back to Solomon.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN POISON
dialog: You. Bring him out.
text: Solomon puts down his sieve. Looks at the BODY floating
text: next to him, turning the muddy water red ...
speaker_heading: SOLOMON (V.O.)
dialog: Dear Jassie. I cannot write well
dialog: enough to put in a letter all the
dialog: thoughts in my head.

dialog: 19
scene_heading: EXT. R.U.F. DIAMOND CAMP - SUNSET 14
text: Solomon devours a meager portion of rice gruel in a tin cup.
text: Others sleep in their fetid clothes on the ground.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON (V.O.)
dialog: Even if I could, my guards would not
dialog: let me send it.
scene_heading: EXT. DIAMOND CAMP - NIGHT 15
text: Solomon sits shivering, looking out at the guards on watch.
text: Beyond, a lit TENT where rebels drink and shout back at a
text: satellite TV playing, "Who Wants To Be a Millionaire.”
speaker_heading: SOLOMON (V.O.)
dialog: I do not know where you are. I do
dialog: not even know where I am.
scene_heading: EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE BINTUMANI FOOTHILLS 16
text: Jassie and the children are among a group of homeless Mende.
text: Dia carries the infant. Hearing trucks coming, they scatter
text: into the bush. An R.U.F convoy roars past. After a moment,
text: they return to the road.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON (V.0O.)
dialog: I only know that my thoughts fly
dialog: over the mountains to you.
scene_heading: EXT. BED OF GRASS ~ NIGHT 17
text: Solomon lays there. Eyes open in a living nightmare.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON (V.0O.)
dialog: I will find you, Jassie. I£ it takes
dialog: my whole life. We will be together.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY 18
text: A high pass. Misty peaks in the distance. A BRILLIANT RED
text: SHAPE comes into view - the bright headdress of a HAUSA
text: SHEPHERD. He carries a spear as he leads a herd of GOATS,
text: bells clinking around their necks.
text: Picking up the rear is Archer, checking a handheld GPS. His
text: SATELLITE PHONE buzzes...
speaker_heading: ARCHER
text: We're two clicks from the strip.
dialog: What've you got?
scene_heading: EXT/INT. TWIN ENGINE TURBO PROP - FLYING - SAME 19
text: Piloted by Fawaz. He speaks into his SAT phone, worriedly
text: looking down on the dense jungle canopy.
dialog: 20
speaker_heading: FAWAZ
dialog: ...Company.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAINS ~ SAME 20
text: Sure enough, over the hill, comes an armed patrol of ECOMOG
text: SOLDIERS. The TROOP LEADER approaches Archer.
speaker_heading: TROOP LEADER
dialog: Papers.
text: Archer fishes out identification. Hands it over.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Elliot Smith, National Geographic.
speaker_heading: TROOP LEADER
dialog: You are crossing into Liberia.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: I have a letter from the Minister of
dialog: Interior and a Liberian visa as well.
dialog: (as the Captain studies
dialog: the papers)
text: Doing a story on the Hausa who, as
dialog: you know, are allowed to cross the
dialog: border to get to grazing grounds.
text: Up above, the tiny Plane drones past. The troop leader
text: glances up, then at Archer, who courteously offers an unopened
text: pack of cigarettes from his shirt pocket.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Ever read National Geographic?
text: The troop leader ignores him, walks over toa goat and runs
text: his hands down the goat's back, under its chin. His hands
text: part a tuft of hair -- revealing a surgically straight line
text: of STITCHES in the goat's skin.
text: Archer feels the shape of the 9mm under his shirt, looks
text: around at the rifles. Too many of them.
text: The troop leader takes out a KNIFE and cuts into the stitches.
text: The goat squeals a little and kicks angrily. From under the
text: goat's skin, he takes a dozen small, rough DIAMONDS.
text: The troop leader draws his -45 on Archer.
speaker_heading: TROOP LEADER
dialog: You are under arrest for smuggling.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Now you listen here, my man. JI ama
dialog: good friend of Minister Somora. He
dialog: will not be pleased you have
dialog: interfered with his business.
dialog: 21
dialog: 10.
text: Clearly the name of Minister Somora carries some weight.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: You know who I am, don't you? What
dialog: Iam...? I don't think you want to
dialog: mess with me. Or my friends, eh?
dialog: (changes his tack)
dialog: How about I just look the other way
dialog: and you pocket one or two of those
dialog: stones. Buy something nice for the
dialog: wife. Or maybe the mistress, eh?
dialog: (re the shepherds)
dialog: Who's going to tell? Them?
text: The shepherds look, uncertain, from Archer to the soldier.
speaker_heading: TROOP LEADER
dialog: No.
text: The troop leader FIRES. One of the shepherds falls dead.
text: The other is cut down as he tries to flee. The leader frowns
text: at Archer, whose world has suddenly turned upside down.
speaker_heading: TROOP LEADER (CONT'D)
dialog: We will go back to Freetown and ask
dialog: Minister Somora how he wishes to
dialog: thank his business associate.
scene_heading: INT. AN ANONYMOUS ROOM -- DAY 21
text: Archer is handcuffed to a chair. A large, rotund FIGURE
text: enters, silhouetted against the bright windows.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Mr. Minister, there seems to have
dialog: been a terrible misunderst--
text: SOMORA BACKHANDS him. Archer's head rocks backwards.
speaker_heading: MINISTER SOMORA
dialog: I thought we were friends,
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: You're right, you're right... I
dialog: took a little initiative but--
text: Another SLAP.
speaker_heading: MINISTER SOMORA
dialog: Have I not been good to you?
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: (licks his split lip)
dialog: Absolutely. And I was planning to
dialog: cut you in. Haven't I always been--
dialog: 22
dialog: ll.
text: This SLAP knocks Archer's chair backwards to the cement. He
text: lies there for a moment. Somora looms over him.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Look... if you wanted to kill me,
dialog: you would've done it already. So
dialog: what is it you want me to do?
text: Somora smiles. One of his teeth has a tiny diamond.
scene_heading: INT. THE UNITED NATIONS - NEW YORK - DAY 22
text: The SECRETARY GENERAL of the UN addresses a a full ASSEMBLY.
scene_heading: SECRETARY GENERAL
dialog: We propose then to prohibit the direct
dialog: or indirect import of all rough
dialog: diamonds from conflict zones to the
dialog: territory of Member States.
text: He looks at the front row where TWO MEN IN SAVILLE ROW SUITS
text: sit among the Representatives. One is sandy-haired, 40, his
text: name is SIMMONS. He serves a distinguished-looking older
text: man, 60, with a shock of white hair. His name is DE WENTE.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY GENERAL (CONT'D)
dialog: As we know, these stones are only a
dialog: small percentage of the legitimate
dialog: diamond industry -- whose trade is
dialog: crucial to the economies of several
dialog: emerging nations, and I applaud their
dialog: support of such a ban.
text: The well-dressed diamond industry reps smile back.
scene_heading: LATER - CHAMPAGNE IS SERVED 23
text: in a reception hall. The Diamond industry REPS and WIVES
text: mingle with UN MEMBERS and other DIGNITARIES. US AMBASSADOR
text: WALKER approaches De Wente, holds out his hand.
speaker_heading: AMBASSADOR WALKER
dialog: Mister De Wente... Judd Walker--
speaker_heading: DE WENTE
dialog: Ambassador. Good to finally meet
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: AMBASSADOR WALKER
dialog: You don't spend much time this side
dialog: of the Atlantic.
speaker_heading: DE WENTE
dialog: I'm hoping to change that. Perhaps
dialog: with your help.
dialog: 24
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: AMBASSADOR WALKER
dialog: Mr. De Wente, I'm afraid I don't
dialog: have much faith in any industry's
dialog: ability to police itself.
speaker_heading: DE WENTE
dialog: I assure you, sir, we both want the
dialog: same thing. These 'conflict' stones
dialog: put the legitimacy of our entire
dialog: business at risk.
text: De Wente's young blonde WIFE appears at his side. It's hard
dialog: to decide which is more beautiful, the woman or the two-
text: million-dollar DIAMOND NECKLACE she's wearing.
speaker_heading: DE WENTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Darling... This is Ambassador Walker.
speaker_heading: DE WENTE'S WIFE
dialog: How nice to meet you.
speaker_heading: DE WENTE
dialog: (his arm around her)
dialog: It's my belief, Ambassador, that
dialog: diamonds should be associated with
dialog: romance and beauty. Not warfare.
dialog: Don't you agree?
text: How can the Ambassador not be dazzled? From the glittering
dialog: diamonds, we cut to:
scene_heading: EXT. DIAMOND FIELD - PIT - DAY 24
text: Solomon works in the muddy water, his eyes transfixed by the
text: sparkling reflections of the river and the swaying trees
text: that seem so unaffected by the brutality beneath.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON (V.0O.)
dialog: Dear Jassie. How can it be that one
dialog: stone is worth more than another?
text: Solomon wills himself back to the soul-killing work.
text: Suddenly, a WATER PUMP BREAKS -- gushing like a fire hose --
text: knocking over Solomon and several diggers. Solomon's sieve
text: is swept down river. He swims after the SIEVE. Grabs it,
text: sloshing his way back, when he stops...
text: There, underwater, by the riverbank, is something SHINY ENOUGH
text: to reflect the sun. As the silt washes away, the object
text: remains underwater. A ROCK of a startling pink color.
text: Solomon blinks down at it. The DIAMOND sparkles up at him.
dialog: 25
dialog: 26
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON (V.0.) (CONT'D)
dialog: And how can a thing that comes from
dialog: our mother the earth be so beautiful
dialog: as to make people want to kill?
text: Solomon looks around. Rebel guards are fixing the pump,
text: shouting at diggers to get back to work.
text: Solomon scoops the diamond into his sieve, covers it with
text: silt. His heart is pounding as he wades back to the bank.
speaker_heading: REBEL GUARD
dialog: You daydreaming? Get back to work!
text: Solomon nods. Quickly submerges his silt-heaped sieve.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERNEATH THE MUDDY WATER - CONTINUOUS 25
text: Solomon overturns the sieve. His BARE FOOT catches the
dialog: diamond.
scene_heading: EXT. ABOVE THE WATER - SAME 26
text: Solomon raises his hand to get the guards‘ attention. He
text: clutches his abdomen, painfully.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: I must go badly.
dialog: (pleading)
dialog: Can't hold it in, boss.
text: The guard motions him out. Solomon climbs out, sliding his
text: second foot carefully. He shuffles to the edge of the jungle.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN POISON
dialog: Stop.
text: Solomon freezes. Poison searches Solomon. Starting with
text: his hair, his ears, nose. Squeezing his cheeks to see into
text: his mouth. Frisking his pants, unrolling his cuffs.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN POISON (CONT'D)
dialog: Lift your foot.
text: Solomon lifts his right foot. They check between his toes.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN POISON (CONT'D)
dialog: The other.
text: Solomon, looking into Poison's eyes, lifts his left foot.
text: Poison checks between the toes. Satisfied.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN POISON (CONT'D)
dialog: Make it quick.
text: CLOSE ON SOLOMON’'S FOOT, as he lowers it. The toes curl
text: into the soft muddy earth, obviously retrieving something.
dialog: 27
dialog: 28
dialog: 29
dialog: 14.
scene_heading: EXT. EDGE OF JUNGLE - MOMENTS LATER 27
text: As Solomon squats behind a fallen tree, he eyes the guards
text: through the broad leaves.
text: Quickly, his toes release the muddy gob under his foot. He
text: rubs the mud off it. It's raw beauty is almost unnatural.
text: He glances back to make sure he is unobserved and then rips
text: the cuff off his pants.
text: A CLICK at his head.
text: Solomon slowly looks up ... into the BARREL OF A COLT .45.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN POISON
dialog: Give it to me.
text: Solomon doesn't move. What difference does it make? He.
text: awaits the crack of the gun, when:
text: A MORTAR ROUND COMES SCREAMING OUT OF THE JUNGLE.
text: THE EXPLOSION knocks Solomon to the ground.
text: MORE MORTARS. ECOMOG government troops appear, firing
text: automatic weapons. Solomon scrambles over to Poison's bleeding
text: body, removes the MACHETE from the belt.
text: As shrapnel shreds the greenery, he furiously digs with the
text: machete. Wraps the DIAMOND in his TORN GREEN CUFF and plants
text: it in the hole.
text: When he is STRUCK IN THE HEAD BY A RIFLE BUTT.
text: He falls. ECOMOG SOLDIERS are shouting at him in Mende.
text: Solomon realizes he still holds the machete, lets it drop.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Don't shoot! I am not R.U.F!
text: Around him ECOMOG soldiers beat the rebel prisoners with
text: sticks -- in the distance, others are EXECUTED at random.
scene_heading: EXT. FREETOWN - DAY 28
text: A convoy of MILITARY TRUCKS rolls through teeming streets.
text: Women walk with baskets on their heads, tribal bells jingling
text: around their ankles. "Businessmen" in white suits sip Coca-
text: Colas outside a hotel. A UN helicopter circles overhead.
scene_heading: EXT. BACK OF A MILITARY TRUCK - SAME 23
text: Solomon sits chained to other rebel prisoners. He's never
dialog: been to a city, never seen so many people. It's overwhelming.
dialog: 30
dialog: is.
text: He stares at the BEGGARS who run alongside. War orphans,
text: the same age as his own son. He searches every face
scene_heading: INT. FREETOWN PRISON (PADEMBA ROAD) -- DAY 30
text: Archer looks up from a game of solitaire as REBEL PRISONERS
text: are marched past his dank cell.
speaker_heading: REBEL #1
dialog: R.U.F. is coming! Operation Chop
dialog: Hands! Get ready, my brothers!
text: Archer turns his attention back to his game as the cell door
text: next to his is opened and Solomon is thrown in.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: I am not R.U.F. My name is Solomon
dialog: Vandy! I ama farmer!
text: Archer assesses him. Solomon gives him a hard stare.
text: MORE PRISONERS are brought in, one carried on a stretcher.
text: A bandage covers half his face. But when he turns his head,
text: we see that it's Captain Poison. Solomon turns away.
text: Poison lifts his head, squinting through the CELL BARS.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN POISON

text: Solomon doesn't acknowledge Poison.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN POISON (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm talking to you! You hear me!?
dialog: Where is the diamond!?
text: Archer pricks up his ears, but goes on playing solitaire.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN POISON (CONT'D)
dialog: A pink diamond. I saw you take it!!
text: Archer's hand, flipping over a card, stops. Listening
text: intently now but careful not to show it.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: You are mad. I do not know you.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN POISON
dialog: I saw it with my own eyes!!
text: Poison reaches into his sweat stained shirt, an IVORY CHARM
text: from around his neck. Holds it up for all to see.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN POISON (CONT'D)
dialog: This big! Biggest I have ever seen!!
text: Solomon just shakes his head, absurdly.
dialog: 31
dialog: 16.
text: BUT ARCHER'S EYES...are on the ivory charm, even as he keeps
text: playing solitaire. Poison calls to the guards.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN POISON (CONT'D)
dialog: I will give a thousand dollars to
dialog: the man who cuts it out of him!
text: These words do something to Solomon. He stands and rips off
text: his shirt. Then his torn pants. Everything. Until he stands
text: completely naked, facing Captain Poison through the bars.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Where is a diamond? Do you see a
dialog: diamond!? You devils have taken my
dialog: family. My home. Everything! Here!
dialog: Look! What is left!? What is left!?
dialog: If there is a diamond, then you are
dialog: the one who has taken it!!
text: Poison lifts his upper body from the stretcher.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN POISON
dialog: Liar! He's a LIAR!
text: The army guards have had enough. They silence Poison with a
text: rifle butt to the face. As they drag him away, they give
dialog: Solomon a “got my eye on you, too" glare.
text: Archer lays out a new hand of solitaire. His eyes move to
text: Solomon, then away. He's heard all he has to.
text: Solomon begins putting his clothes back on. The fury still
text: in his eyes. Through the bars, he gives Archer a final glare.
text: Archer turns away, just keeps playing cards.
text: But then ... ever so carefully ... he picks out the ACE OF
text: DIAMONDS. Folds it in half. He gets up and goes to his
text: cell door. Waits until a PRISON GUARD passes by.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Excuse me, brother. Think you could
dialog: get a message to Minister Somora?
text: The prison guard sees the PACK OF CIGARETTES - and the folded
text: card - that Archer holds through the bars.
scene_heading: EXT. PRISON GATE -~ NEXT DAY 31
text: Archer walks out into the street, blinks in the sunlight.
scene_heading: ACROSS THE STREET - THE SAME SCENE

speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: There's a farmer in there. He
dialog: might've found a pink.
speaker_heading: FAWAZ
dialog: And what? You told Somora you'd get
dialog: hold of it?
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: I need to contact our friends in
dialog: London.
speaker_heading: FAWAZ
dialog: I thought we were working for Somora.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Who needs Somora if the pink is real?
text: Archer can tell that Fawaz is holding something back.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: ~-What?
speaker_heading: FAWAZ
dialog: London wants nothing more to do with

speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)

text: In frustration, he throws the phone across the room.
scene_heading: EXT. FREETOWN STREET -- DAY 33

speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Piss off.
text: He pushes his way past without a trace of compassion.
scene_heading: MEANWHILE -- THE DOOR TO ARCHER'S HOTEL ROOM IS KICKED OPEN 34

text: It is clear he is looking for something quite small.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH BAR -- DAY 35
dialog: Every war zone has a place like this. Soldiers, smugglers,
text: opportunists of every stripe stand shoulder to shoulder at a
dialog: oo bar. Bad guys and do-gooders, UN workers and eco-
text: backpackers drink overpriced, watered-down liquor, trade
text: gossip, and hook up for desperate expatriate sex. "Sierra
text: Afrique" blends African drums and electric bass.
text: Every now and then, in the distant hills, the muted SOUND OF
text: AN EXPLOSION and a rising COLUMN OF SMOKE. No one pays any
text: attention. There is serious drinking to be done.
dialog: 19.
text: As Archer shoulders his way past, we OVERHEAR brief snippets

speaker_heading: PEACEKEEPER
dialog: This place is nothing but hustlers

text: Archer turns to MADDY BOWEN. Maddy's a 'handful' whose beauty

speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: When's the last time the world wasn't

speaker_heading: ARCHER

speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: And you're here to make a buck.

speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: See that guy? Government minister

dialog: (points nearby)
dialog: That one...? Sells AK-47's to the

speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: And your point is?
speaker_heading: ARCHER

speaker_heading: MADDY

dialog: For De Wente?
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: It's not just rude to ask those kind
dialog: of questions, Ms. Bowen, it's also

speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: I'll take my chances.
dialog: (leans closer)
dialog: So... tell me about blood diamonds.
text: And then, suddenly, Archer gets it. His face turns to stone.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: ..-You're a journalist.
speaker_heading: MADDY

speaker_heading: ARCHER

speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: De Wente Diamonds closed its buying

scene_heading: EXT. RAWDON STREET (FREETOWN) -- SUNSET (MUSIC OVER)

speaker_heading: SIMMONS
dialog: So. What brings you to London?
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Reg... Spare me.
text: Simmons adjusts the trousers of his bespoke suit. He'd rather

speaker_heading: SIMMONS
dialog: A month ago, officers of this company
text: sat in front of the United Nations
dialog: and pledged to uphold a ban on
dialog: “conflict” diamonds.
dialog: (looks out the window)
dialog: We are no longer accepting the stones

dialog: You're recording this.

speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)

text: Simmons glances at his watch.
speaker_heading: SIMMONS
dialog: You don't plan to lecture me on the

speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: The trade? Oh, that has such a nicer

text: Archer stands and walks to a FRAMED WALL PHOTO of the

scene_heading: INSIDE THE OFFICE 52

scene_heading: COLONEL THEO COETSEE, 60,

speaker_heading: ARCHER

speaker_heading: THE COLONEL

speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: (finishing the toast)

speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: I want you to come back.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Thanks but I prefer not to.
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL

text: Archer smiles darkly.
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: They want us to take back the diamond

speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: According to our Minister Somora,
dialog: you've got something in the works.
dialog: Something. ..pink.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: (dismissive)
dialog: The fantasy of some Mende farmer...
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: There is the small matter of payment
dialog: on some RPG's. You haven't forgotten
dialog: who arranged that shipment from our

speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: But who is it, I wonder, who tipped
dialog: off the ECOMOG to the goat routine?

speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: Pay your debt in cash or come back

speaker_heading: ARCHER

speaker_heading: THE COLONEL

dialog: You're African to the bone.

speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: I appreciate that. Thank you.
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: We'll meet again soon?
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: No disrespect, sir, but I hope not.
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: You think selling weapons is better
dialog: than using them? At least when it's
dialog: you pulling the trigger, you know
dialog: you're not the target.

scene_heading: BEHIND THE FARMHOUSE 59
text: They approach the parked Mercedes. Archer turns to Joost.
speaker_heading: ARCHER

speaker_heading: PAWAZ

speaker_heading: MADDY

speaker_heading: ARCHER

speaker_heading: ARCHER

speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: Chicago.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: ++-You can tell a lot about someone

speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: Then you can probably tell right

text: They look at each other.
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: MADDY (CONT'D)
dialog: In Mozambique, you were part of a

dialog: hooked up with De Wente and started
dialog: trading guns for diamonds.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Is this on the record?
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: But you blew it all getting greedy
dialog: and trying to go it alone. Why?
text: He doesn't answer. They are looking at each other. The

speaker_heading: MADDY

speaker_heading: ARCHER

speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: Pour months. Before that Kosovo.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Okay. How many Blacks do you know

dialog: girl who cleans your house and the
dialog: man who picks up your garbage?
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: What's that got to do with it?
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: I know Blacks. Grew up with ‘em,
text: fought with ‘em. Behind the calm
text: eyes and the gentle smile, they're
dialog: burning with hate for what we've
dialog: done to ‘em. They hate you, hate me,
dialog: hate each other and hate themselves.
dialog: And your bleeding heart isn't gonna

speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: That doesn't make it right.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: No it doesn't. But apart from a few
dialog: do~gooders who show up for a week
dialog: with their flak jackets, their
text: laptops, and their little bottles of
dialog: hand sanitizer the White world doesn't
dialog: give a fuck about the Black world.
dialog: Look at Sudan. Look at Rwanda.

speaker_heading: ARCHER

text: Solomon instinctively looks to see if anyone is listening.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)

dialog: What are you talking about?
text: Archer removes his sunglasses, looks Solomon in the eye.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: What am I talking about?
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: I must go to work.
text: Archer follows as Solomon walks through the shantytown.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: My friend Fawaz paid an awfully large

speaker_heading: SOLOMON

scene_heading: 74 INT. EXECUTIVE HOTEL -- LATER THAT DAY 74
text: Solomon is carrying bags for Western businessmen frantic to
dialog: get out of Freetown before it's too late.
text: Depositing their bags in a taxi, he walks back into the lobby
text: to find Archer leaning against a post, smoking a cigarette.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Why would that R.U.F. captain with
text: the bandaged eye make up such a story.
text: Solomon again tries to ignore him.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you going to do, sell it
dialog: yourself? To who? For how much?
dialog: You need help, friend, whether you
dialog: want it or not.
text: Another porter is eavesdropping. Solomon escapes into the
text: alley beside the hotel, turns on Archer.
dialog: 42.
scene_heading: 75 EXT, ALLEY - CONTINUOUS 18
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: I know who you are. And what you
dialog: are. Men like you have turned my
dialog: country into a land of thieves and
dialog: killers. I do not need your help.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: What if I could help find your family?
text: At these words, something feral appears in Solomon's eyes.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: What do you know of my family?
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: The relief agencies are useless, the
text: hospitals are overwhelmed. There
dialog: are other ways.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Liar!
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: I know people. White people.
text: Solomon LUNGES -- pinning Archer against the wall. Archer
text: could fight. He doesn't.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: The...right...stone--
text: Solomon wants nothing more than to strangle him, but he also
text: intuits Archer might be his only hope. He relaxes his grip.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: -~-can buy anything. Information.
dialog: Safety. Even freedom. But a big
dialog: stone doesn't stay secret. The minute
dialog: you show it, your life is worthless.
dialog: I'm guessing the only reason you're
dialog: still alive is because you haven't
dialog: told anyone where it is. Right?
text: Archer's pitch -- fueled by desperation -- is mesmerizing.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: The last pink to come out of Africa
dialog: fetched ten million dollars. I know

speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Go. GO!
text: They begin to run.
text: THEY RUN THROUGH THE CITY 76
text: Their fates suddenly joined by the need to stay alive.
text: And death lurks at every corner.
text: Bands of teenagers roam the streets, FIRING AUTOMATIC WEAPONS
text: at anything that moves. Signs, store windows, cars. Urban
text: Rap dopplers past as trucks with boom boxes speed by.
text: At an intersection, an impromptu ROADBLOCK. People are pulled
text: out of cars and beaten while their cars are set on fire.
text: Archer and Solomon double back and sprint past the Executive
text: hotel where a gang of Rebels are entering. From inside comes
text: the sound of SCREAMING and more GUNFIRE.
text: People are being taken -- black and white alike -- and forced
text: into trucks. MINISTER SOMORA is led away at gunpoint.
dialog: 77
dialog: 78
dialog: 79
dialog: 44.
text: Women are dragged by the hair into alleyways. A man is thrown
text: out of a fourth-story window.
dialog: In fact, it was Much worse than anything we can ever show.
text: Archer _and Solomon continue to run for their lives.
text: Storefronts are looted. It's impossible to tell the rebels
text: from the civilians. Adults carry televisions. Two men carry
text: a barca-lounger. Teenage boys wear womens' wigs and throw
text: molotov cocktails made from Swedish vodka. Rebel teenagers
text: are sacking The Beach Bar -- drinking everything in sight.
text: Me'd lies dead, splayed across the bar.
text: Archer and Solomon run through the darkening streets as
text: rockets light up the sky.
text: A_gun battle between retreating government soidiers and
text: advancing rebels traps them in a crossfire.
text: They dive into a restaurant doorway, taking refuge with others
text: huddled, terrified, on the floor. Windows are shot out as
text: rounds rip in and plaster rains down on their heads.
text: After a deafening moment -- quiet. Archer watches through a
text: crack in the door as ECOMOG troops are lined up against a
text: wall and executed.
scene_heading: HOURS LATER - DARK AT LAST 77
text: Archer and Solomon set off again
text: They do their best to stay in shadows, hugging the walls of

speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: How...much.... farther?
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Sooner...or...later...we'll be in
dialog: the bush.
scene_heading: AN HALF-HOUR LATER 78
text: They are still running.
text: Both men are exhausted, filthy with soot and sweat, their

scene_heading: UP AHEAD - AN OPEN FIELD 79
text: And then another. Nothing beyond except a tangle of banana

speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: There--!
text: With renewed energy, they pick themselves up and run:
scene_heading: THE SOUND OF VOICES ~- CLOSE AT HAND
text: Sends them DIVING into a ditch.
text: Three R.U.F. soldiers are setting up a machine gun. Solomon
text: looks around wildly. There is nowhere to go. If they are
text: still there by daybreak, they will be discovered. If they
dialog: try to run, they will be shot.
text: A look of resolve steals over Archer's face as he reaches
text: into his boot for his knife. Without a backward glance, he
text: slithers out of the ditch.
text: THE KILLING OF THE THREE SOLDIERS 80
text: Is a deadly ballet. One's throat is slit, the second is
text: gutted. But his weapon FIRES -- alerting the third soldier,
text: who whirls -- just in time for his body to be stitched by
text: rounds from the dead man's AK-47 -- which Archer now holds.
text: It has all happened in a matter of seconds. But the gunfire
text: has alerted more soldiers from nearby.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: COME ON!
text: Archer and Solomon take off into the field -~ as TRACERS

text: AT LAST THEY BREAK INTO THE BRUSH 81
text: Vines whipping against their faces, thorns ripping their

text: At_last they stop.
text: Bent over double. Gasping for breath in the humid night.
dialog: Alive.
text: The two men look at one another. They could never articulate

dialog: journey of their lives.

speaker_heading: SOLOMON

speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: There's a relief camp in Port Loki.

speaker_heading: MADDY

speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: If you help me out.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: I knew it.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Before you say anything -- the man

dialog: fled -- wife and three children.
text: He's been trying to find them but

speaker_heading: MADDY

speaker_heading: ARCHER

speaker_heading: MADDY

speaker_heading: ARCHER

speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: Look around, Archer. What difference

text: He looks at her.
speaker_heading: MADDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus. Did I really say that?

scene_heading: EXT/INT. UNHCR HELICOPTER - DAY 85

scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER - SAME 86
text: Solomon, Archer and Maddy have hitched a ride on a U.N.

speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: At the moment, the second largest
dialog: refugee camp in Africa.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: My wife is here? In Guinea?
text: Maddy reads from the computer manifest in her hand.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: Jassie Vandy, Kono District. Crossed
dialog: into Guinea six weeks ago.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Six weeks. And my children?
text: Maddy hesitates, folds the manifest, then just nods.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: You would have found them. Sometimes

dialog: (glances at Archer)
dialog: I was lucky to get access to the
speaker_heading: UNHCR database.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON

scene_heading: EXT. REFUGEE CAMP - DAY 87
text: Archer, Solomon and Maddy step off the chopper to find-- A

text: REFUGEES rush the fence, pressing forward, shouting.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: This is what a million people look
dialog: like.
text: Solomon stares. These are his people.

dialog: 88
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: MADDY (CONT'D)
dialog: You might catch a minute of this on
dialog: CNN somewhere between weather and
dialog: sports.
text: As they approach the fence, Solomon sees that many of the_
text: refugees are AMPUTEES. Some reaching through the chain link
text: with stumps of arms. Solomon's heart is pounding.
speaker_heading: MADDY (CONT'D)
dialog: It says they're in Sector Two.
text: Solomon follows as Maddy shows her BADGE to a UN GUARD, who
text: reads her slip of paper and points out the right direction.
text: Archer stares through the fence at two KIDS, each with one
text: leg, yet managing to kick a plastic jug back and forth.
text: Other amputees stare sullenly. A sign reads, “NO PHOTOS FOR
scene_heading: JOURNALISTS WITHOUT $$$"
text: A WRINKLED OLD MAN blows his lips at Archer through the fence.
text: Archer walks on. The old man shadows him. Until Archer
text: realizes the fellow is gesturing to the cigarettes in his
text: shirt pocket. Archer takes out a cigarette, is about to
dialog: slip one through the fence --
text: When he sees the man has no hands.
text: Grimly, Archer sticks the cigarette in the man's mouth.
text: Then moves on.
scene_heading: EXT. REFUGEE CAMP - SECTOR TWO GATE - LATER 88

text: Archer has rejoined them. He notices Maddy's expression.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: What's wrong?
text: Maddy shakes her head. But Archer can tell she's keeping
text: something from him.
text: Solomon catches sight of the WFP monitor. He has a woman
text: with him. A woman carrying a little boy and a young girl.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Jassie ...?
dialog: (and then he's sure)
dialog: Jassie! JASSIE!
dialog: 51.
text: Jassie hears her name, looks up through the hordes of people.
speaker_heading: JASSIE
dialog: Solo! SOLO!!
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: JASSIE!!
text: Solomon's face morphs from disbelief to joy as Jassie runs
text: through a crush of bodies to him --
text: Their fingers GRASP each others through the fence. They run
text: their hands over each others faces, unable to speak.
text: Solomon looks at the one-year-old in her arms, an infant
text: when last he saw him. He touches him through the fence.
text: The girl, silent, offers a weak smile. She's seen too much.
text: Then Solomon looks around, puzzled.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON (CONT'D)
dialog: Dia?
dialog: (to Jassie, in Mende)
dialog: Where is Dia?
text: The boy is nowhere in sight.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ARCHER
text: He has a son who goes to school,

speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: There were only two children listed
text: on the manifest.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: --What?
text: Maddy turns away, her eyes brimming.
text: AT THE FENCE, Solomon reads Jassie's eyes.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Where is he!?
text: She rubs her cheek against his hand, her body trembling.
speaker_heading: JASSIE
dialog: They...took him.
text: Solomon looks at her, incomprehensibly. And the words come
text: out in a flood of Mende - that breaks into a WAIL of grief.
dialog: 89
dialog: 52.
text: Solomon drops to the ground as if every muscle in his body
text: had been cut. He struggles for breath.
text: Archer cannot watch their grief ... yet cannot turn away.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Fuck this
text: A GUARD tries to pry Solomon's hands from the fence, but he
text: won't let go. Sensing trouble, the guard calls ANOTHER GUARD
text: over. Both of them try to pull Solomon from the fence.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Let them out.
text: Jassie doesn't let go of her husband's hands.
speaker_heading: JASSIE
dialog: Solo ... Solo
text: Solomon starts shaking the fence.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Let them out!
text: The guards begin to beat his hands with their rifle butts.
text: But Solomon keeps shaking the fence as if to uproot the steel
dialog: posts.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON (CONT'D)
dialog: LET THEM OUT!
text: Archer puts himself between Solomon and the guards.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Get off him!

speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Fine! Just get off him!
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER - LATER 89

speaker_heading: MADDY

scene_heading: EXT. ECOMOG STAGING AREA - MASIAKA - EVENING 90

speaker_heading: ARCHER

speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: I pin it on all of us. Especially

speaker_heading: ARCHER

text: He looks over and sees that Solomon is CUTTING a line up one
text: arm with the machete, drawing blood.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: You understand, when we get to
dialog: Kailahun, we're gonna have to go

text: Solomon is lost in a world of ritual.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: (almost to himself)
dialog: My son is a very good student. He
text: walks five miles to the Sisters'
dialog: school every morning to study English.
dialog: He is going to be a doctor one day.
text: The pain of self-injury is an attempt to inure himself to
text: the pain of loss. He turns away to stare into the fire.
text: Archer has to walk away.
scene_heading: NEARBY - AN ABANDONED BUILDING 92
text: houses the paltry assortment of journalists. Archer walks

dialog: That diamond is the only chance he's

speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: You expect me to believe you give a

speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: No. I'm just exploiting his grief.

speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: I need to get to Kailahun. The only

scene_heading: 114 EXT. MENDE VILLAGE -- DAY 114
text: They emerge from the bush to discover a cluster of buildings
text: untouched by the ravages of war. Flowering gardens and neatly-
text: raked paths. After all they have seen, it seems dreamlike.
text: A GROUP OF CHILDREN
text: Emerge from the building and race toward them.
speaker_heading: MENDE CHILDREN
dialog: Where are you from? Have you come
dialog: from America? Do you have CD's?
text: A GENTLE VOICE calls out.
speaker_heading: GENTLE VOICE
dialog: Don't be bothering the people now.
dialog: Let them come in.
text: The children instantly obey. BENJAMIN KAPANAY appears in
text: doorway. He is a tall, sixty-five year-old distinguished-
text: looking Mende with a trim white beard.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: (in Mende; subtitles)
dialog: Thank you, Ubani. You can leave
dialog: them here. I take responsibility.
speaker_heading: KAMAJOR HEADMAN
dialog: {in Mende; subtitles)
dialog: Good. Now they are your problem.
text: The Kamajors back away, vanishing into the forest.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: If you're looking for money, weapons
dialog: or fuel, I don't have any.
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: How about food?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: If you ask politely. My name is
dialog: Benjamin Kapanay.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Danny Archer. And this is--
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: --Maddy Bowen. How do you do?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Very well, thank you. Chicago?
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: How--
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: --I recognize the accent.
dialog: (to Solomon; in Mende)
dialog: Welcome, Brother.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: (in Mende; subtitles)
dialog: I am Solomon Vandy, from Bo.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: (in Mende; subtitles)
dialog: What should I make of your companions?
text: Solomon doesn't know how to answer. He lies badly.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: (in Mende; subtitles)
dialog: They are... journalists.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: (in Mende; subtitles)
dialog: Ah. And I suppose you are, too.
text: Solomon looks away, ashamed. Benjamin turns to Maddy.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Might I interest you in a glass of
dialog: lemonade?
scene_heading: EXT. MENDE VILLAGE -- LUNCH 115
text: Under a covered porch, they eat lunch -- served by Benjamin's
text: young Mende wife and his three children.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: -- I don't understand why anyone
dialog: would willingly live in that cold.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
dialog: The wind off the lake. I cried every
dialog: night my first winter.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: How did you end up at Northwestern?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Because of President Kennedy, who
dialog: else?
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
text: By way of James McGrath, a young
dialog: Peace Corps volunteer from Winnetka --
text: who found a semi-literate Mende boy
dialog: and was foolish enough to believe he
dialog: could benefit from higher education.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: How long were you in the States?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Which time? I ended up getting my
dialog: Masters at Stanford -- better climate.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: But you came back?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: To show my people the way. Hah.
text: They are served a platter of vegetables by a well-mannered
text: ten year-old boy. Benjamin's son, UCHENNA.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you, Uchenna.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: You built this school?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Starting in 1967. Children from all
dialog: over the district find their way
dialog: here. Over five hundred graduates
dialog: since we began.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: That's remarkable. Would you mind
dialog: if I turned on my tape recorder.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: I'll make you a deal, Miss Bowen --
dialog: I give you an interview and you teach
dialog: at my school for a month.
dialog: 116
dialog: 117
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: I'd like that.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: But you won't do it.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: An honest journalist, how refeshing.
dialog: The truth is, I have done well to
dialog: keep a low profile. This is a very
dialog: dangerous part of the country with
text: the diamond mines so close by.
text: Solomon, meanwhile, hasn't been able to take his eyes off of
text: Benjamin's young son. The boy smiles back at him.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: My son wants to be a doctor.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Very good. Where is he now?
text: A silence.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: We don't know.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: I understand...
text: A SERIES OF IMAGES 116
text: Benjamin gives them a tour: a group of eight year-olds crowd
text: around a single computer; a ten year-old girl is being taught
text: to use an artificial limb; twelve year-old boys play cricket.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Many of these children were taken by
dialog: the R.U.F. We have taken them back.
dialog: (looks at Solomon)
dialog: Some of them have been made to do
dialog: horrible things. We are trying to
dialog: bring them back to life.
text: Solomon turns away to hide the surge of emotion.
scene_heading: LATER -- AT SUNSET 117
text: They sit drinking wine. The African sunset is inimitable.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: -- it was all very clear in 1964.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Political freedom plus economic
dialog: development equals happiness. But
dialog: sometimes revolution leads to chaos
dialog: and economic opportunity doesn't
dialog: necessarily bring out the best in
dialog: people. Certain personality types
dialog: realized freedom could be another
dialog: name for greed.
dialog: (raises his glass)
dialog: And here we are.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: But look what you've accomplished.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: And look what good it has done my
dialog: country...
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: "There is no easy walk to freedom."
dialog: We can only do the best we can.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Mandela. His best is a bit better
dialog: than mine...
text: He takes a long look at his children.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Had many attacks in the area?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: I've known most of the young people
dialog: in this district since they were
text: born. The local commander is still
dialog: afraid I'll come after him with my
dialog: ruler.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: You think because your intentions
dialog: are good they'll spare you?
text: Benjamin takes the question in stride.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: My heart always told me that people
dialog: are inherently good. My experience
dialog: suggests otherwise. Which to believe?
text: Benjamin turns his penetrating gaze on Archer.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
dialog: What about you, Mr. Archer? In your
dialog: long career as a...journalist...
dialog: Would you say people are mostly good?
dialog: 68.
text: Archer stares back. The SOUND of A CHILDREN'S CHOIR...
scene_heading: IN THE CENTER OF THE VILLAGE -- THAT NIGHT 118
text: The children are singing "High We Exult Thee, Realm of the
dialog: Free," the national anthem of Sierra Leone. Solomon and
text: Maddy sit with Benjamin and his family.
text: Maddy sees Archer get up and walk away.
text: AT THE EDGE OF THE COMPOUND 119
text: Archer stands alone. He takes a long pull from a plastic
text: jug. Maddy steps out from the shadows.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
text: Palm wine. Sap comes right out of
dialog: the tree.
text: He offers to her and she takes a swig. Makes a face.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: You get used to it.
text: He takes another long drink. He's pretty drunk.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Drank this as a boy.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: Rhodesia.
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: I take notes.
text: Indeed, her little spiral notebook is already in hand. He
text: looks at her ~- considering -- then, what the hell...
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: I got sent to South Africa when the
text: muntz overran the farm in '76.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: --After you lost your parents.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: (dark laugh)
dialog: That's a polite way of putting it.
dialog: Mum was raped. Dad was decapitated
text: and hung from a hook in the barn.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: You were, what, ten years old?
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Nine. Boo-hoo.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: Then at eighteen you joined the
dialog: army...
text: Archer peers at her.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Want to hear about the first time I
dialog: banged a journalist?
text: She just looks at him. He takes another long drink. Relents.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Yah, yah. First they had us doing
dialog: dirty little jobs in the townships.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: With the Security services.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: You think you know about the Security
dialog: services?
dialog: (another dark laugh)
dialog: You don't know shite. That was a
dialog: picnic compared to what we did on
dialog: the Moz border. Sometimes I think,
dialog: ‘God will forgive us for what we
dialog: did.' Then I look around and I
dialog: wonder...what would God want with a
dialog: Place like this?
text: He takes another drink but the jug is empty. He tosses it.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: By '94 I'ma ten years vet. Then
dialog: poof. No more apartheid, no more
dialog: army. Thanks very much, see ya later.
dialog: Truth and reconciliation. Kumbaya.
text: He raises his middle finger in a universal gesture.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: They told us we were fighting
dialog: Communism. Protecting our ‘way of
dialog: life.’
dialog: (a rueful laugh)
dialog: It's about who gets what. Oil.
dialog: Coltan. Diamonds. So one day I
dialog: decided, fuck it, now I want mine.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: Are you going to steal his diamond?
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: We have no chance in hell of getting
dialog: the diamond.
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: Doesn't answer the question.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: That diamond -- whether I steal it
dialog: or just take the commission -- is my
dialog: ticket out of here.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: To go where?
text: Archer hasn't gotten that far in his thinking.
scene_heading: EXT. HILL COUNTRY - NEXT MORNING (SEEN FROM ABOVE) 120
text: Benjamin drives them down roads that are little more than
text: animal tracks. Bush pigs scamper. Chimpanzees chatter above.
text: Solomon looks up into the canopy of forest as the sun darts
text: in and out of view.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON (V.0O.)
dialog: Dear Dia. I have found a place for
dialog: your studies once you return home.
text: Benjamin shows Maddy the hippos splashing in the river.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Do not be fooled by the movie where
text: they wear pink skirts and dance on
dialog: their toes. They are extremely
text: dangerous, easily angered, and very
dialog: fast.
text: Benjamin's love of all that he sees is infectious. As he
text: plays tour guide, they forget for a moment their dire
text: circumstances and surrender to the joys of the natural world.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON (V.0O.)
dialog: There is a man I want you to meet.
dialog: He is a teacher. You will like him.
text: Benjamin turns a wry eye to Archer.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: What story will you be covering when
dialog: I drop you in Kailahun, Mr. Archer?
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Thank you for your help, Mr. Kapanay.
dialog: I won't forget it.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: I hope the story will end the way
dialog: you want it to.
dialog: 71.
scene_heading: 121 UP AHEAD - A TEMPORARY ROADBLOCK 121
text: guarded by TWO TWELVE YEAR-OLD CHILD SOLDIERS.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Keep going.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: What--?
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Drive right at them. They'll panic.
text: Instead Benjamin slows the car.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Do you know where the word, ‘infantry'
dialog: comes from? It means child soldier.
dialog: They are just children.
scene_heading: THE TWO R.U.F. SOLDIERS
text: are indeed children. One wears a Michael Jordan jersey, the
text: other has skateboard stickers on his Ingram submachine gun.
text: But their eyes are glazed and deadened.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello, little brothers. What are
dialog: your names?
speaker_heading: CHILD SOLDIER #1
dialog: I am Dead Body. Who dis mothafuckah?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: We are teachers on our way to
dialog: Kailahun.
speaker_heading: CHILD SOLDIER #2
dialog: Only R.U.F on da road!
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: I understand but we have to--
speaker_heading: CHILD SOLDIER #2
scene_heading: ONLY R.U.F!
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Now listen here! I am-~
text: The boy FIRES HIS WEAPON without warning. Benjamin is hit
text: in the chest.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
text: JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!
dialog: 122
dialog: 123
dialog: 125
dialog: 72.
text: He leans over and STOMPS ON THE GAS PEDAL. The car LURCHES
text: FORWARD, knocking aside the other boy. Archer has to
text: practically straddle the wounded man to speed away.
scene_heading: IN THE CAR (TRAVELING) "122
text: Benjamin tries to speak. Blood bubbles from his lips.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Do NOT try to talk. If you're not
dialog: dead, it's only because you're hit
dialog: in the lung not the heart.
text: Solomon is leaning over the seat, opening Benjamin's shirt.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Solomon)
dialog: Don't worry about the entry wound.
dialog: Lean him forward, there's going to
text: be a big hole in his back. Press
dialog: your hand against it. Keep it there.
dialog: (to Maddy)
dialog: If there's any wine left in that
dialog: jug, pour it all over everything.
dialog: (to Benjamin)
dialog: How far to Kailahun?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: You...said...not to talk.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: A fucking comedian.
text: He pushes the old car's accelerator to its limit.
scene_heading: IN THE CAR (TRAVELING) -- DUSK 123
text: Benjamin is slumped, unconscious, against the passenger door.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: How's his pulse?
speaker_heading: MADDY
text: It's a pulse.
scene_heading: ROUNDING A BEND 124
text: They are suddenly confronted by two ARMORED CARS and a platoon
text: of white mercenaries carrying Uzi's. The soldiers all wear
text: maroon berets with the initials E.O.
scene_heading: MOMENTS LATER - TWO MEDICS ATTACH AN IV TO BENJAMIN 125
text: Archer and Solomon help place him on a litter. He is
text: conscious again.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: You'll be all right.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: (looks him in the eye)
dialog: Will you?
text: He is hurried away as--
text: AN ATTACK HELICOPTER TAKES OFF NEARBY
text: Raising a cloud of dust. Joost appears out of the confusion.
dialog: Joost
dialog: Archer...what the fuck--
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Good to see you, too, Joost.
text: Maddy is furiously scribbling notes of all she sees.
dialog: Joos?
dialog: We're evacuating all non-military
dialog: personnel. Relief workers,
dialog: journalists.
dialog: (to Archer)
dialog: Shite-bags.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: How far's the front line?
speaker_heading: JOOST
text: There is no front line. Little
text: buggers are everywhere.
dialog: (starts off)
dialog: Colonel's this way.
scene_heading: 126 THE COLONEL'S HQ 126
text: A large tent. The Colonel pores over a map while talking on
text: a SAT-phone. Archer and Joost enter.
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: ~-but if we block their escape by
dialog: cutting the bridge--
dialog: (sees Archer)
dialog: Wait One...
dialog: (covers the mouthpiece)
dialog: Archer. Don't want to say I told
dialog: you so--
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: But you will.
dialog: 74,
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: The Sierra Leone government has hired
dialog: us to recapture the diamond mines.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: In return for a mining concession or
dialog: two, no doubt.
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: {a modest nod)
dialog: I've got a C-130 touching down at
dialog: 1400. Everybody not prepared to get
text: dirty is on it.
dialog: (checks his watch)
dialog: You've got thirty minutes to make up
dialog: your mind. You're either with us or
dialog: out of here.
text: He turns back to his conversation. Archer is dismissed.
scene_heading: 127 EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CAMP -- NIGHT 127
text: Maddy is waiting as Archer walks back.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: How is he?
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: They say he'll live.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: You're on a plane for Ghana in half
dialog: an hour.
dialog: (looks at her)
dialog: Do me one last favor.
text: Maddy just looks at him. Archer indicates a young MERCENARY
text: standing guard in front of a large supply tent.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Go tell that guard you want to put
text: his face on the cover of Soldier of
dialog: Fortune magazine.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: You're going in.
dialog: (Archer nods)
dialog: You and Solomon.
text: Archer nods again. She shakes her head.
speaker_heading: MADDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Now?
dialog: (another nod)
dialog: You're an idiot.
dialog: 128
dialog: 129
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Help me or not?
text: Maddy shakes her head sadly. She turns away, pushing the
text: hair out of her face as she approaches the YOUNG MERCENARY.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: Hi, there. Maddy Bowen, Vanity Fair.
dialog: You mind if I ask you a few questions?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MERCENARY
dialog: Depends what they are-~-
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: Oh, So you're familiar with our
dialog: devious ways, are you?
text: She flashes a devastating smile. And while his back is
text: turned, we SEE Archer edge past toward the back of the tent.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE SUPPLY TENT 128
text: Archer forages for whatever he can lay his hands on. Into
text: his pack he stuffs K-rations, a GPS, first-aid kit.
text: He desperately looks for one more thing. And there it is.
text: A SaAT-phone. He stuffs it in. Outside, the SOUND of a plane.
scene_heading: EXT. AIRSTRIP -- MOMENTS LATER 129
text: A giant C-130 Hercules touches down.
scene_heading: THE SWARM OF JOURNALISTS
text: Aid workers, and refugees surge onto the tarmac. Carrying
text: her bag, Maddy moves against the tide, looking around.
text: Solomon appears beside her, subtly taking her arn.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: This way.
text: ARCHER is waiting behind a tent, the pack already on his
text: shoulders. She turns to Solomon.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: Good luck to you, Solomon Bo.
text: Solomon takes her hand in both of his.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Thank you for all you've done.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: I hope you find what you're looking
dialog: for.
text: She turns to Archer. They look at each other.
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Yeah. Thanks.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: --dJust keeping my end of the deal.
text: A moment of silence. She can be as tough as he can.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Listen--
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: No, you listen--
text: And they just stare at each other.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: In another life, maybe.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: Sure... Okay...
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Find yourself a good man, Maddy.
dialog: You deserve to be happy.
text: She considers him -- wishing she were less affected by him.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: I have three sisters. All married
dialog: to “good men." Long as their
dialog: prescriptions are filled they're
dialog: happy. No thanks. I prefer my life.
dialog: (hands him her card)
dialog: Office phone, home phone, cell phone.
dialog: I'm used to being pursued, but what
dialog: the hell.
text: He smiles.
speaker_heading: MADDY (CONT'D)
dialog: It's a world phone, by the way.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: You should get on the plane.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: So should you.
text: He smiles and turns away.
speaker_heading: MADDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you going to call me?
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Soon as I'm near a phone...
dialog: 130
dialog: 131
dialog: 132
dialog: 133
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: Yeah, right.
text: She turns toward the plane. They head the opposite way.
scene_heading: IN THE BUSH 130
text: Archer and Solomon begin to jog.
scene_heading: BACK AT THE AIRSTRIP 131
text: Maddy is about to board the plane when Joost waylays her.
speaker_heading: JOOST
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: Where is who?
text: She continues up the steps to the plane. Joost looks around.
text: No sign of Archer. The wheels begin to turn in his head.
scene_heading: ARCHER AND SOLOMON TREK 132
text: into the bush. They move quickly, putting distance between
text: themselves and the E.O.camp. As they run, THE CAMERA rises
text: up, higher and higher, until their tiny figures have
text: disappeared and the FRAME IS FILLED WITH NOTHING BUT GREEN.
dialog: We sense of the immensity of the challenge that lies ahead.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BUSH -- LATER 133
text: Archer and Solomon have stopped to catch their breath. Archer
text: digs out the SAT-phone, fires it up and punches in a number.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: ..-Fawaz? ...1 know. No time now....
dialog: That's right....Two days to get in,
dialog: one to get out. I'11 call when we're
dialog: headed for the strip. Right... ‘Bye.
text: He looks up to see if Solomon has been listening. But Solomon
text: is staring off into the jungle.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON (V.0,)
dialog: Dear Dia. I am coming. With every
dialog: step I am closer. I can feel you
dialog: are nearby. I am coming soon.
scene_heading: EXT. A JUNGLE TRAIL -- ELSEWHERE 134
text: A column of R.U.F. guerrillas walk a jungle trail. We can

dialog: 138
dialog: 78.
scene_heading: BACK TO ARCHER AND SOLOMON 135
text: as he stuffs the SAT-phone into his back. He sets off without
text: a word, knowing Solomon will follow.
scene_heading: THEY TRAVEL BY NIGHT 136
text: On narrow dirt roads, lit only by the moon.
scene_heading: HEADLIGHTS APPROACH 137
text: Archer and Solomon take cover as TRUCKS pass filled with
text: R.U.F. teenagers, laughing, smoking ganja, music blasting.
text: Solomon studies each passing face. Almost involuntarily he
text: rises to his feet -~ trying to get a better look. Suddenly
text: he thinks he sees a familiar face -~ could it be Dia? He
text: moves closer -- but the truck is moving away.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Dia!!
text: Heads turn in the passing truck. It's not Dia.
text: Suddenly Solomon is grabbed from behind and thrown to the
text: ground. Archer looms over him.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: What the fuck are you doing!!
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: GET OFF ME!
text: Meanwhile, on the road, the trucks have slowed. Suddenly--
text: THE BRUSH EXPLODES WITH GUNFIRE
text: Red and Green TRACERS shred the dense foliage around them.
text: Bullets WHIZ by their heads, RICOCHET off ancient trees.
text: They scramble to their feet and race blindly back into the
text: bush. Behind them, the SOUND of their pursuers.
text: Soon the brush grows more dense. In the pitch darkness they
text: are literally fighting their way forward, flailing with both
text: arms to rip holes through the thick foliage. Their hands
text: and faces are soon cut and bleeding.
speaker_heading: THEY RUN 138
text: Until they can run no further. Archer stumbles and falls.
text: Solomon crumples to the ground beside him. As they lie there,
text: winded, they HEAR VOICES.
text: They can see the GLOW OF CIGARETTES through the foliage only
text: a few yards away as R.U.F. soldiers approach.
dialog: 139
dialog: 79,
scene_heading: ON SOLOMON AND ARCHER
text: as the soldiers’ boots pass within inches of their hiding
text: place. They bury their faces deeper in the mud.
speaker_heading: DAYBREAK 139
text: finds them still hiding. Cautiously, they emerge -- stiff,
text: wet, and miserable from a night spent on the jungle floor.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: (furious)
dialog: Next time you pull something like
dialog: that I will shoot you myself.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: (equally furious)
dialog: Shoot me now. It is what you are
dialog: planning anyway.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: You think I do not know the kind of
dialog: Man you are? You buy diamonds from
dialog: the same people who took my son.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: --Maddy told you.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Is this true?
text: Archer looks at him.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Yes. It is true.
speaker_heading: . SOLOMON
dialog: And all you have said... How the
dialog: diamond will free my family. This,
dialog: too, is a lie. Is it not?
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: I don't know. Maybe.
dialog: (looks at him)
dialog: But I'm not the only one who tells
dialog: lies, am I?
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: I do not lie.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: No? You don't give a fuck about
dialog: finding the diamond.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 140
dialog: 141
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: You're out here looking for your
dialog: son. And you'd cut my heart out in
dialog: a second if it means a chance to get
dialog: him back.
text: Solomon is shocked into silence. Archer is right.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Yes. It is true.
text: The two men stare at each other.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Long as we understand each other.
text: He sets off into the brush, limping heavily.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: You are hurt.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: (without looking back)
dialog: I'm fine.
text: Solomon reaches to take the heavy pack from Archer's shoulder.
text: Archer grabs his hand. They lock eyes for a moment.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: You think I'm going to steal it?
text: Archer turns and walks away. Solomon looks down to see BRIGHT
text: DROPS OF BLOOD from Archer's boot staining the ground.
scene_heading: LATER - THE UNMISTAKABLE SOUND OF APPROACHING HELICOPTERS 140
text: forces them to take cover. Two E.O. gunships streak past.
text: Are the choppers looking for them, or is it a coincidence?
scene_heading: LATER THAT DAY - THE SUN HAS REACHED ITS ZENITH 1421
text: as they trudge onward. Archer's limp is more pronounced.
text: He tips back his canteen and finds it empty. Solomon notices.
text: He passes his canteen to Archer, who hesitates for a moment,
text: then laughs and puts his mouth to a black man's canteen.
scene_heading: LATER - THEY TRAVERSE A HIGH RIDGE 142
text: In the distance, we see the receding peaks. Archer begins a
text: conversation, as much out of boredom as anything else.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: So you're a farmer...
text: Solomon looks at him warily. Nods.
dialog: 143
dialog: 144
dialog: gl.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you grow?
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: teeeee Casava.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: I grew up on a farn.
dialog: (remembering...)
dialog: Hated every minute of it.
text: End of conversation. They walk on in silence.
scene_heading: STILL LATER - DEEP PITS IN THE EARTH 143
text: Begin to appear as Archer and Solomon climb through a hilly
text: landscape. Solomon stares at the diamond mines.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
text: It is like they are eating the earth.
text: He walks on. Archer labors to keep up with Solomon's pace.
speaker_heading: ABANDONED HOUSES 144
text: caved-in and listing, line a street where deep pits have
text: been dug beneath their foundations. Impoverished SQUATTERS
text: follow them with listless, hungry eyes as they pass.
text: Archer is jittery to be observed. But in Africa, people are
text: everywhere. Blood squishes in his boot as he walks.
speaker_heading: BY SUNSET 145
text: They have been walking for twelve hours. Archer has to sit.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: How much farther--?
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: One day more.
text: He kneels before Archer.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON (CONT'D)
dialog: Let me see your leg.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: It's fine.
text: Solomon touches it and Archer GRUNTS in pain.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
text: It's infected. From lying there all
dialog: fucking night.
text: Solomon lifts Archer's pant leg. Examines it.
dialog: 146
dialog: 147
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Give me your knife.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
text: In the other boot.
text: Solomon takes the K-Bar. Archer grits his teeth. We cannot
text: see what Solomon does -- but from the expression on Archer's
dialog: face, we can only imagine.
text: Solomon stands. Archer tries to but the pain is overwhelming.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: I will be back.
text: Archer pulls his Sig-Sauer 9mm from his belt.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: No--
text: Solomon starts walking away. COCKS the weapon.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: You think I won't shoot you.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Shoot me, then. And try to find the
dialog: diamond yourself.
dialog: (keeps walking)
dialog: IT will be back.
scene_heading: LATER THAT NIGHT ~ A SMALL VILLAGE 146
text: has been taken over by CHILD SOLDIERS. They sit, throwing
text: bullets into a barrel fire and LAUGHING as they explode.
text: Solomon creeps to the edge of a hut -- peering at the faces.
dialog: No Dia.
text: Six more teenagers are loading the spoils of the village
text: onto a truck. One of them could be Dia. He isn't.
scene_heading: HOURS LATER - THE MOON HAS RISEN 147
text: Archer awakens to see Solomon walking toward him out of the
text: bush. He carries a poultice made of leaves and mud.
text: He kneels and begins to apply it to Archer's wound.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: I thought about not coming back.
dialog: (looks at him)
dialog: I talked to my son about it.
text: Archer looks at him. What the hell is he talking about?
dialog: 148
dialog: 149
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON (CONT'D)
dialog: I talk to him all the time.
dialog: (works on the leg)
dialog: He says I must forgive what you have
dialog: done in the past. And trust that
dialog: you will help get my family back.
text: Archer doesn't know how to respond to this simple absolution.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: You're fucking crazy.
text: Solomon finishes wrapping the poultice.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: I will go and find us water.
text: He stands again and walks away.
text: Archer can't bear feeling powerless. Fighting the pain, he
text: stands and tries to walk. It's excruciating. Still he
text: continues hobbling -- until finally he sits on the ground,
scene_heading: CAPE TOWN AIRPORT TERMINAL -- NIGHT 148
text: Maddy de-planes with a contingent of journalists. Like
text: everyone else who gets off a plane these days, she turns on
text: her cell phone to check for messages. There are none.
dialog: Archer hasn't called.
scene_heading: DAWN IN THE JUNGLE 149
text: is soft and full of promise. Low clouds hang just above the
text: treetops as first light touches the moist greenery.
text: Archer's face is at peace as he wakes. Solomon sleeps nearby.
text: Archer reaches to scratch his nose and realizes he is covered
text: with BLACK ANTS. Scrambling to his knees, he frantically
text: brushes them off. They are in his ears, inside his shirt.
text: Solomon awakens and begins to laugh at Archer's frenzy.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Tt HATE FUCKING ANTS!
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: I think you are feeling better.
text: And then Solomon realizes that he, too, is infested. He
text: reaches into his pants and begins to hop around. Now it's
text: Archer's turn to laugh.
text: Soon they are both sitting on the ground, LAUGHING for no
dialog: reason -- except, of Course, as a release from all that has
text: befallen them.
dialog: 84.
scene_heading: THE ENDLESS HILLS 150
text: glow pink in the dawn as they walk. A herd of antelope burst
text: from the brush and bound majestically away.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: ++.¥ou are how old?
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Me? Thirty. One.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: And you have no wife?
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: No children?
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: No.
text: Solomon shakes his head. After a moment, Archer can‘t resist.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: --What?
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Truly, I do not understand white
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: That makes two of us.
text: AS THEY CREST A HILL
text: Solomon suddenly stops. He looks around. Then he falls to
text: his knees. Archer climbs to where he is and looks around--
speaker_heading: A MASS GRAVE
text: has been fashioned from an abandoned diamond pit. BODIES
text: piled high -- men, women, children. None of them soldiers.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Animals.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: No animal would ever do such a thing.
dialog: It makes no sense.
text: Solomon forces himself to walk among the corpses, praying
text: that his son is not among them. Tears stream down his cheeks.
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON (CONT'D)
dialog: My people value life. The Mende
dialog: find it hard even to take the life
dialog: of a chicken. God gives life; only
dialog: he may take it back.
dialog: {a strangled cry)
dialog: How can they do this?
text: Archer has no answer. Just looks at him.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON (CONT'D)
dialog: (numbly)
dialog: Why is there so much evil here?
dialog: What is wrong with us?
scene_heading: 151 HOURS LATER 151
text: Archer uses a tree branch as a cane.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: (feeling his forehead)
dialog: I've stopped sweating. We've got to
dialog: find water.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Then we must move faster.
text: Archer nods and pushes himself past the pain in his leg.
dialog: o
scene_heading: 152 HOURS LATER - THE SUN IS SCORCHING AT MID-DAY 152
text: Archer stumbles. Solomon offers a hand to lift him to his
text: feet. Archer ignores it. Ahead is a CLEARING, and in it:
scene_heading: A BULL ELEPHANT
text: stands tall and menacing. Beside him, on the ground, is his
text: Mate -- grievously wounded and BELLOWING piteously.
text: For a moment, Archer and Solomon are too stunned to speak.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Back away. And watch where you step.
text: Solomon freezes.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Is it--
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: A minefield. Yes.
text: They stare at the MAGNIFICENT CREATURE who refuses to leave
text: his fallen mate. Slowly they retrace their steps.
text: —~ No sooner have they turned their backs than AN EXPLOSION
text: shakes the ground and A FLOCK OF BIRDS rises over the field.
dialog: 153
dialog: 154
dialog: 86.
text: They know what it means. Grimly, they keep moving.
scene_heading: THE JUNGLE AT NIGHT 153
text: is a freaky place at the best of times with strange shapes
text: shadows, and noises everywhere. In their state, it feels
text: like a bad acid trip. Solomon hears the WHISPERED VOICE of
text: his son. He carries on an imagined conversation.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: ....Why? The cows will do fine in
dialog: the upper pasture...
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Hey...
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: (in a kind of trance)
dialog: -- Yes. And next year we will plant
dialog: coffee--
speaker_heading: ARCHER
speaker_heading: HEY!
dialog: (Solomon is startled)
dialog: You're hallucinating.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: No. I am not.
scene_heading: HOURS LATER - ARCHER 154
text: Archer is half-asleep as they trudge through deep jungle.
text: He stops suddenly. A SNAKE hangs menacingly from a tree.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Do you see that?
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: The. ..snake.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Good.
text: Archer now sees that it is only a tree branch.
text: THEY WALK ON FOR A MOMENT
text: This time it is Solomon who stops short.
dialog: 155
dialog: 156
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Wait...
dialog: (listening)
dialog: Can you hear it?
text: Archer listens hard. A weird croaking sound. Frogs?
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Progs!!
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: YES!
text: Frogs mean water. They stumble forward to discover--
text: A SMALL STREAM BED
text: They fling themselves onto their bellies and begin to drink.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: What if...this water...is bad?
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: You can wait for beer.
text: Good point. Archer drinks his fill.
scene_heading: THE NEXT MORNING 155
text: Finds them sitting by the stream. Archer studies his map.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: This must be the Meli. It runs from
dialog: the North. The Moa runs from the
dialog: East. Where the rivers meet is where
dialog: the mine is, right?
text: Solomon says nothing.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Right?
text: Solomon just glares at him.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: You get that diamond, you can hire a
dialog: team of people to find him. You can
dialog: buy the whole damn government!
dialog: (leaning in)
dialog: What are you gonna do, spend the
dialog: rest of your life searching the bush?
text: Solomon looks at him. Yes. If necessary.
scene_heading: HOURS LATER - THEY FOLLOW THE STREAM 156
text: now grown into a broad river.
dialog: 157
dialog: 88.
scene_heading: HOURS LATER - THEY CLIMB A STEEP RAVINE 157
text: Archer is struggling. Once again, Solomon offers a hand to
text: help him over a boulder. This time, Archer grudgingly accepts
text: the hand. The moment is underplayed but deeply significant.
text: Cresting a hill, Solomon looks down on the confluence of the
text: two rivers. A familiar gorge.
scene_heading: SOLOMON'S POV - THE DIAMOND MINING CAMP
text: is spread out below. HOLES and PITS pock the landscape.
text: Archer joins him at the overlook.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: That's it, isn't it?
text: Solomon's face is clouded with memory. It's a place from his
dialog: nightmares. A place he hoped never to see again.
text: A LARGE CONTINGENT OF R.U.F. TROOPS
text: is encamped near the mines. Archer can see dozens of tiny
text: fires with troops huddled beside them.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Christ.
text: He kneels -- trying to figure out their next move.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay...
text: He digs into his pack for the SAT-phone.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: The E.O. would want to know about a
dialog: force this size. If I call Joost,
dialog: he'll send in an air strike...
dialog: (the plan unfolds)
dialog: We use it as a diversion.
text: Below them, TEENAGE REBELS play soccer in a ragged field.
text: Is Dia among them? It is too far away to know.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: No air strike.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: How do we get in there without some
dialog: kind of diversion?
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: No...air...strike.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
text: He isn't down there.
dialog: 158
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: (coldly)
dialog: I'm calling it in.
dialog: (turns on SAT-phone)
text: They'1l come in at first light.
dialog: Low. Over that ridge. That's how
dialog: Much time you've got.
text: Solomon turns and starts down the hill.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Hold up there, boy--!
text: Solomon reacts to Archer's instinctive use of "boy."
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm not letting you get yourself
dialog: killed until I have that fucking
text: stone. We wait for dark.
text: A LIST OF CALL NUMBERS is taped to the inside of the SAT-
text: phone's case. Archer punches in a number.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: (on the SAT-phone)
dialog: Get me Joost..... Archer....He'll
dialog: know-- Ask if he's interested in the
dialog: location of a major R.U.F. camp......
scene_heading: LATER -- THE DIAMOND CAMP -- NIGHT 158
text: is just as we remember it. Muddy and exhausted SLAVE WORKERS
text: try to keep out of A DRIVING RAIN, squatting under corrugated
text: tin roofs while eating their tiny portion of rice gruel.
text: Rebel soldiers -- adults and teenagers alike -- eat Red Cross
text: rations while trying to keep warm and dry.
speaker_heading: ARCHER AND SOLOMON
text: have crawled forward to the edge of the camp.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: I can't walk in there. you stay in
dialog: my line of sight and I'll cover you.
dialog: If he's not there, we move around
text: the perimeter. The air strike happens
text: at 0600.
dialog: (racks the slide of
dialog: his Sig-Sauer)
dialog: You do exactly as I say. And don't
dialog: mistake me for your friend. You
dialog: fuck with me and I'll surely kill
dialog: you.
dialog: 159
dialog: 161
dialog: 162
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: A SENTRY
text: huddles miserably in the rain.
text: Archer SPRINGS out of the shadows and choke-holds him --
text: then drags him back into the bushes where Solomon is hiding.
text: Archer takes his weapon - an H&K assault rifle.
text: Solomon stands up and walks into the camp as inconspicuously
text: as possible. Archer watches under cover of the brush as:
speaker_heading: SOLOMON 159
text: insinuates himself among the miserable workers, moving from
text: hut to hut -- trying to see if Dia is among them.
text: He isn't. Solomon moves deeper into the village.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
text: curses as Solomon walks out of his line of sight.
speaker_heading: IN THE CAMP 160
text: Solomon is about to give up hope, when--
text: HE SEES DIA. Solomon blinks back his disbelief.
dialog: 
text: Dia's with TWO OLDER REBELS, who are watching him take a hit
text: from a big spliff, laughing as he chokes on the smoke.
text: Solomon tries to will Dia to turn in his direction.
speaker_heading: ARCHER 161
text: Scuttles through the bush -- trying to get a line of sight.
scene_heading: EXT. TWO SENTRIES 162
text: appear nearby -- carrying food for the sentry Archer has
text: killed. Unable to find him, they begin to CALL out for him.
speaker_heading: IN THE CAMP 163
text: Dia and the other soldiers separate. Solomon moves out from
text: the shadows.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Dia--
text: Dia turns -- uncomprehending.
text: Solomon takes his arm.
dialog: 165
dialog: 166
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: DIA
dialog: (suddenly fearful)
dialog: NO!
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Dia, it's me!
text: Three months of horror, of depravation, of trauma, of
dialog: unspeakable acts have taken root in the soul of this young
text: boy. His face contorts in struggle. Then--
speaker_heading: DIA
dialog: GET AWAY FROM ME! GET AWAY!
dialog: (screaming)
scene_heading: FARMER! TRAITOR!
text: He tries to break free of Solomon's grasp. A few other
text: soldiers HEAR him cry out. They turn to look.
speaker_heading: ARCHER 164
text: hears it as well. He steps from his hiding place -- trying
dialog: to see what is happening.
scene_heading: AN R.U.F. SOLDIER 165
text: sees Solomon holding Dia by the arm. He HITS HIM IN THE
text: BACK with his rifle butt. Solomon crumples to the ground.
speaker_heading: ARCHER 166
text: aims the assault rifle, but the GUARDS have picked up Solomon
text: and -- at sixty yards, at night, in the driving rain --
dialog: there's no way Archer can get off a clean shot. Then--
text: The SOUND of a SLIDE being racked. The barrel of an AK-47
text: is placed against Archer's head.
scene_heading: EXT, THE REBEL CAMP -- NEXT MORNING 167
text: Solomon's arms have been TIED behind his back -- the rope
text: looped over a tree branch and re-tied. He looks up to see--
text: DIA, standing with several guards. His face is hard and
text: withdrawn. He turns away from Solomon's gaze.
text: A SHOVEL is thrown at Solomon's feet.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I knew you would come back.
text: Solomon looks up into the disfigured face of CAPTAIN POISON.
text: A brutal scar only adds to the malice in his eyes.
text: Poison motions to the dozens of HOLES that pock the landscape --
text: giant scars of diamond fields that have been mined out.
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: POISON
dialog: See how I have dug. I have found
dialog: nothing.
dialog: (to Solomon)
dialog: You will dig again for me. You will
dialog: dig up what you have come back for.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: POISON
dialog: No? Do you think the white man will
dialog: rescue you?
text: He turns Solomon's head violently to the left, where:
speaker_heading: ARCHER
text: Has been made to kneel, arms tied behind his back, head to
text: the ground, with a gun held to the back of his skull.
speaker_heading: POISON (CONT'D)
dialog: This white man is the cause of your
dialog: suffering. This white man, his
dialog: masters abroad -- and his black
text: puppets in the government.
text: Poison whips out a dog-eared manifesto from his army jacket.
speaker_heading: POISON (CONT'D)
dialog: FPoday Sankoh say -- resist and
dialog: overthrow those who would exploit
dialog: you! Shed their blood.
text: He slaps Solomon's head with the book.
speaker_heading: POISON (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe some more digging will help
dialog: you learn this lesson.
text: The rope holding Solomon is cut. He falls to the ground and
text: is prodded to his feet by several SOLDIERS holding Ak-47's.
text: Solomon looks down at the shovel. But doesn't move.
text: Surreptitiously Archer glances at his watch. It is 5:59.
speaker_heading: POISON (CONT'D)
dialog: Pick it up.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Why? You are going to kill me anyway.
text: With a sigh, Poison whispers in Solomon's ear:
dialog: 168
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: POISON
dialog: I do not need to kill you, Solomon
dialog: Vandy. Because now you have a name.
dialog: And a family. If you do not give me
dialog: this diamond, I will find this family --
dialog: just as I have found your son.
text: He goes to Dia and puts his arm around him.
speaker_heading: POISON (CONT'D)
dialog: I will rape your wife in front of
dialog: you, then slit her throat.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: And I will keep your daughters for
dialog: myself.
dialog: It_is the first time we have seen the light go out of
text: Solomon's eyes -- in part because of Poison's words, but
text: mostly because of Dia's look of indifference.
speaker_heading: POISON (CONT'D)
dialog: You think I am a devil. But only
dialog: because I have lived in hell. I
dialog: want to get out. You will help me.
dialog: Curiously enough, these words could have been Archer's when
text: first we met him. He watches as:
text: Solomon takes the shovel. All his hopes and dreams end here.
text: He is must dig the earth one last time to save his family.
text: He looks out at the jungle. Nothing looks familiar -- the
text: trees SWIRLING...making him dizzy.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: I don't remember...
text: Archer, head to the ground, watches Solomon closely. Sneaks
text: another peek at his watch. 0600 hours. No air strike.
speaker_heading: POISON
dialog: Find it! Or your family will die!
text: As if sleep-walking,; Solomon begins to walk toward the pits.
text: Poison and several armed rebels follow close behind.
scene_heading: THE FIRST ROCKET EXPLODES 168
text: in the middle of the camp -- sending a corrugated hut sky
text: high. Everyone is knocked to the ground.
text: An E.0. HELICOPTER GUNSHIP streaks by overhead. THE SECOND
text: ROCKET hits a truck -~ instantly turning it into a fireball.
text: THE GUNSHIP'S GATLING GUNS
text: fire. 800 ROUNDS PER SECOND chew up everything in its path.
dialog: 170
dialog: 94,
speaker_heading: ARCHER'S GUARD
text: is almost cut in half by the devastating firepower. Archer
text: rolls behind a tree -- CHUNKS FLY from its base.
scene_heading: SOLOMON, CAPTAIN POISON AND AN R.U.F. GUARD
text: have been knocked into a muddy DIAMOND PIT. Solomon hugs
text: the ground as the jet SCREAMS over -- stitching the ground.
text: ARCHER gets to his feet and sprints toward Dia -- ignoring
text: the EXPLOSIONS all around him. Since his hands are still
text: tied behind his back --he hurtles a BODYCHECK into the back
text: of the SOLDIER guarding the boy.
text: He THROWS HIMSELF on top of the boy -- as the gunships make
text: another pass -- KILLING R.U.F. soldiers who try to escape.
text: EXT. AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DIAMOND PIT 169
text: Solomon turns over the body of a dead guard and finds A
text: MACHETE in his belt. Captain Poison looks up from the muck
text: and reaches for his 9mm -- only it isn't in his holster.
text: Frantically, he digs in the mud. It's nowhere to be found.
text: Solomon, meanwhile, gets to his feet and moves toward Poison --
text: who frantically tries to climb out of the pit --
text: The sides are high and slick. The closer Solomon gets, the
text: more frantically Poison tries to claw his way out. But the
dialog: walls are just too slippery...
text: He FALLS back -- sliding down -- at last finding his gun.
text: He raises it, but it's too late -- Solomon RAISES THE MACHETE.
text: All we can see is the lip of the pit, but we can HEAR Poison's
text: SCREAMS as Solomon's powerful arm RISES and FALLS.
text: Solomon's face is contorted -- as the rage that has been
text: buried for so long finds its expression. He brings the
text: machete down again -- and again with all his might. Blood
text: spattering him. Until he stops.
text: With disbelief and horror at what he's done.
scene_heading: TWO ARMORED VEHICLES 170
text: appear with .50 caliber machine guns FIRING from their mounts.
text: Behind them, MERCENARIES wearing the red beret of the E.O.
text: Joost organizes blocking positions around the perimeter of
text: the village -- cutting down anyone who tries to escape.
text: It is all over in a matter of minutes.
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: 171 A SILENCE 17
text: As the SMOKE and DUST clears, hardly a soul is moving. THE
text: COLONEL strides into camp followed by TWO BODYGUARDS.
text: ARCHER squints into the sun as the Colonel looms above him.
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: Thank you for calling in the location.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: You're welcome.
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: Then again, you had an ulterior
dialog: motive,
text: SOLOMON emerges from the pit, covered in blood. He isa
dialog: terrifying sight -- this gentle man transformed into some
dialog: kind of monster.
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: This must be the famous Mr. Vandy.
dialog: (to Archer)
dialog: Introduce us.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: This is Colonel Coetsee. He wants
dialog: the diamond.
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: No more than you.
text: Archer nods. True enough.
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: (calls out)
dialog: Joost.
text: Joost appears, holding a 9mm to Dia's head. Dia is shocked
text: by his father's appearance.
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: (calls out)
dialog: Lt. Gans.
text: A mercenary LIEUTENANT appears.
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: You will organize the withdrawal.
text: We move out in thirty minutes.
dialog: (turns to Solomon)
dialog: Let's take a walk, shall we?
text: The Colonel's two bodyguards follow.
dialog: 172
dialog: 173
dialog: 96.
scene_heading: MOMENTS LATER - ARCHER AND SOLOMON 172
text: are led at gunpoint into the diamond fields by the Colonel's
text: BODYGUARDS. The Colonel and Joost follow behind with Dia.
speaker_heading: JOOST
dialog: How much farther?
text: Solomon doesn't answer. They pass one pit after another.
text: A SAT-phone RINGS in the pack carried by one of the Colonel's
text: bodyguards. The guard answers it and hands it to The Colonel.
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: (on the SAT-phone)

text: He hands the phone back to the bodyguard.
scene_heading: HALF A MILE ON - IN A GROVE BY THE RIVERSIDE 173
text: Solomon stops. The others react, expectant.
text: Looming out of the thick growth is THE RUBBER TREE. Vines
text: have covered its base, but it's definitely the same tree.
text: Solomon measures the distance. Takes another few steps.
text: He is about to raise the shovel. Then stops dead, the muscles
text: of his arm tensing. Inches from his foot, unmistakable --
text: is the TRIGGER of a land mine -- partially covered by vines.
text: Solomon glances back to Joost, who stands several yards away.
text: He doesn't see it.
text: Solomon looks back at the trigger -- an idea forming. He
text: turns in Archer's direction...
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: (looking around)
text: An elephant graveyard.
speaker_heading: JOOST
dialog: What? Keep digging.
text: Archer knows Solomon is trying him something -- in code.
text: Solomon carefully takes a step sideways. Sinks the shovel
text: into the earth. Swallows. He's still in one piece.
text: He sinks the shovel in again. And again. Digging.
text: The Colonel watches, intently.
dialog: 97.
text: Solomon throws the shovel aside. Gets down on his knees,
text: digging with his hands now. Faster. Scooping out dirt and
text: rocks and sand. Until there is nothing left to scrape out.
text: He stares into the empty hole, confounded...
text: He looks to Joost, then Archer, then back into the hole.
text: Grabs the shovel again, starts digging the hole larger, wider.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: It is not here ... it is not here!
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: This is where I buried the stone.
dialog: In this place. But it is not here!
dialog: (beside himself)
dialog: Someone has taken it! Come see for
dialog: yourself!
text: The Colonel motions Joost over to Solomon. Joost leaves Dia
text: by the Colonel's side.
dialog: As the mercenary ventures over --
text: Solomon glances at Archer, his eyes convey something. Archer
text: reads the look. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees:
text: The TRIGGER. It lies between Solomon's hole and Joost.
text: Solomon tries desperately not to look at the trigger as Joost
text: comes closer. Closer.
text: Joost's boot HITS the TRIGGER. CLICK. A millisecond of
text: realization on the stunned mercenary's face before--
text: THE EXPLOSION blows him to bits.
text: Solomon is already DIVING behind a tree stump as--
text: Dia is thrown to the ground.
text: Archer seizes the moment -- sending an OPEN-HAND STRIKE to
text: the throat of his would-be executioner, then grabbing the AK-
text: 47, and shooting him before ripping the gun out of his hands.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: STAY DOWN?!
text: SOLOMON remains flattened behind the tree stump, head down.
text: Archer sprays GUNFIRE at the mercenaries -- hitting the
text: Colonel and the guards. He expends the entire clip.
dialog: And no one is left standing
dialog: 98.
text: He looks back at the rebel camp -~ knowing that other
text: mercenaries have heard the GUNFIRE.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's go!
text: Solomon gets up, orients himself and begins to count steps.
text: Spears the shovel into the earth. Digs.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: (admiringly)
dialog: You lying bastard...
text: Solomon throws the shovel down.
text: THERE IN THE HOLE -- peeking out of the dirt -- is the torn
text: green cuff of a pantleg. Solomon digs it out with his hands.
speaker_heading: FAR OFF VOICES
text: can be heard -- coming their way. Armed E.O. mercenaries.
text: Archer rams a fresh clip into the machine gun, and reaches
text: into the dead bodyguard's pack for his SAT-phone. But as he
text: looks up, he sees --
speaker_heading: DIA
text: holding The Colonel's 9mm. Aimed at him.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Dia--
text: Dia's eyes flicker from Archer to Solomon and then back.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON (CONT'D)
dialog: Dia, look at me.
text: Dia looks into Solomon's eyes.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON (CONT'D)
dialog: (in Mende)
dialog: You are Dia Vandy. Of the proud Mende.
dialog: Your mother loves you -~ and she
text: waits by the fire making plaintains
dialog: and red palm stew with your sister,
text: N'yanda, and the new baby.
dialog: (moves closer)
dialog: The cows wait for you. And Babu the
dialog: wild dog who minds no one but you.
dialog: (moves closer still)
dialog: And I am your father who loves you.
dialog: And you will go home with me, and be
dialog: my son.
text: He walks right up to him, ignoring the gun, and wraps his
text: ams around him.
dialog: 174
dialog: 99.
text: Dia goes limp, the gun hangs loosely at his side -- as he
dialog: allows himself to be held.
text: BEHIND THEM, THE JUNG! PTS WITH Gi RE
text: Solomon throws Dia to the ground. Archer takes cover.
text: FOUR MERCENARIES ARE ADVANCING
text: across the river -- firing as they come.
text: Archer RETURNS FIRE, hitting two, The others hit the ground.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
text: MOVE, MOVE, MOVE!!!
text: He SHOVES Solomon and Dia to their feet
text: ANOTHER SPRAY OF GUNFIRE pins them down.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: When I start firing. You run!
dialog: (stands up)
dialog: -...- NOW!
text: He lays down COVERING FIRE -- as Solomon and Dia head for
text: the brush. Archer waits until they are safe, then--
text: It's his turn to make a run. He takes off
text: It's only thirty yards or so, but they seem an eternity.
text: He is almost into the brush when--~
text: He is HIT in the back. He grunts and doubles over.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuck!
text: He fights the shock and the pain -- adrenaline kicking in --
text: and stumbles into the dense cover.
scene_heading: UP AHEAD - IN THE BUSH 174
text: He finds Solomon waiting. Solomon has no notion that Archer
text: has been wounded.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: How far?
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: {through gritted teeth)
dialog: There's...a strip...on a ridge...
dialog: fifteen kilometers...south. Fawaz

scene_heading: IN THE JUNGLE -- MINUTES LATER 175
text: An eerie quiet, broken only by the calls of exotic birds.
text: Archer leads them --~ paying for every step. The entry wound
text: in his back is small, almost unnoticeable.
text: He stops and pulls out the SAT-phone. Dials.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: (on the SAT-phone)
dialog: ...-Where are you? We're twelve
text: clicks Out. ..... Two hours at most...
speaker_heading: FAWAZ (O.S.)
dialog: --You have it?
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: (on the SAT-phone)
dialog: ...Roger that.
speaker_heading: FAWAZ (0.S.)
dialog: Carrying a lot of fuel. Don't know
dialog: if I can handle three more onboard.
text: Archer looks up ahead to where Solomon and Dia are waiting.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: (on the SAT-phone)
dialog: I'll get it sorted.
text: He punches the button and starts off again.
scene_heading: THREE KILOMETERS LATER 176
text: Solomon is STARING at the bloody exit wound below Archer's
text: arm pit -- the stain spreading.
text: Archer sees him see it. Looks at him.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: You must sit.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Yeah, let's just have tea.
text: He starts moving again.
scene_heading: THREE KILOMETERS LATER 177
text: Archer has to stop. His breathing is labored. He wipes his
text: mouth. Looks at his hand. No blood.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Missed...the lung...but it's
dialog: still....collapsed. Could...
dialog: be....worse....I guess.
dialog: 178
dialog: 179
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Rest now. They will not find us.
text: Archer looks around. As if sensing their pursuit.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: They're good.
dialog: (struggles to his
dialog: feet)
dialog: Let's go...
text: He wills himself onward.
scene_heading: THREE MORE KILOMETERS 178

text: says something to Dia in Mende.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: We will carry you.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Yes.
text: They each take one of Archer's arms over their shoulders.
text: Yoked together, they struggle on.
scene_heading: TWO KILOMETERS MORE 179
text: And they have reached the base of a rocky ridge. Archer
text: takes out the binoculars and sees--
scene_heading: BINOCULAR POV -- OFF IN THE DISTANCE
text: TWO E.O. ARMORED VEHICLES churn up dust as they approach.
text: Behind them come a squad of infantry on foot.
text: IN THE SKY ABOVE
text: The Cessna appears, circling.
text: THE RIDGE ABOVE THEM IS VERY STEEP
text: with dense brush blocking their way. In order to make it to
text: the landing strip, they will have to climb it.
dialog: It would be difficult enough to climb on one's own, but to
text: carry another man -- as Solomon tries as he hoists Archer
text: over his shoulder -- is beyond imagining.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: +. ewait...
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: No--
text: One step. Another step. And then another.
dialog: Solomon's strength is tremendous. They make progress. Hand
dialog: ever hand. Rock by rock.
text: Solomon's face contorts with the effort. His legs tremble
text: but still he keeps going. The top of the ravine appears,
text: far away, but tantalizingly in sight.
dialog: For a moment we might even believe they will make it -- but
text: then Solomon loses his footing. He stumbles.
text: Archer is slammed to the ground, grunting in pain. Solomon
text: reaches to pick him up again.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
text: STOP! DAMN'T!.
text: Archer's shirt-front is SOAKED in BLOOD. He is pale and
text: gasping for breath. Solomon goes to pick him up again.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: No. Let me...see it...
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Mr. Archer--
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: You....want it all...for yourself.
text: Solomon shakes his head, smiles ruefully. This is the moment
text: he realizes Archer is not going to make it.
text: He hands Archer the wrapped stone. Archer peels it open.
text: Even wrapped in a dirty cloth, it takes the breath away --
dialog: like something from the Gods.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: It's real...
text: He holds it up to the warm afternoon light.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: So....beautiful.
text: Archer looks up to see Solomon staring at him. He wraps it

speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Take it.

speaker_heading: UP ABOVE 180

text: The Armored Cars are getting closer.
speaker_heading: ARCHER 182

dialog: Dia.
scene_heading: IN THE BEAUTIFUL AFTERNOON LIGHT
text: The boy looks like the same innocent child he once was.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Take..... your....boy....home.
text: Solomon looks back at him, tears in his eyes.
text: He nods. In deep and simple gratitude.
text: Archer nods back. Then--
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Help me...
text: He struggles to pick up the machine gun. Solomon puts it
text: into his hands.
speaker_heading: ARCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Put the strap...over my shoulder.
text: Solomon helps secure it in place.
text: .50 CALIBER ROUNDS FROM THE ARMORED CAR

text: Solomon nods once more.
dialog: n Hell.
text: Dia meets Archer's eyes for the first time, then looks away.
text: Solomon leads his son up the ridge.
speaker_heading: ARCHER

speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: Maddy Bowen...
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Told you I would call.
text: Maddy is shocked to hear his voice.
text: and walks away from the table.
speaker_heading: MADDY

dialog: What do you mean--?
text: Above on the ridge, Archer HEARS the plane taking off.
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Listen...Maddy...I want you...to do
dialog: me another favor.
text: By now Maddy can hear the weakness in his voice, the labored
text: breathing. Then, the SOUND of gunfire from below.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: Archer, are you all right?
speaker_heading: ARCHER
dialog: Listen, I need you to go to Guinea.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: Archer, what's going on--?
speaker_heading: ARCHER

dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: ARCHER 189
text: pushes away the phone and sits back against a mossy rock,
text: his face in repose. He looks up at the shafts of sunlight
text: made visible by the dust and haze.
text: In the quiet, birds flit, insects buzz, the leafy branches
text: of trees hundreds of years old sway in the breeze.
dialog: It reminds us of how Solomon experienced the natural world
dialog: when first he found the diamond.
text: He looks down -- a half-smile on his face as DROPS OF HIS
text: BLOOD mix with the red dirt of Africa.
text: He looks up into the sky -- where THE CESSNA grows smaller
text: and smaller as it flies out of view.
scene_heading: ARMED E.O. MERCENARIES 190
text: swarm up the hillside toward Archer. We expect him to return

text: As the first soldier reaches his position, we SEE that Archer

text: eyes closed. At peace at last.
scene_heading: EXT. LONDON (TO ESTABLISH) -- DAY 191
text: From pastoral tranquility to the chaos of urban life. Solomon

speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: It is not enough,
speaker_heading: SIMMONS
dialog: I assure you, two million pounds is

speaker_heading: SIMMONS
dialog: May I see what I'm buying?
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: You will get the stone once my family

speaker_heading: SIMMONS

speaker_heading: SOLOMON

speaker_heading: SOLOMON (CONT'D)
