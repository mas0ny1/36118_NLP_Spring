text: We HEAR a HISSING WAIL and the wielding of steel.
speaker_heading: HXCKS (V.0.) (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: FAMILIAR
text: The blade lodges in his skull and he drops like a sack.
text: These guys move surprisingly fast -- Hicks is already

speaker_heading: A BUZZSAW BLADE

text: another Familiar.
speaker_heading: HICKS
text: Pulls off his COWBOY HAT. Activating a release. With a

text: With deadly accuracy, he flings the hat: It FLASHES through
text: the air, DAIS'iWHEELING around a Familiar's neck, pinpricking
text: his skin and finally whirling back to Hicks' band likean
text: obedient pup.
text: A BEAT as the Familiar stands, mouth agape. Then with a wet
text: SNAP his head rolls off his shoulders, THUDDING in the dirt.
text: Hicks falls to the ground, his wound starting to get the best
text: of him. He musters up his strength for another hat attack
dialog: but before he can --
speaker_heading: PRIEST

speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: How many?
speaker_heading: OLD MAN

speaker_heading: HICKS

speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: It's their spoor! They'd be flyin' above

speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: These angels...di.d you ever see them

speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: No, I reckon'. that's when they'd go back

speaker_heading: OLD MAN

speaker_heading: OLD MAN (CONT' D)

scene_heading: EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: INT. CASTLE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
text: Musty. Cool. Dark. Walls rising high into a cone as

speaker_heading: HICKS
dialog: This is bullshit. Lucy's been gone five

speaker_heading: HICKS
dialog: Great.
scene_heading: DOWN THE STAIRS
text: The air seems thicker here, the darkness claustrophobic.
text: Enveloping. It takes a moment for Priests' eyes to adjust.
speaker_heading: A CATACOMB
text: Actually more a cave. Miles and miles. Twisting, jagged and
text: moist. Endless corners, weaving into a dark and hideous maze.
text: Priest heads into it
scene_heading: INT. CASTLE CHAMBER - SAME
text: Frustrated, Hicks kicks at the garbage.
text: There's something underneath.
text: He brushes aside the refuse, uncovering a . bunch' of SMALL
text: WHITE SHAPES, breath catching as he realizes what it is:
dialog: Bones.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMB - SAME
text: It's quiet.
text: Priest moves through the darkness, footsteps not even a

scene_heading: INT. CASTLE CHAMBER - SAMB
text: Hicks is now at the chamber wall,'running his hand along it,
text: feels grooves lining its surface.

scene_heading: INT. CATACOMB - SAME
text: Priest turns a jagged corner and looks down the longest, most

text: Flickering gently.
text: A SHADOW brushes past the light, moving so fast it barely

text: Priest moves towards it.
scene_heading: IT. CASTLE CHAMBER - SAME
text: Hicks angles the broken glass under the light, reflecting a

speaker_heading: THE STONE:
scene_heading: 1L0Z.J.PIf .! i
text: Primitive but very creepy. We linger on the image, the
dialog: terror of the people, the viciousness of the creature. Truly
dialog: horrific.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMB - SAME
text: Quiet. Just the low how], of a breeze moving through the
dialog: tunnel.
text: Priest walks into an ANIMAL PEN of sorts, a hay-like
text: substance covering the floor, the smell of something bestial.
text: He,covers his nose, looking around, something in the corner
dialog: catching his eye ---
speaker_heading: TWO BODIES
text: splayed across the ground like rag dolls. He crouches to
dialog: take a closer look...
speaker_heading: WHAM!
text: SOMETHING. barrels into him with superhuman force!
text: Acting on instinct, Priest FOLDS AND ROLLS. Kicking the
text: thing off him and PUSHING off the wall for a blistering
dialog: recovery.
text: Whatever it is, it's fast. Quickly countering for every move
text: he gives, neither able to get the upper hand. Too dark to
dialog: make out what it is.
text: Priest locks his arms around the shape's arms, SLAb24=G it
text: against the wall, illuminating it under the torch light.
scene_heading: IT'S A FEMALE PRIEST

speaker_heading: PRIESTESS
dialog: How did you find me?

text: Priest approaches from down the tunnel, senses on full alert.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: It's too big to fit down here. That's

speaker_heading: THE PRIESTESS
text: Lets go of the wall, PLUMMETING straight towards the vampire,
text: the creature FLASHING its fangs in anticipation.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
text: Leaps from below, darting up the rock, taking advantage of
text: the distraction, landing on the creature's back and wrapping
text: his arms around its neck. Going for the deathlock.
text: With a SHRIEK the creature WHIPS its head with crack force
text: sending Priest flying. The Priestess, still in mid-drop,
text: CATCHES him and they both hit the ground with their feet.
speaker_heading: PRIESTESS
dialog: Should we lead it into open air? More

text: THE CREATURE HOWLS! Blazing straight for him.
text: Undaunted. Priest looks at the Priestess and folds his hands

speaker_heading: PRIESTESS

dialog: him will be.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DUNKIRK RAIL - DAY
text: The NIGHT TRAIN thundering across the rails, almost obscene
text: in the bright sunlight. An intruder from the darkness
text: We hear a SCRATCHING sound, something scraping. Heavy
text: breathing as we MOVE INTO...
scene_heading: INT. ASSEMBLY CAR - SAME
text: THE SERVANT FAMILIAR slides the door open, carrying food for
dialog: Lucy, no tray this time.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 68.
text: But she's not there.
text: He SCREECHES, dropping the-food as he runs to a HOLE ripped in
text: the wood floor, smatterings of blood around the edges. It's
text: not very big, just enough for a small body to fit through.
text: The Familiar sticks his head through the opening and -,-
scene_heading: RAILROAD TRACKS
text: CLACK past at a furious speed, inches from his head! The
text: noise is deafening..
speaker_heading: LUCY (0.S.)
dialog: Hey...
text: The Familiar turns -- Lucy's perched inside one of the JOISTS
text: lining the underside of the train.
text: KRACKI- She lets loose with a well-placed KICK, snapping his
text: head back so he catches on the track. With ascream, he's
text: quickly SUCKED out the train, pulverized on the track.
text: Lucy's covers her mouth, her nails an ugly bloody mass.
dialog: She's come this far, time to go the rest.
text: She manages to carefully crawl from joist to joist, moving
text: along the underside of the train, her body just centimeters
text: from the passing track.
speaker_heading: OHB SLIPS
text: Catching herself just in time. Her eyelids practically
text: brushing the wood.
text: Taking a deep breath, she manages to hoist herself through
text: the rest of the way finally making it to the CABOOSE.
text: She pulls herself up onto the back of the car. Now what? The
text: train is blazing past the wasteland at an incredible speed.
dialog: Only one thing to do.
text: She makes the sign of the cross, closes her eyes and JUMPS
scene_heading: EXT WASTELAND (EDGE OF THE PLAINS) - DAY
text: A dustorm.
text: The plain's a shifting veil of sand, parting to reveal a
text: vista of dunes, wind shipping across them.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 69.
text: As quickly as it opened the veil closes again, shifting to
text: reveal OUR TRIO plowing through, blast goggles and
text: respirators covering their faces. The Priestess riding a
text: cycle identical to Priest's.
text: In the distance we can make out a cluster of structures as
text: they arrive at Jericho.
scene_heading: EXT. JERICHO - DAY
text: Riding into town. The storm making it difficult to see
text: anything as they idle onto main street. It's deserted -- The
text: only sound a saloon door creaking noisily in the wind.
text: Ominous signs left in the vampires' wake are everywhere --
text: BROKEN DOORS, SHATTERED WINDOWS, OVERTURNED VEHICLES.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: We separate. Go through each building,
dialog: see what we find.
speaker_heading: HICKS
dialog: I'll start with the sheriff.
speaker_heading: PRIESTESS
dialog: Be careful. Just because it's daylight
dialog: doesn't mean it's safe.
text: Hicks nods, tightening the twin BANDOLEERS across his chest.
scene_heading: EXT. JAIL DAY
text: Everything is eerily quiet, just the sound of the wind.
text: Hicks crouches just outside the door, examining SPENT SHELL
text: CASINGS littering the walkway. He pulls out his six-shooter,
text: pushing the door open with his gun, stepping inside --
scene_heading: INT. JAIL CONTINUOUS
text: The place is a mess.
text: DUST BLOWN IN FROM THE STORM COVERS EVERYTHING, broken
text: furniture scattered everywhere, glass littering the floor.
dialog: Whatever went down here -- someone put up a hell of a fight.
speaker_heading: HICKS
dialog: 'Damn.
text: He shakes his head, heading towards the holding area as --
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 70.
scene_heading: INT. BROTHEL - SAME TIME
text: The Priestess walks in, flurries of yellow dust swirling in
text: her wake, filling the room.
dialog: if the jail was a disaster zone, this place is just plain
text: creepy. Red sofas, red curtains, hell, even red wine.
dialog: Everything set up for a great time...just no people.
text: A PIANO sits nestled in the corner, she walks to it and runs
text: her finger across the dust covered keys.
text: It comes up wet and red. Blood.
text: MUSIC SUDDENLY BURSTS FROM THE PIANO
text: The plinking keys playing by themselves, activated by
text: pneumatic pegs on a rotating paper roll, filling the lonely
text: room with tin-pan music.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
text: The sound of a record skipping.
text: Priest steps through a doorway, the door already ripped off
text: its hinges. Broken furniture and glass.
text: It's obvious a FAMILY lived here, children's clothes and
text: wooden toys messily strewn across the floor.
text: He walks to an OLD PHONOGRAPH sitting on the windowsill,
text: still playing, placing the needle back in its cradle.
dialog: That's when so=thing out the window ratchgo hiseve...
scene_heading: EXT. JERICHO/MAIN STREET DAY
text: Hicks, done searching, meets up with the Priestess in the

speaker_heading: HICKS
dialog: There ain't nobody left. Nobody.
speaker_heading: PRIESTESS
speaker_heading: (OMINOUS)
dialog: Too many mouths to feed.
speaker_heading: HICKS
dialog: Where's Priest?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 71.
text: But the Priestess's already focused on something else, gazing
text: at something behind the general store. He turns to see what
dialog: it is.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
text: On the ground KNEELING. Head down, engaging in some kind of
dialog: prayer.
text: THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as they slowly approach, wondering what
text: the hell is going on. As they get closer they see the full
speaker_heading: PICTURE:
text: Before Priest are THREE LARGE WOODEN CROSSES, A NAKED BODY ON
text: EACH, crucified. Because of the swirling sand it's hard to
text: make out their faces but it's obvious the poor souls are
text: already dead.
text: Immediately the Priestess drops beside Priest, joining him --
dialog: And it is only now that we get a good look at the crucifieds'
speaker_heading: FACES
dialog: They're Priests.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE WASTELANDS - DAY
text: Bare feet running on the salt-flats.
text: It's Lucy. Covered in dirt, battered and bruised but
text: chugging along. There is absolutely NOTHING out here, only
speaker_heading: LUCY AND
text: A BLACK FIGURE DROPS SILENTLY FROM THE SKY BEHIND HER
text: it wears a BLACK COAT, fluttering in the wind as it touches
text: down, the fabric cascading across the earth in long dark folds.
text: The Figure's face is completely covered by a BLACK COWBOY
text: HAT. The only thing we can see is a CHEROOT Sticking out
dialog: from where the mouth would be.
text: A brief moment as the tip of the cigar glows, a puff of smoke
text: exhaled. It drops to the ground, silver spurs making a
text: slight CHING sound as a BLACK BOOT stamps it out.
text: Lucy hears the sound and turns just in time to see -
text: y I ATHICK CHAIN __SHOOTING OUT from within the Fiaure',
text: coat. a HUGE METAL_ FINGERED CLAW at use ! The claw SLAMS
text: into Lucy, thick fingers CLAMPING around her, knocking her to
speaker_heading: THE GROUND
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 72.
text: She digs her nails into the earth but it's no use as the chain
text: DRAGS her backwards and she quickly-disappears INTO the coat
text: with a SCREAM. The folds enveloping her in a dark embrace.
text: In one graceful sweep, the Black Figure leaps to the sky.
text: Quickly disappearing.
text: We see the cheroot on the ground. Spent. The only evidence
dialog: that anyone or anything was ever out here at all.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. JERICHO - DAY
text: Caught between sheets of swirling dust and.sand, the images

text: A. The crucified Priests taken down from their crosses,

text: B. The corpses now wrapped in white cloth, carefully placed
text: amongst the makeshift pyre.
text: C. Flames engulfing the bodies, a twisty column of smoke
text: rising, the sun and clouds painting the sky pink and gold.
text: OUR TRIO stands before the pyre gazing into the fire, it Pops
text: consuming more of the bodies, if the Priests listen close
text: enough they can hear the end of an era.
speaker_heading: HICKS
dialog: Don't make no sense. What were they

speaker_heading: PRIESTESS
dialog: The same thing as us.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Someone's drawing us out.
speaker_heading: HICKS
dialog: Who?
text: The Priests just stare into the fire, not having any idea.
speaker_heading: HICKS (CONT'D)
dialog: I imagine you'll have to go back to the

text: A sudden silence.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: We're not going back.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

text: The Priestess looks at him, he speaks for her as well but
text: she's still shocked to hear the words out loud. A lifetime
dialog: of conditioning..
speaker_heading: PRIESTESS
dialog: We'll burn for this.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: (looking at the pyre)
dialog: We already are.
text: Something in the flames catches the Priestess's eye, in the
text: charred remains of one of the corpses -- SOMETHING'S GLOWING.
text: She wraps her arm, plunging her hand through the bones,
text: pulling out the object. Quickly, she tosses it into a'barrel
text: of water. it hisses, steam rising as it cools.
text: Priest reaches into the barrel, his hand emerging with a
scene_heading: METAL SPIKE.
speaker_heading: HICKS
dialog: It's a railroad spike. My pop used to
dialog: work boxcars before they shut down -- Why
dialog: the hell would anyone wanna swallow that?
text: A beat as Priest puts it together.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: He wanted us to find it. It's a clue.
speaker_heading: PRIESTESS
dialog: Where's the closest track?
text: CUT TO.
scene_heading: INT. JAIL DAY
text: Hicks pulls a LARGE MAP off the wall, blowing off a layer of
text: dust, drawing a line across the paper with his finger.
speaker_heading: HICKS
text: The Dunkirk Line. It starts all the way
dialog: in the backcountry, bought the ore from
dialog: the deep mines. There were about five
dialog: stops along the route. I think.
text: He draws several Xs along the line. His hand coming to a
text: stop on a particular forboding PATCH OF MOUNTAINS.
dialog:

speaker_heading: HICKS (CONT'D)
dialog: Looks like Jericho was, the last town it

text: Mountains...Then it goes to the last stop.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: Where?
text: He draws one final X at the end of the line. Looks up.
speaker_heading: HICKS
dialog: The Cities.
text: So there it is. The Priestess narrows her eyes.
speaker_heading: PRIESTESS
dialog: They must have been picking up different
text: factions along the way. Moving during
text: the day, feeding at night.
speaker_heading: HICKS
dialog: But headin' to the Cities is suicide.
dialog: The sun will kill `em -- there's nowhere
dialog: to hide.
text: Priest gazes at the map, deeply troubled.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: They won't have to.
text: And with the SHRIEK of the train whistle we CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WASTELAND (DUNKIRK RAIL) - DAY
text: The Night Train barreling down the track, blasting along on

speaker_heading: WHISPER)
dialog: She'd be dead if not for me...swallowed

text: From the shadows, Black Hat steps forward, looking down at
text: Lucy. She struggles but the hand tightens its grip.
speaker_heading: BLACK HAT
dialog: What do you want for her?
text: And now her captor lifts his hat -- revealing paper-thin

speaker_heading: RUNE
dialog: You know what r want.

speaker_heading: RUNE (CONT'D)
dialog: My how things have changed.
text: Ever so slightly, the metal finger SQUEEZES Lucy's throat,

speaker_heading: RUNE (CONT'D)
dialog: I never cared about your war. Never got

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Maybe it's time to return the favor.

speaker_heading: BLACK HAT
dialog: Fine. He's Yours.
text: As if on command, the finger retreats back into the jacket,

speaker_heading: RUNE
dialog: And -- she's yours.

text: Priest lies close by, asleep.
speaker_heading: HICKS
dialog: If we push it hard we'll gain two days on

speaker_heading: PRIESTESS
dialog: We'need more than a jump. We need a

speaker_heading: HICKS

speaker_heading: HICKS (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: PRIESTESS

text: Last: in the line, is a particularly FEARSOME PRIEST ...unlike

text: As a cohesive unit, the Priests, climb up from the trench,

scene_heading: THOUSANDS OF HONEYCOMBS
text: stretching endlessly, rising high above in a cone. THOUSANDS

text: OUR PRIEST, motions with his hand to the others, giving

text: A BEAT as the Priestess looks at the others.
speaker_heading: PRIESTESS
dialog: They know we're here.
text: From under the earth A HAND SHOOTS UP, grabbing onto a

speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: Retreat!
speaker_heading: FEARSOME PRIEST
text: Battles like a tiger, grappling with TWo VAMPIRES, their claws

scene_heading: FEARSOME SUDDENLY STOPS
text: A BLACK TOP HAT lying on the ground catching his eye, must be

dialog: At the last second --
text: He's pulled back by a clutch of SCREECHING HUNGRY CLAWS. The

scene_heading: EXT. BEGGAR'S PASS CAMP - NIGHT
text: Priest WAKING UP, breath catching in his throat.
text: He looks over to find the Priestess working on her cycle,
text: unable to sleep. There's a tension in the air, the sense of
text: something about to break as he joins her.
speaker_heading: PRIESTESS
dialog: Why would the Clergy forbid us from
dialog: seeing each other?
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: Maybe they were scared of what we could
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: PRIESTESS
dialog: Or what we would do.
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: We both know there's something inside the

speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: With or without the Clergy...we're still

speaker_heading: PRIEST

speaker_heading: PRIEST (CONT'D)
dialog: What in greater than God but more evil

speaker_heading: PRIESTESS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: It's a riddle.
text: The Priestess thinks about it.
speaker_heading: PRIESTESS.

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Nothing is greater than God. Nothing is

speaker_heading: PRIESTESS
dialog: Could be one of those nights?
text: She smiles.

scene_heading: IN THE DISTANCE
text: A long black line snakes along the rail, puffs of heavy smoke
text: lining its path; The Night Train.
text: They're ahead of it. Barely.
text: In his excitement, Hicks thunders ahead, starting the descent
text: down the other side. The Priestess turns to shout back to
dialog: Priest.
text: But he's gone.
dialog: Off her reaction we CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CREVASSE - DAY
text: Tall rock walls flank Priest on. either side, the surrounding
text: mist hanging in the air in cloudlike wisps. Slowly he walks
text: through the canyon, senses fully attuned. It's quiet.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: I know you're there.
text: A slight sound, the mist whipping into a pool as if something
text: just moved through it. Priest quickly turns but there's
dialog: nothing there.
text: A GROUP OF ROCKS
text: Tumble down the cliff. Again Priest abruptly turns
dialog: but...still nothing there.
speaker_heading: PRIEST (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: RU11TE (O. S. )
dialog: (voice like the mist itself)
dialog: I've waited a long time for this Priest.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: This isn't the time to settle old scores,
dialog: Rune.
speaker_heading: RUNE (0. S. )
dialog: I disagree... This is the perfer, time.
text: WOOSH! Like lightning, the claw LASHES out, appearing from.
text: nowhere. Priest JUMPS and it CHOMPS into the ground where he
text: was standing. He lands on top of the chain, backflipping as
text: it retracts back. Gearing up for another attack.
speaker_heading: RUNE (0.s.) (CONT'D)
dialog: You've lost a step Priest...I never came
dialog: this close before.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: I'm older now.

speaker_heading: RUNE (0.8.)
dialog: Not me.
text: And now THE CHAIN comes from a different direction, WRAPPING
text: around Priest like a snake, the metal cutting into his body,
dialog: snapping a ribt
text: Yelling, Priest GRABS the chain, PULLING with everything he's
text: got. Rune flies from the mist, dragged by Priest, crashing
text: at his feet. The chain SNAPS and Priest BREAKS from the
text: coils, grabbing Rune by the jacket, picking him up.
text: Rune flashes his fangs and scissors his legs across Priest's
text: stomach, the razor sharp roweled SPURS slicing his flesh,
text: tearing the muscle, Priest SCREAMS, a hot rush of, blood
text: staining the desert floor.
text: Rune leaps away, landing ontop a boulder.
speaker_heading: RUNE (CONT'D)

text: It's a savage battle, Priest's muscles and laser-like focus
text: the only thing keeping him alive as Rune flies back across
text: the canyon, landing against the rock wall like.a spider.
text: Hunched, ready to strike BUT --
speaker_heading: THE PRIESTESS
text: Appears from within the mist, already in mid-leap, she lands

speaker_heading: HICKS

speaker_heading: (HISSING)
dialog: Another time, Priest.

speaker_heading: HAM!

speaker_heading: RUNE'S BODY
text: Drops from the fog, hitting the ground with a thud. Dead.
text: And now Hicks turns -- points his revolver at Priest.
text: Catching both he and the Priestess by surprise.
speaker_heading: HICKS

speaker_heading: PRIEST

speaker_heading: HICKS
dialog: She's your kin, goddamit!
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: if she's turned...she's nobody's kin.
speaker_heading: HICKS
dialog: Things can be done. Things to lessen the

text: Priest nods grimly.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: It's our way.
speaker_heading: HICKS
dialog: And what is that? Some special Priest

speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: Shoot me and it won't matter if you find

speaker_heading: PRIESTESS
dialog: He's right. We need to be together on

speaker_heading: HICKS
dialog: This ain't done.

text: A BEAT as everyone holds their breath, wondering what's going
dialog: to emerge --
speaker_heading: VR0000000000MI
text: SIX BLACK MOTORCYCLES (the same ones who kidnapped Lucy) fly

text: Priest turns to the other two.
speaker_heading: PRIEST

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I'll catch up.

scene_heading: THE VAMPIRE RIDERS
text: Take the bait, going for Priest. They gun their cycles,

text: a chain, swirling it above his head.
text: With a SNAP he lashes it at Priest, the chain catching in his
text: wheel, the sound of metal grinding as
speaker_heading: PRIEST
text: is thrown! His beloved bike FLIPPING across the desert in
text: wild arcs. He hits the earth with a painful skid, using the
text: momentum to roll back onto his feet.
text: He checks his stomach, the wound's of enina t,}g xnorA, staining
text: his shirt bright red. No time for first aid as he turns just
dialog: in time to see
speaker_heading: TWO RIDERS
text: Throwing a STEEL CHAIN to the other, pulling the line taut,

text: At the last second, DUCKS, grabbing onto. the chain, swinging

text: He lands back on the ground in a crouch, the steel chain

dialog: And he gets it.
scene_heading: THE OTHER FOUR RIDERS
text: Circle Priest, surrounding him, the ROAR of their engines
text: like massive power drills.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
text: Snaps the chain above his head, bullwhip style, LASHING out.
text: The sound of metal shredding as it tangles in Rider #1's
text: handlebars, the bike SWEEPING into the other, CRASHING in a
text: tangled mess.
text: With a SNARL the fallen riders LAUNCH at Priest. These
dialog: vampires are different than the Nightshade tribe. Stronger,
text: quicker. Squat bodies of clenched muscles and fangs.
scene_heading: A BRUTAL FIGHT
text: Spinning, twisting, kicking, gnashing. Bodies locked in deep
text: combat as Priest fends off the ferocious attackers. War
text: cries WHOOPING, the OTHERS TWO RIDERS continue to circle the

speaker_heading: PRIEST
text: Rips the BLAST HELMETS off his two attackers. With a
text: SCREECH, their faces burn, bodies instantly SLACKENING in the
text: harsh sun.
text: Priest CRUNCHES a vampire in the ribs, knocking the creature
text: off his bike. In a flash, he FLINGS.a helmet into the

text: rider across the desert.
text: Eyes brimming with renewed fury, Priest picks up the cycle,
text: VROOOOMI! GUNNING the throttle, mod. ROCKETING towards the

scene_heading: EXT. VAMPIRE TRAIN - SAME TIME

speaker_heading: PRIESTESS (CONTIB)
dialog: I'm going for the engine. Find Lucy.
text: (about to speed off, stops)
text: Before he does.
text: Hicks nods, knowing this'll probably be the last time he sees
dialog: her.
text: And with that, she throttles forward, disappearing.
text: Alone, Hicks takes a deep breath, looks at --
scene_heading: THE TRAIN CAR DOOR
text: Who knows what horrors lie behind it? He pops a WAD OF

speaker_heading: HICKS
dialog: My.tuxn now, Priest.

scene_heading: INT VAMPIRE TRAIN CAR - SAME
text: Sunlight bursts into the darkened chamber, but only reaching

text: WOODEN COFFINS stacked atop one another like cargo.
text: He quickly moves through the car, careful not to disturb
text: anything. We FOLLOW with him as he exits, entering --
scene_heading: INT. BLACK STEEL ENCLOSURE - CONTINUOUS
dialog: Designed so one can move between the cars without exposure to

scene_heading: INT. TRAIN CAR - CONTINUOUS

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 92.
text: The only thing we can make out is a LARGE CAGE, what's inside
text: impossible to see in the darkness, just a GIANT HULKING C
text: SHADOW. Its steady, hefty breathing letting us know whatever
text: it is, it's asleep.
text: Hicks covers his nose from the bestial smell, the cage taking
text: up so much room he is forced to press himself against the
text: bars, his body just inches from the thing inside.
text: THE TWITCH OF BLACK LEATHER WINGS
text: Makes Hicks stop in his tracks, silently praying to whoever's

text: A long moment...and then the steady breathing begins again.
text: Whew. Hicks continues through the cabin, finally making it

scene_heading: EXT. VAMPIRE TRAIN - DAY

speaker_heading: PRIEST
text: Seemingly from out of nowhere, motors up to the train car

scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN ROOF - SAME TIME

scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN ROOF - SAME TIME

text: Suddenly a FIGURE steps in front of him, blotting out the
text: sun. Priest squints, unable to trust his eyes, he must be
scene_heading: HALLUCINATING --
text: IT'S BLACK HAT. He looks down at Priest, bowing with a
dialog: slight flourish.
speaker_heading: BLACK HAT
dialog: "And the third day He shall rise again.
text: Priest can't believe it, seeing his long dead comrade, his

speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: .How?
text: Black Hat smiles, baring hi fangs.
speaker_heading: BLACK HAT
dialog: Oh ye of little faith.
text: The understanding hits Priest immediately, crashing over him

speaker_heading: HICKS
dialog: 0
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Shit.
text: Gritting his teeth, he walks between the rows, quiet as
text: possible. The interiors of the coffins are dark, hard to see
text: what's lying inside, just that horrible breathing sound.
text: As Hicks moves past, his body brushes the wood, the space so
dialog: very tight.
text: WHAM! The train CATCHES the rail and the car shakes,
text: KNOCKING HIM INTO A COFFIN! Jarring it.
text: He stops. Holding his breath...but
dialog: Nothing happens.

dialog: Lack of faith. That's what I found in my

text: Something in the distance catches Priest's eye, a BLACK SPEC

dialog: knows there isn't much time.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: So this is how you go about it? One by
dialog: one killing every last remaining Priest?
speaker_heading: BLACK HAT
dialog: It was the only way. The Cities are
dialog: defenseless now...no one left to stop us
dialog: from entering our Eden. But I was kind --
dialog: I gave every last one the choice I never

speaker_heading: (SMILES)
dialog: Now it's your turn.

speaker_heading: BLACK HAT (CONT'D)
dialog: it's better to be with your enemies than

speaker_heading: (BEAT)

speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: Yours.
speaker_heading: WE HEAR A HUM
text: Molecules and electrons bursting from their orbits, the roar

dialog: to leave these two room to battle.
text: And before anyone knows it, they're already mid-fight. The
text: SLAM and COLLISION of bodies giving way to the graceful sweep
text: and echo of Priest combat.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 96.
text: Then as combustibly fast as it started -- the tableau drops.
text: They stand, wind whipping around them in lethal currents,
text: Black Hat having to shout to be heard.
speaker_heading: BLACK HAT
dialog: They taught us God created man in His

text: The warriors rise, locked in a furious coil.as WHOOSHI train

speaker_heading: BLACK HAT
dialog: Your problem is you keep looking to God

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: You've been praying to an empty sky.
text: And now he SWIPES his foot across the roof, knocking off

text: A VAMPIRE hangs upside down from the ceiling, blocking the

speaker_heading: HICKS TURNS
