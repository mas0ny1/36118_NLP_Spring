scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN CITY STATION - DAY
text: CLOSE SHOT -- station signboard. It reads:
scene_heading: "GARDEN CITY"
text: CAMERA PANS to show the dusty platform of a typical small
dialog: Arizona town of the late nineties.
text: CAMERA TRUCKS ALONG platform PAST a line of sleeping figures,
text: consisting of a couple of drunks, an Indian, two Mexicans
text: and a mongrel dog.
text: CAMERA STOPS on the window of the ticket office. Inside the
text: office can be glimpsed the Station Agent dozing in a chair
text: with his feet up against the grill of the ticket window. The
text: clicking of the signal indicator is heard. The agent opens
text: his eyes, flips up the indicator and begins to get to his
text: feet sleepily.
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: line of sleeping figures, with dog in f.g. The sound of a
text: distant train whistle is heard o.s. The dog, which up to now
text: might have been dead, opens one eye and looks past camera.
speaker_heading: LONG SHOT
text: railway track with the three-car train approaching.
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: line of sleeping figures. The dog jumps up barking furiously
text: and runs out of shot past camera. The sleeping figures come
text: to life and look toward camera. At the same time, the door
text: of the ticket office opens and the agent appears.
speaker_heading: FULL SHOT
text: railway track. The train is now almost at the station.
scene_heading: EXT. PLATFORM - DAY
text: FULL SHOT -- with the line of men now standing on the edge
text: of the platform looking toward camera. Train steams slowly
text: in past camera, and stops, with a tall, wide-shouldered man
text: of about 28 (Rocklin), dressed in new store clothes, cowboots
text: and a broad-brimmed white hat, in f. g. standing on steps of
text: day coach with a small valise and saddle in his hands. Behind
dialog: Rocklin a conductor.
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: baggage car. The baggageman is standing at the open door of
text: the car with two sacks of mail. He drops them to the platform
text: and waves to the conductor o.s. and begins to close the doors
text: of the baggage car.
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE SHOT
text: on Station Agent and conductors. The latter signals the
text: engineer. The train whistle sounds again o.s. and the shadow
text: of the moving train begins to pass across the Station Agent's
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: TRUCKING SHOT
text: As Rocklin comes along the platform carrying the valise in
text: one hand and balancing the saddle on his shoulder with the
text: other, a man behind him picks up the two mail sacks and exits
text: from scene. The station bums look at Rocklin curiously. His
text: expression giving no encouragement, they slink back out of
text: the sun and begin to settle down in their old places again.
text: At the ticket office, Rocklin pauses and looks around
text: uncertainly.
speaker_heading: STATION AGENT
dialog: (at office door)
dialog: Expectin' someone?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (after a second's
dialog: pause)
dialog: I guess not. Where's the stagecoach
dialog: office?
speaker_heading: STATION AGENT
dialog: (pointing)
text: Back of the depot.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN CITY STAGE DEPOT - DAY
text: The stage is drawn up in front of the depot, over which is a
dialog: sign --
speaker_heading: RED ROCK STAGE
dialog: J. Harolday Proprietor
text: Rocklin, making his way along the walk, almost reaches the
text: depot when his attention is arrested by the sight of Dave,
text: the stage driver, who has just rounded in front of the lead
text: horses. He pauses close to one horse's head. Rocklin sees
text: Dave take a bottle from his person, uncork it as he glances
text: around, and raise it to drink. The bottle is almost to Dave's
text: lips when the horse shies, swinging its head. The bottle is
text: knocked from the old fellow's hands and smashes on the ground.
text: Now Rocklin witnesses a scene of intense fury, which he finds
text: amusing despite its seriousness. Old Dave rants and snorts --
text: beats his thighs, his heads, flings his arms wildly and
text: exhibits his utter disgust generally.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (to horse)
dialog: Consarn you, Blossom -- lookit that --
dialog: jus' lookit what you done --
dialog: (some more pantomime)
dialog: I'm tellin' you, Blossom that --
dialog: (indicating broken
dialog: bottle)
dialog: -- makes you the most aggravatin'
dialog: female as ever I had a despise fer --
dialog: I've got a good notion to pizen you --
dialog: an' what's more --
text: He stops talking abruptly because his hand has, quite by
text: chance, felt the spare bottle he carries, which he has
text: forgotten in his anger. A most satisfying smile lights his
text: bewhiskered face as he brings the bottle into view. He uncorks
text: it, and stepping a few paces from the horse, raises the
dialog: bottle.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (to Blossom)
dialog: Heh-heh -- fooled you, didn't I? --
dialog: (chuckles)
dialog: Fooled myself, too.
speaker_heading: ON ROCKLIN
text: who has been watching Dave's performance. He smiles his
text: amusement and now proceeds toward the stage office.
scene_heading: INT. GARDEN CITY STAGE DEPOT - DAY
text: PAN SHOT. Rocklin enters and moves over to the counter, behind
text: which is the stage agent, a mild-looking man with pebble-
text: lens glasses. During the scene, the character who picked up
text: the mail sacks from the platform, comes in, dumps the sacks
text: on the counter and leaves.
speaker_heading: STAGE AGENT
dialog: (to Rocklin)
dialog: Howdy.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (indicating stage)
dialog: That the stage for Santa Inez?
speaker_heading: STAGE AGENT
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Leaving any minute.
text: Rocklin puts his saddle on the counter, and taking out a wad
text: of bills, drops them on the counter. The Stage Agent counts
dialog: out the fare.
speaker_heading: STAGE AGENT
dialog: Santa Inez -- seventeen-fifty --
dialog: (returning the balance)
dialog: Name?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Rocklin.
text: The Stage Agent turns to make out the ticket. Rocklin takes
text: some tobacco and paper from his vest pocket as he glances
dialog: outside.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Mind if I ride alongside the driver?
speaker_heading: STAGE AGENT
dialog: (over his specs)
dialog: It's all right with me -- if it's
dialog: all right with Dave -- He's mad --
dialog: His last trip -- Had a row with
dialog: Harolday, the boss -- Old-timer,
dialog: Dave -- an' a grumpy old cuss.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (soberly)
dialog: I like grumpy old cusses -- Hope to
dialog: live long enough to be one.
speaker_heading: STAGE AGENT
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: Yeah?
text: He shakes his head and hands Rocklin the ticket, and moves
text: over to the door with one of the mail sacks in his hand.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN CITY STAGE DEPOT - DAY
text: The Stage Agent, carrying a mail sack, and Rocklin come from
text: the stage depot and reach the stage as Dave is in the act of
text: climbing up to the driver's seat.
speaker_heading: STAGE AGENT
dialog: Here's your mail, Dave --
text: Dave looks over his shoulder at the Agent and steps to the
text: ground, as Rocklin climbs up to the driver's seat.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
text: (as he steps up to
dialog: the seat)
dialog: -- and a passenger.
text: Dave glares at Rocklin climbing up to the seat, and he is
text: about to order him down when Rocklin, now seated, looks down
text: at him and asks rather wistfully --
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Mind if I ride up here?
text: Dave does mind, but his better judgment tells him to step
text: carefully in his attitude toward this stranger, who does
text: things first, then asks permission. His only answer to Rocklin
dialog: is a characteristic grimace which is eloquent enough. And
text: now Dave turns on the Agent, who becomes the target of his
text: pent-up wrath.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Where's them wimmen?
speaker_heading: STAGE AGENT
text: Up at the hotel.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (yanking mail sack
dialog: from Agent)
dialog: Why ain't they here? -- This is the
dialog: stage depot, ain't it -- ?
dialog: (heaves sack into
dialog: boot)
dialog: Ain't it?
speaker_heading: STAGE AGENT
dialog: You can pick 'em up there -- it's
dialog: only up the street --
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: On'y up the street -- an' they cain't
dialog: walk it -- What's the matter -- don't
dialog: Easterners have laigs like other
dialog: folks?
text: Dave stalks around the rear of the coach. The Agent meantime
text: stretches himself up toward Rocklin.
speaker_heading: STAGE AGENT
dialog: (so Dave won't hear)
dialog: Hold tight when you git in the
dialog: mountains, mister -- When he gits
dialog: riled you can hear the passengers
dialog: prayin' for miles.
text: Dave has climbed to his seat, and now the coach lurches away,
text: leaving the Agent shaking his head dubiously.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN CITY HOTEL - DAY
text: From the porch of the hotel. We see the stage approaching as
text: the hotel handyman brings a trunk and a couple of bags from
text: the hotel to the street. The coach pulls up and stops.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (to handyman)
dialog: Whar's them wimmen? -- They waitin'
dialog: for you to carry 'em out?
text: Before the handyman can answer, Dave's attention is taken by
text: someone calling his name from across the street. Meantime,
text: an Indian squaw wobbles from the hotel with bow and arrow,
dialog: etc. Rocklin buys bow and arrow.
speaker_heading: SADDLER
dialog: (as he comes to Dave)
dialog: Dave -- Dave -- tell Arly Harolday
dialog: her saddle ain't ready yet, will ya?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (getting to the ground)
dialog: I ain't tellin' that crazy female
dialog: nothin' -- Last time I seen her she
dialog: threatened to rip the hide off'n me
dialog: and bat me dizzy with it.
text: Dave goes to the rear of the coach.
speaker_heading: SADDLER
dialog: (looks up to Rocklin)
dialog: Mister -- will you tell the Agent at
dialog: Santa Inez to tell Miss Harolday her
dialog: saddle ain't ready yet?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (nods)
dialog: I'll say that.
speaker_heading: PORCH OF HOTEL
text: Miss Martin steps out onto the porch followed by Clara and a
text: gentleman, presumably the hotel manager or clerk. The women
text: are obviously Easterners and are attired in the good taste
text: of the period. Miss Martin is a domineering woman, approaching
text: middle age. Her niece, Clara, is a well-bred, attractive
text: girl of twenty-one and completely under the influence of the
dialog: older woman.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (as group comes through
dialog: door)
dialog: By next year, madam, we expect to
dialog: have a bathtub on each floor.
text: Miss Martin stops short and looks o.s.
text: ON DAVE AT REAR OF THE COUCH
text: having a time lifting the trunk up into the boot. Miss Martin
text: and the others come into the scene.
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: Now don't drop it --
text: Dave pauses to see who is talking.
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: At your age you'd best not be lifting
dialog: things so heavy.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (grimaces)
dialog: Mebbe you're young enough to hoist
dialog: her up your own self.
dialog: (tries to lift trunk
dialog: again)
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: on Clara. She is looking rather timidly up at Rocklin.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: on Rocklin. He is grinning appreciatively at old Dave. Now
text: he notices Clara and regards her soberly a moment.
speaker_heading: FULL SHOT
text: Dave has heaved the trunk in place and is securing it.
text: Miss Martin, about to enter the coach, notices Clara staring
text: up at Rocklin.
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: Clara!
text: Clara snaps her attention from Rocklin to her aunt. The Clerk
text: steps to the side of the coach and opens the door. He assists
text: Clara inside -- and now Miss Martin.
scene_heading: INT. COACH - DAY
text: Miss Martin and Clara. Miss Martin is just sitting. She looks
text: coldly at Clara.
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: (in low voice)
dialog: Staring as though you'd never seen a
dialog: man before.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN CITY HOTEL - DAY
text: Dave, Rocklin and Clerk. Dave is at the moment climbing to
text: his seat on the other side of the coach. The Clerk swings
text: the door closed and looks up to Rocklin and speaks more or
text: less confidentially.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Try to hold him down or he'll scare
dialog: the women to death.
speaker_heading: ON ROCKLIN
text: He is looking down at the Clerk and answers quite casually,
text: but loud enough to be heard by the women.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: I never feel sorry for anything that
text: happens to a woman.
scene_heading: INT. COACH - DAY
text: THROUGH window of door -- Miss Martin and Clara. The women
text: have obviously overheard Rocklin's remark. Miss Martin smiles
text: vindictively at Clara, who flushes.
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK to include the Clerk, who moves to the
dialog: coach door.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Well, I hope you have a nice trip,
dialog: ladies.
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: I hope we get there -- wouldn't
dialog: surprise me if we didn't.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN CITY HOTEL - DAY
text: On Dave and Rocklin.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (mutters)
dialog: Wait till I get you on the road, you
dialog: old buzzard, you'll be surprised all
dialog: right.
text: He takes up the reins and shouts the team away.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE OUT
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE IN
scene_heading: EXT. ARIZONA COUNTRY - DAY
text: EXTREME LONG SHOT -- with the stage hardly more than a black
text: dot below, its curl of rising dust in the midst of the whole
text: broad expanse. As the coach disappears from shot, the two
text: mounted men appear riding at an easy pace and continue in
text: the same direction as the coach.
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVER'S SEAT OF COACH - DAY
text: MED. CLOSE SHOT -- Dave and Rocklin, the latter staring
text: straight ahead. As they roll with the roll of the coach,
text: Dave steals a look at his companion.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I wonder why a young feller who don't
dialog: have to wants to come into this God
dialog: danged country?
text: Rocklin ignores Dave's question and continues staring ahead.
text: Dave glances down toward the women.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Say -- did you mean what you said
dialog: back there about wimmen?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (grimly)
dialog: Every word of it.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: Then you're smarter than most.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Maybe I seen more of 'em than most.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (looking at him
dialog: admiringly)
dialog: Shouldn't be surprised. Shouldn't be
text: a leetle bit surprised.
dialog: (reflectively)
dialog: All the same...
text: He breaks off and chuckles again.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (unsmilingly)
dialog: All the same -- what?
text: Dave doesn't reply, but lifting the pint of whiskey, jerks
text: out the cork with one movement of his thumbnail.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (offering bottle to
dialog: Rocklin)
dialog: Take a slug.
text: Rocklin drinks and gives the bottle back to Dave, who all
text: but empties it in one pull.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (holding up the bottle
text: and squinting through
dialog: it)
dialog: Whiskey and wimmen -- ever think how
dialog: much alike they are? Both fool you,
dialog: but you never figger out how to do
dialog: without 'em.
text: Rocklin makes no reply. Dave offers the bottle again.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Take another.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Not just yet.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (unoffended)
dialog: Well...
dialog: (putting the bottle
dialog: to his lips)
dialog: Here's to her.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: The next one that fools you.
text: He empties the bottle and shies it away. At the same time,
text: the coach hits a particularly bad patch of road and there is
text: muffled exclamation from inside the coach. Dave leans over
text: and looks down o.s.
scene_heading: INT. COACH - DAY
text: MED. CLOSE SHOT -- Clara and Miss Martin. The former is
text: showing the effects of the rough ride, but the old lady is
text: hanging on grimly.
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVER'S SEAT - DAY
text: Dave straightens up, grinning.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (with relish)
text: Mighty rough stretch along here.
text: He whips up the team, at the same time weaving a little
text: unsteadily in his seat.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Like me to speel you a while?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Nope. I've had a few snorts but that
dialog: don't make no difference. Leas'ways,
dialog: never has...
dialog: (after a second's
dialog: pause)
dialog: Don't ever git wore out, and useless,
dialog: like me.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Who're them as say you are?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Harolday, for one. Oh, I ain't belly-
dialog: aching. Reckon he's entitled to his
dialog: opinion. But him and me never did
dialog: see eye to eye.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: It's constitootional, I reckon. Like
dialog: that step-daughter of his is crazy --
dialog: he's too sane. Believes In law and
dialog: order.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: What's wrong with law and order?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Depends on who's a-dishin' it out.
dialog: Never was good at takin' orders
dialog: meself. As for the law -- well, you'll
dialog: soon find out what that means 'round
dialog: these parts.
text: The coach hits a particularly bad bit of road and there is
text: an exclamation from inside. Dave grins and urges the team on
text: cheerfully.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE OUT
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE IN
scene_heading: EXT. RIM - ARIZONA COUNTRY - DAY
text: FULL SHOT -- as Dave pulls up the stage at the top of a long
text: downgrade and looks out appreciatively at the view. From
text: this crest of the rim, a vast expanse of country is visible.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: stage. Miss Martin thrusts her head out of the window.
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: Driver? Driver, what's the matter?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Nothin'. Restin' hosses. Git out and
dialog: stretch yore laigs if you want.
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: Resting horses? What for? I can see
dialog: with my own eyes it's downhill.
text: Dave brightens visibly at this challenge.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You in such an all-fired hurry, lady?
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: Certainly, we are in a hurry.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (beaming)
dialog: Well -- we'll hurry some.
text: His whip cracks like a rifle shot and the startled horses
text: literally jerk the heavy stage over the rim and down the
dialog: grade.
speaker_heading: LONG SHOT
text: grade, with the stagecoach bounding and reeling down the
text: narrow road and around the sharp bends.
speaker_heading: CLOSE FULL SHOT
text: Dave and Rocklin on stage as it thunders downhill. Dave is
text: leaning out and listening hopefully for the outcries from
text: within. None come. Rocklin is hanging on with both hands and
text: mildly amused.
scene_heading: INT. STAGECOACH - DAY
text: The two women are really being scrambled.
scene_heading: EXT. STAGECOACH - ARIZONA COUNTRY - DAY
text: CLOSE TWO SHOT -- Dave and Rocklin. Rocklin is as calm as if
text: he were walking. Dave is more and more pleased with himself.
text: He again leans out to listen.
speaker_heading: LONG SHOT
text: grade, with coach approaching in b.g. In f.g. the road narrows
text: and makes a sharp turn at the very edge of a precipice. There
dialog: is no possible way of getting the coach safely around this
text: turn except at a walk.
speaker_heading: LONG SHOT
text: road, from point of view of driver's seat, establishing the
text: same menace ahead.
speaker_heading: CLOSE TWO SHOT
text: Dave and Rocklin, as Rocklin glances out of the corner of
text: his eyes as if wondering whether or not Dave is too drunk to
text: perceive the disaster. He makes no move, however, to advise
dialog: or interfere.
speaker_heading: FULL SHOT
text: road; at danger corner, as stage comes in. At the very last
text: second, Dave pulls in the horses and negotiates the turn in
dialog: safety.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: stage. Dave grins at Rocklin, then listens for the outcry he
text: expects from the women within. The old lady's head bobs out
dialog: of the window.
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: (fiercely)
dialog: Now what's the matter. Why are we
dialog: stopping again?
text: Old Dave's mouth drops open, and as Rocklin begins to grin
text: at his discomfiture.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: EXT. STAN'S PLACE - DAY
text: FULL SHOT of lonely adobe which serves as a combination
text: roadhouse, stage station and bar. As the coach rolls into
text: f.g., a little Mexican boy (Pablo) runs out to change the
dialog: horses.
speaker_heading: PABLO
dialog: (as Rocklin swings
dialog: down)
dialog: Buenas noches, senor.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Buenas noches, amigo.
speaker_heading: PABLO
dialog: (grinning at the
dialog: friendly tone)
dialog: Ha llegado anticipademente, senor.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Tuvimos suerte en haber llegado.
text: He glances pointedly at Dave who is climbing down unsteadily
text: and Pablo bursts out laughing.
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE SHOT
text: on door of coach. As Dave comes into shot, Miss Martin's
text: head pops out of the window.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (gruffly)
dialog: We stop here.
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: Why do we stop here?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: If you wanta eat and stretch yore
dialog: laigs.
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: Will you please stop referring to my
dialog: legs!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You got some, ain't you?
text: He turns and lurches toward the roadhouse.
scene_heading: INT. STAN'S PLACE - DAY
text: FULL SHOT from doorway. It is a large barn-like room on one
text: side of which is a bar. On the other side is a fireplace and
text: a partition behind which is a rough dining table and benches.
text: Standing at the bar drinking with his back to the door is a
text: wizened little man, dressed in an odd assortment of ragged
text: garments of unrecognizable origin. On the counter is a
text: travelling prospector's pack, to which is strapped an
text: assortment of prospector's equipment, including a pick and
text: shovel. As Dave enters, the man (Zeke) turns around and
text: reveals a face even hairier than Dave's.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: (holding out his arms)
dialog: Dave!
speaker_heading: DAVE
text: (letting out a yell
dialog: and rushing to Zeke)
dialog: Why, Zeke, you two-legged old coot!
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: Zeke and Dave as they beat one another on the back.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Whar you been all these months?
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Up in the hills workin' my way down
dialog: the biggest hole you ever seed.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Good -- What's at the bottom of it?
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Nothin'!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (roaring with laughter)
dialog: What, again!!
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: Rocklin has entered and moved to the fire. Miss Martin and
text: Clara enter and stand in the doorway watching the scene at
text: the bar. A pale-faced, dyspeptic-looking man of about 45
text: (Stan) comes from the kitchen and approaches them
text: ingratiatingly.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Good evening, ladies. How about
dialog: something to eat?
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: (with a dubious look
text: toward the pair at
dialog: the bar)
dialog: Well -- if it won't take too long.
speaker_heading: STAN
text: (leading the way toward
dialog: the partition)
dialog: This way, ladies.
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE SHOT
text: bar. Dave has just fitted a cylindrical record of "She Was
text: Only a Bird in a Gilded Cage" to an old-type phonograph.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yep -- this is my last trip.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Old Harolday won't take back what he
dialog: said.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: What'd he say?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: "You're fired."
text: They both yell with laughter and slap one another on the
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: from fireplace. Rocklin is standing in f.g. looking down at
text: the fire and making the inevitable cigarette from his pocket
text: dip. Seated at the table are Clara and Miss Martin. From
text: o.s. comes the sound of Zeke and Dave singing to the
text: phonograph record. Miss Martin glares indignantly in the
text: direction of the bar, obviously about to make a protest. At
text: this moment Stan comes from the kitchen with a large dish in
text: his hand which he dumps on the table.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: There you are, folks. Dig in and
dialog: help y'rselves.
text: Miss Martin, sitting forward eagerly, suddenly sees the dish
text: of meat and freezes.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: dish of meat. It is swimming in greasy brown gravy.
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: Miss Martin as she shudders dyspeptically and closes her
dialog: eyes.
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE SHOT
text: bar, as Stan comes from the table to Dave and Zeke.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Supper, Dave?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (noisily)
dialog: I'm drinkin' mine. Set 'em up.
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: table. Clara has filled a plate with food, which she offers
text: to her aunt.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Auntie --
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: With my dyspepsia? Do you want to
dialog: kill me?
text: Clara hesitates for a second, then looks across to Rocklin.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Aren't you going to have any supper?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Reckon so.
text: He comes to table and begins to help himself. There is a
text: loud burst of laughter from the bar.
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: Young man, that driver's had all the
dialog: liquor he can take.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Has he?
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: You know he has. You're not a complete
dialog: fool, are you?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
text: Frequently.
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: (to Clara, furiously)
dialog: The rudeness of people in these parts
dialog: is appalling!
text: Clara looks apologetically at Rocklin, then away again
text: nervously. Suddenly, she sees something o.s. and drops her
text: knife and fork with a little start.
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE SHOT
text: window. A thin, unpleasant-looking face is seen through the
text: glass. The windowpane is defective and so distorts the lower
text: part of the face into a hideous smile. It is the younger of
text: the two men who were watching the coach outside the hotel.
speaker_heading: PANNING SHOT
text: on kitchen door as Stan comes through with a dish of potatoes.
text: A man's voice is heard o.s. and he pulls up abruptly.
speaker_heading: BOB CLEWS' VOICE

speaker_heading: JACKSON

speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: That's right -- shot in the back --

speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: as Rocklin comes out of the thoughtful mood in which he has
dialog: been plunged by the information about Red Caldwell and notes
text: the by-play between Clews and Clara. He frowns and makes a

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (chuckling and pointing

speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
text: He's outside tryin' to explain away
text: a hide.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Eh?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (indicating food)
dialog: Seems we're eatin' stolen beef.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Somebody's loco. Stan might have
dialog: given house-room to bit o' dead beef,
dialog: but he'd never be fool enough to
dialog: leave the hide lyin' around.
dialog: (to Zeke)
dialog: How 'bout it, Zeke?
text: Zeke opens his mouth to speak, and slowly folds up, sliding
text: down the wall to the floor.
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: as Clews comes from the fireplace and joins the group.
speaker_heading: BOB CLEWS
dialog: That's the way it is, Dave.

speaker_heading: DAVE

speaker_heading: BOB CLEWS
dialog: That's right -- your old pal Bob

dialog: Hey, Stan -- don't let 'em hang
dialog: nothin' on you, you ain't done.
dialog: They're just a couple of fourflushers --
dialog: the pair of 'em, everybody knows
dialog: that.
text: Jackson addresses everyone present with an indulgent Smile.
speaker_heading: JACKSON

dialog: Me an' Bob'll look after him. We're
dialog: his friends -- come on, Bob.
dialog: (as they steer Dave
dialog: through door)
dialog: Careful now -- don't hurt him.
text: They exit. Rocklin stands frowning a second, then turns toward
text: the table where Stan is making a show of clearing dishes,
dialog: etc.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (quietly to Stan)
dialog: How are things standin' now between
dialog: you an' the law?
dialog: (indicates direction
dialog: Jackson went out)
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: (not wanting to talk
dialog: about it particularly)
dialog: All right, I reckon --
dialog: (looks at Rocklin;
dialog: more confidently)
dialog: I guess this bill of sale --
dialog: (indicates it in Vest
dialog: pocket)
dialog: -- kinda winded him.
text: Rocklin's lips curl in a wise smile.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Good thing you saved it.
text: Zeke is discovered on all fours crawling around on the floor

dialog: for something.
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: (mystified)
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Zeke turns his hairy face up toward Miss Martin.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Musta been dreamin' -- Thought I was

speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: (wearily)
dialog: There ain't no gold here.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: (takes it)
dialog: There ain't even a pot.
text: The door leading from the barn opens and Jackson enters
text: followed by Clews a few steps behind.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: How is he?
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Went to sleep soon's we laid him
dialog: down.
dialog: (pulling off hat again)
dialog: Sorry to have a ruckus in front of

speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: of the group, with Clews looking significantly at Jackson,

speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: (finally speaks)
dialog: But if anything was to happen to the
dialog: ladies, I'd feel -- to blame.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Don't.
text: He turns abruptly and walks out the front door to the coach.
text: Jackson stares after him a moment, uncertain. Now he turns
dialog: to the women.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: You ladies want he should drive?
text: Miss Martin hesitates.
speaker_heading: BOB CLEWS
dialog: I'll be more'n glad to accommodate

dialog: You're in deep enough, Clint.
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: (disgusted, to Rocklin)
dialog: I've called for all I've got.
dialog: (spreads out his cards)
dialog: Full house.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: No good.
dialog: (spreads his hand)
dialog: Kings up. Your third queen is dead.
text: Rocklin starts raking in the pot. Clint, almost hysterical,
text: jumps up, draws his gun and thrusts it almost into Rocklin's
text: face. The other players roll away from the line of fire.
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: You -- mister -- get away from that
dialog: table. And get out of here. Maybe
dialog: from now on you'll know a full house
dialog: beats two pairs -- four-flusher!
text: Rocklin, his hands outspread, slowly straightens up, rises
text: and backs away. At the foot of the stairs, he turns
text: deliberately and walks upstairs. When he disappears from
dialog: view --
scene_heading: CLINT - WITH OTHERS AT THE POKER TABLE
text: Clint breaks the tension, looking from one to the other.
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: No man can run a bluff on me.
text: There is a cold silence.
speaker_heading: PAP
dialog: (finally)
text: He wasn't armed.
speaker_heading: CAP
dialog: I don't like to tell men how to play
dialog: cards unless I'm settin' in -- but I
dialog: mebbe ought to have spoken up.
dialog: (directly to Clint)
dialog: That Queen was dead, Clint -- and
dialog: you know it.
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: (arrogantly)
dialog: When anybody plays poker with me,
dialog: they play my game or not at all.
speaker_heading: CAP
dialog: You can't just go makin' your own
dialog: rules, Clint --
dialog: (starts for the bar --
dialog: stops and turns)
dialog: -- an' if I was you I'd hightail

speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: (jolted)
dialog: Comes back?
speaker_heading: CAP
dialog: (wearily)
dialog: He's the kind.
text: Cap turns and resumes his trek to the bar. Suddenly he stops
text: before reaching it and is looking up, o.s.
text: THE TOP OF STAIRS FROM CAP'S ANGLE
text: Rocklin is standing there grimly surveying the situation. As
text: he starts down the stairs...
text: THE GROUP AROUND THE POKER TABLE
text: They are staring o.s. Clint is very uneasy. And now Rocklin
text: moves slowly into the scene.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (with deadly calm)
dialog: I've come for my money.
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: (nervously pleasant)
dialog: It's all yours, mister -- Cap, there --
dialog: Cap is an old gambler -- he says you
dialog: were right all the time.
text: Clint again looks around for approval, but gets no response.
text: Rocklin comes slowly forward, picks up the money from the
text: table and turns back to the stairs. As he reaches the foot
text: of the stairs, he turns and looks straight at Garvey with a
text: peculiar expression.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: By the way, Judge -- the name is

speaker_heading: FADE OUT
scene_heading: INT. ROCKLIN'S BEDROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY
text: TRUCKING SHOT -- on a small cracked mirror in which can be

text: singing, atrociously off key.
speaker_heading: SINGER'S VOICE
text: She was only a bird in a gilded
dialog: cage...
dialog: (etc.)
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK to show that the owner of tie voice is
text: Rocklin, who has almost finished shaving. As he scrapes his
text: chin and whistles, peering at himself in the little cracked
text: mirror, he hears the sound of the door opening and turns,
text: then ducks quickly as a boot flies past him, just missing
text: the mirror. There is the sound of the door slamming and
text: Rocklin grins. He picks up the boot and goes to the door
text: leading to Dave's room.
scene_heading: INT. DAVE'S BEDROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY
text: As Rocklin enters, Dave is discovered almost dressed sitting
text: on the bed. Rocklin, glad to see him, smiles and tosses the

speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: How you feelin'?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: After that singin'? -- Thirsty.
dialog: (pulls on his boot)
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (evidently not aware

speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (closing door to Dave's

dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: BOB CLEWS
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: Looks like you stirred things up
dialog: around here last night, stranger.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: That all you came to say?
speaker_heading: BOB CLEWS
dialog: No. I got a message for you.
dialog: (getting no response)
dialog: From Old Man Harolday. Wants to see
dialog: you out front.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: What about?
speaker_heading: BOB CLEWS
dialog: Maybe he wants to thank you for
dialog: teaching that pup of his a lesson.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (after a second)
dialog: I'll be down.
text: Clews hesitates for a second as if anxious to wake sure he

scene_heading: INT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY
text: MED. SHOT -- Dave, at the bar, grabbing a bottle, pours
text: himself a drink which he sinks in one draught. He shudders

scene_heading: MED. SHOT - FROM THE BAR
text: with Dave in f.g., and SHOOTING TOWARD the street. A group

speaker_heading: PANNING SHOT
text: from Rocklin's ANGLE. CAMERA PANS OVER the groups in the

text: CAMERA PANS to include Arly and Juan.
dialog: TRUCKING SHOT ON
text: Rocklin as he takes in the situation. With a grim look, he

text: Suddenly, there is the clatter of a horse's hooves and Arly

text: barring Rocklin's progress.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (imperiously)
dialog: Is your name Rocklin?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (coldly)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (contemptuously)
dialog: I want that money you took from my
dialog: brother last night.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Are you crazy? Or just ignorant?
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (flaming)
dialog: You took it at the point of a gun --

speaker_heading: TRUCKING SHOT

speaker_heading: ARLY

scene_heading: INT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY
text: TRUCKING SHOT -- Rocklin, as he continues his forward movement

speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Whiskey!
scene_heading: EXT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY
text: CLOSE SHOT -- Arley with the smoking gun still in her hand.
text: She stares wildly after Rocklin for a second, then wheels
text: her horse violently toward the group which includes Cling
dialog: Harolday and Bob Clews.
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE SHOT
text: group surrounding Clews and Clint Harolday. The clatter of
text: hoofs is heard and Arly gallops furiously into shot.
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: You lied to me, didn't you?
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: I...
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: Don't think I'll forget this. Making
dialog: a fool of me in front of the whole
dialog: town.
text: Before Clint can reply, she wheels the mare and gallops out
dialog: of shot.
scene_heading: INT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY
text: MED. SHOT -- as the customers, with Dave in f.g., mill around
dialog: Rocklin.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Boy, oh boy, was that a near thing!
dialog: She'd just as soon have hit you as
dialog: missed. You don't know how lucky you
dialog: were, son.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Don't I?
dialog: (indicating whiskey
text: with a sickly grin)
dialog: Why d'you think I need this?
text: He sinks the whiskey and begins to pour himself another. At
text: the same time, the swing-doors open and Bob Clews comes
text: through. AS Rocklin raises the glass to his lips, Bob Clews
text: hits him on the back, causing him to spill the whisky.
speaker_heading: BOB CLEWS
dialog: Funniest sight I ever seen.
text: There is a moment's pause. Then with a slow, grim smile of
text: satisfaction, Rocklin turns and knocks Bob Clews off his
dialog: feet.
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE SHOT
text: with Bob Clews on the floor, tugging at his gun. As it comes
text: free of the holster, Rocklin brings his heel down on Clews'
text: wrist, grinding on it with his whole weights. Then, kicking
text: the gun out of reach, Rocklin steps back. Bob Clews sits up,
text: clutching his wrist and weaving back and forth.
speaker_heading: BOB CLEWS
dialog: (moaning)
dialog: You broke it! You broke it!
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Try another trick like that on me
dialog: and it'll be worse.
speaker_heading: BOB CLEWS
dialog: I never played you no trick. You
dialog: broke my wrist.
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
text: to include the bystanders. They look at Bob Clews without

speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: at bar, Dave has taken the bottle from Cap and is refilling
text: Rocklin's and his own glass ecstatically.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (gurgling with delight)
dialog: Oh boy -- has somebody come to town!
text: He sinks both drinks quickly and is about to refill them
text: when Cap takes the bottle from him.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (to Cap)
dialog: Where'll I find Judge Garvey?
speaker_heading: CAP
text: He rooms behind his office down the
dialog: street. Don't usually pull up the

speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (putting down money)
dialog: He will this morning.
dialog: (to Dave)
dialog: See you later, old-timer...

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: EXT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Clint Harolday is seen at the window peering furtively toward

text: Now Garvey appears at the window.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY
text: Rocklin, FROM Garvey's ANGLE as he leaves the Sun-Up and
text: starts toward the Judge's office.
scene_heading: EXT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Garvey and Clint, at the window. From their expressions it
text: is apparent that anxious words are passing between them, and
text: now Clint suddenly drops from sight.
scene_heading: ROCKLIN APPROACHES - LOOKS THE PLACE OVER - AND ENTERS
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY
text: ON Arly and Juan, mounted. They see Rocklin going into
text: Garvey's place.
scene_heading: INT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: MED. SHOT -- TOWARD door, with Garvey at desk in f.g. The
text: door opens and Rocklin enters.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: (effusively)
dialog: Oh, come in, Mr. Rocklin. Come right
dialog: in.
text: Rocklin looks him over for a second, then comes quietly to
dialog: the desk.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: I understand you were Red Caldwell's
dialog: lawyer?
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: (immediately on guard)
dialog: I was.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Know anything about this?
text: He takes out a letter and hands it to Garvey. The latter
text: takes it slowly, handling it as if it were dangerous. He
text: looks from the letter to Rocklin and back again. Then
text: reluctantly, he opens it and begins to read.
speaker_heading: LETTER -- It reads:
dialog: Dear Mr. Rocklin:
dialog: Glad you have made up your mind to take the job. Enclosed
dialog: find train fare and $150 advance on wages.
dialog: Yours faithfully,
dialog: J. Caldwell
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: Rocklin and Garvey. The latter looks up from the letter
text: completely bewildered.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: I don't understand. Job? What job?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Foreman.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: (gaping)
dialog: On the "K.C."?
dialog: (trying to take it in)
dialog: But -- but why should he want you?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Why not? Good foremen don't grow on
dialog: bushes.
text: There is a little pause, with Garvey still bewildered.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: (thinking hard)
dialog: Is that your only motive for coming
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: What other motive could I have?
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: I don't know -- It's just that Red
dialog: Caldwell was a peculiar man -- had a
dialog: funny way of doing things.
text: He studies Rocklin a short moment, then sits back comfortably
dialog: and relieved.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Rocklin, that
dialog: you've been brought all this way on
dialog: a fool's errand, but -- I'm afraid
dialog: the deal's off.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Off?
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: I don't want to be too hard on you,
dialog: but as executor of the estate I have
dialog: to consider the interests of the new
dialog: owner. How about, say, a hundred in
dialog: full settlement?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (thoughtfully)
dialog: Well --
text: There is a knock on the door. Garvey rises and speaks on his
text: way to the door.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: That's my last word -- think it over.
text: Garvey opens the door, and Miss Martin stalks in followed by
dialog: Clare.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: (graciously)
dialog: How do you do, ladies --
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: (icily)
dialog: You are Judge Garvey, I presume.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Yes -- and you are --
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: Miss Martin -- and my niece, Clara
dialog: Caldwell.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: (reaching for a chair)
dialog: Of course -- of course --
text: Miss Martin sits stiffly as she eyes Rocklin coldly.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: You came at a very opportune moment,
dialog: madam. This gentleman claims to have
dialog: some sort of a letter from the late
text: Mr. Caldwell, engaging him as foreman
dialog: of the "K.C."
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: What!
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (to Garvey)
dialog: What do you mean -- claims to have? --
dialog: You saw it, didn't you?
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: (before Garvey can
dialog: answer)
dialog: You can't hold us to account for
dialog: every promise made by that man.
dialog: Everyone knows he wasn't responsible
dialog: for his actions half the time. And
dialog: if you think I'd have you as a foreman --
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (finds it hard to
dialog: control himself)
dialog: Listen, lady -- I'd rather walk for
dialog: somebody else, than ride for you.
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: Well -- the impudence --
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: All I come for this morning was to
dialog: pay beck the hundred and fifty Red
dialog: Caldwell sent in advance.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Oh, no
text: They all turn and stare at her.
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: Don't interfere, Clara. Of course he
dialog: must pay it back.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: The railway fare -- well, I reckon
dialog: we can check that up against the
dialog: time lost and call it quits.
text: (throws down a roll
text: of bills in front of
dialog: Garvey)
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (summoning up her
dialog: courage)
dialog: But, Mr. -- er -- I don't know your
dialog: name...
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (raising his hat)
dialog: Rocklin, miss.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Mr. Rocklin, it isn't fair for you
dialog: to pay anything back.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: That's how I'd prefer it, If you
dialog: don't mind, miss -- never did care
dialog: fer owing favors to no one --
dialog: especially women.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (as if she had been
dialog: struck)
dialog: Oh!
text: The sound of rapid steps approaching from outside is heard
text: and they all look toward the door.
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: on door, as it opens to admit Arly. Ignoring everyone in the
text: room except Garvey, she comes abruptly to the desk, with the
text: riding quirt dangling from her wrist.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: I've just heard they let George Clews
dialog: out of penitentiary and that he's
dialog: headed this way. You might tell him
dialog: from me, if he sets foot on the Santee
dialog: Ranch, I'll shoot him on sight.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: But really, Miss Arly, why should
dialog: you deliver your message through me?
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: You have mutual friends.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: If you're referring to Sheriff
dialog: Jackson...
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: I am.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: But that's absurd. The fact that he
dialog: employs one of the Clews brothers
text: doesn't make the other his friend.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (contemptuously)
dialog: Have it your own way; but it'd be
dialog: fair to warn him, because I mean it.
text: For the first time, she appears to be conscious of the
text: presence of the other women.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: (hastening to change
dialog: the conversation)
dialog: Oh, Miss Caldwell, this is Miss
dialog: Harolday -- Miss Martin, Miss
dialog: Caldwell's aunt. You should know one
dialog: another, seeing you'll be neighbors.
dialog: Miss Harolday runs the Santee Ranch
dialog: for her stepfather. She's a famous --
dialog: ah -- horsewoman in these parts.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (with ingenuous
dialog: enthusiasm)
dialog: I know. I saw you ride into town
dialog: this morning. You looked lovely.
dialog: Just what I'd like to be.
text: Arly stares at her unbelievingly for a second.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (slowly, a bit
dialog: flustered)
dialog: Yes?
text: She looks slowly from Clara to Rocklin, as if suspecting
dialog: collusion.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (completely innocent)
dialog: Oh, this is Mr. Rocklin. He drove us
dialog: in from Garden City last night. He...
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (dead pan)
dialog: I already met Miss Harolday.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (stonily, to Rocklin)
dialog: I've a message for you -- from
dialog: Harolday.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (murmuring)
dialog: What, again?
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: He wants you to come down to the
dialog: office.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: He's got a proposition to make --
dialog: about riding for him. Sixty a month.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Hmmm -- That's a foreman's wages.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (suddenly exploding)
dialog: I wouldn't offer you a red cent.
dialog: (controlling herself)
dialog: But it's his money.
dialog: (bitingly)
dialog: And the way things are shaping, maybe
dialog: we could do with somebody as mean as
dialog: you around the ranch.
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: (pushing her way
dialog: forward)
dialog: I warn you, you're making a great
dialog: mistake. This man is no good.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Auntie!
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (to Rocklin ignoring
dialog: Miss Martin)
dialog: Well? D'you want the job?
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: Rocklin, as he stares at Arly with an enigmatic expression.
text: Suddenly, he seems to make up his mind.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (indicating the door)
dialog: Lead the way.
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: as Arly turns abruptly on her heel and exits the way she
text: came. Rocklin makes a little gesture to the ladies with his
text: hat and follows. As he goes, Juan, who has been leaning
text: against the doorpost, follows, closing the door behind him.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (after they have gone)
dialog: Auntie, why did you have to say that?
dialog: I simply don't understand you...
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: (cutting in, grimly)
dialog: But I understand you.
dialog: (scathingly)
dialog: I'd be ashamed of myself. Throwing
dialog: myself at a man like that.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: I... I...
dialog: (suddenly bursting
dialog: into tears)
dialog: Oh, you're horrid -- horrid. I wish
dialog: I'd never come.
text: She turns abruptly and drops onto the couch by the window.
text: CAMERA PANS TO HOLD A CLOSE TWO SHOT of Garvey and Miss
dialog: Martin.
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: You must excuse her. She's young.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: And inexperienced.
text: Garvey leans back in his chair and smiles.
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: (significantly)
dialog: And young people must be protected
dialog: from themselves at times -- don't
dialog: you agree?
text: Miss Martin throws him a quick look, which he returns
dialog: steadily.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
text: (at last, with a grim
dialog: echo of a smile)
dialog: Exactly.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY
text: Arly and Rocklin walking along the street, not far from
text: Harolday's office. Rocklin glances back toward Julio, who is
text: following a few paces behind them. He rides his horse and is
text: leading Arly's.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (to Arly, indicating
dialog: Julio)
dialog: Does he always follow you?
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (defiantly)
dialog: He's not following me -- he's with
dialog: me -- he's always with me.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (takes it mildly)
dialog: Oh -- just an old Indian friend.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (straight at him)

speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: I've just hired a man named Rocklin
dialog: and said you made me do it. Sixty
dialog: dollars and he 'll earn it -- while
dialog: he lasts.
text: There is a little pause. Harolday's face is completely dead

dialog: Arly.
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Why did you do it, Arly?
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: So I can fire him. I hate him. Clint
dialog: and he quarrelled last night. Clint
dialog: lied about it and I made a fool of

speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: (with a little sigh)
dialog: All right. Send him in.
text: Arly goes to the door and opens it.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Come in.
text: Rocklin comes in and Arly exits without a word, closing the
text: door behind her.
speaker_heading: REVERSE SHOT
text: as Rocklin comes from the doorway into f.g. of shot, facing
text: Harolday, who is seated on the far side of the desk.
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: Mr. Rocklin, what happened between
dialog: you and my son last night?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Poker.
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: Hmmm. About this suggestion of you
dialog: working for me.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: It's your suggestion, not mine.
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: Ye-es. Sixty dollars is big money.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (turning to go)
dialog: If you've changed your mind...
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: No, no.... Wait a minute. I take it
dialog: you've had the experience.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Enough for Red Caldwell to hire me
dialog: as foreman.
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: Oh -- had Caldwell hired you?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Yeah -- but I won't ride for the new
dialog: owners -- so that leaves me open.
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: I see -- Were you a friend of Red's?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: No -- I guess he just heard about
dialog: me.
text: A sudden clatter of feet is heard and all eyes turn toward
text: the door.
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: as Dave, followed by Arly and Juan, bursts in. His eyes go
text: around the room quickly until he finds Rocklin.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (as excited as a
dialog: schoolboy)
text: George Clews is in town. He's seen
dialog: what you done to Bob and he's a-
dialog: lookin' for you.
text: They all look quickly toward the window.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY
text: LONG SHOT -- from stagecoach office window. The center of
text: the street is clear and men's heads are peering from doorways.
scene_heading: INT. HAROLDAY'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY
text: MED. SHOT -- group at window, looking into street.
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
text: The street is clear.
text: Dave turns and looks curiously at Rocklin, who frowns
dialog: impatiently.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (to Dave irritably)
dialog: Tell him I'll be out in the street
text: in front of the saloon.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (dashing out, radiant)
dialog: Uh-huh!
scene_heading: INT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY
text: The place is quite full and the atmosphere is one of
text: expectancy despite the outward casualness of the patrons. A
text: group lolls near the window, looking toward the stage office.
text: At the door a couple of customers peer out over the swinging
text: doors. The bar supports other customers engaged in various
text: private conversations but all are mindful of the presence of
text: George Clews who, with his brother, Bob, stands at the bar's
text: center, morosely toying with a glass of whisky in front of
text: him. He is quite conscious of the subtle glances of the
text: others, but regards them all with disdain. He downs his drink,
text: and speaks his thought to Bob.
speaker_heading: GEORGE CLEWS
dialog: I'm gonna get his ears.
text: Suddenly Old Dave appears in a high state of excitement, and
text: halts with the swinging doors half open.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: Hi you, George Clews --
text: George Clews turns.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Rocklin says if you don't come out,
dialog: he'll come in here after you, an'
dialog: tear you apart.
text: George Clews frowns. His eye catches sight of a king-size
text: glass of beer being slid across the bar to Shorty Davis,
text: standing alongside him. That quick, Clews beats Shorty to
text: the glass and hurls it at Dave, who ducks out. Cap,
text: anticipating trouble, brings a sawed-off shotgun up from
text: under the bar and now watches Clews and Shorty.
speaker_heading: SHORTY
dialog: (taps Clews)
dialog: That was my beer, you know.
speaker_heading: GEORGE CLEWS
dialog: (nastily)
dialog: If he comes in again -- I'll throw
dialog: you.
text: Before Shorty can reply, Clews yanks his hat down over the
text: little fellow's eyes, and gives him a backward shove that
text: sends him sprawling into a corner where we leave him
text: struggling to get his hat off. The crowd resents this, but
text: doesn't dare do anything, except Cap, who holds his shotgun
dialog: in sight.
speaker_heading: CAP
dialog: (to the Clews)
dialog: That does it, boys -- you know where
text: the door is.
speaker_heading: GEORGE CLEWS
dialog: (to Bob)
dialog: Com-mon -- I'll get his ears.
speaker_heading: CAP
dialog: Not until I get my money --
text: George and Bob Clews are now a few steps from the bar. They
text: have turned as Cap spoke and are looking at the shotgun.
speaker_heading: CAP
text: There's three drinks and a broken
dialog: beer glass.
speaker_heading: GEORGE CLEWS
dialog: (to Bob, after a
dialog: second's deliberation)
dialog: Pay 'im.
text: George turns and starts for the doors as Bob comes back to
text: the bar to settle up.
speaker_heading: GEORGE CLEWS
dialog: I'll get his ears.
text: ON PAP FOSSLER AND THE OTHERS AT WINDOW - AS GEORGE CLEWS
text: BURSTS OUT THROUGH THE DOORS
speaker_heading: PAP
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: That Rocklin'll kill him for sure.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: Le's hope.
scene_heading: EXT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY
text: As George Clews steps outside, a mangy mongrel dog, basking
text: close by, evidently recognizes him and tails it away, leaving
text: George blinking at him.
speaker_heading: LONG SHOT
text: Rocklin -- FROM George's ANGLE. He is walking slowly forward
text: down the middle of the street.
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: George, looking baffled by the steady approach.
speaker_heading: GEORGE CLEWS
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: I'm coming -- and you'd better run!
text: He steps down from the sidewalk into the street and then
text: stands still again.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: Rocklin -- CAMERA MOVING WITH him as he comes slowly and
text: steadily forward.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: George. His hands are on his guns, but drunk or not, he has
dialog: too much sense to draw too soon.
scene_heading: EXT. STAGECOACH OFFICE - DAY
text: MED. SHOT -- Harolday watching from behind the window of his
text: office. Behind Harolday are Julio and Arly. The latter makes

dialog: her.
scene_heading: INT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: MED. CLOSE SHOT -- as Garvey, Miss Martin and Clara watch
text: the scene below -- Garvey and Miss Martin excitedly and Clara
text: in great distress.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL - DAY
text: CLOSER SHOT -- men in hotel doorway, taut with excitement.
speaker_heading: FULL SHOT
text: Rocklin -- SHOOTING PAST George, whose hands are on his gun
text: butts. Rocklin's thumbs are hooked in his belt as he continues
text: slowly forward, his eyes fixed on George's.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Draw a gun and I'll kill you.
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: George, as he stands bewildered and open- mouthed. Rocklin
text: enters scene, suddenly whips out his gun and brings it
text: crashing down alongside George's head. The barrel strikes
text: though the crown of his hat and he goes down like a pole-
text: axed steer.
scene_heading: INT. HAROLDAY'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY
text: MED. CLOSE SHOT -- group at window. Arly gives an involuntary
text: exclamation of pleasure, which she instantly checks, then
text: she moves abruptly out of shot, followed by Juan. Harolday
text: continues to stare frowningly out of the window.
scene_heading: INT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: MED. CLOSE SHOT -- group at window, with Garvey obviously
text: disapponted, Miss Martin bridling and Clara showing obvious
dialog: relief.
scene_heading: EXT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY
text: MED. SHOT -- Rocklin and crowd as they swirl around him
text: offering congratulations. Dave pushes his way through the
text: crowd and thumps Rocklin on the back in wild enthusiasm. At
text: the same time, the sound of a horse cantering is heard, and
text: Jackson comes into shot.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: (to Rocklin)
dialog: Hey, you! What's this you been up
dialog: to?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: I just laid a gun barrel over the
dialog: head of a drunk friend of yours --
dialog: same as you did over Dave's here
dialog: yesterday.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Eh?
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: (blustering)
dialog: I don't know what you're talking
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: You're a liar!
text: He turns contemptuously and begins to move back towards the
text: stage office completely ignoring Jackson, who rides alongside
text: blusteringly.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Now you lookee here, young feller.
dialog: You go on talking that way and you'll
dialog: find yourself in trouble.
text: The crowd which has been following now begins to razz him
text: openly. He turns and glares, but without effect. He gives a
text: final shout to Rocklin.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Don't say you ain't been warned.
text: Pulling his horse around, he sets off in a lope up the street.
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: as Miss Martin comes along the street, determinedly, followed
text: by Clara, until she is face to face with Rocklin outside the
text: stage office where Arly and Juan are mounted ready to move
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: (ignoring everyone
dialog: but Rocklin)
dialog: I saw you. I saw you strike that
dialog: poor man.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Yes, ma'am. As hard as I could.
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: You ruffian, you!
text: Clara pulls her sleeve imploringly.
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: Let me go!
dialog: (to Rocklin)
dialog: I knew the sort you were the moment
dialog: I set eyes on you. You can't fool
dialog: me! You're nothing but a common
dialog: adventurer! Come, Clara!
text: She takes Clara by the arm and sweeps past them towards the
text: hotel. Rocklin looks after them with a grim expression and
text: then up at Arly, who has been listening intently. She returns
text: his look steadily for a second. Then, with a mocking smile,
text: she wheels the mare and canters out of shot, followed by
text: Juan. He looks after her for a second; then with the same
text: grim look, enters Harolday's office.
scene_heading: INT. HAROLDAY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Harolday is standing at the window, looking toward the door,
text: having seen Rocklin approaching. The door opens and Rocklin
text: enters and resumes his conversation as though it were hardly
dialog: interrupted.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: -- Now what was that you were sayin'
dialog: about Caldwell?
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: You being hired by Red Caldwell only
dialog: confirms what I'd suspected -- he
text: was getting ready to fight.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (trying to get
dialog: information)
dialog: Fight? Who?
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
text: Organized rustling. Well at least --
dialog: that's my belief. Red was no friend
dialog: of mine. Too fond of taking the law
dialog: into his own hands. But he had my
dialog: sympathy. He'd been harder hit than
dialog: any of us. And on top of it all, he
dialog: lost his foreman.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: You mean, he quit on him?
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
text: He was shot -- in the back -- with a
text: bullet from the same caliber rifle
dialog: as got Red.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Got any ideas?
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: No -- Except that the man you just
text: pistol-whipped is in on it somewhere.
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: Pity you didn't kill him when you
dialog: had the chance.
text: Rocklin realizes that maybe Harolday is trying to throw a
text: curve -- trying to get him to talk.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Say -- it don't sound as if it's
dialog: goin' to be too easy for them wimmen
dialog: at the K.C.
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: (watching him keenly)
dialog: Want to go back and work for them?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: No, sir. And I ain't jumping at this
dialog: offer o' yours either because I don't
dialog: hold with working for wimmen.
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Oh, you mean my step-daughter. Well
dialog: don't worry. She won't interfere
dialog: with you...Rocklin -- I figure we've
dialog: been losin' cattle over a place called
dialog: Table Top -- it's the back way into
dialog: the Topaz Ranch and the perfect route
dialog: for rustlers -- I'm going to send
dialog: you up to the line camp -- you don't

speaker_heading: ROCKLIN

speaker_heading: ROCKLIN

text: throws an amused glance, at Juan, who has been watching with
text: an enigmatic expression. He returns Rocklin's look with a

scene_heading: EXT. TOPAZ RANCH HOUSE - DAY
text: Shelley, a Negro servant of the Harolday household, is

text: open the door -- peer furtively out -- then cross the porch
text: to its edge when he looks o.s. as though searching for
dialog: someone.
text: Shelley, meantime, has noticed Clint, but goes right on with
text: his sweeping. His only reaction is a disparaging glance over
text: his shoulder.
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: (turning to Shelley)
dialog: Have you seen Arly?
speaker_heading: SHELLEY
dialog: No, suh, Ah didn't see Miss Arly
dialog: today, but Ah seed her las' night,
dialog: and she shore was mad.
text: To emphasize his point, Shelley puckers his mouth in a
dialog: whistle.
speaker_heading: SHELLEY
dialog: Plenty mad!
text: Clint's face tightens as he anticipates what is in store for
text: him. Over the scene comes the gradually increasing sound of
text: a feminine voice, gayly humming the notes of a popular tune
text: of the period. Clint's strained features relax in a can-that-
text: be-Arly expression, while Shelley stops dead in the middle
text: of a sweep, and now both stare incredulously, o.s.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: From their ANGLE we first see only the corner of the house,
text: while the owner of the voice approaches from the other side.
text: Now Arly comes into view, entirely oblivious of Clint and
text: Shelley watching her. She seems more attractive, in a feminine
dialog: way, this morning. It may be the skirt and blouse she is
dialog: wearing. Then again it may be the flower she is, even now,
text: adjusting in her hair. The presence of the two men suddenly
text: startles her. The song ends abruptly, while her hands fall
text: quickly away from the flower.
speaker_heading: ARLY
text: As Arly moves toward the porch, Shelley snaps back to life
text: and resumes sweeping -- but furiously. Clint regards the

speaker_heading: CLINT
text: (as Arly leans down
dialog: to pick up the jacket)

text: Arly pays no attention to Clint. She is looking o.s. and
text: stops walking.

text: Tala, on his horse, as seen by Arly. Over the scene comes
text: Arly's voice calling from a distance.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Tala.
text: Tala reacts to the call by heading his horse at a slightly
dialog: different angle.
scene_heading: ARLY AND CLINT
text: Arly is looking o.s. toward Tala. Clint is now eyeing his
text: sister up and down quite openly. She turns her head now and
text: catches Clint looking her over.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (after a stilted pause)
dialog: Well --
speaker_heading: CLINT
text: (with a perplexed
dialog: smile)
dialog: What is this? --
text: A gesture of his hand indicates the way Arly has gotten
text: herself up. That quick, Arly's hand goes to the flower in
text: her hair. And, that quick, she guiltily withdraws it.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (bravely nonchalant)
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: What do I mean? --
text: Before he can explain, Tala pulls up in his horse and we
text: hear his voice over the scene.
speaker_heading: TALA'S VOICE
dialog: Good morning, Arliete.
scene_heading: ARLY, TALA AND CLINT
text: Tala sitting astride his horse smiles down at the girl.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: Good morning, Tala.
speaker_heading: TALA
dialog: You have make yourself very pretty
dialog: today.
text: Arly is jolted by Tala's innocent remark, and she can't help
text: giving Clint a little side glance in the way of reaction.
text: Clint has not missed Tala's crack nor Arly's glance, and
dialog: when she gives it to him he says:
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: (pleasantly)
dialog: See what I mean?
text: He tosses her an altogether knowing look now, and leaves,
text: going up the walk toward the house. Arly turns to Tala.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: Have my horse saddled and sent around
dialog: right away -- will you?
dialog: (then as a casual
dialog: afterthought)
dialog: You can have that Rocklin bring it.
text: She glances over her shoulder toward Clint going up the walk.
text: And then, looking back to Tala, finds he hasn't moved, but
text: remains smiling down at her.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: TALA
dialog: (easily)
dialog: Rocklin is not here.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (breathlessly)
dialog: He quit?
speaker_heading: TALA
dialog: He has gone to the line camp at Table
dialog: Top.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TALA
dialog: It was Mr. Harolday's orders.
text: Arly looks away. Her eyes stare blankly into space as she
text: struggles with the mixed emotions of anger and disappointment.
text: Tala, aware of her plight, slowly dismounts and comes to the
dialog: girl's side.
speaker_heading: TALA
dialog: (in a fatherly manner)
dialog: Why do you make your heart heavy
dialog: with thoughts of him, little one. --
dialog: He is not for you.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: Be quiet.
speaker_heading: TALA
dialog: He has made the choice, Arliete.
dialog: With your own eyes you saw it
dialog: yesterday.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (impatiently)
dialog: Oh --
speaker_heading: TALA
text: And she, too, has opened her heart
dialog: to him -- Already she has summoned
text: him to her.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (this turns her around)
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: TALA
dialog: Dave -- of the white beard -- carries
dialog: a letter to Rocklin -- It is from
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: How do you know that?
speaker_heading: TALA
dialog: I have just now met Dave, and he
dialog: tell me. -- So now he rides to Table
dialog: Top.
text: Arly is quiet a moment.
speaker_heading: TALA
dialog: Little one you --
speaker_heading: ARLY
text: (quickly, as she starts
dialog: for the house)
dialog: Oh, leave me alone.
speaker_heading: LONG SHOT

dialog: of Santa Inez, comes Harolday, still looking the distinguished
dialog: citizen.
text: HAROLDAY RIDES UP TO THE PORCH - CLOSE TO ARLY AND JULIO
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: Good morning, Julio -- morning Arly.
dialog: (to Julio as he
dialog: dismounts)
dialog: Fetch my briefcase -- it's on my
dialog: desk.
text: Julio exits.
text: HAROLDAY TURNS HIS ATTENTION TO ARLY WHO
text: still smarting under the disappointment about Rocklin, seems
text: lost in thought. After regarding her a moment Harolday speaks.
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: Looks like we're going to get that
dialog: land we've been wanting along the
dialog: river bottom.
text: Arly turns her eyes on Harolday, who continues.
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: I didn't tell you -- but I bought
dialog: the mortgage on the Hardman ranch,
dialog: and it's due today -- On my way over
dialog: there now.
text: Arly's eyes burn as she tosses her head slightly.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: Did you send that Rocklin to Table-
dialog: Top?
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: I did.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (furiously)
dialog: Well, let's get things straight.
dialog: This place was my mother's -- now
dialog: it's mine and Clint's -- It's true
dialog: you've been helping out -- but the
dialog: way things are going we'll soon be
dialog: able to pay you back every penny we
dialog: owe. Meanwhile, I'm running this
dialog: outfit and I expect to give the
dialog: orders.
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: You generally do.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: Why did you send Rocklin up to Table-
dialog: Top?
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: It seemed to me a good idea -- what
dialog: with all this rustling going on --
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: Who'd ever try driving cattle over
dialog: Table-Top? -- Unless they were crazy.
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: (coldly)
dialog: I don't agree with you. In any case --
dialog: if you must have it -- I'd no
dialog: intention of engaging a man at
dialog: foreman's wages just to gratify the
dialog: whims of a jealous woman!
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (dangerously)
dialog: You take care what you're saying.
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: (very controlled)
dialog: It's you should take care, my dear.
dialog: I'm afraid there's one man you can't
dialog: rawhide into jumping the way you
dialog: want. You've made a fool of yourself
dialog: over him once. Better watch out you
dialog: don't do it again.
text: He turns abruptly and walks off the verandah.
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: as Harolday comes from the verandah to his horse. Juan is
text: standing there with the briefcase which Harolday takes with

text: The CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE on Arly, who stands in furious
text: silence watching Harolday ride away.

speaker_heading: SHOT
text: of storm clouds gathering.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD NEAR TABLE-TOP - DUSK
text: A night shot of the mountain road near Table-Top. It is a
text: wooded section of the plateau, and occasional flashes of
text: lightning illuminate the big trees skirting the road. Dave,
text: in his wagon, looms out of the b.g., and as he nears the

text: he passes and continues hurriedly on his way, we
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
speaker_heading: FADE IN
scene_heading: INT. CABIN - NIGHT
text: CLOSE SHOT on a soiled and wrinkled envelope lying on a table.
dialog: It is addressed to:
dialog: Mr. Rocklin c/o Santee Ranch
text: The CAMERA PULLS BACK and Rocklin is revealed at the table,
text: looking down at the letter. His hat is tipped back on his
text: head, and his sleeves are rolled up. He is mixing dough in a
text: bowl sitting on the table near the letter, and his hands are
text: all gooey. Dave is discovered in front of the fireplace where
text: his outer shirt and socks are drying. It is dark outside,
text: but the storm has abated. Rocklin goes to a shelf near the
dialog: fireplace to get a pan.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (during the above)
dialog: Durn funny -- that storm quittin'
dialog: just about the time I get here.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: No funnier than you sloggin' through
dialog: it, just to deliver a letter from a
dialog: woman.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (disgustedly)
dialog: Reckon I'm gettin' to be more of a
dialog: fool the older I get.
text: Dave watches Rocklin at the table shaping the dough for
text: biscuits and putting it in the pan.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: When are we gonna get around to
dialog: readin' it?
text: Rocklin cannot help smiling a bit at the way Dave includes
dialog: himself in.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Thought I'd wait till mornin' --
dialog: might be bad news an' I wouldn't be
dialog: able to sleep.
text: Dave screws up his face in utter disgust and turns his
text: attention to his drying clothes.
text: Rocklin, meanwhile, takes a flour sack from the table, wipes
text: the dough from his hands and picks up the letter. He goes
text: over to the fireplace, opening the letter the while, and
text: sits on the bench. Dave, seeing this, edges discreetly around
text: in back of Rocklin in order to see over his shoulder.
text: The letter open, Rocklin takes out a roll of bills along
text: with the folded message. He lays the envelope on the bench.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Mmmm -- dineroo.
text: Rocklin places the money in his shirt pocket for the moment,
text: and opens the folded message.
text: LETTER. It begins with the usual Dear Mr. Rocklin.
text: Rocklin's voice is heard over the insert as he reads from
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN'S VOICE
dialog: (reading)
dialog: Forgive me if this letter is a trifle
dialog: incoherent, but I am terribly worried
dialog: and unhappy.
text: BACK TO SCENE.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Who wouldn't be -- livin' with that
text: ole screech owl.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (continues to read)
dialog: I am desperately in need of help and
dialog: advice from someone whom I feel I
dialog: can trust, and I am appealing to
dialog: you, because I regard you in the
dialog: same way my Uncle surely must have.
dialog: I heartily dislike and distrust Judge
dialog: Garvey --
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Huh -- Smart girl --
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (going on)
dialog: But my Aunt seems to have suddenly
dialog: revised her opinion of him, and now
dialog: wants me to place all my affairs in
text: the Judge's hands and return east.
dialog: Such is certainly not my wish.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (significantly)
dialog: Looks kinda like she's formed an
dialog: attachment.
text: Rocklin glares up to Dave.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: For the locality, I mean.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (continues reading)
dialog: I wanted so much to give ranch life
dialog: a trial, but fear circumstances are
dialog: against me, especially in view of
dialog: the recent Indian trouble --
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (explosively)
dialog: Indian trouble --
dialog: (in normal tone)
dialog: Good Lord, they ain't been any Indian
dialog: trouble around here in --
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (caustically)
dialog: You want to hear the rest of this?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (getting the inference)
dialog: Might's well -- come this far.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (reading)
dialog: I want to apologize for what took
dialog: place this afternoon. And I am
dialog: returning the 150, because I feel it
dialog: is rightfully yours. You must take
dialog: it. Faithfully yours, Clara Caldwell.
text: The letter finished, Rocklin regards it a moment, then slowly
text: returns it to the envelope as he gazes thoughtfully into the
dialog: fire.
text: Dave meantime straightens up -- scratches his shaggy top,
text: and turns his attention once more to his drying clothes.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (feeling his socks)
dialog: Well -- what do you make of it?
text: Rocklin continues looking into the fire as he lays the letter
text: back on the bench and takes out tobacco to roll a cigarette.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Somebody's sure bustin' to get her
text: out of there.
text: Dave sits alongside Rocklin and begins putting on his socks.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Indian trouble --
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: Wonder why the old lady's playin'
dialog: along?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (sourly)
dialog: Baaa -- Wimmen -- Who can ever figure
dialog: 'em?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Got to admit though, I feel a mite
dialog: sorry for the young'un -- nice little
dialog: tyke.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Too nice for this country.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (after a slight pause)
dialog: She's shore a pretty thing.
text: Rocklin has been mulling things over.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Don't know how I could help her --
dialog: even if I wanted to -- I don't know
dialog: any thing about this Garvey -- or
dialog: Caldwell -- or --
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Well, now -- I could mebbe help you
dialog: out some, there -- Fact, I could
dialog: tell you somethin' 'bout ole Red
dialog: that might be interestin'.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: You must have known him pretty well --
dialog: What kind of a man was he?
text: Rocklin goes to the table and resumes molding biscuits.
text: Dave has his boots on and is putting on his outer shirt.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Caldwell? -- The best -- cantankerous
dialog: cuss -- but a real cowman, believe
dialog: me -- He was a big feller, like
dialog: yourself -- Fact, you coulda passed
dialog: fer a blood relation, come to think
dialog: of it.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (casually, as he busies
dialog: himself with the
dialog: biscuits)
dialog: Was the Judge and Red friends?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (anigmatically)
dialog: That's what you'd say. Garvey managed
dialog: all Red's business. Besides which
dialog: they was regular drinkin' pals --
dialog: played poker together most nights --
dialog: tho' they do say Red got the worst
dialog: of it.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Red was a gambler, eh?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh, yeah -- reckon a pretty poor
dialog: one, tho' -- still you'd say him and
dialog: Garvey was friends.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (after a side glance
dialog: to Dave)
dialog: Anything ever happen to make you
dialog: think they weren't?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (moves close to Rocklin)
dialog: Rock -- I'm gonna tell you somethin'
dialog: I ain't never told anybody.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (with a slight smile)
dialog: Think you can trust me?
text: Dave grimaces his confidence.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: The last time I seen Red was the day
dialog: he died --
text: In the pause Rocklin remains silent.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: -- 'Twas in town -- he jus' come out
dialog: of the stage office. Tried to book
dialog: passage to Garden City but couldn't
dialog: on account I had a full load. --
dialog: Well, sir, he took me aside and give
text: me a printed sheet of paper and says,
dialog: "Read it." I looked it over and fer
dialog: as I could see it was a paper from
dialog: one of them Chicago sportin' firms,
dialog: tellin' how to manipulate trick
dialog: playin' cards.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
text: Marked cards.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Reckon so. -- Seems Red found some
dialog: cards and this paper in a coat one
dialog: of his friends loaned him one night.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Whose was it?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Well, now that's just what I asked --
dialog: but all he said, was that it belonged
dialog: to a good friend. Then he said he
dialog: wasn't waitin' fer the next coach,
dialog: but was ridin' over to see the
dialog: district judge about it alone.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: That's when they got him.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yes, sir -- 'bout a mile or so from
text: Stan's place. A bullet in the back
dialog: an' his pockets empty.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: How come you never told this before?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Who was there to tell? -- Sheriff
dialog: Jackson? -- Him an' Garvey's thick
dialog: as thieves.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: How about what's his name -- Harolday? --
dialog: He's no friend of the Judge's, is
dialog: he?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Hates his guts -- sure riles him to
text: see young Clint hangin' onto the
dialog: Judge's coattails. All the same, I
dialog: jus' decided to keep my mouth shut
text: and my eyes open.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: Even if it was Garvey Red was talkin'
dialog: about -- it don't follow that he
dialog: killed him.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No -- general opinion is that it was
text: rustlers.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Why would rustlers take the evidence
dialog: Caldwell had with him?
text: Rocklin moves away to a large earthen jug holding water as
dialog: Dave talks.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Looks to me if you get the man who
dialog: owned the marked cards, you get the
dialog: killer.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (drinking)
dialog: Funny tho' -- first the K.C. foreman --
dialog: then Caldwell -- an' now these women.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Lordy -- you ain't thinkin' somebody
dialog: might try bumpin' them?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (slowly, to himself)
dialog: I'm not so sure somebody hasn't tried
dialog: already --
dialog: (to Dave)
dialog: Remember, when we stopped to change
dialog: horses on the way Over from Garden
dialog: City --
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Shore -- you told me how Jackson and
text: Clews tried to frame Stan.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Yeah. Like they wanted to be sure
dialog: he'd keep his mouth shut about
dialog: something.
text: Dave sits down on a box sitting against the wall, directly
text: under the large earthen jug of water.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: And layin' that gun across my skull --
dialog: an' offerin' to drive the coach
dialog: themselves.
scene_heading: A SECTION OF THE CLEARING - MOONLIGHT
text: A dark, mysterious figure on a horse raises his rifle --
scene_heading: INT. OF CABIN - NIGHT
speaker_heading: SHOT.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (nods)
dialog: It was almost as if --
text: A shot splinters the windowpane and shatters the earthen jug
text: on the shelf directly above Dave's head. The contents pour
text: down on Dave and he topples over. Rocklin meanwhile has wiped
text: the lantern off the table and ducked. They are both on the
text: floor in the faint glow coming from the fireplace.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (going to Dave)
dialog: You all right?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (blustering)
dialog: Will be if I ever get dry.
text: Rocklin takes off his hat and puts his finger through two
text: holes drilled by the bullet.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Lookit that --
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Good Lord --
text: Rocklin puts the hat aside -- crawls over to his gun belt --
dialog: straps it on.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Come on --
text: He opens the door cautiously. Then sneaks out, followed by
dialog: Dave.
scene_heading: EXT. OF CABIN - MOONLIGHT - AFTER THE STORM
text: Rocklin and Dave stand close to the cabin, just clear of the
text: door, tensely scanning the surrounding darkness.
text: Water can be heard dripping from the cabin roof, and an owl
text: hoots in a near-by tree.
text: The sound of neighing horses comes from the direction of the
text: corral. Both men re-act.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: My team.
text: Almost immediately the neighing is repeated, but this time
text: from another direction entirely -- and from a distance.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: That's not your team.
text: He moves to the corner of the cabin, followed by Dave.
text: HORSE IS STOMPING NERVOUSLY
text: and now it starts away, galloping through the deep grass at
text: the edge of the clearing. Only the lower part of the animal
text: is seen, along with the legs of the rider.
text: ROCKLIN AND DAVE HEAR THE SOUND OF RETREATING HOOF BEATS
text: And they can barely make out their quarry riding hell-bent
text: toward the deep blackness of the trees.
text: Rocklin fires and runs out into the moonlight in the clearing --
text: Dave close behind.
text: Rocklin halts -- fires again -- and again. Dave fires.
text: The mysterious rider is now swallowed by the night.
text: Dave starts after him again. Looking back, he sees Rocklin
dialog: has not moved.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Come on --
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: No use -- he's gone.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Mebbe we winged him.
text: He starts through the wet grass alone. Rocklin turns back
text: toward the cabin.
scene_heading: DAVE - PLOUGHING THROUGH THE GRASS
text: He has reached the edge of the clearing where a slight
text: embankment leads to the level of the trees. He is just
text: starting up to higher ground when his eyes catch something
text: on the embankment, shining in the moonlight. It proves to be
text: a tobacco pouch bearing a steer's head of hammered sliver.
text: It is dry, so has evidently just been dropped. Dave pockets
text: it, and proceeds warily along the mystery rider's trail.
scene_heading: ROCLKLIN - WHO HAS JUST ABOUT REACHED THE CABIN
text: He looks back in Dave's direction, and then looking toward
text: the cabin, suddenly stops and tenses.
scene_heading: THE CABIN DOOR IS PARTLY OPEN
text: and through it Rocklin can plainly see an indistinct form
text: moving in the faint glow of the dying fire.
text: ROCKLIN DRAWS HIS GUN AND MOVES STEALTHILY TOWARDS THE CABIN
speaker_heading: DOOR
scene_heading: INT. OF CABIN - NIGHT
text: Rocklin has reached the entrance unheard, and silently watches
text: the strange figure, its back to him, now headed for the
text: fireplace with his saddlebag, taken from the bunk. He sees
text: the intruder start emptying his saddlebag on the bench in
text: the light of the fire. He sees him suddenly stop and pick up
text: something hidden from his view.
text: At that instant, Rocklin slams the door shut.
text: The intruder whirls around.
text: It is Arly -- tense -- and now defiant.
text: The two regard each other like vicious animals in the same
text: cage. Arly's heart is pounding, but you would never know it.
text: And now Rocklin, his gun away, starts closing in, slowly --
text: but Arly holds her ground -- her eyes never leaving his.
text: When Rocklin reaches Arly, he takes her one hand from behind
text: her back, and slowly forcing it up sees what is obviously
text: Clara's letter in her tightly clenched fist. He tries to
text: open her hand, and Arly, knowing she lacks the strength to
text: prevent it, suddenly whips out a knife with her free hand.
text: But that quick, Rocklin grabs the knife hand, and without
text: any apparent effort, wrenches it free of her grasp and tosses
text: it across the room, where it lands on the bunk. Arly relaxes
text: her grip on the letter meanwhile, and Rocklin gets it, and
text: tears it very deliberately, letting the pieces fall at her
dialog: feet.
text: He turns his back on her now, going over to his hat on the
dialog: floor.
text: Arly is furious in her helplessness and humiliation. And
text: Rocklin's smug manner isn't helping any. He picks up his hat
text: and, glancing at Arly, puts his finger once more through the
text: bullet holes.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (smiling wryly)
dialog: Not bad shootin'.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (right back at him)
dialog: You think I did that?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Sure -- to draw us away from here.
dialog: (looks at his hat)
dialog: You know, you cut it mighty close --
dialog: Good thing I ain't got brains enough
dialog: to fill it.
text: Rocklin puts his hat on. He sees Arly looking down at the
dialog: torn letter.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (suppressing smile)
dialog: Too bad you had to come 'way up here
dialog: through that storm for nothin'.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (affectedly)
dialog: I haven't minded a bit --
dialog: (harshly)
dialog: -- because I came up to fire you.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Oh --
dialog: (nods)
dialog: I see.
text: Rocklin goes toward the bunk with his saddlebag.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: Get out of here -- get off the Santee
dialog: and don't ever come back.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Mind if I wait for Dave? He ought to
dialog: be along any minute -- Be funny if
dialog: he winged that shadow of yours.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: If you mean Juan -- you're loco.
dialog: He's not even up here.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (mildly surprised)
dialog: You came up alone?
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (half believing her)
dialog: Then who was that we took out after?
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: The man who shot at you.
text: Rocklin sits on the bunk and casually picks up Arly's knife.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Who was he?
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: You mean you won't tell.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: I mean I don't know -- Why should I
dialog: lie to you?
text: That last from Arly brings a kind of smile to Rocklin's face --
text: a smile that says in effect -- "Are you kidding?" He gets up
text: from the bunk to go to the door, and finding himself still
text: holding Arly's knife, throws it back to her in a seemingly
text: casual manner. It passes too close to Arly for comfort and,
text: Rocklin just opening the door, gets the knife right back --
text: that close to his ear he feels the breeze. He looks at it,
text: quivering in the door. Then, moving to Arly in what could be
text: construed as a threatening manner, he takes her in his arms
text: and kisses her. Arly is caught completely unaware. Rocklin's
text: action disarms her. But it is, after all, what she really
text: wants, so before the kiss ends, Arly's arms slowly entwine
text: themselves around Rocklin's neck. In the middle of the kiss
text: Rocklin gently but forcefully takes her arms from around his
text: neck and puts her from him.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: I guess you forgot -- you jes' fired
dialog: me.
text: He goes to the bunk -- picks up his saddlebag, coat, etc.,
text: and starts for the door.
text: Arly has been silently watching.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (turning near the
dialog: open door)
dialog: So long.
text: Dave's voice is heard just outside the cabin door.
speaker_heading: DAVE'S VOICE
dialog: Hey, Rock --
text: Dave now rushes through the door, puffing and excited.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: -- He got away -- but guess what, I --
text: He sees Arly and pulls up abruptly.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (slowly to Dave)
dialog: You guess --
text: Rocklin gives Arly a disparaging side glance and starts out.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (to Dave, who is trying
dialog: to figure things out)
dialog: Come on.
scene_heading: EXT. OF CABIN - NIGHT
text: Rocklin is headed for the corral as Dave catches up to him.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (glancing back to the
dialog: cabin)
dialog: Fer a man who's got a despise fer
dialog: wimmin, you sure do get all snaggled
dialog: up with 'em.
scene_heading: INT. OF CABIN - NIGHT
text: Arly, her back to us, is standing in the open doorway watching
text: the two headed for the corral.
text: Her mood is evidenced by the manner in which she suddenly
text: slams shut the door. As she turns and leans against it, we
text: see tears in her eyes, and hear suppressed sobs. Her eyes
text: light on the bits of torn letter, and presently we see her
text: face set itself grimly, and now she walks toward the fireplace
text: and, passing the torn bite of paper, kicks at them viciously.

text: the hitching rail.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (as he dismounts)
dialog: You work for Harolday?
text: The man nods.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Here's one of his horses -- I'll
dialog: pick up my saddle later.
text: He enters the building.
scene_heading: INT. HAROLDAY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: PANNING SHOT on Harolday as he sits at the desk working on a
text: ledger. The sound of a door opening is heard. Harolday looks
text: up casually as if expecting a customer, then suddenly gapes.
text: CAMERA PANS to include doorway in which stands Rocklin.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Howdy...
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: (frowning)
dialog: I thought I sent you up to Table-
dialog: Top.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: (slowly)
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (taking off his hat)
dialog: Well, this, for one thing.
text: He pokes a finger through the hole in the crown. Harolday's
text: eyes narrow.
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: (after a little pause)
dialog: I told you you'd regret letting that
dialog: rat Clews off so easy.
text: Rocklin looks at him with a queer expression without replying.
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: What's the matter? Don't you think
dialog: it was him, then?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (slowly)
dialog: I been figgerin'. Don't seem
dialog: reasonable Clews was in condition to
dialog: take that sort of chance alone...
dialog: Besides -- how could he have known I
dialog: was up there -- that soon. And --
dialog: George Clews ain't the only one I've
dialog: run contrariwise to in this town.
dialog: There's that Mexican, for instance.
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: Juan?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: He as good as told me yesterday that
dialog: him and me was due for a run-in one
dialog: of those days.
dialog: (suddenly nodding
dialog: toward window)
dialog: And then there's him!
text: Harolday looks sharply toward the window.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY
text: MED. SHOT from office window. Clint is hurrying across from
text: the direction of the Sun-Up Saloon toward the office.
scene_heading: INT. OUTER STAGECOACH OFFICE - DAY
text: PANNING SHOT on Clint as he enters from street and crosses
text: to the door of Harolday's office.
scene_heading: INT. HAROLDAY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: MED. SHOT on door of inner office with Harolday at desk in
text: f.g. As the door opens it conceals Rocklin from Clint.
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: (excitedly)
dialog: I just heard that -- that Rocklin
dialog: was --
dialog: (sees Rocklin)
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (slowly)
dialog: Was what?
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: (subdued)
dialog: Was shot at last night.
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: (very calm)
dialog: Mr. Rocklin was just telling me all
dialog: about it.
dialog: (significantly)
dialog: Any idea who might have done it?
text: Clint looks quickly at Harolday and back at Rocklin with
text: frightened eyes.
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: Not me.
text: Rocklin makes no reply.
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: You ain't trying to pin it on me?
dialog: (his courage returning)
dialog: 'Cause if you are, you're in for a
dialog: big disappointment. I was over at
dialog: the Sun-Up playing poker with the
dialog: Judge and the rest of the boys till
dialog: early morning. If you don't believe
dialog: me, ask for yourself.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: All right. I believe you. But that
dialog: don't mean you couldn't tell a thing
dialog: or two as would help -- if you wanted.
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: (very nervous again)
dialog: What d'you mean?
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: Yes. What sort of thing would Clint
dialog: here know about, that would help
dialog: identify the man who tried to kill
dialog: you last night?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: This for one.
text: He pulls out the tobacco pouch which Dave found at Table-
dialog: Top.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Ever seen it before?
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: Clint as he stares wide-eyed at the pouch.
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: group, with Rocklin and Harolday both watching Clint intently.
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: (harshly)
dialog: Well, go on -- speak up. Did you
dialog: ever see it before?
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: (avoiding Harolday's
dialog: eye)
dialog: No. Course I didn't
text: (suddenly raging at
dialog: Rocklin)
dialog: Quit riding me! I don't know nothin'
dialog: about it I tell you. Jest because I
dialog: had a run-in with you over a game o'
dialog: cards, that don't mean I'd sneak up
dialog: on you in the dark and...
text: Rocklin's disdainful smile takes the speech out of Clint,
text: who just sort of runs out of words. Rocklin hesitates for a
text: second then moves toward the door.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: Harolday and Clint are at window looking past camera toward
text: the street. They see Rocklin carrying his saddle, walking
text: toward the Sun-Up. Shorty Davis hails Rocklin, says something
text: to him and points to the Sun-Up. Rocklin leaves, walking
dialog: faster.
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: (frowning deeply)
dialog: He means trouble.
text: He turns from camera toward the desk.
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: (still at window)
dialog: Aw, what do I care.
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
text: (turning on him with
dialog: cold fury)
dialog: Listen, I never did have much use
dialog: for you. You're a poor specimen at
dialog: the best; but as a would-be bad man
dialog: you're nothing but a laughing stock.
dialog: Why, the way you lied about that
dialog: pouch just now wouldn't have deceived
text: a six-year old.
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: I...
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: (harshly)
dialog: All right, let it go at that. But I
dialog: got myself to think of. It wouldn't
dialog: suit me at all just now to have you
dialog: shown up in public for what you are
dialog: by that trouble-shootin' cowhand. My
dialog: advice to you is to get out of the
dialog: district and stay out.
dialog: (taking a key from
dialog: his vest pocket)
dialog: You'll find some money in the safe
dialog: at the ranch. Take what you need and
text: put the key in the desk drawer. Now
dialog: get.
scene_heading: INT. UPPER HALL - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY
text: Rocklin comes down the hall carrying his saddle and looking
text: at the room numbers. As he nears the f.g. he locates the
text: room he is looking for (it is a room facing toward the rear
text: of the Sun-Up). He knocks. Almost immediately the door opens
text: and Clara stands there -- flushed and embarrassed.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Oh, Mr. Rocklin --
scene_heading: INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY
text: This is the room in which Clara has arranged to meet Rocklin,
text: who later takes it as his own.
text: SHOT at door as Rocklin steps into the room.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: I'm so glad I've found you -- I was
dialog: on my way to the Santee and learned
dialog: you were in town.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (putting his saddle,
dialog: etc., aside)
dialog: Just got in.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: I feel perfectly awful, running after
dialog: you like this, but --
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: You got trouble, eh?
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: My aunt found out I wrote you and
dialog: made a terrible scene --
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: You haven't signed everything over
dialog: to that Garvey, have you?
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: No -- and because I refused, Auntie
dialog: said she would sign an affidavit
dialog: that I'm still underage, and then,
dialog: as my guardian she can do what she
dialog: likes.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Got anything to prove you're not
dialog: underage?
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (after a slight pause)
dialog: No -- but Mr. Garvey has a letter
dialog: that would prove it. My aunt wrote
dialog: it before we came out here.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: S'pose we could get it?
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: He'd never give it to me.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (starts for door)
dialog: Wait here.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (with a slight start
dialog: toward Rocklin)
dialog: Oh, please -- you --
dialog: (she hesitates, not
dialog: quite sure what to
dialog: say)
dialog: You won't go getting yourself in
dialog: trouble -- I -- I'd rather give up
dialog: everything -- I mean --
text: Rocklin notes her confusion. He regards her with a slight
text: sympathetic smile. Then opens the door and exits.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE OUT
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE IN
scene_heading: INT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: CLOSE SHOT -- a letter written in a bold feminine hand. It
dialog: reads:
scene_heading: DEAR MR. GARVEY:
dialog: In answer to your letter of the 25th, kindly be advised that
dialog: my niece, Clara Caldwell, became of age January 11th of this
dialog: year. And, although I am no longer her legal guardian, it
dialog: behooves me, as her nearest kin, to show continued interest
dialog: in her affairs --
text: The CAMERA HOLDS LONG ENOUGH for the letter to be read. And
text: now the letter begins to be consumed in a flame as the CAMERA
text: PULLS BACK showing the burning letter in Judge Garvey's hand.
text: He is standing over the potbellied stove in his office, and
text: Miss Martin is close to him watching the letter burn. Garvey
text: finally lets it fall from his fingers onto the top of the
text: stove. He lifts the lid, lets the remains fall inside, and
text: smiles to Miss Martin.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: That takes care of that --
dialog: (crosses to his desk)
dialog: Now, I'll draw up an affidavit right
dialog: away and everything will be taken
dialog: care of as we want it.
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: (not too enthusiastic)
dialog: I certainly hope so -- it's not myself
dialog: I'm concerned about --
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: (getting out the papers)
dialog: -- Of course not.
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: I can't say I'm very happy about
dialog: doing this -- I only hope it works
dialog: out for the best.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: It's the better choice of two evils --
dialog: now let's see --
dialog: (begins to write)
dialog: I, Elizabeth --
dialog: (looks at Miss Martin)
dialog: It is Elizabeth, isn't it?
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: Yes --
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: -- Elizabeth Martin, of Danvers,
dialog: Massachusetts, do hereby --
text: The door opens and Rocklin enters. Miss Martin, who has been
text: pacing nervously, stops in her tracks. Garvey, taken
text: completely by surprise, feigns an affected casualness. Rocklin
text: eyes them both suspiciously as he slowly closes the door.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
text: (leaning back in his
dialog: chair)
dialog: Well, Mr. Rocklin, this is indeed a
dialog: surprise. Didn't expect to see you
dialog: so soon. I understood you were riding
dialog: for the Santee.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (coldly)
dialog: That's right.
text: It is quite obvious to Garvey that Rocklin is here on
text: business. He turns to Miss Martin.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: (to Miss Martin)
dialog: Perhaps you'd better come back later --
text: Miss Martin is in accord with that suggestion, and after
text: giving Rocklin the frigid eye, flounces out, slamming the
dialog: door.
text: Garvey shakes his head, wipes his brow, and is returning to
dialog: his desk.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: SHOT -- door to Garvey's office. Miss Martin has her ear
text: glued to the panels. Over scene comes Rocklin's voice.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN'S VOICE
dialog: I came for that letter.
text: Miss Martin reacts.
scene_heading: INT. OF GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: SHOT -- Garvey and Rocklin.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: Did you say letter?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: That's right -- the one Miss
dialog: Caldwell's aunt wrote from out east
dialog: sayin' she was of age. Remember?
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: No -- I'm afraid I don't.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: SHOT -- door. Miss Martin reacts with nod of satisfaction
text: and leaves.
scene_heading: INT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Rocklin goes to the filing cabinet where he opens the drawer
text: marked "C." As he fingers through the papers, Garvey sits
text: back in his chair, watching.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: What is your interest in this letter?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: My only interest is getting' it.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: You realize what this is, don't you? --
text: Robbing -- armed robbery at that.
text: Rocklin pulls open the "M" drawer.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: I warn you, you're in for a
dialog: disappointment.
text: Not finding the letter in the "M" drawer, Rocklin goes to
text: the desk and pulls the handle of one of the drawers. It is
dialog: locked.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Open up.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: (has had about enough)
dialog: Listens, you --
dialog: (suddenly controls
dialog: himself)
dialog: There's nothing in there that'd
dialog: interest you.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (grimly)
dialog: I'd like to make up my own mind about
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: (forces a chuckle)
dialog: All right -- I'll open it -- just to
dialog: convince you I'm not hiding any
dialog: letter.
text: Garvey unlocks the drawer and opens it. It is found to contain
text: nothing but two brand new decks of playing cards.
text: The UNOPENED DECKS OF CARDS.
text: BACK TO SCENE. Garvey seems a little too anxious to close
text: the drawer, and before he can do so, Rocklin has one hand
text: inside. Garvey, checked for a second, looks up at Rocklin.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: What's the idea?
text: Rocklin slowly withdraws his hand, holding one of the decks.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: These cards --
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: (attempting to bluff
dialog: it out)
dialog: Anything wrong in a man having cards
dialog: in his possession?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Depends on what kind they are --
dialog: 'specially when they're under lock
dialog: and key.
text: The two regard each other silently a moment. Now Rocklin
text: casually slips the deck he holds into his pocket.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: (too politely)
dialog: You're taking those, I presume.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: That's right.
text: He takes a step away. Garvey turns him by touching his arm.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: (has had almost enough)
dialog: Now, you look here --
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (soberly)
dialog: You're the one who better start
dialog: lookin' -- lookin' for a way out for
dialog: killin' Red Caldwell.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: (blanches)
dialog: Caldwell --
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (takes up one of the
dialog: decks of cards)
dialog: He found out about these -- and you
dialog: went and killed him.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: (with an affected
dialog: smile and unnatural
dialog: calmness)
dialog: And you believe a story like that?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: I will until I hear a better one.
dialog: (puts deck he holds,
dialog: in his pocket)
dialog: I'll just take this along -- the
dialog: district judge at Garden City should
dialog: be mighty interested.
text: He starts around the desk toward the door. From the corner
text: of his eye he catches Garvey reaching for a gun in the middle
text: drawer. Before he can raise it, Rocklin is on him with a
text: blow that sends Garvey reeling back toward the stove.
text: Rocklin starts for the door again, and just misses being
text: struck by a chair which Garvey hurls with vicious fury. The
text: chair crashes against a window.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: The sound of breaking glass attracts the attention of passers-
text: by, as well as Miss Martin seated in her surrey with Sammy,
dialog: the K.C. China-boy.
scene_heading: INT. OF GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: The two are now fighting in earnest.
speaker_heading: VARIOUS FLASHES
text: of the fight, intercut with townspeople gathering outside.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Dave pulls up in his wagon.
scene_heading: INT. OF GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: It is pretty well wrecked. Rocklin has Garvey just about
text: done in. He gives him one final Sunday punch and Garvey goes
text: down and stays down. At that moment, Dave and Pap Fossler
text: enter followed by other curious natives.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Say -- looks like you two been
dialog: disagreein' 'bout somethin' --
dialog: (to Fossler, who has
dialog: gone over to Garvey)
dialog: He ain't daid, is he?
speaker_heading: PAP FOSSLER
dialog: Not permanently, I don't reckon. --
dialog: What happened, anyways?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (to Rocklin)
dialog: You musta found out somethin'.
speaker_heading: PAP FOSSLER
dialog: (with a wink to Dave)
dialog: I reckon the Judge did, too.
text: They exit, and almost immediately Miss Martin enters, and
text: after gaping in horror at the appearance of the place, sees
text: the Judge, who, having regained consciousness, bestirs himself
text: on the floor.
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: Oh, dear -- dear -- are you hurt?
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: (getting up painfully)
dialog: Get out of my way --
text: Garvey, on his feet now, makes for the door leading to his
text: living quarters at the back of the office. Miss Martin follows
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: (haughtily)
dialog: Now don't you use that tone of voice
dialog: to me --
dialog: (going through doorway)
dialog: I'll have you understand I --
text: She sees the bed and shrieks upon realizing where she is,
text: and backs out quickly, almost catching the door which Garvey
text: slams in her face.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY
text: Rocklin and Dave as they walk from Garvey's office. Dave has
text: a time hopping along against Rocklin's strides.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: -- Find out who owns that tobaccy
dialog: pouch yet?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (staring straight
dialog: ahead)
dialog: No -- but get hold of Clint Harolday.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Clint -- Is he in on it?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Can't say for sure -- Bring him to
dialog: the Sun-Up, and don't take no for an
dialog: answer.
text: Dave leaves and exits from shot in the direction of the stage
text: office. Rocklin goes off toward the Sun-Up.
scene_heading: EXT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY
text: PANNING SHOT. Juan is lounging against the corner of the
text: building, soberly watching Rocklin's approach. As Rocklin
text: comes into the scene he spots Juan, and stops a moment as
text: though deciding whether or not to question him. During this,
text: Juan casually takes his ornamental tobacco pouch from his
text: pocket and begins to roll a cigarette.
text: The CAMERA PANS Rocklin to the side of the building and up
text: the outer stairs.
scene_heading: INT. UPPER HALL - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY
text: Rocklin comes through the door and down the hall. He reaches
text: his room, and is about to open the door when he hears a
text: familiar voice inside. He listens.
speaker_heading: ARLY'S VOICE
dialog: -- So now you know the truth. And if
dialog: you think you can steal him away
dialog: from me, you're welcome to try it.
text: Rocklin frowns and enters.
scene_heading: INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY
text: Rocklin steps into the room, holding the door partly open as
text: he focuses his attention on Arly. Clara, who has been sitting
text: in the rocker near the window, gets up and is the first to
dialog: speak.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (anxiously)
dialog: Did you get it?
text: Rocklin closes the door.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: No -- but I don't think it's gonna
dialog: matter much -- you go on back to the
dialog: K.C. and I'll be out in the mornin'
dialog: and take you with me to Garden City
dialog: to see the district judge.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: But I hate putting you to that
dialog: trouble.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: No trouble at all -- I'm going anyway.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (casually)
dialog: You look like you've been fighting.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (soberly)
dialog: What are you doin' here?
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: I was just telling Miss Caldwell
dialog: about -- well -- you and me.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (his eyes narrowing)
dialog: What about, you an' me?
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (sensing the static
dialog: in the atmosphere)
dialog: I think I'd better be going...
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (turning quickly from
dialog: Arly)
dialog: Just a minute --
dialog: (glances at Arly)
dialog: What all has she been tellin' you?
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: Oh -- oh, really I'd rather not --
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Go ahead, tell him --
text: (looks at Rocklin and
text: goes on defiantly)
dialog: -- and I dare him to deny it.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Deny what?
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: That she was with you last night at
text: the cabin in the mountains.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Well -- why should I deny it?...
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: And didn't you make love to me?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (this is getting a
dialog: bit thick for him)
dialog: Make love to you --
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (forcing her point)
dialog: You didn't kiss me -- I suppose?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Did you expect me to deny that, too?
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (smiles at Clara)
dialog: You see?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (to Clara)
dialog: Now, maybe you ought to hear what
dialog: I've got to say --
text: Clara is terribly hurt, but struggles to be grown-up about
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Please -- you needn't explain. After
dialog: all, it really isn't any of my
dialog: business, is it?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (in the pause he looks
dialog: at Arly)
dialog: You little --
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: That's it -- start swearin'--
dialog: (to Clara)
dialog: Just like a man.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: If there wasn't a lady here, I'd do
dialog: more to you than swear.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: I don't know how I can ever thank
dialog: you for trying to help me. I do
dialog: appreciate it ever so much --
dialog: (to Arly)
dialog: Don't think too harshly of me, will
dialog: you -- I --
text: Clara can say no more without breaking. So she turns away
text: quickly and hurries out the door. Rocklin does a slow burn
text: as he glares at Arly.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (sincerely -- after a
dialog: pause)
dialog: She's lovely, isn't she? -- So sweet --
dialog: honest, and helpless.
text: Rocklin makes no reply.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: Pity you didn't fall in love with
dialog: her, instead of me.
text: Arly is being ridiculous now. He ignores her remarks and
text: concentrates his attention on one of his hands -- he may
text: have sprained it slightly in the fight.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: You might's well know right now that
dialog: you or no woman is ever goin' to get
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: Don't be so sure -- I don't think
dialog: I'm doin' so badly.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Don't you?
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: Don't you know?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: I know there ain't a dirty trick you
dialog: wouldn't play to get what you want.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: I always get what I want.
text: She takes a folded piece of paper out of her pocket and drops
text: it on the dresser as Rocklin watches her.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: -- See?
dialog: (opens the door)
dialog: -- 'Bye now --
text: The door closes. Rocklin stands a moment. Now curiosity brings
text: him to the dresser where he takes up the paper and unfolds
dialog: it.
text: CLARA'S LETTER. The torn pieces have all been sorted and
text: pasted together on a sheet of paper
text: BACK TO SCENE. Rocklin holds the letter. He is mad. He shakes
text: his head -- What a gal --- Now he is almost smiling -- almost.
text: He folds the letter -- puts it in his pocket. Takes off his
text: gun-belt and hangs it over the rocker near the window, and
text: stretches out on the bed, as we

scene_heading: INT. CLARA'S ROOM - CALDWELL HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: The door flies open. Clara bursts in, closing the door in
text: the same movement. Her eyes swing to someone o.s. and she
text: freezes to the spot.
speaker_heading: ON
text: Miss Martin, standing by the window, cold and threatening.
text: She has not taken the time to remove her hat. After a moment's
text: pause, she moves slowly toward Clara.
text: The CAMERA PANS WITH her into a TWO SHOT. Clara, her back
text: pressing harder and harder against the door, becomes more
text: terrified at the other's approach. Miss Martin appraises the
text: girl a short moment and now suddenly slaps her hard across
text: the face. Clara opens her mouth, about to scream, but even
text: stifles this impulse under the cold stare of her aunt.
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: (quietly but viciously)
dialog: Whatever is to become of you?
text: Clara can only stare as one under an hypnotic spell.
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: Have you no sense of pride, or
dialog: decency? Throwing yourself at that --
dialog: that wretch, like any shameless hussy.
text: Clara hasn't moved.
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: I thought we'd done with him -- but
dialog: no -- you have to run to him and
dialog: tell him all our business --
text: Clara merely gasps for a breath of air, but Miss Martin,
text: thinking her about to speak, goes on, more forcefully now.
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: Don't you dare deny it -- you know
dialog: very well you told him about that
dialog: letter I wrote Mr. Garvey.
text: Clara remains silent.
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: Didn't you? --
text: Clara, now utterly broken, moves away. Miss Martin, her eyes
text: still rivited on the girl, follows.
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: Didn't you?
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: INT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: The office has been more or less cleaned up since the fight.
text: Garvey is discovered near the window. He has cleaned himself
text: up but bears some evidence of the fight. He is reading a
text: letter as Sammy, the K.C. China-boy, stands waiting near the
dialog: door.
text: LETTER. The message is written in the same bold hand of Miss
dialog: Martin already seen in the previous letter:
dialog: Mr. Garvey,
dialog: I have just learned that despicable Rocklin person intends
dialog: to take Clara to Garden City in the morning -- evidently to
dialog: have you investigated. I thought you had better know about
dialog: it.
dialog: E.M.
text: BACK TO SCENE. Garvey puts the message in his pocket as he
text: addresses Sammy.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: Tell Miss Martin that I'll take care
dialog: of everything.
speaker_heading: SAMMY

scene_heading: INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: On Rocklin, stretched across the bed, examining the cards in
text: the light of a lamp.
scene_heading: EXT. REAR OF SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT
text: Garvey comes from around the building's corner and peers
text: furtively through the darkness toward the lighted windows of
text: Rocklin's room.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - NIGHT
text: The area in front of the Sun-Up. Dave's wagon pulls up to
text: the hitching rail in front of the saloon. Clint, stripped of
text: his gun, is driving with Dave, alertly watching him. They
text: get down from the wagon and Dave prods Clint toward the corner
text: of the building.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE OF SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT
text: Garvey has left the spot where we saw him look up to Rocklin's
text: window. We now see him as he rounds a rear corner of the
text: building and goes toward the outer stairs leading to the Sun-
text: Up's second floor. He starts up the steps and stops almost
text: immediately and stares o.s.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
text: From Garvey's ANGLE as he sees Dave bringing Clint from around
text: in front of the building toward the stairway.
speaker_heading: CAMERA HOLDS
text: Garvey steps quickly to the ground and takes up a position
text: around the roar corner. He watches the two men approach the
text: stairway and go up. He moves out of the shot now, going toward
text: the street. The CAMERA HOLDS on the corner, and we see Tala
text: come into view, as though from nowhere, and take the exact
text: position at the building's corner vacated by Garvey only a
text: moment before. It is apparent that he is watching Garvey,
text: and after a momentary pause he too moves stealthily out of
dialog: the scene.
scene_heading: INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT
text: PANNING SHOT on Rocklin asleep. He is fully dressed, as we
text: last saw him, with the exception of his boots. He is stretched
text: full length on top of the covers. His gun-belt still hangs
text: over the rocker, close to the open window. A knock on the
text: door brings him to a sitting position.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Come in --
text: CAMERA PANS TO door as Clint enters reluctantly, followed by
text: the triumphant Dave.
speaker_heading: DAVE
text: Here he is, Rock. Caught him jist in
text: time near the Santee. Headed fer
dialog: out, I'd say.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Sit down, Clint.
dialog: (to Dave, as he reaches
dialog: into his pocket)
dialog: How about goin' down below an' havin'
dialog: one on me?
text: He tosses Dave a coin, who catches it. Then Rocklin puts on
text: his boots.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (delighted)
dialog: Well, now -- that's right thoughtful --
dialog: Holler if you need me.
text: Dave exits.
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: (belligerently, as he
dialog: stands near the window)
dialog: What's this all about?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
text: (calmly, as he stands
dialog: up)
dialog: It ain't gonna do you any good to
dialog: get all het up and tough, kid --
text: Rocklin begins rolling a cigarette as he moves toward Clint.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: I just want to ask you a few questions --
dialog: that's all.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE OF SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT
text: An unidentifiable form is seen moving through the darkness
text: toward the outer stairway. As it nears the stairway, the
text: CAMERA MOVES IN so that as the mysterious figure begins
text: stealthily up the stairs, we see only the feet through the
dialog: rungs.
text: The CAMERA THEN PANS QUICKLY AND ZOOMS INTO A CLOSE SHOT of
text: Juan, across the alley. And now through Juan's eyes we watch
text: the ascent of the mysterious intruder: The Mexican's line of
text: vision gradually raises, then the eyes slowly move across
text: the camera as the dark figure proceeds along to the rear
text: portion of the verandah.
scene_heading: INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT
text: Rocklin finishes rolling his cigarette and lights it.
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: I told you once, I don't know who
dialog: owns that pouch-- and I don't know
dialog: who shot you.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: Forget it -- that's not what I want
dialog: to talk to you about, anyway.
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: (harshly)
dialog: Well, what do you want to talk about?
dialog: Come on, get it over with.
scene_heading: EXT. VERANDAH - REAR OF SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT
text: The mysterious form has moved past the darkened windows along
text: the verandah and is nearing Rocklin's lighted room -- stops
text: close to the open window.
scene_heading: INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT
dialog: SHOT -- Rocklin and Clint.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Clint -- I want you to tell me why
dialog: Garvey murdered Red Caldwell --
text: Clint tenses -- stares -- finds breathing difficult.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: You know -- don't you?
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: (shaking)
dialog: Me? No!
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Oh yes you do.
dialog: (advancing on him)
dialog: And you're going to tell me all about
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: I don't know nothing, I tell you --
dialog: I --
text: Rocklin slaps Clint's face open-handed, throwing him off
text: balance, then grabs him by the shirt front.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Talk!
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: I tell ya, I...
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (hitting him again)
dialog: Talk!
text: Completely terrified, Clint opens his mouth as if about to
text: speak. Suddenly he sees something out of the shot over
text: Rocklin's shoulder and his expression changes. Rocklin looks
text: quickly in the same direction.
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: window. A gloved hand has come out of the dark and is reaching
text: through the window for Rocklin's gun in the belt which is
text: hanging over the chair.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: Clint and Rocklin. The latter is still looking toward the
text: window. With a swift movement Clint picks up the water jug
text: from the washstand and brings it down on Rocklin's head. As
text: Rocklin falls out of shot, Clint turns to the window with a
text: triumphant smile. Suddenly his expression changes.
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: (in a hoarse scream)
dialog: No! No, don't!
text: There is a shot from o.s. and Clint's hands go to his stomach.
text: With a gasp of pain he doubles up and collapses on the floor.
speaker_heading: SHOT
text: window. The hand of the killer pitches the gun toward Rocklin
text: and disappears.
scene_heading: INT. BAR - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT
text: Lined up at the bar are Dave, Pap Fossler, Shorty Davis and
text: a few others. Cap is in his usual place. At the poker table
text: are Doc Riding, Sam Haynes, Ab Jenkins and one or two others.
text: The shot has evidently been heard, for everything seems to
text: have stopped, and Dave and Pap Fussier are looking up toward
text: the ceiling, as are others. Now Dave snaps back to life --
text: gulps down his drink, and hurries toward the stairs. As he
text: starts up, the others move slowly in the same direction.
scene_heading: INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT
text: Rocklin is on the floor, groggy. He shakes his head, and as
text: his senses return, he picks up the gun and just gets to his
text: feet as Dave rushes in.
text: Dave sees Clint's body on the floor -- notices the gun in
text: Rocklin's hand. He opens his mouth to speak but nothing comes
text: out. All he can do is stare and grimace. The sound of hurrying
text: feet comes from the hall, and presently the mob closes in,
text: crowding the room and the hall.
text: Pap Fossler, who has been one of the first to enter, kneels
text: over Clint.
text: During this, there are general ad libs from the crowd.
speaker_heading: AD LIBS
dialog: What happened? Who is it? Clint
dialog: Harolday -- Etc.
speaker_heading: PAP FOSSLER
dialog: Where's Doc Riding?
speaker_heading: AD LIBS
dialog: Get the Doc. Hey, Doc -- He was down
text: below. Here he is.
text: Doc's voice is heard from the hall as he makes his way through
dialog: the jam.
speaker_heading: DOC RIDING'S VOICE
dialog: Here I am --
speaker_heading: AD LIBS
dialog: Look out, men -- Let the Doc through.
dialog: Etc.
text: Doc riding comes through the crowd, kneels beside Pap Fossler.
text: He needs only a glance to know he can be of no use.
speaker_heading: DOC RIDING
dialog: (breaking the silence)
dialog: Somebody better fetch Harolday.
speaker_heading: CAP
text: Shorty's already gone for him.
speaker_heading: PAP FOSSLER
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: Better get Arly, too.
text: A voice is heard from the hall.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: She was at the hotel a while ago.
speaker_heading: PAP FOSSLER
dialog: (looking down at Clint
dialog: and shaking his head)
dialog: He was only a kid.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: Rocklin, still holding his gun as he stares down at Clint's
text: body o.s. Now he studies the faces of the mob.
speaker_heading: PANNING SHOT
text: of the crowd. There is nothing but a sea of hostile faces.
speaker_heading: JACKSON'S VOICE
dialog: What's goin' on here -- gang way --
text: The crowd parts to admit Jackson, who comes stalking in
text: followed by Judge Garvey.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: What's the trouble here --
text: He stops abruptly as he sees Clint's body. Now he levels his
text: eyes on Rocklin.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: (with a bitter smile)
dialog: I warned you, didn't I? -- Well, I
dialog: guess this is the last trouble you'll
dialog: ever make in this town.
dialog: (extending his hand)
text: Hand over that gun.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Just a minute, now --
text: He steps back so no one is behind him. And there is something
text: about his manner and tone that urges Jackson to use
dialog: discretion.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (to the crowd,
dialog: generally)
dialog: I know it looks bad -- but I didn't
dialog: kill the kid.
text: The crowd stares in skeptical silence. Even Dave thinks
text: Rocklin is lying, and now does his best to protect his friend.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I believe you.
dialog: (to the others)
text: His gun was layin' over there on the
dialog: floor when I come in and --
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (cutting in)
dialog: No it wasn't -- It was right in my
text: hand -- like it is now.
text: Dave winces.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: If you didn't know him -- then who
dialog: did?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: I don't know --
dialog: (looks at garvey)
dialog: But I'm going to find out.
scene_heading: INT. UPPER HALL - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT
text: Harolday, followed by Shorty Davis, is making his way down
text: the hall from the inner stair landing. As he nears the crowd
text: gathered at Rocklin's door, Juan comes into view down the
text: hall, having just entered through the door leading out onto
text: the verandah.
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
text: (as he nears Rocklin's
dialog: door)
dialog: Where is he? -- Where's my boy?
scene_heading: INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT
text: Harolday enters, over the ad libs of the mob, followed by
text: Shorty Davis. During the following action, Juan enters and
text: stands near the door, silently taking in everything.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: Harolday, as he sees Clint's body and stops dead in horror.
text: He turns to Rocklin.
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: (with cold violence)
dialog: You murderer.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: I didn't do it, Mr. Harolday.
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Then who did?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (from crowd)
dialog: He had a gun in his hand when we
dialog: come in.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: (smoothly)
dialog: And I'll bet it's the same one the
dialog: bullet that killed Clint came out
dialog: of.
text: Rocklin gives Garvey a hard, slow look.
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: Well, what do you say to that?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: He's right.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: You admit it.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Yeah -- but that still don't say I
dialog: killed him.
speaker_heading: AD LIBS
dialog: Aw, take him away -- Liar -- Lock
text: him up, Sheriff -- The yellow-bellied --
dialog: Etc.
text: ON ARLY AS SHE PUSHES HER WAY THROUGH THE CROWD
text: She stares down at Clint. An expression of pity comes over
text: her. Now she looks coldly at Rocklin.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Why did you do it?
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
dialog: with Rocklin in f.g.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: I didn't.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
text: He admits it was his gun that shot
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (whose eyes haven't
dialog: left Rocklin's)
dialog: But you didn't fire it.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (slowly)
dialog: Clint and me was having a bit of an
dialog: argument.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: What about?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (searching for words)
dialog: About whether he was going to help
dialog: clear up a few things that's been
dialog: bothering me and some others 'round
dialog: these parts.
dialog: (looking at Garvey)
dialog: For instance -- who it was shot Red
dialog: Caldwell.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Caldwell!
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (still at Garvey)
dialog: And the K.C. foreman. And who took
dialog: that shot at me up at Table-Top last
dialog: night. And why certain people are so
dialog: anxious to get rid of the Caldwell
dialog: girl.
speaker_heading: PAP FOSSLER
dialog: How would Clint know about all that?
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: (harshly)
text: He's lying. He's trying to cover up
dialog: for killing my boy.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: (encouraged by the
dialog: support)
dialog: Quit stalling, Rocklin.
text: He makes a tentative movement toward Rocklin but Arly
dialog: intervenes.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: Wait a minute -- he's get a right to
dialog: be heard.
dialog: (to Rocklin)
dialog: Well, we're listenin'.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Well -- Clint was getting' all set
dialog: to talk, when -- somebody snuck up
text: along the verandah there and pulled
dialog: the gun out o' my belt...
dialog: (indicating the belt
dialog: on chair)
dialog: ... and let him have it.
text: There is a moment's amazed silence. Then the crowd breaks
dialog: into derisive comment.
speaker_heading: AD LIBS
dialog: What a story! What an alibi! String
dialog: him up, the heel! Etc.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: You'll have to think up something
dialog: better than that Rocklin.
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
dialog: with Garvey in f.g.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: (smoothly)
dialog: Don't be a fool, Rocklin. You know
dialog: you can't get away with a yarn like
dialog: that. Why don't you save yourself
dialog: and everyone else a lot of trouble
dialog: by surrendering to the Sheriff? After
dialog: all, it isn't such a crime in these
text: parts to kill a man in self-defense.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Self-defense?
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: Everyone knows what Clint was like.
text: He probably lost his head and pulled
dialog: a gun on you, like he did at the Sun-
dialog: Up that night. Wasn't that it?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (grimly; after a little
dialog: pause)
dialog: No, that wasn't it. And till I do
dialog: what I got to do, I ain't surrenderin'
dialog: to anybody -- least of all to your
dialog: pal here.
dialog: (indicates sheriff)
dialog: If I got to be shot for knowing too
dialog: much, it ain't going to be in the
text: back, in a framed-up jail-break.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: Arly, who has been staring at Rocklin in frowning
text: bewilderment.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: But if someone's trying to kill you,
dialog: why didn't they do it just now? Why
dialog: did they have to kill Clint?
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
dialog: Rocklin.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Guess they wanted to get Clint, too.
dialog: Doin' it this way they get us both.
dialog: Clint first -- an' me afterwards --
dialog: like I jus' said.
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: with Garvey in f.g. Close beside him are Pap and Dave, who
text: watches Garvey closely.
speaker_heading: PAP FOSSLER
dialog: Quit fancy talk. Who's "they?"
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: I might be able to tell you that
dialog: later.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: No you won't -- because you're comin'
dialog: with me.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (raises his gun)
dialog: Am I?
text: The crowd tenses. Rocklin eyes them grimly.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
text: The first one that moves -- gets it.
text: He moves over to the open window, and with his gun leveled
text: on the mob, steps out onto the verandah. Once outside, he
text: suddenly lets the window fall and disappears. A shot from
text: Jackson's gun shatters a pane, during which time there has
text: been a rush to the window. It is Arly and Dave who reach it
text: first, and feigning an attempt to raise the window, they
text: momentarily delay pursuit.
text: AT THE DOOR LEADING FROM THE ROOM
text: There is the inevitable jam as the pushing, yelling crowd
text: all try to exit at once.
scene_heading: EXT. REAR OF SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT
text: Rocklin, as he picks himself off the ground, having dropped
text: from the verandah. He starts quickly away.
scene_heading: EXT. WINDOW OF ROCKLIN'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: SHOOTING INTO the room, we see Arly and Dave shoved to one
text: side by Jackson and Garvey. The window goes up and Jackson
text: steps out, followed by Garvey, Harolday, Arly, Dave, and
dialog: others.
scene_heading: INT. UPPER HALL - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT
text: The human jam has been broken, and now the mob dashes wildly
text: toward the stairway, and verandah exit in the b.g.
scene_heading: EXT. SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT
text: The hitching rail in front of the Sun-Up. There are a dozen
text: or so horses tied up to it and close to it is Dave's team
text: and wagon. Rocklin comes from around the corner of the
text: building and races to the hitching rail.
scene_heading: TOP OF OUTSIDE STAIRS
text: Jackson and Garvey come from around the corner of the porch
text: followed by Harolday, Arly, Dave, and others. At the stairs
text: they collide with some of the men who have raced down the
text: hall, only to reach the stairway at the same moment. There
text: is another jam on the landing as the mob all try to get down
dialog: at once.
text: ROCKLIN AT THE HITCHING RAIL
text: He has cut the lines of the horses tied to the rail. We see
text: him cutting the last line and fire into the air. The horses
dialog: rare and stampede.
scene_heading: THE MOB - WITH JACKSON AND GARVEY LEADING - COME FROM AROUND
speaker_heading: THE BUILDING
text: And now there is a state of utter confusion as the mob and

text: their mounts. Rocklin is no where in evidence.
scene_heading: GARVEY AND JACKSON - AS HAROLDAY JOINS THEM NEAR DAVE'S WAGON
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: Well, Sheriff -- you certainly are
dialog: to be congratulated.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: (harassed)
dialog: Look, Mr. Harolday -- you saw what
dialog: happened --
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: (deeply concerned)
dialog: Never mind that -- Let's get going
dialog: for Garden City -- that's where he's
text: headed for.
speaker_heading: HAROLDAY
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: I'm positive.
text: Dave climbs into his wagon behind the group as Jackson exits
dialog: quickly.
scene_heading: EXT. STAGE OFFICE - SANTA INEZ - NIGHT
text: At hitching rail. There are four or five horses tied up here.
text: Arly and Juan enter and mount their horses, and almost
text: immediately Garvey and Harolday come hurrying into the scene
text: after two of the other horses.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (shouts from her horse)
dialog: Where do you think he's gone?
text: Before either of the two men can answer, Jackson's voice is
dialog: heard shouting o.s.
speaker_heading: JACKSON'S VOICE
dialog: All right, men -- follow me --
text: The CAMERA PANS AROUND, getting Jackson, now mounted, as
text: others come riding in. He rares his horse around and starts
dialog: away followed by the mob, including our principals. They do

scene_heading: EXT. ROAD NEAR EDGE OF SANTA INEZ - NIGHT

speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE

text: ON ROCKLIN - AS HIS HEAD COMES FROM BETWEEN THE FLAPS
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Dave, smiling broadly. Rocklin
text: is pulling hard on the reins.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I mighta knowed you'd do somethin'

speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: (impatiently)
dialog: Now -- what is it?
text: Sammy points o.s. -- Miss Martin looks and freezes.
text: As she moves down the hall, the CAMERA PANS WITH her until

text: Now the CAMERA MOVES IN TO A THREE SHOT and we recognize

speaker_heading: ARLY

scene_heading: MISS MARTIN'S VOICE

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: -- And you knew the truth all the
dialog: time, too -- didn't you? -- No wonder
dialog: you stuck around --
text: From Rocklin's expression it is quite apparent to Dave that
dialog: he is right.
scene_heading: CLARA AND MISS MARTIN

speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: You're not Clint's killer, by any
dialog: chance --
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (cutting in)
dialog: By one bad chance --
dialog: (glares at Harolday)
dialog: Juan saw you do it.
text: Harolday looks at Juan, who slowly nods.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Well, now we're gettin' some place --
text: He brings up the tobacco pouch. But before he can ask about
text: it, Arly speaks.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: That pouch is his --
dialog: (indicates Harolday)
dialog: Juan made it for him a long time
dialog: ago.
dialog: (to Juan)
dialog: Didn't you?
text: Juan nods.
text: Rocklin, with a sudden transition, speaks to Harolday in a
text: hard, threatening tone.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (to Harolday)
dialog: Why did you kill Caldwell?
text: Harolday doesn't answer. He finally looks at Garvey in
text: desperation. Perspiration runs down Garvey's forehead.
text: Suddenly Harolday makes a mad dash for the door. Rocklin
text: shoots, but Arly pushes his arm and sends the shot wild.
text: Rocklin looks at her in amazement. Julio hurries out.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT OF CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN
text: On Harolday as he rushes madly across the clearing toward
text: the bushes where his horse waits.
text: The CAMERA SWINGS BACK to the porch in time to catch Julio
text: crossing it in pursuit of Harolday. Arly and Rocklin come
text: through the open door and stand on the porch watching.
text: THE BUSHES WHERE HAROLDAY'S HORSE IS HIDDEN - ARLY AND
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN'S ANGLE
text: They see Julio disappear in the brush. For a moment nothing
text: happens; now Harolday's horse bolts out, riderless, and
text: gallops away. Now Julio comes slowly into view. He moves
text: slowly and deliberately back toward the house.
speaker_heading: AT PORCH
text: Julio comes in to Rocklin and Arly. The three exchange
dialog: significant glances as we
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: INT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN
text: In the hall are Clara and Miss Martin, Rocklin, Arly and
text: Julio, Dave and Garvey. Garvey is seated and has evidently
text: been talking in the way of confession.
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: -- Harolday wanted the K.C. like he
dialog: wanted the Santee and the Hardman
dialog: place, for his land scheme -- He
dialog: planned on breaking up the ranches
dialog: into small holdings and selling to
dialog: dirt farmers. He pretended to be on
dialog: the outs with me so I could get
dialog: Caldwell's confidence. And when Red
dialog: caught me with the crooked cards and
dialog: threatened to expose me -- Harolday
dialog: shot him.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Why did he kill Clint? An' not me?
speaker_heading: GARVEY
dialog: That shot was an accident -- it was
dialog: meant for you. We planned on getting
dialog: the women to let me handle their
dialog: business --
speaker_heading: MISS MARTIN
dialog: (interrupting, furious)
dialog: -- And do us out of everything --
dialog: (moves close to Garvey)
dialog: You vile -- wicked -- despicable --
text: She is beside herself in her anger -- and taking up a large
text: vase sitting nearby, she smashes it to pieces over Garvey's
text: head. Garvey goes down unconscious. Miss Martin rushes to
text: her room screaming. Clara follows her.
scene_heading: ON DAVE GRINNING BROADLY - ROCKLIN COMES TO HIM
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: When he wakes up -- we'll have him
dialog: put everything on paper.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Well, you'll have to do the writin' --
dialog: 'cause I don't know how to write.
text: CLARA HURRIES BACK TO THE GROUP FROM UP THE HALL
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (genuinely concerned)
dialog: Oh, Mr. Rocklin -- please -- I think
text: Auntie is out of her mind -- she's
text: in her room -- laughing.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (grimaces)
dialog: What that ole pelican needs is a
dialog: good spankin'.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (who has been silently
dialog: listening)
dialog: And I'll bet you're just the one who
dialog: can do it.
speaker_heading: DAVE
text: (his eyes flash with
dialog: an idea)
dialog: Yeah -- I believe I am.
dialog: (looks at the group)
dialog: I know I am.
text: He starts away down the hall, rolling up his sleeves.
text: Rocklin's eyes wander to Clara, who seems quite at a loss.
text: Now he moves slowly toward her. In the b.g. Arly watches
text: Rocklin's every move.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: I guess there's no rush for you to
dialog: get to Garden City, now --
text: After a slight pause in which she becomes conscious of Arly,
text: Clara speaks.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: No -- I don't suppose there's any --
dialog: rush --
text: There is another short pause. Rocklin glances at Arly, and
text: Arly assuming they want to be alone, turns and goes out the
text: door, leaving Julio attending Garvey.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (after Arly goes)
dialog: If I was like her, I'd stay in the
dialog: West.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: That means you're goin' back East --
dialog: Cousin Clara?
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (smiles, nods)
dialog: It's where I belong -- I know that
dialog: now --
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: It's good to know where you Belong,
dialog: I reckon -- Wish I knew.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (wistfully)
dialog: I can tell you -- you belong with
dialog: her --
text: Rocklin takes it -- a faint smile brushes his face. He turns
text: now and walks out.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE OUT
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE IN
scene_heading: EXT. GROUNDS NEAR CALDWELL HOUSE - SUN-UP
text: Arly is seated on the shaft of an old wagon. The first rays
text: of the morning sun streak through the trees across her as
text: she smiles wistfully down at the antics of a little woodchuck
text: cavorting on the ground close to her. In a moment Rocklin
text: comes into view in the b.g. He spots Arly, who has her back
text: to him, and walks over. His approach frightens the woodchuck
text: away, and turns Arly's head toward him. Neither has anything
text: to say. Now Rocklin sits beside Arly, but faces the other
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Everything.
text: There is another stilted pause.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (her eyes sweeping
dialog: the morning)
dialog: Beautiful day.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: (reflecting)
dialog: It didn't start out so beautiful.
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: That's true of lots of things.
speaker_heading: ROCKLIN
dialog: Fer instance?
speaker_heading: ARLY
dialog: (hesitantly)
dialog: Well -- you and -- me.
text: There is another pause. But worlds are being said in the
text: language of eyes. Their heads move closer and now Rocklin's
text: arms sweep around the girl and they kiss.
text: GROUNDS NEAR ARLY AND ROCKLIN DAVE AND JULIO HURRYING THROUGH
speaker_heading: THE GRASS
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Hey, Rock -- Rock -- get out your
dialog: pencil and paper --
text: The two stop abruptly and look o.s.
text: ON ROCKLIN AND ARLY KISSING ON DAVE AND JULIO
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (grimacing)
dialog: Doggone it -- here Garvey is back in
dialog: this world -- an' they're out of it.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
speaker_heading: THE END
