speaker_heading: VINCENT

scene_heading: INT. FBI INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER
text: H sits alone, angry. VINCENT enters with FIORINI, holding a file.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: I am Agent Fiorini, this is Agent
dialog: Vincent...
dialog: A
dialog: Did you send those guys? Are you
dialog: responsible for this?
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Sir, I think you may be responsible
dialog: for shooting an FBI Agent. You are
dialog: Henry Roberts?
dialog: A
dialog: Who gave you a file on me?
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Is that your name?
speaker_heading: H
dialog: No. It’s a false identity.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Okay. You’ve been read your rights...
speaker_heading: H
dialog: My guy is coming.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: You haven’t made a call. No-one knows
dialog: you're here.
text: H says nothing. FIORINI slides a picture of YOUNGER towards him.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Can I ask you, do you recognize him?
text: H looks at the picture.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Yes.
text: FIORINI just nods, her smile giving nothing away.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Is this your screw-up?
speaker_heading: FIORINI .
dialog: You have a first name you can give me?
dialog: A real one?
text: H sighs and shakes his head.
dialog: Okay, let's Slay the game, all smiles,
dialog: make nice to me, you know how it goes.
dialog: You can call me H. What's your first
dialog: name, Fiorini?
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Felicity.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Oh that’s so cute, now we’re such good
dialog: friends, right?
speaker_heading: VINCENT ;
dialog: Attempted murder is not a joke.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Your agents came to my home, my
dialog: children were there. If I wanted to
dialog: kill them, I could have.
speaker_heading: (to FIORINI)
dialog: You have made a serious mistake.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: The Agent you shot, he identified
dialog: himself as FBI?
dialog: A
dialog: I didn’t get a chance to check him.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: So you did shoot him?
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Oh, Felicity, you are so good at this.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: He could have died. You gave him
dialog: coagulant to stop the bleeding,
dialog: morphine for the pain.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: I’m a Saint.
dialog: 17.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: You have those things just lying

speaker_heading: H
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Well thank you, H, you did the right
dialog: thing. You said you recognized him?
text: She points casually to the picture on the desk.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Yes. From the TV.
text: The door opens. BAINES walks in, with CHARLIE and EVE ZACHARY, an
text: elegant woman of 45. FIORINI and VINCENT are confused.
speaker_heading: BAINES
dialog: Agent Fiorini, we have received
dialog: instructions. This interview is
dialog: suspended.
speaker_heading: H (TO CHARLIE) FIORINI
dialog: You bastard, I RELY ON YOU. You Sir, what do vou mean? Who are
dialog: told me, one hundred per cent, these people? We can’t just...
dialog: those were not our guys.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE BAINES
dialog: Your name got on some NSA list, We have to surrender the
dialog: CIA gave it to FBI, no-one told suspect.
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: What the hell is this?
speaker_heading: BAINES
dialog: There’s been a foul-up. It seems this
dialog: “gentleman” is on our side. He’s going
text: to be working the same investigation.
dialog: I am what?
speaker_heading: ZACHARY (re BAINES )
dialog: I can’t believe you let this happen.
speaker_heading: BAINES
dialog: You sent us his file, don't blame FBI.
speaker_heading: ZACHARY (TO FIORINI)
dialog: Did you check your leads against the
dialog: witness protection program, like the
dialog: priority” list with all the red tags
dialog: saying "Do not touch"?
scene_heading: VINCENT BAINES
dialog: He’s in witness protection? We didn’t have time for that!
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: ZACHARY
dialog: We put him there so you would leave

scene_heading: CHARLIE (TO FIORINI) H_(TO ZACHARY )

speaker_heading: ZACHARY
dialog: Mister Baines, you do what you like,
dialog: but right now he comes with us.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Wait a minute, he dam near killed one
dialog: of our agents...
speaker_heading: ZACHARY
dialog: We have other priorities.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: You what!
speaker_heading: BAINES
dialog: Let it go, Fiorini.
speaker_heading: ZACHARY
text: Charlie, put him in the car, now.
text: ZACHARY leaves. CHARLIE goes to the door and holds it open for H.
speaker_heading: BAINES
dialog: Fiorini, this investigation is being
text: transferred to another facility.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: That’s crazy, we’re set up right here!
speaker_heading: BAINES
dialog: We have orders. I expect leadership
dialog: from you, not resistance.
text: FIORINI swallows it. H sighs and gets up.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Looks like we’re both getting screwed.
text: H heads for the door, but FIORINI gets in his face.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Who are you?
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Best not to ask.
text: CHARLIE and H leave. BAINES is left with the two agents.
speaker_heading: FIORINI

scene_heading: EXT. SITCON (SITUATION CONTROL CENTER) - DAWN, SUNDAY
text: Two black SUV’s on the road. Inside them are FIORINI and her team,
text: LEONARD, JACKSON, PHILLIPS. Also SUTTON, a young security
text: officer, in dark suit, shades, and earphones.
text: The SUV’s steer into a gap in a concrete wall. Gates close behind
text: them. Uniformed personnel and dogs scan the vehicles.
text: The SUV's drives into a walled compound, a former military base.
text: Some of the buildings are derelict and boarded up. They pull up
text: outside a large building.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY, SITCON - MOMENTS LATER
text: They enter a large lobby area, which is buzzing, packed with dark
text: suits and military. MPs guard every door, and all the corridors.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: What is this place?
speaker_heading: SUTTON
dialog: Need to know, you don’t. This way.
scene_heading: INT. FBI ROOM, SITCON - MOMENTS LATER
text: In the new FBI room, the old suspect boards are being set up by
text: suits and military personnel. On the walls are the images o
text: YOUNGER, and the three different basement rooms. The AGENTS enter.
speaker_heading: SUTTON
dialog: This is where you work. At this point
dialog: I will take your firearms from you.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: You’re not taking my weapon. Who the
dialog: hell are you?
speaker_heading: SUTTON
dialog: Listen, lady, just hand over the gun.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: You call me “Agent”. And you try
dialog: taking my weapon, I will shove it
dialog: right up your ass.
speaker_heading: GUNTER
dialog: Let her keep the dam thing.
text: GENERAL GUNTER is there, a bull of a man. VANDERBIDEN is behind
text: him, a civilian, pompous and overweight. SAUNDERS is behind them.
speaker_heading: SUTTON
dialog: Yes Sir. This is General Gunter,
dialog: Commander, Sitcon.
speaker_heading: GUNTER
dialog: You’re Fiorini?
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Agent Fiorini.
text: He looks at her. A woman.
speaker_heading: GUNTER
dialog: FBI is here to assist with
dialog: investigative duties under my command.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: No Sir, Posse Comitatus. Unless the
dialog: President has invoked Martial Law, the
dialog: military has no jurisdiction over
dialog: civilian authority.
speaker_heading: GUNTER
dialog: Defence Authorization Act 2007. You
dialog: may have missed the small print. Tell
dialog: her, Mister Saunders.
text: Saunders looks grim.
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: President has the authority to use the
dialog: armed forces in order to suppress, in
dialog: any State, any insurrection, unlawful
dialog: combination or conspiracy.
speaker_heading: GUNTER
dialog: Can we get on with this?
text: VANDERBIDEN gives SUTTON a tape, which he puts in a VCR.
text: and H enter the room. The agents are horrified.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Hello Felicity. Isn’t this fun?
speaker_heading: VANDERBIDEN
dialog: Welcome. This is the Situation Control
dialog: Center. My name is Vanderbiden, I’m
dialog: with the Department of Homeland
dialog: Security. Two days ago we received.
speaker_heading: GUNTER
dialog: Play the fucking tape.
text: The tape begins. FIORINI stares at H, who smiles,
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: and points at
text: the screen. FIORINI hears the voice and turns to watch.
text: On the tape, the image of YOUNGER appears. He is in what looks
text: like a basement room, standing in front of a large device.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: YOUNGER (ON SCREEN)
dialog: In the name of Allah the merciful, and
dialog: his prophet Mohammed, 1 gace be upon
dialog: him. My name is Yusuf Atta Mohammed.
dialog: My former name is William Arthur
dialog: Younger. All the rest you will learn
dialog: from your files. This is location one.
speaker_heading: SUTTON
dialog: We took a screen capture of all the
dialog: locations, cleaned them up, took him
dialog: out of it. And took that thing out.
speaker_heading: YOUNGER (ON SCREEN)
dialog: Some of you will recognize this. It is
text: a bomb.
text: FIORINI gasps. The location and sound changes on the tape.
speaker_heading: YOUNGER (ON SCREEN)
dialog: This is location two. All the
dialog: locations are in urban areas. I have
dialog: demands which will be met by you, or
dialog: these bombs will explode. TI will give
dialog: you these demands at a later date.
text: The location and sound change again.
speaker_heading: YOUNGER (ON SCREEN)
dialog: This is location three. All three
text: devices are identical. All three will
dialog: explode in seven days, on Friday the
dialog: 21st at lpm. And all three of these
dialog: devices... are nuclear bombs.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Oh my God...
speaker_heading: YOUNGER
dialog: Your experts will want evidence, of
dialog: course, so I will now describe the
dialog: technical aspects of each device.
text: YOUNGER begins to go through the details. SUTTON mutes the sound.
speaker_heading: GUNTER
dialog: We'll spare you the details. After
dialog: 9-11, iP there’s a one per cent
text: chance, the threat is considered real.
dialog: This one is 99 per cent. He’s one of
dialog: us. A military scientist, specialist
dialog: in field nuclear weapons. Served in
dialog: Iraq with Special Forces to check out
dialog: nukes. A grade ‘A’ guy, top honors,
dialog: totally dedicated.
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: His father is American. Worked at the
dialog: embassy in Pakistan, met a woman
dialog: there, became a Moslem so he could
text: marry her, forced to leave the
dialog: Diplomatic Corps. They had a son in
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS (cont'd)
dialog: Pakistan, then moved back here, the
dialog: son was granted citizenship..
dialog: And the boy just got the normal
dialog: background check. After all it would
dialog: be so wrong for anyone to suggest that
dialog: Islamic terrorists have one thing in
dialog: common - they're all Islamic.
text: H laughs at himself. The others look at him with disgust.
speaker_heading: VANDERBIDEN
dialog: This is not funny.
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: He’s made no demands, no further
dialog: contact.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Where could he get nuclear material?
speaker_heading: GUNTER
dialog: Three years ago he was on a team
dialog: checking nuclear facilities in Russia.
dialog: A
dialog: Oh, great choice.
speaker_heading: GUNTER
dialog: Since then, some material has gone
dialog: missing The Russians can’t trace
dialog: about fifteen, eighteen pounds, they
dialog: can’t be accurate. Around five pounds
text: on each bomb. Three big cities.
speaker_heading: FIORINI (TO SAUNDERS)
dialog: Sir, do we have any direct evidence
dialog: that he’s for real?
text: SAUNDERS turns to GUNTER, who sighs, and nods.
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: The Iranians paid him twenty million
dialog: to get nuclear material out of Russia
dialog: and bring it back to them. They \se set
dialog: the whole thing up. Then they lo
dialog: track of him, and the money.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: How do we know this?
speaker_heading: GUNTER
dialog: They told us. One of their Generals
dialog: was a little concerned. We might think
dialog: they were responsible for what Younger
dialog: does with the stuff. Nice excuse to
dialog: bomb the crap out of them.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: What does he want? Why did he do it?
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Jesus, the question is not “why he did
dialog: it”,but “where are the fucking bombs”?
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: You think you can answer one without
dialog: the other?
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: His wife is a liberal type,
dialog: environmental nut. She wanted a
dialog: divorce, he didn’t. He tried to take
text: their two kids back to his Mother in
dialog: Pakistan. The court stopped him, gave
dialog: custody to the wife. Maybe that
dialog: turned him, we don’t know. At some
dialog: point he became a fundamentalist.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: He wants to nuke us because we took
dialog: his kids?
speaker_heading: H
dialog: You mess with my family, I’d feel the
dialog: same way.
speaker_heading: VANDERBIDEN
dialog: I have copies of his restricted file.
text: VANDERBIDEN hands out files. FIORINI grabs hers and scans it.
speaker_heading: H (TO CHARLIE)
dialog: Everything I need in here?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: You’1l inform me of any developments?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Not much point if you don't.
speaker_heading: GUNTER
dialog: We need you to get back to work. But
dialog: you even whisper the word nuclear, and
dialog: you'll be withdrawn immediately.
dialog: Understood?
text: FIORINI looks up from the file, angry.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: You knew all this and you didn’t tell
dialog: us? We could have cracked this before
dialog: it even happened.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: VANDERBIDEN
dialog: Intelligence couldn't put the pieces
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: But that’s exactly what we do!
speaker_heading: GUNTER
dialog: So how come our people found his home.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Maybe because they had the file, Sir.
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: I sent Agent Vincent down there. We
dialog: have forensics working on it now. You
dialog: better take a look.
speaker_heading: GUNTER (TO H)
dialog: You too.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Will someone please tell me who this
dialog: person is?
speaker_heading: GUNTER
dialog: Just do your job, Fiorini.
text: FIORINI looks at H. H smiles back.
scene_heading: INT. BALTIMORE HOUSE - LATER
text: FIORINI, H and CHARLIE go through the house with VINCENT. Plain,
text: lifeless, bare. Family photos, parents, a blonde wife with two
text: kids, military buddies in fatigues. An American flag on the wall.
text: ERT technicians in plastic suits are still working. H seems bored.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: They peeled this place apart. This guy
dialog: is so clean, he’s weird.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Nothing out of place. Everything as it
dialog: should be. The female cousin, Aliah
dialog: Mustafa. No trace of her?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: No other prints, no fibers, no hair.
dialog: Just him.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: That’s impossible.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Someone cleaned it real good.
text: CHARLIE and H move on. FIORINI speaks quietly to VINCENT.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Did Military Intelligence go through
dialog: this place before we did?
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I think we can assume that.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: What the fuck is going on? And you,
dialog: why the hell didn’t you tell me you'd
dialog: been sent here?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: They told me not to.
text: FIORINI shakes her head in disbelief.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Are they trying to replace me with
dialog: someone else - like you?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Nobody else could lead this
dialog: investigation, we don’t have time to
dialog: mess around, and you have all the
dialog: inside tracks. Yes, they asked me,
dialog: and that’s what I told them.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Thanks. Sorry.
scene_heading: VINCENT .
dialog: It’s not personal, Fliss. I just hope
dialog: I did the right thing.
text: VINCENT looks at her. She avoids his gaze and goes into the next
text: room. She sees H, leaning against the wall, arms folded.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: So are you some kind of investigator?
dialog: (H smiles)
dialog: You don’t seem to be interested.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Charlie gives me all the information I
dialog: need. I like to keep my focus clear
dialog: on the subject.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: What subject? Who are you people?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: The Service.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: What service? What agency?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No agency wants any part of us.
dialog: A
dialog: We’re private contractors.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I’m the contractor, you’re just a sub-
dialog: contractor.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Oh, right, I’m a sub-contractor.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: What do you do?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: We do stuff. No office, no oversight,
dialog: no fuss.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: There must be legal limits to your
dialog: organization?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah. I guess there must be.
text: They laugh. VINCENT enters.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: You better see the garage.
scene_heading: INT. BALTIMORE HOUSE, GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
text: They enter a large garage workshop. Machine tools, chain hoists,
text: nuke suits, engineering rigs.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: They say the bombs were made here.
dialog: Traces of radiation, three types
dialog: including enriched uranium.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: To what level?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Safe enough to walk around, that’s all
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: He made three nuclear bombs in this
dialog: garage and all we have is trace levels
dialog: of radiation?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Maybe he had another place.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: There’s nothing here, is there?
dialog: Charlie, can we get to work?
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, SITCON - LATER
text: SUTTON leads them into the Conference Room. Full of military and
text: civilians in earnest discussion. GENERAL GUNTER is arguing
text: furiously with SAUNDERS, but he stops talking as they approach.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: GUNTER
dialog: You’ve seen the house?
speaker_heading: H
dialog: That’s a scary place. You must have
dialog: been pleased when you got him.
text: GUNTER turns on him in alarm.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Why are you wasting my time, General?
speaker_heading: GUNTER
dialog: Who told you we have him? Who?
speaker_heading: H
dialog: I’m here. You called me in. So
dialog: obviously...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUNTER
dialog: Wait here.
text: GUNTER goes, leaving SAUNDERS, who is clearly seething with anger.
text: CHARLIE laughs, FIORINI is confused.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Wait, what is this, we’re searching
dialog: the whole country for this guy?
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: These idiots have had him 24 hours.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Why didn’t they say? How was he
dialog: caught?
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
text: A security officer saw him in a mall.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
text: His picture is plastered all_over the
dialog: country, and he goes to a mall?
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Sure, Macy’s returns department. “I’m
dialog: sorry, this uranium you sold me is
dialog: just not enriched enough...”
text: SAUNDERS looks at H in disgust and takes FIORINI aside.
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: Listen. The Military need us to
dialog: investigate, get the accomplices, find
dialog: the bombs, but they want to
text: interrogate the suspect themselves.
dialog: They’re allowing one agent inside...
text: GUNTER and COLONEL KERKMEJIAN approach.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: GUNTER
dialog: This is Colonel Kerkmejian: Military
dialog: Intelligence. He’1ll take you to him.
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: Fiorini, you report back only to me.
text: FIORINI looks at SAUNDERS. GUNTER is incredulous.
speaker_heading: GUNTER
dialog: You're sending her!
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: She’s leading the investigation: she
dialog: goes in. General, you’ll have to let
dialog: us interrogate him, and you know it.
speaker_heading: GUNTER
dialog: FBI will get access to the prisoner as
text: soon as he becomes available.
text: GUNTER turns to FIORINI, H and CHARLIE.
speaker_heading: GUNTER
dialog: Until then, that man is ours. You
dialog: observe, and that is all.
speaker_heading: KERKMEJIAN
dialog: Follow me, please.
text: KERKMEJIAN leads FIORINI, CHARLIE and H, who turns to FIORINI.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: They don’t seem to want you guys
dialog: around, do they?
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE HALL, SITCON - MOMENTS LATER
text: KERKMEJIAN leads down a corridor, which gets increasingly narrow
text: and dark. There is an MP at the door ahead of them.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Who exactly is interrogating this man?
speaker_heading: KERKMEJIAN
dialog: Other Government Agencies have that in
dialog: hand.
dialog: (to H)
dialog: I don’t know your work, but they tell
dialog: me you broke the Chechen case?
dialog: A
dialog: I guess I did.
scene_heading: INT. THE HALL, SITCON - CONTINUOUS
text: The MP opens the door, and they walk into the back of the HALL.
text: This might once have been the base Assembly Room. Seats and
text: tables, with a crowd of military and civilians. At one end is an
text: INTERROGATION ROOM, with an air-lock door, and a wall of glass.
dialog: 30.
text: FIORINI gasps. IN THE ROOM is YOUNGER, naked, hooded. He is spread-
text: eagled, leaning angainst the wall on his fingérs. Water is spraying
text: over his hood, he is gasping for breath. Cold-air fans blow
text: at him, and he shivers uncontrollably.
text: An_ interrogator, ORDEN, is dressed in a warm coat, and over a
text: relay we hear his insistent questions. KERKMEJIAN speaks quietly.
speaker_heading: KERKMEJIAN
dialog: This is the Interrogation facility.
text: The subject is in there, soundproof,
dialog: one- way glass. We have experts from
dialog: multiple agencies, the mi itary, nuke
dialog: specialists, psychologists, analysts
text: every word and movement he makes.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Any psychics in here?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Shut up, H.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Why not, they got everything else.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Who’s in charge here? This is illegal!
speaker_heading: KERKMEJIAN
dialog: We never strike him. Hot and cold,
dialog: sleep deprivation, intense noise,
text: bright eghts, threats of violence.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Oh, he must be terrified. Where are
dialog: the dogs, there should be dogs...
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Who gave you authorization to...
speaker_heading: KERKMEJIAN
dialog: Everything here is within operational
dialog: parameters, Agent.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Colonel, if you decide to use H, he
dialog: can’t work with all these people.
speaker_heading: KERKMEJIAN (SMILING)
dialog: You want us to get rid of the others?
speaker_heading: H
dialog: That won't be difficult.
text: H walks to the front of the Hall. KERKMEJIAN, CHARLIE, and FIORINI
text: follow. A stir, as some recognize him, and others whisper his
text: name. FIORINI sees the disgust on their faces. One stands up.
speaker_heading: LUBITCHICH
dialog: You’re not serious? Tell me he's not
dialog: here.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: H
text: Charlie, the amateurs are in charge,
dialog: this won’t work.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You may have to make it work. They’re
dialog: going to need you on this one.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Make it work? Okay.
dialog: (He smiles at Fiorini)
dialog: Let’s make it work.
text: H looks at the crowd of experts. VANDERBIDEN is squashed into a
text: seat. In the front row is ZACHARY. Next to her is LUBITCHICH, in
text: fatigues, six foot four of muscle. An older, QUIET MAN sits to one
text: side, a cane in his hand. H turns to look through the glass wall.
text: FIORINI looks too. The little details of a naked, suffering man.
text: Suddenly H steps forward, opens the outer door to the Room, and
text: steps inside. He opens the inner door before anyone can stop him.
speaker_heading: LUBITCHICH
dialog: What the hell...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh shit.

speaker_heading: FIORINI

speaker_heading: KERKMEJIAN

text: IN THE BASEMENT, they watch. KERKMEJIAN gives a nervous laugh.
speaker_heading: KERKMEJIAN
dialog: Wait...he’s not..
text: IN THE CELL, H lifts the fire-ax, and brings the hammer-head down
text: hard. YOUNGER lets out a yell of shock and agony. H flips the ax
text: over in mid-air. Now he brings the ax-head down. Another hideous
text: shriek of pain. With a little click of his tongue, H_uses the fire-
text: ax like a putter, to tap something down the table. It is the
text: crushed top joint of YOUNGER’S little finger.
text: IN THE BASEMENT, amazement, then panic.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: NO!
speaker_heading: VANDERBIDEN
dialog: Oh God.

speaker_heading: H
dialog: Oh not again, come on guys...
speaker_heading: KERKMEJIAN
dialog: Out, get out!
text: ALVAREZ is there with the medical kit.
speaker_heading: H

text: IN THE HALL, he takes a tissue and wipes the blood from his hand.
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: VANDERBIDEN
dialog: That's your technique? You're a

speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: This man must be removed immediately.

speaker_heading: KERKMEJIAN
dialog: No, but I can’t...
speaker_heading: QUIET MAN
dialog: Then don’t get in the way.
text: KERKMEJIAN is stunned. H is by the door of the CELL.
speaker_heading: H (TO ALVAREZ)
text: Tape his mouth.
text: H closes the Cell door. On the monitor they see ALVAREZ tape

speaker_heading: H
dialog: Colonel, lose the gorillas.
speaker_heading: KERKMEJIAN
dialog: Listen, if I'm in charge here...
speaker_heading: H (POINTS AT YOUNGER)
dialog: You're not, he is, and we need to

speaker_heading: KERKMEJTAN (TO ZACHARY)
dialog: I can’t...I won’t authorize him to.
speaker_heading: ZACHARY
dialog: So let it happen without your

speaker_heading: KERKMEJIAN
text: They stay right outside the door.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: It’s a deal.
text: KERKMEJIAN nods, and the MP’s leave. H returns to the Cell.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: I don’t believe this, that man should
dialog: be pulled out right now.
speaker_heading: ZACHARY
dialog: No honey you should. You want to go,
dialog: that’s fin
text: IN THE CELL, YOUNGER writhes in agony as he tries to breathe
text: against the tape. H takes a scalpel and puts a small hole in the
text: tape between YOUNGER’S lips. Desperately, he sucks in a tiny
text: stream of air. It just prolongs the agony. H turns to ALVAREZ.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Undo this box, and lay out the
dialog: contents on the table, please.
text: ALVAREZ obeys. H adjusts lights, tilts the chair, checks the array
text: of swabs, instruments, drills, and gadgets that look like garden
text: tools. YOUNGER writhes more, approaching unconsciousness.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: You worked for me before. Remember the
dialog: Chechen girl? You cleaned up for me.
speaker_heading: ALVAREZ
dialog: That was someone else.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Sure it was. You can leave now.
text: ALVAREZ goes. H rips the tape from YOUNGER’S mouth, and he gulps
text: for air. H picks up a blade, and leans into his face.
dialog: Are you ready for this? No. No-one
dialog: ever is. Al your nightmares, your
dialog: worst fears. they’ re all here.
text: A moment of silence, as H lowers the blade. We do not see where.
text: YOUNGER looks into his eyes. This can’t be happening. The cut
text: that H makes is so smooth, so slow, that he gasps, before
text: experiencing unimaginable pain. Then comes the scream.
text: IN THE BASEMENT, KERKMEJIAN, VANDERBIDEN and FIORINI can’t believe
text: what they are seeing. CHARLIE and ZACHARY just watch.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Oh my God...
speaker_heading: KERKMEJIAN
dialog: Get General Gunter here right now!
text: VANDERBIDEN picks up a phone. The screams go on.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: This is beyond any legal limits.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What limits do you think that bastard
dialog: has?
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Colonel, I know the law, military and
dialog: civilian. We signed the United Nations
dialog: Convention against torture, the Geneva
dialog: Conventions...
speaker_heading: ZACHARY
dialog: The law is the Military Commissions
dialog: Act which says that no unlawful enemy
dialog: combatants may invoke the Geneva
dialog: Conventions.
text: The screams go on. FIORINI has to shout.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: That act declares torture illegal.
speaker_heading: ZACHARY
dialog: Sure it does, but unlawful combatants
dialog: have no right to Habeas Corpus, which
dialog: means they can’t bring any claim to
dialog: court, so how do they prove it?
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: No, the MCA refers to alien unlawful
text: enemy combatants. He is an American
dialog: Citizen.
speaker_heading: ZACHARY
dialog: He was granted citizenship. That was
dialog: revoked yesterday. He’s an alien.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: You can’t DO that!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (MIMICS)
dialog: “You can’t DO that”
text: A voice makes her turn.
speaker_heading: QUIET MAN
dialog: For Chris’sake there are three...
dialog: nuclear... bombs. You know what that
dialog: could do to our country?
text: VANDERBIDEN puts down the phone.
speaker_heading: VANDERBIDEN
dialog: General Gunter says he can't come
dialog: right now, you're in charge here, so
dialog: carry on.
speaker_heading: KERKMEJIAN
dialog: He says WHAT?
text: Suddenly, H comes out of the Cell. He nods to ALVAREZ, who goes
text: back in. The screams have become whimpers.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Do we have coffee here? We need to
dialog: arrange that.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: KERKMEJIAN
dialog: We could do this our way. Our methods
dialog: work.
dialog: A
dialog: I agree. CIA techniques are the best
dialog: in the world. So why didn’t they work
dialog: with him? I wonder.
text: H glances at ZACHARY.
speaker_heading: VANDERBIDEN
dialog: You didn’t even question him.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: You mean this blood on my coat would
dialog: be alright, if I got some information?
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: You_won’t get any. You do this and
dialog: he‘11 Say anything you want, and none
dialog: of it will be true.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: You think I don’t know that?
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Physical torture does not work.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Then why has it always been used? For
dialog: fun?
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: You seem to enjoy it.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: I need him to believe I have no
dialog: limits.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Do you?
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Everyone has limits. You better pray
text: we reach his, before we reach mine.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: This man has broken the law. I demand
dialog: his arrest. If you don’t do it I will!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Come on, it’s a little persuasion.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: There is no such thing as a ‘little’
dialog: torture.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You’1l find the US Government
dialog: disagrees with you.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: No. The President has specifically
dialog: rejected the use of torture...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Listen, bitch, let’s get this
dialog: straight. The law is as loose as a
dialog: horse full of shit. We can do any dam
dialog: thing we like.
text: FIORINI is stunned. H gestures to the QUIET MAN.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Let’s ask him. You’re the man, aren't
dialog: you? There’s always a man. Direct
dialog: access, highest levels, back door, no
dialog: names, no records. Do I have
dialog: authorization or not?
text: They all look at the QUIET MAN.
speaker_heading: QUIET MAN
dialog: Higher authority believes...that we
dialog: should all do what we think is best
dialog: for our country and its people.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Good. So this is how we will operate.
dialog: One, you will not interrupt me.
dialog: Two, you will not act on anything the
dialog: subject says until I confirm it.
dialog: Three, you will remember this. I am on
dialog: your side.
text: H returns to the Cell. FIORINI turns on the QUIET MAN.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: You allow this to continue, you are a
dialog: party to his doing it.
text: (She turns to KERKMEJIAN)
dialog: Colonel, the suspect is in danger, if
dialog: he dies we lose any chance of finding
dialog: the bombs.
speaker_heading: KERKMEJIAN
dialog: We do not fail in this mission. Stay
dialog: in and shut up, or get out and don’t
dialog: come back!
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: I am making an official complaint
dialog: right now.
speaker_heading: ZACHARY
dialog: Goodbye, Agent Fiorini.
text: The screams begin again. FIORINI turns to look, then leaves.
scene_heading: INT. FBI ROOM, SITCON - LATER
text: She bursts in, and goes straight to SAUNDERS, who sits with BAINES
text: in a small office to one side.
dialog: 49,
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Sir, we have to stop this!
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: Close the door, Fiorini, you report to
dialog: me, not to the whole room.
text: She closes the door and gathers herself.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: We have to stop them, they are
dialog: torturing...
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: SIT DOWN, please.
text: She sits. BAINES puts a document in front of her.
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
text: What's happening down there is clearly
dialog: illegal. We've prepared your official
dialog: protest, please sign it.
text: She looks at it in disbelief.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: You mean, you know?
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: What do you have for us, Fiorini?
speaker_heading: : FIORINI
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: You interviewed the suspect again?
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: No sir.
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: Then why have you left the room?
speaker_heading: FIORINI .
dialog: I can’t stay in there while they...
speaker_heading: BAINES
dialog: Agent, we're fighting to keep you
dialog: there. They won’t let us replace you,
dialog: they're hoping you'll crack. And now
dialog: you've walked out?
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: It’s happening, Agent, so use it. Let
dialog: this bastard soften him up, then use
dialog: your skills to...
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Soften him up!
dialog: 50.
text: SAUNDERS leans in close.
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: We have to be very careful. We can’t
dialog: get in the way of a good result. We
dialog: were criticized after 9-11, you know
dialog: how unfair that was. It’s essential
dialog: that we stay in the game, without
dialog: being a part of it.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: It’s essential we stay true to the
dialog: Constitution.
text: For a moment, SAUNDERS lets rip.
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: If those bombs go off there IS no
dialog: fucking Constitution! We are that
text: close to Martial Law.
dialog: (he calms down instantly)
dialog: My apologies. When H takes a break,
dialog: you get in there. Now please sign this
dialog: protest, and return...to your duty.
text: He slides the document towards her. She looks at it, and at them.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT CORRIDOR, SITCON - LATER
text: FIORINI walks past WINSTON, towards the steel door. SUTTON is
text: standing in front of it.
speaker_heading: SUTTON
dialog: Ma’am, you no longer have access.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: No, we agreed with General Gunter...
speaker_heading: SUTTON
dialog: I have instructions from inside not to
dialog: let ygo back in. Maybe your superiors
dialog: should send in a more experienced
dialog: Agent.
text: She thinks about hitting him. She walks away from the door and
text: stops, trying to work out what to do. WINSTON is there, a big,
text: hulking M! a Native American with a gentle voice.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: You really want to go back in there?
text: H comes out of the Basement.
speaker_heading: SUTTON
dialog: She’s upstairs, Sir.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Good, thank you.
text: WINSTON follows H as he walks down the corridor, passing FIORINI.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: You didn’t last long.
text: FIORINI follows them, and gets beside H. They walk fast, along
text: the corridor, up the stairs, passing TRUMAN, who stands on guard
text: there, and along another corridor. FIORINI tries to speak calmly.
speaker_heading: FIORINI |
dialog: There are other techniques of
dialog: interrogation, better ones.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Torture’s not a technique, it’s a
dialog: vocation.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: That's what makes you special is it?
dialog: Our secret weapon against the enemy?
speaker_heading: H
dialog: It's not about “the enemy”. It's
dialog: about us. Our weakness. We're on the
dialog: losing side, Felicity. We're afraid,
dialog: they’re not. We doubt, they believe.
text: H stops. This corridor has a window, with a glass door. He looks
text: through it at THE GARDEN, a meadow of overgrown brush, and trees.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: That's nice.
text: He walks on, FIORINI and WINSTON following.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: We need an army of people like me.
dialog: We're the only ones can match them.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: We don’t want to. We have values,
dialog: they’re worth something.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Oh really, how much? How many lives
dialog: are our “values” worth? You see, that
dialog: guy in there is not the problem.
dialog: You are.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY, SITCON - CONTINUOUS
text: RINA stands in the crowded lobby in her head-scarf and plain
text: clothes, jooking out of place, a suitcase and black bag beside
text: her. An MP stands nearby. H goes to her.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Hello darling, how are you? Agent
dialog: Fiorini, this is my wife, Rina.
speaker_heading: RINA
dialog: How do you do?
dialog: 52.
text: RINA holds out her hand. FIORINI is stunned. H looks at her.
text: FIORINI takes the hand.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: I’m so sorry, how do you do.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: We have a room for you, Sir, this way.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: No, we're going outside.
text: H takes the case and bag, and leads RINA away. WINSTON and FIORINI
text: watch them go, then follow.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN, SITCON - LATER
text: Outside the glass door, FIORINI and WINSTON watch H and RINA,
text: having a picnic under a tree. In their beautiful oasis of green, H
text: lies with his head on RINA’s la eating a sandwich. A suitcase is
text: open nearby, with his clothes, Eowels; washing kit, neatly
text: stacked. WINSTON shakes his head in disbelief.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: This is fucked-up.
text: FIORINI decides. She heads towards them.
speaker_heading: RINA
dialog: I brought you the blue pajamas.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Lucky if I get to use them. They have
dialog: guards at the house?
speaker_heading: RINA
text: The children play with them.
dialog: A
dialog: Hey, Felicity, you want a sandwich?
dialog: (no reaction from FIORINI)
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: (to RINA)
dialog: How long did it take to get here?
speaker_heading: RINA
dialog: One hour, if no traffic.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: That's too far, darling.
speaker_heading: RINA .
dialog: No, they drive me, it's fine.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Will you do the sauerkraut for me
dialog: tomorrow? And the German sausage?
speaker_heading: RINA
dialog: With cream?
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Yes please! We can't play with it,
dialog: though.
text: They giggle over this private joke.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: We'll meet out here, have picnics.
speaker_heading: ; RINA
dialog: Unless it rains.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: I don't think so. You think it might?
speaker_heading: RINA
dialog: I wish it would.
text: They look up. FIORINI too. White clouds, blue sky, beautiful. A
text: chink of metal makes her look down. H has opened the black bag
text: and takes out blades, pincers, clamps. FIORINI watches in horror.
speaker_heading: RINA
dialog: It’s all there, I checked.
text: CHARLIE calls out from the glass door.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: H, a word.
text: H sighs, gets_up, and walks to meet CHARLIE. FIORINI approaches
text: RINA, who replaces the instruments neatly into the black bag.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: You know. You know what he does...
speaker_heading: RINA
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: How can you? Your family, your
dialog: children, you’re in the same house
dialog: with him. “He’s not normal.
speaker_heading: RINA
dialog: I lost my first family. In Bosnia.
text: Three men came. They were neighbors,
dialog: wet ‘normal’. I was raped in front of
dialog: amily. Then they were killed in
dialog: front of me. All the pieces that could
dialog: be cut off, were cut off. My little
dialog: boy was last to die. These were
dialog: ‘normal’ men. I was arrested, given
dialog: to H. He is a good man, I respect him.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: He tortures people! You “respect” him?
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: RINA
dialog: You do not “love” such a man. Love is
dialog: easy. Respect, that is hard. Duty is
dialog: har Courage is hard.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: But torture isn't hard?
speaker_heading: RINA
dialog: Yes, it is very hard. He knows how far
dialog: he will have to go. You Americans are
dialog: so soft. But you will learn. Your
text: time is coming.
text: H approaches.
dialog: A
dialog: You two making friends?
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: They’re not letting me back in, I need
dialog: to question the suspect.
text: The three of them freeze for a moment. The torturer, his wife,
text: and the agent. H nods his head.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Take that for me?
text: He pushes the black bag at FIORINI, and embraces RINA.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: I’1ll take the sandwich in. See you
dialog: tomorrow, darling.
text: He picks up the sandwich, the case, and his coat, and walks to the
text: glass door. FIORINI follows him, carrying the black bag.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: You’re going to let me in?
dialog: A
dialog: Sure, I need you. When I work, I don’t

dialog: That’s what you do.
speaker_heading: FIORINI

scene_heading: INT. THE BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER
text: FIORINI enters the Basement. The observers see she is carrying his

speaker_heading: ZACHARY

speaker_heading: H
dialog: I know the FBI is an anti-government

dialog: ink we should let her work.
speaker_heading: (to FIORINI)
dialog: Go ahead, make it quick.
text: FIORINI enters THE CELL for the first time, and is shocked at what
text: she sees. YOUNGER is naked, but the wounds on his body are
text: carefully dressed. He hangs by his wrists from a rope attached to
text: a pulley in the ceiling. His feet cannot touch the ground. He is
text: in pain. There are chains hanging from the ceilin hooks in the
text: walls, tables laid out with instruments, water Ling: with dripping

speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Jesus Christ...

speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Your friends at the mosque. Your

dialog: with this? Your wife is liberal,
dialog: isn't she. This won’t impress her.
speaker_heading: YOUNGER
dialog: Yes it will. Have you found her yet?
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Yusuf, we’re going to find these
dialog: bombs. You talk to me, maybe we could
dialog: make this easy? Otherwise that
dialog: bastard’s going to keep on at you.
speaker_heading: YOUNGER
dialog: I’m prepared for that.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Yusuf, I can’t believe you want to
dialog: hurt innocent women and children...
speaker_heading: YOUNGER
dialog: Won’t come to that. They will agree
dialog: to my demands.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: God dam it, you haven’t made any
dialog: demands.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: YOUNGER
dialog: Don’t swear. God hears you. He sees
dialog: everything. He knows I’m right.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Give me one of the bombs. Just one.
dialog: Give me proof.
speaker_heading: YOUNGER
dialog: You don’t want proof.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Then they’1l listen to you, Yusuf,
dialog: they’1l know you’re serious.
speaker_heading: YOUNGER

speaker_heading: FIORINI

speaker_heading: YOUNGER
dialog: I don't need your help. I can take it.
dialog: I deserve it.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: What?
text: H immediately applies the prod. YOUNGER shrieks. FIORINI runs to
text: the door, fumbling with it, rushing to get out.
text: IN THE BASEMENT, she comes face to face with ZACHARY.
speaker_heading: ZACHARY
dialog: Agent, I don’t care what your FBI
dialog: people are saying. You need to get
dialog: out while you still can.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: You’d like that, wouldn’t you.

speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Did he talk about religion?
speaker_heading: MISTER WILSON
dialog: We had nothing against him being

speaker_heading: MISTER WILSON
dialog: Yeah. God, she was a bitch. You know

speaker_heading: FIORINI

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Rina’s upstairs.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: That’s nice. Don’t turn off the sound,
dialog: people, you don’t have to watch but
dialog: you do have to listen.
text: H_turns on the sound at the monitor. He peels off some latex

text: He turns to ALVAREZ.
dialog: A
dialog: Turn the Lights low in there, then
dialog: take a brea one hour. Okay, Colonel?
text: ALVAREZ looks surprised.
speaker_heading: KERKMEJIAN
dialog: Okay. You talk to no-one.
text: ALVAREZ turns down the lights in the Cell, and leaves.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: I’m going in.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: No, let him rest.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: God dam it, I need to question him!
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Give him ten minutes. The adrenaline
dialog: goes, he’ll start weeping. That’s when
dialog: you go in, not before. But if he falls
dialog: asleep, press that button. It’ll give

speaker_heading: H
dialog: I need a break, if he weeps, talk to

speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: When your methods fail, don’t think

speaker_heading: H
dialog: You think I want to run away?
speaker_heading: (to ZACHARY )
dialog: Tell her. I got nowhere to run, have

speaker_heading: (to FIORINI)
dialog: Go ahead, ask the fucking CIA! Ask
dialog: er!
text: H stomps out. A beat. FIORINI turns to ZACHARY.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Alright, what am I supposed to ask?
text: ZACHARY sighs.
speaker_heading: ZACHARY
dialog: There was a girl. She was daughter of
dialog: a Chechen leader. Twenty-four, good
dialog: looking « We needed names. The Press
dialog: got hold of it. Some idiot who no
dialog: onger has his job made a mistake,
dialog: blamed a rogue interrogator - H.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: You gave his name out? And now the
dialog: Chechens want to kill him?
speaker_heading: ZACHARY
dialog: Well, after what he did...
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Go on.
speaker_heading: ZACHARY
dialog: Usual stuff at first, like this. Then
text: he had her raped. Used the local jail.
text: Twenty-four hours, one after another.
dialog: That was just the beginning.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: And did it work?
speaker_heading: ZACHARY
dialog: You've become like everyone else.

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: He’s falling asleep.
speaker_heading: KERKMEJIAN
dialog: What?

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: He’s asleep.
speaker_heading: VANDERBIDEN

speaker_heading: ZACHARY

speaker_heading: VANDERBIDEN

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Fiorini, why don’t you do it?
speaker_heading: KERKMEJIAN
dialog: I’1l do it
text: KERKMEJIAN stands beside the switch, his finger poised. They watch
text: him. He pushes the switch. Immediatély the darkened Cell is lit up
text: with sparks, as YOUNGER’s body arches into the air in agony.
speaker_heading: VANDERBIDEN
dialog: That’s enough. Turn it off!
text: KERKMEJIAN flicks the switch repeatedly. Nothing.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Turn it off!
speaker_heading: KERKMEJIAN
dialog: I can’t!
speaker_heading: ZACHARY
dialog: Oh God, it’s killing him.
text: KERKMEJIAN rips the wires from the switch-box. No effect. They
text: all rush for the door of the Cell.
text: INSIDE THE CELL, YOUNGER is arched upwards» shaking. There are
text: cables all over the floor. One is pulled from a socket. No effect.
speaker_heading: KERKMEJIAN
dialog: Where is it? Where the fuck is it?
text: They search desperately for the socket. KERKMEJIAN tries to pull
text: the cables from YOUNGER’S body. He electrocutes himself.
speaker_heading: KERKMEJIAN
dialog: SHIT!
text: Suddenly the current shuts off. Smoke and stench. YOUNGER twitches
text: on the table, and looks into FIORINI’s eyes, pleading.
dialog: 64.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN, SITCON - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: FIORINI comes out of the glass door. TRUMAN is on guard there. She
text: walks fast, straight to the tree. There, H and RINA sit together
text: watching a DVD of KATIE and PETER. H holds a cell-phone, a small
text: teddy bear, and a child’s painting.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Sweetheart, that’s so kind of you.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: You bastard!
text: H covers the phone, as the DVD plays on with children’s voices.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Would you mind?
dialog: (to the phone)
dialog: Yeah I’m watching xou right now, Mummy
dialog: brought the DVD. nd Peter sent baby
dialog: bear to see me, will you thank him?

dialog: Current ran for 15 seconds, he’s fine.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: You fixed it. You're playing with us,
dialog: you...
dialog: You all tried to save him, didn’t you.
dialog: I wanted him to see that.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Are you going to find these fucking
dialog: bombs?
speaker_heading: H
dialog: No, you are. I’m just part of the
dialog: process.
speaker_heading: (to RINA)
dialog: See you tomorrow.
text: H turns off the DVD player, and picks it up, with a bag of discs.
text: He takes his wrapped sandwich, touches RINA’s shoulder, and goes.
speaker_heading: RINA
dialog: My husband needs you. I_am jealous, I
dialog: wish I could help him. If he fails, it
dialog: will be bad, yes?
text: FIORINI turns her back and walks away.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR TO THE BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER
text: FIORINI reaches the steel door, where WINSTON now stands guard.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Soldier, you've covered your name tag.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: I don't want anyone here to know my
dialog: name. What you're doing in there, is
dialog: it right?
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Is it necessary?
text: FIORINI cannot answer. Inside, the SCREAMS begin again.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: No limit to what a democracy must do
dialog: to protect itself.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: I guess.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: You actually believe that shit?
text: FIORINI looks at him. She takes a deep breath, then goes inside.
scene_heading: INT. THE BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: What FIORINI now sees on the monitor is the worst thing she has
dialog: ever seen.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Oh no...
text: As the continuous screams of unspeakable agony echo around her,
text: FIORINI tries not to retch. VANDERBIDEN gets up.
speaker_heading: VANDERBIDEN
dialog: I can’t do this, I shouldn't be here.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh no, Homeland Security is leaving
dialog: us. What if there’s a hurricane?
text: VANDERBIDEN hurries out of the door. FIORINI confronts ZACHARY.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Alright, that’s it. I demand to be
dialog: allowed to question the prisoner. If
dialog: you refuse, I will hold you personally
dialog: responsible...
text: The voice of H calls over the speaker.
speaker_heading: H (ON SPEAKER)
dialog: Felicity! Felic...ity! Would you come
dialog: in here’ please? I need a little help.
text: FIORINI is horrified.
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: ZACHARY
dialog: Looks like you got your chance.
text: IN THE CELL, YOUNGER is strapped to the chair, his wrists tied
text: down. H uses a plastic sheet to cover his body and his hands. He
text: sits. FIORINI comes in, very slowly. He beckons her closer.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Just here.
text: She moves closer, then sees a blood-soaked bowl of human
text: fingernails. She retches. H puts a cloth over the bowl.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Oh, sorry.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: What do you want me to do?
speaker_heading: H
dialog: What are you willing to do? Look at
dialog: her, Yusut. Look at Miss America. If
dialog: she could get you to talk, that really
dialog: would be something, wouldn't it?
text: YOUNGER breathes harder, pulls against his restraints.
dialog: A
dialog: Oh. Look at that.
speaker_heading: __.FIORINI
dialog: Now you listen, I’m not...
dialog: A
dialog: You any good at massage? It would be
dialog: very helpful.
text: She can't believe what he is asking.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: No, not me - him. His neck muscles are
dialog: in spasm. Please? He needs a break.
text: She walks slowly around the chair. She puts her hands on YOUNGER’S
text: neck. He flinches. She starts to massage.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Mind if I play some music?
text: H turns on his DVD player. It is Haydn’s “Surprise” Symphony. It
text: starts softly, then later it bursts into life. H pops a pill.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: You want one of these, keep you going?
text: FIORINI shakes her head. He moves close to her, drops a couple of
text: pills in the pocket of her blouse.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Take some for later. Go as deep as you
dialog: can, he’s blocking the pain, I don't
dialog: want to lose sensitivity right now.
text: She realizes his reason for doing this, and pulls away.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Don’t stop. You’re easing his pain.
text: She starts again. H is very close to her.
dialog: A
dialog: Some subjects can take it from a male,
dialog: but a woman just cracks them up. I had
dialog: a nurse who used to assist me.
text: FIORINI is about to speak, but stops herself.
dialog: A
dialog: She must have been as sick as I am,
dialog: right? That's why I married her.
text: FIORINI looks at him.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Did Rina tell you what happened to her
dialog: family?
text: FIORINI nods. She continues the massage.
dialog: She tells total strangers sometimes.
dialog: It's embarrassing. Her people took
text: the village back the next day. They
dialog: captured the three men responsible,
dialog: and their families. She killed the
text: wives, and the children, in front of
text: the men. She then tortured them for
dialog: three days. Just when our troops
text: arrived, she killed them. The army
dialog: ut her in jail, but they needed a
dialog: avor, so they passed her on to me. We
dialog: Americans are wonderful. So man
dialog: morals, absolutely no ethics. Rina
dialog: and I were a good team. She could help
dialog: me now, but she has to look after the
dialog: children. Take them to school, tuck
dialog: them up, kiss them good night...
text: YOUNGER breaks into heaving sobs.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: THAT’S what I want!
text: e pulls the cloth aside, and immediately applies pincers to one
text: of YOUNGER’S fingernails. FIORINI moves back so fast she hits the
text: DVD player on the table, stopping the music. YOUNGER screams, and
text: so does FIORINI, hysterically.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: NO! STOP IT, STOP IT, STOP IT!
dialog: 68.
text: YOUNGER turns to her in agony.
speaker_heading: YOUNGER
dialog: Please?
text: She gets as close to YOUNGER’S face as she can bear.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: I can stop him, but you have to talk
dialog: to me. You have to give me something!
speaker_heading: YOUNGER
dialog: I'll talk. Please, I'll talk, I‘1l
dialog: talk!
text: H stops, and turns to FIORINI with a big smile.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Good girl...
text: IN THE BASEMENT, the observers are stunned. They stand and watch
text: YOUNGER, as he strains to speak.
speaker_heading: YOUNGER
dialog: I_am now willing...to make a statement
dialog: of my terms...to the President and
dialog: People of America.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh crap.
scene_heading: INT. FBI ROOM, SITCON - DAY
text: FIORINI is back with her team.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: I want a full psychological report,
text: voice analysis on every word he says.
dialog: We need to compare this with every
dialog: piece of video we have. And we asked
dialog: or the security camera tape of his
dialog: arrest, why the hell don’t we have it?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I’ll track it down.
text: The team break up as SAUNDERS approaches.
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: He’s ready. We have a live feed in the
dialog: conference room.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: I‘1ll get down there.
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: You got him to talk. At last.
text: FIORINI avoids his eye.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Sir, I don’t know if it was me...
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: You did well, Fiorini.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Thank you, Sir.
scene_heading: INT. THE BASEMENT, SITCON - MINUTES LATER
text: FIORINI enters. The observers watch the monitor, IN THE CELL
text: YOUNGER is strapped to the chair, in a fresh shirt, and woollen
text: hat, a blanket over his body. ALVAREZ stands close "py. SUTTON has
text: framed a camera just on his’ face.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: This is_a waste of time. We put him in
text: front of a camera lets a break
dialog: that’s what he Teese Now he'll offer
dialog: us a deal, we consider it, more time.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: That’s crap. If he talks at all,
dialog: that’s progress. And we don't make
dialog: deals with terrorists.
dialog: A
dialog: We do it every day. And they always
dialog: ask the impossible. Bomb Israel, elect
dialog: a homosexual president, stop killing
dialog: animals.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: He'll say he's been tortured, we’ll
dialog: deny it, he’ll want a broadcast, we'll
dialog: refuse it, he’1l make crazy demands,
dialog: and we'll reject them. What’s the
dialog: goddam point?
text: The monitor now shows the close-up of YOUNGER’s face.
speaker_heading: SUTTON (0.S.)
dialog: Okay, you can speak anytime.
text: In the Basement, the observers watch the video feed, as YOUNGER
text: speaks, slow but clear, getting better as he goes on.
speaker_heading: YOUNGER
dialog: Mister President...
dialog: I am currently being held on charges
dialog: of terrorism. I am Muslim, but I ama
dialog: loyal American, I love my wife...
dialog: (he chokes up)
dialog: I love my kids, I love my country
dialog: Since my capture, I have been well
dialog: treated by the splendid men and women
dialog: of our armed forces and police.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What the fuck...
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: YOUNGER
dialog: I do not require you to broadcast this
dialog: statement. That would set a dangerous
dialog: precedent. I have placed three bombs
dialog: in three American cities. I will
dialog: reveal their locations when you make
dialog: the following three public
dialog: announcements. First, that no further
dialog: financial support will be given to
dialog: puppet regimes and dictatorships in
dialog: any Islamic nation. Second, that the
dialog: US will withdraw all our forces, from
dialog: all Islamic countries. Third, that the
dialog: US will sign the Kyoto protocols on
dialog: global warming.
text: H can’t believe what he is hearing.
speaker_heading: YOUNGER
dialog: I am here for you, and available to
dialog: egotiate a reasonable time-frame for
dialog: all of these demands.
dialog: Mister President, I greatly admire
dialog: you, I know you want to stop wasting
dialog: taxpayers’ money supporting murderers.
dialog: I know you want to ring our boys home
dialog: to the nation that we love. Thank
dialog: you, and God Bless America.
text: The observers are stunned.
speaker_heading: QUIET MAN
dialog: We’re in trouble.
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, SITCON - LATER
text: The room as_ before, but this time with H present, his head sunk in
text: his hands. Everyone talking at once, shouting each other down.
scene_heading: VANDERBIDEN KERKMEJIAN
dialog: We cannot give in to terrorists! I'm saying we could persuade him
dialog: we are willing to consider...
scene_heading: . FIORINI KERKMEJIAN
dialog: He didn’t ask for a broadcast, ...being seen to be working
dialog: don’t you see what that means? towards his objectives.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: If this was released to the public he
dialog: knows we could never make a deal with
dialog: him. He wants to negotiate!
text: ; ZACHARY .
dialog: Negotiate! Are you out of your mind?
speaker_heading: GUNTER
dialog: He's crazy. Islamic terrorists don’t
dialog: give a shit about global warming.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
text: He’s trying to impress his wife.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: By exploding three nukes?
speaker_heading: GUNTER
dialog: Alright, so what do we advise the
dialog: White House?
dialog: A
dialog: Take the deal.
speaker_heading: VANDERBIDEN
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: H
dialog: His terms are reasonable, achievable,
dialog: and the American people would agree
dialog: with them.
speaker_heading: GUNTER
dialog: Which is why Y you can be dam sure they
dialog: won't get to hear them.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Well maybe they should.
speaker_heading: GUNTER
dialog: You two, on me please.
text: GUNTER, SAUNDERS and ZACHARY huddle around the Quiet. MAN and talk
text: privatély. The others are left out. H looks wiped out
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Charlie, do something. We’re running
dialog: out of time.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That's what you want.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Less time. Believe me, that's what
dialog: you want.
text: FIORINI looks at them both - what was that about?
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: You guys are whipped, aren’t you.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: You’re not going to break him.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: We'll find some little key that fits
dialog: his lock.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: You’11 kill him first.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: If he wants to be a martyr, he will
text: be. He knows how this is going to end.
speaker_heading: FIORINI / /
dialog: What do you mean? This man is going
dialog: to face trial.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: Felicity... how could they prosecute a
dialog: man with no fingernails?
text: FIORINI is shocked. GUNTER comes out of the huddle.
speaker_heading: GUNTER
dialog: Alright, pending further consultation,
dialog: I believe we can assume that the
dialog: current protocols of interrogation
dialog: continue until otherwise directed by
dialog: higher authority.
speaker_heading: iH
dialog: In other words, you want me to go on,
dialog: without telling me to go on. Right?
text: H stands. FIORINI leaves the room, fast.
scene_heading: INT. THE BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER
text: FIORINI enters THE CELL. YOUNGER is still dressed for his video.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Yusuf...how is it?
text: His voice is weak, but he is strangely calm.
speaker_heading: YOUNGER
dialog: I’m fine. I’m feeling just fine.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Yusuf, you_could make a deal. You got
dialog: these people cold. They can’t take you
dialog: to court, don’t you see? Not like
dialog: this. They can’t admit what they did.
dialog: You can get out of this. You give us
dialog: your accomplices, you tell us where
dialog: he bombs are, we put you on a flight
dialog: to Pakistan.
speaker_heading: YOUNGER
dialog: With my kids?
speaker_heading: FIORINI
text: They’1l negotiate. No-one outside
dialog: knows this ever happened. Give us the
dialog: bombs, you could be free!
text: H enters, with ALVAREZ.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: He doesn’t want to be free. Don’t you
dialog: et it, Fiorini. He put himself here,
dialog: e knew what we'd do to him.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: That’s bullshit.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: The only thing he wasn’t expecting was
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Yusuf, tell me where the bombs are.
dialog: Make the deal!
speaker_heading: YOUNGER
dialog: The bombs...will explode if my terms
dialog: are not met. But they will be. No
dialog: other choice. You have to tell them
dialog: that, Fiorini...
text: H_ jams a gag into YOUNGER’s mouth, and pulls his blanket aside.
text: ALVAREZ prepares some clamps. YOUNGER gags, eyes staring in fear.
dialog: A
dialog: you really don't want to be here for
dialog: is.
speaker_heading: FIORINI leaves.
text: IN THE BASEMENT, she heads for the door, as on the monitor YOUNGER
text: begins an agonizing scream. ZACHARY calls after her.
speaker_heading: ZACHARY
dialog: You have no authority to make any kind
dialog: of deal with that man!
scene_heading: INT. FBI ROOM, SITCON - EVENING OF THE FOURTH DAY
text: FIORINI, fighting exhaustion, paces as she talks with her inner
text: team. A board with a map of the world leans against a chair, with
text: marks and strings of tape all over it.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: CIA are liaising with foreign
dialog: intelligence sources. We got him in
dialog: Yemen, Pakistan, Russia, all over. He
dialog: used several passports, he_ got sloppy,
text: left traces all over the place.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Can we put him and the nuclear
dialog: material together at any time?
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: There’s a ton of circumstantial. The
dialog: Russians don’t know exactly..
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
text: He had fifteen, eighteen pounds of it.
dialog: That's not easy to transport.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: He had a lot of money. Paid somebody
dialog: for something.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Sure, but for what? We need to know
dialog: where he spent it? Deejay?
text: Another board goes up - a map of the USA, with just a few markers.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
text: Not so good. He came back in through
dialog: New York, we have him there,
dialog: Washington, Chicago. And one sighting
dialog: in Dallas. That was Phil.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Phil?
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: I figured he’d need a truck, I got a
text: room full of people checking every
dialog: rental agency. We got lucky with one
dialog: of his aliases.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Okay, keep driving it on, Deejay, you
dialog: push on those bank transfers.
text: The meeting breaks up.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: That’s good work, Phil. Don’t let them
dialog: rush you. Detail, you’re good at that.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: But they got so much on their map, how
dialog: come we got nothing on ours?
text: PHILLIPS goes. FIORINI stops. She looks at the two maps. Then she
text: looks around her, at the room full of urgent chaos. VINCENT comes
text: in, holding up a tape.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: The tape you wanted. Younger’s arrest.
text: TIME CUT TO LATER. FIORINI watches a grainy tape, of YOUNGER
text: walking into a mall. He looks around, and then sits on a bench.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: How long does he sit there?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Twenty-three minutes, Security told
text: the cops, they came in to get him.
dialog: She hurries
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
text: He walks in, he looks around, he sits
text: directly in front of a security
dialog: camera, and he stays there for twenty-
dialog: three minutes. My God. H is right.
text: over to SAUNDERS and BAINES.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Sir, have you seen those maps?
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: Yes, what is it?
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Everything | here is laid out for us.
text: His house is like a stage set, with
dialog: just enough nuclear residue. He has
dialog: traceable links with terrorist
dialog: contacts. He travels the world, we can
dialog: follow every step: But he comes back
text: home, he covers his tracks like a pro.
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: We have no direct evidence that he
dialog: possesses nuclear material.
speaker_heading: BAINES
text: Except a video with three bombs on it.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: And he knows how to make them look
dialog: just right, doesn’t he. He’s a clever
dialog: guy. So clever he gets himself caught
dialog: the day after he sends in the video?
dialog: (she points to the monitor)
text: He sits in a mall. His picture is
text: everywhere, including | on the TV in
text: that store, right behind him.
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: Intelligence have no doubt. He had the
dialog: time, the means, the capability, the
dialog: contacts, the finance...
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: When intelligence agencies look for
dialog: conspiracies, the ind them. We look
dialog: for evidence - and we don’t have it.
speaker_heading: BAINES
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: FIORINI
text: Some guy waves a toy gun in the air
text: and forces us to shoot him. Suicide by
dialog: Police. What about torture by
dialog: government?
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: BAINES
dialog: So he got himself captured so we could
dialog: torture him. He was prepared for that,
dialog: was he? Is that what you’re saying?
text: FIORINI stops cold. Thoughts racing through her head.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: No. That’s what he said. “I’m
dialog: prepared”, that’s what he said. I need
dialog: to get back in there.

speaker_heading: H
dialog: Sure. He’s all yours.
text: H strolls out of the Cell. YOUNGER blubbers like a child, all

speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Just us now. I know, Yusuf. I know

speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Is that right?
speaker_heading: YOUNGER
dialog: Yes. Please don’t let him hurt me

speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ZACHARY
dialog: That’s why our own techniques won't

speaker_heading: QUIET MAN
dialog: That man is a murderer. He’s just one

speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: And he’s the right guy, and that makes

speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: What does he want from me?

text: The door opens. _H enters. ALVAREZ pushes a blanketed figure in a
text: wheelchair. H pulls aside the blanket. It is YOUNGER.
text: Now we see his body clearly for the first time. He is burnt,
text: blackened, lacerated, broken. Without fingernails, his skull torn
text: and bloody, toes and knees dislocated. Blood and puss dribble from
text: open sores, vomit stains his shirt. They look at him in horror,
text: unable to speak. JEAN shrinks back in her chair.
speaker_heading: JEAN ;
dialog: What have you done to him? What have
dialog: you done?

speaker_heading: H (TO ALVAREZ)
text: Hold the chair.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: JEAN

speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: You’re not going to do that, not here.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: So it's alright in private, but not in
dialog: front of all these nice people?
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: We’re not going to let you do it.
text: H seems desperate now, losing control.
speaker_heading: H
dialog: You want to know where these bombs are
dialog: OR NOT? Huh? All of you, working

dialog: Or do you want HIM to win?
speaker_heading: FIORINI

speaker_heading: H

speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Take him back.
text: H reaches out with the knife. HE SLASHES JEAN’S THROAT, AND STABS
text: HER THREE TIMES, fast, straight in the heart. Blood sprays over
dialog: all the pretty uniforms.
text: YOUNGER howls with horror, as everyone screams, shouts, yells.

scene_heading: INT. CELL, SITCON - MORNING, FRIDAY

dialog: a reason.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: Reason? He's a psychopath.

speaker_heading: ZACHARY
dialog: What's he saying? What’s going on?
text: IN THE ROOM, YOUNGER watches as_H picks up a hood, a noose of

speaker_heading: H
dialog: Too late for questions or answers. You
dialog: did good. But I can’t let you live,

speaker_heading: H
dialog: I’1l be back in a few minutes. okay?

speaker_heading: H
dialog: He needs a little break.

speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: For God's sake, we have three hours!

text: As H removes his ga YOUNGER howls in horror and despair.
text: CHARLIE comes out of the Room, and H walks slowly towards it. He
text: turns to look at YOUNGER. He takes the noose from his pocket, and

text: at the handle. The rope is freed. But the inner door is jammed by
text: a chair under the handle.
text: The ax cleaves through the door, smashing, splintering. FIORINI
text: pulls her gun and fires a circular pattern into the laminated

text: by LUBITCHICH, who then joins ALVAREZ and runs out with the
text: gurneys. YOUNGER wails uncontrollably. The others come out of the
text: Room, shaking. FIORINI turns on them.
speaker_heading: FIORINI
dialog: You knew. You knew he could do this.
speaker_heading: (to CHARLIE }
