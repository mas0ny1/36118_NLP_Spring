scene_heading: EXT. JOE’S BACKYARD - DAY
text: Hammer strikes nail. It hits off-center, driving the nail in
dialog: crooked.
dialog: Reveal the carpenter: JOE TOY (14), Our Hero. A scrawny,
text: skater-type kid with greasy brown hair parted in the center.
scene_heading: EXT. JOE’S BACKYARD - DAY
text: On a magazine photo of an extreme biker taking off from a
dialog: wooden ramp. The biker, and the ramp, look awesome. Joe
text: lowers the magazine to reveal:
text: His ramp. Not awesome. Low quality, warped wood. Odd
text: angles. Nailheads protrude dangerously from different points
text: across the surface. A valiant effort, but no.
text: Joe grabs his TOOLBOX and walks inside.
scene_heading: INT. TOTTENVILLE HIGH SCHOOL, CLASSROOM - DAY
text: Joe sits in a middle row, doodling. The science teacher, DR.
text: FERRARA (40s) fires questions at the class.
speaker_heading: FERRARA
dialog: In any ecosystem we have indigenous
dialog: flora and...? Robert?
speaker_heading: KID (ROBERT)
dialog: Shale?
speaker_heading: FERRARA
dialog: No, not shale...I like where you’re
dialog: head’s at though...
text: Ferrara hears Joe doodling in the otherwise silent class.
text: Joe doesn’t notice Ferrara approaching. We see the drawing:
text: Joe, on horseback, riding into the FOREST. A girl rides with
text: him, clutching him around the waist. He colors her dress in
text: with a YELLOW HIGHLIGHTER.
text: Ferrara STOMPS HIS FOOT once loudly next to Joe, snapping him
text: out of his artistic trance.
speaker_heading: FERRARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Joe Toy. Flora and?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (turning page)
dialog: Fauna.
speaker_heading: FERRARA
dialog: Very good. An allamanda cathartica
dialog: would be an example of which?
dialog: (off Joe’s silence)
dialog: And an allamanda cathartica would
dialog: be an example of which?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I’ve never heard those words before
dialog: in my life.
speaker_heading: FERRARA
dialog: That was my hope. No drawing in
dialog: class, please. Allamanda
dialog: cathartica. Allamanda cathartica.
dialog: (noticing a raised hand)
dialog: Kelly.
text: We land on KELLY (15), a pretty girl...in a YELLOW DRESS.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Flora.
text: When Ferrara turns his back, Joe and Kelly make eye contact.
text: Joe rolls his eyes at her ass-kissing. She sticks her tongue
text: out. They’re clearly buddies.
scene_heading: EXT. TOTTENVILLE HIGH SCHOOL - 2 P.M.
text: School’s out. Students crowd the sidewalk. Joe walks his
text: bicycle alongside him, keeping pace with Kelly.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What were you drawing in there? It
dialog: was obviously top secret.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh. Just some...blueprints.
dialog: Patrick and me are working on this
dialog: bike ramp thing.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Blueprints? Huh. That’s funny.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Funny?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You just don’t strike me as like a
dialog: “man’s man,” y'know? Construction
dialog: and all. That’s not an insult.
text: Beat on Joe. Smiling, but insulted.
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D)
dialog: How's Patrick doing, by the way?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: He's fine. I think he’s supposed
dialog: to come back next week.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I was gonna say, if you guys want,
dialog: you should come to Thirsty
text: Thursdays tomorrow night.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: “Thirsty Thursdays.” I have no
dialog: idea what that is.
speaker_heading: KELLY
text: It’s a keg. At Wolf’s Pond.
dialog: Paul’s friends throw it every week
text: once it starts getting warm out and
dialog: ohmygod--
text: The boyfriend approaches, PAUL: 17, could be 36. Goatee,
text: earring. He’s bleeding noticeably from the shoulder.
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D)
dialog: What happened??
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hm? Some dog bit me. I’m fine.
text: He kisses her ‘hello’ on the mouth.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What? For no reason??
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Well I was hitting him and shit.
dialog: (to Joe)
dialog: What’s up man.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Oh -- Paul, you know Joe. We have
dialog: Bio together.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (handshake)
dialog: Yow.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (inspecting the wound)
dialog: Should we go to the hospital?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No. You want a bagel? C’mon. I
dialog: want an egg bagel.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Ugh!
dialog: (to Joe)
dialog: He always gets hurt, and he never
text: goes to the doctor.
text: Joe raises his eyebrows in false fascination.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Starving, babe.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Okay, okay. See you tomorrow, Joe!
text: Joe waves, watching as Paul leads her away, shoving his hand
text: into Kelly's back pocket as they walk.
dialog: Off his misery:
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN OF HUGENOT - DAY
text: Joe rides his bike home from school. We get an impression of
text: the town: a bank, a church, a barbershop. Quaint.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS
text: Joe steers through a narrow “trail” in the woods. It’s dense
text: with trees and brush.
text: Craning up above the trees, we see that the woods are
text: bordered on all sides by tracts of suburban houses. In the
text: deep distance, factory pipes.
text: Off the sound of a DOORBELL:
scene_heading: EXT. PATRICK’S HOUSE - DAY
text: Joe waits on the stoop. The door opens to reveal MRS.
dialog: MCGUIRE, 42. Patrick’s mom.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Patrick home?
scene_heading: MRS. MCGUIRE
dialog: Come in, Joseph.
scene_heading: INT. PATRICK'S HOUSE, GROUND FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
text: A modest country-theme home. Thomas Kinkade and Precious
text: Moments abound.
scene_heading: MRS. MCGUIRE
dialog: (calling upstairs)
dialog: Patrick! Joseph's here.
speaker_heading: PATRICK'S VOICE
dialog: I’m coming down.
scene_heading: MRS. MCGUIRE
dialog: Stay where you are! He will come
dialog: to you!
speaker_heading: PATRICK'S VOICE
dialog: I’m fine, ma!
text: At the top of the stairs, PATRICK MCGUIRE comes into view.
text: Though also 14, he’s a brick shithouse, a man by any physical
text: standard. There’s an AIR CAST on his left foot. He hops
text: down one step at a time.
scene_heading: MRS. MCGUIRE
dialog: Mother Cabrini, protect my son.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Stop praying, ma.
text: Another few steps. Painstaking.
scene_heading: MRS. MCGUIRE
dialog: Look at you! You're sweating.
dialog: You’re sweating from the pain!
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I‘m sweating from you, ma.
text: Two more stairs. He’s winded now.
scene_heading: MRS. MCGUIRE
dialog: I’m getting you a cold washcloth.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I don’t want one.
scene_heading: MRS. MCGUIRE
dialog: Well it’s happening. How about
dialog: you, Joseph? Would you like a cold
dialog: washcloth?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I would take one, yeah.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
text: No one is getting a cold washcloth.
scene_heading: INT. PATRICK'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - LATER
text: On TV: “STREET FIGHTER 2” for Super Nintendo. The boys sit
text: in spitting distance of the screen, concentrating.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: My mom reminds me of Blanka.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Because she wears cutoff jeans?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: No, because everything she says, in
dialog: my head, sounds like Blanka’s crazy
dialog: victory roar. Listen.
text: On TV: After a knockout, BLANKA stands on his hind legs and
text: roars three times.
speaker_heading: PATRICK (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s the sound I hear whenever
text: she speaks. Just the jibberish of
text: an undisciplined animal.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You hear that all day?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: All day.
text: He pauses the game.
speaker_heading: PATRICK (CONT'D)
dialog: I have to get out of this house,
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I mean I can’t stand another minute
dialog: of it. Of them. They’re down my
text: throat all day. They don’t stop.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Well, you'll be back at school
dialog: Monday, right? You can tough it
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: No, you don’t get it. They’re
dialog: killing me. Like, I’m getting
dialog: hives.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No you’re not.
text: Patrick lifts his shirt: a few small hives are scattered on
text: his torso.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: shit.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Yeah, shit is right.
scene_heading: INT. JOE'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Family dinner. Joe sits with his father, FRANK (51), and his
text: sister LISA (19), who wears a college-team hoodie.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Daddy, can Colin come tomorrow? He
dialog: really wants to meet you guys.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Can I get some sweet potato
dialog: casserole?
dialog: (then)
dialog: Who's Colin?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: He's my boyfriend of seven months.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hm. What are his prospects? How
dialog: does he plan to support you?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: He’s Sri Lankan.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Right, right. Aren’t we all.
dialog: (passing food)
dialog: Put that back over by you. Move
dialog: the water.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Speaking of tomorrow -- can you
dialog: drive me to Wolf’s Pond at like 8?
text: Joe notices Frank staring at him in mild shock.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Tomorrow. Thursday night, Joe.
dialog: What do you think we’re sitting
dialog: here talking about?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What are we talking about?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Is this a joke? Carol is coming
dialog: over Thursday. We’re having Game
dialog: Night. I told you about this weeks
dialog: ago.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You never told me about that!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: That's horseshit, Joe. I told you
dialog: at least twice, and I watched you
dialog: write it on your forearm in
dialog: permanent marker.
text: Joe glances at his forearm. There is some faded text.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Well what if I don’t want to meet
dialog: “Carol”? I don’t make you meet all
dialog: the girls I bang out.
text: Lisa snickers.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: This is not a debate, Joe! The
dialog: plans are made.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Just be there, and be pleasant.
dialog: She’s making lamb stew for us.
text: She’s going out of her way.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Lamb stew? What is this, Beowulf?
dialog: I’m not touching it.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Believe me, you’re touching it.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: It'll be fun, Joe. You'll get to
dialog: meet Colin.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (to Lisa)
dialog: I think I’m done hearing that name
dialog: tonight, okay?
text: Joe simmers at Frank, livid.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: What, Joe.
text: Joe rises silently and moves to the wall phone.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Joe picks up the receiver and shoots Frank a threatening
dialog: look.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: We’re supposed to be past this,
dialog: Joseph! For Christ’s sake!
dialog: Remember what we talked about.
dialog: Think of people who really need to
dialog: call 911!
text: A moment of tension. Then, Joe opens the dishwasher, shoves
text: the phone in, and leaves.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: (after him) I don’t know who that’s
dialog: supposed to be hurting!
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY
text: Joe watches as his friend ANGELO, 14, sticks a large
text: FIRECRACKER into a mailbox. Angelo turns to flee.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: ANGELO
dialog: Come on come on come on!
text: They run across the street and hide behind some shrubs. A
text: nebbishy kid, AARON (also 14), waits for them there.
text: They stare at the mailbox. Nothing happens.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Did it light?
text: The mailbox EXPLODES.
speaker_heading: ANGELO / AARON
dialog: Ha! Got you. / Remarkable.
text: An INDIAN GUY, 30s, comes out and immediately spots the boys.
speaker_heading: INDIAN GUY
dialog: We tired of this game yet?
speaker_heading: ANGELO
dialog: Not till you learn English, dot-
dialog: head!
speaker_heading: INDIAN GUY
dialog: Huh?? I have a double masters from
dialog: Georgetown. Your father cleans
dialog: pools.
speaker_heading: ANGELO
dialog: Go home!
text: In the background, a storm door opens on one of the houses.
text: A little old Italian lady pokes her head out. Angelo’S MOM.
speaker_heading: ANGELO’S MOM
dialog: Angelo! Venire all'interno e
dialog: spostare vestiti!
speaker_heading: ANGELO
dialog: Essere di destra 1a!
text: She retreats inside.
speaker_heading: ANGELO (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit. I gotta go shift the wash.
dialog: (to Indian guy)
dialog: Fuck you, Mola Ram!!
speaker_heading: INDIAN GUY
dialog: What?!
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I’m out too. Thirsty Thursdays.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh God. You’re going to that?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Of course. Everyone’s going.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Not me. My goddam shit-eating
dialog: father won’t let me.
dialog: (then)
dialog: And Kelly invited me too.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: So what, Kelly invited you. She's
dialog: got a boyfriend. Who’s twice your
dialog: size.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Right. The cave troll. What’s his
dialog: name again? Ju’tuun?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Paul. I can’t believe that guy is
text: seventeen years old. He looks like
dialog: he works for Con Ed.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Well no big deal, man. There will
dialog: be other...best times of your life.
scene_heading: INT. JOE’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Game night. Lisa, Frank and Joe sit around a monopoly board,
text: joined by COLIN, 19, bookish; and CAROL, 40, far too good for
dialog: this situation.
text: Joe sits slumped, miserable.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Carol, the lamb was delicious. Very
dialog: tender. It felt like I was chewing
dialog: avocado meat.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Thanks Colin. I boil it first.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I thought you might have. I didn’t
dialog: want to presume.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Colin, no one knows what you're
dialog: talking about.
text: Carol ROLLS. Marvin Gardens.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Meh. Pass.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Passing on Marvin Gardens? Ballsy.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Well look at this. I’m broke.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You pissed it all away on purples.
dialog: (going through her cards)
dialog: What the hell is this, Virginia?
dialog: If you’re gonna rely on colors, go
text: red, orange, yellow. Strong
text: colors. They attract the eye.
dialog: People want to land there. They
dialog: will themselves to.
speaker_heading: COLIN
text: Royal blue. Also a fierce color.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Colin, again, we’re unclear as to
dialog: what you’re saying.
text: Joe sits up.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Don’t listen to this clown. His
dialog: whole game is railroads. He’s got
text: blinders on to the world.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Who’s “he”? I’m right here.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Blinders.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: People need transportation, Joe.
dialog: They need to get from A to B.
text: Joe points his hands out from his temples: Blinders.
dialog: He does.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Just roll, Frank.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Lisa, do you remember when you
dialog: bought B&O and wouldn’t trade him,
dialog: and he quit?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I didn't “quit.” I just wasn’t
dialog: having fun anymore. Why would I
dialog: play if I’m not having fun? What’s
dialog: the point of a game? People play
dialog: games to heighten life, to forget
dialog: themselves.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: That's beautiful.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Shut the fuck up, Colin.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Is that true, Frank? You actually
dialog: quit Monopoly? How old are you?
text: Frank tenses up, uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh yeah, he always quits. He once
dialog: quit because Lisa hit free parking
dialog: six times.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Any sane person would have walked
dialog: away from that game. Something
dialog: wasn’t right and you goddam know
dialog: it.
text: Carol laughs, and Joe joins her. Frank shoots Joe a look.
text: Joe shoots one back, relishing the moment of comeuppance.
text: Frank moves his gamepiece.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: I will absolutely buy that...
dialog: (counting out money)
dialog: Hello Colin.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Do you want to be my friend?
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Very badly, sir.
text: Joe watches this exchange, not trusting it.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Okay then. Right now -- Tennessee
dialog: and St. James. I'’11 give you Park
dialog: Place and Indiana.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Whoa whoa whoa whoa--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Let the men talk, Joseph.
text: On Joe: fuming.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Yes. Clearly, yes I would do that.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Frank, that makes no sense. He’ll
dialog: kill us all.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: There will be collateral damage,
dialog: yes. But war is hell.
text: Joe looks at the board -- he sees what’s happening. His
text: piece is in jail. Frank’s building on orange. It’s a setup.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: He’s pricing me out...
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (big smile)
dialog: Your roll, Joey Joe-Joe.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: This is bullshit, Dad! You're
dialog: pricing me out of the goddam game!
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: (eyeing board) Oh man...he is.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Oh come on Frank. He’s your son.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You can’t do that Dad! It’s
dialog: collusion.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I can do whatever I want, Joe. My
dialog: house, my rules.
text: Frank lights a cigar and leans back. A suburban Bugsy. He
text: smiles at Joe, rubbing it in. Joe’s lip quivers, but he
text: tries not to break, tries not to give Frank the satisfaction.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Let’s just have a fun game. No?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hey, I’m not the one who started
dialog: telling fun little, funny little
dialog: stories. He’s just mad because he
dialog: doesn’t want to be here, so he’s
dialog: being a shit.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Roll the die, Joe. Let’s see what
dialog: happens. If you need a loan, maybe
dialog: we can work something out at a fair
dialog: interest rate.
text: A tense, miserable beat of silence. Then Joe rises, heads
dialog: for the kitchen.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: That was a cruel thing to do,
dialog: Frank.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Is he quitting?
scene_heading: INT. JOE’S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: Joe, red-faced, picks up the wall phone.
text: INSERT - A switchboard operator picks up.

speaker_heading: OPERATOR
dialog: 911, what is your emergency?
scene_heading: BACK IN JOE’S HOUSE:
text: Frank knows what’s happening.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Ah shit -- he’s doing it!
text: Frank darts at Joe, but Joe runs into the bathroom and locks
text: the door.
scene_heading: INT. JOE’S BATHROOM —- CONTINUOUS
text: Joe sits on the toilet, covering his ear.
speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: FRANK'S VOICE
dialog: Hang it up Joe!
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: 28 Rye Avenue. No, he’s actually
dialog: in the house right now...
text: Loud BANGING as Frank attempts to break the door down. Joe
text: moves toward the corner of the room.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: His name is Frank Toy, brown
dialog: hair...height unknown...He’s
dialog: obsessed with railroads...
text: The door SPLINTERS.
scene_heading: INT. JOE’S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Through Joe’s window, we see Frank talking to two police
text: officers. He holds the Monopoly board and makes desperate,
text: animated gestures. The officers nod.
text: Move back to reveal Joe, watching, holding a flashlight. The
text: room is dark.
dialog: 17.
text: He shines the flashlight in short spurts out the window. Dot-—
dialog: dot-dot, dash-dash-dash, dot-dot-dot...
text: After a few beats, we hear THUMPING from outside. Feet
text: climbing stairs.
text: Frank opens the door.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Stop signaling.
text: Joe shines the flashlight beam into Franks’s eyes. Frank
text: squints and shuts the door.
text: Joe lies on the bed, miserable. He spins something around
text: between his thumb and forefinger. Flashlight on: a small
text: green MONOPOLY HOUSE. He looks at it, then past it, and
text: freezes...something caught his eye.
text: The wall across from him: Though we notice an “Excalibur”
text: poster and other assorted nerd items, Joe’s focus is on the
text: huge SHADOW being cast by the monopoly house. Joe regards
dialog: this “house” shape...
text: Then shines the flashlight across the room, illuminating the
text: TOOLBOX sitting atop his dresser.
dialog: Beat on Joe, thinking...
scene_heading: INT. SPANISH CLASS - DAY
text: Patrick enters on his boot, carrying a team duffel bag. The
text: teacher conducts the class to recite the words on the board:
speaker_heading: ENTIRE CLASS
dialog: Recepcidn detrds, Patrick!
text: They applaud. Patrick smiles through the awkwardness.
scene_heading: INT. SPANISH CLASS - LATER

speaker_heading: TEACHER'S VOICE

speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: (with the class)
dialog: Algunos perros son marrén, algunos
dialog: perros son negro, algunos --
dialog: 18.
text: The sound of KNOCKING breaks his concentration -- Joe's
text: outside, at the window. Behind him, a scrawny, olive-skinned
text: kid sits on a bicycle: BIAGGIO, 14, quiet but dedicated.
text: Joe makes a “come here” motion. Patrick turns his palms
text: upward in a gesture of powerlessness.
scene_heading: EXT. SPANISH CLASS WINDOW - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (mouthing the words) Come outside
dialog: for a second.
text: A stern Patrick points to his desk, then points to the front
dialog: of the classroom.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: (mouthing) Come on. One second.
text: Patrick writes something on loose leaf and presses it against
dialog: the window. It says “I am in school right now”
scene_heading: INT. SPANISH CLASS - CONTINUOUS
text: Joe and Biaggio sit on the window ledge. Patrick sees from
text: the corner of his eye, then shakes his head. Joe takes a
text: sandwich out of his bag, prepared to wait it out.
speaker_heading: TEACHER'S VOICE
dialog: Patrick, éCémo viejo es tu perro?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: (caught off guard) Um, no tengo un

speaker_heading: TEACHER’S VOICE

text: A black kid behind Patrick picks his head up.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY

speaker_heading: TEACHER’S VOICE
dialog: Because of what you are!

scene_heading: EXT. TOTTENVILLE HIGH SCHOOL, COURTYARD - AFTERNOON
text: Patrick walks across the street with Joe.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Don’t do that shit anymore. You're
dialog: gonna get me in trouble.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I would get detention, not you.
dialog: You did nothing wrong.
text: A car full of students drives by. A kid hanging out the
text: window hollers “McGuire!” Patrick absently waves.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: How do you never get caught? What
dialog: about the truant officer?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yeah, the truant officer. He’s
dialog: fucking 19. I'11 shit in his

text: Cutaway to a baby faced Cop-in-a-Box idling on the curb.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)

scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - AFTERNOON

speaker_heading: PATRICK

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: We’re almost there. Fifty more

speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Almost where? What’s happening
dialog: right now??
dialog: 20.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS, CLEARING - MOMENTS LATER
text: The come to a large, treeless area. No civilization in

text: stretched his arms, like “welcome.”
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Do you want your room facing
dialog: sunrise, or the sunset?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Our new house. No, “home.” We’re
dialog: building a home on this very spot.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: What, like a tree-house?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No, like a living-house -- I’m

text: Biaggio thrusts a shovel toward Patrick.
speaker_heading: PATRICK

dialog: student?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: He’s been in our class since the
dialog: 4th grade. (beat) We’ll get to
dialog: him later man - are you in?
text: Patrick rubs his eyes. Joe isn’t kidding.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: You're serious about this.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Of course I’m serious. Look, you
dialog: can’t live with your parents, I
dialog: certainly can’t live with Shit-Ass
dialog: Frank any more. If we do this we
dialog: can make our own rules, make our
dialog: own choices! Live and die by our
dialog: wits, like men! What do we need?
dialog: A few 2x10s and a foundation?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: It’s not that simple, Joe.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It is, man. With my mind, and your
dialog: hands, we can pull this off. We’re
text: preternaturally skilled craftsmen.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Joe, we almost built a ramp, and I
dialog: got a 92 in Shop. That doesn’t
dialog: mean we can build a house!
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Come on man. Break ground with me.
dialog: You’re my best friend.
text: Biaggio looks at Joe, crestfallen.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Biaggio)
dialog: Don’t take that to heart Biaggio.
dialog: Who knows what the future holds.
dialog: (to Patrick)
dialog: Well?
text: Patrick takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Look, I won’t tell anyone what
dialog: you're doing, I promise. But this
dialog: is insane. You know that, right?
dialog: Joe's last resort:
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It’s this or the hives, man.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I’1l see you later.
dialog: 22.
text: Patrick boots off into the forest.
scene_heading: INT. PATRICK'S KITCHEN TABLE - NIGHT
text: Patrick jams him palm into a Heinz bottle, drizzling ketchup
text: on a burger. Mom and Dad sit on either side.
scene_heading: MRS. MCGUIRE
dialog: I got the chop chuck from DeMonte’s
dialog: instead of King Kullen. So the
dialog: hamburgers might taste a little
dialog: different. But they might taste
dialog: the same. It’s fun to try new
dialog: things, though.
speaker_heading: MR. MCGUIRE
dialog: (to Patrick)
dialog: What did Coach Locke say when he
dialog: saw you?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Nothing. He just said he was glad
dialog: to have me back.
speaker_heading: MR. MCGUIRE
dialog: I saw your sub play last Thursday.
dialog: “Moscato,” they called him.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Yes. That’s his last name.
speaker_heading: MR. MCGUIRE
dialog: I didn’t like him. He had a weak
dialog: chin.
dialog: (looking at Patrick’s
dialog: plate)
dialog: You do that often? You eat the
dialog: hamburger, then the fries? You
dialog: don’t mix it up?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I don’t know. Sometimes.
scene_heading: MRS. MCGUIRE
dialog: Patrick, have you heard about this
dialog: Die Hard movie? Die Hard 5? It’s
text: set in outer space.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Huh?
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: MR. MCGUIRE
dialog: Mmm...It’s not a Die Hard movie. I
dialog: think it’s called Festival
dialog: something.
scene_heading: MRS. MCGUIRE
dialog: Yes, that’s the one -- Festival.
text: Bruce Die Hard is in it, though.
dialog: Are you gonna go see Festival with
dialog: your friends?
speaker_heading: MR. MCGUIRE
dialog: “Festival.”
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Are you talking about “The Fifth
dialog: Element”??
scene_heading: MRS. MCGUIRE
dialog: Right! The Elements. It looks very
dialog: impressive. Tell us how it is.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Did I say I was seeing it? I have
dialog: no interest in it.
scene_heading: MRS. MCGUIRE
dialog: Yes, it's with Bruce Element, and
dialog: the other one, who’s the bad guy?
dialog: He’s been in a lot, he's very good.
dialog: “Samuel Clemens.”
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: His name is not Samuel Clemens.
scene_heading: MRS. MCGUIRE
dialog: Well the actor, not the character.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: (rubs his eyes)
dialog: I know what you mean. Samuel
dialog: Clemens is Mark Twain's pen name.
dialog: The actor is Gary Oldman.
scene_heading: MRS. MCGUIRE
dialog: Mm...no, that doesn't sound right.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Well maybe you guys should go see
dialog: it! Treat yourselves. Get out of
text: the house for a night.
dialog: 24.
scene_heading: MRS. MCGUIRE
dialog: Maybe we will.
speaker_heading: MR. MCGUIRE
dialog: (re: Patrick's food)
text: The flavors compliment each other,
dialog: if you wanted to do some of one,
text: then some of the other.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: (agitated)
dialog: I know, Dad.
scene_heading: MRS. MCGUIRE
dialog: Your Aunt Janette is coming Friday
dialog: afternoon, Patrick. I told her
dialog: you'll be around. I’m going to put
text: some cashews out.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I don’t have to call her ‘aunt’
dialog: anymore, right? I’m fourteen.
dialog: She’s of no blood relation. You
dialog: went to camp with her.
scene_heading: MRS. MCGUIRE
dialog: She loves you like an aunt, she
dialog: showers you with gifts.
speaker_heading: MR. MCGUIRE
dialog: She loves you, Patrick.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: She gets me weird things that I
dialog: don’t want. She got me a wood-
text: burning kit.
scene_heading: MRS. MCGUIRE
dialog: I know she did. And now it just
dialog: sits there. Too much goes to waste
dialog: in this world.
text: Patrick just shakes his head. He bites into his burger. Mr.
text: McGuire can’t stop staring at Patrick’s plate.
speaker_heading: MR. MCGUIRE
dialog: Is that a usual thing for you,
dialog: though?
dialog: (to wife)
text: He eats all of one food, and then
text: moves onto all of another food.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: So what?!
speaker_heading: MR. MCGUIRE
dialog: Come on. That’s how the blind eat.
dialog: We didn’t raise you to do that. To
dialog: be blind.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: (losing it)
dialog: But how does it affect you?? Why
dialog: comment on it??
text: Out of nowhere, Mom starts WHISTLING.
scene_heading: MRS. MCGUIRE
dialog: Can you whistle? Can you whistle,
dialog: Patrick? I have to breath in to do
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MR. MCGUIRE
dialog: No no no. You’re supposed to breath
text: out. Let the diaphragm support it.
text: They both whistle out of key with one another. Patrick loses
text: some color in his face and starts breathing erratically.
scene_heading: INT. JOE'S BEDROOM/PATRICK’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: The phone RINGS. Joe answers right away.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Hello?
dialog: Cut to Patrick’s (intercut between rooms as needed). He’s
text: standing in front of a full length mirror, covered in HIVES.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I’m in.
speaker_heading: JOE'S VOICE
dialog: What? Huh?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I’m in, I said. The house. I'11
dialog: do it.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (grinning) Fuckin...yes! Awesome
dialog: man...okay, we break ground

speaker_heading: PATRICK

speaker_heading: JOE'S VOICE
dialog: Eleven’s fine.
scene_heading: INT. KELLY’S ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING
text: Kelly sits on her bed listening to a CD. A KNOCK on her

speaker_heading: KELLY’S MOM
text: Kel -- Vicki's coming up.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Okay.
text: The best friend, VICKI (15) enters. Dark hair, dark soul.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: You’re not gonna believe this.
text: She hands Kelly a magazine.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: ‘Architectural Digest.’ So?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Turn to page 23.
text: Kelly turns. We see a feature on JOE, standing before his
text: pristine new House in the Woods.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Oh my God! Joe Toy??
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: He built that house with his bare
dialog: hands.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Wait -- he built this??
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Well, Patrick and Biaggio helped
dialog: with parts and labor, but the whole
dialog: thing was Joe’s baby. God, a guy
dialog: who can work with his hands...
dialog: that’s the ultimate.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (reading) It’s got a game room...
dialog: and a botanical garden...and a lazy
dialog: river!
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Ugh. He must be rich.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Rich, or just brilliant. And
dialog: crafty as hell.
text: Tight on Kelly, lost in the article.
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D)
dialog: I can’t believe a man like this has
dialog: been under my nose for a whole
dialog: year.
text: We hear more KNOCKING. It seems to come from far away...
scene_heading: SOUNDBRIDGE TO:
scene_heading: INT. JOE’S SHOWER - REAL LIFE, 10AM
text: The knocking snaps Joe out of his DAYDREAM. He’s showering.

speaker_heading: FRANK'S VOICE
dialog: Joe! You’ve been in there for
dialog: fifty-five minutes!
scene_heading: INT. JOE’S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Frank waits outside the door, messy and unshaven. The water

scene_heading: INT. JOE’S BATHROOM —- CONTINUOUS
text: Joe brushes his teeth. He shoots a contemptuous glance at
text: the door.
speaker_heading: FRANK'S VOICE
dialog: Let’s go. I have a tee time.
scene_heading: INT. JOE'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Frank knocks again.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You have to talk to me eventually,
dialog: Joe.
text: Silence. After a beat, Joe runs out, naked and still soaked.
text: His hands are cupped over his genitals.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
text: (averting his eyes) Jesus.
text: As Joe scampers into his room:
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: You’ve gotta bring underwear in
dialog: with you, Joe! You're 14 years
dialog: old! It’s not cute anymore!
scene_heading: EXT. JOE’S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
text: Bird's eye of Joe bursting out of his side gate on his bike.
text: We move up and over the rooftops, heading past subdivisions,
text: strip malls, until the woods appear in the distance. We move
text: in until treetops fill the frame. We linger on the dense
text: green tableau. It could be anywhere in the world.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS, SITE OF HOUSE - MUCH LATER
text: Patrick, Joe and Biaggio stand in a large rectangular hole in
text: the earth, DIGGING. Judging by the stains and general
text: demeanor, the fun part is over. We hear grunts, wheezing.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (to Biaggio) Did you talk to your
dialog: father about concrete?
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: He says it’s impossible, and he
dialog: says if I ask again he’s going to
dialog: throw my binder in the garbage.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: (stops shoveling) Well shit man,
dialog: where does that leave us?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Relax, we’ll think of a substitute.
dialog: We could use sod, we could use
dialog: clay, we--
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: This isn’t the fucking French Open,
dialog: Joe! We need a concrete
dialog: foundation. That’s like rule one.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: We could use dirt. Pack it hard.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: You want to fill this hole with
dialog: dirt?
text: Biaggio shrugs. Patrick throws his shovel and climbs out of
dialog: the hole.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Where are you going? Relax man!
dialog: This is a flawed process.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: (climbing) No shit. Call me when
dialog: you have some idea what’s going on.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: C'mon, keep your eye on the prize
dialog: here! We need you, Tum Tum!
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: And we're not using nicknames from
dialog: “Three Ninjas,” either.
text: Patrick is gone. Biaggio starts after him, but Joe stops
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Let him go, Colt.
scene_heading: INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - LATER
text: Joe walks in, utterly filthy. The door chimes. Guy behind
dialog: the counter:
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: Not cool, guys. I just had the
text: floors buffed yesterday.
text: By the refrigerators, Patrick, also very filthy, browses soft
text: drinks. Joe approaches.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: How can I make you happy here?
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: (hands Joe a Snapple) First, you’re
dialog: gonna buy me a Guava Mania.
dialog: Second, I want you to make a
dialog: fucking plan! Read a book!
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Hey man, I never said it would be
dialog: easy, I just said it would be worth
dialog: it. Good things come to those who
dialog: wait. Friends are the best
dialog: therapy.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I’ve been to your house, asshole!
dialog: Those are your refrigerator
text: magnets.
text: Patrick moves up an aisle. Joe follows.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Fine. I'11 do some research, okay?
dialog: We both will.
text: Patrick hands Joe a box of frozen waffles.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: These are coming too. (back on
dialog: subject) I’ve done the research,
dialog: Joe! Did you know that pine cones
dialog: are a legitimate source of fiber?
dialog: That the red baneberry is edible,
dialog: but the white one is deadly? That
dialog: skunk spray can blind you? No, you
dialog: didn’t.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (sigh) Yes, fine, you know things.
dialog: But no one learns as much from
dialog: books as they do from actual real
dialog: life, okay? You can bring a
dialog: fucking meat thermometer and your
dialog: Cub Scout manual if you want, but
dialog: at some point we’re gonna have to
dialog: dick up and trust our instincts..
scene_heading: ATTENDANT’S VOICE
dialog: Yo! Out of the store! Not gonna
dialog: say it again!
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: (ignoring attendant) Joe, all I'm
dialog: saying is, let’s do this right.
speaker_heading: (MORE )

speaker_heading: PATRICK (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m not in the mood for another Joe
dialog: Toy disaster.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Fine, yes, agreed. That’s all I’m
dialog: saying too. (beat) So you’re still
dialog: on board?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Look at me. I’m on board.
text: Joe exhales, relieved. Patrick throws a bag of pork rinds on

speaker_heading: PATRICK (CONT'D)
dialog: These too.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Wow. You’re a class act.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: MONTAGE. MUSIC CUE: “WHITE WINTER HYMNAL” by FLEET FOXES
text: Joe plucks books from LIBRARY SHELVES. He stacks them on the
scene_heading: checkout counter: “WALDEN.” “105 OUTDOOR RECIPES.” “SO, YOU
dialog: WANT TO BUILD A CABIN.”
text: Blueprints unroll. Reveal Joe, Patrick and Biaggio reviewing
text: them in an empty classroom. It feels like a war room.
text: In the woods, Joe and Biaggio dump piles of timber next to
text: Patrick, who ties them together with small vines. They are a
text: symphony of sweat and grime.
text: Joe and Biaggio watch as Patrick confidently bites into an
text: herb. There’s an open reference book in Patrick’s hand.
text: Joe stacks more books at the library counter: “SELF RELIANCE
text: AND OTHER ESSAYS.” Then, the following comic books: “SPAWN,”
scene_heading: “BATMAN VS. PREDATOR,” “SUPERMAN: CAMELOT FALLS.” Then
text: another reference book, “I'D RATHER BE HUNTING.”
text: Patrick messes around with some dry twigs and flint, trying
text: to get a spark. Once he does, he blows on it - FIRE.
text: On a suburban street, Biaggio halts his bike, seeing
text: something. Swoosh pan to a sofa left on the curb as trash.
text: Biaggio and Joe set the sofa on a lumpy wood floor -- the
text: house in the woods. One wall has been erected.
text: On his stoop, Patrick picks leaves, twigs off his jeans and
text: scatters them in the garden. He keeps an eye on the door.
dialog: 32.
text: Joe sits on the toilet, reading his Superman comic.
text: Biaggio rides his bike through an affluent neighborhood. He
text: stops and looks off camera, in awe of something...
text: Joe and Biaggio, guided by Patrick, carry an enormous POOL
text: SLIDE, ladder included. As the inch closer to the “house,”
text: we see that three walls have been erected, and there is more
text: garbage furniture than before. It’s getting there.
text: Joe emerges from a thick bit of trees and finds himself atop
text: a decent sized cliff, maybe seventy feet high. Out in front
text: of him, treetops stretch for miles. He inhales.
scene_heading: END MONTAGE.
scene_heading: INT. TOTTENVILLE HIGH SCHOOL, CAFETERIA - DAY
text: Joe and Patrick sit at an empty lunch table, drinking plastic
dialog: quarter drinks.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: What are we gonna do about parents?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Well I’m not leaving a note or
dialog: anything. I’m gonna let him stew
text: in it for a while.
text: Patrick makes a face, reacting to Joe’s harshness.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: What happened in your house the
dialog: other night anyway, man?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Nothing. He’s just...it’s like the
dialog: chicken or the egg with my Dad. I
dialog: don’t know if he’s alone because
dialog: he’s a dick, or if he’s a dick
text: because he’s alone. But either way
dialog: he’s a dick. And he’s alone.
text: He sighs.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s scary.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Yeah it is...what if I wound up
dialog: like my Dad. Jesus -- what if I
dialog: wound up like my Mom??
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: JOE
text: She’s a strange bird.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I had a dream like maybe two days
dialog: ago that she took a Polaroid of me
dialog: on the toilet, and then ate it
dialog: before it could develop.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oof. I feel like that’s dense with
dialog: meaning.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Yeah.
text: Patrick chugs a purple quarter drink.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I had a dream that I could talk to
dialog: reef sharks.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: What did the sharks say?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: They didn’t speak so much as rap.
text: Joe drinks. Patrick gazes across the lunchroom.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: (sentimental)
dialog: I‘ll miss this stuff a little.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yeah, a little.
speaker_heading: Joe's POV:
text: A table across the room. A bunch of girls in matching T-

scene_heading: EXT. PATRICK'S STREET - NIGHT
dialog: To establish.
scene_heading: INT. PATRICK'S ROOM - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. JOE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Joe's beeper goes off. He silences it, then moves to his
text: closet. He takes out two overstuffed DUFFEL BAGS.
scene_heading: INT. PATRICK’S PARENTS’ ROOM - NIGHT
text: Patrick watches his folks sleep. The house feels like a warm,
text: safe place right now -- now that he’s leaving.
text: He kisses his hand, and touches the door, but remains

scene_heading: INT. JOE’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Frank sleeps on the sofa, lit by blue light from the TV.
text: Joe observes with narrow eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. MOUTH OF THE WOODS - NIGHT
text: Joe walks his bike into the woods, but Patrick stares back in
text: the direction they came, hesitant.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You coming?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Yeah...This is happening, huh?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yeah. It is.

speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I’ve never done anything like this

dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (walks to his side)
dialog: Sometimes when I’m about to make a
dialog: big decision, I say “I will go
dialog: through with this unless God gives
dialog: me a very definite omen within the
dialog: next 30 seconds.” We could do
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Okay. Let’s do that.
text: They stand silent for the agreed interval, each in his own
text: thoughts. Then, a clap of THUNDER. Patrick furrows a brow.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Okay, time. Let’s go.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: That’s thunder, Joe.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yes, that’s thunder.
dialog: (points at shit)
dialog: That’s a tree, that’s a rock. It’s
dialog: nature. It’s not an omen.
text: He walks into the woods.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: C’mon.
text: Patrick steels himself.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Jesus. This is happening.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER
text: TORRENTIAL RAIN. The boys are soaked. The trees overhead
dialog: can only do so much.
text: They negotiate the path in silence. Patrick is not smiling.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS - NIGHT
text: They walk in. Snippets of the house are revealed in

text: makeshift wall...the water-slide in the room’s center...
dialog: 36.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS, “UPSTAIRS” - NIGHT

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I haven't heard from him in 3 days.

speaker_heading: PATRICK

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)

text: storm door with some bags packed. She hugs him.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Shhh. It’s okay. I’m sure he’s
dialog: fine.
text: Colin awkwardly rubs her back.
scene_heading: INT. JOE’S ROOM - LATER
text: Frank & Lisa search Joe’s room, go through doors, check the
text: closets.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We don’t know much. The thing
dialog: is...(pause) Some things are
dialog: missing. Things Joe might have
dialog: planned to take. All his clothes.
dialog: The Monopoly. The spare from the
dialog: Avalon.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: So...he ran away?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It’s still mostly guesswork, Li...
dialog: But yes, it looks that way.
text: Colin comes to the doorway.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: The Chinese food is here, Mr. Toy.
dialog: It's fifty-one dollars.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (digging into pocket) Fifty-one
dialog: dollars? What did you order Lisa!?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Nothing. I got dumplings. I’m not
dialog: hungry.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I got us a big order of shrimp with
dialog: lobster sauce. I figured it’s
dialog: neutral.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Neutral? Shrimp with lobster
dialog: sauce? I can’t think of a more
dialog: marginal dish in any culture.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I don’t know. I thought it was
dialog: neutral. I thought we could all
dialog: enjoy it.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Come on Colin, no one’s gonna eat
dialog: that! Now there’s gonna be a pint
dialog: of hot cum in my refrigerator for a
dialog: week. Use your head next time.
text: Colin takes the money and walks off.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Be nice to him, Dad. Please. He
dialog: wants to help.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Colin’s feelings are not a priority
dialog: right now. Sorry.
dialog: 40.
dialog: 4l.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: I know...but you don’t have to be
dialog: Mean, Daddy You just...
text: Lisa assigns blame as gently as possible.
speaker_heading: LISA (CONT'D)
dialog: You don’t have to always be so
dialog: mean. You know?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Am I mean to you?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: No. But I’m like the only one,
dialog: Dad.
text: Frank contemplates this.
scene_heading: EXT. TOTTENVILLE HIGH SCHOOL, COURTYARD - DAY
text: A few students pause to acknowledge...
text: A MISSING CHILD poster. It’s a collage of three pictures:
text: Patrick in his wrestling gear; Patrick posing with his
text: parents in front of the globe at EPCOT; Patrick’s tasteful
dialog: class photo.
text: Off an image of Patrick’s INNOCENT FACE:
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS, WATERING HOLE - DAY
text: Patrick pulls his new, BEARDED face out of the fresh water.
text: Reveal him sitting at the edge of a pond.
speaker_heading: JOE'S VOICE
dialog: Patrick!
text: He looks -- Joe and Biaggio stand on a high rock, holding a
text: tire attached to a rope. Joe has also grown wispy facial
text: hair. Biaggio wears a swimming cap and underwear.
text: Joe swings. He lets go at the top of his arc and cannonballs
text: into the water. As he emerges:
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Ehhh...six.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (genuine disappointment)
dialog: Six...Godammit.
text: Joe swings the tire back up to Biaggio.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Why does he have a swimming cap,
dialog: but no bathing suit?
dialog: 42.
text: Biaggio clutches the tire and surveys the stream, nervous.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (cups hands to mouth)
dialog: Biaggio, just let go when you get
dialog: to the top! It’s not even deep!
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Look at this. He’s terrified.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I know. He once told me he’s only
dialog: afraid of two things -- drowning,
dialog: werewolves, very old music, and
dialog: homeless women who can run or jump.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: That’s four things.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I’m telling you exactly what he
dialog: told me.
text: Biaggio swings, all four limbs wrapped around the tire.
dialog: At
text: the top of his swing, he does nothing, paralzed with fear.
text: He swings back and forth, losing momentum.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: What are you, a cat? Let go!
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: We're here Biaggio! We won't let
dialog: the river claim you!
text: Biaggio drops his legs. They enter the water at the knee.
text: His hands are still fused to the tire. He hangs there.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay...we’re sort of in no man’s
dialog: land here, Biaggio! Just make a
dialog: decision! We want to use the tire!
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Just untie it.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Did you hear that, Biaggio? I’m
dialog: giving you one more chance to do
dialog: this on your terms!
text: Biaggio lets go and falls awkwardly into the stream.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Six.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Bullshit!
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS, UPSTAIRS - LATER
text: Patrick stands in front of a beat-up mirror, shirtless...
text: His hives are gone.
text: He breathes deep, flexes, grins. He feels like himself.
text: Then, ending his moment of serenity:
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yo. We have a food situation.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS, DOWNSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS
text: Joe gets downstairs via the WATER SLIDE from earlier. As he
text: walks through the house, we reveal it in its entirety:
text: The water slide leads up to a “loft” area (just a huge ledge)
text: where the guys sleep. Downstairs, we recognize some garbage
text: furniture from earlier scenes -- a sofa, a lamp. There’s now
text: a dining room: an AIR HOCKEY TABLE.
text: As Patrick and Joe approach this corner, Biaggio leans over
text: the table counting grains of rice.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (to Patrick) No more rice. And no
dialog: more pasta. It’s time.
text: Joe starts rummaging through a pile of supplies, emerging
text: with a souvenir SWORD.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: What kind of game are we dealing
dialog: with?
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Deer, pheasant, rabbit. You might
text: run into a lynx.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Any bison? Cougar? Anything real?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: You’re gonna kill a buffalo with a
dialog: sword you got from a gift shop in
dialog: Colonial Williamsburg?
speaker_heading: JOE
text: It’s not the size of the blade, but
text: the will of the swordsman.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: (rolls eyes)
dialog: You gotta stop with that elf shit,
dialog: man.
text: Joe re-sheathes his weapon.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Okay. Biaggio and I will hunt.
dialog: You gather.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Then...here, take these.
text: Patrick hands Joe and Biaggio small cardboard MASKS with
text: crude FACES drawn on them in magic marker.
text: Patrick wears his, but on the BACK OF HIS HEAD.
speaker_heading: PATRICK (CONT'D)
dialog: (pointing to it)
dialog: It's so animals don’t pounce on you
text: from behind.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (regarding masks)
dialog: This one’s supposed to be me?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Whatever man. I wasn’t going for
dialog: accuracy.
text: Joe puts his on.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: So an animal will see this and
dialog: think I’m looking at him, and
dialog: walking backwards, and that all my
text: joints are backwards.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: It works, Joe. Nigerian bushmen
dialog: have been doing it for centuries.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Right, Nigerian bushmen. And we
dialog: all know how great they turned out.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: What does that mean?
text: Joe turns around with his mask on. Then he sticks his hand
text: out behind him, toward Patrick, as if offering a handshake.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Hey, nice to meet you. I’m Joe.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Fuck yourself.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DAY
dialog: Wide shot, to establish.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DAY
text: Patrick holds open a field guide, checking the bunch of red
text: berries before him against an illustration.
text: He plucks them, bites into one for confirmation...then tosses
text: the bunch into a bucket with other berries, roots, herbs.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DAY
text: Joe carries his sword, Biaggio his machete. They look like
dialog: little murderers.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I want to thank you for helping us,
dialog: Biaggio. A lot of people would
dialog: have just stayed in the comfort of
dialog: their homes.
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: This is life experience. Both my
dialog: grandfathers went to war. My
dialog: father lived among the bees. This
dialog: is what I’1l have done.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Exactly! It’s our rite of passage,
dialog: goddamit.
dialog: (deep, satisfied breath)
dialog: I mean have you ever felt this at
dialog: one with the natural world, with
dialog: your instincts? This masculine?
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: I don’t know. I don’t really see
dialog: myself as “having a gender.”
dialog: (then)
dialog: Is that bad?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I mean, it’s not great.
text: The boys duck through a thick, gnarly patch of brush...
text: To find CIVILIZATION. The woods have ended. They stare at a
text: strip mall across the street. A BOSTON MARKET looms, the
text: crown jewel of the shopping center.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: (staring)
dialog: Is it real?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yes, it is...
dialog: (then)
dialog: Let’s go. We’re moving on.
text: Biaggio is still entranced.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: The 1/4 dark is very good, though.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Sure it is. You don’t think I know
dialog: that? It falls off the goddam
dialog: bone. But Boston Market, that’s
dialog: not roughing it, that’s not living
dialog: by our wits. That’s not the man’s
dialog: code, the code of the forest.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: One day, maybe.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yes, sure, one day. C’mon man,
dialog: this was a test, and we passed.
text: JOE'S POV: a B.M. employee throws garbage in a side dumpster.
text: Close on Joe as he gets an idea.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hmm...hold my weapon, Biaggio...
text: Joe darts across the street. A moving car WIPES THE FRAME:
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - LATER
text: A nearly-clean chicken skeleton falls to the ground.
speaker_heading: JOE'S VOICE
dialog: Cut it right here.
text: Reveal Joe and Biaggio rigging a TRAP:
text: The chicken is tied to a stick, which props up an overturned
text: WHEELBARROW. In theory, it should work.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Look at this bait, man.
text: Biaggio looks at the chicken carcass. Flies buzz around it.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: Are there bears in these woods?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I hope to God there are. A bear
dialog: would feed us for a month...
text: Joe looks at the wheelbarrow.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: He'd be too big for the trap...but
dialog: I think we could at least
text: disillusion him. A bear who
dialog: doesn’t believe in anything is
dialog: easier to bring down.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: Have you ever eaten a bear steak?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (fiddling with the trap)
dialog: No. You?
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: Once. At my sister’s communion.
text: Joe flicks the line.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Well it’s just a waiting game now,
dialog: my friend.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DAY
text: Patrick shakes the shit out of an APPLE TREE. Granny smiths
text: rain down. He bends to pick one up, and something catches
dialog: his eye...
text: He grabs a twig and pokes at the ground, finally lifting a
dialog: very long, very appalling
speaker_heading: SNAKESKIN
text: He regards it with fear and revulsion. Then chucks it into
dialog: the trees.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS
text: Joe and Biaggio play RUMMY, cards fanned out before them.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: Sometimes I wonder, we bury fruit
text: seeds, and new fruit grows. We
text: bury what is left, and it’s reborn.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: Could that not work with people?
dialog: Bury the remains, the vital organs,
dialog: and a new one might grow?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I don’t think it’s a bad theory,
dialog: but we've been burying the dead for
dialog: thousands of years, and that has
dialog: never happened.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: Hm; valid point.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Rummy.
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (inspecting)
dialog: You only have five cards here.
text: Sudden SOUNDS OF A STRUGGLE from the woods behind them. The
text: trap is sprung.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit! Yes! Come on!
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS, TRAP - CONTINUOUS
text: We hear awful SCRATCHING and SQUEALING from inside. They
text: approach, sick with fear.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (sword at the ready)
dialog: Okay, turn the thing.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: Turn the thing...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yeah just turn the wheelbarrow.
dialog: Just, you know..flip it, and I, uh,
dialog: will take its life.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: Okay.
dialog: (moves to wheelbarrow)
dialog: Strike at the neck. Don’t
dialog: compromise the meat.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I know...I know...
text: Biaggio puts his hands on the wheelbarrow.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: You want this on your hands?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What choice do we have?! We need
dialog: to eat goddammit...
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: It may plead. Don’t listen. Be
text: cold, clinical with the blade.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Okay, okay.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: It may try to bargain. This is
dialog: natural. You must--
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Turn the fucking thing over!
text: He does: A huge pink and white POSSUM, likely rabid, hisses
text: at Joe. The boys SCREAM.
text: INSERT: Wide above the forest. Their screams echo.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS, FIRE PIT - EVENING
text: Three whole roasted chickens sizzle on a SPIT, pulled over a
text: crackling fire.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I guess I’m surprised you found
text: live chicken in these woods.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Why should that be surprising?
dialog: Chicken outnumber people in this
dialog: world. You’re an educated guy, I
dialog: don’t need to tell you that.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Yeah, I just had never seen one in
dialog: Staten Island, New York before.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Well that’s crazy. There was a
dialog: time when you hadn’t seen me yet,
dialog: right? Did that mean I didn’t
dialog: exist?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I don’t even know what the fuck
dialog: we're talking about any more.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It doesn’t matter. Biaggio, your
dialog: creamed spinach is to die for.
text: Biaggio nods.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: You guys should know I found a
text: copperhead skin by the creek. It
dialog: definitely belonged to a mature
dialog: adult. In the event--
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: C’mon man. We’re having a nice
dialog: meal.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: This is important Joe!
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: There’s always something with you.
text: Some doom and gloom.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: It’s not doom and gloom, Joe, it’s
dialog: the reality of living in the goddam
dialog: forest, which was your idea to
dialog: begin with.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: The thing...it has venom?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Yes. Listen --
dialog: (to both)
dialog: If you see it, stay calm. They
dialog: respond to fear.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: I read once that animals see fear
dialog: as a color.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I thought you couldn’t read?
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: I can read. I can’t cry.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS, SCENIC OVERLOOK - SUNDOWN

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Doesn’t suck, does it.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: No. No it doesn’t.
dialog: Reverse to their POV: Trees. Stars. Peaceful. (We might
dialog: remember this view from the earlier montage)
text: Joe flips his BACKPACK around and unzips it.
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I was saving these...
text: He removes a SIX PACK.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: For the right moment.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: (happily accepting)
dialog: No shit.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yes shit.
text: They clank bottles and drink. Their first beer together.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ah...Do you feel it?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Feel what.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: We’re doing it, man. We have
dialog: shelter, water, the means to put
dialog: food on the table. We’re totally
dialog: self-reliant. We just grew up.
dialog: (then)
dialog: We're men now. Men.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Just now? It just happened?
speaker_heading: JOE
text: It happened man. Cheers.
text: Joe takes another pull. Patrick shakes his head, bemused.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Now all we need is the Ham.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: What’s the ‘ham?’
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: The Ham. You know, the Ham -- the
text: pussy.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: No, I don’t know “the ham, the
dialog: pussy.” Where the fuck did you get
dialog: that from?
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It’s in the culture.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: We're in the same culture. I’ve
dialog: never heard that.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: The Ham! We takin’ a ride in the
dialog: HAMbulance, to HAMsterdam! Uh!
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Are you done?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I am.
dialog: (swig)
dialog: I’m just saying, if something were
dialog: missing from this, that would be
dialog: it.
dialog: (then)
text: A woman’s touch.
text: He drinks, suddenly distant. We know who he’s thinking
dialog: about...
text: He hears a sqeak, and notices a SQUIRREL peering at him. He
text: reaches into his coat and tosses it a NUT, or some tasty
text: morsel. It grabs the nut and takes off.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS
text: The squirrel runs with its prize, over rocks and roots. It
text: pauses at the base of a tree and begins to nibble.
text: Suddenly, we hear HISSING, and the rustling of leaves. It
text: freezes...and turns to look.
scene_heading: EXT. AFFLUENT LONG ISLAND NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
text: A half-million dollar home. Chrysler New Yorker in the
text: driveway. Basketball hoop out front.
text: Frank stares at it, chewing gum nervously. He’s shaven,
dialog: pressed, more put together than we’ve ever seen.
text: He takes a deep breath, and goes halfway up the walk...then
text: doubles back toward his car.
dialog: 54.
scene_heading: INT. FRANK'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: He starts the engine. Then kills it.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Fuck you! Pussy.
scene_heading: EXT. MANSION - MOMENTS LATER
text: He rings the bell. Waits.
text: An attractive, middle-aged brunette answers. She’s taken
dialog: aback to see Frank there.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Clarissa.
scene_heading: INT. CLARISSA’S KITCHEN - DAY
text: They sit over coffee. Opposite sides of the table.
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: Had you guys been fighting?
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: He called 911 over a Monopoly game.
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: See, I don’t like that. That’s a
dialog: regression.
text: Twin 19 year-olds, JOSH and JAKE, enter and raid the fridge.
speaker_heading: JOSH
text: Ma, Denise is coming over later.
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: Fine. Just clean the basement.
text: Without provocation, Jake backhands his brother in the

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Dick'd ya!
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Oh! Dick’d ya!
text: Josh chases Jake into the living room. Clarissa sighs.
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I guess they don’t know.
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: No, they know.
dialog: (then)
dialog: So, what? The police came?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah, but it doesn’t...I mean, all
dialog: we do is fight, Clarissa.
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: Boys and their fathers clash,
dialog: Frank. It’s normal.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You didn’t get along with your
dialog: father for decades, right? And now
dialog: you love and respect him dearly.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah, because he’s dead.
dialog: (takes a sip)
dialog: Joe wasn’t always like this. This
dialog: angry, this moody.
text: Frank stirs his drink. Uncomfortable silence.
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: If you try to put this on me, the
text: conversation is over.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I’m not putting anything on you.
dialog: I’m just saying. He’s difficult.
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
text: Every teenager is moody.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah. One time we had a fight over
dialog: his grades. He told me my mother
dialog: “sucked cocks in hell.”
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: He did not say that.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Verbatim.
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: Hm...it’s from The Exorcist though.
dialog: It’s not his original thought.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I think we can agree it’s not the
dialog: number one thing to say about your
dialog: grandmother.
text: Silence. She can’t argue that.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m gonna say something, because it
dialog: has to be said. And you have to
dialog: hear it.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I think if you came back, Joe would
dialog: too. There it is.
text: Clarissa nods.
scene_heading: EXT. MANSION - MOMENTS LATER
text: Frank stands facing the door, as it slams. He stands there
dialog: for a beat.
scene_heading: EXT. TOTTENVILLE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

speaker_heading: JOE
speaker_heading: Psst!
dialog: No response.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: Psssst!

text: Joe picks up a rock and chucks it without aiming. It hits
text: Aaron just above the eye and ricochets out of frame.
text: Aaron moans and drops to one knee. He looks around, confused
text: and in pain, putting up a desperate hand to ward off further
dialog: attacks.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: shit.

text: over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Make yourself at home, man. You
dialog: thirsty? Hungry?
text: Joe reaches for the apple bowl, tosses one to Aaron.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Joe...how did you do this? How
dialog: long did it take?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: About ten days. It’s a pretty
text: simple structure. The roof is
dialog: plywood, it just rests there...you
dialog: could flap it open if you wanted
dialog: to...I handled schematics...Patrick
text: bound most of the walls together...
text: Joe looks around. A moment of pride for the accomplishment.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyway, it’s a start. Eventually
dialog: we'll add to it. We’re just still
dialog: getting used to the family dynamic.
dialog: But we have ideas for the place.

speaker_heading: AARON

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Please. My brother’s a fucking

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Whatever. I’11l be there. I have

text: Aaron sits at dinner with his brother ERIC, 23, a young man
text: with no sideburns.
text: Aaron’s MOM is at the stove.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Eric, can you give one of my
dialog: friends a ride to Wolf's?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: If he got gas money.
dialog: (to their mother)
dialog: Where’s meat?
speaker_heading: AARON’S MOM
dialog: This is beef stew. It’s a specific
dialog: type of meat. What have I said
dialog: about speaking in generalities?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Fine.
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: When’s man coming home?
speaker_heading: AARON’S MOM
dialog: Your father is in Atlantic City.
dialog: He is also a very specific type of
dialog: man, he is your Fa-Ther.
text: Aaron’s mom brings over a cauldron of beef stew.
speaker_heading: AARON’S MOM (CONT'D)
text: Now this is piping, piping hot,
dialog: alright? Don’t touch it for a good
dialog: ten minutes.
text: Eric immediately ladles a heaping portion into his plate.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: AARON’S MOM (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m not kidding, Eric. I know
dialog: you’re hungry, but look at it.
text: It’s still boiling.
text: Eric takes a bite and instantly spits it back into his plate
text: with a wet THUD. He exhales, and then lifts the food to his
text: mouth again.
speaker_heading: AARON’S MOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Fine. Burn your mouth for Easter.
scene_heading: EXT. BOSTON MARKET - NIGHT
text: Joe wears a hooded sweatshirt, a hat, shades. He paces,
text: fidgets. Like a wanted man.
text: Then, the sound of speakers rattling with too much bass. Joe
text: turns to see an ancient two-door CAMARO pull into the parking
dialog: lot. This is Eric’s princess.
scene_heading: INT. CAMARO - NIGHT
text: Joe and Aaron in back, Eric and some guido friend up front.
text: Obnoxious TECHNO music plays. Deafening.
scene_heading: EXT. WOLFE’S POND PARK - NIGHT
text: They walk down a path, walled in by tall grass. Distant
text: sounds of a party, and faint orange firelight. Joe and Aaron
text: lag behind the older guys.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: What if someone recognizes you?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: If anyone makes eye contact with
dialog: me, I’m gone. If they ask you, deny
dialog: everything.
scene_heading: EXT. WOLFE’S POND PARK, BEACH - NIGHT
text: They're at “Thirsty Thursdays,” a raging, lively keg. Music,
text: a bonfire, a huge keg line, teenagers grinding up on each
dialog: other. Fun.
text: Joe walks along the outer edge of the general party area,
text: keeping his head low, but taking it in. Shit, if his life
dialog: had been anything like this...
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - KEG
text: Kelly’s goth pal VICKI comes down from a keg-stand. The
text: guys holding her legs turn out to be Eric and his friend.
text: Vicki looks at Eric, who smiles like a creep.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - JOE
text: Joe hides behind someone’s pickup, scanning the scene...still
dialog: no sign of Kelly.
text: Suddenly he hears a SCREAM from behind him:
text: And there she is, by the water. She’s surrounded by dudes
text: with backwards hats. One of the guys has her around the
text: waist. They toss her, screaming, into the bay. Laughter.
text: She emerges, yelling and splashing at them.
text: Tight on Joe.
text: Suddenly, two hands land on Joe’s shoulders and whip him
text: around. A BLONDE KID is staring him in the face.
speaker_heading: BLONDE KID
dialog: Dude! Where you been??
text: He pulls the hood down, revealing Joe’s face. Joe’s eyes
text: dart around, but he’s trying to keep it cool.
speaker_heading: BLONDE KID (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, you’re not Doug. Sorry bro.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Uh, it’s okay. All good.
text: The kid stumbles away, wasted.
speaker_heading: BLONDE KID
dialog: Yeah man. My fault. Nice face
dialog: though...
text: Joe turns to look at himself in the car window, and winces.
text: Unkempt, wispy beard. General filthiness.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Shit.
text: A hand reaches for the car door he’s standing in front of.
text: He turns to see a dripping-wet Kelly.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Excuse me.
dialog: (eyes widen, realizing)
dialog: OhmyGod!!
text: Joe covers her mouth.
scene_heading: EXT. WOLFE’S POND PARK, PLAYGROUND - NIGHT
text: Joe and Kelly alone, on a SEESAW. We hear party sounds in
text: the distance, and lapping waves.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: But why not like, run away to
dialog: California?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: This was the only way to start
dialog: fresh on our own terms. We answer
dialog: to no one. We don’t need a larger
dialog: social structure to be happy.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Oh my God! You went insane!
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Or we're the only sane ones.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Well either way. I wouldn’t have
dialog: the guts to do it.
text: Joe beams at the compliment. Kelly takes a drink from her
text: big red solo cup.
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D)
dialog: So, um...can I see it?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I mean, that’s funny. The reason
dialog: I’m out here, risking the entire
dialog: enterprise, was to invite you over
dialog: for dinner. If you want.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Obviously “I want.” How do I get
dialog: there? Do I have to be
dialog: blindfolded?
dialog: She makes
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I’m not sure yet. And it is of
dialog: absolute vital importance that you
dialog: not tell anyone, not bring anyone,
dialog: not breathe a word of this
dialog: conversation or any ensuing events,
dialog: to anyone, no best friends, no
dialog: family. No one.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Okay. Can I bring Vicki?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Fine. Just Vicki.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Oh my God. So much fun. Does
dialog: Patrick have a big crazy beard too?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yeah, a little more serious than
dialog: this one. I have thin hair. A
dialog: gift and a curse.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Facial hair is very sexy. You just
dialog: gotta, you know, groom it.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Right, like Paul.
text: a face.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I guess you wouldn’t have heard...
dialog: Paul and I broke up.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No, I didn’t get wind of it. It’s
dialog: not big news among the badgers.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I’m sorry, though. Are you okay?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (bemused)
dialog: Yes, I’m very okay. Thank you.
text: A silhouetted figure calls to them, backlit by headlights.
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: KID’S VOICE
dialog: Yo Kel! We’re leaving!
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Shit. Okay. When am I coming?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Saturday.
speaker_heading: KID’S VOICE
dialog: (walking toward them)
dialog: Who is that?!
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (panic) I’m out of here.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Go! I’1l see you Saturday.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Bring your appetite. And some
dialog: insect repellent.
dialog: (running off)
dialog: Oh, hey -- yellow is your favorite
dialog: color, right?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Yes...why?
text: But he’s gone.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS - MORNING
text: Patrick walks outside, groggy.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Joe?
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS, FIRE PIT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Patrick brushes his teeth with boiled water from the pot,
text: over the fire. He looks up, and notices Biaggio, about
text: twenty yards away, clinging to a tree, perfectly still.
text: He stares at Patrick. He is covered with mud, leaves and
text: branches, trying to be camouflaged.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Biaggio.
text: No response. Patrick moves toward him.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: PATRICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Yo. I see you man.
text: He’s now a foot from Biaggio’s face. Biaggio won’t break.
speaker_heading: PATRICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello! I fucking see you! I’m
dialog: looking in your eyes!
text: Biaggio stares back unfazed, at one with the tree.
speaker_heading: PATRICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Dickhead!
text: Fed up, he pushes Biaggio off the tree..
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: Oh, hey. What’s up?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: (rolls eyes)
dialog: Yeah, “hey.” Where’s Joe?
scene_heading: PREPARATION MONTAGE:
text: Joe picks yellow flowers in a vast meadow.
text: Joe, half submerged in a stream, trims his facial hair.
text: Joe lays out clothing options. There are three shorts-and-a-
text: T-shirt combinations. All are stained and grimy.
text: “Upstairs,” Joe unrolls a blanket, revealing small safe
text: deposit box. He unlocks it and removes a wad of PETTY CASH.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS - DAY
text: Joe, and his new MOUSTACHE, sets the table with hot Boston
dialog: Market Chicken.
speaker_heading: PATRICK'S VOICE
dialog: (from doorway)
dialog: Such hypocrisy.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What? This is a special occasion.
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Bullshit man. How much chicken
dialog: have you bought since we got here??
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Huh? I mean, maybe one or two
dialog: along the way. Biaggio and I have
dialog: been pretty goddam dangerous out
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: (sigh)
dialog: I can live with the chicken being
dialog: store-bought, but I’m disappointed
dialog: in the loaded potato. I thought
dialog: that was really Biaggio’s recipe.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: That actually really is. I have no
dialog: idea where he’s getting chives.
text: Patrick looks at Joe’s moustache.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: And I’d lose that thing as well.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What? (realizing) Nope. This is
dialog: who I am now.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: You look fucking weird, man. You
dialog: look like one of those kids who
text: works in the student Shop Rite.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You don’t know what you’re talking
text: about. The moustache is the real
dialog: man’s choice. It’s a companion.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: It’s not a real moustache. It’s
text: all stringy and pervy.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Give it some time.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: (staring at it)
dialog: You look like that kid Mike
dialog: Mancuso.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Mancuso? He’s a good guy.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
text: He brought a flare gun to school in
dialog: January. Remember that?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What do you want me to tell you?
dialog: January’s tough on some people.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Seriously, shave the moustache.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS, FIRE PIT - EVENING
text: Joe staring into the fire. The wavy heat lines gliss to:
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS, OVERLOOK - FANTASY
text: Crane down from an immaculate sunset. Joe and Kelly watch,
text: wearing huge, flowing, Arthurian robes. Flower pedals fall
text: from the sky. A land of kings and wizards.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: How do you like it here?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: This is the happiest I’ve ever
dialog: been, Joe. But...
dialog: (looks at him)
dialog: Are we too young to know what love
dialog: is?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I know. I’m afraid of that too.
dialog: But we can be afraid together.
text: He leans in to kiss her, when:
speaker_heading: PAUL'S VOICE
dialog: Kelly.
text: They turn - Paul waits by edge of the trees. He looks
text: haggard, crazed.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Time to come home.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I am home.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Cut the shit, babe! You’re fifteen,
dialog: I’m seventeen. Time to settle down.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Not with you, Ju’tuun. Never with
dialog: you.
text: She clutches Joe’s arm.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Don’t tell me. This? This...boy??
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: He’s more man than you’ll ever be.
dialog: End this, Joe.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: “End this”...are you sure you know
dialog: what you're asking?
text: She nods.
text: Then, Paul unsheathes two large, wrought-iron hookswords and
text: CHARGES. In one fluid motion, Joe jumpkicks Kelly out of the
text: way, and slices a ROPE running along the floor. Joe then
text: rolls, as we see a huge LOG, hanging by a thick rope, swing
text: out from the trees behind them.
text: Paul turns -- it hits him in the chest, obliterating him over
text: the cliff. He bounces a few times along the rocky face, and
text: then slides to a halt, dead.
text: Joe and Kelly peer down at him. She begins to cry gently.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: You would weep for him?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Only for youth...only for youth.
text: Some weasels approach the corpse and begin to pick at it.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: The animals will take his
dialog: eyes...denying his entry into
dialog: Paradise...
text: He kisses her forehead, then stares across the treetops,
text: reflecting on the fragile nature of life.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: PATRICK'S VOICE
dialog: Joe!
text: As Joe turns around:
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS, FIRE PIT - REALITY
text: Joe snaps out of it, turning to face Patrick.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: We have company.
text: Aaron, Vicki and Kelly emerge from the trail behind him.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS - LATER
text: Kelly in the doorway, seeing everything for the first time.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Are you kidding me right now?
text: From Kelly’s POV: The slide, the hockey table, the loft. Joe
text: waits nervously for her judgment. Then:
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D)
dialog: This is great, Joe!
text: On Joe’s face. Life is good.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS, DINNER TABLE - EVENING
text: A Boston Market feast. The sunflowers Joe picked sit in the
text: center of the table.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I like your beard, Patrick! You
text: look like a werewolf.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: (quick, to Vicki)
dialog: Watch your mouth.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: What did you guys do with this
dialog: chicken? Garlic? Oil? Rosemary?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Biaggio?
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: Thyme. Garlic and oil. Lotta
dialog: pepper.
text: Patrick rolls his eyes.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: It melts. You don’t need a knife.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What do you guys eat most of the
dialog: time? This?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Yeah. There are a lot of chicken
dialog: in these woods, apparently.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Patrick takes care of berries,
dialog: grains, herbs.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Ha. You’re like an Australopithecus
dialog: woman.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I handle meats, proteins. I usually
dialog: do the hunting.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: (quiet)
dialog: And the shopping.
text: Joe glares at him. Patrick smiles, mouth full, loving it.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: What do you do, Biaggio?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Biaggio’s a renaissance man. He
dialog: belongs out here. And such quick
dialog: hands. He can snatch trout right
text: out of the creek.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Bullshit.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: It’s true man. I’ve seen it.
dialog: 71.
text: Biaggio slides something across the table to Aaron: a wallet.
text: Aaron checks the inside; it’s his.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Did you take anything out?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: He doesn’t want your money. He
dialog: does it for sport.
text: Joe notices Kelly eyeing the flowers. Good. She points at
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Aaron, can you pass me the corn?
text: Aaron complies, handing them to her over the flowers. Joe
text: registers the slightest disappointment.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS - NIGHT
text: Joe and Kelly. She points at a wall: half a rotten fish
text: skeleton nailed above a calendar. Beneath that, an old wire-
dialog: legged stool.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What’s this supposed to be?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: This is the den.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Ha. How stupid of me. Did you
dialog: catch this fish yourself?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: We found it whole, floating in the
dialog: swamp. I bet Biaggio he couldn’t
dialog: eat the whole thing, and it turns
dialog: out I was right.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Sexy.
dialog: (points upstairs)
dialog: And that’s the master bedroom?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yeah. We need the slide because of
dialog: shit-leg over there.
text: At the table, Patrick inspects the chicken skeleton for more
dialog: meat.
dialog: 72.
text: Joe uses this lull to gather the necessary courage.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: There’s also a pretty cool sort of
dialog: lookout you might like. I dunno.
dialog: It's sort of splendid. Did I just
dialog: say “splendid”?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Yes, you did. A lookout?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yeah...we could go check it out of
dialog: your want. It’s like a fifteen
dialog: minute hike, maybe.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Oh, yeah I want to see everything.
dialog: But look at this -- I can’t leave
dialog: Vicki alone with these jackals.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh, yeah, no. Of course not.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS, ‘LIVING ROOM’ - NIGHT
text: Everyone sits on couch cushions that have been tossed on the
text: floor. Beers are out. A joint makes the rounds. Some of
text: them wear Patrick’s ridiculous Nigerian bushmen MASKS.
text: They're watching Biaggio, who break dances in the middle of
text: the room to “Breathe,” by Prodigy. Biaggio is killing it --
text: he’s actually a brilliant dancer. He too wears a mask.
text: Applause. Kelly passes the joint to Patrick.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I’m good.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Gotcha.
dialog: (all smiles)
dialog: No weed, but you’ll run away from
text: home. Very contradictory.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Well, I go back twice a week to do
dialog: laundry.
text: She smiles.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: PATRICK (CONT'D)
dialog: (holding arm up)
dialog: I have a beer, see? I’m dangerous.
speaker_heading: KELLY
text: A full beer.
text: She clanks bottles with him and starts chugging. He does the
text: same, catching Joe’s glance across the floor. Patrick rolls
text: his eyes, like “women.” Joe fakes a smile.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS - NIGHT
text: One side of the fire, Aaron and Vicki. On another, Patrick
text: and Kelly. Joe and Biaggio are off to the side, speaking in
dialog: private.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Vicki is making eyes at you. You
dialog: should go talk to her.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: No. I think she likes Aaron.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I doubt it. Aaron’s bizarre. I
dialog: feel like he has no asshole or
text: something. Like a Conehead.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: Well, there’s no point in me
text: talking to her anyway.
text: Biaggio looks down.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What’s wrong?
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: (a struggle for him)
dialog: Joe...I’m gay.
text: Joe is taken aback.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Jesus...are you sure, man?
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
text: Yes. My lungs fill up with fluid
dialog: every time the seasons change.
dialog: Joe thinks about how to put this.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: That’s not being gay...I think that
dialog: means you have cystic fibrosis.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: Really?
dialog: (relief)
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Cystic fibrosis is no walk in the
dialog: park, Biaggio.
text: Biaggio waves him off, unworried.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: What about her?
text: Joe's POV: Kelly and Patrick, firelit, talking and laughing.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: She’s doing what girls do. Acting
text: like she doesn’t care. It’s fine.
dialog: I can wait.
text: Biaggio leaves to talk to Vicki. Joe watches Kelly, who
text: never looks in his direction.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS - NIGHT
text: Downstairs, a tangle of limbs on the floor. And the couch.
text: In the dark, we can’t really tell who’s sleeping where.
speaker_heading: UPSTAIRS:
text: Joe lies on his side, covers pulled high. The light is dim,
text: but we see he’s awake.
text: Creaking from downstairs. The top of the ladder shakes. He
text: stares at it...hands, then arms come into view. Then the
text: face. It’s Kelly.
text: She walks toward Joe. His eyes widen as...
text: She carefully steps over him, and shakes Patrick awake. We
text: don't leave Joe’s face during this next exchange.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (whisper) Hey...can you sleep?
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Um, yes.
text: We hear her hushed laughter.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Do you want to take a walk or
dialog: something? I can’t sleep.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Sure.
text: We hear rustling; Patrick rises. Tight on Joe. Unblinking.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS —- MORNING
text: Wide, expansive. Establish a new day.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS, UPSTAIRS - MORNING
text: Beams of light slice through the loft. Joe lies in the same
text: position, wearing the same expression.
text: We hear voices from downstairs.
speaker_heading: VICKI’S VOICE
dialog: Is he still sleeping?
speaker_heading: PATRICK'S VOICE
dialog: Joe!
text: Joe doesn’t respond. The ladder rattles; Kelly peeks over
text: the landing. Joe quickly shuts his eyes.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (whisper) Joe. We’re leaving.
dialog: Are you awake?
text: Joe keeps his eyes closed.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS, FRONT - MORNING
text: Kelly stands at the edge of the clearing, where the trail
text: begins. Patrick hands her a girlish duffel bag.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: So did Biaggio tell you about
dialog: “Omerta”?
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Omerta, yes. The Sicilian code of
dialog: silence. Don’t worry, we all swore.
text: He made Aaron cut his palm.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Good. Well, you know the way so
dialog: +..you can come back anytime.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Thanks. So can you.
text: They both smile.
scene_heading: INT. PATRICK'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: A car pulls into the driveway...illuminating FRANK on the
text: stoop. Mr. McGuire gets out of the car.
speaker_heading: MR. MCGUIRE
dialog: (emotionless)
dialog: Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Daniel. Listen, I --
text: Mr. McGuire punches Frank in the face. Frank goes down.
speaker_heading: MR. MCGUIRE
dialog: Nice parenting, you cooze!
text: They roll around on the lawn, fighting. Mrs. McGuire comes
text: to the door.
scene_heading: MRS. MCGUIRE
dialog: No no no! Nooooo--
text: Off her howls of protest:
scene_heading: INT. MCGUIRE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: The McGuires sit on their couch, opposite Frank. Frank holds
text: an ice pack to his eye. Mr. McGuire has a scratch mark on
text: his cheek, and a fat lip.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I’m not here to apologize for my
dialog: son.
dialog: 77.
scene_heading: MRS. MCGUIRE
dialog: And you shouldn’t. We don’t even
dialog: know - for sure - that they ran
dialog: away. We do not know. All anyone
dialog: can do is suspect things. Suspect
dialog: suspect suspect.
speaker_heading: MR. MCGUIRE
dialog: The police have presented a lot of
dialog: evidence, honey. They’re certain.
dialog: We have to trust them.
scene_heading: MRS. MCGUIRE
dialog: Well what do the police know! With
dialog: their pig Irish agenda. The Irish
dialog: are the blacks of Europe! The
dialog: blacks of Europe!
speaker_heading: MR. MCGUIRE
dialog: (rubbing her back)
dialog: Shhhhh...come on. I’m Irish,
dialog: sweetheart.
dialog: (then)
dialog: This has been hard on her, Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: And I don’t want to take up more of
dialog: your time. Trust me. I know this
dialog: is awkward. I just...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I noticed you put some fliers of
dialog: Patrick around school, around the
dialog: neighborhood. I asked the police
dialog: if I should do that with Joe, if
dialog: that would be helpful, and they
dialog: said it couldn’t hurt. So I was
dialog: just going to ask you if you had
dialog: some pictures of Joseph. If there
text: were shots of him and Patrick
dialog: together, whatever. Some recent
dialog: stuff. You’d be doing me a favor.
text: Silence for a moment.
scene_heading: MRS. MCGUIRE
dialog: Oh. I’11 look. We have...hold on.
scene_heading: INT. MCGUIRE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - LATER
text: She hands Frank about five pictures. Frank thumbs through
dialog: them.
dialog: 78.
text: Joe and Patrick on a back porch, drying off, a pool in the
text: background. At Medieval Times, wearing hats. Covered in
dialog: shaving cream on Halloween.
text: Frank is transfixed by them.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Thank you.
scene_heading: EXT. MEADOW - DAY
text: The SUN. We’re looking straight up at it.
text: Joe lies, squinting, in the same meadow where he picked the
dialog: flowers for dinner.
text: Utter silence. He twirls a dandelion in his hand...
text: Then grinds the flowerhead between the meaty parts of his
text: thumb and forefinger.
text: Joe sits up. We see that the meadow is expansive, beautiful.
text: Tall yellow flowers stretch far into the distance. He shades
text: his brow with his hand, looking around.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (shouts loudly)
dialog: Biaggio!?
text: Nothing. He shades his brow, looking for any sign of
dialog: Biaggio.
text: Then, less than five feet from him, Biaggio emerges, making
dialog: Joe jump.

speaker_heading: BIAGGIO

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I’m sorry I’m not more fun to be

dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: Let’s do something fun. You need
dialog: it. Let’s make fresh jam.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I don’t want to make fresh jam,
dialog: Biaggio. I just want to be alone.
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: Or we could even do that other
dialog: thing. The thing we talked about.
speaker_heading: JOE

scene_heading: EXT. WOODS, OVERLOOK - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Oh, hey Joe, I--
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Whoops. No nono nono. Stay

speaker_heading: PATRICK

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: PATRICK

scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: PATRICK

speaker_heading: JOE

dialog: What’s up? Why’d you leave her?
dialog: Go back.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Joe...look man. Nothing’s going
dialog: on, okay?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It’s fine. You win. The best man
dialog: won.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: What does that mean? She just
dialog: likes me. We get along.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Cool. I guess she likes everyone
dialog: though. So I mean, if she likes
dialog: everyone, she likes no one. You
dialog: know?
text: Patrick snatches the bottle from Joe.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: What the fuck is this shit...
dialog: Arizona Iced Tea? You're sober,
dialog: Joe. Why are you acting like a
dialog: weird lawyer or something?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You’re so young.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Listen, if you and your girlfriend
dialog: want, come over later for dinner
dialog: and a board game. Okay?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: “Come over”?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: If you want. Biaggio will be there

scene_heading: EXT. WOODS, SCENIC OVERLOOK - MOMENTS LATER
text: Patrick and Kelly sit, facing each other.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: We’re not doing anything wrong.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I know.
text: Patrick looks down, futzing around with a twig, thinking.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Do you want to...do something
dialog: wrong?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Very much so.
text: He chucks the twig over the cliff. She approaches and sits
text: in his lap. He puts his arms around her. He’s easily twice
text: her size. They look in the same direction, over the trees.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: So did it work?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Did what work?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: This. The house. Are you happier
dialog: out here?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I mean...I’m just happy to be where
dialog: my parents are not.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: They can’t be that bad. I mean
dialog: what did they do, anyway? Everyone
dialog: at school thinks they were like
dialog: molesting the shit out of you.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: “Molesting the shit out of me”? No
dialog: no. I would have stayed for that.
dialog: (she laughs)
dialog: No...it was nothing that sinister.
dialog: 82.
text: He thinks about it.
speaker_heading: PATRICK (CONT'D)
dialog: They weren’t bad people, they were
dialog: just always...there. Down my
dialog: throat, all day, every day.
dialog: Constant and unyielding. I was
text: getting hives. The top of my head
dialog: would tingle. I thought I was
text: gonna have a heart attack.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: So, they were down your throat...
dialog: like everybody else’s parents.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: No, “not like everybody else’s.” I
dialog: do not accept that.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Everybody else’s.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I’m fourteen. My mom offered to
dialog: cut my nails six months ago.
text: She sits up, facing him.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Every single morning, my parents
dialog: set out three dollars and twenty-
dialog: five cents. The three dollars is
dialog: for lunch. The twenty five cents
dialog: is so I can call and tell them I
dialog: got to school okay.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And I’m fifteen.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: They watch me eat. Sometimes they
dialog: don’t say anything. They get
dialog: pleasure out of it.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: They watch me sleep. Like serial
dialog: killers. I wake up, and they’1l be
text: standing at the doorway.
text: Patrick laughs.
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D)
dialog: That's just parents, Patrick. All

speaker_heading: PATRICK

speaker_heading: LISA

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I will. Go to school, get drunk

dialog: And you can call me too, you know.
text: They hug. Colin turns and approaches for a goodbye. Frank
text: waves coolly.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Take it easy, Colin.
text: Colin goes in for a handshake, but Frank has already waved.
text: Colin quickly retracts, waving, but by then Frank has leaned
text: in for a handshake. After a few missed signals, Frank sighs,
text: grabs Colin’s hand and shakes it.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus. It never ends with you.
scene_heading: EXT. JOE’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Frank waves as the car pulls away. The car hits the corner,

text: street. Whipping past Frank’s house. Frank watches them go.
scene_heading: INT. JOE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: He clicks on the TV, the stereo. Noise fills the atmosphere.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DUSK

scene_heading: INT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS - NIGHT

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Easy does it. (to them) He likes

speaker_heading: BIAGGIO

speaker_heading: PATRICK

speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Really? Okay.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: And your Get Out of Jail Free card.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Yeah...but if I need it, can I have

speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Yes, you can have it back.
speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: KELLY

speaker_heading: PATRICK

speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: ...Are you two alright?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (polite smile)
dialog: We're golden.
dialog: (rolls die)
dialog: Monkey.

speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Good job, Joe.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: He didn’t do anything. It’s dice.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I’m gonna put one more house on...
text: Joe stops and looks at the board.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Actually...Biaggio, I will give you

speaker_heading: BIAGGIO

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: Yahtzee.

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (to Patrick) Property manager, can
dialog: I get hotels on orange?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: You just gave him the corner,
dialog: dickhead. What’s the matter with
dialog: you?
text: Patrick puts the hotel on orange...then pauses. He looks at

text: Patrick looks at Joe.
speaker_heading: PATRICK (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s up, Joe?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Nothing’s up.
dialog: (big smile)
dialog: It’s your roll, Tum Tum.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Joe, if I roll a six, eight or nine
dialog: it’s gonna get very bad in here.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (looking at board)
dialog: Oh...yeah.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Well, I don’t know what to tell

text: Joe leans back and exhales cigar smoke. A woodland Bugsy.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Well let’s just take a minute and
dialog: relax. It’s a game, right?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I’m relaxed. Biaggio?
text: Biaggio nods, gagging on cigar smoke.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: What’s your fucking problem, man??
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Just roll, Patrick. Don’t let it
dialog: get to you. You'll be fine.
dialog: 87.
text: A tense moment of silence. Patrick rolls.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS - MOMENTS LATER
text: Wide. A beat of nothing...then, the monopoly board flies out
dialog: the window.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS - CONTINUOUS
text: Joe retreats to the corner. Patrick is trying to move toward
text: him, as Kelly tugs his arm.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I have a cigar! Be careful! This
dialog: whole place is dry wood!
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Give a fuck, man! What was that
dialog: play!?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Jesus! It. Is. A. Game!
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What I did was completely legal!
text: Patrick takes a step at Joe, but Kelly steps between them.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You guys, stop! Biaggio’s having
dialog: some sort of episode!
text: Biaggio sits rocking in the corner.
speaker_heading: JOE
text: Leave him. He’s rationalizing.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: (to Joe)
dialog: That was the lowest, shittiest,
dialog: dickhead move I’ve ever seen.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Eh -- second lowest.
text: Patrick pauses, marveling at Joe’s pettiness.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Fuck. You. No one was trying to
dialog: hurt you, man. It had nothing to
dialog: do with you. Get over it!
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I’m fucking over it! I don’t care!
dialog: If the bitch wants you, she’s not
dialog: good enough for me anyway.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: What? Huh?? Who the fuck are you,
dialog: Mary J. Blige??
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Joe, I didn’t--
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No, Kelly! Everything was fine
dialog: until you got here. Jesus! You're
dialog: like a fucking cancer.
text: Kelly is completely stunned. Hurt. Her eyes well up.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Okay. Um, I guess I’ll see you
dialog: guys later...
text: And just like that...she leaves. Patrick watches.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: (hurt, confused)
dialog: What are you doing, Joe?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Go ahead. Go be with her.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I don’t want to go, Joe.
text: Joe pushes him. Patrick doesn’t budge.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Get out of here! Go hang out with
dialog: Kelly and your goddam mother!
text: Joe keeps pushing him. Patrick stands his ground.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: (heartbroken)
dialog: What...Why are you doing this, man?
text: Then, rage and frustration at their peak, Joe KICKS Patrick’s
text: bad foot. This gets a reaction.
speaker_heading: PATRICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Ah! Fuck!
dialog: 89.
text: Patrick’s face darkens. Joe comes to his senses - he just
dialog: poked the bear.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Shit.
text: Patrick raises his hand to punch Joe, but resists the urge --
text: he'd kill him. He turns, channeling his rage toward the AIR
text: HOCKEY TABLE. He chucks it, roaring, in Joe’s general
text: direction. It hits the WEST WALL and topples it. Leaves and
text: dirt kick up, blowing into the house.
text: Joe watches, his chest heaving with anger, panic. Then he
text: turns to Patrick. They look at each other.
text: Silence. There has never been such darkness between them.
text: Finally, inevitably...Patrick moves to the door. Joe watches
text: him leave. It’s over.
text: Biaggio approaches Joe, meek.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Just leave me alone, please.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I’m saying leave. Get out of the
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: Be straight with me, Joe. Tell me
dialog: what’s on your mind Joe.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I want to be alone, Biaggio. Get
dialog: the fuck out.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: Don’t mince words with me, Joe.
dialog: We've been through too much.
text: Joe looks him in the eye.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS - CONTINUOUS
text: Biaggio walks out in a wide shot. His head hangs.
dialog: 90.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS - CONTINUOUS
text: Joe sits on the sofa, back to the downed wall, taking in the
text: ruin of his house.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS, PATH - NIGHT
text: Various shots of Patrick, struggling on his bad foot, through
text: brush and over huge, gangly roots. He uses a large branch as
text: a WALKING STICK.
text: He sits on a rock, massaging his lower leg. Angry. Sad.
text: It's all hitting him.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Fucking Joe. Asshole.
text: Suddenly, we hear a RUSTLE. Patrick looks up.
speaker_heading: PATRICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello?
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: PATRICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Is someone there? Kelly?
text: A shadowy figure wipes across the foreground. We can’t make
dialog: it out.
speaker_heading: PATRICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Biaggio, you're smarter than this.
text: We hear a GRUNT. It’s not Biaggio. Patrick rises, moving
text: down the path as quickly as his bum foot will allow.
text: Then, a TUFT OF ORANGE HAIR catches his eye. What is
dialog: happening?
text: Patrick limps faster now, panicking, out of breath. A
text: snarling ROAR.
speaker_heading: PATRICK (CONT'D)
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Oh fuck. God. Jesus.
text: FOOTSTEPS. Whatever it is, it’s getting closer.
text: Patrick STUMBLES on a root, and falls against a tree. He
text: turns, hiding behind it.
dialog: 91.
text: Patrick takes his sneaker off, jamming the walking stick
text: inside it to simulate a leg. He sticks it out into the path
text: as bait. Nothing bites.
dialog: Silence.
text: He turns to look at the path. It’s empty. As he doubles
text: back behind the tree:
text: We reveal a huge, green 2-D computer-animated monster -- it’s
dialog: BLANKA from “Street Fighter.”
text: Standing on hind legs, it ROARS 3 TIMES in Patrick’s face.
text: Patrick SCREAMS and, instinctively, SMASHES BLANKA IN THE
text: FACE with his walking stick.
text: Upon impact, Blanka transforms into what he actually is -- a
text: small tree with a shock of red-orange leaves at the top.
text: Patrick has cracked it in half.
speaker_heading: PATRICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Huh.
text: He stares at it, his head cocked. He blinks. Just a tree.
dialog: Nothing scary about it.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUTH OF THE WOODS - NIGHT
text: Kelly, walking on a dark street. Alone. Unhappy. We hear
text: the clacking of her shoes.
text: Then from behind her:
speaker_heading: PATRICK'S VOICE
dialog: Kelly!
text: She stops. He limps/runs toward her, catching up. They
text: stand face to face for a beat.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (blurting)
dialog: I didn't want any of this to happen
dialog: I don’t want to come between
dialog: friends I've just liked you for
dialog: months and I figured if I came out
dialog: here and we got to--
text: He kisses her. She returns it.
dialog: 92.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS - NIGHT
text: Joe tries to lift the fallen wall. He’s not strong enough.
text: He gives up, looks at it, rubs his shoulder.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS, TABLE - NIGHT
text: Joe picks bits of meat from a clean chicken skeleton.
scene_heading: INT. TOY KITCHEN - SAME TIME
text: Frank opens the refrigerator door. The only option: leftover
text: shrimp with lobster sauce. Christ knows how old it is.
dialog: Quick cuts:
text: He picks the shrimp out and places them over some white rice.
text: Pops the bowl in the microwave.
text: Eats in front of the television.
scene_heading: INT. FRANK’S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Frank, alone in a king-size bed, staring at the ceiling.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS, UPSTAIRS - NIGHT
text: Joe pulls the sheets up to his chin. He rolls over, trying
text: to get comfortable. Sounds of the forest occasionally
text: startle him.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS - CONTINUOUS
text: Extreme wide. The house, a small and vulnerable structure in
text: the huge, dark forest.
scene_heading: INT. PATRICK’S ROOM - MORNING
text: Patrick wakes up. In his own bed. He rolls over:
text: His parents are watching from the doorway. Disbelieving.
dialog: Overcome.
scene_heading: MRS. MCGUIRE
dialog: We didn’t want to wake you.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: You were watching me sleep.
text: He smiles to himself.
scene_heading: EXT. TOTTENVILLE, MAIN STREET - DAY
text: Tilt down from the sky to a festive SMALL TOWN PARADE.
text: Families, teenagers, the elderly, all line the curb.
text: Marching down the street: attractive women in red, white &
text: blue leotards. Members of the local Chamber of Commerce inch
text: behind the twirlers in a vintage Cadillac.
text: Banners read “HAPPY MEMORIAL DAY.”
speaker_heading: ANGLE:
text: A group of college-age kids, set back from the crowd, sit
text: around an SUV, drinking, grilling.
text: An adorable, long-legged girl in sparkle-y FACE PAINT (21)
dialog: makes eyes at...
text: A dangerous looking guy in a VISOR (26), standing way in the
text: corner, with his back to the WOODS. He takes a sip of beer.
text: She looks away. Then looks back.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DAY
text: They make out against a tree. The parade isn’t too far away,
text: we can still hear faint music, applause.
speaker_heading: VISOR
dialog: (takes her hand)
dialog: Come on.
speaker_heading: FACE PAINT
dialog: Where are we going?
text: He leads her deeper into the woods. They pause every few
text: trees to kiss some more.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS, WATERING HOLE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Shoes, flip-flops come off. Unzipping; they are both
text: stepping on their shorts, prying them off their ankles.
text: Breaking the kiss, he takes her shirt off, chucks it.
dialog: 94,
speaker_heading: VISOR
dialog: Let’s go.
speaker_heading: FACE PAINT
dialog: Wait wait wait. Hold on.
text: She dips her toe in, testing. He grabs her, pulls her close,
text: more kissing, kinda sloppy. As they pull apart, a shape
text: emerges drifts on the water behind them trees behind them:
text: JOE. Asleep in the tire. Looking like shit, sun-blasted,
text: filthy and too thin.
text: They see him.
speaker_heading: FACE PAINT (CONT'D)
dialog: Ohmigod!
text: Joe wakes up.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (groggy)
dialog: Wha...? Pat--oh, Jesus--
text: Joe averts his eyes. The girl grabs her shirt, looking to
dialog: cover up quickly.
speaker_heading: VISOR
dialog: Kid! What the fuck man!
text: He and her dart off into the woods.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Sorry...
text: They’re gone. Joe looks at the empty spot where they
text: disappeared into the woods.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DAY
text: Joe wanders, tossing twigs around, aimless. Stumbling about,
text: like a man who’s been in the desert for days.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS, FIRE PIT - DAY
text: Joe jams flint against a twig, into a pile of dry sticks and
text: leaves. He’s awkward, sometimes missing the twig entirely.
dialog: It’s not working.
dialog: 95.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS - DAY
text: He opens the cooler. Scraps of odd, unidentifiable meat.
text: Four berries in the bottom of a basket. A rotten apple.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - LATER
text: Overcome by hunger, he closes his eyes and eats a bunch of
scene_heading: PURPLE BERRIES.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS, STREAM - LATER
text: Wide. Joe VOMITS some purple stuff into the stream.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS - DAY
text: Joe looks in the petty cash box. Just some change. Not even
dialog: quarters.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Shit.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS, UPSTAIRS - MOMENTS LATER
text: Frenetic camera. Joe searches the pockets of his shorts,
text: pants, everything he brought with him. He pulls the pockets
text: inside out. Two nickels in one. The rest are empty.
text: His expression grows dire.
text: In one of the pockets, we hear the crisp rustle of money --
text: he pulls something from a pocket, but it’s not cash: it’s an
text: old Boston Market order, scribbled onto a torn sheet of
text: paper. Shit. He chucks it aside.
text: He dumps out the contents of his DUFFEL BAG. Rummages
text: through the pile. Beneath some junky housewares, he
dialog: unexpectedly finds...
text: The library books. Still unopened. “WALDEN.”...”105 OUTDOOR
text: RECIPES”...”“SO YOU WANT TO BUILD A CABIN”...
text: And most appropriately: “I’D RATHER BE HUNTING.”
text: Joe regards it with curiosity...
dialog: 96.
scene_heading: CAPT. DAVIS’S VOICE
dialog: From a statement given by Patrick
dialog: McGuire...
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION, CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Frank sits across from CAPTAIN ARTY DAVIS (45). Frank leans
text: against the wall behind them, watching. The Captain reads
text: from a file.
scene_heading: CAPT. DAVIS
dialog: “May 12th. We had a fight. Over
dialog: something stupid, but...you know.
dialog: It got out of hand. I came home;
dialog: there was no point in going on if

dialog: The destination was Tallahassee.
dialog: It was Joe’s choice, he told me he

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hm. Seems arbitrary.
scene_heading: CAPT. DAVIS

dialog: you find out.”
text: Davis closes the file. Frank frowns.
speaker_heading: CAPT. DAVIS (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: And the other kid?
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION, OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

scene_heading: CAPT. DAVIS

speaker_heading: (MORE )

speaker_heading: CAPT. DAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m afraid he’s given us nothing so
dialog: far...he has a contempt for the law
dialog: I’ve never seen in a minor.
text: The captain presses a speaker button on a console. We hear
text: the conversation in the interrogation room.
speaker_heading: COP 1
dialog: Why don’t you sit down so we can
dialog: have a nice discussion. We’re all
dialog: pals, right? No reason not to be.
scene_heading: CAPT. DAVIS
dialog: (to Frank)
dialog: He won’t sit. Won’t deflate the
dialog: room. It’s actually very
dialog: sophisticated.
text: Biaggio walks to the two-way mirror and stares through it.
text: He knows he’s being watched.
speaker_heading: CAPT. DAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: This kid is in my head.
text: Biaggio returns to the chair, picks it up and walks calmly
text: toward the glass. The two cops quickly move toward him.
speaker_heading: COP 1
dialog: Whoa whoa whoa. None of that.
text: They wrestle the chair from him.
scene_heading: CAPT. DAVIS
dialog: He knows something. Maybe a lot.
text: Frank stares at Biaggio.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DAY
dialog: Wide. To establish.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DAY

text: Reaching down to PECK, the ground suddenly collapses beneath

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Bah! Murder! Murder! Murder!

dialog: I’m sorry I yelled at you.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS, FIRE PIT - DAY
text: Joe, referring to an open book, rhythmically moves the flint
text: downward against the dry wood until he gets a spark. He
text: stares at it, shocked...then remembers to BLOW.
text: FIRE. On Joe: amazed at the fire, and at himself.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS, FIRE PIT - DAY
text: Joe stands over a pot of steaming water, holding the starling
text: out in front of him. He’s full of grime and bird blood.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Goddam it...
text: He drops the bird in, averting his eyes. The water bubbles,
text: sizzles, hisses.
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS, FIRE PIT - DAY
text: Joe yanks feathers from the bird. Wings, then neck. We can
text: tell he’s not happy about it, but it has to be done.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS - DAY
text: The carcass is laid out on a rock, next to a reference book.
text: Joe holds a machete.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (reading)
text: “Gut bird, slicing vertically from
dialog: rectum to collar. Save the heart,
dialog: liver and gizzard if you wish.”
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: (to book)
dialog: Go fuck yourself.
text: He scrunches up his face and makes an incision.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS, TABLE - NIGHT
text: Joe wipes his hands with a rag looking down at something:
text: A nicely cooked STARLING, still whole, on a platter. Soot
text: marks and stab wounds aside, it’s an appetizing sight.
text: Joe scatters some berries into the plate beside the bird, for
dialog: the sake of aesthetics...
text: Then places a single green HERB on top.
text: He sits down, stares at his preparation. He does not smile;
text: instead, he looks at the empty chairs around the table.
text: He sighs...
text: Then looks past the chairs, squinting.
text: Joe's POV: Patrick’s BUSHMAN MASK hangs by the door. Staring
text: at him.
text: Off Joe's face...
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS, TABLE - CONTINUOUS
text: Joe pulls his chair up again, nodding across the table.
dialog: Reverse to:
text: The MASK, a lousy rendition of Patrick, hangs from the top of
text: the chair. It stares back at Joe.
text: Joe starts eating. He opens his mouth to speak...then closes
text: it...then opens it.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Wha...I...Um...
dialog: (comes to his senses)
dialog: Yeah.
text: Joe stares at the mask for a sad beat, then returns to his
dialog: meal.
text: Suddenly - oddly - the mask chair SHIFTS. Joe stops chewing,
text: and smiles. A fleeting moment of delusion.
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: ..-Hello?
text: The chair shifts again. Not much, an inch or two. But the
text: movement is obvious. Joe’s smile disappears -- something
dialog: isn’t right.
text: He pushes his chair back, slowly ducking under the table...
dialog: and finds
scene_heading: THE COPPERHEAD
text: Moving quickly toward his legs.
text: Joe collapses out of his chair, terrified. The snake BITES -—
text: but is still too far away to connect with Joe.
text: Joe regains his footing and runs to the center of the room.
text: It moves toward him, sizing him up, HISSING...
text: Joe takes two steps back, and the snake quickly covers the
dialog: ground.
text: A beat on Joe, looking around, gaging his distance to the
text: door, versus where the snake is. He will lose that race.
text: The snake is only a few feet away, approaching tentatively.
text: Joe is cornered. Last option:
text: Joe takes a deep breath, and STANDS HIS GROUND. The snake
dialog: pauses.
text: Joe closes his eyes, and puts his hand on his chest. He
text: exhales slowly. Tries to relax. When he opens his eyes...
text: The snake has re-coiled. It, too, is relaxed. Its tongue
text: flicks out every two seconds. Rhythmic. In sync with Joe's
dialog: breathing.
text: Totally calm, Joe sits Indian-style across from the snake.
text: His eyes never leave it.

scene_heading: INT. BIAGGIO’S ROOM - DAY

scene_heading: INT. BIAGGIO’S KITCHEN - DAY
text: Biaggio enters. His FATHER sits at the table, shucking
text: clams. The following dialogue is in Italian, subtitled.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: Dad?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Sit.
text: He pushes a bowl of closed clams toward Biaggio, and hands
text: him a shucking knife. Biaggio goes to work.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: Have you ever quit at anything?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: +.-and did it hurt?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Well, there’s good quitting and bad
dialog: quitting. I quit drinking soda:
dialog: good quitting. I quit law school:
dialog: bad quitting. Do you see?
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Did you ever quit on a friend?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: You should never quit on a friend,
dialog: Biaggio.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: But say you did. Say you abandoned
dialog: him, left him alone even after you
dialog: swore your allegiance...would you
dialog: go to hell for that?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Of course.
text: Biaggio nods. He already knew this.
dialog: 102.
scene_heading: EXT. BIAGGIO’S HOUSE - DAY
text: Long lens. Biaggio walks outside, and into his yard. Pull
text: back to reveal a REARVIEW MIRROR in the foreground...
text: We’re watching from Frank’s car. Biaggio blasts out of his
text: backyard on a bicycle. Frank shifts into gear.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUTH OF THE WOODS - DAY
text: Biaggio parks dismounts, and walks it into the woods. Once
text: Biaggio has wiped frame, reveal Frank’s car PULLING UP in the
dialog: background...
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS - DAY
text: Biaggio emerges from the path, sighs with relief at the sight
dialog: of the house. Biaggio’s POV: The house looks better than
text: ever. Refinished. Fire burning. The colors seem more
text: vibrant, the angles of incident more square.
speaker_heading: FRANK'S VOICE
dialog: Kid, what the fuck is this.
text: Biaggio turns around; his eyes could not be wider.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS - SAME TIME
text: On Joe’s face: Asleep, slumped against the wall. In the same
dialog: clothes as the last time we saw him.
speaker_heading: FRANK'S VOICE
dialog: How long? The whole time??
text: Joe startles AWAKE.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO’S VOICE
dialog: Omerta. The Sicilian code of
dialog: silence.
speaker_heading: FRANK'S VOICE
dialog: No! No Omerta!
text: Widen out: He’s sitting on the floor, as he was when the
dialog: snake was there...but there’s no snake.
speaker_heading: FRANK'S VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: Joe?!
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Dad! Don’t come in! Seriously!
speaker_heading: FRANK'S VOICE
dialog: It's over Joe! It’s the end of the
dialog: world!
text: Frank barges through the door, holding Biaggio.
speaker_heading: JOE FRANK
dialog: Dad, I mean it! There’s a Bullshit, Joe! Start
dialog: snake in here-- explaining. From the
dialog: beginning.
dialog: Then:
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: Infamata.
text: The serpent is COILED AT BIAGGIO’S FEET. Staring at him.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Whoa...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (hushed)
dialog: Biaggio. Be still. Be calm.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: I’m going to run. I feel that I
dialog: have to.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Biaggio, do not run.
text: A beat of tension. WE hear hissing. Then...Biaggio runs.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: shit--
text: The snake is upon him instantly. Biaggio trips over himself
text: and falls into the corner.
text: Biaggio’s POV: the copperhead, coming straight for him.
text: He SCREAMS. It bites him in the CHEEK.
dialog: On Joe: horror.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (nauseous )
dialog: Oh. Oh my fucking Christ.
text: Biaggio faints.
dialog: 104.
text: The snake turns toward Frank, and Frank immediately breaks
text: into a run.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Dad! No--
text: Frank throws furniture and debris, trying to deter it.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: The fuck is wrong with this thing?!
text: The snake is upon him. Frank braces himself...
text: Suddenly, JOE’S SHOE pins the snake to the floor, landing
text: just beneath its head. It can’t move, can’t bite. A machete
text: enters frame, decapitating it. Snake blood everywhere.
text: Joe drops the machete, panting. A shaken hero.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Joe...
text: They stare at each other, overwhelmed. Then:
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO’S VOICE
dialog: Hello.
text: Of course, Biaggio. They rush to him; he’s flush, breathing
text: heavy. Bleeding from the puncture wounds in his cheek.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: Did it get me?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: A little bit.
dialog: (to Frank)
text: Dad, bury the head and body outside
text: in two separate holes. The loose
dialog: venom can attract other ones.
text: But Frank doesn’t move. He still has so many questions.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, Dad.
text: Joe moves to the cooler.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: How do you feel?
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: Very different.
dialog: 105.
text: Joe hands him a plastic bag holding a bloody cut of raw meat.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Here. You need protein.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS - CONTINUOUS
text: Frank scoops dirt over the snake’s body. He emits various
text: sounds of disgust. Joe and Biaggio appear in the doorway.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (to Frank)
dialog: We've got fifteen minutes. Did you
dialog: drive here?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah..(seeing something) Whoa...hey
dialog: hey hey--

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Biaggio!
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: Hm?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You’re pissing yourself, kid!
text: Biaggio looks down - it’s true.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: I can’t feel it. I can’t feel
dialog: anything down there...
text: Biaggio’s knees buckle. He VOMITS.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Shit.
text: Systems are failing. Biaggio’s nose begin to run.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: (out of it)
dialog: I’m open. I’m open now, Joe. The
dialog: snake opened me...
text: Sweat, pooling at Biaggio’s collar bone. His eyes tear up.
text: Everything’s leaving him.
dialog: 106.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE IN THE WOODS - CONTINUOUS
text: Biaggio crawls to the sofa. Joe helps him over, rubs his
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Okay, okay. Let it all out.
dialog: (to Frank)
dialog: Can you pull the car up to here??
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Impossible...
speaker_heading: JOE~
dialog: (to Biaggio) Hey -- do you feel up
dialog: to a little walk, buddy?
text: Biaggio closes his eyes and pisses himself again.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: He’s really...he can’t hold it,
dialog: huh.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You’ve gotta carry him, Dad.
text: Frank grimaces at Biaggio, who is soaked in himself.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Dad, he will die.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Joe, come over here. Come here.
text: Joe walks over.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes, we could carry him. We could
dialog: drive him to the hospital and hope
dialog: for the best. We could put him
dialog: through all that. Or we could just
dialog: choose to remember him as he was.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Dad!
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT TO:
text: Frank lifts Biaggio off the sofa, across his shoulders. He
text: flares his nostrils, nauseated.
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Ah fuck. He smells like vinegar.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER
text: Frank carries Biaggio through the woods. Joe runs just ahead

scene_heading: INT. FRANK'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Joe and Biaggio in the backseat. Frank speeds, slaloming
text: through traffic. The windows are open.
speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: (weak)
dialog: Wash me...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: He keeps asking me to wash him!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Godammit Biaggio! We can’t wash
dialog: you! We don’t have the tools!
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: Clean my skin. Make my skin clean.
text: Frank's POV - he blows through a yellow that just turned red.
text: The camera flashes. He will get a ticket.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Fuck.
text: In the backseat:
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: I’m open, Joe.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I know buddy. I know you’re open.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: Joe...what if I start to do other
dialog: things, Joe?
dialog: Joe looks
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What are “other things”?
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: Other things. Ass things.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Ass things...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What’s he saying? He gonna shit
dialog: the car??
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: I don’t want to shit the car.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: None of us want that. We’re all on
dialog: the same team here.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You_gotta fight this thing, buddy.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Just don’t think about it. Keep
dialog: talking to me. Just talk. We’re
dialog: almost there and then you'll get
dialog: medicine and the pain will stop.
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: (at death’s door)
dialog: Joe...I’m sorry...I’m sorry I led
dialog: him here...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It's okay man. You didn’t know.

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yeah...

speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Biaggio, do you--

dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh God. Oh Jesus. His mouth, Dad!
dialog: He’s foaming at the mouth!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Uh...That’s good! That means his

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Biaggio! Fuck! Dad, he’s dead!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (truly worried)
dialog: Okay, we’re here. We’re here Joe.

scene_heading: INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

text: Joe and Frank watch, concerned, helpless.
text: We FADE TO WHITE.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Joe washes his face. A knock on the door. Joe opens it;
text: Frank in the hallway.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Try these.
text: Frank hands him a bag from the hospital gift shop. Quick
dialog: cuts:
text: Joe brushes his teeth
text: He puts on deodorant.
text: He looks at himself in the mirror, shirtless, slaps his
text: exposed rib cage once.
text: Joe puts on a fresh $4 T-shirt. It says “NYC.”
dialog: 110.
text: Joe regards a razor...looks at his moustache...puts the razor

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: BIAGGIO

text: Suddenly, VICKI enters.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Oh my God. Look at you!
text: Then, right behind her...KELLY.
text: And PATRICK.
text: Joe tenses up. This is the first time we’ve seen Patrick
text: ‘back.’ He looks good, put some weight back on. Haircut.
text: Pressed shirt.
text: Joe and Patrick see each other, then look away.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Are you okay, Biaggio?
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: I am. My body is healing. Some
dialog: have suggested it wasn’t my time.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Yeah -- you’re fourteen man.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Joe, are you hurt?
text: Joe shakes his head “no.” Awkwardness in the room.
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: (at Biaggio’s bandage)
dialog: Is that where it bit you?
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: It is.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: My God...what did it feel like?
speaker_heading: BIAGGIO
dialog: It felt like, when you’re expecting
text: great pain, and then it happens.
text: As the girls question Biaggio, Joe and Patrick make, then
text: retract, eye contact. They have no idea how to be around
dialog: each other.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - NIGHT
text: Joe eats a slice of pizza. Two more pizza crusts litter his
text: plate. There’s also an empty bowl of nachos.
text: We see the cafeteria is virtually empty except for Joe and
text: Frank watches his son eat. As Joe finishes, Frank pushes his
text: own plate of spaghetti toward Joe.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: How long was Biaggio dead?
speaker_heading: JOE
text: Six minutes.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (unimpressed)
dialog: Six minutes? Oh.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: That’s a long time to be dead, Dad.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Not in the scheme of things.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You...uh...you did a good job, Joe.
dialog: You did a good job back there.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: A good job?
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You saved my life. You saved
dialog: Biaggio’s life. I dunno. A lesser
dialog: man would have panicked.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh. Thanks.
text: A beat between father and son.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Are you still hungry? What do you
dialog: want. Anything.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Honestly? I would love seafood.
speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: FRANK

dialog: plan on being around.
dialog: If you
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yeah. I should be.
text: Frank nods. Relief.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: So who's that girl Patrick was

dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Looks that way.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Good for him. What are you guys,
dialog: fourteen?
dialog: (then)
dialog: If you think parents and school and
dialog: all this shit is stressful, wait
dialog: until you start carving the Ham.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: The Ham. Like, the Ham?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah, like HAMphibian. HAMbush.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You know about the Ham?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah, I mean...I thought it was

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL, HALLWAY - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: INT/EXT. FRANK’S CAR - NIGHT

dialog: 114.
text: They stop at a red light. Joe glances over; he’s in line
text: with Patrick, who isn’t looking.
text: Then, Patrick looks. Joe immediately turns away. He turns
text: back; now Patrick turns away.
text: Joe leans back. Staring ahead. He glances over, subtly,
text: trying not to move his head, and sees Patrick smiling and
text: shaking his head.
text: Joe looks over. Finally, he smiles too.
text: Joe shoots Patrick the finger. Patrick nods and returns it.
text: Joe gestures behind Patrick toward Kelly. He inserts his
text: pointer finger into the end of his fist, then raises his
text: eyebrows inquisitively.
text: Patrick laughs, shakes his head no.
text: Joe then places his hands on his chest. A new question.
text: Patrick shrugs and smiles coyly.
text: Joe's eyes widen. Really?
text: Patrick shrugs again, with a big shit-eating grin.
text: Joe laughs.
text: The light changes. Joe’s car starts to inch up. They’re
text: losing sight of each other. Frank senses the activity.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What’s going on over there?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (facing forward again)
dialog: Nothing. Patrick’s being an idiot.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - CONTINUOUS
