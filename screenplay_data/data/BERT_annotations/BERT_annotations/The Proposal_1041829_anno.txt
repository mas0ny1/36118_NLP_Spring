scene_heading: INT. MARGARET'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING
text: The sun peeks over the horizon. There's a stunning view of
dialog: Central Park from this apartment, but whoever lives here isn't
dialog: watching.
text: As we wander through expensive furniture, a steady THUMP, THUMP,
text: THUMP echoes through the apartment. Eventually, we see MARGARET
text: MILLS (37) running on a treadmill, watching "The O.C." on Tivo,
text: and reading a manuscript.
text: She sprints as the clock on her treadmill goes to zero. As she
text: hits a button to stop the treadmill...
scene_heading: INT. WOMAN'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING
text: A hand knocks an alarm clock off a table to shut it up. RICHARD
text: PAXTON (26) wakes up on pink sheets and looks around to figure
text: out where he is. There are multiple framed pictures of the same
text: model on the walls.
text: Richard looks at the clock and gets up quickly when he sees it is
text: 6:16 AM. Unfortunately for him, he is very hung over.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Where are my clothes?
text: A blob beneath the sheets next to him answers. SIMONE is the
dialog: model on the walls and is really, really hot.
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: In the kitchen. I think. Can I make you
dialog: some coffee?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Sorry, I gotta go. I'm late.
text: Richard hurries to the kitchen. Socks are on the butcher block
text: next to an empty champagne bottle. Shoes in the sink. He finds
text: his pants on the floor and puts them on.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: Have you seen my belt?
text: Simone looks around and sees it tied to her headboard.
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: In here.
text: She unties the complicated knot. Richard comes back half
text: dressed. He swallows a little throwup.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Baby, I just can't do this anymore.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
scene_heading: INT. MARGARET'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING
text: Margaret puts on a black suit jacket. Definitely not off the
text: rack. She makes sure she looks perfect in the mirror, and moves
dialog: off.
scene_heading: INT. WOMAN'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING
text: Reflected in the mirror above Simone's bed, Richard hurriedly
text: gets dressed as he talks.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You're just too much for me. And I'm just
text: another guy too wrapped up in his job.
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: Fine. Whatever. Just go.
text: Richard sits down on the bed and locks eyes with Simone.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Let's not end it like that. It's been an
dialog: amazing three and a half weeks. Thank you.
dialog: And you should know that you have the nicest
dialog: ass I've ever been with.
speaker_heading: SIMONE
speaker_heading: (TOUCHED)
dialog: You mean it?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I do. It's magnificent.
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: I work really hard on it.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I know you do.
text: Simone smiles and begins to seductively pull the sheets off her
text: naked body. Richard shakes his head "no" and smiles.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: I really gotta go.
scene_heading: INT. MARGARET'S KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING
text: CRUNCH. Margaret eats a bowl of Kashi and soy milk while
text: standing and reading a manuscript. Her eyes remain glued to her
text: reading as she rinses out her bowl and puts it in the dishwasher.
text: Her apartment is very quiet.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MORNING
text: HONK! A cab blares its horn at Richard as he runs across the
text: street. His suit is rumpled and he checks his watch.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
scene_heading: INT. MARGARET'S LOBBY - MORNING
text: DING! The elevator opens and Margaret strides towards the exit
text: and the DOORMAN (60). Before Margaret gets to the door, her CELL
text: PHONE RINGS. She checks the caller ID and excitedly points at
text: her phone as she lets it ring.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (to phone)
dialog: I knew you would call! Now come on, tell me
dialog: what I want to hear. Give it to me.
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: You have to put it by your mouth so people
dialog: can hear you.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You should get paid extra for being so darn
dialog: funny.
text: Margaret straightens her jacket, answers the phone, and walks out
dialog: the door.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: This is Margaret.
scene_heading: INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY - MORNING
text: Richard bursts into the skyscraper and runs into a Starbucks.
scene_heading: INT. STARBUCKS - MORNING - CONTINUOUS
text: Two coffees lie in wait for Richard. JILLIAN, a lovely Barista,
text: smiles as he hurries to the counter.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: You're running late today.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Jillian, you are the best.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: If you think I'm good at this, you should
dialog: use that coffee cup sometime.
text: As he runs out the door, Richard glances at his cup and smiles at
text: Jillian's name and phone number written in Sharpie.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: See ya tomorrow.
scene_heading: INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY - MORNING - CONTINUOUS
text: The elevator doors ahead of Richard begin to close.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
text: Mercifully, a hand reaches out and stops the doors. Inside the
text: packed elevator, Richard's CO-WORKERS look sleepy. One
text: particularly frustrated co-worker confronts Richard.
speaker_heading: CO-WORKER #1
dialog: How long is she gonna make us come in by
dialog: seven?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: She doesn't exactly consult with me on these
dialog: things.
speaker_heading: CO-WORKER #1
dialog: Well this sucks ass.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Welcome to my nightmare.
text: The doors close as...
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MORNING
text: Margaret crosses the street and talks on the phone.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You've been thinking about our talk because
dialog: I'm right. Everyone does publicity. Roth,
dialog: McCourt, Russo. Hell, Chabon practically
dialog: whores himself. Know what they have in
dialog: common? A Pulitzer.
dialog: (off answer)
dialog: Yes, I know you haven't done it in twenty
dialog: years, but that's how long it's been since
dialog: you've written a book this good.
scene_heading: INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - MORNING
text: Richard bursts out of the elevator and passes a clock reading
text: 6:56 and a sign that announces "Royce Publishing." He hauls ass
text: through a sea of cubicles. Along the way, grumpy employees
text: begrudgingly nod their good mornings.
text: At his desk, he pulls a tie out of a drawer and puts it on
text: without looking in the mirror. Noticing his wrinkled suit, he
text: pulls out a SPRAY BOTTLE out of the same drawer, sprays it all
text: over his body, and then on his head to help mat down a tricky
text: cowlick. Satisfied, he hurries into a nearby corner office.
scene_heading: INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY - MORNING
text: Margaret walks into the lobby and continues talking. Employees
text: avoid her and pile into the elevator.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'm not pushing so you'll sell more books,
dialog: I'm pushing because it'll be a crime if the
dialog: world doesn't hear that you wrote a genius
dialog: piece of literature. Do the publicity.
text: Margaret waits for an answer and smiles when she hears "yes."
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: You're making the right decision! Great
dialog: news. Going into an elevator, think I'm
dialog: going to lose you...
dialog: Margaret hangs up. Never give them a chance to change their
dialog: mind.
scene_heading: INT. MARGARET'S OFFICE - MORNING
text: Richard races to Margaret's computer and turns it on. He picks
text: up papers strewn about the room. He goes back to the computer,
text: and opens computer programs.
scene_heading: INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - RECEPTION - MORNING
text: Margaret exits the elevator and receives an enthusiastic...
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Good morning!
text: Margaret quickly walks by and gives only the slightest nod.
scene_heading: INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - MORNING
text: Margaret walks through the cubicles and nods hello to her staff,
text: who all look busy on the phone. When she turns the corner, they
text: stop their "conversations" in mid sentence and hang up.
scene_heading: INT. MARGARET'S OFFICE - MORNING
text: Richard stares at the printer as a sheet of paper comes out. A
text: clock above the door reads 7:00 AM. The paper clears the printer
text: and Richard grabs it quickly.
scene_heading: INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - MORNING
text: Margaret opens the door to her office, and finds Richard standing
text: at attention with papers in one hand and coffee in the other.
text: Her office looks perfect.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You've got a conference call in thirty, a
dialog: staff meeting at nine, and your immigration
dialog: lawyer sent some papers for you to sign.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Cancel the call, move the meeting to eight,
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: (big news)
dialog: I got Frank to do publicity.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Nice job.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: When I want your praise, I'll ask for it.
dialog: Is Bob here?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I'm sure. You want him on the phone?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: We're going to his office. Grab your pad.
text: Richard calmly backs out of the office...
scene_heading: INT. RICHARD'S DESK - CONTINUOUS
text: ... but once he's out of Margaret's sight he runs to his computer
text: and sends an instant message to the office "The Banshee is headed
dialog: to Bob's office."
scene_heading: INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - MORNING
text: As the message pops up on computers, the quiet office jumps to
text: life as everyone in a cubicle picks up their phone and resumes
dialog: their imaginary conversations.
scene_heading: INT. RICHARD'S DESK - MORNING
text: Margaret comes out to Richard's desk. She notices his coffee cup
text: with Jillian's number on it. She takes special notice of the
text: hearts that dot the "I's" in Jillian.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: That's cute. You gonna call her today?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What?
text: Richard doesn't know what Margaret is talking about, until she
text: nods at the cup. He's embarrassed.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Are you bored here? Do you need little
dialog: distractions like that to get you through
dialog: the day?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Uh...
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You have another late night out?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
text: Margaret starts walking. Richard quickly catches up, worried
text: because he doesn't know where she's going with this.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'm firing on all cylinders and you've got
dialog: hearts on your coffee cup, wicked bed head,
dialog: and a wrinkled suit that you wore yesterday.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Oh. Well, it won't be wrinkled for long.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You'll magically unwrinkle?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You have magic pants?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: No. I've sprayed them with stuff that will
dialog: take care of the wrinkles.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Does this work on more than just your pants?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Anything that's wrinkled.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Buy me some.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Will do.
text: Richard makes a note. Margaret stops to make her point.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I don't care what or who you do on your own
dialog: time, but when you walk through that door
dialog: you represent me, and I will not have your
dialog: personal life affect you at work. If you
dialog: want me to think of promoting you to editor,
dialog: I need you sharp, focused and professional.
dialog: Got it?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Got it.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Great. Now you're just a prop in here, so
dialog: don't say a word.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
scene_heading: INT. BOB'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Margaret and Richard enter Bob's office, which is decorated with
dialog: beautiful antiques and first edition books. But unlike
text: Margaret's office, this one isn't in the corner.
text: Margaret nods at Richard to shut the door. BOB (42) wears a prim
text: bow tie, circular tortoise shell glasses, and the air of
dialog: superiority.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Hey, Bob.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Ah. Our fearless leader and her liege.
text: Margaret smiles.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'm lettin' you go, Bob.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Pardon?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You're fired.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What? What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: This isn't working out.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You can't...
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I asked you repeatedly to get Frank to do
dialog: publicity. You said it was impossible.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: It is. He doesn't do publicity.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I just talked to him. He's in.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: But...
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: No more buts, Bob. I've been chief for a
dialog: month and a half, and this is the third time
dialog: you've dropped the ball. You didn't even
dialog: call to ask him.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: All you had to do to was pick up the phone.
dialog: That's it. Now I'll give you two months to
dialog: find a new job, and then you can say you
dialog: resigned. I won't tell a soul, my lips are
dialog: sealed.
text: Margaret nods at Richard and he opens the door.
scene_heading: INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - CONTINUOUS
text: Margaret and Richard walk a few steps. Margaret looks straight
text: ahead and whispers to Richard.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: What's he doing?
text: Richard turns around and takes a peek. Bob gets out of his chair
text: and comes to his door.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
text: He's up and about to pop.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Oh Bob, don't do it...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: YOU POISONOUS BITCH! YOU CAN'T FIRE ME!
text: The office stops. This is going to be good. Margaret turns
text: around with a disappointed look on her face. She's deadly calm.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: What are you doing? I gave you a civilized
dialog: way out of this.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: This is because I'm your competition.
dialog: Because I threaten you!
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Oh, Bob. You could never threaten me. I'm
dialog: firing you because you're lazy, entitled and
dialog: incompetent. I'm firing you because you
dialog: don't work hard. So if you know what's good
dialog: for you, you'll shut up, take off that
dialog: ridiculous bow tie, find a bar and get
dialog: drunk. Because if you say one more word,
dialog: Richard here is going to call security and
dialog: have you thrown out on your ass. Are we
dialog: perfectly clear?
text: Bob nods.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: Good. Now I've got work to do, so if you'll
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
text: Margaret and Richard walk away and speak in hushed tones.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: We need to call his authors and explain what
dialog: happened. And get Frank's publicity
dialog: schedule figured out pronto.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: No problem. I'll just cancel my trip this
dialog: weekend.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I gave you the weekend off?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: It was my Grandma's ninetieth birthday.
dialog: But no big deal. You were right before, I
dialog: need to stay focused. Professional.
scene_heading: INT. RICHARD'S DESK - DAY
text: Richard is on the phone with his mom explaining why he can't come
text: home this weekend. He sounds like an annoyed teenager.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Well tell gammy that I'm sorry.
dialog: (waiting to speak)
dialog: Mom, she's making me work this weekend.
dialog: It's not like I volunteered.
dialog: (waiting to speak)
dialog: I'm sure dad is pissed.
text: Margaret comes to Richard's desk. He tries to wrap it up.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: I have to go. Yeah. No, I'm not going to
dialog: do that! No. Sorta. Mom! No. Bye.
text: Richard hangs up the phone.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: Sorry about that. Damage control.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: She tell you to quit?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: No. No.
dialog: (off Margaret's look)
dialog: Um. Yes? But as I've explained to them,
dialog: after three years together, you're the only
dialog: person on the planet who can make me editor,
dialog: so that's the way it is.
text: Richard's phone rings and he picks it up.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: Your 10:55 is here. Mr. Gilbertson?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Who is this guy?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: He said you knew each other. You weren't
dialog: sure so you told me to set a meeting. We
text: rescheduled on him four times.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Go get him. But he's out of here in five
dialog: minutes, we've got work to do.
text: Margaret leaves and goes into her office.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: I'll charge up the cattle prod.
scene_heading: INT. MARGARET'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Margaret reads as MR. GILBERTSON (48) sits down. He's an intense
text: man in a bad suit. He sits in silence until Margaret looks up.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: Margaret. Good to see you. I know how busy
dialog: you are. Congrats on the promotion. Read
dialog: about it in P-W.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yeah. Well, those announcements are silly,
dialog: aren't they? Like everyone who needs to
dialog: know doesn't know already.
dialog: Margaret has been trying to figure out how she knows this man,
text: but now gives up.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: Have to admit, I can't place where we know
dialog: each other from.
text: Gilbertson smiles. He didn't expect her to remember.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: Three years ago? We worked together.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Don't have it...
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: Remember "Dandelion's Desire?"
text: Margaret gets excited.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Oh my God, you read that manuscript with me?
dialog: That book is legend. Without a doubt the
dialog: worst ever written.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: You think?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: It was a fever dream! 900 offensive and
dialog: pointless pages, with like 30 characters,
dialog: who all had some weird disability. The
text: paraplegic pornographer, and the stuttering
dialog: scientist? Oh! And there was the asthmatic
dialog: alien chapter -- written entirely in his
dialog: alien language.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: I believe there was a glossary...
text: Margaret laughs, caught up in the memory.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Did you see the pass letter I wrote him?
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
speaker_heading: (QUOTING)
dialog: "Your grammar is impeccable, but please do
dialog: not confuse superior form with writing
dialog: ability. Save your skills for the office
dialog: newsletter, you sir, are no writer."
text: A beat. Margaret says matter of fact...
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You wrote the book.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: I did.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You're Dante Dickens?
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: One of my nom de plumes.
text: Gilbertson paces. Margaret stays seated, at a loss.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. You
dialog: obviously were spending a lot of time
dialog: writing, I just thought you should channel
dialog: all that passion into something else.
text: Gilbertson smiles as he pulls a BADGE from his coat pocket.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: Ms. Mills, I'm with U.S. Citizenship and
dialog: Immigration Services, and I'm deporting you
dialog: to Canada.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Excuse me? What? This is a mistake. I've
dialog: lived here since 1981. I'm applying for
dialog: citizenship.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: You need citizenship now? After the big
dialog: promotion?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yes. And all the papers are in.
text: Gilbertson pulls out a stack of papers and throws them down.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: Well, my office is going to reject your
dialog: paperwork on Monday, while we investigate
dialog: whether your behavior is well disposed to
dialog: the good order and happiness of the United
dialog: States. We must protect our sovereignty.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'm a threat to the sovereignty of the
dialog: United States?
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: Yes, and unfortunately my investigation will
dialog: take awhile, so you'll be deported while
dialog: your case winds through the system.
dialog: (as if he doesn't know)
dialog: Will it affect you at work if you aren't
dialog: allowed to enter the U.S. for the next two
dialog: to three years?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: "Affect me at work?" I'll lose my job!
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: (mock sympathy)
dialog: Ahhhh. That's a shame. Too bad we can't
dialog: work something out.
text: Margaret stops looking at her file. It all becomes clear.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Oh, no. No, no, no. I won't do it.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: Do what, Ms. Mills?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 14.
text: Gilbertson smiles. She's quick.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: I've edited it down. It's better.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Well then, get it published at another
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: They all just don't get me.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: All?
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: Well not all. Two hundred fifty, two
dialog: hundred sixty-one. Ish.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'll be fired and laughed out of the
dialog: industry if I publish that book.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: I'm at the end of my rope, Ms. Mills. I'm
dialog: an author. Not some bureaucrat who brings a
dialog: lunchable to work everyday and lives in his
dialog: brother's garage. You're the last stop, and
dialog: I'm desperate.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I will never publish your book. Ever.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: There's no need to make this difficult. I
dialog: don't turn in your file until Monday...
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: This is blackmail. I'll go to your boss.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: I've spent two years preparing for this day.
dialog: Don't you think I've thought of that?
text: Now Margaret is pacing, while Gilbertson happily looks on.
text: Suddenly, the door opens and Richard bursts in, acting like there
text: is an "emergency" so Margaret can end the meeting.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Excuse me, Ms. Mills, risk management needs
dialog: you right away.
text: The sight of Richard inspires Margaret. She turns to Gilbertson
text: with a wicked grin on her face.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Know what, Dante? I'm not going anywhere!
dialog: We're getting married!
text: Richard has no idea what Margaret is talking about.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Who's getting married?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: We are!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You and him?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Stop playing around, honey.
text: Margaret is all smiles. Richard is very confused.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: Mr. Gilbertson is from the INS. I told him
dialog: about us. About us getting married.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: You are marrying your male secretary?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Assistant.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: You are marrying your male assistant?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (matter of fact)
dialog: We're in love. We tried to fight it. When
dialog: it's right, it's right.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: And this has nothing to do with my visit
dialog: here today?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Nope. True love. Got it bad.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: (to Richard)
dialog: You. Is this true? Are you marrying
dialog: this... woman?
text: Margaret comes over to Richard and holds his hand.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Of course we are.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 16.
text: Painfully long beat where Richard doesn't answer. Margaret
text: squeezes Richard's hand hard.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Uh-huh.
text: Margaret smiles and snuggles up to Richard so he can put his arm
text: around her. Richard is truly afraid.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: (more of a question)
dialog: I'm, uh, marrying my boss?
text: Margaret turns and puckers her lips to let Richard know that
text: she's ready for a kiss. The two slowly begin to come together.
text: Just as their dry lips are about to touch, Richard chickens out
text: and kisses the hair on the top of her head.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: Five years in prison and a two hundred and
dialog: fifty thousand dollar fine.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: If I prove you're lying, you go to federal
dialog: prison for five years.
text: Gilbertson takes out a pad and takes notes.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON (cont'd)
dialog: (to Richard)
dialog: You. Do you know what you're getting
dialog: yourself into? We're going to put you in a
dialog: room and ask you every detail that a real
dialog: couple would know about each other. Do you
dialog: even know her favorite color?
text: Richard doesn't answer. Margaret encourages him on with a thinly
text: veiled threat.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: C'mon. Answer. You don't have a choice.
text: Richard doesn't want to do this, but relents.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Plum.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: You mean purple?

speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON

speaker_heading: RICHARD

speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: Childhood pet name?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Miss Mittens.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Are we done here?
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: Who knows you're getting married?
text: Margaret interrupts.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: No one. With us working together we decided
dialog: it would be too much of a scandal if anyone
dialog: knew.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: Have you at least told your family?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
speaker_heading: (EXCITED)
dialog: My parents are dead!
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: How convenient. So you're not telling
dialog: anyone that you are getting married?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Nope.
text: Gilbertson smiles and puts down his pad.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: Pathetic. Four questions and I've got
dialog: enough to send you to prison...
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: We're telling his family this weekend.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: We are?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yes. We are. We're surprising them...
dialog: (trying to remember)
text: ...at his Grandma's 90th birthday party.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: And where's that going to be?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (no idea)
text: At Richard's parent's house.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: And where's that located?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (still no idea)
text: In his hometown.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Sitka.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: Is that on Long Island?
text: Only Richard has the answer. Margaret tries to cover.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Why don't you tell him?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Alaska.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: You're going to Alaska this weekend?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (Alaska???)
dialog: Yes. Of course we're going to Alaska.
dialog: That's where Richard is from.
text: Gilbertson begins to walk around. He's getting worked up.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: You think you can beat me with this B-S
dialog: story? Forcing your secretary...
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Assistant.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: ...assistant to marry you and then
dialog: conveniently telling his family for the
dialog: first time this weekend?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'm sorry, Dante. Did you not prepare for
dialog: that?
text: Margaret puts her arm around Richard and waits in silence.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 19.
text: Enraged, but with no recourse for now, Gilbertson checks his
text: appointment book and writes down some information.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: The INS will see you both in ten days for
dialog: your official interview. Your stories
dialog: better match up on every account.
text: Mr. Gilbertson gets right up in Margaret's face as he gives her
text: the piece of paper.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON (cont'd)
dialog: Cross all your T's and dot your I's with
dialog: this ruse, Ms. Mills.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: There are no "T's" or "I's" in "Love" Mr.
dialog: Gilbertson.
text: Gilbertson leaves and shuts the door hard. Margaret goes back to
dialog: her desk like this is all in a days work.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: Why are you from Alaska? Sweet Jesus,
dialog: that's inconvenient. So here's what's going
dialog: to happen. We'll play boyfriend and
dialog: girlfriend this weekend for your parents and
dialog: that should be enough for this INS
dialog: interview.
text: Richard doesn't react. Margaret doesn't notice.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: So you need to figure out the travel,
dialog: schedule a justice of the peace for next
dialog: week, and get my lawyer on the phone.
text: Margaret takes a sip of her coffee and makes a face.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: But first, run down and get me another
dialog: coffee from your girlfriend, this is cold.
text: Margaret holds out her coffee cup. Richard doesn't move.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: Hello? Richard? Richard!
text: Richard says his first words since Gilbertson left.
speaker_heading: RICHARD

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Richard, come back here.
text: Margaret tries not to make a scene.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: Richard. Richard.
text: Richard pushes the elevator button in front of reception.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: Come back to the office!
text: Richard can't take it. He gets up in Margaret's face.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You shut up. You just lost your "I get to

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Well, we need to talk.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You want to talk with me? Fine. Grab your
dialog: broom and let's go.
text: Margaret is dumbstruck. The receptionist is shocked. The

speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: Watch my phones!
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Your plan is psychotic.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Well I'd rather poke my eyes out than play
dialog: pretend girlfriend, but this is the big
dialog: time. Sometimes you need to sack up.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Aren't Canadians supposed to be nice?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You wanna be an editor? You need to make
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: OK. Fine. Then if we "make this happen"?
dialog: You're promoting me to editor.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'm doing what?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: We go to Alaska and lie to my family? I
dialog: risk going to jail? Well, you're making me
dialog: editor for that. I mean, did you think I'd
dialog: do this out of the kindness of my heart?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You work for me!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You know, during my employee orientation,
dialog: the HR rep didn't mention anything about me
dialog: marrying you.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Look, I came to this town alone and with
dialog: nothing. I've worked my ass off for fifteen
dialog: years and this guy wants to ruin me because
dialog: he wrote the shittiest book of all time? No
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Nice story Little Orphan Annie, but that
dialog: sounds like your problem. Not mine.
text: Margaret is stuck. Richard really does have the upper hand.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Fine. You take me to Alaska this weekend,
dialog: and I'll make you editor. Deal?
text: Margaret puts out her hand to shake, Richard takes it.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: And I'm not sleeping on your parent's hide-a-
dialog: bed, we're staying in a hotel. Do they even
dialog: have hotels in Alaska?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: No. But they have huts. Teepees really.
dialog: And you have to poop in a bucket. But
dialog: otherwise, just like the Four Seasons. But
dialog: with bears.

speaker_heading: RICHARD

speaker_heading: MARGARET

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Almost.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
speaker_heading: (PATRONIZING)
dialog: Well let's finish big people business before

text: Dejected, Richard goes back to work.
scene_heading: INT. SEATTLE AIRPORT - DAY
text: As they change planes in Seattle, Margaret walks quickly and

text: Up ahead at the gate, a GATE ATTENDANT (Female, 50's) ANNOUNCES
text: final boarding to Sitka. Margaret gets off her phone.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: So what do I need to know up there? Bullet
dialog: points.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I told âem we've been dating for six months.
dialog: We've kept it a secret from everyone...
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: ...and that you're a naughty minx in the

text: Margaret is not amused by Richard's attempt at humor.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
speaker_heading: (VENOMOUS)
dialog: Don't make me hate you.
text: Margaret hands her boarding pass to the attendant and breezes

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Bringing her home to meet my folks. She's
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 23.
text: Tangled in the bags, Richard struggles to find his boarding pass.
text: The impatient attendant is getting frustrated.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: I've got it here. Sorry. Guess I'm a
dialog: little flustered too. Haven't been home for
dialog: awhile, hope they like her!
text: The gate attendant smiles.
speaker_heading: GATE ATTENDANT
dialog: (heard it all)
dialog: I don't care, sir.
text: Richard finds his boarding pass and hands it over.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: OK then. You're a sweet lady. Thanks.
text: Richard hustles to the plane as they shut the doors.
scene_heading: INT. PLANE TO ALASKA - DAY
text: Margaret takes her seat and sits next to a well dressed HANDSOME
text: MAN who is READING A BOOK. She notices the title and he catches
text: her stare. Margaret explains.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'm sorry, I hate it when people stare at
dialog: what I'm reading. It's just... I worked on
dialog: that book.
speaker_heading: HANDSOME MAN
dialog: You wrote it?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Edited it. It was one of my favorites.
speaker_heading: HANDSOME MAN
dialog: Well you did a good job. It's great.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You don't see many guys with that book.
dialog: You, uh, read a lot of love stories about
dialog: Roman concubines?
speaker_heading: HANDSOME MAN
dialog: My ex-girlfriend gave it to me. I travel a
dialog: lot for work. I'll read anything...
speaker_heading: MARGARET
speaker_heading: (SUSPICIOUS)
dialog: Ex-girlfriend, huh?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: HANDSOME MAN
dialog: (smiling, embarrassed)
dialog: OK, you got me. I'm a closet romantic. But
dialog: let's keep that between us.
text: Margaret smiles and makes the "my lips are sealed" motion. Just
text: then, Richard lumbers onto the plane with the bags.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: There you are. Give me my lap top.
text: Richard untangles the bags and gives Margaret her computer bag.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (re: book)
dialog: Hey, he's reading...
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I know, Richard.
text: Richard turns around and puts the bags in the overhead
text: compartment. The Handsome Man turns to Margaret.
speaker_heading: HANDSOME MAN
dialog: Did you two want to sit together?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Sit together with who?
text: The Handsome man nods at Richard.
speaker_heading: HANDSOME MAN
dialog: Your boyfriend?
text: Margaret points to Richard indignantly.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You mean him?
text: The Handsome man nods. Margaret tries to set the record
dialog: straight.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: No. No. No. He's my assistant.
speaker_heading: HANDSOME MAN
dialog: You're bringing your assistant all the way
dialog: to Alaska?
text: Richard smiles, happy that Margaret has to answer.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Oh, you can tell him the truth.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Well, he's... indispensable.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 25.
text: The Handsome man isn't buying it.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: And gay. Takes care of me everywhere I go.
dialog: Call him my queen mother. Aren't you my
dialog: indispensable gay queen mother?
text: Margaret shoots Richard a nasty look. He has to go along.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: That's me.
text: Richard turns to close the overhead compartment.
speaker_heading: HANDSOME MAN
dialog: You're awfully nice to fly him first class.
text: Margaret nods her head and agrees. It sucks to be Richard.
scene_heading: EXT. AERIAL OF SITKA - DAY
dialog: We see the natural beauty of South Eastern Alaska. Sitka is an
text: island the size of Maui. Only an eight mile stretch of coast is
text: inhabited, the rest is complete wilderness. At the center of the

text: dotted with fishing boats. Gorgeous.
scene_heading: INT. JETWAY - DAY
text: Margaret and the Handsome Man chat like old friends while they

scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: A big banner that reads: CONGRATULATIONS RICHARD AND MARGARET!!!
text: with wedding bells and a graphic showing the journey from New
text: York to Sitka. The banner is being held up by a group of 30
text: PEOPLE with excited looks on their faces.
text: Richard's mom DEBBIE (60) is front and center. She's a sweet
dialog: lady who cooked Richard a hot breakfast every morning until he
dialog: left the house.
text: GRANDMA ANNIE (89) also waits. She's lived a long time and
dialog: doesn't have a lot of time to screw around.
text: When they see Richard, they SCREAM. Margaret's face drops.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: There he is!!! Where's Margaret?
text: Richard blanches white. Margaret looks back with eyes that say
dialog: "What the hell is going on?"
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: HANDSOME MAN
dialog: (noting banner)
dialog: That's sweet.
text: Richard goes over to the group. Margaret keeps walking.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What are you guys doing here? What's with
dialog: the sign?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: So you're "just dating," huh? I can't
dialog: believe you didn't tell us!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Didn't tell you what?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: We're not saying anything until you let us
dialog: meet Margaret. Now, where's our girl?
text: Richard looks around. Margaret keeps her head down and tries to
dialog: avoid eye contact.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Uh. Margaret? You need to come over here.
dialog: Like now. Honey.
text: The Handsome Man sees Richard with the banner people, calling for
text: Margaret to come over. Margaret winces.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I have to go now.
speaker_heading: HANDSOME MAN
dialog: (putting it together)
dialog: What kind of sick shit is this?
text: Margaret nods. This would be a tough one to explain.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Have a great life.
text: Margaret walks toward the group. Richard puts out his hand and
text: silently pleads for Margaret to hold it. At the last second, she
dialog: takes it.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Everyone, this is Margaret.
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE
dialog: It's nice to meet you. Now, do you prefer
dialog: being called Margaret, or the Dragon Lady?
dialog: We've heard it both ways.
text: Everyone laughs.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Annnie!
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE
dialog: It's not like he hasn't told her that he
dialog: used to call her the Dragon Lady. They're
dialog: getting married.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (real "casual")
dialog: Now, ah, where did you hear that? The whole
dialog: "getting married" thing?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Oh, that man from the government. Gilber-
dialog: something. Said he was checking up on you
dialog: two. Said it was technicality, because
dialog: Margaret was from Canada.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What, ah, did you tell him?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Well for one thing, that you were in a lot
dialog: of trouble for not telling us that you two
dialog: were getting married!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: No. Really. What did you say?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Just that you were coming up here this
dialog: weekend. That we hadn't seen you in a
dialog: while, and that we'd heard about Margaret
dialog: for years, but that we'd never met her.
text: Debbie turns to Margaret and takes both of her hands.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE (CONT'D (cont'd)
dialog: The way that Richard talked about you? I'll
dialog: admit, I didn't see this coming.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Me neither.
text: Debbie picks up some of the bags and starts walking toward the
text: exit. Everyone else follows her lead.
speaker_heading: ON THE MOVE
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: So why all the silly secrecy?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: It wasn't a secret. We didn't tell anyone.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Well, is your family just anyone?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: No, I didn't mean...
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I should be mad at you two. But, but... I'm
dialog: just so excited!
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (re: group)
dialog: Uh, is everyone coming to our hotel?
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE
dialog: Oh, we cancelled your reservation. You're
dialog: part of the family now. Family doesn't
dialog: stay at a hotel. Also, we've got another
dialog: little surprise for you two.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Surprise? Another surprise?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: She's not good with surprises.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'm really not good with surprises.
scene_heading: EXT. SITKA AIRPORT - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Debbie stops. Sitka Airport is very small, so they are already
text: outside by all the cars parked in the loading zone.
text: Debbie and Annie excitedly look at each other.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Well you two...
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE
dialog: ...you're getting married this weekend!
speaker_heading: MARGARET RICHARD
dialog: What? What?
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
text: The whole kit and caboodle.
dialog: Margaret gives both these women a look that says "what are you
dialog: talking about?"
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: When Gilber-something told us you were
dialog: getting married...
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: ...God rest their souls...
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE
dialog: ...or friends...
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: ...we decided to give you a wedding.
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE
dialog: Engagement party tonight...
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: ...and the wedding tomorrow at midnight.
text: Debbie and Annie wait to see what Margaret thinks.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Are you witches?
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE
dialog: Just quaint. During the solstice it's good
dialog: luck. It's an Alaskan thing.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: We've planned everything.
text: Margaret isn't sold, so Grandma Annie goes for the clincher.
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE
dialog: I'm old, Margaret. I don't have much time
dialog: left. Richard lives so far away, and I
dialog: never see him. Now I find out he's getting
dialog: married, and I have a chance to see my one
dialog: grandchild's wedding day. It's a dream come
dialog: true for me. A dream come true. Please let
dialog: me see Richard get married before I die.
dialog: Please.
text: Long beat. Richard doesn't know what Margaret is going to say.
text: Margaret doesn't know what Margaret is going to say. Finally,
text: she goes to speak, but can only get out... two big thumbs up.
text: The crowd cheers.
scene_heading: EXT. SITKA - DAY
text: A procession of cars makes its way through town.
scene_heading: INT. PICKUP - DAY

text: Margaret and Richard sit as far away from each other as possible
text: in the backseat of the extended cab.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 30.
text: Margaret tries to get Richard's attention, but he's looking out
text: the window. Finally she pinches him and Richard jumps. He gives
dialog: Margaret a "what did you do that for" look.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
speaker_heading: (MOUTHING)
dialog: The Dragon Lady!?
text: Richard shrugs.
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE
dialog: To tell you the truth, we had a lot of the
dialog: plans made already for my birthday. Just a
dialog: few changes here and there, and we made this
dialog: weekend a wedding.
text: Margaret stares at Richard.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'm a lucky woman.
text: Margaret does her best to smile.
scene_heading: EXT. DOCK - DAY
text: The cars park in a lot in the middle of nowhere, near a small

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'm not getting out of this car until you
dialog: tell me where we're going.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Come on, it'll be OK. I promise.
text: Richard points to a small island about a mile away.
scene_heading: EXT. YACHT - DAY
text: Everyone rides on a 75 foot yacht. Lots of polished wood and
text: chrome. Someone passes out beers on board, and the mood is
text: festive. Margaret takes a look around at the surreal scene.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Who are you people?
text: Richard lets Margaret wonder.
scene_heading: EXT. PAXTON DOCK - DAY
text: The ship docks and we get our first glimpse of the Paxton Estate.
text: It sits above the rest of the wooded island and is as tasteful as
text: a 15 bedroom Alaskan mansion can be.
text: Richard's father, GEOFFREY (60) waits on the dock. He is a bear
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: So you must be Margaret. We've heard a lot
dialog: about you. All of it bad.
text: Margaret tentatively walks off the yacht in her none to practical
text: sling backs.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY (cont'd)
dialog: I mean, I almost shit myself when I heard he
dialog: was marrying the devil woman.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I thought it was the dragon lady?
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: Either way.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Hey dad.
text: Richard shakes his father's hand. It's a little stiff.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: Welcome home. Good to see âya.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You too.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: Been a while.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Yeah. You'd think you could make it to the
dialog: airport to mark the occasion.
text: Grandma Annie interrupts.
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE
text: Help him with the bags Geoffrey.
dialog: (to Richard and Margaret)
dialog: Let's get you two settled.
text: As Richard and Margaret move towards the house, Annie shoots
text: Geoffrey a look that says "be nice".
scene_heading: INT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY
text: The house is decked out in sheik Alaskan decor. Somehow, it
dialog: makes bear heads and deer antlers look good. Everything is first
text: class. Margaret is a little awe struck.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: We'll show you around later.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Uh huh.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 32.
text: Out of nowhere, a small HUSKY PUPPY startles Margaret and jumps
dialog: on her.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Balzac! Down! No!
text: Debbie pulls the dog off of Margaret and pushes him toward the
text: kitchen. Margaret tries to take it in stride and make small
dialog: talk.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: What a great name. Balzac's "Lost
dialog: Illusions" is one of my favorite novels.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Oh. Well, this Balzac's got epididymitis.
text: Debbie makes two big circles with her pointer fingers to
dialog: illustrate how Balzac really got his name.
text: Not understanding, Margaret looks over at Balzac as he walks
dialog: away. Off her shocked reaction, we understand right away that
text: this puppy Husky is an anatomic marvel.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE (cont'd)
dialog: No one on the island wanted him when he was
dialog: born. We figured he deserved a home.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: And don't let him outside, or the eagles
dialog: will snatch him.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: C'mon dad...
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: I mean it. They come out of that
dialog: rehabilitation center mean. And hungry.
speaker_heading: RICHARD

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Thank you. Where's Richard's room?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Oh, we took down his "shrine" years ago.
dialog: And don't worry, I'm under no illusion that
dialog: you two haven't slept in the same bed
dialog: before. Richard can sleep here too.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Oh, let's not upset Grandma Annie.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: It was her idea. Anything to help get her a
dialog: great grandchild.
text: Richard shrugs his shoulders behind his mother.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Great. You know, I've gotten used to his
dialog: breathing at night.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I thought so dear.
text: Debbie leaves and shuts the door. Margaret reverts back to her
dialog: old self.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'm about 15 seconds from bitch.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Calm down.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: What is going on here?
speaker_heading: RICHARD

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You think I'd bring you here if I did?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Well, we just gotta tell âem.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Tell âem what?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Tell âem the truth. About us.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Wrong answer. No way.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: What do you mean no way? This is crazy.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: No, crazy was lying to the federal officer.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Well I don't like this.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Well I'm not making my Gammy an accomplice
dialog: to a Class C felony! For one second could
dialog: you not be so selfish?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Selfish?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Yeah, you know, that thing you do where you
dialog: only worry about yourself every second of
dialog: every day?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: How is it selfish to tell the truth?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Look. We're awful, awful people. In the
dialog: last forty eight hours, we've lied to...
dialog: everyone. We need to protect the people
dialog: downstairs. We can't ask these good,
dialog: decent, not awful people to lie for us.
dialog: Let's keep the darkside to ourselves.
text: Margaret takes a second to make up her mind.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Fine. But if we do this, you need to stop
dialog: lying to me.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What've I lied to you about?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Why did you tell me that you were poor?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I never said that.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Well, you never told me you were rich.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: When does that come up?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I don't know, how about, "Hi, my name is
dialog: Richard, I'm an Alaskan titan of industry."
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Well, maybe I didn't tell you because you
dialog: would have fired me if you knew.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: No I wouldn't.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Come on! You're always yammering on about
dialog: your scrappy childhood, and how you fought
dialog: for those soccer scholarships, and how the
dialog: rich kids made fun of you in prep school for
dialog: working in the kitchen. You're totally anti-
dialog: rich.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'm not anti-rich.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Oh yes you are! And you know what makes it
dialog: worse? You have money!
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I earned...
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: ...every penny I have. Blah, blah, blah.
dialog: You need new material.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Hey. Watch it. You're still my assistant.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You were going to promote me anyway.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Sure of that?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Nope. Not at all.
text: Margaret takes a look at herself in the mirror.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Well, come on. If we're going to do this,
dialog: we might as well put on a show.
scene_heading: INT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY
text: Downstairs, the engagement party is in full swing. The starched
text: wait staff stands out in the crowd, because the raucous party-
text: goers are all dressed in flannel, T-shirts and baseball hats.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 36.
dialog: Ponytails rule for the women, and almost all the men have shaggy
dialog: hair and beards. No dress code here.
text: Like the house, the party is first class. Ice sculptures melt,
text: champagne is served on silver trays, and the buffet overflows
dialog: with salmon and king crab.
text: Margaret works the crowd like a pro and holds court with some
text: WELL WISHERS, Richard's parents, and Balzac.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I went to Union college in upstate New York.
dialog: It's a small liberal arts school that no one
dialog: has ever heard of.
text: Richard comes to the group and hands Margaret a drink.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: (looks at glass)
dialog: Lime?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Be right back.
text: Richard leaves to fetch lime wedges. Geoffrey elbows Debbie in
dialog: the side, "What was that?"
speaker_heading: WELL WISHER #1
dialog: How long have you been with your company?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Since I graduated college.
text: Richard comes back with the lime. Margaret takes it and doesn't
dialog: say thank you.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: She's been there since she was nineteen.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: Nineteen? Wow. That's how long?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Oh, who's counting...
text: Geoffrey could let it go, but wants to push her.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: No. How many years is that? Exactly.
text: Margaret gives Geoffrey the slightest look.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Well, let me see. That would be sixteen or
dialog: seventeen years. Exactly.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: I was never good with big numbers. That
dialog: makes you... thirty six now?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Just turned thirty seven. Born on May 20th.
dialog: I'm a Taurus.
text: Geoffrey and Margaret give each other a smile.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: (to Richard)
dialog: I need some protein.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: There's some salmon.
text: Margaret shakes her head no.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: Crab?
text: Margaret nods yes. Richard steps away to find a waiter.
text: Geoffrey watches his son do Margaret's bidding.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: Keep him on a short leash, huh? Does he
dialog: roll over when you whistle?
text: Debbie hits Geoffrey.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: He's just being a good host.
text: Richard comes right back with a waiter in tow. For Geoffrey's
text: benefit, Margaret makes a point to thank Richard.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Thank you, honey. You're being so sweet.
text: Richard is surprised, but remembers they're a couple.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Uh, sure. Honey.
speaker_heading: WELL WISHER #2
dialog: So you just got some big promotion?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'm editor in chief, now.
text: Richard tenderly puts his arm around Margaret.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
speaker_heading: (BEAMING)
dialog: I'm so proud of my girl.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 38.
text: From behind them, a melodic, etherial VOICE interrupts.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Editor in chief? You're marrying up,
dialog: Richard.
text: Everyone turns around to find GERTRUDE THURMAN (26). She is
text: Grace Kelly in Patagonia and Timberland. Adding insult to
text: injury, she doesn't have eyeliner on.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Gert!?
text: Richard snaps his arm back, hitting Margaret in the head, and
text: spilling her tonic water on her shirt. He doesn't notice what
text: he's done, and leaves Margaret. She's peeved.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
speaker_heading: (FLUSTERED)
dialog: What are you? What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: Your dad made me come.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: From Chicago?
text: Gertrude laughs. The group watches these two see each for the
text: first time in years. There is instant chemistry, and Richard has
dialog: forgotten about Margaret completely.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: No. I live here now.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You what?
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: I moved back about six months ago. I'm
text: teaching second grade. At Baranof.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Did your husband move up here too?
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: Uh, no. I, ah, got divorced.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Oh my God. I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: Me too. But hey, we're being rude, I wanna
dialog: meet the bride.
text: Gertrude leaves Richard and goes to Margaret.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE (cont'd)
dialog: Hi, I'm Gertrude. But call me Gert.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You're a Gertrude?
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: A family name from hell.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'm sure it's been a curse.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: Gert and Richard were quite the item in high
dialog: school.
text: Gertrude instantly dismisses Geoffrey's reminiscence.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: Oh Please. Ancient history.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: Feels like yesterday to me.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: (ignoring Geoffrey)
dialog: So tell me everything. I hear it wasn't
dialog: exactly love at first sight?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Not exactly...
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE
dialog: Now Richard, what I want to know is how you
dialog: proposed.
text: This grabs the group's full attention. Everyone loves to hear a
dialog: story like this.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Well...
text: Richard hasn't recovered from seeing Gertrude.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: Uh, uh, um, I...
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: Yeah. How did you pop the question?
text: Richard is a deer in the headlights. This is getting ugly.
text: Margaret sees that Richard is going to crumble, and steps in.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Can I tell this one, honey?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Uh. Sure.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'm an early, early riser and go for a run
dialog: everyday. Well, it was our six month
dialog: anniversary and I was out for my normal jog
dialog: in the park, when who do I see in a horse
text: drawn carriage, wearing a tux, and waiting
dialog: for me halfway through my run? Richard! So
dialog: I ran up to the carriage and asked him what
text: was going on, and he put his finger to his
dialog: lips and says, "shhhh." So there I am in my
text: jogging clothes, next to the most handsome
dialog: mute in the world - have you seen him in a
dialog: tux? - riding like a sweaty princess and
text: smiling ear to ear. Couple minutes later,
dialog: we arrive at Tavern on the Green. Best
dialog: part, we're the only people in the place
dialog: because Richard got them to open up early.
dialog: Well, we go to our table, sit down, and just
text: as the sun starts to peek above the trees,
text: this beautiful man gets down on one knee,
dialog: and says "I didn't want one more sunrise to
dialog: go by without you knowing that you are the
dialog: light of my life, and that I would be the
dialog: luckiest man in the world if you would be my
dialog: wife. Margaret Mary Mills, will you marry
dialog: me?"
text: The group is silent, waiting for the clincher.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: I said yes.
text: The group gives a collective "ahh". Grandma Annie takes both
text: Margaret and Richard by the hand.
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE
dialog: You are a good boy Richard, and you make me
dialog: very proud. I love you Richy.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I love you too, Grandma.
text: Grandma hugs the couple. Everyone smiles except Geoffrey and
dialog: Gertrude.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: So did this happen before or after the INS
dialog: agent came sniffing around?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: What is wrong with you? I'm sorry Margaret.
text: Margaret doesn't miss a beat.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Oh please. I'd wonder too. Honestly, my
dialog: lawyers have been dealing with all of this.
dialog: When you told us at the airport it was the
dialog: first time I'd heard about it. I'm so
dialog: embarrassed.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Don't be, dear. Geoffrey's just an ass.
text: While Debbie apologizes, Margaret gives Richard a little wink
dialog: that says "I've got this under control". The moment is
text: interrupted when Richard pulls out a RINGING CELL PHONE. He
text: takes a step back and answers quietly so no one can hear.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
text: Margaret Mill's phone.
dialog: (off answer)
dialog: One second please.
text: Richard comes back to the group and hands Margaret the phone.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: It's our friend, Frank.
dialog: Richard's tone let's Margaret know there's a problem.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Excuse me, I'll just be a second.
text: Margaret takes the phone and exits out French glass doors that
text: lead to the backyard. She leaves the door open, and doesn't
text: notice Balzac follow her outside.
scene_heading: EXT. PAXTON BACKYARD - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Margaret goes far from the house so no one can hear. Balzac
text: follows her all the way, but Margaret doesn't see him.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Don't be a cliche, Frank. Don't be the
text: wishy washy writer who changes his mind
dialog: every two seconds.
text: Margaret notices Balzac, but ignores him. The dog starts YAPPING
text: to get attention. She walks away, but Balzac continues barking.
text: Annoyed, she gets down face to face with the puppy and puts the
text: phone against her chest so Frank doesn't hear.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: (to Balzac)
dialog: Sit and be quiet!
text: Balzac sits and pouts. Margaret walks away and puts the phone
text: back to her ear.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: I fired Bob because he didn't have your best
dialog: interest in mind. Our job is to help you
dialog: succeed. He wasn't doing that.
text: Margaret continues to listen to her writer whine, when she
text: notices an EAGLE soaring in circles above her and Balzac. Not
text: sure what to think, she looks back at Balzac and sees him
text: peacefully sit in the grass.
text: She then looks up and sees that the eagle is gone. Margaret
text: shakes her head, looks back at Balzac when --
text: WHOOSH! The eagle snatches Balzac by the scruff of the neck, and
text: takes off. Margaret jumps.
text: There is no one to help, so she chases after the dog and eagle.
text: She stays calm on the phone.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: Could you hold on just a second?
text: With no other option, Margaret throws her cell phone and hits the
text: eagle suspended 20 feet above her. The eagle drops Balzac and
text: Margaret catches him. Balzac looks frightened.
text: Tucking Balzac away like a furry football, she runs to her phone
text: and picks it up.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
speaker_heading: (NONCHALANT)
dialog: Sorry, dropped my phone.
text: Margaret looks up and sees that the eagle has resumed flying in
text: circles above her. She decides to wrap up the call quick and get
text: back to the house.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: Frank, I don't want to sell you on anything.
dialog: But know this. This book is your legacy...
text: Margaret looks up and sees the eagle dive towards her and Balzac
text: again. She runs.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: ... and-I-think-you-should-be-the-one-to
dialog: introduce-your-legacy-to-the-world. Call me-
dialog: tomorrow-with-your-decision. My-phone is-
dialog: always-on. Talk-to-you-soon.
text: The eagle bears down on them with talons out. Just as the eagle
text: is about to strike, Margaret sticks out her hand with the phone
text: to fend back the eagle. To her surprise, the eagle grabs
text: Margaret's phone and flies off. Margaret freaks.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 43.
text: Panicked, she takes Balzac in both hands and puts him up to the
dialog: eagle as an offering.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: Take the dog! Take the dog!
scene_heading: INT. PAXTON ESTATE
text: Inside, the elegant party carries on.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Where's Margaret? We need to go.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Go where?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
text: It's a surprise. Girls are going into town.
dialog: And the boys stay here. I told you, we've
dialog: planned everything.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
text: Um. She's outside.
text: Debbie and Richard turn around and look out a picture window.
text: They see Margaret running with Balzac above her head.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Oh that's sweet, she's playing with my
dialog: Balzac.
scene_heading: EXT. PAXTON BACKYARD - DAY
text: The eagle is long gone, but Margaret is still running with the
text: dog trying to bait it back.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: This is a delicious dog, Mr. Eagle. C'mon,
dialog: bring back the phone.
text: Richard calls out from the house.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: The eagle took my phone!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Are you drunk?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Your dad was right! The eagle tried to take
dialog: the dog, so I saved it, then it came back
dialog: and took my phone.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Did the dingo eat your baby, too?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Frank's going to call me on that phone. I
dialog: need it!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Relax. I've got your information backed up
dialog: on the laptop. I'll just get you a new
dialog: phone and switch the number. No problem.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Now come on. You're going somewhere with my
dialog: mom and the girls.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'm not going anywhere.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You want a new phone? You're going.
scene_heading: EXT. PIONEER BAR - DAY
text: The Pioneer bar is a classic Alaskan bar, decorated with pictures
dialog: of every fishing vessel that has made Sitka its home.
text: But tonight estrogen rules, as all the patrons are women CHEERING
text: for an oiled, toned, and BEARDED MAN in a tiny thong who gyrates
text: to the beat of Prince's "Sexy Motherfucker." On stage with the
text: dancer, Margaret tries to not look miserable in her NOVELTY
scene_heading: BACHELORETTE PARTY WEDDING VEIL WITH DEVIL HORNS.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Work it Hank!
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: Is that a salmon down your pants?
text: The room laughs as Hank works his crotch millimeters away from
text: Margaret's face. Margaret remains straight faced.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Definitely not a salmon.
text: The women encourage Hank on as he moves Margaret's hands to his
text: wiggling ass and gives her a feel. She can't help but give and
text: embarrassed smile. Finally, the song ends and Hank goes into the
text: splits. Thrilled, the room gives him a standing ovation.
text: Margaret plays along and gives Hank a kiss on the cheek. She
text: begins to get off the stage, but Hank takes her by the hand.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Ah, ah, ah. I was just the warm up.
text: Hank sits Margaret down, and blindfolds her with a scarf.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE
dialog: Just sit there dear.
speaker_heading: MC
dialog: Don't be shy ladies, tip well and often,
dialog: show Hank how much you appreciate his
dialog: assets! And now... Ramone!
text: The room goes silent as a middle aged RAMONE comes on to the
text: stage. He has a pot belly, threadbare thong and a thin mustache.
text: Ramone's dance has a Latin theme to it, and he's very good at it.
text: Margaret is oblivious.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: What's that smell?
text: Margaret finally takes off her blindfold, and finds Ramone about
text: an inch away from her face.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: (belly laugh)
dialog: Ahhh!!!
text: Margaret falls out of her chair and her scream frightens Ramone.
text: After the initial scare he composes himself and wags his finger
text: at her naughty behavior.
speaker_heading: RAMONE
dialog: You are a naughty devil.
text: Ramone goes to work another part of the stage, and when he turns,
text: Margaret jumps off the stage and joins the ladies.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Good lord.
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE
dialog: Ramone was the only male dancer on the
dialog: island for years. No one has the heart to
dialog: tell him to hang it up.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Want me to do it?
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE
dialog: Thank you dear, but let's keep it our
dialog: secret.

dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 46.
scene_heading: EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - SHORELINE - DAY
text: Snow capped mountains watch 20 MEN in short sleeves hit golf
text: balls into the ocean. Green pontoon rafts bob in the water, made
text: up to look like golf greens. Golf balls are stacked in pyramid
text: formations at every hitting area.
text: Richard comes down from the house to join the group. Geoffrey
text: jokes with MR. MAGUIRE (60's, good natured) as they hit balls.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: ...yeah, Debbie found these eco-balls that
text: dissolve in the water.
speaker_heading: MAGUIRE
dialog: How does she come up with this shit?
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: She just does. I stopped trying to figure
dialog: out how.
text: Geoffrey and Mr. Maguire see Richard coming their way. Mr.
text: Maguire yells at Richard like the old family friend he is.
speaker_heading: MAGUIRE
speaker_heading: (JOKING)
dialog: I'm mad at you, son!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Why's that, Mr. Maguire?
speaker_heading: MAGUIRE
dialog: You fly up here and don't call me?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Sorry âbout that.
speaker_heading: MAGUIRE
dialog: What good is me owning an airline if I can't
dialog: give you free tickets?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You're right. Don't know what I was
dialog: thinking...
speaker_heading: MAGUIRE
dialog: Damn, straight. Don't let it happen again!
dialog: (hands Richard a golf club)
dialog: Here, you take over. This game is for
dialog: pussies, I'm getting a drink.
text: Mr. Maguire leaves, and Richard and Geoffrey are left alone with
text: one another for the first time. Things are awkward between
text: father and son, and Richard begins hitting balls to avoid
text: conversation. Geoffrey finally makes small talk.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: Maguire's stepping down in January. He's,
dialog: uh, handing things over to Matty.
text: Richard gives his dad a look. He knows where this is going.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: That's great for them.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: So. How's work with you?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Good. Busy. You know.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: I do. I do. Hey, did I tell you that we're
dialog: opening a little office in Japan?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Congratulations.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: We're not just a mom and pop operation
dialog: anymore. We're going global.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Uh-huh.
text: Geoffrey stops hitting golf balls for a second. He's been
text: thinking about this moment for a long time.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: I could really use your help.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Dad. Please. I'm in New York. Margaret's
dialog: in New York. We have jobs.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: I know. I know. It's just...
speaker_heading: RICHARD
speaker_heading: (CHALLENGING)
dialog: It's just what?
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: You're only a secretary.
text: This pisses Richard off immediately.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Again with the secretary thing! I've told
dialog: you, I'm an assistant!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: Just because you call yourself an
dialog: "assistant" doesn't mean you're not really
dialog: just a secretary.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Well if I'm "just a secretary", why would
dialog: you want me up here anyway? Sounds like
dialog: you're doing great without me.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: It's not like that and you know it.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Then how is it? Explain it to me.
text: Geoffrey looks around to see if anyone is listening.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: Last week, a man stuck his finger up my
dialog: butt...
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: This man was a doctor?
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: ...and it got me thinking about you.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I'm not sure this is coming out right.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: Just shut up for a second, okay? I want you
dialog: to have what I built. But I'm running out
dialog: of time to show you things.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Stop being so dramatic.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: I'm not being...
dialog: (takes a hard line)
dialog: I need you to stop dicking around down there
dialog: and get serious.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: So this is all about what you want?
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: That's not what I said.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: And me in New York with Margaret? That
dialog: isn't serious?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: One day the woman is the Antichrist, and the

dialog: is that serious?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Things change, dad.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
speaker_heading: (INDIGNANT)
dialog: Things change?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Things change.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: Things change?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Yes. Things change.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: Things change. That's your explanation?
dialog: Know what I think? I think you banged your
dialog: boss and fell in love, that's what I think.
dialog: Some sorta mommy complex.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Nice, dad. We gotta have these Cosby
dialog: moments more often. This is great.

text: just over the horizon.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: They can be a little overwhelming, but
dialog: they're great people.
speaker_heading: MARGARET

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Chicago, right?
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: Yeah. Since college.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: And now you're back?
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: Six months now. Call me crazy, but I love
dialog: it. Think I'm back for good.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Really? I don't know. Don't you miss...
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: Neimans? Starbucks? Escalators?
text: Margaret laughs. She likes this woman.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE (cont'd)
dialog: Yeah. I miss it. Believe me, growing up I
dialog: never thought I'd end up divorced and back
dialog: here teaching at my old elementary school.
dialog: That was always Richard's plan.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: For you to get divorced?
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: (smiles, remembering)
dialog: No. I was going to teach, he was going to
dialog: run his dad's business. He was like a
dialog: little old man. Had it all worked out.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Are we talking about the same guy?
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Well, Richard's such a player.
text: Gertrude looks confused.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: I mean he was a total player. Before we
dialog: started dating. Six months ago.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: That surprises you?
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: Did he ever tell you why we broke up?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: We don't really talk much about stuff like
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: Oh. Well I should shut up...
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: No, no. Please. I mean, we are getting
dialog: married. I want to know these things.
text: Gertrude looks down a little embarrassed.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: He proposed to me. When we were seniors.
text: Margaret laughs.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... He proposed
dialog: to you in high school?
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: He bought this sweet little ring, and got
text: down on his knee. It was so cute.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You must have...
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: ... freaked out? Oh you bet. I broke up
text: with him on the spot.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I would hope so.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: After getting rejected the first time, I
dialog: can't imagine how hard it was for him to get
dialog: up the courage to ask you.
text: Margaret just smiles, feeling guilty about lying when Gertrude is
dialog: being so honest with her.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE (cont'd)
dialog: Anyway. The idea that my little old man
dialog: could be a player... It's just not the
dialog: Richard I knew. Good thing you're making an
dialog: honest man of him again.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 52.
text: Gertrude toasts Margaret and knocks back the rest of her beer in
text: one swig. She has a hard time finishing it off.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE (cont'd)
dialog: Well I'm empty. I'm going to go get
dialog: another. I think I hear Ramone wrapping up,
dialog: let's get back to the girls.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'll be right in.
text: Margaret smiles and turns to the ocean. Gertrude goes inside.
text: Then, to herself, Margaret silently whispers.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: We are awful people.
scene_heading: EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY
text: THWACK! An axe slams down and splits a log in two. Hands
text: quickly place another log down and THWACK! We pull back to find
text: Richard playing the role of executioner. He's still mad after
text: talking to his dad, and is taking it out on the firewood. Rage
text: Against the Machine plays on his iPod and he's in his own world.
text: Behind him, the girls return to the island on the family yacht.
text: Their mood is light, and they chat amongst themselves. Debbie's
text: mood deflates when she sees Richard.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
speaker_heading: (SHOUTING)
dialog: Richard! Honey! Is everything OK?
text: With his back to the girls and the iPod on, Richard doesn't hear
dialog: or see the girls.
text: Annie shakes her head. Something is up.
scene_heading: INT. PAXTON ESTATE FAMILY ROOM - DAY
text: Geoffrey pets Balzac as he watches SportsCenter on a sixty inch
text: plasma television. The ladies arrive and Annie and Debbie step
text: in front of the TV, blocking his view. Margaret watches from the
text: door, not sure what is going on.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: Excuse me? I'm watching that.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Why is Richard chopping wood?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: And don't play dumb. What did you do?
text: Geoffrey is uncomfortable answering in front of Margaret.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: Nothing. I didn't do anything... will you
dialog: please move.
text: The showdown intensifies. Margaret excuses herself.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I am so tired.
text: Balzac GROWLS when he hears Margaret's voice. He's still mad.
text: Margaret just smiles.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: Think I'm going to take a shower and clean
dialog: off Ramone's bubble gum body oil. Thanks for
dialog: a great night.
text: Annie and Debbie smile graciously and wish her good night. Once
text: she's gone, they turn their death stare back to Geoffrey. He
text: looks genuinely unnerved.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: Stop looking at me like that!
scene_heading: EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY
text: Richard continues to listen to his iPod, and has worked up quite
text: a sweat. He's stacks the last log, takes off his soaked through
text: shirt, and gets a whiff of himself. Ew. He stinks.
scene_heading: INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY
text: Margaret walks into the private bathroom attached to her room and
text: shuts the door. We hear her turn on the shower.
scene_heading: INT. PAXTON ESTATE FAMILY ROOM - DAY
text: Geoffrey defends himself to Debbie and Annie with great
text: conviction. Richard walks right by the fighting trio, but
text: doesn't notice anyone. He continues to listen to his iPod and
text: his attention is focused on the controls, as he looks for the
dialog: playlist "Songs I Shouldn't Like" and Charlene's hit "I've Been
dialog: to Paradise, But I Haven't Been to Me."
scene_heading: INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY
text: IN THE BATHROOM
text: Margaret turns off the shower, pulls back the curtain and reaches
text: for a towel. All she finds is a miniature unabsorbent decorative
dialog: hand towel. Shit.
speaker_heading: IN THE BEDROOM
text: Richard enters the room smiling as Charlene sings "...I've been
dialog: undressed by kings and I've seen some things that a woman ain't
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 54.
text: IN THE BATHROOM
text: Margaret's ears perk up. The bathroom is a disaster because she
text: has dripped water everywhere looking for a towel.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Richard, is that you?
speaker_heading: IN THE BEDROOM
text: Richard opens the armoire next to the bed and pulls out an
text: incredibly absorbent Egyptian cotton towel.
text: IN THE BATHROOM
text: Margaret cracks the door open to see what the sound was. Richard
text: isn't there, but she sees the armoire open and the towels waiting
dialog: for her. How did she miss that?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Richard, are you...
text: Then out of nowhere, Balzac (he followed Richard in) startles
dialog: Margaret.
speaker_heading: BALZAC
dialog: Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap!
text: Margaret slips on the wet floor and falls on her ass. Her foot
text: kicks the door open as she retreats from the vengeful puppy.
text: ON THE BEDROOM'S DECK
text: Richard is oblivious as he hangs his wet clothes over a rail on
text: the deck attached to the room. He makes sure that no one is in
text: the yard, pulls down his shorts, and hangs them up as well.
text: IN THE BATHROOM
text: Naked, wet, and starting to get a little pissed off, Margaret
text: manages to pull herself up by the toilet. She wants a towel
text: badly, but Balzac guards the doorway. She tries reason.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'm sorry bout the eagle. But I saved you.
text: Balzac won't listen to reason and barks angrily. Margaret grabs
text: the ceramic top of the toilet tank to protect herself.
text: ON THE BEDROOM DECK
text: Richard calmly turns around and sees that the bathroom door is
dialog: open. That's weird.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 55.
text: IN THE BATHROOM
text: Margaret holds the top of the toilet tank like a baseball bat,
text: ready to strike. Balzac will not be intimidated, and continues
text: to growl and not let her out of the bathroom. Margaret knows
text: that she can't hit a dog, and looks for another way out. Then
text: she spots the bathroom mat.
speaker_heading: IN THE BEDROOM
text: Richard saunters towards the bathroom, wearing only his iPod.
text: IN THE BATHROOM
text: Balzac puts a paw onto the bath mat.
text: Margaret slowly puts back the toilet top.
text: Balzac gets to the center of the bath mat, and Margaret pulls
text: hard, sliding the bath mat and Balzac to the back of the
text: bathroom. With Balzac out of the way, she runs out, closes the
text: door behind her and...
speaker_heading: IN THE BEDROOM
text: WHAM! Margaret crashes into Richard and they fall to the floor.
text: It takes a second for them to realize that they are holding each
text: other buck naked.
speaker_heading: MARGARET RICHARD
scene_heading: Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
text: The two quickly separate and spastically try to cover up. A
text: rapid fire back and forth ensues.
speaker_heading: MARGARET RICHARD
dialog: Why are you naked? Why are you wet?
speaker_heading: MARGARET RICHARD
dialog: Don't look at me! You tackled me!
speaker_heading: MARGARET RICHARD
dialog: It was the dog! You're blaming the dog again?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Will you just hand me a towel!
text: Richard looks for a towel, but forgets he's naked. When he looks
text: under the bed, Margaret shrieks and covers her eyes..
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: You're flashing brain!
text: Richard quickly changes positions. Out of desperation, he pulls
text: the entire comforter off the bed. He throws it Margaret's way,
text: and she wraps herself in it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: You can cover up any time!
text: Richard cups the beans and franks and backs up to his clothes by
dialog: the window.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: Explain yourself!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I didn't know you were home! I was outside
dialog: chopping wood!
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You didn't hear me?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I had my iPod on!
speaker_heading: (CONFUSED)
dialog: Why did you jump me?
text: Richard reaches his clothes and pulls on his shorts.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I didn't jump you.
dialog: (off Richard's look)
dialog: I didn't mean to jump you. I didn't know
dialog: you were here.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You didn't see me?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I was running from the dog!
text: Richard looks at Margaret suspiciously.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Wait. Were you tryin' to seduce me?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Oh please! Don't flatter yourself.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Mmm-Hmmm.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Go take a shower. You stink.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Fine. But don't come sneaking in there.
dialog: You're still my boss. That'd be sexual
dialog: harassment.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 57.
text: Richard goes to the bathroom and shuts the door. Margaret takes
text: a breath, but is startled when the door suddenly opens back up
text: again. Richard has Balzac cradled in his arms and scratches his
text: neck. He gently puts him outside their room.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: There you go, buddy. Go on and play before
dialog: she makes a coat out of you.
text: Richard shuts the door and goes into the bathroom. Without
text: looking back, Richard gets the final shot.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: Puppy hater.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Richard grabs all the pillows, cushions and blankets he can find
text: to create himself makeshift bed on the floor.
text: Margaret turns out the lights, leaving the room still bright with
text: the sun still shining outside. She gets into her bed.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'm never gonna to get to sleep.
text: Richard pushes a button and motorized metal blinds come down
text: outside the window. The sunlight is instantly blocked out and
text: the room is pitch black.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: Oh. Well. Thanks.
text: Richard settles into his pathetic excuse for a bed. The two
text: silently lie awake and stare at the dark ceiling.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: It was kinda weird seeing you naked.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Can we not talk about this?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I'm just saying. It was weird.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: It wasn't weird.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: How was that not weird?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Because we're... like teammates.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: We're like teammates?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: We are teammates. And teammates see each
text: other naked in the locker room. All the
dialog: time. It's not a big deal.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Well, if we're teammates can I sleep in the
dialog: bed?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Good night, Richard.
text: The two lay awake in silence for another beat.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Margaret?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Don't take this the wrong way.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Okay...
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You're a very beautiful woman.
text: Margaret smiles with her head turned away from Richard.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Get some sleep Richard, big day tomorrow.
scene_heading: INT. PAXTON ESTATE - OFFICE - DAY
text: Not a creature is stirring, except for Geoffrey who creeps into
text: his office. He shuts the door softly and goes to his gigantic
text: oak desk. He finds a phone number with a New York City area code
text: on a piece of paper. He dials.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: Yes. Mr. Gilbertson? My name is Geoffrey
dialog: Paxton...
text: Only the animal trophies that adorn Geoffrey's office hear the
dialog: rest of the conversation.
scene_heading: INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY
text: Margaret wakes up. She looks over to Richard asleep on the floor
text: with a blanket and a pillow. She stares maybe a beat too long,
text: before there is a KNOCK on the door.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Who is it?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE (O.S.)
dialog: It's me dear. I made you two breakfast in
dialog: bed. Can I come in?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
speaker_heading: (STALLING)
dialog: Uh, sure. Just a second.
text: Margaret can't yell at Richard, so she throws a model wooden
text: sailboat to wake him up. She hits him in the head.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What the...
speaker_heading: MARGARET
speaker_heading: (MOUTHING)
dialog: Your mother.
text: Richard jumps up and replaces cushions and hides signs of his
text: makeshift bed. He finishes quickly, hops in the bed, and puts
text: his arm around Margaret.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Come on in mom!
text: Debbie enters with a tray of pastries, fruit and coffee.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: Ah mom, you made your cinnamon rolls.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Well, it's your special day.
text: Debbie smiles, puts down the tray on a bedside table and sits on
text: the edge of the bed. She is buzzing with excitement.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE (cont'd)
dialog: You two need your energy, so eat up. We've
dialog: got your dress fitting, have to get the
dialog: house ready, and then your wedding.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I gotta run into town to get Margaret a new
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Will you pick up some champagne while you're
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: No problem.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: And don't be gone for too long. Lots of
dialog: work to be done!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You don't have to go to all this trouble.
dialog: Really.
text: Debbie sweetly looks back at Margaret.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Don't be silly. This is the biggest day of
dialog: your life. You are coming into this family,
dialog: and when it's family, it's no trouble. If
dialog: your parents were with us, they would do the
dialog: exact same.
text: Debbie leaves and Margaret smiles as the door closes. Richard
text: jumps out of bed and goes to the food.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
speaker_heading: (TOUCHED)
dialog: Your mom is just so sweet. I haven't had
dialog: someone make me breakfast in bed since I was
dialog: a little kid.
text: Richard takes a huge bite of cinnamon roll.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (mouth full)
dialog: I wish she hadn't. I mean she almost caught
dialog: us. Damn, that was close.
text: Like a pig in shit, Richard continues to dig in and doesn't pay
dialog: attention to Margaret.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You just take all this for granted? Your
dialog: family, this house...
text: Richard takes another big bite and turns to Margaret.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (mouth full)
dialog: I'm sorry, what? You gotta try these.
text: Margaret looks at Richard with disgust.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Why are you doing this to them?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Why am I here? You didn't have to bring me
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You made me bring you here! You told me I
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I didn't make you do anything. You could of
dialog: said no.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: And what? Start over at the bottom again?
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I get why a not rich person would do this.
dialog: But you've got everything. It doesn't make
dialog: any sense.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Know what? This is none of your business.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I wish it wasn't my business. But
dialog: unfortunately, it has become my business,
dialog: because I made a deal with someone I thought
dialog: I could trust.
text: Richard stares at Margaret for a beat. He's exasperated.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You wanna know why you're here? I'll show
dialog: you why you're here.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: We leave in a half hour.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'll be ready in 20 minutes.
text: Margaret angrily takes a bite of a cinnamon roll and slams it
text: down on the plate. She goes to her suitcase and looks for
text: clothes. A beat passes, and she comes back to the rolls.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: These are really good.
text: She takes a cinnamon roll and leaves.
scene_heading: EXT. PAXTON DOCK - DAY
text: Richard and Margaret board the yacht. They wear athletic clothes
text: and running shoes.
scene_heading: EXT. BOAT - DAY
text: Richard drives the yacht and Margaret sits by herself.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 62.
scene_heading: EXT. PAXTON SEAFOODS PIER - DAY
text: Richard docks the boat at the Paxton Seafood pier. Located in
text: the town's harbor, the packing plant consists of three large
text: warehouses, and buzzes with activity. Fishing boats line the
text: pier, unload their fish, and forklifts take the fish to be
text: processed. Everything is clean and organized.
text: Richard and Margaret walk down the pier. He points to the SEALS
dialog: that swim everywhere and eat fish scraps. Damn, they're cute.
text: Richard waves hello to WORKERS. An elderly Phillipino man, BEK
text: BEK, yells at them as he walks into a warehouse.
speaker_heading: BEK BEK
dialog: Hey, Richard! That the lucky lady?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Yes sir, it is!
speaker_heading: BEK BEK
dialog: (to Margaret)
dialog: You look much younger than everyone says.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: That's great to hear.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: See ya on the line, Bek Bek.
scene_heading: INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY
text: Richard opens a locker and points. We don't see at what.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Put this on. I'll meet you outside.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: But I don't...
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Ah. Put it on.
scene_heading: EXT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY
text: Margaret opens the door with a sour look on her face. She's
text: wearing large green hip waders with suspenders, rubber fishing
text: boots, and gloves.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Is this really necessary?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You'll thank me later.
text: Richard walks towards the warehouse. Margaret follows in her
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 63.
scene_heading: INT. SLIME LINE - DAY
text: Inside one of the brightly lit warehouses, workers at different
text: stations process the fish that come off the boats.
text: At the top of the line, Bek Bek is HANDCUFFED to the head
text: decapitator machine. He happily feeds whole salmon into a
text: guillotine, where the heads are chopped off. He awkwardly waves
text: when he sees Margaret and Richard.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Why is he handcuffed to the machine?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: So his hands don't go too far. So he
dialog: doesn't...
text: Richard makes a chopping motion. Margaret winces.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Nice.
text: From the decapitator, fish are fed into the gut puller, where
text: their bellies are slit and the intestines are pulled out.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: You know, I shouldn't be here. I was a
dialog: vegetarian for six months in college.
text: Richard leads Margaret to the end of slime line, where a long
text: line of 20 workers give the fish a final cleaning before they are
text: frozen. With great speed, they take the fish from the gut puller
text: line and clean out all the left over intestines.
speaker_heading: WORKER
dialog: There he is! Big city boy come to show us
dialog: how its done.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Ah, it's been a while.
speaker_heading: WORKER
dialog: C'mon. Show her how we do it.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Okay, okay.
text: Richard and Margaret go to the end of the line. Richard expertly
text: demonstrates with a knife.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: You grab a fish, but be gentle, cause you
dialog: don't want to bruise it. Open her up, tilt
text: the knife, and then pull with the grain of
text: the fish. Two quick stokes to clear the
text: organs attached to the spine.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 64.
text: Margaret looks nauseous. Richard enjoys her discomfort.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
text: Then use the tip of the knife to squeeze the
text: blood out of the vein. Then send her down
dialog: the line.
text: Richard guts another fish with precision and speed before
text: offering a knife to Margaret.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: Wanna try it?
text: Margaret doesn't say anything. All the other workers watch.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: If it's too gross for you...
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Gimme that.
text: Up to the challenge, she takes the knife and grabs a fish.
text: Margaret puts the knife in and keeps as much distance as possible
text: between her and the salmon.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I did this for five summers. Dad wanted me
dialog: to earn my stripes before I took over.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Is that why you're still pissed at him?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Nah, I loved it here.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (re: fish guts)
dialog: You loved this?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: The slime line? Hell no. Nobody loves the
dialog: slime line. I loved this place. The
dialog: people. Growing up, running this place was
dialog: all I wanted.
text: Margaret scrapes a huge glop of guts out of a fish.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
speaker_heading: (DISGUSTED)
dialog: You wanted this?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I wanted to run this place. It was
dialog: comfortable here. It was what I knew.
dialog: (re: fish)
dialog: Don't forget the spine.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I wasn't gonna forget.
text: Margaret squeezes the blood out of the vein, sends the fish on
text: its way, and grabs another fish with more confidence.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: But then things changed. And it wasn't so
dialog: comfortable anymore.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: What kind of things changed?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Stuff.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (as if she didn't know)
dialog: You mean, like, Gertrude?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Yeah...
text: Richard stops, he can tell Margaret knows something.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: Oh my god. She told you didn't she?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
speaker_heading: (INNOCENT)
dialog: Told me what?
text: Richard is embarrassed. He turns away.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: About the... you know.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: The creepy teenage proposal?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Ah, shit!
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You were a freak by the way.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: OK, get it all out.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: And she was right to break up with you.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You done?
text: Margaret nods yes.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: I know now that it was the right thing, but
dialog: it screwed me up for a little while.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: For a little while? Don't sell yourself
dialog: short.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: When Gert crushed my heart into little
dialog: pieces, a life up here didn't seem so great
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: So you moved to the open arms of New York
dialog: City?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: At first it was about getting as far away
dialog: from this place as possible, but then I fell
dialog: in love with it.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: With scheduling my pilates?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: With editing. See, as an only kid I'd
dialog: always read a lot, but until I worked for
dialog: you I didn't love it. I mean, when I
dialog: realized that we could find the next
dialog: Cuckoo's Nest, or Catch 22, or...
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (with reverence)
dialog: ...To Kill a Mockingbird. It's all about To
dialog: Kill a Mockingbird.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Exactly! We could find the next To Kill a
dialog: Mockingbird. God damn, how great is that?
dialog: Margaret smiles. She never knew that Richard had this kind of
dialog: passion for the job.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: So when I tell my folks that I want to spend
dialog: my life finding books? My dad goes ape
dialog: shit. "How dare you forsake your family...
dialog: you'll come crawling back to us... you're
dialog: nothing without our help." I left that
dialog: night and we didn't talk for a year.
dialog: Haven't been back here since.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: So we're "getting married" so you can give
dialog: daddy the finger?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: No.
text: Margaret gives Richard a disbelieving look.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: Sorta. OK, Yes. Coming back here with
dialog: you... I get the promotion and I get to
dialog: show off. You're editor in chief. You make
dialog: a good prop.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
speaker_heading: (SMILING)
dialog: I guess that's a compliment.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: So now you know I'm a petty asshole. Am I
dialog: trustworthy again?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Oh yeah, we're good. By the way, you're
dialog: more screwed up than I am, Paxton.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Yeah. Thanks.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: One more question...
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Yes, everyone at work thinks you're a
dialog: lesbian.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: That wasn't my question.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I know. Just lashing out.
text: Margaret smiles.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Can we stop gutting fish? I need my phone.
scene_heading: INT. SITKA GENERAL STORE - DAY
text: Richard and Margaret enter the well appointed general store,
text: filled with food, booze and electronics. A mini Wal Mart.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Hey Ramone.
speaker_heading: RAMONE
dialog: Hey Richard. Hola mi amo.
text: Margaret recognizes Ramone, the male dancer from last night.

speaker_heading: MARGARET
speaker_heading: (EMBARRASSED)
dialog: Hey.
text: They walk a few steps, and before Margaret can say a word.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: You know him?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: He was my shop teacher.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Of course he was. How many people are on
dialog: this island?
text: They start to fill their cart with cases of champagne.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Like eight thousand? Depends on the time of
dialog: the year.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Feels smaller.
text: With the cart full they head to the checkout.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (to Ramone)
dialog: You got the phone I called about?
speaker_heading: RAMONE
text: Charged up, ready to go, number changed.
text: Ramone throws Richard a phone.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Thanks, Ramone.
speaker_heading: RAMONE
dialog: No problem.
text: Ramone gives Margaret a flirty wave. She awkwardly waves back.
text: Richard pushes the cart out the front door and does not pay.
text: Margaret is confused.
scene_heading: EXT. SITKA GENERAL STORE - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Richard keeps pushing the cart, Margaret catches up.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Why's Ramone letting you steal his stuff?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: It's our stuff.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 69.
text: Richard points to the "Paxton General Store" sign.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: That must have been handy in High School.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You have no idea.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Should you leave the cart?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: It's our cart. I didn't know you were such
dialog: a prude.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I've come to realize that being my assistant
dialog: gave you more access to my life than I ever
dialog: imagined, but there are a few things you
dialog: don't know about me.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I doubt it. When I started, you were still
dialog: wearing those Ugg boot things.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (deadly serious)
dialog: I told you never to talk about that.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I'm just saying it's been a long time. I
dialog: know it all.
text: Margaret turns on her new phone. It searches for a signal.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (up to the challenge)
dialog: Did you know I took disco lessons in the
dialog: sixth grade?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: The Y.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Margaret 1, Richard 0.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Uh, my first concert was Kool and the Gang.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: At Woodstock?
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I won tickets on the radio and saw them at
dialog: the fair.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What'd they sing again?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You know.
speaker_heading: (SINGING)
dialog: Cherish the love we have, we should cherish
dialog: the life we live...
text: Richard shakes his head.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: Well they were good.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You had a lot of soul there, Canada.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I really like "The O.C.". Not fake, ha, ha
dialog: isn't it funny I like this trash. I really
dialog: like it.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Wow. I'm getting shut out here.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Allergic to pine nuts.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Knew that.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
text: Afraid of penguins.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Huh.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Haven't slept with a man in a year and a

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Holy shit! You are a lesbian!
text: A MOTHER walking by with her 7 year old gives Richard a nasty
dialog: look.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: (to mother)
dialog: My bad.
text: The mother walks on. Margaret is mortified and walks faster.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Kool and the Gang gets nothing, but that
dialog: gets a Holy shit? I've been busy!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: That's a really long time.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: That hurts coming from Mr. Magic Pants.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I knew it had been slow going, but I figured
dialog: there was a booty call in there somewhere.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yeah, well, I'm not good at that.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I find that hard to believe.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: No, not that. I'm great at that. Aces.
dialog: Top notch.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I'll have to take your word for it.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yes. You will.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: How, exactly, do you define top notch?
text: Margaret is smiling as she listens to a message on her phone. In
dialog: an instant, she's all business.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I need a computer and the internet. Now.
scene_heading: INT. FISHERMAN'S NET INTERNET CAFE - DAY
text: Designed to attract tourists, the Fisherman's Net is awash in bad

text: Margaret looks and sees that all the computers are taken.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: No, no, no. I need on now. I've got a
dialog: Booker prize winning author demanding I send
dialog: him an e-mail in the next forty five minutes
dialog: explaining why he should stay with a
dialog: publishing house that "makes" him do
dialog: publicity.
text: The Pirate looks at Margaret like she's speaking Chinese.
speaker_heading: PIRATE
dialog: Arrgh...
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Listen to me asshole...
text: The Pirate looks around to make sure his boss can't hear.
speaker_heading: PIRATE
dialog: Look lady. You gonna put your name down on
dialog: the list or not?
text: Margaret is about to throttle the Pirate, when Richard pulls her
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: C'mon. I got an idea.
text: Richard leads Margaret to the door. As they are leaving Margaret
text: shouts out.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I didn't know there were a lot of pirates in

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Thanks for letting us use your computer.
scene_heading: MRS. WHITING

speaker_heading: MARGARET

scene_heading: MRS. WHITING

scene_heading: MRS. WHITING
dialog: Do you think she'll be long? I've got work
dialog: to do.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: She'll be out of there in two shakes.
text: Out of the corner of his eye, Richard catches Gertrude teaching a
text: class of second graders. He stops transfixed.
scene_heading: MRS. WHITING
dialog: (re: Gertrude)
dialog: We are so lucky to have her. Mr. Megher
dialog: really left us shorthanded when he ran off
dialog: in the middle of the school year. He's
text: living out in the forest now with his
text: wolves. Full time.
dialog: Richard hasn't heard anything that Mrs. Whiting has said. He's
text: hypnotized by Gertrude. She looks happy teaching these kids, and
text: they hang on her every word.
speaker_heading: MRS. WHITING (cont'd)
dialog: Will you excuse me? The bell is about to
dialog: ring, I need to get ready for recess.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (not paying attention)
dialog: Uh, sure.

dialog: Class, this is my old friend Richard.
speaker_heading: CLASS

dialog: Hi Richard!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: Richard and I used to be in this very same
dialog: classroom together. We even had your old
dialog: teacher, Mr. Megher.
speaker_heading: CHILD #1
dialog: Mr. Megher smelled like farty eggs!
text: The class giggles.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: That's not a nice thing to say, Patrick.
text: The BELL RINGS. One girl gets up. Gertrude eyeballs her.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE (cont'd)
dialog: Marcia?
speaker_heading: CHILD #2
dialog: Sorry.
text: The child sits back down. Gertrude waits a beat.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
text: OK, everyone is excused for recess.
text: All the kids pop up and head to the door. Mrs. Whiting directs
text: traffic outside. Richard makes his way to Gertrude.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Patrick's right. He did smell like eggs.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: It's still not a nice thing to say. And
dialog: actually, Mr. Megher smelled like wet dog

scene_heading: INT. BARANOFF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - OFFICE - DAY

speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
speaker_heading: (WEAKLY)
dialog: Sorry.
scene_heading: INT. BARANOFF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY
text: Gertrude and Richard wipe down the chalk boards together. They
dialog: are very comfortable together and have an easy rapport.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Remember when Mr. Megher made us do this
dialog: after school for a week?
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: That was your fault.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Was not!
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: You tried to kiss me. A girl has to defend
dialog: herself.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: C'mon!
dialog: (Tom Cruise ala Top Gun)
dialog: I had the shot. I took it.
text: Gertrude rolls her eyes. She's heard this a hundred times.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: No Top Gun. Please.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What? You loved my Top Gun.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: No. You loved your Top Gun. I just smiled
dialog: and laughed like a good girlfriend.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: That's right. Ice... man. I am dangerous.

speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: Really. Stop.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: That cuts deep. I'll have you know that

speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: (noticing her change in mood)
dialog: Uh, is something wrong?
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: No. Nothing's wrong.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: It's been awhile, but I can still tell when
dialog: something's wrong with you.
text: Gertrude doesn't want to say anything.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: What is it? You know I hate it when you get
dialog: all quiet.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: I wish there was a better way to say this.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Better way to say what?
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: I made a huge mistake. With you. Breaking
dialog: up with you. I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Are you apologizing for high school?
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Oh, thank God. I thought this was like,
dialog: something big.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: This is something big.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I coulda used this about five years ago, but
dialog: I'm all good now, promise. Thank you for
dialog: saying that, though.
text: Gertrude sees that Richard isn't getting her point. She pulls
dialog: herself together.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: I think...

speaker_heading: RICHARD

dialog: I want you back. Like... we should be
dialog: together. All the time.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Rewind.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: I know this isn't the best time to bring
dialog: this up.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
speaker_heading: (RHETORICAL)
dialog: My wedding day isn't the best time for you
dialog: to bring up the idea of us dating?
text: Richard's reaction stings, and Gertrude begins to well up.
dialog: Bringing this up is very hard for her.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: I'm not talking about dating! You should
dialog: move back here. We can have the life you
dialog: always talked about in High School. I'm
dialog: ready for that now.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Why are you doing this?
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: I know that the timing here sucks. But we
dialog: are meant to be together. I know it. I
dialog: think you know it too...
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: No, I don't. I don't know it.
text: Richard begins to pace. Not sure what to say. Every time he
text: opens his mouth, he can't find the words.
text: Then, from the door, an interruption.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Hey guys.
text: Holy shit. Did Margaret hear anything? Her face gives nothing
text: away. Gertrude and Richard act like nothing just happened, but
dialog: look guilty as hell.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: Oh. Hey Margaret.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Uh, you all done?

speaker_heading: MARGARET

speaker_heading: GERTRUDE

scene_heading: EXT. PAXTON DOCK - DAY
text: Richard and Margaret unload champagne. Richard is still thinking
dialog: about Gertrude and wanting to be alone.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: So, what did you and Gertrude talk about?
text: Richard lies.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Nothing. About her school. The kids and
dialog: stuff. Apparently my second grade teacher
dialog: was a pot head.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: That was it? I was gone for awhile...
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (cuts her off)
dialog: Yeah. That was it. You know, I can do
dialog: this. You should really go try on the dress
dialog: for my mom.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I was going to go for a run first, it's been
dialog: three days since I got out, I'm feeling
dialog: crazy.
speaker_heading: RICHARD

scene_heading: EXT. PAXTON TRAIL - DAY
text: Margaret runs at a fast pace deep in the woods. She's running
text: hard, muttering to herself, and working out the aggression she's
text: accumulated over the last thirty six hours. She's lost in her
text: own world, until she sees smoke, and slows to a stop.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: What now?
text: Margaret follows the smoke, and hears a mysterious DRUMBEAT. She
text: soon discovers a tremendous bonfire by the water, and a SHAMAN
text: dancing around it. He is dressed in a loin cloth, and wears a
text: carved bear's head mask and tribal make up. His belly shakes as
text: he spastically moves around the fire. The Shaman sings a song
dialog: that sounds centuries old.
speaker_heading: SHAMAN

text: He begins to yell at the fire and scream at the top of his lungs.
text: Exhausted, he stops and catches his breath. He yells out again.
speaker_heading: SHAMAN (cont'd)
dialog: Margaret, welcome!
text: She looks around. Maybe another Margaret is in the vicinity.
speaker_heading: SHAMAN (cont'd)
dialog: Come to me, Margaret of New York.
text: Nope, that's her. She carefully steps out into the clearing.
speaker_heading: SHAMAN (cont'd)
dialog: It is I, father Paxton.
text: Sure enough, Geoffrey is beneath all the make-up.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: What, ah, are you doing?
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: My shaman Kevin told me to get out here and
dialog: clear my head. As you know, things have
dialog: been a little crazy around here. You should
dialog: join me.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Ya know, I've got to get back.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: You closed minded southerners amuse me.

dialog: deny my circle.
text: Worried she's going to really piss him off, Margaret relents.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: OK, OK. I "accept your circle."
text: Geoffrey smiles and throws more sand into the fire.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: Clear your mind and follow me.
text: Geoffrey begins dancing slowly, contorting his body. Margaret
text: follows, always a half step behind, and can't get into it. After
text: a few moments, Margaret stops.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'm gonna head back.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: We're not done.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I think I am.

speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: Margaret?

speaker_heading: GEOFFREY (cont'd)
dialog: I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot. But
dialog: I'm making an effort here. Don't leave now.

dialog: Thank you.

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I can't...
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: Close your eyes. Chant.

speaker_heading: GEOFFREY (cont'd)

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I don't know any chants!
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY

speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: ...to all these bitches crawl...
text: Margaret's eyes are closed, she doesn't realize that she's broken
text: out into a âLil John song. She continues to dance.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: ...To all skee skee motherfucker...
text: Geoffrey takes the bear head mask off.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: ...all skee skee got damn...

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE
dialog: Oh, you poor dear. Geoffrey, you can't do
dialog: this!

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Come on sweetie, we need to get you cleaned
dialog: up. You've got a dress to try on. And

speaker_heading: MARGARET (O.S.)

text: but a mother can tell. When he looks at
dialog: you, I can tell he's in love. I'm so happy
dialog: I get to share your day.
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE
dialog: Debbie, please. We've got work to do.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: You're right.
text: Debbie collects herself, then starts crying again.
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE
dialog: You go work downstairs, I'll finish this.
text: Debbie tries to calm down, but can't.
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
dialog: Go!
text: Debbie nods in agreement. Smiling from ear to ear, she leaves in
text: tears. Margaret and Annie watch her go.
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
dialog: Had to get rid of her before I gave you
dialog: this. Don't think she woulda recovered.
text: Grandma Annie comes from behind and puts her arms around
text: Margaret's neck. When she is done, a stunning blue necklace lays
text: on Margaret's neck.
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
dialog: You needed something blue. It's silly, but
dialog: I didn't want to take any chances.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: It's beautiful.
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE
dialog: It's hematite. Alaska diamonds. The blue
dialog: ones like this are very rare. My great
dialog: grandfather gave it to my great grandmother
dialog: when they were married. They were quite a
dialog: scandal, you know. He was Russian and she
dialog: was Tlingit.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
dialog: Back then, you had to get approval from
dialog: every person in the tribe before you got
dialog: married. It almost broke them up.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: How'd they stay together?
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE
dialog: Don't know. But I'm sure happy they did,
dialog: none of us would be here if they hadn't.
text: Grandma and Margaret admire the necklace in the mirror.
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
dialog: I want you to have it.
dialog: This is awful news for Margaret. She might as well be stealing
dialog: from Annie.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: No, no, no. I can't. Really.
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE
dialog: I don't want to hear it. It's yours.
dialog: Grandmothers like to give their stuff away
dialog: to their grandchildren. Makes us feel like
dialog: we'll always be a part of your life, even
dialog: after we're gone. Take it.
text: Margaret puts her hand to the necklace, and for the first time
dialog: feels like a complete and total fraud.
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
dialog: Are you feeling all right, dear?
text: Margaret doesn't speak. Annie patiently waits for her reply.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Well. Thing is...
text: Margaret deliberates spilling her guts to Annie, but can't.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: ...the dress is just a little tight.
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE
dialog: Oh, don't worry about that. We've got these
dialog: seams by the arm, this'll be easy.
text: Annie marks up the dress with tailor's chalk.
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
dialog: We can fix this no problem.
text: Margaret smiles, but knows that Annie couldn't be more wrong.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 86.
scene_heading: EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY
text: Richard helps WORKERS build a stage for the band. He's still in
text: a foul mood when Margaret interrupts in a panic.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: We need to talk.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I'm a little busy.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Well I'm freaking out. I need to get away
dialog: from here. From everyone. Now.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Go for another run.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: No! I did that. It did not help.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I'm a little tired of you making demands and
dialog: me just jumping...
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (re: wedding stuff)
dialog: We're not going to need any of this if I
dialog: don't get out of here.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: OK, high maintenance. Let's go.
scene_heading: EXT. PAXTON SPEED BOAT - DAY
text: Unlike the bulky yacht, this boat is built for speed and
text: maneuverability. Richard starts her up.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Move over, I'm driving.
text: Margaret cuts in front of Richard and grabs the wheel.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You don't know where we're going.
text: Margaret opens up the throttle and they are off.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: It doesn't matter.
speaker_heading: ON THE OPEN OCEAN
text: Margaret and Richard leave everyone behind and take off for the
dialog: horizon.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 87.
text: As they jet up the coast away from civilization, the green trees,
text: blue water and wildlife (bears, puffins, moose) that inhabit the
dialog: coastline have a calming effect on both of them. In Alaska, it
text: doesn't take long to leave humanity behind.
text: Eventually, the boat travels through a channel with steep
text: mountain walls on either side. Although it is still warm out, an
text: icy beach can be seen straight ahead.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: Where are we?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: The north pole. Congratulations, we made
dialog: it.
dialog: (off Margaret's look)
dialog: It's a glacier. Tracy's Arm. You better
dialog: let me take it from here.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Oh. OK. So like me, you've navigated a lot
dialog: of glacier fields? And not died?
text: Margaret reluctantly moves aside and lets Richard steer.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: Lady, you've got issues.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yeah. I'm a control freak. Fine.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
text: It doesn't stop there.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: This coming from the sociopath.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Oh, please.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'd never bring me here.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You drove!
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I mean to Alaska.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Are you kidding me?
text: Richard pulls next to the glacier and turns off the engine.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You're sick. Doing this to them.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I explained to you...
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: They love you. Do you get that?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: And you're still willing to lie to them?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Like you didn't know.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Didn't know what?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: That we were going to lie to them.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I didn't know!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Well that makes you either stupid, or
dialog: ignorant.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You think I'm stupid?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: No, but what's behind door number two...
speaker_heading: MARGARET
speaker_heading: (SCREAMS)
dialog: I forgot! OK? I forgot!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Forgot what?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: What it was like!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What what was like?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: To have a family! I forgot what it was like
dialog: to have a family. I've been on my own since
dialog: I was thirteen, and I'd forgot what it was
dialog: like to have people that love you, and make
dialog: you breakfast, and give you necklaces...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 89.
text: Suddenly, Margaret has a hard time speaking and is short of
text: breath. She goes to the side of the speed boat.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: I'm going to take a walk.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: We need to head back...
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Alone. I need alone time.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What?
text: Margaret looks at Richard with a scared and confused look.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'm, uh, about to lose my shit. Big time.
dialog: I need a second.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: But...
speaker_heading: MARGARET
speaker_heading: (PANICKED)
dialog: Stop right there!
text: Richard puts up his hands in surrender and stays put.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: I'm going to be over there. Away from you.
dialog: Just sit down, turn around, and act like
dialog: you're not here.
text: Richard goes to speak, but Margaret motions for him to sit down
text: and turn around. He does. Margaret gets off the boat and walks
text: away from him on the glacier.
speaker_heading: ON THE GLACIER
text: Margaret tries diaphragmatic breathing to calm down.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: (manic, to herself)
dialog: You can do this. Couple more hours, and
dialog: then you'll never see these people again.
dialog: Eventually you'll write a letter.
dialog: Apologize. Send the necklace back.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (from the boat)
dialog: Margaret!
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: No talking!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (from the boat)
dialog: Watch your step, OK? It can be dangerous.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Again, you're not supposed to be...
text: Margaret doesn't finish her sentence.
speaker_heading: ON THE BOAT
text: Richard sits with his back turned to Margaret, waiting for her
text: reply. He doesn't hear anything. That's weird.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (back still turned)
dialog: Margaret?
text: Richard turns around and looks for Margaret. He doesn't see her.
text: He gets out of the boat and goes onto the glacier, walking in the
dialog: direction he last saw Margaret.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: Margaret? I know I'm breaking "the rules"
dialog: here, but where are you?
text: He takes one more step before he hears...
speaker_heading: MARGARET (O.S.)
speaker_heading: (YELLING)
dialog: Richard!!!!!!!! Help!!!!!!!!
text: Richard still can't see her, but runs in the direction of her
text: voice. He soon rounds a mound of ice and sees that --
text: Margaret's been swallowed by the ice. Her upper torso sticks out
text: of the glacier, held up by her arms. Her eyes are wide, and
text: she's almost hyperventilating. It's a bizarre sight.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: Oh, thank God!
text: Richard tries to control himself, but BURSTS OUT LAUGHING.
text: Margaret is really scared.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: Wh-, wh-, why are you laughing?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Just relax. I'll
dialog: get you out of there. You've broken through
dialog: an ice bridge. It happens all the time. No
dialog: biggie.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Don't do that.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Don't do what?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: The thing that doctors do in E.R. when they
text: tell the gunshot victim who is bleeding to
dialog: death that they're going to be OK. Don't do
dialog: that!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: It's not like that. Really. We do need to
dialog: be careful here though, I don't want us both
dialog: to fall in. Stay still, OK?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Uh-huh.
text: Richard is ten feet away from Margaret now. He's checking the
text: ice to see if it is stable. He slowly walks her way.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: So, I'm going to walk up to you and very
dialog: slowly pull you out. OK?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'm really cold.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Yeah, that's normal when you're surrounded
dialog: by ice.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (makes sense)
dialog: OK.
text: Richard stands over a stuck Margaret, whose head just comes up to
text: his knee. He calmly looks down on her.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: So I'm going to pull you up by your armpits.
dialog: I'm probably going to touch boob. But don't
dialog: freak out.
text: Margaret shakes her head yes. Richard reaches down and slowly
text: lifts her out of the ice. Margaret doesn't say a word.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: When I get you all the way out, I need you
dialog: to hold onto me. I'm going to carry you
dialog: over there.
text: Margaret nods yes as she puts her arms around Richard. He's
dialog: strong, so it isn't difficult for him to slowly carry her "over
text: the threshold" style, away from the hole in the ice. He speaks
dialog: once they're safe.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: I've, uh, never done that before.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You said it was "no biggie".
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Yeah. Well. You OK?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yeah. I'm fine.
text: Richard smiles. Margaret smiles back.
text: Richard walks very comfortably with her in his arms. She fits
text: just right. Margaret looks up to Richard gratefully.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
speaker_heading: (SMILING)
dialog: You shouldn't of laughed at me.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You woulda laughed at me.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yeah. While I was getting my camera.
text: The two stare at each other for a beat. There's a real spark.
dialog: They might kiss.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Gertrude wants me back.
text: Whoah. Not what she was expecting. She looks down.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Well. It seemed like you were having...
dialog: second thoughts.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yeah. I was.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Maybe we should do it. Come clean.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Put me down.
text: Richard puts Margaret down near the boat. She tries to regain
text: her composure.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: You wanna call it off?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: If you do.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Fine. It's over. We'll tell them when we
dialog: get back.
speaker_heading: ON THE BOAT
text: Margaret sits hunched over with a blanket wrapped around her.
text: Richard drives the boat. They don't talk.
scene_heading: EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY
text: Richard and Margaret walk towards the house, which looms above
text: them as they prepare to deliver the news that they aren't getting
text: married. The front door opens, and Geoffrey comes outside in a
text: hurry. He's clearly been waiting.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: Come with me.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Where's mom, dad? We all need to talk.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: Not now. C'mon.
text: Richard and Margaret look at each other, not sure what to do.
text: Geoffrey storms off and they follow.
scene_heading: EXT. PAXTON GUESTHOUSE - DAY
text: Richard, Margaret and Geoffrey arrive at the door to the
text: guesthouse. Geoffrey stops before they go in.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: (to Richard)
dialog: I haven't told your mother about any of
dialog: this, and I don't plan to.
dialog: (to Margaret)
dialog: I was really beginning to like you. Sorry
dialog: about this.
text: Geoffrey opens the door and goes inside.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE GUESTHOUSE
text: The guesthouse has been converted into a squash court. In the
text: middle of the court, a man patiently sits on a metal folding
text: chair. It's Gilbertson. He smiles.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: Hey there kids. Good to see ya!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (to Dad)
dialog: What did you do?
text: Geoffrey doesn't answer. He's not proud of himself.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: (getting angry)
dialog: What did you do, dad?!
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: I called him yesterday. He told me that you
dialog: were lying, and that he was going to catch
dialog: you. That he was going to send you to
dialog: prison.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: (to Richard)
dialog: We made a deal and dad here flew me up. Now
dialog: you tell the truth, and get off scott free.
dialog: It's like it never happened for you.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You made a deal with him? On my behalf?
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: You were making a mistake...
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: That's none of your business.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: It's fine.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: The hell it is. It is not fine!
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: Oh quack, quack, quack. Just tell me what
dialog: really happened, and I'll be on my way. No
dialog: one gets hurt, we all get what we want.
text: Margaret takes Richard's hand.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: It's OK. Tell him.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (to Geoffrey)
dialog: You do not get to make this decision. This
dialog: is my decision.
dialog: (to Gilbertson)
dialog: The truth is... I've been working for
dialog: Margaret for three years. Six months ago we
dialog: started dating. I recently asked her to
dialog: marry me, and she said yes. See you both at
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: What are you doing, Richard?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (grabs Margaret's hand)
dialog: Come on, we gotta get ready.
text: Margaret and Richard storm out of the squash court.
scene_heading: EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: The couple walks briskly to the house.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What was I thinking? They act like they're
dialog: nice, but really, they're evil.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: He's only doing it because he loves you.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Are you defending him? Are you defending
dialog: the king dick?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Just stop. Think about this.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Oh, I've thought about it. And know what I
dialog: think? I think you saved my life. Thank
dialog: you, Margaret. Getting married to you is
dialog: the best thing that's ever happened to me.
dialog: Without this, I might've ended up back here.
text: Up at the house, Debbie opens the door.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: There you are! You two almost gave me a
dialog: heart attack. C'mon, get dressed!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Coming mom!
dialog: (to Margaret)
dialog: Time to sack up.
text: Richard winks and goes inside. Margaret follows, not sure.
scene_heading: THE WEDDING MONTAGE
text: -- Chairs are set up outside.
text: -- Guests arrive via boat.
text: -- Richard stands on the deck, wearing his tuxedo. Gertrude
text: arrives for the wedding, and they lock eyes. Richard waves hello
text: and mouths "Sorry." He goes back inside.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 96.
text: -- Geoffrey sits in his bedroom and watches TV. He's not dressed
text: for the wedding yet. Debbie shakes her head at him in the mirror
text: as she puts on her ear rings.
dialog: -- Gilbertson eats every hors d'oeuvre that's offered to him.
scene_heading: INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY
text: Grandma knocks on the door and comes inside. We see Margaret
text: from head to toe. The dress, veil and flowers look amazing.
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE
dialog: If I were one to brag, I'd say that dress is
dialog: perfect.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Matches the shoes.
text: Margaret pulls up the dress to reveal running sneakers.
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE
dialog: Those'll be your best friend. Wedding shoes
dialog: stink. You ready?
scene_heading: EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY
text: With the ocean in the background, 200 GUESTS sit in white chairs.
text: Richard stands under a gazebo, and smiles at his mother in the
text: front row. He ignores Geoffrey.
text: Gertrude sits nearby, next to Gilbertson.
text: From the gazebo, Richard nods at a GROUP OF CELLO PLAYERS, who
text: begin playing from downloaded sheet music that reads "Kool and
text: the Gang, Cherish". Heads turn with the start of the music, to
text: see Annie walk Margaret down the aisle.
text: When Margaret recognizes the song, she smiles.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (mouthing to Richard)
dialog: Nice song.
text: Richard shrugs his shoulders.
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE
dialog: Is that your song, dear?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I guess so.
text: Margaret and Annie stop at the end of the aisle. Looking up,
dialog: Margaret sees the justice of the peace, Ramone. (Yes, the same
dialog: guy from the liquor store and the strip club.)
speaker_heading: RAMONE
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE
dialog: It's me, Ramone.
text: Margaret gives Annie a kiss, and then turns to Richard. They
text: whisper while they walk up to Ramone.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You look gorgeous.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
speaker_heading: (SMILING)
dialog: You look disgusting.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: So, is this what you dreamed of when you
dialog: were a little girl?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Oh, you bet.
text: They make it to the Gazebo, where Ramone awaits.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: Ramone.
speaker_heading: RAMONE
speaker_heading: (QUIETLY)
dialog: Mi amo.
dialog: (To the crowd)
dialog: We are gathered here today to celebrate one
dialog: of life's greatest moments. To give
dialog: recognition to the beauty, honesty, and
dialog: unselfish ways...
text: Margaret looks at Richard on the word "unselfish," but he's
text: looking straight ahead, determined to get through this.
speaker_heading: RAMONE (cont'd)
dialog: ...of Richard and Margaret's true love...
dialog: "True Love" gets Margaret as well, although no one in the
text: audience notices.
speaker_heading: RAMONE (cont'd)
dialog: ...before their family and friends.
dialog: "Family and Friends" gets a reaction out of Gertrude and
text: Geoffrey. She purses her lips. He holds on to his chair in
dialog: order to keep himself seated.
speaker_heading: RAMONE (cont'd)
dialog: For it is family and friends who taught
dialog: Richard and Margaret to love, so it is only
dialog: right that family and friends all celebrate
dialog: that love here today.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: RAMONE (cont'd)
dialog: And if there is anyone who has cause why
dialog: this couple should not be united in marriage
dialog: and love, they must speak now or forever
dialog: hold their peace.
text: Gilbertson stays quiet. Geoffrey takes a tug from a flask.
text: Ramone is about to continue, but something gets his attention.
text: He's not sure what to do.
speaker_heading: RAMONE (cont'd)
dialog: Mi amo, do you have a question?
text: We reveal that Margaret has her hand halfway up, eyes squinted
text: shut like the new kid in class not sure of herself.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RAMONE
dialog: Then why is your hand up?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I have something to say. It's not a
dialog: question though.
speaker_heading: RAMONE
dialog: Can it wait âtil after?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Uh. Um. No.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Margaret gathers herself and turns around to the crowd. They
text: stare back, unsure what to make of this foreigner.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Hey there, folks. Thanks for coming out.
dialog: I've got a little announcement to make about
dialog: the "wedding."
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Don't do this.
text: Margaret smiles and squeezes Richard's hand.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Not sure the best way to tell you all this.
dialog: But, uh... I made Richard marry me. This is
dialog: all a sham.
text: Gilbertson victoriously pumps his fist in the air.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: I was going to get kicked out of the country
dialog: -- so I told Richard that I would destroy
dialog: his career if he didn't marry me.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Now wait...
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Richard. Please. Let me finish.
dialog: (to the Paxton family)
dialog: Richard wanted to stop this when we got off
dialog: the plane, but I wouldn't let him. Don't
dialog: blame him. This is all my fault.
dialog: (to Ramone)
dialog: Could you get the band started? And give
dialog: these people something to drink.
dialog: (to Gilbertson)
dialog: And you. Meet me at your dingy in ten,
dialog: you're taking me to the airport.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: You got it!
text: Margaret nods, hands Richard the bouquet, and confidently walks
text: back up the aisle with all eyes on her. She stops when she gets
text: to Gertrude and leans down.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Take care of him.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: Promise.
text: Margaret walks back into the house. Alone.
scene_heading: INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY
text: Margaret's wedding dress is laid out on the bed. Her bag is
text: packed. Richard knocks and comes in. Margaret is on the phone.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (unenthusiastically to phone)
dialog: Uh-huh. Yeah. That's great Frank. Good
dialog: news. Talk to you on Monday.
text: Margaret hangs up.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: So Frank's back in?
text: Margaret nods distractedly. Getting Frank to do the publicity
dialog: tour doesn't mean much right now.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yup. He's in. For now.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Maybe this'll be your Mockingbird?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yeah. Right.
text: Margaret starts collecting her bags.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Great exit back there.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Thanks. Fun weekend.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Same old, same old, around here.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Wasn't sure if your mom would want me to
dialog: strip the sheets, so I just left them.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I'll let her know.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Why did you tell them all that?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: It was getting too messy. We weren't going
dialog: to be able to keep it up.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Don't start lying to me now.
text: Margaret stops for a moment.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I heard you and Gertrude at the school. I
dialog: think she meant what she said. She's a
dialog: great girl, you should stay. It's the right
dialog: thing. You're perfect for each other.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: But... but what about you? What are you
dialog: gonna do?

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yup. This is it.

dialog: 
dialog: 101.
text: Margaret walks to the door, but stops. She turns to Richard.
text: Despite her best effort to act cold, she can't help herself.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
speaker_heading: (SINCERE)
dialog: Have an amazing life, OK? You're a good
dialog: person. You deserve it.
text: She puts out her hand, and Richard shakes it. It's electric, but
dialog: Margaret denies it.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: Goodbye, Richard.
scene_heading: EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY
text: Margaret walks down to the dock carrying her suitcase. She can
text: hear that the party is in full swing and smiles.
scene_heading: EXT. BOAT - DAY
text: Gilbertson drives his little speedboat and Margaret holds her
text: suitcase tight. It's choppy, and the outboard motor is loud.
text: The two have to yell to talk.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: I want you to say the words.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'm not doing great in the dignity
dialog: department, can we not do this right now?
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: Say it.
text: Margaret closes her eyes. Hating that it's come to this.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'll publish your book.
text: Gilbertson smiles.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: Now was that so hard?
scene_heading: EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY
text: Richard sits by himself and finishes a beer by the shore.
text: Gertrude walks up to him, looking fabulous, with two more beers.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: So here's the deal. I'm going to have a
dialog: million questions for you tomorrow...
text: Gertrude sits down next to Richard.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE (cont'd)
dialog: ...but for now I thought we'd just sit here
dialog: and drink beer. OK?
text: Richard nods. Gertrude hands him a beer.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Thanks.
text: Richard thanks her with a kiss on the cheek. Then, realizing
text: where and who he is with, he puts his beer down. He turns to
text: Gertrude again with a determined look, gives her a kiss on the
text: lips, then follows it up with an even bigger kiss.
text: When they finish, Gertrude is grinning, eyes closed.
text: Richard looks worried. Something is wrong.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: You have been practicing.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Waddya mean?
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: Well. Margaret told me that you, uh, turned
dialog: into bit of a man whore down there.
text: Richard looks down. A bit ashamed. Gertrude makes light.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE (cont'd)
dialog: You're gonna have to put that in check if
dialog: you move back. Cause me and Beth Cable are
dialog: the only two real options up here... and
dialog: I'll kick that bitch's ass.
text: Richard gives her a polite smile. He's not really in the mood to
text: joke. Gertrude notices.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE (cont'd)
dialog: So no jokes yet? Too soon?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I'm sorry. I'm just a little... confused.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: That kiss didn't seem "confused."
text: Richard takes a beat to collect himself.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You're amazing, Gert. And I've thought
dialog: about being with you for a long time. A
dialog: long time. When you said those things at
dialog: the school? I've dreamed about hearing you
dialog: say those things.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: But as crazy as this seems. I know now...
dialog: that we're just not meant to be.
text: Gertrude pulls back like she's been punched.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: Thing is... when I said goodbye to Margaret?
dialog: I felt sick. For the three years we worked
dialog: together, I wanted to be as far away from
dialog: her as possible. But now that she's gone?
dialog: I'm just really... sad. I want her with me.
dialog: What is that?
text: The question hangs in the air.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I think I have to find out.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: Find out what?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: If she feels the same way.
text: Gertrude begins to tear up, but won't let herself cry.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: Well. OK then. What's a girl gonna do?
dialog: (voice cracking)

speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: What are you so God damn happy about?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What? Oh. Well, I'm, uh, going to see
dialog: Margaret.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: She violated you. We should report her.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Who you gonna report her to, mom?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Oh my God. He's got the Stockholm syndrome.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I don't have the Stockholm syndrome. And
dialog: she didn't violate me.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: What is going on, Richard?
text: Richard slows down and explains to his mom.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I'm sorry I lied to you. That was an awful
dialog: thing to do. But it took this weekend for
dialog: me to see how funny, and screwed up and
dialog: perfect Margaret is for me. I think
dialog: she's... the one.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: But you already thought she was the one.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: No, I didn't. Not until she left.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Really? Does she think that too?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I don't know. I've got to get to the
dialog: airport to find out.
text: Debbie doesn't say anything, then breaks into a smile.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (so romantic)
dialog: He's going to stop her from leaving! At the
dialog: airport!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: But I gotta hurry. Her plane leaves any
dialog: second. I might not make it.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (so romantic)
dialog: He's not sure he's going to make it!
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: Are you buying this horse shit?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Oh, Geoffrey!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I don't have time to explain this to you.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: Well then make some god-damn time. Cause I
dialog: won't let you throw your life away for some
dialog: woman.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I don't care.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I don't care. I love you and want you to
dialog: understand. But I'm not asking your
dialog: permission here. I'm doing this.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: Oh, really?
text: From behind them, Annie stands up and shouts.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Boys! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
text: But suddenly, a look of panic flashes across Annie's face. She
text: grabs the table to steady herself, but pulls the table cloth,
text: causing a loud crash. Geoffrey and Richard run over.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: Mom, are you OK?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I'm having a... I need to go to the

scene_heading: EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY

speaker_heading: GEOFFREY

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Listen to me. You two need to stop

dialog: (to Geoffrey)
dialog: Promise me you'll stand by Richard, even if

speaker_heading: GEOFFREY

speaker_heading: ANNIE

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: OK, then.
text: Annie closes her eyes. She looks peaceful. A moment passes.

dialog: pilot.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (cont'd)
dialog: (as if nothing happened)
dialog: I'm feeling much better. I don't need to go
dialog: to the hospital. Take us to the airport,

text: Richard and Geoffrey are confused. Stunned even.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: What... what is going on?
dialog: (so the Coast Guard can't hear)
dialog: Did you fake a heart attack?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: We didn't have time for your squabbling, and
dialog: I knew a helicopter would be the quickest
dialog: way to the airport. It seemed like the best
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: The best way?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: And remember, you two promised me that
dialog: you're going get along. I wasn't kidding
dialog: about that.
speaker_heading: COAST GUARD PILOT

scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT TOWER - DAY

speaker_heading: CHUCK

speaker_heading: PILOT (O.S.)

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Hey Chuck, it's Richard.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Hey man. Heard about your lady bailing.

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Need you to do me a solid, brother. I gotta

speaker_heading: CHUCK

speaker_heading: RICHARD

scene_heading: INT. PLANE - DAY

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Well. That's it. Once she gets back to New

text: Richard looks defeated. Geoffrey sees how sad his son is, and
text: takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: So, you know I think you shouldn't be with
dialog: Margaret, right?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You've made that crystal clear.
speaker_heading: GEOFFREY
dialog: Good.
dialog: (looks at Annie)
dialog: Well, consider this me keeping my promise.

speaker_heading: GEOFFREY (cont'd)
dialog: (to phone)
dialog: Hey! Maguire! Yeah, yeah, yeah, her

scene_heading: INT. PLANE - DAY
text: Gilbertson continues to talk. Margaret is in a stupor.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON

text: A flight attendant comes to Margaret and interrupts.
scene_heading: FLIGHT ATTENDANT

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yes, of course.

speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: What's this about?
dialog:

scene_heading: FLIGHT ATTENDANT

speaker_heading: FLIGHT ATTENDANT (cont'd)

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Shit! She's never going to pick up...
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: (to Richard)
dialog: Know what, home slice? Cut this chica
dialog: loose. You remember Beth Cable? She'd
dialog: totally be into you...
text: Suddenly, Richard has an idea. He picks up the hand mic.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Excuse me Miss Flight Attendant, could you

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PLANE - DAY

speaker_heading: RICHARD (O.S.)
dialog: (over loudspeaker)
dialog: Uh, hey Margaret. And cause I'm on the
dialog: loudspeaker, hey everyone on the plane.
text: The other passengers look around to try and figure out who's
text: Margaret. Meanwhile, Margaret looks down and acts like she
dialog: doesn't know either.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (O.S.) (cont'd)
dialog: (over loudspeaker)
dialog: This certainly isn't how I wanted to do
dialog: this. I mean, I'm not really into the whole

dialog: here goes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. TOWER - DAY
text: Richard puts down the hand mic for a second to gain composure.

speaker_heading: CHUCK

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I know you're used to being on your own.
dialog: And that you're comfortable with your life
dialog: the way it is. And that in a million years
dialog: you wouldn't have thought that we should be
dialog: together. I know, because I felt the exact

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: We need to talk.
text: (Intercut as necessary. Margaret stands at the front of the

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Have you ever thought there might be a
dialog: reason we've been together for the last
dialog: three years?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: As boss and assistant.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Things change, Margaret.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
speaker_heading: (INCREDULOUS)
dialog: Things change?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Yeah, things change.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Is that the best you got?
text: Geoffrey hits Richard, as if to say "see, that's what I said."
text: Richard composes himself.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Now, tell me the truth. When you left, were
dialog: you relieved or sad that we didn't have an
dialog: excuse to be together anymore?
text: Geoffrey gives Richard the thumbs up. That was a good one.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: What's your point?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Because I am sick that you left. And if you
dialog: feel sick too, then why shouldn't we just be
dialog: together?
text: Margaret goes to answer, but stops. Richard is right. She wants
text: to go back. Even the passengers on the plane can see it.
text: Gilbertson panics.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: Are you thinking about going back to him?
text: Margaret doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON (cont'd)
dialog: We have a deal! You can't back out now!
text: The flight attendant steps in, annoyed that Gilbertson is trying
dialog: to break up Richard and Margaret.
scene_heading: FLIGHT ATTENDANT
dialog: Sir, you need to sit down.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: I will do no such thing.
scene_heading: FLIGHT ATTENDANT
dialog: Sir, I'm ordering you to return to your
dialog: seat.
text: Other passengers yell "sit down asshole" at Gilbertson.
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: Who said that?
scene_heading: FLIGHT ATTENDANT
dialog: Sir, this is your third and final warning!
speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: Listen sweetheart...
dialog: (he pokes the flight attendant)
dialog: I'm a federal officer, so why don't you get
dialog: me another cocktail and mind your own...
text: BUZZ! ZAP! 400,000 Volts of electricity surge through
text: Gilbertson. He twitches violently and crashes to the floor.
text: Behind him, The Handsome Man holds a stun gun and a badge.
speaker_heading: HANDSOME MAN
dialog: Well, I'm a federal Air Marshall. And
dialog: you're under arrest for disobeying a crew
text: member, assault, and possible intoxication.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 114.
text: The Handsome Man pulls out flex cuffs, zips them around
text: Gilbertson's wrists, and throws him in the bathroom. He then
text: takes the CB from Margaret and speaks to the passengers.
speaker_heading: HANDSOME MAN (cont'd)
dialog: Sorry everybody, but protocol says we need
dialog: to get this unruly passenger off the plane
dialog: ASAP. Sitka's the closest airport, so if
dialog: it's OK with you, I'm gonna have the captain
dialog: turn this bird around.
text: There are wild cheers from the passengers. Margaret blushes.
speaker_heading: HANDSOME MAN (cont'd)

dialog: Told you I was a romantic.
scene_heading: EXT. SITKA AIRPORT RUNWAY - DAY
text: Flight 1601 glides to a safe landing. Richard and his family

text: Margaret steps out. Richard walks up the steps.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: This wasn't supposed to happen.
text: Richard looks Margaret in the eye.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: But it did.
text: Margaret looks down. A little embarrassed.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'm not the kind of girl who gets saved.

text: plants a long, deep, and wet kiss on him.
text: The long kiss is interrupted by the Handsome Man and Gilbertson.
speaker_heading: HANDSOME MAN
dialog: Uh, sorry, but excuse us.
text: The Handsome Man leads a handcuffed and still dazed Gilbertson
text: down the steps.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (to Gilbertson)
dialog: Hey! Do you think getting arrested might
dialog: affect you at work?
text: Gilbertson has no retort.

speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: Oh, and I'm not going to be able to publish

speaker_heading: MR. GILBERTSON
dialog: So you are getting married this weekend?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
speaker_heading: (SMILING)
dialog: Absolutely not. But who knows?
dialog: (looking at Richard)
dialog: We might by the time you get out of jail.
text: Gilbertson makes a "go to hell" face and shuffles off.
text: Margaret turns back to Richard. All smiles.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: I've got some explaining to do.
text: Margaret and Richard walk down the steps and stand in front of
dialog: Richard's family.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (cont'd)
dialog: (to Debbie)
dialog: Hi. I'm Margaret. I've known your son for

dialog: (to Geoffrey)
dialog: I want to get to know you all, and spend
dialog: some real time up here in Alaska.
dialog: (to Annie)
dialog: I'm not sure when you are going to see him

dialog: with him, he'll be happy.
text: Passengers cram up to the plane windows to see what will happen.
speaker_heading: GRANDMA ANNIE

dialog: very good.
text: And as everyone dances, we track up the tallest tree on the
