speaker_heading: YOUNG VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: You wanna be Kareem?
text: CAMERA REVEALS: QUINCY MCCALL, eleven years old, dribbling a

speaker_heading: QUINCY (CONT'D)
dialog: All his big butt do is stand by the

speaker_heading: JAMAL
dialog: Shoot, I'll be blocking your stuff.
speaker_heading: KELVIN

speaker_heading: KELVIN
dialog: Hey, look, Q.
text: Quincy follows Kelvin's eyes, to a beat-up pair of Converse
text: All-Stars approaching from next door. Walking in the kicks
text: is a YOUNG KID in a T-shirt and Tuff-skins, and a LAKERS cap
text: pulled low. A moving van is parked in the driveway.
speaker_heading: KELVIN (cont'd)
dialog: Thought only girls were moving in.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: That's what my Moms said.
speaker_heading: KELVIN
dialog: I hope he can ball.
speaker_heading: JAMAL

speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Can I play?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: You nice?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Yeah, I'm nice.
text: Quincy looks the Kid up and down, then --
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: You and Kelvin gainst me and Jamal.
text: Quincy tosses the Kid the ball. The Kid pulls off the
text: baseball cap. Brown hair tumbles down, framing a soft brown
text: face and bright eyes. She is MONICA WRIGHT, eleven years
dialog: old.
speaker_heading: JAMAL
dialog: Ah man, he is a girl.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Girls can't play no ball.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Ball better than you.
text: Quincy laughs derisively as Monica walks to the top of the

speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: What a dog.
text: Monica shoots him a glare.
speaker_heading: JAMAL
dialog: She heard you.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Nuh uh, they could only hear dog
text: whistles.
text: Monica starts to dribble. Jamal whistles as he walks
text: backwards, guarding her. She throws up a shot. IT'S AN
text: AIRBALL. Quincy and Jamal crack up. Kelvin rolls his eyes.
text: Quincy grabs the rebound and shoots. Swish.
speaker_heading: QUINCY (cont'd)
dialog: One, zip.
text: He rolls the ball to Monica. She starts dribbling and again,
text: Jamal just backs up with her. She passes to Kelvin. Jamal
text: and Quincy collapse on him, leaving Monica open under the
text: basket. Trapped Kelvin has no choice but to pass it back.
text: Monica catches the ball and throws up a shot. It banks off
text: the backboard...AND DROPS THROUGH THE NET. The boys look at
text: her in shock. Monica tosses the ball back to Quincy.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: One, up.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Lucky.
text: Quincy easily dribbles by Kelvin and lays up the ball. He
text: throws the ball back to Monica.
speaker_heading: QUINCY (cont'd)
dialog: Two, one.
text: Monica dribbles. Jamal plays her a little tighter. Monica
text: bounces the ball through his open legs and lays up the ball.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Two, up.
text: Quincy can't believe it. Kelvin cracks up.
speaker_heading: KELVIN
dialog: Aaah, she dogged you.
speaker_heading: JAMAL
dialog: Shut up.
text: The game continues, with Quincy and Monica trading baskets
text: for their teams. Quincy grows agitated with Jamal, who is
text: unable to stop her. The score hits nine, nine.
text: Quincy stands at the top of the driveway, ball in hand.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Point.
text: Quincy dribbles through his legs, then pops an outside shot.
text: The ball bounces on the rim...and rolls off.
text: Quincy curses as Monica grabs the rebound and clears the
text: ball. Jamal moves to guard her, but Quincy shoves him off.
speaker_heading: QUINCY (cont'd)
dialog: I got her.
text: Quincy defends. Monica smiles back at him.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Told you I was nice. I'm going to be
dialog: the first girl in the NBA.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I'ma be in the NBA. You're gonna be my
dialog: cheerleader.
text: Monica suddenly passes to Kelvin, sprints for the basket.
text: Quincy stumbles, giving her a step. Kelvin throws it back.
text: Quincy knows he's beat as Monica goes for the winning lay-up.
text: In desperation, he swings at her for the hard foul, shoving
text: her off balance.
text: THE BALL FLIES FROM HER HAND AS SHE CRASHES TO THE GROUND,
scene_heading: FACE-FIRST. SHE GRABS HER CHEEK. BLOOD SLIPS THROUGH HER
speaker_heading: FINGERS.
text: The boys stand frozen. Quincy stares down at her, his eyes
text: wide with fear...and regret.
scene_heading: INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - BATHROOM - LATE MORNING
text: Monica leans over the sink as her mother, CAMILLE, 36, wipes
text: the blood from her face with a washcloth.
speaker_heading: GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Eeew.
text: Her sister, LENA, 14, leans in the doorway, making a face.
text: She is a mirror of their mother, with relaxed hair and
text: painted nails.
text: Her father, NATHAN, 39, moves behind Lena, holding a box.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: How are you feeling, munchkin?
text: Monica nods. He smiles.
speaker_heading: NATHAN (cont'd)
dialog: Yeah, you're through.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: She needs to stop running around like a
dialog: little boy.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: She's alright.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: How is she alright looking the way she
dialog: does?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Camille, she'll be fine.
text: He gives Monica a wink, crosses away. Monica pulls the
text: washcloth away from her Mom and starts wiping the blood
dialog: herself.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: I'll get some ice.
text: She exits. Lena shakes her head, follows.
text: Monica pulls the washcloth from her face and stares into the
text: mirror. TORN SKIN SURROUNDS A SMALL DEEP GASH IN HER CHEEK.
text: Seeing her latest battle scar, there's only one thing left
text: for this little girl to do. She smiles.
scene_heading: INT. MCCALL HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
text: Quincy sits at the kitchen table, writing "I AM SORRY" in
text: block letters across a homemade card. His face is tight with
text: concentration as he tries to write in a straight line.
text: At the counter, his mom, NONA, moves a cake from its store
text: box to a cake dish. She is 30, beautiful, with effort. She
text: smooths the frosting with a spoon.
text: ZEKE, 32, with the height and ego of an NBA ballplayer,
text: enters. He laughs.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Girl, who you trying to fool?
text: Quincy looks up, smiles. He quickly grabs a piece of
text: crumpled paper, and tosses it to Zeke.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Alley-oop, Dad.
text: Nona intercepts his pass.
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: Boy...
text: She points him back to his card. Quincy scowls, starts
text: writing again. Nona scoops some frosting on her finger,
text: holds it up.
speaker_heading: NONA (cont'd)
dialog: New neighbors.
text: Zeke wraps his lips around her finger, sucks the frosting
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: See, Quincy, this is how your Moms caught
dialog: me, with the old fake and bake. Had me
dialog: thinking I was getting a sister who could
dialog: burn.
text: Nona laughs, pulls him down for a kiss. Quincy suddenly
text: throws down his pencil in frustration.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I can't do this shit.
text: Zeke and Nona pull away, stare at Quincy in shock.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Boy, what'd I tell you about using that
dialog: word?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: (sighs, then)
dialog: "Can't" should never be in a man's
dialog: vocabulary.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Cause when you say can't, you ain't a
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: Zeke.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: What?
dialog: (then)
dialog: Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."
text: Nona just shakes her head.
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: We should head over.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Just you and Quincy, baby. I got a
dialog: meeting.
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: With who?
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Business folks.
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: You just got back from a four game road
dialog: trip.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Nona, don't start bitching. I got maybe
dialog: two years left to play. I'm just trying
dialog: to put some things together for us.
text: Zeke grabs his keys.
speaker_heading: ZEKE (cont'd)
dialog: Later, Quincy.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Later, Dad.
text: Zeke exits. Nona leans against the counter, concerned.
speaker_heading: QUINCY (cont'd)
dialog: Mom?
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: We still have to go?
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Yeah.
scene_heading: INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Camille and Nona stand among the piles of boxes. Monica and
text: Quincy stand at their mothers' sides, stealing glances at
text: each other. A large bandage covers Monica's cheek. Monica
text: holds her card, Camille holds the cake.
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: ...we moved back here when Quincy was
dialog: about five, after Zeke was traded.
dialog: Neighborhood was a little more mixed
dialog: back then...
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: Until the Black family down the street
dialog: became the Black family next door.
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Okay?
text: Camille tries to smooth down Monica's unruly hair. Monica
text: moves her head.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: Well, thanks again. This was really nice
dialog: of you.
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: It was the least we could do. And I love
dialog: to cook.
text: Quincy looks up at his Mom, surprised. She quickly hugs his
text: face into her stomach. Camille lights up.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: Oh, me too. I used to cook for my
dialog: friends' parties and things back in
dialog: Atlanta.
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: You're a caterer?
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled
dialog: and the girls get a little older, it's
dialog: definitely something I want to do.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Since you love to cook, maybe it's
dialog: something we can talk about.
text: Quincy snickers. Nona quickly changes the subject.
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: You know, girl, long as I've lived next
dialog: door, I've never seen the inside of this
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: Really? Well, come on, then.
text: Camille hands Monica the cake.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE (cont'd)
dialog: Honey, put this in the kitchen.
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: Help her, Quincy.
text: Camille and Nona head down the hall, leaving Monica and
text: Quincy alone. The two just stand there.
text: Quincy reaches out, scoops a finger of frosting, and pops it
text: in his mouth. Beat, then Monica takes a bigger scoop.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: So...does it hurt?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: It's this big hole. You could almost see
dialog: bone.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: For real?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Uh huh.
text: Quincy is impressed.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: So how come you could play basketball?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I just can.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I never knew a girl that could play.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: My Mom says she doesn't know where I come
dialog: from 'cause I act different.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Your Dad play?
speaker_heading: MONICA
text: He works at a bank.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: My Dad plays for the "Clippers." He says
dialog: I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma
dialog: play for them, too. Same number and
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I'm going to be number thirty-two, like
dialog: Magic.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: What was the most points your Daddy ever
dialog: got in Junior High?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I don't know. A lot.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: One time Magic scored forty-eight points,
dialog: and they only had six minute quarters and
dialog: he sat out the whole fourth.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: You do act different.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I don't care.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Well, if anybody bothers you, you could
dialog: just tell me cause I run this street.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: She don't know how to box, I bet. My dad
dialog: showed me how to fight like Ali.
text: He shows off a flurry of punches.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: So, I know karate from "Almighty Isis."
text: Monica puts the cake down on a box, does a couple of kicks
text: and hand movements. Quincy is impressed.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Bet you can't do this though.
text: Quincy does a jump kick. Monica does the same.
speaker_heading: QUINCY (cont'd)
dialog: Okay, how bout this?
text: Quincy takes a couple steps back, then does a cartwheel. It
text: looks great, until he crashes into the box with the cake.
text: The cake falls onto his head and shoulder.
text: Monica doubles over, laughing. Quincy is embarrassed.
text: Camille and Nona rush back into the living room.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: Monica, what did you do?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: (to Nona)
dialog: Oh, all that work.
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: It's...it's okay. Can I get a towel?
text: Camille quickly crosses into the kitchen. Quincy stares at
dialog: the floor.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Sorry.
text: Nona bends down, whispers in his ear.
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: No. Good boy.
scene_heading: INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Monica sits between Lena's legs, grimacing, as Lena works a
text: comb through her freshly washed, kinky hair. Monica's head
text: flops like a rag doll. Her eyes are wet.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Ow!
text: Lena keeps tugging.
speaker_heading: MONICA (cont'd)
dialog: Ow, Lena!!!
text: Monica punches her in the leg.
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: Ow!
text: Lena yanks Monica's head back as Camille enters, carrying a
text: yellow dress on a hanger. Monica sees it and her face falls.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Ah, Mom.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: I'm lucky I found it. Someone put your
text: box of dresses under a pile of rags in
dialog: the garbage.
text: Monica sulks. Lena cackles in her ear. Camille has to
dialog: laugh.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE (cont'd)
dialog: Child, pick up your lip.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I hate it.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: Fine, you don't like this one, which one
dialog: would you rather wear?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Pants.
text: Camille rubs her temples, then hangs the dress on the door.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: (to Lena)
dialog: When you're done can you make sure she
dialog: brushes her teeth?
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: I just need to lay down. I've been
dialog: running around all day.
text: Just then, Nathan enters. He holds up two dress shirts as if
dialog: it were a matter of life and death.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Which one for tomorrow?
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: The blue.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: You sure?
text: Camille nods. Nathan looks at both of them, then:
speaker_heading: NATHAN (cont'd)
dialog: Can you iron both tonight just in case?
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Thanks, sweetheart.

speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: The boy next door is riding with you to

text: Quincy is taken aback, stares at her.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: You wanna be my girl?
text: Monica blinks in surprise. She thinks for a moment.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: What do I have to do?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I guess, you know, we play ball and we
dialog: ride to school together. And if you get
dialog: mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I don't like flowers.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: How bout Twinkies? My mom won't ever

speaker_heading: QUINCY (cont'd)

speaker_heading: QUINCY (cont'd)

text: On the floor, MONICA, dribbles down court. Just EIGHTEEN,

text: She whips a no-look, around the back pass to a cutting
text: TEAMMATE under the basket, who scores. The crowd cheers.
text: Monica defends the opposing point guard like a gnat. She

speaker_heading: REFEREE
text: Taunting.
speaker_heading: MONICA

text: Nathan quickly jumps in, tries to clean things up.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's
dialog: time to start thinking about other things
dialog: besides basketball.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: You only have one game left and you
dialog: haven't been recruited. Munchkin, I
dialog: wanted it as bad as you did, but we have
dialog: to face reality.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: The coach from USC is going to be at the
dialog: championship.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I know. But chances are...
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Chances are there's still a chance.
text: Nathan nods. She can always soften her dad, but not her mom.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: If you'd just listen for once, you'd
dialog: realize you have a lot more going for
dialog: yourself. You're smart, you'd be pretty
dialog: if you put a comb to your head. I mean,
dialog: why walk around with your hair looking
dialog: like "whodunit"...?
text: As her mom nags on, Monica looks out the window.
text: OUTSIDE, QUINCY and a GIRL lean against a car parked at the
text: curb, slobbing each other down.
text: Just shy of 18, with a magnetic face and muscular body, he is
text: a brother who drank his chocolate milk. HE IS ALSO THE
text: BROTHER WHO WAS WATCHING MONICA'S GAME FROM THE GYM DOORWAY.
text: Monica watches and her mom's droning voice disappears...
scene_heading: EXT. MCCALL HOUSE - SAME TIME
text: FELICIA, 17, can't get enough of Quincy's lips.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Yo, Felicia, I gotta get to my game.
text: She keeps kissing him.
speaker_heading: QUINCY (cont'd)
dialog: And my mom's about to be home.
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: So I'm not good enough to meet your mom?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Girl, she knew I had a hottie like you
dialog: up inhere, she'd beat the black off me.
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: (kissing him again)
dialog: That's a lot of beating.
text: She finally lets go, and slides into her car. Quincy watches
text: her go with a cocky-ass smile.

scene_heading: INT. CRENSHAW HIGH SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT
text: A frenzied crowd from floor to ceiling watches Quincy explode
text: across the court. He is the complete point guard - hitting
text: from the outside, driving to the hoop, no-look passes,
dialog: playing tight D.'
text: His father, Zeke, now 39, stands on the sideline. His muscle
dialog: has softened a little over the last five years of retirement.
text: Monica sits alone in the bottom row, holding a basketball.
text: She wears jeans and a T-shirt and her hair is pulled back in
text: a simple pony-tail.
text: Quincy does a killer cross-over move and his Defender falls
text: down. He lays up the ball, then taunts the player he just
text: poster-ized. Behind Monica, TWO GIRLS smack each other
text: excitedly. One of them, SHAWNEE, 17, pretty, big chest,
text: slides down into the empty seat next to her.
speaker_heading: SHAWNEE
dialog: Hey, girl.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: SHAWNEE
dialog: Your hair looks so cute like that.
text: Monica knows she's full of shit, doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: SHAWNEE (cont'd)
dialog: So...you know who Q's asking to the
dialog: Spring Dance?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SHAWNEE
dialog: C'mon, girl, you live next door. Who's
dialog: been creeping?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: There's so many I just can't keep track.
speaker_heading: SHAWNEE
dialog: Well, can you give him this for me?
text: Shawnee holds out a folded note. Monica doesn't take it.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Give it yourself.
speaker_heading: SHAWNEE
dialog: I don't wanna look fast.
dialog: (drops it in Monica's lap)
dialog: Thanks, girl.
text: She slides back to her seat. Monica shakes her head, turns
text: back to the game.
text: Quincy dives for a loose ball. Shawnee clutches her friend.
speaker_heading: SHAWNEE (cont'd)
dialog: Good Lord, look at that ass. I just want
text: to lick the sweat off it.
text: Monica takes in his tight body. He does look good. Quincy
text: jogs back down court and flashbulbs go off...
scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CRENSHAW HIGH SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT
text: Flashbulbs. Quincy stands with his dad, his sweat still
text: fresh, talking to a reporter named JIM.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Quincy, word has it you might make the
dialog: jump the NBA.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Don't go starting rumors, Jim. My son's
text: college bound with or without basketball.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: You could make a career by telling me
dialog: where.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Gotta wait til the press conference.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: But you'd love for him to play at USC,
dialog: like you did.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: I'd love for him to get a good education.
dialog: (then)
dialog: That's it.
text: Jim crosses away. Zeke puts an affectionate arm around his
text: son as they walk toward the locker room.
speaker_heading: ZEKE (cont'd)
dialog: We should have another talk with Coach
text: Carril at Princeton.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is
text: going all the way.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: I don't care about the team. I care
dialog: about the school.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Didn't we already have this conversation?
text: Zeke sighs, then:
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: You played good. I was proud of you.
text: Quincy smiles wide.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: (then)
dialog: So you up for a game later?
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: You don't wanna hurt your back.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting.
dialog: Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: You work too hard, Pop.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Let's hope I can say the same about you
dialog: one day.
text: Quincy watches his dad move toward the doors, stopping once
text: to give an autograph. Zeke passes Monica, entering.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Hey, Mr. M.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Hey, Miss Baller.
text: He exits. Monica approaches Quincy.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Way to hoop.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I know this. What do you want?
speaker_heading: MONICA
text: A ride home.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Your legs don't look broke.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Guess "please" would be a stretch.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: (dryly)
dialog: Please.
scene_heading: INT. QUINCY'S JEEP - NIGHT
text: Silence as Quincy wheels his Jeep Wrangler toward home.
text: Monica sits in the passenger seat, basketball in lap. She
text: pulls Shawnee's note from her pocket. Quincy glances it
dialog: over.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give
dialog: to you.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: Big-ass titties?
text: Monica shoots him a disgusted look. Quincy reaches out.
speaker_heading: QUINCY (cont'd)
dialog: Give it here.
text: Monica leans away, reads aloud.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: "Q. I think you are so fine and I've
dialog: been wanting to get with you. Let me
dialog: take you to the Spring Dance and I
dialog: promise I'll leave you satisfied."
text: Monica laughs in disbelief.
speaker_heading: MONICA (cont'd)
dialog: What a ho.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she
dialog: wants to get with me.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: She's a ho cause she's sending her
text: coochie through the mail.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: And? She's not saying, "I think you're a
dialog: nice guy and I wanna get to know you
dialog: better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: So she's honest.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho. But I
dialog: guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Didn't know you cared so much.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I don't.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: So who you going to the dance with,
dialog: Spalding?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Who's Spalding?
text: Quincy looks down at the SPALDING BASKETBALL in her lap and
text: cracks up. Monica glares.
speaker_heading: MONICA (cont'd)
dialog: Fuck you, Quincy.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: See, that's why you ain't getting
dialog: recruited.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Who said I'm not getting recruited?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Your hot-ass temper.
text: Monica points to the scar on her cheek.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I'm not the one who put this scar here.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: God, here we go.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: When we were eleven years old cause he
dialog: was about to lose.
text: Quincy turns, faces her.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: That's it, give it your best shot.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Would you watch the damn road?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I mean it, give it your best shot, cause
dialog: I'm tired of you holding that over my
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I'm warning you. You don't stall that
dialog: bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.
text: Quincy pulls his Jeep into his driveway.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk
dialog: smack and you get a pat on your ass. But
dialog: because I'm a female, I get told to calm
dialog: down and act like a "lady". I'm a
dialog: ballplayer, okay. A ball player.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
text: With a jacked-up attitude.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Didn't know you cared so much.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I don't.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Good.
text: Monica slams out of the Jeep and walks across the lawn to her
text: house. Quincy exits his ride.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MCCALL HOUSE - ENTRY WAY - SHORT TIME LATER
text: Quincy steps inside, drops his bag on the floor. His mom,
text: Nona, approaches from the dining room.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: What's up, Moms.
text: Nona holds up a large hoop earring.
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Uh, your earring?
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: I look like some hoochie to you? I
dialog: found it on your floor.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: What are you doing in my room?
dialog: Quincy crosses into:
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: Nona follows. Quincy pulls open the fridge, grabs a couple
text: of slices of cold pizza.
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass
dialog: girls.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: We were just studying.
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: I'm not playing with you, these girls are

speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: You hearing me?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I've been hearing you.

speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and

speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: Still the man.
speaker_heading: QUINCY

speaker_heading: NONA

speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Said he'd be home later.
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: Later when?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I don't know, he had a meeting or

scene_heading: INT. MCCALL HOUSE - ZEKE AND NONA'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT

speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: I had some players to see and hands to

speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: At one in the morning?
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a

speaker_heading: NONA

speaker_heading: NONA (cont'd)
dialog: I didn't mean it like that.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found

speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: I have.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: You said you'd think about going back to

speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: No, you said I should get my degree. I

dialog: Til then, don't worry, there's just

speaker_heading: NONA

speaker_heading: ZEKE

scene_heading: EXT. MCCALL AND WRIGHT HOUSES - CONTINUOUS
text: Quincy crosses the grass to Monica's window, knocks quietly.

dialog: pulls himself through...
scene_heading: INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Now a routine, Monica tosses Quincy one of her pillows and

speaker_heading: LENA

speaker_heading: MONICA

speaker_heading: MONICA (cont'd)

speaker_heading: MONICA

speaker_heading: LENA

speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: So what's going on with the Spring Dance?
dialog: You have a date yet?
speaker_heading: MONICA

speaker_heading: MONICA

speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Oh, great.
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: You do.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Yeah, right.
speaker_heading: LENA

speaker_heading: LENA (cont'd)
dialog: We'll do something cute with your hair,

speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I don't know how to walk in heels.
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: Hey. You just worry about playing your

dialog: Let me worry about your date.

speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: You ever been in love?
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: Too many times.
speaker_heading: MONICA

dialog: for his Dad to come on before laying it up.
text: Zeke smiles, tells Quincy to bring that shit on again.
text: Quincy tries his cross-over again and this time Zeke picks
dialog: him clean.
text: Zeke taunts him as he easily backs in on him to the basket.

speaker_heading: CAMILLE

text: Monica sighs, takes a bite. It's good.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE (cont'd)

speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: You really should be a caterer or

speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: Sure. In between all the other things I

speaker_heading: COACH HISERMAN
dialog: I don't have to tell you girls how big

speaker_heading: TEAM
dialog: Cougars!
text: As Monica moves to center court, she glances up at the USC

scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CRENSHAW GYM - NIGHT

text: Monica suddenly reaches in and knocks the ball loose. As she
text: goes for the ball, a WHISTLE.
speaker_heading: REFEREE
text: Reaching in, number thirty-two. One-and-

speaker_heading: COACH HISERMAN
dialog: Monica!
text: Monica catches herself, turns the word "shit" into a

text: Monica lines up for the free-throw, clenching her fists. The
text: girl hits the first one. Then, she hits the second.
text: With ten seconds left, down by one, Monica drives down court
text: and throws up a prayer. EVERYONE IS ON THEIR FEET AS THE
text: BALL SPINS AROUND THE RIM. AND THEN...IT POPS OUT. An
text: opposing player grabs the rebound and Monica has no choice
dialog: but to foul her.
text: Monica has just fouled out. She walks to her bench and drops

dialog: So, you like school?
text: Monica smiles nervously, nods.
speaker_heading: JASON (cont'd)
dialog: Yeah, high school was cool. I don't
dialog: remember sisters being as fine as you,
dialog: though.
text: Monica just holds that nervous smile.
speaker_heading: JASON (cont'd)
dialog: So what do you like studying?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Gym.
text: He waits for more, but nothing comes.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: I'm an English major. You like English?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Sort of.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: Careful.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: That was two words.
text: Monica ducks her head, embarrassed. Jason laughs.
speaker_heading: JASON (cont'd)
dialog: Girl, how come you're so stressed?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: I mean, I'm having a good time with

text: His arm slides off the back of her chair and onto her
dialog: shoulders.
speaker_heading: JASON (cont'd)
dialog: So tell me what I have to do to make you
dialog: have a good time with me.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: My mouth is kinda dry.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: Then I'll get you some punch.
text: He stands, then.
speaker_heading: JASON (cont'd)
dialog: Just don't jet while I'm gone and leave a
text: glass slipper behind.
text: Monica's face lights up. Jason smiles.
speaker_heading: JASON (cont'd)
dialog: There we go.
text: He crosses away to the refreshment table. Monica smiles
text: wider, leans back in her chair with her legs splayed. She
text: catches herself and quickly crosses them.
text: A couple of guys pass by and check her out. Monica smiles
text: wider. Quincy steps up, holding two cups of punch.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: You having fun?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So who is this clown?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: He ain't Spalding.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Guess not.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: So you took Shawnee, huh?
text: The DJ puts on "Make It Last Forever" by Keith Sweat.
text: Couples move to the dance floor.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: You know, it was late and she asked...
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: You want to dance?
text: Jason stands behind her chair. Monica smiles shyly.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Sure.
text: Jason puts down her cup of punch, takes her hand, leads her
text: to the dance floor.
text: Quincy just shakes his head, then crosses to his table, grabs
text: Shawnee's hand.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: C'mon.
text: He pulls Shawnee to the middle of the floor.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: Monica, nervous at first, a little awkward, but Jason gently
text: guides her in a slow circle and she starts to relax.
text: Jason moves his hands down Monica's back, pulling her in
text: closer. Shawnee snuggles into Quincy's chest, runs her hands
text: down his neck. The heat from bodies grows.
text: Monica and Quincy glance up at the same time and catch each
text: other's eyes. They start to look away but find they can't.
text: Eyes locked as they dance, they move together, almost feel
text: each other. Finally, as their bodies turn, they lose sight.
text: Monica puts her head to Jason's chest, Quincy slides his
text: hands lower down Shawnee's back. The music continues...
scene_heading: INT. JASON'S CAR - NIGHT
text: Jason and Monica are parked up on Mulholland Drive. LL Cool
text: J's "I Need Love" plays on the tape deck.
text: Jason has his arm around Monica, ready to make his move.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: (rattling)
dialog: Freshman year, my free throw percentage
dialog: was fifty-one percent, cause I was
text: shooting it like a jump shot.
text: Jason leans in, kisses her bare shoulder.
speaker_heading: MONICA (cont'd)
dialog: Um...but then sophomore year I was
dialog: shooting seventy-five percent from the
dialog: line.
text: Jason kisses her neck.
speaker_heading: MONICA (cont'd)
dialog: ...uh, by keeping my feet set and really
text: following through.
text: Jason goes in for the slam dunk. Kisses Monica on the lips.
text: It's the first time she's really been kissed. Jason pulls
text: away, smiles.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: That was nice.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: Your sister told me hands off, but I
dialog: can't help myself...
text: Jason leans in. Monica closes her eyes, and they kiss some
text: more. Monica tries to follow his practiced lips.
text: Jason's tongue slides in and their bodies slide down. His
text: hand moves across her breast. Monica's eyes pop open.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Wait...
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: Shh. It's okay.
text: Naive and inexperienced, Monica shuts her eyes tight.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

scene_heading: E WRIGHT HOUSE -NIGHT
text: Jason's car pulls off, Monica slowly moves to her front door.
text: She looks in the living room window. Her mom is asleep in a
text: chair, trying to wait up.
text: Monica catches her reflection in the window. She glares at
text: her made-up face, then wipes at her mouth with her hand.
text: She steps back , walks to her bedroom window. She pulls it
text: open, kicks off her heels and climbs through.
scene_heading: INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Monica moves to her bed and drops down. She sits motionless
text: for a beat, then suddenly feels something beneath her. She
text: reaches for it. IT'S A LETTER FROM THE USC ATHLETIC
text: DEPARTMENT. Monica stares at it in her hands...
text: Light suddenly cuts through the darkness. Monica turns and
text: is surprised to see Quincy standing in the middle of his
text: room, pulling off his jacket. Monica moves to her window,
text: pulls it open.
speaker_heading: MONICA
speaker_heading: Psst.
text: Quincy looks over. Beat. Then he climbs out of his window,
text: drops down.
scene_heading: EXT. WRIGHT AND MCCALL HOUSES - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Early night for you, isn't it?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I was about to ask you the same thing,
text: going out with a college boy and all.
text: Monica doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: QUINCY (cont'd)
dialog: So where'd you go after?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: (beat)
text: Mulholland Drive.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Figures.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: So what dead-end street did you and
dialog: Shawnee hit?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: None of your business.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left
dialog: you satisfied.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: That what you think?
text: Monica shrugs.
speaker_heading: QUINCY (cont'd)
dialog: Little after you left, I told Shawnee it
dialog: was time to go and I drove her ass
dialog: straight home. And after she told me I
dialog: was the dumbest brother in the world, I
dialog: took off.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Cause I don't just stick my dick in
dialog: anything.
text: Monica takes this in.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I was sitting in Jason's ride with him
dialog: kissing on me and feeling on me and it
dialog: was really bugging me cause I couldn't
dialog: remember how many offensive boards I had
dialog: in the championship. And then I guess
dialog: she got tired of me sort of accidentally
text: kneeing him in the balls.
text: Beat, then Quincy cracks up. Monica laughs with him.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Four.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: You had four offensive rebounds.
text: Monica stares at him, surprised. She thinks.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Hold up for a second.
text: Monica disappears back inside. Beat, then she re-appears.
text: She climbs out her window, drops down. Quincy looks at her.
text: She holds out the envelope from USC.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: When'd you get this?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: It was on my bed when I came in.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Can you just...?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You sure?
text: Monica nods. Quincy takes the envelope, sits down on the
text: grass. Monica sits down beside him. He tears open the
text: envelope and pulls out the letter.
text: Monica stares at him as he reads, trying to see an answer in
text: his face. Quincy finally looks up. Expressionless.
speaker_heading: QUINCY (cont'd)
dialog: Damn girl...
text: Monica's face falls. And then, a slow smile spreads across
text: Quincy's face.
speaker_heading: QUINCY (cont'd)
dialog: They want you.
text: Monica grabs the letter, reads. Her head just drops as a
text: tidal wave of relief washes over her.
text: Quincy smiles.
speaker_heading: QUINCY (cont'd)
dialog: Congratulations.
text: Monica looks up, cheesing.
speaker_heading: QUINCY (cont'd)
dialog: I'm gonna be there, too. I'm announcing
dialog: tomorrow.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I knew it.
text: Monica can't contain her excitement. Without thinking, she
text: gives Quincy a kiss. They pull away, then break into nervous
dialog: laughter.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: What was that about?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I know, right?
text: But they both want more. They lean in, kiss deeply. They
text: fall back on the grass. And kiss. And kiss.
text: Suddenly, Monica pulls away, sits up. Quincy follows,
text: instantly apologetic. Monica stares at him, then to his
text: surprise, she reaches over, gives his shirt a small tug with
dialog: her finger.
text: Quincy stares at her, then slowly pulls off his tie. He
text: nervously unbuttons his shirt. He fumbles with the last two
dialog: buttons.
text: Monica slowly pulls down the straps of her dress, self-
text: conscious. Quincy can't keep his eyes off her.
text: He pulls off his pants. Monica glances down and her eyes
text: widen. She looks scared to death. Quincy smiles softly,
text: leans in and gently kisses her. She relaxes. They lay down.
text: Quincy reaches into his pants for a condom. His hands shake
text: as he puts it on. They stare at each other as he moves on
text: top of her.
text: Quincy pushes inside her. She flinches back in pain. Quincy
text: immediately stops as tears spring to her eyes.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: (softly)
dialog: You want to stop?
text: Monica shakes her head. Quincy pushes inside again. He
text: looks down at her with tenderness, moves gently, kisses her
dialog: tears...

speaker_heading: COACH MILLER
dialog: I don't know some of you very well yet,

dialog: being nice to you.
text: Laughter from the upperclassmen.
speaker_heading: COACH MILLER (cont'd)
dialog: But my philosophy is simple. Hard work
dialog: and sacrifice.
dialog: There's a lot of basketball history and
dialog: pride here at USC, but just putting on
dialog: the cardinal and gold doesn't make you a
dialog: great player. Hard work and sacrifice
dialog: makes you a great player. What you were
dialog: doesn't matter anymore. For the first
dialog: time in your life, you won't be the best.
dialog: You'll be going up against women that are
dialog: bigger and stronger and better than you
dialog: ever imagined. So the question is, how
dialog: will you respond? Well, your answer
dialog: better be hard work and sacrifice because
dialog: that's the only way you're gonna make it
dialog: through. Vince Lombardi preached it and
dialog: I teach it, "There is only one way to
dialog: succeed at anything and that is to give
dialog: everything."
text: Coach Miller pauses a moment to let her words sink in.
text: Monica glances at her fellow freshman for their reactions.
text: Like her, a lot of cockiness, a lot of fear.
speaker_heading: COACH MILLER (cont'd)
text: A few simple rules. Eleven o'clock
dialog: curfew, no exceptions. Always be on
dialog: time, no exceptions. Attend every class,
dialog: no exceptions. No drugs, no alcohol, no
dialog: getting pregnant. And finally, respect
dialog: yourselves, respect your coaches and
dialog: respect your teammates, right Sidra?
text: SIDRA, senior point guard, nods from the second row.
speaker_heading: SIDRA
dialog: That's right, Coach.
speaker_heading: COACH MILLER
dialog: By the end of this year some of you will
dialog: hate me...
text: The upperclassmen crack up.
speaker_heading: COACH MILLER (cont'd)
dialog: Some of you will want to go home...
speaker_heading: UPPERCLASSMEN
dialog: (cat-calling)
dialog: Cree!
text: CREE, junior forward, ducks her head sheepishly. Coach
text: Miller smiles.
speaker_heading: COACH MILLER
dialog: But I guarantee you, if you work hard and
dialog: sacrifice, all of you will be better
dialog: basketball players and better people.
text: Monica nods, accepting the challenge.
scene_heading: EXT. TRACK - EARLY MORNING

text: From the sideline.
speaker_heading: COACH MILLER
dialog: Let's go, freshmen, you're getting
dialog: spanked!

scene_heading: INT. CAMPUS GYM - MORNING

speaker_heading: COACH MILLER (cont'd)
dialog: Get lower, Monica, move your feet.
text: Monica grimaces as she squats lower.
speaker_heading: COACH MILLER (cont'd)
dialog: I said lower!
text: Coach Miller stops her, squats down low beside her.
speaker_heading: COACH MILLER (cont'd)
dialog: This is low, got it? Offense sells

text: Monica starts again.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPUS GYM - MORNING
text: The team stands along the baseline. Monica stands right
text: below the free throw line.
text: TONI, 6'4", 200 pound senior, drives the lane. Monica steps

speaker_heading: SIDRA
dialog: Dag, you took her out, T.
text: Teammates SANDRA and LISA crack up.
speaker_heading: SANDRA

scene_heading: INT. WEIGHT ROOM - LATE DAY

text: Monica lifts it with Sidra's help.
speaker_heading: SIDRA (cont'd)
dialog: That's it.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Coach hates me, doesn't she?
speaker_heading: SIDRA
dialog: She hates all freshmen.
text: Monica scowls, discouraged.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: What's up with that?
speaker_heading: SIDRA
dialog: Hey, don't take it personal. And don't
dialog: think just cause we play the same
dialog: position we have to compete with each
dialog: other. We're teammates, okay?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Thanks, Sidra.
speaker_heading: SIDRA
dialog: Besides. I've been starting point the

scene_heading: EXT. USC CAMPUS - LATE MORNING

speaker_heading: MONICA

speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I can't be nice to a fan?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Fine, Quincy.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I can't help girls coming up to me.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I said fine.
text: Quincy looks at her sulking. He suddenly pulls her down onto

speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: It's okay, little baby.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: (struggling)
dialog: Quit.
text: Quincy grips her tighter, rocks her. Students pass by,

speaker_heading: MONICA

speaker_heading: COACH MILLER (cont'd)

speaker_heading: COACH MILLER

speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Yo, where's the "D"?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Right here.
text: Monica turns, finds Quincy butt-naked. He moves her against

speaker_heading: MONICA

speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I wanted you to.

speaker_heading: ROBIN ROBERTS
dialog: ...USC. The women of Troy made it to the

dialog: the best in the nation. The highlight of
dialog: that class,...
scene_heading: INT. ESPN STUDIOS
speaker_heading: DICK VITALE
dialog: ...is Quincy McCall, one of my diaper
dialog: dandies. He's a real P.T.P., a prime-
dialog: time player. Every college in the

text: in his father's footsteps and become a
dialog: Trojan. He's gonna have a lot on his
dialog: shoulders this season...
scene_heading: INT. BASKETBALL COURT
speaker_heading: ROBIN ROBERTS
dialog: ...but Coach Cheryl Miller feels that if

dialog: against UNLV, as...
scene_heading: INT. SPORTS ARENA - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. CAMPUS GYM - NIGHT
text: Coach Miller motions to Monica. She jumps up, pulls off her

speaker_heading: QUINCY (cont'd)
dialog: They can't stop me, Pop...
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: What are you having, Zeke?
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Genuine Draft. And an orange juice for

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Cross-over's looking good, Quincy. I
dialog: know your old man didn't teach you that.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Didn't need a cross-over to post you up.
text: Terry laughs as he moves off to fix the drinks. Something is
text: on Zeke's mind, but before he can speak on it...
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: You know, the numbers I'm putting up are
dialog: better than any freshman. Some people
dialog: are saying I'm a definite lottery pick.
text: Zeke suddenly focuses.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: What people?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: You know, people.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Well, tell them to mind their damn
dialog: business. You're smart enough to get a
dialog: degree.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I'm also good enough to go pro.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: You know how much higher the play level
dialog: is in the NBA? Give yourself time to
dialog: develop, Quincy. Get an education. The
dialog: NBA ain't going nowhere.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: You came out early.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Your mom got pregnant and I had to make
dialog: choices. You don't have a choice.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Okay...
dialog: Silence, then.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Besides, the sooner you go pro, the
dialog: sooner you'll have to deal with the mess
dialog: I'm dealing with.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: What mess?
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: there's this thing out there. This
dialog: paternity suit.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Some girl that's been hanging on at every
dialog: party. now I'm supposed to be her baby's
dialog: Daddy.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be
dialog: the one who told you.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Tell me what?
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: I just told you.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I mean, it's not true, is it?
text: Zeke stares at his son.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: You got the balls to ask me that?
text: Quincy can't hold his father's look. Zeke shakes his head,
dialog: hurt.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say
dialog: it. It's not true.
text: Quincy looks in his father's eyes, knows he's telling the
dialog: truth.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: So what are you gonna do?
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: I want this thing to go to court, but my
dialog: lawyer's telling me to settle.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: A case like this could hang around for
dialog: months and I'm up for this player
dialog: relations job with the "Clips." This
dialog: gets out, false or not, no one'll touch
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: What's Mom think?
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: We haven't exactly been living the fairy-
dialog: tale life the past few years. Something
dialog: like this happens, it either brings a
dialog: family closer or pushes them further
dialog: apart. We'll just have to see how it
text: plays out.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I'm giving her some space, couple
dialog: days...
text: Just then, a COLLEGE STUDENT approaches.
speaker_heading: COLLEGE STUDENT
dialog: Yo, Q-man, great game.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Thanks.
text: The student holds out a piece of paper, without even a glance
dialog: to Zeke.
speaker_heading: COLLEGE STUDENT
dialog: Can I get an autograph?
text: Quincy nods, signs the guy's paper. Zeke watches his son,
dialog: the rising star.
scene_heading: EXT. MCCALL HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Through the windows, we see Quincy enter the house. He
text: glances around, then walks to the living room. He sees his
text: mom sitting outside by the pool, drink in hand, looking torn
text: up. He pulls open the sliding glass door. Nona jumps, then
text: sees Quincy. She quickly puts her drink down.
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: You scared me.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Sorry. You okay?
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: I'm fine.
text: Quincy glances at her half-hidden glass.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Last time I remember you drinking was
dialog: when Marvin Gaye died.
dialog: No response from Nona.
speaker_heading: QUINCY (cont'd)
dialog: This about Dad?
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: Guess he talked to you.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Don't sweat it, okay. Sooner or later
dialog: the truth'll come out.
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Whose truth are you talking about?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Mom, we can't let something like this
dialog: mess up the family.
text: She doesn't respond. Quincy studies her.
speaker_heading: QUINCY (cont'd)
dialog: I mean, you believe him, right?
text: Nona sits silent, humiliated.
speaker_heading: QUINCY (cont'd)
dialog: Mom?
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: Just...leave it alone.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: This is just about money, you know that.
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: Quincy, please...
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I mean, how many times have you told me
dialog: yourself to watch out for these ho's?
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: Guess I should have been telling your
dialog: father.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: So you're gonna take the word of some
dialog: trick over Pop's? He wouldn't lie.
text: Nona grabs an envelope beside her and throws it at him.
text: Confused, Quincy opens it. HE PULLS OUT A COUPLE OF PHOTOS:
text: Zeke outside a party. IN ONE PHOTO, his arm is around a
text: young woman. IN ANOTHER PHOTO, they KISS. AND YET ANOTHER,
text: they climb into his car.
speaker_heading: QUINCY (cont'd)
dialog: What...what's this?
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: I hired somebody. How pathetic is that?
dialog: After all his late nights and "meetings"
dialog: and I still needed proof.
text: Quincy just stares at the photos.
speaker_heading: NONA (cont'd)
dialog: I used to think I was lucky just to be
dialog: married to Zeke McCall, but I'm too

dialog: his every word like he's God or
dialog: something...
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I know he messed up, but that doesn't
dialog: change what he's been to you.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: What has he been to me? I mean, he
dialog: looked me in my face and lied like it was
dialog: nothing. Like it was easy.
dialog: (then)
text: And I'm standing there getting loud on my
dialog: mom like she's the one with no sense...
speaker_heading: MONICA
text: She understands.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: He even had me wanting to play for the
dialog: "Clippers." Man, how stupid am I.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: You're not stupid.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I know a lot of brothers dog their wives,
dialog: I just never thought my pops would do
dialog: some shit like this...
text: Monica puts her arms around him. They sit there, quiet.
text: Monica glances up at the clock tower. She reacts. Quincy
dialog: notices.
speaker_heading: QUINCY (cont'd)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Nothing.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Why don't we walk to my dorm?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I'm not up for running into anybody.
dialog: Let's just kick it here, alright?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I...can't.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew.
dialog: If I'm late, I don't suit up.
text: Quincy looks at her, almost in shock.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Didn't realize you were watching the

speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Nah. Don't sweat it.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Quincy...
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: For real. I should be alone, anyway.

speaker_heading: MONICA

scene_heading: INT. MONICA/SHAYLA'S DORM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: MONICA

speaker_heading: SHAYLA

speaker_heading: MONICA

speaker_heading: SHAYLA
dialog: Mon, Sidra's out for one game, and you

scene_heading: INT. SPORTS ARENA - LATE DAY
text: A sellout crowd for the men's SC/Temple game. And Quincy is

scene_heading: INT. CAMPUS GYM - CONTINUOUS
text: Monica's game. Late second half. SC down two.
text: Monica drives the lane, drawing two defenders. She looks

dialog: but net. SC up one.
text: Coach Miller claps intensely on the sideline.
speaker_heading: COACH MILLER
dialog: That's it, that's it!
text: Ten seconds left. Game on the line. Monica tries to lob a

text: It is a one-on-one between Monica and the guard. The girl
text: drives hard for the winning hoop. Monica races to the key
text: and slides in front of her. The guard goes up and slams into
text: Monica. Both crash to the floor as the ball drops through

speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: I think ol' girl took out your chi-chis

speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Kiss my ass.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: Nah, I think she took that too.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Sandra, please, last time you chest-

text: More laughter. Monica looks over at Toni, sitting quietly at
dialog: the bench.
speaker_heading: MONICA (cont'd)
dialog: Yo, T, why you so quiet?
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don't want to go play overseas.
speaker_heading: DORA
dialog: I thought you were hyped about going to

speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: It's never gonna be like this. Playing

speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: Nah, there's always a McDonald's.
speaker_heading: SIDRA

dialog: What about you?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Maybe it'd be worth it if I knew some day

speaker_heading: COACH MILLER

speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: COACH MILLER
dialog: We've got our final games against Oregon
dialog: and Oregon State and I want to shake
dialog: things up a bit, so I'm starting you at

speaker_heading: MONICA

speaker_heading: COACH MILLER
dialog: You want the job or not?
text: Realization finally hits.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Yeah. Yes.
text: Monica looks at Coach Miller completely thrown.
speaker_heading: COACH MILLER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: It's just...it seems like you're always
dialog: yelling at me.
speaker_heading: COACH MILLER
dialog: You think I'd go hoarse for a player with

speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Thanks.
text: Another PARTY-GOER grabs her arm.
scene_heading: PARTY-GOER
dialog: Girl, you can play.

speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Reg. You seen Quincy?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: What's up, girl.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: (louder)

speaker_heading: REGGIE

text: She laughs, tires to move away, but they won't let her go.
text: Monica gives in, grooves with them.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON:
text: Quincy walks through the door with a half-empty forty in his

text: Quincy sees Monica on the dance floor. He stands, watching
text: her. Takes a drink. Monica finally looks over, sees him.
text: She smiles, crosses to him.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: What's up?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I've been trying to find you all day.

speaker_heading: SHAYLA

dialog: Your girl was on tonight. She tell you?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I heard.
speaker_heading: SHAYLA
dialog: She also tell you she ganked the starting
dialog: spot from Sidra?
text: Monica looks at him for a reaction.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Nah.
text: He downs the last of his forty.
speaker_heading: QUINCY (cont'd)
dialog: Where's the keg at?
speaker_heading: SHAYLA

text: He laughs, then turns back to Quincy.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Coach is gonna kill us in practice

text: Quincy just looks at him.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: That's funny.
text: Monica leans against Quincy, affectionately.
speaker_heading: MONICA

speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: You think for once we could talk about
dialog: something besides basketball?
speaker_heading: SHAYLA
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Whatever's clever.
text: Silence. Reggie and Shayla crack up. Quincy shakes his

speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Y'all need to quit.
dialog: She starts for Quincy
speaker_heading: SIDRA (O.S.)
dialog: Monica.
text: Monica looks over, sees Sidra standing in the doorway. There

scene_heading: INT. HOUSEPARTY - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: What's up?
speaker_heading: SIDRA
dialog: Just wanted to say good game.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: But?
speaker_heading: SIDRA
dialog: No buts. Took a lot of heart to take
dialog: that charge.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: SIDRA
dialog: But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni.
dialog: Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.
text: Monica shakes her head. An awkward silence.
speaker_heading: SIDRA (cont'd)
dialog: I'd be lying if I said I wasn't pissed.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: SIDRA
dialog: Just one word of advice for next season.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: SIDRA
dialog: Never let a freshman take your spot.

speaker_heading: KERRY
dialog: Excuse me.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Excuse me.
text: He steps aside as she tries to work the keg. Nothing comes

speaker_heading: KERRY
dialog: If that's the last beer, you and I are
dialog: sharing.
text: Shayla glances over as Quincy pumps the keg a couple of
text: times. Kerry hands him her cup and he starts filling it up.
speaker_heading: KERRY (cont'd)
dialog: I like watching you play. Number twenty-
dialog: two.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Guess you didn't see the game.

speaker_heading: KERRY

speaker_heading: QUINCY

speaker_heading: KERRY

speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Who was that?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Nobody.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Who's nobody?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Look, this party's whack. You ready to

speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: You want to go talk?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Not really.
text: He leans in, kisses her drunkenly. She pulls away.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: We could finish what we were talking
dialog: about last night.
text: Quincy kisses her again.
speaker_heading: MONICA (cont'd)
dialog: Q...
dialog: (pushing him off)
dialog: Quincy, quit. You're drunk.
text: They fall silent.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: You know what, I'm just gonna crash.
speaker_heading: MONICA

speaker_heading: QUINCY

scene_heading: INT. QUINCY/REGGIE'S SUITE - LIVING ROOM - LATER
text: Quincy pushes through his front door, then stops short in his
text: doorway. Zeke sits on the couch.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Your door was unlocked.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Still is, so let yourself out.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: We need to talk.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: We ain't got nothing to talk about.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: I messed up, okay, I know that. But I
dialog: ain't that kid's father.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Lucky kid.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Look, I ain't saying it was right, but
dialog: sometimes things happen.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: And some things should never fucking
dialog: happen!
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Boy, you're so perfect you can look down
dialog: on me?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I ain't a damn liar.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Your mom was real quick to show you those
dialog: pictures, wasn't she?
dialog: Well, she was nineteen when she got
dialog: pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're
dialog: the best thing in my life, but she knew I
dialog: wasn't ready for no marriage.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: So now you're saying my mother trapped
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: I'm saying I handled my responsibilities
dialog: like a man. But when you're in the NBA,
dialog: you pull into a city and there's a
text: hundred women waiting at the hotel. And
dialog: another twenty that made it past security
dialog: on your floor. And the boldest one is
dialog: standing right at your door. And after
text: awhile, it just becomes part of the game.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't
dialog: have. But I did it cause I love you.
text: Zeke looks at his son, meaning every word. Quincy stares
text: back, long and hard.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Since we're being honest, guess I should
dialog: tell you. I'm dropping out of school and
dialog: going pro.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: What?
text: Quincy just stares back.
speaker_heading: ZEKE (cont'd)
dialog: Quincy, you'd be making the biggest
dialog: mistake of your life.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: From your mouth.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: (desperate)
dialog: I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't
dialog: let you do this.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Always thought "can't" wasn't in a man's
dialog: vocabulary.
text: Zeke is taken aback by the hatred in his son's eyes. He
text: turns and without another word, exits.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - LATE NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. CAMPUS GYM - LATE DAY

text: as her opponent tries to wrestle away the ball...
scene_heading: EXT. QUINCY/REGGIE'S SUITE - DUSK
text: Monica walks down the hall to Quincy's suite. The window is

scene_heading: INT. QUINCY/REGGIE'S SUITE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Reggie sits on the couch with a TEAMMATE, playing Nintendo's

speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Hey, y'all.
text: They barely give her a nod. Monica crosses into
scene_heading: INT. QUINCY/REGGIE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Quincy stands at an ironing board, ironing a T-shirt.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Hey, what's up.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: You weren't at my game.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Yeah, sorry about that. I had this

text: Quincy pulls on the T-shirt.
speaker_heading: QUINCY (cont'd)

speaker_heading: MONICA

speaker_heading: QUINCY

speaker_heading: MONICA

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Hey, you.
speaker_heading: KERRY
dialog: Hi.
text: Quincy gives her a hug. Monica stares at him in disbelief.

speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Oh, Kerry, this is Monica. Monica,
dialog: Kerry.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: What the hell's going on?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: We're going to get some food.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Are you out of your mind?
speaker_heading: KERRY
dialog: Maybe I should come back?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: No. You stay, I'll leave.
text: She storms out.
scene_heading: EXT. WRIGHT HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DUSK
text: BAM! Monica slams her car door. Her face is a mask of anger
dialog: and confusion.
text: Camille exits the house, car keys in hand. She sees her.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: Monica. What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Didn't know I needed a reason to come
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: Don't be defensive. I'm just surprised
dialog: to see you.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Dad around?
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
text: He's still at the bank.

speaker_heading: CAMILLE (cont'd)
dialog: Everything okay?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: (clearly not)
dialog: Yeah.
text: Camille just nods, doesn't bother asking again.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: Well, I'm going to get dinner.
text: She pulls open her car door. Beat, then...
speaker_heading: CAMILLE (cont'd)
dialog: It's just a game.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: Whenever you lose, you get this attitude.
dialog: But it's just a game.
text: Monica rolls her eyes, as her mom leaves.
scene_heading: EXT. DORMS - NIGHT
text: Quincy sits on the wall outside of Monica's dorm, as Monica
text: slowly makes her way up the walk. She sees him, stops.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Can we talk?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Talk to your new girlfriend.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I just took the ho to Burger King,
dialog: alright.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Cheap date.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Least she had time for me.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: So you fucked around to prove a point!
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I just said I didn't fuck around. But
dialog: you got your head so far up your ass it
dialog: took a cheap date for you to notice me.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your
dialog: ass like everybody else?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: You forgot to be there.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: That night you wanted to talk about your
dialog: Dad I had a curfew. What was I supposed
dialog: to do?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Stay!
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Least you got your priorities straight.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I never asked you to choose.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Never had to.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I'm a ballplayer. If anyone knows what
dialog: that means it should be you.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Well, if all you care about is
dialog: basketball, why you fucking me? Go fuck
dialog: Dick Vitale.
text: Monica punches the shit out of Quincy, then pushes past him.
text: Quincy grabs her arm, stopping her.
speaker_heading: QUINCY (cont'd)
dialog: Hold up. I'm sorry, alright.
text: They stand, silent. Trying to come down from their anger.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: How do I know next time you're feeling
dialog: neglected or whatever, you're not going
dialog: to run around on me? If we're going to
dialog: be together I have to be able to trust
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I'm not asking for us to be together.
text: Monica flinches in shock.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I'm going through a lot of shit right
dialog: now, more than you have time for.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: How are you going to tell me what I have
dialog: time for? I mean, whatever I did...we
dialog: can fix this.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: You don't think so?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Look, I'm entering the draft.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: You're what?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I decided to go pro. And who knows where
dialog: I'll end up, you know?
text: Monica's heart is sinking fast.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: When did you decide all this?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Few days ago.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: So that's it, just forget about us?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Damnitt, Monica. This ain't about us
dialog: anymore, it's about me.
text: Monica is crushed. Beat as, Quincy struggles to stay cold.
speaker_heading: QUINCY (cont'd)
dialog: But, you know, I'd still like us to be
dialog: friends.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Friends.
text: She fights back tears. Quincy has to look away. Monica
dialog: can't respond.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: So...I guess I'll see you around.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Uh huh.
text: Beat, then Quincy turns and walks away. Monica tries to
text: fight her tears but her pain, hurt and confusion are too
text: much. Finally, she gives in, and the tears fall.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
text: FOOTAGE. Press conference. Magic sits beside his wife

scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF SPAIN - LATE DAY
text: Monica jogs down the congested cobble-stone street, a sports
text: bag over her shoulder. She is TWENTY-THREE. Half-assed
text: braids frame her matured features.
text: She passes store fronts, street vendors, and dodges
text: pedestrians, as she makes her way toward a large, older
dialog: arena.
scene_heading: EXT. ARENA - CONTINUOUS
text: An excited crowd jockeys for position at the front doors.
text: Above them, a huge banner reads "Campeonato de Europeo".
dialog: (European Championships".)
text: As Monica heads for the back entrance, a cheer goes up from a
text: large contingent in the crowd. Monica smiles, waves back.
text: TWO LITTLE GIRLS break from line, run to her.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRLS
dialog: Baloncesto! Balencesto! (Basketball!
dialog: Basketball!)
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Oye.
text: They giggle, hold out a piece of paper and a pencil.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRLS
dialog: Autografo.
text: As Monica signs her autograph, a tall woman carrying a
text: matching sports bag approaches. She is LUISA, Spanish, 33.
speaker_heading: LUISA
dialog: (thick Spanish accent)
dialog: Monica. What is up?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Oye, Luisa.
text: Monica hands the girls her autograph and they run off.
speaker_heading: LUISA
dialog: Large game, no?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Si. Large game.
text: They duck into the arena.
scene_heading: INT. ARENA - LOCKER ROOM - LATE DAY
text: Paint peels off the walls. Windows are broken overhead.
text: Monica sits alone at her locker, taping her own ankles. Her
text: TEN TEAMMATES, all from Spain, sit on the surrounding
text: benches, talking and joking among themselves in Spanish.
text: Monica is clearly an outsider.
text: COACH PARRA, Spanish, late 40's, enters.
speaker_heading: COACH PARRA
dialog: Silenco!
text: The women immediately stop talking. COACH PARRA gives an
text: animated, impassioned speech in Spanish. Monica doesn't
text: understand a word, just continues taping her ankles.
text: Coach Parra finishes and the women clap, pumped up. Monica
text: turns to Luisa, seated next to her on the bench.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: What did he say?
speaker_heading: LUISA
dialog: He say to give the ball to you.
scene_heading: INT. ARENA - NIGHT
text: The arena is PACKED with a raucous European crowd, chanting
text: and waving signs - the love their women's basketball.
text: Monica walks onto the floor, tucking her jersey into her
text: shorts. The uniforms are old-style - polyester and tight.
text: Her club's name is stitched on the front, "GODELLA".
text: As she hits center court, a smile suddenly breaks through her
text: game face. Standing opposite her, playing for the opposing
dialog: Italian club is Sidra, HER RIVAL FROM USC.
speaker_heading: SIDRA
dialog: Well, what do you know.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: What's up, Sidra.
speaker_heading: SIDRA
dialog: I'm gonna love winning this championship
dialog: in your house.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: How do you say "you're dreaming" in
dialog: Italian?
text: They move into position. The ball is tossed up. Italy winds
text: the tip and the ball is passed to Sidra.
text: Monica hounds her as she brings up the ball. Sidra shoves
text: her off and to the floor, and scores. No whistle. Women's
text: pro ball is at a whole other level. Bigger, better, tougher.
text: The ball is passed in to Monica. She drives down court, goes
text: up for a lay up. An Italian player shoves Monica in mid-air,
text: taking out her legs. Monica crashes on the hardwood.
text: A whistle. Monica lays still for a moment, then pushes
text: herself up and walks to the free-throw line without a word.
dialog: Without emotion.
scene_heading: INT. SPAIN - NIGHTCLUB - LATE NIGHT
text: A huge crowd dances fervently to the live Spanish music. In
text: the middle of the floor, the Spanish players are the life of
dialog: the party.
text: In a corner, Monica sits with Sidra, drinking and watching
text: the festivities. A large trophy sits on the table.
speaker_heading: SIDRA
dialog: Can you take that damn thing off the
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: You mean my championship trophy? My bad.
text: Monica sets it down in the seat next to her, puts an arm
text: around it. Sidra shakes her head.
speaker_heading: SIDRA
dialog: Still a cocky bitch.
text: Monica laughs. She downs her drink, motions to the waiter.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Uno mas, por favor.
text: The waiter nods.
speaker_heading: MONICA (cont'd)
dialog: Last I heard, you were playing in Sweden.
speaker_heading: SIDRA
dialog: Yeah, four years ago. They had me
dialog: staying in this tiny-ass town with like
dialog: fifty people. I'm not playing, there was
text: about a thousand goats running around,
text: and it gets dark at four o'clock. Then
dialog: the whack club I'm on loses three games
dialog: in a row and I get blamed. So they fire
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Just like that?
speaker_heading: SIDRA
dialog: Yup. So I've been playing with this
dialog: Italian club the last three years.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: How's that been?
speaker_heading: SIDRA
dialog: It's better. Even though the whole first
dialog: season my teammates didn't pass to me
dialog: cause they were mad "The American" was
dialog: making more money.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I led the team in rebounds cause it was
dialog: the only way I could touch the damn ball.
text: Monica laughs as the waiter brings her drink. She tries to
text: pay, but he just shakes his head, crosses away.
speaker_heading: SIDRA (cont'd)
dialog: Most of us don't win championships our
dialog: first year overseas.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Please, I went through the same drama as
dialog: everybody else. I mean, the first four
dialog: months, only person I could talk to was
dialog: this chick Luisa, who knew like ten words
dialog: of English from watching old "Dif'rent
dialog: Strokes" reruns. Swear to God, I had to
dialog: tell her if she said, "What you talking
dialog: bout, Willis?" one more time, I was
dialog: gonna kick her ass.
text: Sidra laughs. They watch the madness out on the dance floor.
speaker_heading: SIDRA
dialog: So what are these Spanish guys like?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I wouldn't know.
speaker_heading: SIDRA
dialog: What? You've been over here seven months
dialog: and you ain't tapped anything?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Just not my type, I guess.
speaker_heading: SIDRA
dialog: Shoot, Italian boys love them some black
dialog: women. They can't get enough of me.
text: Monica smiles.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: You ever think about going back?
speaker_heading: SIDRA
dialog: Sometimes. But what's the alternative,
dialog: not playing? You remember big Toni?
dialog: (off Monica's nod)
dialog: She quit last year, now she's working at
dialog: some bookstore. I mean, look at us.
dialog: They treat us like we're Hollywood stars
dialog: over here. We just played in the
dialog: championship game. It doesn't get much
dialog: sweeter than this.
text: Monica takes this in. Her eyes do not reflect someone on top
text: of the world. She takes a long drink.
scene_heading: INT. SPAIN - MONICA'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT
text: A small, sparse, one-bedroom. Sam, Diane and the rest of the

text: Monica sits on the floor, braiding her hair.
text: SHE WEARS BOXERS AND QUINCY'S OLD PRACTICE SHIRT. AFTER FIVE

speaker_heading: STU LANTZ

dialog: ONE.
speaker_heading: STU LANTZ (cont'd) (V.O.)
dialog: It's good to see these guys get a little

speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: Quincy steals the ball, has nothing but open court ahead of
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: CHICK HEARN (cont'd) (V.O.)
dialog: Watch out, folks, it's showtime.
text: Quincy takes off from the hash-mark and throws down a monster
text: jam. He swings high off the rim. Too high. His hand slips
text: and he crashes to the floor. His knee twists at a sickening
dialog: angle.
text: The dwindling crowd gasps as Quincy clutches his left knee,
text: writhing in pain.
scene_heading: INT. DANIEL FREEMAN HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - LATE NIGHT
text: Zeke walks down the corridor, checking room numbers. He is

speaker_heading: ZEKE (cont'd)

speaker_heading: NONA

speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: What's that, not great?
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: The doctor'll be back in a minute.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Nona, please.
speaker_heading: NONA
text: He tore his ACL.

speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Almost didn't recognize you with your
dialog: hair like that. How you been?
speaker_heading: NONA
dialog: Happy. And he won't want to see you.
text: Nona walks over to a MAN standing nearby. He puts an arm

scene_heading: INT. QUINCY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: ZEKE

speaker_heading: ZEKE (cont'd)
dialog: Well, you made SportsCenter.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Came by to check on you.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: After five years.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Don't remember that being my fault.
dialog: Seems like you divorced me same time as
dialog: your mom.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Look, I'm busy.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: I can see that. I know things look
dialog: pretty bleak right now, but you can't get
dialog: down on yourself.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I stopped taking your advice a long time
dialog: ago, or did you forget?
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Quincy. I know you left school early to

speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: And now I'm paying for it, right? That

speaker_heading: ZEKE

speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ZEKE

text: Silence. Then.
speaker_heading: ZEKE (cont'd)
dialog: You're a better ballplayer than I ever
dialog: was. But you got a lot of other things
dialog: going for you. You're smart. I always
dialog: felt...I always knew that you could do
dialog: anything you wanted. You want to be a
dialog: ballplayer, be a ballplayer. Just know
dialog: you ain't like everybody else on that
dialog: court. You ain't like I was. You got
dialog: options. That's all I ever tried to show

speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: You're still trying to tell me what I

speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)

speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I'm sorry.

speaker_heading: QUINCY

speaker_heading: MONICA

dialog: I'm alright. But you can sit.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I'm fine. My dad said you tore your ACL.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: What are the doctors saying?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: A lot of things. All I know is I'll be
dialog: back in six months.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Not for Quincy McCall.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I forgot, "Q-man."
text: An awkward beat.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: So, how's pro-ball, Europe?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: We won the championship.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Still working on being the first girl in
dialog: the NBA?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Well, I tried sneaking in after college,
dialog: but they found breasts during my
dialog: physical.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Funny. I never did.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Kiss my ass.
text: Monica cracks up. Quincy laughs with her.
speaker_heading: MONICA (cont'd)
dialog: I can't believe it's been five years.
text: Quincy nods.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Tried calling you a couple times.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Oh yeah?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Wanted to give you props on making First
dialog: Team All-American. And then when Magic
dialog: retired, I tried calling you again.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: (lying)
dialog: Must have been my cheap-ass answering
dialog: machine. It was always messing up.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Figured it was something like that.
text: They look at each other. The moment is building.
speaker_heading: QUINCY (cont'd)
dialog: So, when do you go back?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Actually, I don't...
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I'm tired of playing overseas. Thinking
dialog: about giving it a rest for awhile.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: (completely thrown)
dialog: A rest?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Yeah. Basketball just, isn't fun
dialog: anymore. You know?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: No.
text: He stares at her. Into her.
speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Quincy!
text: Quincy and Monica turn, as KYRA KESSLER, black, 26 and
text: beautiful, rushes into the room. She wears a flight
text: attendant's uniform. She goes to Quincy, gives him a kiss.
text: Monica reacts.
speaker_heading: KYRA
dialog: I'm so sorry. No one would switch
dialog: flights with me.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: It's okay.
speaker_heading: KYRA
dialog: Why are you up? Get in bed.
text: She takes Quincy's arm, moves him to the bed. Monica
dialog: watches.
speaker_heading: KYRA (cont'd)
dialog: Tell me you're going to be okay.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I'm gonna be okay.
text: Kyra relaxes. Then she glances over at Monica.
speaker_heading: KYRA
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Kyra, this is Monica. She, uh...
speaker_heading: KYRA
dialog: (recognizing)
dialog: Monica. You grew up together, right?
dialog: Quincy's told me about you.
text: Monica smiles awkwardly.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: This is Kyra. My fiance.
text: The shock hits too quick to cover. But Monica tries.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Fiance. Wow. Congratulations.
speaker_heading: KYRA
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I didn't know. Wow. That's great.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Well...I should go.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: It means a lot that you came by.
speaker_heading: KYRA
dialog: Yes, we appreciate that.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your
dialog: knee, and everything.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Thanks.
text: Monica forces one last smile, pulls open the door and leaves.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Monica walks down the hall, shell-shocked.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATE DAY
text: Camille moves between the counter and the stove, whipping up
text: a couple pecan pies. Monica enters.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Need any help?
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: I can manage.
text: Monica nods and moves to the barstool.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE (cont'd)
dialog: Your sister's bringing the baby over.
dialog: You should try to be here.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Yeah. Can't wait to see him
dialog: (she falls silent, then)
dialog: I just saw Quincy.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: How is he?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Engaged.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: To that stewardess?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Yeah, you met her?
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago.
dialog: He could do a lot better if you ask me.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Maybe she is.
text: Camille looks up, studies Monica for a moment.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: I thought you were over him.
text: Monica shrugs.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: So what do I do?
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: Find out where they're registered and
dialog: send them a gift.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: (disgusted)
dialog: Whatever.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: You didn't want my opinion in the first
dialog: place, so why even ask?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I asked but why does it always have to be
dialog: so damn prissy.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: Don't curse.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: There you go.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: What do you want me to tell you, Monica,
dialog: to go beat that girl up? To go have sex
dialog: with him? I'm not going to do that.
dialog: Yes, I believe thinking of other people
dialog: is important and yes I'd rather bake a
dialog: pie than shoot a dumb jump shot. If that
dialog: makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
text: Monica stares at her mother. There's no going back.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: So that's why we can't get along?
dialog: Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump
dialog: shot?
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: You're the one always turning your nose
dialog: up at me.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: No I don't.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: Child, please. Ever since you were
dialog: little you thought you were too good for
dialog: anything I had to say.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I wasn't Lena. I didn't care about nail
dialog: polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray
dialog: of your perfume.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: What was so wrong with wanting to teach
dialog: you the things I knew could help you?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Because you're pushing me to be something
dialog: I'm not.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: So you're angry with me because you're
dialog: standing here with your hair combed and
dialog: wearing perfume?
text: Monica is busted. It takes her a moment to come back.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I'm angry because I want a mother, not
dialog: Martha Stewart.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: Oh, yes. The superstar female athlete
text: whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: That's not it.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that
dialog: because I know.
text: Monica stares at her mother.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I remember when I was eight years old,
dialog: you spent like four hours cooking up this
dialog: fancy meal. All you'd let me and Lena do
dialog: was set the table. And I guess you and
dialog: Dad got your wires crossed or something
text: because he walks in with a couple of
dialog: pizzas. And you didn't say anything.
dialog: You just threw the whole meal into some
text: tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: I don't remember that.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I do. You never stood up for yourself.
dialog: Ever. If I was ashamed, it was because
dialog: of that.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: That's ridiculous.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: What's ridiculous is not being a caterer
dialog: so your husband can feel like a man
text: knowing his woman's home cooking and
text: ironing his drawers.
text: WHAP! Camille's humiliation is immediate and she cuts off
text: Monica with a SLAP. Camille curses herself for losing it.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: Dammitt, Monica!
text: Monica is stunned, hurt.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: Camille stares at her daughter, devastated.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: Is that really all you think of me?
text: Monica can't answer.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE (cont'd)
dialog: When I married your father, all I wanted
dialog: was a nice house with a big kitchen so I
dialog: could start my catering business. And
dialog: then I got pregnant with Lena, and then I
dialog: got pregnant with you. And I put it out
dialog: of my mind because that's what you did.
text: Monica stares at her mother.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE (cont'd)
dialog: But you want to know what day I remember?
dialog: In high school, you getting ready for the
dialog: Spring Dance. I put my pearls around
dialog: your neck, told you you were beautiful
dialog: and you looked like you were going to
dialog: cry. That day I was happy I didn't have
dialog: a catering business to run off to. My
dialog: family had three meals a day, had someone
dialog: to pick up after them, and when my
dialog: daughters went to a dance, I helped them
dialog: get ready. That's what I came to care
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: (softly)
dialog: That's all you cared about. I must have
dialog: played in a thousand games and I can only
dialog: remember you being to two.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: You had your coaches and your father for
dialog: that stuff. It never mattered one way or
dialog: the other if I went to your games.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: It mattered, Mom.
text: Camille looks at her daughter and is struck by the need in
text: her eyes. Monica moves off the barstool and leaves.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - DAY
text: The room looks exactly the same. Trophies, medals, plaques.
text: Basketball posters and her "strong women" wall.
text: Monica sits on her bed, staring up at a photo of her and
text: Quincy, tacked up to her bulletin board, amid other photos of
text: her childhood. THEY ARE EIGHTEEN, PLAYFULLY WRESTLING OVER A
text: BASKETBALL.
text: Monica slowly rises, starts taking her posters down.
scene_heading: INT. REHAB CENTER - DAY
text: Quincy sits on a leg extension machine, with his left leg
text: tucked under the padded bar. A TRAINER stands behind him.
text: Sweat and pain coat Quincy's face and scarred knee as he
text: slowly lifts the light weight again, and again, and again.
scene_heading: INT. BANK - DAY
text: A long line of customers shift impatiently during the noon-
dialog: time rush.
text: Monica sits with a BANK MANAGER at the "New Accounts" desk,
text: learning the ropes. Her hair is done, she wears a simple
text: dress. Behind her, hanging on the wall, are three framed
text: photos of the bank presidents. ONE OF THEM IS HER FATHER,
speaker_heading: NATHAN.
scene_heading: INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Monica stands in her room, staring out at Quincy's window.
text: She watches as Quincy and Kyra pack up some of Quincy's
text: stuff. Quincy tries to take his basketball globe light. She
dialog: laughs, "Hell no."
scene_heading: INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - DAY
text: Camille enters, moves to Monica's garbage can, dumps the
text: contents into her larger bag. Suddenly, she stops. She
text: reaches into the garbage and pulls out a crumpled picture.
text: Camille smooths it. It is the photo of Monica and Quincy at
text: eighteen, wrestling over a basketball.
text: CAMILLE STARES AT IT, TAKEN IN BY THE PURE JOY IN HER
text: DAUGHTER'S FACE. She sits down on Monica's bed, still
dialog: staring.
scene_heading: INT. FORUM - DAY
text: In the empty gym, Quincy jogs up and down the court. He is
text: still tentative on his knee, but he keeps jogging.
text: And then, slowly, the determination melts from his face. His
text: jog turns into a walk, and then he just...stops.
scene_heading: INT. MCCALL HOUSE - QUINCY'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Quincy stands in the middle of his room, taking in his life.
text: Old, worn basketball posters still line the walls. Trophies
text: and awards. USC memorabilia. His basketball globe light.
text: He walks to his window, looks out at Monica's window. Her
text: room is dark.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. QUINCY'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - MORNING
text: Quincy tilts his face up to the shower head and rinses the
text: soap from his face. He hears the bathroom door open. He
text: shuts off the water and opens the curtain.
text: Kyra sits on the toilet, taking a pee. Quincy slams the
dialog: curtain closed.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Damn, girl.
speaker_heading: KYRA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I don't wanna see that.
speaker_heading: KYRA
dialog: Get used to it, babe.
text: She flushes. Quincy steps out, grabs a towel. A long scar
text: runs across his knee cap.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Brother's gonna have to start locking
dialog: doors.
text: Kyra laughs as she buttons up her flight attendant's uniform.
dialog: They cross into:
scene_heading: INT. QUINCY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Kyra packs up a suitcase.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: So how long is this trip?
speaker_heading: KYRA
dialog: Four days.
text: Quincy nods.
speaker_heading: KYRA (cont'd)
dialog: So are you going to be the kind of
dialog: husband who won't let his wife work?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Nah.
speaker_heading: KYRA
dialog: (playfully)
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: You might be the only one with a job.
speaker_heading: KYRA
dialog: Baby, don't talk like that. Your rehab's
dialog: going well. You'll be back before you
dialog: know it.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it.
dialog: Busting my ass, for what?
speaker_heading: KYRA
dialog: To do what you love.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I don't know sometimes.
speaker_heading: KYRA
dialog: You're just scared. I know rehab is
dialog: hard, and you have to worry about whether
dialog: you'll be as good as you were but you
dialog: will be. I believe in you. You just
dialog: have to get back on the court. Like
dialog: you'd get back on a horse.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: A horse?
speaker_heading: KYRA
dialog: Don't make fun of me when I'm being
dialog: wonderful and supportive.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You belong on the court. Just like I
text: belong in the stands, looking cute and
dialog: cheering you on.
text: She smiles, gives him a kiss, moves back to her packing. Off
dialog: Quincy:
scene_heading: INT. BANK - DAY
text: Monica sits at her desk in a blouse and skirt, punching
text: numbers into the computer. A man sits down in the chair
text: opposite her. Monica glances up. It's her father.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Hey, munchkin.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Dad. What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I was upstairs for a meeting. I've been
dialog: hearing good things about you.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: That tends to happen when you're the
dialog: boss's daughter.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: So how's the job going?
text: Monica forces a smile.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: You know.
text: Nathan looks at her, nods.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I think I know what the problem is.
text: He pulls a GARBAGE CAN HOOP from a plastic shopping bag.
text: Monica smiles. He attaches it to her garbage can.
speaker_heading: NATHAN (cont'd)
dialog: There.
text: He shoots an ugly, imaginary shot. She laughs.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: You shoot like a girl.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I'll take that as a compliment.
text: He gives her a smile, and exits. Monica looks at the hoop,
text: then crumples a piece of paper.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: And she gets the steal. Monica goes one-
text: on-one against Jordan, she stops, pops...
text: Monica shoots. The paper drops through the net.
speaker_heading: MONICA (cont'd)
dialog: (still whispering)
dialog: It's good! It's good!
text: She glances up, notices a few patrons watching her. Monica
text: quickly composes herself and goes back to her work.
scene_heading: EXT. WRIGHT AND MCCALL HOUSES - DUSK
text: Monica exits her car, after a long day at work. She wears
text: very low heels. But she still stumbles. She curses, then
text: hears a laugh.
text: She looks up - Quincy sits on the grassy hill above her
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I remember when your mom had to beat you
text: into a dress.
text: Monica smiles.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: You visiting?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Kyra's gone for a couple days. Figured
dialog: I'd keep Mom company.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Who's this guy I always see her around?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Darryl. He's alright, kinda corny.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: So...how's the knee?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Getting there.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Yeah. Two weeks.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I didn't get to send you an invitation,
dialog: but if you...
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: That's okay. I'm probably, you know,
dialog: busy.
text: Quincy nods. Awkward beat.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Can I ask you something?
text: Monica looks at him.
speaker_heading: QUINCY (cont'd)
dialog: You never told me why ball isn't fun
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: It just isn't.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: You had a rough couple years, that's all.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: That a nice way of saying I rode the
dialog: bench?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: And you tore up your knee. Rehab is
dialog: tough.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Nah. I haven't dribbled a ball in four
dialog: and a half months. Maybe I miss some of
dialog: the attention, but besides that...
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: You're serious.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Seems like I needed a ball when I was
dialog: trying to be like my pops...or trying to
dialog: be better than him. Now, I kinda think I
dialog: need to try something else.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Maybe go back to school.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Wow.
text: Monica stares at him, seeing a man in the boy she grew up
text: with. Quincy looks away, self-conscious.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school
dialog: thing yet.
dialog: (then)
dialog: She'll probably say it's the painkillers
dialog: talking.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: It's a trip, you know? When you're a
dialog: kid, you see the life you want, and it
dialog: never crosses your mind that it's not
dialog: gonna turn out that way.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: So why'd you give up ball?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Why do you keep asking me that?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Cause I don't get it.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Something was just missing.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: What?
text: Monica is too hurt, too scared to tell him the truth.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: It doesn't matter, alright. Just leave
dialog: it alone.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Find.
text: Monica turns, crosses to her house. She stumbles on her
text: heels, kicks them off in frustration, and exits inside.
text: Quincy walks back to his curb.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: Camille watches from the kitchen window
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WRIGHT HOUSE - PATIO - DUSK
text: Lena sits next to Camille. Her one year old son, L.P., sits
text: on the ground at her feet. Monica sits quietly nearby,
dialog: watching.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: So you're still breast-feeding?
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: The doctor said it was okay. Anyway, I'm
dialog: still trying to lose some of this baby
dialog: fat.
text: She quickly looks over at Monica.
speaker_heading: LENA (cont'd)
dialog: Shut up.
text: Monica gives her a small smile. Camille looks down at L.P.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: You might want to put a jacket on him,
text: it's getting cold.
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: He's fine.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: (warning)
dialog: Okay.
text: Lena sighs, rolls her eyes. She picks up her son.
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: Come on, L.P. Grandma says it's too
dialog: cold.
text: She exits inside. Camille makes a face.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: God. "Grandma."
text: Monica smiles. And then silence. There is still so much
text: distance between them, so many misunderstanding. Camille
text: stares at her daughter. And then...
speaker_heading: CAMILLE (cont'd)
dialog: You know, I'd probably be a lot more
dialog: "prissy" in the situation than you'd
dialog: like, but the thing I always admired that
dialog: drove me crazy, was the fight you had in
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: When I said Quincy could do better, I was
dialog: thinking about you.
text: Monica stares at her mom. Camille stands and leaves.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Monica lies in her bed, staring up at the ceiling, unable to
text: sleep. Her mind races with thoughts of her past, her
dialog: choices, her future...
text: Suddenly, she climbs out of bed. She wears a tank-top and
text: pajama bottoms. She crosses to her window, pulls it open and
text: climbs out.
scene_heading: EXT. WRIGHT AND MCCALL HOUSES - CONTINUOUS
text: Monica drops down. She moves to Quincy's window and knocks
text: quietly. Beat, then Quincy appears. Bare-chested and in a
text: pair of shorts. He looks at her, then pulls open the window.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: (half-asleep)
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: We need to talk.
text: Quincy just looks at her.
speaker_heading: MONICA (cont'd)
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Hold on.
text: Quincy disappears for a moment, then returns, pulling on a T-
text: shirt. He climbs out of his window, drops to the ground.
text: Quincy looks at her.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: You asked me what was missing.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: From basketball.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: you woke me up to tell me that?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: It's not fun for me anymore because
dialog: you're missing.
text: Quincy stares at her.
speaker_heading: MONICA (cont'd)
dialog: What I'm trying to say is --
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: I heard enough.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you
dialog: since I was eleven and the shit won't go
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: We haven't talked since college and now
dialog: you wait two weeks before my wedding to
dialog: say something like this?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I know, I probably should have said it
dialog: two weeks ago.
text: Quincy doesn't even crack a smile. In fact, he glares.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: You haven't changed. You still think the
dialog: sun rises and sets on your ass. Well,
dialog: guess what, it doesn't.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Then why are you so upset?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Because you don't pull this on someone
text: who's about to get married.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Better late than never, right?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Wrong.
text: Quincy starts back toward the window.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I'll play you.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MONICA
text: One game. One-on-one.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Your heart.
text: Quincy looks at her in disbelief, then laughs at the
dialog: absurdity.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: You're out of your mind.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: So you're gonna bitch up?
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: What's that supposed to be, psychology?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I know why you broke up with me in
dialog: college. And not that what you did
dialog: wasn't messed up, but what I did was,
dialog: too. So if you forgive me, I'll forgive
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I
dialog: couldn't trust anybody, okay. I mean, I
dialog: was lost. So you are forgiven. But that
dialog: was five years ago. I moved on.
text: Monica moves past him, reaches through his window. She drops
text: back down, holding his basketball.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Prove it.
text: She throws him the ball.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: What will this prove?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: You once said the reason I beat you was
dialog: because you wanted me to.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: So, if I win it's because deep down you
dialog: know you're about to make the biggest
dialog: mistake of your life, and deep down your
dialog: want me to stop you.
speaker_heading: QUINCY
dialog: And what happens when you lose?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding
dialog: present.
text: Quincy stares at her.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MCCALL HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - SHORT TIME LATER
text: Monica stands opposite Quincy. Both are suited up in
text: basketball gear.
text: They stare at each other, ready to go to war. Monica tosses

dialog: guards him...

text: the top of the key.

text: He breaks for the basket. Monica stays with him. He goes
text: up. Monica jumps, desperately tries to block his shot.
text: Quincy dunks on her, knocking her to the ground. He lets go
text: of the rim, and tumbles to the ground also. GAME OVER.
text: Silence. Quincy stares at her. Monica looks back. Then:

dialog: Hey.
text: Monica slowly stops, turns.
speaker_heading: QUINCY (cont'd)
dialog: Double or nothing.
