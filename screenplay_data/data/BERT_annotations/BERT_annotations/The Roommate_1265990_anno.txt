scene_heading: INT. COLLEGE DORM ROOM - DAY
text: Sunlight pours through the window of an empty, silent dorm
text: room. The room seems alive, somehow. As if it's waiting
dialog: patiently for this year's kids.
text: A long beat. The room darkens for an instant. Just the sun,
text: right, dipping behind a cloud? Maybe.
scene_heading: INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY
text: OVER CREDITS, we PAN DOWN a hallway full of COLLEGE KIDS.
text: They carry boxes, stereo speakers, stand around chatting.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY
text: SARA MATTHEWS, 18, gets out of a taxi in front of a dorm.
text: She's pretty, with optimistic eyes and brown hair cut just
text: above her shoulders. She's dressed casually, but still chic.
dialog: No parents.
text: She carries a backpack on one shoulder, a duffle bag on the
text: other, and a huge suitcase in her hand. And she's staring
text: through the building's window at...
text: Newly-minted COLLEGE STUDENTS milling about inside. Their
text: parents in tow, pride and sadness mingled in their faces.
scene_heading: INT. DORM LOBBY - DAY
text: Sara walks to the registration table. A RESIDENT ASSISTANT
text: smiles up at her.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Hi. Sara Matthews.
text: She looks her up in the computer. She plays with a simple
text: silver chain around her neck.
dialog: R.A.
dialog: Des Moines, Iowa. Wow. Flyover
dialog: country.
text: She says it nicely, but it still stings. Sara smiles gamely.
dialog: R.A.
dialog: You're in room three-sixteen.
dialog: Welcome.
text: She hands Sara a room key. She fingers it, smiling.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
scene_heading: INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY
text: ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN ON Sara as she...
text: Pushes an ancient, flat-bed cart out of the elevator and down
text: the hall, struggling to control its wobbly wheels. She bumps
text: into other carts, but everyone just laughs it off.
text: Sara stops in front of Room 316.
scene_heading: INT. DORM DOORWAY - DAY
text: She opens the door and looks in on:
text: A run-of-the-mill freshman dorm room. Tiny; bathroom down the
dialog: hall; twin beds. Heaven.
text: Sara steps in. She looks at the two empty beds. Big choice
text: here. She drops her stuff on the bed by the window.
text: She sits down on it. A beat. I'm really here.
text: First things first -- Sara takes a framed picture out of her
text: duffle bag and sets it on the dresser. It's a picture of a
text: YOUNG GIRL, maybe ten. She looks a little like Sara.
text: Sara hauls a white, Styrofoam DESIGN MANNEQUIN off the cart.
text: It's full of pin and chalk marks. She sets it by her bed.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Told you we'd make it.
text: She steps back to the doorway. As she hauls her suitcase off
text: the cart... BOOM! Another cart slams into hers. A box tumbles
text: off the other cart.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Sorry! Bad driver.
text: Sara kneels to help the other girl -- cute, frizzy hair --
text: clean up the mess. A slew of clothes lie on the carpet. And
text: peeking out from under them... a bottle of vodka. The girl
text: smiles sheepishly.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: In case of emergency.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I'm Tracy.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Sara.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
text: Balancing boxes, they manage to shake hands.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPUS QUAD - DAY
text: A gorgeous fall day. Sara strolls across the quad, taking it
text: all in. Kids tossing frisbees... hacky-sacking... sunning on
text: the grass. Music pours out of speakers mounted in dorm
dialog: windows.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - DAY
text: Sara's cell phone buzzes. She answers it.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Hey. Yeah, it's amazing here. I met
dialog: this really cool biker? He's taking
dialog: me to Mexico this weekend.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Hi, Mom. Just tell him I'm kidding.
text: Sara stops in front of the campus coffee shop. She eyes a
text: work/study ad on the wall.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Everything's great.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: No, she's not here yet so I got to
dialog: choose my side of the room.
text: She tears a tab off the flyer.
scene_heading: EXT. COLLEGE DORM - NIGHT
text: Establishing shot of Carnegie, a solid red-brick dorm.
scene_heading: INT. SARA'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Sara's half-settled in now. The wall beside her bed is
text: peppered with fashion pages ripped out of Vogue and In Style.
text: She sits in a lounge chair, paging through a Vanity Fair
text: photo shoot. She spots a cool outfit and tears out the page.
text: A KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Sara walks over. She opens it
dialog: expectantly to see...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
text: Tracy, Tracy's roommate KIM, and two other HALLMATES. All
text: dressed to party.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Psi U.'s throwing a bash. Let's go.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Psi U.?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: They're a frat. Beer... guys...
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I don't know... I might just hang
dialog: and wait for my roommate.
text: Groans all around. "Come on"... "Lame-O"... Sara bites her
text: lip, considering. She smiles.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Alright. Just let me change.
text: The girls cheer.
scene_heading: EXT. PSI U. FRATERNITY HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Establishing shot of a proud frat house. Students piled on a
text: giant porch and there's a long line going up the steps to the
text: front door. Music blasts out of the windows.
scene_heading: INT. PSI U. FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Sara, Tracy, Kim and the others from the floor are at the
text: head of the line, stepping into the house. They're met by a
scene_heading: FRAT BOUNCER.
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: (motions to a crowded keg)
dialog: If you want beer, I'll need ID's.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: For a frat party?! Seriously?
text: He holds up a handful of ugly lime-green wristbands. Kim
text: steps around him.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: I don't drink anyway.
text: Tracy looks at her, mouth agape.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: There's punch and non-alcoholic
dialog: beer over there...
text: He points to a table with a giant bowl and cups. No one is
dialog: around it.
text: Tracy tries to flirt with the bouncer.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Come on, just us. We won't tell.
text: The bouncer is tempted but not budging.
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: Honestly, I'm just a pledge.
dialog: They'll kick me out.
text: She stomps by him.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Wuss.
text: Defeated, Tracy walks over to the table. Turns back to Sara.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: You want something to drink?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: What's the point?
text: Tracy huffs as Sara walks into A SEA OF KIDS. We're talking
dialog: extreme fire hazard... extreme moral hazard.
text: Sara moves through the crowd. Her clothes are low-wattage,
text: but stylish. She's drawn to the music coming from a large
dialog: room.
text: A HIGH-ENERGY COLLEGE BAND on stage. They're not very good,
text: but they don't care. Sara finds a spot along the wall and
dialog: watches them. In particular --
text: THE DRUMMER. A cute goof, spastically whaling away. He's
text: mouthing the lyrics, eyes closed. Really into it. Sara
text: chuckles at the sight, not taking her eyes off him. He
dialog: definitely stands out.
text: Suddenly, a hand grabs her shoulder. Tracy pulls herself in
text: with Kim close behind and they start dancing to the band.
text: Juice spilling over the brim of her cup. Sara stays by the
text: wall, afraid of getting any spilled on her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (yells over the music)
dialog: Why aren't you dancing?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: To this?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: They're not that bad.
text: Tracy pulls Sara deeper in the crowd. Now all three start
text: jumping up and down to the music. Sara's getting into it as
text: Tracy chugs her drink.
scene_heading: INT. FRAT HOUSE - DANCE FLOOR - LATER
text: A DJ rules the room now. Sara and Kim are dancing with
text: others from the floor. Sara notices a speck of punch on her
text: shirt. She stops dancing. Wets her fingers and tries to rub
dialog: it out.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Crap.
text: Kim still dances as Sara starts to look around.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Where's Tracy?
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: She was getting more punch.
text: Sara then spots Tracy, with a full cup, precariously climbing
text: onto the stage next to the DJ's table with a bunch of other
text: girls already dancing. She starts dancing suggestively,
text: egging on the crowd.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Uh oh.
text: Guys yell out. "Show em." Several hands armed with camera
text: phones stretch out above the crowd.
speaker_heading: SARA
speaker_heading: (SHOUTS)
dialog: Tracy.
text: Tracy can't hear her. Sara starts making her way to the
text: stage. Tracy is dancing, getting into it. She grabs the
text: bottom of her shirt. Teases the crowd.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: SARA
speaker_heading: (LOUDER)
dialog: Tracy. Don't.
text: Sara slams into STEPHEN, 21, the DRUMMER from the band... who
text: inadvertently dumps his whole beer down her shirt. Sara
text: gasps.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Damn!
text: Sara's drenched as an enormous cheer erupts from the crowd.
text: Camera phones clicking all at once. Sara looks up.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Oh. Woops.
speaker_heading: SARA
speaker_heading: (ANNOYED)
dialog: I have to go clean this up.
text: She turns.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Looks like my plan backfired.
text: Sara turns back towards him.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: What plan?
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: To spill beer on you so I can start
text: a conversation.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: You spilled beer on me purposely?
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
speaker_heading: (NODS)
dialog: You pissed?
text: She looks at him. Pretty good looking. Goofy smile. It's
text: hard to be mad at him. She then grabs a beer out of a
text: dancing partier's hand and dumps it on Stephen.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I'll get over it.
text: He laughs, making her smile.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: SARA
text: I'm not sure how she's so wasted.
dialog: All she's had is punch.
text: Stephen grins conspiratorially and grabs her hand.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Come on.
scene_heading: INT. FRAT HOUSE - BAR
text: Stephen, now with a full beer watches as Sara sips some of
dialog: the punch.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: It's pretty good.
text: She drinks some more.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: It doesn't taste that strong.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Exactly.
text: He takes a drink of his beer as Sara takes a long chug of
dialog: hers.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Stephen. By the way.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Sara.
scene_heading: INT. FRAT HOUSE - DANCE FLOOR: SOME TIME LATER
text: Stephen and Sara are dancing. She's holding her cup.
text: Drinking, bumping into a couple of people. Stephen laughs,
text: grabs her hand, pulling her back towards him and TWIRLS her,
text: bringing her close. She notices, for the first time, that
text: he's not wearing a wristband and grabs his wrist with her
dialog: other hand.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Hey, why do you get to drink beer?
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Twenty-one.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Old man.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Tell me about it. My back is
dialog: killing me.
text: They don't move for a moment, Sara's resting her back against
text: his chest.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Besides, frat brothers don't have
dialog: to wear those ugly wristbands.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Ugh. You're in this frat?
text: He jokingly untwirls her away and she bumps into people
text: behind her. Sara laughs as she notices Kim, dancing,
text: Holding up a cup of punch.
speaker_heading: KIM
speaker_heading: (SLURS)
dialog: Did you try the punch? It's pretty
dialog: good.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: What happened to Tracy?
text: Kim shrugs.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: I'm the worst roommate ever.
text: Kim goes back to dancing Sara looks a little worried which
text: Stephen notices.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Do you want to look for your
dialog: friend?
text: Sara looks at him sweetly. Nods.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRCASE
text: They spot Tracy propped up against the railing at the bottom
text: of the stairs. Sara rushes over to her. A couple frat boys
text: stand over her. Not sure what to do with her.
speaker_heading: SARA
speaker_heading: (BUTTS IN)
dialog: I got her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
text: She struggles to hold Tracy up -- the girl's heavier than she
text: looks and Sara's balance is not so great, herself. The frat
text: boys notice her struggling.
speaker_heading: FRAT BOY #1
dialog: Who's got you?
text: Tracy nearly brings Sara down to the floor...
text: But Stephen's there to catch her.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Guess that would be me.
text: But then he stumbles, nearly dropping them both.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Who's got you?
text: Stephen looks at Tracy in one arm. The other arm around
text: Sara's waist.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
speaker_heading: (SMIRKS)
dialog: Apparently God.
text: Sara rolls her eyes.
scene_heading: INT. CARNEGIE DORM - NIGHT
text: Sara, Stephen, and Tracy stumble into the dorm lobby. Sara
text: wears a jacket Stephen gave her for the walk. Kim and
text: ANOTHER GIRL step forward and grab Tracy.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Thanks Sara.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: No problem.
text: They linger, smiling, checking out Stephen... They step into
text: the elevator. Holding it for Sara.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: You want us to wait?
text: Sara turns and glares at Kim. An obvious "NO!" Kim lets the
text: doors close as Sara turns back to Stephen.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: You know, I'm going to be pulling
dialog: kitchen duty all week for helping
text: girls leave a frat party. It's
dialog: like opposite everything we stand
dialog: for.
text: Sara leans in and gives him a long kiss. Then separates, but
text: her lips still very close to his.
speaker_heading: SAEA
dialog: (low and romantic)
dialog: Does that make it worth it?
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Honestly, no.
text: She laughs out loud.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Do you want to come up?
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
speaker_heading: (DEEP BREATH)
dialog: More than I can tell you, but that
dialog: wouldn't be fair.
text: Sara starts to take off Stephen's jacket. He stops her.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Keep it... till next time.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Thanks again. For everything.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: And, sorry about kitchen duty.
text: He smiles... and walks away into the night. Sara looks after
text: him... and now it's her turn to take a deep breath which
text: suddenly makes her a little more queasy.
scene_heading: INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Sara heads for her room, holding onto the wall as she goes.
text: She reaches her door. She takes one more deep breath, then
text: opens it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 316 - NIGHT
text: Sara closes the door behind her. Almost pitch black; just a
text: little moonlight through the window. Sara knocks into her
text: lounge chair.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Ow!
text: She reaches her bed and plops down on her back. Breathing
text: hard. Clenching her eyes shut. The room is spinning. She may
dialog: puke at any second.
text: She struggles to sit up. She fumbles for the lamp next to her
text: bed, almost knocking it over. She hits the switch, revealing:
text: The other bed.
text: Sara screams.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Hi.
text: FLASH. The girl takes her picture, further blinding and
text: disorienting Sara.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Who are you?!
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Rebecca. Your roommate.
text: Sara calms, catching on.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Taking your picture.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Why?
text: Rebecca shrugs. Sara grabs her stomach.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Oh shit.
text: Her cheeks chipmunk as she rushes out the door. Rebecca
text: smiles.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
scene_heading: INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT: LATER
text: Sara gingerly walks out of the bathroom back to her room,
text: holding her head. The door is slightly open.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT
text: It's dark. Rebecca's covers are pulled up to her neck. Her
text: eyes are closed.
speaker_heading: SARA
speaker_heading: (WHISPERS)
dialog: Rebecca?
text: No answer. Sara makes it back to her bed. She falls onto it,
text: and turns toward the wall.
text: Rebecca's eyes open. And they stay open. She watches Sara go
dialog: to sleep.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPUS QUAD - DAY
text: It's the middle of the day and students carry their books
dialog: everywhere.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - DAY
text: Sara wakes. Headache; dry mouth; the works. The sun through
text: the window is way too bright. She slowly turns over to see...
text: Rebecca, up and about, arranging her side of the room. In the
text: light of day, we see that she's a knockout.
text: Mellow music plays through top-of-the line speakers that
text: flank an awesome stereo system.
text: Rebecca sees that Sara's awake.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Hey Sara.
text: Sara stares at her blankly. Who is this girl? What happened
dialog: last night? Rebecca smiles.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: We met last night.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Right...
dialog: (racking her brain)
dialog: Starts with a... "T"?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
text: Close. Rebecca.
text: She hands Sara a glass of water and two aspirin.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Come on. It'll help, trust me.
text: Sara washes down the aspirin.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Thanks.
text: Rebecca smiles, genuinely touched.
speaker_heading: SARA
speaker_heading: (SUDDENLY PANICKED)
dialog: I didn't throw up on you, did I?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
speaker_heading: (LAUGHS)
dialog: No. You made it to the bathroom.
text: Sara looks around the room. Her lounge chair has been moved
text: to her side.
text: Rebecca starts to tape drawings to the wall.. .They're various
text: self-portraits of Rebecca. Sara looks at one where Rebecca
text: is staring straight back at us. No smile.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Did you do those?
text: Rebecca nods.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: They're really cool.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I just like capturing my moods.
text: A beat. Sara closes her eyes. Bits and pieces of the night
text: before are coming back to her now.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Rebecca -- did you take my picture
dialog: last night?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: Yeah. It's just something I do. For
dialog: my drawings.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: C'mon, let's hit the bookstore. The
dialog: walk will help your head.
text: Sara rolls over, groaning.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: It's too damn early for me.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
text: It's three in the afternoon.
text: Sara's eyes bug out.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Holy shit!
scene_heading: INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY
text: Sara walks along the back aisle, weighed down with textbooks.
text: All look used and worn. Fashion Design. Psychology. Calculus.
text: She spots the last book she needs and reaches for it just as
text: another GIRL reaches too. They both pull back, neither sure
dialog: who has claim to it.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: So what do we do?
text: Sara looks her over. Checks out her outfit.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Nice bag. Dior?
speaker_heading: GIRL
speaker_heading: (FLATTERED)
dialog: Yeah.
text: Sara snatches the book.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I'm on financial aid.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 16.
scene_heading: INT. BOOKSTORE - LATER
text: Sara finds Rebecca by the art supplies, she's picking up the
text: stuff she needs. Sara scans Rebecca's books. They're all
text: art books, shiny and new.
text: Sara's phone rings. She looks at it: "JASON".
text: She sighs. Her finger hovers over the "talk" button. A beat.
text: She hits it right before it goes to voicemail.
speaker_heading: SARA
speaker_heading: (ANNOYED)
dialog: Jason. What are you doing?
speaker_heading: JASON (O.S.)
dialog: I just wanted to hear your voice.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I told you not to do this.
speaker_heading: JASON (O.S.)
dialog: I need to talk to you.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: You're just making it harder.
speaker_heading: JASON (O.S.)
dialog: Sara, listen I... I want to come
dialog: out there.
speaker_heading: SARA
speaker_heading: (SNAPS)
dialog: But you didn't come out here,
dialog: remember. That's the problem.
text: She says it too loud. Other students in line are eyeing her.
speaker_heading: SARA (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (QUIETER)
dialog: I've gotta go.
text: Sara hangs up. She exhales, flustered.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: That didn't sound good. Boyfriend?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Ex.
text: Off Rebecca's confused look.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: It's complicated.
text: A beat. Rebecca's warm smile makes Sara want to open up.
text: They walk along the stacks of books.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: We dated since tenth grade and were
dialog: supposed to go to college together.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: We both applied to Brown. I got in;
dialog: he got wait-listed. I stuck to our
dialog: agreement and we both committed
dialog: here. Then two weeks ago...a spot
dialog: opened up at Brown ...and..
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: No?! He took it?
text: (Sara nods glumly)
dialog: What an asshole.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Do you miss him?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Sometimes I think I do.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: It's hard to let go.
speaker_heading: (SMILES)
dialog: Believe me, I know. But, you're in
dialog: college now. A girl's gotta move
dialog: on.
text: Sara smiles, glad to find a kindred spirit. She looks at her
text: phone... and stuffs it into her pocket as they reach the
dialog: register.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT
text: Rebecca sits on her bed, drawing. Sara is putting her books
text: away on a shelf. As she reaches the end of it, she notices
text: something out of the corner of her eye.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Oh my God.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 18.
text: Sara walks to the closet. Her modest clothes hang on one
text: side. But the other side is now taken up by Rebecca's KILLER
scene_heading: COLLECTION.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I am so jealous.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I know... I've got a lot of clothes.
dialog: Mind if I put some on your side?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: No problem.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Borrow anything you want. Really. I
dialog: haven't worn half of them.
text: Sara reverently fingers through them. Chloe. De La Renta.
text: Alexander McQueen. Jimmy Choo shoes. A Miu Miu handbag. Some
dialog: still carry their price tags.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Jesus, some of these I've only ever
dialog: seen in Vogue.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: My parents idea of bonding is to
dialog: turn me loose in Beverly Hills with
dialog: a Platinum card.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Oh, you here?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Pasadena.
text: Off Sara's confused look.
speaker_heading: REBECCA (CONT'D)
text: About 20 minutes away.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: That's cool. You can go home on
dialog: weekends. Free laundry. Free meals.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Not gonna happen.
text: Sara gives her a puzzled stare.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: It's a long story.. .Let's just say
dialog: nothing's free in my house.
text: She wants to know more... but it's too soon to pry. She nods
text: at Rebecca's drawing pad.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Can I take a look?
text: She walks over. Rebecca clutches the pad to her chest.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: No.
text: Sara stops dead in her tracks. Rebecca realizes that came
dialog: across pretty harsh.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Not till it's done. Nothing
dialog: personal. It's just my... process.
speaker_heading: (SMILES)
dialog: I wouldn't want to show you
dialog: anything unless it was perfect.
speaker_heading: SARA
speaker_heading: (SMILES BACK)
dialog: Sure.
scene_heading: EXT. CAFETERIA - DUSK
text: Establishing shot of a big college cafeteria.
scene_heading: INT. CAFETERIA - DUSK
text: Sara and Rebecca have just finished their dinner.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I thought you were a design major.
dialog: Why are you taking Calc and
dialog: psychology?
text: The girls get up with their trays.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: (with a smirk)
dialog: I am. I want to be well-rounded.

speaker_heading: TRACY (O.S.)
dialog: Hey Sara.
text: Sara sees Tracy sitting by the window with Kim. Sara walks
text: over, but Rebecca doesn't follow.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Hey. Tracy... Kim... this is my
dialog: roommate, Rebecca.
text: She turns, but Rebecca is standing at a distance. Sara waves
text: her over.
text: Rebecca comes, reluctantly. She flashes a small wave.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: RRRRRREBECCA. How formal. What can
dialog: we call you?
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: How 'bout Reba?
text: Tracy sticks her finger down her throat. Gag me.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I like Becca.
text: Tracy's grimace vetoes that one, too.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: How 'bout Becky?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Becky's good.
text: The girls all turn to Rebecca for approval.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I like Rebecca.
dialog: Buzzkill.
speaker_heading: TRACY
speaker_heading: OOOKAAAY.
text: Rebecca walks out. Sara shrugs at Tracy and Kim.

scene_heading: EXT. DESIGN BUILDING - DAY
text: Sara enters the Design building.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
text: Sara peeks in the open door of a classroom. Frustration in
text: her eyes -- the class she couldn't get into.
text: She watches PROFESSOR ROBERTS -- long-haired, dashing --
text: lecture his students.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: So... here we are. Design 101. And
dialog: each one of you is asking yourself
dialog: the same question...
text: (he taps his own chest)
dialog: Who is this guy? Why should I turn
dialog: off my Blackberry and pay attention
dialog: to him?
text: Mild laughter from the class.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: I'll tell you why -- because I hold
dialog: the keys to the kingdom. Think of
dialog: your favorite designers. Marc
dialog: Jacobs. Vera Wang. Rick Owens.
dialog: Magicians, right? I've got news for
dialog: you: All of their magic stems from
dialog: the same source: the fundamental
dialog: principles of design.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I can teach you those principles.
text: He lets the power of his words sink in.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
text: The journey to the catwalks of New
dialog: York... Paris... Tokyo... starts
dialog: right here, in this room. And all
dialog: you have to do is open your minds.
dialog: Man, she wants in.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

scene_heading: INT. SAME HALLWAY - LATER
text: Sara stands by the door, watching the students file out. As
text: the last one leaves, she screws up her courage and walks in.
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
text: Professor Roberts is gathering up his papers.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Professor Roberts?
text: He flashes a disarming smile.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I'm sorry to bother you, it's
dialog: just...
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I absolutely must take this class.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: I'm afraid we're full. But don't
dialog: worry -- Intro Design has three
dialog: other sections.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: But you're not teaching them. I
dialog: want to learn from the best.
text: He smiles at her.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Sara Matthews.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I brought a request form.
text: She holds it out to him. He takes the form, but his eyes stay
text: on Sara. Roaming over her.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: Tell me, Sara -- why should I sign
dialog: your request form when I've turned
dialog: down a dozen others? Would that be
dialog: fair?
text: Sara's face falls. A long beat.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: No, I guess it wouldn't. Thanks
dialog: anyway.
text: She walks toward the door. Roberts' eyes go to her ass.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: But...
speaker_heading: (SHE TURNS)
dialog: Who said life was fair? You happen
dialog: to have two things I can't teach...
text: He walks to her... and hands her the signed form.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: Style. And Desire.
text: He smiles, signs the form and hands it to Sara. Sara clutches
text: the form to her chest, smiling.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - DAY
text: Sara and Rebecca sit on their respective beds. Rebecca
text: listens to her Walkman. Sara types on her laptop.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Hey.
text: Rebecca removes her earbud.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: What's your Facebook page? I'll add
dialog: you as a friend.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I don't have a Facebook page.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Myspace?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Nope. I don't spend a lot of time
speaker_heading: ON-LINE
text: Sara stares at Rebecca. No way.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Come here.
text: Rebecca walks over and looks at the computer over Sara's
dialog: shoulder.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 24.
text: ON COMPUTER SCREEN: Sara's Facebook Page. Her picture in the
text: corner. Pictures and posts from a dozen friends.
text: Among them: A STYLISH, ATTRACTIVE WOMAN in her 20s.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Who's she?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Irene. She graduated from the Art
dialog: Institute out here last year.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
speaker_heading: (INTRIGUED)
dialog: She's an artist?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: A design apprentice for Marc
dialog: Jacobs. Hey, check out these
dialog: posts.
text: Sara scrolls down Irene's recent posts: "Paris was
dialog: amazing"... "Milan in the Fall"... "Off to Barcelona"... etc.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I mean.. .who doesn't have a
dialog: Facebook page?!
text: Rebecca laughs.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Okay, okay. I'll get one.
text: Tracy knocks on the partially open front door... and marches
dialog: right in.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Cancel those library plans. Guess
dialog: who made the guest list at Rebar?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: You guys in? I trust you have fake
dialog: IDs?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I don't.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Yes you do. Thanks to my badass
dialog: self.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 25.
text: Tracy pulls out a fake ID. She walks to Rebecca and holds it
text: out to her. A peace offering.
text: Rebecca stares at Tracy for a beat... then goes back to her
dialog: sketchbook.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I'll pass. Clubs really aren't my
dialog: scene.
text: Tracy stands there, hung out to dry, the ID in her hand.
scene_heading: INT. CLUB - NIGHT
text: A posh Los Angeles bar. Loud and packed to the gills with
text: mostly young students. Sara and Tracy stand at the bar,
text: getting jostled, looking like... two naive college kids.
text: As they try to get the bartender's attention, older guys
text: check them out, smiling and mouthing "Hi." Sara tries to
text: ignore them, but Tracy's in heaven.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: How great is this? No parents. No
dialog: curfews.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: No shit!
text: They clink their empty glasses in a toast.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Can I?
text: She puts her wallet and cell phone into Tracy's purse.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Too bad Rebecca blew us off. Talk
dialog: about the life of the party.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Don't be mean.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I'm just saying.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: She's just a little hard to get to
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Yeah right...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 26.
text: As Tracy rolls her eyes...
text: The BARTENDER sets two drinks down in front of them. He nods
text: down the bar at...
text: TWO MIDDLE-AGED SUITS. Tracy flashes them a smile. Sara's not
dialog: so sure about this.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I think...
text: Tracy raises her shot glass. She and Sara clink and drink.
text: Tracy waves at the suits again. Thanks guys.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: We can do better.
text: She takes Sara's hand and pulls her out onto the dance floor.
scene_heading: INT. CLUB - DANCE FLOOR - LATER
text: Sara and Tracy whirl in the hot mix of bodies. Having the
text: time of their lives. A HANDSOME GUY moves in, his eyes on
dialog: Tracy.
text: Tracy loves it. They dance together as Sara watches, smiling.
text: Tracy and the handsome guy drift further away from Sara.
text: Sara is now dancing by herself. A GUY moves in on her, but
text: she politely dances away. She scans the dance floor for
dialog: Tracy. Where'd she go?
text: She steps off the dance floor and scans the bar -- no sign of
dialog: her.
scene_heading: INT. CLUB - BATHROOM
text: Sara walks into the crowded ladies' room.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Tracy?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 27.
scene_heading: EXT. CLUB - NIGHT
text: A bummed Sara walks out of the club alone. She rubs her arms
text: against the chill. She nervously tugs on her silver chain as
text: she scans the STRAGGLERS loitering outside.
speaker_heading: SARA
speaker_heading: (LOUD)
dialog: Tracy.
text: She takes one last peek into the club doorway, hoping against
text: hope that Tracy will magically appear. No luck.
text: She starts walking down the street, away from the club.
text: Weary and unnerved.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT
text: Rebecca lies in bed, wide awake in the dark. Her cell phone
text: rings. She stares at it. Two more rings. She picks it up.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (O.S.)
dialog: Would you accept a collect call
dialog: from... Sara Matthews?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Yes.
text: She smiles.
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT
text: An old school gas station on a barren corner of the city. No
text: cars in either direction. A lone white 328i BMW with a black
text: soft top sits next to an ancient pump.
text: Rebecca, half asleep, climbs out and grabs the nozzle,
text: sticking it in the fuel tank. Starts pumping.
speaker_heading: MAN (0.S.)
dialog: Can I help you out?
text: She turns to see a 20-year-old, good-looking gas station
text: attendant. His name tag: "Rick".
text: Rebecca sizes him up.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I'm fine. Just in a hurry.
text: She keeps pumping. Speeding it up. Rick ambles up to her,
text: treading beyond appropriate personal space. He points to the
dialog: "Full Service" sign.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Just doing my job.
text: She stands her ground as he places his hand over hers on the
text: gas pump and squeezes. She looks down at his hand on top of
text: hers. Then lets go of the pump, nudging his hand away.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: All done.
text: She pulls the nozzle out of the tank and tries to place it
text: back at the pump. He stops her. Motions to her face.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: You have a little something.
dialog: No, she doesn't.
text: He, ever so gently, rubs his index finger and thumb on her
text: cheek to remove the imaginary smudge until he lurches back.
speaker_heading: RICK (CONT'D)
dialog: The hell?
text: His crotch is wet as gasoline drips from the nozzle.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Sorry.
text: But she does it again, holding the lever down, dousing him
text: head to toe. He scrambles backward out of range.
speaker_heading: REBECCA (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry again. Rick.
text: The nozzle's still in her hand, pouring gas in every
text: direction. She opens her car door, grabbing a lighter.
text: Rick's pissed. Charges towards her.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: You spoiled c---
text: He spots the lighter in her hand. Dead stop. She
text: absentmindedly flicks it. It sparks but doesn't light.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 29.
text: The gas is now pouring towards him. The meter on the pump is
text: still ticking up.
text: He scrambles again as she casually flips the lighter at him
text: and drops the still pouring nozzle.
text: A hint of a grin and a pitying shake of her head as she pulls
text: out a loose hundred dollar bill. Places it on top of the
dialog: pump.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Pussy.
text: She gets into her car and drives off. Leaving Rick soaked in
dialog: gasoline.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. DINER - NIGHT
text: Sara sits by herself in a booth by the window. Hugging a cup
text: of hot, sobering coffee.
text: Rebecca's car pulls up into a parking spot. The headlights
text: shine right in Sara's eyes... and now turn off.
text: Sara's tired eyes light up as she sees Rebecca get out of the
text: car. She waves. Rebecca doesn't wave back as she heads for
text: the door.
scene_heading: INT. DINER - NIGHT
text: Rebecca walks up to Sara's booth.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Nice car.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: So, where's Tracy?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: No idea, I couldn't find her.
text: Rebecca sits down, dropping her purse and keys on the table.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: As long as I'm here... you hungry?
speaker_heading: SARA
text: Starved.
text: Sara smiles gratefully. Rebecca opens the menu.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I can't believe she ran out on you.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I know. Thanks for coming.
text: Rebecca looks up from the menu.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Tracy had her shot tonight.
dialog: Tomorrow you're all mine. I'll show
dialog: you the big city.. .the right way.
dialog: And I promise I won't abandon you.
dialog: Deal?
text: Sara smiles.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Deal.
scene_heading: INT. MOCA - DAY
text: Rebecca leads Sara through the sculpture room.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: These are the modern pieces. A
dialog: little wilder than the old stuff.
text: She's a savvy tour guide, confident, at ease. She doesn't
text: just walk past pieces -- she studies them. Sara's impressed.
text: Sara's cell phone buzzes. She checks the display: "Jason".
text: She tilts it so that Rebecca can see and rolls her eyes. She
text: buries her cell phone in her purse.
text: Sara spots a bizarre metal structure and walks over to it.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Okay, I have no idea what this is
dialog: supposed to be.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: Even I don't get that one. Come
dialog: on, I want to show you something.
scene_heading: INT. MOCA - LATER
text: Rebecca shows Sara into a room full of paintings. In the
text: background is a banner announcing an upcoming Richard Prince
dialog: exhibition.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 31.
text: They stop in front of Richard Prince's "Nurse of
text: Greenmeadow." It's a portrait of a woman in a nurse's mask.
text: Her eyes peer directly at the viewer. Blood is smeared on her
text: smock.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: This is my favorite.
text: Sara steps closer to examine it. Rebecca stays behind her.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I love how he captures her
dialog: personality through her eyes. It's
dialog: like she really wants to help you.
text: Rebecca's hands tug anxiously at her shirt. She really wants
dialog: Sara to like this painting.
text: Sara moves even closer. She squints, trying to see what
text: Rebecca sees. The woman's expression in the painting is
text: actually pretty sinister.
text: Sara's a little freaked out... but she turns to see Rebecca's
text: hopeful expression. Sara brightens.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Amazing. I love it.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY
text: Sara and Rebecca window shop along a block of thrift stores.
text: Sara spots a graffiti-laden wall next to a tattoo parlor.
text: Some first-rate tagging here -- bright colors, funky shapes.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: That is so cool.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: No graffiti in Des Moines?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Sure. "Bobby loves Jenny. Chrissy
dialog: loves Rick." Nothing like this.
text: Rebecca pulls out her camera.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Hey, smile.
text: Sara poses... but now grabs Rebecca and pulls her in.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Both of us.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 32.
text: They both hold the camera, extended at arm's length. Rebecca
text: clicks. She looks at the picture. She can see the tattoo
text: parlor in the background.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Now that's one "art form" I don't
dialog: get. Needles into skin? No thanks.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I have a tattoo.
text: Rebecca smiles. Yeah, right. But she can see in Sara's eyes
dialog: that she's serious.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Really?
text: Sara pulls down her shirt and sweater a bit to reveal, over
text: her heart, a simple tattoo: "Emily".
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: My older sister. She died when I
dialog: was nine.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: (pats her heart)
dialog: This keeps her with me.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I always wanted a sister.
text: Sara smiles and interlocks her arm with Rebecca's as they
text: walk down the street.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - DAY
text: Sara sits on her bed in sweats, typing on her laptop. Rebecca
text: sits on her own bed, glancing over at Sara as she draws.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Guess who I'm listing as my
dialog: favorite artist on my Facebook
dialog: page?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Richard Prince.
text: Rebecca smiles, genuinely touched. She walks over to check
dialog: out the rest of Sara's Facebook Favorites. Favorite book,
dialog: favorite band, etc.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: Your favorite movie is "Coyote
dialog: Ugly"?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Don't laugh. It's about a small
dialog: town girl making it in the big
dialog: city.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Isn't every movie?!
text: They both laugh.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET - DUSK
text: Sara, in shorts and warm-up jacket, runs down the sidewalk.
text: Her head's on a swivel, taking in the city sights.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT
text: Rebecca takes down a few of her drawings. In their place, she
text: puts up a big "Coyote Ugly" poster. She straightens it out.
text: Satisfied.
text: She checks her watch and walks to the window. She looks out,
text: anxious for Sara to come home.
text: She looks over at Sara's side of the room. Curious, she
text: starts perusing her things. Books... CDs...
text: She walks to Sara's dresser and picks up the picture of
text: Emily. She tenderly brushes Emily's face with her thumb.
text: She spots Sara's silver chain. She picks it up and places it
text: around her neck. She fingers it carefully and looks at
text: herself in the mirror. She smiles.
scene_heading: EXT. CARNEGIE DORM - NIGHT
text: Sara finishes off her run strong, striding out the last ten
text: yards to the dorm. She catches her breath and hears a kitten.
text: Sara looks in-between the columns outside the dorm and finds
text: a STRAY KITTEN. She's cute as they come, a black-and-white
dialog: furball.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Hey there.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 34.
text: The kitten purrs.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Look at you.
text: She kneels and pets it. The kitten purrs.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: No collar, baby?
text: Sara glances around to see if anyone is watching.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT
text: Sara quickly walks in and closes the door. Rebecca sits in
text: her windowsill, drawing. Sara sits down on her own bed. She
text: notices the "Coyote Ugly" poster.
speaker_heading: SARA
speaker_heading: (TAKEN ABACK)
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I thought you'd like it.
text: Rebecca sees the moving bulge under Sara's jacket. She cuts
text: Sara a look. Sara sighs. Apprehensively, she unzips her
text: jacket and the kitten pops out. Rebecca sits up. The kitten
text: jumps over to her bed. She pets it.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Sara...
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I know, I know. It's stupid, and
dialog: I've just broken about forty
dialog: different dorm rules, and I should
dialog: just take it to a shelter...
speaker_heading: REBECCA
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: What do you want to name it?
text: Sara's face lights up. She smiles gratefully.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Really?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: It'll be our secret. Just between
dialog: us.
text: Rebecca keeps petting the kitten. Getting more attached.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I named her in the elevator.
dialog: Cuddles.
text: She smiles and scoops her up. Suddenly, her smile vanishes.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Is that my necklace?
text: Rebecca touches it. She'd forgotten she still had it on.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Sorry. I was just trying it on.
text: Sara puts down the kitten and walks to Rebecca, who quickly
text: takes it off. Sara takes it back, annoyed. She rubs it
text: protectively.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: This was my sister's.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Oh.
text: Sara looks at it a moment longer. She looks at Rebecca.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: You can borrow anything of mine.
dialog: Except for this. Okay? It's the
dialog: only thing I kept of hers.
text: Rebecca nods. Sara sits down on the bed next to her.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I'm really sorry.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: It's okay. You didn't know.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Were you two close?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Yeah. You're the first roommate
dialog: I've had since she died. So, it
dialog: feels a little odd.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: In a good way or a bad way?
text: Sara smiles.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: A good way.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPUS QUADS - MORNING
text: Establishing of life at the quads.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - DAY
text: A cool college hangout lined with old wooden tables and comfy
text: couches. More like a living room than a coffee shop. Lots of
text: laid-back STUDENTS and...
text: One stressed-out Sara, dropping drinks off at a table and now
text: rushing back to the register for the next order. Her CO-
text: WORKER, clearly stoned, moves in slow motion. Not a care in
dialog: his world.
speaker_heading: SARA
speaker_heading: (TO CUSTOMER)
dialog: You wanted a mocha smoothie, right?
dialog: O.K. Do you know what's in that?
text: The kid shrugs. Sara hops to the blender and guesses some
text: ingredients. She starts it up. She takes her hand off the
dialog: lid, and...
text: THE BLENDER EXPLODES, splashing mocha smoothie all over her
text: apron. She's frozen in shock. The co-worker casually hands
text: her a towel. She snatches it. She turns to find...
text: STEPHEN, standing at the front of the line.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
text: This seems like a pattern.
text: Sara smiles. She's psyched to see him, in spite of the havoc.
text: She leans in and speaks quietly.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Just because I kissed you doesn't
dialog: mean I'll let you cut in line.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: So what does it mean?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 37.
text: She coyly shrugs.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Hey, the gentlemen of Psi Upsilon
dialog: are reviving a sacred tradition
dialog: tonight.
text: Sara stares at him blankly. He smiles.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: We're having another keg party.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I.. dunno. I'm still having
text: flashbacks from the last one.
text: Sara laughs.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: You know what? How about if I use
dialog: you as my excuse not to go.
text: Sara smiles, bits of smoothie dripping from her apron.
scene_heading: INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY
text: Sara walks off the elevator, still sky-high. She walks
text: through the lounge, where Tracy sits on the couch. A

speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Hey.
text: Sara thinks about ignoring her but stops. Her tone is cold.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Psi U. tonight?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: So you can ditch me again?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Sara... the guy had a Porsche. And
text: a hot tub.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: That's your apology?
text: Tracy jumps up and walks over.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: What I meant to say is -- I'm sorry
dialog: -- I totally screwed up.
text: Down the hall, we see Rebecca open her door and peek out. She
text: watches Tracy and Sara.
text: Tracy gives Sara sad, puppy dog eyes. Sara laughs.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I forgive you.
text: Tracy gives her a big, exaggerated hug. Over Sara's shoulder,
text: she spots Rebecca looking at them. Tracy flashes a big smile.
dialog: Relief at making up with Sara. But that's not how Rebecca
dialog: takes it.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: But you're on your own at Psi U.
dialog: Because...
speaker_heading: (DRAMA BUILDING)
dialog: Someone has a date.
text: Rebecca hears this. She slips back into the room and closes

scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - DAY
text: Sara walks in to find Rebecca slipping into a black dress.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: You look... nice.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
speaker_heading: (EXCITED)

speaker_heading: (DISAPPOINTED)
dialog: Oh. Okay.
text: Major downer. Rebecca goes back to getting dressed. Heavy
text: silence in the room. Sara watches her. A beat.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: You know, I could reschedule.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (being a martyr)
dialog: You don't have to.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I want to. On one condition...
text: Sara pulls a cute jacket from her closet and puts it on
text: Rebecca. They both look at Rebecca in the mirror. Wow.
text: Rebecca smiles.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I love it, who's the designer?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: What are you, a label whore?! Who
dialog: cares ...I got it at a flea market
dialog: and it looks great with the dress.
text: Rebecca nods in agreement.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: It just needs one last touch...
text: She grabs a pair of small, gold hoop earrings from her
text: dresser. She places them in Rebecca's hand.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I'm gonna jump in the shower, then
dialog: we'll head out.
text: She grabs her stuff and hurries out the door.
text: Rebecca eyes the earrings in her palm. She turns towards the
text: full-length mirror behind the door. As she leans into the
text: mirror, we see that her ears aren't pierced.
text: She takes one of the earrings and touches the pin against the
text: skin of her right lobe. After a moment of hesitation...
text: SHE PUSHES THE PIN IN HARD. A small pop. She flinches. Blood
text: trickles down her ear onto her neck. She wipes it off with
text: her thumb and touches the other hoop to her left ear.
scene_heading: INT. ART GALLERY - DUSK
text: Sara and Rebecca at the Richard Prince showing. The paintings
text: are all similar to the one we saw in the museum. A series of
text: women, peering at the viewer.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 40.
text: Rebecca wears her hair up, showing off her earrings. Every
text: guy in the room is checking out these two babes. But
text: Rebecca's into the art, and Sara is texting Stephen.
text: ON CELL PHONE: "sorry. next time : ("
text: Rebecca notices and frowns. Sara puts the phone away and
text: starts studying the paintings.
scene_heading: EXT. COLLEGE DORM - NIGHT
text: It's night and there's not a soul in sight.
scene_heading: INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: We track slowly down the empty hallway, towards the door to
dialog: the...
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - LATER
text: Sara sleeps peacefully. Cuddles lies on top of her, awake.
text: Her eyes glowing in the dark. Creepy. But not as creepy as...
text: Rebecca in the other bed. She's staring back at the kitten.
text: Envy in her eyes. Of Cuddles... or of Sara?
text: Rebecca removes the covers and quietly gets out of bed. She
text: walks over to Sara's bed... but not to pet Cuddles. She
text: stands directly above Sara. Looking down at her. If Sara
dialog: would simply open her eyes, she'd see her.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - BARELY SUNRISE
text: Tracy is passed out in her bed. She stirs as she wakes. She
text: reaches around her, slapping her end table.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Water. I need water.
text: She stumbles to the mini-fridge and looks in: Empty. She
text: groans. She grabs an empty cup... opens her door...
text: And lets out a sharp little scream.
scene_heading: INT. DORM - HALLWAY - SAME
text: Rebecca sits right across from Tracy's door, her back against
text: the wall. Staring at Tracy.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Rebecca? What are you doing?
text: Rebecca cocks her head at Tracy, as if she's trying to
text: comprehend her. A beat. She stands... and walks to her.
text: Tracy takes a step back, shaken by Rebecca's calm, morose
text: demeanor. Rebecca stares right into her eyes.
text: She makes a slight move towards Tracy, who flinches. Rebecca
text: turns and walks down to her room. At her door, she turns and
text: smiles. She disappears into her room.
text: Tracy stands there, spooked.
scene_heading: EXT. QUADS - DAY
text: AERIAL VIEW of Sara and Rebecca walking to class. Tracy walks
text: ten yards behind them, waiting until...
text: Rebecca and Sara wave "goodbye" to each other and head down

speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Hey. How was the party? Are you
dialog: still the beer bong queen?
text: But Tracy's in no mood to joke. She pulls Sara to a stop.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Listen... something is up with your
dialog: roommate.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: She was outside my room this
dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Doing what?
speaker_heading: TRACY
text: Waiting for me. I opened my door...
text: and there she was. Just sitting

speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Are you sure?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: You don't believe me?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: No, it's just... why would she do
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Why don't you ask her? I've gotta
dialog: go...I'll see ya later.
text: Tracy stops and watches Sara as she continues on. Tracy

text: catch Rebecca standing in front of a nearby building.
text: Rebecca stares at Tracy much like she did in the hallway.
text: Tracy leaves in a hurry.
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM / STUDIO
text: Sara sits in her Design class. Professor Roberts stands at
text: the podium. Three white design mannequins behind him, each
text: sporting a different fashion style.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: Contrary to popular opinion, beauty
dialog: is not in the eye of the beholder.
text: It's in the hands of the designer.
text: Sara listens intently, soaking it all in. Her cell buzzes
text: with a text message. She discreetly takes a look.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: Who can tell me the difference
dialog: between fashion and style?
text: FROM IRENE: "4th &amp; ford. be there now." Sara smiles at the
dialog: message.
text: Professor Roberts notices Sara looking at her cell phone and
text: calls on her.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: Miss Matthews?
text: Without missing a beat, Sara replies.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Fashion's something you can buy,
dialog: but style you either have or you
dialog: don't.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: Exactly. All the money in the
dialog: world can't buy you style.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: But it can buy you a good stylist.
text: The class chuckles. Professor Roberts smiles.
scene_heading: EXT. BUILDING - DAY
text: Sara comes out of the building, texting on her cell as she

speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Hey. How'd you know when my class
dialog: got out?
text: Rebecca shrugs, playing it off.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I'm your roommate.

speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. QUADS - LATER

speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Listen... Tracy told me something
dialog: kinda weird. She says you... scared
dialog: her this morning.
text: Rebecca stops and looks at Sara. She starts laughing.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: It's more like she scared me. She
text: was racing to the bathroom like she
text: was gonna hurl. She almost knocked
dialog: me over.
text: A beat as Sara ponders it all. She smiles.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: The girl does like to party.
dialog: Anyway, I wouldn't worry about it.
text: Rebecca takes a victory sip as Sara gets another text from
dialog: Irene: "where r u?!?!?!"
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I gotta go meet Irene.
dialog: (raises her cup)
dialog: Thanks for the coffee.
text: Rebecca watches her walk off. She takes another sip.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY
text: Sara gets out of a cab. She looks up at a big building.
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO - HALLWAY
text: Sara walks through a design studio. Models and make-up
text: artists are rushing around, dragging thousands of dollars
text: worth of dresses. Sara loves the place's chaotic energy.
text: She knocks on an open door and sees a YOUNG MODEL being
text: worked on by a designer who isn't much older. IRENE, 28.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: (mouth full of pins)
dialog: Finally.
text: She gets up to hug Sara. Nearly tearing the dress.
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO - BACKSTAGE - LATER
text: Irene is putting a dress together on a MODEL. Sara watches in
text: awe. An OLDER DESIGNER walks by... checks on Irene's work...
text: nods his approval... and leaves.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I so want to be you when I grow up.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: IRENE

speaker_heading: MAKE-UP GIRL
speaker_heading: (TO SARA)
dialog: She's going to be a star.
text: Irene rolls her eyes.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: You know, your dad left me four
dialog: messages last week. Making sure I'm
text: looking out for his baby.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Oh god. I hope you told him I'm
dialog: closing down the library every
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: I told him I haven't seen you. And
dialog: that for all I know you're a crack
dialog: ho by now.
text: Even the model laughs.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Perfect.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY - DUSK
text: Sara walks along, looking for a table. She spots Stephen
text: sitting by himself. Drumming on his leg with a pencil.
text: Ignoring the open textbook in front of him.
text: She sits down across from him. They both smile.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: I haven't seen you around too much
dialog: since you blew me off for dinner.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Sorry again. Actually, how about
dialog: dinner tonight?
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Hellllo. I'm studying.
text: She takes his book. He's on page two.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Page two? Busted!

speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Yeah, but it's really dense.

speaker_heading: STEPHEN (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Kim exits the bathroom and passes Tracy coming the other way.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: How's it goin?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Hey.
text: Tracy, wearing just a towel, and brushing her teeth as she
text: walks, steps into the bathroom.
scene_heading: INT. DORM BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: She hums to herself as she spits out the toothpaste.
text: She removes the towel and steps into the shower, pulling the
text: curtain closed. As she shampoos her hair...
text: The lights go out.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: You have to be kidding me. Hey!
text: The only light is some distorted moonlight through the
text: window. Tracy steps out of the shower, grabbing her towel.
text: Just as she starts to feel her way along the wall...
text: The lights come back on. She sighs happily... sheds her
text: towel... and steps back under the steaming water. A beat.
text: The lights go off again.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Goddammit !
text: She turns off the shower. A beat of silence, but now... one
text: of the other showers turns on. What the hell?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Hey, how about turning on the
dialog: light?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 47.
text: No response. Yet another shower turns on.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Who's out there?
text: Tracy, back in her towel, nervous now, feels her way along
text: the wall again. She turns on the lights.
text: The curtains are drawn in front of both running showers.
text: Tracy stares at them. A beat.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I know it's you.
text: She walks over to the shower. A beat. She rips away one
text: curtain. Nothing behind it but the running shower. She turns
text: it off. She stares at the other curtain.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Sara thinks you're weird. She told
dialog: me.
text: She pulls back the other curtain... nothing. She turns off
text: that shower, too. But she can still hear running water.
text: She looks back. The curtain from her own shower is closed
text: again. The sound of running water behind it.
text: She walks over.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Not funny, Rebecca.
dialog: (under her breath)
dialog: Bitch.
text: She grips the curtain. She steels herself. She yanks the
text: curtain open to see...
text: Just running water. Tracy shakes her head. She looks around --
text: no one. She slips her towel off and slips back under the
dialog: water. Screw Rebecca -- she's going to finish this shower.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Freak.
text: Just as the warm water starts to relax her...
text: THE SHOWER CURTAIN CRASHES OVER HER, pile-driven by Rebecca.
text: The curtain comes right off the rings.
text: Tracy is slammed against the shower wall. She hits the floor
text: hard, with Rebecca on top of her. Water pelting them both.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 48.
text: Rebecca clamps a hand over Tracy's mouth and pins her against
text: the wall. The shower curtain covers her from the neck down.
text: Tracy -- wide-eyed and terrified -- stares at Rebecca.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: So Sara thinks I'm weird? Let me
dialog: tell you what I think. I think
dialog: you're a little whore, and a bad
dialog: influence on her. And I think that
dialog: if you tell anyone about... what
dialog: I'm about to do... you'll regret
dialog: it.
text: Rebecca, one hand still on Tracy's mouth, slides her other
text: hand beneath the shower curtain. Tracy's eyes widen further.
text: Rebecca finds what she's looking for... gets the grip she
text: needs... and violently jerks her hand out of the curtain.
text: A muffled scream from Tracy. Tears stream down her face.
text: Rebecca stands. As Tracy sobs quietly on the shower floor,
text: Rebecca looks down at...
text: The bloody ring in her hand.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Nice belly ring.
text: She tosses it to Tracy... and walks away.
scene_heading: INT. FRAT HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Sara and Stephen are sitting on a couch. His arm around her

speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: I'm going to flunk my test
dialog: tomorrow, thanks to you.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Then let's make sure it was worth
dialog: it.
text: She gives him a slow, lingering kiss.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Duh, joke's on you. I was going to
dialog: flunk anyway.
text: She smiles.
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 49.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT
text: Rebecca sits on her bed, petting Cuddles, blood still on her
text: fingers, humming the tune that Tracy was humming in the
text: bathroom. She hears steps and voices in the hallway. She
dialog: smiles -- must be Sara.
text: She quickly turns off the light and pretends to sleep. But
text: the steps pass her door and keep going. Not Sara.
text: She turns on the light. Worry in her eyes. She picks up her
text: cell phone and dials.
scene_heading: INT. DORM LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: Sara and Stephen step off the elevator. Time to say goodbye.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Thanks for helping me... not study.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Anytime.
text: He kisses her. Sweet and tender. Until... Sara sees Rebecca.
text: Standing just five feet away. Staring at them.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Where were you?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Oh, hi.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I kept calling and calling.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Oh. I turned my cell off at the
dialog: library and forgot to turn it back
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: (FRAZZLED)
dialog: Rebecca... this is Stephen.
text: He flashes a smile. Rebecca doesn't even look at him.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I'm going to bed now. I'm glad
dialog: you're okay.
text: She walks out of the lounge. A beat. That was awkward. Sara
text: bites her lip, as if to say: "What can you do?"
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: You got a curfew?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Well, she's right...I shoulda
dialog: called.
text: He smiles -- no big deal. He kisses her and steps into the
text: elevator. They look at each other, waiting for the ancient
text: doors to close. Stephen steps forward and sneaks in one more
text: kiss. The doors close.
text: Sara smiles; what a night. She glances down toward her door
text: and sighs.
scene_heading: EXT. QUADS - MORNING
text: Sara and Rebecca walk in silence, sipping their coffees.
text: Rebecca looks straight ahead, listening to her Walkman. As
text: they reach the fork in the path...
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I guess I'll see you later.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Sara...
speaker_heading: (SHE TURNS)
dialog: Last night. I was just worried
dialog: about you.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: You don't need to worry about me.
dialog: I can take care of myself. Okay?
text: Rebecca slowly nods.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Sara. We're good, right?
text: A beat. Sara nods and smiles.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY - DAY
text: Sara and Stephen at a table, books spread around them.
text: Stephen is reading Rolling Stone.

dialog: to add her.
dialog:

dialog: 51.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY
text: Rebecca sits in a chair on the other side of the library.
text: Unbeknownst to Sara and Stephen, Rebecca watches them through
dialog: the glass.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY
text: Sara clicks onto Rebecca's Facebook page. She's listed only
text: one friend: Sara. She's posted the picture of her and Sara in
text: front of the graffiti wall. And some of her drawings. And a
text: picture of a pretty brunette teenager, captioned "Maria."
text: Sara looks at Rebecca's interests. Favorite Artist: Richard
dialog: Prince. Favorite Passion: Drawing. Favorite movie: Coyote
text: Ugly. Sara smiles. Best Friend: SARA. Her smile fades.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I'm already her best friend?
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: That's a little sad.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Stop.
text: But the look on her face says she agrees.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Maybe she REALLY likes you...if you
dialog: know what I mean.
text: She looks at him quizzically.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I don't.
text: He just looks at her, raising his eyebrows suggestively.
speaker_heading: SARA (CONT'D)
dialog: You... are...a...moron.
text: He grins.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY - PERIODICAL RACKS
text: Rebecca watches Stephen kiss Sara, her expression is tough to
text: read. Is she jealous... or entranced? Sara gets up and
text: leaves. Stephen goes to the stacks.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 52.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY - STACKS - LATER
text: Stephen, alone, searches for a book among the remote stacks.
text: The stacks are massive and endless -- row after row of them.
text: Stephen thumbs through books, not finding the one he needs.
text: He drops a book and bends down to pick it up. Over his
dialog: shoulder, we see...
text: REBECCA'S EYES in the space between the shelves. She's in the
text: next aisle over.
text: Stephen replaces the book. He walks down the aisle, looking
text: at the numbers of the books.
text: Rebecca mimics his pacing as she follows him down her aisle.
text: Her hands gently brush against the books, her eyes on
text: Stephen. He turns in her direction and stops in his tracks.
text: So does Rebecca. She's completely still.
text: Stephen walks over. He puts his hand on the book that covers
text: Rebecca. He's about to pull it out and reveal her. But it's
text: not the right one. He keeps walking.
text: He reaches the end of his aisle... and Rebecca the end of
text: hers. She's right around the corner from him. He reads the
text: markers at the end of the aisle, trying to figure out which
dialog: direction to go.
text: Rebecca's hands are sweaty. She's nervous. Does she want to
text: get caught? Stephen turns right, away from her, and starts
text: down the next aisle.
text: Rebecca softly exhales. And now whispers to herself.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Stephen.
text: Stephen stops dead. Did he hear something? Guess not. He
text: keeps going, scanning the book numbers again.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Shit, wrong aisle.
text: He doubles back, and turns into Rebecca's aisle. But it's...
text: EMPTY. We hear a door close in the distance.

scene_heading: EXT. PARK - NIGHT
text: Stephen and Sara walk on a tree-lined path. Holding hands. He

speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Should we head back home?
text: They walk by a small playground comprised of the slide,
dialog: jungle gym, etc.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: The question is "whose home?"
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Hmmm...
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I'll make you a bet. I go back to
dialog: your place or you take me home to
dialog: my twin bed and roommate.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: What's the bet?
text: She eyes the jungle gym.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - PLAYGROUND - NIGHT

dialog: Stephen's worse off.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: This is kind of a stupid bet.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Why'd you agree?
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Apparently, I'm kind of a stupid
dialog: guy.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Making me laugh isn't going to help
dialog: you.
text: They stare each other down. She's stifling a laugh, much
text: more in control as Stephen is straining.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 54.
text: He tries to swing his legs and kick her. She avoids him. He
text: catches a peek at her bare midriff. Finally, this makes him
text: fall. She then lets go, victorious.
speaker_heading: SARA (CONT'D)
dialog: I was a gymnast until I hit a
dialog: growth spurt my freshman year.
text: Stephen brushes himself off. Dejected that he was "this
text: close". She walks up to him. Cocky. Gives him a playful
dialog: shove.
speaker_heading: SARA (CONT'D)
dialog: So I win.
text: He gives her a playful shove back.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: So.
text: She seductively walks back towards him. Takes his hand.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: So...let's go back to your place.
text: She gives him a seductive grin.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

text: She starts pacing the floor. She angrily moves Sara's chair
text: back to her side. She whips out her phone and eyes the dial
text: button. She starts to dial... but kills the call.
text: She picks up her sketchpad again. Suddenly:
text: A BUZZING SOUND from Sara's desk. Rebecca pulls out the desk
text: drawer and finds Sara's cell phone. On the call screen:
dialog: "JASON".
text: A long beat. She pushes the talk button... but just listens.
speaker_heading: JASON (O.S.)
dialog: Sara?
speaker_heading: REBECCA

speaker_heading: REBECCA
speaker_heading: (WHISPERS)

speaker_heading: REBECCA

scene_heading: INT. PSI U. FRAT HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Sara and Stephen slam along the walls, in a fever. Kissing

speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Just give me thirty seconds.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: You're kidding.

scene_heading: INT. FRAT HOUSE - ROOM - SAME
text: Stephen is a whirlwind. He tosses everything -- beer cans,

speaker_heading: STEPHEN
text: Almost there.
speaker_heading: SARA (O.S.)
dialog: (through the door)
dialog: I'm going to start taking my

speaker_heading: STEPHEN

speaker_heading: SARA (O.S.)

speaker_heading: STEPHEN

speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Who do we have here? Hey guys! Let
dialog: me ask you. Bra or panties? Bra?
dialog: Okay, okay. Just calm down.
text: The door swings open. Stephen stands in front of her,
text: grinning.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: I knew you didn't have the guts.
text: She flicks her bra at his face. He catches it, shocked. He
text: tosses it aside and yanks her into the room. The door slams
text: shut behind them.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - SAME
text: Rebecca is breathing harder and faster now. Still holding the
text: phone, from which we hear Jason's moans.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Say my name, Jason. Until I tell
dialog: you to stop.
text: She puts the phone on speaker and lays it on the pillow
text: beside her. Both her hands ease back under the covers.
speaker_heading: JASON (O.S.)
dialog: Sara... Sara... Sara...
text: Rebecca writhes, eyes closed.
scene_heading: INT. FRAT HOUSE - ROOM
text: Sara and Stephen make out in bed, half-naked. He lies on top
text: of her. Looking into her eyes. Sweet and intimate.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Sara...
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - SAME
text: Rebecca writhes and moans.
speaker_heading: JASON (O.S.)
dialog: Sara... Sara...
text: They moan together. Louder and louder... and now they finish.
text: A long beat.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: JASON (O.S.)
dialog: (catching his breath)
dialog: Jesus, Sara. That was incredible.
text: Rebecca smiles.
speaker_heading: JASON (O.S.)
dialog: I miss you so much.
text: Her smile dies. She picks up the phone. A cruel gleam in her
text: eyes.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Don't ever call me again.
text: She kills the call. And now deletes it from the phone log.
scene_heading: EXT. CARNEGIE DORM - MORNING
text: Carnegie Dorm on a bright, clear morning.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - DAY
text: Sara, hair mussed up but eyes shining. Sara opens her door
text: and steps in. She's tentative, expecting Rebecca to jump down
text: her throat. But Rebecca smiles.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Well, good morning.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Hey. Sorry I didn't call. I forgot
dialog: my phone.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: No problem.
text: Sara opens her desk drawer and grabs her phone. She quickly
dialog: checks. No calls.
text: Rebecca looks Sara over and smiles.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Come on...don't I get any details??
speaker_heading: SARA
speaker_heading: (SMILING)
text: A nice girl doesn't kiss and tell.
text: They laugh. A nice, easy vibe between them.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: You want to go get some breakfa--
text: Before she can finish, Cuddles bolts out the door and down
text: the hallway.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Oh no.
text: Sara chases after her as Rebecca gets up from her bed.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
text: Sara turns the corner to see...
text: The resident assistant, with Cuddles cradled in her arms.
text: Sara apprehensively walks up to him.
dialog: R.A.
dialog: Is this your cat, Sara?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Maybe...
dialog: R.A.
dialog: She's cute...
text: She nods as she gingerly takes Cuddles from his arms. She
text: turns to walk back to the room.
dialog: R.A.
dialog: And if you keep her, I lose my job.
dialog: Do we understand each other?
text: She stops. Turns. Looks at him.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Yes.
text: Sara walks back to her room. Rebecca stands in the doorway.
text: They exchange despondent looks. Screwed.
scene_heading: INT. IRENE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Irene opens the door and Sara walks in.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: What took you so long?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I walked.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: You didn't!
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: It's ten bucks for a cab and I'm a
dialog: student.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Sara! You can't just walk around
text: downtown L.A. at night. This is
dialog: not Des Moines.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Duh?
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Seriously, listen to me. That's
dialog: why I own a gun.
text: Sara's shocked.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Absolutely! Big cities are
text: crawling with crazies.
text: Sara moves into the apartment. Her phone rings. She
dialog: answers.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Hey. Oh, Hi. Yeah, I'm over at
dialog: Irene's. I meant to leave you a
dialog: note. Uh huh, uh huh, oh! That's a
dialog: good idea. Let me check, hold on.
text: Sara covers the phone and turns to Irene.
speaker_heading: SARA
speaker_heading: (TO IRENE)
dialog: Do you like cats?
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Yeah, why?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: We have to get rid of one.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Can't. Travel too much. Poor
dialog: thing would starve to death.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: You're right.
dialog: (back into phone)
dialog: No, she can't. Huh? Oh I don't
dialog: know... whenever I get there. Bye.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Who was that?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: My roommate. More than a little
dialog: overprotective.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: That's no fun.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: So, where is it?
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: You said you had a surprise for me?
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Oh yeah. I went through my
dialog: closet. There's nothing here I've
dialog: worn in the past six months.
text: Irene walks toward the couch where there's a pile of clothes.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: You're kidding, all of these?! Oh
dialog: no.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: What ...what?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: We have no closet space at the
text: dorms. Rebecca's already using
dialog: half of mine.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Oh my God, I just had the best
dialog: idea.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Why don't you move in here with me?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Seriously?
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Yeah, I'm never here. The place is
dialog: huge. Ditch the roommate. And,
dialog: the building allows pets.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Huh. Let me talk to Rebecca about
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Great.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: So, how's Jason? I really liked
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: We broke up.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Yeah ...he sucked.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT - LATER
text: Sara stuffs her new clothes into her tiny closet. The bags
text: spill out into the room, taking up floor space.
text: Rebecca sits on her bed, her laptop open. She's staring at
text: Irene's Facebook Profile. There are some racy pictures of
text: Irene and some girlfriends.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Hey. What're those?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Irene gave them to me. She had a
dialog: lot more but we don't have the
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Too bad she couldn't take Cuddles,
dialog: huh?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Well, maybe that's not a problem.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Really?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Yeah. She actually suggested that
dialog: I move in with her.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: You want to move?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: No, of course not. I love living
dialog: here... with you.
text: Sara smiles as she sits down next to Rebecca, trying to put a
text: bright spin on things.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Look, I'd still technically be
dialog: living here. So you wouldn't have
text: to get a new roommate. Her place is
dialog: huge and it's not like you couldn't
dialog: use the extra closet space. I'd
dialog: just move some of my stuff over,
dialog: and spend a few nights a week
dialog: there. We'd both have a lot more
dialog: space.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I don't want more space. I want...
text: She checks herself. A beat of awkward silence.
speaker_heading: SARA
text: Nothing's set in stone. It's just
dialog: something to think about. Plus we'd
dialog: be able to keep Cuddles.
text: As Sara hangs more new clothes in her closet, Rebecca stares
text: across the room at...
dialog: Cuddles.
scene_heading: EXT. QUADS - DAY
text: As Sara crosses the quads, she spots Tracy up ahead, walking
dialog: by herself.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Tracy!
text: Tracy slows for a split-second, then keeps walking. As if she
text: didn't hear anything. Sara hurries to catch up with her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Tracy... hey.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Oh, hey.
text: Tracy smiles, but weakly. The girl's lost all her sparkle.
text: Her eyes dart around nervously, like a bird's.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I heard you changed dorms.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Yeah, Conrad Hall. Seemed like a
dialog: better vibe.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Well, we should get together. Like
dialog: grab a bite or something. Right?
speaker_heading: REBECCA (O.S.)
dialog: Sara!
text: Sara turns and waves at Rebecca.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Hi.
text: Rebecca starts to walk over to Tracy and Sara.
speaker_heading: TRACY
speaker_heading: (TO SARA)
dialog: I'll call you.
text: But she's already walking away.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Tracy?!
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What was that about?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I don't know. She just walked
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Well, she's always been a flake.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 65.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - LATER
text: Sara whips up a latte for a customer, her cell phone to her
dialog: ear. She's really got the hang of this job now. In charge,
text: moving with a purpose.
text: She snatches an issue of High Times from her co-worker's hand
text: and points him toward the sink. He starts washing blenders.
speaker_heading: SARA
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Hey. I do so call, Mom. Geez.
text: Her latte customer rolls his eyes. Moms. He takes his drink
text: and walks away.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Well, actually, I was thinking I'd
dialog: do Thanksgiving here and see you
dialog: guys for Christmas.
text: She listens, her face telling us that she doesn't like what
text: she's hearing.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Ya know what, I'm at work, and I'm
dialog: really getting slammed...
text: There isn't another customer in sight.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I'll call you later, okay? Tell
dialog: Dad I said hello. Bye.
text: She hangs up the phone and sighs.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - DUSK
text: Rebecca gathers her laundry into a giant duffle bag. As she
text: carries it toward the door, she passes Cuddles, curled up on
text: Sara's bed. She scoops her up.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Looks like it's just you and me
dialog: tonight.
scene_heading: INT. DORM BASEMENT HALLWAY - DUSK
text: Rebecca walks downstairs, down the hallway to the laundry
dialog: room.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 66.
scene_heading: INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - LATER
text: Rebecca waits for her clothes to finish drying. Cuddles plays
text: with a sock on top of a nearby washer.
text: Rebecca checks on her clothes. They're dry, with two minutes
text: still left on the timer. She stuffs the clothes into her
text: duffle bag. She walks to the washers and picks up Cuddles.
text: She pets her gently.
text: She walks back to the dryer and places Cuddles inside.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
speaker_heading: (BABY TALK)
dialog: See how nice and warm it is in
dialog: there?
text: Cuddles seems to enjoy the warmth. Rebecca closes the door
text: and watches the confused kitten paw at the glass.
text: She gently pushes the start button, just enough to get the
text: dryer moving for a sec. Cuddles stumbles, falls over, and
text: gets back up.
text: Rebecca pushes the button again, a little longer this time.
text: Cuddles stumbles. Flips over.
text: The dryer beeps. OUT OF TIME. Cuddles meows at Rebecca,
text: wanting out. She reaches into her pocket... and pulls out her
text: last quarter. She gently places it in the slot.
text: ON DRYER DISPLAY: 15 MINUTES. Rebecca stares through the
text: glass at the kitten. She fingers the button.
dialog: Before she pushes it --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - LATER
text: Sara walks in to find Rebecca sprawled on her bed, crying.
text: She rushes over.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Hey, what's wrong?
text: Rebecca looks up at her, eyes red. Ashamed.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
text: Cuddles got out.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Oh no. In the dorm?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Outside.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I was doing laundry... I took her
dialog: with me... She jumped out of the
dialog: bag and ran outside. I went after
dialog: her, but...
speaker_heading: (WHIMPERS)
dialog: I'm so sorry.
text: Sara stands, pissed. She wants to really go off on Rebecca...
text: but the girl's so distraught, so fragile.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Maybe she'll come back.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
speaker_heading: (EMPHATIC)
dialog: She won't.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I'm going to go find her.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Do you want me to help?
text: But Sara's already gone, slamming the door behind her.
scene_heading: INT. CAFETERIA - MORNING
text: Sara and Rebecca sit alone at a table. Eating quietly.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Maybe it's... just karma or
dialog: something. We weren't allowed to
dialog: keep her anyway.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: You're not mad at me?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: It was an accident.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: It's just... stress after stress,
dialog: you know?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Is something else wrong?
text: A beat as Sara decides whether to confide.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: My parents really want me to come
dialog: home for Thanksgiving.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: You don't want to go?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: It's not exactly the most festive
dialog: holiday in the Matthews household.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Emily died two days before
dialog: Thanksgiving.
text: A beat. Rebecca pats Sara's hand.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I know I should be there with them,
text: but it's like there's a ghost at
dialog: the table.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: You can come with me.
speaker_heading: SARA
speaker_heading: (THROWN)
dialog: What?
text: Rebecca sits up, her excitement growing.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Yeah, spend Thanksgiving at my
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Your folks wouldn't mind?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
speaker_heading: (LAUGHS)
dialog: Please. Like they'd even notice.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Okay, we'll see. Thanks.

dialog: lecture.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: Your midterm designs are due
dialog: Friday. Remember, class:
dialog: Simplicity. Who founded our
dialog: industry? Eve -- when she handed
dialog: Adam that fig leaf.
text: Students laugh on their way out the door. As Sara walks past
dialog: Roberts...
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: Sara. Could I see you in my office,
dialog: please?
speaker_heading: SARA
speaker_heading: (SURPRISED)
dialog: Sure. I've got a class right now.
dialog: But I'll come right after it.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - DAY
text: Sara knocks on Professor Roberts' open door. She steps into
text: his office. It's small and intimate, with books stacked along
text: every wall. Scraps of fabric are pinned to cork boards.
text: Roberts smiles at her from his chair. He walks to the door
text: and closes it. He walks back, pulls a chair close to hers,
text: and sits down. She crosses her legs, her knees accidentally
text: brushing against his.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: I don't think I need to tell you
dialog: how impressed I've been with your
dialog: work.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Every year I go to Fashion Week in
text: Paris. It's dazzling. The photo
dialog: shoots... the parties... that
text: incredible runway. When the first
text: model bursts through the curtain
text: and hits that catwalk? Sara, a roar
dialog: goes up from that crowd that's
dialog: like... nothing you've ever heard.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: The college allows me to take one
dialog: student. All expenses paid.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS (CONT-D)
dialog: Full backstage access. Usually,
dialog: it's a senior.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: But it doesn't have to be.
text: Sara's pulse is racing.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I'm not sure I understand. Are you
dialog: saying what I think you're saying?
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: I'm saying you have a shot. You'd
dialog: have to earn it, Sara.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Of course. I'll do... anything.
text: Roberts stands and walks to the window. He looks out at the
text: quad... and now turns back to Sara.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: I'd like to see more danger in your
dialog: work. Your designs are always
dialog: crisp; they're always clear. But
dialog: they're a little... safe.
text: That stung. Sara can't keep the red from rising in her face.
text: Roberts walks over to her.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: Don't be afraid to go to some of
dialog: the...
text: He delicately taps her temple.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS (CONT'D)
dialog: darker places in here.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Okay...
text: He squats beside her, his hand on her shoulder now. He looks
text: into her eyes.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: The best designers push the
dialog: boundaries of what's... acceptable.
dialog: They take chances. Do you like to
dialog: take chances, Sara?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Sometimes.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: So do I.
text: He kisses her. Sara pushes him away, jumping out of her
text: chair. She stands in front of him, shaking.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I can't believe you just did that.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: I took a chance, that's all. With a
dialog: student that I trust.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I better go.
text: Sara grabs her books. As she heads for the door...
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: Paris, Sara. Fashion Week. Don't
dialog: blow the chance of a lifetime.
text: She hurries out of the office.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY - DAY
text: Rebecca sits alone at a study table. Sara walks up and drops
text: down her books. THUD. Students look over from other tables.
text: Sara doesn't care. She sits down and stares blankly into
text: space, trying to forget what just happened. Rebecca leans
text: over, concerned.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: My design professor just kissed me.
text: Rebecca turns very serious. She gets up and sits down next
dialog: to Sara.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Are you alright?
text: Sara nods.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Yeah, it just really creeped me
dialog: out. And I think the asshole's
dialog: married.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 72.
text: Rebecca puts her hand on Sara's.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Professor Roberts at his desk, set to call it a day. He
text: tosses some design sheets into his briefcase.
text: He opens a desk drawer... grabs his wedding ring... and slips
text: it onto his finger.
text: He hears FOOTSTEPS in the hallway. The sexy, unmistakable
text: clicking of a woman's heels. They come closer... and now stop
text: at his door.
text: Roberts watches the door, waiting for a knock. Nothing. He
text: walks to it. He can see the silhouette of two feet at the
text: bottom of the door. He smiles -- Sara, coming back to him.
text: He opens the door, revealing:
text: Rebecca. She wears a snug v-neck cardigan, skin-tight black
text: jeans, and silver stiletto heels. A small purse on her
dialog: shoulder.
text: Roberts swallows his surprise.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Professor Roberts?
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I'm glad I caught you.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: Actually, I was just...
text: But Rebecca steps past him into the office, her heels
text: snapping on the worn hardwood floor.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Roberts, a little annoyed but also intrigued, follows her
text: back inside. They face each other.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: You're not one of my students.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Not yet. That's why I'm here.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 73.
text: She steps to his desk and leans against it. Her cool manner
text: is disarming. A beat.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I'm failing Intro Pysch.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: And why is that?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Because I'm bored. I thought it
dialog: would be all about Freud, and deep
dialog: dark secrets. But it's brain
dialog: chemistry. Synapses. I can't stay
text: awake in class.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: I'm sorry to hear that. But I'm not
dialog: sure what I can do to help.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Tomorrow's the last day to drop a
dialog: course without penalty. Unless I
dialog: can add another one in its place,
dialog: I'll fall way behind in credits.
dialog: Daddy won't take that very well. He
dialog: might even pull the plug. Which
dialog: means...
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I'm pretty much at your mercy,
dialog: Professor.
text: Roberts smiles. This girl is a trip. Is she for real? She's
text: so calm, so steady. Roberts can't get a handle on her.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: Look, I've always made it a policy
dialog: not to accept any students this
dialog: late in the term.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Do I look like just any student to
dialog: you?
text: She smiles... and eases up onto his desk. Facing him. Pretty
text: feet dangling, ankles locked. Jesus.
text: She eases her purse off her shoulder and onto the desk. She
text: sees the framed picture of a WOMAN AND TWO KIDS. She picks it
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Your wife is very pretty.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: Ex-wife .
text: The game is on now. Roberts slowly walks around the desk,
text: until he's behind Rebecca.
text: In the picture frame's reflection, Rebecca sees him slip off
text: his wedding ring. He palms it.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: A few things I'd need to know.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Ask me anything.
text: He's circling the desk now. Predator and prey.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: Do you have any design experience?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: None.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: What do you know about clothes?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Only one thing.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: And what's that?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I definitely look better out of
dialog: them than in them.
text: What an answer. Roberts stops in front of her. He moves in
text: close, between her parting legs. He looks into her eyes.
text: Still steady.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: I think we might be able to work
dialog: something out.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Great. Just tell me and I'll do
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: Kiss me.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I'll take it from there.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 75.
text: He kisses her. She opens her lips for a tantalizing second,
text: and now gently pushes him away. He holds his ground. He's had
dialog: a taste -- he wants a lot more.
text: Suddenly, Rebecca's face hardens.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Ow! You're hurting me! Professor,
dialog: stop!...
text: Roberts stares at her in shock. He's not even touching her.
text: What's going on? Rebecca smiles again.
dialog: This girl is whacked. But damn, Roberts wants her. And her
text: eyes are inviting him back. As he presses in to kiss her
dialog: again...
text: She rockets a knee into his groin and he crumples to the
text: floor, gasping for air. He drops his wedding ring, which
text: rolls away across the floor.
text: Rebecca steps to the desk, where her purse sits open. We can
text: see the Walkman inside. She takes it out. Smiles at him.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Birthday gift. You should get one,
dialog: they're great.
text: She slips on the earbuds... plays with the Walkman for a few
text: seconds... and now hits the play button. We hear their prior
text: conversation, played back.
speaker_heading: WALKMAN
dialog: Great. Just tell me and I'll do
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Kiss me. I'll take it from there.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Owl You're hurting me! Professor,
dialog: stop!...
text: Rage and betrayal in Roberts' eyes.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: You bitch tease!
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Oh, I'm not teasing.
text: She starts to circle him now, as he writhes in pain on the
dialog: floor.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Do you see enough danger in me now,
dialog: Professor? Did I go to a dark
dialog: enough place for you?
text: He recognizes his own words to Sara.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: What? How did?... Who are you?
text: He lunges at her ankle. She steps out of his grasp... and
text: slams the sharp spike of her heel down on his hand. He yells
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: She trusted you.
text: She walks toward the door.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
dialog: Please don't do this. Twenty years.
dialog: Everything I worked for. I'll pay
dialog: for that tape.
text: Rebecca stops at the door. She kneels, picks up his wedding
text: ring, and rolls it across the floor to him.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Yes you will.
text: She walks out the door.
scene_heading: INT. FRAT HOUSE - ROOM
text: Sara sits on Stephen's bed. She is looking out the window,
text: holding a theory book in her hand.
text: Stephen watches her from his side of the bed.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Anything wrong?
text: Sara is taken out of her own world
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Are you ok?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Yeah, sure.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 77.
text: She smiles. Stephen smiles back.
text: Sara looks down in her book again.
scene_heading: EXT. QUADS - DAY
text: Sara looks up at the building. She sighs before she enters.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
text: She walks slowly toward the classroom, letting other students
text: pass her. She steps into the doorway and sees...
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM
text: A WOMAN, standing at Professor Roberts' podium. She gestures
text: for everyone to come in. Sara, like the rest, is confused.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Welcome. I'm Professor Jacobs. I'll
dialog: be taking over the class for the
dialog: rest of the semester.
text: Sara can't believe it. She takes a seat and turns to the
text: STUDENT next to her.
speaker_heading: SARA
speaker_heading: (WHISPERS)
dialog: What happened?
scene_heading: INT. CAFETERIA - DAY
text: Sara walks in with a tray, still a bit dazed. She sees a half-
text: dozen hallmates milling about and Rebecca sitting by herself
text: in the corner, drawing. Sara joins her.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Remember what I told you about
dialog: Professor Roberts?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: SARA
text: He's gone.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What do you mean?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Well, they're calling it a leave of
dialog: absence. But what I heard... someone
dialog: sent the dean an anonymous
text: recording of him hitting on another
dialog: student.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Oh My God.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: That's called Karma.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT
text: Sara serves up two fresh lattes... and now leans against the
text: counter to watch the band. Stephen's band. He catches her
text: looking at him. She smiles. Seriously smitten.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - LATER
text: Stephen, sweaty, is behind the counter helping Sara clean up.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: I've made a decision. You ready?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Lemme hear it.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: I'm gonna quit the band.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: No. Really? Why?
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: It's a waste of time-and we suck.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Why would you say that?
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Well, let me think about this. The
dialog: only places we can get booked is at
dialog: my own frat house and at my
text: girlfriend's coffee shop.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: SARA
speaker_heading: (SMIRKS)
dialog: You're right. You guys do suck.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Hold it. Did you just say
dialog: girlfriend?
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: You heard me.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: So you think it'll be fun to stay
dialog: here during Thanksgiving?
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
text: Dinner at the frat, the football
dialog: games. Don't forget the always
text: awkward, homoerotic humor.
speaker_heading: SARA
text: Sounds like a blast.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Oh. For sure.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - DAY
text: A somber Rebecca stares at herself in the full-length mirror
text: on the back of the front door. A very strange expression in
text: her eyes. She looks herself over, makes a fist, and now...
text: Punches herself on the temple. Hard. She staggers, nearly
text: knocked out. She straightens. Looks in the mirror. Her skin
text: is already bruising. She punches herself again. Same spot.
text: And again, with her other fist this time. And now a shot to
text: her shoulder. And another. It's painful to watch. But she's
text: getting more and more numb to the blows.
text: She inspects herself closely... and now reaches down and
text: grabs an artist's UTILITY KNIFE. It looks like a large,
text: retractable box cutter. She extends the blade all the way
text: out. She pulls up her shirt. Turns to the side a bit. Places
text: the knife against her skin and...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 80.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - DAY
text: Sara opens the door and finds Rebecca curled up in a fetal
text: position in a corner of the room. Sobbing. Sara drops her
text: things and runs over to her.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Oh my God. What happened?
text: She cradles Rebecca, who buries her head in between her
text: knees. Sara checks the bruises on her head and arms.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Rebecca. It's okay. You're safe
dialog: now. Talk to me.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I was looking for Cuddles. A man...
text: pulled me into an alley. He
dialog: tried...
text: Sara holds her. She can't finish.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: It's okay. It's okay. Shhh.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I got away.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: You're alright now.
text: Sara notices a streak of blood against Rebecca's shirt. She
text: pulls it up and sees a slash. Gasps.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - DAY
text: Rebecca, newly showered, hair still wet, sits on her bed in
text: her underwear. Sara is tending to her wounds. Ice for the
text: bruises. Disinfectant for the cut. Rebecca flinches.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: It's not deep, thank God. But you
dialog: should see a doctor.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Rebecca, you need to. And then the
dialog: police.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 81.
text: Rebecca pulls back on her bed, ruining the gauze job.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I don't want to. I can't.
text: Sara pulls out her cell phone.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: You're calling them, or I am.
text: There's a psycho walking around
dialog: this campus.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
speaker_heading: (CRYING AGAIN)
dialog: Please. I didn't see him.
text: She's so frazzled, she's undoing Sara's nursing efforts.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Okay, okay. I won't call. Just let
dialog: me help you.
text: Rebecca calms down. Let's Sara finish. Watching her intently
text: as she works.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DORM - DAY
text: Sara's on the sidewalk in front of her dorm with Stephen.
text: Inside, the lobby is busy with students getting ready to go
dialog: home for the holiday.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Sorry about not staying. But,
dialog: Rebecca...
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: I get it.
speaker_heading: (KISSES HER)
dialog: I'm going to make out with my
dialog: pillow and pretend it's you.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Just say you'll miss me.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: I'll miss you.
text: Rebecca pulls up in her car. Sara gets in. Rebecca gives
text: Stephen an "I win" look as Sara closes the door.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 82.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DRIVING: LATER
text: Sara looks down at her phone.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I haven't heard from Jason in
dialog: weeks. It's weird how he just
dialog: stopped calling.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: It's what you wanted, right?
text: Sara nods, reassuring herself.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Yeah. Yeah it is.
text: Sara looks out the window. Rebecca shows a hint of a smile.
scene_heading: EXT. GATED MANSION - DUSK
text: Rebecca's car pulls up to the iron gates of a huge mansion
dialog: that could be straight out of Lifestyles of the Rich and
dialog: Famous.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDEWALK - DUSK
text: Rebecca and Sara stand in the driveway, looking up at the
text: mansion. Sara is in shock.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: This is your home?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: It's my parents house. It was
dialog: never a home.
scene_heading: INT. FOYER - DUSK
text: Rebecca and Sara walk in. Rebecca's on edge, flinching as
text: Sara closes the door.
text: Rebecca's parents rush in from the living room. Her father
text: gives her an awkward hug.
speaker_heading: DAD
speaker_heading: (SURPRISED)
dialog: We didn't think you would make it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 83.
text: Her mother sees the bruises on her face.
speaker_heading: MOM
speaker_heading: (ALARMED)
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Nothing? This isn't nothing.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
speaker_heading: (SNAPS)
dialog: Leave it alone.
text: Sara is stunned. But Rebecca's parents cease. Her mom gives
text: her a tender, protracted embrace. Rebecca endures it, barely
text: raising her arms.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Hello. And you are?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I'm Sara.
text: She puts out her hand, but cuts Rebecca a look. You didn't
dialog: tell them?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Sara's my roommate.
speaker_heading: DAD
speaker_heading: (PLEASED)
dialog: I'm Jeff.
text: Rebecca's mother comes over and unexpectedly embraces Sara.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: It's so great to meet you, Sara.
dialog: I'm Alison.
text: Rebecca grabs Sara by the arm.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Come on, let me show you my room.
scene_heading: INT. REBECCA'S ROOM - DUSK
text: Rebecca slams the door behind them, startling Sara.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: You didn't tell them we were
dialog: coming?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: They didn't need to know.
text: Rebecca plops down on the bed. Sara looks around. It's a
text: typical teenage girl's bedroom. Except, no posters. Just
text: drawings covering the walls. The drawings are of teenage
dialog: girls -- more precisely, they're different drawings of one
text: teenage girl. They're odd, but compelling.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: These are interesting.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Yeah, some of my high school work.
dialog: I haven't gotten around to takin
dialog: them down.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Family and guest sit around a very nice, but not too large
text: dining table. The contents of the house are expensive but
dialog: not pretentious.
text: Rebecca plays with her food, clearly not wanting to engage
text: her parents, who are undaunted. All smiles and warmth.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Rebecca's a pretty great artist.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Yeah, we think Rebecca is so
dialog: talented.
text: Rebecca shakes her head, uncomfortable with the flattery.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: She's an awesome roommate, too.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: (looks at his daughter,
speaker_heading: POINTEDLY)
dialog: That's nice to hear and I'm sure
dialog: she likes you because she never
dialog: brings anyone home before.
text: Rebecca stares at her father.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Dad!
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What? As a parent you worry. You
dialog: protect your daughter all her life
text: and then she goes off to college
dialog: and she's on her own. I'm just
dialog: relieved she got a good roommate.
text: Sara cuts discreet looks around the table. Who are these
dialog: people?
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: Sara, I'll make up a room for you --
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: She'll stay in my room.
text: Sara turns to Rebecca, confused but willing to go along.
scene_heading: INT. REBECCA'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Sara and Rebecca are getting ready to sleep. Sara has made a
text: makeshift bed in the middle of the floor.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: We can share the bed if you want.
text: Sara looks down at her own "bed" and takes a glance at the
text: walls. On the floor, she's going to be surrounded by the
text: drawings of Rebecca looking at her.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Sure.
text: Sara climbs into bed with Rebecca. They lay back to back.
text: Rebecca turns the lamp off next to the bed.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Thanks for coming.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Next Thanksgiving, you can run
dialog: interference with my family.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Done.
text: Sara closes her eyes. It's silent. Rebecca turns over. A
text: beat. She opens her eyes -- just inches from Sara. She ever
text: so slowly raises her hand and gently strokes Sara's hair.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 86.
text: Sara opens her eyes for a second. Not sure if she felt
text: something. She closes them again.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Jeff walks from the stairs into the pitch black kitchen. He's
dialog: lived here long enough to know his way in the dark.
speaker_heading: KITCHEN
text: Jeff opens the fridge. The soft light barely illuminates
text: Rebecca, sitting stoically at the table behind her father.
text: Jeff jumps. He recovers, standing by the open fridge.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Becs. You scared me.
text: Rebecca, glass of milk in her hand, gives her father a dirty
dialog: look. We know how much she hates nicknames.
scene_heading: INT. REBECCA'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Sara wakes up alone in bed. She can hear soft voices from
text: downstairs. She climbs out of bed and walks to the door.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT
text: Sara stands at the top of the stairs. She walks down them and
text: to the kitchen doorway. She peeks inside to see...
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Rebecca and her father sitting at the table. Just the
text: moonlight through the window falling over them. Spooky.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: How're you doing?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Fine. My grades are good.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: That's not what I meant.
text: She looks down at the table.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I'm making friends.
text: Jeff, very subtly, cringes. A long beat.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Rebecca, look at me for a second.
text: Now she looks at him.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Your mother and I are very fond of
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I know.
text: He doesn't know what else to say.
text: Outside Sara sees the framed photos on the wall.
text: Each features Rebecca's parents in some exotic locale: On the
text: beach... on the ski slopes... on a cruise ship. They smile
text: happily at the camera. Rebecca isn't in a single picture.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I just wanted to make sure. Good
dialog: night, I'm heading back to bed.
text: He rises. Sara turns and walks up the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT DOOR - DAY
text: Sara waits by the front door. Alison walks in.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: Hi Sara.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Hi. Rebecca's going to show me some
text: of her high school hangouts.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: Wonderful.
text: Alison peers up the stairs.
speaker_heading: ALISON
text: Rebecca seems to be doing well.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Uhhh, yeah. I think she is.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: Is she taking her medication?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Medication?
text: Alison turns to see... her daughter at the top of the stairs.
text: Did she hear them? She walks down.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: Hey sweetheart.
text: She kisses her on the cheek. Rebecca is annoyed.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
speaker_heading: (TO SARA)
dialog: Ready?
text: Sara nods, but she's still reeling from Alison's words.
text: Medication? She looks back, but Alison waves cheerfully.
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: Have a great time, you two.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY
text: It's an affluent but quaint little town's main street.
text: Rebecca and Sara stroll down the sidewalk. Sara cuts
text: discreet, sideways glances at Rebecca.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Is everything okay?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Yeah. It's just...
dialog: She wants to ask her about that medication.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Nice to see where you come from.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
speaker_heading: (EMBARRASSED)
dialog: Come on.
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP DAY
text: Sara and Rebecca are in line for their drinks. The TEENAGE
text: CASHIER takes their money... but keeps staring at Rebecca.
text: She doesn't pay any attention to him. Sara takes her coffee.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Thanks.
text: The cashier stares at her, as if trying to figure Sara out.
dialog: What's she doing with Rebecca?
text: The girls sit at a table. The cashier and BARISTA keep
text: glancing over, whispering to each other. Rebecca shoots them
text: a look. Like a warning. They quiet. Start doing busy work.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
speaker_heading: (TO SARA)
dialog: I used to come here like every day
dialog: after school.
text: The door opens. THREE GIRLS walk in, laughing and chatting.
text: One BRUNETTE spots Rebecca and stops dead in her tracks.
text: Sara recognizes her. It's MARIA, the girl from Rebecca's
dialog: Facebook, and the subject of all those wall sketches.
text: The chatting girls all fall silent.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: You know them?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: They went to my high school.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Friends?
text: Rebecca doesn't answer her. She's focused on making eye
text: contact with the Brunette.
text: The girls linger by the door, whispering among themselves.
text: Finally, the Brunette sits down at a table by the entrance.
text: As far away from Rebecca's and Sara's table as possible.
text: The other two girls walk to the counter. They sneak glances
text: at Rebecca as they order their drinks.
text: Sara looks back and forth between Rebecca and the girls.
text: Rebecca doesn't waver. She keeps staring at the Brunette.
text: Suddenly, Rebecca gets up.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Let's leave.
text: Rebecca walks towards the door. Sara, confused, gathers her
text: things and gets up. Rebecca stops at the Brunette's table.
text: The Brunette sits there, like a deer caught in headlights.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Hello, Maria.
speaker_heading: MARIA
speaker_heading: (WARY)
dialog: Hello.
text: The other girls walk over. Rebecca, unfazed, looks them over,
text: sending shivers down their spines. They want to back up their
text: friend, but they look as scared as she does. Sara watches all
text: this from a few feet away.
text: Rebecca suddenly turns cheerful.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Oh, I wanted to introduce you to
dialog: Sara. My roommate.
text: Sara gives a small wave to Maria, who looks her over. Almost
text: as if she feels sorry for her.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Hi.
text: Rebecca keeps eyeing Maria, a superior grin on her face. An
text: awkward beat. Everyone's tense. Sara clears her throat.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Well, we better go.
text: Rebecca snaps out of it. Nods. They start to walk out. But as
text: they open the door...
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Rebecca.
text: Everyone turns to Maria. She looks Rebecca in the eye.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: We were never friends.
text: Rebecca stares at her, grinding her teeth. The tension
text: building. Maria doesn't back down, though. She needed to say
text: this. Sara grabs Rebecca's shoulder, gently.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Come on, let's go.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAY: DRIVING
text: Headed back to school. Sara looks out the window. Lost in
dialog: thought.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I guess college is a fresh start
dialog: for both of us.
text: Rebecca doesn't look at her. Just a hint of acknowledgement
text: on her face.
text: Sara's phone buzzes. This gets Rebecca's attention. Sara
text: looks at the text message she just received from Irene:
dialog: "back in LA. lemme know abt movin in."
speaker_heading: SARA
text: Irene's back in town.
text: Sara types and sends a text back. Rebecca watches her.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPUS QUAD - DAY
text: Sara's running through the quad.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. DORM - DAY
text: Sara, coming in from a run, times it perfectly, sneaking in
text: the front door as a student walks out. She bypasses the
text: elevator, heading straight to the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY
text: She bursts out the door and into the hallway.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - DAY
text: She walks in, still a bit out of breath. Rebecca is packing
text: her back-pack.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (not looking up)
dialog: Good run?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: (between deep breaths)
dialog: Great. You wanna go get dinner?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I'm going to the art studio.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Oh. Okay. Catch you later then.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Don't wait up, Sara...
speaker_heading: (GRINS)
dialog: I feel inspired.
text: She's out the door. Sara notices that Rebecca left her
text: sketchpad behind on her bed. She eyes it for a beat. Looks at
text: the closed door.
text: As she steps toward the sketchpad... Rebecca charges back in.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Forgot my pad.
text: She snags it from her bed and leaves. Sara eyes Rebecca's
text: dresser. But first... She walks to the door and opens it.
scene_heading: INT. DORM HALLWAY
text: Sara peeks her head out and looks down both sides of the
text: empty hallway. She hears the elevator ding.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM
text: Sara heads straight for Rebecca's dresser. A beat. Is she
text: really going to do this? Yes. She slides open the top drawer:
text: Supplies. The second drawer: sketchpads. She leafs through
dialog: them: Empty.
text: She searches the third drawer: Sweaters. She feels around
text: beneath them. Wait a minute. She pulls out:
text: Two bottles of prescription medicine. "LITHIUM... For APD."
text: Both bottles are full of pills. As Sara stares at them...
text: A HAND TAPS HER SHOULDER.
text: She leaps out of her socks. But it's just Stephen.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Your door was open.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Oh my God.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Sorry.
text: Sara grabs him and gives him a long hug. Stephen holds her
text: tight and speaks, muffled by her neck.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: What are those?
text: A beat. Should she bring him into this?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: That's what I intend to find out.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT
text: Rebecca is standing up, back pack around her shoulder, her
text: drawing pad in her other hand. Her arm is wrapped around a
text: pole for balance. She stares out the window. No emotion. She
text: looks like she's staring at her own reflection. The train
text: comes to a halt. Riders shuffle around.
text: Rebecca sees a seat open up and sits down. She opens her
text: drawing pad and starts on a blank piece of paper. She looks
text: up and we see what she's been staring at:
dialog: Irene.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT
text: Sara and Stephen stand at Sara's desk, over her computer.
text: Sara googles "Lithium and APD", and clicks on an entry.
speaker_heading: SARA
speaker_heading: (READING)
dialog: APD -- anti-social personality
dialog: disorder. Also known as sociopathy.
text: They look at each other.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Jesus. I thought she was just
dialog: weird.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: It says lithium can control the
dialog: condition.
dialog: (nodding at the bottles)
dialog: Maybe these are refills. Maybe
dialog: she's been taking it all along.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
text: Certainly doesn't seem like she's
dialog: been taking them.
text: He's right and she knows it. A beat.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I think it's time I moved in with
dialog: Irene.
scene_heading: INT. NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT
text: A stylish, hip night club. A sophisticated crowd. Irene and
text: three FRIENDS sit in the lounge section, sipping exotic
text: martinis and watching the dance floor.
text: And on that dance floor one particular woman dances by
text: herself, lost in the music, oblivious to everything around
text: her. She turns as she dances and we see that it's Rebecca.
text: Irene gets up and heads towards the bathroom. As she winds
text: her away around the borders of the dance floor, she notices
text: Rebecca. She pauses to watch her. THEIR EYES MEET FOR MORE
text: THAN AN INSTANT, IRENE SMILES AND WALKS AWAY. REBECCA CLOCKS
dialog: IT, WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?
scene_heading: INT. NIGHT CLUB - BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Irene stands at the mirror, fixing her make-up. The door
text: opens and closes. She glances over to see Rebecca walking in.
text: Rebecca steps to the sink, just a few feet down from Irene.
text: She's out of breath, a sexy sheen of sweat on her arms.
text: Irene breaks out a tube of lip gloss. Rebecca is watching her
text: in the mirror, and Irene knows it. She applies the gloss and
text: smiles at the little kick it gives her. Her eyes find
text: Rebecca's in the mirror.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: I'm sorry to stare, but you are so
dialog: beautiful.
speaker_heading: REBECCA SMILES
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Thanks. So are you. Great lips.
dialog: What kind is it?
speaker_heading: IRENE
text: It's cinnamon. Caffeinated. A girl
dialog: never knows how late she's gonna
dialog: party.
text: Rebecca smiles. A beat.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Can I try it?
text: Irene hands her the lip gloss... Rebecca takes her hand and
text: pulls her close. She kisses Irene full on the lips.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: You're right... cinnamon.
text: Irene smiles.
text: This room's heating up fast. Irene's eyes meet Rebecca's.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Why don't we get out of here. I'd
dialog: invite you to my place, but I have
text: a roommate.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: As luck would have it, I'm only two
text: blocks away and...no roommate.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What are we waiting for?
scene_heading: INT. IRENE'S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: An alarm clock buzzes with no effect to Irene who is dead to
text: the world. She grunts and finally opens her eyes. She wipes
text: the sleep from her eyes, she looks around confused, looks to
text: the empty side of her bed where someone had obviously spent
text: the night. Irene sits up and turns off the alarm..
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Shit.
text: She looks at an empty glass on her bedside table.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. IRENE'S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Irene get's up with the empty glass in her hand. She
text: stumbles out into the...
text: HALLWAY.
text: She staggers to keep her balance on her way to the kitchen.
text: We stay in the hallway as Irene enters in the kitchen and
text: switches on the light.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 96.
text: We can see her shadow in the hallway and hear Irene fill her
text: glass. It's quiet for a moment. She drinks. She fills the
text: glass again.
text: Irene comes back into the hallway with glass in hand. She
text: switches off the light in the kitchen. But as she starts to
dialog: go back to her room ...WHAM!!
text: Rebecca charges out of nowhere and crashes into Irene.
text: CLOSE UP: GLASS EXPLODES ON THE FLOOR
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET - MORNING
text: Sara is going for a run through the city. She stops at an old
text: art deco apartment building.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY - MORNING
text: Sara spots Irene's name on the buzzer and calls up. No
dialog: answer.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - MORNING
text: She walks out the door. Looks around. And takes off running
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DORM HALLWAY - MORNING
text: Sara, hands on hips, walks down the hallway and opens the
dialog: door.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - MORNING
text: She finds Rebecca, sitting on her bed. Drawing. She lights up
text: when she sees Sara.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Hey yourself. Where were you all
dialog: night?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Oh, I got inspired. I just lost
dialog: track of time.
text: Sara pulls off her sweaty top and throws it in the hamper,
text: grabbing a towel. She's wearing a sportsbra, revealing her
text: tattoo. Sara grabs a robe.
text: A beat. She's nervous, but she needs to do this. Time for the
text: "big talk." She sits on her bed and faces Rebecca.
speaker_heading: SARA
speaker_heading: REBECCA --
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I want a tattoo.
speaker_heading: (SARA'S SHOCKED)
dialog: Will you come with me?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Uhhh...
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Please. It would mean a lot to me.
dialog: I won't be able to do it without
dialog: you.
text: Sara looks into her plaintive eyes. So much want in them.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Um... sure. Okay.
scene_heading: INT. TATTOO PARLOR - DAY
text: The girls walk along the wall, checking out the samples.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: You can't rush this, Rebecca. We
dialog: can always come back.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I know what I want.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Okay. I'm out here if you need me.
text: Sara sits down as the TATTOO ARTIST escorts Rebecca upstairs.
text: She looks giddy and nervous. Sara waves. When she's gone,
text: Sara takes out her phone and texts Irene.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 98.
scene_heading: INT. TATTOO PARLOR - LATER
text: Sara, bored, leafs through a tattoo magazine for the 100th
text: time. Her phone buzzes. A response from Irene:
dialog: "outta town for a gig. will call when back ; )"
text: Sara's relieved.
speaker_heading: STAIRS
text: Rebecca walks slowly down the stairs. Wincing in pain. Sara
text: puts the phone back in her pocket and stands up.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Let's see it.
text: Rebecca pulls down the collar of her shirt to reveal, just
text: under her collarbone:
speaker_heading: "EMILY"
text: Sara, stunned speechless, starts backing away from her.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
speaker_heading: (SWEETLY)
dialog: Think of me as your sister.
text: Rebecca is oblivious to the rage building in Sara.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: If you want... you can call me
dialog: Emily.
text: Sara clenches her fists. She's shaking with rage. She moves
text: toward Rebecca, whose grin fades.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What's the matter?
text: Sara steps up to her, inches away, ready to beat the shit out
text: of her. And Rebecca can't believe it. She's that far gone.
text: Her eyes search Sara's for an answer.
text: Sara abruptly turns and walks out the door. Rebecca watches
text: her leave through the front window. Sara never looks back.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 99.
scene_heading: INT. DORM LOBBY - DAY
text: The elevator doors open. Sara, emotionally exhausted, steps
text: out, carrying a box of her things. Stephen waits by the door.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: This is all you're taking?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I'll get the rest of my things when
text: Irene comes back to town.
text: He takes the box. Then notices --
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Where's your necklace?
text: She instinctively rubs the base of her neck.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I can't find it. It's okay.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Sara...
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I'm not going back up there.
text: He hands her the box. Time to man up.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Wait here. I'll go look for it.
text: She kisses him tenderly, unbelievably appreciative.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: Sara walks out to the cab. Pauses. She's tempted to look back
text: at her dorm room window... but she doesn't.
text: Good thing, too. Rebecca sits on the ledge, looking down.
text: Her face is blank. Not hurt, not angry -- completely blank.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - DAY
text: Rebecca still sits at the window. She holds her camera up,
text: taking a picture down below. She turns as Stephen enters.
text: She puts the camera down.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Have you seen Sara's necklace?
text: Rebecca solemnly shakes her head. He looks around the
text: dresser. In the drawers. Flips over Sara's pillow. Rebecca
text: watches him.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What did I do?
text: He stops searching. Looks at her.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: She just needs to move on.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: With you?
text: He doesn't answer. He keeps searching... but he can feel
text: Rebecca's eyes on him now. Creepy. He gives up.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: If you do find it, can you let me
dialog: know?
text: Instead of answering, Rebecca raises her camera and takes his
text: picture. Stephen stares at her, unnerved. He finally snaps
text: out of it and walks out the door.
text: She watches him go.
scene_heading: INT. FRAT HOUSE - ROOM - DAY
text: Sara is cleaning, trying to make a dent in a world-class
text: mess. She doesn't mind -- a big weight's off her shoulders.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: You should call someone. The dean's
dialog: office. Or at least your R.A.
text: She keeps cleaning.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: And tell them what? What has she
dialog: really done to me? No one can do
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: It's the weirdest thing, Stephen.
text: The girl's own parents are afraid
dialog: of her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Well, she sure scared the shit out
dialog: of me.
text: Sara really wants to change the subject. She holds up two of
text: his t-shirts.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Are these dirty or clean?
text: Stephen sniffs the shirts.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
text: Somewhere in between.
text: She throws the t-shirts at him.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPUS QUADS - DAY
text: Sara heads to class, walking faster than usual. Bumping into
text: people as she looks around, making sure she'll spot Rebecca
text: before Rebecca spots her.
text: She makes it to the front door of the building. She looks
text: back at the quads.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT
text: Sara locks the front door and heads back home.
text: She walks down an empty quad. She slows at the sight of...
text: Rebecca. Walking directly towards her from the other end of
dialog: the quad.
text: No one else is in sight. Sara thinks about veering off to the
text: side. No. She can do this. She walks straight ahead. Rebecca
text: keeps her pace; hooded sweater up, looking down at the
text: pavement, listening to her Walkman.
text: Sara takes a deep breath as they get closer to each other,
text: preparing herself for the confrontation. Ten feet away now.
dialog: Five...
text: But Rebecca passes her without looking. Sara walks a little
text: further and turns around.
text: Rebecca keeps walking. Did she even see her?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 102.
scene_heading: EXT. FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Sara hurries up the stairs to the fraternity house.
scene_heading: INT. FRAT HOUSE - ENTRANCE - NIGHT
text: Sara reaches Psi U. and closes the door behind her. She looks
text: around at the messy first floor. At the PACK OF GUYS in the
text: living room, yelling at the hoops game on TV.
text: Sara smiles. She's safe.
scene_heading: INT. ART STUDIO - NIGHT
text: Rebecca is alone, with just a crack of light coming from the
text: open door to the hallway. She's sketching, still wearing her
text: Walkman. Hundreds of sheets of paper are scattered around the
text: floor, but we can't see what she's drawing.
scene_heading: INT. FRAT HOUSE ROOM
text: Sara is trying to study at a cramped desk but the music from
text: outside the room is too loud. Stephen is on the bed,
text: reading. He's used to it. She hears a loud commotion from
text: the hallway. Frustrated, she gets up.
scene_heading: INT. FRAT HOUSE - HALLWAY
text: It's a couple of guys playing nerf basketball.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Seriously. Is it a game to be as
dialog: loud as you possibly can?
text: She waves her arms like a crazy person.
speaker_heading: SARA (CONT'D)
dialog: How many walls can you possibly
dialog: bump into!?
text: They just return blank stares. She slams the door shut.
scene_heading: INT. FRAT HOUSE - ROOM - NIGHT
text: Sara tries to study while the fraternity brothers continue to
text: shout down the hall. Stephen eyes her warily. Her cellphone
text: rings. She pulls it out of the purse: Jason.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 103.
text: She hesitates... and now stuffs the phone back in her bag as
text: she gets up from the table.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Hey, I'm going to hit the library.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
speaker_heading: (GETTING UP)
dialog: I can walk you there.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: No, it's okay.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Party starts at ten. Really cool
dialog: band...
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I hear the drummer's really hot.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: He may be, but I'm sleeping with
dialog: his girlfriend...
text: She kisses him.
scene_heading: EXT. DORM - EVENING - NIGHT
text: JASON, a handsome all-American Midwestern kid, stands in
text: front of Sara's dorm. He's talking into his cell phone.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: Sara. I'm actually... I'm in front
dialog: of your dorm. I just flew in. I'm
text: at the Roosevelt Hotel, room 210.
dialog: Call me, okay?
text: He hangs up. Some students leave the dorm and he grabs the
text: door before it closes.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - DUSK
text: Rebecca kneels down in front of her dresser. Opens the bottom
text: drawer. Her sweaters. She fishes underneath them. Pulls out
text: her lithium pills. But just looks at them. Anger in her eyes.
text: She puts the bottle back.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 104.
scene_heading: INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Jason walks through the hallway, checking the numbers on the
text: doors. He stops in front of Sara's room. Knocks lightly on
text: the door. No answer. Knocks again.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT
text: Rebecca sits back into Sara's chair, staring at the door,
text: ignoring the knocks. Almost catatonic.
text: Her right hand slowly drags a utility knife over the armrest,
text: shredding it to pieces.
scene_heading: INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Jason writes a note. He folds it and slides it under the
text: door. He hesitates for a second, hoping this is the right
text: thing to do, then walks back down the hallway towards the
dialog: elevator.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT
text: Rebecca stares at the note for a moment. She walks to the
text: door, picks it up and begins to read Jason's note.
speaker_heading: SARA -
dialog: I know you won't take my calls, but I'm here and I just want
dialog: to see you. I'm at The Roosevelt Hotel, Room 210, until...
dialog: however long it takes. Please.
dialog: Love,
speaker_heading: JASON
text: Rebecca crumples up the paper and throws it in the trash.
scene_heading: INT. DORM - SHOWER - NIGHT
text: Rebecca lets the water soak her. Eyes open. She runs her
text: fingers through her now long dark brown hair. Black water
text: trickles down her legs and puddles near the drain.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 105.
scene_heading: INT. DORM BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Rebecca stands naked in front of the mirror, staring at her
text: reflection. She then digs into her bag and pulls out a long
text: pair of shears. Her "Emily" tattoo is starting to heal. She
text: gently traces the letters with the sharp tips of the shears,
text: still looking at it in the mirror.
text: She lifts the shears and starts cutting her hair shorter.
text: Just above her shoulders.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT
text: Rebecca walks over to Sara's closet. She opens it and thumbs
text: through some of the clothes that Sara left behind. She pulls
text: out a dress. Holds it in front of herself as she stands in
text: front of the mirror. Nice -- but something's missing.
text: Rebecca goes to her drawer and pulls out Sara's silver chain.
text: Which she caresses in her hand.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT
text: Sara's kicked her feet on the table, reading a book.
text: Enjoying the silence.
scene_heading: INT. FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT
text: A raucous party in full swing. Stephen's band has just
text: finished playing and he's walking off the cheap stage. A HOT
text: GIRL smiles at him.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Help me find the keg?
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Sure, I have to go look for my
dialog: girlfriend anyway.
text: She walks away. "Jerk". He grins... and now checks his watch.
dialog: Where's Sara?
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: The elevator door opens, revealing Rebecca. Or is it Sara?
text: The hair. The dress. The tattoo. Rebecca looks just like her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 106.
text: As she steps into the hallway, she gently fingers the
text: necklace. She walks along, looking at the room numbers.
text: She stops in front of a room. She's about to knock... but she
text: sees a housekeeping cart a few doors down, in front of an
text: open room.
text: She walks to the cart. She peeks inside the room... and now
text: plucks the master key card off the cart.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Jason, shirtless, sleeps on his stomach in bed.
text: The front door clicks and slowly creaks open just enough for
text: a silhouette of a woman to appear. She closes the door. Jason
text: barely acknowledges the noise in his sleep.
text: Rebecca walks to the bed in the soft moonlight. She stares
text: down at Jason. She slips off her dress, which falls to the
text: floor. She's in just bra and panties now.
text: She climbs onto the bed beside Jason. He starts awake.
speaker_heading: JASON
speaker_heading: WHA--
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Shhhh.
text: She crawls onto him, not letting him turn over. She starts
text: kissing the back of his neck.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: Sara?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: You got my voicemail.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
text: Mm-hmmm.
text: Kissing his back now, moving lower.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: Oh, man, Sara. Oh, that feels good.
text: She works her way back up to his ear.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
speaker_heading: (WHISPERING)
dialog: Turn over.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 107.
text: Did that sound like Sara? But as Jason turns over, he sees...
text: The hair. The necklace. That unmistakable "Emily" tattoo.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
speaker_heading: (WHISPERING)
dialog: Close your eyes.
text: He does. She reaches beneath the blanket, and does what she
text: needs to. She settles onto him. And now starts to move.
text: And as she moves we go behind her and see, shining in the low
text: light, the utility knife beneath her bra strap. Flat against
text: the skin of her back.
text: Jason lies still, eyes clenched shut.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: I love you, Sara.
text: She lets him have one, two, three seconds of heaven. Her
text: hands reach behind her and ease out the utility knife.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: But she doesn't love you.
text: Jason's eyes fly open. That wasn't Sara's voice. And those
text: aren't Sara's eyes boring into his.
text: Rebecca leans down, her face to his. Jason's eyes widen in
text: shock, horror, and now pain as her unseen hands drive the
text: knife deep into his gut. He gasps.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: You hurt her.
text: She kisses him -- the last thing he'll ever feel. He
text: shudders, trembles, and lies still, eyes open.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT
text: Sara's still reading. A hand touches her shoulder. She jumps,
text: but it's just the LIBRARIAN.
speaker_heading: LIBRARIAN
dialog: We're about to close.
text: Sara can't believe it's so late. She puts her things away.
text: Grabs her phone to check the time, distracted by the "1 new
text: voicemail" message. She's about to press the voicemail
dialog: button...
text: But a text comes in from Irene:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 108.
dialog: "Im back. Get your butt over here, I've got another surprise
dialog: for you."
scene_heading: INT. FRATHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Stephen walks around, beer-less, searching the crowd for
text: Sara. He checks his watch. Pats his pocket -- no cell phone.
text: He heads up the stairs and into his room.
scene_heading: INT. FRAT BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Stephen picks his phone off the dresser. Sees he has a new
text: voicemail from Sara. He plays the message
speaker_heading: SARA (V.0.)
dialog: Hi Stephen, it's me. I'm stopping
dialog: by Irene's, come on by. I want you
dialog: guys to meet ...it's on 524 South
dialog: Grand, Apt. 708. Love you.
text: He groans. A sharp knock, and the bedroom door opens.
speaker_heading: FRAT BOY
text: All hands on deck -- the keg's
text: still alive.
scene_heading: EXT. IRENE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Sara comes fast-paced down the sidewalk. She enters Irene's

scene_heading: INT. IRENE'S ELEVATOR
text: Sara rides up the elevator.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY / DOORWAY
text: Sara walks to the door of Irene's apartment. It's open but
text: there's not a sound. No music, no cocktail chatter.
text: She checks the apartment number again. It's the right one.
text: She knocks lightly. No answer.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Irene?
scene_heading: INT. IRENE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Sara steps into the foyer.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 109.
text: She walks down the long entryway into a newly-renovated
text: living room. Dark and empty. Sara's starting to feel uneasy.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Irene?
text: There's a bedroom dead ahead. Warm light pours out. She
text: slowly walks to the open door... looks in... and freezes.
text: CLOSE ON SARA'S EYES. Horror-stricken by what she sees.
text: The bedroom is dark, except for the single lamp, above...
text: Irene. She lies on the bed, each of her wrists cuffed to a
text: bedpost. A red Hermes scarf is stuffed in her mouth.
text: Sara can't move. She stares at Irene in shock.
speaker_heading: SARA
speaker_heading: (WHISPERING)
dialog: Irene.
text: Irene mumbles, her eyes wide open in terror. As Sara starts
dialog: toward Irene...
speaker_heading: REBECCA (O.S.)
dialog: Some role model she turned out to
dialog: be. Couldn't even take care of
dialog: herself.
text: Rebecca steps out of the darkness, a gun in her hand. Sara
text: drops her phone on the floor.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Rebecca!
text: Rebecca holds the gun steady on Sara.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Sit down and shut up.
text: Sara lowers herself into a black chair, her eyes on Irene.
text: Rebecca picks up Sara's cell phone.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Listen to me. All I ever wanted
dialog: was to be your friend.
text: A beat. Sara knows she has to play this just right.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Rebecca, you are my friend.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: No. Shut up. We're not friends.
dialog: We're here because you betrayed me.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Rebecca, I'm sorry--
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Stop it. Stop saying things you
dialog: don't mean. I protected you.
dialog: From that whore Tracy and that
dialog: nasty little kitten... and That

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Even that loser ex-boyfriend of

speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: What're you talking about? What'd
dialog: you do to them? What'd you do to
dialog: Jason?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I got rid of them all. And how do
dialog: you repay me? By leaving me.
text: Sara sinks out of the chair onto her knees in astonishment.
text: She looks at Irene.
text: Sara digs deep... lifts up her face... and looks Rebecca in
text: the eye. She puts everything she has into this.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Rebecca, please forgive me.
text: A long beat. Rebecca's face lights up.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Now we can start all over again.
dialog: Let's make things the way they
dialog: were, Sara. That first day. Just
dialog: the two of us.
text: Sara sees Rebecca start to twist a garbage bag in her hands.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Rebecca...
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: After all... you can only have one
dialog: best friend.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: No! Don't!
text: Rebecca whips the bag around Irene's head. Irene starts to
text: buck and thrash. But it doesn't help her...
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Lay still bitch.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Please. Don't do this...
text: Sara stands. She stares at Irene. She can't watch her die.
text: She walks toward the bed, ignoring Rebecca's gun.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Stop! I mean it.
text: Rebecca raises the gun to Sara's face but Sara keeps coming.
text: Rebecca realizes she can't stop Sara. She cracks Sara across
text: the temple with the gun-butt, knocking her to the floor.
text: She kneels down beside Sara. Worried... clearing the hair
text: from Sara's face.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
speaker_heading: (GENTLE)
dialog: Shh... I'm so sorry.
text: Sara backhands her, knocking the gun out of her hand. It
text: skitters across the floor and out the door into the living
dialog: room.
text: Sara stands up first and dives for the bed, but Rebecca grabs
text: Sara by the neck and rips her off the bed. She puts her in a
dialog: chokehold.
text: Sara backs Rebecca into the wall, trying to loosen the
text: chokehold. She slams her back against the wall. And again.
text: Sara smashes her elbow into Rebecca's jaw, breaking her grip.
text: She heads for the door, but Rebecca trips her. As Sara
dialog: rises...
text: Rebecca knees her in her stomach, knocking the wind out of
text: her. As Sara gasps for breath...
text: Rebecca races out into the living room for the gun.
text: Sara gets up quickly and slams the door shut and locks it.
text: Rebecca turns around and goes for the door.
dialog: 
dialog:

text: She nods her head and Sara sees the phone on the bed table.
dialog: She rushes for it. No good the wire is cut!
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Shit!
speaker_heading: IRENE
text: The window! There's a fire escape.
dialog: You can reach it.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
text: Rebecca looks around for the gun. Throwing chairs and
text: furniture around. She finds it.
text: Picks the gun off the floor.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Sara races to the window and throws it open. There's just an
text: empty street below. She eyes the fire escape. A nearly
text: impossible leap away. But Sara's out of options.

dialog: 113.
scene_heading: EXT. BUILDING LEDGE - NIGHT
text: Sara takes a tentative step out onto the slim ledge. Her foot
text: hits a flowerpot, which plummets ten stories... and smashes
text: to pieces in the alley. Sara shuts her eyes.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Rebecca, back at the bedroom door, raises the gun and fires.
speaker_heading: BLAM!
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM
text: The door shatters, and the bullet continues straight ahead
text: and tears a pillow open, just beside Irene's head. Feathers
text: go flying. Irene screams.
text: Rebecca kicks the door open and steps in, gun in hand.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I know you're scared, Sara. But I
dialog: promise, everything is gonna be
dialog: okay.
text: She stops short at the sight of...Sara on the ledge.
text: Rebecca turns and stares at Irene. Fresh panic rising in
text: Irene's eyes.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Sorry, Irene. But she's my friend,
dialog: not yours.
text: She raises the gun at the helpless Irene...
text: But out of nowhere STEPHEN, RUSHING UP FROM BEHIND, knocks
text: her arm. The gun fires wildly, one bullet...
scene_heading: EXT. BUILDING LEDGE - NIGHT
text: Exploding through the window, shattering it and startling
text: Sara, who loses her balance and slips off the ledge. She
text: grabs on by her fingertips, her face hitting the brick wall.
speaker_heading: SARA
speaker_heading: (CRYING)
dialog: Ohgodohgodohgod.
text: The more she screams, the more she loses her grip.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 114.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Rebecca fires another shot, hitting a giant bedroom mirror,
text: shattering it's reflection of Rebecca's struggle with
dialog: Stephen.
text: Rebecca slams her head into his lip, knocking him backward.
text: He keeps hold of her, and they hit the floor, the gun flying
text: out of Rebecca's hand.
text: Stephen gets on top. He lifts his arm high and balls his fist
text: before he puts it right in her face full throttle, knocking
text: her out cold.
text: He quickly takes the gun and puts it inside his belt as he
text: races for the window.
speaker_heading: SARA (O.S.)
speaker_heading: (SCREAMING)
dialog: Stephen! Help!
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Hurry!!
text: He sees Sara dangling outside and reaches for her.
scene_heading: EXT. BUILDING LEDGE - SAME
text: Sara's crying, barely mouthing Stephen's name. He grabs her
text: arms. Leaning halfway outside, he starts to pull her up.
text: Part of the way up, he holds her against his chest and lets
text: her cry. He smiles.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Okay I've got you. Everything is
dialog: gonna be okay!
text: He pulls her halfway in the window...
text: But a shadow rises behind him.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: STEPHEN!!!!
text: A loud unpleasant sound. THUD! Irene screams.
text: Then Stephen stiffens, his body straightening in shock.
text: Something's wrong. And now Sara stares in horror as...
text: Blood runs down his face. He looks into Sara's eyes... and
text: lets go of her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 115.
text: She falls, but manages to hook onto the ledge as Stephen
text: disappears from the window frame. Using the brick wall for
text: leverage, she arduously lifts herself up into the window in
dialog: time to see...
text: Stephen, glassy-eyed, backing away from the window. He slumps
text: to the floor, revealing:
text: Rebecca. She's a crazed mess, hair and eyes wild.
text: Rebecca drops the bloody fireplace poker and rushes to the
text: window. She helps Sara in. They tumble onto the floor.
text: Sara tosses Rebecca to the side and rushes over to Stephen.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Stephen.
text: Stephen is out. She sees the gun in his belt. She pulls it
text: out, spins, and levels it at Rebecca. The gun shakes
text: violently in her hand.
text: Rebecca stands and walks calmly towards Sara, who is still on
dialog: the floor.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: You won't do it. We're fr--
text: Sara pulls the trigger. Click. Rebecca stares in shock.
text: Click. Click. Click. Click. Sara closes her eyes in
text: frustration. She drops the gun.
text: Tears stream down Rebecca's face. She can't believe Sara
text: pulled that trigger. But as if flipping a switch...
text: Rebecca's sadness turns to rage. She balls her fists, her
text: knuckles white, and...
text: CHARGES at Sara full force, slamming her against the wall.
text: She tosses her like a ragdoll across the room, where...
text: Sara's head slams the nightstand, knocking the contents of
text: Rebecca's purse everywhere.
text: Rebecca wipes the tears from her eyes. It hurts her to hurt
dialog: Sara.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
text: Friends help each other. They take
dialog: care of each other.
text: Sara, dazed and weak, stares at Rebecca.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Rebecca. We were never friends.
text: That's the last straw. Rebecca comes hard, murder in her
text: eyes. She grabs Sara around the throat, pulls her up from
text: the floor, and slams her against the wall.
text: She starts choking the life out of her. Sara's face turns
dialog: red. Redder...
text: But suddenly Rebecca's grip loosens. Her eyes stare in shock.
text: Sara pulls Rebecca's hands off her neck with one hand. The
text: utility knife is in her other hand... stuck between Rebecca's
text: shoulder blades.
text: Rebecca falls to the floor, bringing Sara down with her. She
text: won't let go of Sara. As she gasps for air, she sees...
text: Sara's tattoo, visible beneath her torn shirt. Sara self-
text: consciously notices her looking at it. Rebecca reaches out
text: and grabs Sara's hand.
text: Sara lets go of her hand, and removes the necklace from
text: around Rebecca's neck.
text: Irene is trembling in the bed. Too shocked to say anything.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
speaker_heading: (GROANING)
dialog: Sara.
text: She races over to him. He's barely alive.
speaker_heading: SARA
text: Stephen. Hold on.
text: She finds her phone on the floor. She steps back to Stephen
text: and cradles his head in her lap as she dials 911.
text: He looks into her eyes and smiles.
text: She smiles through her tears, love in her eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. BUILDING - DAY
text: It's a warm, spring day. Sara, melancholy but looking in
text: much better shape since the last time we saw her, stands in
text: front of her dorm, looking to restart her college career.
text: She plays with the silver chain once again around her neck.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 117.
text: She opens the front door and walks in. Students milling about
text: look at her. Know who she is. We see Kim and Tracy. They
dialog: don't say anything. Don't know what to say.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM
text: Sara opens the door. The simple room is identical to her
text: previous one. She hesitates at first but then walks in.
text: There is a box marked "SARA" filled with the things she left
text: behind in her old dorm. There's a knock on the open door.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN (O.S.)
dialog: Welcome back.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Hey. How are you feeling?
text: Stephen enters the room.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Better now. You being here's gonna
dialog: help.
text: Sara smiles.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN (CONT'D)
dialog: How's moving in going?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Just got here.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Well let me give you some time to
dialog: get settled in.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Actually, I need you right here,
dialog: right now.

scene_heading: INT. DORM HALLWAY

speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: This isn't exactly what I had in
dialog: mind.
text: Sara grins.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Now I can get settled in.
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: I'll be back to pick you up for
dialog: dinner. You gonna be ready?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Absolutely.
text: Stephen takes off down the hall. Sara follows him with her
text: eyes before she goes back into her room.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM
text: Sara sits down on her bed. She watches the empty space where
text: the other bed used to be. She just stares at it. The camera
text: slowly tracks sideways until we see the side of the bookshelf
text: where unseen by Sara, there's a flyer hung with a picture of
text: Richard Prince's Nurse of Greenmeadow announcing an upcoming
dialog: gallery exhibition.
text: CUT TO BLACK.
