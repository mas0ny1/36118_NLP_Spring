scene_heading: CREDITS SEQUENCE: EXTREME CLOSE-UPS
text: An unfinished mechanical device: a scaffold of thin metal
text: pipes, levers, pulleys, wiring, serve-motors.
text: THOMAS CRAWFORD works on it: in his 40s, well-dressed but in
text: disarray, graying stubble, hair and clothes unkempt.
text: Magnifying glasses distort his eyes, making them huge and
dialog: strange.
text: He sets aside a tool, takes a marble-sized ball-bearing and
text: drops it into a slot at the top of the device.
text: His enlarged eyes follow the metal ball -
text: - as it rolls and flips and spirals through a Rube-Goldberg-
text: style maze, setting off bells, clicking past turnstiles -
text: - then missing a leap and clattering across the work-table.
text: Eyes on the device, Crawford's hand traps the ball.
text: He stays still, analyzing.
text: He selects a tiny screwdriver from a neat array of metal-
text: working and electronics tools. Makes a miniscule adjustment
text: to a single joint. Drops in another ball.
text: It rolls and flips and spirals all the way down.
text: Crawford doesn't react. Just studies the machine.
text: Behind him, on a desk: a framed photograph of a beautiful
text: woman in her mid-30s.
dialog: His wife.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LUXURY BEACH-HOTEL ROOM - THE SAME TIME
text: JENNIFER CRAWFORD is just reaching orgasm -
text: - with ROB NUNALLY: mid-30s, good-looking, aging-boyish.
text: They clutch each other, shuddering, lost in passion. And
text: then, breathing heavily, caressing each other - Nunally rolls
text: off her - slowly coming back to earth.
text: Jennifer studies her lover, a quiet play of relief and
text: gratitude and satisfaction on her face -
text: - darkened by a troubled distance, maybe even fear.
text: She is, after all, having an affair.

scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Crawford stares through the grotesque lenses, motionless,
text: expressionless.
text: He takes a deep breath and checks his watch. Then he stands,
text: removing the glasses.
text: We now see his office: large, austere. Decor and equipment
text: related to aircraft engineering. Outside big windows, jets
text: take off from an industrial airstrip.
text: Crawford gets a brand-new bottle of Jack Daniels from a desk
text: drawer, uncaps it and swigs as he opens the door to a private
dialog: bathroom.
text: He gargles, spits into the sink. He pours out more, then
text: puts the half-empty bottle back on his desk.
text: He collects a home-made device from the workbench: it looks
text: like a PDA connected by wires to a blank credit card.
text: He puts it in the pocket of his suit jacket, which he sets on
text: the desk. Adjusts the placement of the open bottle, nearby.
text: Crawford goes to a light-box, studying a set of large X-rays:
text: dark strips of welding in a grayish fuzz of metal.
text: TINA, his assistant, appears in the doorway.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: The N.T.S.B. guys are here.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: (Doesn't look up)
dialog: Yep.
text: She hesitates a second, glancing at the bottle.
text: Crawford ignores her, pulling an x-ray off the light-box and
dialog: grabbing his jacket -
text: - which knocks over the bottle. It skitters across the desk,
dialog: liquor spilling.
text: Crawford just walks out past Tina.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. AIRPLANE HANGER - SOON AFTER
text: The twisted, torn and burned wreckage of a large private jet
text: is being reassembled on the big empty concrete floor.
dialog: 
dialog: 3
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: N.T.S.B. INVESTIGATORS in shirtsleeves and AIRCRAFT COMPANY
text: EXECUTIVES in suits cluster around work-boards covered with
text: photographs and diagrams of a crash site.
text: They look up, falling silent, as Crawford comes in carrying
text: the X-ray. A few exchange surprised, concerned glances; this
text: is not a man who skips a shave.
text: But when he gets to them, Crawford is laser-like - holding
text: the X-ray and pointing to a spot three inches above it:
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: It's here.
text: He hands a startled Investigator the film and strides off
text: toward the giant open doors out to the airfield.
text: His foot knocks a piece of the carefully-laid-out wreckage in
text: passing; it clatters across the concrete, but Crawford
text: doesn't slow or look back.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LUXURY BEACH-HOTEL ROOM - SOON AFTER
text: Rob is still in the bed, naked under the sheet - watching
text: Jennifer adjust the straps of her bathing suit.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: What about dinner tonight?
text: She looks at him, surprised. Smiles, comes to sit beside
text: him. Gently:
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: We go out to dinner - we might never
dialog: come back.
text: Beat. Rob nods.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Okay.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: I want to wake up with you. I want
dialog: to...
text: He gropes for words, but it's too big and he relents - scales
text: back, sighing:
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: ...at least see where you live.
text: She regards him tenderly, feeling the same reckless yearning.
text: But also fear. She rubs his hair.
dialog: 
dialog: 4
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I live...here.
text: She leans over to kiss him delicately on the lips.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SANTA MONICA STREET - DAY
text: A black Porsche speeds down a quiet street near the beach,
text: pulls into a parking space.
text: Crawford gets out, goes to a pay phone. He puts his cell
text: phone on top of it, drops in some change and dials.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (ON PHONE)
speaker_heading: L.A.P.D.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Lieutenant Nunally, please.
text: He listens to hold music and checks the time.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (ON PHONE)
dialog: He doesn't come on til six. You want
dialog: his voice mail?
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: No. Thank you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'll see him later.
text: He hangs up, grabs his cell, and takes off down the sidewalk.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
text: Crawford enters. He knows where he's going - past the front
dialog: desk and outside to the -
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL POOL - DAY
text: Jennifer swims laps with strong, even strokes. Rob is
text: enjoying the sun in a lounge chair.
text: Crawford eyes them as he passes on the other side of a low
text: fence. Unnoticed, he heads upstairs.
dialog: 
dialog: 5
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Crawford stops at a room with a DO NOT DISTURB sign on the
text: knob. He takes out his PDA-device and slides its card into
text: the key-card slot of the lock.
text: The lock clicks to green.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: Crawford enters, quietly closing the door behind him.
text: He just stands there, taking it all in. The unmade bed, the
text: ripped-open condom packet, the clothes on the floor.
text: He is silent. Very still.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CRAWFORD'S STREET - LATER
text: Jennifer drives her Mercedes convertible past expensive
text: houses in the late-afternoon light.
text: She goes up the driveway of the Crawfords' stark mordern home.
text: Across the street, MR. GIFFORD is playing catch with his
text: GRANDSON. He waves to Jennifer.
text: She waves back, friendly but distracted, on her way to the
text: front door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Cold. Elegant. Metal planters with bamboo trees. Glass
text: doors out to a back garden. A fire in the fireplace.
text: In a corner is another of Crawford's Rube Goldbergs - this
text: one the size of a refrigerator. On a coffee table in the
text: center of the room, a big wooden bowl of ball-bearings.
text: Jennifer hurries in, dropping her keys on a table and -
text: - freezes, startled.
text: Crawford waits in the center of the room; despite the outer
text: "disarray", he is calm and focused.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: You're - home early.
dialog: 
dialog: 6
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: I just felt a sudden urge.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Are you...okay?
text: Crawford shrugs, smiling strangely. He looks pained.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: I could use a hug.
text: Jennifer submits guiltily. Crawford embraces her, tight.
dialog: She waits it out, until:
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Have you been drinking?
text: He lets go and she steps back. Studying him. Scared.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: I've been watching you sleep. At
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (Gently)
dialog: That's creepy.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Sometimes when I'm at work, I'll start
dialog: thinking about you and I'll just get -
text: just - overwhelmed.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Tommy -
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: It's a dense, crushing -
dialog: geophysical force. Like I'm
dialog: pinned. At the core - where things
dialog: change.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You ever get that way about me,
dialog: Jen?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: I'm trying to describe my feelings.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Those don't sound like feelings.
dialog: 
dialog: 7
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: No?
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: What's the sound of one feeling...in a
dialog: forest?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: You think you're so much smarter
dialog: than I am. That must make you feel
dialog: very powerful.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Helpless, actually.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Okay. Maybe it's time to really talk.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: No?
text: He shakes his head. Frayed and worn, she sighs.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Fine. Whatever. I'll make you some
dialog: dinner.
text: He watches her turn and head for the kitchen. To her back:
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: I know. Everything.
text: She stops, exhales. Looking down. Afraid. Grateful it's
text: happening at last.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I'm so sorry.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Don't be. Knowledge is pain. I'm
dialog: used to that.
text: Jennifer winces, feeling some sympathy. Preparing herself to
dialog: turn and end it, to grow, to move on.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: It's not like I don't let little
dialog: pleasures, in return for the pain.
dialog: 
dialog: 8
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She frowns and turns - and her eyes go big with fear.
text: Crawford is holding a semi-automatic pistol, aimed at her
text: face. Very still.
text: The gunshot explodes out of the muzzle - bright, harsh, loud.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GIFFORD HOUSE - FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS
text: Gifford and his Grandson turn to look at the Crawford house.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Crawford stands, tilting his head to watch the slow hypnotic
text: curl of smoke leaking from the gun in his extended hand. The
dialog: hand, we might notice now, wears a surgical glove.
text: He lowers the gun, bends to pick up the ejected shell-casing
text: from the floor. He wipes it and tosses it aside, on his way
dialog: to Jennifer.
text: He stands looking down at her: face-up on the floor, head in
text: a small pool of blood, eyes and mouth open.
text: The doorbell rings.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Gifford leans on the frosted-glass panel next to the door -
text: hands cupped around his eyes, trying to see in.
speaker_heading: GIFFORD
dialog: Tom? Jen? Everything okay in there?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD FOYER - CONTINUOUS
text: Crawford steps in from the living room.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Everybody just LEAVE US ALONE!
text: He calmly aims up at the frosted-glass transom and fires
text: three times - watching Gifford fling himself away.
text: Crawford collects the shell casings, wipes them, drops them
text: back on the floor.
text: Peeling off the rubber gloves, he crosses to the fireplace
text: and throws them into the flames. They curl and blacken.
dialog: 
dialog: 9
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Crawford watches, expressionless - then looks around,
text: satisfied. Waiting.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CRAWFORD'S STREET - DUSK
text: Helicopters overhead, SWAT teams setting up. Nearby houses
text: have been emptied, gawking NEIGHBORS and media vans moved
text: back to a block away.
text: UNIFORM COPS pull aside the barriers as a plain-wrap sedan
text: rolls through. It pulls up by the SWAT Command Truck.
text: ROB NUNALLY gets out, surveying the scene. The guy who spent
text: his afternoon with Jennifer Crawford in the hotel is an
dialog: L.A.P.D. Detective.
speaker_heading: SWAT COMMANDER
dialog: You the Negotiator?
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: Yeah. What do we know?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - SOON AFTER
text: Crawford waits, with the gun. The phone rings. He picks up:
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Yes?
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CRAWFORD'S STREET - CONTINUOUS
text: Nunally is standing by the open trunk of his sedan, wearing a
text: Kevlar vest now - putting on his shoulder-holster over it.
text: Into his cell-phone:
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: Mr. Crawford?
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Who is this?
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: My name is Lieutenant Robert Nunally.
dialog: I'm a hostage negotiator for the Los -
text: Crawford hangs up. Thoughtful.
dialog: 
dialog: 10
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: Mr. Crawford?
text: Nunally grimaces, shuts his phone, shaking his head. But
text: then he turns - with the SWAT Commander and everyone else -
text: - as Crawford's front door unlocks and opens a few inches.
text: Nunally considers this, looks at the SWAT COMMANDER.
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: Okay then. Here we go.
text: He pulls his suit jacket back on, then reaches into the trunk
text: for his back-up gun. He tucks it into the back of his belt,
text: concealed under the jacket.
text: He takes a walkie-talkie and starts for the house.
text: The spectators fall silent. Radios crackle and hiss as he
text: heads up the driveway.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Crawford watches Nunally's silhouette appear on the frosted
text: glass, from across the living room.
speaker_heading: NUNALLY (O.S.)
dialog: Mr. Crawford?
text: The door pushes open very slowly. Nunally stays in the
dialog: doorway.
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: Hey.
text: Crawford studies him, staying back.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Get rid of the vampires.
text: Nunally is confused; Crawford gestures at the flood-lit lawn
text: outside. Nunally glances back, sees the SWAT teams and -
text: down the street - the distant barricades, the media.
text: He nods, steps in and lets the door shut. Careful silence.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Do I call you Rob?
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: If you want.
dialog: 
dialog: 11
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Not vampires.
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Not vampires. Ghouls. Sorry.
text: Nunally nods, humoring him, glancing around. Sees the small
text: pool of blood where Jennifer fell. Plays it cool.
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: Mr. Crawford, what do you say you give
dialog: me the gun - so I can pay more
dialog: attention to what you're saying?
text: Crawford sighs.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Is that your best shot?
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: So to speak.
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: I just think - maybe it would -
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Tell you what: I will if you will.
text: Nunally frowns, wary.
text: Crawford moves to the coffee table in the center of the room,
text: holds his gun out over it.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
text: We both put down our guns. At the
dialog: same time.
text: Crawford gestures to a chair across the room - by the foyer
text: door, near Nunally.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
text: We set them down and step away.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Then you can "pay more attention" to
dialog: what I'm saying.
text: Nunally studies Crawford...and the gun, hovering above the
text: coffee table. Looking for a trick, a catch. But there isn't
text: one. If Crawford sets down his gun and steps away, he'll be
text: standing in the open center of the room.
dialog: 
dialog: 12
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Happy ending, then.
text: Nunally stares Crawford in the eyes -
text: - then slowly takes his gun from his shoulder holster.
text: Eyes on each other from across the room - moving very slowly -
text: the two men cautiously set down their guns -
text: - and step away. Crawford smiles.
text: Nunally smiles, too, reassuring and false. Begins to edge
text: forward - alert to the possibility of a lunge for the gun or
text: having another weapon. But Crawford stays absolutely still.
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: Mr. Crawford, your neighbor mentioned
dialog: that your wife -
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: It's Tom.
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: I'm sorry?
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: You can call me Tom.
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: Tom. Your wife. Is she here?
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Yes.
text: Crawford gestures to a library alcove, behind him, out of
dialog: view.
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: Is she all right?
text: Nunally begins to drift slowly to the side, to see.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: I don't think she is. I shot her,
dialog: Rob.
text: Nunally's nodding, edging to look into the alcove -
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: You shot your wife.
dialog: 
dialog: 13
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: It was like I just suddenly - snapped.
dialog: We were arguing - and I got the gun.
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: - okay - I hear you -
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: And I shot her in the head. I know it
dialog: was wrong.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Are you listening to me?
text: But Nunally is not. He's frozen - staring, shocked, at the
text: back wall of the alcove - which he can now see.
text: There's a big framed black-white photograph: a portrait of
dialog: Jennifer Crawford.
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: Oh Jesus Christ.
text: Nunally fumbles for his walkie-talkie, rushing past Crawford
text: toward the alcove -
text: - kneeling by Jennifer, who lies, face-up in a red puddle -
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: (into walkie-talkie)
dialog: We need a medic in here! Get the
text: ambulance up! RIGHT NOW! NOW! NOW!
text: Nunally feels her neck frantically for a pulse - looking in
text: her open, vacant eyes for some sign -
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: Oh no - God no - I can't - get a -
text: Nunally desperately starts C.P.R., his hands getting bloody.
text: He stops to check her neck for a pulse now and then -
text: - as Crawford slowly approaches from the living room,
text: standing behind Nunally. Cold.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: You know, I think I read somewhere
dialog: that a good place to find a pulse is
text: the femoral artery. It's on the inner
dialog: surface of the upper thigh. If you
dialog: put your fingers - you know, right up
dialog: inside her dress -
dialog: 
dialog: 14
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Nunally turns and lunges up, smashing a fist into Crawford's
text: face. Crawford reels backward with Nunally -
text: - the two of them falling with Nunally on top, beating
text: Crawford furiously, cursing -
text: - as SWAT COPS burst in, grabbing Nunally, dragging him back -
text: knocking into PARAMEDICS trying to get to Jennifer -
text: - Nunally kicking, flailing, spitting at Crawford - who's put
text: face-down on the floor, to get cuffed.
text: Nunally pulls free from the SWAT cops, distraught, angry -
text: going to retrieve his gun and shove it in his shoulder-
text: holster, struggling to regain control.
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC
dialog: Wait a second - she's not dead!
text: Nunally whirls - everyone freezing, breathless, falling
dialog: silent.
text: The Paramedics kneeling around Jennifer work -
text: - as Crawford lies on the floor, staring at his wife. Like
dialog: she's a machine that defied astronomical odds and refused to
dialog: behave according to his calculations.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - SOON AFTER
text: Jennifer's stretcher is loaded into an ambulance, doors
text: slamming shut and sirens kicking on -
text: - as Crawford, cuffed behind his back, is pushed into the
text: back seat of a police car. His eyes on the ambulance as it
text: pulls away, carrying his wife.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - SOON AFTER
text: A DETECTIVE uses a pencil to lift Crawford's gun from the
text: coffee table and carefully put it in an evidence bag.
text: Nunally stands back, watching the COPS and TECHNICIANS work
text: the scene - lost in his thoughts, shaken.
speaker_heading: SWAT COMMANDER
dialog: You all right?
text: Nunally "wakes" - nods. Absently:
dialog: 
dialog: 15
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: Yeah. I'm good.
text: To avoid talking more, he heads out to the glaring lights and
text: chaos outside.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WILLY'S APARTMENT - THE NEXT MORNING
text: The alarm clock shifts to 6:00 am and pops on to local news
dialog: and traffic -
text: - but the narrow futon bed is already empty.
text: WILLY SLOCUM works at a laptop on his second-hand desk, lit
text: by a solitary lamp.
text: He is in his late-20s, good-looking. Short hair, office-pale
text: but athletic, wearing mis-matched sweats from Eastern
dialog: Oklahoma State College.
text: He jots a final note, sets his yellow legal pad aside. As he
text: goes to the closet-sized bathroom, pulling off his sweatshirt
text: and starting the tiny pre-fab shower, we linger on the laptop
text: screen: rental listings for a new apartment.
speaker_heading: TIME CUT
text: The bare overhead bulb is on, revealing the concrete floor
text: and painted-plywood walls. His clothes hang neatly on a
text: length of pipe suspended by ropes from the exposed rafters.
text: Law school texts fill cinderblock-and-board shelves.
text: The radio chatters. Willy knots a tie in his crisp white
dialog: collar.
speaker_heading: TIME CUT
text: Willy methodically packs legal folders from last night's
text: "homework" into his big, battered briefcase. He has to work
dialog: to stuff all the files in.
text: He pulls on his suit jacket, settles the shoulders, tugs at
text: his cuffs. Uncaps a pen, leans over a one-sentence letter
text: waiting on the desk. Reads it over.
text: As he signs, we glimpse:
dialog: - hereby give notice that I will be resigning my
dialog: position at the District Attorney's Office as of
dialog: Novemb-
dialog: 
dialog: 16
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Willy savors the moment.
text: Then he tucks the letter into an envelope, gets the heavy
text: briefcase - goes to shut off the light and open the door -
text: - which swings about six inches, then clonks into something.
text: Willy grimaces. Peeks out, goes to pound on a wall.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Mrs. Demello?
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: MRS. DEMELLO! Your CAR!
text: Silence. He sighs. Shuts the door and presses a button near
text: the light-switch.
text: There's mechanical grinding noise as the far wall slowly
text: rolls up, letting in daylight and revealing an alley beyond
text: the hanging clothes and cinderblock shelves.
text: He presses the garage-door-opener button again, and hurries
text: across the apartment to duck out under the closing door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS
text: Willy straightens and takes a breath, re-settling his suit
text: jacket with an irritable glance at his landlady's car, parked
text: sloppily next to the garage, blocking his door.
text: As he walks away, down the alley, we rise up to reveal the
text: hazy sprawling landscape of L.A. - and the towers of
text: Downtown, rising ahead of Willy like Oz.
speaker_heading: WILLY (V.O.)
dialog: Come on, Phil: I called you as a
dialog: courtesy, and you start looking to
dialog: take advantage?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WILLY'S OFFICE - LATER THAT MORNING
text: An ancient fluorescent-lit cubby crammed with documents, case
dialog: files, notes, reference books. Willy on the phone:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I'm not knocking it down to a Class C.
dialog: My backlog of open cases does not
dialog: mitigate the fact that your client
dialog: tried to kill his brother-in-law with -
dialog: oh, right, a "golfing accident"? Your
dialog: client owns one golf club and no golf
speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: WILLY (cont'd)
dialog: balls - and the "accident" took place
text: in the stairway of an illegal after-

dialog: I'll see you in court.
text: His cell phone rings. As he gets it:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Well, I won't see you in court, but
dialog: someone from this office will. You
dialog: take it up with them, I gotta go.
dialog: (switching phones)
dialog: Willy Slocum. Oh - hey, hi, yes.
text: Assistant District Attorney NORMAN CHANG (mid-30s) throws the
text: door open without looking:
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Wooton Sims?!
text: Willy holds up a finger, talking into his cell:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: No, I didn't. Wow. Okay.
text: Norman mouths "WOOTON SIMS?!" repeatedly during:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: No - short notice is...fine. No, I
dialog: can. Black tie. Sure. What time?
dialog: Okay. Yes. Thank her.
text: He hangs up, exhales slowly. Looks at Norman.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Wooton - SIMS?!
dialog: Wooton Sims?!
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Please stop saying, "Wooton Sims" over
text: and over. It's starting to sound like
dialog: nonsense words.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You asshole!
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Okay: go back to "Wooton Sims."

dialog: I've been here five years. I'm your
dialog: supervisor. I graduated USC, summa!
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: We're just going to pretend he's not
dialog: talking, okay?
speaker_heading: MONA NORMAN
dialog: No problem. I'm serious.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I'm really jammed-up all day, and I
dialog: need to rent a tuxedo - for tonight.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: A tuxedo?! Oh, come on! You are so
dialog: full of shit.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: (Jotting notes)
dialog: There must be a place that does that,
dialog: right - same day? I'm also gonna need
dialog: a messenger to bring it here. This is
dialog: my suit size and my shirt size...I
dialog: really appreciate this.
text: Mona nods, taking notes as Willy gets out a credit card.
text: Other DDAs are gathering to soak up some vicarious kicks.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Wooton Sims buys a whole lot of seats
dialog: to this charity opera thing every
dialog: year, because Bob Wooton is the
dialog: chairman of this committee -
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: "Bob" Wooton?!
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: (Enjoying, mock-helpless)
dialog: It's what the man told me to call him.
dialog: 
dialog: 19
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: You're gonna need to pick out a style,
dialog: Willy.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: A style.
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: For the tuxedo.
text: Willy hesitates, in over his head. A DDA helpfully does the
text: Travolta finger-in-the-air pose.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I don't know - I just don't want to
dialog: look like I'm going to the prom.
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: You wanna go Classic. Fix him up.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: We'll get you something Classic.
dialog: (Picks up a ringing phone)
text: Willy Slocum's office.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Make sure it comes with cuff-links and
dialog: knee-pads.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Oh, that's very nice: it's good to be
dialog: back in high school.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: (Hanging up)
dialog: Willy?
text: Her tone makes him - and everyone else - turn.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: God wants to see you.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Our God?
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Who art on the Eleventh Floor.
text: Willy, startled, looks around. Approving nods, raised
text: eyebrows. He tightens his tie and heads for the elevators.
dialog: 
dialog: 20
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: There is no justice! There is no
dialog: justice in the city of Los Angeles!

scene_heading: INT. LOBRUTO'S OFFICE - SOON AFTER
text: District Attorney JOE LOBRUTO, 50-ish, sits behind a massive
text: oak desk, studying a thick file. Doesn't look up as a
text: SECRETARY shows Willy in.
text: Willy hesitates. Looks around: he's never been here. Flags,
text: wood panelling, leather furniture, windows overlooking the
text: city. Finally Lobruto looks up, takes Willy in.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: William No-Middle-Initial Slocum.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yes sir.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: Sit.
dialog: (As Willy does:)
dialog: Eighty-four-percent conviction rate.
dialog: That's remarkable.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: With a case load thirty percent higher
dialog: than any other first-year DDA.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Of course - you also swapped more
dialog: cases than the rest of them put
dialog: together.
text: Willy considers his options. He always does.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I offered my losing cases in exchange
dialog: for two or three of anyone else's
dialog: possible convictions. They couldn't
dialog: handle their workloads, and I prefer
dialog: not to lose.
dialog: Lobruto knew this; the question was would Willy admit it.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: You're going to need a middle initial.
dialog: 
dialog: 21
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: You're going to Wooton Sims.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: In two weeks.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: You'll be able to afford a better
dialog: suit. But those guys all play squash
dialog: and have middle names. They go in for
dialog: the mother's maiden name a lot.
text: Beat. Willy doesn't like the implied personal judgement, but
text: the only way it shows is how calm he stays.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: My mother didn't have a maiden name.
text: Lobruto nods, unruffled by Willy's hard calm.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: So you're a bastard; sometimes I can
dialog: be a son-of-a-bitch. Maybe you belong
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I didn't work this hard to stay where
dialog: I belong.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: You're a street-fighter, Willy. You
dialog: should be in court. We can move you
dialog: up to better cases.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I appreciate the offer.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: I didn't think so.
dialog: (Closes the file, stands)
dialog: Well - you got your litigation
dialog: experience. Your chops. And your
dialog: juicy private sector job. Anything
dialog: else the City of Los Angeles can do
dialog: for you?
text: Willy's amused. He stands, too. As they shake hands:
dialog: 
dialog: 22
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: No, I think that's everything - thank
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: The offer stands. If you get tired of
text: carrying a spear.
text: Willy nods - but Lobruto notes the tiny flicker in his eyes:
text: not getting it and trying to cover. Lobruto smiles gently.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: It's an opera joke. Give my regards
dialog: to Bob.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WILLY'S OFFICE - LATER
text: Willy's twisting in his rented tux, trying to adjust a buckle
text: on the side of the vest.
text: The phone rings and he gives up, frustrated - pushing the
dialog: plastic garment-bag aside to answer -
text: - knocking a full cup of take-out coffee on to his chair.
text: Which is where he left his suit.
text: Willy freezes. Watching the coffee seep into the fabric.
text: Into the phone, distracted:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Willy Slocum.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NORMAN'S OFFICE - THE SAME TIME
text: Norman's looking at a case file.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I've got an Attempted Homicide.
dialog: Conley caught it last night, but he's
text: hung up in motions with Gardner.
dialog: Arraignment in Part Seven, at three
dialog: o'clock.
speaker_heading: WILLY
text: Three o'clock is in fifteen minutes.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Thank you. What's the temperature?
dialog: 
dialog: 23
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I can't do it.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You do still actually work here,
dialog: Willy, right? I mean, you're still
dialog: going to be cashing your paycheck for
dialog: another two weeks and everything?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Just get somebody else for this one.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Everybody's booked up. Look: it's not
text: going to trial. There's a weapon with
dialog: prints, and a confession. Take the
text: arraignment and wait for the plea.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: A real confession?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Spontaneous and signed. Come on,
dialog: Willy.
text: Willy sighs. Looking down at his coffee-soaked suit.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Okay. Here's the problem.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NORMAN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Norman slowly smiles, listening.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You know - I really wish I was going
dialog: to see this.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - LATER
text: Willy slips self-consciously through the double-doors,
text: wearing the tuxedo.
text: He gets even more self-conscious when he notices a handful of
text: local REPORTERS. He hurries in -
text: - passing Nunally, in the back row. Nunally is making a good
dialog: show of keeping it together...but it's only a show.
text: JUDGE IRENE FELDMAN, 50-ish, looks over her half-glasses.
dialog: 
dialog: 24
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDGE FELDMAN
dialog: Mr. Slocum. Nice to see a man who
dialog: dresses for court.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Sorry, your honor. Long story.
text: Willy, hurrying to Prosecution Table, barely glances at the
dialog: Defense Table -
text: - but Crawford, sitting beside his PUBLIC DEFENDER in an
text: orange jumpsuit and handcuffs, never takes his eyes off
text: Willy, intrigued.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FELDMAN
dialog: Grapevine has it the punch-line is
dialog: Wooton Sims.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FELDMAN
dialog: Good for you, double-oh-seven.
dialog: (Signaling the Bailiff)
dialog: Let's see what public service is
dialog: offering you by way of a send-off:
speaker_heading: BAILIFF
dialog: The State of California Versus Thomas
dialog: Crawford.
text: The Defense rises; Crawford hardly pays any attention to the
text: Judge - glancing back and noticing Nunally, whose eyes bore
text: into him, haunted and burning.
text: Crawford stares at him impassively a second, then turns to
text: lean past his P.D. and watch Willy hastily skim the file.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Mr. Crawford, you've been charged with
dialog: section 664 slash 187 of the
dialog: California Penal Code: Attempted
dialog: Murder, with additional allegations of
dialog: Assault With a Deadly Weapon - Penal
dialog: Code section 245 dash A2, with Great
scene_heading: Bodily Injury, P.C. Section 12022.07.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Do you waive further reading of the
dialog: complaint and complete statement of
dialog: rights?
dialog: 
dialog: 25
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: P.D. CRAWFORD
dialog: (sotto) I do. But, your honor -
dialog: You do.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FELDMAN
dialog: And do you wish to enter a plea at
dialog: this time?
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Not guilty. But I also want to waive
dialog: my right to counsel, and represent
dialog: myself.
text: Willy looks up from the file - startled.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FELDMAN
dialog: Do you have a problem with your
dialog: appointed counsel, Mr. Crawford?
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: No. I just want to do it myself. I
dialog: believe it's within my rights.
dialog: P.D.
dialog: Your honor, if I could have a moment
dialog: with my client -
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: I'm not your client. Try and keep up,
dialog: would you?
text: The P.D. shuts up, taken aback. The Judge considers
text: Crawford, thoughtful, then turns to Willy.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FELDMAN
dialog: Do the People have an objection or a
dialog: comment for the record, Mr. Slocum?
text: Willy hesitates, held by Crawford's strange, amused gaze.
dialog: Shakes it off:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I'm sorry, your honor: we've got the
dialog: weapon and a signed confession. I
dialog: really think Mr. Crawford needs a
dialog: competent attorney to - frankly -
dialog: negotiate a plea.
text: Crawford reaches up with cuffed hands and adjusts an
text: imaginary bow-tie. Willy self-consciously touches where
text: Crawford indicated on his own collar, straightens his clip-
dialog: on.
dialog: 
dialog: 26
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Crawford nods: you're welcome. Willy turns to the Judge.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I - can't - this was supposed to be -
dialog: with a pro se defendant, this is going
dialog: to drag out for months - and I'm not
dialog: even going to be here. The People
dialog: request a continuance to -
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Excuse me? Your honor? I'm willing
dialog: to waive my right to a preliminary
dialog: hearing and go directly to a jury
dialog: trial.
dialog: (To Willy)
dialog: Does that help?
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: You don't need to look out for Mr.
dialog: Slocum, Mr. Crawford. The District
dialog: Attorney's office can shift another
dialog: prosecutor to the case -
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: No, I like Mr. Slocum.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FELDMAN
dialog: Mr. Slocum? He likes you.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Terrific.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FELDMAN
text: Mr. Crawford seems to understand his
dialog: rights and responsibilities.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: All due respect, your honor, I'm
dialog: worried this may turn into some sort
dialog: of a - circus -
speaker_heading: JUDGE FELDMAN
dialog: I appreciate your concern for the
dialog: dignity of my courtroom, Mr. Slocum -
dialog: considering you're making the argument
text: dressed as a game-show host.
text: Unfortunately, the man is a tax-paying
dialog: citizen, entitled by our Constitution
dialog: to try and manipulate the legal
dialog: system, like everybody else.
dialog: (turning)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 27
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDGE FELDMAN (cont'd)
dialog: As for you, Mr. Crawford, I strongly
dialog: urge you to retain counsel. Lack of
dialog: same will not be grounds for appeal.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: I understand. Thank you.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FELDMAN
dialog: Are the People ready to go to trial
dialog: without a preliminary hearing?
text: Willy hesitates, irritated. Looks through the file again.
text: Checks Crawford - waiting, polite.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Sure. Why not.
text: Crawford smiles at him, as the Judge opens her calendar.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PARKING STRUCTURE - LATER
text: Willy, in his tux, comes out of a staircase and stops. Rob
text: Nunally is waiting by Willy's parked car.
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: You're supposed to be good.
text: Willy takes him in - wary, seeing an edge of anger and fear
text: beneath the tough controlled cop manner.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Is that what I'm supposed to be?
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: I asked around. You're supposed to be
dialog: top-notch - but to me it looks like
dialog: you've got one foot out the door, and
dialog: you're wiping the rest of us off the
text: bottom of the other one.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I'm sorry to...disappoint you.
text: Nunally is silent - frustrated. The concrete walls and
text: ceilings echo from distant cars.
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: I took Crawford's confession.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: And now you want mine?
dialog: 
dialog: 28
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: I'm here to warn you. Take this
dialog: seriously, because it's serious. This
dialog: guy is stone cold - and his wife - is
text: lying in a hospital bed - with brain
dialog: damage...
text: He struggles to keep himself under control.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Are you all right?
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: Are you gonna be on this, or what?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yeah. I'm on it.
dialog: (Gently)
dialog: You got a confession. You took the
text: gun out of his hand. It's done.
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: I'm just - telling you. Is that okay?
dialog: Or are you too friggin' busy?!
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: No. It's okay.
text: Willy waits. Watching the tortured cop wrestle with demons.
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: Forget it.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: It's a lock. We're good. Put him
dialog: down. Bury him.
text: Willy nods. Nunally turns and walks away, down a ramp.
text: Willy watches him go. Sad. Like he's watching Nunally
dialog: drown. But he's seen people drown before...and he's not
text: about to put out a hand. Might get pulled in himself.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CHANDLER PAVILION - LOBBY - LATER
text: Willy moves uneasily among clusters of laughing, chatting,
scene_heading: sparkling FORMAL-DRESSED PEOPLE.
text: NIKKI GARDNER joins him, strolling alongside. She's his age,
text: but her elegant dress, unlike his tux, was made for her.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Are you a shark?
dialog: 
dialog: 29
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Sorry?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: You've been circling the lobby for
dialog: half-an-hour now, like if you stopped
dialog: you'd die.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: If I stopped, I'd be standing around
dialog: with no one to talk to. At which
dialog: point, death would be a relief.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Why don't you talk to Bob?
text: Willy stops walking, getting a little careful.
speaker_heading: WILLY
text: "Bob" is talking to the Governor.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Do I know you?
text: She puts a hand out, gently amused.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Nikki Gardner. Senior Associate,
dialog: Wooton Sims.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: (Shakes)
dialog: Oh - hey, hi. It was your office that
dialog: called, with the invitation.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
text: On Bob's orders.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Listen, I don't...actually know "Bob."
dialog: I mean, I've only met the man once.
text: Nikki nods, considering this. And him.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Interesting.
text: They're each conscious of an unexpected buzz of attraction.
text: The lobby lights flicker, breaking the spell a little. As
text: the CROWD begins to drift toward the auditorium doors:
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: You like opera?
dialog: 
dialog: 30
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Truth is, I haven't really had that
dialog: much expos-
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Neither do I.
text: With a conspiratorial head-tip, Nikki moves toward the plaza
text: doors. Willy follows.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ARTS CENTER - SOON AFTER
text: They stroll the emptying plaza, dressed to the nines.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Bob assigned you to my team. I'll
dialog: supervise your case-work, steer you
text: through the office arcana, and
dialog: generally keep an eye on you.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Kind of like a mentor.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Kind of like a probation officer.
text: Beat. Willy nods, meeting Nikki's gaze as she looks to make
dialog: sure he's got it.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Wooton Sims expects absolute loyalty
dialog: and a hundred-and-ten-percent
dialog: performance. But: you get to work on
dialog: legendary litigation. National,
dialog: sometimes global, in scope. It's high-
text: stakes. And cut-throat - even within
dialog: the team. We burn out associates at
dialog: an astonishing rate.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You're trying to scare me.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You're going to have to try harder.
text: She stops walking. Studying Willy.
dialog: 
dialog: 31
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Can I ask you something personal?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Who are you?
text: Willy doesn't answer. Maybe uncertain what she means. Maybe
text: not wanting her to know. Or even not knowing, himself.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: We have a guy in our criminal
dialog: division, fresh out of Yale, named
dialog: Calvin Tyler. One of our very rich
dialog: clients gets pulled over, D.U.I. -
dialog: which is routine bullshit, so Calvin
dialog: gets it. Against you. Next thing we
text: know, Calvin is fired, and Bob Wooton,
dialog: who has never even interviewed a
dialog: junior associate before - let alone
dialog: hired one - says you're on my team.
text: Willy weighs his options. Decides to level:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: It was a good bust, so Calvin came to
dialog: me for a deal. I told him if he could
dialog: arrange an interview for me with Mr.
dialog: Wooton, I would throw the case. I
dialog: laid out his arguments and evidence
dialog: for him - and I showed him how I would
dialog: lose. Calvin set up my appointment
dialog: for the day after our court date.
dialog: Then he did what I had suggested in
dialog: court - and I wiped the floor with
dialog: him. Your client got the maximum.
dialog: Next day, I met with Mr. Wooton.
dialog: (Shrugs)
dialog: Bob.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Wow. You know what's brilliant about
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
dialog: 32
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: You didn't actually do anything all
dialog: that wrong.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Well - I wasn't entirely honest with
dialog: Calvin.
text: His cell-phone rings. He ignores it.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: You gonna get that?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Everyone I need to talk to is here.
text: They are both feeling the electricity in the air between them.
text: They wait the phone out, enjoying the forbidden insanity of
dialog: it. But then:
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: We need to talk about your transition
dialog: timetable.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: All right.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
text: Bob believes in trial-by-fire. He
dialog: wants you up-to-speed two weeks from
dialog: Tuesday, because we're getting on a
dialog: plane to Chicago for depositions in a
dialog: class-action against our biggest
dialog: client, Armstead Pharmaceutical.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: No problem.
text: She studies Willy, trying to make sure he understands:
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: That's catch-up on three years' work -
dialog: and you haven't closed out your old
dialog: job yet.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I'm good at trials. Even by fire.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: You know, a little bit of fear can be
dialog: a very healthy thing to have.
dialog: 
dialog: 33
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I'm looking forward to when I can
dialog: afford the luxury of having some.
text: Nikki sighs, smiles. Enjoying him, somewhat reluctantly.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: I'll have them put the Armstead
dialog: materials in your new office.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Thanks. Boss.
text: He watches her head off into the night. He remains, alone,
text: in his tuxedo, looking at the elegant glittering arts plaza.
text: Then he checks his cell-phone. Dials.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FORENSICS LAB - LATER
scene_heading: MARCHAND, Senior S.I.D. (Scene Investigation Division) Tech,
text: works as he talks into a speaker-phone. He and Willy have
text: teamed-up often, and an underlying respect lets them mock
dialog: each other.
speaker_heading: MARCHAND
dialog: Marchand.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: It's Willy Slocum. What's up?
speaker_heading: MARCHAND
dialog: Your gun in that Palisades shooting is
dialog: no good.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: How can the gun be "no good"?
speaker_heading: MARCHAND
dialog: It's a perfectly good weapon. A
dialog: Heckler &amp; Koch nine-millimeter. It's
dialog: just no good as evidence. It's never
dialog: been fired.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: It's the gun from the scene?
dialog: 
dialog: 34
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCHAND
dialog: Yep. Bought by Mr. Thomas Crawford
dialog: and registered to his wife, about a
dialog: month ago. Apparently a gift.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: And between the shooting and arrest,
dialog: this guy was locked inside his house.
speaker_heading: MARCHAND
dialog: Is that a question?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: No, I mean, just: what's the point?
dialog: Playing games with the gun. He's
text: alone in the house with the victim,
dialog: and he confessed - it's not like the
dialog: gun's gonna get him off the hook.
speaker_heading: MARCHAND
dialog: Do you have a question I can answer?
text: Beat. Willy shakes the puzzle off, irritated:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Look, our weapon is in that house
dialog: somewhere. Get a team out to search
dialog: it tomorrow morning.
speaker_heading: MARCHAND
dialog: Ya think?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: (Sighs, smiles)
dialog: Thank you.
text: He shuts the phone. Takes a moment, looking around again at
text: where he is. Absently tugs at his tie and vest, lets the
text: case go. Heads in to the opera.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WILLY'S OFFICE - A WEEK LATER
text: Controlled chaos. A week's work has emptied the shelves and
text: cleared the surfaces, but the file-cabinet drawers are all
text: half-open: Willy sorts folders, neatly marking and packing
text: them. White "trans-file" storage boxes are piled all over.
speaker_heading: MESSENGER (O.S.)
dialog: Slocum?
text: Willy looks up, at a MESSENGER with another file box.
dialog: 
dialog: 35
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MESSENGER
dialog: Where do you want it?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: The idea here is we're trying to take
dialog: boxes out - not bring more in.
speaker_heading: MESSENGER
dialog: Is that the idea?
text: Willy sourly gestures to a chair; checks the label as the
text: Messenger sets it down -
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Whoa - wait a second, this is a screw-
dialog: up. I already have these documents.
dialog: I sent this box: to the Defendant, at
dialog: County.
speaker_heading: MESSENGER
dialog: I picked up at County. Slip says
dialog: bring 'em here.
text: Messenger holds out a clipboard. Willy reluctantly signs.
text: As the Messenger leaves, Willy cuts the tape and takes out a
dialog: folder. Opens it:
text: Crawford has scrawled NO in red marker across the top sheet.
text: Willy turns to the next page. A big red NO across that, too.
text: Pulls out more documents - flips through: NO - NO - NO - NO -
text: red letters wriggling across the typed pages, like flip-book
dialog: animation.
text: Beat. Disturbed, he picks up the phone, dials.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - THE SAME TIME
text: S.I.D. TECHS are taking the place apart: opening HVAC vents,
text: pulling books off shelves, upending chairs and tables,
text: removing drawers from cabinets.
text: Marchand, supervising, answers his cell-phone:
speaker_heading: MARCHAND

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Where are we on this gun?
speaker_heading: MARCHAND
dialog: We can't find it, Willy.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I'm in trial on Monday.
speaker_heading: MARCHAND
dialog: I know. I don't know what to tell
dialog: you. I'm there now.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You said you'd get a team out a week
dialog: ago -
speaker_heading: MARCHAND
dialog: I'm here now. My team has been here
dialog: twice already.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Do you really need it?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Do I need it?! The weapon?!
text: He takes a second. Sighs, exasperated - but honest:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I don't know. Probably not.
dialog: Defendant's a whack-job.
speaker_heading: MARCHAND
dialog: He went pro se, right?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yeah. Just when you think they're not
dialog: really stupid, they defend themselves.
speaker_heading: MARCHAND
dialog: You've got a confession and an
text: airtight bunch of circumstantial.
dialog: (Apologetic)
dialog: We've gone over this place top-to-
dialog: bottom three times now, Willy.
text: Willy takes a breath. Thinks it through.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yeah, okay. Don't worry about it.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Sorry - got a lot going on.
dialog: 
dialog: 37
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCHAND
dialog: Must be rough, figuring out what
dialog: you're gonna do with all that money.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Hey, I had to sit through an opera
dialog: last week.
speaker_heading: MARCHAND
dialog: Oh gee - lemme see if I can express
dialog: how much sympathy I have:
text: Marchand snaps his phone shut.
text: Willy smiles, hangs up. But then his smile fades, as he
text: glances down again at Crawford's box of papers.
text: Hundreds of pages. Every single one scrawled NO.
dialog: Willy considers them.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. COUNTY JAIL - INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER
text: Metal chairs. Bad light. Crawford sits, cuffed, at a table,
text: waiting. Looks up as the door unlocks.
text: A GUARD lets Willy in, locks the door behind him.
text: Crawford watches Willy take a legal pad, files, pens from his
text: briefcase, set them on the table.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: How's my wife?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: I heard somewhere, I think it was on
dialog: N.P.R., that you're supposed to talk
dialog: to people in a coma. Play their
dialog: favorite music. Supposedly it reaches
dialog: them.
text: Willy, now ready, lets Crawford study him.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: You represent Jennifer. The voice of
text: the victim, judicially speaking. But
dialog: you haven't gone to see her?
dialog: 
dialog: 38
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Not yet.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
text: Too busy getting up to speed on
dialog: Armstead Pharmaceutical?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: I'm not judging you. I think anyone -
dialog: coming from...what you came from -
dialog: then paying your way through East-Okie
dialog: Cowshit College and Tulsa Law by
dialog: writing papers for Princeton kids on
dialog: the internet - my God, it must have
dialog: eaten your liver! Sixty-thousand
dialog: dollars in debt, eighty-four percent
dialog: conviction rate: you deserve this.
text: Willy tries to stay in control.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: What the hell have you been doing.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: I'm permitted the use of a private
dialog: investigator.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Not to investigate me!
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Why not? You're investigating me.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You shot your wife.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Allegedly. That's how it works,
dialog: right? If I can't introduce something
dialog: in court as evidence - it doesn't
dialog: exist. Legally.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Look - I don't want to play games with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: I'm afraid you have to.
dialog: 
dialog: 39
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Beat. Willy reconstructs his formal cool. Takes some pages
text: scrawled NO from a folder, pushes them across the table.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Is this some form of - communication?
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: You sent me a box of papers.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: It's called Discovery. The State has
dialog: a legal obliga-
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: There's nothing in it, Willy. You
dialog: haven't 'discovered' anything. Have
dialog: you found the gun?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Not yet.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: No.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Does it bother you that I call you
dialog: Willy?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: (Lies)
dialog: No.
text: Crawford nods. Pleased. Leans forward.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: I'd like you to consider becoming my
dialog: lawyer. I'll pay you. A lot of
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I'm - prosecuting you.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Yeah, but I'm offering you a chance to
dialog: get on the right side of this whole
dialog: mess while you still can.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Are you out of your mind?
dialog: 
dialog: 40
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: I think - on advice of counsel - I'll
dialog: decline to answer that one.
text: Willy studies him. Decides: it's an elaborate act. Begins
text: to put away his papers.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I don't need the gun to convict you,
dialog: by the way.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: She was cheating, you know.
text: Willy looks at him, slightly taken aback. He didn't know; it
dialog: wasn't in the confession.
text: As he considers whether it makes a difference - he notices
text: Crawford watching, enjoying. Willy shuts his briefcase.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: It doesn't matter what she did...Tom.
dialog: What you did is a crime.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Perhaps. But - maybe my so-called
dialog: peers will look at me and see
text: themselves. Betrayed. Frustrated.
dialog: Humiliated. And you and I both know,
dialog: Willy, that people have an infinite
dialog: capacity for believing in their own
dialog: innocence.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Great. Take the stand. Tell your
dialog: story. I'd appreciate it.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Not to mention the fact you have no
dialog: actual evidence connecting me to the
dialog: crime.
text: Willy smiles, gets up.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Except your confession.
text: Crawford watches him go to the door.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: My grandfather was an egg farmer.
text: Willy stops, annoyed.
dialog: 
dialog: 41
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Is this gonna be about how you had a
dialog: rough childhood?
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: I used to candle eggs at his farm.
dialog: You know what that is? You hold an
text: egg up to a light, and look for
dialog: imperfections.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The first time I did it, he told me to
dialog: put the ones that were cracked or
text: flawed in a bucket - for the bakery.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He came back an hour later and there
dialog: were three hundred eggs in the bakery
dialog: bucket. He asked me what the hell I
dialog: was doing.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I found a flaw in every single one.
text: Thin places in the shell, minuscule
dialog: cracks.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Look closely enough and you'll find
dialog: everything has a weak spot...where it
dialog: can break.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Looking for mine?
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: No, I've found yours.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Illuminate me.
dialog: Crawford considers how to put it.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: You're a winner, Willy.
text: Silence. Willy pushes the call-button by the door.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Huh. Well. Joke's on me then, I
dialog: guess.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Yes. It is.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I'll see you in court, Mr. Crawford.
dialog: 
dialog: 42
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The door unlocks. Crawford winks.
text: Willy hesitates for a second - then leaves.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WOOTON, SIMS - EMPTY OFFICE - LATER
text: It's big. It's got a window. It's got a sofa. Undecorated,
text: except for a pile of materials &amp; boxes marked ARMSTEAD
scene_heading: PHARMACEUTICAL.
dialog: Willy is filling out forms - tax, citizenship, benefits. He
text: doesn't notice Nikki when she comes to the door.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Make sure you sign the one with the
dialog: devil in blood. It's not binding
dialog: otherwise.
text: He looks up, smiles.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Just want to be ready for Chicago.
dialog: I'm all closed-out, downtown. Last
text: trial starts Monday.
dialog: Beat. Not pleased:
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: You've got a trial Monday?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yeah: attempted murder.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: That gives you three days. You told
dialog: me - and I told Bob - that you would
dialog: be ready to hit the ground r-
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: The man confessed. And he's pro se.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
text: Willy, some but acting as his own
dialog: lawyer - he could drag it out for
dialog: months!
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You want to hear his witness list?
text: Nikki nods. Willy is silent. She frowns.
dialog: 
dialog: 43
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: No witnesses?
text: Willy leans in, enjoying this part - analyzing, even
text: admiring, Crawford's ploy:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: It's kind of clever: this guy is
dialog: trying to provoke the system into
dialog: declaring him insane. I think he
dialog: thinks we'll call in the doctors and
dialog: he can fake 'em out by refusing the
dialog: defense. He's acting out this really -
dialog: organized plan to appear crazy.
dialog: Beat. Nikki considers Willy.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: You're gonna miss being in court,
dialog: aren't you?
text: He studies her, confident. Gestures to the stacks of
dialog: Armstead materials:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I'm almost halfway through these. And
dialog: I think I've already found about six
dialog: disqualifiers in Delaware, Ohio, and
dialog: Florida. I have to check case law in
dialog: each state, but it looks good. I'll
dialog: get the rest done over the long
dialog: weekend.
text: Nikki sighs, smiles a little, against her will. He's won her
dialog: over...again.
text: Willy shrugs, grins. In the silence, the impossible
text: electricity returns. After a moment - to defuse it:
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: You don't go home for Thanksgiving?
text: Slight beat.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: No.
text: She studies him a moment, thoughtful. Careful.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: If you want - you're welcome at mine.
dialog: My family's.
dialog: 
dialog: 44
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Really?
text: She nods. Smiling a little, knowing her family and starting
dialog: to know Willy:
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: I think it would be interesting.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yeah. Okay, thank you.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Cool.
text: Beat. She leaves. Willy doesn't go back to work right away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - THE NEXT DAY
text: JUDGE ROBINSON presiding. A mid-sized crowd, including a few
text: REPORTERS. A UNIFORM COP is in the witness box, Willy stands
dialog: in the Prosecution Table.
speaker_heading: UNIFORM COP
dialog: We established a perimeter around the
text: house and then waited for SWAT and the
dialog: Negotiator. It was strictly by the
dialog: book.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: So the house was completely surrounded
dialog: within how long of the first shots?
text: Crawford sits alone at the Defense Table. He wears an
text: expensive suit and no handcuffs, but two DEPUTIES sit behind
text: him. He's barely listening to the testimony - drawing on his
text: legal pad: intricate, dense complex diagrams of "Rube
dialog: Goldberg" contraptions.
speaker_heading: UNIFORM COP
text: Maybe ten minutes.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: And when you arrived at the sc-
text: Crawford noisily tears a page off his pad. Looks up - sees
text: Willy, and everyone else, turned to him.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: 
dialog: 45
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Willy sighs, returns to the Cop.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: When you arrived on the scene, was
dialog: there a crowd?
speaker_heading: UNIFORM COP
dialog: Oh yeah. Neighbors, came out to look
dialog: soon as it started.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: And from what you could ascertain, no
dialog: one went into or came out of the house
dialog: until SWAT and the negotiator arrived?
speaker_heading: UNIFORM COP
dialog: Definitely not.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Thank you. No further questions.
speaker_heading: JUDGE ROBINSON
dialog: Mr. Crawford?
text: Crawford looks up from his drawing.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JUDGE ROBINSON
dialog: Your witness, Mr. Crawford.
text: Crawford takes in the Uniform Cop.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: No questions for this witness.
text: Willy watches Crawford return diligently to his doodles.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP: THE DEFENSE TABLE - LATER THAT AFTERNOON
text: It's a mess of loose legal-pad pages torn from Crawford's
text: pad, each covered in madly intricate schematics. He works on
text: yet another, head down, intent.
text: Dr. MARION KANG is on the stand, using a marker on a big
dialog: diagram of a head:
dialog: 
dialog: 46
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. KANG
dialog: - through the frontal cortex and the
text: temporal lobe, coming to rest against
text: the back of the skull.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: So this bullet inflicted serious
dialog: injury?
speaker_heading: DR. KANG
dialog: It inflicted serious and irreparable
dialog: injury.
text: Willy nods, allowing the jury time on this. He checks a note-
text: card, glances at Crawford. Considers his options.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Dr. Kang, is it safe to say that
dialog: someone inflicting this kind of wound
dialog: intended to kill?
text: Judge Robinson gives Willy a warning look.
speaker_heading: JUDGE ROBINSON
dialog: Mr. Crawford, you might want to
dialog: object. The witness can't know your
dialog: state of mind.
text: Crawford doesn't even look up from his drawing.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: No thank you, your honor.
text: Willy gives Judge Robinson an I-told-you-so shrug. Turns to
dialog: Dr. Kang.
speaker_heading: KANG
dialog: I would say so, yes.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Thank you, Dr. Kang.
text: Crawford tears off the page, starts another.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - LATER
text: Nunally on the stand. Focused, professional. Crawford
text: draws, ignoring him.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: So after you put down your gun, what
dialog: did Mr. Crawford do?
dialog: 
dialog: 47
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
text: He confessed to shooting his wife.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: He confessed.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Did Mr. Crawford appear confused or in
dialog: any way intoxicated, impaired?
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: No. Not at all. He knew what was
text: going on.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: What did Mr. Crawford say?
text: Nunally looks at Crawford, enjoying the fatal blow:
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: He said, "I got the gun and I shot my
dialog: wife. God help me, I shot her in the
dialog: head. I know it was wrong."
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: (low, still drawing)
dialog: Objection.
text: Everyone turns, surprised.
speaker_heading: JUDGE ROBINSON
dialog: I'm sorry - Mr. Crawford, did you say
dialog: something?
text: Crawford sets aside his pen for the first time. Looks up.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Yes. I want to object.
speaker_heading: JUDGE ROBINSON
dialog: On what grounds?
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Your honor -
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: I don't know what you'd call it. They
dialog: - it wasn't the first time, either,
dialog: but - I don't know the legal term.
dialog: 
dialog: 48
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDGE ROBINSON
dialog: Why don't you just explain it in
dialog: layman's terms.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Fucking the victim.
text: Uproar in the court.
speaker_heading: JUDGE ROBINSON
dialog: Mr. Crawford -
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: You said layman's terms -
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Your honor -
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: I'm sorry - what would you call it -
dialog: legally - when the officer who
dialog: arrested you has been having sexual
dialog: intercourse with your wife?
text: Utter silence. Willy whirls a look at Nunally. The cop
text: meets his eyes - a deer in headlights.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: (Low)
dialog: Oh - shit.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: I think it's objectionable - maybe I'm
dialog: wrong.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Your honor...
speaker_heading: JUDGE ROBINSON
dialog: Detective Nunally?
text: Nunally looks down, silent. Shaking his head.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Rob?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Your honor, the People request a -
text: Nunally suddenly launches himself over the witness box rail
text: to attack Crawford - as the Deputies leap forward to stop him -
text: all of them flailing and cursing in a tangle -
dialog: 
dialog: 49
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: - spectators screaming, fleeing, gawking. Chaos.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JUDGE ROBINSON'S CHAMBERS - SOON AFTER
text: The Judge grim, Willy panicked, Crawford calm.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: He had my witness list. He should
dialog: have filed to suppress.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: (Shrugs)
dialog: My mistake. Sorry.
speaker_heading: JUDGE ROBINSON
dialog: Mr. Crawford, I warned you about
dialog: representing yourself.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: What about the fact that it's true?
dialog: I mean, isn't that the point here: to
dialog: get to the truth?
speaker_heading: JUDGE ROBINSON
dialog: Mr. Slocum - is it true?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I don't know. I only heard about it
dialog: five minutes ago.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Put him back on the witness stand if
dialog: you don't believe me.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: We can't put him back on now! Not
dialog: after what the jury just saw. Your
dialog: honor, I told you this would turn into
text: a circus. First he provokes the
text: witness with an outrageous allegation -
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: My Dick has evidence.
text: The Judge and Willy look at Crawford like he's truly insane.
speaker_heading: JUDGE ROBINSON
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: My investigator. I call him Dick. I
dialog: guess I should call him as a rebuttal
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 50
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD (cont'd)
dialog: witness? He's got phone records,
dialog: credit receipts, photographs,
dialog: videotapes - all documenting the
text: affair. In graphic detail.
dialog: (Beat. Mildly:)
dialog: Dick is good.
text: The Judge looks at Willy. This is bad. Thinking fast:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Okay - um: I'll stipulate that my
dialog: witness was less than forthcoming
dialog: ...and that can more or less cancel
dialog: out the fact that the defendant
dialog: withheld a crucial -
speaker_heading: JUDGE ROBINSON
dialog: Mr. Slocum - your witness was intimate
text: with the victim, and he assaulted the
dialog: defendant during the arrest.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Actually, while obtaining my so-called
dialog: "confession."
text: Willy stares at Crawford, shaken. Understanding the trap.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: No way. Your honor -
speaker_heading: JUDGE ROBINSON
dialog: He's got a point. They were alone in
dialog: the house. The confession is no good.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Oh - come on!
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Is this a legal argument? "Oh come
dialog: on"?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: (Whirls on him)
dialog: You want to get into it?!
text: Crawford raises his eyebrows. Awkward silence. Willy takes
text: a deep breath. Turns to the Judge.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: He dictated and signed his confession,
dialog: after that incident.
dialog: 
dialog: 51
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDGE ROBINSON
text: In police custody. Arguably, in fear
dialog: for his life. I'm sorry, Mr. Slocum -
dialog: it's all 'fruit of the tainted tree.'
dialog: We have to exclude all versions of the
dialog: confession and any evidence collected
dialog: by Lieutenant Nunally or by other
dialog: police officers on the night he was
dialog: present.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: This is insane!
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: It's Biblical, isn't it? The fruit
dialog: and the tree and -
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: He set this up! Don't you see what
dialog: he's doing?!
speaker_heading: JUDGE ROBINSON
dialog: Yes, I do. And I don't like it. But
dialog: it's done, so we have to deal with it.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Do you think I could go home today,
dialog: your honor? With Thanksgiving around
dialog: the corner -
speaker_heading: JUDGE ROBINSON
dialog: Don't push it, Mr. Crawford.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: What we're going to do is give Mr.
dialog: Slocum a few days to regroup and come
dialog: up with new evidence. If he doesn't -
dialog: then you can go home. That's going to
dialog: put us into the long weekend. We
dialog: reconvene Monday morning.
text: Willy just stands there: blind-sided, shell-shocked.
text: Crawford smiles at him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WILLY'S OFFICE - THAT EVENING
text: The end of a bad, bad day. Willy flips on the lights as he
text: comes in, shaken.
text: A package is on the empty desk. Addressed in red marker.
dialog: The return address: TC, County Jail.
text: Willy just stands looking at it.
dialog: 
dialog: 52
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. COUNTY JAIL - THE SAME TIME
text: Crawford sits on the metal bunk in his prison jumpsuit.
text: Alone. Looking down.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WILLY'S OFFICE - RESUME
text: As Willy takes a letter-opener from the desk drawer - the
text: phone rings. He answers it, eyes still on the package:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Willy Slocum.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GLAMOROUS BAR - THE SAME TIME
text: Crowded with UPSCALE YOUNG PROFESSIONALS. Nikki is on her
text: cell-phone, hand over her other ear:
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Well - you've gotta admire the
dialog: cleverness of it.
text: Willy begins cutting open the package as he talks:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Do I?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTINUOUS
text: Crawford very slowly raises his eyes, until he is looking
text: directly at us.
speaker_heading: NIKKI (V.O.)
dialog: Come on, Willy - give the devil his
dialog: due.
speaker_heading: WILLY (V.O.)
dialog: Yeah. I'm just trying to figure out
dialog: what that is.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WILLY'S OFFICE/GLAMOROUS BAR - RESUME
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Okay: then listen - I checked with Bob
dialog: on how he wants you to handle this.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 53
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI (cont'd)
dialog: Has LoBruto tried to take you off the
dialog: case yet?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Well, he pretty much has to if he's
dialog: gonna save any face. So here's the
dialog: strategy: you let him.
text: Willy cautiously lifts the box's flaps - pulls aside tissue
dialog: paper - to reveal:
text: A single eggshell. Broken, empty.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I let him?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTINUOUS
text: Crawford begins to smile.
speaker_heading: NIKKI (V.O.)
dialog: Yeah, damage control. Stop getting
dialog: your face on TV. As it is, I had to
dialog: talk Bob down from cancelling your
dialog: contract.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WILLY'S OFFICE/GLAMOROUS BAR - RESUME
text: Willy is staring down at the broken eggshell, barely
text: listening to Nikki.
speaker_heading: NIKKI (CONT'D)
dialog: But we've got to move fast and get out
dialog: from under. Otherwise, and I quote:
dialog: "Stick a fork in this kid's ass and
dialog: turn him over, he's done."
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I can't just - walk away.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Willy: today, you got killed. The
dialog: issue now is saving your new life.
text: Willy can't take his eyes off Crawford's "gift."
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I guess...that would be the smart way
text: of looking at it.
dialog: 
dialog: 54
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTINUOUS
text: Crawford stares right at us. Smiling. Ice cold.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WILLY'S OFFICE/GLAMOROUS BAR - RESUME
text: Nikki is sympathetic, misunderstanding Willy's quiet:
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: You want to come out and get drunk?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: No. Thank you. I've got some stuff
dialog: to take care of.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: All right. Don't beat yourself up.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I won't.
text: He hangs up. Considering the empty eggshell. But then he
dialog: looks up:
text: District Attorney Lobruto is in his office doorway, trying to
dialog: decide whether to be angry.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: You don't look into who the victim
dialog: was sleeping with?
text: Willy burns, ashamed. But unable to admit it.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: He - threw me off.
dialog: (Frustrated)
dialog: Look, Crawford knew he'd be the prime
dialog: suspect, so he gave us everything -
dialog: but he made it all radioactive. The
dialog: night this went down, it was over.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: But you still walked it into court,
dialog: Willy. We might not have a case...but
dialog: it didn't have to be a public
dialog: humiliation for this office and the
dialog: police department.
dialog: Silence.
dialog: 
dialog: 55
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Are you taking me off?
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: You're leaving anyway.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I'm starting to get a sense of this
dialog: guy.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: That's not new evidence.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I can take him now: he thinks he's
dialog: smarter than I am.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: It's not about you, Willy.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yeah, it is. He made it that way.
dialog: (Shows him the egg)
dialog: He likes me.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: What is that - some kind of Oklahoma
dialog: insult?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Let me do this. I won't make you look
dialog: bad.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: No. You won't. That's what I need to
dialog: make sure you understand. I remove
dialog: you now: I'm covered, I took some
dialog: action.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: If you go on with this, when you lose -
dialog: blame has to come down. And it'll
dialog: come down on you. I'll have to
dialog: investigate you for improprieties,
dialog: incompetence - anything I can. In
dialog: public. I'll hang you out to dry.
dialog: For the good of this office.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: If I lose.
dialog: 
dialog: 56
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You said "when."
text: Lobruto grimaces. He shakes his head. Sighs.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: All right. It's yours.
text: Willy nods. Stubborn. Scared.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Local news on the TV: Willy pushing past media outside the
dialog: courthouse; official photo of Nunally; footage from the
text: standoff at Crawford's.
text: The sound is low, and Nunally isn't watching. He's sitting
text: on the edge of the bed...looking down at his gun, in his
dialog: hands.
text: A knock on the door "wakes" him. Beat. He sets the gun
text: aside, goes to peek out the curtains. Lets Willy in.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You're not easy to find. I had to
dialog: call Internal Affairs.
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: Yeah - they put me on a desk - 'til
dialog: this gets...sorted out.
text: He uncomfortably watches Willy glance around at the half-
text: empty liquor bottle, the mismatched suitcases and paper bags
text: full of balled-up clothes. And the gun on the bed.
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: Got home - my wife already took the
dialog: kids to her folks. Press is all over
dialog: our front lawn. Friggin' vampires.
text: He falters, haunted by the echo. Willy doesn't notice:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: What the hell were you thinking.
dialog: You're on the job and you get called
dialog: to your girlfriend's house -
dialog: 
dialog: 57
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: I didn't know it was her house. I'd
dialog: never been there.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: It was her name!
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: I didn't know her name!
text: Willy waits. Nunally explains, reluctant to expose himself:
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: No last names. Her rules. We met at
dialog: the same hotel room, twice a week - no
dialog: phone calls, no questions. She didn't
dialog: want us to know too much about each
dialog: other. She said it was like...travel
dialog: in a foreign country. No baggage -
dialog: from our lives. Just us. Escaping.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Did you get the feeling she had rules
dialog: because she had done it before? With
dialog: other guys?
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: No. I don't know. Maybe.
dialog: (Thinking, remembering:)
dialog: No. It was all just this...crazy
dialog: thing. For both of us. It was...
dialog: real. You know? We didn't expect
dialog: that, when we started. We didn't know
dialog: where it was going. I had cheated so
dialog: many times, I was numb - but she was
dialog: ...new. And she made me feel like
dialog: there was - some chance. To change.
dialog: We were scared. It was like we were
dialog: afraid to go forward, but we couldn't
dialog: go back.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: You always think you have time. To
dialog: work it out. Or make things right.
dialog: (Angry)
dialog: What was I supposed to do?!
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You were supposed to tell me!
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: I'm married! I have kids!
dialog: 
dialog: 58
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You thought nobody knew - so maybe you
dialog: could just walk away clean.
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: No! I didn't think HE knew! OKAY?!
dialog: Even - after. I thought it was just -
dialog: massively fouled-up...bad luck. Like -
dialog: God - telling me - something.
dialog: (Anguished)
dialog: I'm there. My mind is going crazy. I
dialog: know the confession won't hold if
dialog: anyone finds out.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: I thought the guy was a whack!
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yeah? Well, he's not.
text: Nunally won't look at Willy. He just sits there, numb.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Is there anything else you can give
dialog: me. Anything that might get us some
dialog: evidence.
text: Nunally shakes his head. Willy grimaces. Goes to the door.
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: I...tried to warn you.
text: Willy stops. Looks back.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You warned me he was smart. You
dialog: didn't warn me you were stupid.
text: Nunally winces. Takes it. Willy feels a little badly. Two
text: guys in a shabby motel room, in terrible trouble.
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: How do we get the confession back in?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: We don't.
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: What are you gonna do?
text: Willy shakes his head. Walks out.
dialog: 
dialog: 59
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY
text: A massive search is under way.
text: Marchand's S.I.D. Team has been doubled, back-up by a dozen
scene_heading: SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES -
text: - passing hand-held metal detectors along the furniture -
text: - taking pictures down from the walls -
text: - turning over mattresses - patting-down every item hanging
dialog: in the closets -
text: - wriggling into crawlspaces - poking into light fixtures
text: recessed into the ceilings -
text: - opening the air-conditioning unit, up on the roof -
text: - ripping out Crawford's high-end home-theater system -
text: - taking apart the Porsche in the garage.
text: Willy paces the edges of the action, restless, edgy.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER
text: Willy stops in the doorway - watching a DEPUTY shut the
text: stainless-steel freezer, open a wired-glass cabinet and poke
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Shake the boxes.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: The cereal boxes - shake 'em. And
text: there's a chicken in the freezer.
dialog: Thaw it out, check inside.
text: The Deputy stares like he's nuts. Willy doesn't blink. The
text: Deputy goes to shake the boxes, eyes on Willy: okay?
text: Willy nods. Moves on.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - LATER
text: Hours have passed.
dialog: 
dialog: 60
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Willy steps out of the front door, because he's going stir-
text: crazy inside. Stands watching two TECHS walk the lawn and
text: flower-beds with metal detectors.
text: He notices, past the S.I.D. vans and Sheriff's Dept. black-
text: and-whites parked in the driveway:
text: Nunally, in his parked car, across the street.
text: He meets Willy's eyes. Worried.
text: Willy can't give him any news. So he pretends he didn't see
text: the question in Nunally's eyes, looks away. Takes a breath,
text: turns and goes back in to work.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DUSK
text: It's getting dark out. Techs pack equipment cases, carry
text: them out. The place is a disaster area.
text: Marchand watches Willy pace the living room.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: The garage? Washer-dryer?
speaker_heading: MARCHAND
dialog: And the tool shed, and the roof, and
text: the H.V.A.C. ducts.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: What about the door frames? The
dialog: floors?
speaker_heading: MARCHAND
dialog: What did he do: rip open a door frame,
text: hide the gun inside and re-plaster the
dialog: wall before SWAT showed up?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: What about the neighbors' property?
dialog: He could have thrown it over the
text: hedges.
speaker_heading: MARCHAND
dialog: We checked.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: He might have passed it off to
dialog: somebody, Willy. Had an accomplice,
text: waiting, out the back.
text: Willy shakes his head, grim. Pacing.
dialog: 
dialog: 61
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: This isn't an accomplice sort of guy.
text: He slows. Looking across the room at the big Rube Goldberg
text: device. As he moves toward it:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: This is a...guy who likes to show off.
text: He examines the intricate workings, eyes travelling the
text: clutter of metal and wires and motors.
text: Checks Marchand - who shakes his head.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: MARCHAND
dialog: I'm sure.
text: Willy grimaces. Fuming, relentless:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: It's a physical object. It can't just
dialog: vanish. We're missing something -
text: some step in the story.
text: He begins walking through the crime, "the stations of the
text: cross" - re-enacting it, starting from the front door,
text: methodical, reciting it to himself:
speaker_heading: WILLY
text: The neighbor sees her get home. He's
text: already inside. She lets herself in.
text: A minute or two later: blood-pattern
text: says she's standing over there - he's
dialog: somewhere around here.
text: Willy stands where Crawford was. Raises a finger-gun.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Boom.
text: As Willy goes to where Jennifer fell:
speaker_heading: MARCHAND
text: But then he carries her back there.
dialog: Why?
text: Willy walks along the path defined by the drops of blood:
dialog: 
dialog: 62
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Because he's gonna need time. To
text: confess. When she's alone with the
dialog: cop.
text: Willy stops in the alcove, looking down at the dried blood,
text: the discarded paramedic-supply-wrappers.
speaker_heading: MARCHAND
text: Neighbor comes to the door.
text: Willy nods, comes out - crosses to the foyer:
speaker_heading: WILLY
text: Crawford shouts, "Leave us alone" and
text: fires three more rounds: boom-boom-
dialog: boom.
speaker_heading: MARCHAND
dialog: So everybody knows he's dangerous -
dialog: and she might still be alive.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: So they'll call the Negotiator.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Now he's got about ten minutes.
text: And that's it. He stands there with the imaginary gun in his
text: hand. Looking around. Trying to think like Crawford.
dialog: He can't.
speaker_heading: MARCHAND
dialog: I'm sorry, Willy.
dialog: Willy won't respond - because accepting the apology means
dialog: admitting he's got nothing left.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LATER
text: It's night. The house is empty. Except for Willy, turning
text: on lights as he gets to each room, turning them off as he
dialog: leaves.
speaker_heading: WILLY (V.O.)
dialog: Do you dare stay out?
dialog: Do you dare go in?
text: Studying framed photos: Jennifer - now and then with Crawford -
dialog: in Italy, Bermuda, Colorado. Always a bit posed and formal
dialog: when they're together.
dialog: 
dialog: 63
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY (V.O.)
dialog: And IF you go in -
dialog: Should you turn left or right?
dialog: Or right and three-quarters?
dialog: Or maybe not quite.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - BATHROOM - SOON AFTER
text: Checking the contents of the medicine cabinet.
speaker_heading: WILLY (V.O.)
dialog: You can get so confused that you'll
dialog: start in to race,
text: Down long wiggled roads at break-
dialog: necking pace
text: No longer really looking for the gun. He's looking for
dialog: insight. Contact. A way in.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - DRESSING ROOM - SOON AFTER
text: Willy wanders through Jennifer's spacious dressing room.
speaker_heading: WILLY (V.O.)
text: And grind on for miles across weirdish
dialog: wild space,
dialog: Headed I fear, toward a most useless
dialog: place.
text: He idly surveys the vanity, cluttered with cosmetics, skin-
text: care products. Lifts her perfume, sniffs.
speaker_heading: WILLY (V.O.)
dialog: The Waiting Place...
dialog: For people just waiting.
text: Waiting for a train to go
dialog: Or a bus to come, or a plane to go
text: Notices a storage box on the floor, left partly-open in the
text: search. He shifts the lid aside.
speaker_heading: WILLY (V.O.)
dialog: Or the mail to come, or the rain to go
dialog: Or the phone to ring, or the snow to
dialog: snow
text: A high-school yearbook. An old photo album. A teddy bear.
text: A snow-globe. A well-worn book by Dr. Seuss.
dialog: 
dialog: 64
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY (V.O.)
dialog: Or waiting around for a Yes or No
dialog: Or waiting for their hair to grow.
text: Everyone is just waiting.
text: Willy stares down at the souvenirs of a lost life.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - I.C.U. - NIGHT
text: The room is dim, and silent except for the hiss-click of the
text: respirator, the monotonous beep of the heart monitor.
speaker_heading: WILLY (V.O.)
dialog: Waiting for the fish to bite
dialog: Or waiting for wind to fly a kite
dialog: Or waiting around for Friday night
dialog: Or waiting perhaps for their Uncle
dialog: Jake
text: Jennifer Crawford lies with her head wrapped in gauze, eyes
text: shut, plastic tubing down her throat held in place with tape.
text: Willy sits beside her bed, reading Dr. Seuss:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Or a pot to boil, or a Better Break
text: Or a string of pearls, or a pair of
dialog: pants
dialog: Or a wig with curls...
dialog: Or Another Chance.
text: He stops reading a moment. Watching her:
speaker_heading: RESIDENT (O.S.)
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Willy turns. A work-weary RESIDENT comes past him to check
text: the I.V.'s and monitors. He's about Willy's age.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I heard it might - help - if somebody
dialog: talked to her.
speaker_heading: RESIDENT
dialog: Who told you that?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: (Reluctantly)
text: The man who shot her.
text: The RESIDENT looks up at Willy - who shrugs, uncomfortable.
dialog: 
dialog: 65
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Is there any chance...she might come
dialog: out of this?
speaker_heading: RESIDENT
dialog: Are you a member of the family?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: (Getting out ID)
dialog: Sorry. I'm with the District
dialog: Attorney's office.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: We don't have any other witnesses.
speaker_heading: RESIDENT
text: This woman had a bullet plow through
dialog: her brain.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I know. But you hear about people
text: waking up from comas. After everybody
dialog: said pull the plug - they wake up.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: You hear stuff like that all the time.
speaker_heading: RESIDENT
dialog: You hear about Elvis and Aliens, too.
dialog: All the time.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: It's not impossible, though. Is it?
dialog: I mean - why else are you keeping her
dialog: like this?
text: Beat. The Resident sighs.
speaker_heading: RESIDENT
dialog: No. It's not impossible. But even if
dialog: she did, she might not remember how to
dialog: talk - let alone anything about how
dialog: she was shot.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: When I was here alone before, she
dialog: moved a little.
speaker_heading: RESIDENT
dialog: Are you just going to keep asking the
dialog: same question in different ways until
dialog: you hear the answer you want?
dialog: Beat.
dialog: 
dialog: 66
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: That's how it works with the law.
speaker_heading: RESIDENT
dialog: I knew I should have gone to law
dialog: school.
text: Willy watches the Resident go out. Then he looks back down
text: at Jennifer. Listening to the machines.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY
text: Willy wanders. Tina, the assistant, waits in the doorway.
text: He's trying to conceal the fact that he's on a fishing
dialog: expedition.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: So this is all exactly how he left it.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Yes.
text: Browses a wall of framed photos: Crawford at crash sites,
dialog: universities, engineering test-labs - awards, certificates,
dialog: articles from industry publications lauding Crawford as the
dialog: Go-To-Guy for investigating mechanical failures of aircraft.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: And he was - distraught.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: He was drinking. The past few weeks.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: But he was working on this.
text: He stands over unfinished Rube Goldberg device. Tools laid
text: out on the work table - meticulous, organized.
speaker_heading: WILLY
text: All distraught and everything.
dialog: It's not evidence.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Do you want coffee. He said I should
dialog: ask.
text: Willy turns, a little rattled. Beat.
dialog: 
dialog: 67
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Tell him I said no thank you.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: The room where Jennifer and Nunally met. Cleaned-up now,
text: anonymous, empty. Willy stands looking at it.
text: There's nothing to see. He grimaces, nods - heads out, past
text: the ASSISTANT MANAGER waiting in the doorway.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
text: As Willy comes out of the room - he slows, noticing the
text: little gray plastic surveillance-camera-ball in the ceiling.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: How long do you keep the tapes?
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT MANAGER
dialog: A month.
text: Willy considers it. He's got nothing else to try.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Can I get a copy of October 9th?
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT MANAGER
dialog: I'll have it for you Friday.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I'm kind of under the gun here.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT MANAGER
dialog: We're short-staffed tonight and
dialog: tomorrow.
text: Beat. Seeing Willy's confusion:
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT MANAGER
dialog: Thanksgiving?
text: Willy nods, trying to pretend he hasn't forgotten:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Right. Okay.
dialog: 
dialog: 68

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GARDNER HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER
text: A faux-Tudor Hancock Park dining room. Wealthy, but lived
dialog: in.
dialog: JUDGE LEWIS GARDNER, your basic Henry Fonda/Jimmy Stewart-
text: type patriarch, carves a turkey at the head of a long table,
text: wearing a worn and gravy-splattered apron. Platters
text: circulate in both directions among Nikki's older siblings
text: (BURTON and SANDRA), their spouses, their children.
text: Willy sits next to Nikki, who is high-stylish despite the
text: fact that she's dressed "casual."
speaker_heading: GARDNER
dialog: White or dark, Willy?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Anything is fine, your honor.
speaker_heading: GARDNER
dialog: I'm off-duty, you can call me Lew.
text: While Gardner piles turkey on a plate and passes it:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: So - is everyone in this family
dialog: involved in the law?
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: Well, Nikki's not.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Ha ha.
dialog: (To Willy:)
dialog: Burton's a counsel for Sierra Club,
dialog: and Sandra's ACLU - so they use the
dialog: holidays as an opportunity to give me
dialog: a hard time, because I can buy and
dialog: sell them.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: We're not actually for sale, Nick.
text: Nikki gives Willy a did-I-tell-you? look.
speaker_heading: GARDNER
dialog: Nicole decided early-on that black
dialog: sheep was the most effective role in
dialog: which to distinguish herself from her
dialog: siblings.
dialog: 
dialog: 69
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: You know of any other family in
dialog: America where the corporate lawyer
dialog: who's going to make partner by thirty-
dialog: five is the "black sheep"?
speaker_heading: GARDNER
dialog: Well - you may be lost beyond
dialog: recovery, but maybe we can still
dialog: convince Willy that defending giant
dialog: corporations against injured citizens
dialog: is not the best use of his skills.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I don't think so, sir.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: It's where the money is.
speaker_heading: GARDNER
dialog: (Scolding mildly)
dialog: I believe that phrase refers to banks.
dialog: And it was coined by a thief.
text: Beat. Willy remains polite, but won't back down.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Times have changed.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: (To Willy)
dialog: You don't have to do this.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I don't mind; I get this kind of thing
dialog: now and then.
dialog: (to Gardner)
dialog: Almost always from people with money.
speaker_heading: GARDNER
dialog: Appearances can be deceiving, Willy.
dialog: I grew up with eight brothers and
dialog: sisters on a farm up in Fresno, and I
dialog: promise you I saw my share of hard
dialog: times.
text: Willy considers his options.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: My mom OD'd fairly frequently, so they
dialog: put me in a Group Home. My younger
dialog: sister is dead and my older brother is
dialog: doing twenty-five-to-life.
dialog: 
dialog: 70
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Awkward silence.
speaker_heading: GARDNER
dialog: You win.
text: Beat. Willy looks down, begins to eat again.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I usually do.
speaker_heading: GARDNER
dialog: (Gently)
dialog: Yes. I see that.
speaker_heading: BURTON
dialog: I don't know if you will against the
dialog: wife-shooter, though.
text: The click of silverware.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: Whoops.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Nice, Burton.
text: Beat. Willy looks up at Burton, steady. Shrugs.
speaker_heading: WILLY
text: It's not over 'til it's over.
speaker_heading: BURTON
dialog: That looked pretty over.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Anyway, Willy's been taken off the
dialog: case.
speaker_heading: GARDNER
dialog: It might not seem like it now, but
dialog: that's a blessing in disguise, Willy.
text: Willy nods. Beat. To Nikki, uncomfortable:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I wasn't.
text: Nikki looks at Willy.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: What?
dialog: 
dialog: 71
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
text: Taken off.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: That...doesn't make any sense.
dialog: Lobruto has to do some kind of damage
dialog: control -
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I asked him not to.
text: Silence. Nikki is staring at him. Angry.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: You are really stupid, did you know
dialog: that?
text: Willy doesn't know how to handle this; everyone else tries to
text: be polite, eating and pretending not to notice.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I'm - getting new evidence -
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Where? The Evidence Store?! Oh,
dialog: that's right - they open early the day
dialog: after Thanksgiving. You're gonna be
dialog: fine!
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Did it ever occur to you I might be
dialog: good enough to still win?!
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Who cares?!
dialog: Win what?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: The man shot his -
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: You wanted corporate, right?! You
dialog: wanted to play in the big leagues?!
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yeah, I'm just -
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: You go to all that trouble getting
dialog: yourself in - and then you just pay no
dialog: attention to wh-
dialog: 
dialog: 72
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Look - I'm sorry - can we not talk
dialog: about this here?!
text: Nikki stops. Refusing to look around. Ashamed at losing
text: control, turns back to her food:
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Thank you.
text: Everyone eats in silence a moment - then Nikki tosses down
dialog: her napkin:
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: I need to talk with you.
text: She gets up and walks out of the room. With an awkward
text: glance around, Willy excuses himself and follows her.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GARDNER HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell you -
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Did you hear me, when I said Bob
dialog: wanted you gone as soon as this thing
dialog: broke?! Did you hear me say I went
text: out on a limb to convince him -
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Wouldn't it be better than damage
dialog: control if I actually turn it around?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: And what if you don't?
text: Willy has no answer. He doesn't think that way. And she
text: sees that. She sees a young man from Oklahoma, in way over
text: his head. Desperate to get through:
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: You don't get it at all, do you?! You
dialog: pulled a stunt to get yourself this
dialog: job. Fine: you're a hot-shot!

speaker_heading: NIKKI (cont'd)

dialog: And you just put yourself head-to-head

dialog: Silence. Shaken:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: What am I supposed to do?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: We told the man you're getting on a
dialog: plane to Chicago, Tuesday.
text: Painful silence.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yeah. Okay.
text: Nikki watches him dealing with it, sympathetic. The
text: impossible feelings always running under the surface for them
text: have developed a darker, aching tone. If anything, stronger.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I think maybe I'm gonna go now.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: All right.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Call if you want.
text: He nods. Neither one moves. Judge Gardner enters cautiously
text: from the dining room - breaking the spell.
text: Nikki nods goodbye to Willy, and goes out quickly without
text: meeting her father's eye. Awkward pause.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I've got some work to do.
dialog: I need to call a cab.
text: Gardner nods respectfully, but doesn't move quite yet.
text: Studying the torn-up young man.
speaker_heading: GARDNER
dialog: You know what nobody understands about
dialog: certain kinds of underpaid public
dialog: service work? Now and then you get to
dialog: put a fucking stake in a bad guy's
dialog: heart. We're not supposed to talk
dialog: about that when we visit a third-grade
dialog: class on Career Day, and it doesn't
dialog: get you very far into the country-club
dialog: locker room - but it's hard to beat
dialog: when you actually get to do it.
dialog: 
dialog: 74
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Willy looks at the kindly old judge, a little surprised.
text: Gardner shrugs: my two cents. He goes to a side-table, finds
dialog: the Yellow Pages.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Empty. Dark. Willy lets himself in.
text: He looks for the light-switch - finds only a complex
text: computerized dimmer-panel. He tries it.
text: Accent lights come on, buried in the living room planters.
text: He can't get any other pre-sets to work.
text: The crime scene is creepy, lit like that. The dried blood is
text: black. Shadows stretch up the walls, strange.
text: Willy grimaces, moves through it - sees another panel by the
text: French doors to the garden. Goes over -
text: - and jumps back, startled -
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Shit!
text: - by Nunally, on the other side of the glass.
text: Catching his breath, Willy stares. He unlocks the French
text: doors and Nunally steps in, uneasy, haggard.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: The hell are you doing here?
text: Nunally looks around - taking a pint bottle from his overcoat
text: pocket, uncapping it.
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: We need to talk.
text: He drinks, then offers the bottle. Willy hesitates, takes
text: it. As he drinks:
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: We have to find the gun.
text: Willy winces at the liquor and the remark, hands back the
dialog: bottle.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Thank you, Professor Einstein. It
dialog: would also be good to find a couple of
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 75
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY (cont'd)
dialog: eyewitnesses. If one could be the
dialog: Dalai Lama, it would be even better.
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: No - Willy: we need to find the gun.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I've had three different teams here -
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: He didn't leave between the shooting
dialog: and when we took him out in cuffs.
dialog: The gun is here.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So we have to find it.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Well - we can't! You want to move on?
text: Nunally tosses something from an inside pocket of the coat -
text: - Willy catches it. A Heckler &amp; Koch nine-millimeter in a
text: plastic bag.
text: Willy stares down at it. Then at Nunally, who holds up: a
text: bullet, deformed by impact.
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: There's a guy in the Evidence Room,
dialog: owes me a favor. Well - it's not so
dialog: much a favor as I know stuff about
dialog: him. He can trade this for the bullet
dialog: from Jennifer, give us a ballistic
dialog: match.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: It's a crime.
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: So who's gonna get away with a crime -
dialog: this asshole, or us?
text: Willy sighs. Tosses the gun back.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Go home.
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: What else have you got?!
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I'll find a way.
dialog: 
dialog: 76
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
dialog: No you won't.
text: Willy watches Nunally stalk out through the big, strangely-
text: lit room. The front door opens, and slams.
text: A little worried, Willy takes a deep breath. Gets to work.
dialog: He still has three days to break this open.
text: Walking through the crime again.
text: Playing it out in his mind. Standing in different places,
dialog: getting different perspectives.
text: Willy stands in the alcove. Looking around.
text: There's something here. But he can't get it.
text: His eye falls on the Rube Goldberg device. Moves closer,
text: peering into the mechanism.
text: Turns away: no gun. But now he's facing the big wooden bowl
text: of ball-bearings, sitting out in the middle of the room on
text: the coffee table.
text: Hide in plain sight.
text: He walks over - pushes his fingers in, feels around.
text: Nope. He sighs. Takes a ball-bearing, rolls it in his hand.
text: Goes to the device - drops the ball in the slot.
text: The machine is amazing. The ball rolls and leaps and
text: clatters - lights flash, elevators rise and fall, at one
text: point the ball lifts on a jet of compressed air - then it
text: spirals out of sight and reappears somewhere unexpected -
text: - until at the end the ball suddenly catapults out and sails
text: across the living room -
text: - to land neatly back in the bowl on the coffee table.
text: Willy grimaces. This guy is really good.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MARCHAND'S OFFICE - S.I.D. - SUNDAY AFTERNOON
text: A mess of courtroom exhibits, copies of evidence, lists,
text: depositions, photos, diagrams, take-out food containers and
text: coffee cups.
dialog: 
dialog: 77
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Marchand surveys it. The bleary end of a long day - sifting
text: clues, dead-ends.
speaker_heading: MARCHAND
dialog: Willy. There's nothing here.
text: Willy has barely slept all weekend. He shakes his head,
text: reviewing the hotel surveillance tapes on a VCR/TV, stubborn.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Guns don't just walk out of crime
dialog: scenes.
text: Marchand waves copies of Crawford's evidence - stills printed
text: from home-video Dick took at a hostage negotiation: Nunally
text: doing his job, his methods, his routine.
speaker_heading: MARCHAND
dialog: Two months before he shot his wife,
dialog: this guy had his investigator watching
dialog: the cop at work. He knew exactly how
dialog: it would go down - and he didn't leave
dialog: any loose ends.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Then what is this:
text: Willy uses the remote. On the TV, in black-and-white:
text: Jennifer and Nunally come out of their room and head for the
text: pool - indistinct figures zip jerkily in and out of rooms on
dialog: fast-forward -
text: - until he slows it: Crawford comes to let himself in.
speaker_heading: WILLY
text: Hotel surveillance. From that day.
dialog: He was there. Why?
text: Marchand watches over Willy's shoulder. Shrugs.
speaker_heading: MARCHAND
dialog: Had to see it for himself.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: See what? They were out at the pool.
speaker_heading: MARCHAND
text: The unmade bed. Her panties. Man's
text: gonna shoot his wife in the head, he
dialog: needs to get himself all worked up.
text: Willy stares at the grainy black-and-white figure emerging
text: from the room, walking away down the corridor. Unconvinced:
dialog: 
dialog: 78
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yeah. Worked up.
text: Marchand gets his jacket, pulls it on.
speaker_heading: MARCHAND
dialog: Willy, go home. Tomorrow you go back
dialog: into court and take your lumps - then
dialog: you start your cushy new life, and you
dialog: forget all about this one.
dialog: (Hoping to get a smile:)
dialog: And then you can lend me money and
dialog: shit.
text: Willy says nothing. Runs the tape back and then slow-motions
text: it forward again.
text: Marchand goes out. Leaving Willy alone, watching Crawford.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WILLY'S APARTMENT - VERY LATE THAT NIGHT
text: Willy stands over crime scene photos and diagrams spread out
text: on his narrow futon. "Walking the scene" again, on paper.
text: The whole apartment is an array of law books, notes,
text: exhibits, marked-up depositions.
text: He's staring at evidence he's already stared at a hundred
dialog: times.
text: He grinds the palms of his hands into his eye sockets, a dull
text: moan rising into a yell -
text: - as he sweeps everything off his bed in a storm of paper -
text: throwing books - tearing up printouts - pulling out drawers,
text: emptying them, smashing them on the desk -
text: - yelling in a frenzy until his throat is hoarse, his shabby
text: garage apartment is trashed, and he's sitting, exhausted, in
dialog: his chair.
text: There's a knock on the door.
text: Willy frowns, checking the clock: it's two-thirty a.m. He
dialog: goes to open it -
text: - revealing Nunally, standing in the darkness, a haunted
text: shadow of the boyish confident cop we met making love to
dialog: Jennifer Crawford.
dialog: 
dialog: 79
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NUNALLY
text: It's done. In the tool shed: taped to
text: the blade, inside the lawn-mower.
text: Before Willy can say anything - Nunally walks away.
text: Willy doesn't move. Watching the tormented cop disappear
text: down the alley.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - BULLPEN - THE NEXT MORNING
text: Willy - in a clean suit and crisp suit, carrying his
text: briefcase - hurries through, paying no attention to the
text: SECRETARIES and OTHER D.D.A.s who watch like he's on his way
text: to his own execution.
text: At his office door, he gestures for Mona to come in with him.
text: Surprised, she gets up - taking with her an envelope with a
text: messenger-receipt taped to the front.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WILLY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Mona watches Willy shut the door behind her.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yeah. Maybe.
dialog: (Hesitates)
dialog: Can I ask you to do something for me
dialog: this morning?
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Write down your cell number.
dialog: (As she does)
dialog: Once my trial is in session, wait
dialog: outside. I might call - and just hang
dialog: up. If I do, I want you to come into
dialog: court and whisper to me that we got a
dialog: tip about the murder weapon.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: You found it?
dialog: Beat.
dialog: 
dialog: 80
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I haven't decided yet.
text: Mona studies Willy - then accepts it's don't-ask-don't-tell,
text: hands him her number. Willy nods, grateful.
text: Turning for the door, she remembers the envelope in her hand.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Oh: this came for you.
text: He takes it, and as she leaves, checks the return address:
dialog: Wooton Sims.
text: Willy grimaces, opens it. Inside are an airline ticket to
text: Chicago - first class - and a handwritten note, on Wooton
dialog: Sims stationery:
dialog: We only win the favor of the Gods
dialog: by making a sacrifice
dialog: See you tomorrow
dialog: - Nikki
text: He stands in his empty office, considering the ticket and the
dialog: note.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. COURTHOUSE - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
text: Willy steps off the elevator, into a crowd of REPORTERS AND
text: SPECTATORS outside the courtroom.
text: He's startled for a moment: it's worse than he expected - the
text: dense buzz of talk in the marble corridor and all the eyes
text: tracking him like he's walking into an arena - a freakshow
dialog: performer -
text: - but he doesn't slow, ignoring the comments and questions,
dialog: avoiding eye contact -
text: - until he sees Nunally by the courtroom doors, his eyes
text: fixed on Willy.
text: Willy meets Nunally's gaze...moving on, giving back nothing.
text: Nunally watches Willy disappear into the courtroom, stares at
text: the closing doors - uncertain, on edge. Lost, no matter
dialog: which way this goes.
dialog: 
dialog: 81
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - SOON AFTER
text: Mr. Gifford, the Crawford's neighbor, is on the stand. Willy
text: questions him, standing by the Prosecution Table.
text: Behind him, the court is standing-room-only. REPORTERS,
text: SKETCH ARTISTS, SPECTATORS. Nunally, sitting near the front.
text: Lobruto, standing at the back.
text: Crawford writes intently on a legal pad, filling pages with
text: dense scribble.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: So - between the time you heard the
dialog: first gunshot and called 911, and the
dialog: time of Mr. Crawford's arrest - you
dialog: had the Crawford house in view?
speaker_heading: GIFFORD
dialog: Yes. I was very concerned about
dialog: Jennifer. She was a lovely woman.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: No one but Thomas Crawford came in or
dialog: out?
speaker_heading: GIFFORD
dialog: That's correct.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Thank you, Mr. Gifford. No further
dialog: questions.
speaker_heading: JUDGE ROBINSON
dialog: Mr. Crawford?
text: Crawford glances up at the Judge. Then at Gifford, as if
text: he's just noticed him up there. Beat. Without getting up:
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Did you see the guy run out the back
dialog: door?
speaker_heading: GIFFORD
dialog: What..."guy"?
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: The other guy. The one who shot my
dialog: wife. Did you see him run out the
text: back of the house, carrying the gun?
text: Willy closes his eyes. Gifford grimaces.
dialog: 
dialog: 82
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIFFORD
text: I couldn't see the back of the house.
dialog: (Trying to salvage it:)
dialog: I believe...the police went around
dialog: back when they arrived.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: No further questions.
dialog: Willy immediately stands:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Re-direct, your honor.
text: But Crawford is standing too - with his handful of pages:
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: I've also written a motion to dismiss.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Objection - I'm on re-direct!
text: The Judge hesitates. Both men standing.
speaker_heading: JUDGE ROBINSON
dialog: On what grounds, Mr. Crawford?
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: The prosecutor doesn't have any actual
dialog: evidence.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I'm in the middle of presenting -
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: All of his witnesses are going to
dialog: testify to the same facts: that my
dialog: wife was shot and that I was,
dialog: tragically, in the house at the time
dialog: ...a witness - and, in a way, a victim
dialog: myself. I'll stipulate to Mr.
dialog: Slocum's entire witness list right
dialog: now, a request a directed verdict or
dialog: dismissal, per California versus
dialog: Collier, 1982, and the Appellate court
dialog: decision, v. Watrus, 486.19.
text: Willy stares at Crawford, stunned. As the Judge reluctantly
text: nods to the Bailiff to collect Crawford's pages and opens a
dialog: law book:
dialog: 
dialog: 83
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Your legal skills seem to have
dialog: improved over the long weekend, Mr.
dialog: Crawford.
text: While the Judge checks the citations, Crawford glances at
text: Willy. Amused.
text: Beat. Willy looks down - reaches into his briefcase, moves
text: his cell-phone out from under some papers. To where he can
dialog: get it easily.
text: Looks back up at Crawford. Smiles slightly.
speaker_heading: JUDGE ROBINSON
dialog: Mr. Slocum?
text: Willy and Crawford turn to the Judge.
speaker_heading: JUDGE ROBINSON
dialog: Have you got any new evidence?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: May I have a moment, your honor?
text: The Judge nods.
text: Willy nods down. Trying to focus. He's got nothing, and
text: everyone in the room knows it. He can hear it, he can feel
text: it. There's a restless, hungry edge to the crowded
dialog: courtroom.
text: He stares into his open briefcase: the cell phone.
text: Next to it: the first class ticket and Nikki's note.
text: Willy glances back at the gallery. Nunally's eyes burn into
text: him. In the back: Lobruto frowns, concerned.
speaker_heading: JUDGE ROBINSON
dialog: Mr. Slocum?
text: Willy turns back to his briefcase. He breathes. Press the
text: MENU button - selects SPEED DIAL.
text: On the tiny screen, a list of names. Selected: MONA/CELL.
dialog: 
dialog: 84
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. COURTHOUSE - CORRIDOR - THE SAME TIME
text: Mona sits on a bench, a few steps down the corridor from the
text: courtroom doors. Cell phone in her hand.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Willy stands at the Prosecution Table. Hearing his own
dialog: pulse.
text: Crawford studies Willy, curious.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Your honor? Can we signal the
dialog: prosecutor from here on planet Earth?
text: Willy's fingertip hovers over the cell phone keypad. Press,
text: and a path is chosen. Possibly for life.
dialog: Next to the cell-phone, the ticket and the note. See you
dialog: tomorrow.
text: Nunally sits forward. Lobruto is watching intently.
text: Willy doesn't move.
speaker_heading: JUDGE ROBINSON
dialog: Mr. Slocum? Now or never.
text: Willy won't look up.
text: Nunally stares, agonized.
text: Willy grimaces slightly, as if he feels his soul burning up,
text: turning to ash and blowing away -
text: - nods, closing the cell phone, sliding it under Nikki's
text: note. Shuts the briefcase. Looks at the Judge.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I have no further evidence at this
dialog: time, your honor.
text: Crawford begins to smile.
text: Lobruto looks down. A buzz rises in the gallery -
text: - as Nunally gets up, furious - stalks to the doors, slams
dialog: out.
dialog: 
dialog: 85
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Judge Robinson looks at Willy a moment - then at Crawford,
text: who has been waiting, calm and polite. Very reluctantly:
speaker_heading: JUDGE ROBINSON
dialog: Motion to dismiss is granted.
text: Uproar. The Judge bangs his gavel -
speaker_heading: JUDGE ROBINSON
dialog: Order! The jury is released, with our
dialog: apologies -
text: - practically shouting over the chaos - REPORTERS hastily
text: heading for the doors, pulling out cell phones -
speaker_heading: JUDGE ROBINSON
dialog: - and the Defendant is free to go.
text: Crawford gives the Judge a gentlemanly bow of the head.
text: Willy begins to pack his papers into the briefcase. Refusing
dialog: to look up.
dialog: The Judge and the Bailiff might be saying other things, but
text: no one is listening - SPECTATORS swarm up the aisles, out to
text: the hallway - and the Court starts to close down.
text: Crawford comes over to Willy, holds out a hand.
text: Willy looks him in the eye. Doesn't move. Crawford shrugs.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Even a broken clock gets to be right
dialog: twice a day.
text: He winks, and heads up the aisle.
text: As Willy watches Crawford go out the doors into a clamor of
text: lenses, hand-held mikes, white-hot halogen glare and flashes -
text: - he hears a buzzing noise. Looks down at his briefcase,
text: moves the papers aside: his cell phone is vibrating.
text: Willy stares at it, as if he'd forgotten the thing could be
text: used for an incoming call.
text: The caller ID reads: WOOTON SIMS. He picks up -
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
dialog: 
dialog: 86
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WOOTON SIMS - NIKKI'S OFFICE - THE SAME TIME
text: Nikki sits at her beautiful desk with stellar views out the
text: windows behind her.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Hey, you.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: (It's an effort)
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: What did you think - I wasn't keeping
dialog: tabs?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I don't know what I thought.
text: Awkward silence. She tries to get past it:
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Listen: what do you say I take you out
dialog: tonight and get you completely
dialog: trashed? Tomorrow's just a travel da-
text: - there's a gun shot outside the courtroom.
text: Willy turns. Shocked. Screams and shouting in the corridor.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Hang on -
text: We move with Willy as he shuts the phone and heads for the
text: doors - faster, pushing out -
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. COURTHOUSE - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
text: - into the echoing chaos of the corridor - trying to move in
dialog: the crowd -
text: - shoving through to where people are yelling and clustered
text: around a figure lying on the floor.
text: Willy pushes closer, until he catches glimpses of:
text: Nunally. Lying on the marble floor. His gun in his lifeless
text: fingers. Blood all over, from his head.
text: Willy stops pushing. Won't let himself look away - the
text: screams and commotion around him retreating into a numb blur.
dialog: 
dialog: 87
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Then suddenly Willy looks up - as if he's been called -
text: - to find Crawford, standing very still, in the crowd, on the
text: other side of the body. Everyone else is moving, talking,
text: gawking at the body or averting their eyes -
text: - except Crawford. He's looking straight at Willy.
text: Pleased. Triumphant.
text: Willy stares into Crawford's eyes.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATE THAT NIGHT
text: The life support system clicks and hisses and beeps.
text: Jennifer is curled into a fetal position, despite the tubes
dialog: and wires.
text: Willy sits by her bed. Still in his suit from court, the
text: jacket off, the tie loose.
text: He's been there a while. But now he speaks.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Your husband said something...that I
dialog: can't seem to shake loose of. He said
dialog: I'm a winner.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: And he's right. I can't lose. I
dialog: can't stand people who lose.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: I may have been working so hard to put
dialog: some distance between me and...people
dialog: like you - that maybe I messed up. I
dialog: don't know if did anything wrong.
dialog: Or what I should have done. I really
dialog: don't know, any more...what I'm
dialog: supposed to do.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: But I feel like I let you down.
dialog: Somehow in the...process. And if I
dialog: did, I'm sorry. That's all. I just -
dialog: I hope you...have...just, some...
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Anyway.
text: He feels stupid. Takes a breath. Looking at her pale,
text: drawn, comatose face.
text: He stands, goes to get his jacket, lying folded on a table by
text: the door. Pulls it on, settles the shoulders, tugs at his
text: cuffs. Gets his briefcase.
dialog: 
dialog: 88
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He goes to the door, and as he opens it - he looks back.
dialog: Freezes.
text: Jennifer's eyes are wide open.
text: She's staring at him. Willy stands, breathless, watching
dialog: her.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - LATER
text: Sliding glass doors suck open, Willy walks with the Resident
dialog: from the other night:
speaker_heading: WILLY
text: She was looking at me.
speaker_heading: RESIDENT
dialog: Yeah, I understand -
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: No, she was looking at me.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE UP - JENNIFER'S EYEBALL
text: A beam of light slides across it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: The Resident tucks his flashlight in a pocket, draws a pin
text: from his lapel. Gently sticks Jennifer's cheek. Willy
text: winces, watching.
speaker_heading: WILLY
text: She's reacting.
text: The Resident ignores him. Pricks her forehead - her chin -
text: her big toe. Each time she twitches. He runs his thumb
text: along the sole of Jennifer's bare foot. It arches up.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You see?
speaker_heading: RESIDENT
text: The normal reflex goes downward. Up
dialog: indicates brain trauma.
speaker_heading: WILLY
text: She's in there. She was looking at
dialog: me.
dialog: 
dialog: 89
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The Resident sighs. Sympathetic, but plain:
speaker_heading: RESIDENT
dialog: Sometimes we have to tape their eyes
text: shut. They all move - they make
dialog: sounds, they twitch. You think
text: they're dreaming. But they're not.
dialog: It's just what's left of the system,
text: sending broken signals.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Can we do other tests? Like an M.R.I.
dialog: or something? And I want a coma
dialog: specialist to see her.
speaker_heading: RESIDENT
dialog: You're not authorized to order tes-
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I'll get you authorization. First
dialog: thing tomorrow.
text: The Resident studies Willy. Reluctantly:
speaker_heading: RESIDENT
dialog: You get the paperwork, I'll do what I
dialog: can.
text: Willy nods, grateful. As the Resident heads out, Willy sits
text: by Jennifer's bed - protective, intent.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - LOBBY - THE NEXT MORNING
text: Crawford comes in through the lobby: rested, well-dressed. A
text: free man. He slows, surprised -
text: - seeing Willy come off the elevators. Willy hasn't left
text: Jennifer's bedside. He's in the same suit and carrying his
text: briefcase from the courthouse.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Mr. Slocum.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Just...visiting.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: This isn't like you at all.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: No?
dialog: 
dialog: 90
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: You haven't got anything to gain.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Oh - right. That's my weak spot.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Ever think about what yours might be?
dialog: Your flaw?
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Of course I have.
dialog: (Leans in)
dialog: The truth about me is, Willy...I'm
dialog: really not very nice.
text: Willy nods. Concealing the ace up his sleeve.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You sure do know a lot, though. Got
dialog: everybody all figured out, everything
dialog: set up, like one of your contraptions.
dialog: Then you just sit back and watch it
dialog: all fall right where you want it to.
dialog: Must be kind of...boring. At that
dialog: point.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Not an ounce of sympathy, Willy?
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Imagine it - imagine she was yours.
dialog: And you knew you were losing her.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Imagine days. Weeks. Going through
text: her desk. Her purse. Her closet.
text: Alone. Staring at her clothes. Her
dialog: shoes. Knowing this is what it will
dialog: be like. After.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Do you have any idea how hard it was
dialog: to go on living - with her - every
dialog: day, knowing?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: But you had to, right? You needed
dialog: time to set it all up...your "crime of
dialog: passion."
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: There are many kinds of passion,
dialog: Willy.
dialog: 
dialog: 91
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yeah. There are.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: So - thank you.
text: Crawford frowns. Starting to feel wary. Willy sees it.
dialog: Enjoys it.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: For sharing your wisdom. All your
dialog: little helpful bits of information.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: You were right.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: About...?
speaker_heading: WILLY
text: Talking to her.
text: Beat. Willy winks. He goes past Crawford and out the doors.
text: Crawford doesn't move - except to turn and watch Willy.
text: Uncertain, for the first time since we've met him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WOOTON SIMS - RECEPTION - LATER THAT MORNING
text: Willy - still unshaved, unslept, in yesterday's suit - comes
text: off the elevator, fishing out ID as he passes a RECEPTIONIST:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Hi, I'm just -
text: - going directly to the key-card slot by the glass double-
text: doors to the rest of the floor. He swipes his card and pulls
dialog: the handle -
text: - but it stays locked. Willy swipes his card again. No go.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Excuse me - I'm new, I just started -
dialog: and there's something wrong with my
dialog: card. Can you buzz me in?
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Who are you here to see?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I work here. Willy Slocum. I'm new -
text: He stops, realizing how he must look.
dialog: 
dialog: 92
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Nikki Gardner. Willy Slocum, for
dialog: Nikki Gardner.
text: As he calls in, Willy sees Nikki through the doors - one of
text: a half-dozen ASSOCIATES trailing in the wake of BOB WOOTON.
text: They all carry expensive business luggage, except Wooton -
text: who is powerful, perfectly groomed, and two decades older.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Wait a second - never mind, here she
dialog: is, thank you.
text: Willy goes toward the glass doors as Wooton comes through -
text: nodding deferentially to the boss, semi-apologetic:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Hey...Bob -
dialog: (To Nikki)
dialog: Can I talk to you for a second?
text: Wooton glances back at Nikki, eyes saying: don't take long.
text: She nods as Wooton and the team continue to the elevators -
text: staying back by the glass doors to talk with Willy:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You let him know what happened last
dialog: night?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: I told him.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Great - who do I work with on it while
dialog: you're gone?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: You don't work with anyone.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Nikki: the man has power-of-attorney
dialog: and a health-care proxy, he can
dialog: disconnect her life-support whenever
dialog: he wants. If we don't move fast -
text: Nikki explodes - but quietly, not wanting the team to hear:
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Jesus, Willy, wake up! It's over!
dialog: What is wrong with you - it's first
dialog: year law: that woman could fully
dialog: recover and swear he shot her and it
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 93
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI (cont'd)
dialog: wouldn't matter. Double jeopardy!
dialog: You can't take him back into court!
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I told you - we bring a civil suit -
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: You've got no standing.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: It doesn't have to stick: we just need
dialog: to get a court order for now - to keep
dialog: Crawford from pulling the plug! With
dialog: all the brain-power here, I'm sure
dialog: somebody can come up with a pretext or
dialog: call in a favor. Then we can tie this
dialog: up in court while we arrange a state-
dialog: appointed conservatorship - so we can
dialog: protect her while we fight him on -
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: What's the point, Willy?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: The point?!
text: Willy stares. Because she's drawn a line in the sand. One
text: he already crossed, without truly understanding...and now
text: he's standing out there alone - feeling the sand slither away
text: under his feet.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: This man is going to kill his wife.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: What does that have to do with Wooton
dialog: Sims?
text: Willy just breathes. Vulnerable like we have never seen him
dialog: before.
text: He looks across the big reception area, at Wooton and the
text: team of associates. Some look away.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: I warned you.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: No, this is insane.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: It's what it is.
dialog: 
dialog: 94
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ding! The elevator. Nikki grimaces, frustrated - and sad:
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: I warned you.
text: She starts for the elevators, Willy following -
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You're not really just gonna let this
dialog: happen, are you?!
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Oh I'm supposed to lose my job over
dialog: your problems?!
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: My problems?! Wait a second - this is
dialog: not about my anything any more -
text: Willy grabs Nikki's arm to stop her, turn her around - and
text: she shoves him away, hard, tears welling in her eyes -
text: - Willy letting her go - as the Receptionist quietly calls
dialog: for help -
text: - and Nikki hurries into the waiting elevator. The Associate
text: holding the doors lets them go.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: This is about taking a couple of
dialog: goddamn weeks off to try and save a
dialog: woman's life!
text: The doors begin to close. Willy stands facing the cluster of
text: lawyers in expensive suits, their expressions ranging from
dialog: pity to contempt -
text: - except Nikki, whose eyes are full of shame and guilt and
text: defensive anger.
text: As the doors shut across them.
text: Willy doesn't move. Confused, humiliated, frustrated.
text: He turns when a bunch of OTHER LAWYERS emerge from the
text: offices, ready to act as bouncers. People gawk from behind
text: the glass doors.
text: Beat. Willy holds up his palms.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Don't bother. I got it.
dialog: 
dialog: 95
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He bangs open the paddle-sign on the stairway door, setting
text: off the fire alarms as he stalks out.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WOOTON SIMS - BUILDING STAIRWAY - SOON AFTER
text: Willy runs down the stairs furiously -
text: - the clanging alarm, several floors above now, a little
text: fainter.
text: He suddenly stops - clinging to the railing, bent over. He
text: sways, dizzy, gasping -
text: - backs up until he's against the concrete wall. Presses
text: himself against. Listening to his own ragged breathing.
text: Scared out of his mind.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DUSK
text: Crawford stands by the bed, glancing over a set of forms on a
text: metal clipboard.
text: DR. LUNT, a senior neurologist, and a HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR
text: wait. The machines hiss and click, keeping Jennifer alive.
text: Crawford signs the forms, expressionless.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. COURTHOUSE - THE SAME TIME
text: Willy's walking alongside Judge Robinson, as they leave the
text: building. The Judge is wearing his "civilian clothes."
speaker_heading: JUDGE ROBINSON
dialog: What do the doctors say?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: People wake up out of these things.
speaker_heading: JUDGE ROBINSON
dialog: What did the doctors say, Mr. Slocum?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: They said...there's no way to really
dialog: know. I'm trying to get them to run
dialog: more tests - but I was there, and I'm
dialog: telling you.
dialog: 
dialog: 96
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDGE ROBINSON
dialog: I'm sorry. I have no probable cause
dialog: to issue a court order against Mr.
dialog: Crawford - and he's protected agai-
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: WHAT ABOUT HIS WIFE?! WHAT'S
dialog: PROTECTING HER?!
text: The Judge stops - giving Willy a hard eye: I'm sympathetic,
dialog: but yelling at me is not a smart approach.
text: Willy looks at the Judge a second - hapless, frustrated,
text: scared - then nods and shakes his head and turns away -
text: hurrying off through the homeward-bound crowds.
text: The Judge watches him go. Grimaces.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - KITCHEN - THAT EVENING
text: Crawford is carefully preparing an elegant, solitary meal.
text: Music plays on his state-of-the-art sound system.
text: He stops, noticing a pair of Jennifer's reading glasses,
text: folded up by a note-pad and pen next to the telephone. He
text: picks them up. Stylish, feminine.
text: He goes to the trash, steps on the pedal to flip open the
text: lid, and drops the glasses in.
text: Goes back to cooking.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LOBRUTO HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Lobruto - at the dinner table with his family - looks up,
text: surprised, as the doorbell rings. He excuses himself -
text: - goes to open the door. Willy's outside: apologetic but
text: urgent, near the end of his rope.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I'm sorry - but nobody else seems to
dialog: give a damn that sooner or later this
dialog: guy is gonna finish what he started.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: Have you been home at all today,
dialog: Willy?
dialog: 
dialog: 97
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Willy looks down at himself: he's unshaven, in the same
text: rumpled clothes he wore to court yesterday. Exasperated:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: No - I've been trying to get some-
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: There's a court order out against you.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: A restraining order.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: You were at the hospital? Talking to
dialog: her doctors?
text: Willy nods. Lobruto looks out at the confused, frantic young
dialog: man - truly sorry that he can't help Willy fight his way back
dialog: toward doing some good in this mess.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: Crawford hired a lawyer this time.
dialog: They saw Judge Gorman this afternoon.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Against me.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: You need to stay away from him, and
text: his wife, and the hospital. He can
dialog: have you arrested if you don't.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: I'm sorry.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I can't help you. I told you how it
dialog: would go.
text: Willy stares a second, slowly understanding his situation.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Can you do anything for her?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: I don't see how.
text: Willy grimaces. But nods. Turns away.
dialog: 
dialog: 98
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LOBRUTO HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: We move with Willy out to the quiet street. The windows of
text: the houses he passes seem warm and safe - and very far away.
text: Behind him, Lobruto watches from his lighted doorway.
text: Willy walks, shaken, determined, into the night.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - I.C.U. - THE NEXT MORNING
text: A NURSE checks Jennifer Crawford's vital signs. She then
text: begins to gently wash Jennifer's face, where it's not taped
dialog: or bandaged.
text: The monitor beeps, the ventilator hisses.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - THE SAME TIME
text: Crawford knots his necktie, studying himself in the mirror.
text: Expressionless.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GARDNER HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - SOON AFTER
text: Judge Gardner pulls his car out to the street -
text: - swerving hastily, as Willy's car skids alongside and forces
text: him to the curb, horn honking.
text: Willy pulls to a stop, blocking Gardner's way, and gets out
text: of the car - holding up both palms: just wait.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - LATER THAT MORNING
text: Dr. Lunt takes a chart from the I.C.U. Nurses' Station.
speaker_heading: DR. LUNT

scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD'S CAR - SOON AFTER
text: Crawford drives, wearing a dark suit, sunglasses. Calm.

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JUDGE GARDNER'S CHAMBERS - SAME TIME
text: Willy watches GARDNER'S SECRETARY bring in a document, fresh
text: off the laser-printer. As Gardner signs:

dialog: Can I use your fax machine?
speaker_heading: GARDNER
dialog: These have to be served in person.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PARKING STRUCTURE - DOWNTOWN L.A. - CONTINUOUS
text: Willy brakes as he drives around a corner and sees a DRIVER
text: wrangling with the BOOTH GUY. He grimaces, looks around -
text: - backs up, tires squealing, heading for another exit.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Dr. Lunt stands by Jennifer's bed, supervising the Nurse and

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WILLY'S CAR - INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Dr. Lunt looks up from making notes on Jennifer's chart, as
text: Crawford enters the room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. EMERGENCY ROOM ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS
text: Willy pulls into a NO PARKING zone and jumps out, papers in
text: hand - tossing the keys to an ORDERLY smoking a cigarette -
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Move it if you need to!
text: - running through the automatic doors.
dialog: 
dialog: 100
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Standing beside Dr. Lunt, Crawford watches, expressionless -
text: - as the Nurse and the Orderly work, efficient and silent,
text: disconnecting the oxygen tubes, unplugging the monitor -
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - SOON AFTER
text: Willy dodges people, coming to the elevators - which open.
dialog: Too crowded.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL STAIRWAY - SOON AFTER
text: Willy gasps a little as he hurries up the stairs -
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - SOON AFTER
text: - comes out of the fire stairs, hurrying toward I.C.U. -
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: - and into Jennifer's room, where he stops. Shocked.
text: The bed is being stripped, the equipment rolled out.
text: Willy stares, breathless, overwhelmed.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: You just missed her.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: She just went on up.
text: Willy struggles to control his emotions. Looks down.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: How long ago...did she die?
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: What?
dialog: (Beat)
text: The roof.
dialog: (Beat)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 101
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE (cont'd)
text: Medevac transfer. Out to a long-term
dialog: care facility up in Santa Barbara.
dialog: They just left, you can probably still
dialog: catch 'em.
text: Willy tries to understand her. With growing horror.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: He's - moving her by helicopter?
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Nothing but the best.
text: We hear the surge of a jet engine -
text: - as Willy runs out of the room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF - HELIPAD - LATER
text: A Sikorsky S-76 Medevac chopper is preparing to take off,
text: very loud and windy.
text: Through the open doorway and the thick windows, we can
text: glimpse Crawford sitting beside Jennifer, who is strapped on
text: to a gurney. She's connected to life-support equipment.
text: The MED TECH is outside, checking a few last supplies and
text: giving Crawford a moment alone with his wife.
text: Crawford moves. He may be whispering to her. Or adjusting
text: her pillow. Hard to tell.
text: As he climbs out of the chopper -
text: - he sees Willy across the roof, arguing with Dr. Lunt, who
text: is skimming the court documents, shaking his head.
text: Crawford, curious, walks toward the two men.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF HELIPAD - WILLY - THE SAME TIME
text: Dr. Lunt hands Crawford the court order. As Crawford reads
text: them, Lunt and Willy shout over the helicopter engine:
speaker_heading: DR. LUNT
text: This orders him not to take her off
dialog: life support! He's not! We can't
dialog: stop the man from -
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Then just hold it - for a couple of
dialog: hours! Have it inspected!
dialog: 
dialog: 102
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. LUNT
dialog: You're talking about a phenomenally
dialog: expensive delay, Mr. Slocum - when the
dialog: man has every right to move his wife!
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: She's not gonna get there!
text: He looks at Crawford: reading - amused, thoughtful.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: This man is a mechanical engineer with
dialog: expertise in air crashes! He has
dialog: access to airfields and he knows
dialog: exactly how to make it look like an
dialog: accident! You know what he did! You
dialog: know why she's like this!
text: Lunt hesitates, feeling a tiny edge of doubt.
text: Crawford checks his watch. Looks into Willy's eyes -
text: - then gestures for Willy to join him, and turns back to walk
text: across the pad to the helicopter. Climbs in.
text: Willy stares, stunned.
text: Lunt looks at him: case closed. The rotors whirl faster,
text: engine noise rising to a scream.
text: From the open chopper doorway, Crawford looks at Willy again
text: and gestures for him to get on.
text: Willy doesn't know how to react. Slowly, he starts to walk
text: toward the helicopter.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS
text: Willy bends, coming to the door - wind-whipped, flinching.
text: Crawford holds out a hand to help him in.
text: Willy doesn't move. The PILOT glances back.
text: Crawford's eyes are locked with Willy's.
text: Willy stares at Crawford, scared. But unable to back down
text: from the crude, plain challenge. Which Crawford is clearly
dialog: counting on.
text: Angry, at himself, Willy climbs in without taking Crawford's
text: hand. As he nervously figures out how to buckle himself in -
dialog: 
dialog: 103
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: - the Med Tech secures the door, the Pilot turns to face
text: front - and they lift off.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ABOVE LOS ANGELES - SOON AFTER
text: Looking directly down at the Sikorsky as it glides over a

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER - SAME TIME
text: Willy watches Crawford, who stares back at him. Calm.
text: Glances uneasily at the Pilot, bug-headed in sun-goggles and
text: headphones. Flying them, calm.
text: The Med Tech, adjusting Jennifer's portable ventilator.
dialog: Calm.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ABOVE LOS ANGELES - SOON AFTER

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS
text: Willy looks up from the view. Scared. Yells to the Pilot.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Why are we going out over the ocean?
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Less traffic.
text: Willy looks at Crawford.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ABOVE THE OCEAN - SOON AFTER
text: Deep dark vast blue. The Sikorsky flies over. Small.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER - SOON AFTER
text: Willy stares into Crawford's eyes.
dialog: 
dialog: 104
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Then he looks around at the vibrating metal box carrying him
text: hundreds of feet above the earth. The sunlight glare in the
text: scratched windows. The blur of the rotors against the empty
text: sky. The edges of the door frame. The rivets in the roof.
text: Crawford's eyes. Amused.
text: Willy unbuckles his seat-belt, lurches toward the Pilot -
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: We have to turn back!
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Get in your seat!
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: He's doing something - we have to turn
dialog: back!
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Who's doing something?
text: Willy points to Crawford, who's just sitting there -
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: He is! You have to get us DOWN!
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Get back in your goddamn seat!
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Willy, I'm not doing anything.
dialog: Everyone can see that.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I'm TELLING you, we have to TURN BACK!
dialog: He's DOING SOMETH-
text: An alarm begins to shriek - on the ventilator.
text: Everyone turns as the Med Tech hastily kneels next to it -
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: What's happening?!
speaker_heading: MED TECH
dialog: I don't know - I'm - there's a -
dialog: malfunction -
text: - Willy whips around to look at Crawford, with fury in his
dialog: glare: oh, you bastard.
text: Crawford almost smiles.
dialog: 
dialog: 105
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The Med Tech is flipping switches, checking wires -
speaker_heading: MED TECH
dialog: I can't do anything with this, up
dialog: here.
text: The Pilot turns - steeply, Willy falling over, the Med Tech's
text: supplies spilling - as the Med Tech hastily removes
text: Jennifer's breathing tube and prepares to begin C.P.R. -
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: She's D.N.R.
text: The Med Tech looks up - startled. Confused.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Check.
text: Willy watches, wide-eyed, as the Med Tech grabs up his
dialog: paperwork, searching it -
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: What?
text: The Med Tech looks up at Willy, scared.
speaker_heading: MED TECH
dialog: She's Do Not Resuscitate.
text: Willy turns on Crawford. He shrugs.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: It's in her living will.
text: The Med Tech looks at Willy, paralyzed.
speaker_heading: MED TECH
dialog: She's D.N.R. She signed it.
speaker_heading: WILLY
text: There's a restraining order - she's
dialog: protected - I'm authorizing you to do
dialog: it!
text: The Med Tech turns to Crawford, uncertain -
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: No extraordinary measures.
dialog: (Turns to Willy)
dialog: Unless your court order specifies
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 106

text: Willy throws himself at Crawford - attacking him, as the Med
text: Tech grabs him, drags him back -
speaker_heading: PILOT
text: WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON BACK THERE?!
text: - the Med Tech holding Willy down on the floor by Jennifer's
text: stretcher - Willy struggles furiously -
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Wait! WAIT - LOOK!
text: Willy is pointing at Jennifer - shocked -
text: - as the Med Tech lets him up and they kneel by her, the Med
text: Tech taking her pulse - Willy, staring down at her, intent:
text: She's breathing.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yes. Yes.
text: Willy whirls around to Crawford. Who's frowning.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You messed up. With all your plans
dialog: and games.
text: Willy turns back to Jennifer. Delicately strokes the side of
text: her face. Her eyes flutter open -
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Shhhh. It's okay. It's all right.
text: - she stares into Willy's eyes. He takes her hand. Silent
text: awe in her eyes. Yearning. Fear.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You're gonna be okay?
text: She squeezes his hand. Very weakly.
dialog: Crawford is looking daggers: die, bitch.
text: Jennifer's eyes - fixed on Willy - roll back. She fights it.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Jennifer? Hang on.
text: Something sad in her wordless gaze. As it starts to fade.
dialog: 
dialog: 107
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Jennifer?! JENNIFER?!
text: She's slipping. Her eyes gone empty. Her hand becoming

speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: No. Come on, Jennifer. Fight back.
text: Tears well up in Willy's eyes, but he struggles against them -
text: feeling Crawford's gaze, refusing him the satisfaction.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Don't let go.
text: But she's gone. He stares down. Mourning her. Letting his
text: grief slowly burn into rage. He gently reaches up and closes
text: her eyes.
text: Then he looks up at Crawford, who smiles sympathetically.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: You pushed it, Willy. We didn't have
dialog: to be here.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: But now you're my witness. You saw:
dialog: I didn't touch anything, I didn't do
text: anything. The machine went down.
dialog: Anybody asks - you'll have to tell
dialog: them. What you saw.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: That's really kind of perfect, isn't

scene_heading: SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

scene_heading: INT. WILLY'S APARTMENT - A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER

text: As he turns to go back in - he sees Lobruto coming along the
text: alley, wearing a suit. Surprised, waits.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: You're not answering your phone.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: That's kind of an answer in itself,
dialog: isn't it?
text: Willy heads back in, starts to pack again.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: Where are you headed?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Haven't decided yet. Just someplace
dialog: else.
text: Lobruto nods. Willy packs.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: I shouldn't have let it get so far out
dialog: of control.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: We all lose, Willy.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: We just have to live with that, and
dialog: keep fighting the good fight.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: That's not what I was doing.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: You belong in a courtroom.
text: Willy packs, thinking about that. Shakes his head.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I need to - get to know myself better.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: You're a good lawyer. All this may
dialog: have even made you a better lawyer.
dialog: Don't waste it.
text: Willy turns on him - angry, confused, bitter:
dialog: 
dialog: 109
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I didn't just lose a case! I let a
dialog: man get away with murder.
text: Lobruto nods. Respecting his pain. Shrugs, accepts the
dialog: decision, with regret.
text: Willy nods his thanks, and turns back to packing.
text: Lobruto starts to leave. But from the alley door:
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: If it makes you feel any better -
dialog: technically, you let a man get away
dialog: with attempted murder.
text: Willy doesn't respond. Keeps packing.
text: Lobruto goes out.
text: After a moment, Willy stops. Looking up. Something turning
text: over in his mind.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS
text: Lobruto is walking toward his car when Willy steps out of the
text: garage and calls after him:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: His wife is dead!
text: Lobruto turns. Uncertain what Willy is getting at.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: We can still get him. We can take him
text: back to court.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: (Gently)
dialog: Willy...
text: Willy comes toward him - excited, insistent:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Double jeopardy doesn't apply! We
dialog: bring a new charge - of homicide.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: Willy - what happened to you, on the
dialog: helicopter - we don't even know if we
dialog: could prove -
dialog: 
dialog: 110
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: No: he shot her and she died. The
dialog: fact that it took time - the fact that
dialog: he went to trial in between, just for
dialog: shooting her - doesn't matter. He
text: fired a gun and caused her death, and
dialog: that's murder.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: If he can twist the law around - then
dialog: so can we.
text: Lobruto thinks it out. Wary.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: A second indictment on the same
dialog: incident?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: A man burns down a house; we charge
dialog: him with arson. There were people
dialog: sleeping upstairs - and after weeks in
dialog: the hospital, they die. We'd charge
dialog: him with murder. Right?
text: Lobruto nods. On the fence, but seeing it now. Impressed
text: with the young man's fervor, and his logic.
text: But he shakes his head.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: All your evidence is still toxic. The
dialog: confession, the arrest - it's all
text: still inadmissible.
text: Willy grimaces. Looks down. Thinking, intense.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: I'm sorry, Willy. It was a good idea,
dialog: but -
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I'll get something new.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: How?
text: Willy looks up at him. Calm now.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You don't want to know.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: Willy, you can't -
dialog: 
dialog: 111
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I don't work for you.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Right?
text: Beat. Lobruto sighs, as Willy nods and turns to start back
text: to the garage. With work to do.
speaker_heading: LOBRUTO
dialog: Don't do anything crazy.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: What else have we got left?
text: Willy disappears inside.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. S.I.D. LAB - LATER
text: End of the day. Marchand pulls on his coat, shuts down his
text: computer. He turns to go -
text: - Willy is standing in his doorway.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I need a favor.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. POLICE EVIDENCE WAREHOUSE - SOON AFTER
text: Willy follows an EVIDENCE CLERK along an aisle between floor-
text: to-ceiling steel shelves of boxes marked with case numbers.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: These are from that thing at the
dialog: courthouse, right?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Uh-huh.
text: The Clerk stops, checking a number against a slip of paper in
text: his hand - pulls down a box for Willy.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - THAT NIGHT
text: Crawford is building a new Rube Goldberg device, tools and
text: parts laid out precisely on a table.
text: Eyes enlarged by the glasses, he silently connects two tiny
dialog: pieces of metal -
dialog: 
dialog: 112
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: - when a French door suddenly implodes, a metal lawn chair
text: hurled in from the backyard smashing through it.
text: Crawford stands, taking off the glasses -
text: - as Willy walks in over the broken glass, carrying Nunally's
dialog: gun.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Very dramatic.
text: Willy crosses the room to the alarm panel on the wall.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You ain't seen nothin' yet.
text: He presses the POLICE emergency button, then turns to
dialog: Crawford.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I want the gun.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Why? You've already got one.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I want the gun you shot your wife
dialog: with. Now.
text: Crawford doesn't move.
text: Willy raises his gun, points it at Crawford's face.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: One way or another, I'm going to see
dialog: to it you receive justice tonight.
dialog: Crawford studies Willy.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: You're serious, aren't you.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Oh, yes.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: (A smile dawning)
dialog: Willy. You got religion, didn't you?!
dialog: You care. That's...priceless.
text: He laughs. Willy keeps the gun aimed at him.
dialog: 
dialog: 113
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: No, it's very sweet. Really.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Gonna be a whole lot less funny in
text: about a minute.
text: Crawford nods. Considering the game. Unruffled.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Getting it like this: is that going to
dialog: hold up in court?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I don't work for the D.A. any more.
dialog: I'm just a guy who broke into your
dialog: house. When the police arrest me -
dialog: they'll inventory anything in my
dialog: possession. If that happens to be
dialog: crucial evidence in another case,
dialog: well: some prosecutor just got lucky.
text: Silence. Crawford studies Willy's eyes, over the muzzle of
text: the gun between them.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: It takes a very special kind of person
dialog: to look right into someone's eyes and
dialog: pull the trigger. It takes a unique
dialog: kind of strength.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I guess you'd know that.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Yes. I would.
text: Willy cocks the gun.
text: Crawford shakes his head. Eyes on Willy.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: I don't think so.
text: Willy doesn't lower the gun. But he doesn't pull the
dialog: trigger, either.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You don't know me.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: No?
dialog: 
dialog: 114
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Beat. Crawford smiles slightly.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Then I'm in for a - rude awakening.
text: Willy glares over the gun. Crawford shrugs.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Tick-tock.
text: Willy's angry. Frustrated. Trapped.
text: His bluff called. Refusing to back down.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Where did you even get yourself a gun?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: (Bitter)
dialog: It's Nunally's.
text: Crawford is thrown by this - but conceals it well.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Nunally's. Really.
text: Willy grimaces, over the gun still aimed at Crawford's face.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yeah. Really.
text: He has backed himself into a corner, and he's getting scared.
dialog: Because all of a sudden the threat he came to fake Crawford
dialog: out with -
text: - is starting to seem like his only way out.
text: Even Crawford sees it. In Willy's eyes. The uncertain edge
dialog: of the idea. He could just do it. End the game. Blow
text: Crawford's brains all over the wall.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: There I was, with a perfectly good
text: weapon just sitting in the evidence
dialog: warehouse.
text: It would be so easy. With his life already a shambles. With
dialog: everything already lost. At least he would have this.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Willy. Put it down.
dialog: 
dialog: 115
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I thought you might appreciate the
dialog: ...irony.
text: Willy's finger tightens on the trigger.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Willy. Think.
text: And Willy does. Hesitating.
text: Distracted, by a thought.
text: Lowering the gun slightly, looking at it - remembering:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. S.I.D. LAB - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
text: Marchand, on the phone - holding the gun Crawford
text: surrendered, in its plastic EVIDENCE bag:
speaker_heading: WILLY (V.O.)
dialog: "A perfectly good...Heckler and Koch
dialog: nine-millimeter."
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME)
text: Crawford is getting edgy, watching Willy study Nunally's gun:
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: The police will be here very soon.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: The exact same type of gun you bought
dialog: your wife, a month before.
text: He looks up at Crawford. Getting it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (FLASHBACK)
text: Nunally setting down his pistol on the chair - as Crawford,
text: across the room, sets down his on the table.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME)
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: If they see you with a gun in your
dialog: hand - they're not likely to ask a lot
dialog: of questions.
dialog: 
dialog: 116
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: That's why you went to the hotel.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: Surveillance-cam view: Crawford lets himself into the room -
speaker_heading: WILLY (V.O.)
dialog: That's why you went into the room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: Crawford quietly closes the door behind him. Stands, taking
dialog: it all in -
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME)
text: Willy looks at Crawford. Stunned.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You took his gun.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: Crawford checks the dresser drawers, the night-table - finds
text: Nunally's badge, holster and gun.
speaker_heading: WILLY (V.O.)
dialog: And you left him yours.
text: Crawford replaces Nunally's gun with his own matching pistol,
text: which was tucked into the back of his belt.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME)
text: Beat. Crawford shrugs - arrogant:
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: I gave it back.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yes you did.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - (FLASHBACKS - VERY QUICK)
text: Crawford fires at Jennifer - Crawford shoots at the transom -
dialog: 
dialog: 117
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY (V.O.)
dialog: After you'd used it.
text: Crawford holds out the gun, to Nunally: making the offer -
speaker_heading: WILLY (V.O.)
dialog: Then you told Nunally you'd put it
dialog: down - if he put down his.
text: Nunally setting down his pistol on the chair, as Crawford,
text: across the room, sets down his on the table.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME)
text: Willy turns, looking into the alcove:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: That's why you moved her back there -
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (FLASHBACK)
text: Nunally rushes past Crawford to kneel by Jennifer - shocked,
dialog: frantic -
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD (V.O.)
dialog: The truth is I could have done it
text: right in front of the man and he
dialog: wouldn't have noticed.
text: - ignoring Crawford behind him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME)
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: He had...other things on his mind.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
text: Nunally's calling for help on the walkie-talkie, desperately
dialog: starting C.P.R. -
text: - as behind him, Crawford picks up the murder weapon,
dialog: (Nunally's gun) from the table -
text: - and walks over to the chair where Nunally left Crawford's
text: gun (from his holster).
dialog: 
dialog: 118
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY (V.O.)
dialog: And all you had to do was switch the
text: guns back - in the commotion -
text: Crawford picks up his gun and sets the murder weapon on the
text: chair in its place.
speaker_heading: WILLY (V.O.)
dialog: - and then wait -
text: He then comes back to put his gun on the table, where it will
text: be mistaken for the murder weapon. Straightens, done.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACKS)
text: Nunally grabs up the murder weapon from the chair, upset,
text: distracted - puts it in his holster -
speaker_heading: WILLY (V.O.)
dialog: - until Nunally walked the murder
text: weapon right out of the house.
text: A Detective drops Jennifer's gun into an evidence bag -
text: - as Nunally walks out.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME)
text: Willy stares at Crawford. In real wonder.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Brilliant.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: You know, this is really kind of fun.
dialog: It's like showing some caveman a
dialog: cigarette lighter.
text: Willy looks down at the gun in his hand. Thoughtful.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: This caveman's gonna put you in prison
dialog: for the rest of your life.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: It's still not evidence, Willy.
text: There's no prints left by now.
dialog: Nothing ties that gun to me.
text: Willy smiles, slow... Enjoying himself, at last.
dialog: 
dialog: 119
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: No. That would be true. Except for
dialog: all those eggs.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Those what?
text: Willy nods to himself, going to the wooden bowl of ball-
text: bearings - selecting one, carrying it to the Rube Goldberg
dialog: machine:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: With all those little cracks and weak
dialog: places. Like Nunally. Shooting
dialog: himself, right there in the
dialog: courthouse. I didn't think he was
dialog: going to do that. Did you?
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: (Wary)
dialog: No.
text: Studying the complex device, toying with Crawford:
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I mean, we all knew he was going to
dialog: fall apart sooner or later. That was
dialog: part of your plan, right? Like a bank
dialog: shot, on a pool table: you kill your
dialog: wife - and destroy her lover. With
text: one bullet.
dialog: (Turns)
dialog: Well: four bullets, actually. Right?
text: Crawford frowns. Trying to see what Willy's getting at.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: First bullet goes into your wife.
scene_heading: INTERCUT QUICK FLASHBACKS:
text: Crawford fires at Jennifer -
speaker_heading: WILLY (V.O.)
text: Then three more out the front of the
dialog: house, to get some attention.
text: - and fires three times at the transom.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Then while you're waiting for the show
dialog: to begin - you have to reload
text: Nunally's gun.
dialog: 
dialog: 120
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Crawford pushes new bullets into the clip -
speaker_heading: WILLY (V.O.)
dialog: I mean, you don't want him wondering
dialog: where the hell four bullets went,
dialog: considering he never fired his gun
dialog: that night.
text: - and slides the clip back into the gun, pleased.
text: Willy nods, thinking it out. Sure of himself.
text: He sets the ball-bearing into the slot at the top of the
dialog: machine -
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: And I'm betting you didn't worry about
dialog: fingerprints.
text: Crawford reacts.
text: CLOSE: Crawford's fingers, putting the bullets in the clip.
text: Willy lets the ball go - watching it begin rolling down the
text: ornate tracks.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I mean, why would you? Nobody's going
text: to be looking at his gun.
text: The ball tumbles and clatters - flipping and clicking through
dialog: the ingenious, precise, heartless machinery -
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: And sooner or later, life goes on,
dialog: those four incriminating bullets would
dialog: get used, and be gone forever.
text: - and Crawford is recognizing, slowly, his one mistake.
text: The gun in Nunally's limp dead fingers, glimpsed on the
text: marble courthouse floor, through the crowd.
speaker_heading: WILLY (V.O.)
dialog: Except Nunally only fired one of those
text: bullets. Into himself.
text: Willy turns from the machine -
text: - which continues clattering and working, beside him.
dialog: 
dialog: 121
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Which means there are still three left
dialog: with your fingerprints on them - Tom.
dialog: In this clip.
text: He holds the gun up. Savoring Crawford's growing fear.
text: They can hear a car rolling up the driveway. Red and blue
text: lights sweep the frosted glass by the front door.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Everybody has a weak spot, right?
text: Some place they break.
text: Without looking, Willy gently pushes the machine, moving it a
text: fraction of an inch on the floor -
text: - as the ball catapults out - sailing across the living room
text: in a perfect, graceful arc -
text: - that misses the bowl.
text: Outside, the police car doors open and then slam.
text: Crawford, going pale, watches the metal ball roll off the
text: coffee-table and across the floor toward him.
text: Crawford doesn't move. Trying to focus. His mind working.
text: The ball comes to rest against Crawford's shoe.
text: The doorbell rings.
text: Crawford looks up. Meeting Willy's eyes.
text: Smiling slightly, Willy tucks Nunally's gun into his belt and
text: puts his hands in the air.
text: And gives Crawford a wink.
text: Crawford is staring at Willy, frozen - panic and hatred and
text: fear curdling in his eyes -
text: - as behind him, the police begin pounding on the front door.
