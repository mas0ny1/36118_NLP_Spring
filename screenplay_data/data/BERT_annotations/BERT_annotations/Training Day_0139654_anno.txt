speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
text: Eyes glisten in the clock's shine, patiently watching the
dialog: time.
text: BZZZZ! The ALARM SOUNDS. A hand that's been hovering
text: over the clock drops. Silence. JAKE HOYT, a fit young
text: man, rolls over, throws an arm over his sleeping wife --
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: It's time.
text: -- she's not there, just empty blankets. He sits up,
text: sporting a scraggly goatee, his hair growing out.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: LISA, his wife, in a rocking chair in the corner.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: Jake is surprised. How'd she sneak off?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What are you doing up?

text: Lisa taps a police baton on his shoulder. He takes it.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Wrong day to forget stuff.
dialog: Everyone's saying how lucky you

speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: LISA
text: Mmm-hmm. Ate like a pig.
text: Jake does a final check of gun belt. Inspecting his
dialog: Beretta and magazines.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I know how lucky I am. I ace this
dialog: assignment. Department's wide
dialog: open. Get my own division
dialog: someday. You should see those
dialog: guys' houses.
text: She grabs a pack of English muffins. Jake catches his
text: reflection in a mirror, rubs his chin. He doesn't like
text: the way he looks. Next to the mirror is his police
text: academy graduation photo -- Clean-cut, almost adolescent.
text: Lisa plays with his goatee, she likes it.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Want some eggs for the road?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I gotta roll. Gotta beat the
dialog: traffic.
text: He shoves his gun belt in the duffel. Zips it shut. He
text: grabs a pressed uniform off a chair, and his police hat,
text: wrapped in plastic. He kisses Lisa's cheek, her neck,
text: her lips. Heads to the door. The PHONE RINGS. Jake
text: stops. Lisa answers.

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I know. That's why I signed up.
dialog: I want to thank you for giving me
dialog: the oppor --
text: -- CLICK! Alonzo hangs up. Jake too. He stands there,
text: grabs his nervous stomach.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Feel like it's football tryouts.
dialog: Wish it was tomorrow so I'd know
dialog: already if I made his squad or
dialog: not.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: It's not tomorrow. It's today.
dialog: And it's gonna work out. I know
dialog: it will.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I gotta relax.
text: Lisa looking at him. He gets an idea, snuggles up to
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Don't have to show up until ten.
text: She breaks the embrace -- sore breasts -- Ouch!
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Soon they'll be mine again.
text: Jake chases them with cupped hands as she retreats,
text: giggling. Their game.

text: Old and tired, near Good Samaritan Hospital. Jake
text: struts through the door, confidently looks around.
speaker_heading: JAKE'S POV
text: DETECTIVE SERGEANT ALONZO HARRIS, in black shirt, black
dialog: leather jacket. And just enough platinum and diamonds
text: to look like somebody. He reads the paper in a booth.
text: The gun leather-tough LAPD vet is a hands-on, blue-collar
dialog: cop who can kick your ass with a look.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: Jake walks over. Slides in across. Alonzo's eyes will
dialog: never leave his newspaper.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Good morning, sir.

speaker_heading: JAKE

text: Alonzo sighs, carefully folds his paper. Glares at Jake.
speaker_heading: ALONZO
dialog: Tell me a story, Hoyt.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: My story?
speaker_heading: ALONZO
dialog: Not your story. A story. You
dialog: can't keep your mouth shut long
dialog: enough to let me finish my paper.
dialog: So tell me a story.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I don't think I know any stories.
text: Alonzo waves the paper in Jake's face.
speaker_heading: ALONZO
dialog: This is a newspaper. And I know
dialog: it's ninety percent bullshit but
dialog: it's entertaining. That's why I
dialog: read it. Because it entertains
dialog: me. If you won't let me read my
dialog: paper, then entertain me with your

dialog: Jake thinks. Bingo! He's got it.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: There was this D.U.I. stop.
speaker_heading: ALONZO

dialog: mid-watch?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Right. It's a real quiet night.
text: A yawner. We're rolling on
dialog: Vanowen. I'm driving. And this
dialog: Acura, just a beautiful car, comes
text: out a side street. In excess.
dialog: All over the median. So I light
text: it up and hit the wailer. Guy
dialog: drives on like I'm invisible for
text: ten blocks before he pulls over.
dialog: Plates ran clean. Debbie covers
dialog: as I approach. Driver's this huge
dialog: white guy. Can barely keep his
text: eyes open. I field test and
dialog: arrest and I'm belting him in our
text: unit. Debbie's tossing his car.
dialog: She calls me to the vehicle and
dialog: shows me a snubbed .38 and two
text: shotguns, all loaded and locked.
speaker_heading: ALONZO
dialog: No shit?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: No shit. She calls our supervisor
dialog: and I keep searching. I find five
text: hundred grams of meth in the dash.
dialog: Turns out our D.U.I. was on bail
dialog: for distribution. He was on his
dialog: way to smoke his ex-partner before
dialog: trial.
dialog: (proudly )

speaker_heading: ALONZO
dialog: You also have a dick.

speaker_heading: ALONZO

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: This isn't from the motor pool.
speaker_heading: ALONZO
dialog: Don't worry. My baby puts out

speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: DISPATCH (V.O.)

text: Jake nods and smiles -- makes sense.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. G-RIDE (BROADWAY) - MOVING - DAY 7

speaker_heading: ALONZO
dialog: It's my world.

speaker_heading: JAKE
text: They're flashing gang signs.
speaker_heading: ALONZO

dialog: There's another three hundred and
dialog: fifty cases on the log I can't
dialog: clear. I'm supervising five
dialog: officers. That's five different
dialog: personalities, five different sets
dialog: of problems. You, Officer Hoyt,
dialog: if you got the guts to succeed,
dialog: will be number six. I don't have
dialog: time to baby-sit or hold hands.
dialog: You have one day to show me who
dialog: you are and what you can or cannot
dialog: handle. You can't hack narcotics,
dialog: feel free to work a pussy desk
dialog: chasing bad checks. Hear me,
dialog: Officer Hoyt?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I hear you.
speaker_heading: ALONZO
dialog: Good. Gonna show you reality.
dialog: Think you can handle it?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ALONZO
dialog: Why you wanna be a narc?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I want to serve my community by
dialog: ridding it of dangerous drugs.
dialog: Alonzo gives him a look -- Don't b.s. me.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I wanna make detective.
text: The boy is ambitious. Alonzo likes that. As they

dialog: can answer)
dialog: You do. I checked it out. Cover
dialog: your area, cover your ass, but not
dialog: necessarily in that order, right?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Right.
text: The two cops from the black and white have their guns

speaker_heading: ALONZO
dialog: How's the Espanol?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Mas o menos.
speaker_heading: ALONZO

speaker_heading: ALONZO
dialog: Shit I've been through. Shit I've

dialog: You shot Roger when you were whacked

dialog: Got witnesses? Smiley? My squad?
dialog: My loyal troopers? Tell your tales.
dialog: We'll tell the truth. It's not

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: There's my evidence.
text: Jake nods at the cash. THWACK! Alonzo flicks his

text: Alonzo jumps onto a balcony.
text: Jake runs at full tilt. Toward the edge of the roof.
text: Where nasty coils of razor-wire lay in wait.
text: Jake jumps -- His foot hits rotten plywood -- Jake flies
text: awkwardly through space.
scene_heading: EXT. OTHER ROOFTOP - NIGHT 80
text: Another pigeon coop. Chairs, a card table, potted
text: plants; a little oasis. The edge of the roof approaching
text: fast, and its concertina of razor-wire. Jake's chest hits
text: it -- oof! An iron spike atop a fence a mere inch from
text: his ear. Jake pulls himself onto the roof.
text: Smack! Alonzo nails Jake's face with the war bag of
dialog: cash.
text: Jake is stunned, Alonzo grabs the gun tied to Jake's hand

text: finger in the trigger guard -- POP-POP-POP-CLICK!
text: Emptying Jake's PISTOL.
text: Using his gun as brass knuckles, Jake punches Alonzo's
text: head. Alonzo head-butts Jake, knees him in the crotch.
text: Jake gasps in agony.

text: out of the way. Alonzo kicking. Jake rolling...
text: Right off the edge of the roof.
text: Jake falls a story to -- THUD! -- a roof below.
text: Alonzo looks down at Jake. Who looks half-dead. Alonzo

speaker_heading: JAKE'S FEET

speaker_heading: INSERT - WIPER

text: hand. Pffck! Pffck! Opens a gash on Alonzo's face as

text: where Jake's face is. Jake jerks his head -- BAM! A
dialog: near miss.
text: BAM! Another hole in the glass. But fortunately not
text: Jake's head.
text: WHAM! The G-RIDE backs into a car. The gun flies from
text: Alonzo's hand, out the window. Jake tumbles off the car
text: onto the street. The G-ride stalls. It didn't get far
text: at all. Alonzo is pretty beat up from the crash. Jake
text: scrambles for the gun, then leans in the window of the G-
text: ride and punches Alonzo several times. Jake grabs the
text: war bag, pulls open the door and yanks Alonzo out onto
text: the street, Jake backs up, sets the war bag at his feet.
text: The porch lights of two houses come on. Steel doors
text: open. People tentatively step outside. Women and

speaker_heading: JAKE
