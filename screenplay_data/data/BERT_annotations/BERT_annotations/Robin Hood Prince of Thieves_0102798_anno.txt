scene_heading: PRINCE OF THIEVES
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
speaker_heading: SUNSET
text: The glowing orb ripples like a blood-red eye.
scene_heading: BLACK, ROBED FIGURE
text: A face of the ages. Dark, wrinkled skin. Wizened,
text: almond eyes. He howls at the sun. His voice ECHOES
text: across the sky. The Moslem call to prayer.
text: Hundreds of feet below his tower, a mud-walled city of
text: minarets and mosques. A human ants' nest. Scurrying to
dialog: their devotions.
scene_heading: EXT. TWELFTH-CENTURY ARAB CITY - ESTABLISHING SHOT
scene_heading: INT. DUNGEONS - SUNSET
text: Pervasive blackness. Moans of men in pain. Dripping
text: water. Rats. Filth. The nadir of human degradation.
text: Bedraggled white men, POWs from the Crusades, caged
text: together with Arab cutthroats. Jailers wrench two
text: crusaders from their cell. ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY and PETER
text: DUBOIS. Their appearance reeks of long imprisonment, but
text: remnants of their noble heritage still glimmer in their
text: faces. Peter is so frail he can barely walk.
scene_heading: INT. TORTURE CHAMBER - SUNSET
text: A furnace. Torture instruments glow red hot. Chained
text: victims. A massive INTERROGATOR scrutinizes the two
text: white men. Indicates a rat-faced lowlife, who points at
text: Peter, jabbering in Arabic.
speaker_heading: INTERROGATOR
dialog: He says you stole his bread.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It is a lie. I caught him
dialog: stealing ours.
text: The lowlife jabbers some more. The Interrogator debates.
speaker_heading: INTERROGATOR
text: Cut off the infidel's hand.
text: The jailers haul Peter to the chopping block.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: No!... I took the bread.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: That's not true.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: They're not interested in truth.
dialog: You are too weak, Peter. You
dialog: would not live through it.
text: The Interrogator stares into Robin's eyes.
speaker_heading: INTERROGATOR
dialog: Sacrifice for the weaker? How
dialog: noble... As you wish... Cut off
dialog: this one's hand as well!... But
dialog: first...
text: He indicates an Arab prisoner, who is dragged forward.
text: His struggling hand is laid on the executioner's block.
speaker_heading: INTERROGATOR
dialog: Show them the courage of Allah.
text: The prisoner's face braces for the pain. A red-hot
text: scimitar flashes down. The hand flips into a basket.
dialog: Twitching.
text: Robin is next. His composure fails. He flops to his
text: knees, crying. The Interrogator laughs. The jailers
text: unlash the thongs on Robin's hand. They stretch it out,
text: forcing it down. Robin goes limp, sobbing. Peter
text: catches his eye... Robin winks.
text: The scimitar. Drawn from the coals. Spitting flame.
text: Arcs down. Robin is suddenly galvanized.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: And this is English courage.
text: He hurls his holders aside. Swings upward, driving his
text: fast into the executioner's throat. Grabs the sword.
text: Slash. His thongs melt like butter. A jailer leaps at
text: him. Steaming, the scimitar slices into the man's chest.
text: Despite his bindings, Peter wrestles the Interrogator.
text: Knife pressed to his throat, Peter is forced against the
text: furnace. At the last second, he flips the man into the
text: fire. Screaming.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: That's for five years of hell.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: A jailer aims a scalding blade at Robin's back.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Behind you!
text: Warned, Robin ducks away. Slams the jailer's head into
text: the wall.
text: Peter frees himself, but they are still outnumbered.
text: While fighting, Robin acknowledges the man who shouted
text: the warning. An imposing, shaven-headed SARACEN.
text: Heavily-muscled arms and chest, covered in tattoos. Even
text: his bald head is ornamented.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: You speak English?
speaker_heading: SARACEN
dialog: The king's own. Set me free.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, Robin.
speaker_heading: SARACEN
dialog: For pity's sake. Mine is a
dialog: sentence of death.
text: Robin sidesteps, propelling a guard into a pit.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Don't trust him.
text: Two more guards attack, yelling fury. Robin eyes the
text: curved scimitar.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: What I would give for an English
text: sword. This is a pruning hook.
text: A guard swings at him with a giant axe. Robin slashes...
text: shears the axe handle in two.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Hmm! Not bad.
text: He runs the man through. Peter loses his sword. His
text: opponent moves in for the kill... Peter grabs tongs from
text: the fire and smolders his opponent with a backhand.
text: Commotion outside. RAISED VOICES and RUNNING FEET.
speaker_heading: SARACEN
dialog: Free me and I will show you a way
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Why should we trust you?
speaker_heading: SARACEN
dialog: If you don't, you are dead men.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
text: He makes a point.
text: The door bursts open. More guards rush in.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: A good point.
text: He slashes the man free.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Robin!
speaker_heading: ROBIN
text: Whatever blood is in his veins, he
dialog: does not deserve to die here.
speaker_heading: SARACEN
dialog: This way!
text: He beckons them to the back. A hidden door leads into a
dialog: tunnel.
scene_heading: INT. SEWERS - NIGHT
text: They wade through foul water up to their waists. The
text: Saracen leads... A snake lashes out for his face. Robin
text: lops off its head.
speaker_heading: SARACEN
dialog: You are fast, my friend.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Five years I've waited for the
dialog: smell of free air. That makes a
dialog: man fast.
text: Guards drop down from above, carrying torches. Blocking
dialog: the way.
speaker_heading: SARACEN
dialog: You will need to be yet faster.
text: A narrow opening to their left... they splash through.
text: Half running, half crawling in the dank water. Fire
text: arrows land around them. The orange smoke is choking.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SARACEN
dialog: Poison air. Hold your breath.
text: Flames illuminate the walls, alive with a loathsome mass
text: of crawling slime. Peter falls. A pursuer descends on
text: him, thrusting a blazing torch at his face. The Saracen
text: intercepts the blow. Grabs the man's neck, SNAPPING it
dialog: with one mighty twist.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (coughing)
dialog: Thanks. I misjudged you.
speaker_heading: SARACEN
dialog: Save your breath.
text: Gasping for air, they find the tunnel veers steeply down-
text: ward. A slippery, granite tube. Losing purchase, they
text: slide headlong. Sharp, rusted spikes jut out from the
text: walls ahead.
text: Robin grabs at the walls to break the fall. No use.
text: They're picking up speed. He turns his sword crossways,
text: bracing it against the sides of the tunnel, as a brake.
text: Sparks fly. The sword cuts into Robin's chest... but it
dialog: works.
speaker_heading: SARACEN
dialog: Allah be praised.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Amen, brother.
text: A bloodcurdling scream. A pursuing guard tumbles down
text: the sewer chute. The three men press themselves against
text: the wall. The man hurtles by... is impaled on the
dialog: spikes.
text: A draft of fresh air from the roof of the tunnel. Using
text: the spiked guard as a ladder, Robin climbs. Removes a
text: grating.
scene_heading: EXT. ARAB STREET - NIGHT
text: Robin's head appears... ducks back down, as a squad of
text: mounted soldiers thunders right over him... he reappears.
text: All clear. They're outside the prison wall. Robin helps
dialog: Peter up.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: God willing, we may now be safe.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Swoosh. An arrow pierces through Peter's chest -- fired
text: from the prison wall. He reels... Robin leads him under
text: the wall for protection. Shouts of alarm. Soldiers
text: approaching.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Come, Peter. We must hurry.
text: Raising his sword, Peter faces the oncoming soldiers.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It is mortal. Leave me.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
text: Hold on to my shoulder.
text: Peter shakes him off.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: My mother... my little sister.
dialog: Tell them I love them. Tell them
dialog: I died a free Englishman.
text: Robin looks despairingly to the Saracen.
speaker_heading: SARACEN
dialog: His wound is by the heart. We
text: cannot save him.
text: Robin knows it's true. Peter pulls an insignia ring from
text: a hidden pouch in his clothes. Thrusts it into Robin's
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Take this to my sister. Swear you
dialog: will protect her for me... Swear
dialog: it, Robin!
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: (reluctantly)
dialog: I swear it.
text: Summoning hidden resources of strength, Peter charges at
text: the oncoming soldiers, brandishing his sword.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: For England.
text: He fells the first Arab. The Saracen pulls Robin away.
speaker_heading: SARACEN
dialog: Come now! Do not fail your friend.
dialog: Make his sacrifice an act of honor.
text: They vanish into the night. Fighting like a man pos-
text: sessed, Peter is swallowed in a sea of enemy soldiers.
dialog: 7.
scene_heading: DESERTED ALLEY - LATER
text: Robin and the Saracen catch their breath.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Farewell, friend. God speed you
dialog: on your way.
speaker_heading: SARACEN
dialog: Our way is together. With the
dialog: speed of Allah.
text: He grins. This strange man has a sense of humor.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I go to England.
speaker_heading: SARACEN
dialog: Then I go to England.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: England? Why?
speaker_heading: SARACEN
dialog: You saved my life. I must stay
dialog: with you until I save yours.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Go your own way. I relieve you of
dialog: your obligation.
speaker_heading: SARACEN
dialog: Only Allah can do that.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: And if I don't want you?
speaker_heading: SARACEN
dialog: You have no choice... unless you
dialog: think you can kill me.
text: He grins broadly. Offers his hand.
speaker_heading: SARACEN
dialog: My name is Aslan.
text: Resigned, Robin takes the proferred hand.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Robin of Locksley. You know a
dialog: short route to England, Aslan?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 8.
scene_heading: EXT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE (NOTTINGHAMSHIRE, ENGLAND)
text: Eerie shapes. Weaving. White light on water. The moon
text: reflected in the moat of a small castle. Towers shrouded
text: in night mist. Smoke curls from a chimney.
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSE: LOCKSLEY CASTLE, NOTTINGHAMSHIRE, ENGLAND
scene_heading: INT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE - NIGHT
text: FIRE CRACKLES in an open hearth. Hams and a half sheep
text: hang, smoking. An old DOG SNORES at the fireside. A
text: bone clunks on the floor, waking him.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Enough of that din, Remus. I
dialog: can't think.
text: Licking the bone gratefully, the dog looks in the direc-
dialog: tion of the voice... Grey. Proud. Distinguished. LORD
scene_heading: LOCKSLEY.
text: Seated at a table, wine goblet in hand, he pores over a
text: wonderful illustrated Bible. Reading to himself for
text: solace and strength. Empty chairs surround the vast
text: table. A deep sense of loneliness. He glances at a
text: portrait over the fireplace... Robin.
text: The dog jumps. Hackles rise. O.S. SHOUTS. Locksley
text: unsheathes a dagger. Obscures it in the folds of the
text: Bible. The door bursts open. A peasant, ragged,
text: desperate, KENNETH.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: My Lord! Help me.
text: He's bleeding from a face wound. Another man grabs him
text: from behind. Locksley's craggy-faced retainer, DUNCAN.
text: Older than his master, but still strong, he holds Kenneth
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: You must wait... I am sorry you
dialog: were disturbed, Master.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: (high anxiety)
dialog: My Lord, please!
speaker_heading: LOCKSLEY
dialog: It is alright, Duncan.
dialog: (to Kenneth)
dialog: You are Kenneth of Cowfall?
text: The peasant falls to his knees.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: They've taken my Gwen. My
dialog: daughter.
speaker_heading: LOCKSLEY
dialog: Who has taken her?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
text: Men on horses. In masks.
dialog: (touches his wound)
dialog: We tried to stop them. My son is
dialog: dead.
scene_heading: EXT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE - NIGHT
text: Steam pours from the nostrils of a black charger. Lord
text: Locksley mounts, in armor. Duncan attempts to detain
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: You cannot go alone, Master. Let
dialog: me ride for help.
speaker_heading: LOCKSLEY
dialog: That may be too late. Kenneth,
dialog: lead the way.
text: He kicks his horse into motion.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Master, stay! There is an evil
dialog: moon tonight.
speaker_heading: LOCKSLEY
dialog: Good will overcome, Duncan. Trust
dialog: in that.
text: Duncan looks up. Crosses himself. Dark clouds race
text: across the moon.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WOODED TRAIL
text: Kenneth checks the ground. Locksley waits.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: They came this way, my Lord.
speaker_heading: LOCKSLEY
dialog: Onward then. What is this place?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: KENNETH
text: Nearby the Gregor Caves.
text: Locksley reacts -- a hint of fear. They move on...
text: Ahead, the hillside glows, rimmed in eerie light.
text: Strange primitive CHANTS, wafted on the wind. Locksley
text: ties his nervous horse to a tree.
text: Parting undergrowth, Kenneth creeps forward. Cries out.
text: He's face to face with the maggot-eaten skull of a goat.
text: Beyond it, a gruesome host of half-skinned human skulls,
text: all arranged on stakes. Some male, others with rotting
text: female tresses, staring eyelessly into the night.
text: Kenneth turns to run... A hand grabs him.
speaker_heading: LOCKSLEY
dialog: Steady, man. They are to dissuade
dialog: the faint of heart. Think of
dialog: Gwen.
text: From the crest of the rise, they peer down into the
text: craggy valley. A cave opening, ablaze with flames leers
text: at them like the mouth of hell. Before the cave, a
text: circle of stones. A miniature Stonehenge.
text: A medieval orgy. Men and women in masks and loose
text: robes. Dancing. Drinking. Reveling. Pure carnality.
text: Lord Locksley and Kenneth watch in horror. Faces ashen.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Druids.
speaker_heading: LOCKSLEY
dialog: I trusted we were rid of such evil
dialog: a century ago.
text: An unearthly SCREECH. A creature leaps into the circle
text: of stones. Grotesque gargoyle head, horns, fur-covered
text: arms and legs. A living Hieronymous Bosch DEMON. Its
text: clawed hands slash across a reveler's back, drawing
text: blood in vicious streaks. The creature tastes the blood.
text: The reveler is ecstatic.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: (petrified)
dialog: Is it the devil?
speaker_heading: LOCKSLEY
dialog: If it is, I have some Christian
text: steel that will test his hide.
text: He draws his sword. A crucifix sculpted into the hilt.
text: A girl is dragged from the cave. Kenneth buries his
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: LOCKSLEY
dialog: Gwen?
text: Kenneth nods.
text: The Demon shrieks, dervishing around GWEN, who is
text: carried onto the central plinth stone. A pagan altar,
text: the shape of an elephant's head with its trunk raised. A
text: masked figure stands at the head of the altar. The high
dialog: priest of the dark rite.
text: The girl's body shudders as blood-red liquid is forced
text: down her throat. The Demon's voice is husky and hideous.
speaker_heading: DEMON
dialog: Come, my virgin flower.
text: Hypnotized by the creature's voice and snake-like move-
text: ments, Gwen stretches herself out. A single beam of
text: sunlight slices through the mist, like a laser. The
text: first light of the rising sun, it strikes directly on the
text: altar, tracking down towards the girl's heart. The
text: Demon's raised talons close in on the white flesh of her
text: neck. Gwen's eyes are open wide, in a trance. The crowd
text: of revelers encircle the plinth. Awed anticipation...
dialog: A warrior's yell!
text: Sword raised, Locksley THUNDERS in on his CHARGER. The
text: terrified crowd parts. The Demon screams like a banshee.
speaker_heading: DEMON
dialog: Kill him! Kill him!
text: The followers throw themselves at Locksley. He beats
text: them off. The high priest issues orders to armed guards,
text: who run to intercept. One aims a spear. Locksley hacks
text: the shaft in half. Cuts men down left and right.
text: Reaches the altar stone.
speaker_heading: LOCKSLEY
dialog: Gwen! Up, girl, up!
text: Gwen shakes off her trance. The Demon launches itself at
text: Locksley. Talons rip flesh from his face. With all his
text: strength, Locksley hurls the creature down.
speaker_heading: LOCKSLEY
dialog: In the name of God!
text: His broadsword swings in a mighty arc. Slices across the
text: gargoyle's skull. Clean through half the face...
text: Impossibly, the demon rolls back to its feet.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The head is an elaborate mask -- beneath are the yellow
text: skin, white hair, and burning red eyes of an albino
text: crone. Screaming vitriol, the hag is unharmed.
text: Momentarily stunned, Locksley regains his senses, hauls
text: the girl onto his charger. The guards close in.
text: Locksley spurs his horse. Rides for an opening.
text: The masked high priest stands resolutely in his path.
text: Brandishing a burning branch. The horse is freaked.
text: Rears. Locksley and the girl are thrown.
text: Unarmed, Locksley charges the man. Slams him into the
text: cave wall. The mask falls. Locksley gasps in
dialog: recognition.
speaker_heading: LOCKSLEY
dialog: Nottingham!
text: The SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM. Powerful build, black beard,
text: cruel intensity in every feature.
speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: You are an unwelcome surprise,
dialog: Locksley.
speaker_heading: LOCKSLEY
dialog: The King shall hear of this,
dialog: Nottingham.
speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: I think not.
text: Locksley is surrounded. One by one the men reveal their
text: faces. Locksley backs up in shock, recognizing them.
speaker_heading: LOCKSELY
dialog: God help us.
speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: One day all England will worship
dialog: with us.
speaker_heading: LOCKSLEY
dialog: Never.
text: The crone spits venom in his face.
speaker_heading: DEMON
dialog: I am Mortianna. You will die with
dialog: my name on your lips.
text: Locksley's agonized cry fills the valley. On the hill-
text: side, Kenneth averts his eyes. Turns to run. Five
text: masked figures block his way.
dialog: 13.
scene_heading: EXT. ENGLISH SHORE - DAY
text: A twelfth century French sailboat at anchor. A cross on
dialog: its sail.
text: A longboat rows to shore. Robin stands in the prow, in
text: a pilgrim's hooded robe. He gazes at the approaching
text: land. Unable to wait, he leaps into the surf and wades
text: to the beach. He kneels, pressing his hands and face
text: into the soil.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Home. Thank you, Lord.
text: Aslan steps from the boat, sniffing the air. The French
text: sailors keep their distance from him. Robin takes his
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: My friend, you have escorted me
dialog: home. I beg you to free yourself
dialog: of your vow. Return with the
dialog: boat. I know how heavy your
dialog: heart must be, this far from your
dialog: family and native land...
speaker_heading: ASLAN (SARACEN)
dialog: Because I love them so dearly,
dialog: I cannot dishonor them.
text: A sailor creeps up behind Aslan, club in hand.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I thought you'd say that.
text: He nods to the sailor, who swings the club down. The
text: Saracen sidesteps, grabs the man's arm and flips him
text: into the surf. He turns a cold stare on Robin.
speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: No man controls my destiny.
dialog: Especially not one who attacks
text: downwind and stinks of garlic.
text: Robin laughs. The Saracen remains intense.
speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: If our positions were reversed,
dialog: I would have done the same.
dialog: Only I would have succeeded.
text: He smiles broadly. Robin claps him on the shoulder.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Come, Aslan. By nightfall we will
dialog: celebrate your honor when we dine
dialog: with my father.
dialog: 14.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. PEASANT'S COTTAGE - DAY
text: CRASH! An armored foot splinters the door of a farmer's
text: hovel. Children scream and run. A soldier clubs at
text: them, laughing.
text: Outside. More soldiers. Some on horses, others on foot,
text: with leashed hounds. Pillaging. Vandalizing.
text: Searching.
text: GUY GISBORNE: An impressive figure on horseback.
text: Strikingly handsome -- except that one of his ears is
text: missing. We recognize his face from the Druid ceremony.
text: He coldly addresses a pregnant woman with a child in her
text: arms, FANNY.
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: You owe the sheriff three bushels
dialog: of flax.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: You starve us. First the drought,
dialog: now you take what food we have
dialog: left.
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: For starving people, you look
dialog: fat enough.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: (emerging from
dialog: the hut)
dialog: He's not here, sir. None but the
text: woman and children.
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: (to Fanny)
dialog: Where is your mate? The man
dialog: they call Little.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: He died last winter.
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: Is that so? We hear he is very
text: much alive. Hiding out in the
dialog: forest. He probably ran away
dialog: to escape your scolding tongue.
text: The soldiers join in his laughter. Incensed, Fanny
text: pounds her fist on his legs. Gisborne kicks her down.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Norman swine!
text: A BOY of 12 springs from nowhere, thrusting a hay fork at
text: Gisborne's throat.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: No, Wulf! Don't! 'Twill only
dialog: make it worse.
text: Wulf backs off. Nostrils flaring with repressed hate.
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: Seize him!
text: While two soldiers grab the Boy, others examine his
text: hiding place. A secret thatched door, built into the
text: side of a haystack... a bow and quiver... and a deer
text: carcass. Gisborne dismounts.
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: This is Lord Nottingham's deer.
dialog: Is this how you repay the Sheriff
dialog: for his protection?
speaker_heading: WULF (BOY)
text: Like a wolf protects sheep.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: I killed it. We needed the meat.
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
text: Poachers hang. Either he dies or
dialog: you die.
speaker_heading: WULF
dialog: My mother lies to protect me.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: No, Wulf!
text: Gisborne drags the boy to the carcass.
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: You have deprived us of a hunt,
dialog: boy.
text: He cups his hand in the deer's blood. Smears it on
text: Wulf's face.
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
text: The hounds know the scent well.
text: He tosses his bloody glove to the dogs. They tear at
text: each other in their effort to rip at the glove.
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: Run, boy. Like a deer. Give us
dialog: some pleasure before you die.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: To the accompaniment of the HOUNDS' savage HOWLS and
text: the horrified screams of his family, Wulf runs.
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: Unleash them!
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DUSK
text: Nearing home, Robin is buoyant. The Saracen, brooding,
text: walks two paces behind him.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Why must you walk in back of me?
speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: In your land am I not the infidel?
text: The unbeliever, the instrument of
dialog: evil?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Our races have fought for a
dialog: hundred years to prove that point.
speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: Then I trust it is safer to appear
dialog: as your slave than as your equal.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: For an 'infidel' you have uncommon
dialog: clarity of thinking. Yet you
dialog: refuse to tell me about your home
dialog: and family.
speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: Those are my burdens.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: You speak my language. You have
dialog: the diplomacy and honor code of
dialog: a nobleman. I ask again, why
dialog: were you to be executed?
text: The Saracen maintains a moody silence.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: So, I must continue with my
dialog: guesswork. You are highborn?
dialog: Probably... You fell from favor...
dialog: Clearly... Why? You broke the
dialog: law? You were a rival for power?
dialog: ... A woman?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The Saracen reacts, almost imperceptibly.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: By the Lord, that's it!
text: Aslan is silent, but Robin knows he's right.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: They say there are Arab women of
dialog: such beauty that they can possess
dialog: a man's mind, that he would be
dialog: willing to die for them. Is
dialog: that not so?
text: Ignoring him, the Saracen stops. Examines the darkening
dialog: sky.
speaker_heading: ASLAN
text: It is close to sunset.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Your people must marry women
dialog: chosen for them by others, right?
text: No reply. Aslan unfolds a prayer rug.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Who is she? The Mullah's daughter?
dialog: ... Another man's wife?... That's

speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Ah, Jasmina! Is she beautiful?
speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: Which way is East?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: That way.
text: Aslan throws his rug on the ground. Kneels.
speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I would know blindfolded. I'm
dialog: five miles from home... Was she
dialog: worth it?
speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: Worth dying for.
text: Robin stands smiling over him as Aslan begins his
text: prayers... BAYING of HUNTING DOGS... In the distance, the
text: boy Wulf runs toward them, ducks behind a tree and clubs
text: the leading dog with a branch. The other hounds close
text: in... panting with exhaustion, Wulf swings into the
text: branches. A hound savages his leg.
text: The soldiers surround the tree. The boy clambers
text: precariously onto the highest branch... Robin surrep-
text: titiously steals a crossbow from one of the soldiers'
dialog: horses.
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: You're not playing by the rules,
dialog: boy. Deer don't climb trees...
dialog: Perhaps he thinks he's a game
dialog: bird. Shall we teach him to fly?
dialog: Cut it down!
text: The soldiers hack at the trunk. The tree quivers.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Hold!... I am curious as to what
dialog: manner of creature is so fearsome
dialog: that it takes six men to attack
dialog: it.
text: Shrouded in his pilgrim's hooded cloak, he approaches
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: Stand back, stranger. This is no
dialog: affair of yours.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Have we treed the devil himself?
dialog: Let me see... Ah ha! A small boy.
dialog: A truly dangerous animal.
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: I advise you to move on, pilgrim.
dialog: This is the Sheriff's land.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Wrong. This is my land, and my
dialog: tree. Therefore, whatever is in
dialog: it also belongs to me.
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: I grow dangerously tired of your
dialog: wit... Chop it down!
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: The man who strikes that tree
dialog: dies.
text: He glances nervously at Aslan, who's still at his
text: prayers. The men stop in mid-swing. More surprised
text: than scared. Gisborne gestures to the largest of them.
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: Chop down the hooded fool.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: (backing up)
dialog: Perhaps we could discuss this.
text: The soldier raises his sword. Robin lifts his cape...
text: the crossbow. Shoots from the hip. The bolt thuds
text: through the man's armor. He's dead before he lands.
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: Kill him!
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Aslan! It's time to redeem that
dialog: vow.
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: Set the dogs on him!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Aslan ignores him, lost in his prayers. Robin lifts the
text: other arm -- a second concealed crossbow. WHUMPF! The
text: bolt flips the dog handler into the vicious pack. Dead
text: or not, he soon will be. Robin unsheathes his sword.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Aslan, get off your damn knees!
dialog: I have four of them cornered.
text: The Saracen remains head down. Or did we see him steal
text: a glance? Gisborne signals his men to attack. A wave of
text: flashing steel.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I hope there's enough of me to
dialog: satisfy you all.
text: Backed up to a tree, he grabs a branch and kicks out.
text: Two men fly back. He lunges at a third. His sword
text: strikes flesh. Robin sidesteps and hurls the fourth
text: onto a sharp tree stump.
text: Gisborne thrusts. Robin reacts too slowly. Blood flows
text: from his arm. His sword falls.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Aslan!!
text: Gisborne is on him, sword pressed to his back. Robin
text: freezes.
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: Well, hooded stranger, allow me
dialog: to know your name before I run you
dialog: through.
text: A moment of silence... Like lightning, Robin spins,
text: kicks out Gisborne's legs. Slams one foot on the man's
text: sword arm, the other on his throat. Throws back his
text: pilgrim's hood.
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: Robin of Locksley!
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: On your knees, Gisborne. Pray.
text: He obeys. Robin raises his sword.
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: Please, Locksley! No!
text: Robin drives the point into Gisborne's rear. The man
text: leaps.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Now get off my land. And tell your
dialog: cousin the Sheriff what happens to
dialog: his scum when they pick on my
dialog: people.
text: Gisborne takes off, colliding with Aslan as he folds his
text: rug. Reacts in shock at the sight of the strange Arab.
dialog: Keeps running.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: (to Aslan,
dialog: furious)
dialog: You worthless savage! You travel
dialog: ten thousand miles to save my life,
dialog: then leave me to be butchered.
speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: I will fulfill my vow when I
dialog: choose.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Which does not include prayer
dialog: times, meal times, or any time
dialog: I'm outnumbered six to one!!
speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: You whine like a mule. You are
text: still alive.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Barely.
text: Aslan examines Robin's wound. Dismissive.
speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: A flesh wound. Why did you let
dialog: their leader go?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: After six years of the stench of
dialog: death, I have no stomach for
dialog: needless blood on my hands.
text: Wulf climbs cautiously from the tree.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Have no fear, boy.
text: The boy nervously eyes Robin and the Saracen, fingering
text: a crucifix around his neck. Runs off into the woods.
speaker_heading: ASLAN

text: The conquering hero returns.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Ha! It was you he was scared of.

speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Come, my strange friend. Beyond
dialog: that hill lies the prettiest
dialog: little castle in all Christendom.
text: Warm hearths, hot food, real beds.
speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: With feather pillows?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
text: With feather pillows. Warm and
text: soft like Jasmina's embrace.
scene_heading: EXT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE - NIGHT
text: Ruins. The moon hovers ominously over the once-proud
text: castle. Burned to the ground. Gutted and deserted.
text: Towers demolished. Moat drained. Robin stares, struck
text: dumb with horror.
text: The dark courtyard. Heartsick, Robin stumbles over
text: debris.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Father! Hello!
text: His VOICE ECHOES around the fallen battlements. Aslan
text: places a hand on his shoulder and points... Suspended
text: high on a tower wall is a decaying human corpse.
scene_heading: CLOSE - MEDALLION
text: round the corpse's neck. The Locksley crest.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Noooooo!
text: A paroxysm of rage and grief. He smashes furniture.
text: Slams his fists relentlessly into the wall. Pained,
text: Aslan looks on.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I should have been here.
text: Spent, he leans against the wall. In the silence, they
text: hear an eerie TAPPING. Robin draws his sword... A
text: hunched, old man emerges, walking with the aid of a staff
dialog: ... Duncan.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: (shaking him)
dialog: Damn you, Duncan. Why didn't you
dialog: cut him down?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Master Robin, is it you? A
dialog: miracle. I thought God had
dialog: abandoned us.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: You left my father to hang like
dialog: a common thief, carrion for the
text: crows.
speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: Easy... Look at him.
text: Duncan steps into the moonlight. His face crudely-
dialog: scarred.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: What has happened?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: They say they captured him
text: worshipping with the Druids. He
dialog: signed a confession before the
dialog: Bishop of Hereford.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Did they have witnesses?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Just one. Kenneth of Cowfall.
dialog: The Bishop decreed all the Locksley
dialog: lands forfeit.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Did you believe the charges?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Not even when they took my eyes.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Who did this to you, Duncan?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
text: Guy of Gisborne. With the sheriff
text: looking on.
text: Robin holds the old retainer to his chest. Stares into
text: the night in silent rage.
dialog: 24.
scene_heading: EXT. NOTTINGHAM CASTLE - NIGHT
text: Marked contrast. A forbidding fortress. Cliff-like
dialog: battlements.
scene_heading: INT. NOTTINGHAM CASTLE - NIGHT
text: Face like thunder, Guy of Gisborne strides up curving,
text: stone steps. A long corridor leads to a guarded oak
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: SENTRY
dialog: Sir Guy. His Lordship is not to
dialog: be disturbed.
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: Away, fool.
text: He shoves the Sentry aside.
scene_heading: EXT. CASTLE BATTLEMENTS - NIGHT
text: Torches illuminate Nottingham's face. Chilling cruelty
text: in Manson-like eyes. Seated, his manicured hand dis-
text: tractedly strokes a semi-naked girl. She sits at his
text: feet like a frightened dog. When Gisborne enters, she
dialog: covers up.
speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: Who bade you cover up?
text: He smashes his fist into his chair. She timidly
text: uncovers.
speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: Cousin, I trust you justify your
dialog: intrusion with news of profound
dialog: value.
text: His attention is riveted on a dark niche in the corner of
text: the courtyard. UNEARTHLY SOUNDS emanate from the black-
dialog: ness.
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: I met a hooded man today. He bade
dialog: me warn you not to harm his
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: His name?
speaker_heading: GISBORNE

speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
text: Ha! The prodigal son returns. He

speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: This whelp bested five of my men
text: in the blink of an eye.
speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: Your men were probably drunk. Yet
dialog: you survived, cousin?
text: Heavy scorn. The sheriff pats Gisborne's hand like a
text: child's. The voice from the darkness becomes a loud
text: CHANT. A wrinkled, monkey-like figure dances INTO VIEW,
dialog: wearing a necklace of human fingers. You might think
dialog: she was a hundred years old, if not for her incredible
scene_heading: agility. MORTIANNA.
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: You brought her here?
speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: Quiet!
text: The crone's fingers dart into a bag. Emerge with a
text: writhing, SQUEALING mass... a PIGLET. A knife flashes.
text: Blood spurts into an ornate, sacred platter.
text: The girl flinches in horror. Mortianna shakes the con-
text: tents of a pouch across the bloody dish. Carved bone
dialog: dice -- Runes.
text: She rattles the platter. The rune symbols dance in
text: trails of blood. Eyes vacant, mouth frothing, she hisses
text: out her incoherent visions. Nottingham follows her every
dialog: move. A connoisseur.
speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: What do you see?
speaker_heading: MORTIANNA
dialog: Change the seat of power.
speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: London?
speaker_heading: MORTIANNA

speaker_heading: MORTIANNA

speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM

speaker_heading: MORTIANNA

text: The idea takes shape in Nottingham's mind. Mounting
dialog: intensity.
speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: Ally with royal blood. What else
dialog: do you see?
speaker_heading: MORTIANNA
dialog: Armies.
speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: Whose?
speaker_heading: MORTIANNA
dialog: Yours. Men and weaponry in great

speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: And victory?
speaker_heading: MORTIANNA
dialog: Much blood will be spilled.
speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: Whose?
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: A dice splashes blood. Lands -- a death's head symbol.
text: Mortianna hammers the platter. The dice spins and lands
text: again. Again the grinning skull.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: The tray smashes to the ground. The hag runs at
dialog: Gisborne.
speaker_heading: MORTIANNA
dialog: Who have you seen?!

speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: What is wrong?
speaker_heading: MORTIANNA
dialog: I have seen my death.
text: She whimpers. Spins, as if fearing invisible intruders.
speaker_heading: MORTIANNA
dialog: The painted man. He haunts my
dialog: dreams.
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
text: Locksley has a companion. A dark-
dialog: skinned foreigner. He had the
text: marked skin of Islam.
text: Mortianna trembles like an epileptic. Eyes wide with
dialog: terror.
speaker_heading: MORTIANNA
dialog: Kill them! Kill them!
text: She throws herself at Nottingham for protection. He
text: caresses her. Gisborne is thunderstruck.
speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: Cousin. Prove to Locksley that
dialog: your survival was his last mistake.
speaker_heading: MORTIANNA
dialog: (frantic)
dialog: And the painted man! Kill him.
speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM

text: He continues to stroke her. Her trembling subsides.
speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: You have done well, Mortianna.
dialog: Exceedingly well. No one shall
dialog: harm you, I swear it.

text: girl's hand.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Draws it to his mouth, as if to kiss it... and bites down

dialog: (to Mortianna)

speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Our last words in this world were
dialog: spoken in anger. He called the

speaker_heading: ASLAN

speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: I do not need a guardian.
text: She turns to face him. Streaming tears.
speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: My brother is dead. You cannot
text: take his place.
text: Robin grabs and holds her.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Marian, I don't want to replace
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: What do you want?
text: Their eyes meet... a sudden intimacy between them. Robin
text: moves closer. Marian begins to respond, then pulls away.
speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: This is wrong.
text: She runs back to the house. Robin stares after her.
text: Aslan appears in the doorway with Duncan.
speaker_heading: ASLAN
text: Robin! The old man hears horses.
text: Approaching fast.
text: He runs to a bluff... a column of soldiers snakes up the
text: hillside.
speaker_heading: ASLAN
text: Twenty or more. In battle armor.
speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: Soldiers coming here? Is this
dialog: your protection?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I killed some of the Sheriff's
dialog: men. I fear I have placed you in
dialog: danger.
speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: I can take care of myself. There
dialog: are horses in the stable. Go!
text: Aslan runs into the stables.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I'm not leaving.
text: Marian ices him with a glare. Aslan reappears, with two
text: bareback horses. Soldiers appear on the crest, led by
text: Gisborne... With a mischievous grin, Marian runs to the
dialog: soldiers.
speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: Stop them! They're stealing my
dialog: horses!
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Damn the girl! Aslan, can you
dialog: ride?
text: In answer, Aslan grins. Leaps onto a horse. With a
text: single swift move he hoists Duncan up behind him and digs
text: in his heels. The mare leaps forward, and over the
dialog: estate wall.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: He can ride.
text: He heads his horse at the wall. It stumbles. Barely
text: clears it. Stones fly. Robin struggles to hold on.
text: Marian stands directly in Gisborne's path.
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: You have been sheltering outlaws,
dialog: Lady Marian.
speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: They're thieves, you imbecile.
dialog: Bring back my horses, or the
dialog: Sheriff will know of your
dialog: cowardice.
text: Gisborne knows she is lying.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: You're lucky he didn't steal your
dialog: virtue too.
dialog: (to his men)
dialog: A crown to the man who brings me
text: Locksley's head.
text: He leads the pursuit. A SOLDIER hangs back. Grabs
text: Marian's hair.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: A kiss for me, Saxon bitch.
speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: Kiss this!
text: She unsheathes the dagger from under her skirt. Jabs
text: the blade into his wrist.
speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: Try me again, if you want to
text: leave a hand behind.
text: Shocked and pained, the man gallops away. Marian looks
text: down at her dagger hand. It shakes violently.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREAM
text: Water erupts under hooves. Aslan fords a stream. Duncan
text: hangs on for dear life. Robin strives to keep up. Half
text: a mile behind Gisborne splits up his men.
text: Trying for a short cut, Robin finds himself at the
text: steepest part of the river gorge. His horse balks at the
text: drop. Robin flails at his mount with hands and feet. It
text: backs away.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Damn you, animal!
text: Aslan shouts from the far bank.
speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: Treat it like a woman.
text: Robin continues to hit his horse and hurl abuse. Closing
text: in, the soldiers unfurl their crossbows. A flight of
text: BOLTS WHISTLES ominously close to Robin. He must jump or
dialog: die.
speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: Have you never had a woman?
dialog: Gently, man. Soothe it!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Of course I've had a woman!
dialog: Come on, pretty one.
text: He pats the horse soothingly. The animal edges forward.
speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: Softly. With your knees.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I know! I know!
text: The soldiers reload. Robin urges the horse at the steep
dialog: drop.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Easy, easy.
text: Another wave of crossbow bolts. Robin launches the
text: frightened animal into space. Hooves flail... touch
text: down. Scramble up the other bank. Robin
text: enthusiastically pats the horse's neck.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I love you!
text: The first two pursuers misjudge their leaps. Their
text: mounts land sprawling in the riverbed.
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Robin of the Hood! Son of the
dialog: devil worshipper.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: What is your pleasure, Gisborne?
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: It was I who strung your father's
dialog: corpse to the castle gate. My
dialog: pleasure will be in doing the same
dialog: to you.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: You survived one meeting. Our next
dialog: will be your last.
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: Your father died a coward, cursing
dialog: your name and squealing like a

speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: That's a lie!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Incensed, he is losing his judgement.
speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: Come, Robin! He is trying to
dialog: anger you into a trap.
text: A shaft pierces the flank of Robin's horse. It rears in
text: fright. Robin clings on. Six soldiers, the men Gisborne
text: split off, are climbing the embankment towards him.
text: Robin regains control. Rides right at them. Scatters
text: them, and takes off again. Gisborne yells at his men to
dialog: follow.
text: Robin and Aslan ride flat out. Open land turns to scrub.
text: Seeing no followers, Robin pulls up and dismounts.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: We have lost them. I'll lame this
dialog: mare if I ask her to go any farther.
text: He gently extracts the shaft from his horse. Aslan opens
text: his pouch. Pulls out two shiny clear pebbles and a square
text: leather hide. Rolls the pebbles into the tube and holds
text: it to his eye. A primitive telescope.
text: Robin watches, curious.
speaker_heading: SCOPE POV
text: Through the scope we see the movement on the hill behind
dialog: them.
text: BACK TO SCENE
speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: Here they come. Look.
text: Robin puts the device to his eye...
speaker_heading: SCOPE POV
dialog: The soldiers are close!
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: He reacts in shock. Prepares to defend himself. Then
text: realizes they are still in the distance.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Is this Arab magic?
speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: No. Arab science.
text: He replaces the tube in his pouch.
speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: How did your uneducated
dialog: kind ever take Jerusalem?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: God knows!
text: Aslan laughs. Robin points towards an endless expanse of
dialog: trees.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: We can lose them in the forest.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Sherwood is haunted, Master.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Either we take our chances
dialog: with the ghosts, or become
dialog: ghosts ourselves.
text: He remounts. They race into the trees. Gisborne's men
text: thunder up,... slowing as they enter the forest. Peering
text: around them in trepidation, they slowly rein in. Robin
text: looks back.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: They're not following.
text: Gisborne curses his men, urging them on.
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: Come on, damn you! There are
text: only three of them.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: It's not the men we fear, sir.
text: Eerie HOWLING and RATTLING of bones. Aslan draws his
dialog: sword.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
text: Banshees. They say they fly in
dialog: your mouth and suck you dry of
dialog: blood before you can scream.
text: He wraps his scarf over his mouth.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Be quiet! Listen.
text: WIND GUSTS the trees in angry waves. Emits deathly
text: SHRIEKS. The HORSES WHINNEY. Unnerved, Aslan smites
text: around him with his scimitar. Wheels at the sounds,
text: striking only air.
speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: Allah protect us from the evil
dialog: spirits.
text: Duncan clings to his back. Robin points.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Behind you!
text: Aslan slashes out, futilely.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: No, there! And there!
text: Aslan flails. Robin cracks up.
speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: Cease your mad laughing. I can
dialog: feel them.
text: Robin reaches into the branches. Pulls out a string of
text: hollowed wooden tubes -- WINDCHIMES. Dozens of such
text: strings on all the trees. He blows over the hollow end.
text: A low chilling MOAN.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Here are your ghosts, Duncan. A
dialog: child's toy put to good use. You
dialog: scare easily, my painted Saladin.
text: His laughter is broken by a piercing YELL. A red-
text: jacketed figure swings down out of a tree on a rope.
text: Catapults him to the ground.
text: The bushes are instantly alive. Shaggy, wild-eyed men,
text: armed with cudgels, scythes and hayforks. Twelfth-
text: century Hell's Angels. The red-jacketed young turk, WILL
text: SCARLET, leaps around Robin.
speaker_heading: WILL SCARLET
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Ring around the rosie!
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Aslan!
text: Aslan makes no move to intervene.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The woodsmen eye the bizarre stranger, keeping their
text: distance from him. Will kicks at Robin, who tries to
text: grab him. Will skips out of range. Robin falls.
speaker_heading: WILL SCARLET
dialog: Atishoo, Atishoo. We all fall
dialog: down. Beg for mercy, rich man.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I beg of no man. Which of you
dialog: scum has guts enough to face
dialog: me man to man?
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Yeah, bollocks, mate.
text: Robin looks up... I mean up! A towering figure. Seven
text: feet of grinning, muscled brute. The giant extends a
text: vice that passes for a hand. Hauls Robin to his feet.
text: His eyes twinkle with merriment. His whole body shakes
text: when he laughs, which is often.
speaker_heading: JOHN LITTLE
dialog: What are ya, m'old cock?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Er... Robin...
text: He pauses, checking the faces of the angry peasants.
speaker_heading: ROBIN

speaker_heading: JOHN LITTLE
dialog: John Little. Bestman o' the
dialog: woods.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Bestman? You lead this rabble?
speaker_heading: WILL SCARLET
dialog: We waste time. Tax him.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Tax? For what?
speaker_heading: WILL SCARLET
dialog: For passage through Sherwood.
speaker_heading: ROBIN

dialog: my sword.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: WILL SCARLET
text: A man who travels with two servants
dialog: and claims he's without money, is
dialog: either a fool or a liar.
text: Grabbing Robin, Little shakes him like a doll. Something
text: CLINKS. Robin's father's medallion. Laughing heartily,
text: Little rips it from Robin's neck and tosses it to Scarlet.
speaker_heading: WILL SCARLET
dialog: And this one is a liar.
dialog: (he bites the metal)
dialog: Ahah! Gold!
text: The men cheer. John snatches the medallion back from
dialog: Will.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: That is sacred to me.
speaker_heading: JOHN LITTLE
dialog: Sacred to us too, mush. This
dialog: here'll feed us for a bloomin'

speaker_heading: ROBIN

speaker_heading: WULF
dialog: Wait, father! I know him.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: This man is your father? Tell him
dialog: how I saved your hide from the
dialog: Sheriff's soldiers. That deserves
dialog: some gratitude, I believe.
text: He reaches for the medallion. John pulls it away.
speaker_heading: JOHN LITTLE

speaker_heading: WULF
dialog: Be careful, Father. He fights

speaker_heading: JOHN LITTLE
dialog: Is that so?

text: lunges for Robin's wrist. Wrenches the sword free.
text: Bends it into a pretzel.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Aslan!
text: Aslan shrugs. Robin swings a fist into the giant's gut.
text: John doesn't flinch. Hoists Robin off the ground with
text: one arm. Cannonballs the other fist into Robin's
text: stomach. Robin folds.
speaker_heading: WILL SCARLET
dialog: Oh dear! The little rich boy is
dialog: lost for words. Thanks for the
dialog: taxes, Locksley.
speaker_heading: JOHN LITTLE
dialog: And for the laughs.
text: The woodsmen find this hysterical. They disappear into
text: the tree. Will administers one final kick before
text: leaving. Robin staggers to his feet. Glares furiously
dialog: at Aslan.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Son of an Arab whore! Once again
dialog: your assistance was invaluable.
speaker_heading: ASLAN

scene_heading: EXT. FOREST CLEARING - DAY

speaker_heading: ROBIN

dialog: without paying tax.
speaker_heading: JOHN LITTLE

speaker_heading: JOHN LITTLE
dialog: Alright, m'old cock. You wanna
dialog: nuther good wallopin'?
text: His confidence melting, Robin glances back at Duncan
text: and Aslan, who grins like a fan at a boxing match. John
text: storms at Robin. Staffs thrash. Driven back, Robin
text: connects a blow on John's foot.
text: The giant is off-balance. Robin follows up. Lands a
text: couple to the ribs. John responds with heavy swings,
text: which Robin blocks deftly. Back and forth, blow for
text: blow, all blocked. John chuckles with every swing.
text: Enjoying the time of his life.
text: Their staffs lock. It's strength against strength.
text: Robin is no match. With one mighty thrust, John
text: hurtles him into the stream. The woodsmen cheer loudly.
text: Aslan watches impassively.
text: Robin scrambles back onto the bridge. John waits,
text: grinning.
speaker_heading: JOHN LITTLE
dialog: Lil' wet behind the ears, mate?
speaker_heading: WILL SCARLET
dialog: Don't fool with him. Get him!
text: John charges. Robin fends him off, gets in some shots
text: of his own. John swings in a giant arc. Robin ducks.
text: John loses balance and falls to his knees. Robin allows
dialog: him time to right himself.
text: John comes at him again, pummeling. Wood splinters from
dialog: the impact. Brute force versus agility. Agility is
text: beginning to prevail, when Robin's staff splits in two.
speaker_heading: JOHN LITTLE
dialog: Swimmin' time again, ol' chum.
text: The coup de grace. Lands heavily. Robin teeters.
text: Falls. Disappears under the foaming water... does not

speaker_heading: JOHN LITTLE
dialog: Help! Cain't bloody swim.
text: He submerges again. Robin pulls his head above water.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Do you yield?

dialog: surface.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Do you yield?
speaker_heading: JOHN LITTLE
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Good. Now put your feet down.

speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Pay me the tax.
text: A tense pause while all wait for Little's reaction.

speaker_heading: LITTLE JOHN
dialog: That be Hal Brownwell, but the

scene_heading: EXT. CITY GATE - DAY
text: Robin taps his way through the crowd. Past the piercing

speaker_heading: MARIAN

speaker_heading: ROBIN

speaker_heading: MARIAN

speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Under the Sheriff's law, that's

speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: He's put a price on your head.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: How much?
speaker_heading: MARIAN
text: A hundred gold pieces.
speaker_heading: ROBIN

text: That gleam of insanity. Robin watches from a distance.
speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: I would like to see that, my lord.
text: The Sheriff places his hand possessively on her shoulder.
speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: My dear, a woman of your refinement

speaker_heading: MARIAN

speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: Fear not, my dear Sheriff. He will

speaker_heading: BEGGAR

scene_heading: EXT. NOTTINGHAM CATHEDRAL - DAY
text: Robin runs to the courtyard and leaps on the Sheriff's

speaker_heading: ROBIN

speaker_heading: WILL SCARLET

speaker_heading: ROBIN

text: Robin is stripped to the waist, his muscled skin ravaged

speaker_heading: ASLAN

text: Will bends, as if checking the horse's legs. Secretly
text: grabs a handful of sand. Swings into the saddle and digs
text: in his heels.
text: Closing in, Will flings the sand in Robin's eyes. Robin
text: clutches his hands to his face, blinded. Will spins
text: back to the attack.
text: His sword slashes. Reacting to the sound, Robin rolls
text: aside. The men cheer like a big fight crowd.
text: Robin's POV is blurred. Ducking the blade, he grabs
text: Will's arm. A blow glances off his shoulder.
text: Robin falls to his knees, still blinded. Will rides
text: right at him, to trample him. Robin scrambles away.
text: Will wheels his horse. A flashing hoof grazes Robin's
dialog: chest.
text: Robin leaps to his feet and yells at the top of his
text: lungs. Panicked, the HORSE rears, WHINNYING wildly.
text: Will struggles to stay in the saddle. Loses his sword.

speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: The horse is smarter than you are,

text: Robin ducks right under the horse's belly.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Here, Will! You aim like a girl,
dialog: Will!
text: Will stabs wildly, more and more frustrated. Laughter
text: spreads, as Robin plays hide and seek around the horse's
text: legs. Grabbing the end of the spear, he clowns a tug
dialog: of war.
text: Enraged, Will strains and tries to kick Robin away.
text: Suddenly, Robin lets go. Unbalanced, Will flies back-
text: wards off his mount.
text: Robin snatches the spear and raises it over his fallen
text: adversary. The crowd falls silent. Robin strikes. The
text: point quivers in the ground below Will's crotch. Will
text: wriggles in terror. Impaled, his pants rip open.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Thank the Lord you are not endowed
dialog: like Bull.
text: The crowd is convulsed with laughter. Robin catches his
text: breath. Does not see Will, who grabs a heavy staff and

text: about to strike.
speaker_heading: LITTLE JOHN
dialog: Bollocks, Will. Jus' bugger off,

speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Let's go.
text: Together they run down the hill, keeping low.
text: Gisborne eyes the forest. The beer cart is steered by a
text: fat red-faced FRIAR, raucously singing hymns and quaffing
text: from a jug, which he repeatedly dips into one of the
dialog: barrels.
text: ARROWS WHISTLE in. The Friar yells and drops his jug. A
text: soldier is hit. At the forest edge, four woodsmen reload
text: their longbows. Dressed in green, their faces
text: camouflaged.
text: The mounted soldiers charge them. The woodsmen run into
text: the trees. As the horsemen close in, the runners leap
text: into a trench. Lift up matted screens of brush and
text: grass. It's as if they disappeared. The soldiers slash
text: wildly at the thick screens.
text: More arrows fly. More soldiers fall. The others spin
text: in confusion, trying to discern the enemy. More woods-
text: men break from cover. Run down a narrow path. Gisborne
text: urges his men to pursue. They ride in single file,
text: beating their way through the tangled branches.
text: The runners dive into the trees, as other men haul on
text: ropes, raising a giant screen in the soldiers' path. The
text: horses swerve, on the edge of a twenty-foot drop to the
text: river gorge. Momentum carries many of them over the
dialog: cliff.
scene_heading: BACK ON ROADWAY
text: Robin and Aslan swing down from the trees onto the tax
text: wagon. Kick down the two drivers and take the reins,
text: steering the wagon off the road. The archers inside are
text: unable to fire at them.
text: Little John leaps onto the beer cart, sending the Friar
text: hurtling back among the barrels. The Friar slams his
text: head and drops unconscious. John whips the horse,

text: his feet.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Ah, I feared as much.
text: He signals to Aslan, who steers the tax wagon into the
text: river. Water floods in through the slits. Inside,

text: The bowmen scramble out. What they see stops them dead.
text: Both banks are men in green, longbows aimed directly at
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: COUNTRYSIDE
text: Sparks. An axe pounds into the lock of a strongbox. The

text: Cheers of celebration.
speaker_heading: LITTLE JOHN

speaker_heading: ROBIN

speaker_heading: ROBIN

speaker_heading: FRIAR
dialog: Giddyup, nag!

speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: You leave when I say.

speaker_heading: FRIAR

speaker_heading: FRIAR

speaker_heading: ROBIN

text: Stripped to the waist, brandishing his scimitar. The
text: Captain tries to back away. Robin tries to restrain
text: Aslan, is hurled aside. Snarling, drooling at the mouth,
text: Aslan explores the Captain's body with his hands. A
text: butcher checking meat.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I strongly advise you to talk.
dialog: He hasn't eaten in weeks.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: (rising terror)
dialog: What does he want?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: You.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: For Godsakes, get him off me!
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: (very deliberately)
dialog: No, Aslan... not this one, Aslan.
dialog: ... How about this other one?...
dialog: Fatter, yes... more meat.
text: The other soldier, who definitely has more flesh on the
text: bone, is struck dumb with horror, as Aslan turns his
text: attention to him. With one swing of his sword, Aslan
text: slices through the man's ropes. Drags him to his feet.
text: Little John runs over.
speaker_heading: LITTLE JOHN
dialog: (urgent)
dialog: No, Robin, no! They be God-fearin'
dialog: men.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I cannot stop him, John. Besides,
dialog: if they will not tell what they
dialog: know, then they must pay the price.
speaker_heading: LITTLE JOHN
dialog: Kill 'em aye, but not like this.
dialog: 'Tain't Christian.
text: Blood-curdling SCREAMS from behind the wagon where Aslan
text: has dragged his victim. The Captain's face pales. Then
dialog: silence.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The demented Arab slowly reappears. Blood drips from his
text: lips. He munches the flesh from a long bone, on the end
text: of which is the soldier's glove... the man's arm.
text: Turning to Robin, Aslan shouts in Arabic and gesticulates
text: wildly at the Captain.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: What does he say?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Well, roughly, he says that he
dialog: doesn't care for the way your
dialog: friend tastes, and he wants you.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: No, God, no! I'll talk. Just
dialog: keep him away. Keep him away!
speaker_heading: BEHIND WAGON
text: Bull holds the other prisoner, muffling the man's mouth

speaker_heading: LITTLE JOHN

speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Thanks to our cannibal friend.
text: Aslan repeats his wildman act, munching on a chunk of

speaker_heading: LITTLE JOHN
dialog: Gonna laugh my bloody balls off.
speaker_heading: BULL
dialog: Why'd the Sheriff be sendin' gold
dialog: north o' the border?
speaker_heading: ROBIN

speaker_heading: LITTLE JOHN
dialog: Aye, the Romans built a bleedin'

speaker_heading: BULL

speaker_heading: ROBIN

scene_heading: INT. CASTLE ARMORY - NIGHT
text: Sparks. Smoke. Sweat. The Sheriff inspects his weapon

text: A DOOR CRASHES open behind him. FOOTSTEPS. Paying no
text: heed, he draws a sword from a furnace. It's blade white-
dialog: hot.
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: We were ambushed. In Sherwood
dialog: Forest.
text: Nottingham tests the sword against an anvil.
speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: Spanish steel, cousin. So much

dialog: Any losses?
speaker_heading: GISBORNE

speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM

speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: Robin Hood.
text: He places a hand reassuringly on his cousin's shoulder.
speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: Cousin, we must be strong. We
dialog: cannot allow this outlaw to make
dialog: fools of us.
text: Without warning, he drives the blade into Gisborne's
dialog: belly.
speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: And I cannot allow a lieutenant
dialog: to fail me.
dialog: (turning to the
dialog: horrified smithy)
text: It is indeed fine steel.
scene_heading: EXT. VILLAGE - DAY
text: A small procession. Tuck drives his cart, Bull the tax

scene_heading: EXT. FOREST POOL - DAY
text: Water, sparkling with sunlight. Bursts, as Robin dives
text: in naked. He luxuriates in the cool water... HOOFBEATS.
text: He attempts to hide... too late. Four horses emerge from
text: the trees. Bull and Hal, with Marian and her servant
text: Sarah sandwiched between them. Bull has a black eye.
text: Marian jumps down.
speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: (to Robin)
dialog: How dare you!
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Good morning, Lady Marian.
text: In response, she starts pelting him with stones.
speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: You send men to drag me from my
text: home in the middle of the night,
dialog: like some slave girl? Is this
dialog: the way the famous Robin Hood
dialog: treats a lady?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Ah well... er, let me finish this

dialog: I'll explain.
speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: I demand an explanation right now!
speaker_heading: ROBIN

speaker_heading: BULL
dialog: The big 'un did the same to me.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAY
text: An arrow flies into a bull's-eye, crudely marked on a

dialog: his shot.
speaker_heading: LITTLE JOHN
dialog: (to Wulf)
dialog: Right m'lad. Let's see how close
dialog: you can git to that bugger.
text: Wulf takes aim. His arrow slices clear through his

text: Wulf on the back and beckons everyone over.
speaker_heading: LITTLE JOHN
dialog: Take a gander at this 'un, mates.
dialog: Never seen nuthin' like it in
dialog: my bloomin' life.
text: Robin leads Marian through the camp... the beginnings of
text: a village -- women doing laundry, kids playing, men prac-
text: ticing archery and swordplay, others working on defenses,
text: camouflaging a giant pit. Marian is impressed, but not
text: about to admit it.
speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: This better be damned important.
text: Robin leads her into a hut. Inside is a trove of cap-
text: tured loot -- purses, jewelry, weaponry, fancy coats

speaker_heading: ROBIN

speaker_heading: MARIAN

text: A beat. She checks the faces. Her eyes meet Robin's.
dialog: Is there a hint of concern for him also?
speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: What do you want from me?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Nottingham was sending this gold
dialog: to buy reinforcements from the

speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: Nottingham would not dare

speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: The King is not in England to

dialog: (Marian masks her
dialog: concern)
dialog: You are Richard's cousin. You
dialog: can get word to him. He would

speaker_heading: MARIAN

speaker_heading: MARIAN

scene_heading: INT. DUBOIS MANSION - DAY

scene_heading: INT. BISHOP'S CASTLE - DAY

speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: It is a personal matter, my Lord,

speaker_heading: BISHOP

speaker_heading: MARIAN

speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: My dear, I could not vouch for

speaker_heading: ROBIN

speaker_heading: ASLAN

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CAVES
text: SQUAWKING ominously, CROWS burst from the trees. Robin
text: rides up the path to the caves that his father took.
text: Checks the ground. Horse tracks. He dismounts, moves
text: cautiously forward.
scene_heading: POV THROUGH SCOPE - CIRCLE OF STONES
text: No one visible. Debris. Smoke rises from ashes.
text: Remnants of a recent ceremony.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Robin climbs silently down the rocks into the stone
text: circle. There is blood on the sacrificial altar.
text: Through the opening of the cave, he spies a woman's form,
text: lying face down.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Marian!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He runs forward. Turns the body over. Skin chalk-white
text: from loss of blood... Sarah! A shadow falls across
text: Robin. Before he can react, a cudgel stuns him into
dialog: blackness.
scene_heading: INT. CAVE - DAY
text: Robin's eyes -- he wakes. Squints around him, the dark
text: smoke-filled recesses of the caves. The walls weave.
text: Eerie WATERY sounds, like the CRIES of drowning men.
text: He tries to stand.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Robin!... Robin!
text: A figure in a flowing white robe. Angelic. Floating
text: towards him... Marian. He tries to speak her name.
text: Reaches out his hand.
speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: Death is not to be feared,
dialog: Robin. Embrace it.
text: Her LAUGH ECHOES around the cave, as if hundreds of lost
text: souls are laughing with her. Robin crawls away, cover-
text: ing his ears. Marian lifts his face to hers.
speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: Drink this.
text: Weakly, Robin tries to push away the cup. Her hand
text: grips his chin, forcing his mouth open.
speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: Drink.
text: The liquid trickles over his lips. He tries to focus.
text: Her features are BLURRED, her voice hypnotic.
speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: Look at me. Listen to me. You
dialog: belong to me. Your soul is mine.
dialog: You will obey my every word. Do
dialog: you understand?
text: Her face is inches from his. He tries to pull away, his
text: subconscious sounding alarms.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Why, Marian?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: Because you love me. Say it.

dialog: Say it!
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: (sinking)
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: Kiss me.
text: He gives himself to her. Their lips meet... something
text: changes in his vision. Her eyes glow red. Her face
text: starts to shrivel -- He is kissing the wrinkled lips of
dialog: Mortianna.
text: He pulls away... strong arms grab him. He shakes his
text: head, trying to make sense. Through his BLURRED vision,
text: we see he is surrounded by masked men.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: (slurred)
dialog: Where is Marian?
speaker_heading: MORTIANNA
text: She is with friends.
dialog: (cackles)
dialog: Your resistence is strong, but
dialog: useless. Sign this.
dialog: (as quill is forced
dialog: into his hand)
dialog: You are a Druid like your father.
dialog: You consort with the devil. Your
dialog: confession will be witnessed by
dialog: the Bishop of Hereford.
text: A guard forces Robin's hand across the page... then
text: cries out, clutching his back... An arrow lodged be-
text: tween his shoulders.
text: In the cave mouth are Wulf, bow in hand, Bull kneeling
text: beside Sarah's corpse, and Aslan.
speaker_heading: MORTIANNA
dialog: (horror)
dialog: The painted man!
text: Aslan's war CRY RICHOCHETS off the cave walls. A curved
text: scimitar in one hand, a straight English sword in the
text: other, his arms are lethal windmills. The masked guards
text: are cut down left and right. Mortianna retreats, scurry-
text: ing into the depths of the cave.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Bull joins the fray, charging like his namesake, howling
text: in rage, flailing at heads with his quarterstaff. Wulf
text: stays in the mouth, picking off men with deadly accuracy.
text: A furious melee. Bull and Aslan mow down the enemy like
text: hay, battling far superior odds. Soon they are the only
text: two left standing. Bull peers cautiously into the dark-
text: ness. Behind him, one of his victims crawls back to his
text: feet... and lunges.
speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: Behind you!
text: Too late. A sword is driven through Bull's gut. Aslan
text: grabs the attacker by the neck and pile-drives him into
text: the cave wall. The man's SKULL CRACKS against the rocks.
text: Aslan runs to Robin's side, as Wulf hurries to Bull's.
text: Robin is slumped against a rock.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: (groggy)
dialog: Marian?
text: Aslan runs to the back of the cave, searching. Wulf is
text: crouched beside Bull, who murmurs his dying words.
speaker_heading: BULL
dialog: Ya be sure Sarah gits a Christian
dialog: burial. Promise me, boy.
speaker_heading: WULF
dialog: I promise.
text: Aslan stumbles at the edge of a deep crevasse. Far be-
text: low he sees Mortianna, clambering down the steep rock.
text: For a second their eyes meet. She hisses -- venom,
text: hatred, fear -- then is gone.
scene_heading: EXT. GREGOR CAVES - DAY
text: Aslan carries Robin outside. Robin is staggering,
text: glassy-eyed, mumbling incoherently. His arm blocks
text: the light from his eyes.
speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: They have poisoned you. There
dialog: are herbs that can alter a man's
dialog: brain. I know of only one cure.
text: He drops to one knee, slams Robin violently across the
text: other. Slaps him on the back and forces his fingers
text: down his throat.

speaker_heading: ASLAN

scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY LANE - DAY

text: in front of him.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: You have fulfilled your vow. Now

speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: Your gratitude warms my heart.
speaker_heading: ROBIN

speaker_heading: ASLAN

speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Because of you, another good man

speaker_heading: ASLAN

speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: To hell with your damn vow.
speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: I am glad you are feeling

speaker_heading: ROBIN

scene_heading: EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DAY
text: Fire. Blazing rampant.
text: Along a hillside are hundreds of crossbowmen with fire
text: arrows. At a shouted order, another wave of flaming
text: arrows ignites the trees.
text: Behind the crossbowmen are two figures on horseback.
text: One is the Sheriff, in full armor. The other is the
text: black-clad Celtic chieftain. He sits as still as a rock.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAY
text: Chaos. Acrid black smoke pours across the clearing.

speaker_heading: LITTLE JOHN

speaker_heading: LITTLE JOHN

speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: I want prisoners.

speaker_heading: CHIEFTAIN
dialog: We came to fight.
speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: Nevertheless, I need prisoners.

text: Instantly a tumultuous chilling roar from his warriors.
text: They charge forward.
scene_heading: EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DAY

text: From the other side of the flaming trees, Little John's
text: men pick off shots with their longbows. They retreat,
text: turn and fire again.
text: They back into a clearing... The Celtic mercenaries
text: charge at them across the open ground. The woodsmen
text: drop their bows. Hand-to-hand combat. Woodsmen are
text: being decimated.
text: Little John storms and shouts, cutting down the enemy,
text: inspiring his men. The Scotsmen are awed by this giant.
text: Tuck is confronted by a wild-eyed Celt.
speaker_heading: FRIAR
dialog: Surely you would not harm a man
dialog: of the cloth?
text: The man swings, Tuck sidesteps.
speaker_heading: FRIAR
dialog: You would? Then to hellfire with
dialog: you.
text: He pummels the man to the ground with his staff.
text: The woodsmen are broken into two groups. One group,
text: including Will, is surrounded and surrenders. The others
dialog: fight on.
text: Bleeding from several wounds, Little John is surrounded
text: by four Celts. He spins, challenging them, spitting out
text: expletives. Defiant to the last... suddenly his

text: them, slashing with his sword.
speaker_heading: LITTLE JOHN
dialog: 'Bout bleedin' time, mush.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Aslan is a wild man. Steering his horse with just legs

text: edge of the clearing. Starts picking off stragglers.
text: His father spots him.
speaker_heading: LITTLE JOHN
dialog: Git the bleedin' 'ell outa there,
dialog: ya li'l bugger.
text: Distracted, he doesn't see a Celt swing at his back...

text: freezes in mid-air, before toppling at John's feet.
text: When John turns back, Wulf is being dragged away by
text: three of the Sherrif's men. He attempts to pursue, but
text: is intercepted by two more Celts... and struck down.
text: Aslan charges between the two Celts. Slashes down
text: with both swords. Both men topple to the ground
dialog: simultaneously.
text: Suddenly all is quiet. The smoking clearing is a mass
text: of fallen bodies. Only four men seem to be alive.
text: Robin, Aslan, Tuck, who is slouched against a tree
text: gasping for breath, and Hal, who kneels clutching his
text: wounded shoulder.

speaker_heading: LITTLE JOHN
dialog: Don't 'ee start bleedin'

scene_heading: EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DUSK

scene_heading: EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - NIGHT

speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: My pride brought us to this.
speaker_heading: ASLAN

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: NOVEMBER MOON

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: ITS NEGATIVE IMAGE
text: -- a black circle against a white sky. An executioner.
text: The round medallion has become a noose.
text: In the noose appears Wulf's face. The executioner hauls
text: on the rope and Wulf's features contort in the agony of
text: death. Another noose, another face... Duncan. Another
dialog: -- Bull. Another -- Marian.
speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: Kiss me, Robin.
text: The noose tightens on her neck. As she dies, her face
text: shrivels into the cackling features of Mortianna.
text: Next, Robin's father. He stares accusingly right AT us.
speaker_heading: LOCKSLEY
dialog: Why have you betrayed me? Why?
text: Before he pulls the rope, the executioner peels back his

text: cacophony.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

scene_heading: INT. DUNGEON - DUSK
text: The sound of the gallows ECHOES inside the damp, stone

speaker_heading: ASLAN

speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: We have no armored knights, no

scene_heading: INT. CASTLE CHAMBER - DAY
text: ... Mortianna's apothecary. Dark, smoke-filled. Foul

speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: How is my bride?

speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: Get away from me, you disgusting
dialog: hag. I will not... augh!
text: The guards viciously restrain her, forcing her mouth

text: drug takes its effect. She slumps forward. Nottingham
text: watches with amusement.
speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: (to Mortianna)
dialog: When we are married, thirty of the
dialog: northern barons will pledge me
dialog: their support as king. As you
dialog: predicted.
text: Mortianna squats on the floor besides a platter of blood.
text: Clasps the dice-like runes.
speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: What do you see in the portents?
text: Mortianna rocks on her heels, clutching her taloned hands
text: to her sides. She chants, fingering the bloody stones.
speaker_heading: MORTIANNA
text: The union. The blood of the lion
dialog: and the house of Nottingham. New
dialog: faith. New power. New souls.

speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM

speaker_heading: MORTIANNA
dialog: Without me, you are nothing. You

dialog: (as Nottingham
dialog: laughs)
dialog: Laugh, fool. I birthed you from

dialog: are my son.
dialog: (Nottingham is

scene_heading: EXT. DUNGEON GATE - DAY
text: Wulf blinks at the sunlight as the prisoners are led out.
text: Holds his head high. Soldiers hurl abuse, the people are

text: crosses herself and scurries into the castle, unnoticed.
text: On horseback, encircled by guards, the Sheriff and his
text: baron cronies watch the outlaws progress with cruel
text: amusement. A yell attracts Nottingham. Will is being
text: shoved back by guards.
speaker_heading: WILL SCARLET
dialog: Sheriff! My Lord Sheriff! I have
dialog: word for you! Of Robin Hood!
text: Nottingham shouts to one of his mounted guards, who rides

speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: Ah, the turncoat. Did you succeed?
speaker_heading: WILL SCARLET

speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM

speaker_heading: WILL SCARLET

speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: Locksley, here? Where ?

speaker_heading: WILL SCARLET

speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM

speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: Damn your worthless hide! Just

speaker_heading: WILL SCARLET
dialog: The reward!
text: The parade of prisoners reaches them. Seeing Will, Wulf

speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM

dialog: You'll get your reward. Where

scene_heading: EXT. SCAFFOLD

scene_heading: EXT. CITY WALL - DAY
text: A massive oak stands near the southern wall. A large
text: figure climbs to its uppermost branches. Little John.
text: He scrambles from the tree, starts to climb the wall
text: itself. He slips frequently.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
text: The prisoners are led to the scaffold, where the hooded

text: staggers, from his beating.
text: Nottingham's men encircle Tuck's cart. He watches them
dialog: nervously.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY PARAPET - DAY
text: Fanny lowers a knotted rope over the battlement. Far
text: below, John clings to the outer wall. Above him it's
text: sheer, without footholds. The rope doesn't reach his
text: fingertips. He stretches, loses balance. Falls...
text: desperately grabbing at the rope. He swings, clinging
text: by one arm, his body smashing into the wall.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
text: Will leads the Sheriff to Tuck's cart.
speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: Step down, friar.
speaker_heading: FRIAR
dialog: As you wish, sire. Is there
dialog: something amiss?
speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: This man claims you have outlaws

dialog: them the cursed Robin Hood.
text: Tuck glares at Will with unconcealed hatred.

speaker_heading: WILL SCARLET
dialog: Try another. There are many

text: A drum roll. The Sheriff's attention turns to the
text: scaffold, where the first victim is escorted up the
dialog: steps -- Wulf.
text: Tense, Tuck pulls a tinder box from his robes, strikes
text: a flame.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY PARAPET - DAY
text: John strains, heaving his giant frame up the rope. He
text: nears the top, just as a SENTRY approaches. Fanny blocks
text: the man's view.
speaker_heading: SENTRY
dialog: What is your business, woman?
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Ain't doin' no 'arm, m'dear.
dialog: Likes a good 'angin', I do. Luvly
dialog: view up 'ere, ain't it?
text: She gestures below. The Sentry looks, then turns back to

text: his head into the stone battlement. Twice. Three times.
text: He slumps unconscious.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
text: Wulf crosses himself as the executioner steers him to the
text: noose. A hush falls... except for a rotund old woman who
text: is barging to the front. And a WOUNDED SOLDIER, his head
text: bandaged, who eases her path, striking out with his tree-
text: branch crutch.
scene_heading: WOUNDED SOLDIER
dialog: Give room for a fightin' man and
dialog: his ma. Step aside, or I'll make

text: She wrenches the longbow from his back, fumbles for an
dialog: arrow.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: We be too late.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
text: The scaffold is impregnable. Celts and their Chieftain
text: guard the platform itself. The Sherriff's men surround
dialog: the base.
text: The executioner encircles Wulf's neck with the noose.
text: SPARKS! Tuck ignites a fuse-cord leading to one of the
dialog: barrels.
text: A hand tightens the noose... Another grasps an arrow.
text: The executioner's eyes glint through the slits.
text: Nottingham intently watches Wulf.
text: The Chieftain stands, impassive.
text: Fingers close on a bowstring... the fuse-cord burns.
text: Wulf steps to the trap, ready to plunge. His eyes close.
text: An arrow flies... slices through the executioner's eye
dialog: slit.
text: The executioner falls. Little John celebrates... but
text: the Chieftain leaps forward... releases the trap.
text: Wulf's body plunges. The rope snaps tight.
text: Little John yells. Fanny screams.
text: A figure leaps onto the platform... the wounded soldier

text: Wulf dangles, strangling. His hands wrench at the
text: choking cord.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 117.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The burning fuse-cord reaches the barrel. Tuck hurls the

text: The Chieftain smites at Robin... his blow is blocked...
text: by the Celt with the boar's head.
text: KAABOOM! The GUNPOWDER in the barrel EXPLODES. Spewing
text: smoke and wood. SCREAMS of panic. Soldiers fly. Mass
dialog: confusion.
text: Amidst the smoke... Robin's sword slashes through Wulf's
text: rope. He hauls him onto the platform.
text: Another figure on the platform... the old woman. Slashes
text: the ropes of the other prisoners. Whips off her wig...
text: It's Hal. He passes out weapons from a bundle under his
dialog: arm.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Here... By God... Let's fight 'em!
speaker_heading: WOODSMAN

speaker_heading: CHIEFTAIN
dialog: Impostor! You dishonor the clan.

speaker_heading: FROM PARAPET

text: Aslan and the Chieftain are locked in mortal combat.
text: Aslan stumbles back and falls. The Chieftain swipes at

scene_heading: EXPLODES.
text: The Greybeard Baron spots Little John and Fanny on the

scene_heading: GREYBEARD BARON
dialog: Up there! No mercy, shoot them!

speaker_heading: ON SCAFFOLD
text: Wulf guards the steps, beating back all comers.
speaker_heading: ON SCENE
text: Aslan evades the charging Chieftain. Drop-kicks a

text: Chieftain. His blows have no effect on the Scot's black
dialog: armor.
text: The Sheriff rears his horse... hooves flail.. knocking
text: Will to his knees. The Sheriff lunges... Desperate, Will
text: grasps the sword, ignoring the pain... a tug of war.
text: Blood pours from Will's hands, where the blade cuts in.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: WILL SCARLET

speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: Here's another message to Robin
dialog: Hood, written in your blood.
text: He drives his sword repeatedly, insanely, into Will's
dialog: belly.
speaker_heading: WILL SCARLET
dialog: It's over, fool. You can kill my
dialog: body, but you cannot kill our
dialog: spirit.
text: He finally drops... Nottingham heads for the castle.
text: Robin attempts to follow. He swings from the noose,
text: using the rope to vault over the surrounding soldiers.
text: As he lands, he is waylaid by one of the barons and his
dialog: men.
speaker_heading: REDHEAD BARON
dialog: It's Hood! Get him!
text: The Chieftain knocks Aslan down. Aslan loses his sword.
speaker_heading: CHIEFTAIN
dialog: I am iron. I am rock. I am your
dialog: death.
text: Aslan spots one of John's arrows protruding from a dead
text: Celt's back. Scrambles over and tears it out.
speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: You talk too much!
text: He leaps... rams the arrow through the Chieftain's
text: mouthpiece... out the back of his neck. The Chieftain
text: grabs his helmet, trying to rip it off. He topples,
text: his life's blood gushing from both sides of his neck.

speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: Englishmen! I am not one of you,

dialog: aside.
speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: Too slow, fool!
text: He hacks at the ropes. The gate slices down like a

text: Fighting his way towards the gate, Robin sees with dismay
text: that the portcullis is closed. Weakening, he staves off
text: the redhead baron's vicious assault. Suddenly peasants

speaker_heading: ROBIN

scene_heading: INT. DUNGEONS - DAY
text: Carrying a flaming torch, Tuck runs down the dark passage-
text: ways. Before him, an awesome sight... dozens of pitiful
text: men in cages. Suddenly he is confronted by the jailer.
text: A cruel behemoth of a man, carrying a spiked club.
speaker_heading: FRIAR
dialog: (pious)
dialog: My son, there is a holy war being
dialog: waged outside. Release all these
dialog: wretches and God shall surely find
dialog: you a place in heaven.
speaker_heading: JAILER
dialog: I'd rather go to hell!
text: WHAM! Tuck takes the lethal cudgel full in the chest.
text: Flies back.
scene_heading: INT. CASTLE CHAPEL - DAY
text: Sweating, fearful, the Bishop rushes through the service.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: ...your bodies to be bound in
dialog: immortal wedlock. Do you, Marian
dialog: Dubois, take...
text: The chapel DOORS SHATTER inward.
text: Robin backs in, bloodied, fencing with four remaining
text: soldiers. He smashes one by swinging the heavy door into
text: him, hurtles a pew at another. He springs off another
text: pew, taking down a third.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Marian, run! It's me, Robin.
dialog: Run!
text: Marian remains immobile. Mortianna moves to her side.
text: Robin is struck in the thigh. Like a vulture, the
text: Sheriff waits. Tiring, blood pouring from his leg, Robin
text: prepares to fight him.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I warned you, I would find you no

speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: No companions? No army? You rush
dialog: to your death for the sake of a
dialog: woman. Lust has turned you into a
dialog: fool... Recognize this, Locksley?
text: He raises his sword to reveal its handle. A crucifix
text: sculpted into the hilt... Robin's father's sword.
speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: Appropriate I should use it to
dialog: kill you with, don't you think?
text: He lunges. A savage, accomplished swordsman, with fire
text: in his eyes. Exhausted, Robin is driven back, parrying
dialog: desperately.
scene_heading: INT. DUNGEONS - DAY
text: Tuck picks himself up from the floor. The jailer is
dialog: amazed.
speaker_heading: FRIAR
dialog: The Lord helps those who help
dialog: themselves.
text: Grinning, he pulls open his robes, revealing chest armor
text: ... and a miniature powder keg. He holds it to his
text: flaming torch and tosses it to the jailer... Stupified,
text: the man catches the smoking bomb.
speaker_heading: FRIAR
dialog: Give my regards to the devil.
text: The KEG ERUPTS, blowing the jailer through a wall.

scene_heading: EXT. CASTLE FORECOURT - DAY
text: A crossbow bolt strikes Hal between his shoulder blades.
text: He falls. The Sheriff's soldiers are regaining the
text: advantage. The peasants are giving up, dropping their
dialog: weapons.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: No! Fight on. Fight!
text: He sees a familiar pair of holy sandals marching towards
text: him. Tuck leading a barefoot army. Dozens of ragged
text: prisoners, armed with chains and torture implements.
speaker_heading: FRIAR
dialog: Sinners, beware! God's avengers
text: are at hand.
text: Dying, Hal manages a weak smile.
speaker_heading: HAL

dialog: who does not hate him? Who has
dialog: not suffered at his hand?
dialog: (to the chef)
dialog: Turn that on the Sheriff and his
dialog: bullies.
text: A deadly pause. A woman cook dumps the giant wedding
text: cake right over the chef. Suddenly it's havoc. Flying
text: food and cutlery.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
text: A full-scale riot. The populace has turned. Into the
text: fray comes Fanny Little, leading a rabble of servants
text: and kitchen staff, fighting with pots, pans, brooms,

scene_heading: INT. CASTLE - CHAPEL - DAY
text: Nottingham slashes maniacally. Robin is cornered,
text: weakening.
speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: You should have stayed away,
dialog: Locksley. Fools like you never
dialog: learn.
text: A blow slices Robin's arm. His sword flies from his
text: grasp. Nottingham gloats. Two of his men scramble back
text: to their feet. Robin is beat... a war cry! Aslan,
text: followed by Tuck.
speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: Ali akbar!
speaker_heading: FRIAR
dialog: Amen!
speaker_heading: MORTIANNA
dialog: (seeing Aslan)
dialog: Agh... the painted one!
text: Nottingham glances over... a split-second opportunity!...
text: Robin lashes out. Kicks the Sheriff in the gut, chops
text: down his sword hand. His father's sword clatters to the
dialog: floor.
text: Whirling swords in each hand, Aslan attacks the other
text: men. Robin pile-drives Nottingham into the wall.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 127.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The Bishop makes his escape. Tuck blocks his path.
speaker_heading: FRIAR
dialog: So! You sold your soul to the

speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: No, I swear it, in God's name.
speaker_heading: FRIAR
dialog: Blasphemer! You accuse innocent
dialog: men of Druid worship while you
dialog: practice the black arts yourself.
text: The Bishop surreptitiously draws a dagger from his robes.
text: A taloned hand grips a spear... Mortianna creeps up on
dialog: Aslan.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: (glimpsing her)
dialog: Watch out!
text: Aslan spins... too late. Screeching, Mortianna drives
text: the spear into Aslan's side. He cries out and slides to
dialog: the floor.
text: Nottingham uses Robin's distraction to regain his sword.
text: Back on the defensive, Robin tries to evade the blows.
text: Mortianna drags Marian out onto a balcony. Robin cannot
text: pursue. In acute pain, Aslan struggles to his feet.
text: Grasping the spear where it enters his side, he pulls with
dialog: all his strength.
text: The Bishop, concealed dagger in hand, approaches Tuck.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: (innocently)
dialog: I am sure you would not strike a
dialog: man of the cloth.
speaker_heading: FRIAR
dialog: Think again!
text: Without an eyeblink's pause, Tuck punches the Bishop so
text: hard, he flies back THROUGH a stained-glass WINDOW.
scene_heading: EXT. CASTLE - BALCONY - DAY
text: Mortianna hauls Marian against the battlements. Peers

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 128.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: What you fear is not below.
text: He charges at her with the bloody spear. She screams
text: hideously as he thrusts it right through her chest.
text: Her madness is superhuman. With strength beyond all
text: reason, she crawls up the spear's shaft, forcing it
text: further through her body in her effort to get at him.
text: Clutching, screeching, hissing.
text: Her talons groping at his face, Aslan strains to the
text: last ounce of his will and heaves her over the battle-
text: ments. With an ear-splitting shriek, she plummets to
dialog: the ground.
scene_heading: INT. CASTLE CHAPEL - DAY
text: Sword raised, Nottingham has Robin backed against the
dialog: altar.
speaker_heading: NOTTINGHAM
dialog: What can your puny God do for
dialog: you now?
text: The blade comes whirring down... clang! It's blocked.
text: Robin has the altar's crucifix in his hand.
text: He swings it again, slamming Nottingham across the
text: temple. The Sheriff hits the floor. Robin grabs his
text: father's sword. Raises it two-fisted. Nottingham tries
text: to squirm away.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: This is for my father.
text: He drives the sword down, like a stake, right through
text: Nottingham's heart. The man shudders, and is still.
text: Robin stands over him. Drained. Tuck rushes outside.
text: Kneels at Aslan's side. Robin spots Marian swaying on
text: the edge of the steep parapet.
scene_heading: EXT. CASTLE BALCONY - DAY
text: Robin grabs Marian, pulling her back. Carefully lifts

scene_heading: EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
text: Robin emerges from the castle. Draped over his shoulder,
text: Marian is kicking and beating at him. He reaches the
text: fountain in the center of the square and tosses her into
dialog: the freezing water.
text: She leaps to her feet, yelling. Slips and tumbles back.
text: Water streams from her bridal gown. A crowd gathers,
text: enjoying the show.
speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: Robin? Oh God, is that you?
text: She stumbles out of the fountain... and storms at him,
text: pounding her fists on his chest.
speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: How dare you?!
text: Robin grins at the crowd.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I think she's feeling better.
text: Marian looks about her... the chaotic aftermath of

text: Little John arrives, his huge arms enfolding Wulf and
dialog: Fanny.
speaker_heading: LITTLE JOHN
dialog: We done it, mate. We clobbered
dialog: the buggers.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Are you 'urt?
speaker_heading: ROBIN

speaker_heading: FRIAR

speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: Please! It hurts when I laugh.
