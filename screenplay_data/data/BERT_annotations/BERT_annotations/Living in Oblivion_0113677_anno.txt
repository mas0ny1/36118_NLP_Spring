scene_heading: "LIVING IN OBLIVION"
dialog: Screenplay by
dialog: Tom DiCillo
scene_heading: SHOOTING DRAFT
dialog: 1995
dialog: 
text: A battered 35mm movie camera stands alone on a wooden tripod
text: surrounded by blackness. Opening credits begin. An almost
text: imperceptible DOLLY in toward the movie camera. The dolly
text: forward continues throughout the credits ending in an EXTREME
text: CU of the camera's lens, filling the frame like a giant,
text: glass full moon. Fade to BLACK.
text: Suddenly a door opens directly in front of the camera, wiping
text: the lens and revealing the following scene in Black and White.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. NYC. NIGHT
text: A quiet, deserted industrial street. It is over an hour before
text: dawn and the street is still cloaked in the heavy stillness
dialog: of night.
text: In the weak light filtering out of their battered van, BERT
text: and CYBIL -- the Craft Service Managers, finish setting out
text: breakfast supplies on a 6' table. They work in almost complete
text: silence, both nearly paralyzed with sleep. A cheap walkie-
text: talkie, lying beside a paper plate of soggy Oreos, sputters
text: and buzzes occasionally. Other items on the table include a
text: mangled banana, seven grapes, and a box of chocolate covered
text: donuts.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: What time is it?
speaker_heading: CYBIL
dialog: Four. Why?
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: This milk is bad.
speaker_heading: CYBIL
dialog: (sniffs)
dialog: When did you buy it?
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Tuesday? I don't know. What's today?
speaker_heading: CYBIL
dialog: Monday.
dialog: (pause)
text: There's a deli on Broadway.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Nothing closer?
speaker_heading: CYBIL
dialog: Nothing that's open.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: (sniffs the milk)
dialog: Is it that bad?
speaker_heading: CYBIL
dialog: I don't know. You're the one who
dialog: said it was bad.
text: At that moment a large truck grinds around the corner and
text: shudders to a stop in front of the building. Bert replaces
text: the carton of milk neatly beside the orange juice.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. NYC. NIGHT. B/W
text: Amid low, one-word greetings, the CREW tumbles out of the
text: trucks and stands in a groggy cluster around the Craft Service
text: table. WOLF -- the Cameraman, assumes a place of prominence.
text: He wears a black leather coat, a black beret, and black
text: leather half-fingered gloves.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: This is the worst fucking coffee
dialog: I've had in my life.
speaker_heading: CYBIL
dialog: Then don't drink it.
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: What're we doing today?
speaker_heading: WOLF
text: (pulls out a wrinkled
dialog: callsheet)
dialog: "Interior. Living Room. Ellen talks
dialog: to Mom."
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: Any nudity?
speaker_heading: CYBIL
dialog: Yeah, you have to take your fucking
text: pants off.
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: I'll do it. I like Ellen.
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: Yeah, she's a babe. She was the nurse
dialog: in that Richard Gere movie.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: I worked on that.
speaker_heading: AC
text: The shower scene.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Start with the 5K in the window. Run
text: feeders for three blonds into the
dialog: living room.
speaker_heading: GAFFER
text: Two people. Sitting? Standing?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Who fuckin' knows?
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: (walks off)
dialog: "Ellen talks to Mom."
scene_heading: INT. CAR. NIGHT. B/W
text: NICOLE sits quietly in the back seat of a beat-up station
text: wagon. She glances out at the empty city moving past her
text: window and lets out a deep sigh.
text: JEFF, the young intern assigned as her driver, glances into
text: the rearview mirror.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Tired?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: No, I've been up since four. I've
dialog: got a big scene today and I'm kind
text: of nervous.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: "Ellen talks to Mom."
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Have you read the script?
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: No. It's on the callsheet.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Oh. Well, it's pretty emotional. I
dialog: tell my mother I never felt she really
dialog: loved me.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You're going to yell at each other?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I don't know. I'm just going to go
dialog: with how I feel. Which is the scary
dialog: part. I'm very close to this
dialog: character.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Problems with your own mom?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Yes. But she died before I, well
dialog: before we could reconcile...
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You were great in that Richard Gere
dialog: movie.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Thanks.
scene_heading: EXT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL. NIGHT. B/W
text: CU sidewalk. A pair of women's orthopedic shoes enter the
text: frame and begin pacing.
text: Camera pans up to reveal CORA, a small woman in her early
text: 60s, pacing beneath the awning of her residential hotel. She
text: appears to be rehearsing dialogue with herself.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Ellen, I have no memory of this
dialog: whatsoever. Ellen... Ellen I have NO
dialog: memory of this whatsoever.
text: Jeff pulls the car up to the curb and Cora gets into the
text: back seat.
scene_heading: INT. CAR. NIGHT. B/W
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Good morning, "Mom."
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: (gruff)
dialog: Morning.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Sleep well?
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Not a wink.
text: Cora immediately lights a cigarette. Nicole instinctively
text: wrinkles her nose and turns away. Cora notices this and makes
text: an exaggerated effort to keep the smoke away from Nicole by
text: blowing it hard out the side of her mouth. Jeff glances back
text: at the two women in the rearview mirror. No one speaks.
scene_heading: INT. SET. DAWN. B/W
text: NICK -- the Director, WOLF -- the Cameraman and WANDA -- the
text: AD, stand in a loose triangle on the darkened set. All are
text: holding coffee cups. The Gaffer can be seen in the background
text: fumbling with a light.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Look, I'm not blaming anybody, Wanda.
dialog: I'm just saying we left last night
dialog: and I knew we didn't get that scene.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: I'm sorry, I thought it was a great
dialog: scene, Nick.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: It was OK; and it's going to be
dialog: alright. But I'm not settling for OK
dialog: today. This is a big scene and I'm
dialog: not leaving till we get it.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Whatever it takes, Nick. We're here
dialog: for you.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Alright, here's what I'm thinking.
dialog: Wolf, I want to do the whole scene
dialog: in one shot.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: It's been done.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I know that but I'd like to try it
dialog: anyway.
speaker_heading: WOLF
text: Handheld.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No, dolly. We go from Close-up to
text: Wide-shot and back to Close-up in
dialog: the same shot.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: I'll use the 35, minimize distortion;
dialog: I'll light it all from the ceiling.
dialog: It could be kind of great.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Sounds incredible. How long, Wolf?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: I'll need to see a couple run-
dialog: throughs.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Not too many. It's a tough scene for
dialog: the actors. I want them to feel
text: relaxed, fresh...
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: We've got all day, Nick. Whatever it
dialog: takes. What do you think, Wolf -- an
dialog: hour, 45?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: I don't know how you drink that shit
dialog: black, Nick. I got to dump in the
dialog: milk. It's the only way I can cut
dialog: the taste.
text: Suddenly the Gaffer turns on the 5K, flooding the room with
text: harsh, blinding light.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Jesus!
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: What the fuck?!
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Flame on, asshole!!
text: The screen goes completely WHITE.
scene_heading: INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W
text: Screen is still white. Gradually it shifts back to proper
text: exposure revealing NICOLE in Medium CU. Her eyes are riveting;
text: it is obvious she is emotionally primed for the scene. A
text: light meter is thrust in front of her face. She barely
text: registers it.
text: WS, the entire Living Room set. Nicole sits on a sofa facing
text: Cora seated opposite in an overstuffed chair. Two flats have
text: been joined at right angles to create the Living Room corner.
text: A table lamp and assorted framed photographs complete the
text: rather scrawny looking set.
text: Most of the movie crew is seen, including Wolf looking through
text: the camera.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: OK, picture's up. Quiet. Stop the
dialog: work. Lock it up. Going for picture.
text: Nick approaches Nicole and Cora.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: OK, nice and easy. Cora you're doing
dialog: fine. Remember, really listen and
dialog: really answer.
dialog: (smiles at Nicole)
dialog: I've got nothing to say to you. Just
dialog: let it happen. It's all there.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Ready, Nick?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Look at this a second, Nick.
text: Nick moves behind the camera and looks through the eyepiece.
text: Another CU of Nicole fills the frame. The image is visually
text: and emotionally breathtaking.
speaker_heading: WOLF
text: I pushed in a foot. She's incredible.
text: It's coming right through the lens.
text: Nick grips Wolf's shoulder in gratitude.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: That's great, man. Beautiful.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Ready, Nick?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Let's go. Right away.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: And, roll sound.
speaker_heading: SOUND
dialog: Speed!
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: And, roll camera!
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: Rolling!
speaker_heading: CLAPPER
dialog: Scene six, take one.
dialog: (hits the sticks)
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Action.
scene_heading: INT. APT. THE SCENE: TAKE 1. COLOR
text: From the moment Nick calls "action" the film will cut directly
text: to the shot the set camera is filming. The shot is fluid,
text: graceful and in richly, beautiful COLOR. Nicole's performance
text: is very strong; flawed only slightly by her nervousness.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Dad hit me first and knocked me down.
dialog: It didn't hurt that much but I started
text: crying anyway, hoping he would leave
dialog: me alone. He went over and started
dialog: hitting Danny.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Ellen, I have no memory of this
dialog: whatsoever.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: You were just standing there looking
dialog: at me. Then you pulled me up and
dialog: said, "You're not hurt." Like I was
dialog: disgusting for faking, for doing the
dialog: only thing I could think of to keep
dialog: him from hitting me again.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: I was worried about Danny.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: You do remember.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: He was smaller than you.
text: Nicole turns to Cora with the heartbreaking gaze of an
text: abandoned child. Nick and the rest of the crew watch in awe.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: You were so worried about Danny --
text: Suddenly the BOOM dips all the way into the shot.
scene_heading: INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Cut! Boom in. Sorry, I had to cut.
dialog: Les, your boom was all the way in
dialog: the shot.
speaker_heading: BOOM
dialog: Well, where's the frame line?
text: All the crew move around, all talking at once.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: OK, can we get a frame line? Hold it
dialog: down. We're going again right away.
dialog: Nobody moves. Les, you got the frame
dialog: line?
speaker_heading: BOOM
dialog: I guess so.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: OK, here we go. Right away. Picture's
dialog: up.
text: Nick approaches Nicole and Cora.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Beautiful; both of you. Stay focused.
dialog: Stay with it. No big deal. Let's go,
dialog: Wanda. Right away.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Roll sound!
speaker_heading: SOUND

speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Ellen, I --
text: The image suddenly goes out of focus.
scene_heading: INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: I'm sorry, I have to cut. I was
dialog: completely off on the focus. It's my
dialog: fault, I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Thanks for the apology but you'll
dialog: never work in this town again.
dialog: (laughter)
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: I've got it now.
speaker_heading: WANDA

speaker_heading: SOUND

speaker_heading: CLAPPER

speaker_heading: NICK

scene_heading: INT. APT. THE SCENE: TAKE 3. COLOR
text: The scene begins once again. Remarkably, Nicole's enormous
text: commitment is just as full and sharp. Nick is in ecstasy.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Dad hit me first and knocked me down.
dialog: It didn't hurt that much but I started
text: crying anyway, hoping he would leave
dialog: me alone. He went over and started
dialog: hitting Danny.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Ellen, I have no memory of this
dialog: whatsoever.
text: Suddenly a car stops right outside, a heavy, bass-driven rap
text: song blasting out of its trunk-mounted speakers.
scene_heading: INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W
speaker_heading: SOUND
dialog: Street noise!
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: That's a cut!
dialog: (into her walkie)
dialog: What the fuck's going on down there!?
dialog: You call that a lock-up!? Get that
dialog: car out of there!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Jesus Christ. Why doesn't the guy
dialog: just get a flatbed trailer with about
text: 600 speakers on it and tow it behind
text: his car.
text: Everyone nods in annoyed agreement; everyone except the Boom
text: man who appears to be following the music with the mike,
text: bopping to it through the headphones. Slowly, interminably,
text: the music fades off into the distance.
speaker_heading: SOUND
dialog: And... it's clear.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: (into her walkie)
dialog: Do I have a lock-up?
speaker_heading: WALKIE (V.O.)
dialog: kkkkkssst... sttttss yes.
speaker_heading: WANDA

scene_heading: INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Boom's in.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Jesus Christ.
speaker_heading: BOOM
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: WOLF
text: The whole left side of frame, Les.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Alright, can we please get a
dialog: motherfucking frame line please?!
speaker_heading: BOOM
text: The frame keeps changing.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: That's the idea, Les.
speaker_heading: SOUND
dialog: May I make a suggestion? Is it
dialog: possible to maybe break the shot
dialog: down? Maybe two shots instead? Might
dialog: make it easier for Les.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SOUND
dialog: Then I need ten minutes to switch to
text: radio mikes.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Your call, Nick.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: There won't be any other sound
dialog: problems?
speaker_heading: SOUND
dialog: No more boom problems.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Switch to radios.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: That's a ten-minute break. Release
dialog: the lock-up. Stand by.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: (to the AC)
dialog: Get me a coffee. Half milk.
scene_heading: INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W
text: Nick looks for Nicole but sees only Cora standing by the
text: couch. Les has both arms up the back of her dress, running
text: the wire to her radio mike. She's wearing stockings rolled
text: down to just above her knees.
text: Nick turns and spots Nicole by herself in a dark corner of
text: the set and walks over to her.
scene_heading: INT. SET APT. A CORNER. DAY. B/W
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I'm sorry about all this, Nicole.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: It's not your fault, Nick. Is there
dialog: a way to use some of the earlier
dialog: takes?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Not unless I change the shot; do a
dialog: cutaway of Cora or something and
dialog: intercut the takes. I don't want to
dialog: do that. It's a really nice shot and
dialog: what you're doing is incredible.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Thanks, Nick.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: The radio mikes are going to make
dialog: everything easier. So, look. Take a
dialog: moment. Let all this shit go. We
dialog: don't roll till you're ready.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: OK.
text: Nick moves back to the set, leaving Nicole in the shadows.
text: Camera stays on her as she begins emotionally preparing
text: herself once again.
speaker_heading: SCRIPT (V.O.)
dialog: How was she in that Richard Gere
dialog: movie?
speaker_heading: CYBIL (V.O.)
dialog: So-so.
text: Camera slips halfway through an open bedroom door, holding
text: Nicole on one side of the frame while revealing PAM the Script
text: Supervisor and CYBIL sitting on the floor smoking. Though
text: separated by the wall, Nicole hears everything the two women
dialog: say.
speaker_heading: SCRIPT
dialog: Her career really took off, didn't
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: CYBIL
dialog: I saw her in a Michael Bolton video.
speaker_heading: SCRIPT
dialog: She is nice; but I could do a better
dialog: job.
text: Camera slips into a CU of Nicole. She closes her eyes as the
text: two women continue talking about her. Screen goes BLACK.
scene_heading: INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W
text: A BLACK scrim, held by the Gaffer, passes in front of the
text: camera, revealing the set with Nicole and Cora settling in
dialog: for a take.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Where's that flag going?
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: It's a scrim.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Wolf!
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Two seconds, Wanda.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: No. No more tweaking. Picture's up.

speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Ellen, I have no memory --
text: Suddenly there is a tremendous EXPLOSION sending bits of
text: glass flying through the frame. Cora jumps, clutching her
text: chest.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Oh, God!
scene_heading: INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W
text: CU the light the Gaffer had been holding the scrim before.
text: It is smoking and shattered.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Jesus fucking Christ!
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: (to the Gaffer)
dialog: Kill it. Kill it. Pull the plug.
dialog: Right there by your foot.
speaker_heading: WANDA

speaker_heading: WANDA

scene_heading: INT. APT. HALLWAY. DAY. B/W
text: Nick, Cora, and Nicole stand in a corner of the landing.
text: Nick is making obvious attempts to lighten the mood.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Well, let's see. What do you think
dialog: is going to happen next, Cora?
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: I'm going to have a heart attack!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No, you're not. You're going in there
dialog: in two minutes and we are really
dialog: going to nail this scene. I know it.
dialog: I have no doubt about it. Nicole...
text: Nick turns to Nicole and stops in midsentence. He looks at
text: her for a long moment. Nicole returns his gaze then suddenly
text: looks away.
speaker_heading: WANDA (V.O.)
dialog: Nick! Nick!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: One second!
text: Nick hesitates a moment then rushes back to the set.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: I'll tell you this much right now; I

scene_heading: INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W
text: Nick joins Wanda and Wolf on the set couch and chair.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What's up?
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Wolf and I were talking... Ellen's
dialog: losing it a little bit. You got three
dialog: quarters of the scene really, really
dialog: incredible in the first take. Do a
dialog: quick cut-away and all you need is a
text: pickup of the last part of the scene.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Wolf?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: You know how I feel; I love this
dialog: shot. Hell, I designed it.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Then let's just stick with the game
dialog: plan, OK? It's a simple shot. We're
dialog: going to get it this time, I feel
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: WANDA

dialog: doing great. I'm the one who's fucking
dialog: it up. If I get through this I swear
dialog: I'm never acting again.
text: She means it. Cora glances up at her, seeing for the first
text: time how pain and defeat have drawn the life from Nicole's
text: face. On an impulse Cora reaches out and gently lifts a strand
text: of Nicole's hair from her eyes.
text: A sudden amazed alarm fills Nicole. The living room grows
text: strangely quiet.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (faintly, from a
dialog: distance)
text: And, action on the run-through.
text: CU Nicole. She looks quickly toward Nick in confusion.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM. DAY. COLOR
text: DISSOLVE to a nurse moving quickly past the camera and out
text: the open door of the hospital room.
text: CU Nicole, seated on the edge of the hospital bed. Still
text: confused, she looks down at the old woman lying in the bed.
text: The woman's face is pale and drawn. As Nicole leans closer
text: her mother reaches out and gently brushes a strand of hair
text: away from her face. The gesture is one of love, acceptance,
text: and farewell. It is identical to the one we have just seen
text: Cora make to her.
speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)
text: And action on the run-through.
scene_heading: INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W
text: WS, the Living Room Set. Nick, Wanda, the rest of the crew
text: standing quietly. Nicole glances over at Cora and instantly
text: something unspoken and unexplained passes between them. The
text: run-through begins.
text: From the moment Nicole opens her mouth it is obvious there
dialog: has been a remarkable change in her. Every word now has the
text: stunning clarity of truth. Cora is completely engulfed in
dialog: the moment.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Dad hit me first and knocked me down.
dialog: It didn't hurt that much but I started
text: crying anyway, hoping he would leave
dialog: me alone. He went over and started
dialog: hitting Danny.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Ellen, I have no memory of this
dialog: whatsoever.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: You were just standing there looking
dialog: at me.
text: As Nicole continues, one by one the crew turn and watch this
text: exquisite moment happening before them. Nick's face is lit
text: with rapture.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Roll camera... roll camera.
text: He glances over and to his horror sees that no one is behind
text: the camera. He whispers frantically to the AC.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Where's Wolf?
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: (whispers)
text: In the bathroom... he doesn't feel
dialog: good.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Get him! Get him!
text: Nick turns back to the scene, watching its beauty now in
dialog: agony.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Then you pulled me up and said,
dialog: "You're not hurt." Like I was
dialog: disgusting for faking, for doing the
dialog: only thing I could think of to keep
dialog: him from hitting me again.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: I was worried about Danny.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: You do remember.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: He was smaller than you.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: You were so worried about Danny.
dialog: What about me, Mom? Why weren't you
dialog: worried about me?
text: There is a heavy, stunned silence as the scene ends. Nicole
text: and Cora are in each other's arms. Pam and Cybil share a
text: piece of tissue. CUT TO: an extreme CU of Nick.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Where the fuck is Wolf?!!!
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM. DAY. B/W
text: In the cramped confines of the dingy basement bathroom, Wolf
text: pukes violently into the toilet. His face is pale and slick
text: with perspiration. His eyes look upward toward the sound of
text: Nick yelling.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: One second!
text: Wolf tries to continue but another spasm of nausea wrenches
text: him back toward the toilet bowl.
scene_heading: INT. SET APT. THE COUCH. DAY. B/W
text: The set is quiet, subdued. Nick sits on the couch with Nicole
text: and Cora. Wolf sits groggily behind the camera wiping the
text: sweat from his face. Wanda addresses the crew.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: OK, listen up. Nobody drinks the
dialog: milk downstairs. OK? It appears to
dialog: be bad.
text: Nick speaks uneasily to Nicole and Cora. He is a wreck and
text: his insistent smile of encouragement looks absolutely
dialog: demented.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I've had to, well I've changed the
dialog: shot; we're just a little pressed
dialog: for time. It'll just be a CU of Ellen
text: for the last part of the scene,
dialog: starting with Cora's "I was worried
dialog: about Danny." OK? I'll find a way to
dialog: cut this into the fourth take. We
dialog: almost had it. That was unbelievable,
dialog: both of you. But let's not think
dialog: about it. That moment is gone, and...
dialog: we'll, we'll get another one. I have
dialog: no doubt about it. OK? Here we go.
text: Nick walks over and stands beside the camera.
scene_heading: INT. SET APT. BY THE CAMERA. DAY. B/W
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: I'm ready, Nick.
text: Nick is so angry he can't even look at Wolf.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Call it, Wanda.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: And, roll sound.
speaker_heading: SOUND
dialog: Speed!
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: And, roll camera!
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: Rolling!
speaker_heading: CLAPPER
dialog: Scene six, Pickup, take one.
dialog: (hits the sticks)
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Action.
scene_heading: INT. SET APT. THE SCENE: PICKUP 1. COLOR
text: The scene begins at the pickup point. Miraculously, both
text: Cora and Nicole are just as concentrated and engaged as they
text: were in the run-through.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: I was worried about Danny.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: You do remember.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: He was smaller than you.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: You were so worried about Danny.
dialog: What about me, Mom? Why weren't --
text: In the middle of this final, delicate moment an insistent
text: electronic beeping is heard.
scene_heading: INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: CUT!!!!
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: What the fuck is that?! Sound?
speaker_heading: SOUND
dialog: (frantically checking
dialog: his equipment)
dialog: It's not me.
speaker_heading: BOOM
dialog: It's the camera.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: The fuck it is. It's off; it's not
text: even running.
text: The beep continues, growing louder.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: (into her walkie)
dialog: What's going on down there?! Do I
dialog: have a lock-up?! Nothing? You don't
text: hear a beeping sound?
dialog: (to Nick)
text: The street's quiet.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Then what the fuck is it!!?
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: It's somebody's watch!
text: Everybody holds their watches up to their ears.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Not mine.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Not mine.
speaker_heading: SOUND
dialog: Not mine.
speaker_heading: BOOM
dialog: Not mine.
dialog: And so on, until all watches have been checked with negative
text: results. The beeping continues, growing louder and louder.
text: Suddenly Nick loses it. He starts running around the set,
text: ripping things apart, knocking over tables, lamps, chairs.
text: He shoves Cora off the couch and whips off the cushions,
text: heaving them against the wall with a startling violence.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Where is it!! You motherfucker! You
dialog: cock-sucking motherfucking bastard!
dialog: Where the fuck are you!? Where!!
dialog: Where!!
text: Everyone watches Nick demolish the set in stunned, open-
text: mouthed amazement. Nick turns to the crew in rage.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Can someone help me please?! Do I
dialog: have to do everything myself here?!
text: Nick loses it completely.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Hey, Cora. Why don't you go learn
dialog: your lines! Hey Scriptgirl, are you
dialog: finally going to pay attention here?!
dialog: Hey, focus puller, you want to make
dialog: a movie or get stoned?! Huh, I got
dialog: some great fuckin' Thai Stick here!
dialog: Hey Wolf, you pretentious, beret-
dialog: wearing motherfucker! I saw your
dialog: reel, man; it sucked! Who the hell
dialog: would hire you anyway! Hey Wanda,
dialog: next time can you wear a shirt that's
dialog: a little more distracting to my
dialog: actors!
dialog: (to the Gaffer)
dialog: Hey Bob! Hi Bob! Can you please make
dialog: a little more noise on the dolly you
dialog: creaky motherfucker!
dialog: (to Cybil)
dialog: What is your name!? What do you
dialog: fucking do around here?!
dialog: (to the Soundman)
dialog: Hey Speedo, what's the matter? Can't
dialog: even find a teeny fucking beep?!
text: CU of Nicole. She turns away, unable to watch anymore. The
text: beeping continues.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: See what I have to put up with,
dialog: Nicole!? Maybe next time you'll do
dialog: some of that magic on camera!? But
dialog: no, no -- wait till Wolf is puking
dialog: his guts out, "Oh now I'll be good!!"
text: WS, the entire room. Nick's last word echoes throughout the
text: silent set. Suddenly he stops in the center of the demolished
text: set and lets out a long, wrenching scream.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT. COLOR
text: QUICK CUT TO extreme CU Nick's face, just as his eyes open.
text: The film is in COLOR now. The room is in heavy darkness except
text: for the light on Nick's face. Nick reaches over and shuts
text: off his clock radio. The digital dial shows 4:00 A.M. The
text: beeping finally stops.
text: Nick turns on a light and sits up in bed, drenched in sweat
text: and still breathing heavily.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: God...
dialog: (this is not a sigh
dialog: of relief)
text: The camera DOLLIES swiftly back away from Nick. He stares at
text: it in stunned amazement. Just then a DOOR closes right into
text: the lens turning the frame into complete BLACKNESS.
text: Out of the BLACKNESS a door opens away from the camera
text: revealing WANDA looking into her closet (the camera is inside
text: the closet). From this point on, the rest of the film is in
dialog: COLOR except where specifically indicated to be Black and
dialog: White.
scene_heading: INT. WANDA'S APT. DAWN
text: She is wearing only a bra, black stretch pants, and cowboy
text: boots. She rummages quickly through some blouses, selects
text: the same garish one she wore in Part One, then walks away
text: revealing WOLF sitting on the edge of the rumpled bed. He is
text: dressed exactly the same as when we last saw him, complete
text: with beret. He struggles groggily into his socks and boots.
text: The entire apartment is in disarray. A bedside clock reads
text: 4:13 A.M.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Well, when did he ask you?
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Yesterday, when I was helping him
dialog: check into his hotel.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: What, the guy can't even check into
dialog: a hotel by himself?
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Listen, Wolf, having Chad Palomino
dialog: in this movie will benefit us all.
dialog: If being there when he checks into
dialog: his hotel makes him feel better,
dialog: then I'm happy to do it.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Well, how did it come up?
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: He asked me if I liked jazz, I said
dialog: yes, and he suggested we meet tonight
text: at a jazz club.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: I like jazz.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: He did not invite you.
dialog: (applies perfume)
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Why are you wearing perfume to work?
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Because I feel like it.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: You didn't wear it yesterday.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Oh, stop it. You're acting like a
dialog: child.
text: Wanda playfully swipes at Wolf's face with a negligee she is
text: returning to the closet. It misses him completely.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: My eye!
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Oh, God. Sweetheart, are you alright?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Do I look alright?!
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Let me see. Christ, we're going to
dialog: be late.
text: Wanda sits and perfunctorily examines Wolf's eye.
scene_heading: INT. CAR. DAWN
text: The car is parked outside a rather seedy hotel. JEFF, the
text: Intern and NICK, the Director, sit quietly in the motionless
dialog: car.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Should we call up to the room again?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: He said he'd be right down.
text: Nick lets out a huge yawn.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Tired?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I'm exhausted. I dreamt I was on the
dialog: set all night. I was just trying to
dialog: do one shot and everything kept going
dialog: wrong.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: That's an anxiety dream. Are you
dialog: anxious about something?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I don't know. Sometimes I wonder
dialog: what the hell I'm doing in this
dialog: business. It's all just one compromise
dialog: and disappointment after another. I
dialog: don't know if I have the personality
dialog: for it.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Sounds kind of like an identity
dialog: crisis.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Maybe you're right. Who am I? What
dialog: am I really capable of? Maybe I should
dialog: just get a job teaching at a women's
text: college somewhere.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: How'd you get into cinematography?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I'm not a cinematographer.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You're not?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No. I'm directing this movie.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: (pause)
dialog: How'd you get into directing?
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAWN
text: In the dim light of the hotel room, CHAD PALOMINO dresses
text: quickly. He is young, handsome, with long blond hair. A WOMAN
text: sits nude on the bed, her back to the camera. The faint sound
text: of a shower comes from the adjacent bathroom.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
text: They're waiting downstairs.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Go ahead, I'll take a taxi.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Oh, OK. Listen, I've got to tell
dialog: you, I had a lot of fun last night,
dialog: really, but for me, where I'm at
dialog: right now in my life, a relationship
dialog: is...
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Chad; hold it. This was a one-time
dialog: deal. You know it, I know it. There
dialog: is no need for melodrama.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: I just thought you might...
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Look, all I ask is that you don't
dialog: mention this to anyone.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Hey, that's not my style.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: So, I'll see you on the set.
text: Palomino slips out the door. The woman falls back onto the
text: bed, turning her face toward the camera. We see it is NICOLE.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: God damn it.
text: She lies for a moment, listening to the sound of the shower.
text: The bedside clock reads 4:30 A.M.
scene_heading: INT. CAR. DAWN
text: The car pulls up outside a NYC apt building. Jeff, Nick, and
text: Palomino sit inside.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: I got two films coming up right after
dialog: yours, Nick. One I play a rapist
text: that Michelle Pfeiffer falls in love
dialog: with. The other I'm kind of a sexy
text: serial killer who shacks up with
dialog: Winona Ryder.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: That's great, man.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Yeah, but I'm not into that hostess
dialog: twinkie shit, Nick.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Hostess twinkie?
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: That Hollywood shit. It's all fluff,
dialog: man. These are the kind of movies I
dialog: want to do, right here.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I'm glad you feel that way, Chad.
dialog: And I just want to tell you, I'm
dialog: really happy we can work together.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Hey, me too! You're a great director,
dialog: man. Your films are wacked! And I'm
dialog: gonna be watching you, buddy. Like a
dialog: hawk. I want to learn from you, Nick.
dialog: I'm gonna pick your brain.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Good. Then you can pick my nose.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: (big laugh)
dialog: See what I mean? You're wacked. Hey,
dialog: what are we sitting here for?
speaker_heading: NICK
text: We're waiting for Nicole.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Nicole? She's takin' a tax --
dialog: (he stops)
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
text: Probably taking a shower or something.
dialog: Hey, how was her shower scene in
dialog: that Richard Gere movie?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Really great.
text: The three men sit in silence. WS, showing the car parked
text: outside Nicole's apt, the men inside waiting.
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. MORNING
text: A small, elegant bedroom set has been constructed in the
text: middle of the huge empty space. One wall has a fake window.
text: The GAFFER lies on the bed staring absently at the AC sitting
text: motionless beside the camera a few feet away. Neither speaks
text: for a long moment.
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: I think we got nudity today.
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: (reads from his
dialog: callsheet)
text: It just says "Scene Six: Ellen and
dialog: Damian kiss."
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: Could be a kiss with nudity.
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: I like Ellen. She's my type.
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: Why is that?
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: She's pretty. Smart. Kind of kooky.
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: Maybe I'll give her a part. That's
dialog: right; I'm makin' my own movie pretty
dialog: soon.
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: Oh yeah?
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: Yup. Feature. I brought my script.
text: The Gaffer tugs a thin, tattered SCRIPT, folded lengthwise,
text: out of his back pocket.
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: Palomino's perfect for the lead. I'm
dialog: going to give it to him right during
text: lunch. Maybe right after.
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: Alright.
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: Got to be aggressive. You want to
dialog: shoot it?
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: You ever shot anything?
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: That's alright; got to start
text: somewhere.
text: Suddenly the Gaffer reaches out and warmly shakes the AC's
dialog: hand.
scene_heading: INT. MAKEUP CORNER. DAY
text: Nicole sits before the makeup mirror. LORDE, the male Makeup
text: artist picks up a tube of Preparation H and begins applying
text: it under Nicole's eyes just as Nick walks up.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Jesus, what are you doing?
speaker_heading: LORDE
dialog: Shrinking tissue. That's what this
dialog: stuff is for. Let that sit for two
dialog: minutes, pumpkin; I'll be right back.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: How'd you get here?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
text: Took a taxi.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Oh. We've been waiting in front of
dialog: your apartment for half an hour.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: God, I'm sorry, Nick. Something came
dialog: up. I forgot to call. I'm sorry, I
dialog: feel like such an asshole.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You're just saying that because you
dialog: have Preparation H on your face.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I never should have gone out last
dialog: night. I hate jazz. God, I look
dialog: terrible.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No you don't.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Don't bullshit me, Nick.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I'm not. You really look beautiful.
text: Something in Nick's voice makes Nicole glance up at him. He
text: looks away quickly. The moment is awkward, as if they both
text: realize he has inadvertently revealed something. Just then
text: Palomino approaches.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Hey! How'd you get here, Nicole?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I took a cab.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Oh, cause we were wondering how you
dialog: got here.
text: Nick looks at both of them in a moment of silence.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Alright, good; everybody's here.
dialog: We'll do a run-through as soon as
dialog: you guys are ready.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: You got it, Chief.
text: Lorde reenters as Nick leaves. Palomino sits in the chair
text: beside Nicole and Lorde immediately begins his makeup. No
dialog: one speaks.
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. DAY
text: The crew is assembled behind the camera. Wolf is now wearing
text: a black eyepatch over one eye. Nick is on the set, talking
text: with Nicole and Palomino. Palomino wears a tuxedo and Nicole
text: is in an elaborate low-cut gown.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Hold it down, hold it down, people.
dialog: Actors working.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Great shirt, Wanda.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: (big smile)
dialog: Why, thank you, Chad.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: OK, let's work out the rest of this
dialog: blocking. Wolf --
dialog: (notices Wolf's
dialog: eyepatch)
dialog: What happened to your eye?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: A little accident.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You going to be alright?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: It looks good on you, man.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Nicole is standing here, Chad, you're
text: there by the chair. Camera is close
text: on Ellen: her first line.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I've always admired you from afar.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Admired? That sounds rather
dialog: professional.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Good! "Professional," that's the
text: cue; Damian steps up to the bed.
text: Camera pulls back. The scene
dialog: continues.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Well, then: loved. How does that
dialog: sound?
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
text: It sounds like the champagne talking.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I've loved you from the moment we
dialog: met.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Why didn't you tell me?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: We were working together. I didn't
dialog: want anything to interfere.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: God. And all this time I thought...
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Then the kiss. How's that feel?
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Great.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Nicole?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Wolf, any thoughts?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: I've got a thought. What about Damian
dialog: having an eyepatch like Wolf's?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Let me think about that one, Chad.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: OK, you're the genius. Nick Reve,
dialog: Living in Oblivion, Scene Six, Take
dialog: One. Let's shoot it!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: One second, Chad. You ready for one,
dialog: Wolf?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Hell, I been ready.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Alright, Wolfman.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Good. Call it, Wanda.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Going for picture. Lock it up. And
text: roll sound.
speaker_heading: SOUND
dialog: Speed!
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Roll camera!
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: Rolling!
speaker_heading: CLAPPER
dialog: Scene six, take one!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: And, action.
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. TAKE ONE
text: Instantly the film cuts from color to B/W. Chad and Nicole
text: begin their Love Scene.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I've always admired you from afar.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Admired? That sounds rather
dialog: professional.
text: The camera starts to dolly, however Chad does not move. He
text: goes out of frame forcing Wolf to pan abruptly to Nicole.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Well, then: loved. How does that
dialog: sound?
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
text: It sounds like the champagne talking.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I've loved you from the moment we
dialog: met.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
text: (finally moves to his
dialog: mark)
dialog: Why didn't you tell me?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: We were working together. I didn't
dialog: want anything to interfere.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: God. And all this time I thought...
text: Palomino and Nicole embrace. Their kiss, like the entire
text: scene, is flat, lifeless, and awful.
scene_heading: INT. THE SET
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Cut. Very good.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Not for camera. Chad was completely
text: out of frame.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yeah, Chad; what happened, buddy?
dialog: Forget your cue?
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Oh no, man. I held back. It really
dialog: felt like something Damian would do;
text: holding back to the last moment.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Oh, I see. How's that for you, Wolf?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: I don't care when he moves. Just
dialog: give me a fucking cue.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: The Lone Wolf!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What line did he move on?
speaker_heading: SCRIPT
dialog: "Why didn't you tell me?"
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Alright, "me" is the new cue. Nicole,
dialog: how does that feel to you?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Fine, if that's what Chad wants to
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: "Me, me, me," that's the cue. Let's
dialog: shoot; I'm stoked!
speaker_heading: NICK
text: One second, Chad.
text: Nick approaches the bed and speaks quietly to Chad and Nicole.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Chad, how would you describe this
dialog: scene, in one word?
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Great. It's a great scene, man.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No, I mean it's a love scene. Right?
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Definitely.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: These two people really love each
dialog: other. And we want to see that,
text: especially in the kiss.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Hey, say no more, Chief.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Nicole?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I understand, Chief.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Good. Here we go. Call it, Wanda.
speaker_heading: WANDA

speaker_heading: AC

dialog: Scene six, take two!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: And, action.
scene_heading: INT. THE SCENE. TAKE TWO. DAY
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I've always admired you from afar.
text: Palomino moves immediately to the bed, changing his blocking
text: and causing the camera crew and Nicole considerable confusion.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Admired? That sounds rather
dialog: professional.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Well, then: loved. How does that
dialog: sound?
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
text: It sounds like the champagne talking.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I've loved you from the moment we
dialog: met.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Why didn't you tell me?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: We were working together. I didn't
dialog: want anything to interfere.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: God. And all this time I thought...
text: The scene once again is awful. Nick gives their listless
text: kiss a few moments then calls CUT.
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. DAY
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: And, cut. Very good. Wolf?
speaker_heading: WOLF
text: Chad missed his cue again; the whole
text: dolly is unusable.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yeah, Chad. What happened; I thought
dialog: you were going to hold back till
dialog: "me"?
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: The more I thought about it the more
dialog: it didn't seem right. And I'm
dialog: thinking, watch me here, instead of
dialog: coming around the bed, what if I
dialog: just slip here like this and do the
dialog: whole scene lying down?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I don't know, that seems a little...
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Hey, I'm just throwing out ideas
dialog: here. Trying to get the juices
dialog: flowing.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Nicole, how does that feel to you?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Well, I can turn to look at him. But
dialog: won't you be shooting the back of my
dialog: head?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Plus Chad is completely out of the
text: light down there.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Hey, Wolf; I'm not worried about my
dialog: face, man. It's about the acting;
dialog: that's all I care about.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: It's your call, Nick. His acting or
text: his face.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: For some reason I was hoping we could
dialog: get both.
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: I thought that's what we were trying
dialog: to do here.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: I'll have to set another light.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: We're ahead of schedule, Nick. I
dialog: think we can afford a few minutes to
text: set a light for Mr. Palomino.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Good, let's do it. Ellen, Damian;
dialog: let's talk for a second.
text: As Nick, Nicole, and Palomino step off the set Wanda speaks
text: to the crew in general.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: We'll pause to set this light and go
dialog: again right away. How long, Wolf?
text: Wolf doesn't answer, though he stands a mere foot away,
text: watching the Gaffer set up a light.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Wolf?
text: Wolf walks away from Wanda without a word. The entire crew
dialog: watches this.
scene_heading: INT. A CORNER. DAY
text: Nick, Palomino, and Nicole confer, all three smoking.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: OK, let's make sure we know what's
dialog: going on here. These two people have
dialog: loved each other for years, each of
dialog: them not knowing the other was in
dialog: love with them. And tonight, in this
text: little room it all comes out. It's
text: like a dam bursting. Does that make
dialog: sense? Nicole?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: It makes perfect sense. I just haven't
dialog: found it yet. I'll get it though.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What about you, Chad?
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: I'm there, man. I got the dam going,
dialog: the river, everything. You watch,
dialog: that little change in the blocking
dialog: is going to open the whole scene up
dialog: for me.
speaker_heading: WANDA (V.O.)
dialog: We're ready, Nick!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Good. Let's go.
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. DAY
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Going for picture. Lock it up. And
text: roll sound.
speaker_heading: SOUND
dialog: Speed!
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Roll camera!
speaker_heading: AC

speaker_heading: CLAPPER
dialog: Scene six, take three!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: And, action.
scene_heading: INT. THE SCENE. TAKE THREE. DAY
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I've always admired you from afar.
text: Palomino saunters over and sprawls on the bed, forcing Nicole
text: to turn her head completely away from the camera.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Admired? That sounds rather
dialog: professional.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Well, then: loved. How does that
dialog: sound?
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
text: It sounds like the champagne talking.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I've loved you from the moment we
dialog: met.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Why didn't you tell me?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: We were working together -- I'm sorry,
dialog: can we cut, Nick?
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. DAY
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Cut!
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: That's a cut!
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Dammit! That was a good one!
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I know, I'm sorry. But this feels
dialog: really awkward; turning all the way
dialog: around like this.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yeah, I think the lying on the bed
dialog: is not quite working, Chad. Let's
dialog: try one with the original blocking.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Which one was that? There's been so
dialog: many damn changes. Could somebody
dialog: help me out please?
speaker_heading: SCRIPT
text: The cue for the original blocking is
dialog: "professional."
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: (intimate)
dialog: Thank you. Thank you very much.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: OK, right away. Call it, Wanda.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Nick? Could I just have a moment? Is
dialog: that alright?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Of course, Nicole; are you kidding?
dialog: Hold the roll, Wanda.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Holding the roll!
text: Nicole remains seated on the bed, lowering her head and
text: closing her eyes as she attempts to generate some emotion
text: for the scene. Everyone watches her in complete silence.
scene_heading: INT. NEAR THE CAMERA. DAY
text: Palomino tiptoes over to the camera where Wanda and the
text: Scriptgirl are standing side by side. As he leans between
text: them, checking his lines on the Scriptgirl's script, he
text: inhales deeply then exhales with a barely audible sigh.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Someone over here smells very, very
dialog: nice.
text: Thinking he means her, Wanda's lips flutter in a brief,
text: involuntary smile. Meanwhile, the Scriptgirl turns away,
text: blushing furiously.
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. DAY
text: Palomino tiptoes again back to his spot. Nicole raises her
text: head and nods once to Nick. She seems to have aroused some
text: real emotion in herself.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (with quiet intensity)
dialog: Call it, Wanda.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: And roll sound.
speaker_heading: SOUND
dialog: Speed!
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Roll camera!
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: Rolling!
speaker_heading: CLAPPER
dialog: Scene six, take four!
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: (suddenly)
dialog: Nick, I just had a great idea!
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Hold the roll!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What is it, Chad?
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Just stop me if I'm out of line here,
dialog: but she says "admired from afar,"
dialog: right? Doesn't it make sense to see
dialog: Damian up close and her "afar?" You
text: start on a Close-up of Damian, watch
dialog: me here; as she declares her love,
dialog: the camera moves with me into this
dialog: primo two-shot that you and the
dialog: Wolfmeister have set up here.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What do you think, Wolf?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: I don't like it. This is Ellen's
dialog: scene.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I don't know; it sort of makes sense.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Hey, you did it, man. It's all there
text: in the writing.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: I'd have to relight.
text: Nick pauses, thinking hard.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: We're still ahead of schedule, Nick;
dialog: if that means anything to you.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Let's do it.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: (to the Gaffer)
dialog: Get me a tweenie right here, with
dialog: diffusion.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: OK, everyone stand by. We're pausing
text: briefly to set one little light,
dialog: then we're going again, right away.
dialog: Stand-in please for Mr. Palomino.
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: I'll do it.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Get the fucking light!
scene_heading: INT. CRAFT SERVICE TABLE. DAY
text: Several members of the crew loiter around the table. The
text: Scriptgirl approaches carrying a donut in one hand and a cup
text: of coffee in the other. Palomino notices her and moves quietly
text: to her side. Without a word he picks up the milk and pours
text: some in her coffee. Nicole stands nearby and watches the
dialog: following exchange.
speaker_heading: SCRIPT
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: My pleasure. Sugar?
speaker_heading: SCRIPT
dialog: Just a bit.
text: Palomino puts sugar in her coffee with extreme care.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: You like jazz?
speaker_heading: SCRIPT
dialog: Very much.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Maybe we could go hear some tonight.
text: Palomino smiles and moves away just as Wanda comes up for a
dialog: coffee refill.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: It's going well I think. Don't you
dialog: think?
speaker_heading: SCRIPT
dialog: Very well. What time do you think
dialog: we'll finish?
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Early I hope. I'm going to a jazz
dialog: club tonight.
speaker_heading: SCRIPT
dialog: Really? So am I. He's wonderful,
dialog: isn't he?
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Chad?
speaker_heading: SCRIPT
dialog: He's so natural, like... air.
text: Nicole approaches.
speaker_heading: SCRIPT
dialog: I wonder what his sign is. Do you
dialog: know, Nicole?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I don't know his sign, but I think
text: his moon is in Uranus.
text: Wanda chokes hard on her coffee as Nicole walks off with a
text: bitter smile.
speaker_heading: SCRIPT
dialog: You don't have to be nasty.
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. DAY
text: Palomino saunters onto the set as Wolf and his crew finish
text: relighting.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Yo, Wolfman. Is this my new mark?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Until you change it. Where's my
dialog: fucking eyepatch?!
text: Wolf walks off. The Gaffer slips the AC a shrewd wink then
text: walks over and stands next to Palomino, giving him a big,
text: friendly grin.
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: Hey, Chad.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Hey, whatya say.
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: I'm Bob. I'm lighting this show.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Chad Palomino; Actor.
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: (big smile)
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: (to the ac)
dialog: Hey, what's your name?
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: Maurice.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Maurice! Hey, Maurice Chevalier! Any
dialog: relation? Probably not. Hey, smoking
dialog: crew guys, really.
text: The Gaffer slips his own script out of his back pocket and
text: begins leafing through it.
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: Hey thanks, Chad. Actually I wrote a
dialog: script.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Oh, yeah?
text: Palomino takes the Gaffer's script and holds it up to his
text: eyes, shading them from a light he's looking at across the
text: room. He points to the light.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Hey, Bill. See that light over there?
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: Uh, yeah.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
text: Lower it about three feet.
text: Palomino hands the Gaffer back his script and walks off. The
text: Gaffer and AC stand in silence for a long awkward moment.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM. DAY
text: Nick intently scrutinizes himself in the mirror. Leaning
text: closer he makes a careful adjustment to the way his hair
text: falls over his ear, then steps back to examine himself.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Would you care to have a drink
dialog: tonight? Hey, Nicole, what do you
dialog: say you and I have a drink tonight?
text: Suddenly the door opens behind him and Nicole walks in.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Oh, Nick! I'm sorry!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: That's OK, no problem. I'm just
text: slapping a little water on my face.
text: The two stand in embarrassed silence for a moment. Nick looks
text: like he's gathering the nerve to ask her out.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: So, it's going pretty good, huh?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
text: Is it? Something feels off.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yeah, you seem a little tense.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Do I?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: But don't worry about it. Just take
dialog: your attention off yourself and put
dialog: it on Chad. Work off him a little
dialog: more.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: OK, I'll try that.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: And listen, I know he's no Olivier.
dialog: But he's got something, don't you
dialog: think? Kind of a natural presence.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Oh yes, he's very natural.
text: Nick hesitates, again gathering his nerves to pop the
dialog: question.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: So Nicole... anything else I can
dialog: help you with?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Actually there is. Could you maybe
dialog: ask him to brush his teeth?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Oh, sure.
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. DAY
text: Wanda crosses the set and assumes her position beside the
text: camera. Wolf sits behind it, barely a foot away.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: My eye is killing me.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Put your eyepatch on.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: I lost it.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Is that little light set yet?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: That little light was set ten minutes
dialog: ago.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: (into her walkie)
dialog: Get me the A Team in here right away.
text: Nick, Nicole, and Mr. Palomino.
dialog: (to Wolf)
dialog: Why didn't you tell me?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Hey, you're not worried about the
dialog: time, I'm not worried about the time.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Oh, I am very worried about the time!
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: I know you are.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: What is that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: What do you think it means?!
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: I don't know what it means!
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Oh yes you do, you know exactly what
dialog: it means.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: I have no idea what you're talking
dialog: about! Why are you --
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: You don't understand me, Wanda! You
dialog: have no idea --
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: I don't understand you?!! All I do
dialog: is take care of you!!!
text: Nick suddenly runs up just as Wolf and Wanda are on the verge
dialog: of blows.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Hey, hey, hey! What the hell's going
dialog: on here?! Jesus, Wanda. This is a
dialog: very intimate scene and a lot of
dialog: tension on the set doesn't help. OK?
dialog: Now, Wolf, let's just go through the
text: first part of the move. Damian, on
dialog: your new mark. Good. Close-up, Damian;
text: Ellen in the background.
text: Nick suddenly sees Palomino is wearing a black eyepatch.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Chad, what are you doing?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Hey, that's my fucking eyepatch.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Wolf, could I borrow it? Cause I'm
dialog: telling you, Nick; it really feels
dialog: right. I feel like this guy now,
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I don't know, Chad. I don't think it
dialog: works.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: You're wrong, man. I'm going to fight
dialog: you on this one.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Hey, it's my fucking eyepatch and I
dialog: don't want anyone wearing it. It's
dialog: insanitary.
text: Palomino removes the eyepatch and tosses it back to Wolf.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Fine. I'll get my own. Nick, send
dialog: someone out for an eyepatch. I'll
dialog: fucking pay for it myself.
text: Nick pulls Palomino aside and whispers to him confidentially.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Listen, Chad. I didn't want to say
text: this in front of Wolf but it makes
dialog: you look a little... gay.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yeah, a little bit.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Jesus.
text: Palomino sneaks a glance back at Wolf then whispers to Nick.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: You're right. Thanks, buddy. Good
dialog: call.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Are you ready, Nick?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: One second. You need a rehearsal,
dialog: Wolf?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Let's just fucking shoot it!!
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: El Lobo!
text: Palomino winks at Nick and walks back to his new mark, making
text: a barely audible howling sound behind his hand.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Call it, Wanda.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Going for picture. Lock it up. And
text: roll sound.
speaker_heading: SOUND
dialog: Speed!
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Roll camera!
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: Rolling!
speaker_heading: CLAPPER
dialog: Scene six, take four!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: And, action.
scene_heading: INT. THE SCENE. TAKE FOUR
text: The scene begins again. Palomino milks his Close-up for all
dialog: it's worth.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I've always admired you from afar.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Admired? That sounds rather
dialog: professional.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Well, then: loved. How does that
dialog: sound?
text: Right on his cue, Palomino walks to the bed. As the camera
text: moves into the 2-shot he begins stroking Nicole's hair with
dialog: extreme care and concentration.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
text: It sounds like the champagne talking.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I've loved you from the moment we
dialog: met.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Why didn't you tell me?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: We were working together. I didn't
dialog: want anything to interfere -- God!
text: Under the onslaught of escalating hair-stroking, Nicole
text: suddenly jerks her head away hard. Palomino jumps up and
text: begins pacing at the rear of the set.
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. DAY
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Cut!
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: That's a cut. Hold the work, going
text: again, right away.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I'm sorry, Nick. I don't know why I
dialog: did that. I'm sorry.
text: Palomino suddenly stops pacing and addresses Nick with a
text: curtness that is a little startling.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Nick, could I talk to you a second?
text: Palomino disappears behind the set, a jerk of his head
text: indicating his wish for Nick to follow him.
speaker_heading: WANDA
text: A momentary delay. Everyone stand
dialog: by. We're going again, right away.
speaker_heading: SOUND
dialog: Excuse me, Ellen? You were a tad low
dialog: on that take.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Oh, OK. I'll bring it up. Actually
dialog: could I listen to the take before?
text: The Sound man gives Nicole his headphones and rewinds the
text: tape recorder for her. The first several lines of the last
text: take are heard through the headphones.
scene_heading: INT. OFF THE SET. DAY
text: Nick follows Palomino behind the set, stopping just beside
text: the fake set window. Palomino whirls on Nick and whispers
dialog: fiercely.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: I'm out of here, man!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What's the matter?!
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: I like you, but I made a big mistake
dialog: taking this part. Have someone call
dialog: me a cab.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Wait a second, Chad. Just talk to
dialog: me. What's going on!?
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: I can't act with this woman. I know
dialog: she's a friend of yours but I got to
dialog: tell you: she cannot act worth a
dialog: shit! I'm giving her everything! The
dialog: whole thing I just did with the hair;
dialog: did you see that? I came up with
dialog: that on my own because I thought it
dialog: would help her. But no, she's giving
dialog: me nothing! I'm out of here.
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. DAY
text: Nicole listens to the last line of the previous take.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: God, and all this time I thought...
text: (the muted rustle of
dialog: the kiss)
text: The Sound man stops the recorder at the end of the take,
text: sets the machine in standby mode, and picks up his crossword
text: puzzle. Nicole is just about to take off the headphones when
text: she realizes she can hear Nick and Palomino talking quite
text: clearly. Glancing up, she sees the Boom man has left his
text: boom leaning against the wall, the mike pointing out the
text: open set window.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO (V.O.)
dialog: Why did you cast her? She sucked in
dialog: that Richard Gere movie!
speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)
dialog: You're right. She is not the best
dialog: actress in the world. I see that now
dialog: but you've got to help me, Chad. I'm
dialog: asking you to please help me here.
dialog: We've got to get through this somehow.
text: The camera begins a slow DOLLY in to Nicole's astonished
text: face. This will be intercut with a similar DOLLY in to the
text: microphone leaning against the wall, ending in an ECU of the
dialog: mike.
scene_heading: INT. OFF THE SET. DAY
text: Camera is close on Nick and Palomino.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: I'll tell you what this is about,
dialog: man. You know why she took a cab
dialog: this morning?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Something came up.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: No. She was in my hotel room and she
dialog: didn't want you to know it. OK? I'm
dialog: sorry it had to come out like this
dialog: but I told her this morning "thanks
dialog: a lot, it was a lot of fun last night
dialog: but let's get something straight --
dialog: it was just a one-time deal," and
dialog: she didn't want to hear that. She
dialog: wanted more, you see what I'm saying?
dialog: It's rejection.
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. DAY
text: The camera reveals Nicole now seated in her spot on the bed.
text: She rises as Nick and Palomino reappear and approach her
text: from behind the set.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Nicole, listen...
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Nick, it's my fault the scene isn't
dialog: working. I apologize. Chad, I
dialog: apologize to you too. I'm completely
dialog: unfocused here and I think you're
dialog: absolutely right; what we need to do
text: is loosen the scene up somehow.
text: Nick and Palomino stare at Nicole for a moment.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What would you like to do?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I was wondering if we could try
text: improvising the scene. More along
text: the lines of what Chad has been doing.
dialog: Maybe that would help me find
dialog: something.
text: Nick's smile of gratitude to Nicole looks almost drug-induced.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: That's a fantastic idea. What do you
dialog: think, Chad?
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Hey, that's the only way I can work.
dialog: Let's take it apart, let's cut loose.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Good! And we'll shoot it! Hell, why
dialog: not?!
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Roll that motherfucking camera,
dialog: Wolfie!
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Kiss my ass!
text: Although Wolf says this quite loud, Palomino doesn't hear
text: him because he suddenly yells:
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Yeah! Let's go!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Alright, now we're making a fucking
dialog: movie! Call it, Wanda!
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Going for picture. Lock it up. And
text: roll sound.
speaker_heading: SOUND
dialog: Speed!
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Roll camera!
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: Rolling!
speaker_heading: CLAPPER
dialog: Scene six, take five!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: And, action.
scene_heading: INT. THE SCENE. TAKE FIVE. THE IMPROV
text: Nicole stays seated, though Palomino moves around making a
dialog: great show of loosening up.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I've always admired you from afar.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Have you? That's, wow; that's
dialog: incredible. But that sounds kind of
dialog: professional doesn't it? Admired?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: You're right. How does despised sound?
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Great!
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: What's it mean?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: It's sort of like I think you're a
dialog: piece of shit.
text: Palomino is somewhat startled by this. He looks to Nick in
text: confusion. Nick silently encourages him to keep going.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: (another laugh)
dialog: That sounds like the champagne
text: talking.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: It's not. I really do think you are
dialog: a piece of shit.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: No, you don't. You love me.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: The fuck I do. I can't stand looking
dialog: at you!
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Then I guess I have nothing else to
dialog: say.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: No, I think you have a lot more to
dialog: say, Damian.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Well, I am surprised you feel this
dialog: way, Ellen. I always thought you
dialog: admired --
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: That's not what I meant. You should
dialog: tell everyone what you just told
text: Nick behind the set.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Hey, this isn't part of the scene.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Say it anyway: The reason this scene
dialog: isn't working is because you and I
dialog: slept together last night. Did
dialog: everyone hear that?! I fucked Chad
dialog: last night!
text: Nick and the rest of the crew stand in stunned amazement.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: See, Nick! I told you this was about
dialog: rejection!
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: You fucking scumbag! You think I
dialog: give a rat's ass about you?! I was
dialog: there to get laid and even that was
dialog: a joke!
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: You know, you are really starting to
dialog: piss me off!
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Oh, does that mean you're not going
dialog: to come wiggle on the bed anymore,
dialog: or stroke my hair real soft and
dialog: concerned, or kiss me like a soap
dialog: opera acting piece of shit!
text: Palomino snaps, and lunges for Nicole. She leaps to the other
text: side of the bed.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Come on! I'll kick your ass! Come
dialog: on!
text: Nick steps between Nicole and Palomino.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: OK, guys, I think we can stop there.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: You bet your ass we can stop! Wanda,
dialog: call me a cab!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Hold on, Chad. Let's just try to
dialog: calm down.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Fuck you. I'm out of here, man. This
dialog: movie is bullshit.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Now wait a second, Chad. There's no
dialog: reason for hostility.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Shut up, you fucking loser. The only
dialog: reason I took this part was because
dialog: someone said you knew Quentin
dialog: Tarantino! You're nowhere, man.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Hey, you want to go? Go! I'm sick of
dialog: your shit, you hostess twinkie
dialog: motherfucker!
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: What'd you call me?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You heard me.
speaker_heading: PALOMINO
dialog: Say it again.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You hostess twinkie motherfucker!
text: Palomino suddenly punches Nick in the stomach, leaving him
text: bent over and gasping for breath. Nicole instantly leaps on
text: Palomino's back and begins pounding her fist on the top of
text: his head. Palomino spins wildly trying to dislodge her as
text: Wanda rushes forward.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Alright, everyone just stop. Stop!
dialog: Stop this right now!
text: As she tries to separate Nicole and Palomino, Palomino shoves
text: her hard, knocking her down. Instantly Wolf leaps off the
text: camera and runs up to Palomino.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Alright, you've asked for it, Chad!
text: Palomino suddenly punches Wolf in the teeth, dropping him
text: like a stone.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: (shrieks)
dialog: Wolf!
text: Suddenly Nick staggers to his feet and rushes at Palomino.
text: His momentum knocks all three backwards onto the bed,
text: Palomino's head cracking Nicole in the teeth.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Oh, God!
text: Nicole rolls free as Nick and Palomino wrestle on the bed.
text: Nick gets Palomino in a vicious headlock and starts pounding
text: his head against the mattress.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You want to pick my brain?! This is
dialog: the way I direct hostess twinkie
dialog: scumbags like you!
text: As Nick continues to pound Palomino's head the Gaffer notices
text: Palomino's eyes are starting to bug out from the pressure of
text: Nick's forearm around his neck. He and the Boom man rush
text: forward and finally manage to pry Palomino free.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Get him out of here! Someone take
dialog: him back to his hotel!
text: As the Gaffer and Boom man drag off the almost unconscious
text: Palomino, the Scriptgirl takes one faltering step after him.
speaker_heading: SCRIPT
dialog: (sniffling)
dialog: Chad...
text: Suddenly, everything becomes quiet except for Nick's labored
text: breathing and the Scriptgirl's sniffles. Nick leans over and
text: touches Nicole's shoulder.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Are you alright?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Don't touch me.
scene_heading: EXT. DAY. THE STREET OUTSIDE THE SET
text: The Gaffer and AC help the still-groggy Palomino into the
text: back of the production van. JEFF, the driver, watches them
text: in sleepy curiosity.
text: With Palomino safely propped in a seat, the AC goes back to
text: the set. The Gaffer waits a moment then slips his script out
text: of his back pocket and slaps it into Palomino's motionless
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: GAFFER
text: It's called "Tsunami." A Japanese
dialog: tidal wave hits New York. You've an
text: ex-Navy S.E.A L. frogman, working
dialog: undercover. You save the city. You'd
dialog: be perfect for the lead. That's my
dialog: number; call me, or I'll call you.
dialog: Either way it's been great working
dialog: with you, man.
text: As Palomino stares at him blankly, the Gaffer slams the door.
text: The car pulls out.
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. DAY
text: Nick and Nicole are sitting up on the bed, alone on the now
text: empty set.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Nicole, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
dialog: You were great in that Richard Gere
dialog: movie.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Shut up. You're no different than he
dialog: is. You lie, you're deceitful...
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I'm not lying. Christ, I tell everyone
dialog: how great you are. I've got nothing
dialog: but respect and admiration for you.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Oh God, now you're doing your own
dialog: fucking script.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Well, why do you think I wrote it?!
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I have no idea!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: It's about you. It's about how I
dialog: feel about you.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Christ, did you get a bump on your
dialog: head, Nicky. 'Cause you're talking
text: like an idiot.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Nicole. I've loved you since the day
dialog: we met.
text: Nicole sits for a long moment in stunned silence.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Why didn't you tell me?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I didn't want anything to get in the
dialog: way of us working together.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: God, and all this time I thought...
text: Nick and Nicole move into a shy, trembling, heartfelt kiss.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAWN
text: Nicole snaps awake with a jolt. She glances quickly at the
text: clock which reads 4:35. The sound of the shower still running
text: in the bathroom.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Oh, God.
text: Nicole leaps out of bed and races into the bathroom. As the
text: camera follows her, she closes the bathroom door, right
text: against the lens, turning the image to total BLACKNESS.
text: The frame is BLACK. The recognizable clatter and clunk of
text: the FILM CREW is heard. Wanda's voice is prominent.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Don't go out that door!
text: Suddenly a DOOR opens away from camera and the AC stops, a
text: foot away from the lens. Behind him, Wanda and the rest of
text: the crew can be seen through the door, preparing for filming.
text: We see now the door and the plywood walls around it are FAKE.
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. DAY
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: It's part of the set, goddamnit. Now
dialog: go around.
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: Next time. This is an emergency.
text: The AC rushes past and a moment later the camera DOLLIES
text: slowly through the fake door toward Wanda pacing near the
text: set camera.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: (into her walkie)
dialog: Has Ellen showed up yet?
speaker_heading: WALKIE
scene_heading: ssss... kkkkkrrk.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Get her into wardrobe right away.
speaker_heading: WALKIE
dialog: ssskk... ssssrrrk?
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: No! Scene six; Scene five has been
dialog: postponed. I'm not going to say it
text: again; Mr. Palomino is not working
dialog: today. Now where is that smoke
dialog: machine!
scene_heading: INT. SET BUILDING, HALLWAY. DAY
text: The AC bursts through a door at the end of the hallway and
text: walks quickly toward the camera. Without knocking he pushes
text: open the bathroom door and suddenly stops short.
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: Oh. Sorry.
text: Standing on his tiptoes at the sink, straining to turn off
text: the running faucet is, TITO a DWARF. He is dressed in a sky
text: blue tuxedo with tails. A top hat and white gloves rest on
text: the closed toilet seat. Tito appears extremely annoyed.
speaker_heading: TITO
dialog: What do you want?!
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: I need to use the bathroom. Kind of
dialog: an emergency.
speaker_heading: TITO
dialog: Well, fucking knock!!
text: Tito grabs his hat and gloves and marches down the hall, the
text: AC staring after him in astonishment.
speaker_heading: TITO
dialog: (muttering)
dialog: I swear to Christ, one of these days
dialog: I'm going to punch somebody in the
dialog: balls!
scene_heading: INT. WARDROBE ROOM. DAY
text: Camera is close on Nicole, her eyes clenched shut as a thin
text: white veil is placed on her head. Camera pulls back to reveal
text: SACHIKO, the Costume Designer putting the finishing touches
text: to Nicole's costume, which appears to be an elaborate white
text: wedding gown. Nick stands nearby, smoking.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Just as we pull up to your apartment
text: Palomino suddenly says he feels so
dialog: sick he can't work today.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: God. Was it something he ate?
speaker_heading: SACHIKO
dialog: Stand up, please.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Can he work tomorrow?
speaker_heading: SACHIKO
dialog: Turn around, please.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Don't know that either. But I'm not
dialog: worrying about it. I had this dream
dialog: last night where I was on the set.
dialog: You were in it, and another woman,
dialog: someone older. Anyway, everything
dialog: was going wrong. The harder I tried
dialog: to hold things together the more
dialog: they fell apart. And you know what
dialog: that dream was telling me, Nicole?
dialog: You just got to roll with it. And
dialog: that's what I'm doing, I'm rolling
dialog: with it. So, we'll just shoot the
dialog: Dream Sequence today.
text: Just then Tito walks in.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Hey, Tito. You look great, man.
speaker_heading: TITO
dialog: I feel like shit.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No, you look good. Thanks for coming
dialog: in on such short notice. This is
text: Nicole; she's playing Ellen.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Hello. Toto, is it?
speaker_heading: TITO
dialog: Tito.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Listen, if there's anything I can do
dialog: to make you... if you need... uh,
dialog: just let me know.
speaker_heading: TITO
text: Put a stool in the bathroom.
text: Tito walks out, followed immediately by Sachiko, leaving
text: Nicole alone with Nick.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Did I just offend him?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: "Short notice?"
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Come on; that was nothing. I'm the
dialog: one who called him "Toto." Jesus,
dialog: I'm out of it. I dreamt I was on the
dialog: set last night too.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Oh yeah?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Yeah. You were in the dream.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Was I freaking out?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Actually, you were.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: That's great: I freak out in my dream;
dialog: I freak out in your dream. No wonder
dialog: I'm fucking exhausted.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Nick...
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yeah?
text: Nicole stares at Nick for a long moment then smiles briefly
text: and turns away.
scene_heading: INT. A CORNER OF THE SET. DAY
text: A dented, ancient smoke machine squats forlornly in the middle
text: of the set. WOLF (with eyepatch), the GAFFER, AC, BOOM MAN,
text: and the SOUND MAN stand around it, scrutinizing it intently.
text: Wolf seems in an unusually good mood.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Alright, guys; special effects today.
dialog: Could be fun. Who knows how to work
dialog: this baby?
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: It's the old T-160. I used it once
dialog: in '85.
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: Damn. '85.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: That's where the gas goes.
speaker_heading: BOOM
dialog: No, that's where the oil goes.
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: Is it?
speaker_heading: BOOM
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: You're right. It's coming back now.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: I'm going to let you handle this
dialog: one, Bob. This is your baby. And
dialog: Les, if he needs help you give him a
dialog: hand. OK, guys? We're all working
dialog: together today.
text: Wolf walks off. The Gaffer kneels to inspect the smoke machine
dialog: closer.
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: Yup, all coming back now. Like riding
dialog: a bike. T-160, 1985. 1985, T-160.
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: Way to go, Bob.
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. NEAR THE CAMERA
text: Wanda stands alone by the camera, looking around at the
text: bustling crew like a battalion commander watching her troops
text: in battle. Nick approaches her.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: How are we doing, Wanda?
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Not good, Nick. Not bad, but not
dialog: good. We need to finish this scene
dialog: and do Scene thirty-one today.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Scene thirty-one?! I left my notes
dialog: for Scene thirty-one at home! I didn't
dialog: know we were --
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Nick, Nick. I'll send someone to
dialog: your apartment to pick them up. Now,
dialog: relax.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Oh, OK. Send somebody to my apartment
dialog: to pick them up; it's the red
text: notebook, under the bed.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: It's taken care of, Nick.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Good. Great. Good.
text: Nick walks off quickly, muttering to himself. A moment later
text: Wolf strolls up to Wanda.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: We're all lit, the smoke machine is
dialog: under control; we're ready to go.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: (hard)
dialog: What about the dolly?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Just need to see a run-through and
dialog: we're all set. I'm going to make
dialog: your job easy today, Wanda. Wandaful.
text: (he slips his arm
dialog: around her)
dialog: Mmm, I'm glad you wore that perfume.
dialog: And don't worry about Palomino; I'll
dialog: take you to a jazz club tonight.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Oh, I can't make it. I have to go
text: see Chad; he's extremely ill.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Oh, by the way my eye's much better.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Listen, Wolf, this may not be the
dialog: best time to say this but our
dialog: relationship is going nowhere.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Please, don't take it personally.
dialog: Because I care for you, Wolf, I really
dialog: do. But I've had this feeling for
dialog: quite a while and I think it's time
dialog: we ended it. OK?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: (pause)
dialog: OK.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: I think it's better.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: So do I.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Well, good. Still friends?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Great, cause we still have to work
dialog: together and there's no reason it
dialog: has to be unpleasant. Give me a hug.
text: Wanda and Wolf move into an extremely wooden embrace.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: You're a real special guy, Wolf.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Thanks.
text: Wanda slips Wolf a tender smile then walks away.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: (into her walkie)
dialog: OK, let's get the A Team in please!
dialog: Nick, Ellen, Mr. Tito!
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. DAY
text: Nick is working with the crew and the actors. The set consists
text: of two flats (one with the fake door) joined to make a corner.
text: The flats are painted fire-engine red.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: OK, here's the shot. We start wide
text: with Ellen standing absolutely still
text: right in the middle of the frame.
dialog: You got that, Wolf?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (notices eyepatch)
dialog: What happened to your eye?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Nothing. It's a little sensitive
dialog: today.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Can you see?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: (snaps)
dialog: Of course I can see!
text: For a moment Nick looks like he might snap back at Wolf but
text: he draws a deep breath and continues.
speaker_heading: NICK
text: OK, Ellen is standing there. The
text: smoke is flowing in and: Ellen's
dialog: line.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I am so hungry.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Good, Tito, that's your cue.
text: The fake door opens and Tito enters wearing his top hat and
text: carrying a golden apple in his gloved hands.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You walk around her once, hold the
dialog: apple out, that's right; just beyond
dialog: her reach. You're staring at her
dialog: hard. Harder, good. Then stop right
dialog: here. Can we get a mark, please?
text: The AC moves up to Nick and places a piece of yellow tape on
text: the floor. CU the yellow tape.
speaker_heading: NICK
text: Then we dolly in to Tito's Close-up.
dialog: Alright, Wolf?
speaker_heading: WANDA
text: It should be hand-held.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No, I think it's better on the dolly.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Whatever.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Nick, do I see him?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No, just the apple. And Tito, right
dialog: after we dolly in give me a little
dialog: laugh there.
speaker_heading: TITO
dialog: A little laugh?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Big, little; anything you feel like
dialog: doing. OK? Good. Let's shoot one.
dialog: Call it, Wanda.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: OK, here we go. Camera back to One.
text: Action on the smoke.
text: The Gaffer turns on the smoke machine which emits a pathetic
text: wisp of smoke that immediately dissipates.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: And roll sound.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Hold it, Wanda. Can we get a little
dialog: more smoke? Is that possible?
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: Oh, sure.
text: The Gaffer adjusts a knob and another thin puff of smoke
text: wheezes out.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Good. Call it, Wanda.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Going for picture. Lock it up. And
text: roll sound.
speaker_heading: SOUND
dialog: Speed!
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Roll camera!
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: Rolling!
speaker_heading: CLAPPER
dialog: Scene six, take one!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: And, action.
scene_heading: INT. THE DREAM. TAKE ONE. DAY
text: Nicole stands motionless in the middle of the empty set. Her
text: white wedding gown stands out sharply against the deep red
text: walls. A sad shred of smoke drifts by her head.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I am so hungry.
text: Tito opens the door and walks in, staring hard at Nicole.
text: His sky-blue tuxedo gleams in the rich light. He walks around
text: her in a circle holding the golden apple just beyond her
text: reach. He stops on his mark and the camera dollies into a CU
text: of him. He doesn't laugh. Nick watches this for a moment in
text: intense concentration.
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. DAY
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: And... cut.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: That's a cut. Nick; comments?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yeah, just a couple. I thought that
dialog: was uh... good. Tito, that was very
dialog: good, man, really. You didn't feel
dialog: like laughing?
speaker_heading: TITO
dialog: I laughed.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Oh, OK; I guess I missed it. You
dialog: could make it bigger if you want.
dialog: And Ellen, maybe just a little more
dialog: tension when you see him.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I thought I didn't see him.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Right, maybe you see him a little
dialog: bit.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Alright, I'm confused. Do I see him
dialog: or not?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You see him.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: OK, what is the tension? Who is Toto?
speaker_heading: TITO
dialog: (hard)
dialog: It's Tito.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: (alarmed)
dialog: What did I say?
speaker_heading: TITO
dialog: Toto.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Oh, God. I'm sorry, Tito. I don't
dialog: know why I'm doing that. I'm really
dialog: sorry.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Ellen, come on now; concentrate.
dialog: Remember; you're marrying Damian
dialog: tomorrow. You're a little anxious.
dialog: You have this dream. Let's call it
text: an Anxiety Dream, and Tito represents
dialog: the anxiety.
text: CU Tito looking none too happy about this representation.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: OK? It seems pretty simple.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Let's just try it.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Good. And Bob, let's really have
dialog: some smoke on this one.
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: OK, more smoke.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: I still think it should be hand-held.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yeah, well, I don't want it hand-
dialog: held. I want it on the dolly. Where's
dialog: my notebook, Wanda?
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: On it's way, Nick.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Good. Call it, Wanda.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Lock it up. Going for picture. And
text: roll sound.
speaker_heading: SOUND
dialog: Speed!
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Roll camera!
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: Rolling!
speaker_heading: CLAPPER
dialog: Scene six, take two!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: And, action.
scene_heading: INT. THE DREAM. TAKE TWO
text: Nicole stands motionless as a few more emaciated puffs of
text: smoke hang in the air.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I am so hungry.
text: Tito enters, walks around her holding the apple just beyond
text: her reach then moves to his mark. The camera dollies into a
text: CU. He does not laugh.
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. DAY
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Cut.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: That's a cut. Going again, Nick?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Going again, please stand by.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: OK, Ellen, good. You're on to
dialog: something there.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: No, something's not right. It all
dialog: feels fake to me.
text: Nick's tone with Nicole suddenly takes on an almost
text: imperceptible edge, tinged with annoyance.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Well, it's not fake; it's real. Just
dialog: remember, you really want the apple.
dialog: Tito, I still think we could see
text: more of a laugh at the end.
speaker_heading: TITO
dialog: What kind of laugh?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Just a laugh.
speaker_heading: TITO
dialog: Show me.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Oh, OK. A laugh. I'm thinking maybe
dialog: like this. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
text: Everyone watches Nick demonstrate the laugh. He seems unaware
text: he resembles a drunken, slightly annoyed idiot.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Something like that. OK? And remember,
dialog: Tito, this is a dream. Not everything
dialog: has to make sense. A laugh right
dialog: there heightens our sense of... of...
speaker_heading: TITO
dialog: Anxiety.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Exactly. Wolf, how was that for you?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: I still think it should be hand-held.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (snaps)
dialog: Well, God damn it! It's not going to
dialog: be! It's on the dolly so just forget
dialog: about it!
text: There is a strained moment of silence on the set as everyone
text: witnesses this rebuke.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: And Bob, what the fuck is that smoke?
dialog: Might as well get a couple hamsters
text: in here blowing smoke rings for
dialog: Christ's sake.
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: The septic valve wasn't open. I got
dialog: it now. We're going to see some smoke
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Alright, let's try another take.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: And, lock it up.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Nick, could I talk to you for a
dialog: minute?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: WOLF
text: In private.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (sighs in exasperation)
dialog: Alright.
text: Nick follows Wolf off the set.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Release the lock-up. Everyone stand
dialog: by.
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: We'll see some smoke now.
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: Way to go, Bob.
scene_heading: INT. A CORNER. DAY
text: As soon as Wolf and Nick reach the darkened corner, Wolf
text: whirls to face Nick.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: I really don't like being spoken to
dialog: like that, Nick!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yeah, well I don't like your attitude!
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: I don't have an attitude!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: The hell you don't! Every time I ask
dialog: you to do something all I get is No,
dialog: No, No and I'm sick of it! I hired
dialog: you to do a job; if you're not going
dialog: to do it you better let me know right
dialog: now!
text: Wolf is about to yell back at Nick when suddenly he stops
text: and lets out a deep, painful sigh.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: I'm sorry, Nick. I'm going through
dialog: some heavy shit.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: I can't really go into it. It's pretty
text: heavy.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Personal?
text: Wolf makes a slight motion with his head toward Wanda who is
text: standing some distance away watching them. Seeing the two
text: men looking at her Wanda shoots them a hard glare which
text: prompts Wolf and Nick to turn away quickly.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Personal, professional, emotional.
dialog: It's doing a number on me. And now
dialog: you're telling me you're going to
dialog: fire me.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I didn't say that, Wolf. Come on,
dialog: I'm not going to fire you. You're
dialog: doing a great job here.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Am I?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yeah, I don't know what I'd do without
dialog: you, man. You've got a great eye. I
dialog: just hope it's not the one under
dialog: that eyepatch.
text: Nick lets out a tense, strained laugh but Wolf's only response
text: is to stare back at him sadly.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Listen, Wolf. Let me tell you one
dialog: thing I've learned; sometimes you
dialog: just have to roll with things. You
dialog: know?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: You're right.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Roll with it, man. You'll be OK.
text: Wolf lets out another deep sigh.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Thanks, bro.
scene_heading: INT. A CORNER OF THE SET. DAY
text: The Gaffer, Boom man, and AC kneel around the smoke machine.
text: A can of gas and a quart of oil stand beside them.
speaker_heading: BOOM
dialog: That's where the oil goes.
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: No, that's where the gas goes.
speaker_heading: BOOM
dialog: I'm tellin' you, Bob. That's where
dialog: the oil goes.
speaker_heading: SOUND
dialog: Lester, don't you think Bob knows
dialog: where the oil goes?!
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: I don't remember using oil in '85.
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: Maybe both the oil and gas go in
dialog: there?
text: The Gaffer and Boom man turn and look at the AC for a long
dialog: moment.
speaker_heading: BOOM
dialog: I think he's right.
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: I think he is too. OK, three parts
dialog: gas, one part oil.
text: The Gaffer and Boom man pour liberal amounts of gas and oil
text: into the T-160.
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. DAY
text: Nick rushes up to his position by the camera.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Is my notebook here yet, Wanda?
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Any minute, Nick.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Good. Call it, Wanda.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Going for picture. Lock it up. And
text: roll sound.
speaker_heading: SOUND
dialog: Speed!
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Roll camera!
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: Rolling!
speaker_heading: CLAPPER
dialog: Scene six, take three!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: And, action.
scene_heading: INT. THE DREAM. TAKE THREE
text: Nicole stands motionless in her white wedding dress, looking
text: genuinely alarmed, possibly because of the huge clouds of
text: smoke now spewing out of the panting smoke machine.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I am so hungry.
text: Tito enters, stares at her hard and walks around her in a
text: circle holding the apple just beyond her reach. The smoke is
text: so thick both of them are barely visible. Just as Tito gets
text: to his mark the smoke machine backfires with a tremendous
text: explosion and begins filling the room with dense, blinding
dialog: smoke.
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. DAY
text: The smoke blanks out the entire frame. Frantic shouts are
text: heard from unseen bodies.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Cut! Cut! Cut!
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Turn it off! Turn it off!
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: I can't find the switch!
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Pull the plug! Bob! Pull the plug!
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Open the door! Get some water!
speaker_heading: GAFFER
dialog: I got it! I got it!
text: The smoke machine emits a loud hiss and dies, filling the
text: room with sudden silence. Slowly the smoke begins to clear
text: as the crew moves around muttering and coughing.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Clear the set! Ellen! Tito! Please
dialog: step off the set!
speaker_heading: TITO (V.O.)
dialog: I'm off the set!
speaker_heading: NICOLE (V.O.)
dialog: So am I.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Then who is that? Who is that? Please
dialog: step off the set!
text: A pair of fuzzy-slippered feet enter the smoky frame. The
text: camera BOOMS up, passing over a woman's bare shins, a
text: flowered, blue silk housecoat until finally coming to rest
text: on the pleasantly smiling face of CORA. This is the same
text: woman who played Ellen's Mother in Part One; she is dressed
text: exactly the same as she was in their scene. The camera pulls
text: back to reveal JEFF the Intern standing nervously beside her
text: with a red notebook in his hands.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Hi, Nicky.
text: Nick gapes in utter astonishment.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Mom!
scene_heading: INT. THE SET PRODUCTION OFFICE. DAY
text: Wanda speaks urgently into the phone while Nicole stands
text: beside her. Jeff (still wearing his hat) waits at a distance
text: clutching Nick's red notebook.
speaker_heading: WANDA
scene_heading: Cora Reve, R-E-V-E. Blue housecoat,
dialog: blue slippers. How do I know? Because
text: she's sitting ten feet away from me.
dialog: Well sweetheart, that's going to be
dialog: a real fucking problem.
text: Nicole turns away and walks past Jeff to the Craft Service
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: She was waiting outside Nick's
dialog: apartment when I went to pick up his
dialog: notebook. She said she was looking
dialog: for him so I figured I should just
dialog: bring her up here. You look really
dialog: pretty in that dress.
text: Nicole nods politely then looks to the Makeup corner where
text: Nick sits talking earnestly to his mother.
scene_heading: INT. MAKEUP CORNER
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: How did you get here?
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: I took a bus in; went right to your
dialog: apartment.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: How did you get out of your room?
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Oh, I just went right through the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: It was unlocked!?
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: No, it was locked. I just went through
dialog: it. It's something I've learned to
dialog: do, Nicky. I can walk through just
dialog: about anything; like air.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Mom, you've got to stop doing this.
dialog: I'm serious. I'm a little upset with
dialog: you. You could have gotten lost, or
dialog: hurt.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: I wanted to see you. I've missed
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I know, Mom; I've missed you too.
dialog: But it's not really a good time.
text: Nicole approaches, holding up the hem of her wedding gown.
text: There is a subtle tension smoldering between her and Nick.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: They're sending a car. It should be
dialog: here in a couple of hours. They didn't
dialog: even know she was gone.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Jesus, I don't believe this.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: I'm sorry, Nick. If I knew there was
dialog: going to be a wedding I would have
dialog: worn my fucking hat.
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. DAY
text: The camera holds on Tito pacing slowly, alone on the set. He
text: is smoking fiercely, holding his top hat with one hand.
text: Suddenly he begins laughing in a loud, stage bellow.
scene_heading: INT. A CORNER OF THE SET. DAY
text: Nick sets a chair for his mother and helps her sit down.
text: Nicole joins Tito on the set and talks quietly to him.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: There. How's that, Mom? Can you see?
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Is the little fellow going to do
dialog: gymnastics?
text: Tito glances up at her quickly.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Shhhh! No. Now come on, Mom. You've
text: got to be quiet. Absolutely quiet.
dialog: OK?
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: OK.
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. NEAR THE CAMERA. DAY
text: Wanda and Wolf stand beside each other in tense, awkward
text: silence for a long moment.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: How are you doing?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Good; real good.
text: Wolf looks as if he's about to burst into tears as Nick walks
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: How's the smoke machine?
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: It's dead, Nick. I've got calls out
dialog: to every Effects house in the city
dialog: but I just can't seem to locate --
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Forget it. We'll shoot without it.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: But Nick, it's a Dream Sequence.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: That's the way it goes, Wanda. We're
dialog: just going to have to roll with it.
dialog: Nothing else we can do. We've got to
dialog: roll with it, right, Wolf?
text: Wolf meets Nick's eyes and gives an extremely melancholy
text: nod. Nick turns to address Nicole and Tito and the edge
text: immediately slips back into his voice.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: OK, here we go. Ellen, you've got to
dialog: keep reaching for that apple. I don't
dialog: feel that you really want it. I mean,
dialog: Christ, how many times do I have to
dialog: tell you!
text: Nicole glares at Nick for a moment then abruptly turns and
text: walks off the set. Nick stares after her in confusion then
text: quickly follows her.
speaker_heading: WANDA
text: Everyone stand by. Nobody move. Going
text: again, right away.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. NYC. DAY
text: Nicole stands with her back to the camera as Nick strides up
text: to her with impatience.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Alright, Nicole. What's the matter?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: You tell me! You're the one with the
dialog: bug up your ass!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Now wait just a second!
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: You've been picking on me all day! I
dialog: can't do anything right!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I'm sorry if I was short with you,
dialog: Nicole, but I think you can see I'm
dialog: under a little pressure here. I'm
dialog: shooting a Dream Sequence without a
dialog: smoke machine, my mother's out there
text: thinking she's at a circus wedding
dialog: and you tell me the whole movie seems
dialog: fake!
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I never said that!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You did too. You said, "Everything
dialog: feels fake."
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I meant me! I feel fake! Everything
dialog: I'm doing feels fake. I can't act. I
dialog: should just do shower scenes in
dialog: Richard Gere movies for the rest of
dialog: my life!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Nicole, that's ridiculous. You're a
dialog: fantastic actress. All you have to
dialog: do is show me you want that apple
dialog: more than anything else in the world;
dialog: don't give up. Understand? You cannot
dialog: give up.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: OK.
text: Suddenly Wanda yells out.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Ready, Nick?!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Ready!
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. DAY
text: Nick rushes back onto the set.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: OK, here we go. Everybody focus,
dialog: concentrate. And Tito, we're still
dialog: looking for that little laugh, pal.
dialog: OK? Call it, Wanda!
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Picture's up. There will be no smoke
text: in this scene. No smoke. No smoke in
text: the Dream Sequence. And roll sound.
speaker_heading: SOUND
dialog: Speed!
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Roll camera!
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: Rolling!
speaker_heading: CLAPPER
dialog: Scene six, take four!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: And, action.
scene_heading: INT. THE DREAM. TAKE FOUR. DAY
text: Nicole stands motionless in her wedding gown.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I am so hungry.
text: Tito walks in, stares at her hard, then walks around her
text: once with the golden apple just beyond her outstretched hands.
text: He stops and the camera dollies into his CLOSE-UP. Nick
text: watches in hopeful expectation. He waits and waits but Tito
text: does not laugh.
text: Just then the door in the rear set wall opens and Cora steps
text: in, looking oddly puzzled.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Oh, I thought this was the TV room.
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. DAY
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Cut!
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: That's a cut. Going again, right
dialog: away.
scene_heading: INT. OFF THE SET. DAY
text: Nick escorts his mother back to her chair.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Mom, listen to me. I don't want you
dialog: to move from this chair. Do you
dialog: understand?
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Oh Jesus, you sound just like your
dialog: father...
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Mom, I'm serious.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: OK, OK. I won't move.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Thank you.
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. DAY
text: Nick walks back on the set and addresses Nicole and Tito.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: OK, good. Very good.
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Tito, I think we're having a little
dialog: communication problem here. All I
dialog: want you to do is laugh. OK?
speaker_heading: TITO
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I told you why.
speaker_heading: TITO
dialog: Tell me again.
scene_heading: INT. OFF THE SET. DAY
text: Wolf (still wearing his eyepatch) walks over and sits quietly
text: in a chair beside Cora. He does not speak to her and gazes
text: blankly out at Nick, Tito, and Nicole on the set some distance
text: away. Cora however stares at the side of his head with such
text: intensity Wolf can't help but turn to her.
text: Cora still doesn't take her eyes off him and in fact stares
text: even more intently into his eye.
text: Wolf glances away for a moment then looks back. Cora continues
text: to stare at him. Suddenly, his eye is full of tears. Cora
text: watches in rapt silence. Wolf is crying openly now. Cora
text: reveals no hint of emotion as she reaches out and gently
text: lifts the eyepatch off of his eye. A tight smile of
text: satisfaction creases her lips as a tiny pool of tears is
text: released, streaming quickly down Wolf's cheek. No one sees
dialog: this.
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. DAY
text: Nick paces tensely in front of Nicole and Tito.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Look, Tito. It's not that big a deal.
dialog: It's a dream, alright. Strange things
dialog: happen in a dream. All you have to
dialog: do is laugh. Why is that such a
dialog: problem?
speaker_heading: TITO
dialog: Why does it have to be a dwarf?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TITO
dialog: Why does my character have to be a
dialog: dwarf?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: He doesn't have to be a dwarf.
speaker_heading: TITO
dialog: Then why is he?! Is that the only
dialog: way you can make this a dream; put a
dialog: dwarf in it?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No, Tito; that's not --
speaker_heading: TITO
dialog: Have you ever had a dream with a
dialog: dwarf in it?! Do you know anyone
text: who's had a dream with a dwarf in
dialog: it? NO! I don't even have dreams
dialog: with dwarves in them! The only place
dialog: I've seen dwarves in dreams is in
dialog: stupid movies like this! Make it
dialog: weird; put a dwarf in it. Everyone
dialog: will go "whoa whoa whoa, must be a
dialog: dream, there's a fucking dwarf in
dialog: it!" Well, I'm sick of it. You can
dialog: take this Dream Sequence and shove
dialog: it up your ass!
text: Tito hurls his top hat and gloves to the floor and walks
text: out. Everyone stares at Nick who is frozen in stunned silence.
text: Finally Wanda approaches him hesitantly.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Nick?
dialog: (no response)
dialog: I can get right on the phone. We'll
dialog: try to get another... small person
dialog: here as soon as possible.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No. He's absolutely right.
text: Nick sighs heavily and sinks to sit on the dolly in silence.
text: Wolf appears behind him, still wiping his eyes.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: You want to just shoot Ellen, Nick?
text: She could be in the dream by herself.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No. We're not going to shoot anything.
dialog: I'm sorry. Thanks for all your help,
dialog: but it's over. I can't take it
dialog: anymore. I tried to roll with it but
dialog: it's time to face the music; I can't
dialog: do this. I am not a director. The
text: shoot is over. I give up.
text: Nick's speech has the simple eloquence of truth; he is not
text: bitter or self-pitying. He seems unaware of how disturbing
text: this is to the crew. They all stand around him in shock,
text: afraid to move or speak. Finally Wolf turns to the AC and
text: puts his hand on his shoulder, like a father to his young
dialog: son.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Take the camera off the dolly. Start
text: putting it away.
text: Everyone watches the AC unfasten the camera in silence. Nicole
text: stands alone on the set in her wedding dress, still holding
text: the golden apple. Her face is frozen in dismay. Suddenly
text: CORA comes through the set door and marches up to Nicole.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Give me that apple!
text: At the sound of his mother's voice, Nick looks up. He sees
text: her snatch the apple from Nicole's hand and march back out
text: the door, closing it behind her.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: (behind the door)
dialog: I'm ready, Nick!
scene_heading: INT. BY THE CAMERA. DAY
text: Nick gets up slowly and whispers intensely to Wanda, Wolf,
text: and the rest of the crew.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Roll camera. Roll sound. Let's go.
dialog: Right away.
text: Wolf grabs the camera and puts it on his shoulder (hand-held)
text: as the rest of the crew moves quickly and silently into
text: position. On a terse signal from Nick the camera starts
text: rolling.
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. THE DREAM. DAY
text: Nicole takes the silent "action" cue from Nick.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I am so hungry.
text: Right on cue Cora walks through the door, holding the golden
text: apple out in front of her. She circles Nicole with
text: determination, seemingly oblivious to Nick and the rest of
text: the crew hovering behind Wolf as he begins following her
text: with the hand-held camera. Wolf is now in his element; gliding
text: like Nureyev with the camera. When he pans suddenly with
text: Cora the whole crew ducks wildly and dives out of camera
dialog: range.
text: Cora finally stops circling Nicole and stops abruptly.
text: Suddenly she raises the apple right out in front of Nicole.
text: Wolf glides forward with the camera, framing an amazing CU
text: of the apple with Nicole seen behind it. Nicole reaches out,
text: grabs the apple and takes a huge, resounding bite out of it.
text: CU Nick's face, eyes wide in anxious delight.
text: Cora takes one step forward. CU her fuzzy slippers stopping
text: right on the yellow tape mark. Cora waits momentarily until
text: Wolf has reframed both her and Nicole, then lets out a huge
dialog: laugh.
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. DAY
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: And cut!!
text: General mayhem erupts on the set.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Wolf, talk to me, man! Did you get
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Got it, Nick! Everything!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: The Close-up?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Perfect. See? That's what I meant
dialog: about going hand-held!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You're a genius, man! What about the
dialog: focus?!
speaker_heading: AC
dialog: Nailed it.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Fuckin' A!
text: Wolf slaps the AC's palm, then the Gaffer's standing right
text: beside him. He turns gleefully to the next person but seeing
text: it is Wanda he rigidly turns away.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Going again, Nick?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: How was the sound?
speaker_heading: SOUND
dialog: I could use another but definitely
dialog: acceptable.
text: Nick runs up to his mother and throws his arms around her.
text: Nicole stands beside him.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Mom, you kook! That was incredible!
dialog: Did you know we were filming?
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: (testily)
dialog: Of course I knew you were filming.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You were great, you're a natural.
dialog: And Nicole, that was beautiful. Don't
dialog: you dare tell me that felt fake.
text: Suddenly, on an impulse surprising both of them, Nick and
text: Nicole embrace. Just then Wanda steps up.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Going again, Nick?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Oh, hold on. Let me think a second.
text: The set grows suddenly quiet as Nick begins pacing rapidly,
text: muttering to himself.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Can I use it for the Dream Sequence,
dialog: that's the question. Does it work
dialog: for the Dream Sequence?
text: Nick suddenly looks up and sees everybody staring at him;
text: Nicole in her wedding gown, Wolf with his eyepatch, his mother
text: still eating the apple, Wanda, the crew.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: We're going with it, Wanda!
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Alright everyone, listen up. That is
text: a wrap on Scene Six.
text: The set erupts in applause.
speaker_heading: SOUND
dialog: Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: SOUND
dialog: I need to record room tone. I'll
dialog: need thirty seconds of silence.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Oh, alright! Quiet. Quiet! Shut up!!
text: Thirty seconds of room tone. The
dialog: sooner you're quiet the sooner we're
dialog: done.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: (whispers to Nick)
dialog: What's room tone?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: It's for the sound, Mom. We just
dialog: have to be quiet.
text: At that moment a door opens at the rear of the set and a
text: DOCTOR and NURSE enter. The Nurse carries an extra overcoat.
text: Jeff, the Driver, turns and sternly whispers for them to be
dialog: quiet.
speaker_heading: WANDA
text: And roll sound. Nobody move.
speaker_heading: SOUND
dialog: Speed.
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. DAY
text: The camera is wide, showing the entire set, actors, and crew.
text: Everyone stands in perfect silence, as motionless as statues.
text: As the silence continues the mood on the set gradually
text: changes. One by one people drift into their own private worlds
dialog: of reflection.
text: MS the Sound man, alternately watching his recorder and his
text: stopwatch. Behind him the Boom man holds the mike in position
text: to record general ambiance while staring off into the
dialog: distance.
text: CU the tape recorder spinning in quiet precision.
text: CU the stopwatch, its giant second hand showing five seconds
dialog: have passed.
text: MS Nick standing next to his mother who drapes one arm
text: casually over Nick's shoulder. Nick glances up and sees Nicole
text: beside him, absorbed in her own thoughts. Suddenly she looks
text: up and her eyes meet Nick's. She slips him the barest hint
text: of a smile.
text: The camera DOLLIES slowly through the standing, silent group,
text: passing over faces in different degrees of thought.
text: CU the Sound man's stopwatch, the giant second hand showing
text: ten seconds have passed.
text: MS Nick. He is so immersed in thought he looks at no one.
text: The camera slowly DOLLIES into a CU of him.
scene_heading: INT. AN AWARDS CEREMONY
text: CHAD PALOMINO stands at a gleaming podium, looking radiant
text: in an immaculate tuxedo. He holds an envelope in his hands.
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: We have a new category this year:
dialog: Best Film Ever Made by a Human Being.
dialog: And the winner is none other than my
dialog: Best Bud, Nick Reve!
text: Amid thunderous applause Nick bounds on the stage and accepts
text: an Oscar from Chad. He stands grinning like an idiot as the
text: applause continues.
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. DAY
text: MS Nick, still wrapped in thought, his lips starting to form
text: the same idiotic smile. MS Nicole. The camera DOLLIES slowly
text: into her face, now tinged with a slight uneasiness.
scene_heading: INT. A CHEAP RESTAURANT
text: Wide shot at the counter. Nicole stands facing a large bald
text: man with his back to the camera. She is wearing a cheap pink
text: waitress uniform and has her hair under a hairnet.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Had any experience?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I was an actress for a while.
text: She pulls her headshot out of her shoulder bag and hands it
text: to the man with a hopeful smile. He flips over the headshot
text: and looks at her credits with confused annoyance.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Yeah, but can you cook a hamburger?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: (doubtfully)
dialog: Probably.
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. DAY
text: MS Nicole. She jerks her head slightly in response to this
text: moment of thought.
text: CU the stopwatch, showing fifteen seconds have passed.
text: MS Wolf. The camera begins a slow DOLLY into his CU.
scene_heading: INT. WANDA'S APT. DAY
text: Wolf stands like Thor in the middle of the Red Set, his arms
text: crossed over his chest, his jaw set in determination. Smoke
text: billows around him. At his feet, dressed in Nicole's wedding
text: gown, Wanda sobs hysterically.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: Wolf, I'm sorry! Please forgive me!
dialog: I love you, Wolf! Please! Give me
dialog: one more chance. Let me prove it! I
dialog: love you! I love you, Wolf!
text: Wolf remains unmoved for a long moment. Finally he reaches
text: out with a forgiving smile and pats Wanda's head.
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. DAY
text: MS Wolf. He glances furtively at Wanda with a trace of hope
text: still in his eyes.
text: MS Wanda, looking off. The camera DOLLIES into her CU.
scene_heading: INT. A CHEAP HOTEL ROOM
text: This is the same hotel room from Part Two, in which we saw
text: Nicole and Chad Palomino. At the moment Wanda and Chad lie
text: panting in the sweat-soaked sheets.
speaker_heading: WANDA
dialog: What I love about you, Chad, is you're
dialog: not afraid of my power.
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: Oh God, Wanda! I love your power.
dialog: It's like an afferdesiac to me!
scene_heading: INT. THE SET. DAY
text: MS Wanda. She shifts slightly and glances quickly around
text: her. Her smile is tinged with the hint of sexual pleasure.
text: MS the Gaffer, frowning, absorbed in thought. The camera
text: DOLLIES into a CU of him.
scene_heading: INT. A CHEAP RESTAURANT. DAY
text: Suddenly, a CU of an incredibly beautiful hamburger being
text: placed in a toasted bun on a gleaming white oval plate. A
text: hand places a garnish of parsley on it then carries the plate
text: to the lunch counter. Camera PANS to reveal the GAFFER sitting
