speaker_heading: SMASH CUT

scene_heading: EXT. WHITE HOUSE GROUNDS - DAY
text: The most famous helicopter in the world lumbers toward the

scene_heading: CLOSER - HELICOPTER
text: It touches down as the Marine Corps color guard snaps to

scene_heading: FULL SHOT - DOORWAY
text: After a moment, PRESIDENT WILLIAM HARRISON MITCHELL appears,
text: accompanied by his wife ELLEN and loyal dog Cupcakes. They

dialog: themselves.
scene_heading: TRACKING SHOT - FIRST FAMILY
text: "HAIL TO THE CHIEF" RINGS OUT across the grounds. For-
text: midably handsome Bill Mitchell is fit and in his early forties.
text: His wife Ellen, still in her early thirties, is considered a
text: classical beauty with a wide "friendly" smile that in certain
text: photographs seems just on the edge of wistful. The dog frolics
text: around them as they wave to the press and smile for the world.
text: Ozzie and Harriet for the Nineties with a bow to FDR and some
text: Camelot thrown in.
dialog: MOVING WITH them...
text: They stride arm in arm beneath the portico that leads to the
text: West Wing. The band is still playing as they head under the
text: archway, disappearing from public view. Then, instantly,
text: as a handler rushes up and grabs the dog, the smiles vanish.
text: Bill lets go of Ellen and Ellen lets go of Bill. He turns
text: to his right and she turns to her left. Off they go in their
dialog: separate directions.

text: too, while they cower behind their water glasses.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: (reading from his
dialog: notebook)
dialog: I wish I had better news... Our
dialog: compassion index is off seven
dialog: points from the last sample and
dialog: that's down eighteen on the year. The

speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Dammit...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I told them no mayo.
dialog: (looking up)

scene_heading: DAVE - Rev. 8/7/92 3.

speaker_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE
speaker_heading: SPEAKER
dialog: Sir, we tried to kill it twice...
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: (whisper again)
dialog: I don't think so, Howard. If you had

dialog: (looking him in the eye)
dialog: When I kill something - - it always

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (steely)
dialog: Always dead.
speaker_heading: MAJ. LEADER
dialog: Mr. President, with all the work your

speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Norman, I don't want you to do this
dialog: cause you're forced to...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I want you to do this because you want

dialog: go over and the American Bar Association
dialog: at the Monroe tomorrow night...
text: The President pauses at one of the desks and fixes a stare.at

speaker_heading: MITCHELL

dialog: The Monroe?
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Uh, yes, sir. The Monroe Hotel...

speaker_heading: MITCHELL

speaker_heading: REED
dialog: We're working on it.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL

speaker_heading: REED

speaker_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE
text: He makes the victory sign with both hands and dismounts the
text: PIG who lets out a SNORT. Dave bounds up to the small
text: platform where he is greeted warmly by Durenburger. Dave

speaker_heading: DURENBURGER
dialog: (reading/monotone)
dialog: Thank you, Mr. President. It certainly
dialog: is nice of you to be with us here today
dialog: considering your busy schedule and

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Well, Don -- it's true that I have a

dialog: that when folks find out about your
dialog: five hundred dollar cash rebate on all
dialog: `93 LeBaron and LeBaron convertibles
dialog: you're gonna be even busier than I am.
text: Dave looks toward the crowd for another reaction but nothing

speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Mommy, is that the President?
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: I sure hope not.

speaker_heading: CHILD (KID)
dialog: (sniffling)
dialog: ... Sam.
speaker_heading: DAVE

text: The Kid thinks for a second then nods. He wipes some stuff
text: off his nose.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Okay. What can run all day without

text: The Kid ponders it for a moment.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (leaning closer)
dialog: Well come on, Sam. It's not your

speaker_heading: SAM (KID)
dialog: My nose?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Right. !!!

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Well, is that really true? I mean,

speaker_heading: DUANE
dialog: Certainly.

speaker_heading: DAVE

speaker_heading: DAVE

speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Remember that First Liberty stuff we

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: 
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: I just dumped it on him instead.
text: Bob looks at him stunned.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: When does it break?
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: Couple of days.
dialog: (showing him a folder)
dialog: Anyhow, look at these tracking polls,
dialog: they'll burn up in your hands: seventy-
dialog: three percent with seniors, eighty-
dialog: four with working mothers...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (a little uneasy)
dialog: Alan, we still have to control this
dialog: guy...
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: (ignoring him)
dialog: And look at this. Russell came around
dialog: on the trade bill.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: You're kidding.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: How long have you been waiting to pass
dialog: that thing?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Three years.
speaker_heading: REED

scene_heading: PRESIDENTIAL MOTORCADE - AERIAL SHOT - DAY 80
text: The long line of black limousines and police motorcycles makes
text: its way through downtown Washington.
scene_heading: INT. PRESIDENTIAL LIMOUSINE
text: Dave sits next to the First Lady in the back seat of the limo.
text: Both of them stare straight ahead. Finally, after several
text: seconds of silence, Ellen turns to Dave.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Why are you doing this, Bill?
text: He looks over at her, startled.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (irritated)
dialog: Since when do you care about the
dialog: homeless?
text: Dave thinks for a moment.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I care about the homeless.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Yeah. I'm sure it's keeping you up
dialog: nights.
text: She turns away from him, twisting in the seat. The bottom of
text: Ellen's skirt hikes up her thigh, exposing the top part of
text: her leg. Dave looks down at it, drawn to the sight of naked
text: flesh. Sensing something, Ellen glances back and catches him
dialog: looking.
speaker_heading: CLOSER
text: Their eyes lock for a moment. Dave
text: smiles quickly and glances out the
text: window. Ellen looks down at her own
text: leg a little puzzled.
scene_heading: EXT. HELPING HAND SHELTER - DAY
text: The sidewalk is teeming with press. The shelter itself is
text: painted a bright shade of blue - - a cheery little island in
text: a sea of graffiti. A small group of community leaders waits
text: by the front door while the Presidential limousine pulls up
text: to the curb.
speaker_heading: CLOSER
text: The door pops open as Ellen and Dave step out. He turns and
text: waves to the crowd while she stares straight ahead. Reed
text: hurries up to them.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Okay, it's straight klick and smile
dialog: but there's a great visual in the
dialog: kitchen so make sure you stop at the
dialog: soup.
text: She shoots him a glare as they reach the top of the stairs.
text: Dave nods and they move forward to greet the community leaders.
scene_heading: INT. SHELTER
text: He takes a couple of steps inside, then suddenly stops. The
text: smile fades as his eyes go wide.
speaker_heading: DAVE'S POV
text: It is more a nursery school than a homeless shelter. Twenty
text: to thirty children, most of them black, stand formally
text: assembled in front of the President.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (good at this)
dialog: One of the things they're trying to do
dialog: here at Helping Hand, is keep verbal
dialog: skills alive. The first thing that
dialog: goes with these kids is their ability
dialog: to communicate and they need to get to
dialog: them before this happens.
text: She glances over her shoulder. Dave has wandered forward to
text: the edge of the large rubber mat. Everyone stares, stunned,
text: as he looks at the kids for a moment, then sinks suddenly to
text: his knees.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Hi there.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - PRESS CORPS
text: The cameras surge forward to the side of the play area. The
text: SHUTTERS FIRE WILDLY as Dave glances up at the cardboard cut-
dialog: outs.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: You like cartoons?
text: The kids don't respond. They stare at the crush of reporters
text: and glancing TV lights.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (turning toward the
dialog: cameras)
dialog: Could you just stop that for a second.
text: Everyone freezes. The camera crews back up a step as Dave
text: turns back toward the kids.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (softer)
dialog: You like Tweety Bird?
text: A few of them nod.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - ELLEN
text: She stares in disbelief as her husband sits cross-legged in
text: the middle of the mat. He leans forward, into the children,
text: talking like a kindergarten teacher.
scene_heading: ANGLE - PLAY AREA
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: So, which one do you like?
text: A FOUR-YEAR-OLD tugs gently at his sleeve. He wears donated
text: overalls and a N.Y. Mets T-shirt.
speaker_heading: KID (FOUR-YEAR-OLD)
dialog: (in a lisp)
dialog: Sylvester.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Sylvester?
text: The boy nods.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: But he's a cat.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - REED
text: He beams from ear to ear as the photo-op materializes in front
text: of his eyes. Dave glances over at him, cupping his hand in a
dialog: whisper.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (side of his mouth)
dialog: Gimme a quarter.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: (confused)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Quick. Gimme a quarter.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Reed fishes through his pockets and comes up with a coin. He
text: moves to the mat, slipping it to Dave.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - DAVE
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (leaning forward)
dialog: Okay - - what can run all day without
dialog: getting tired.
text: The kid looks at him, baffled. Dave reaches out slowly and
text: taps the side of his nose. DAVE
speaker_heading: (GENTLY)
dialog: Well, it's not your ear.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: (lighting up)
dialog: My nose?
speaker_heading: ANGLE - ELLEN
text: She watches in amazement as her husband reaches out and
text: "magically" produces a quarter from the side of the child's
text: nose. Dave looks up at her with a smile, and their eyes lock

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: `Bum, bum da dum...'
text: He rinses it out and reaches for the soap. It's a small

speaker_heading: WOMAN

speaker_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: How could you?
text: Dave jumps with a start, then turns away from her quickly,

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ... How could I what?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Oh, come on, Bill. Don't patronize
dialog: me. I'm not one of your little...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Turn around. I'm talking to you!...
dialog: Turnaround!

speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (trembling slightly)
dialog: ... You know, if you want to be the
dialog: same old bastard, that's fine. I can
dialog: handle it. But don't pull

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (frozen; feeling - very

dialog: I don't understand.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: That's not just a works bill you vetoed --
dialog: that would have given these kids

dialog: (losing it a little)
dialog: ... When I think about that little

dialog: and that magic trick...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What's wrong with a magic trick?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: You made their funding disappear!
text: Dave recoils a little.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Look. If there was some mistake...
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (in a rage)
dialog: There's no mistake, Bill. If you
dialog: veto their funding, it's not a mistake.
dialog: If you hurt someone intentionally,
dialog: it's not a mistake.
text: She turns and leaves through the steam disappearing as suddenly

dialog: after her.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (turning to Duane)
dialog: Call Bob and Reed. Tell them I need

speaker_heading: DAVE

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: But we went there. We saw those kids.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yeah. And if you can find a way to cut
scene_heading: THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS

scene_heading: EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

scene_heading: INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: SHOT - DAVE
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: The way I see it we need three hundred

dialog: changes in cash management. For
dialog: example...
text: He leans forward onto the table, reading from his card.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: According to the O.M.B. we have

dialog: (scanning the table)
dialog: Is that true?
scene_heading: DIRECTOR OF O.M.B.
dialog: Uh... I believe so... Yes.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: So even though they're late, we keep
dialog: paying them on time?
scene_heading: DIRECTOR OF O.M.B.
dialog: Well -- in a sense... yeah.
speaker_heading: DAVE

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (smiling quietly)
dialog: Great.
text: He turns back to the table clutching the card in his hand.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Like I was saying, if we took that

speaker_heading: ANGLE-DAVE
speaker_heading: DAVE

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (from a card)
dialog: You're spending forty-three million

dialog: (reading)
dialog: 'Boost consumer confidence in the
dialog: American auto industry.'
scene_heading: SECRETARY OF COMMERCE
dialog: And it's proving quite effective...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Does it make the cars any better?
scene_heading: SECRETARY OF COMMERCE
dialog: No, sir. It's more of a perceptual
dialog: issue.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Perceptual?
scene_heading: SECRETARY OF COMMERCE
dialog: Yes, it's designed to bolster individual
dialog: confidence in a previous domestic
dialog: automotive purchase.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Why?
scene_heading: SECRETARY OF COMMERCE
dialog: Well... to shore up product
dialog: identification and preserve market
dialog: share.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: So we're spending forty-seven million
dialog: dollars to make people feel better
dialog: about a car they've already bought?
scene_heading: SECRETARY OF COMMERCE
dialog: Yes, but I wouldn't...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (indignant)
dialog: Well I'm sure that's really important,

speaker_heading: REED

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What do you mean by that?
speaker_heading: REED

dialog: Just what you think I mean.
speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: DAVE

speaker_heading: DUANE

speaker_heading: DUANE

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh, sure. Don't worry about it.

speaker_heading: DAVE

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (startled)
dialog: Oh... Yeah.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Mind if I sit down?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: No.
text: He scoops up the cards trying to tidy some of the bottles.
text: She studies his face for a couple of seconds then sits down
text: at the table.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: That was quite a thing you did today.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Anybody would have done it.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Oh, I don't think so.
dialog: (staring at him)
dialog: Still, you helped a lot of people.
text: She continues to stare as Dave looks away.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Kind of reminds me of that thing you

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh yeah?

dialog: Me, too.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: You weren't in the state legislature.

speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I'm Ellen Mitchell.
text: His eyes go wide. Dave sits stunned trying his best to
dialog: swallow.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (softly)
dialog: What's your name?
text: Dave stares at her, but no words come out. She leans forward
text: looking right at him.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (evenly)
dialog: Look, I'll make this easy on you. I
dialog: never see him anymore. I barely know
dialog: him anymore. I'd just kinda like to.
dialog: know where he is.
text: Dave looks at her, nervously.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I mean, what is it? Another Secretary?

speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Just open it, please.
speaker_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE
text: The door swings open as a middle-aged woman in a white uniform
text: appears. Even in the dim light of the hallway it's clear she
dialog: is a NURSE.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: I'm sorry, you're not allowed...
speaker_heading: DUANE
dialog: (flashing an I.D.)
dialog: It's alright.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Mr. Alexander left strict...
text: Before she can even finish Ellen steps quickly by her into
text: the room. The Nurse recognizes her and just gapes as Duane
text: and Dave enter as well.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT ROOM
text: It is dimly lit like the hallway, except for a group of
text: machines in the corner. Next to them, a state-of-the-art
text: hospital bed holds the President's lifeless body. Ellen moves
text: up to the side of the bed.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: DUANE
dialog: It's the stroke. It's pretty bad.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I don't understand. Is he, I mean...
text: There's a pause. The Nurse looks down. Ellen clutches the
text: railings of the bed.
speaker_heading: DUANE
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: All at once she starts to cry. Dave moves over to try to
text: comfort her when she shakes him off violently.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Don't touch me, please.
text: Dave recoils. She turns to him with an enraged look in her
text: eye. He moves back a step.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (furious)
dialog: When were you all planning to
dialog: tell me? A year from now? After the
dialog: election...
dialog: (whirling on him)
dialog: What's going on here?
text: Dave hesitates.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: They asked me to help.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I'm sure they did. 'State of
dialog: Emergency.' 'National Security.' You
dialog: ever hear of the Constitution?
text: He doesn't respond. Ellen glares at him for a moment, then
text: glances around the room...
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Could all of you just leave me alone
dialog: for a minute.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: I'm really not supposed to...
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Get out!

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ELLEN'S ROOM - LATER

speaker_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE
text: Dave is standing in the doorway. She looks at him for a
text: moment, but goes right back to packing. He stands in the

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You're leaving?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (clipped)
dialog: I'm not the First Lady, anymore. I

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Home.
text: She grabs a blouse from the bed and flings t into the suitcase.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Where's home?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: Oh, they didn't brief you on that?
dialog: How sloppy of them.
text: She looks at Dave and stops. All at once Ellen stops packing
text: and lowers a shoe to her side.
scene_heading: HER POV - REVERSE ANGLE
text: Dave stands in the doorway with a small valise in his hand.
text: He looks like he did a month ago, with the tortoise shell
text: glasses and his old blue windbreaker. The valise is a tiny
text: overnight bag with small black handles. A seal of the
text: President embossed into the leather.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: Just souvenirs. Towels and stuff.
speaker_heading: ELLEN

speaker_heading: DAVE

speaker_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE
text: Ellen is crying. She shakes her head
text: and turns away from him.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Here.
text: Dave unzips the valise and fishes out a hanky. The
text: Presidential Seal is nicely embroidered in one corner. Ellen
text: looks down at it and smiles slightly.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: You know you make this little deal
dialog: with yourself.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: You can put up with the other women
dialog: and you can do without a life because
dialog: you believe in what you're doing - -
dialog: and if you can just keep your mouth
dialog: shut...
text: She can't finish.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You thought you had a chance to help
dialog: people...
text: Their eyes lock for an instant when she turns and goes back
dialog: to packing.
speaker_heading: DAVE

dialog: How were you gonna get home?
speaker_heading: ELLEN

speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: You sure this goes somewhere?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Truman used it all the time.
text: Dave pauses and shines the light up a leaky old set of stairs
text: that head off to their right. Ellen hesitates for a moment,
text: looking up the staircase.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: You don't have to keep walking with
dialog: me. I'm okay from here.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I don't mind.

speaker_heading: DAVE

speaker_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (handing them to her)
dialog: Here you go.
text: Ellen looks down at the car keys.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: He said he'll pick it up in a couple

speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Oh... Okay.

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: It's just so strange...

speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I lock at you and I see Bill...

dialog: I mean, he's almost dead, but he's
dialog: right here... I mean, you're right
dialog: here... alive and...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I'm not Bill Mitchell.
text: She looks at him.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: In fact, I'm not anything like him
dialog: and... I guess I want you to know that.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: He wasn't always like that, anyway.
text: Their eyes lock for a second.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (suddenly)

speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAVE

speaker_heading: ELLEN (O.S.)

dialog: This is good. What's in it?
speaker_heading: CLOSER SHOT
text: They sit side by side on a raised, grassy mound at the base

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: That's a secret.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (taking another bite)

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I guess.
scene_heading: AFTER A BEAT:
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: When did you know?... About me.
text: She pauses.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I think in the car.

speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: The car?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
text: On the way to the homeless shelter.
dialog: You looked at my leg.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Bill lost interest a long time ago.
text: He turns and looks at her.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: That's good. I was worried it was the
dialog: shower.
text: She smiles. They are perched on a small hill overlooking the
dialog: White House.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: So what do you do the rest of the time?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: You mean when I'm not running the

speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I run a temp agency.

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You know, secretaries and stiff.
speaker_heading: ELLEN

dialog: You find people jobs?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yeah. Is that funny?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: It's just more than anybody else does
dialog: around here.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Well don't get carried away --
dialog: I'm not that good at it.
text: She turns and studies him for a moment.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (suddenly personal)
dialog: And your family? I assume you're
dialog: married?
text: He turns back to her. A couple of seconds go by.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I was... once.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: It didn't take.
text: Ellen laughs and looks out over the mall. Dave takes another
text: swig of his soda.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't
dialog: it? I can't keep all of this a secret.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: But you could go to jail for it.
text: He turns and looks at her. There doesn't seem to be any
dialog: fear.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yeah, I know.
text: Ellen turns and studies him.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I liked doing it, though. Not the
dialog: fancy stuff with the helicopter or the
dialog: TV cameras but...
speaker_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE
text: Ellen keeps staring at him. Dave glances back.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I liked saving that shelter. I liked
dialog: helping people I hadn't even met before.
text: It's quiet for a moment. He stares back at the White House.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (pause)
dialog: And right then I felt like I wasn't
dialog: pretending anymore.
speaker_heading: CLOSER
text: Several seconds go by. Dave stares off at the White House
text: across the mall while Ellen studies his face.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I don't think you were pretending.
text: Dave turns to her as their eyes lock.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I liked being married to you.
text: Ellen turns all the way around on the blanket staring at him
text: from less than a foot away.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: What would you do if you were still in

dialog: you were alone - -
text: Ellen turns toward Bob with a sudden grin. His expression
text: falls visibly as the weight of their alliance becomes clear.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I'd like your resignation on my desk
dialog: by the time I get back.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - BOB
text: He looks at them stunned and defeated...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PRESS ROOM - LATER
text: It is packed to capacity. Dave stands alone at the podium
text: while the press corps crowds every inch of the Briefing Room.
text: He stares squarely into the cameras.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Thanks for coming on such short notice.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Reed stands off to the side with an
text: almost mesmerized look on his face.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: First, I'd like to announce something
dialog: that might come as a surprise to many
dialog: of you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I've asked Bob Alexander to resign as
dialog: White House Chief of Staff.
text: A murmur goes through the Press Room. Dave looks straight
dialog: ahead.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Sometimes, two people just change and
dialog: it's better for everybody if they go
dialog: their Own way.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Over the last few months! Bob and I
dialog: have come to believe in different
dialog: things. He thinks this country is
dialog: fine and we should go about doing
dialog: business as usual.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I just don't feel that way. Not
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Because things aren't fine. And you
dialog: know that and I know that. And we can
dialog: keep lying to ourselves, but it's a
dialog: little late for that.
dialog: (getting angry)
dialog: We've got water we can't drink and air
dialog: we can't breathe. We've got bars on.
dialog: our windows and graffiti on our doors.
dialog: If you get sick you can't afford to go
dialog: to the doctor and if you get laid off
dialog: you can't find a new job. We're
dialog: trillions of dollar in debt. Our roads
dialog: are cracking, our bridges are crumbling
dialog: and everything we used to build is
dialog: made in Japan. We've got people
dialog: sleeping in cardboard boxes, and ten-
text: year-old kids who are doing drugs.
dialog: We've been living together for four
dialog: hundred years, and we're still trying
dialog: to kill each other... But that isn't
dialog: even the worst part. The worst part
dialog: is we feel like we can't do anything
dialog: about it.
speaker_heading: CLOSER
text: He looks out over the room and pauses.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: So I've decided that while I'm
dialog: President, I should actually try to
dialog: do things... even if they seem
dialog: impossible.
text: Dave glances toward the wings for a moment and turns back.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: First off I'm initiating a program to
dialog: try to find a decent job for every
dialog: American who wants one.
text: A murmur moves through the press room.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (hearing them)
dialog: Why start here?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Because if you've ever seen the look
dialog: on someone's face the day they get a
dialog: job -- I've had some personal experience
dialog: with this - - they look like they could
dialog: fly. And unless we start tapping into
dialog: that kind of spirit again, there's no
dialog: way we're gonna fix anything in this
dialog: country.
text: He looks out at them and pauses.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: So... Let's get to work.
scene_heading: WIDE ANGLE - BRIEFING
text: The press corps just sits stunned for a moment as Dave strides
text: off the stage. As he leaves, the stunned reporters explode
text: to their feet.
speaker_heading: REPORTERS
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Mr. President... Mr. President...
scene_heading: INT. BRIEFING ROOM - CORRIDOR
text: Dave enters the corridor and sees Ellen, who is waiting for
text: him with a huge look of admiration on her face.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: It was okay?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (beaming)
dialog: It was inspirational.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WHITE HOUSE LAWN - NINA TOTENBERG ("NBC NIGHTLY NEWS")
speaker_heading: NINA TOTENBERG
dialog: In the boldest initiative yet of the

dialog: since the days of F.D.R.
speaker_heading: QUICK CUT
dialog: TO:
scene_heading: ROBERT NOVACK (EVANS AND NOVACK)

speaker_heading: MATHEWS (V.0.)
dialog: ... It's courageous, it's challenging,
dialog: it's visionary...

speaker_heading: BARNES (V.0.)
dialog: It's insane.
speaker_heading: MARK SHIELDS (CNN)
speaker_heading: MARK SHIELDS (V.0.)
dialog: It's brilliant.
speaker_heading: JOHN McLAUGHLIN ("CROSSFIRE")
speaker_heading: JOHN MCLAUGHLIN (V.0.)
dialog: If the President wants to run around
text: proposing lame-brained schemes like
dialog: this one...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL KINSELY (ALSO "CROSSFIRE")
speaker_heading: MICHAEL KINSELY (V.0.)
dialog: Well he's certainly got my vote.
text: The TELEVISION SUDDENLY SWITCHES OFF as the CAMERA WIDENS OUT
dialog: to reveal:
scene_heading: INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Dave, slumping back from the TV into an armchair.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Thank God for that.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Dave, Ellen, Reed, Ellen's Aide, and two other advisors are
text: camped in front of the television set. There are documents
text: and newspapers scattered over the room. A take-out pizza
text: sits incongruously on the coffee table.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Let's call it a night. I can't take
dialog: any more.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Right. We can pick up on the rest
dialog: tomorrow.
text: Everyone starts to get up, gathering their papers.
speaker_heading: ELLEN'S AIDE
dialog: (moving toward
dialog: the door)
dialog: I'll have those employment figures to
dialog: you by eight-thirty...
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: And we've got that labor briefing at
dialog: nine.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (bleary eyed)
dialog: Terrific.
text: Everyone starts to move through the door, leaving Dave and
text: Ellen suddenly alone. They are standing face to face.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Well I guess...
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Yeah... Bedtime.
text: Their faces are very close. Their eyes express great need.
text: He moves slowly toward her in a kiss. Their lips meet for an
dialog: instant.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (pulling back)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: I know. I'm sorry...
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I mean, I want to... I just, I feel
dialog: strange...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (even quicker)
dialog: That's okay.
text: They stand there facing one another like two kids on a front
dialog: porch.
scene_heading: INT. DAVE'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: He lies under the covers staring at the ceiling. Dave suddenly
text: turns and punches the pillow.
scene_heading: INT. ELLEN'S ROOM
text: She lies on her bed in exactly the same position. After a
text: moment, Ellen turns and buries her face in the pillow.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (muffled)
dialog: This is crazy...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - WEST WING - DAY
text: Dave and Duane move down the corridor that leads to the Oval
text: Office. Duane is flipping through a handful of newspapers.
speaker_heading: DUANE
dialog: The U.S. News hammered us. But they're
dialog: always tough on that kind of thing.
dialog: Rosenthal loved us in the Times
speaker_heading: RANDI
text: Mr. President, Mr. Nance is waiting
dialog: inside for you.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: DUANE
dialog: (freezing)
dialog: The Vice-President...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh... right...
dialog: (to Randi, nervous
dialog: smile)
dialog: You know, ever since the stroke...
text: Dave points to his temple and gives the "wobbly" sign with
text: his hand. He glances at Duane for a second, then turns and
text: heads inside...
scene_heading: INT. OVAL OFFICE
text: Seated, with his back to the door, is the silhouette of a
text: man holding an eight-foot spear. Beside him on the floor is
text: a large ceremonial headdress. Dave moves forward cautiously.
speaker_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE
text: The Vice President turns and slowly rises to face him. He's
text: a strong-looking man in a plain gray suit with an honest
text: looking face.
speaker_heading: NANCE
dialog: Mr. President.
text: The two men shake hands. Nance continues to stare at him
text: while Dave moves toward his chair. After a moment, Nance
text: extends the headdress.
speaker_heading: NANCE
dialog: (curtly)
dialog: This is from the people of Burundi...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (taking it)
dialog: Oh... Thanks.
speaker_heading: NANCE
dialog: And these are a gift from the King
dialog: of To go.
text: Nance hands him what appears to be a group of large necklaces.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What are they?
speaker_heading: NANCE
dialog: (deadpan)
dialog: Fertility beads.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Ah.
text: He sets them quickly on the desk while Nance just stares at
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: NANCE
dialog: Mr. President, may I speak frankly
dialog: with you?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Certainly.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - NANCE
text: He hesitates for a moment. Nance
text: gathers his thoughts,then proceeds.
speaker_heading: NANCE
dialog: (with dignity)
dialog: I know we haven't always gotten along.
dialog: I know we've disagreed politically
dialog: and I suppose I know what you think
dialog: of me personally...
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Nance takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: NANCE
dialog: ... But I've always tried to respect
dialog: the role you wanted me to play.
dialog: When I've disagreed with this
dialog: administration I've kept it to myself.
dialog: When you wanted my support you always
dialog: had it.
text: Dave nods, frozen in his chair. Nance looks at him a moment
text: then suddenly lets it out.
speaker_heading: NANCE
dialog: Dammit, Bill -- how could you do
dialog: something like this to me?
dialog: 
text: Dave just looks at him speechless. Neither man moves.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Something like what...
speaker_heading: NANCE
dialog: Oh, come on, we're not children. I
dialog: didn't have anything to do with this
dialog: Fidelity nonsense and you know it.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: The Fidelity nonsense...
speaker_heading: NANCE
dialog: (showing him a newspaper)
dialog: All I've got is my integrity. That's
dialog: all I have. Now I don't know why you
dialog: turned your attack dogs on me.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: They re not my attack dogs.
speaker_heading: NANCE
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I just fired Bob Alexander.
text: Nance looks at him, stunned.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Don't worry. I'll take care of it.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. REED'S OFFICE - DAY
text: He sits behind his sleek Italian desk with a slightly sheepish
text: look on his face. Dave stands across from him, leaning on his
dialog: feet.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What do you mean you made it all up?
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir
dialog: boy.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: This is wrong, Alan!
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: (like a novel, new
dialog: concept)
dialog: Wrong...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Alan...
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Oh, I know, I know... It looks
dialog: awfully bad. It's really embarrassing.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But it was Bob's idea.
text: Dave looks at him horrified.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: We've got to fix this.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Absolutely. Well, that might be kind
text: of tough. Once the press starts smelling
dialog: blood...
text: The door blows open behind them.
speaker_heading: ELLEN (O.S.)
dialog: Dave...
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: She flies into the room with a worried
text: look on her face. Dave and Reed watch
text: while she heads toward the "media
dialog: center" in the corner.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: `Dave'?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: She knows.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Look at this.
text: Ellen flicks ON the SET to catch a NEWS REPORT in mid-segment.
speaker_heading: TV SCREEN
speaker_heading: NINA TOTENBERG (V.0.)
dialog: (over TV)
dialog: ... The hastily called news conference
dialog: at the National Press Club was Bob
dialog: Alexander's first public comment
dialog: since resigning as White House Chief
dialog: of Staff. It turned out to be nothing
text: short of a full-fledged salvo fired
text: directly at Pennsylvania Avenue.
text: Bob appears in a film clip, speaking before the National
text: Press Club. Even beneath the professional cool, he seems
text: to relish the lethal sound bite.
speaker_heading: BOB (V.0.)
dialog: (over TV)
dialog: When I first began to look into the
dialog: allegations concerning Fidelity
dialog: Savings and Loan, I thought the
dialog: wrongdoing was restricted to the
dialog: Vice President's office...
scene_heading: INT. REED'S OFFICE - DAY
text: They glance at each other then back at the set...
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Uh-oh...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (over TV)
dialog: ... But as I began to investigate, I
dialog: realized that this pattern of
dialog: corruption extended much higher...
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Jesus...
speaker_heading: TV SCREEN
text: Bob pauses for an effect, then looks
text: straight into the camera:
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (over TV; dramatic)
dialog: ... I was saddened to discover at
dialog: least fifteen separate acts of
dialog: intervention by this administration,
dialog: most with the full knowledge of the
dialog: President and all of them illegal.
dialog: Federal regulators were influenced,
dialog: records were destroyed, and pressure
dialog: was brought to bear, in same cases
dialog: by President Mitchell himself.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: Now he's making stuff up about me.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: He's not.
text: They turn and look at him.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: He's not making it up.
text: Dave stares at him stunned. Ellen gets it immediately.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Bob never left Bill's side. He knows
dialog: where all the old bones are buried...
text: Dave glances back and forth between them but neither one of
dialog: them speaks...
scene_heading: EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY
text: A long line of black sedans with congressional plates pulls
text: up to the South Portico. In the distance, beyond the fence,
text: a crowd of protesters shout at the White House.
scene_heading: INT. PRESIDENT'S PRIVATE DINING ROOM
text: A small delegation of congressional leaders has requested a
text: lunch with the President. Reed and Ellen are also present.
text: The SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE leans forward over his plate.
speaker_heading: SPEAKER
dialog: (a Southerner)
dialog: Mr. President, I don't know another
dialog: way to put it, but 'This dawg just
dialog: won't hunt.'
text: Dave just stares at him without responding.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJ. LEADER
dialog: We may be able to hold off this First
dialog: Liberty thing for a little while1 but
dialog: if you go running around the country
dialog: with this new jobs idea...
speaker_heading: SPEAKER
dialog: They're gonna put us on a spit an'
dialog: bring in the sauce.
speaker_heading: FEMALE SENATOR
dialog: If you just waited for a little while...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I don't want to wait for a little while.
speaker_heading: SPEAKER
dialog: Mr. President, I understand that. But
dialog: sometimes ya fight an' sometimes ya
dialog: run.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (suddenly)
dialog: That's not what you said during your
dialog: ethics investigation.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Every eye in the room turns toward
text: her. The Speaker stares daggers across
dialog: the table.
speaker_heading: SPEAKER
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: When you needed the President's help,
dialog: you got it.
speaker_heading: SPEAKER
dialog: (controlled)
dialog: Ma'am, no one appreciates your husband's
dialog: help more'n me. I'm just saying that
dialog: this jobs thing is a little unwieldy...'
speaker_heading: NANCE
dialog: (chiming in)
dialog: It is not.
text: Every eye shifts to the Vice President.
dialog: Ill.
speaker_heading: NANCE
dialog: There's lots of ways to make it work.
dialog: You could have targeted tax credits
dialog: for on-site training... You could
dialog: have a public private partnership like -
dialog: J.T.P.A...
speaker_heading: SPEAKER
dialog: Excuse me for interruptin' but this
dialog: ain't some city council silliness that's
dialog: gonna blow over. We're talking about
text: obstructing federal regulators and
dialog: violating election up on the Hill who
dialog: are talkin' impeachment. We got a real
dialog: problem on our hands.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - DAVE
text: He just stares straight ahead...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - BOB ALEXANDER
text: It is a video clip from his lethal press conference. Bob
text: faces the camera directly.
speaker_heading: BOB (V.0.)
dialog: ... At least fifteen separate acts

dialog: knowledge of the President..
speaker_heading: NANCE (0.S.)
dialog: Guess they're coming at you now,
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: FREEZE FRAME.
scene_heading: INT. OVAL OFFICE
text: Dave sits in front of his bookcase with a remote control in
text: his hand. He turns to see the Vice President, standing by
text: the edge of the carpet.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh... Hi.
speaker_heading: NANCE
dialog: (glancing at the screen)
dialog: Dirty business we're in sometimes.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: NANCE
dialog: He's not gonna win -- not in the
dialog: end... They never do.
text: Dave looks back at him.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ... Sometimes they do.
speaker_heading: NANCE
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Yeah... Sometimes they do.
text: Nance shifts a little by the bookcase.
speaker_heading: NANCE
dialog: Mr. President, whatever happens I
dialog: just wanted you to know that I think
dialog: that your jobs program is a wonderful
dialog: idea...
speaker_heading: DAVE,
dialog: Not that anyone's gonna pay much
dialog: attention now... But thanks.
text: Neither one says anything. Dave motions to a chair.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Want to sit down?
text: He takes a seat across from the desk. Nance glances over
text: at the TV as both men look at the freeze frame of Bob.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You ever think back to how you
dialog: started.
speaker_heading: NANCE
dialog: (turning)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You know. Your first campaign.
dialog: You ever think back to how you did it all...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NANCE
dialog: Yeah...
dialog: (thinks about it for a
dialog: moment...)
dialog: .. I was a shoe salesman.
dialog: (beat)
text: and not very happy about it.
text: They smile together for a moment.
speaker_heading: NANCE
dialog: One day my wife says to me 'Why don't
dialog: you try running for office. You talk
dialog: about it all the time, why don't you
dialog: just do it?'
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So I tell my boss I have a dentist
dialog: appointment and I go down to the
dialog: registrar of voters on my lunch break.
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: Next thing I know, I'm a councilman.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: NANCE
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: My wife was my campaign manager. We
dialog: had a two thousand dollar budget.
text: Dave smiles.
speaker_heading: NANCE
dialog: With advertising.
text: Dave just looks at him for a long moment.
speaker_heading: NANCE
dialog: How'd you get started?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Oh... Kinda the same way.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WEST WING - DUSK
text: Dave walks alone down the long pergola that flanks the Rose
text: Garden. He moves slowly, lost in thought, when he glances up
text: and suddenly, stops.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: All the roses are shimmering in the late afternoon light.
text: Dave looks at them for a second...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING QUARTERS - MAIN HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: The CAMERA MOVES WITH Dave as he heads down the long corridor
text: toward Ellen's side of the living quarters. He holds a large
text: yellow rose in his hand. Dave pauses in front of her door,
text: knocks and waits for a moment.
speaker_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE
text: Dave steps inside the room.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: It's a lively room, especially for the White House. Across
text: the room one of the French doors is open wide. The curtains
text: billow out to the terrace beyond.
scene_heading: EXT. TERRACE
text: Dave steps outside, and looks around. It's a beautiful, warm
text: night. The Washington Monument soars in the distance with the
text: Jefferson Memorial just a speck beyond. Dave hears SOMETHING
text: in the distance.
speaker_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE
text: He rounds the corner to find Ellen standing all alone by the
text: edge of the balustrade. He moves quietly up toward the railing
text: as she turns and looks at him. He extends the rose, holding
dialog: it out.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I brought you something.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: 
dialog: (reserved)
dialog: ... Thanks.
speaker_heading: CLOSER ANGLE
text: It's only half a smile. He moves closer and pauses.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: Looks like we're not going to get a
dialog: chance to get much done.
text: Dave thinks about it and nods.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (softer)
dialog: They're crucifying you out there.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yeah, but we got a little bit done.
dialog: And if you do a little and I do a
dialog: little... then maybe the next
dialog: guy'll do a little...
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: You really believe that?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (pauses, quieter)
dialog: And it's better than not believing it
text: Their faces are inches apart.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (softly)
dialog: I sure fall for some weird guys.
text: Slowly, almost imperceptibly, they come together in a kiss.
text: It's soft and tender at first -- then builds in passion and
dialog: need.
text: A lone CHURCH BELL from the National Cathedral starts CHIMING
dialog: at midnight.
speaker_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE
text: Dave and Ellen part, drawn by the sound. After a moment,
text: Dave looks slowly back at her.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Nance is a good man, isn't he?
text: She just looks at him. It's a strange expression -- part
dialog: sadness, part fear, part intrigue...
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (swallowing)
dialog: Yeah. He's a good man.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: What?
text: She shakes her head. He touches the side of her face.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I'm just getting to know you -- I don't
dialog: want to lose you.
text: They come together and kiss again. Even with everything left
text: unsaid, there's a sadness in the air.
text: WIDENING OUT...
text: Two small figures cling onto each other by the third floor
text: balustrade of the White House...
speaker_heading: SLOWLY
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CAPITOL DOME - DAY

scene_heading: INT. HOUSE CHAMBER

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM (GEORGETOWN) - DAY

text: inside the beltway fat cats mill about the living room while
dialog: Vanocur continues on the TV:
speaker_heading: SANDER VANOCUR (V.0.)
dialog: Speculation on the President's response
text: has run the gamut from a full-fledged
dialog: denial right up to the possibility
dialog: that he might resign.
text: There are hoots and hollers in the room. One of the GUESTS
text: raises a glass in salute.
speaker_heading: GUEST #1
dialog: (to Bob)
dialog: Here's to you, Mr. President.
text: Another guest holds up a bumper sticker with "ALEXANDER FOR

speaker_heading: BOB

dialog: of the President.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES - CLOAK ROOM
text: THROUGH a crack in the doorway, most of the House Chamber is
text: visible. The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal: Dave and Reed,
text: standing alone in the small ante-room. There is a plain,
text: black briefcase sitting between them.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Is everything clear with Duane?
text: Reed nods and hands him the briefcase.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: And this is all of it?
text: He nods again.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Well -- here we go.
text: Dave tries to take briefcase but Reed keeps holding onto it
text: out of reflex and self-preservation. Dave smiles at him and
text: gently starts to unpry Reed's fingers.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Relax, Alan... Enjoy the moment.
text: Reed looks at him and tries to nod...
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE CHAMBER
text: Everyone stands at their seats when the SERGEANT AT ARMS walks

speaker_heading: SERGEANT AT ARMS
dialog: Mr. Speaker... The President of the
dialog: United States.
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
text: The response is more of a murmur than
text: the usual applause. Dave appears at
text: the back of the Chamber carrying the
text: black briefcase. He makes his way up
text: the aisle and mounts the five steps
text: that lead to the podium.
speaker_heading: SHOT - DAVE
text: He reaches the lectern and glances
text: behind him. Dave locks eyes with Vice
text: President Nance for a moment, flashing
text: him a smile.
scene_heading: INT. BOB'S TOWN HOUSE
text: It looks like a Superbowl party. All of Bob's cronies have
text: gathered around the TV set to watch "Bill Mitchell's" political
text: demise. A huge grin spreads across Bob's face when Dave's
text: image appears on the screen.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Shhh shh... Here it comes.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE CHAMBER
text: Dave swallows once and grips the lectern.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I wish I could be here today under
dialog: different circumstances...
speaker_heading: CLOSER SHOT
text: He hesitates for a moment.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: There's certainly a lot of things about
dialog: this country that we should be
dialog: discussing, but I realize that's not
dialog: possible now.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: As all of you know, my former Chief of
dialog: Staff has implicated me in a scandal
dialog: involving Fidelity Savings and Loan.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE - HOUSE
text: Every member sits motionless at their seat.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ... And once people start talking about
dialog: scandal it's hard for them to talk
dialog: about anything else.
text: He scans the room.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: So fine. Let's talk about it.
scene_heading: INT. ELLEN'S BEDROOM
text: She watches riveted from the edge of her bed.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (over TV)
dialog: Bob Alexander has accused me of...
dialog: (pulls some notes out
dialog: of his pocket)
dialog: Let me read this to make sure I get it
dialog: right...
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE CHAMBER
text: He stares at his notes.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: .... Illegally influencing government
dialog: regulators on behalf of major campaign
dialog: contributors -- interfering with an
dialog: ongoing Justice Department investigation - -
dialog: and violating Federal election laws in
dialog: the area of campaign finance.
text: There isn't a sound in the Chamber.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Okay -- let's get right to the guts of
dialog: it... Each one of these charges is
dialog: absolutely true.
text: A quiet but shocked murmur rolls through the room.
scene_heading: INT. BOB'S HOUSE
text: A "war hoop" goes up from the guests. Bob almost seems to
text: levitate off the couch.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Die, you pond scum!
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE CHAMBER - FULL SHOT - DAVE
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I'm the President and as they say 'The
dialog: buck stops here.' So I take full
dialog: responsibility for every one of my
dialog: illegal acts.
text: He hoists the black briefcase up onto the podium.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: But you see that's not the whole story,
dialog: and I think each one of you is entitled
dialog: to the truth.
text: Dave opens the black briefcase to reveal a large stack of
dialog: documents.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I have written proof here in the form
dialog: of...
dialog: (reading)
dialog: Notes, memoranda and personal
dialog: directives' proving that Bob Alexander
dialog: was involved in each one of these
dialog: incidents and in most cases planned
dialog: them as well...
scene_heading: INT. BOB'S HOUSE - CLOSEUP - BOB
text: There is silence in the room. All the color drains from his
text: face as Bob stares frozen at the television set. The others
text: in the room watch with the morbid fascination of someone
text: witnessing a car wreck.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (almost a gasp)
dialog: Alan...
text: One of the guests furtively slides his Presidential bumper
text: sticker behind the onion dip.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE CHAMBER - FULL SHOT - REED
text: He stares out at the House Chamber feeling downright "moral."
text: He looks like someone who has just saved a puppy.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - DAVE
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Now - - allegations of wrong-doing
dialog: have also been made against Vice
dialog: President Nance...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'm afraid that's just a lie.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - VICE PRESIDENT
text: He sits motionless in the chair feeling the weight of every
text: eye in the room.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ... As this evidence will show... At
dialog: no time and in no way was Vice President
dialog: Nance involved in any of this affair.
dialog: Bob made all of that up.
text: Dave turns and smiles at Nance for a moment.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - PODIUM
text: Dave turns back toward the House.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Vice president Nance is a good and
dialog: decent public servant and I'd like to
dialog: apologize for any pain this may have
dialog: caused him or his family.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: And while we're setting the record
dialog: straight, I'd also like to apologize
dialog: to the American people...
speaker_heading: CLOSER ON DAVE
text: Right INTO CAMERA.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ... I forgot that I was hired to do a
dialog: job for you and that it was just a
dialog: temp job at that. I forgot that I had
dialog: two hundred and fifty million people
dialog: who were paying me to make their lives
dialog: a little better and I didn't live up
dialog: to my part of the bargain.
scene_heading: WIDER - HOUSE CHAMBER
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: See, there are certain things you should
dialog: expect from a President. I ought to
dialog: care more about you than I do about
dialog: me... I ought to care more about what's
dialog: right than I do about what's popular...
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE - HOUSE CHAMBER
text: They sit motionless in their seats.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I ought to be willing to give this
dialog: whole thing up for something I believe
dialog: in...
scene_heading: INT. ELLEN'S ROOM
text: A sad but proud smile starts around the corners of her mouth.
speaker_heading: DAVE (V.0.)
dialog: (on her TV)
dialog: Because if I'm not...
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE CHAMBER
text: Dave clutches the sides of the podium.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: If I'm not...
text: Dave stops in mid-sentence. He raises his hand to his forehead
text: and seems to rock a moment. A concerned murmur runs through
text: the floor of the House.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - DAVE
text: He clutches the lectern now with a "woozy" look on his face.
text: He "fights to stand up."
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: If I'm not... Then I don't belong here
dialog: in the first place...
text: All at once, Dave falls to the floor. Duane and Reed and
text: several Senate pages suddenly rush out to his side.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE CHAMBER - PODIUM
text: It is complete pandemonium. Several members crowd around
text: the podium. The NOISE LEVEL literally turns into a ROAR.
text: Reed yanks at Dave's shirt and loosens his tie.
speaker_heading: CLOSER ANGLE
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: A doctor! We need a doctor... He's
dialog: had a stroke!
scene_heading: INT. ELLEN'S BEDROOM
text: She gets up from the bed, grabs her overcoat and heads for
dialog: the door...
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE CHAMBER
text: A huge crowd of Congressmen crowd around the platform. There
dialog: is complete confusion...
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES - PARKING LOT - DAY
dialog: The standard issue ambulance that follows the President I
text: everywhere is parked just outside the House doors. The doors
text: of the vehicle fly open as a doctor and nurse emerge. They're
text: the same two people who cared for Bill Mitchell at the outset
dialog: of the film.
speaker_heading: CLOSER ANGLE
text: It takes a split second for them to whisk out the gurney bed
text: and slam the doors behind them. They bolt toward the House
text: chamber while the Secret Service stands guard.
scene_heading: INT. CHAMBER
text: Duane and other Secret Servicemen move the onlookers back as
text: the medical team loads Dave onto the gurney bed and hurry him
text: toward the doors.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE PARKING LOT
text: They emerge a moment or two later with Duane leading the way.
text: Dave has been securely fastened to the rolling stretcher while
text: the doctor and nurse hover close...
speaker_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE
text: They pop the door of the ambulance. A
text: crowd of onlookers watches in horror
text: as the body of the President is whisked
text: into the ambulance.
scene_heading: WIDE ANGLE - MOTORCADE
text: It tears away from the Capitol with dozens of SIRENS BLARING.
text: The ambulance is surrounded front and back by twenty police
text: motorcycles and the entire entourage takes off...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL - DAY
text: It is pandemonium here as well. A huge stat team waits for
text: the AMBULANCE as it comes SCREAMING up to the emergency
text: entrance at the back of the hospital. They fling the doors
text: of the ambulance open as they remove the near S lifeless body
dialog: of the President...
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - GURNEY
text: MOVING WITH it. The Secret Service pushes back the mob of
text: photographers as the doctors whisk the stretcher toward the
dialog: hospital.
scene_heading: INT. AMBULANCE
text: Duane sits quietly behind the wheel, while the commotion
text: continues behind the vehicle...
text: THE CAMERA PANS SLOWLY OVER to the passenger's side, REVEALING:
speaker_heading: DAVE
text: He sits in a white paramedics outfit complete with hat and
text: name plate. Dave is wearing his glasses once again and looking
text: decidedly unpresidential. He glances over at Duane.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Well...
speaker_heading: DUANE
dialog: Well...
text: After a beat.
speaker_heading: DUANE
dialog: You sure you don't want a lift back
dialog: home?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No thanks. It's not that far.
text: The two men shake hands and Dave reaches for the door. He
text: holds the same souvenir bag he had on his evening out with
dialog: Ellen.
speaker_heading: DUANE
dialog: Dave...
text: He pauses and looks back.
speaker_heading: DUANE
dialog: (moved)
dialog: I would have taken a bullet for I
dialog: you, Dave.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Thanks, Duane.
text: Dave smiles at his friend, then climbs out of the ambulance,
text: and heads down the street...
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ENTRANCE - DIFFERENT ANGLE
text: A LIMOUSINE comes SCREECHING up to the curb. The door flies
text: open and Ellen gets out. She sees the huge crowd of people
text: at the back of the hospital then looks around the parking
text: lot. Finally she sees:
speaker_heading: HER POV
text: There, in the distance, the figure of a lone man in a
text: paramedics uniform walking slowly away. He carries a small
text: black valise in his hand.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - ELLEN
text: A strange composure envelopes her as she makes a silent
text: decision. She takes one last look at Dave's receding figure,
text: then turns and runs quickly inside the hospital...
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
text: The CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL SLOWLY BACK REVEALING the ambulance,
text: the hospital and the huge crush of vehicles surrounding the
text: back door.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.0.)
dialog: ... The stroke hit at 8:42 p.m. just
dialog: as the President was concluding his
text: remarks to a joint session of Congress.
text: Spokesmen at Bethesda Naval Hospital
dialog: confirm that it was a `massive edema'
dialog: and unlike his previous stroke, it has
dialog: rendered the President totally
dialog: incapacitated...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: ... Vice President Nance has already
dialog: been conferred with full executive
dialog: authority and has assumed the Presidency
dialog: in accordance with the 24th Amendment.
dialog: This is the first time since...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BALTIMORE SKYLINE - ESTABLISHING - DAY
text: It is still autumn. The sound of the ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
text: dissolves into the Vice President's as he continues in V.0.
speaker_heading: NANCE (V.0.)
dialog: ... I plan to continue Bill Mitchell's
dialog: call to arms. This isn't my Presidency --
dialog: this is his Presidency and I can't
dialog: think of a better legacy for him to
dialog: leave than...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN BALTIMORE - DAY (WINTER)
text: The autumn leaves are all gone now and the SNOW has started
text: to fall. Christmas decorations hang from lampposts and a
text: Salvation Army Santa is ringing his bell.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER #3 (V.0.)
dialog: ... Bob Alexander and eight other
dialog: members of the Mitchell Administration
dialog: were indicted on thirty-four counts of
dialog: election law violations and obstruction
dialog: of justice. Ironically, the indictments

dialog: a comprehensive employment program,
dialog: designed to...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. KOVIC TEMPS - DAY
text: Snow is falling gently in the street. The CAMERA BEGINS TO
text: PUSH IN SLOWLY ON the first floor window. Jerry (Alice's
text: boyfriend) is hanging a large sign in the window that reads:
scene_heading: "KOVIC FOR ALDERMAN"
scene_heading: INT. KOVIC TEMPS
text: The place is just as busy as before. Alice frantically works
text: the phones while three or four women cram the waiting area.
text: Murray supervises a couple of campaign workers including Lola
text: from the start of the film. They stuff envelopes and wear
text: large "KOVIC" hats on their heads.
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: (to one of the workers)
dialog: No. Fold them the long way. It looks
dialog: neater.
scene_heading: ANGLE - DAVE'S INNER OFFICE
text: He works the phone, hunched over his desk.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (into the receiver)
dialog: What do you mean, Harry, this woman's
dialog: fabulous...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Oh no, that was a different one...
dialog: (longer beat)
dialog: Well she's changed a lot...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Come on, Harry, it's Christmas, the
dialog: woman needs a job.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Well, sure... she can wrap presents...
dialog: Yeah you bet... Oh, great.
text: He pauses for a beat.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Harry, did you get that fund-raising
dialog: thing I sent you?
scene_heading: ANGLE - DOORWAY/RECEPTION AREA
text: It jars open as a woman steps inside. Alice barely looks up
text: as the woman, wearing dark glasses and a scarf, moves into
text: the waiting area.
speaker_heading: CLOSER SHOT
text: Despite the blue jeans and T-shirt, she looks quite familiar.
dialog: It's Ellen.
speaker_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE
text: Dave moves into the reception area with a huge smile on his
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yes! We're on a roll now...
text: All the women smile up at him.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: It's Christmas time...
speaker_heading: DAVE I MURRAY
dialog: (a catch phrase)
dialog: .... and everybody works at
dialog: Christmas time...'
text: All of a sudden they stop. Dave looks across the reception
text: area and sees Ellen by the door.
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: She takes off her dark glasses and stares at him. Neither
text: one of them says a word as Dave moves slowly forward with a
text: stunned look on his face. She smiles at him.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (indicating her wardrobe))
dialog: Thought I needed a little change. You
dialog: like it?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: It's nice.
text: He moves a little closer. They stand face to face.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I saw you on T.V... at his funeral.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (past it now)
dialog: Yeah, well... It's finally over.
text: They are inches apart. Dave notices Murray and the six other
text: women staring at them in the waiting area.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: C'mere.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DAVE'S PRIVATE OFFICE
text: Murray stares as he pulls her into his private office and
text: shuts the door. Ellen throws her arms around his neck as
text: their lips meet in a passionate kiss...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (kissing)
dialog: I never thought I'd...
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (kissing back)
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (kissing again)
dialog: I missed...
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (kiss)
dialog: ... Me, too.
text: She pulls back and looks at him.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So this is it?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ... Not exactly the Oval Office.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Oh... I lived with a President. It
dialog: isn't any fun.
text: Dave gazes into her eyes.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (softer)
dialog: It could be fun.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Yeah... It could be fun.
text: They come together in another kiss. Ellen drops her handbag
text: to the floor, as the CAMERA WIDENS OUT ON the bustle of the
text: busy office... Outside on the busy Baltimore street... As we

speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
