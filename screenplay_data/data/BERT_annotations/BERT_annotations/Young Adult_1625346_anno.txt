scene_heading: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL (FANTASY) -— DAY
speaker_heading: MUSIC UP
text: We fade into a scene with all the stylistic hallmarks of
text: a CLASSIC DREAM SEQUENCE. A high school on a sprawling,
text: verdant campus. A sign reads WAVERLEY PREP. Shiny sports
text: cars enter and exit the circular drive.
text: A beautiful STUDENT crosses the lawn. Sunglasses disguise
text: her true age-- she might as well be a teenager. She wears
text: a private school uniform (plaid skirt, blouse, and argyle
text: socks) and carries a stack of seemingly random books.
text: We hear only the peaceful chirping of birds, the
text: student’s quiet footsteps, and the distant, muffled
text: conversations of students. Nothing looks quite real.
dialog: *
text: Suddenly, we hear a bell ringing. Kids quickly to filter *
dialog: into the school. But our student doesn’t seem to know *
text: where to go. She lowers her sunglasses, confused. She *
text: fumbles for a CLASS SCHEDULE. *
text: The girl glances down at her watch, a gaudy, surreal-
text: looking pink Rolex that resembles nothing Rolex has ever
text: made. The ringing is coming from the watch... *
scene_heading: INT. CONDO - MORNING
text: The ringing continues, growing more shrill. Reveal a
text: black old-fashioned alarm clock from Restoration
text: Hardware. There’s a half-empty wine glass next to the
dialog: clock.
text: MAVIS GARY stirs in bed. She’s mid-thirties, blonde,
dialog: attractive. Though Mavis is clearly an adult, we
text: recognize her as the student from the dream.
text: Mavis smacks the clock with surprising violence, and goes
text: back to sleep.
text: The alarm bell rings again, brutal.
text: Mavis gets up and walks into the bathroom. She’s not *
dialog: wearing any pants or underwear.
scene_heading: INT. CONDO (KITCHEN) - SAME
text: Mavis, now wearing unflattering pajama pants, enters the
text: kitchen. We see an empty whiskey bottle on the kitchen
text: counter, and a few empty wine bottles.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: She bends down and unlatches a dog crate. A small, fluffy
speaker_heading: DOG appears.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Good morning, Baguette.
text: Baguette jumps, excited. Mavis peels back the foil ona
text: single-serving container of dog food and places it on the
text: floor. She walks away, not particularly invested in the
text: dog's breakfast.
scene_heading: INT. CONDO (LIVING ROOM) - SAME
text: Alone, Mavis swats at the air. She jumps. She gyrates her
text: hips. She looks silly.
text: Reveal she’s playing Wii Fit.
text: A BALCONY is visible through a sliding glass door.
text: Baguette is locked outside. He stands on his hind legs,
text: wildly batting at the glass.
scene_heading: EXT. CONDO (BALCONY) - SAME
text: Mavis sits on the small steel-girdered balcony in her
text: pajamas. She drinks a can of diet soda. Now Baquette is
text: trapped inside, batting wildly at the other side of the
dialog: glass.
text: From Mavis’s perch, we see downtown Minneapolis, the
text: Mississippi River, and other converted loft buildings
dialog: that used to be factories and granaries.
scene_heading: INT. CONDO (OFFICE AREA) - SAME
text: Mavis sits at her computer. Near the monitor, we see a
dialog: stack of books, They’re all titled Waverley Prep and
text: numbered as if in a series. We see #4, #27, #128. There’s
text: also a large office binder that says WAVERLEY PREP SERIES
speaker_heading: BIBLE.
text: Mavis starts up her computer and opens a text document
dialog: called pieceofshit.word. It’s a work in progress; Mavis
text: appears to be on page 17. The last sentence Mavis has
dialog: written reads as follows:
dialog: “Ashby was the undisputed king bee of Waverley Prep.”
text: Mavis stares at the document without enthusiasm.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: She opens her Web browser and goes directly to a
text: celebrity gossip website. She scrolls down the page,
text: pausing over each item, staring at the vacant, grinning
text: faces of famous people.
text: She opens another window-- her email. She deletes all the
text: overnight spam. We see a message that reads RE:RE:RE:END
text: OF SERIES. Mavis notices the message, perhaps grimacing a
text: little, but doesn’t open it.
text: She then notices a NEW MESSAGE. The subject line says:
dialog: “The best thing that ever happened to us”
text: Mavis pauses, then opens the email. We see a large photo
text: of a NEWBORN BABY in a knitted cap that looks like a
text: strawberry. There’s a small block of text beneath.
text: Mavis’s expression is neutral as she reads the message.
text: She closes the window. After a moment, she clicks it open
text: again, re-reading.
dialog: And re-reading.
text: She reaches for a strand of hair near her ear and begins
text: yanking it in a distracted, obsessive-compulsive way.
scene_heading: INT. CONDO (OFFICE AREA) - SAME
text: It could be ten minutes later. It could be an hour later.
text: Mavis is still in her apartment and still pajama-clad,
text: but now she’s on the phone. She paces, holding her dog as
dialog: if it’s an object.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: Are you busy? Okay. No. Well, I
dialog: just have one quick thing to tell
dialog: you. I got, like, a birth
dialog: announcement. From Buddy.
dialog: (impatient)
dialog: Yes, Buddy Slade. Well, Beth
dialog: actually sent it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Beth, the wife? She must have done
dialog: like, a “send all” or something.
dialog: Like a mass email to everyone in
dialog: his address book, whether they’re
dialog: living or dead or even remotely
dialog: relevant to the situation? One of
dialog: those. I haven't talked to him in,

dialog: It's like, think. Like, send those
dialog: things to your actual friends, you
dialog: know? Jesus.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I guess. The baby looks like just
dialog: a red...you know how they look. It
text: looks like a fetus from Life
dialog: Magazine. Yeah, I don’t know. It
text: has a strawberry hat.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Um, a girl, I think? Yeah, a girl.
dialog: Well, I didn’t see how tall it was
dialog: or how long or whatever, but it
dialog: says eight pounds and some ounces.
dialog: You know, they measure babies in
dialog: ounces. Like marijuana.
dialog: (defeated)
dialog: Yes, that’s all! What, is that not
dialog: interesting enough for you? All
dialog: right, no, just kidding. Well,

speaker_heading: MAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Me again. Hi. Are you gonna have
dialog: lunch today?
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN MINNEAPOLIS - DAY
text: Mavis and her friend VICKI eat McDonald's in a depressing
text: courtyard behind a Wells Fargo building. VICKI is
text: upholstered in a cheap business suit from the mall. Mavis
text: is sloppily dressed. Vicki gives her the once-over.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Just FYI, not all of us have cushy
dialog: joke jobs where we can work from
text: “the home.” Lucky.
text: Vicki’s mouth is full of fries.
speaker_heading: MAVIS

speaker_heading: VICKI

speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: And aren’t they canceling that
dialog: shit anyway?
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: (bristling)
dialog: Books don’t get “canceled”, Vicki.
dialog: That’s not the terminology.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: So I put a fake profile up on a
dialog: dating site today. Just to see
dialog: what happens.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: This birth announcement thing.
dialog: Buddy...
text: Vicki won’t let Mavis derail her anecdote.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I said I was a BBW with “luscious
dialog: curves.”
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: I don’t understand why they would
dialog: send me something like that.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I bet I get all black guys.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Listen!
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: What? You’re still talking about
dialog: Buddy Slade and his wife and their
dialog: email thing?
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Yeah. The baby was just born like
dialog: a month ago. I mean, when you send

dialog: Not for the ex-girlfriend of the

speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Buddy’s always been the type to
dialog: reach out. Remember in school he
dialog: was so friendly to everyone? Like
dialog: he would always pick the

speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: My cousin?
speaker_heading: VICKI

dialog: What are we doing? Why are we not

speaker_heading: MAVIS

dialog: I am excited.
text: Vicki’s laugh is a disrespectful honk.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: You’re more worked up about your
dialog: “soul mate,” Buddy.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: I’m not. I just wanted to tell you
dialog: about something that happened.
dialog: God, excuse me.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Buddy Slade is not, and never was,

speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: We’re fortunate bitches.
text: She gags violently, reaching for her Coke.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT - DAY
text: Mavis returns from her lunch with VICKI. She greets
text: Baguette, who jumps at her knees.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Hi, Baguette.
text: She slides the door to the balcony open. Baguette runs
text: onto the tiny balcony. There’s a small patch of Astroturf
text: with a plastic fire hydrant. This functions as Baguette’s
dialog: bathroom.
speaker_heading: MAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Hurry up. Hurry up.
dialog: (praising)
dialog: Good hurry up.
text: Mavis grabs a banana from the kitchen counter. As she
text: peels it, she heads back to her office.
scene_heading: INT. CONDO (OFFICE AREA) - SAME
text: Mavis contemplates her computer. Unable to resist, she
text: opens the birth announcement email again. She hits PRINT.
scene_heading: INT. CONDO (OFFICE AREA) - MOMENTS LATER
text: Mavis is kneeling in front of the printer. She rips an
text: INK CARTRIDGE out of the bowels of the printer and shakes
text: it in frustration.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: (to herself)
dialog: Fuck you. Goddamit.
text: She locates a hole in the cartridge and SPITS in it.
scene_heading: EXT. CONDO (BALCONY) - SAME
text: Mavis sits on the balcony, eating her banana and reading
dialog: the birth announcement.
text: Bands of strange ink colors run across the baby’s face,
text: making it look alternately pink, blue, and yellow.
scene_heading: INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: A romantic Warehouse District “gastropub”, all exposed
dialog: brick and oil lamps. This is the kind of place that has
text: quail on the menu and an organic wine list.
text: Mavis walks in, dressed for a date. She has legs for
text: miles, but she tugs uncomfortably on the hem of her
dialog: minidress.
text: She squints, looking for someone. A guy wearing a suit
text: waves her over to his table. This is PETER, 42, average
dialog: looks, moderate hair.
text: Mavis heads over to the table.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hello there.
text: He kisses Mavis on the cheek and she responds in kind.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I already ordered us some
dialog: Malpaques.
dialog: (explaining)
dialog: Oysters.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Thank God!

dialog: immediately.
speaker_heading: PETER

dialog: Crazy. So busy. Just a ton of
dialog: stress.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PETER

dialog: Sparkling water? Not flat, please--
dialog: you guys always bring me flat.
dialog: Anyway. I’m just very busy these

dialog: Agghh!

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: And you’re still just writing that
dialog: high school stuff?
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Young adult, yeah. “Y.A.” That’s
dialog: what we call it in the publishing
dialog: biz. There are other acronyms,
dialog: too.
text: Peter drinks his beer and clinks Mavis’s glass.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well, it’s nice to be dating
dialog: someone who’s driven.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Ha ha. That’s me, all right.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I tend to date these really young
dialog: women. You know, they’re more
dialog: consumed with their social lives
dialog: and looking good and all that. I
dialog: always tell them, “Wait a few
dialog: years. You’re not going to be able
dialog: to rely on that face forever.” Am
dialog: I right?
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Mmhm.
speaker_heading: PETER

dialog: That must just annoy you so much.

text: He slurps an oyster with gusto.
scene_heading: INT. CONDO (BEDROOM) - MORNING
text: It’s a gray, quiet morning. Mavis opens her eyes. Peter
text: is in bed next to her, his hand splayed across her back
text: to reveal his signature Rolex Submariner.
text: Mavis looks at him. She lifts his arm as if he’s a
text: Mannequin and climbs out of bed. She crosses the room,
text: wearing Peter’s undershirt and a “date night” thong.
text: Mavis opens her too-small closet and pulls out a gigantic
text: suitcase. She unzips it and places it on the bed. She
text: begins folding clothes and placing them in the suitcase.
text: Mavis packs neatly and judiciously, holding up outfits
text: before they make the final cut.
text: Peter sleeps on, oblivious.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT (KITCHEN) - SAME
text: Mavis, now fully dressed, struggles to get Baguette into
text: a small dog carrier. Finally, she zips up the sides. The
text: carrier wriggles.
text: Mavis throws a few cans of dog food into a large pink
text: Victoria’s Secret shopping bag.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT (BEDROOM) - SAME
text: Mavis places a SPARE KEY next to Peter’s sleeping face on
dialog: the pillow.

scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT (FRONT DOOR) - DAY
text: With the suitcase, the bag, and the dog in tow, Mavis
text: exits, as casually as if she were going to the store.
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT (PARKING GARAGE) - DAY
text: Mavis enters an underground parking garage packed with
text: Jettas, Priuses, and other neglected midprice
text: hipstermobiles. She lugs her suitcase, the shopping bag,
text: and Baguette’s carrier.
text: Her MINI Cooper is blocked in by a grid of cars. She
text: tries to squeeze her body through to access the drivers
text: seat, then realizes there’s really no point to that
text: exercise. The car is stuck.
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT (PARKING GARAGE) - SAME
text: Time has passed. Mavis waits in the vicinity of her car,
text: surrounded by her things. A PARKING ATTENDANT appears, a
text: calloused, slow-moving older man.
scene_heading: PARKING ATTENDANT
dialog: Looks like you’re stuck.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: (red-faced)
dialog: Yes. I’m blocked in.
scene_heading: PARKING ATTENDANT
dialog: This is long-term parking. Usually
dialog: need a little advance notice.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: I know. It’s sort of an emergency.
dialog: It’s a family emergency thing. My
dialog: father. My father’s dying.
text: The attendant climbs into one of the cars behind Mavis’s
text: MINI and starts the ignition.
dialog: We can tell by his demeanor that this is going to take a
dialog: while.
speaker_heading: MAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: (insincere)
dialog: I know, I’m the worst. Thank you
dialog: so, so much.
dialog: 12.
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT (PARKING GARAGE) - DAY

text: Baguette is now sitting in her lap, panting eagerly.
scene_heading: EXT. MINNEAPOLIS - DAY
text: Mavis drives through downtown Minneapolis, passing strip
dialog: clubs and convention centers.
text: She pauses to gawk at a huge sex shop. Orange neon winks
text: at her from the window.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
text: Mavis’s car drives down a rural stretch of highway.
text: Factory farms and ruined fields as far as the eye can
dialog: see.
text: Mavis takes the exit north, toward DULUTH.
scene_heading: INT. CAR —- DAY
text: Mavis listens to Britney Spears and rolls down the
text: window. A surprisingly strong blast of wind hits her
text: face, messing her hair. She rolls the window up again.
text: Baguette gnaws on Pemmican beef jerky on the passenger
text: seat. The wrapper is visible on the floor.
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
text: Mavis pumps gas at a truck stop. A tweaked-out LOT LIZARD
text: in full hooker regalia approaches her.
speaker_heading: HOOKER
dialog: You got a quarter, five dollars
dialog: for my baby?
text: This woman makes Mavis nervous.
speaker_heading: MAVIS

dialog: mother.
speaker_heading: MAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: My sister’s a lactation coach.
text: Her voice trails off as the woman moves closer. Mavis is
text: unnecessarily firm.
speaker_heading: MAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t have anything for you.
dialog: I’m sorry.
text: The gas pump hiccups to a stop. Mavis withdraws the

text: The hooker walks away, mumbling.
speaker_heading: HOOKER
dialog: Yankee bitch.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Did you just call me a yankee?

scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - MAGIC HOUR
text: Mavis’s car is pulled over to the shoulder of the road.
text: She paces in the gravel while Baguette finds a spot to

text: In the distance, we see the shores of Lake Superior.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - NIGHT
text: Mavis is parked, fumbling through crap in her backseat.
text: She flips through an CD booklet until she finds a CD that
text: says “Mad love, Buddy” in black Sharpie.
text: She pops in the CD.
text: A ‘90s alterna-pop song fills the car. It’s “THE CONCEPT”

text: Mavis pauses on the road, looking at the blinking neon
text: sign and the tired cars in the gravel lot. She pulls in
dialog: anyway.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Mavis parks her car. As she turns off the car, her PHONE
text: RINGS and she jumps, groping for it.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: Hey you.
text: Her voice is soft and relieved.
scene_heading: INT. BLUE HILL BAR - NIGHT
text: Mavis walks in, flush with victory. Skynrd plays on the
text: jukebox. The whole scene is tragic.
text: It’s a weeknight. The place is mainly populated with
text: barflies and other sad-looking individuals.
text: Mavis sits down at the bar.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Maker's Mark, please.
text: The BARTENDER obliges. Mavis drinks in such a way that we
text: can tell she’s an experienced and enthusiastic drinker.
text: Mavis looks around the bar. MATT FREEHAUF, 36, is
text: watching her from an adjacent barstool. He’s sad-faced
text: and overweight. There’s a STEEL CRUTCH, the permanent
text: kind, leaning against his stool.
text: Mavis glances at him. She looks away and takes a pink
text: compact mirror out of her purse. She opens the mirror and
text: checks herself out.
text: She glances over at Matt again. He’s still staring.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I’m sorry. I believe we attended
dialog: high school together. In fact, we
dialog: definitely did.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: At the same time?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Yes. You’re Mavis Gary?
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Mavis Gary-Crane now.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Oh. Congrats on that.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Well, I got divorced.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: So it’s just back to Gary, I
dialog: guess. Has been for a while. I’m
dialog: sorry, what is your name?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Matt Freehauf. My locker was
dialog: actually right next to yours. For
dialog: all of high school.
text: A flash of recognition. Embarrassment.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Ohhhh!
text: Her eyes wander to the CRUTCH propped against his stool.
speaker_heading: MAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Of course. Matt Freehauf. Matt.
dialog: Your locker was right there, by
dialog: mine.
dialog: (grasping)
dialog: On the second floor of the school?
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Mm-hm. I was out for most of
dialog: senior year, though.
text: He taps the crutch, indicating a connection. Mavis
text: smiles, but it’s horribly awkward.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Right, right.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You may remember me as the “hate
dialog: crime guy?”
dialog: (off Mavis’s look)
dialog: Bunch of jocks who thought I was
dialog: gay jumped me in the woods and hit
dialog: my legs and dick with a crowbar?
dialog: It was national news. I mean,
dialog: until people found out I wasn’t
dialog: actually gay. Then it wasn’t a
dialog: hate crime. It was just a fat guy
text: getting his ass kicked.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 20.
dialog: (2)
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: I do recall that.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I even got my own prayer-a-thon,
dialog: courtesy of the Lutheran Teen
dialog: Club. 10 hours of Dear Heavenly
dialog: Fathers and I can still only walk
dialog: in circles.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: How’s your dick?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Not good.
text: Mavis nods. The bartender pushes a second Maker’s towards
text: her, and she accepts it with a long, grateful sip. Matt
text: begins talking again, and she cringes.
text: He sighs.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s not like we ran in the same
dialog: circles, regardless. You were
dialog: extremely popular, if I recall.
dialog: You won “Best Hair” in the senior
dialog: superlatives. And I was, you know,
text: a big theater fag.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: So you were gay.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: No. It’s an expression. Theater
dialog: fag, drama geek.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Well, it’s nice to see you.
text: Mavis taps away at her cell phone idly. Matt’s not ready
text: to end the conversation.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: What are you even doing in town? I
dialog: know you’re not one of the losers
dialog: who stuck around.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Oh. I’m just taking care of this
dialog: real estate thing. I have some

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Aren’t you some kind of teen
dialog: writer now? I read about it in the
dialog: Sun. How’d you score that gig?
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Talent?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: No offense intended. I was just
dialog: curious. It’s a cool job.
text: Mavis takes another healthy swig from the glass and
text: squints at Matt, suddenly deeming him worthy of honesty.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: My uncle runs the publishing
dialog: house.
text: A surprised half-smile from Matt, who appreciates
text: straight talk. Mavis downs the rest of her drink as they
text: relax into drunken conversation.
text: MUSIC UP as TIME PASSES.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. BLUE HILL BAR - THREE BOURBONS LATER
text: Mavis is obviously drunk. Her body language is sloppy and
text: she shouts over the music. She leans toward Matt
text: conspiratorially.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: I love Taylor Swift!
text: She reaches for a BOTTLE of an unfamiliar beverage, which
text: Matt eyes with some alarm. He steadies her arm before she
dialog: can spill it.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Careful.
text: Mavis points to the bottle instructively. It’s a cheesy
text: brand of alcoholic CIDER.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Hard Jack. See? This is what Buddy
dialog: Slade drinks!
text: She takes a passionate swig. MATT is confused.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: That’s a good, uh, fact.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So are you seeing your family

speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: My family? Fuck my family!
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Okay!
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: I don’t have a “good” relationship
dialog: with my stepfather, right?
text: She makes air quotes around the word good for no reason.
speaker_heading: MAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: When I got married to
dialog: Allen...Allen is my ex-husband,
dialog: Allen Crane, the retard of
dialog: Hennepin County, but anyway. When
dialog: I got married to Allen, me and my
dialog: stepfather go out to do our
dialog: special daddy-daughter dance at
dialog: the reception. Right? Because he
dialog: basically raised me, inasmuch
dialog: as...whatever. And I tell you, my
dialog: stepfather has always been weird.
dialog: Around me, and well, just around
dialog: me. So we go out and this song
dialog: starts playing, you know
dialog: (singing)
dialog: I got sunshiiiine...
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: “My Girl.”
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: And we're dancing at my wedding in

speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Dark indeed. “That’s dark.” I love

text: She paws Matt’s arm affectionately.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Thanks.
text: Mavis has reached for a patch of hair behind her ear.
text: She’s pulling at it compulsively, fingering the roots.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Wanna know why I’m really in town?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: (stage-whispering)

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (stage-whispering

dialog: Okay!
scene_heading: EXT. BLUE HILL BAR - NIGHT
text: Mavis and MATT stand in the parking lot near the kitchen
text: entrance. Mavis is SMOKING aggressively. As Matt moves
text: further from the entrance, we can see how much effort it
text: takes for him to walk, even with assistance.
text: MATT leans on his crutch, waiting for Mavis to speak.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: I’m here because I’m still deeply
dialog: in love with Buddy Slade and I
dialog: want him back.
text: MATT laughs, assuming this is a joke.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Awesome. Buddy Slade. I’m pretty
dialog: sure Buddy’s married. With a kid

speaker_heading: MAVIS

dialog: The kid’s here. She had the baby.
dialog: I don’t care though. I have

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Wait, are you not joking?
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: I know people won’t understand,
dialog: but things like this happen. They
dialog: do happen. Usually they happen in
text: slow-motion. Like, two people are
dialog: meant to be together and then they
dialog: slowly get rid of what’s keeping
dialog: them apart. They get divorced,
dialog: they reconfigure. And everyone’s
dialog: cool with that, right? Society’s
dialog: okay with that.
dialog: (rambling)
dialog: Everyone’s a homewrecker; we just
text: wreck very slowly.
text: Matt can barely follow her drunken rant.
speaker_heading: MAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: But see, I can’t go slow. I have
dialog: to tell Buddy now. I don’t have
dialog: time to play this little game of
dialog: decency that everyone is so into.
dialog: (breaking up)
dialog: You see, Freehauf? I’m 36. I don’t
dialog: have time.
text: Matt is momentarily speechless.
text: Mavis focuses her attention on trying to light the wrong
text: end of another cigarette.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Um, I would advise you...Mavis?
dialog: Mavis, look at me. Okay. I would
dialog: advise you to keep all this to
dialog: yourself. Talk to a therapist or
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Hey, my friend Kelly is a

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Great. Hey, just don’t call Buddy

speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Well, I already did. I called him,

speaker_heading: MAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh. A cab for me.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Yeah, we called them, remember?
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: Listen, Buddy already has a life.
dialog: Without you.
text: Mavis begins walking backward toward the car, lecturing
text: to MATT as she stumbles.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: A life? Babies are boring, okay?
text: Buddy’s life is BORING. Boring,
dialog: boring, boring, boring, boring!
text: She climbs into the cab as MATT watches, incredulous.
speaker_heading: MAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: (hanging out the

dialog: BORING!
text: The cab sputters off into the night. MATT waves
text: halfheartedly.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - MORNING
text: Mavis wakes up, still wearing her clothes from the night
text: before. Her dog is in bed with her.
text: She sits up, her hair plastered across her face. She

scene_heading: EXT. MERCURY MAIN DRAG - DAY

text: sunlight. She looks terrible.
text: Cars whiz by as Mavis ambles past the KenTacoHut like a
dialog: hobo.
scene_heading: EXT. BLUE HILL BAR - DAY
text: Mavis finally arrives at her destination on foot. Her car
text: is alone in the lot. There’s a letter on her windshield:
text: "Do'nt (sic) Park Here Alnight CITY BOY.”
text: She crumples it up, gets in and drives away.
scene_heading: INT. STRIP MALL NAIL SALON - DAY
text: Mavis sits in a high-tech “throne.” Her feet are ina
text: swirling basin of water. The chair vibrates.
text: A young GIRL on her knees buffs Mavis’s feet. She reaches
dialog: for a pedicure tool.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Please don’t use the callous
dialog: slicer. No, don’t. Do not.
dialog: Unsanitary. Thanks.
scene_heading: INT. STRIP MALL NAIL SALON (BACK ROOM) - DAY
text: A technician applies WAX to Mavis’s eyebrows and rips it

scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM (BATHROOM) - day

dialog: of expensive brushes.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: She coats her face with foundation like a party clown. It

text: As her lips are glossed and her lashes blackened, we see
dialog: that she’s a truly gorgeous woman.
text: She wraps her hair around a curling iron, enjoying the
dialog: process of making herself attractive.
text: She pulls back her hair briefly to reveal the pink,
text: balding patch behind her left ear. Her “pulling place.”
text: She smooths it, then makes sure her hair is pushed
dialog: forward to disguise it.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - DUSK

scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN MERCURY - DAY

scene_heading: INT. CHAMPION O’MALLEY’S —- HAPPY HOUR

text: Mavis is sitting in a polished wood booth. She positions
text: herself so she has a clear view of the door. She cranes
text: her neck ever so slightly.
text: A passing BAR EMPLOYEE plunks down some silverware rolled

dialog: to compose a text message.
dialog: Reveal the SCREEN of the phone: “jggjsgnkajwhriuawgf”"
text: Mavis glances at the nearest table. A couple of GUYS are
text: eating nachos and watching a basketball game on one of
text: the overhead TVs. One of the guys notices Mavis, but the
text: acknowledgment is minimal.
text: Mavis sits up a little straighter, arching her back. She
text: puts her elbows on the table, thrusting her breasts
text: forward. She ruins the effect by looking down.
dialog: Then...
text: BUDDY enters the bar, alert but not nervous. He’s an
text: attractive guy in jeans, flannel and a baseball cap.

text: Buddy rounds the corner toward Mavis.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Hey you!
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Wow. Great to see you, hon.

text: They separate. Buddy slides into the booth across Mavis.
speaker_heading: BUDDY (CONT’D)
dialog: So! This is a midweek surprise.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: I know. I was just back in town,

speaker_heading: BUDDY

speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Oh, me neither, God. But I figured
dialog: for old times sake.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Honestly, I haven’t been drinking
dialog: the past few months. Beth’s
dialog: nursing our girl, so I thought
dialog: I’d, you know, show some

speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: You knew I had a daughter, right?
speaker_heading: MAVIS

speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: I’m just working my butt off.
dialog: Doing my thing in the city.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Right, down there in the “Mini
dialog: Apple.”
speaker_heading: MAVIS

speaker_heading: MAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: So are you still at General Mills?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Yup. Ad sales now. Don’t love all

speaker_heading: BUDDY (CONT’D)
dialog: Sorry. Hey, I’m just gonna grab

speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Ah. Very chivalrous.

text: MUSIC UP: Something dreamy, sexy and worshipful, like “My
dialog: Sweet Lord” by George Harrison.
text: In slow motion, we see Buddy sidle up to the bar, leaning
text: toward the bartender. Mavis’s gaze-- our gaze-- drifts
text: down his body. Suddenly, Mavis is alive.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
text: He’s just an average suburban dad, but the way Mavis
text: looks at him, he’s the very embodiment of sensuality.
text: His back, softened by years of inactivity. The hang of
text: his “relaxed fit” jeans. The way his thirty-dollar
text: haircut feathers against the nape of his neck. Mavis
text: drinks it all in, lost in a reverie.
text: On Mavis’s face, hopeful and sad at once...
text: Then-- an interruption. MATT Freehauf.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Mavis?
text: He’s standing over her booth, leaning on his crutch.
text: Mavis is not thrilled to see him.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Freehauf. What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I work here. I do the books and

speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: (tightly)
text: Just having a cocktail.
speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: It was good running into you last
dialog: night. Nice to see you again.

speaker_heading: BUDDY

speaker_heading: MAVIS

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: BUDDY

speaker_heading: MAVIS

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: MAVIS

speaker_heading: BUDDY

speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Well, we have this place. Beats
dialog: the Blue Hill, right? We have a

speaker_heading: MAVIS

speaker_heading: MAVIS

speaker_heading: BUDDY

speaker_heading: BUDDY

speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Where are you originally from,

text: Beth swallows and dabs her mouth with a napkin.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Oh. Close by, actually. I grew up
dialog: in East Duluth.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: You were rich.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: We weren’t loaded. My dad was a
dialog: podiatrist.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: My father’s a doctor too.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Stepdad.
text: If Mavis is annoyed by the correction, she doesn’t let

speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: (to Buddy)
dialog: No, my biological father is also
dialog: in the medical field.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Oh yeah? Where does he practice?
text: Buddy cringes, knowing this is a sore subject.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: I don’t know, Beth. I’m afraid I
dialog: haven’t seen him in years.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Sorry for what?
text: She pats Buddy’s arm.
speaker_heading: MAVIS (CONT’D)
dialog: Poor Buddy’s over here like Ahhhh!
dialog: No, it’s all right. I’ve been
dialog: dealing with it forever.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: She looks at Buddy meaningfully.
speaker_heading: MAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Buddy knows the whole story. He
dialog: knows everything about me. The
dialog: whole story of Mavis.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: That is true.
text: Mavis takes a long, satisfying gulp of water, glancing at
text: Beth over the rim of the glass.
text: The doorbell rings.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (through a mouthful
dialog: of food)
dialog: Ooh! Babysitter’s here.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Rock and roll!

speaker_heading: MAVIS

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I am dressed for the show.
scene_heading: EXT. CHAMPION 0’ MALLEY’S - EVENING (TO ESTABLISH)
text: There’s a modest line of people outside the bar, mostly
dialog: in their 30s and 40s.
scene_heading: INT. CHAMPION 0’ MALLEY’S - SAME
text: We pan past a HOMEMADE FLYER advertising Beth’s band. It
dialog: says “Nipple Confusion: Moms That Rock!” The four band
text: members are pictured in a grid, Beatles-style.
text: The band is tuning up on a tiny stage surrounded by brass
text: rails. The lead singer, MARY ELLEN TRANTOWSKI, has
text: tattoos on her arms and a cool (for Duluth) haircut.
dialog: There’s also a bass player, a guitarist, and of course,
text: Beth. She fusses with her drums, tightening them up with
dialog: a key.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MARY ELLEN
dialog: (into mic)
dialog: Testing! Four-four, three-three...
text: Mavis and Buddy linger by the bar. Mavis is drinking
text: Buddy’s brand of beer. She hands a fresh bottle to Buddy.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Oh. Thanks, Mavis.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: So are they any good?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Are they good? The band.
text: Buddy seems a little looser than usual. He finishes off
dialog: the beer.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Totally. Look, Freehauf’s over
dialog: there.
text: Sure enough, Matt is leaning against an EMPLOYEES ONLY
text: doorway near the rear of the bar. He watches the stage
text: passively, his arms crossed over his belly. Mavis tries
dialog: to not make eye contact.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Ha. God, he’s always just lurking
dialog: around, isn’t he? So creepy!
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Matt’s been through a lot. He’s a
dialog: good guy.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Well, he freaks me out. Look at
text: his face. He’s so doughy. He looks
text: like a murderer.
text: It’s a dumb, mean comment but Buddy is amused.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: You definitely are a writer
dialog: Mavis.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: See? Now you’re laughing.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: You’ve always been so funny.
text: Mavis is thrilled with this moment of attention and
text: validation. She leans in and opens her mouth to speak.
text: Alas, she’s quickly drowned out by the sound of Beth.
text: doing an EXTREMELY LOUD SOUND CHECK on her drums.
scene_heading: BANG! BANG! BANG! BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.
text: The sound guy gives Beth a thumbs-up from his console.
text: Mavis is beyond irritated.
speaker_heading: MARY ELLEN
dialog: (onstage)
dialog: Hello Mercury!
text: The small crowd cheers.
speaker_heading: MARY ELLEN (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m Mary Ellen Trantowski and we
dialog: are Nipple Confusion! Please be
dialog: kind, as this is only our second
dialog: show and we all have small
text: children at home.
text: Friendly laughter from the crowd.
speaker_heading: MARY ELLEN (CONT’D)
dialog: This first one is a cover. It was
dialog: originally recorded by Teenage
dialog: Fanclub in 1996. It was our
dialog: drummer Beth’s idea.
text: She gestures to Beth, who grins and waves a drum stick
text: and Buddy and Mavis’s direction. Buddy leans toward Mavis
text: instructively and whispers:
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Beth loves this song.
text: The song begins with a few loud strums and a familiar
dialog: couplet sung by Mary Beth:
speaker_heading: MARY ELLEN
dialog: (singing)
text: She wears denim wherever she
dialog: goes...
text: Mavis’s face falls as she watches them play. This is HER
text: song with Buddy. The song from the mix tape.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
text: Beth pounds the drums with unschooled enthusiasm. Even
text: though the band is technically sloppy, everyone is
text: smiling and cheering.
text: Mavis’s eyes fill up with tears. Or is she just drunk?
text: She looks around. Up front, a PROUD DAD holds a toddler
text: wearing LARGE PROTECTIVE HEADPHONES.
text: Two KIDS, about 7 and 9, dance in front of the stage. The
text: women in the band-- even Beth, who drums doggedly--
text: HARMONIZE TOGETHER on the chorus, and not very well.
scene_heading: MARY ELLEN & THE BAND
dialog: I didn’t want to hurt you, oh
dialog: yeah...
text: Mavis looks at Buddy. He’s rocking out, guzzling anouther
dialog: beer.
text: Mavis glances at Matt Freehauf, who’s still leaning
text: against the doorway. Their eyes meet. His gaze is full of
text: pity. She hates that he pities her.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL (FANTASY) - DAY
text: From Mavis’s POV, we head toward a pair of double doors.
text: Just outside the doors, we see a group of gossiping GIRLS
dialog: wearing high-school uniforms. Only they’re not girls;
text: they’re BETH’S FRIENDS. Mary Ellen glances at Mavis
text: through the glass with a sneer. Mavis pushes through the
dialog: doors.
scene_heading: ABRUPT CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CHAMPION 0’ MALLEY’S - NIGHT
text: Mavis opens the front door of the bar to exit. It’s a
text: typical postshow scene, albeit a little more family-
text: friendly. The crowd spills out onto the sidewalk. Friends
text: load BAND GEAR into someone’s van. Beth and her bandmates
text: chat excitedly. Beth is clearly having a blast. Mavis and
text: Buddy linger on the periphery.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: I messed up the fill so bad on
dialog: “Haircut.” I’m sorry guys.
speaker_heading: BASSIST
dialog: No honey, you were great.
text: Buddy’s voice is a loud, drunken bray.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Yeah, you guys were namazing.
speaker_heading: MARY ELLEN

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (affectionate)
dialog: I think someone’s had a
dialog: few too many.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Oh, hardly...
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Yup, I’m pretty drunk. Bethie, we
dialog: gotta get home. Relieve the
text: babysitter.
text: He takes another swill of beer, amid protests from Beth’s
dialog: rowdy mom-friends.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Aw, really? I want to stay out
text: just a little while longer.
speaker_heading: GUITARIST
dialog: Yeah Buddy, you can’t have her
dialog: back yet!
text: Beth pouts cutely, batting her lashes at Buddy.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: (suddenly)
dialog: I’ll drive him home.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (eager )
dialog: Really?
text: Mary Ellen gives Mavis the once-over. Mavis notices the
text: coldness of her stare. Beth may be oblivious, but nothing
text: gets past Mary Ellen.
speaker_heading: MARY ELLEN
dialog: It’s interesting to see you
text: hanging around again, Mavis.
text: Mavis summons her best high-school bitch attitude.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Mary Ellen, you were great
dialog: tonight. It’s inspiring to see a
dialog: single, partnerless mother with so
text: much confidence onstage.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Buddy, let Mavis drive you home,
dialog: OK? I’m gonna stay and celebrate.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Sure. Okay.
text: Mavis takes the Jeep keys from Buddy. She holds them up
text: and clicks the “unlock” button triumphantly.
text: As the car BEEPS, Mavis flashes her best shit-eating grin
text: at a scowling Mary Ellen.
scene_heading: EXT. BUDDY’S HOUSE - NIGHT (TO ESTABLISH)
text: The Jeep pulls up. Mavis and Buddy get out and walk up
text: onto the porch. Buddy stumbles, leaning on Mavis. We hear
text: their voices in the night.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Easy, Bud.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: My tolerance has really gone down
dialog: since you knew me.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: What do you mean, “since I knew
dialog: you”?
scene_heading: EXT. BUDDY’S HOUSE (PORCH) - NIGHT (TO ESTABLISH)
text: Buddy goes to enter the house, but Mavis stops him.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Hey, wait.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: What?
text: Mavis takes Buddy by the wrist and looks at his cheap
text: Timex watch. To her, it’s more beautiful than any Rolex.
text: She pushes the “Indiglo” button, illuminating the watch,
text: and shows Buddy the time. 10:53.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Look. You still have seven
dialog: Minutes. Don’t you have that baby-
dialog: sitter until 11?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Yeah. But seven minutes is
dialog: nothing. We can’t go anywhere.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: That’s true. We can’t. But time is
dialog: so precious.
text: Buddy’s words are slurred.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I know, I know, Mavis. I’m
dialog: learning that from my little girl.
text: This isn’t what Mavis wants to hear, but it gives her a
dialog: new tactic.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: You’re a great father. You’re
text: already going above and beyond in
dialog: so many ways. Remember when we
dialog: were kids? Dads didn’t have to do
dialog: shit. They came and they went and
dialog: we still bought them new golf
text: balls and tie tacks on Father’s
dialog: Day. But you-- you’ve really
dialog: stepped up to the plate. You do
dialog: too much, even.
text: Now Buddy’s voice has become similarly low and intimate.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Do you think so?
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Yes. You’re such a good, good man,
dialog: Buddy. Don’t ever shortchange
dialog: yourself.
text: Buddy chuckles softly and drunkenly. His hand has
text: wandered to Mavis’s bare arm. It’s a friendly grip, more
text: for balance than anything, but there’s tension now.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I just...I really love my
dialog: daughter.
text: Mavis hugs him.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: I know. And that’s the only thing
dialog: that matters. Not Beth, not
dialog: anything--
text: Buddy and Mavis’s faces meet in a KISS. It’s a hard close-
text: mouthed kiss, but a kiss nonetheless.
text: Buddy pulls away.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Hey, hey, hey.
text: The BABYSITTER, an effeminate college-aged guy, suddenly
text: opens the door and appears on the porch. He holds a
text: pacifier in one hand and stares daggers at Mavis.
speaker_heading: BABYSITTER
dialog: (indignant )
dialog: I thought I saw lights.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Yeah, um, Daniel. I’m home.
speaker_heading: BABYSITTER
dialog: Where’s Beth?
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: (exaggerating)
dialog: Beth wanted to stay out all night
dialog: and party.
speaker_heading: BABYSITTER
dialog: Well, we’re all out of breastmilk
dialog: and she doesn’t want the nuk
dialog: anymore.
text: He holds up the “nuk,” a pacifier, as if it’s tainted.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I got it.
text: Buddy heads into the house, drunk and flustered, not
text: turning to say goodbye to Mavis.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Good night, Buddy.
speaker_heading: BABYSITTER
dialog: (slamming door)
dialog: Good night.

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: MAVIS

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Mike Moran is your cousin?
speaker_heading: MAVIS

dialog: Six years, what is that, wood?
dialog: Porcelain?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Hot lead?
dialog: Mike

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: What, like, rock-crawling, you

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Nahh, I’m vertical, bro. Believe

speaker_heading: HEDDA

speaker_heading: HEDDA

text: Her hair looks incredible.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Let me check...

speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
text: Yep. Still smells like lilies.
speaker_heading: HEDDA
dialog: Always, since she was little it’s

dialog: while I was screaming and begging
dialog: him not too.
text: She directs this at Hedda, not David.
speaker_heading: HEDDA

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We’re busy too, honey.
speaker_heading: HEDDA

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: HEDDA

speaker_heading: MAVIS

speaker_heading: HEDDA

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: MAVIS

dialog: And the baby is part of him, so--
dialog: I love it too.
speaker_heading: HEDDA
dialog: Oh, it doesn’t work that way!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Not at all.
speaker_heading: HEDDA
dialog: You wish your kids were a part of

speaker_heading: DAVID

scene_heading: INT. HEDDA AND DAVID’S HOUSE (BEDROOM) - DAY
text: Mavis creeps upstairs and peeks into her old bedroom.
text: It’s the bedroom of a popular girl from the ‘90s-- which
text: seems pretty sad and faded now. Her bulletin board,
text: covered in blue ribbons and certificates, still hangs
text: over the desk. There’s a diploma from the University of
dialog: Minnesota, and some Kappa Alpha Theta stuff.
text: We see a framed class photo of Mavis with HUGE BANGS
text: sitting in the corner. Teenage Mavis has a smile so huge
text: it’s almost a grimace.
text: There’s a class graduation photo on the wall, one of
text: those giant long-format ones with everyone’s head shot.
text: Mavis walks over to it and scans the names. No sign of
dialog: Matt.
text: In small type at the bottom of the picture it says:
dialog: Photos not available: Yun Ng, Matthew Freehauf.
text: Mavis opens the closet. From a pile of old clothes, she
text: retrieves a RED SWEATSHIRT and unfolds it eagerly. We
text: can’t see what’s on the front of it.
scene_heading: INT. HEDDA AND DAVID'S HOUSE (HALLWAY) - DAY

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Mavis in a chic white dress, cuddled up to ALLEN, an
text: average-looking man who seems thrilled to be wedded to
dialog: her.
text: Allen brandishes a silver CAKE SERVER as if it’s a
text: weapon. This gesture seems to annoy the bride, who
text: glances sidelong at him even as she smiles.
scene_heading: INT. HEDDA AND DAVID'S HOUSE (KITCHEN) - SAME
text: Mavis emerges downstairs, stuffing the red sweatshirt
text: into Baguette’s bag.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Can you take down that wedding

text: Hedda is washing some greens in a colander.
speaker_heading: HEDDA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Can you take down my wedding
dialog: picture?
speaker_heading: HEDDA
dialog: Just because you got a divorce
dialog: doesn’t mean that we can’t enjoy
dialog: the memory of Allen.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
text: Allen’s still alive.
speaker_heading: HEDDA
dialog: Have you talked to that little

dialog: Sophocles or...
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Why would I keep in touch with
dialog: Allen's nephew?
speaker_heading: HEDDA
dialog: Because you were close and it
dialog: would be a nice thing to do.

speaker_heading: HEDDA
dialog: Now what is this? Are we doing
dialog: this again?
text: Mavis jerks away. David walks in with a basket of small

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I hope you’re staying for dinner.

speaker_heading: HEDDA

speaker_heading: HEDDA

scene_heading: EXT. WOODS BEHIND THE SCHOOL - NIGHT
text: Mercury High is lit up like a brick prison. Past the

text: Mavis and Matt trek through the overgrowth.
text: Mavis shivers in her tank top. She reaches into her purse
text: and takes out the RED SWEATSHIRT she found at her

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: MAVIS

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Why would you send these back to
dialog: the publisher?!
speaker_heading: ASSOCIATE
dialog: Wull...we’re probably not going to
dialog: sell them. The series is done.
dialog: Hey...
text: Mavis is rapidly, manically signing another book, making
text: her signature as big as possible. She reaches for
text: another. As the associate moves toward her, she slams it

speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Okay. Fine.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. BUDDY’S HOUSE - DAY
text: Mavis stands on the porch, holding a baby gift ina
text: decorative bag. She rings the doorbell.
text: Buddy’s mother, JAN answers. She’s in her 60’s and has
text: basically let herself go. Her voice is as coarse as her
dialog: short hair.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Hi, Jan.
speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: Well! It’s been a very long time
dialog: since I’ve seen you.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: I’ve been a busy lady.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: So I hear. Buddy’s been very busy,
dialog: ha ha! And Bethie. I’m finally a
dialog: grandma.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: I’m so glad for you.
text: Buddy intercepts at just the right moment.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Hey there.
text: He reaches for Mavis, who hugs him enthusiastically. Mid-
text: hug, Mavis looks at Jan over Buddy’s shoulder. It’s an
text: aggressive, pointed stare. Jan stares back.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: I brought a present.
text: She offers the gift bag awkwardly.
speaker_heading: MAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: They’re just um, burp cloths.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Great, we always need more pukers.
dialog: Ha ha.
speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: (interjecting)
dialog: But it’s all1111 worth it.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Hey Mom, I think Beth needs help
dialog: with the endive thing.
speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: Grandma to the rescue!
text: Jan scurries off to the kitchen. The small house is
text: crowded with friends and relatives. People are spilling
text: out into the yard.
text: DANIEL, the suspicious babysitter from the other night,
text: is socializing across the room. He sees Mavis and gives
text: her the stink eye. She returns the look with her best
dialog: Pretty Girl Death Stare.
text: Mavis turns her attention back to Buddy, smiling. She
text: reaches into her purse and hands the Waverley Prep book
dialog: to Buddy.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: (to Buddy)
dialog: Here’s that book. For Kendra. Your
dialog: niece.
text: Buddy is grateful, but he barely glances at the book.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Hey, thanks! She’s not here, but
dialog: I’ll send it to her.
text: Mavis gazes at Buddy, savoring this rare moment of “alone
text: time” even surrounded by chaos.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: There’s a character in this one
dialog: that I based on you.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (distracted)
dialog: Hm?
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: In the book. I mean, I named him
dialog: Ashby, but it’s so blatantly you.
dialog: When you read it, it’1l be
dialog: obvious.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I hope he’s cool.
text: Mavis laughs nervously.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: We’re not even supposed to do
dialog: that. We’re supposed to stick to
dialog: this character bible? But I
dialog: Managed to slip it through. I had
dialog: some things I wanted to say to you
dialog: so I thought I would use the
dialog: book to--
text: Mavis realizes Buddy is totally distracted. He’s grabbed
text: a LITTLE BOY and has turned the shrieking child upside-
text: down. The boy’s giggles drown out Mavis.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (playful)
dialog: Get outta here, Carter-bug!
text: He releases the boy and smiles at Mavis. You were saying?
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: You must be overwhelmed, Buddy.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Because of the party?
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Because of all of it.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (not getting it)
dialog: Yeah. Yeah, totally. It overwhelms
dialog: me every day, how happy I am.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: But you’re not.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: What?
text: Jan re-enters holding the BABY.
speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: Look who’s up!
text: People immediately crowd around the baby.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Hi, sweet pea.
text: He tenderly takes the baby from Jan, delighting the
text: assembled relatives. Everyone loves a daddy with his baby
dialog: girl.
text: Mavis watches the “show” as women coo over Buddy’s
text: paternal stylings. She tries to smile, but there’s
text: unmistakable scorn in her eyes.
text: Mavis wanders away toward a folding table that’s been set
text: up as a makeshift bar in the overcrowded room. She pours
text: herself a shot of Jim Beam, checks to see if anyone's
text: looking, and downs it.
dialog: Swallow. Repeat.
text: In the background, a musical infant toy begins playing
text: “Yankee Doodle.” Jan sings along with it loudly and
dialog: tunelessly.
speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: (singing)
text: Yankee Doodle came to town, riding
dialog: Macaroni. You’re my special baby
dialog: girl, you're a special baby.
dialog: Hooray!

scene_heading: EXT. BUDDY’S YARD - DAY
text: Mavis moves through the yard, now clutching a fruity
text: drink that’s nearly gone. She’s stumbling a little,
dialog: drinking too fast.
text: Everything looks grotesque. All these pale, simple
dialog: people, their potato salad and their punch...Mavis is
dialog: sick.
text: Mary Ellen and some other moms are hanging out near the
text: food. Mary Ellen sees Mavis and murmurs something to the
text: clique. They LAUGH, doing a crappy job of disguising
dialog: their disdain.
text: Buddy calls for people’s attention.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Hey, listen up everyone.
text: Everyone obliges.
speaker_heading: BUDDY (CONT’D)
dialog: I have a little surprise for
dialog: everyone, so if you'll just direct
dialog: your attention to the garage ina
dialog: few minutes...
text: Buddy races off mysteriously. Buddy’s mother turns
text: proudly to a matronly FRIEND of hers and begins dishing
text: quietly. The whole conversation is barely audible.
speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: It's a “push present.” Have you
dialog: heard of this? It’s a new thing,
dialog: apparently.
speaker_heading: FRIEND
dialog: Push?
speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: You know, because she pushed out
dialog: the little one.
text: Jan does a comical little squat to demonstrate.
speaker_heading: FRIEND
dialog: Ahhhh! That’s different!
dialog: The word “different” has a special connotation in
dialog: Minnesota.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 94,
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: But Mavis isn’t paying attention to this conversation.
text: She wanders in a daze. Her hands are shaking as she
text: reaches for a cigarette.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Mavis? Are you okay?
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: I would be if I could get a drink.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: There’s some right here.
text: She reaches for a PITCHER OF PUNCH, but is temporarily
text: distracted by an OLDER RELATIVE.
speaker_heading: BETH (CONT'D)
dialog: What? Oh no, she’s fine with
dialog: Grandpa right now. Thank you,
dialog: Uncle Bob.
text: She turns back toward Mavis and accidentally BUMPS
text: against a party guest. Most of the punch SPLASHES onto
text: the front of Mavis’s minidress.
speaker_heading: Beth (CONT'D)
dialog: (stammering)
dialog: Oh! I’1l get something...
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Oh my God. Oh my God. Fuck you!
dialog: Fuck you!
text: Beth backs off, blinking. The edge on Mavis’s voice grabs
text: people’s attention. Conversation stops.
text: Mavis laughs.
speaker_heading: MAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m just joking, Beth. God, you
dialog: should see your face. You’re just
text: standing there like a big lump.
text: Beth’s confused half-smile fades.
speaker_heading: MAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: No, just kidding. For real, I love
dialog: your jersey.
text: She tugs on the sleeve of Beth’s loose-fitting, square-
text: shaped dress. It does look a bit like a football jersey.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: MAVIS (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: BETH

speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: You guys sure have a lot of rags
dialog: around here. Burp cloths,
dialog: whatever. Hey, use some’a mine
dialog: that I just bought you.
text: Everyone is staring at Mavis.
speaker_heading: MAVIS (CONT’D)
dialog: The funny thing is, I actually
dialog: could have had this party a long
dialog: time ago. I mean, this very same
dialog: party. Buddy and I were together
dialog: for four years.
dialog: (nodding toward Jan)
dialog: Jan knows.
text: Jan looks away, already mortified.
speaker_heading: MAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Remember? We were inseparable,
dialog: in more ways than one! Ooh, I’m
dialog: sorry, Jan, Kirk...
dialog: Buddy got me pregnant.
text: A few embarrassed gasps from the crowd. Beth appears,
text: proffering a rag.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: You want to clean up, Mavis?
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: No, don’t worry. It’s linen. It’s
dialog: fucked.
dialog: 95.
text: Beth gently and discreetly tries to towel off Mavis, but
text: Mavis resists, pushing her away.
speaker_heading: MAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: Wait, I’m telling a story. Buddy

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: MAVIS (CONT’D)

dialog: going to have a baby and a naming
dialog: party and a Funquarium and little
dialog: fruit hats and all that. And nine
dialog: weeks in, I had, well, I had
dialog: Buddy’s miscarriage, which I
dialog: wouldn't wish for-- to happen to
dialog: anyone. Even if they totally
dialog: deserved it.
text: Shocked silence. Beth looks like she wants to die.
speaker_heading: MAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe if things had been a little
dialog: bit more hospitable, you know,
dialog: down south, in my broken body,
dialog: Buddy and I would be here right
text: now. With a teenager, and probably
dialog: even more kids. We always came
dialog: back to each other. Always. Didn’t
dialog: we, Jan?
text: The GARAGE DOOR opens noisily. Reveal Buddy’s legs, then
text: Buddy’s entire body, then Buddy’s smiling face.
text: He stands expectantly next to a BRAND NEW DRUM KIT.
text: There’s a jaunty BOW tied to the ride cymbal.
text: Nobody says a word.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: You guys, it’s a new drum kit for
dialog: Beth.
text: An ELDERLY MAN claps dutifully. A few people join in, but
text: most people are still whispering.
text: Buddy hits the CRASH CYMBAL for emphasis, confused.
text: Beth has tears in her eyes, but manages to croak out a
dialog: response.
dialog: Beth
dialog: Thank you, honey.
speaker_heading: BUDDY

speaker_heading: JAN

speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (hushed)
dialog: What the hell are you doing? My
dialog: wife invited you here. You
dialog: wouldn’t be here, otherwise.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: You invited me, Buddy.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Beth practically forced me to call
dialog: you. I mean, she even stood there
dialog: and supervised to make sure I’d do
dialog: it. She feels sorry for you. I’ve
dialog: been trying to blow you off the
dialog: whole time you've been in town,
dialog: but Beth is a really good person,
dialog: you know? And it’s obvious you’ve

speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: (to Buddy)
dialog: You're lying.

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: He’s not.

dialog: concern. Still sympathetic!
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: What about now? Do you hate me
dialog: now? I hate you, so it should be
dialog: easy. What the fuck is wrong
dialog: with you people?
text: Mavis tries to stagger out of the yard, but accidentally
text: misses the gate.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Mavis.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: (departing)
dialog: I came back for you. For you. And

scene_heading: INT./EXT. MATT'S HOUSE - DUSK
text: The doorbell chimes. Matt limps to the door. Sandra

dialog: so bad!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Don’t do that!
text: Sandra is watching, dumbstruck, from her beanbag chair.

speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: Stop! STOP! I love your hair! It’s
dialog: so beautiful!
text: This is the most emotion Sandra has shown in years.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I got it, Sandra.

text: falls onto the bed.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: You’re scaring me.
text: Mavis weeps, sniffling into Matt’s T-shirt.
speaker_heading: MAVIS

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You're very lovable.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: You don’t love me.
speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: My dress is ruined.
text: She reaches down and PULLS OFF her stained dress in one

text: underwear. Matt shrinks away.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Let me get you a shirt...
text: Mavis kneels there, staring at him, not trying to cover

speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: I want your shirt.
text: Matt looks down at his Hanes Beefy Tee.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I don’t know if athletic grey is
dialog: your color.

text: removes his shirt and hands it to Mavis.
text: Mavis holds the shirt against her body for a moment, then
text: lays it aside.
dialog: Matt is not the type of guy who feels comfortable without
text: a shirt. His arms are crossed.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: You hide me.
text: She reaches for Matt. He can’t help but reach back,
text: partially to embrace her, but also so they both feel less
text: naked. They hug tightly, obscuring each other’s bare
text: chests.
text: It’s Matt, surprisingly, who tips Mavis down onto her
text: back. He buries his face into her hair.
text: From underneath, Mavis helps Matt take off his pants. She

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: MAVIS
