scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT
text: BLACK TREE LIMBS spread against a less-black sky. The STARS
text: beyond are vast and dim. BATS dip and wheel chaotically. We
text: can hear their wings: a desperate-sounding chk chk chk.
text: RUTH KIMKE (38) stares up at them, very still, very uneasy.
text: She has a watchful, owlish vibe. She’s slightly wall-eyed.
text: Her hair is long and plain and she appears fearfully
text: hypnotized by the bats. Or maybe it’s the stars.
text: She tips a BEER up, nearly kills it without blinking.
text: WIDER, we see her yard: a weedy little square enclosed by a
text: tall rickety fence. MUSIC and VOICES drift faintly from
text: elsewhere, some other yard. Somebody SHRIEKS in delight.
text: Ruth looks in that direction, all alone back here.
text: She glances down at her hand...which is SHAKING.
text: Then back to the dark sky as an OMINOUS TONE sounds and we--
text: CUT TO BLACK.
text: TELEVISED IMAGES fill the screen, pixelated and washed-out,
text: with SOFT HAPPY ELEVATOR MUSIC eating all the sound:
text: A huge TRASH ISLAND bobs in the ocean. SOLDIERS fire machine
text: guns in the Middle East. A WHITE COP clubs a BLACK KID.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - CARE CENTER - DAY
text: PULLING OUT from the T.V. as Ruth enters in pink scrubs,
text: eyeing it before addressing the person at which it’s aimed.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: How ‘bout I change this, huh?
text: It’s MRS. HAMBLE in the bed, ninety if she’s a day. Skeletal
text: and unblinking. Oh shit...she might be dead already.
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT’D)
dialog: Mrs. Hamble?
text: She moves to the bedside, fearing the worst, but--
speaker_heading: MRS. HAMBLE
dialog: (a weak rasp)
dialog: ...look at these goddamn monkeys...
text: So instead Ruth adjusts the covers, the fluid drip.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: No, now...shh.
speaker_heading: MRS. HAMBLE
dialog: ..-if my husband Wilson Kenneth
dialog: Hamble ever lived to see the way
dialog: they managed to flush this country
dialog: right down the fuckin stinker, he'd
dialog: like to never stop throwing up, you
dialog: never heard a bigger helping of
dialog: shit in all the years of woe-is-me,
dialog: God o’ mighty, put the chicken and
dialog: hubcaps down and keep your gigantic
dialog: monkey dick outta my good pussy...
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Okay, now. Just. Okay.
speaker_heading: MRS. HAMBLE
dialog: .--Christ help us...
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: MRS. HAMBLE
dialog: ...why won’t nobody fuck me good?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Shh. C’mon, now.
text: But then, as she works, the silence prompts her to look.
text: Mrs. Hamble has gone slack. Actually dead this time.
scene_heading: INT. WAITING AREA - CARE CENTER - DAY
text: Ruth and a DOCTOR stand with MRS. HAMBLE’S SON, other crying
text: FAMILY in the background.
speaker_heading: SON
dialog: Did...did she have any last words?
text: The Doctor looks to Ruth for the answer. She considers.
text: TITLE CARD LANDS WITH A LOW THROBBING BOOOM.
dialog: 
text: TRAFFIC NOISE, VOICES, COMMERCIAL JINGLES: a din of shrill
text: anxiety. As SPARSE MINOR-KEY MUSIC tip-toes into the mix...
scene_heading: EXT. RUTH’S CAR (MOVING) - DAY
text: .+.we see Ruth through the windshield of her ancient JUNKER,
text: a rusty ‘76 Ventura. Inching along. Her mind elsewhere.
text: VEHICLES wipe the foreground, blurs, endlessly blocking her.
speaker_heading: NEWS RADIO (V.O.)
dialog: .»..and the Governor calling it ‘a
text: horrific but ultimately unpreventable
dialog: tragedy’ after the schizophrenic man
dialog: brought his registered AR-15 into the day
text: care and opened fire. Sports is next.
text: Up ahead, a DAY-GLO PICKUP belches a BLACK SMOKE from its
text: dual smokestacks onto the other cars. Rollin’ coal.
text: She's quietly mystified.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
text: Hard sunlight blasts off of chrome and glass. Ruth moves
text: through this maze of cars, preoccupied. She wears jeans,
text: sneakers, an old baseball shirt. Has her own shopping bag.
text: A MINIVAN backs out, nearly clips her but stops short. She
text: waits, gestures go ahead. Which the minivan is happy to do.
scene_heading: INT. GROCERY AISLE - DAY
text: A SLOPPY MAN drops a bag of chips, leaves it on the ground.
text: Ruth comes along in his wake and, without thinking, bends
text: down to put them back on the shelf.
scene_heading: INT. ‘15 ITEMS OR FEWER’ CHECKOUT LINE - DAY
text: Ruth waits patiently with her rotisserie chicken behind a
text: TIRED WOMAN who’s stacking thirty or forty items on the belt.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE BAR - DAY
text: An OLDIE purrs on the juke (“Hully Gully Calling Time” by The
text: Jive Five!) as we PUSH DOWN THE BAR to find...
text: Ruth, sitting by herself at the far end of with a beer and
text: her chicken dinner, absorbed in a FANTASY NOVEL.
text: Someone LAUGHS and she looks up.
text: Down the bar, a cluster of YOUNG DUDES, bullshitting amongst
text: themselves. But ONE of them is looking at her, kinda smiling.
text: Back to her book. A moment later, he’s still looking at her.
speaker_heading: YOUNG DUDE
dialog: Is that the Elsewhere Saga?
text: She straightens, smiles in spite of herself.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Yeah. ‘King of the Hidden Dark.’
speaker_heading: YOUNG DUDE
dialog: Book two. Read those a while ago.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I’m at the, they’re getting ready
dialog: for the Battle of the uh--
speaker_heading: YOUNG DUDE
dialog: Battle of the Tanhauser Gate?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Right! I’m like...
dialog: She makes a face: biting my nails!
speaker_heading: YOUNG DUDE
dialog: Totally. Yeah. So good.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You know her father’s actually the
dialog: War Mage.
text: Ruth’s smile stays absolutely in place.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Captain Deo is...?
speaker_heading: YOUNG DUDE
dialog: Kieran’s real father. Yeah. That’s
dialog: coming up. Blew my mind.
dialog: And stays in place.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: YOUNG DUDE
dialog: Clues were there, y’think about it.
text: And with that, he returns to his buddies.
text: Ruth looks down at the bar top, but not quite at her book.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT YARD - RUTH’S HOUSE - DAY
text: Ruth pulls into the driveway of her tiny RANCH HOUSE. Heading
text: inside, she sees something in the patchy yard that stops her.
text: A PIZZA FLYER tucked in her door is angrily yanked out. Fft!
text: THE DOG TURD on her grass is grabbed using the flyer. Splrt.
text: HER TRASH CAN has many such dog shit/pizza flyer wads already
dialog: in it and here’s one more. Wump! Slam!
text: THE SMALL HANDMADE SIGN on her lawn--a dog shit inside a red
text: circle-slash with ‘PLEASE!'--is angrily straightened.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT ROOM - RUTH’S HOUSE - DAY
text: Ruth heels the door shut, drops her book on a side table.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: THE FRIDGE OPENS, leftover chicken goes in, a beer comes out.
text: Ruth leans against the counter, pops the beer, takes a sip. A
text: dim, quiet little house. A little cluttered but not dirty.
text: SLOWLY PUSHING IN as she stares grimly at nothing. There’s a
text: soft repetitive bmp bmp bmp somewhere. But then...
text: Her eyes land on something and she stiffens. That bmp bmp bmp
text: seems louder suddenly. She moves forward, confused because...
text: HER BACK DOOR IS AJAR. She touches it as if to confirm what
text: she’s seeing. BMP BMP BMP. Just beyond is--
scene_heading: INT. SUN ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: --this small glassed-in porch, with its own BACK DOOR which
text: also hangs wide open, bumping against the house. BMP BMP BMP.
text: She steps out there, breathing faster as she peers out into--
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS
text: --which is empty. Somewhere distantly a LAWN MOWER buzzes, a
text: DOG barks. But nobody in sight. She pulls the door shut--
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: --and comes back through the SUN ROOM into the house where
text: she GASPS, her hands flying to her mouth because--
text: --she sees for the first time that SHE’S BEEN RANSACKED. All
text: drawers pulled out of her credenza, the contents spilled.
text: She gapes, immobilized. But before she can decide what to do--
text: Sktch. A soft noise. She freezes. Whatwasthat?
text: DOWN THE HALLWAY, the opened BEDROOM DOOR spills sunlight.
text: She stares at it, perfectly still, her eyes bright with fear.
text: CLOSER ON THE BEDROOM DOOR, sunny, quiet...but then a wisp of
text: shadow moves in there.
text: At that, she INHALES sharply and takes a reflexive step
text: backwards but...she stops. And her lips curl from her teeth.
text: Without taking her eyes off the hallway--
text: HER HAND slides off a KITCHEN KNIFE from the rack. Sksshh!
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Ruth advances slowly, the KNIFE held before her, SHAKING.
text: THE BEDROOM DOOR looms ahead...a shadow moves again.
text: She's terrified....yet inches forward, vibrating.
text: She leeeeans in, millimeter by millimeter, to peer into...
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: .--which is empty. Some DRAWERS have been opened and pawed
dialog: through but there’s nobody here.
text: Just outside the WINDOW, a LOOSE GUTTER dangles there in the
text: breeze: that's the shadow. Just to be sure she peeks into--
text: THE BATHROOM, which is also empty, but the MEDICINE CABINET
text: is opened, the contents wiped out onto the floor.
text: Her fight-or-flight tension uncoils itself. Exhaaale.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: The fuck, man.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - SAME
text: GLOVED HANDS brush BLACK FINGERPRINT POWDER onto the medicine
text: cabinet door. Psh, psh, psh.
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Various prescription medications...
scene_heading: INT. SUN ROOM - SAME
text: GLOVED HANDS peel LIFT TAPE from the powder-dusted DOORKNOB.
dialog: Shkk.
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
text: A laptop computer...
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - SAME
text: A PHOTOGRAPHIC FLASH strobes her ransacked credenza. Klik!
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: And then the silverware in here...
text: This is a UNIFORMED OFFICER who couldn’t appear more bored as
text: she jots this all down on a clipboard and pops her gum.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Anything else?
text: Ruth is kind of hugging herself with her PHONE in one hand.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I don’t uh...not that I can see.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The silver was my grandma's.
text: The Officer ignores that. Pop.
speaker_heading: BENDIX (0.S.)
dialog: Were they painkillers?
text: Ruth looks over to DETECTIVE BENDIX (50s), who could use a
text: nap, inspecting the back door as an EVIDENCE TECH wraps up.
speaker_heading: BENDIX (CONT'D)
dialog: The medications.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: No, it was uh...Clonazepam.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And Lexapro.
text: He looks at her blankly, sucks his teeth.
speaker_heading: BENDIX
dialog: You try one of those location apps?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (gesturing with her phone)
dialog: I tried that. The laptop was off.
speaker_heading: BENDIX
dialog: They'll probably wipe it, anyway,
dialog: unless they’re morons. Got a hide-a-
dialog: key? Fake rock thing?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BENDIX
dialog: That gate to your backyard, there’s
dialog: no lock on that?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: No, it’s just...like a latch.
speaker_heading: BENDIX
dialog: (re: the back door)
dialog: You leave this unlocked, you go
dialog: out?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Mmno. Not usually.
speaker_heading: BENDIX
dialog: But you did today.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I don’t remember. I thought I’d
dialog: locked it, but...
speaker_heading: BENDIX
dialog: Wasn’t a forced entry, I mean.
text: Ruth has no answer for that. Bendix and the Officer exchange
text: a bland look and Officer lowers her clipboard.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT YARD - RUTH’S HOUSE - TWILIGHT
text: Ruth comes outside, clutching a REPORT FORM, watching as--
text: Bendix heads to his UNMARKED CAR and the UNIFORMS head to the
text: PATROL UNIT with its LIGHTS TURNING.
dialog: Pink (mm/dd/yyyy) 9.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: What should I do now?
text: Bendix turns back, perplexed.
speaker_heading: BENDIX
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I mean...do you call me, or...?
speaker_heading: BENDIX
dialog: If anything is recovered, someone
dialog: will be in contact. Your case
dialog: number’s on that form if you have
dialog: renter’s insurance.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: But you’re gonna look, right?
text: He looks as if she spit on his shoe.
speaker_heading: BENDIX
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: You’re...gonna look?
speaker_heading: BENDIX
dialog: Miss, we'll do everything we're
dialog: able to but in the meantime I
dialog: suggest you pay a little closer
dialog: attention to your home security.
dialog: Lot of this kind of thing going on,
dialog: drug people and whatnot. Don’t give
dialog: ‘em an opening.
text: He continues on. She glances at the report in her hand.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Thank you.
text: He gives a tight little smile as he gets into his car.
text: THE PATROL CAR LIGHTS switch off as it pulls away and Ruth
text: stands there in the half-light, watching them go.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT ROOM - SAME
text: Ruth comes back in, closes the door. Locks the deadbolt, too.
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - SAME
text: She kneels to clean up the DRAWERS...but finds herself
text: staring down that SHADOWY HALLWAY. Looks like a tomb.
text: She brings out her phone, dials hurriedly.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hey. I’m not bothering you, am I?
scene_heading: INT. A DIFFERENT BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON RUTH, staring off in heavy contemplation. Simmering.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: It’s the violation, man. The stuff,
dialog: that’s replaceable--I mean, the
dialog: silver’s not but what really hurts
dialog: is the fucking violation. They were
dialog: inside my house, you know?
text: She's talking to JANA, who is six, in bed, in her pajamas.
speaker_heading: JANA
dialog: Can we...finish the story?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Sorry.
text: Ruth, sitting at Jana’s bedside, re-opens the PICTURE BOOK
text: she’s holding, “Our Universe”, and begins to read...
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT’D)
text: Rays from the sun are thousands of
dialog: years old before they reach your
text: eyes. Human bodies are made of dust
text: and gasses from inside of stars.
dialog: The universe is fourteen billion
dialog: years old. No one knows what came
dialog: before. No one knows how big the
dialog: universe actually is. It...it could
dialog: be infinite--
text: And she starts SOBBING, just totally dissolves.
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus...
dialog: And that in turn terrifies Jana--
speaker_heading: JANA
dialog: W-why are you crying?
dialog: 11.
text: --and now they’re BOTH CRYING, a perfect storm of CRYING.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: The fuck kinda book is this?
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - ANGIE’S HOUSE - A BIT LATER
text: Abrupt silence as ANGIE HUFF (40) slides out of JANA’S
text: BEDROOM, pulling the door closed behind her and looking at--
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN AREA - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Ruth, spent and red-eyed but composed now, drooping in
text: contrition as she sees Angie returning--
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I’m sorry.
dialog: --who gestures no problem (even though we can see that it was
text: kind of a problem) and waves her to the couch.
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: She's fine. Don’t worry.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I’m so sorry.
text: Ruth sits, preoccupied and distressed, as Angie packs a BOWL--
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: A fucked-up thing happened to you.
dialog: You’re allowed to be upset.
text: --which she is just about to hit when--
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: It’s not that.
text: And so Angie lowers the bowl, sensing an impending deluge.
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: What uh...what is it?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Patient died today. I was in the
dialog: room. She was there and then...she
dialog: wasn’t.
text: Angie passes the bowl and Ruth hits it, deep-deep-deep.
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: Oh. She was special, huh?
text: Ruth holds the hit, thinking hard.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (a burp of smoke)
dialog: No. She sucked.
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: This old...shithead...
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: Uh huh.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: ..-bat...
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 12.
text: Angie takes the bowl back, hits it herself, settling in for--
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (a dreamy stream)
dialog: But it just kinda clicked. It
dialog: doesn't matter. They’1l roll her
dialog: into a cooker and then she'll be
dialog: smoke. Just carbon and stuff. My
dialog: grandma Sally--that was her silver
dialog: they took--she was a war nurse. She
dialog: literally breathed life into people
dialog: who'd been exploded. Spent her
dialog: retirement bringing dinner to shut-
dialog: ins, folks with cancer...
text: (Angie exhales a long patient jet of smoke.)
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT’D)
dialog: ...and then she had a stroke and
dialog: was just carbon and stuff, too.
dialog: Exactly the same. And now I’m the
dialog: only one left who remembers any of
dialog: that and pretty soon I'll be carbon
dialog: and stuff, too...so none of it
dialog: matters. You could be a saint, you
dialog: could be awful, whatever, it’s like
dialog: none of it happened.
text: Angie eyes Ruth in concern (and a splash of exasperation.)
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: First of all, not pretty soon. Not
dialog: for a long time. And it does
dialog: matter. She did happen.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: We have to pretend that or we’ll go
text: crazy. But everything is dying, at
dialog: all times. Everyone. Us. Even Jana,
dialog: right now. The minute she was born
dialog: she started dying--
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: Jesus Christ--
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: The planet's coming apart. You got
dialog: that, right?
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: (‘I'ma have another hit’)
dialog: Right, right--
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: All the bees? And the gorillas are
text: almost gone, too. Something like
text: ten gorillas left.
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: It’s more than that.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Twenty? Tops? Look at how people
dialog: treat each other, the, the, the
dialog: taking. The fucking taking, y'know?
dialog: The cruelty and the taking and the,
dialog: the, ‘Mine, mine, fuck you, mine.’
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: You're gonna make yourself sick.
dialog: (choosing her words now)
dialog: You've got it better than a lot of
dialog: people. You have to see that.
dialog: You're healthy. You got a job. You
dialog: got a house.
text: But Ruth is wholly committed to the despair...
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I see it. Everyone is an asshole.
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: No, not everyone--
dialog: On Angie:
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Yes. Everyone. And dildos.
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: That’s not true.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: It is true. And fuckfaces.
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: Ruthie--
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I mean, not you. And Dan’s okay.
dialog: And kids are fine unless they're,
dialog: like, real little shit-kids and I
dialog: think lot of them just come like
dialog: that now. Assholes and fuckfaces
dialog: and so what? It’s all just a
dialog: sneeze. It’s nothing. Y’know? It’s
dialog: just chemistry and math. So what.
dialog: what do I say to that? A little helplessly...
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: Sweetie....c’mon.
text: Ruth looks at her SHAKING HAND. She makes a fist to stop it.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (barely audible)
dialog: Sometimes I feel like I’m
text: underneath a whirlpool...and it’s
dialog: like I can’t even breathe.
text: KEYS at the door precede DAN HUFF (40s) lumbering obliviously
text: in. A harried car salesman, he clocks the gloomy vibe--
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Internet date?
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: Ruth’s house got robbed.
text: --and without pausing he continues to THE KITCHEN AREA.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Whaaat? That’s terrible...
text: Where he pointedly opens a window, giving Angie a look about
dialog: the pot smoke: come on. She gives him one back: not now.
text: Ruth starts to CRY again. Angie pats her. Dan sighs at all
text: this and concentrates on his leftover ham sandwich. Chomp.
dialog: 15.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - EARLY MORNING
text: CLOSE ON RUTH, curled on the couch under a quilt, semi-awake.
text: A SMALL HAND holds a sheet of PAPER before her. She props
dialog: herself up to look at it...
text: A CHILD'S DRAWING: a WOMAN riding a BIG GREEN LIZARD-THING.
text: Jana stands there, solemnly gnawing on a magic marker.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Is this me?
text: Jana nods.
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT’D)
dialog: Is this a dragon?
speaker_heading: JANA
dialog: Stegosaurus.
text: Ruth considers it some more.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I fuckin’ love it.
scene_heading: EXT. RUTH’S CAR (MOVING) - DAY
text: VAGUELY TENSE MUSIC skitters in the background as Ruth
text: drives, her eyes fixed dead ahead.
scene_heading: EXT. RUTH’S HOUSE - DAY
text: She pulls into the driveway, heads for the door, but stops.
text: And stares down at her lawn. Anger crackles on her face.
text: There is, indeed, a fucking DOG TURD. Right next to the sign.
text: She whirls in place, looking up and down--
text: THE STREET, where a few houses down there she can see A MAN
text: walking away with a DOG on a leash.
text: A FRESH PIZZA FLYER is snatched from her door handle. SKTCH!
scene_heading: INT. STREET - SAME
text: TIGHT ON THE DOG MAN, seen from behind: his HOODIE with the
text: METALLIC COBRA on the back.
dialog: Pink (mm/dd/yyyy) 16.
text: HIS DOG struts along beside him. If a dog can look dumb, this
dialog: one surely does.
text: HIS WATER SANDALS go sk! sk! sk! on the pavement beneath the
text: camo cut-offs he’s wearing.
text: HIS SODA POP gets slurped as he walks. He’s maybe 30, froggy,
text: and we can hear the HEAVY METAL in his HEADPHONES.
text: TRACKING WITH HIM so we can see Ruth SPRINTING up behind him,
text: clutching a FLYER/DOG SHIT WAD.
text: The Dog Man is unaware, his HEADPHONE MUSIC drowning
text: everything out, even as Ruth gets within ten paces and--
text: HURLS THE WAD AT HIS HEAD. It misses by a mile--wump!--but he
text: turns to see her there behind him, hunched and fuming.
text: They face off like gunfighters.
speaker_heading: DOG MAN
dialog: Why’d you do that?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: You've been shitting in my yard.
speaker_heading: DOG MAN
dialog: I have not.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Your dog. I saw you. I have a sign
dialog: there, says No Shitting.
speaker_heading: DOG MAN
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (pointing furiously)
dialog: Right there, man!
speaker_heading: DOG MAN
dialog: It says that?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: It’s a picture but that’s what it
dialog: means!
speaker_heading: DOG MAN
dialog: Well...I didn’t see it.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: YOU SHOULDN'T NEED A SIGN! WHAT’S
dialog: WRONG WITH YOU?
dialog: 17.
text: Ruth glares. Dog Man frowns. The dog pants happily. Finally--
speaker_heading: DOG MAN
dialog: Fine.
text: And he trudges away, slower. Sk. Sk. Sk. Pausing to pick up
text: the flyer wad as he goes.
text: Ruth watches him go. Utterly astonished. She looks down at--
text: HER HAND, which is as steady as can be.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT ROOM - RUTH’S HOUSE - DAY
text: Ruth strides to her STEREO and drops on an OLD SOUL BOOGIE
dialog: (let’s say "Twine Time” by Alvin Cash & The Crawlers) which
dialog: carries us through--
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - SAME
text: Ruth SCRUBBING hard at the sticky FINGERPRINT POWDER RESIDUE.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - SAME
text: Ruth GATHERING the spilled leftover medicine items.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - SAME
text: Ruth SLIDING the spilled drawers back into place.
scene_heading: INT. SUN ROOM - SAME
text: Ruth DRILLING a BRASS SLIDING BOLT onto the screen door.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - SAME
text: CLOSE ON THE POLICE REPORT, snatched off the table.
text: THE BUSINESS CARD stapled to the corner of it, Sgt. William
text: Bendix - Robbery Fraud Unit, is ripped off.
text: THE BOOGIE ABRUPTLY BECOMES ‘HOLD MUSIC’ as we...
text: SLOWLY PUSH IN ON RUTH, sitting at the table with her phone
text: to her ear. She waits. And waits. Eventually...
speaker_heading: BENDIX (PHONE V.O.)
dialog: Robbery.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Mr. Bendix?
speaker_heading: BENDIX (PHONE V.O.)
dialog: This is Detective Bendix.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Um. This is Ruth Kimke.
text: The silence booms.
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT’D)
dialog: My house was--
speaker_heading: BENDIX (PHONE V.O.)
dialog: I remember you, Ms. Kimke, what can
dialog: I do for you?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I was just calling to follow up
dialog: on...I was curious if there were
dialog: any...”suspects” or whatever yet.
speaker_heading: BENDIX (PHONE V.O.)
dialog: Suspects?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: The matter at my house yesterday.
speaker_heading: BENDIX (PHONE V.O.)
dialog: No, I understand what you meant,
dialog: I'm--just a minute--
text: There’s a MUFFLED CONVERSATION, he’s distracted.
speaker_heading: BENDIX (PHONE V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry, it's very...Look, I
dialog: assure you we're going to take
dialog: every uh...all possible avenues.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I thought maybe if you came back in
dialog: daylight and looked around a little
dialog: closer you could--
text: An aggravated SIGH blows through the line...
speaker_heading: BENDIX (PHONE V.O.)
dialog: Could I put you on hold a moment?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Sure.
dialog: Pink (mm/dd/yyyy) 19.
text: The HOLD MUSIC comes back on and she listens to it a
text: bit...until it stops. Silence.
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT’D)
dialog: Hello?
text: VERY CLOSE ON HER by now, looking down at the dead phone. We
text: can see her jaw muscles clenching. Her wheels turning.
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - DAY
text: Ruth walks to the center of the yard to look at the BACK DOOR
text: from a distance. Contemplates it.
text: She goes to the SIDE GATE, which leads back here from the
text: front. Looks closely.
text: The LATCH is rusted shut. She tries it but, no, it’s stuck.
text: She scans the yard. Walks along the FENCE LINE, scanning.
text: At the REAR FENCE, she stops suddenly. Looking at--
text: A CERTAIN SPOT where a patch of honeysuckle is ripped loose.
text: She touches it, dangling there, the flowers still fresh.
text: She looks straight down and sees something that freezes her.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEYWAY BEHIND HER HOUSE - SAME
text: Ruth’s FINGERS clamp the top of the fence and then, with a
text: GRUNT of effort, her HEAD appears, peeking over to see...
text: A LOOSE BOARD has been propped against the fence on this
text: side. Like a ramp.
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - SAME
text: She drops back down to her side again, looking down at--
text: THE FOOTPRINT she noticed in the soft earth right there.
text: She stares at it like it’s a snake.
scene_heading: INT. AISLE - ART STORE - DAY
text: Ruth moves purposefully along, scanning the shelves of--
text: VARIOUS CRAFT SUPPLIES, clay, paper mache, plaster strips.
dialog: Pink (mm/dd/yyyy) 20.
scene_heading: INT. CHECKOUT LINE - ART STORE - DAY
text: Ruth and a SULLEN TEENAGER get there at the same moment, but
text: Ruth defers, ‘After you’, holding a PACKAGE OF PLASTER.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: Ruth whisks WHITE POWDER and WATER in a bowl. Wk!wk!wk!wk!wk!
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - DAY
text: LIQUID PLASTER is poured into the FOOTPRINT.
text: Ruth waits. Bugs BUZZ. She bites a nail. Glances at the sky,
text: tentatively, like she might see something terrible there.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: Less-than-impressed, Ruth looks down at--
text: THE PLASTER FOOTPRINT MOLD she’s made: terribly misshapen and
text: crusted with dirt. Looks like a burnt jellyfish.
text: But looking closer she discerns A FLAT STRIPE ACROSS THE
text: SOLE, the tread pattern interrupted for two inches. Weird.
text: And its unusual LIGHTNING BOLT LOGO is visible in relief.
scene_heading: EXT. RUTH’S HOUSE - DAY
text: Ruth comes outside, WALKS RIGHT INTO CAMERA, Cape Fear-style,
text: looks up and down the block...
text: ...and EXITS FRAME as that same SOUL BOOGIE kicks back in
scene_heading: LOUD. (We can call it RUTH’S ACTION THEME from now on.)
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: TRACKING BESIDE RUTH, propelled by HER THEME though this
text: LOWER MIDDLE CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD: small houses in need of
text: paint, chain link fences, old trucks. She turns up to--
scene_heading: EXT. SHABBY BUNGALOW - CONTINUOUS
text: Nok-nok! AN OLD MAN sucking on a squeeze yogurt appears
text: behind the screen door, squinting out at her.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Yah?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I’m sorry to bother you, sir. I’m
dialog: your neighbor over there. My house
dialog: was robbed yesterday.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Sonsabitches.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Yeah. It was sometime between nine
dialog: and six thirty, I don’t suppose you
dialog: saw anything?
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Well, I’11 tell you something...
text: But instead he just takes a long slurp of his yogurt, kinda
text: loses his thought. She waits patiently.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: (‘this?’)
dialog: It’s just regular yogurt you can
dialog: sip on.
speaker_heading: (SLURRP!)
dialog: .--hey, fuck it...
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: What did you want to tell me?
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Oh. It’s all going to hell.
text: Ruth smiles tightly in thanks and heads off.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN (0.S.) (CONT’D)
dialog: You know that, dontcha?
scene_heading: EXT. DUPLEX - DAY
text: Now it’s a YOUNG MOTHER with her BABY on her hip.
dialog: Pink (mm/dd/yyyy) 22.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MOTHER
dialog: I don’t know nothing about no
dialog: robbery.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Maybe you saw a strange car. Or
text: someone acting furtive.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MOTHER
dialog: Furtive?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Sneaky.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MOTHER
dialog: I know what furtive is. I’m sorry
dialog: that happened but I don’t know
dialog: anything to tell you.
text: Ruth nods, disappointed, and looks at the baby.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: What’s her name?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MOTHER
dialog: Khaleesi.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (tired but genuine)
dialog: That’s beautiful.
scene_heading: EXT. JUNK HOUSE - DAY
text: Now it’s a GEARHEAD with CAR PARTS and TRASH strewn about his
text: yard, wiping his hands and wolfishly looking her up and down.
speaker_heading: GEARHEAD
dialog: Suspicious?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Or just, like, out of place.
speaker_heading: GEARHEAD
dialog: Oh, for sure. Just this mornin’ a
text: Dominican fella came ‘round with a
dialog: tree saw and a push mower. Told’m,
dialog: ‘I can take care my own lawn,
dialog: thanks, but good try.’ He knew to
dialog: keep moving.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I bet.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: GEARHEAD
dialog: You could gimme your number. If I
dialog: thinka something.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (turning to leave)
dialog: You won’t.
text: But her ACTION THEME is sounding echoey and distant by now...
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE STREET - DAY
text: Ruth rounds the corner, uncertainly. Unfamiliar territory.
scene_heading: EXT. OVERGROWN HOUSE - DAY
text: She crosses the jungle yard, comes up the porch, nok-noks on
text: the door. There’s no answer but...
text: .+.-she can hear SHREDDING HAIR METAL wafting from the back.
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - OVERGROWN HOUSE - SAME
text: She comes around the side of the house, where the METAL is
text: louder and tied to savage CARDIO EXHALATIONS...
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: One--get some! Two--get some! Three-
dialog: -get some! Unh! Four--get some!
text: IN THE OUT-OF-FOCUS FOREGROUND we discern SOMEONE on a WEIGHT
text: BENCH, rhythmically lifting the PRESS BAR as--
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Excuse me?
text: TIGHT ON THE LIFTER’S HAND, as the exhalations stop, reaching
dialog: for his, no, not his NUNCHUCKS there, for his TOWEL...
text: ..-which he wipes his sweaty face with as he sits up. Look
text: who it is: the Dog Man himself, who is in fact named TONY.
text: Mutual recognition. A charged and awkward beat.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I said I was sorry.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: You said ‘fine.’
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: The implication being--
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Nevermind.
text: She turns away but he stops the MUSIC--
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: No, wait up...
text: --and approaches, showing his palms. Ultra sincere, this guy.
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: Look. That's not me. Leaving a B.M.
dialog: in your yard? That’s not who I am.
dialog: I...I was embarrassed. Sometimes
dialog: I’m just so into my thoughts, you
dialog: know? Like, deep. And I won’t even
text: notice what Brian's doing.
text: He tips his head towards the WINDOW, where the DOG who must
text: be named Brian is watching them, calmly panting.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (turning to go)
dialog: Forget it.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You can hit me.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (stopping)
dialog: What? No.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: One strike. To balance the energy
dialog: between us. I won’t defend myself.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I don’t like hitting people.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I’m a very physical person. That’s
dialog: just how I experience the world.
dialog: Action, reaction. Cause,
dialog: consequence. Pain isn’t real.
text: A brief beat and she starts to leave again but--
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: So why are you here?
text: She stops again, shrugs in defeat.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: My house got robbed.
text: Tony’s face clouds over.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Yesterday.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Did you call the authorities?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Yeah, they...I dunno. It didn’t
dialog: seem like they could do very much.
dialog: So I was just asking around, if
dialog: anyone saw anyone.
text: He seethes in place and then, all at once...
text: HE GRABS HIS NUNCHUCKS AND--KASH!--SMASHES A MOSQUITO CANDLE.
text: Ruth JUMPS and Brian starts BARKING furiously in the window.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (Chinese for “quiet”)
dialog: An jing! An jing!
dialog: (and to Ruth now)
dialog: That makes me furious.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Y-yeah.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: What kind of person does that?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I dunno.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: What’d they take?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: My computer. My grandma's silver--
text: KASH! HE SMASHES AGAIN, RE-INFURIATED.
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT'D)
dialog: (retreating)
dialog: Sorry I bothered you.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You didn’t bother me, this affects
dialog: all of us--BRIAN. STOP IT.
text: But Brian is only BARKING louder as Ruth scoots away...
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Okay. See ya.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Can I do anything?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Nah, uh, I’m good, thanks...
text: She slinks away around the house and Tony watches her go.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT ROOM - RUTH’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: A MELANCHOLY COUNTRY TUNE plays. A BEER sweats on a coaster.
text: Ruth sits curled on the couch, reading her NOVEL. She turns a
text: page but...lets it close. Staring off, disinterested.
text: As if as an afterthought, she brings out--
text: HER PHONE, on which she taps a CERTAIN APP: Loc8. She logs in
text: but gets a PROCESS WHEEL turning, endlessly. ‘Searching...’
text: So she tosses the phone aside in disgust.
text: She rises. Sips. Paces a slow circle...which becomes swaying
text: to the MUSIC. Like dancing. A private, lonesome moment.
text: B-Bing! She looks to HER PHONE, which is suddenly glowing.
text: She picks it up, stares at the screen, amazed.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Holy shit.
text: ON HER PHONE, a RED DOT blinks on a MAP SCREEN. ‘Device
dialog: Online’, it says, ‘129 Grove St.’
text: HER POLICE REPORT, with Bendix’s card, is snatched--ssk!
text: She hurriedly dials a number but--
speaker_heading: BENDIX VOICEMAIL (V.O.)
dialog: You've reached Detective Bendix
dialog: with the Robbery Fraud. I'm not
dialog: available now but if you'1ll--
dialog: 27.
text: She disconnects, blinking, and quickly dials another number--
speaker_heading: POLICE OPERATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Police non-emergency.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Hello. Yes. Okay. It’s--my case
dialog: number is zero-zero-zero--
speaker_heading: POLICE OPERATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Just a second, ma'am, what's the--?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: No, it’s--I can see right where it
dialog: is. My computer was stolen and I
text: can see it.
speaker_heading: POLICE OPERATOR
dialog: So it's not stolen?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: No, it’s still stolen, my phone is
dialog: saying where it is, I have the
dialog: address, someone needs to go there
text: before it turns off again and--
speaker_heading: POLICE OPERATOR
dialog: We can include that information in
dialog: the report but we can't send units
dialog: out at this time. Would you like to-
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Wait--what? Why?
speaker_heading: POLICE OPERATOR
dialog: They need a search warrant in order
dialog: to--
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: But you don’t have to search, it’s
dialog: right there, I know where it is!
speaker_heading: POLICE OPERATOR
dialog: We cannot send units at this time.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I AM LOOKING AT IT.
speaker_heading: POLICE OPERATOR
dialog: We can include that information in
dialog: the report file--
speaker_heading: RUTH
speaker_heading: UHHFFFF
dialog: 28.
text: She disconnects in unhinged frustration. (Remember how
dialog: Jennifer Grey hung up the phone in Ferris Bueller? Yeah.)
text: She thinks, frantic...until something new occurs to her.
text: Struggling to calm herself a degree or two, she dials again.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - HUFF HOME - SAME
text: CLOSE ON DAN, wincing at the caller ID but answering anyway.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Hey, uh, Angie’s closing tonight.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Oh, actually, I was kinda wondering
dialog: what you were up to?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Me...?
text: He’s crouched next to Jana, who’s in the tub, her entire head
text: covered in shaving cream: two little eyes in a blob of foam.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Doin’ my own time, you know, not
dialog: the institution’s. What’s up?
text: But she has second thoughts.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: It’s...eh, you know what, it’s
dialog: nothing. It’s okay.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Yeah. Yeah. Sorry.
text: Click. Dan looks at his phone, unsure, as the Jana-Blob looks
text: at him and, b-blub, a tiny fart bubble breaks her bath water.
scene_heading: END INTERCUT.
text: CLOSE ON RUTH, breathing faster as the COUNTRY MUSIC morphs
text: into her ACTION THEME which carries over to...
dialog: Pink (mm/dd/yyyy) 29.
scene_heading: EXT. GROVE STREET - NIGHT
text: FROM THE STREET SIGN, ‘Grove Street’, WE TILT DOWN as RUTH’S
text: CAR pulls up with its running lights on.
text: She double-checks HER PHONE, her face eerily green in the
text: screen’s glow, and looks across at--
text: 129 GROVE STREET, a trashed-out party hovel at the end of a
text: GRAVEL DRIVE. YOUNG FOLKS milling in the dark yard. RAP
text: fuzzes from inside, people HOOT and CACKLE down there.
text: RUTH glances up and down THIS BLOCK of dark shabby houses,
text: craggy low-hanging trees, deep shadows. Spooky, all of it.
text: She swallows, returns her attention to--
text: 129 GROVE, where a GIRL now clumsily TWERKS in the yard as
text: SEVERAL BOYS film her with their phones, itching themselves.
text: On Ruth. Hmm.
text: 129 GROVE, where one of the BOYS is now doing PUSH UPS with
text: ANOTHER GIRL balanced on his back, sloshing her drink.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: (distantly)
dialog: Wooooc0e!
text: On Ruth. Hmm.
text: 129 GROVE, where A BOY is arranging a WATERMELON before
text: ANOTHER BOY who is spraying a AEROSOL into a “POTATO GUN” (a
text: homemade contraption of PVC PIPE.)
dialog: On Ruth, Hmmm, just opening her door when--
text: BAM! THEY FIRE THE POTATO GUN AND THE WATERMELON EXPLODES.
text: On Ruth, HOLY SHIT, slamming the door and SPEEDING AWAY.
scene_heading: EXT. TONY’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Tony opens the door. Ruth looks wild-eyed. Fast dialogue--
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I need back-up.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (zero hesitation)
dialog: Okay.
dialog: Pink (mm/dd/yyyy) 30.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: You got those ninja sticks?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Nunchaku is an Okinawan weapon--
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Fine--
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: “Ninjas”, as you call them, are--
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Right, okay--
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I got something better.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Fine. I just--
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Do you know what a morning star is?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I just-- no, I--
speaker_heading: TONY
text: Lights out.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I just need you to ride with me.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Right on.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I’m Ruth.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I’m Tony.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Nice to meet you.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Coooool.
scene_heading: EXT. GROVE STREET - NIGHT
text: RUTH’S CAR pulls up again: Tony is driving now (with Brian
text: panting in the back), Ruth sits shotgun, pointing--
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: There.
text: 129 GROVE, where the party appears to have moved inside. One
text: lone longhair SMOKER lingers by the front door.
text: Tony nods, all business, but then...bows his head, steeples
text: his hands under his chin, WHISPERS to himself.
text: Ruth watches in confusion.
scene_heading: EXT. 129 GROVE STREET - NIGHT
text: ON THE DRIVEWAY, Ruth and Tony walk towards us: kunch kunch
text: kunch on the gravel. He carries a MORNING STAR FLAIL and his
text: BELT BUCKLE contains a THROWING STAR.
text: She looks profoundly anxious as--
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Were you praying?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You asked for help. I asked for
dialog: help. That’s how things get done.
dialog: (with a sidelong smirk)
dialog: Don’t worry...I’m not gonna let
dialog: anything happen to you.
text: TRACKING WITH THEM as they approach the HOUSE. Up ahead, the
text: SMOKER sees them coming, takes a wary drag.
text: They arrive. A long beat of nobody knowing what to say.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: My computer is inside this house.
speaker_heading: SMOKER
dialog: Say what?
text: She shows him her PHONE with the blinking LOCATION APP but--
speaker_heading: SMOKER (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t know what the fuck that is.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I don’t want trouble. My computer
dialog: was stolen, this says it’s in
dialog: there, I just want it back. No
dialog: questions. Can you please get it?
speaker_heading: SMOKER
dialog: I can get deez nuts.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (perfectly confused)
dialog: You can get these nuts?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Okay, tough guy, you had your
dialog: chance--
dialog: And then this all happens very fast:
text: TONY DROPS INTO A FIGHT STANCE AND SPINS THE MORNING STAR--
text: BUT SMOKER INSTANTLY SNATCHES IT FROM HIS HAND--
text: GRINNING IN VICTORY, SMOKER TRIES TO SPIN THE MORNING STAR
text: BUT--WAK!--CLIPS HIMSELF ACROSS THE NOSE WITH THE METAL BALL-——
speaker_heading: SMOKER
dialog: Guh!
text: SMOKER DROPS THE MORNING STAR, DOUBLES OVER, HANDS FLYING TO
scene_heading: HIS BROKEN NOSE AS BLOOD SQUIRTS FROM BETWEEN HIS FINGERS-—
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Oh God are you--?
text: Smoker staggers inside--
scene_heading: INT. FRONT ROOM - 129 GROVE - CONTINUOUS
text: --where, blinded, he TRIPS and FALLS into a COFFEE TABLE--
text: KRASH!--totally SHATTERING IT.
text: As Smoker lays GROANING on the floor, Ruth and Tony (with the
text: morning star again) come boiling in behind him to see--
text: THREE KIDS (20s) watching FUNNY INJURY VIDEOS on a LAPTOP,
text: all of them suddenly frozen and flabbergasted.
text: A charged beat, everyone coiled and staring at each other as
text: Smoker lies MOANING and BLOODY on the floor.
text: ONE KID (the one doing push ups before) starts to rise--
speaker_heading: PUSH UPS
dialog: What’d you do to Keith?
text: BUT TONY HURLS HIS THROWING STAR--CHNK!--INTO THE WALL.
text: (Admittedly, many, many feet away from the kids.)
speaker_heading: PUSH UPS (CONT’D)
dialog: Dude!
dialog: Pink (mm/dd/yyyy) 33.
text: Tony then brings out an M-80 FIRECRACKER, LIGHTS IT, TOSSES
text: IT DOWN THE HALL (so everyone has to wait an awkward few
dialog: seconds until) K-BAM!
speaker_heading: PUSH UPS (CONT’D) RUTH
dialog: DUDE! STOP! (to Tony, ‘stand down’)
dialog: It's okay.
text: But now the GIRLS are rising in anger (the one who was
dialog: twerking and the one who was going ‘Wooo!')--
scene_heading: wooo GIRL TWERKER
dialog: This is totally Both you ugly motherfuckers
dialog: inappropriate, come in here better drag your shit on
dialog: like this--violence is not outta here ‘fore I get my
dialog: power, you know, it’s, like, keys out n’ fuck you both the
dialog: the absence of-- fuck up--
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: SHUT UP!
text: She doesn’t merely SCREAM this, she fucking ERUPTS: her whole
text: soul vents out. It’s like an E.M.P., everything stops.
text: In the ringing silence, she raises her PHONE like a pistol,
text: slowly, deliberately, and aims it at that laptop...
text: The Kids blink, still paralyzed by her sonic boom.
text: She taps her LOCATION APP and...
text: B-bing! The LAPTOP chimes in response. B-bing! B-bing!
text: At that, Push Ups and the Girls seem to wilt. Busted.
text: Tony shakes his head in disgust. Gotcha.
text: Ruth extends her arm, eyes locked on Push Ups, and as one
text: final YOUTUBE BIKE HORN sounds, she closes the LAPTOP.
text: With ceremonial solemnity, she starts to pull it away but...
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT’D)
dialog: The power cord, please.
text: And so Woo Girl bends down to unplug it, hand her the CORD.
text: Ruth stares at them, sadly. They can barely meet her gaze.
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT’D)
dialog: It doesn’t feel good when people
dialog: you don’t know come into your
dialog: house, does it?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Where’s the silver and the
dialog: medicine?
text: But Push Ups is genuinely confused...
speaker_heading: PUSH UPS
dialog: Uh. There’s some TheraFlu in there
dialog: but no silver. And I didn’t steal
dialog: that, miss. Cost me good money.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: PUSH UPS
dialog: I bought it.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Bought it where?
speaker_heading: PUSH UPS
dialog: Killer Sills.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: PUSH UPS
text: Consignment place out the way.
dialog: Sells everything, real cheap.
speaker_heading: wooo GIRL
dialog: (helpfully)
dialog: She got her first communion
dialog: bracelet there.
text: Twerker holds up her braceleted wrist in confirmation. Ruth
dialog: processes all this, darkly.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: They got silverware there?
dialog: They shrug. I dunno, maybe.
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT’D)
dialog: Write it down.
speaker_heading: PUSH UPS
dialog: Want me to drop a pin or--?
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: No, man. On paper.
text: Shame-faced, Push Ups scribbles on a NAPKIN and hands it to
text: Ruth. She pockets it and, with a final glare, turns to go as--
text: Tony pries his THROWING STAR from the wall. He has to really
text: wiggle it. Takes a while. He finally gets it out and--
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: That's how hard I threw it.
scene_heading: EXT. GRAVEL DRIVE - 129 GROVE - NIGHT
text: RUTH’S ACTION THEME BLASTS, subsuming all sound as RUTH AND
text: TONY STRIDE AWAY IN SLOW MOTION.
text: Her eyes glitter, gulping deep giddy breaths. Weightless.
text: He looks like a kid on Christmas who just got the best toy.
text: Nothing else matters. They share a_look.
text: UP AHEAD, Brian barks noiselessly at them from the back of
text: HER CAR, like he’s cheering racers to a finish line.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT ROOM - RUTH’S HOUSE - NIGHT
scene_heading: NORMAL SOUND & MOTION ABRUPTLY RESUME with some CELEBRATORY
text: CAJUN blasting (gotta be “Hot Chili Mama” by Beausoleil) and--
text: RUTH DANCES an exuberant victory dance with a pint of Beam in
text: one hand: part End Zone shuffle, part go-go shimmy. She’s not
dialog: exactly graceful but her whole heart is in it. Yesss!
text: TONY DANCES with all the rhythm of a motor throwing a piston.
text: He takes a sip of booze, winces, not a big drinker. Brian
text: paces happily between them.
text: From across the room, Ruth smiles at Tony. He smiles back.
text: SLOWLY PULLING BACK FROM THEM until...
text: THE FRONT TABLE enters frame, on which that PLASTER FOOTPRINT
text: MOLD is resting, its LIGHTNING BOLT LOGO plainly visible.
scene_heading: INT. FANCY BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON A RAGGEDY SNEAKER with that very SAME LOGO. And, we
text: might notice, a STRIP OF DUCT TAPE wrapped around it. That
text: flat stripe on the plaster mold.
dialog: Pink (mm/dd/yyyy) 36.
text: PULLING OUT FROM IT as POP MUSIC hums through walls,
text: gradually revealing SOMEONE on the toilet...
text: Except, oh dear, they’re actually atop the FLUSH TANK, their
text: TRACK PANTS down around their ankles: a dreaded Upper Tanker.
text: His name is CHRISTIAN (20): raver threads, chopped peroxide
text: hair, andro-model looks with hateful ice-chip eyes.
text: Someone outside TAPS tentatively on the door.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: (pleasantly)
dialog: Just a sec!
text: He wipes, pulls up his pants, replaces the TANK LID. He runs
text: the faucet (without washing) and rummages through--
text: A JEWELRY BOX, pocketing VALUABLE ITEMS: rings, a necklace.
text: He cuts the faucet. Grins at himself. A crazed vampire grin.
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY —- MCMANSION - SAME
text: Christian emerges wearing his “normal person smile” but the
text: YUPPIE WIFE waiting there is still startled--
speaker_heading: YUPPIE WIFE
text: The guest bathroom is downstairs.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: It was an emergency.
text: Perturbed, she glances into the bathroom as--
text: WE TRACK WITH CHRISTIAN, strolling away, cool as a cucumber.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRS - MCMANSION - CONTINUOUS
text: WE TRACK CHRISTIAN downstairs into MUSIC and PARTY CHATTER.
scene_heading: INT. FIRST FLOOR - MCMANSION - CONTINUOUS
text: A SUBURBAN CROWD with their cocktails and parenting stories:
text: Christian cuts through them like a panther through geese.
text: He’s moving towards the FRONT DOOR but...
text: AHEAD THROUGH THE CROWD, he sees Yuppie Wife pointing him out
dialog: to her HUSBAND, who’s coming this way so--
dialog: 37.
text: Christian does a mellow about-face.
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVEWAY - MCMANSION - SAME
text: Christian rolls out from under the propped-open GARAGE DOOR
dialog: and trots away until--
text: The HUSBAND steps out to block his path, “friendly”.
speaker_heading: HUSBAND
dialog: Hey there.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: (instantly “in character”)
dialog: Oh hey, buddy!
speaker_heading: HUSBAND
dialog: You're a guest of Miranda’s, right?
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: Right. John. You guys have a

speaker_heading: HUSBAND

speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: Ah, from work. She’s been a great
dialog: mentor, I’m learning so much.
text: Husband drops the act, coldly brings out his PHONE.
speaker_heading: YUPPIE HUSBAND
dialog: I want you to stand right there,
dialog: I’m going to call the police.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: Aw, c’mon, man...
text: Christian suddenly notices someone over Husband’s shoulder--
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Oh, good, there you are!
dialog: So Husband looks back but, oops, made ya look--
text: CHRISTIAN LEAPS AT HIM LIKE A FERAL ANIMAL. Husband tries to
text: defend himself but it’s too late, he goes down thrashing.
dialog: 38.
scene_heading: EXT. UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT
text: Christian walks briskly down the block, out of breath. His
text: shirt has a little bit of blood on it.
text: He glances back at the DISTANT VOICES back there...
speaker_heading: VOICES (0.S.)
dialog: Oh my God! Call 911!
text: .+.-and sprints onward to the VAN parked in the shadows.
scene_heading: EXT. SECLUDED LOT - NIGHT
text: THE VAN pulls in, the lights cut off. Christian hops out.
scene_heading: EXT. DARK WOODS - NIGHT
text: The SILHOUETTE of Christian drifts towards us, pausing now to
text: listen, head cocked like a bird.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: Marshall?
text: A SHIMMERING FEMALE FACE glows out of the blackness, briefly
text: illuminated by her cigarette cherry. Her name is DEZ (20s),
text: hippie-child wraith with strange serpentine eyes.
text: She gestures c’mon and melts away in a swirl of smoke.
scene_heading: EXT. THEIR CAMP - NIGHT
text: Dez leads Christian over a ridge to a LOW CLEARING where...
text: A MAN-SHAPE is hunched beside a small CAMPFIRE. Sucking a
text: THIN GLASS PIPE, setting it down with a euphoric exhale.
text: He runs a comb through his greasy hair. Homemade CAT TATTOOS
text: on his hands. This is MARSHALL (50s): maybe a hobo, maybe a
text: ghoul in his ratty car coat and shredded cowboy boots.
text: Dez stretches out on her sleeping bag, watching as...
text: Marshall pats the ground beside him. Christian sits and
text: brings out the STOLEN ITEMS, offers them to Marshall who
text: holds them in the firelight for inspection. He is pleased.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Now we're cooking with gas.
dialog: 39.
text: And Christian, in turn, is pleased. He’s a good puppy. In
text: fact, Marshall literally scratches him under the chin.
text: PUSHING IN ON MARSHALL as he smiles his yellow teeth at Dez.
text: PUSHING IN ON DEZ as she blows smoke, gives him a kissy face.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT ROOM - EARLY NEXT MORNING
text: The CEILING FAN whirs. Ruth rises into frame: peering down
text: through her red-eyed hangover at--
text: Tony, dead asleep on the couch, drooling freely. Snrr.
text: She drops back out of frame again.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: Ruth and Tony quietly eat pancakes. Occasional furtive
text: glances at each other. Forks clink on plates.
text: Brian pants on the floor, looking from one to the other.
text: After a bit, Ruth digs into her pocket, brings out that
text: NAPKIN, stares at it a moment...and slides it across.
text: Slowly chewing, Tony stares at it.
text: SIUS, reads the scribble, RR2 BOX49.
text: He lifts his eyes to hers. He nods one time. She nods back.
scene_heading: EXT. KILLER SILLS’ PLACE - DAY
scene_heading: ON A RURAL ROUTE MAILBOX, ‘19 - SILLS Salvage Consignment’,
text: which we PAN OFF OF as RUTH’S CAR pulls into this DUSTY LOT,
text: parks next to an EMPTY SPOT.
text: Ruth and Tony get out, glance about, and we TRACK WITH THEM
text: past ROWS OF TABLES stacked with all manner of SECOND-HAND
text: JUNK. Hot sun and dust, FLIES buzzing steadily over it all.
text: A handful of SHOPPERS, poor folks with sunburns, quietly pick
text: through old baby clothes and used sewing machines.
text: The nexus of it all is a corroded BARN, its high doors
text: opening into a cave of blackness. As they drift that way...
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (hushed)
dialog: Maybe we should hold hands.
dialog: (off her ‘huh?’ look)
dialog: Like we’re engaged.
text: So, hand in hand now, they approach the BARN. She notes:
text: THE WEIRD SYMBOLS, burned into the transom: porcupine logos
text: and Evil Eyes and Masonic pyramids.
text: A FADED ‘TRUTHER’ POSTER: the burning WIC and ‘Do the Math!’
text: A DISUSED CAROUSEL HORSE leaning against the barn. NOTA REAL
text: HORSE, the hand-scrawled sign informs us.
scene_heading: INT. BARN - KILLER SILLS’ PLACE - SAME
text: As they enter the dim interior, a motion sensor BINGS!
text: KILLER SILLS (80s) lifts his black pebble eyes from the
text: KEYBOARD he’s repairing. A Santa’s Elf gone to seed, he looks
text: permanently startled under his Nick Nolte mugshot hair.
text: FROM ABOVE, Ruth and Tony approach, rows of HIGH SHELVES on
text: either side, full of STUFF like the end of Raiders.
text: TRACKING WITH THEM, scanning the inventory. BIRDS flutter in
text: the rafters. A RACCOON crawls in a corner.
text: Ruth swallows as they near him, puts on an anxious smile.
text: Tony catches this, gives HER HAND a reassuring squeeze.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Good afternoon, sir, uh--
speaker_heading: KILLER SILLS
dialog: You like music?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Mm, sure, everyone likes--
speaker_heading: KILLER SILLS
dialog: (showing the keyboard)
dialog: Five preset tones, 9.38 killa-hertz
dialog: sample rate with three unique demo
dialog: modes: ‘Calypso’, ‘Disco Dance’,
dialog: and ‘Rock n’ Roll’, here...
dialog: Pink (mm/dd/yyyy) 41.
speaker_heading: RUTH TONY
dialog: Oh, wow, it’s great but-- We don’t really need--
text: He hits demo for some 8-BIT CALYPSO with intense eye contact.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: No, thank you--
speaker_heading: KILLER SILLS
dialog: And.
text: He hits demo again, for some FUNKY DISCO, more eye contact.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: No, really, thank you, but--
speaker_heading: KILLER SILLS
dialog: Annnd.
dialog: But this time it’s a BLAND 4/4 BEAT and Tony’s kinda into it--
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Huh.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: We were really wondering if you had
dialog: any antique silver service.
text: Sills looks at her. Blinks wetly. Reaches one finger out to
text: tap the keyboard and stop ‘THE ROCK’.
text: It’s suddenly very quiet. Ruth shifts uncomfortably under
text: Sills’ wounded stare. As he strains up out of his chair--
speaker_heading: KILLER SILLS
dialog: (sadly, quietly)
dialog: If you don’t like music you can
dialog: just say so.
scene_heading: INT. SIDE AISLE - BARN - SAME
text: As Sills morosely leads them to shelves of SILVERWARE SETS...
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Are your ah, your newer items in
dialog: any particular area?
speaker_heading: KILLER SILLS
dialog: They're antiques.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Oh, no, I just meant--
dialog: Pink (mm/dd/yyyy) 42.
text: BING! There’s another customer, so Sills shuffles away.
text: Alone now, Ruth searches a shelf and Tony searches another as
text: the VOICES of Sills and his customer drift indistinctly O.S.
text: But then the VOICES AND ALL SOUND DISSOLVE INTO DREAMY SCORE
text: as Ruth’s eyes lock on something and she comes towards us.
text: There. A plain polished WOODEN BOX with a plain brass
text: MONOGRAM: ‘SK.’ She lifts the lid, the silver inside gleams.
text: Seeing this, her eyes water a little bit...
scene_heading: INT. ELSEWHERE - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: GRANDMA SALLY, a wee sweet old lady in a haze of warm
text: sunlight, chuckles with her Virginia Slim 100 and iced tea.
scene_heading: INT. SIDE AISLE - BARN - SAME
text: NORMAL SOUND RESUMES as Ruth looks down at HER HAND, which is
text: shaking, so she makes a fist. Whispering to Tony--
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: This is it.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (re: the monogram
dialog: ‘Sally. Kimke.'
dialog: (then, with resolve)
dialog: Go start the car.
text: Excited and terrified, Tony nods himself into action.
scene_heading: INT. BARN —- SAME
text: Tony walks quickly towards the exit: trying so hard to look
text: casual that he appears to have a board up his ass.
text: OUT OF FOCUS BEHIND HIM, Sills dickers with a Customer.
speaker_heading: SILLS
dialog: Two hundred for these. Final.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: They were my Mom's.
dialog: Pink (mm/dd/yyyy) 43.
speaker_heading: SILLS
dialog: So take ‘e m to a regulated outfit.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Mmhm. What I thought.
scene_heading: EXT. KILLER SILLS’ PLACE - SAME
text: Tony stiff-walks to RUTH'S CAR and as he slips in--
text: We see that empty spot is now filled with CHRISTIAN’S VAN.
scene_heading: INT. RUTH’S CAR - SAME
text: In his nerves, Tony grinds the starter, VRR! He glances over
text: to see MARSHALL watching him from the VAN’S PASSENGER WINDOW.
text: Tony smiles. Marshall smiles back, poisonously, with Dez
text: behind him.
scene_heading: INT. SIDE AISLE - BARN - SAME
text: With a breath for courage, Ruth gathers the SILVER SET in her
text: arms and WE LEAD HER OUT OF THE AISLE.
scene_heading: INT. BARN - CONTINUOUS
text: TRACKING HER as she heads towards the entrance but--
speaker_heading: KILLER SILLS (0.S.)
dialog: Sure are unloading yourself, last
dialog: few days.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER (0.S.)
dialog: Yeah, we're moving away, So...
speaker_heading: KILLER SILLS (0.S.)
dialog: Uh huh. “Moving.”
text: She slows, staring in confused recognition at--
text: CHRISTIAN’S SNEAKER that now fills the foreground of this LOW
text: SHOT: the LIGHTNING BOLT LOGO, the DUCT TAPE wrapping it.
text: On Ruth, stunned as she realizes it: that’s her thief.
text: AT THE REGISTER, with the JEWELRY on the counter between
text: them, Sills passes Christian some CASH and he quickly splits.
dialog: 44,
scene_heading: EXT. KILLER SILLS’ PLACE - SAME
text: Christian hustles out, counting the bills as he moves.
text: Ruth follows, hugging the SILVER SET, hypnotized by him.
scene_heading: INT. RUTH’S CAR - SAME
text: Tony twists in his seat to see her trailing slowly along--
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: C'mon, c'mon, c'mon...
scene_heading: EXT. KILLER SILLS’ PLACE - SAME
text: TRACKING RUTH through the tables, Christian angling away from
dialog: her, towards the VAN when--
speaker_heading: KILLER SILLS (0.S.)
dialog: Hold on there...
text: She looks back to see Sills coming after her, pointing.
scene_heading: INT. RUTH’S CAR - SAME
text: Through the back window, Tony watches Sills approaching Ruth--
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Oh, no, no, no...
text: --and now notices Christian hopping into the VAN’S DRIVER
text: SEAT, Marshall giving him an oily salute as they BACK OUT.
scene_heading: EXT. KILLER SILLS’ PLACE - SAME
text: Seeing the VAN start to pull away--
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: STOP! HALT!
text: --she breaks into a TROT, still hugging the silver set.
text: And seeing this, Sills now RUNS after her.
speaker_heading: KILLER SILLS
dialog: OH NO YOU DON’T!
text: SHOPPERS watch idly as the hobbity old man scrabbles after
text: the young woman awkwardly jogging away with the wooden box.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: KILLER SILLS (CONT’D)
dialog: JUST STOP RIGHT THERE!
speaker_heading: RUTH
text: THIS IS STOLEN PROPERTY.
speaker_heading: KILLER SILLS
speaker_heading: C'MERE!
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: No!
text: Sills swoops in, CLUTCHES HER ELBOW--
text: A FLASH OF IMPULSIVE RAGE: RUTH JERKS FREE AND--SMAK!--BASHES
text: SILLS IN THE FACE WITH THE BOX. SILVERWARE FLIES LOOSE.
text: He staggers, stunned, BLOOD in his mouth.
text: Wide-eyed SHOPPERS saw this happen: oh shit, she's evil.
text: Ruth sways, aghast: what have I done?
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT’D)
dialog: Oh...no...I didn’t....
text: Sills turns his face up to her and we see it change, filling
text: with RAGE of his own, and he LASHES at her like a viper--
speaker_heading: KILLER SILLS
dialog: YOU HIT ME!
text: Awkward and instantaneous, SHE THROWS UP ONE ARM TO WARD HIM
text: OFF BUT HE GETS HOLD OF HER MIDDLE FINGER AND--SNAP!
text: They break apart and the color drains from Ruth’s face as--
text: SHE LIFTS HER HAND, SEES HER FINGER BENT BACK NINETY-DEGREES.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Guh.
dialog: Tight on Killer Sills, livid--
speaker_heading: KILLER SILLS
dialog: Now look what you made me do--
text: THUP! TONY’S FOOT IMPACTS THE SIDE OF HIS FACE AND SILLS
text: DROPS LIKE A SACK OF WET LAUNDRY.
speaker_heading: TONY
speaker_heading: SIDE KICK.
dialog: 46.
text: Tony hurriedly tosses whatever SILVER he can back into the
text: box, quaking with giddy adrenaline over what he just did.
text: Sills is out cold, mouth agape, SNORING as FLIES buzz him.
text: Ruth is hunched over, clammy-grey, gazing miserably out at--
text: THE VAN DISAPPEARING AROUND A DISTANT CURVE IN THE ROAD.
text: As Tony helps her to her feet--
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: That was a side kick.
text: A few Shoppers are stealing shit now and running away.
scene_heading: INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY
text: CLOSE ON RUTH’S HAND as a splint is applied to her finger.
text: CLOSE ON THE DOCTOR, focusing on his work for a bit. Then...
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: The uh...that mail slot, huh?
text: CLOSE ON TONY, observing from the sidelines, tight-lipped.
text: CLOSE ON RUTH, looking sad and exhausted.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Yeah.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Must’ve really slammed it hard.
text: Her lip quivers, almost crying but not. Softly...
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Slammed the shit outta it.
text: CLOSE ON A BOX OF ‘PERCODAN’ being opened. Rip!
text: CLOSE ON RUTH’S HAND, two FAT PILLS dropped into the palm.
text: CLOSE ON RUTH’S MOUTH as she gulps ‘em and chugs water. Glug!
scene_heading: INT. RUTH’S CAR (MOVING) - DAY
text: Tony drives. Ruth stares out like a zombie, high as fuck, but
text: troubled. Some CHEERFUL POP NUMBER plays softly on the radio.
dialog: Pink (mm/dd/yyyy) 47.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: See...you pivot on the ball of your
dialog: foot and snap your hips out at the
dialog: same time. That transmits a huge
dialog: amount of power outward through the
dialog: leg. It’s devastating when deployed
dialog: correctly.
text: Doesn't seem like she heard him. He lets it go.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: That guy mighta killed me.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Him? Nah. He’s scrappy, I’1l give
dialog: him that, but he let emotions cloud
dialog: his flow. Amateur stuff.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: No. He wanted to hurt me. I saw his
dialog: eyes...after I hit him.
text: He can see that pains her.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Hey. You didn’t do anything wrong.
dialog: That’s your silver.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: He didn’t know that.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Doesn’t matter.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Your superpower is certainty.
text: He’s flattered but she doesn’t notice, she’s spiraling.
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT’D)
dialog: What if he had a gun? Or a knife?
dialog: He mighta killed you, too. He...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I’m so sorry.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Sorry? I should be thanking you.
text: For the first time here, she looks at him. Huh?
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t uh...I don’t really have
dialog: too many friends. I’ve been told
dialog: I’m obnoxious? Which is...anyways.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: Pink (mm/dd/yyyy) 48.
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: My life is...
dialog: (a little shrug)
dialog: But today I felt electric.
text: She nods blearily. It makes a weird kind of sense.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I wasn’t scared. I mean, I
dialog: was...but it had no weight. And I
dialog: am always scared.
text: She turns her gaze back out the window again...
text: RUTH'S POV, sliding by PILES OF GARBAGE, by HUNCHED
text: PEDESTRIANS, by NEON-LIT SHOPFRONTS. Blurring decay.
text: Her voice seems to come from elsewhere. Lost.
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT’D)
dialog: What are we doing?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Umm. Whatever you want? I mean, I
dialog: gotta take Brian for a walk but--
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: What are we doing here. The world.
text: He thinks a moment, but he knows this one.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Trying to be good. Or be better.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Quantify that shit.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I mean, y’know...values and
dialog: whatnot.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: That’s not a real thing. That’s a
text: poster with a kitten on it.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: It is a real thing.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: What about me? Am I good?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Yes. Of course you are.
dialog: Pink (mm/dd/yyyy) 49.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I clubbed an old man.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Well, yeah--
speaker_heading: RUTH
text: In the face.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Yeah--
speaker_heading: RUTH
text: With a big wooden box.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Right, but in combat situations--
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: There’s no upside. We come from
dialog: stars, you know.
text: He looks at her: what's this gibberish?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: The upside is that nothing ends.
dialog: There’s always time. You continue.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (“obviously”)
dialog: Somewhere better.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: “Heaven?”
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I’m not saying clouds and harps and
dialog: stuff...but there is more. I know
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: How do you know it?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I just know it.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (very quiet)
dialog: I don’t wanna die.
dialog: Pink (mm/dd/yyyy) 50.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You won’t.
text: She grimaces at that.
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: Nnnot....right now?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: It’s just gonna be black.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: No. It won't.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Yes, Tony. It will. Just...
dialog: (snaps her fingers)
dialog: Like when you switch off a T.V.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: But...that’s so hopeless.
text: She shrugs. He considers her, vexed. Finally...
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: Can I show you something?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Mhmm...show me.
text: As the radio fades into a JOHN HUGHES-Y LOVE SONG (“Bring On
text: The Dancing Horses” by Echo & The Bunnymen is perfect) her
text: head lolls back in a druggy stupor...
scene_heading: INT. FIRST REDEEMER EPISCOPAL CHURCH - DAY
text: Ruth drifts towards us down the aisle, eyes drawn upwards in
text: awe as THE SONG SUBSUMES ALL SOUND.
text: A MURAL OF “HEAVEN” spreads before her: it’s a community art
dialog: project, so Jesus and all the happy folks with Him in the
text: green sunny field resemble grinning misshapen cavemen.
text: But, gazing up at it, she begins to smile.
text: WIDER NOW, Ruth and Tony in a pew. Fluorescent banks and drop
text: ceilings: a small, new construction church, FULL OF PEOPLE.
text: The MINISTER reads his sermon. We can’t hear him but his body
text: language suggests a calm, grandfatherly warmth.
text: PUSHING IN on Ruth, hearing his words, smiling dreamily.
dialog: 51.
text: CLOSER ON THE MINSTER as his “words” fall into sync with the
text: chorus of THE SONG. He's not performing it, he's just reading
text: his regular sermon, but his lips subtly form the lyrics.
text: Next to Ruth, Tony glances over at her sidelong. Taking in
text: the curve of her cheek, the line of her neck.
text: THEIR HANDS are resting on the pew, close together. He moves
text: his PINKY, ever so slightly, so that it brushes hers.
text: She looks at him. He looks at her.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD - TWILIGHT
text: THE SONG CONTINUES over this LONG SHOT in which Ruth and Tony
text: head away from us in the fading light, taking Brian out for a
text: walk. (And Tony has a plastic bag at the ready, btw.)
scene_heading: INT. FRONT ROOM - TONY’S HOUSE - SUNSET
text: THE SONG CONTINUES as we find Ruth and Tony sitting on his
text: sheet-covered couch in the stream of gold-orange light
text: through the window. Brian is curled up nearby.
text: SLOWLY PUSHING IN ON THEM, side by side, not talking, not
text: moving...until she tilts her head to rest it on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
scene_heading: INT. THE VAN - NIGHT
text: HEAVY ROCK on the radio (“Forever My Queen”, Pentagram!) as
text: MARSHALL nervously counts the CASH for maybe the tenth time.
text: HEADLIGHTS play on his face and he looks up. Christian
text: gobbles some of RUTH’S MEDS and looks up. Dez was dozing off
text: but now she looks up, too.
speaker_heading: DEZ
dialog: Finally.
text: THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD, they watch a HEAVY PICKUP TRUCK glide
text: into this crowded PARKING LOT like a great white shark.
scene_heading: EXT. ROADHOUSE PARKING LOT - SAME
text: Marshall, affecting a careless swagger, leads them along.
text: Christian is tense. Only Dez is genuinely relaxed.
dialog: Pink (mm/dd/yyyy) 52.
text: The lot is clogged with NOISY BIKERS and ROUGH CHARACTERS
text: hanging around the seedy BAR that throbs in the background.
text: AHEAD, oozing from his PICKUP to greet some PALS, is the one
text: and only DONKEY DICK (40s). Corpulent redneck supreme.
text: Marshall (and crew) arrives at the outskirts of Donkey Dick’s
text: jocular group and LAUGHS along with a joke he didn’t hear.
text: Donkey Dick regards them with open contempt.
speaker_heading: DONKEY DICK
dialog: Not gonna waste my time again, are
dialog: ya?
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Nope. We’re whole.
speaker_heading: DONKEY DICK
dialog: Yeah? Butthole, maybe.
dialog: That gets big laughs.
speaker_heading: DONKEY DICK (CONT’D)
dialog: Y'all been sleeping in that van?
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: (wanted to make a smart
dialog: remark but)
dialog: N-no.
speaker_heading: DONKEY DICK
dialog: Cause one a you three stinks. Ain't
dialog: quite fish but it ain’t quite
dialog: chicken, neither, so I’m at a loss.
text: More big laughs.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: It’s pork chops: we just dropped
dialog: your Mom off.
text: Yikes. No overt laughs. (But someone does snicker quietly.)
text: Donkey Dick sizzles, infuriated.
text: Marshall holds his ground. Christian swells his chest. Dez
text: looks like she’s watching a mildly diverting sitcom.
text: As Donkey Dick opens the LOCK BOX in his pickup bed and yanks
text: out a PAPER GROCERY BAG--
speaker_heading: DONKEY DICK
dialog: C’mon, ya fuckin’ comedian.
dialog: 53.
scene_heading: EXT. THE VAN - ROADHOUSE PARKING LOT - SAME
text: vUMP! The van door slides open and Donkey Dick sets the PAPER
text: BAG inside with a clink! A semi-private staging area.
text: Christian and Dez are hanging back, but they crane to see--
text: As Marshall opens the bag, practically salivating.
text: It’s TWO HANDGUNS (a 4-INCH .38 REVOLVER & a .45 AUTO) and a
text: SAWED-OFF DOUBLE-BARREL SHOTGUN. Loose SHELLS in Ziploc bags.
dialog: Marshall works the action on the shotgun, klik! k-klak! It's
text: kind of rusty and banged up, not the cleanest weapon.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Action’s a little janky.
speaker_heading: DONKEY DICK
dialog: Gonna do brain surgery with it? Get
dialog: whatcha pay for n’ you could barely
dialog: pay for this.
text: Donkey Dick swats him and Marshall hands over the CASH.
text: As Donkey Dick counts it, Marshall gives a satisfied nod to
text: Dez and Christian and slides the bag out of sight.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: (turning to Donkey Dick)
dialog: Very happy that we could finally--
text: WAK! DONKEY DICK SLAPS MARSHALL SO HARD ACROSS THE FACE THAT
text: HIS DENTURES POP OUT AS HE FALLS.
text: Christian steps forward but Dez subtly blocks him: don’t.
text: Donkey Dick pockets the money, shakes his hand out.
speaker_heading: DONKEY DICK
dialog: Bring my Mom into it.
text: The kids wait until he’s stomped off before...
text: Dez scoops Marshall’s DENTURES out of the dirt, reaches into
text: the van for a bottle of Pepsi to rinse them off.
text: Christian helps Marshall stand. He can’t help but look
text: diminished, accepting his teeth and slipping them back in.
text: But he rallies, a brittle little smile, a hoarse chuckle...
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
text: Eggs and omelets, like they say.
dialog: 54.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT ROOM - TONY’S HOUSE - DAWN
text: Ruth stirs out of a deep, sweaty, painkiller sleep on the
text: couch. Her first movements bring a GASP of pain.
text: She remembers her BROKEN FINGER, winces at it. Then at...
text: The plate of AMERICAN CHEESE SLICES (wrapped) and a SODA POP
text: that Tony put out for her. A faint smile at that.
text: But next to it is her SILVER SET, badly scratched, some bent
text: utensils sticking out. And her expression hardens.
speaker_heading: TONY (0.S.)
dialog: How's the finger?
text: WIDER, Tony’s shirtless in the kitchen doorway with a bowl of
text: CEREAL, sweaty from a workout. Ruth stares at her silver.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (almost to herself)
dialog: Fuckers got away.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Yeah, but...you got it all back,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: They were inside my house.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (philosophical shrug)
dialog: So give the cops the tag number.
dialog: Doubt they can do anything...but
dialog: you never know.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (clenched teeth)
dialog: I didn’t get the tag number.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (mouth full of cereal)
dialog: Oh, I did.
text: She swivels slowly to face him. He chomps, open faced.
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: Didn't I say that?
scene_heading: INT. TONY’S BEDROOM - DAY
text: HIS COMPUTER is clicked on. Bzzt!
dialog: 55.
text: SCREEN GLOW REVEALS BRIAN, panting happily in the darkness.

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: It’s all just ones and zeroes.
dialog: Binary data connected by threads,
text: like a web.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Yeah. It’s...called the Web.
text: She glances around the DIM MESSY ROOM: dirty socks, microwave

speaker_heading: RUTH (0.S.)
dialog: Choices he made.

speaker_heading: TONY

dialog: A machine did this?
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Huh. I worked at a Borders.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: The bookstore?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Yes, but they had a cafe, too. I

speaker_heading: MEREDITH

speaker_heading: TONY

speaker_heading: RUTH

speaker_heading: MEREDITH

text: Ruth glances around, vaguely confused.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: But...he does have a job?
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: Some’d argue that’s all he has.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: What’s he do?

speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: (air quotes)
dialog: “Lawyer.” You know.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Is...-he in his van now?
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: Oh...
text: At “van”, her vibe shifts: smirky disdain to curious concern.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH (CONT'D)
dialog: That's Chris Junior you're talking

dialog: for his sixteenth if he got all
dialog: B’s. He flunked but got to keep it

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Do you know where your son is now?
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: Step-son. I have no idea where he

dialog: was in jail a little bit, started

dialog: cancelled his ATM cards,
dialog: everything. Tough love and whatnot.
dialog: (dropping her voice)

speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: The police are asking about

text: Rumack pointedly zips his fly, which was down, and...
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: RUMACK
dialog: (to Ruth/Tony)
dialog: That your shitbox out front?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Y-yes, sir, but--
text: Fast: Cesar draws a GLOCK 9MM from a concealed carry holster
dialog: and levels it on Ruth and Tony--
speaker_heading: CESAR
speaker_heading: HANDS.
text: Their hands go up so fast both coffee cups go flying. K-kash!
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: (‘the rug.’
dialog: Ohh.
text: Cesar darts forward to quickly pat them both down, and--
speaker_heading: CESAR
dialog: DO NOT MOVE.
text: --he darts from the room in a tactical crouch as Rumack
text: watches them, nastily amused, polishing his half-tints.
text: Ruth and Tony: both visibly freaked out.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Sir--
text: He puts a finger to his lips. Hush. And she does.
text: He takes a moment, pulls his tie the rest of the way off,
text: rubs his red, puffy eyes, smacks his lips. And finally...
speaker_heading: RUMACK
dialog: Meredith. Are you retarded?
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: Don’t you dare use the R word
dialog: around me!
speaker_heading: RUMACK
dialog: Those are not police.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: I know that.
speaker_heading: RUMACK
dialog: Then why are you talking to them?
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: Because I’m fucking borrred!
speaker_heading: RUMACK
dialog: Oh shut up, not that again--
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: Look at yourself! You’re lucky all

speaker_heading: RUMACK

speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: I guess I'll just get some soda for

speaker_heading: CESAR (0.S.)

speaker_heading: CESAR (CONT'D)
dialog: Clear.
dialog: Rumack gestures, lower your hands. They do.
speaker_heading: RUMACK
dialog: .»..come home to this shit. Okay.
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: RUTH TONY
dialog: My name is Ruth. I invoke my Fifth Amendment--
speaker_heading: RUMACK (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing here.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Your son broke into my house and
dialog: stole my stuff.
text: From 0.S., Meredith SLAMS cabinets in the kitchen. BAM! BAM!
speaker_heading: RUMACK
scene_heading: KNOCK IT OFF.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: RUMACK (CONT'D)
dialog: (back to Ruth)
dialog: What’s that got--
dialog: 66.
text: BAM! He fumes.
speaker_heading: RUMACK (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s that got to do with me?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I thought he lived here.
speaker_heading: RUMACK
dialog: So you impersonate cops to...why?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: To find him if he wasn’t here.
speaker_heading: RUMACK
dialog: To what end?
speaker_heading: RUTH
text: To confront him.
speaker_heading: RUMACK
dialog: “How dare you. Wah, wah.” Like
dialog: that?
text: Ruth’s revulsion at this sarcasm melts through her fear.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Yes. Exactly. You can’t do that to
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: RUMACK
dialog: You say that like it means
dialog: something. Look, I don’t condone my
dialog: son's behavior but anyone can do
dialog: anything if you let them. Welcome
dialog: to the world. You watch the news,
dialog: don’t you?
text: His words physically rattle her, she has to recover.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: No wonder he turned out like he
dialog: did.
speaker_heading: RUMACK
dialog: You have kids?
text: Her non-response is a ‘no.’
speaker_heading: RUMACK (CONT'D)
dialog: So you have no idea what you’re
dialog: talking about, do you?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: RUMACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Christian had more opportunity and
dialog: assistance than ninety-nine-point-—
dialog: nine percent of the people on this
dialog: planet and that’s because of me, of
dialog: what I did for him, what I
dialog: provided. If he decides to flush it
dialog: and live like a degenerate because
dialog: of mental weakness that’s his
dialog: choice, he is allowing that to
dialog: happen just as you allowed yourself
dialog: to be victimized, but don’t come to
dialog: me with that nature-nurture
dialog: horseshit. How much?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: H-how much what?
text: Rumack HURLS his glasses aside--wak!--a sudden micro-tantrum,
text: his temper just as instantly recovered into a shrill grin.
text: Ruth and Tony are stunned and...
text: In the now-charged silence, Meredith stomps back in with
text: PAPER TOWELS and SELTZER WATER to sop up the coffee.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: (muttering)
dialog: Probably gonna stain.
text: Rumack brings out his WALLET, thumbs the cash inside.
speaker_heading: RUMACK
dialog: How much do you want?
text: Staredown: furious Ruth vs. smirking Rumack. Tony’s eyes jump
text: between them. Meredith ignores it all, working on that stain.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I don’t want a payoff.
speaker_heading: RUMACK
dialog: Then I’m confused. What do you
dialog: want?
text: She sifts for it, right there on the tip of her tongue:
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: For people...to not...be assholes.
text: Rumack puts the wallet away, now genuinely concerned.
speaker_heading: RUMACK
dialog: Oh, child...
dialog: 68.
text: He approaches her, reaches his hand out, and she flinches
text: slightly but allows him to...rest it briefly on her forehead.
text: Tony watches. Cesar watches. Even Meredith, now, watches.
speaker_heading: RUMACH
dialog: Huh. Thought you might have a
dialog: fever.
text: And his “concern” morphs back into that nasty grin of
dialog: condescension. Ruth burns: Fuck. This. Dude.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (to Cesar)
dialog: Are you going to shoot us?
text: Cesar says nothing. Rumack snorts.
speaker_heading: RUMACK
dialog: Don’t be so goddamned dramatic.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Then we’ll leave.
text: She stands, waits for wobbly-kneed Tony, and they head out.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (to Meredith)
dialog: Thank you for the cappuccino. The
dialog: foam was amazing.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: (glumly, without looking)
dialog: You’re very welcome.
text: Ruth stalks past Rumack, eyes dead ahead.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT YARD - RUMACK MANSION - SAME
text: LEADING RUTH AND TONY away, Rumack in the door behind them--
speaker_heading: RUMACK
dialog: You can tell yourself you’ve done
dialog: something here, if that’1ll help.
dialog: Really took a stand.
text: She grinds her jaw, but doesn’t stop, doesn’t turn. And he
text: SLAMS! the door at their backs.
text: TRACKING THEM ACROSS THE HUGE LAWN, passing those ANIMALS as
text: Tony trots to keep up.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You know what? People like that,
dialog: that’s just unhappiness eating ‘em
dialog: up. You oughta feel sorry for him.
dialog: (when she doesn’t reply)
dialog: Want me to drive?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Sure.
text: AT RUTH’S CAR, Tony gets behind the wheel but...Ruth stops.
text: Something dark churns on her face for a moment and...
text: SHE TURNS AND JOGS BACK ACROSS THE YARD. Her ACTION THEME
text: wails but it’s playing in reverse, distorted and unholy.
text: FROM THE CAR, Tony watches in mounting horror as--
text: RUTH ATTACKS THE ELEPHANT, savagely trying to uproot it but
text: it’s sturdier than it looks. A wild, grunting frenzy.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Whoa whoa whoa!
text: KRAK! RUTH FALLS BACKWARDS, the snapped-off trunk of the
text: elephant in her hands. So she re-doubles and--
text: ATTACKS THE TIGER INSTEAD, coiling her entire body around it,
text: ferociously wrenching it loose. SNAP! (And faintly, almost
text: subconsciously, the tiger rawwrs.)
text: FROM THE CAR, Tony watches, aghast as--
text: RUTH AWKWARDLY SPRINTS BACK, HUGGING THE HUGE TIGER.
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing?
text: SHE JAMS THE TIGER INTO THE BACK SEAT-—
speaker_heading: RUTH TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: (under her beath) What are you doing? Why are
dialog: .-.get the fuck in there... you doing that?!
text: SHE JUMPS IN THE DRIVER’S SIDE, scooting him over to yank the
dialog: gearshift and rev them away, VRRRM!
text: But as they fly out of frame, we drift back to find that...
text: CHRISTIAN’S VAN is parked in the far background, partially
text: obscured by trees, fifty yards away.
dialog: 70.
scene_heading: INT. VAN - DOWN THE ROAD - SAME
text: Christian, Marshall, and Dez watch RUTH’S CAR vanish around
text: the bend. As her ENGINE fades in the distance, Marshall looks
text: sternly to Christian, as if expecting an explanation.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: I...I have no idea.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Yeah? Cause they were at the place
dialog: yesterday, too.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: What? No, they weren’t--
speaker_heading: DEZ
text: Yeah, they were. The girl yelled at
dialog: us.
text: Christian gapes, flummoxed and airless.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: I mean...fuck it, let’s just do it,
dialog: he’s finally there now--
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: (pointing after Ruth)
dialog: I’m not doing a damn thing until I
dialog: know what their piece in this is.
dialog: They’re on us yesterday, they’re
dialog: here today, she’s obviously nuts,
dialog: you telling me you’re comfortable
dialog: with that? We already got the
dialog: security man to think about. You
dialog: wanna walk into some kinda dog-fuck
dialog: n’ take another fall? Cause ol’
dialog: Marshall will not be there this
dialog: time to put a coat on ya, that’s
dialog: for certain.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: Okay. Fine. What’m I supposed to do
dialog: about it?
speaker_heading: DEZ
dialog: Ask her.
text: He looks to Marshall, whose blank look co-signs the order: do

speaker_heading: S CAR (MOVIN) - DAY

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: What do you mean, what?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: What’s your problem?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: That’s not your lawn tiger.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Did you hear that guy?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I heard him. But he’s not the one
dialog: that broke into your house and
dialog: that’s not your lawn tiger. If I'd
dialog: known that was gonna be the, the,

speaker_heading: RUTH

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Of the mission.
speaker_heading: RUTH

speaker_heading: TONY

speaker_heading: RUTH

speaker_heading: TONY

speaker_heading: RUTH

speaker_heading: TONY

speaker_heading: RUTH

dialog: Right. ‘What would Jesus do’, huh?
text: Ouch. He turns away. Moody silence resumes, big time.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - TONY’S HOUSE - DAY

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Tony...
text: He gives a little forget it wave without looking back and

scene_heading: EXT. FRONT YARD - RUTH’S HOUSE - DAY

scene_heading: INT. FRONT ROOM - RUTH’S HOUSE - DAY

speaker_heading: RUTH
text: FUCKING. ..THING.
text: She flops onto the couch, drops her face into her hands,

text: In time, she deep-breathes herself out of the red zone and

text: ALL IN ONE SHOT NOW, she gets up and heads into...
dialog: 73.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: ...with her OPENED FRONT DOOR visible in the background until

text: background shape she wisps by without noticing and heads into-
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Where she peels out of her sweaty shirt, slips on a fresh

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: She comes back but pauses suddenly, looking at...
text: THE EMPTY FRONT DOOR which, eerily, is just now shutting the

scene_heading: INT. FRONT ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: LEADING HER towards the door as she looks out, up and down

text: BEHIND HER, Christian materializes in the KITCHEN DOORWAY.
text: He’s right there, inside the fucking house. That crazy grin.
text: Her back is to him, taking a sip as he walks towards her.
text: Twelve feet away. Eight feet. Five feet...
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: What’d you tell my Dad?
text: GASP! She WHIRLS at his voice--
text: HER DROPPED BEER crashes to the floor--KAK!
scene_heading: TERROR REFLEX: SHE GRABS THE PLASTIC BAG WITH THE HEAVY
text: PLASTER MOLD IN IT AND SWINGS IT IN A BRUTAL ARC AND--
text: SHAK! THIS MAKESHIFT FLAIL CRUSHES HIS LARYNX.
dialog: 
dialog: This was all maybe three-quarters of a second. Christian
text: staggers, astonished, both hands jerking to his throat which
text: is making a horrible, reedy, WHISTLING NOISE.
dialog: 74.
text: Ruth, pulsing with shock and adrenaline, steps aside as--
text: Christian lurches past her, struggling for air he can’t get,
text: giving an almost reproachful look of Why'd you do that? as--
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT YARD - STREET - SAME
text: --he stumbles outside, heaving and buckling, his FACE QUICKLY
text: TURNING BLUE before our very eyes. Remember Luca Brasi in The
dialog: Godfather? Like that. Nightmare stuff.
text: Ruth steps out after him, stunned into inaction, watching in
dialog: helpless horror as--
text: Christian staggers down the MIDDLE OF THE ROAD, like he can
text: somehow outrun his own suffocation. Scared to death.
scene_heading: INT. VAN - DOWN THE STREET - SAME
text: Marshall and Dez, watching this unfold from a distance--
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Ahh fuck...
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - RUTH’S YARD - SAME
text: In his dying panic, Christian has picked up some speed,
text: hobble-lurching towards the INTERSECTION up ahead...
text: His face is PURPLE, clawing his throat, GURGLING pitifully...
text: Ruth is at the edge of her yard but still basically frozen,
text: weakly shaking her head like wait wait wait--
text: IN THE DISTANCE, CHRISTIAN DARTS PAST THE TWO-WAY STOP SIGN
text: INTO THE ROAD AND IS INSTANTLY CREAMED BY A FAST-MOVING BUS.
dialog: 
dialog: We actually cut away one frame before the moment of impact
text: but IT SOUNDS LIKE A ROAST BEEF DROPPED FROM A SKYSCRAPER.
text: At once: Ruth’s SCREAM, the terrible SCREECH of bus brakes--
scene_heading: INT. VAN - DOWN THE ROAD - SAME
speaker_heading: MARSHALL DEZ
dialog: Hoo boy. Goddamn.
dialog: Pink (mm/dd/yyyy) 75.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT YARD - SAME
text: ON RUTH, barely upright under the shock of this moment,

text: ACCIDENT SCENE, we hear a clamor of SCREAMS...
speaker_heading: VOICES (VARIOUS O.S.)
scene_heading: DON'T TOUCH HIM! / --AN AMBULANCE!
dialog: / --RAN OUT IN FRONTA ME!

scene_heading: EXT. FRONT YARD - SAME
text: Ruth turns away from the CHAOS DOWN THE STREET, gulping for

speaker_heading: PHONE V.O.
dialog: 911 operator, what is your

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Uhhhhhhhh.
speaker_heading: PHONE V.O.
dialog: Ma'am?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: He just, he was just, he he he--

speaker_heading: DEZ (0.S.)
dialog: I can help you, honey.
text: Ruth turns around just in time to see--
text: DEZ SWINGING THE BUTT OF A SHOTGUN AT HER FACE. KRAK.
text: CUT TO BLACK.
dialog: 76.
scene_heading: INT. VAN (MOVING) - DAY
text: BLACKNESS. Occasionally penetrated by SMEARS OF LIGHT.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL (V.O.)
dialog: She mighta said our names.
speaker_heading: DEZ (V.O.)
dialog: She doesn't know ‘em.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL (V.O.)
dialog: She knew Chrissy's alright.
speaker_heading: DEZ (V.O.)

speaker_heading: MARSHALL (V.O.)
text: Ask her when she wakes up.
speaker_heading: DEZ (V.O.)
dialog: Oh, she's awake now.
text: CLOSE ON RUTH, jouncing on the floor of the van, a SWOLLEN
text: GASH above her eye. Stripes of SUNLIGHT wipe her face,
text: rhythmically. She’s terrified. She squirms but...
text: HER WRISTS are bound with duct tape.
text: Painfully, she cranes her neck around to see--
text: MARSHALL AND DEZ: THEIR HEADS MADE OUT OF CLOTH. Homemade
text: masks, t-shirts with eyeholes. Creeeeepy.
text: Marshall drives. Dez stares back at her, holding her PHONE.
speaker_heading: DEZ
dialog: What’d you tell ‘em?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: DEZ
dialog: Promise?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I don’t know who you are.

speaker_heading: DEZ
dialog: How'd you find Chrissy?
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: C-computer.
speaker_heading: DEZ
dialog: And what? You just went after him
dialog: on your own?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I tried to tell the cops. Before.
dialog: But they didn’t listen. I swear.
speaker_heading: DEZ
dialog: What about his dad?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: He didn’t care either!
text: Dez stares at her, like trying to see inside her brain.
speaker_heading: DEZ
dialog: (to Marshall)
dialog: Whatcha think?
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: (gloomy & fatalistic)
text: Soon as they peel Chrissy outta
dialog: under that bus there’s gonna be
dialog: people coming over anyway...what a
dialog: buncha bullshit.
speaker_heading: DEZ
dialog: Better hustle then.
text: CLOSE ON RUTH AGAIN, drooping back down, eyes clamping shut.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (barely audible)
dialog: ...-please...
scene_heading: INT. FRONT ROOM - TONY’S HOUSE - DAY
text: SLOWLY PUSHING IN ON TONY, slumped there on the couch. His
text: eyes land sadly on something 0.S. and he reaches for it.
text: Crinkle, crinkle. He lifts the now-unwrapped slice of
text: American cheese to his mouth for a sad nibble. Chew, chew,
text: chew. Washes it down with some soda.
text: Abh. There. He feels a little better now. Looks over at...
text: Brian, curled in the corner, staring back as if in
text: anticipation. Tony’s expression becomes serious again.
dialog: 78.
scene_heading: EXT. ACCIDENT SCENE INTERSECTION - DAY
text: THE BUS AND VARIOUS COP CARS as out-of-focus foreground
text: elements. LIGHTS FLASHING and BLURRY OFFICIAL HUBBUB.
text: IN THE BACKGROUND, at the rear of the small CROWD at the
text: yellow tape, TONY'S HEAD pops up above them, scanning as--
text: IN THE FOREGROUND, a STRETCHER goes by, a BODY under a sheet.
text: Tony questions an ONLOOKER, who gestures at the cops and bus.
scene_heading: EXT. RUTH’S HOUSE - DAY
text: Tony approaches and gives a light knock-knock but...THE DOOR
text: was a little bit opened already.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT ROOM - RUTH’S HOUSE - SAME
text: He steps inside, hesitantly.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Ruth?
text: No answer. He looks over at...
text: THE TIGER, sideways on the floor, silently snarling at him. A
text: DOOMY SCORE kicks in and carries us over to...
scene_heading: EXT. THE VAN - WOODED DRIVE (MOVING) - DAY
text: THE VAN pushing ominously through the woods.
scene_heading: INT. VAN (MOVING) - DAY
text: Ruth rocks forward as the van comes to a halt.
text: Marshall looks back at her, the .45 loose in his hand.
text: Dez loads the RUSTY SHOTGUN. She has to force the shell in.
text: Ruth shivers, waiting for whatever’s next. She watches as...
text: Marshall WHISPERS something in Dez’s ear, who listens, her
text: eyes on Ruth. She WHISPERS something back. It’s decided.
text: With his free hand, Marshall brings out the REVOLVER and aims
text: it at Ruth’s face. Cringing away from it...
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Don't don't--
text: He pulls the trigger, she SHRIEKS, it makes a dull click.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: You'll carry this one, okay?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: W-why?
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Cause we're shorthanded. Which is
dialog: on you.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I don’t want to.
text: For a second, Marshall’s eyes look damn near sympathetic.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: That’s what life is, darlin. Buncha
dialog: stuff we don’t wanna do.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: You could leave me here. I-I-I‘1l
dialog: be so quiet. I promise.
text: His eyes turn hard and demonic inside the mask. His gestures
text: accentuate those CAT TATTOOS on his hands.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Get them to open the door. Point
dialog: that at whoever it is so nothing
dialog: happens. We’ll get what we need and
dialog: we'll leave and that’s it.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: But how do I know you won't,
dialog: won't...
text: She can’t even finish the thought.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: You know that I will if you don’t.
speaker_heading: DEZ
dialog: It’s karma, for Chrissy...
text: Dez holds up a SWITCHBLADE and--snikt!--pops it open.
speaker_heading: DEZ (CONT'D)
dialog: That shit’s for real, sister.
dialog: 80.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT YARD - RUMACK MANSION -DAY
text: The most hopeless version of RUTH'S THEME echoes faintly as
text: we TRACK HER ACROSS THE LAWN. A long march towards oblivion.
text: HER HAND shakes violently. Making a fist doesn’t help.
text: THE REVOLVER is tucked into the small of her back.
text: THE RATTAN YARD ANIMALS, the now-trunkless elephant and the
text: giraffe, seem to watch her as she passes by.
text: She swallows heavily to keep from throwing up.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT DOOR - RUMACK MANSION - CONTINUOUS
text: ON RUTH, seen from behind, standing at the door.
text: PULLING BACK, there’s Marshall and Dez on either side of her,
text: pressed against the house, out of sight, GUNS READY.
text: Ruth hesitates. Marshall twitches his gun. So she knocks.
text: CLOSE ON THE PEEPHOLE, which suddenly goes dark.
text: Ruth attempts a smile. Looks like she drank vinegar.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: It’s me again. Sorry.
text: CLOSE ON MARSHALL, off to the side with the .45 up. The cloth
text: of his mask flutters with his breath.
text: CLOSE ON DEZ, to the other side, with the shotgun. Her eyes
text: are cold and steady inside the mask.
text: THE PEEPHOLE goes clear. The DEADBOLT goes click-clack.
text: CESAR opens, eyeing Ruth warily, clocking her EMPTY HANDS.
speaker_heading: CESAR
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Please don’t do anything.
text: SHE DRAWS THE GUN ON HIM, on us, that big barrel swinging
text: right up into the lens.
text: And Cesar almost makes a move but, no, his hands go up.
dialog: 81.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT ROOM - RUMACK MANSION - CONTINUOUS
text: Ruth walks Cesar back as Marshall and Dez slip in behind her,
text: fanning out, already forgetting the still-open front door.
text: Dez covers the INTERIOR HALL as Marshall snags Cesar’s 9mm
text: and tosses it aside.
speaker_heading: CESAR
dialog: I’m compliant.
text: PAK! Marshall whacks him behind the ear with the barrel of
text: his .45 and Cesar drops to his knees, GROANING.
dialog: Ruth GASPS at this sudden violence and at that exact moment--
text: Meredith comes from the kitchen, sees masked people with guns
text: and--oops!--turns promptly on her heel to exit again but--
speaker_heading: DEZ
dialog: Stop.
text: Fuck. At least she manages to guzzle her drink even as she
text: lifts her hands, now recognizing Ruth...
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: You.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I’m so sorry. This isn’t my fault.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: You took my tiger.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: That was me, yes, but not this--
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: You're pointing a gun.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: No, I know, but--
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Shut the fuck up. Sit.
speaker_heading: CESAR
dialog: (from the ground)
dialog: Do what they say, Meredith.
text: As she flops onto the couch in a semi-sober pout...
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: ..-unbelievable...
dialog: Pink (mm/dd/yyyy) 82.
text: Marshall nudges Cesar to the couch as well but--
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: You too. Over there.
text: --he doesn’t move fast enough so MARSHALL KICKS HIM. WUNK.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Don't do that!
text: Meredith reacts to Ruth’s shaken protest--huh?--as Cesar
text: crawls to the couch, hugging his maybe-busted ribs.
text: Dez keeps the shotgun aimed down the HALLWAY into the house
text: as Marshall squats before Meredith, hissing--
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: Sleeping one off.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Call him.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: If you’re here for what you think
dialog: you're here for, your timing
text: stinks.
speaker_heading: CESAR
dialog: Meredith, be quiet.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Call him.
text: He touches the gun to her chin.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Just do it. Please.
text: Meredith glares hard at Marshall, at Ruth, and then...
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: (“happy”)
dialog: Hey, Chris?
dialog: (beat)
speaker_heading: CHRIIIIIS.
speaker_heading: RUMACK (0.S.)
dialog: (from upstairs)
dialog: What?!
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
speaker_heading: C'MERE.
speaker_heading: RUMACK (0.S.)
dialog: For whaaat?
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
speaker_heading: COME HERE.
text: Angry THUDS and STOMPING from upstairs. Everyone tenses as
text: FOOTSTEPS come fump, fump, fump, fumping! down the stairs.
text: Dez slides to the side of the HALLWAY DOOR, so she’s poised
text: right there but out of sight from DOWN THE HALL, where--
text: Rumack now appears, cinching a robe, irritated and confused.
speaker_heading: RUMACK
dialog: Is Christian here?
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: No.
text: DOWN THE HALLWAY, Rumack is coming towards us but he slows...
speaker_heading: RUMACK
text: His van’s parked out front.
text: FROM WITHIN THE HALLWAY, RUMACK’S POV: the empty room looming
text: ahead of him, no sign of anything amiss there. But still...
text: His eyes narrow. Wondering at the silence. He backs away.
text: WHILE IN THE FRONT ROOM, Marshall gestures in frustration,
text: Say something! At which Meredith shrugs savagely, Like what?
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: Uh. Maybe he’s waiting for you to
dialog: come outside? You know he doesn’t
dialog: like me too much.
text: DOWN THE HALLWAY, Rumack reappears but now on full alert, a
text: CHROME .38 held before him as he advances.
speaker_heading: RUMACK
dialog: Cesar?
text: IN THE FRONT ROOM, Marshall aims at Cesar, finger to his
dialog: lips, shhh!
text: Ruth just stands off to the side, shaking in place, her gun
text: vaguely on Meredith but mostly on the floor.
dialog: 84.
text: Dez waits beside the HALL DOORWAY, her RUSTY SHOTGUN at head-
text: level. All that oxidation crusted around the breach.
dialog: 
text: IN THE HALLWAY, Rumack is almost to the DOOR, his gun held
text: forward, craning his neck for a wider view of the FRONT ROOM:
text: There's Meredith, perched on the couch, oddly stiff.
speaker_heading: RUMACK (CONT'D)
dialog: The fuck’s going on?
text: CLOSE ON HIS GUN HAND AS IT PRECEDES HIM INTO THE FRONT ROOM,
text: extending ahead of his body, visible now to--
text: DEZ, who's right there, and promptly lowers the SHOTGUN to--
text: BAM!--BLAST RUMACK’S HAND INTO RED THREADS.
dialog: Okay, this all happens in a whirlwind:
text: Rumack SCREAMS and DROPS. Meredith SCREAMS.
text: RUTH DROPS HER GUN AND IMMEDIATELY PROJECTILE VOMITS. BLAGGG!
text: CESAR DIVES FOR HER GUN, AIMS ON MARSHALL BUT--click!click!
scene_heading: REFLEX: MARSHALL AIMS ON CESAR--BANG!--PLUGS HIM IN THE GUT.
text: SO RUTH VOMITS A SECOND, MORE EXPLOSIVE TIME. BLARRGAH!
scene_heading: LIKE A WOUNDED BOAR, CESAR CHARGES MARSHALL WHO FIRES AGAIN-—
text: BANG!--BUT MISSES AND THEY GRAPPLE FEROCIOUSLY, SLOPPILY.
text: ACROSS THE ROOM, Dez swings the shotgun around to cover
text: Meredith, who alllmost leapt off the couch in her fury but--
speaker_heading: DEZ
text: KEEP STILL!
text: Rumack MOANS at Dez’s feet as--
text: IN THEIR GRAPPLING, Cesar tears Marshall’s mask off just as--
text: BANG!--Marshall manages to tag him in the head. BRAINS FLY.
text: And at this, RUTH VOMITS A THIRD GEYSER-LIKE TIME. BWOOOGAHH!
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
text: OKAY NOW EVERYONE JUST HOLD IT.
text: Shaky, vibrating silence in a swirl of cordite.
text: Marshall turns in place, scanning for additional threats.
text: We'll probably notice that he’s wet his pants.
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL (CONT'D)
dialog: Just...hold it for a second. Jesus.
dialog: Wow.
text: Rumack, hunched over his bloody hand, teeth clenched in pain,
text: squints up at him...
speaker_heading: RUMACK
dialog: I know you. Marshall, right? Your
dialog: name’s Marshall. You were at one of
dialog: Christian's hearings last year.
text: Marshall stares at him, his eyes now darting to--
text: Ruth and Meredith: they heard his name. Saw his face.
text: His eyes dart to Dez, something dark passing between them.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: (refocusing on Rumack)
dialog: Go on. Get into the fireplace.
text: Silence. Rumack glares at Marshall with white-hot hatred.
text: Ruth gapes in mounting dread: fireplace? What?
speaker_heading: MARSHALL (CONT'D)
dialog: C'mon. I’1l make it nasty if I have
dialog: to.
speaker_heading: RUMACK
dialog: Is Christian with you?
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: I don’t...look, we’re not talking
dialog: about this. Just do it, okay?
speaker_heading: RUMACK
dialog: What’d he tell you? That I keep
dialog: cash around? I haven’t seen him in
dialog: months, you amateurs, it’s not here
dialog: anymore.
text: Marshall looks like he might have an aneurysm but instead
text: storms over to RIP THE ELECTRIC FIREPLACE LOG OUT thus--
text: Revealing the SMALL SAFE embedded in the FIREPLACE FLOOR.
text: Marshall points to it like a teacher points to a blackboard.
text: Rumack sighs, staggers upright and hobbles across the room.
text: As he begins to work the DIAL under Marshall's watchful eye--
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Chrissy told us about the iron in
dialog: there too, so don’t even try that
dialog: shit.
speaker_heading: RUMACK
dialog: Got it all mapped out, dontcha.
text: Over by the couch, Ruth realizes Meredith is staring at her--
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (desperate whisper)
dialog: I'm a hostage. I was kidnapped.
text: (points to the wound on
dialog: her forehead)
dialog: The empty gun?
text: Meredith's expression shifts, hearing the truth in that, but--
speaker_heading: DEZ
dialog: Stop talking.
text: KLIK! THE SAFE unlocks. Marshall waves Rumack aside.
text: Covering Ruth and Meredith, Dez cranes her neck to see--
text: --as Marshall reaches inside, his fingers scrabbling. But a
text: look of dismay quickly overtakes his face.
text: Rumack grins evilly.
speaker_heading: RUMACK
dialog: That's right, dumb-dumb. You just
dialog: bought yourself a murder one ticket
dialog: for nothing.
text: Woozily, Marshall pulls out a little .25 AUTO, a few
text: PASSPORTS, some STOCK CERTIFICATES...but no cash. Zilch-o.
text: He looks at Rumack like he just learned there’s no Santa.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: But...Chrissy said...
speaker_heading: RUMACK
dialog: Times are tough all over.
dialog: (but darkening now)
dialog: Where is my son?
text: Marshall summons back some force of his own...
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: You don’t have a son, buddy.
dialog: Pink (mm/dd/yyyy) 87.
text: That takes the wind out of Rumack’s sails.
text: Dez’s eyes blaze crazily in the mask, impatient and outraged.
dialog: Fuck it: she aims on Ruth and Meredith--
speaker_heading: DEZ
dialog: We’re done here.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: NO.
text: Ruth bolts upright, putting herself between Meredith and the
text: coming shotgun blast. Rumack tenses and Marshall aims on him.
text: You can hear a pin drop. Ruth stares at Dez, shivering.
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT’D)
dialog: I won’t let you shoot anyone.
text: Dez gestures wanly at Cesar’s corpse, like ‘Oh no?’
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT’D)
dialog: Anyone else, I mean.
text: Ruth shakes, fully exposed there before the shotgun.
text: Meredith blinks rapidly, hyperventilating, a PANIC ATTACK.
text: Rumack gauges the distance between him and Marshall.
text: Dez squares the shotgun on Ruth’s face but...
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT’D)
dialog: You’1l have to kill me first.
text: Dez glances to Marshall, who shrugs in careless defeat, Just
dialog: do it already.
text: DEZ'S FINGER tightens around the trigger...
text: SHK. Suddenly, oddly, A THROWING STAR IS STUCK IN DEZ’S FACE.
text: TONY is posed post-throw in the vestibule, wide-eyed, just
text: now dropping the rattan TIGER he’d dragged in with him. Wump.
text: Dez SHRIEKS, tears the cloth of her mask, rips it free: the
text: METAL STAR is sunk deeply into the flesh of her cheek.
text: Rumack lunges at Marshall but--BANG!--Marshall panic fires
text: and POPS RUMACK’S HEAD OPEN.
text: DEZ WHIRLS the shotgun onto Tony, who SQUEALS, but--
text: BLAM! THE SHOTGUN EXPLODES IN HER HAND. FINGERS FLY.
dialog: 88.
text: MEREDITH SPRINGS LIKE A GAZELLE OUT OF THE ROOM. Just, poof!,
text: off like a shot, gone before Dez is finished collapsing.
text: Marshall whirls his gun onto Tony but--
text: RUTH SPRINGS AT HIM, a spastic flying-squirrel leap that
text: KNOCKS HIM DOWN as she claws at his WAVING GUN HAND--
text: Tony sees this--Ruth in danger!--and he charges but--
text: Dez, even with her FINGERS BLOWN OFF, her face knotted in
text: rage, uses her good hand to pop her SWITCHBLADE--SNIKT!
text: SHE LAUNCES INTO TONY AND STABS HIM REPEATEDLY IN THE GUT,
text: LIGHTNING FAST--tk!tk!tk!tk!tk! She’s a human tattoo gun.
text: As Tony falls, clutching himself, Dez pivots to face the
text: thrashing tangle of Ruth and Marshall, HER KNIFE RAISED, that
text: THROWING STAR still glinting in the side of her face--
text: RUTH BITES MARSHALL’S HAND, MAKES HIM FIRE ONE SHOT--BANG!
scene_heading: PTEW! WHICH RICOCHETS OFF THE GRANITE FIREPLACE--
text: KAK! WHICH POPS INTO DEZ’S TEMPLE IN A MIST OF PINK.
text: As the abruptly lifeless Dez puddles to the ground...
text: As Tony rolls in a growing pool of his own blood...
text: RUTH CLAMPS ON MARSHALL’S HAND LIKE A PIT BULL. (Did you know
dialog: it takes a crowbar to pry their jaws off? It’s true.)
text: MARSHALL BUCKS AND SQUIRMS AND HOWLS. Sounds like a coyote
text: caught in a bear trap.
text: RUTH WRIGGLES HER FINGERS AGAINST THE .45 TRIGGER AND--
scene_heading: BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!--FIRES IT REPEATEDLY UNTIL--
text: CLICK! THE SLIDE RACKS BACK ON AN EMPTY CHAMBER.
text: Which prompts a surge in her as SHE TWISTS THE .45 FROM
text: MARSHALL’S BLOODY HAND AND--WUP!--CLUBS HIS FACE WITH IT.
text: And for good measure--KAP!--SHE CLUBS HIS KNEE, TOO. Maybe
dialog: breaking it? Sure did make a gnarly sound.
scene_heading: EXT. RURAL ROAD - SAME
text: Oh, also, MEREDITH SPRINTS down this secluded forest road.
dialog: She must have been a competitive runner at some point: her
text: form is perfect, she is tireless, not stopping for anything.
dialog: 89.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT ROOM - RUMACK MANSION - SAME
text: Ruth scrabbles to Tony, fluttering over his wounds--
speaker_heading: RUTH TONY
dialog: Tony! Tony! Oooh she got me good...
text: IN THE BACKGROUND, Marshall staggers bloody-faced to his
text: feet...and he is now between them and the front door.
text: His eyes snap to the .25 AUTO on the ground. He SNATCHES it.
text: Ruth catches this movement and HEAVES TONY TO HIS FEET--
text: As Marshall fumbles the gun, racks the slide, aims it--
text: She shoves Tony out into the--
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: BAM! BAM! SMALL CALIBER GUNSHOTS POP INTO THE WALL directly
text: behind them as they stumble/flee away, Ruth powering Tony
text: forward like a busted shopping cart.
scene_heading: EXT. BACK DOOR - RUMACK MANSION - SAME
text: Ruth and Tony burst outside and she scans frantically for an
text: escape route, propping him up as he hugs his bloody middle.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT ROOM - RUMACK MANSION - SAME
dialog: Look at all this fucking blood. Dead Cesar. Dead Rumack.
text: Marshall crouches over Dead Dez: silently sobbing and undone.
text: Wanting to touch her face, her mouth, but afraid to, because
dialog: she’s a spirit now.
scene_heading: EXT. REAR GROUNDS - RUMACK MANSION - DAY
text: TRACKING RUTH AND TONY, most of his weight supported on her
text: shoulder as they lurch desperately AROUND THE HUGE HOUSE...
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT YARD - RUMACK MANSION - CONTINUOUS
text: COMING AROUND THE HOUSE, Ruth heaves and strains under Tony’s
text: bloody semi-limp bulk, but freezing suddenly because--
dialog: 90.
text: MARSHALL, out there in the front yard, crazed and spattered
text: and blocking their way to the road. He spots them, HISSES
text: like a poisonous toad and LIMP-RUNS towards them.
text: RUTH JERKS TONY back around the house.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - SAME
text: TRACKING RUTH AND TONY DOWN THIS STEEP INCLINE, weaving
text: through the brush and tree cover. Tony can barely stand and
text: Ruth can barely keep him going.
text: But her face is set: hard and determined.
text: Behind them, echoing in the forest, the MOON HOWL of a rabid
text: animal. That’d be Marshall, screaming insane nonsense.
text: Ruth urges Tony faster. He trips, FALLS, dragging her down
text: with him, CRYING OUT in renewed pain.
text: She recovers, helps him up, looks frantically up the hill:
text: There’s nobody in sight...but she can hear SOMETHING crashing
text: this way through the brush. It HOWLS again.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL (0.S.)
dialog: Gonnna get yoooooouu!
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Tony. Get up. Let’s go.
text: She powers him up, moves him forward, faster, faster, hurry.
text: UP AHEAD, what's that?, some kind of MIRRORED LIGHT glints
text: strangely through the veil of old pines. Water?
scene_heading: EXT. POND - SAME
text: They burst onto a SMALL SANDY BEACH to see that it’s a

dialog: hundred yards out there...or perhaps it’s the far banks?
text: A WOODEN DOCK extends from the beach, with a SMALL OUTBOARD
text: FISHING SKIFF moored there, as well as a FLAT-BOTTOM ROWBOAT.
text: Ruth scans: to either side of the beach is just a clog of
text: roots, brush, eroded earth. Another HOWL behind them, closer.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Come on.
dialog: Pink (mm/dd/yyyy) 91.
text: She bulls Tony onto the DOCK, lets him sag there as she hops
dialog: into the MOTORBOAT where--
text: She YANKS the motor pull cord. It SPUTTERS and RUMBLES...but
text: doesn’t turn over. She yanks again. And again. Nothing.
text: Her eyes snap to the ROWBOAT.
scene_heading: EXT. ROWBOAT - POND - SECONDS LATER
text: Tony collapses into the bow, whimpering, as Ruth uses an OAR
text: to push them off the dock, braces her feet on the hull...
text: And ROWS LIKE HELL. She has adrenaline super-powers and the
text: little boat slides out into the pond.
text: THE BEACH recedes behind her, she’s staring at it as she rows
text: steadily. No sign of Marshall. She looks over her shoulder to
text: see where they’re heading...the ISLAND on the far side.
text: But also in her view is Tony: pale, drooping, barely awake.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: HEY. Stay awake, okay?
text: He nods weakly, not at all convincing. She looks back and...
text: IN THE DISTANCE, there’s the small shape of MARSHALL on the
text: beach now. Standing there, staring at them.
text: She makes a strangled noise and ROWS HARDER.
text: The little MARSHALL-SHAPE appears to take aim. There is a
text: distant popt! and something HUMS over Ruth’s head.
text: She ducks low and ROWS EVEN HARDER as another popt! carries
text: over the water. Another. Something PLUNKS the water nearby.
text: THE ISLAND looms near, maybe fifty feet to go? She ROWS. But--
text: IN THE DISTANCE, she can see the MARSHALL-SHAPE getting into
text: the MOTORBOAT. The MOTOR growls to life out there.
text: And now it's coming this way. Quickly closing the gap between
dialog: them.
text: She heaves against the oars. The oar-locks SNAP and RATTLE
text: with the force of her effort. Her BREATH pulses raggedly.
text: And here comes the motorboat, ever closer with Marshall
text: visible there, his hand on the tiller. He's pointing at her.
dialog: Pink (mm/dd/yyyy) 92.
scene_heading: EXT. MARSHY ISLAND - CONTINUOUS
text: THE ROWBOAT’S BOW crunches against soft land. Ruth startles,
text: didn’t realize she was so close, she scrambles into the bow--
text: SHE DRAGS TONY OUT and grabs the balled-up GREEN WEATHER TARP
text: as she goes, glancing out at--
text: THE MOTORBOAT, zooming in, forty feet away, thirty five. She
text: can see the details of Marshall’s blood-caked face.
text: DEEPER IN THE BRUSH, she leads Tony to a MOSSY OVERHANG,
text: presses him down onto the ground, pulls the WEATHER COVER
text: over him like a kid home sick from school--
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (frantic whisper)
dialog: Stay here. Don't move. Don't make a
text: sound. He's coming.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: «..W-why?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: We know who he is.
text: SHE TEARS HER SLEEVE OFF, presses it to his wounds, presses
text: his hands down on top of it...
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT’D)
dialog: Keep pressure there, okay? I'll be
dialog: back.
text: She starts to cover him but he grabs at her hand--
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I'm scared.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Me too. Don't move.
text: She kisses his forehead, pulls the cover over him and wipes
text: an armful of DEAD LEAVES over it. Not exactly invisible but
dialog: it’1l have to do...
text: RUTH EMERGES FROM THE TREE LINE and waves her arms just as--
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT’D)
dialog: Hey, fuckface!
text: THE MOTORBOAT RUNS AGROUND and Marshall comes hobbling over
text: the bow, waving that .25 wildly in her direction.
text: SHE RUNS back into the TREES, away from Tony, as--
dialog: 93.
text: BAM! BAM! BAM! BULLETS WHIZ OVER AND AROUND HER.
text: SHE SPRINTS THROUGH THE DARK TANGLE OF VEGETATION.
text: Her feet SUCK into saturated ground. BRANCHES slash at her
dialog: face.
text: BEHIND HER, Marshall takes steady aim at her quickly
text: vanishing form and--BAM!BAM!BAM! Click.
text: Blowing in frustration, he tosses the empty weapon aside and
text: dashes after her.
scene_heading: EXT. DEEP INTO THE MARSHY ISLAND - SAME
text: RUTH LEAPS DOWN A LOW HILL, stumbles, unable to control her
dialog: momentum and--
text: SPLASH! DROPS INTO BLACK CHEST-DEEP WATER. The layer of
text: leaves on the surface made it practically invisible.
text: Gasping and sputtering, she reaches about for something to
text: hold onto...there! A ROOT dangling into the pool...
text: Taking hold, she pulls herself forward...but she freezes.
text: If her expression was one of frightened determination before,
text: it is now replaced by a sort of existential cosmic terror.
text: CLOSE ON THE BROWN BEADY-EYED SNOUT OF A COTTONMOUTH SNAKE,
text: calmly winding its way across the surface of the dark water.
text: CLOSE ON RUTH, locking eyes with this evil, alien thing.
text: A BIRD’S EYE VIEW ON THE POOL: where Ruth holds perfectly
text: still and the undulating S-shape of the snake's body glides
text: within striking distance of her face. It takes forever but...
text: ...it passes her by. Not exactly breathing again, she inches
text: her way up out of the pool, pulling herself on the root.
text: On solid ground again, shuddering, she looks back to see...
text: MARSHALL, emerging from the forest, this limping curl-handed
text: troll. He sees her. His eyes blaze with hate and killin’.
text: HE LIMP-TROTS towards her.
text: SHE SCRAMBLES UP A MUDDY RIDGE, taking the high ground.
text: TRACKING WITH RUTH as she moves along the ridge but, DOWN
text: BELOW, Marshall keeps pace with her.
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: I see you, girl.
text: RUTH DOUBLES BACK but Marshall keeps pace again.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL (CONT'D)
dialog: Gonna get ya.
text: SHE HIDES BEHIND A TREE, stooping to grab a BASEBALL-SIZED
text: ROCK out of the muck at her feet. Catching her breath.
text: IN THE BACKGROUND, BELOW THE RIDGE, we can see Marshall
text: catching his breath, too. Watching her hiding place.
text: Without being able to see one another, they call out...
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Why don’t you just leave me alone?
text: From below, he chuckles wetly and brings out a BUTTERFLY
text: KNIFE, quietly unfolds it.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Sure. Come on down here, we'll
text: shake on it.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: You do those tattoos yourself?
text: He glances in brief uncertainty at his hands.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Some.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Yeah? Well, they looking fucking
dialog: stupid.
text: MARSHALL EDGES CLOSER, nearing the base of the ridge,
dialog: tracking her voice...
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: You ever eat cat meat?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: You mean...cat food?
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
text: No. The meat of a cat.
text: HE BEGINS TO CRAWL UP THE RIDGE, slithering closer to her
text: behind the tree there, that gleaming blade in his fist...
dialog: 95.
text: FROM BEHIND THE TREE, Ruth looks for an escape. Further up is
text: all BRUSH AND VINES, too thick to even see through. Trapped.
text: So she collects a SECOND ROCK and edges around the tree to
dialog: try and see him...
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: No, man. I never ate any cat meat.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: It makes you be invisible. Did you
dialog: know that?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Have you eaten cat meat?
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: That’s what my marks are for.
text: CLOSE ON RUTH, just a sliver of her eyeball visible around
text: the curve of the tree as she sees...
text: A SLIVER OF MARSHALL'S HEAD, just starting to appear up the
dialog: ridge, very close now...
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Yeah, well, that shit doesn’t work
dialog: because I can see you.
text: Marshall looks up. Their eyes meet. He grins nastily.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Doesn't last forever, a’course.
text: There’s a charged moment, two animals clocking each other in
dialog: the bad bush, and then...
speaker_heading: MARSHALL (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: AHHHH!
scene_heading: MARSHALL CHARGES, KNIFE RAISED OVER HIS HEAD-—
text: RUTH STEPS OUT AND HURLS THE FIRST ROCK--PUNK!
text: IT BRAINS MARSHALL SQUARE BETWEEN THE EYES AND HE SLIPS BACK,
text: ARMS PINWHEELING TO KEEP HIS BALANCE BUT--
scene_heading: RUTH PRESSES FORWARD AND HURLS THE SECOND ROCK--PUNK!
text: WHICH CLIPS HIM IN THE COLLARBONE AND SPINS HIM--
scene_heading: HE TUMBLES ASS-OVER-KETTLE BACK DOWN THE RIDGE AND--
scene_heading: K-SPLASH! LANDS WHOLE-BODY IN THAT BLACK POOL OF WATER--
dialog: 96.
scene_heading: WHERE HE INSTANTLY THRASHES AND SHRIEKS-——
text: RUTH HOPS DOWN THE RIDGE AND CIRCLES WIDE BECAUSE--—
text: MARSHALL HAS THAT COTTONMOUTH SNAKE DANGLING FROM HIS CHEEK.
dialog: 
text: His SCREAM is as high and piercing as a tea kettle on boil.
text: His MAD EYES know he’s done with that fat brown rope curling
text: on itself, latched onto his face as he lurches in the muck.
text: RUTH SPRINTS THROUGH THE FOREST. Jagged, disconnected
text: glimpses of movement, her POUNDING BREATH subsumes all sound
text: in the mix, even Marshall’s sickly keening.
text: She runs faster and faster through the dim slash of vines and
text: low branches, ONE SHOT INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE NEXT.
text: She pauses, looking left and right: which way? She runs but
text: quickly doubles back. She runs. She doubles back again.
text: SHE TURNS IN PLACE, surrounded on all sides by trees and
text: gloom, trees and gloom, trees and gloom. It all looks the
text: same. She is lost.
text: For the first time on this island, the fire in her seems to
text: go out. She sags against a tree, sinking into despair.
text: But then she sees something. It stops her breathing.
text: THERE IN THE DISTANCE, standing calmly beside a great mossy
text: tree in her neat pantsuit with a Virginia Slim 100 carefully
text: balanced in her thin fingers, is GRANDMA SALLY.
text: Ruth stares at her in dreamy exhaustion.
text: Sally takes a demure drag and, with a knowing smile, tips her
text: head in a certain direction. That way.
text: Ruth’s eyes fill with tears as all sound is replaced by an
scene_heading: OLD COUNTRY GOSPEL STANDARD, “This World Is Not My Home” by
dialog: Fern Jones.
dialog: ‘I can't feel at home in this world anymore,’ Fern warbles
text: over a plucky banjo, this SONG carrying over as...
scene_heading: EXT. MOSSY OVERHANG - TWILIGHT
text: Ruth returns to Tony’s hiding place, yanks the cover back...
text: But he’s dead. Ghostly white, eyes closed in peace.
text: We can’t hear her wail of grief but she doesn’t pause for a
text: second, wrapping her arms around his middle, hoisting him up.
dialog: 97.
scene_heading: EXT. DEEP WOODS - TWILIGHT
text: Marshall crawls along the forest floor, slug-like, lost. His
text: face is HUGELY SWOLLEN around black FANG MARKS, a vivid
text: scarlet hue. His TONGUE lolls wetly in his yellow mouth.
text: He howls but of course we can’t hear him.
text: In the sky above, CROWS are already circling.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTORBOAT (MOVING) - TWILIGHT
text: THE SONG CONTINUES as Ruth angles the boat full-throttle
text: across the water, tears spilling down her cheeks but wholly
text: focused on the task of getting them back to shore.
text: Curled in the bow like a rag doll, Tony could almost be
dialog: asleep.
scene_heading: INT. DETECTIVE CUBICLE - POLICE STATION - NIGHT
text: THE SONG CONTINUES over this CLOSE-UP ON THREE DMV PRINTOUTS:
text: driver's license shots of Marshall, Dez, and Ruth.
text: A HAND slides the shots of Marshall and Dez to one side...and
text: then taps the shot of Ruth.
text: It's MEREDITH, her eyes puffy from crying but in control. She
text: taps Ruth’s photo again and simply shakes her head. Not her.
scene_heading: INT. BENDIX’S CUBICLE - POLICE STATION - NIGHT
text: THE SONG CONTINUES as we find Ruth sitting here, a BANDAGE
text: over her brow, numbed by grief. She’s very still, just
dialog: watching as...
text: Detective Bendix intently reads over a series of REPORT
text: SHEETS. He finally sets them aside, nodding to himself.
text: Ruth stares at him. He stares back. Exhales hugely, about to
dialog: make a huge pronouncement.
speaker_heading: BENDIX
dialog: My wife and I are going to give it
dialog: another shot.
text: He nods sagely, as if this must answer any and all questions.
text: Ruth stares at him.
dialog: Pink (mm/dd/yyyy) 98.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - CARE CENTER - DAY
text: THE SONG CONTINUES and some time has passed now, because Ruth
text: just has a regular small BAND AID over her brow.
text: She listlessly strips an empty bed, wadding up sheets that
text: have a small smear of blood on them. Robotic in her work.
scene_heading: INT. RUTH’S CAR (MOVING) - DAY
text: THE SONG CONTINUES as we find Ruth though the windshield,
text: staring numbly out at...
text: THAT ROLLIN’ COAL PICKUP, ahead of her in traffic again,
text: blowing its black sooty smoke into the air.
text: She has no reaction.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - DAY
text: THE SONG CONTINUES as we PUSH DOWN THE AISLE, past rows of
text: CHURCHGOERS, to find Ruth sitting all alone in the back pew.
text: She's staring off, maybe listening to the sermon, maybe not.
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - TWILIGHT
text: THE SONG FADES AWAY now and we find Ruth sitting in one of
text: her outdoor chairs, gazing out contemplatively.
text: An upbeat OLDIE ("Don’t Hang Up” by The Orlons) plays on a
text: portable speaker somewhere, but sounds distant and faint.
text: She sips a SODA POP, Tony’s brand. We realize that she is
dialog: looking at...
text: JANA, by the fence, watching a blinking chorus of FIREFLIES.
text: Not trying to capture them, just watching, delighted.
text: Angie is in the chair next to Ruth, a fresh drink in her
text: hand. They sit in silence a moment. Angie eyes her.
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: You okay?
text: Ruth nods absently.
speaker_heading: ANGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Be gentle with yourself, okay? You
dialog: got all the time in the world.
text: Ruth takes a deep breath, nods again, but...
dialog: Pink (mm/dd/yyyy) 99.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I don’t know what that means.
text: Angie looks out at Jana, shrugs...
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: It’s just something people say.
text: Ruth sniffs, a tired little laugh. And then she turns her
text: head. Sees something. Stares at it a bit.
text: TONY smiles at her from within a white Heavenly mist. A dream
text: or a ghost or a vision.
text: Ruth smiles back.
dialog: WIDER, oh, okay, it actually is Tony, for real: he uses a
text: cane now, and he’s working the smoking grill, just burning
dialog: the shit out of some hamburgers.
text: Dan looks on in obvious disapproval, shaking his head.
text: Tony points the spatula at Ruth, gives an assured thumbs up.
text: She smiles and looks back to...
text: THE FIREFLIES. Look at ‘em glow and vanish in the fade.
text: CUT TO BLACK.
text: As “I Love You, Honeybear” by Father John Misty takes us into
dialog: the credits...
