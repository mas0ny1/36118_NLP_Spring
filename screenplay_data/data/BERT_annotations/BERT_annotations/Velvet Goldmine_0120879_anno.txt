dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURT
dialog: Hey –
dialog: 
text: Arthur’s eye darts up. He sees:
dialog: 
dialog: A luminous spacecraft, like the one
text: that passed over Old Dublin. It swirls over London with a thunderous boom – and vanishes.
dialog: 
dialog: All that remains is a sky full of
dialog: glitterdust.
dialog: 
dialog: CLOSE ON Curt’s lips, whispering
dialog: through the cascade.
dialog: 
text: A WIDE SHOT of the roof, now awash in
text: stardust, as the white bodies of Curt and Arthur are seen through the sparkles;
text: Curt behind Arthur, gently fucking. A long, slow CRANE Out begins, as music and
dialog: voices peak.
dialog: 
dialog: And see
dialog: yourself, on-stage, inside-out. A tangle of garlands in your hair. Of course you

scene_heading: INT. STAGE – GRAND BALLROOM SET – NIGHT
dialog: 
dialog: The

dialog: to sing (‘Tumbling Down’/Steve Harley Cockney Rebel), slowly descending a
dialog: gnarled staircase as we PULL OUT.
dialog: 
text: He stops at a half-blown landing just
text: as a tattered chandelier is raised into frame. He mounts the shimmering beast,

dialog: 
dialog: There are cheers as Tommy Stone

dialog: 
text: A huge spotlight is turned on to the

dialog: 
text: Arthur stops and watches.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REPORTERS
dialog: Tommy! Tommy!
dialog: Where did you get the idea for such a spectacular stadium show?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Tell you the
dialog: truth – it’s a bloody pain in the ass! The whole thing takes six full size rigs
dialog: or three chartered planes to transport. What can I say? I think big!
dialog: 
text: Arthur approaches the crowd.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REPORTERS
dialog: Tommy! What’s
dialog: your opinion on the work of President Reynolds has been doing-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Excellent.
dialog: Excellent. I think he’s doing brilliant work. He’s a – tremendous leader, a
dialog: tremendous spokesperson for the needs of the nation today –
dialog: 
text: Suddenly Arthur yells out over the
dialog: others:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Tommy! What
dialog: is your response to the recent allegations connecting you to bisexual pop singer
dialog: Brian Slade, who staged his own assassination ten years ago this week in London?
dialog: 
dialog: Tommy is white.
dialog: 
text: Reporters swarm as Arthur watches.
dialog: 
dialog: Tommy, devoured by Security Men,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I’m sorry,

speaker_heading: TV
dialog: Tonight, the

speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: (to everyone in the room, but Brian)
dialog: Get Out! Now!
dialog: Shut the door!
dialog: 
dialog: CLOSE ON Shannon, eyes shut, as

dialog: from the TV.
dialog: 
dialog: Tommy looks over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TV SCREEN
dialog: 
dialog: The news broadcast of the Tommy Stone

dialog: 
text: The door shuts behind Arthur in a
dialog: dark mid-town bar.
dialog: 
text: Everyone looks up. There is a strange
dialog: between-songs silence.
dialog: 
dialog: Arthur proceeds, self consciously.
dialog: 
dialog: A Tommy Stone song beings on the
dialog: jukebox. (‘People Rockin’ People’/Shudder To Think) but people in the bar
dialog: continue staring at Arthur.
dialog: 
text: He approaches the bar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Beer, please.
dialog: 
dialog: Arthur notices a group of mostly
text: black Teenagers, decked out in Tommy Stone gear. They whisper to each other. One
dialog: Teenage Girl starts walking over.
dialog: 
dialog: The Bartender hands Arthur his beer,
text: staring all the while at Arthur’s jacket.
dialog: 
text: Arthur realizes he’s still wearing
text: his press pass and starts taking it off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEENAGE GIRL
dialog: Excuse me,
dialog: sir. Are you with the Tommy Stone Tour?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: No. I’m just
dialog: a journalist. Perhaps you’d like my press pass as a souvenir?
dialog: 
text: Her eyes widen. Arthur hands her the
dialog: pass.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEENAGE GIRL
dialog: Thanks,
dialog: Mister.
dialog: 
text: She squeals and runs back to show her
text: friends as Arthur turns and walks deeper into the long, narrow bar.
dialog: 
text: He passes the jukebox, and discovers
text: a second bar in the back: smaller and moodier. A man in a leather jacket is
dialog: drinking along.
dialog: 
dialog: Arthur stops. He can’t believe his
dialog: eyes.
dialog: 
dialog: It’s Curt Wild, folding a Tommy Stone
dialog: guest pass into origami.
dialog: 
dialog: Arthur smiles and starts advancing
dialog: before even deciding to.
dialog: 
text: Curt looks up. He just glares.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: You’re Curt
dialog: Wild.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURT
dialog: (irritable)
dialog: Yeah? Who the
dialog: hell are you?
dialog: 
dialog: Brief silence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I’m a
dialog: journalist. From the Herald. You were at the concert?
dialog: 
text: Curt just stares at him.
dialog: 
dialog: It’s just
dialog: funny because...well, I was just trying to contact you actually. For a story I
dialog: was doing –
dialog: 
dialog: Curt has now turned away.
dialog: 
dialog: -about an old
dialog: friend of yours? Brian Slade?
dialog: 
text: Curt looks up for a moment, hiding
dialog: his interest.
dialog: 
dialog: Was trying to
dialog: find out...what actually happened to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURT
dialog: Look –
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I mean,
dialog: before he became –
dialog: 
dialog: Curt stops.
dialog: 
text: Tight on Arthur, peeking up at him.
dialog: 
dialog: -such a
dialog: mystery.
dialog: 
text: Curt snorts out a sudden guffaw.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURT
dialog: Look, man, I
dialog: don’t know who you’ve been talking to or what you’re after here, but...
dialog: (trails off)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What?
dialog: 
text: Curt looks away again..
dialog: 
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURT
dialog: Listen – a
dialog: real artist creates beautiful things and...puts nothing of his won life into
dialog: them. Okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Is that what
dialog: you did?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURT
dialog: No.
dialog: (brief silence)
dialog: We set out to
dialog: change the world and ended up...just changing ourselves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What’s wrong
dialog: with that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURT
dialog: Nothing.
dialog: (silence)
dialog: If you don’t
dialog: look at the world.
dialog: 
dialog: Quiet music under slow
text: PAN past kids gathered at the jukebox, cliques of Tommy Stone fans,
text: conservative, bored. One gay Latino Boy sits braiding a girls hair. End on a
dialog: huge Tommy Stone poster.
dialog: 
dialog: (off-screen)
dialog: Well, I guess
dialog: in the end he got what he wanted.
dialog: 
dialog: Curt stands in though another beat
text: before slipping on his jacket and downing his beer.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON Arthur looking up at him
text: with a distant smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: That’s quite

speaker_heading: CURT
dialog: Oh yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Is it old?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURT
dialog: (examining it)
dialog: Possibly. It
dialog: belonged to Oscar Wilde. Or so I was told by the person who gave it to me.
dialog: 
text: Arthur’s eyes flash up. The shimmer
dialog: swells.
dialog: 
dialog: This friend
