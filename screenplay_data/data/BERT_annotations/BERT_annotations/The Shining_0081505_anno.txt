speaker_heading: WATSON
dialog: Well this ought to be quite a

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: M.C.S. JACK
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, I'm looking for a change.
speaker_heading: ULLMAN (OFF)
dialog: Our people in Denver recommended

dialog: agree with them.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: M.S. ULLMAN
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: ULLMAN
dialog: Let's see, where were we? Yes. I
dialog: was about to explain that eh... our
dialog: season here runs from oh May 15th
dialog: to October 30th and then we close
dialog: down completely until the following
dialog: May.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: M.C.S. JACK
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Do you mind if I ask why you do
dialog: that? It seems to me that the

speaker_heading: ULLMAN (OFF)
dialog: Oh, it sure would be
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: M.S. ULLMAN
speaker_heading: ULLMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: but the problem is the enormous
dialog: cost it would be to keep the road
text: to the Sidewinder open. It's a...
text: It's a 25 mile stretch of road -
dialog: gets an average of 20 feet of snow
dialog: during the winter, and there's just
dialog: no way to make it economically
dialog: feasible to keep it clear. When
dialog: the place was built in 1907, there
dialog: was very little interest in winter
dialog: sports, and this site was chosen
dialog: for its seclusion and scenic beauty.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: M.L.S. ULLMAN over WATSON & JACK.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, it's certainly got plenty of
dialog: that.
text: JACK laughs.
speaker_heading: ULLMAN
dialog: That's right. And did they give
dialog: you any idea in Denver about what
dialog: the job entails?
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Only in a very general way.
speaker_heading: ULLMAN
dialog: Well...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: M.S. ULLMAN
speaker_heading: ULLMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: ...the winters can be fantastically
dialog: cruel, and the basic idea is
dialog: to...to cope with the very costly
dialog: damage and depreciation which can
dialog: occur. And this consists mainly of
dialog: running the boiler, heating
dialog: different parts of the hotel on a
dialog: daily rotating basis, repairing
dialog: damage as it occurs and doing
dialog: repairs, so that the elements can't
dialog: get a foothold.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: M.C.S. JACK
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, that sounds fine to me.
text: ULLMAN grunts off.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: M.S. ULLMAN
speaker_heading: ULLMAN
dialog: Physically, it's not a very
dialog: demanding job. The only thing that
dialog: can get a bit trying up here during
dialog: the winter is eh... the tremendous
dialog: sense of isolation.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: M.C.S. JACK
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, that just happens to be
dialog: exactly what I'm looking for. I'm
dialog: eh... I'm outlining a new writing
dialog: project, and eh...
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: five months of peace is just what I
dialog: want.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: M.S. ULLMAN
speaker_heading: ULLMAN

dialog: for some people eh solitude and
dialog: isolation...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: M.C.S. JACK.
speaker_heading: ULLMAN (OFF) (CONT'D)
dialog: can of itself be a problem.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Not for me.

speaker_heading: ULLMAN
dialog: How about your wife and son? How

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: They'll love it.
speaker_heading: ULLMAN (OFF)
dialog: Great...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: M.S. ULLMAN
speaker_heading: ULLMAN
dialog: Well, before I turn you over to
dialog: Bill, there is one other thing I
dialog: think we should talk about. I
dialog: don't want to sound melodramatic,
dialog: but it is something that's...
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: ULLMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: been known to give a few people
dialog: second thoughts about the job.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm intrigued.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: M.S. ULLMAN.
speaker_heading: ULLMAN
dialog: I don't suppose they eh told you
dialog: anything in Denver about the
dialog: tragedy we had up here during the
dialog: winter of 1970?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't believe they did.

speaker_heading: ULLMAN (OFF)
dialog: Well, my predecessor in this job
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: M.S. ULLMAN.
speaker_heading: ULLMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: hired a man named Charles Grady, as
text: the winter caretaker. He came up
dialog: here with his wife and two little
dialog: girls of about eight or ten. And
dialog: he had a good employment record,
dialog: good references and from what I've
dialog: been told, I mean, he seemed like a
dialog: completely normal individual. But
dialog: at some point during the winter, he
dialog: must have suffered some kind of a
dialog: complete mental breakdown.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: ULLMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: He ran amok and eh... killed his

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: M.C.S. JACK
speaker_heading: ULLMAN (OFF) (CONT'D)
text: stacked them neatly in one of the

dialog: um... then he put eh both barrels
text: of his shotgun in his mouth.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: M.S. ULLMAN sitting behind desk.
speaker_heading: ULLMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: The police eh... they thought that
dialog: it was what the old-timers used to

dialog: occur when people are
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: M.C.S. JACK

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, that is eh quite a story.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: M.S. ULLMAN laughs.
speaker_heading: ULLMAN
dialog: Yes, it is. Oh, it's still hard
dialog: for me to believe that it actually
dialog: happened here, but it did and eh...
dialog: I think you can appreciate why I
dialog: wanted to tell you about it.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: M.C.S. JACK.
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Ah, I certainly can, and eh... I

text: JACK laughs.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: U.S. ULLMAN laughing.
speaker_heading: ULLMAN
dialog: Well, obviously some people can be
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: M.C.S. JACK.
speaker_heading: ULLMAN (OFF) (CONT'D)
dialog: put off by the idea of staying
dialog: alone in a place where something
dialog: like that actually happened.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, you can rest assured Mr.
dialog: Ullman, that's not going to happen
dialog: with me, and eg as far as my wife
dialog: is concerned, I am sure she'll be
