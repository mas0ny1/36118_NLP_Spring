speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: An unparalleled economic

text: After years of chaos and despair,
dialog: the Arcon Systems Corporation, a
dialog: steel alloy, satellite, and
dialog: weapon’s manufacturer, bought the
dialog: bankrupt U.S. government’s debt
dialog: and, for the first time in

speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: After many failed attempts to

text: FADE TO BLACK.
scene_heading: TITLE CARD: THE PURGE
scene_heading: INT. YOUNG BOY’S BEDROOM —- MORNING
dialog: Not your typical 12 year old’s room. It’s bare - not
dialog: many toys, a few books. The proprietor of this room:
text: CHARLIE SANDIN - lies asleep in bed. Light spills
text: through blinds, waking him. He sits up, ready to start
dialog: his day.
text: Charlie immediately grabs a WRIST WATCH from his night
text: table - puts it on and presses a BUTTON on it - changing
text: the watches’ display from CLOCK to MEDICAL MONITOR which
text: begins BEEPING (an audio presentation of his pulse rate).
text: After a moment, the WATCH displays CHARLIE’S HEART RATE
speaker_heading: (55) and TEMPERATURE (98.5).
text: Charlie then picks up a CALENDAR BOOK - rifles through
text: PAGES, on which we see that Charlie has written down his
text: HEART RATE and TEMPERATURE every morning for the last 5
text: years. He reaches today’s date, when his eyes fall on
scene_heading: the page’s HEADER - MARCH 21 - THE ANNUAL PURGE. And
text: Charlie's face suddenly tightens with worry.
text: Charlie writes down his VITALS, then abruptly closes the
text: book - as if trying to hide the DATE that’s unsettled
text: him. But his expression tells us he isn’t successful.
text: Charlie then stands and approaches his DRESSER. He opens
text: a DRAWER, rifles through clothes, and does something odd;
text: he puts on another t-shirt over his shirt. He then puts
text: on yet another t-shirt over that. And he’s not finished;
text: Charlie puts on two more pairs of underwear. And as he
text: stands there, all layered up, we notice that Charlie’s a
text: handsome boy, but there’s something strange about him, in
text: the way he moves, the way he stares off.
text: Charlie then proceeds to his CLOSET. He opens it and
text: strangely walks INTO the closet, disappearing between
text: HANGING CLOTHES - when his skinny arm reaches back and
text: closes the closet door - shutting us out - and himself in
dialog: for some reason.
scene_heading: INT. LARGE BEDROOM —- MORNING
text: JAMES AND MARY SANDIN are awake in their bed. Both in
text: their early 40s. JAMES is handsome, tanned, fit. He’s
text: sitting up - on the PHONE - in smooth salesman work mode:
speaker_heading: JAMES (ON PHONE)
dialog: - Mr. Calhoun, the system will be
dialog: working without a hitch by the
dialog: time the Purge begins. I have a
dialog: service crew on their way now -
text: MARY SANDIN - next to James - is also tanned, in healthy
text: shape and pretty. She’s looking through magazines that
text: feature high-priced BOATS/YACHTS for SALE - barely paying
text: attention to the TV/INTERNET PROJECTION on the wall in
text: front of her playing the MORNING NEWS:
speaker_heading: NEWSCASTER 1
dialog: - For most, today began with the
dialog: tradition of displaying Baptisia
dialog: flowers outside their homes,
dialog: signifying cleansing, as tonight
dialog: brings us the tenth Annual Purge.
text: Mary ear-marks a page displaying a gorgeous YACHT as:
speaker_heading: NEWSCASTER 1 (CONT’D)
dialog: 90 percent of all Americans are
dialog: now in favor of this annual night,
dialog: and a recent Arcon evaluation of
dialog: the 10 percent who oppose the
dialog: Purge revealed that more than half
dialog: of this dissenting faction are
dialog: psychologically unstable.
text: The NEWS CUTS to a TAPED CLIP of A PONY-TAILED MEXICAN-
text: AMERICAN MAN standing on a STREET CORNER. His name is
text: CARMELO JOHNS and he’s holding a SIGN that reads; “DO NOT
text: CONFORM!", “VISIT THE-RESISTANCE.ORG FOR THE TRUTH!”
text: He’s YELLING WILDLY at PASSERBYS - most pay him no
text: attention at all - while others cast a weary eye on him:
speaker_heading: CARMELO JOHNS (ON TV)
dialog: - The Purge has cleaned up the
dialog: streets but at what cost? OUR
dialog: SOULS ARE AT STAKE!
text: Mary takes note of something Carmelo’s said when the TV
text: report cuts back to the NEWSCASTERS:
speaker_heading: NEWSCASTER 2 (ON TV)
text: The start of the Purge is Sundown -
dialog: 7 PM Standard - and some predict
dialog: elevated levels of violen -
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Mary raises the REMOTE - shuts the TV. Goes back to her
text: MAGAZINES - finds an ENORMOUS BOAT - her eyes light up.
text: She shows this boat to her husband who’s still on PHONE:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Look at this one, baby. Perfect.
text: James smiles - silently agreeing - as:
speaker_heading: JAMES (ON PHONE, CONT’D)
dialog: - Mr. Calhoun, Arcon makes the
dialog: strongest steel in the world. You
dialog: will be locked in tight tonight. -
dialog: Yessir, bye now.
text: James hangs up the phone.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (re: phone call)
dialog: Everything OK, babe?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Everyone’s doing security checks,
dialog: getting ready for tonight. If one
dialog: system I sold has a glitch, I’1l
dialog: lose the bonus.
text: Mary kisses her husband.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: It'll be fine. Now go get ready.
text: James stands. As he puts on a robe:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: What are you gonna do today, babe?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Not sure. Definitely go for a
dialog: run. Eating way too much lately.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You’re crazy. You look amazing.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Did you hear the scratching last
dialog: night?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: It woke me up at 3. What the hell
dialog: is it? It’s driving me crazy.
text: James shrugs - no idea. He starts out of the room, when
text: Mary stops him with:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Babe, before you go - we need to
dialog: talk to Zoey about this Henry
text: thing. She’s getting worse, moody
dialog: all the time.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: When I was 16 I wasn’t even
dialog: allowed to have a girlfriend.
dialog: We’re not being too harsh telling
text: her she can’t see him on school
dialog: nights.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Sometimes I think we push her too
dialog: hard, hun.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: By ‘we’ you mean ‘me’. And I push
dialog: her just enough. Look how great
dialog: she’s been doing. If she
dialog: continues on this track she can be
dialog: an executive at Arcon, Mary.
text: James smiles wide, excited by this idea. He kisses his
text: wife and heads out. Alone now, Mary turns back on the
text: TV/INTERNET PROJECTION, seeing a COMMERCIAL; a corporate
text: feel-good spot with soothing music over tranquil images -
scene_heading: PEOPLE PICNICKING, HOLDING BLUE BOUQUETS OF FLOWERS - as:
scene_heading: SOOTHING VOICE OVER (ON TV)
dialog: ...-Release the beast and connect
dialog: with yourself. Exercise your
dialog: right to Purge tonight. Arcon
dialog: encourages your participation.
scene_heading: INT. DAUGHTER ZOEY SANDIN’S BEDROOM —- MORNING
text: SCHOOL BOOKS everywhere. Impeccably neat. An impressive
scene_heading: WALL of AWARDS for MATH and WRITING CONTESTS - PLAQUES
text: for PIANO RECITALS - as well as a DOZEN SPORTS TROPHIES -
text: GYMNASTICS, TRACK. WE PAN OFF ALL THIS, FINDING:
scene_heading: The PROPRIETOR of these ACCOLADES - ZOEY SANDIN (16, All-
text: American, sweet-as-pie, cheerleader-type), passionately
text: KISSING her slightly older boyfriend - the aforementioned
text: HENRY (18, handsome, furrowed brow, forced teen
dialog: intensity).
text: Zoey and Henry stop kissing - staring deeply at each
text: other - young love in full obsessive melodramatic bloom.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: God, I love you too much.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: We’re gonna spend our lives
dialog: together, baby. We won’t be
dialog: sneaking around like this much
dialog: longer, trust me.
text: Zoey smiles - mesmerized - crazy in love. She embraces
text: Henry - he squeezes her tight, equally as infatuated.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: I thank God every day that you’re
dialog: in my life. But you should go.
dialog: All hell will break loose if he
dialog: sees you here now.
text: One last kiss - Henry then moves to the window and climbs
text: out, onto the balcony, disappearing below.
text: WE STAY WITH ZOEY - beaming with young love, when her
text: eyes fall on that WALL of TROPHIES and PLAQUES and PHOTOS
text: of HERSELF at PIANO RECITALS, BEAUTY CONTESTS, etc.
text: She stares at all of it - her bright smile fading.
scene_heading: INT. SANDIN HOUSE HALLWAY - MORNING
text: A LONG HALL decorated with PHOTOS of the attractive
text: SANDINS - JAMES, MARY, ZOEY and CHARLIE. We notice
text: something at the end of this corridor - it’s a foot high -
text: moving toward us. As it draws near, we see that it’s:
text: A RABBIT - hopping through the home. And it’s a strange
text: Rabbit, indeed. Its fur is green and white and weathered
text: terribly. It’s also missing its RIGHT EAR.
text: It’s an incongruous image - the weathered Rabbit hopping
text: through the pristine Sandin HALLS, until it comes upon:
text: MARY SANDIN (wearing a robe now) - IN THE KITCHEN -—
text: standing in front of the OPEN REFRIGERATOR - eating some
text: CAKE with great fervor. After a beat, Mary spots the
text: Rabbit. She smirks, then oddly talks to the bunny:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: No pictures, Charlie. I woke up
dialog: hungry. This is our secret.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. A DARK SMALL SPACE - SAME
text: BOXES piled in the corner - BOY’S CLOTHES hanging. It’s
text: a CLOSET that’s been turned into a secret hiding spot -
text: replete with a TOYS, BOOKS, DRAWINGS, as well as CANDID
scene_heading: PHOTOS of the SANDINS - MARY, JAMES and ZOEY (NOTE: no
scene_heading: PHOTOS of CHARLIE). We FIND:
text: YOUNG CHARLIE SANDIN - sitting on a small CHAIR in this,
text: his secret getaway. (NOTE: This is clearly the back of
text: Charlie's closet - into which he disappeared earlier.)
text: Charlie’s not only wearing those multiple LAYERS OF
text: CLOTHES, but he’s also now donning a bizarre pair of
scene_heading: SMALL, CIRCULAR DARK GLASSES/GOGGLES - as well as holding
text: an I-POD NANO-LIKE DEVICE which he handles expertly.
text: WE HOLD ON CHARLIE - in those dark GLASSES/GOGGLES,
text: seemingly staring off at nothing until we SEE what he’s
scene_heading: LOOKING AT:
text: HIS MOM - in the KITCHEN - smiling at the Rabbit - as we
text: just saw her. We quickly realize that CHARLIE’S GLASSES
text: are some kind of hi-tech MINI-MONITOR displaying the
text: RABBIT’S ROVING POV. With the glasses, Charlie can SEE
text: and HEAR (and PHOTOGRAPH) everything the Rabbit SEES and
dialog: HEARS - which is, right now, his Mom:
scene_heading: MARY (ON MINI-MONITOR INSIDE
speaker_heading: GLASSES )
dialog: I’m coming to visit, baby. I’11
dialog: bring Vic.
text: Charlie smiles. He removes those glasses, stands, moves
text: through the HANGING CLOTHES and emerges back into:
speaker_heading: HIS BEDROOM
text: Charlie jumps in bed - pulls the covers over his body -
text: obviously hiding the layers of clothes, when - KNOCK.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Come in.
text: The DOOR OPENS - MARY enters - cradling the Rabbit. She
text: places it on the dresser and then PLUGS a CORD into a
text: SLOT in its BACK while Charlie presses the I-Pod-like
text: device, HIGHLIGHTING a COMMAND - SLEEP MODE - causing:
text: THE RABBIT to close its eyes. And we realize that the
text: Rabbit is just an ultra-realistic remote-controlled
text: stuffed animal of tomorrow-land. As the Rabbit ‘sleeps’,
text: Mary sits next to Charlie on the bed.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Morning kiddo. How’s the vitals?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Slight deviation in my
dialog: temperature. Otherwise good.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I heard that scratching again late
dialog: last night.
dialog: (gestures toward the
dialog: weathered Rabbit)
dialog: I had Victor explore the whole
dialog: house - we didn’t find anything.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: We heard it too. Your dad thinks
text: it’s an animal stuck in the wall.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I think Daddy’s wrong.
text: They share a smile. Beat as Mary curiously notes the way
text: Charlie HOLDS the COVERS over his BODY.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Are you layering again, Charlie?
text: Charlie lowers his eyes, embarrassed by this. Mary leans
text: forward, gently pulling the covers off her son -—
text: revealing his THREE SHIRTS and THREE PAIRS OF UNDERWEAR.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Don’t tell Daddy.
text: Mary grins warmly at her red-faced son:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I won't. But don’t be embarrassed
dialog: by this, or checking your vitals,
dialog: or whatever. Who knows why we do
dialog: things, baby? It’s all OK.
text: Charlie smiles - feeling better. Mary ruffles his hair
text: and then tickles him - she adores her quirky boy. Their
text: laughter finally whittles, and as Mary stares at her son,
text: she sees his expression tighten into worry - just as it
text: did when he saw the DATE in his calendar book earlier.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: (knowingly)
dialog: It’s tonight, isn’t it, Charlie?
text: Charlie nods, ‘yes it is’.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: You have to remember all the good
dialog: that comes from the Purge. OK?
text: Charlie doesn’t respond. Mary changes the subject:
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: C’mon, tell me what you want for
dialog: breakfast, baby.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - CUL DE SAC - SANDIN HOUSE - MORNING
text: A sun-drenched upper class suburban CUL-DE-SAC -
text: comprised of about 8 VERY LARGE HOMES at its circular
text: dead-end. A FOREST looms behind the homes.
text: An almost too picture-perfect rich American neighborhood.
dialog: (NOTE: this is the future, and though the world seems
dialog: similar to our own in several ways, many technological
text: details vary - the cars are smaller, automated manless
text: LAWN-MOWERS trim grass, yards have WIND TURBINES, etc.)
text: As we focus on this opulent street, we notice that EVERY
text: HOME is conspicuously displaying a BOUQUET of BLUE
text: BAPTISIA FLOWERS by their front door - every home, except
dialog: ONE.
dialog: And that noticeably flower-free home happens to be the
text: largest home on the cul-de-sac - a three level majestic
text: beauty - 8000 SQUARE FEET. We also see that the TWO
text: WINDOWS flanking the FRONT DOOR of this LARGE HOME are
text: functioning, at the present moment, as HI-TECH 3D DIGITAL
text: SCREENS displaying a WELL-DRESSED ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
dialog: pleasantly saying:
scene_heading: DIGITAL WOMAN (ON WINDOW SCREENS)
dialog: - Good morning, Sandin Family.
dialog: Arcon encourages your
dialog: participation in the tradition of
text: displaying blue Baptisia flowers
dialog: commemorating the Purge.
dialog: (again)
dialog: Good morning, Sandin Family.
dialog: Arcon encourages your part-—
text: The Digital Woman repeats this message over and over when
text: the FRONT DOOR of this enormous HOME OPENS - and JAMES
text: (in a slick SUIT) exits. He holds a VASE of BLUE FLOWERS
text: - which he places on his FRONT PORCH. The continuous
text: MESSAGE suddenly STOPS and Digital Woman says:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
scene_heading: DIGITAL WOMAN (ON WINDOW SCREENS)
speaker_heading: (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you, Sandin Family. Good
dialog: day.
text: The DIGITAL SCREENS fade - and the WINDOWS return to
dialog: their original state - simply being windows. James
text: barely notes this as he calls back into his HOUSE:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Cc’mon, kids, we’re late.
text: A beat later, ZOEY and CHARLIE (both wearing CATHOLIC
text: SCHOOL UNIFORMS) emerge from the home. Zoey doesn’t look
text: at her Dad, her expression cold, moody. The trio moves
text: to their car - drawing the attention of a NEIGHBOR across
scene_heading: the WAY - YOUNG MR. CALI:
speaker_heading: MR. CALI
dialog: Mr. Sandin - I just tested the new
dialog: system - it’s working perfectly.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I only sell the best, Mr. Cali.
dialog: Same Arcon system I’m using. No
dialog: one’s bothering us tonight.
text: The neighbors share a smile as James and his children
text: continue to their car, getting inside. Behind them, we
text: spot MARY stepping under the THRESHOLD of her FRONT DOOR:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Bye guys, have a good day.
text: Mary waves to her family as they drive off. WE STAY
text: BEHIND, with Mary, when she looks up at the:
text: SKY-BOARDS - enormous 3D ‘billboards’ hovering in the sky
text: - an array of advertisements, government announcements,
text: news headlines. Times Square in the heavens. Colorful
text: digital images grabbing people’s attention from on high.
text: Most of the SKY-BOARDS are from ARCON and pertain to THE
text: PURGE - i.e. BE PROUD AND PURGE; THE PURGE SAVED AMERICA!
dialog: Mary considers the Sky-boards, when:
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Mrs. Sandin.
text: Mary's attention is broken by the fake-tanned, fake-
text: breasted MRS. FERRIN - approaching from her home (on the
text: RIGHT of the Sandins). Mrs. Ferrin is holding a TIN-
speaker_heading: FOILED PLATE:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: ll.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: MRS. FERRIN
dialog: ‘Morning. I come bearing gifts.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What could I have possibly done to
dialog: deserve a gift, Mrs. Ferrin?
speaker_heading: MRS. FERRIN
dialog: (playful)
dialog: Just being the perfect neighbor is
dialog: all. I have a new hobby. Baking.
dialog: But I made way too many cookies -
dialog: so I hope you’re hungry.
dialog: And before Mary could even say ‘thank you’:
speaker_heading: MR. HALVERSON (0.S.)
dialog: I hope you're hungry too because
dialog: those cookies are crazy good.
text: Mary and Mrs. Ferrin turn, finding THE HALVERSONS - the
text: ENORMOUS NEIGHBORS on the LEFT SIDE of the Sandins - the
scene_heading: FOOTBALL PLAYER-LIKE 18 YEAR OLD TWIN HALVERSON SONS and
text: the ROTUND HALVERSON PARENTS are getting in their car.
text: The Big Halversons smile one last time before driving
text: off. Mrs. Ferrin whispers to Mary:
speaker_heading: MRS. FERRIN
dialog: I know - more cookies is not what
dialog: the Halversons needed.
text: Mrs. Ferrin laughs - Mary politely joins in. Their
text: laughter finally fades and silence follows. Mrs. Ferrin
text: gestures toward the luxurious Sandin home:
speaker_heading: MRS. FERRIN (CONT'D)
dialog: I never did tell you - the
dialog: addition on your home looks
dialog: amazing. It’s inspired me and Mr.
dialog: Ferrin to do an addition also.
dialog: We’re consulting designers now.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Thank you. And I recommend our
dialog: guy - Jacobson - a genius.
text: They trade polite smiles - a hint of competition hangs in
text: the air between them. Mary breaks the moment:
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: So, any plans for the Purge?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: MRS. FERRIN
dialog: Nothing special. My husband and I
dialog: will lock ourselves in and enjoy
dialog: some quiet time. That’s all.
text: As Mrs. Ferrin starts walking away:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Thanks so much for the cookies,
dialog: Mrs. Ferrin.
speaker_heading: MRS. FERRIN
dialog: Enjoy ‘em with that gorgeous
dialog: family of yours. Have a good day,
text: Mrs. Sandin - and a safe night.
text: Mrs. Ferrin walks into her home. Mary watches her, then
text: enters her own huge house.
scene_heading: INT. SANDIN MANSION - MORNING - CONTINUOUS
text: As Mary steps in, carrying those cookies. We FOLLOW HER
text: THROUGH - noticing how enormous and beautiful her home is
text: - winding halls - multiple staircases - dozens of rooms.
scene_heading: INT. SANDIN HOME GYM - MORNING - CONTINUOUS
text: An elaborate home workout room. Mary ENTERS. Before
text: starting her run, she tries one of MRS. FERRIN’S COOKIES.
text: She immediately grimaces and spits the cookie into the
text: tissue, disgusted.
text: Surprised, she puts down the plate. Mary steps onto a
text: treadmill. She starts to run, when her eyes fall on a
text: nearby WALL CALENDAR - on today’s date:
scene_heading: TUESDAY, MARCH 21. THE ANNUAL PURGE.
text: An unsettled look rises on her face. Mary runs faster.
text: FADE TO BLACK.

scene_heading: INT. SANDIN KITCHEN - SAME - NIGHT FALL
text: The attractive Sandin Family sits at the kitchen table,
text: ready to eat dinner, all holding hands for some kind of
text: prayer/thanks. Victor, Charlie’s rabbit, sits on the
text: table next to him. They all have their eyes closed,
text: except Charlie, who’s secretly peering at everyone.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: - To the Martyrs who bring peace.
dialog: To the New Founding Fathers for
dialog: letting us Purge and cleanse our
dialog: souls. We are extremely grateful.
text: The family breaks their collective finger lock and James
text: begins a nightly dinner ritual:
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: - So, let’s hear about everyone’s
dialog: day? Zoey, you'll go first - but
dialog: Charlie - take the rabbit off the
dialog: table before we begin. Please.
text: Charlie gently puts his Rabbit on the floor as James
text: looks at his daughter, waiting for her to begin the
text: nightly ritual. Zoey glares harshly at her Dad:
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: I’m not doing this anymore. It’s
dialog: stupid.
text: James just stares at her, not accepting that.
speaker_heading: ZOEY (CONT’D)
dialog: Fine. Calc test. Piano. Normal
dialog: day. Who cares? It’s dumb.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I do. So how did practice go?
dialog: You ready for the recital?
text: Zoey just stares at him - teenage angst screaming ‘leave
text: me alone!’ Mary throws James a look - ‘stop bothering
text: her.’ James ignores Mary, saying to Zoey:
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: You're ready. You always are.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Just make sure your left hand
dialog: cooperates on the 3rd concerto.
text: Zoey doesn’t even look at her father - so mad now. Mary
text: eyes James - ‘stop’. James relents and says:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: If you guys don’t mind, I’11l do my
dialog: day next. I have some news.
dialog: (then, big grin)
dialog: I did it. All sales final and I’m
dialog: on top. My division sold the most
text: new Purge security systems.
text: James is beaming. Everyone reacts with joy - except Zoey
text: - who just rolls her eyes. Mary hugs her husband:
speaker_heading: MARY AND CHARLIE
dialog: Congratulations! So proud of you,
dialog: baby. Way to go, Dad.
text: James can’t stop smiling.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: The bonus was even bigger than
dialog: last year. That means a huge
dialog: vacation, the boat for your mom,
text: another addition on the house, and
dialog: anything else you guys want.
text: James is ecstatic - so proud of himself, when:
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What are you gonna do with a big
dialog: boat, Mom?
text: Mary goes to respond but her mouth yields nothing. She
text: seems unable to answer. Confused by her own silence, she
text: looks at James, who helps her:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Sail. She’1ll learn to sail,
dialog: Charlie. What else?
text: Mary nods, shrugs - ‘I guess I’1ll learn to sail’ - but
dialog: something about the whole question seems to have really
text: dumbfounded her.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: OK - enough about my bonus - back
dialog: to our days. Charlie, you’re up.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: We studied the history of the
dialog: Purge in History. And I wrote a
dialog: story in English about a man who
dialog: invents a spray that allows you to
text: see offensive smells. Like farts.
dialog: (then)
dialog: And Daddy’s breath.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: Mary and Zoey burst out laughing. Zoey almost spits some
text: food out. James is smiling - a good sport:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Very funny. And you ladies are
dialog: laughing a little too hard. I’1l
dialog: get you back for that one, Charlie-
dialog: boy. Beware.
text: Mary, Zoey, and Charlie are laughing even harder now.
text: Zoey actually high-fives her brother. James can’t help
text: but join in. In the b.g., we HEAR the PURGE COMMERCIAL
scene_heading: on the 0.S. TV/INTERNET PROJECTION:
speaker_heading: SOOTHING VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: ...Exercise your right to Purge
dialog: tonight. Arcon encourages your
dialog: participation.
text: Charlie takes almost subconscious note of the O.S.
text: commercial, as the Sandins’ laughter whittles. Zoey
text: assumes her pissy attitude again, when:

dialog: Zoey, before we hear about your
dialog: Mom’s day, I wanted to remind you
dialog: that we need to review your Arcon
dialog: University application essay.
text: Zoey shoots her father another nasty look, like she’s
text: going to bite his head off. Mary jumps in:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: James, for godsakes, we spoke
dialog: about this. She doesn’t always
dialog: have to be working.
dialog: (to Zoey)
dialog: Zoey, I'm giving you permission to
dialog: ignore him.
text: Zoey doesn’t respond, she’s ignoring everyone now, head
text: down, eating. James goes to say something but Mary’s
text: expression admonishes - ‘no more.’ He shuts his mouth.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Mommy’s turn.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: That's right. Mary, your day?
text: Before Mary could answer - DING DONG. The door bell.
text: James consults the wall-clock and his expression tightens
text: - an unsettled look emerges - which he tries to hide.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh. Look at the time. That must
dialog: be Mr. Kane. I’11 show him in and
dialog: then I guess we’ll begin the lock-
dialog: down protocol.
text: They all nod - clearly aware of what the ‘lock-down
text: protocol’ is. Mary’s face sags with sudden anxiety - not
text: unlike James’ - and she too tries to hide it. James
dialog: exits.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE SANDIN FRONT DOOR - JUST MOMENTS LATER
scene_heading: OPENING and REVEALING a SKINNY, GAUNT, COMPLETELY BALD 45
text: YEAR OLD MAN with a BRIGHT, POLITE SMILE. His name is
text: MR. KANE and he rang the bell. JAMES (who just opened
text: the door) greets him with an over-sized grin:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Mr. Kane.
speaker_heading: MR. KANE
dialog: Mr. Sandin. Sorry I was almost
dialog: late - the traffic - everyone
text: rushing to get off the streets
text: before the Purge begins.
dialog: (then)
dialog: What a beautiful home, sir.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Thank you. Come in. Let me bring
dialog: you downstairs. You can make
dialog: yourself comfortable while I take
dialog: care of some Purge preparation and
dialog: then I’1l join you afterward.
text: James escorts Mr. Kane INSIDE and then down STAIRS, into:
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS - SAME
text: As Mr. Kane and James walk across the LARGE BASEMENT off
text: which SEVERAL ROOMS debouch. James and Mr. Kane continue
text: to smile - both men being overly polite. They reach one
text: of the BASEMENT DOORS:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: We'll do our business here.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: James opens the DOOR revealing a COZY ROOM within.
text: Strangely, the FLOOR of the ROOM is covered with PLASTIC
text: TARP. There is a LONE CHAIR in the middle of the room
text: atop this plastic. An unusual ominous tableau.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: You can take a seat right there.
dialog: I hope it’s comfortable.
text: Mr. Kane enters and sits on the lone chair.
speaker_heading: MR. KANE
dialog: It’s very comfortable.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Great. See you shortly, Mr. Kane.
text: Mr. Kane smiles again. James smiles back. The ever-—
text: present awkwardness between them reaching a crescendo.
text: James closes the door, shutting Mr. Kane inside.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SANDIN DEN/SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT FALL
text: A ROOM with a BANK OF 12 HI-TECH COMPUTER SCREENS - SET
text: UP LIKE SECURITY MONITORS ON A WALL. They are not on.
text: MARY, ZOEY AND CHARLIE are ALL INSIDE THIS ROOM now.
text: Charlie is holding Victor. Zoey is intently looking at
text: her cell phone. Mary is scrutinizing Zoey:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: - Zoey, I know you’re still upset
dialog: about Henry, baby. You know you
dialog: can talk to me any time, right?
text: Zoey looks up at her Mother - as if she’s going to say
text: something when JAMES ENTERS. Zoey quickly shuts down as
text: James announces with a slight measure of dread that he
text: still attempts to hide:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Mr. Kane is situated. And we're
text: only minutes away.
dialog: (then)
dialog: OK. Let’s get ready for the Purge.
text: James walks to the BANK OF MONITORS - hits a NEARBY
text: SWITCH - all the MONITORS POP ON. They are clearly
text: SECURITY MONITORS - each DISPLAYING a DIFFERENT ANGLE of
text: the EXTERIOR of the SANDIN HOME - the immense BACKYARD,
text: the POOL, the tall FENCE, and the LARGE FOREST beyond.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Several monitors DISPLAY ANGLES of the FRONT YARD and
text: pieces of the STREET AND HOUSES across the CUL-DE-SAC.
text: James spots MOVEMENT on ONE MONITOR:
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, Mr. Sabian is going hunting.
text: Mary, Charlie, and Zoey consult the MONITORS, seeing what
dialog: James is referring to:
text: ON MONITOR - where we see a MAN EXITING a HOME ACROSS THE
text: WAY. He’s DRESSED in FULL CAMOUFLAGE - like a SOLDIER
text: about to go to BATTLE. He’s carrying GUNS and KNIVES.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: (seeing something
dialog: else outside)
dialog: And the Johnsons are having a
dialog: Purge Party.
text: Zoey, Mary, and Charlie consult ANOTHER COMPUTER SECURITY
text: SCREEN which DISPLAYS an ANGLE of the ‘JOHNSON HOME’ DOWN
dialog: THE STREET and there we SEE:
text: 12 MEN AND WOMEN, all dressed formally in SUITS and
text: DRESSES (their ‘Sunday best’) walking into this home.
text: FOUR of the SUITED-MEN are carrying an old-fashioned,
text: full-sized, functional GUILLOTINE.
text: The Sandins eye the Guillotine. Not surprised by it.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: OK. Let’s get on with it.
text: James OPENS (with a key) a NEARBY CABINET - REVEALING A
text: HALF DOZEN GUNS. He removes ONE GUN and pockets it.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: As always. Just a precaution.
text: He LOCKS the CABINET when he SPOTS something outside:
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr. Cali’s started his lock-down
dialog: with the system I sold him.
dialog: (beaming with pride)
dialog: That’s just one of the many that
dialog: led to this year’s bonus.
text: They all look out the window seeing:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: ANOTHER HOUSE ACROSS THE CUL-DE-SAC where SOLID STEEL
text: BARRICADES ELECTRONICALLY EMERGE from SLOTS in front of
text: EVERY WINDOW AND DOOR of THIS HOME - these fortifying
text: BULWARKS SLOWLY LOWER OVER every entrance and exit point,
dialog: sealing shut this home with these gates of steel. (NOTE:
text: there are SMALL OBSERVATION HOLES CUT INTO EACH
scene_heading: PROTECTIVE BARRICADE - covered with bullet-proof GLASS.)
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: OK. lLet’s lock down now.
text: James HITS a RED BUTTON on the NEARBY WALL and, suddenly,
text: the SAME THING HAPPENS TO THE SANDIN HOME:
text: STEEL GATES electronically emerge from SLOTS in front of
text: EVERY WINDOW AND DOOR of the HOME - CLOSING out all
text: MOONLIGHT as they COVER EACH EXIT/ENTRANCE.
text: The WHIRR of THE CLOSING BARRICADES BELLOWS ominously.
scene_heading: EXT. SANDIN MANSION - SAME
text: As we WATCH THOSE STEEL BULWARKS EMERGING AND CLOSING
text: OVER EVERY WINDOW and DOOR of the large Sandin home.
scene_heading: INT. SANDIN MANSION - DEN - SAME
text: As a STEEL BARRICADE closes over the WINDOW of the DEN.
text: The family watches it shut - sealing them in. Securing
text: the home for some unknown reason. Bringing in darkness.
text: Mary turns on the LIGHT. James looks at the MONITORS -
text: at all the OTHER HOMES on the CUL-DE-SAC - and now we see
text: ELECTRONIC SECURITY BARRICADES SECURING THESE HOMES also.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: The golden rule - never, under any
dialog: circumstance, are the security
text: barricades to be opened.
text: They all nod, rolling their eyes, they know that.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: Put on the TV, Charlie-boy. We’re
text: seconds away.
text: Charlie raises a remote and turns on a TV/INTERNET where
text: we CATCH the END of the clearly over-played PURGE

scene_heading: SOOTHING VOICE OVER
dialog: ...-Arcon encourages your

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The COMMERCIAL ENDS and A BLUE SCREEN COMES ON T.V.,

text: The FOLLOWING WORDS SCROLL across the BLUE SCREEN as an
text: O.S. ANNOUNCER speaks them simultaneously:
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (0.S.)
dialog: This is your Emergency Broadcast
dialog: System announcing the commencement
dialog: of The Annual Purge, sanctioned by
dialog: the U.S. Arcon Government in the
dialog: Year Orange 11-7 O.N. Commencing
dialog: at the siren, any and all crime,
dialog: up to, and including, Murder, will
dialog: be legal for 12 continuous hours.
text: Police, fire, and hospital aide
dialog: will be unavailable until Thursday
dialog: morning, March 22, at 7 AM, when
text: The Purge concludes.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The following weapons cannot be
dialog: used during the Purge: weapons of
dialog: mass destruction, fragment-
dialog: producing explosives higher than a
dialog: hazard class HC/D 1.4 and viral
text: contagion projectiles.
dialog: Recommended weapons: A.R. rifles
text: and handguns of caliber 6.2 and

dialog: officials of ranking 5.1 and
dialog: higher have been granted immunity
dialog: from the Purge and shall not be
dialog: harmed. Non-compliance with any
dialog: of the aforementioned rules will
dialog: result in death by hanging.
text: End of statement. Silence. The Sandins stare at the TV.
text: The SCREEN then CUTS to a SUITED WOMAN at a PODIUM.
speaker_heading: SENATOR ALBANS
dialog: Good evening, I am Senator Nina
dialog: Albans. This year, as we
dialog: celebrate the tenth anniversary of
dialog: The Purge, let us pay tribute to
dialog: the woman who started it all -
dialog: world-renowned psychiatrist Dr.
dialog: Emma Brandiss.
text: THE BROADCAST CUTS to FOOTAGE of PSYCHOLOGIST DR. EMMA
text: BRANDISS in an INTERVIEW from years ago. This is
scene_heading: INTERCUT with CONCUSSIVE FOOTAGE OF VIOLENCE; PRISONERS
text: RIOTING, WAR, MURDER, etcetera.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 21.
dialog: (2)
speaker_heading: EMMA BRANDISS
dialog: - We have been denying the fact
dialog: that we are inherently a violent
dialog: species. Modern civilization has
text: attempted to conceal man’s beastly
dialog: nature through psychiatry,
dialog: religion, government - these
dialog: methods have failed. The idea we
dialog: explored was that perhaps the
dialog: denial of our true selves is the
dialog: problem - the ‘repression of
dialog: aggression’ creating psychopathic
dialog: personalities. We propose a
dialog: societal release of this
dialog: aggressiveness for one lawful
dialog: evening - a punishment-free outlet
dialog: to not only contain the violence
dialog: to a single night, but to cleanse,
dialog: or Purge, our souls of it - making
dialog: us psychologically stable and less
dialog: likely to exhibit aberrant
dialog: behavior on a daily basis.
text: THE BROADCAST CUTS BACK TO SENATOR ALBANS on the PODIUM:
speaker_heading: SENATOR ALBANS
dialog: And during our nation’s darkest
dialog: hour, Arcon had the courage to
dialog: test Dr. Brandiss’ theory, and the
dialog: results were undeniable. The
dialog: Purge worked.
text: SHOTS of HAPPY CITIZENS walking in and out of STORE
text: FRONTS —- CARRYING BAGS, BUYING CARS, CLOTHING, etcetera.
scene_heading: BACK TO SENATOR ALBANS:
speaker_heading: SENATOR ALBANS (CONT’D)
dialog: And here we are over a decade
dialog: later. ‘Release The Beast’ is the
text: nation’s rallying cry as more and
text: more citizens are waiting until
dialog: Purge Night to engage in violent
dialog: activity, creating a virtually
dialog: crime-free nation.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And to those whose lives are
dialog: sacrificed tonight, both
text: voluntarily and involuntarily, it
dialog: is an honor to die during the
dialog: Purge - you are our modern day

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
text: The screen CUTS TO BLUE and suddenly WAAAAAAA! A
text: SCREECHING SIREN wails from the TV and BLARES OUTSIDE
text: ALSO - apparently coming from SPEAKERS on the STREET.
text: The Sandins stand in a quiet tableau listening to it.
text: The siren stops. Mary looks more unsettled. Zoey
text: fidgets, still assuming her attitude. Charlie stares at
text: everyone. James sees his family’s disquieted faces:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I know it’s a difficult evening,
dialog: guys, but remember - bad things
dialog: happen in poor areas because they
dialog: can’t afford protection. We’ll be
dialog: fine. No worries.
text: No one responds. James goes on:
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: OK. Charlie, you'll stay in your
dialog: room tonight. You’re still too
text: young to understand the Purge.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That's OK. Good night.
text: Charlie happily walks out. Zoey steps forward:
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: I’m gonna go be miserable in my
dialog: room. See you in the morning.
text: Zoey exits. Mary and James ignore her comment -—
text: something else is clearly on their minds:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Mr. Kane’s last meal, Mar?
speaker_heading: MARY
text: In the oven.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You sure you don’t want to -
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: - No, hun. I’m not ready yet.
dialog: Maybe next year.

text: considering what’s about to happen.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I’m gonna go get this done.
text: Mary goes to say something but no words come. James
text: exits. Mary consults the MONITORS, seeing A MUTT
text: crossing the street - otherwise the cul-de-sac is quiet.
text: Every home is locked down. Every home’s display of
text: flowers blooming blue under crepuscular light.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ZOEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: As Zoey enters her room, SLAMMING the DOOR SHUT! So
text: frustrated with her Dad. She sits on the bed, stewing,
dialog: when she SEES:
text: HER CLOSET DOOR OPENING. At first she’s startled, but
text: fear quickly turns to relief and excitement when brooding
text: boyfriend HENRY emerges from within. Zoey’s on her feet:
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: - What are you doing here, baby?
dialog: You shouldn't be out during the
dialog: Purge - you could get hurt.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: My Dad went hunting - my Mom went
dialog: to a Purgation Event. I snuck in
dialog: when you were eating dinner.
dialog: Happy to see me?
speaker_heading: ZOEY

scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT ROOM - NIGHT
text: SKINNY, PALE MR. KANE sits on the CHAIR in the center of

speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: As requested - spaghetti and
dialog: meatballs, Mr. Kane.
speaker_heading: MR. KANE
dialog: It smells wonderful, Mr. Sandin.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MARY AND JAMES’ BEDROOM - NIGHT - SAME
text: MARY enters, sipping a Martini. She’s fighting that
text: unsettled feeling, clearly unsure of what to do with
text: herself. She sits on her bed - opens a YACHT MAGAZINE
text: and finds the luxurious BOAT she ear-marked earlier. But
text: something clearly bothers her about it now.
text: Mary drops the magazine. Her eyes falling on the TV.
text: She CLICKS on the PROJECTION with a REMOTE. We REVERSE
text: TO SEE WHAT she’s WATCHING:
text: ON TV/INTERNET - these WORDS on the screen - LIVE FEED -
text: THE PURGE - PARK AVE., NEW YORK. Above the words, a
scene_heading: SECURITY CAM-LIKE VIEW of the MANHATTAN STREET comprised
scene_heading: of EXPENSIVE HIGH-RISES. All SKYSCRAPER WINDOWS
text: BARRICADED WITH STEEL. NO ONE is outside. BAPTISIA
text: FLOWERS line the sidewalk - commemorating the holiday.
text: Mary raises the REMOTE, CHANGING the site/channel to:
scene_heading: ON TV/INTERNET: LIVE FEED - THE PURGE - OIL CITY, PENN.
text: Above these words, a HIGH ANGLE SECURITY CAM-LIKE VIEW of
text: a TRAILER PARK - all TRAILER HOME WINDOWS protected by
text: WOOD BOARDS - nothing else. All trailers display
text: FLOWERS. This Trailer Park is quiet until we see A BURST
text: of MOVEMENT as a MAN RUNS into CAM VIEW.
text: This Man is MISSING both his ARMS - chopped off just
text: moments ago - as he’s bleeding and retreating in a mad
text: desperate dash. The Armless Man runs out of CAM VIEW.
text: The Park is quiet again until WHOOSH! A half dozen MEN
text: on HORSEBACK come thundering through.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: They're garmented in unusual CHROME SUITS and carrying
text: STRANGE GUNS and GLOWING SWORDS. ONE HORSE pulls a

text: MARY watches this macabre scene, disturbed. She sips her
text: drink, then TYPES something on her REMOTE KEYBOARD -
scene_heading: searching for a specific web-site - THE-RESISTANCE.ORG
text: (NOTE: the web-site of Purge Detractor Carmelo Johns whom
text: we saw on TV earlier). As she finishes typing, she HEARS
text: an 0.S. BEEPING. She looks up at the PROJECTION, seeing:
speaker_heading: WARNING
scene_heading: YOU ARE ABOUT TO ENTER THE-RESISTANCE.ORG. THIS WEB-SITE
text: Is NOT SANCTIONED BY ARCON. WOULD YOU LIKE TO PROCEED?

speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You need to relax, girl -
dialog: everything’s going to be alright.

text: withdrawing a SMALL BOTTLE. He removes the LID -
text: revealing a dozen PHOSPHORESCENT GLOWING PILLS.
speaker_heading: HENRY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: May I ask how much longer you
dialog: have, Mr. Kane?
speaker_heading: MR. KANE
dialog: Under two months. The cancer has
text: spread all over. The pain is
dialog: unbearable. I thank you for this.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Would you like to make a statement
dialog: for Arcon’s Library of Martyrs?
text: James finds a SMALL VIDEO RECORDER-LIKE DEVICE. Hits
speaker_heading: RECORD as:
speaker_heading: MR. KANE
dialog: I'd like to say that I hope the

text: She swigs her Martini, finishing it. She eyes the empty
text: glass, contemplating getting another drink, when:
text: A subtle 0.S. NOISE gets her attention.
text: It’S LAUGHTER. A CREEPY BURST of GIGGLING - FROM
text: OUTSIDE. Mary tenses, there’s something disconcerting
text: about it. She gingerly moves to the WINDOW - LOOKING out
text: the OBSERVATION SLOT, seeing:
text: A HINT OF MOVEMENT in the FOREST BEHIND HER BACKYARD
text: FENCE. A FLASH OF WHITE that disappears. Mary, alerted,
text: stares out - not seeing anything now - when suddenly:
text: AHHHHHH! An O.S. mindless SCREAM of fear ERUPTS from
text: INSIDE her home. Mary nearly jumps out of her skin when
text: the SCREAM is followed by BANG! The concussive SOUND of
text: an O.S. GUNSHOT. Mary knows what it is. She freezes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ZOEY'S ROOM —- NIGHT - SAME

dialog: can’t keep my eyes open. It must
dialog: be the pills. It must be -
text: - BAM! Another GUNSHOT from the BASEMENT - a bit muted
text: in this part of the house. As she fades into sleep:
speaker_heading: ZOEY (CONT'D)
dialog: - What was that?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Nothing. Just sleep, girl. Rest.
dialog: Everything’s gonna be alright very
dialog: soon.
dialog: And there’s something strange about the way Henry says

text: James locks the door before we see any more. He places
text: the key under the rug.
text: James stands there, not moving, face red.
text: James begins to cry, releasing emotion, very shaken by
text: his ‘Purge’. After a beat of crying, James takes a deep
text: breath - as if he’s trying to convince himself that the
dialog: ‘Purging’ he just did was a ‘good, cleansing act’.
text: After several breaths, he assumes his confident facade
text: again. He walks up the STAIRS and ENTERS:
scene_heading: INT. SANDIN FIRST FLOOR FOYER - CONTINUOUS
text: As James steps into the FOYER, he immediately SEES THAT:
text: ALL THE WINDOWS in his FOYER are now acting as DIGITAL
text: MONITORS (just as the front windows did in the morning),
text: DISPLAYING that same PLEASANT WOMAN from earlier:
speaker_heading: PLEASANT WOMAN (ON DIGITAL
speaker_heading: WINDOWS )
dialog: Thank you for Purging, James
dialog: Sandin. Arcon will not forget
dialog: your brave participation in this
dialog: important tradition.
text: The Digital Woman repeats the message over and over, and
text: as James continues walking we see that the PLEASANT WOMAN
text: APPEARS on EVERY WINDOW DISPLAY of his home. James
text: finally stops, turns to one of the WINDOW SCREENS and
text: NODS - acknowledging the message. The WOMAN vanishes -
text: and the windows appear just as windows once again.
text: James continues onward, down the SECOND FLOOR HALL now.
text: He passes the SECURITY ROOM, where he sees:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: MARY - in front of the SECURITY MONITORS now. No longer

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You're a brave man, hun. You've
dialog: done your duty. You OK?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I know how necessary it is - I
dialog: just remind myself what it was
dialog: like before Arcon and the Purge -
dialog: but it’s still so damn hard.

speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I don’t see anything. Maybe it

speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Damnit. I’11 go wash it off.

scene_heading: INT. CHARLIE’S SECRET LAIR - SAME
text: CHARLIE’S in his hideaway - wearing layers of clothing
text: and donning those strange GLASSES/GOGGLES.
text: He’s navigating Victor the Rabbit through his quiet home -
scene_heading: through the LONG PRISTINE EMPTY HALLS - SEEING everything
speaker_heading: through VICTOR’S EYES.
text: And the Rabbit’s not slowing, it’s moving steadfast, to a
dialog: specific destination.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MARY AND JAMES’ BATHROOM - NIGHT - SAME
text: Water fills the bath. JAMES, naked, steps in. Mary,
text: dressed, sits on the tub, washing her husband’s back,

text: They sit in silence, as the blood runs down James’ body
text: and into the tub’s drain.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CHARLIE’S SECRET LAIR - SAME

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The RABBIT’S POV as it APPROACHES and STOPS at the CLOSED
text: BASEMENT DOOR - behind which is MR. KANE.
text: CHARLIE continues staring at the MONITOR (inside those
text: glasses) when he spots BLOOD dripping UNDER the BASEMENT
text: DOOR from within.
text: CHARLIE eyes the blood for a very long beat.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SANDIN BASEMENT - SAME
text: Where the RABBIT sits unmoving behind the basement door.
text: The BLOOD that runs under the door stains Victor’s fur.
text: We HEAR FOOTSTEPS O.S. as CHARLIE suddenly appears at the
text: base of the STAIRS behind Victor, out of breath. He runs
text: up beside his Rabbit - joining it behind that DOOR. He
text: stares down at the red puddle pooling on the floor.
text: Charlie clearly had to see the blood in person.
text: Charlie lifts the floor mat - finds the KEY. He pauses,
text: terrified. He finally musters up the gumption to:
text: UNLOCK AND OPEN THAT DOOR.
text: Charlie pauses - staring into the room - at the 0.S. dead
text: Mr. Kane. We don’t see what Charlie sees. But we see
text: the color drain from his soft face.
text: Charlie finally closes the door. He stands there next to
text: his Rabbit, horrified by what he’s seen.
text: Young Charlie is unable to move.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ZOEY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Zoey lies peacefully asleep on the bed, in her drug-

text: staring at ZOEY'S WALL of TROPHIES and PLAQUES.
text: Henry pulls himself away from the wall, reaches into the

text: He unzips it and withdraws a GUN.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 32.
scene_heading: INT. SANDIN MANSION - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Charlie is walking through the home now, devastated from
text: viewing MR. KANE’S CORPSE. His Rabbit is not with him.
text: He continues on, when he HEARS an O.S. protracted SOUND.
text: He takes note. Walking onward - through the barricaded
text: home - when he HEARS THAT SOUND AGAIN.
text: It’s a SCREAM. A MAN’S SCREAM. From OUTSIDE. Charlie
text: WALKS to a WINDOW - peers out the OBSERVATION SLOT.
scene_heading: CHARLIE’S POV OF THE STREET:
text: Charlie peers around the neighborhood, when he SPOTS:
text: A DISTANT FIGURE - RUNNING toward the CUL-DE-SAC. The
text: DISTANT FIGURE IS STUMBLING and YELLING in fear/pain.
text: Charlie stares at this RUNNING FIGURE. As ‘it’ draws
text: CLOSER, we can see that it is a TALL MAN - with streaks
text: of FRESH BLOOD striating his entire body. He’s running
text: forward but looking back. He’s clearly being HUNTED.
text: Charlie looks down the street - DOESN’T SEE THE PURSUERS.
text: HOLD ON CHARLIE’S FACE for a long beat - twisted in
text: concern and empathy as he watches this desperate, bloody
text: man stumbling down the CUL-DE-SAC.
text: SUDDENLY: Charlie SPINS AND SPRINTS across his HOME. WE
text: FOLLOW HIM DOWN A HALL. Up a flight of STAIRS. Through
text: the KITCHEN. Down another HALL. And into THE
scene_heading: DEN/SECURITY ROOM.
text: He peers at the SECURITY MONITORS - sees that BLOODY MAN
text: still struggling down the street.
text: Charlie doesn’t hesitate - WHAM! HE HITS THE RED
text: SECURITY BARRICADE BUTTON ON THE WALL.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT - SAME
text: James is out of the tub - clean now. Mary is helping him

scene_heading: INT. SANDIN MANSION FRONT FOYER - NIGHT - SAME
text: A RUSH OF MOVEMENT as CHARLIE RUNS BACK DOWN the STAIRS -
text: to the FIRST FLOOR. He screeches to a halt by the FRONT
scene_heading: DOOR. He UNLOCKS THE DOOR - WHIPS IT OPEN - SECURITY
text: GATE in front of it almost OPEN and EXPOSING THE OUTSIDE.
text: Charlie sees the BLOODY RUNNING STRANGER - 20 yards away.
text: Up close, the MAN is tall, with tattered blood-soaked
text: clothes. Beard dirty, hair matted - like a Homeless Man.
text: He’s between 30-35 - his torn shirt reveals a hideously
text: SCARRED BODY - including one scar that jack-knifes across
text: his face, ending at his right eye - which is just a dark
text: hole where his eye used to reside.
text: He is also missing part of his scalp - hair and skin cut
text: from his head, exposing bloody subcutaneous tissue.
text: Unlike his other scars, this scalp wound is fresh.
text: There’s also a LONG RUSTY SERRATED KNIFE sticking out of
text: the Stranger’s pocket conspicuously.
text: Charlie, undaunted by the Man’s grisly appearance, YELLS:
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hey - hey - come here!
text: BLOODY STRANGER spots CHARLIE - a beacon. He PIVOTS
text: TOWARD THE SANDIN HOME. Climbing the IRON GATE that
text: SURROUNDS the PROPERTY.
text: Charlie looks - but still can’t see the MAN’S ATTACKERS.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DEN - SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT - SAME
text: As James (dressed now) ENTERS in a BURST. HE SLAMS HIS
text: HAND against the RED SECURITY BUTTON and suddenly WHIRR -
text: the SOUND of the STEEL BULWARKS CLOSING RISES AGAIN.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SANDIN MANSION - FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT - SAME
text: Charlie stands under the threshold of the front door.
text: The Bloody Stranger just TEN FEET AWAY NOW.
text: The SECURITY DOOR between them is NOW CLOSING. IN TWO

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Come on!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Security door CLOSING. Almost closed. Just a foot left.
text: The Stranger reaches the door - Charlie grabs his hand
text: and PULLS HIM THROUGH the ever-closing SLOT and INTO THE
text: HOME just as THE SECURITY BARRICADE SHUTS behind him.
text: The Stranger’s INSIDE. The house is locked-down again.
text: The Stranger, out of breath, stares down at little
text: Charlie with his one eye - an eye dancing with surprise
dialog: and an ever-present fierce intensity, when:
speaker_heading: JAMES (0.S.)
text: WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?
text: Charlie and Bloody Stranger turn to see JAMES AND MARY
text: RUNNING down the CIRCULAR STAIRCASE, into the LARGE FRONT
text: ENTRANCE FOYER, SPOTTING Bloody Stranger standing
text: prominently, next to Charlie.
text: Their faces fall in shock as they scrutinize this
text: sinister-looking Man - his one eye - his throng of scars -
text: his raw scalp wound - the BLOOD that veils his body and
text: the LARGE KNIFE in his pocket.
text: Bloody Stranger eyes James - and James’ GUN - wedged in
text: James’ front pant’s pocket. Tension and fear immediately
text: rise in the air like a dense cloud.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Charlie - come over here.
text: Charlie doesn’t move.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: What did you do, Charlie? Do you
dialog: know this man?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No. He needed help.
text: James stares at Charlie, flabbergasted. The gruesome
text: Stranger is standing very still - breathing hard -
text: staring at everyone with that uncompromising intensity.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You know the rule, Charlie - never
text: open the security doors.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: He would’ve died.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: That’s not our business, Charlie.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Were you being hunted, sir?
text: The Stranger just stares at Mary - his heavy panting
text: breaths betray his otherwise intransigent silence.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: That’s not our business either.
dialog: (then, to STRANGER)
dialog: Sir, my son made a child’s
dialog: mistake. You can’t stay here.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Why? He’s hurt.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: But we don’t know how he got hurt.
dialog: Maybe he isn’t being hunted -
dialog: maybe he’s doing the hunting.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: He was running from someone. I
dialog: saw him. He needs help. He -
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: - Charlie, shut up now, son.
text: James admonishes Charlie with a look, then turns back to
text: the Stranger who holds James’ eye. Tension building
text: rapidly. Mary breaks the moment - considering the
text: Stranger’s tattered clothes, long beard and dirty hair.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Are you homeless, sir?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Stop asking him questions, Mar.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I’1l ask whatever I want, James. -
dialog: Are you homeless, sir?
text: The Stranger keeps staring - yielding no words - yet.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (to Stranger)
dialog: You must leave now, sir.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: He’1l die out there!
speaker_heading: JAMES
text: GO TO YOUR ROOM, CHARLIE. NOW!
dialog: Then:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No.
text: James glaring at his son - Charlie staring back
text: defiantly. The Bloody Stranger surveilling the Sandins
dialog: and all the nearby hallways as:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: OK, enough. Sir, I am sorry if
dialog: you’re being hunted but that’s
dialog: what happens tonight. I’m just
dialog: trying to protect my family.
dialog: Mary, open the damn door.
text: The Stranger looks at Mary - he then speaks for the first
text: time - a low, raspy grunt:
scene_heading: BLOODY STRANGER
dialog: Don’t open the door.
dialog: (looks back at James)
dialog: I am not going back out there.
text: That hangs there ominously - sending a chill up Mary's
text: and James’ respective spines. They share a terrified
text: look, when suddenly - a NEW O0.S. VOICE, coming from
scene_heading: UPSTAIRS, ENTERS the MIX:
speaker_heading: HENRY (0.S.)
dialog: Mr. Sandin.
text: HENRY’S VOICE breaks the moment. Everyone’s baffled. No
text: one more than James - but he doesn’t take his eyes off
dialog: The Stranger.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: What? Is that Henry? Why -
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (re: the Stranger)
dialog: - Just lock him in the basement,
dialog: Dad, let him stay.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Charlie, please!
dialog: (then)
dialog: Why is Henry here, Mary?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I don’t fucking know!
scene_heading: INTERRUPTING AGAIN:
speaker_heading: HENRY (0.S.)
dialog: - Mr Sandin, we need to talk.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Henry, this is not the time!
text: James and The Stranger are still locked on each other but
text: Henry's O.S. VOICE has James very distracted now.
text: Mary steps BACK - toward the CIRCULAR STAIRCASE BEHIND
text: THEM. And there, at the TOP of the STAIRS, she sees:
text: HENRY. Standing very very still.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I don’t understand - where is my
dialog: daughter, Henry? Why are you
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: HENRY
text: Zoey’s in her room. She’s fine.
dialog: I’m here to talk with Mr. Sandin.
text: HENRY BEGINS DESCENDING the STAIRS.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: HENRY! Don’t come down here!
text: Henry just glares at Mary with intense eyes. He
text: continues to creep slowly down the circular stairs.
text: James is still staring at the Stranger - who is now
text: almost imperceptibly MOVING TOWARDS CHARLIE - to grab the
text: boy as a hostage, perhaps. James is losing his cool:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: SIR - DO NOT MOVE! Henry, go back
dialog: upstairs! Jesus!
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I can’t allow you to treat Zoey
dialog: the way you do, Mr. Sandin.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (re: The Stranger)
dialog: Dad, you have to let him stay!
text: The Stranger and James are still locked on each other -
text: and The Stranger’s still slowly stepping toward Charlie.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: STOP FUCKING MOVING!
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You’re ruining her life, Mr.
dialog: Sandin. Don’t worry - you'll be
dialog: made a Martyr.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I’m exercising my right to Purge.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (5)
text: Suddenly, Henry PULLS HIS GUN FROM HIS WAISTBAND. JAMES -—
text: who’s eyes are still on BLOODY STRANGER doesn’t see this -
text: but Mary does. Time slows to a nightmarish crawl as:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: OH MY GOD! JAMES! JAMES!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ZOEY’S BEDROOM - SAME
text: As a sleeping Zoey is WOKEN up by her MOTHER'S SCREAMS:
speaker_heading: MARY (0.S.)
text: JAMES! LOOK! LOOK!
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. SANDIN FRONT HALL - SAME
text: As Mary continues to SCREAM:
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: HENRY'S GOT A GUN! A GUN!
text: Everything suddenly happens fast - JAMES SPINS, turning
text: his back on the Stranger for the first time. He sees:
text: HENRY - STAIRS - raising that GUN. Mary is still
text: SCREAMING when Henry PULLS THE TRIGGER and FIRES.
text: James DROPS - DRAWING his own GUN - he instinctively
text: FIRES back at HENRY - who’s still SHOOTING at JAMES.
text: Both Men fire awkwardly, unpracticed badly-aimed shooting
text: as Henry and James exchange SHOTS. Both missing.
text: As they're firing at each other, ZOEY appears at the TOP
text: of the STAIRS behind Henry. She’s shocked out of her
text: stupor when she sees what’s happening. She SCREAMS!
text: Then, BAM! One of James’ SHOTS HITS HENRY - he stumbles
text: backwards - BLEEDING, nearly falling into the screaming
text: Zoey. She grabs HENRY, PULLING him up - they stumble
text: BACK DOWN THE HALL, DISAPPEARING. AT THE SAME TIME:
text: JAMES is FLAILING on the FOYER FLOOR - scared, confused.
text: MARY moves frantically to her HUSBAND - YELLING:
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: ARE YOU HIT - ARE YOU SHOT?
dialog: All James can say is:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JAMES
text: WHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED?
scene_heading: INT. ZOEY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT - SAME
text: WHAM! As Zoey and Henry come crashing into her bedroom.
text: They both drop to the floor. JZoey’s hysterical. Henry's
text: spitting up blood, trying to talk:
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I love you... I want to make you
dialog: happy... I want us to be free...
text: Zoey SCREAMS - a WAIL from the depths of her soul. BACK
dialog: TO:
scene_heading: INT. SANDIN MANSION - FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT - SAME
text: Mary is still frantically checking James for wounds.
text: James is breathing heavy, scared, devastated, freaked:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You're not hit. You’re OK.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I shot back. I couldn’t help it!
dialog: TELL ME I DIDN’T HIT ZOEY!
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I saw her run off. I think she’s
dialog: OK. But I don’t know! I don’t
dialog: know about either one of them!
text: Mary's words hang there with pure fear. James doesn’t
text: respond. Husband and wife suddenly grow quiet as what
text: just happened settles in - they’re both beyond words.
text: Mary begins trembling - James is breathing heavy. Then:
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (0.S.)
dialog: Mom.
text: That snaps the Sandin parents out of their mutual fugue -
text: both turn toward CHARLIE’S VOICE - finding the BOY in the
scene_heading: CORNER of the FOYER - behind FURNITURE:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Charlie. Come here. Are you OK?
text: Charlie runs to his mom. She embraces him. Tight.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What just happened, Mom? What was
dialog: Henry doing?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Mary just shakes her head - unable to answer that.
text: James is suddenly on his feet - pacing, babbling between
text: heavy, panting breaths:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: - Jesus Christ! This can’t be
dialog: happening! What was Henry thin-
text: James stops, noticing something that breaks his meltdown:
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: - Where is he? Where the hell is
dialog: that Man, Charlie?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I don’t know.
text: Mary and James’ faces fall with alarm. Mary’s looking
text: around - there’s no sign of the Bloody Stranger anywhere.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Fuck, Charlie! Who knows what
dialog: this Man’s capable of! He could
dialog: be anywhere! What are -
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: - Enough! That’s not helping.
dialog: (then)
dialog: We can’t stay out here, James.
dialog: It’s not safe.
text: They all hold a look of dismay and fear. Too much
text: happening at once. James takes a breath, trying to gain
text: some semblance of rationale amidst the hysteria:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You’re right. We need to move.
scene_heading: EXT. SANDIN MANSION - NIGHT - SAME
text: The Sandin home seems very quiet from the outside. The
text: surrounding cul-de-sac is calm, dark. But the sky above
text: is alight with SKY-BOARDS - ONE BOARD is larger than the
text: others and scrolling like a NEWS-TICKER:
scene_heading: EARLY SATELLITE ESTIMATES: MOST PURGE PARTICIPANTS -
text: DALLAS AND TAMPA! WHICH CITY WILL REAP RICH REWARDS FROM
text: ARCON? IT'S VERY CLOSE! KEEP PURGING!
text: The Sky-board continues scrolling when something else
dialog: grabs our attention:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
scene_heading: MOVEMENT on the CUL-DE-SAC. It’s SEVERAL MEN - RUNNING
text: onto the circular street. But we don’t see them clearly
text: as they’re moving in a predatory fashion - FAST, QUIET,
text: and HIDING in SHADOWS.
text: And as they creep further into the cul-de-sac, we quickly
dialog: realize something -
text: - These SHADOWY FIGURES are ALL MOVING RIGHT TOWARD the
scene_heading: SANDIN MANSION.
text: And they are beginning to surround it.
scene_heading: INT. SANDIN PLAY ROOM - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER
text: WHAM! The DOOR SWINGS OPEN and JAMES, MARY AND CHARLIE
text: enter a ROOM replete with a POOL TABLE, PINBALL MACHINE,
text: and PING PONG TABLE. (NOTE: They’re completely unaware of
text: what’s happening outside). James shuts the door as
text: Charlie moves away from his devastated parents - just
text: watching them come undone.
text: Mary sinks into a chair - traumatized, still trembling.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: My God, my God, my God -
text: Behind her, James is still panting and pacing back and
text: forth - when he suddenly stops and withdraws his gun.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: OK. Here’s what we’re gonna do.
dialog: You two stay put. I’11 go find
dialog: Zoey and bring her back here.
text: Mary looks at James as if he’s lost his head:
speaker_heading: MARY
text: HENRY JUST TRIED TO FUCKING KILL
dialog: YOU, JAMES! YOU CAN’T GO OUT
text: THERE! HE MIGHT TRY AGAIN!
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I DON’T CARE! I NEED TO SEE IF
text: ZOEY’S OK AND GET HER AWAY FROM
dialog: THAT HOMELESS MAN!
text: James begins moving to the door with purpose and haste
text: when Mary stands and steps in front of her husband:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Hold on, for godsakes! Henry
dialog: didn’t shoot at me. So I’ll go.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: James takes that in - knows his wife’s right.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I don’t want you out there alone
dialog: with that Man.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: We have no choice, James. Now
dialog: gimme your gun, and the keys to
text: the weapon’s cabinet. I’11 take
dialog: all the weapons so he can’t get
dialog: them, just in case.
text: James reluctantly hands Mary his gun and a set of keys.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You sure you can do this?
text: Mary shakes her head - she doesn’t know. Husband and
text: Wife share one last desperate look. Mary then moves off,
text: leaving James and Charlie behind.
scene_heading: INT. SANDIN MANSION - FRONT HALL - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
text: As Mary exits the play room - pulling the door shut. She
text: pauses - overwhelmed. The house is quiet around her,
text: until BAM! BAM! LOUD RUNNING FOOTFALLS on the SECOND
scene_heading: FLOOR. SOMEONE (Zoey, Henry, The Stranger) MOVING FAST.
text: The SOUND nearly makes Mary jump out of her skin.
text: Mary takes out the GUN. It’s awkward in her hand. She
text: moves up the STAIRS - timidly. The tranquil domesticity
text: of her bright home broken by STREAKS of BLOOD lining the
text: floor, presumably Henry’s blood, or blood from the
text: Stranger. She continues down the hall to:
scene_heading: THE SECURITY ROOM
text: Checks the MONITORS. Quiet outside. She opens the
text: WEAPON’S CABINET. Grabs all the GUNS - places them in a
text: PINK SATIN PILLOWCASE and moves back into the:
speaker_heading: HALL
text: And travels to ZOEY’S BEDROOM - blood saturating the rug
scene_heading: here. Zoey’s DOOR CRACKED - NOT LOCKED.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Zoey - Zoey - it’s me.
text: No answer. Mary pushes open the door and sees HENRY. A
text: bloody mess. NO SIGN OF ZOEY. Mary checks Henry’s
text: pulse. He’s gone. Tears flow as she eyes the dead young
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: She looks around the ROOM, down the HALL. Zoey could be
text: anywhere - so could the Stranger. She doesn’t know what
text: to do - her eyes fall on the PHOTOS of ZOEY - the perfect
scene_heading: American Teen. SHE DOESN’T SEE:
text: A HINT of MOVEMENT all the way at the END OF THE HALL.
text: 15 yards away. It’s THE BLOODY STRANGER. He stops -
text: spotting Mary - her back to him - gun dangling at her
text: side. The Scalped Stranger now clutches his LONG KNIFE.
text: Mary continues to stand in a fugue state of despair, not
text: knowing what to do. She doesn’t see the Stranger slowly
text: MOVING FORWARD - coming RIGHT TOWARDS HER now - blood
text: dripping off his torn-up head and onto her carpet.
text: Mary’s just standing there, terrified, contemplating her
text: next move - unaware - as The Stranger draws closer,
dialog: closer, CLOSER, when:
text: RING! THE PHONE. Mary jumps, terrified. She SPINS,
text: looking for the PHONE. The Stranger quickly SIDE-STEPS
text: into an ADJOINING HALL - DISAPPEARING just before Mary
text: sees him. She finds the PHONE, picks it up, and HEARS:
speaker_heading: ZOEY (O.S., OVER PHONE)
text: HE'S DEAD, MOM! HENRY’S DEAD!
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Zoey - are you hurt - are you OK?
scene_heading: INTERCUT MARY WITH:
text: ZOEY - WE CAN'T TELL WHERE SHE IS. She’s crouched in a
text: ball - rocking back and forth - face and Catholic School
text: Girl uniform suffused with Henry’s blood. She looks like
text: hell - blood-drenched, emotionally devastated. She has a
text: GUN (Henry’s GUN) in one hand - her CELL in the other.
text: She can barely speak between heaving sobs:
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: I have his blood all over me!
text: Zoey’s intense sorrow brings immediate tears to Mary.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I’m so sorry, baby.
dialog: Then:
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: Daddy killed him.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: It’s not your father’s fault,
text: Zoey. Henry tried to kill him.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: Henry was just trying to make me
dialog: happy! Because he loved me! If
dialog: Daddy didn’t make me so miserable,
dialog: Henry wouldn’t have done this and
dialog: he'd still be alive!
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Zoey, please, calm down - you
dialog: gotta listen - there’s a man in
dialog: the house - tell me where you are.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: No! Stay away from me! 1/11 kill
dialog: myself if anyone comes near me! I
dialog: have nothing to live for anymore -
dialog: Daddy took it all away!
text: Her weeping reaches a crescendo - the young girl’s having
text: an emotional breakdown.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Your father loves you, Zoey. He
dialog: never meant to hurt you. Now
dialog: please, there’s a man, you need -—
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: - He doesn’t love me! I’m just a
dialog: thing - like this big house!
dialog: Something to brag about.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Oh Zoey, please listen, baby -
text: Mary then HEARS Zoey quietly babbling to herself:
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: - He was right. Henry was right.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What? What did you say, Zoey?
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: (explosion)
dialog: I WISH DADDY WAS FUCKING DEAD,
dialog: MOM! I WISH HE WAS DEAD!
text: Something about the way Zoey says that sends a chill up
text: Mary’s spine. These harsh words linger - like a threat.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Don’t say that, Zoey - you’re very
dialog: upset - you don’t mean that.
dialog: Please, baby, tell me where -
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
text: Click. The line goes dead. Zoey is gone.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Zoey - Zoey -
text: Silence. Dead phone. Mary quickly dials - gets Zoey’s
text: MESSAGE. PHONE OFF NOW. Mary’s panicking, trying to
dialog: figure out what to do next when she HEARS:
text: A terrifying CACOPHONY of FEROCIOUS GROWLS and BARKS.
text: Mary moves to the WINDOW - looking THROUGH the
text: OBSERVATION SLOT, seeing TWO NEIGHBORHOOD DOGS fighting
text: over a SEVERED BLOODY HUMAN HEAD on the lawn of the HOME
text: into which the GUILLOTINE was brought earlier.
text: Mary stares at the bloody Head, horrified, and suddenly
text: ARRGGGGHHH! She vomits! And as she releases all over
text: her daughter’s rug, SHE DOESN'T SEE:
text: THE MOVEMENT OUTSIDE HER HOME. It’s those SHADOWY MEN we
text: saw running onto the cul-de-sac and surrounding the
text: Sandin mansion. They’re still hard to see, still lurking
text: in darkness. But ONE of THEM is standing under a POOL of
text: STREETLIGHT, revealing himself to be:
text: A YOUNG MAN dressed as an AMERICAN INDIAN WARRIOR,
text: incongruously donning a CASPER THE FRIENDLY GHOST MASK.
text: He’s drenched in BLOOD and holding a freshly-sliced HUMAN
speaker_heading: SCALP.
text: Mary doesn’t notice him - she doesn’t see him eyeballing
text: her home intensely. Mary turns away from the window,
text: moving to the DOOR of ZOEY’S ROOM. She looks down the
text: HALL - long, winding. The house is huge.
text: She hears BAM! A distant NOISE in the HOUSE. She JUMPS.
text: Startled, freaked. It could be Zoey - or the Stranger.
text: She then SEES a DISTANT SHADOW on the STAIRCASE all the
text: way across the HOME - THERE and THEN GONE in a FLASH.
text: She then HEARS SOMEONE RUNNING ABOVE HER IN THE ATTIC.
text: THEN ANOTHER ROUND of those vicious BARKS from OUTSIDE.
text: Sensory overload of pure fear. Mary’s head is spinning -
text: face twisted in near panic. She’s trembling - lungs
text: rising and falling like a bellows - her eyes darting
dialog: about - this housewife is losing her cool completely.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PLAY ROOM - NIGHT
text: James paces back and forth, mind racing, still in shock.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Charlie’s just watching his father, when THE DOOR SWINGS
text: OPENS - father and son both tense up as MARY enters in a
text: burst, carrying that pillowcase full of guns. She’s
text: breathing hard, face flushed, eyes red.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: - Are you OK? Where’s Zoey?
text: Still getting her breath back - barely able to speak:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I spoke to her. On her cell. I
dialog: don’t think she’s hurt. But -
text: Mary pauses.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: - Henry’s dead.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Oh my god. No.
text: They hold a sobering look. Mary’s still freaking - fear
text: eating her alive. James suddenly MOVES to the door:
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: I need to go get Zoey.
text: Mary quickly steps in front of him - stopping him:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: James - stop. No. You can’t go
dialog: look for her.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: We can’t provoke her right now -
dialog: she’s out of control - she
dialog: threatened to kill herself and -
text: She stops. There’s something she doesn’t want to say.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: She said she wished you were dead.
text: It was almost like a threat.
text: Stillpoint. James physically retracts as if punched in
text: the face by that statement. He stands absolutely shell-
text: shocked. All he manages to say is:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: A ‘threat’. From my daughter.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I don’t know, James. We just need
dialog: to give her time to calm down.
text: James can’t move - he’s agape - still processing what
text: Mary’s told him - shaking his head in stunned, devastated
text: disbelief. After a beat, he takes a breath - trying hard
dialog: to stay cool in the wake of what he just heard:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: OK. We’ll let her calm down.
dialog: (then)
dialog: But what about the Homeless Man?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I know, James - I don’t know what
dialog: the hell to do anymore!
text: As the desperate, terrified Sandin Parents try to figure
text: out their next move, Charlie has noticed something - a
text: subtle, muffled SOUND RISING 0.S. - barely perceptible.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Did you guys hear that?
text: But James and Mary aren’t paying attention:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (re: The Stranger)
dialog: Maybe he just wants to hide.
dialog: Again:
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Did you guys hear that noise?
dialog: Mom and Dad are still not listening:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (responding to Mary)
text: Maybe he doesn’t. JZoey’s out
text: there with him.
text: And then, out of nowhere, CHARLIE SCREAMS at the top of
dialog: his lungs:
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: AHHHHHHHHHH!
text: That immediately shuts James and Mary up. They're
text: finally paying attention to him now:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop talking. Do you hear that?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Hear what, Charlie? I don’t -
text: And then, as if on cue, the 0.S. SOUND RISES again - it’s
text: clear this time - a DISTANT YOUNG MAN’S POLITE VOICE -
text: TALKING THROUGH A BULLHORN - in the near distance:
scene_heading: DISTANT POLITE BULLHORN VOICE
dialog: (0.S.)
dialog: Hello. Hello. Is anybody out
dialog: there? Is anybody home?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That. Did you hear that?
text: Mary and James heard it too now. Before they could
dialog: react:
scene_heading: DISTANT POLITE BULLHORN VOICE
dialog: (0.S.)
dialog: Mr. and Mrs. Sandin - I sure hope
dialog: you can hear me because this
dialog: concerns you and yours.
text: Something about hearing their name sends a chill up
text: everyone’s spine. James stops pacing:
speaker_heading: JAMES
text: It's coming from the front.
text: They quickly move to the WINDOWS in front of the room.
text: All looking through the OBSERVATION SLOTS into the FRONT
text: YARD AND THE STREET BEYOND. And as soon as they look out
text: - they all JUMP, STARTLED BY WHATEVER THEY ARE SEEING:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Oh my God.
text: They're collectively agape. They all look out again and
text: this time WE SEE WHAT’S GOT THEM SO SPOOKED:
scene_heading: MARY’S, JAMES’ AND CHARLIE’S POV THROUGH OBSERVATION
speaker_heading: SLOTS OF:
text: 8 YOUNG MEN - no one older than 25 - in front of and
text: surrounding the SANDIN HOME (including the Scalp-Holding,
dialog: Casper The Ghost-Masked Apache Indian we saw just moments
dialog: ago).
text: These are the SHADOWY FIGURES that ran onto the cul-de-
text: sac earlier. But they are no longer hiding in the dark.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
text: They are now out in the open and unpacking an arsenal of
scene_heading: weapons - MACHINE GUNS, FUTURISTIC RIFLES, KNIVES, AXES
scene_heading: etc. They are SWIGGING LIQUOR - POPPING PILLS - SNORTING
text: COKE - getting ready for some kind of drug-fueled battle.
text: And they are all freakishly DRESSED. Halloween Gone Mad.
text: ONE YOUNG MAN WEARS A REVOLUTIONARY SOLDIER’S UNIFORM and
text: BOZO MASK. He’s WAVING an AMERICAN FLAG that’s streaked
text: with BLOOD.
text: Another YOUNG MAN is DRESSED AS THE POPE - with LARGE
text: FAKE RUBBER BREASTS draped over his robe with blood
text: dripping from the nipples.
text: ANOTHER MAN is WEARING nothing but DIAPERS and a WEREWOLF
text: MASK. He is holding a SHOTGUN and a MORNING-STAR - an
text: ancient weapon - a steel ball on a chain with spikes.
text: THE MAN holding the BULLHORN - the Leader - is leaning on
text: the SANDIN MAILBOX (SANDINS stenciled across it). He's
text: dressed as a YOUNG GIRL with a BLONDE WIG and a SHORT
text: DRESS. He’s also wearing a PIG’S NOSE and holding a
text: BLOODY AXE as he addresses the Sandin Home with
dialog: exaggerated elocution and politeness:
scene_heading: POLITE LEADER WITH BULLHORN
dialog: - OK, I guess I'll deliver my
dialog: message to the absentee family.
dialog: My mates and me are all gussied up
dialog: in our most terrifying guises of
text: death and doom but with no one to
dialog: violate and annihilate because our
dialog: target escaped us and YOU'VE
text: inexplicably given him sanctuary.
dialog: Oh, Mister and Misses, he’s a bad
dialog: egg, if you only knew what He did
dialog: to us, you’d give him right back
dialog: so we could destroy him and Purge
dialog: our demons. But you are denying
dialog: us. And that, my good people, is
text: one serious faux pas.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So here’s the plan, Sandins - you
dialog: will return Him to Us - Alive - or
dialog: You will be punished. You have
dialog: until our provisions arrive -
dialog: provisions which will help us
dialog: break into your home - to do so.
dialog: If you don’t deliver him by the
dialog: aforementioned time, we will Purge
dialog: our negative emotions by releasing
dialog: the beast on Him - and You. And
dialog: we can enter any home we want and
dialog: we will want as wanting is our
dialog: will on this fine night.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (5)
scene_heading: POLITE LEADER WITH BULLHORN
dialog: Please don’t force us to hurt you
dialog: as your beautiful home tells us
dialog: that you are good folk - one of us
dialog: - and we don’t want to kill our
dialog: own. Please let us wee little
dialog: boys Purge - it is our right and
dialog: right we are. Too-da-loo,
dialog: Sandins!
text: Beat. Mary, Charlie and James stand frozen. The
text: Bacchanalian barbarity of the Polite Leader and his merry
text: band of Freaks sweeps through them like cold-water shock.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: No.
dialog: Then - adding to their panic:
text: THE LIGHTS GO OUT. They’re thrust into eerie darkness.
text: A mere sliver of exterior moonlight finding entry through
text: the OBSERVATION SLOTS grants them minimal vision.
text: James moves to the DOOR - peers out into the HALL - sees
text: the LIGHTS are OFF in the REST of the HOME also.
text: Everything’s happening fast now - fear rising rapidly:
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Why did the lights go out?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: It’s him.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Who? That lunatic outside. How?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: No. The Homeless Man. He killed
dialog: the lights because he doesn’t want
dialog: to be found. He doesn’t want to
dialog: go back out there.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Understandably.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Can they really get through our
dialog: security, James?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I don’t know. It’s hard to say.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: ‘Hard to say’. For godsakes, you
dialog: sell this equipment, James!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: Silence.
dialog: 51.
dialog: (6)
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (losing it)
dialog: I DON’T KNOW! It’s more of a
dialog: deterrent - it looks good so it
dialog: keeps people away! Goddamn it,
dialog: things like this aren’t supposed
dialog: to happen in this neighborhood!
speaker_heading: MARY
text: BUT THEY ARE HAPPENING! THEY'RE
text: HAPPENING RIGHT NOW!
text: Just their heavy breaths in the dark. Then:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: We have to give them what they
dialog: want. We find the Homeless Man
dialog: and force him outside. We have
dialog: guns - he doesn’t. We can do
dialog: this. It’s the only way.
text: Charlie reacts - shocked by that:
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: But they’11 kill him!
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Christ, Charlie, it’s either him
dialog: or us, son.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: But he didn’t do anything to us.
dialog: Why should he die?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Because I don’t want to. And I
dialog: don’t want you, your mother, or
dialog: your sister to.
text: James looks to Mary for support. Mary takes a beat -
text: then reluctantly nods, agreeing. Charlie’s face falls,
dialog: devastated, as:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What about Zoey? I don’t know
dialog: what she’ll do if she sees you
dialog: right now, James. But I can’t
dialog: find this man alone. No fucking
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Of course not. We do this
dialog: together. Let’s pray Zoey has
dialog: calmed down.
dialog: (dramatically)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (7)
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: We don’t have a choice, guys. If
dialog: we don’t find this Man, we’re not
dialog: gonna make it through the night.
text: That hangs there. Off their terrified faces -
text: CUT TO BLACK.
text: UNTIL A FLASHLIGHT BEAM CUTS A SWATH IN THE DARK.
scene_heading: INT. SANDIN HOME - SAME
text: MARY - holding that flashlight - moving slowly down a
text: dark hall, absolutely terrified. She has her gun up and
text: out. She is clearly looking for the Stranger. The big
text: search, through her once peaceful home, is underway.
text: She comes upon a DOOR. Slowly opens it, wary, shining
text: her light within - illuminating:
text: A DEAD BODY - at first we don’t know who it is - then we
scene_heading: realize its MR. KANE. HIS FACE BLUE, SWOLLEN. ONE
text: GUNSHOT in his HEAD, ONE in his CHEST.
text: Mary stares, unnerved. She closes the door.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SANDIN HOME - NIGHT - SAME
text: Dark, and dreadfully silent here also. ANOTHER
text: FLASHLIGHT fractures the black. WE FIND:
text: JAMES - moving down a DIFFERENT HALL - careful footfalls
text: on wood floors - he, too, is searching for the Stranger.
text: Suddenly, an 0O.S. VOICE penetrates the eerie silence:
speaker_heading: POLITE LEADER (0.S., THROUGH
speaker_heading: BULLHORN )
text: In one corner - the Sweet Suburban
dialog: Sandins -
text: James moves to a NEARBY WINDOW looks out the OBSERVATION
speaker_heading: SLOT and SEES:
text: THE POLITE LEADER and HIS BAND OF HEAVILY ARMED FREAKS
text: sitting on his FRONT LAWN now - snorting coke, pissing,
text: laughing like hyenas, and staring up at his home as if
text: they were watching a sporting event. The Leader is
text: speaking through his bullhorn like a sport’s commentator:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: POLITE LEADER (CONT’D)
dialog: Their opponent - The Dirty
text: Homeless Fuck. A steel cage blood
dialog: battle for the ages. Can the
dialog: Sandins save themselves? Or will
dialog: they become martyrs? The clock is
dialog: ticking! Let the games begin!
text: The FREAKS RAISE THEIR WEAPONS in the AIR and BEGIN
text: SHOOTING wildly into the NIGHT.
text: James watches them, agape.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PLAY ROOM - NIGHT - SAME
text: A SINGLE SHAFT of LIGHT illuminates YOUNG CHARLIE’S
text: TERRIFIED FACE - which seems to be hovering in darkness.
text: Charlie sits alone, holding a gun in his lap and a
text: flashlight up to his own face. He has obviously been
text: told to stay put. He has also switched his WATCH to
scene_heading: MEDICAL MONITOR-MODE as WE HEAR the RHYTHMIC BEEP BEEP
text: BEEP of his PULSE - filling the silence like a metronome
text: in the dark.
text: Suddenly, Charlie HEARS an unnerving CREAK - right
text: outside the room - he tenses, shines the LIGHT and SEES
text: THE DOOR HANDLE/KNOB SLOWLY TURNING. Someone is trying
text: to come inside. The rhythmic BEEPING QUICKENS - his
dialog: heart rate rising - 85,86,87.
text: KNOB still turning. HEART MONITOR BEEPING. Charlie hits
text: a button, turning his watch to CLOCK MODE - silencing the
text: BEEPS - afraid it’s giving away his position.
text: Quiet now as the DOOR KNOB keeps TURNING, then, BAM! An
text: O.S. NOISE followed by FOOTSTEPS. Is the person gone?
text: We HOLD on CHARLIE’S FACE when his expression tightens -
text: an idea. He reaches in his pocket - finding THE REMOTE
text: CONTROL FOR HIS RABBIT and HI-TECH GLASSES.
scene_heading: INT. SANDIN MANSION - NIGHT - SAME
text: MARY ascends a BACK STAIRCASE now - moving to the SECOND
text: FLOOR. The house is disturbingly quiet. She turns down
text: the HALL and enters her:
speaker_heading: BEDROOM.
text: As Mary's flashlight sweeps the room, she doesn’t see:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: ZOEY. Standing yards behind her in the HALL OUTSIDE this
text: bedroom. The Young Girl’s covered in blood, staring at
text: her mother, tear stained face numb. Her emotional
text: destruction has left her looking strange, almost Zombie-
text: like. She walks off, disappearing in the darkness.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SANDIN HALLWAY - NIGHT - SAME
text: As James creeps along - searching every nook and cranny
text: of his home for the Stranger. He turns into the DINING
text: ROOM, flashlight COMBING the area. Suddenly, there’s a:
text: A BURST of WILD MOVEMENT in the REAR of the DINING ROOM.
text: It's THE STRANGER - hauling ass through the BACK ENTRANCE
text: of this ROOM as James’ light crosses his scarred frame.
text: James, startled at first, kicks into a RUN - giving
text: CHASE. His flashlight BOUNCING UP AND DOWN - catching
text: fleeting glimpses of the retreating STRANGER.
text: The Stranger thunders UP A NEARBY STAIRCASE.
text: James RAISES HIS GUN and POP! POP! AWKWARDLY FIRES TWO
text: SHOTS! Both missing The Stranger. James HEARS the
scene_heading: Polite Leader’s 0.S. COMMENTARY:
speaker_heading: POLITRE LEADER (0.S., THROUGH
speaker_heading: BULLHORN )
dialog: Has someone drawn first blood?
dialog: Careful with those bullets, Sweet
dialog: Sandins - remember - deliver He
dialog: alive or You will be penalized!
text: James keeps running - ignoring the Leader - UP THE
text: STAIRS! But he TRIPS - dropping his gun and flashlight.
text: He retrieves them quickly - then reaches the SECOND FLOOR
text: - looks all around - NO SIGN of the STRANGER anywhere.
text: He’s gotten away.
scene_heading: INT. PLAY ROOM — SAME
text: CHARLIE now sits with his GLASSES ON and REMOTE IN HAND -

scene_heading: equipped with RED-TINTED NIGHT VISION. WE SEE:
scene_heading: VICTOR'S ROVING RABBIT POV of ROOMS - DOORS - LONG,

scene_heading: A DOOR OPENING. SOMEONE EMERGING - it’s THE SCALPED

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

text: She turns to exit, when she HEARS something OUTSIDE. She
text: peers through the WINDOW’S OBSERVATION SLOT, spotting TWO
text: ARMED FREAKS in her BACKYARD - ON GUARD. She then sees
text: SOMETHING ELSE that grabs her attention:
text: MOVEMENT behind her BACKYARD FENCE AGAIN. Ten yards
text: BEHIND the Freaks. In the forest - right where she saw
text: movement earlier. This time she sees what it is:
scene_heading: TWO OTHER PEOPLE - BOTH WEARING SMILEY FACE MASKS (just
dialog: like the Person we saw earlier on the security monitor)
text: standing in the FOREST BEHIND HER YARD. These Smiley
text: Masked People are LOOKING RIGHT AT MARY. The Armed
text: Freaks are unaware of them.
text: The Masked People WAVE HELLO to Mary and then run off.
text: Mary watches them go, confused, even more terrified.
text: She turns from the window, eyes landing on a LARGE STEAK
text: KNIFE lying on the kitchen counter. Mary can’t help
text: herself - she grabs it before exiting.

text: The Stranger, alerted, raises his knife and crawls toward
text: the RABBIT now.
text: CHARLIE holds steady - the man’s taut scarred face
text: looming large inside Charlie’s GLASSES’ MINI SCREENS.
text: The Stranger stares hard at the Rabbit - seeing it up
text: close. After a beat, The Stranger dismisses the toy, and
text: starts moving away when the RABBIT’S EYES FLASH AGAIN.
text: THE STRANGER pauses. Something about the Rabbit and its
text: clear attempt at communication has his curiosity piqued.
text: The Stranger waits for more as Charlie works the remote,
text: moving Victor forward now. The Stranger remaining
text: behind, just watching the Rabbit, considering it.
text: The Rabbit pauses - looks back at the Stranger - flashes
text: its eyes one more time. A signal - ‘follow me’.

scene_heading: SURREAL BLOODY POPE - SCREAMING AND LAUGHING MANICALLY:
speaker_heading: FREAKISH POPE

scene_heading: PEOPLE - HANGING from STREET-LIGHT POLES - dead - HUNG

scene_heading: CHARLIE - PLAY ROOM

text: covers the room, and to James’ utter surprise it
text: unexpectedly illuminates:
text: THE BLOODY STRANGER - in front of the closet now. James
text: freezes, startled, excited that he’s found the Stranger -
text: he targets him with his gun, when the Stranger speaks -
text: for only the second time - his raspy whisper:
scene_heading: BLOODY STRANGER
dialog: Don’t.
text: And that’s when James sees that The Stranger IS POINTING
text: A GUN TO THE HEAD OF:
speaker_heading: ZOEY
text: Bloody Stranger’s HOLDING ZOEY TIGHT, PRESSING A GUN
text: (Henry’s gun) AGAINST HER SKULL. The Stranger has
text: wrapped a CLOTH around Zoey’s MOUTH - HER CRIES stifled
dialog: under this GAG. To James:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BLOODY STRANGER (CONT’D)
dialog: Get back. Into the hall.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Please don’t hurt her.
text: James backs up, out of Charlie’s room - into the:
scene_heading: SECOND FLOOR LONG HALLWAY
text: James’ gun and flashlight still up. Zoey’s crying - gun
text: to her head as The Stranger steps out of Charlie’s room -
text: INTO THE HALLWAY - holding Zoey close - a hostage - a
text: shield. HE ENTERS THE LONG HALL - 5 yards from James.
text: James’ flashlight BEAM is catching the FEAR on ZOEY’S
text: FACE - the beastly intensity on BLOODY STRANGER’S FACE.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: Let her go, you sonofabitch!
scene_heading: BLOODY STRANGER
dialog: Lower your gun.
scene_heading: INT. PLAYROOM - SAME
text: Charlie is sitting terrified in the darkness - the
text: distant O.S. YELLS of his FATHER reaching him.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - SAME
text: As the standoff between James and the Stranger continues:
scene_heading: BLOODY STRANGER
dialog: I’‘1l let her go when this night is
dialog: over.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You’re going to get us killed!
scene_heading: BLOODY STRANGER
dialog: Lower your gun.
text: James doesn’t know what to do. And that’s when his
text: flashlight illuminates:
text: SOMEONE 5 YARDS BEHIND THE STRANGER - at the END of the
scene_heading: LONG HALL. IT'S:
text: MARY. She’s moving stealth-slow, her GUN UP. The
text: Stranger is unaware of her presence. She STOPS and tries
text: to TAKE AIM WITH HER WEAPON. To end this.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: BUT HER HAND is TREMBLING. Eyes pinned on the BACK of
text: the STRANGER and HER DAUGHTER in his grasp. She tries to
text: steady the weapon, but she’s unable to - hands quivering,
text: afraid she'll shoot her daughter, afraid to fire the
text: weapon, afraid to hurt the Stranger.
text: She lowers the GUN. Extracts the KNIFE from her POCKET.
text: James spies Mary’s moves - he keeps up the DIVERSION:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Please leave my family alone.
scene_heading: BLOODY STRANGER
dialog: Lower your weapon or I will hurt
dialog: her - and you.
text: James’ light catches Mary again - closer now - YARDS
text: BEHIND The Stranger. She’s shaking, terrified. SAME:
scene_heading: INT. PLAY ROOM - SAME
text: Charlie sits frozen in the darkness - the 0.S. SHOUTING
text: between James and the Stranger is RISING.
text: The young boy can’t take it any longer - he suddenly
text: STANDS and RUNS FOR THE DOOR.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - SAME
text: James and the Stranger still negotiating - Zoey’s MOANS
text: rising under that makeshift muzzle.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: We’ve done nothing to you. We
dialog: don’t deserve this.
scene_heading: BLOODY STRANGER
dialog: I don’t deserve it either. It’s
dialog: not an honor to die tonight.
text: Mary's right upon The Stranger now - pulling the knife
text: back with unsteady hands, sweating profusely, ready to
text: strike, but hesitating - unable to make a move.
text: Her conflict obvious.
text: James’ eyes widen with anticipation and frustration and
text: that’s when his FLASHLIGHT ILLUMINATES:
text: A BURST OF MOVEMENT BEHIND MARY.
text: IT’S CHARLIE - RUNNING into the HALL behind his mother.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: HIS STEPS THUNDER LOUD on the WOOD FLOOR - causing:
scene_heading: BLOODY STRANGER TO TURN - HEARING CHARLIE’S APPROACH!
text: STRANGER SPOTS MARY right behind him - illuminated in the
text: James’ flashlight beam.
text: ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE AS THE STRANGER instinctively
text: LUNGES for MARY - SHOULDERING ZOEY to the ground.
text: BOOM! ZOEY FALLS, SMASHES her head. Hard.
text: Bloody Stranger LEAPS on top of Mary - knocking her down.
text: James bolts forward, DROPPING HIS FLASHLIGHT - thrusting
text: us all into DARKNESS. GROUND LEVEL FLASHLIGHT BEAM
text: highlighting SHOES, RUG - running, frantic - it’s all we
text: can see - as we HEAR EVERYONE YELLING:
speaker_heading: JAMES (0.S.) CHARLIE (0.S.)
speaker_heading: MARY! MOM!
scene_heading: FOOTSTEPS. YELLING. SHADOWS. LIGHT. CHAOS. THEN -—
text: BAM! A GUNSHOT! A MAN GROANING O.S.! AHHHHH! THEN:
text: CLICK. A FLASHLIGHT BEAM penetrates the black,
scene_heading: HIGHLIGHTING:
text: MARY’S FACE and CHARLIE’S FACE huddled together. Mary’s
text: holding the flashlight.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Are you OK, Charlie?
text: Charlie nods. Mary's flashlight beam then finds:
text: ZOEY - on the ground, unconscious, head bleeding. Mary
text: moves to her - checks her for gunshot wounds:
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
text: Zoey! She’s unconscious. Christ.
dialog: And then:
speaker_heading: JAMES
speaker_heading: MARY!
text: Mary whips the FLASHLIGHT - finding:
text: JAMES standing center hall - out of breath - not hurt.
text: Her face tightens with utter shock when she sees that
text: James is pointing his GUN downward at:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
scene_heading: THE BLOODY STRANGER
text: Who’s on the FLOOR now - SHOT and BLEEDING from a BULLET
text: WOUND to his SIDE. He’s staring up at James (and James’
text: GUN) like a fierce animal CAUGHT in a trap. Mary can’t
text: believe it. Charlie’s devastated that the Stranger’s
text: been caught. Out of breath, James says:
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: Get some rope, Mary! Go get some
dialog: rope so we can get him outside and
dialog: end this fucking night!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SANDIN HOME OFFICE - NIGHT
text: LIT by a few CANDLES. ZOEY’S on a couch, still
text: unconscious. CHARLIE’S next to ZOEY - the young boy
text: looks horrified as he stares at:
text: JAMES and MARY - who have dragged the BLOODY SCALPED SHOT
text: STRANGER into this room and are now in the midst of
text: trying to secure him to a DESK CHAIR so they can deliver
text: him (roll him out) to the Freaks.
text: But the Stranger (gagged, limbs bound with duct tape) is
text: not making it easy - he’s fighting like a rabid dog as
text: the Sandins cruelly and clumsily attempt to roll him INTO
text: the CHAIR which is lying on its side (to accommodate the
text: Stranger’s forced entry into it).
text: It's pure chaos - the wealthy suburban Sandins are
text: bruised, sweating, screaming, as they struggle furiously
text: with the Stranger - his blood flying all over them.
speaker_heading: JAMES MARY
dialog: Push, Mary, before he He’s too strong. I’m so
dialog: breaks the rope again - sorry sir.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (re: The Stranger,
dialog: devastated)
dialog: He’s bleeding so much. Can you at
dialog: least stop his bleeding?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (panting)
dialog: Charlie - pay attention to your
dialog: sister. Is she waking up yet?
text: Charlie looks down - Zoey’s still out cold - when:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Get his legs, Mary! HE’S BREAKING
dialog: THE TAPE! GET HIS LEGS!
text: Charlie looks back at the Stranger - who’s bucking wildly
text: now. And next to Charlie - unbeknownst to everyone:
text: ZOEY is also watching. She’s conscious. The Young
text: Girl's peaking out discreetly - she clearly doesn’t want
text: anyone to know she’s awake. Her eyes still dance with
text: purge-induced dementia. She watches as:
text: James - WHOOSH! SLIPS in the Stranger’s growing BLOOD
text: POOL - flopping face down in it. Mary, overwhelmed by
text: what they’re doing to the Stranger, helps James up:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What a fucking nightmare.
dialog: Then:
scene_heading: POLITE LEADER (0.S. THROUGH
speaker_heading: BULLHORN, SINGING)
scene_heading: TICKETY TOCK. TICKETY TOCK.
text: Mary and James exchange a tense look. As James wipes
text: blood off his own face:
speaker_heading: JAMES
text: Sit on his wound, Mary.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What? Why? Oh my god. I can’t.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Just do it! It’ll work.
text: Devastated - teary-eyed:
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, Mom. Please. Don’t.
text: Mary can’t stop shaking her head in stunned disbelief:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Jesus Christ, this poor man. What
dialog: are we doing to him?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: If he just walked outside
dialog: willingly, we wouldn’t have to do
dialog: any of this.
text: Charlie suddenly STANDS UP DEFIANTLY. Behind him -
text: Zoey'’s watching again - peaking out - as:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: WILLINGLY?!? WE’RE GOING TO KILL
speaker_heading: HIM!
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Charlie, enough! - Mary, sit on
dialog: his wound! We don’t have time!
dialog: I’‘1ll hold him. - Sir, you're
dialog: making it harder on yourself -
text: Mary has her hands on her head - conflicted, emotionally
text: ravaged BUT she abides James’ command and SITS on the
scene_heading: STRANGER’S WOUND - HE BUCKS in INTENSE PAIN! Charlie
text: reacts - almost screaming. The Stranger stops resisting
text: for a beat and James seizes the moment - he pushes the
text: Stranger’s body into the chair - it worked.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: Tie him in, Mary! We got ‘em!
text: Charlie lowers his head, defeated. Mary’s expression
text: goes slack as she stares at the Stranger - seeing the
text: agony on his face. James sees his wife’s ghostly look:
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: You had no choice, Mary. It’s
text: almost over.
text: No response - Mary looks absolutely destroyed. A
text: funereal silence consumes the room as they secure the
text: Stranger to the chair - getting ready to wheel him out to
text: his death. The quiet is broken by:
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: He was a soldier.
text: Mary looks up at Charlie, baffled by that. Charlie
text: points - indicating a MEDALLION on a NECKLACE hanging
text: from the STRANGER’S NECK. It bears a U.S. MILITARY LOGO.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: A marine. He fought in the Ten
dialog: Year War. That’s his dog tags.
dialog: That's who we’re going to kill.
text: Mary considers the Stranger’s dog tags. Tears begin
text: welling up. She looks at her son - who admonishes his
text: mother with a disgusted look of pure disappointment.
text: Mary looks like she’s going to pass out. Something’s
text: happening to her. She’s trembling, shaking her head
text: uncontrollably, when suddenly:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: No. I can’t. I can’t do this. I
dialog: can’t do this anymore.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Mary - relax, keep tying him down.
dialog: We don’t have time.
text: Mary drops the tape and stands - pacing feverishly - all
text: her emotions boiling up.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: No. I just can’t. Oh my God.
dialog: It's fucking wrong!
text: Now James is on his feet - seeing his wife’s emotions
dialog: disintegrating:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Mary, we don’t have a choice here.
speaker_heading: Mary EXPLODES:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Stop saying that! Look at us,
dialog: James. Look at Zoey. Look at
dialog: this poor man. And Henry. And
dialog: Mr. Kane. We’re covered in blood,
dialog: James. It’s fucking everywhere!
text: James moves to Mary - tries to grab her arm to calm her:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Mary, we don’t have time for this.
text: Mary pulls away - SCREAMING at the top of her lungs now:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Don’t touch me, James. NO! What
dialog: the hell happened to us? LOOK AT
text: US! WE’RE COVERED IN BLOOD!
text: Mary's intensity silences James. They hold a long look,
dialog: when, breaking the MOMENT:
text: HONK! HONK! HONK! THE SOUND OF O.S BLARING HORNS! A
scene_heading: CACOPHONY OF MULTIPLE CAR/TRUCK HORNS SOUNDING OFF
text: disturbingly all at once - seemingly right outside their
text: home. The HORNS finally stop but another SOUND replaces
text: them - a DEEP RUMBLE - the roar of HEAVY MACHINERY:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: What the fuck is that now?
text: These dissonant SOUNDS have pulled Mary out of her
text: meltdown. And that’s when she turns and sees that:
text: CHARLIE IS GONE. The young boy is no longer in the room.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Oh my God. Charlie. Where did
dialog: you go, baby? Where did you go?
text: Desperate, terrified, Mary looks at her husband. James
text: just stares back at her, equally as overwhelmed. Mary
text: starts moving toward the door - calling out:
speaker_heading: MARY (0.S.) (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: CHARLIE!
text: She exits in a burst, leaving James alone with Zoey and
text: the Stranger now - that MYSTERIOUS RUMBLING SOUND rising
text: all around him.
scene_heading: INT. SANDIN HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Mary moves through the dark, flashlight leading the way.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: CHARLIE, WHERE ARE YOU?
text: There’s no sign of him anywhere. THAT MECHANICAL 0O.S.
text: RUMBLE is GETTING STRONGER - a vast infernal noise whose
text: source we haven’t yet seen. Mary moves to a WINDOW -
text: looks out - we don’t see what she sees, but we hear her
dialog: say:
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my god.
scene_heading: INT. HOME OFFICE - NIGHT - SAME
text: James stands in the middle of the room (that noise rising
text: around him) still in shock after Mary’s breakdown. He's
text: looking at the BLOODY STRANGER - tied to the chair,
text: staring at him. James walks toward the Stranger.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I’m sorry, sir, but I don’t see
dialog: any other way.
text: James is just about to wheel the Stranger outside, when:
speaker_heading: ZOEY (0.S.)
dialog: Daddy.
text: James spins - and quickly crosses the room to ZOEY -
text: who’s eyes are fluttering open. Zoey’s pretending to
text: awaken slowly, looking around, acting confused.
text: James sits next to her - cradling her head.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You hit your head, baby.
text: Zoey looks long and hard at James through glassy eyes.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: Zoey - how do you feel?
text: Long beat - then she mutters something under her breath.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t speak, baby.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I’m so sorry about Henry. I
dialog: really am.
text: Zoey stares at her father. Face sallow and numb. She
text: sits up, just looking at James with a thousand yard
text: stare. He smiles at her reassuringly. He then leans
text: forward and embraces her, holding her tight.
text: Zoey sees, behind James:
text: A LETTER OPENER lying on a nearby desk.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: We’re gonna make it through
dialog: tonight. It’s all gonna be OK
dialog: soon, baby.
text: Zoey takes the LETTER OPENER in her hand. She slowly
text: raises it behind James’ back. Her hand is trembling.
text: She’s starting to cry as she brings the glass high, when -
text: - James HEARS his daughter weeping. He breaks the
text: embrace, and immediately sees:
text: Zoey holding that LETTER OPENER in her trembling hand.
text: She’s teary-eyed, staring at him. And before James could
dialog: react:
text: Zoey feebly SLASHES at him. It’s a sad, pathetic strike
text: but the LETTER OPENER’S SHARP EDGE connects with James’
text: CHEEK - opening it up. BLOOD SPEWS. James steps back,
text: holding his face, shell-shocked.
text: Zoey steps back too, crying more now. She seems unable
text: to move, stuck in stance of stunned belief - Zoey is
text: completely shocked by what she just did.
text: She looks like a lost, confused young girl.
text: Father and Daughter stand feet apart, not moving.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: Zoey.
text: Zoey DROPS the OPENER and RUNS OUT of the room, as if
text: running away from her own actions. She retreats down the
text: hall, disappearing in the darkness.
text: James stands numb for a beat - he touches the blood on
text: his face - then the tears come. He’s unable to control
text: it. James is, right here, a completely broken man. He
dialog: sees:
text: THE BLOODY STRANGER across the room - lit by candles - a
text: wraith in flickering light, silently observing him.
text: James approaches the bound Stranger and stands over him
text: just as he stood over Mr. Kane earlier. James stares at
text: the Stranger, then TURNS and EXITS the room, closing the
text: door, shutting the Stranger within.
scene_heading: INT. HALL - CONTINUOUS
text: As James stands in the hall in front of the closed door -
text: behind which is the Stranger. James is motionless, lost,
dialog: when he sees:
text: MARY - moving quickly down the hall towards him. Charlie
text: is conspicuously NOT with her.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: - James? Where’s Zoey? Why are
dialog: you bleeding?
dialog: Then, quietly:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Zoey ran out. I don’t know where
dialog: she is. Where’s Charlie?
dialog: Fighting tears:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I don’t know where he is.
text: James absorbs that - his family has come undone - torn
text: apart by the night. He stands there, destroyed, like a
dialog: man who’s lost faith in everything he’s ever believed.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: (hopeless)
dialog: Our children are gone, James. And
dialog: those Freaks are coming in now.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: They brought trucks - they’re
text: gonna pull off the security doors
dialog: and come inside.
dialog: (then, re: the
dialog: Stranger)
dialog: Maybe you were right - maybe we
dialog: don’t have a choice.
text: Fatalistic beat. James staring at his wife. Two
text: desperate people. James’ expression slowly tightens - an
text: idea is clearly forming. He then says:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: No. Leave the Soldier in there.
dialog: Mary doesn’t understand:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You’re not sending him outside?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I have another idea.
dialog: And before Mary could question what that idea is, they
speaker_heading: HEAR:
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (0.S.)
dialog: What are you going to do?
text: They both turn - seeing Charlie - he’s been hiding
text: nearby, in the dark, spying and listening - as he always
text: does. He’s approaching his parents now - rejoining his
text: family as he’s heard what James just said. Mary slumps -
text: so relieved to her son.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: The Soldier’s gonna be OK,
dialog: Charlie. Don’t worry anymore.
dialog: You were right.
text: Charlie stares at his Dad - so relieved, so thankful.
text: James smiles sadly at his son as he continues:
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: Mary, take Charlie to the
dialog: basement. Take the weapons. Zoey
dialog: will be with you shortly -
text: James hands Mary the pink pillowcase full of guns.
dialog: Mary’s still very confused:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: - I don’t understand. What are
dialog: you gonna do, James? How will you
dialog: stop them?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: No time. Trust me. I love you.
dialog: All of you. Now go. Go.
text: James kisses Mary and Charlie. Mary’s still baffled but
text: listens to her husband, taking her son and running off.
text: James watches them go, tears in his eyes. THAT O.S.
text: RUMBLE GETTING LOUDER AND LOUDER.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SANDIN MANSION - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: A FLASHLIGHT BEAM dances through dark. In the minimal
text: light we see CHARLIE AND MARY - running hand in hand.
text: DOWN STAIRS. MAKING THEIR WAY TOWARD THE BASEMENT. AS
text: THEY RUN - THE O.S. RUMBLING SOUND OF THOSE TRUCKS RISES
text: ALL AROUND THEM. THE HOUSE IS SHAKING.
text: THEY STOP at a WINDOW - peering out, seeing:
scene_heading: THREE LARGE INDUSTRIAL TRUCKS - barely VISIBLE BEHIND
text: BRIGHT HEADLIGHTS saturating the lawn with light. THOSE
text: ARMED FREAKS move LIKE GHOSTS ALL OVER THE FRONT YARD.
text: They also glimpse CHAINS - strung up from the front of
text: the TRUCKS - all the WAY to their HOME - to the SECURITY
scene_heading: BARRICADES on MULTIPLE ENTRANCE POINTS.
text: Mary and Charlie continue on, REACHING THE BASEMENT DOOR.
text: OPEN IT. Hit the STAIRS, going down to:
text: THE BASEMENT BELOW. They stand there, in the dark,
text: flashlight granting minimal light. Their breaths heavy.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What’s Daddy gonna do?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I don’t know, baby. We’1l wait
dialog: here.
text: Silence. Waiting. And then they HEAR:
speaker_heading: POLITE LEADER (0.S.)
dialog: Mister and Misses - tickety tock
dialog: time is up. I do regret having to
dialog: kill ye good ol’ citizens but you
dialog: harbored He and denied Our right
dialog: to Purge. So here we come!
text: Charlie and Mary exchange a look of dread. And then:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: URRGGHHHHHH! The mind-numbing sound of STEEL BEING
text: RIPPED AND PULLED. The house is shaking as those O.S.
text: TRUCKS are straining to rip the barricades off.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Oh my God, baby.
text: Mounting panic. That SOUND of TWISTING STEEL RISES.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Whatever Daddy’s doing, I hope he
dialog: does it fast.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I know, baby. I hope he -
text: Mary stops - HEARING another SOUND - this one closer - a
text: BANGING on the DOOR that leads to the BASEMENT. Her face
text: suddenly falls with grim realization.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Stay here, baby. Do not move.
text: Charlie, baffled, watches his MOTHER take off - she’s
text: running toward the stairs - something’s clearly up.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: JAMES - FIRST FLOOR
text: Standing by the BASEMENT DOOR through which Charlie and
text: Mary just entered. James is MOVING a LARGE PIECE OF
text: FURNITURE in FRONT of that DOOR - blocking it for some
text: reason. This was the source of the BANGING Mary heard.
text: James then crosses the home, to the FRONT DOOR - the
text: SOUND of those ENGINES and STEEL BARRICADES being PULLED
text: resonates all around him.
text: James then does something else very strange - he OPENS
text: the FRONT DOOR - revealing the SECURITY BARRICADE that
dialog: protects it. SAME:
scene_heading: MARY —- BASEMENT STAIRS
text: Hauling ass up the stairs. She reaches the BASEMENT DOOR
text: - tries to open it but BANG! It’s blocked.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Goddamn you, James. This is not
dialog: the way!
scene_heading: JAMES - FRONT DOOR
text: Opening the LATCH at the base of the SECURITY BARRICADE.
text: He takes a moment, mustering up the courage to OPEN the
text: BARRICADE, revealing THE FRONT YARD of HIS HOME - BATHED
text: in the ASTRAL GLOW of THE TRUCK HEADLIGHTS. THE
text: THUNDEROUS ROAR of the TRUCK ENGINES is DEAFENING HERE.
text: James stands there, vulnerable - he squints, barely
text: seeing THE POLITE LEADER and HIS CRONIES just 20 yards
text: away - silhouettes against the LIGHT. James SCREAMS:
speaker_heading: JAMES
text: SHUT THE ENGINES AND LISTEN TO ME!
text: Polite Leader spots James standing under the threshold of
text: the now open front door.
speaker_heading: POLITE LEADER
dialog: Mr. Sandin - what brings you
dialog: outside on this good night, sir?
dialog: Shut the engines, gents.
text: The SOUND of the TRUCK ENGINES STOPS. Silence, then:
speaker_heading: POLITE LEADER (CONT’D)
dialog: Are you delivering He back to Me,
dialog: Mr. Sandin?
text: Now all the FREAKS are staring at James - dark amorphous
text: shapes against the truck headlights.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: We couldn’t find him.
speaker_heading: POLITE LEADER
dialog: ‘Tis bad news for Thee, Mr. S.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Wait. I would never deny your
dialog: right to Purge. Instead of him -
dialog: take me. You can still do what
dialog: you set out to do. Just please
dialog: don’t hurt my family - don’t come
dialog: inside - do what you will to me.
text: Polite Leader and his Cronies are silent - just staring
text: at James curiously. James is holding his arms out -
text: giving himself up - ready to die. He doesn’t see:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
scene_heading: ZOEY —- SECOND FLOOR
text: At the top of the STAIRS - peaking out from behind a WALL

speaker_heading: JAMES (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Me instead of him - just don’t
dialog: hurt my family.
text: Off Zoey’s fear and confusion -
scene_heading: THE BLOODY STRANGER - HOME OFFICE
text: Bound to that chair. Hearing James’ distant voice:
speaker_heading: JAMES (0.S.)
dialog: It's a fair trade. You still get
dialog: to Purge.
text: The Stranger takes in those words when his eyes fall on:
text: THE LETTER OPENER with which Zoey slashed James, on the
text: floor, just a yard from him. He eyes it.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: MARY —- BASEMENT STAIRS
text: WHAM! Still thrusting her body into that DOOR - trying
dialog: to move that piece of furniture. SAME:
scene_heading: JAMES - FRONT DOOR
text: Arms outstretched - body bathed in light - completely
dialog: vulnerable to the Polite Leader and his Freaks:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Please - take me - don’t hur-
text: Suddenly - WHUMP! James stops mid-sentence, body
text: flinching as if electrified. He looks down at:

scene_heading: JAMES - INSIDE THE HOME - BY THE OPEN FRONT DOOR

text: There’s blood everywhere and he can’t move fast. More
text: ARROWS JETTISON through the door - just missing James as:
speaker_heading: POLITE LEADER
dialog: Sorry, Mr. S - your deal won’t do.
dialog: You see, the Man you’re hiding
dialog: killed one of our friends when we
dialog: attacked him - and that’s not
dialog: acceptable - he’s just a useless
dialog: homeless cunt - a martyr to serve
dialog: Our need to Purge. And He needs
dialog: to be taught a lesson. So your
dialog: death won't help Moi. Deal’s off,
scene_heading: Mr. S. RELEASE THE BEAST, BOYS -—
dialog: LET THE KILLING COMMENCE!
text: VROOOM! The RUMBLE resumes as the ENGINES start up.
text: MARY quickly shuts the SECURITY BARRICADE, then returns
text: to her husband - he’s on his back - bleeding from
text: multiple arrow wounds - spitting up blood. She tries
text: covering his wounds - to stop the incessant blood flow:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Oh my god, James. What were you
dialog: doing, baby?
text: James’ distraught face bristles with regret as he says:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Look at us, Mary... I’m so
dialog: SOrry....
text: His statement hangs there like a confession. Mary begins
text: to cry. Husband and Wife hold a desperate look, when:
text: THE SOUND AROUND THEM REACHES A FEVER PITCH - the HOUSE
text: IS TREMBLING TUMULTUOUSLY. This all CULMINATES in a
text: SERIES OF VERY LOUD THUNDEROUS POPPING SOUNDS!
text: Then silence. No more shaking. No more noise.
text: Mary looks around, seeing THAT THE SECURITY BARRICADES on
text: the FIRST FLOOR have BEEN TORN OFF. Windows protected by
text: nothing but GLASS now. BLINDING SHAFTS of LIGHT (from
text: the LARGE 0.S. TRUCKS) enter through unprotected WINDOWS -
text: saturating the HOME in all-consuming phosphorescence.

dialog: They’re coming in, James. What

speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: No. It’s too late for that. We -
speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I’m not gonna be OK, baby. But

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (hysterical)

speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: - Listen to me. I need you to
dialog: live. Do what I say - prop me up
dialog: against the wall here. I/’11 kill
dialog: any motherfucker who comes inside.
dialog: You cover the other side of the

text: She staring at him - crying, terrified - but knows he’s
text: right. She HELPS HIM UP - he’s groaning - spewing blood -
text: but with Mary’s aide James pulls himself over to a nearby
text: WALL that faces the ENTRANCE and SEVERAL HALLWAYS. He
text: slides down the wall - leaning against it.
text: Mary withdraws several guns from the pillowcase - puts
text: them in James’ lap, when they see SILHOUETTES of those
text: FREAKS creeping toward their home. Mary kisses James.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: JAMES

text: JAMES turns, spotting SHADOWS of INTRUDERS approaching
text: the LIGHT-BLASTED WINDOWS OF HIS HOME. He HEARS A WINDOW
text: BREAK 0.S. He takes the SAFETY off his weapon. SAME:
scene_heading: CHARLIE - BASEMENT
text: ALSO HEARS the SOUND OF an O.S. WINDOW BREAKING. The
text: Young boy is seized by terror when he SPOTS SOMETHING 0.S

text: A LAUNDRY BASKET filled with CLOTHES. Charlie’s clothes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: MARY —- ACROSS THE HOME
text: This area is also HARSHLY LIT by those TRUCK LIGHTS.
text: MARY tries to look outside - but it’s hard to see - she
text: barely makes out the SHADOWS APPROACHING her EXPOSED
text: WINDOWS - it’s the ARMED FREAKS - drawing close. Then:
text: THE SOUND OF A WINDOW SHATTERING SOMEWHERE NEAR.
text: She spins, trying to locate it. Can’t. Silence. THEN
text: MOCKING LAUGHTER. And SOMEONE HOWLING like a WOLF.
text: Mary’s spinning as the FREAKS play a macabre game of hide
text: and seek - trying to scare the Sandins before they enter.
scene_heading: SUDDENLY WHAM! ANOTHER WINDOW SMASHED. MARY SPINS -
text: fishes out a SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN from the PILLOWCASE -
text: takes a WILD SHOT at a WINDOW - but doesn’t hit anyone.
text: Silence again. Another BURST of chilling O.S. LAUGHTER.
text: Mary is shaking uncontrollably. SAME TIME:
scene_heading: JAMES - FRONT HALL
text: James sits, scared, bleeding out - as those SHADOWS of
text: FREAKS MOVE OUTSIDE. He HEARS LAUGHTER here also - and
text: HOWLING and SOMEONE SINGING a haunting CHILD’S LULLABY -
text: and THE FREAKS BANGING - WHAM! WHAM! On DOORS, WINDOWS.
text: He’s peering around, vulnerable.
text: SUDDENLY WHAM! AN AXE DECIMATES the FRONT DOOR. James
text: blanches - then SHOOTS, unloading a CLIP into the DOOR.
text: But the AXE disappears - no one’s there any longer. His
text: gunfire useless. James continues eyeing the FRONT DOOR -
dialog: not seeing:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: THE FREAK - who’s entered a WINDOW on his periphery
text: (while James was shooting). It’s the CASPER THE GHOST-

text: toward James - ready to scalp James with his TOMAHAWK.
scene_heading: BASEMENT —- SAME
text: Where we now find CHARLIE WEARING SEVERAL MORE LAYERS of
text: CLOTHING. He looks bulky and bizarre as he stands there
text: sweating, trembling. After a beat - he can’t take it any
text: longer - CHARLIE RUNS for the STAIRS with his GUN UP. He
text: kicks open the BASEMENT DOOR and EMERGES into:
speaker_heading: THE FIRST FLOOR
text: Where he’s MET with SOUNDS of O.S. LAUGHTER and BANGING.
text: But Charlie pays no attention to it as his eyes fall on
text: his FATHER - across the FOYER - bleeding out. Charlie
text: stands frozen - staring at his bloody Dad. He doesn’t
dialog: see:
text: THE CASPER THE GHOST-MASKED APACHE - just yards away -
text: crawling - the Apache now has his sights on Charlie.
speaker_heading: JAMES
text: Trembling as he reloads his GUN, when he spies movement
text: on his periphery - it’s CHARLIE - layered up and out in
text: the open. James also sees:
text: THE APACHE - on his feet now and RUNNING at CHARLIE.
text: He’s seconds away from slicing CHARLIE when James raises
text: his gun and BAM! SHOOTS him in the CHEST - the Apache
text: falls at Charlie’s feet, dying. James then SPOTS:
text: A SILHOUETTE - in the WINDOW FRAME on CHARLIE’S RIGHT.
text: This SILHOUETTE raises a GUN to TARGET CHARLIE.
speaker_heading: JAMES
speaker_heading: CHARLIE!
text: Charlie is locked in panic - not hearing anything.
text: JAMES, bleeding from three arrow wounds, musters up every
text: last bit of strength and STANDS - STAGGERING across the
text: ROOM in a rush of challenged movement.
text: And just as that FREAK TARGETS CHARLIE - James tackles
text: his son - driving him hard to the floor - atop shards of
text: broken glass from a blown-out window - saving him.

dialog: Are you shot? Are you cut?

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: No, son. Gimme your gun and go

text: Charlie hands James his gun and runs off. James turns

text: EVERYWHERE. As if there’s a FREAK at EVERY WINDOW now.
text: Too many to target. He doesn’t know what to do.
scene_heading: INT. MARY’S WORK ROOM - NIGHT
text: Where the Bleeding Stranger, still bound to that chair,
text: has pushed himself over - tipping the chair on its side.
text: He’s inched himself upon the LETTER OPENER he saw
text: earlier. He has it in his hands (which are tied behind
text: his back) and he’s attempting to cut the rope that binds
dialog: him. GO TO:
scene_heading: MARY - BACK ROOMS
text: SOUNDS of the O.S. FREAKS all around her - as they

text: she inadvertently gets too CLOSE to a WINDOW and WHAM!
text: AN ARM SHOOTS THROUGH THE GLASS - SHATTERING IT and
scene_heading: GRABBING MARY! SHE SCREAMS - SPINNING and FIRING -
text: BLASTING THE FREAK in the CHEST. The Freak drops and
text: then WHAM! Another ARM ENTERS THE FRAME - YANKING MARY’S
scene_heading: SHOTGUN AWAY.
text: It's the POLITE LEADER this time - snarling with uber-
dialog: courteousness:
speaker_heading: POLITE LEADER
dialog: Evening, Misses.
text: Mary falls back - she’s crawling away when THE POLITE
text: LEADER climbs through the window - COMING INSIDE. Mary

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: POLITE LEADER (CONT’D)
dialog: I wish I didn’t have to do this.
dialog: You seem like a nice lady. Any

dialog: on a May-December type of youngy
dialog: oldie kissy lovey thing.
text: WHAM! Polite Leader dives at the fallen Mary. He swings
text: the KNIFE at her - barely missing as she scurries away.
text: He grabs her leg - pulling her back. He leaps on top of
text: her - straddling her - pinning her down.
speaker_heading: POLITE LEADER (CONT’D)
dialog: I’‘1ll make this quick. It’s not
dialog: about your suffering. It’s about
dialog: my Purging.
text: He raises the knife - she’s screaming in fatalistic
text: horror when BAM! A CONCUSSIVE BLAST and:
text: THE POLITE LEADER’S HEAD EXPLODES in a HAIL of BLOOD.
text: Mary lies covered in his brain matter when his headless
text: body flops off of her - revealing:
scene_heading: A SMILEY FACE MASKED PERSON IN THE WINDOW FRAME -
text: STANDING RIGHT OUTSIDE HER HOME - HOLDING a SHOTGUN,
text: having just blasted the Polite Leader through the window.
text: The Smiley just saved Mary. The SMILEY WAVES HELLO to

text: Mary, baffled, pushes herself away from the Polite
dialog: Leader’s body. GO TO:
scene_heading: FRONT HALL - SAME
text: BAM! BAM! BAM! JAMES tries to FIRE at the NUMEROUS
text: FREAKS (RIGHT OUTSIDE the WINDOWS) - but there’s just too
text: many to target. SUDDENLY:
text: CLICK. James’ gun goes empty. He tries another - it too
text: is empty. James is defenseless. He tries to crawl away,
text: but he’s lost too much blood. He drops his gun, as:
text: FREAKS begin climbing in WINDOWS all around him. James
text: shakes his head in defeat, when he sees something odd;
text: IT’S A SMILEY FACE MASKED PERSON quietly stepping BEHIND
text: one of the FREAKS who’s about to climb through a window.
text: (NOTE: THE FREAK is so consumed with the idea of coming
text: inside and killing the Sandins that he’s completely
text: oblivious to the presence of the SMILEY.)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The Smiley Face LOPS off this FREAK’S HEAD with a SWORD.
text: JAMES is baffled when he sees another SMILEY FACE quietly

text: The Smiley Face STABS the Freak in the back.
text: James then sees TWO FREAKS about to walk in the
scene_heading: SPLINTERED FRONT DOOR when TWO SMILEY FACE MASKED PEOPLE
text: step BEHIND THEM and BASH THEM with BASEBALL BATS.
text: These Smiley Face Masked People disappear into the dark
text: night after the attacks on the drugged-out FREAKS.
text: James, life fading from him fast, sits confounded.
text: Silence overtakes the house. The invasion seems to be
text: over, they've been saved by the mysterious Smileys.
text: James manages a smile, relieved, lying down, accepting

speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Did you see them Mary?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I did.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I don’t know who they are but they

speaker_heading: CHARLIE (0.S.)
speaker_heading: Mom —

speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Zoey —

text: gaze, turning and spotting:
text: ZOEY - emerging from the SHADOWS - she’s leaning over a
text: DEAD FREAK (NOTE: The Apache) - taking a GUN from him.
text: She raises the WEAPON - seemingly TARGETING HER FAMILY.
speaker_heading: MARY
speaker_heading: ZOEY - NO!
text: But Zoey isn’t listening - she unleashes a barrage of
scene_heading: GUNFIRE - UNLOADING HER ENTIRE CLIP.
text: Mary, Charlie and James are cringing as the bullets
text: blaze, until they realize they’re NOT being hit - ZOEY
text: ISN'T SHOOTING AT JAMES - she’s shooting at:
text: A FREAK - THE DIAPER-CLAD WEREWOLF - standing at the
text: splintered FRONT DOOR. He was targeting the SANDINS but
text: Zoey has just popped three bullets into his chest and
text: she’s still unloading more rounds into him.
text: He finally drops his gun, falls to the ground, dead.
text: Zoey saved her family. They stare at her in shock.
text: Zoey just stands there, blood-soaked, holding that
text: smoking gun. She looks nearly insane - as if the events
text: of the night have finally caught up with her.
text: No one moves. Everyone wondering what Zoey will do next.
text: Father and Daughter locked on each other, when Zoey

dialog: apart.
text: Zoey drops her gun and runs to James, embracing him.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: I’m so sorry, Daddy. I love you.
text: And she’s weeping now - it’s all coming out. James

text: BEEP... BEEP... of James’ dying heart.
text: BEEP... BEEP...
text: Then nothing. And James’ eyes finally close.
text: Zoey collapses. Charlie weeps. Mary holds her children.
text: And that’s when she HEARS - BAM! A NOISE somewhere
text: outside the house - it pulls Mary out of her grief:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Go to the basement. There’s no
text: windows there and one door which
dialog: we can safe-guard.
text: Charlie nods through tears. Zoey’s still weeping
text: uncontrollably - a basket case.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Zoey - I need you to pull it
dialog: together now. Take your brother
dialog: to the basement. Can you do that?
text: Zoey Manages a nod.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Good. Go now. I’1l be down ina
dialog: minute - I need to find some

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What’s taking Mommy so long?

text: POP! POP! TWO GUNSHOTS RING OUT - just missing her.
text: Mary crosses that ROOM - exiting into a HALL.
text: THE SMILEYS are hauling ass after her as MARY finds the:
speaker_heading: STAIRS
text: She ascends, taking two at a time. She reaches the:
text: SECOND FLOOR - running full tilt for her life - down the

text: end of the hall. She kicks open a door and ENTERS:
text: A HOME OFFICE.
text: She locks the DOOR, when BAM! The LOCK IS BLOWN off by
text: an O.S. GUNSHOT - delivered by the Smileys. The DOOR
text: swings open in a violent burst - Mary is thrown

speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Who are you? What are you going

text: OUT at the TWO SMILEYS. The blade SLICES SMILEY 1’s
text: THROAT - a second flash punctures SMILEY 2’s TEMPLE.
text: The Smileys drop. Mary spins, seeing them dying at her
text: feet. She’s baffled as to what just happened when:
text: THE BLOODY STRANGER - steps out from the SHADOWS - having

scene_heading: THE SMILEY FACES - KNOCKING OFF THE MASK, REVEALING:

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Mr. Halverson - what are -—
text: NEXT TO MR. HALVERSON are his OVERWEIGHT WIFE and his
scene_heading: ENORMOUS 18 YEAR OLD TWIN SONS (NOTE: THE TWINS ARE

text: with several other YOUNG NEIGHBORS, killed the Freaks).

speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr. Ramage. Mr. Cali. Susie,
dialog: Kenny. I don’t understand. Why?
text: The Neighbors just stare at the Sandin children blankly.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO TO US?
text: Mrs. Ferrin says matter-of-factly:
speaker_heading: MRS. FERRIN
dialog: The men will rape you and your
dialog: mother. Then we’ll kill all of
dialog: you and take everything we want
dialog: from your gorgeous home.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Why? Why?
speaker_heading: MRS. FERRIN
dialog: Because we hate you. We hate your

speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (realization)
dialog: You dug a tunnel. Are you crazy?
speaker_heading: MRS. FERRIN
dialog: It took us a year. Underneath the

text: Charlie looks at Zoey - his mind blown:
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That was the scratching, Zoey.
dialog: Daddy thought it was a raccoon.
text: That brings a SMILE to Mrs. Ferrin’s face. To all the
text: Neighbors’ faces. They all start LAUGHING.
text: Zoey and Charlie stare up at them, their tanned faces
text: contorted in laughter. It finally wanes and the

speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: Mrs. Ferrin, you don’t have to
dialog: hurt us.
speaker_heading: MRS. FERRIN
dialog: We do, young lady. It’s
dialog: unpleasant - but necessary.
text: Charlie goes to say something again - but he’s GAGGED.
text: As is ZOEY. They’re turned over and HANDCUFFED.
text: They can’t fight anymore, face down, bound. Their crying
text: eyes held on each other when THE SOUND OF A DOOR OPENING
text: O.S. gets their attention. They’re able to turn their
dialog: heads, seeing:
text: TWO MORE SMILEY FACE MASKED PEOPLE STANDING AT THE DOOR.
text: SEEMINGLY THE TWO PEOPLE WHO WENT AFTER MARY.
text: Everyone is looking at them as they enter. Mrs. Ferrin
text: addresses her cohorts - who are STILL WEARING MASKS.
speaker_heading: MRS. FERRIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Where are the Sandins?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
text: No response. The Two Smiley Face Masked People who are
text: standing under the threshold of the door oddly RAISE
scene_heading: their WEAPONS - TARGETING THEIR FELLOW NEIGHBORS. All
text: the NEIGHBORS are staring at them, baffled.
speaker_heading: MRS. FERRIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr. and Mrs. Langriche - what the
dialog: hell are you doing?
text: Suddenly, THE TWO SMILEY FACE MASKED PEOPLE REMOVE their
text: MASKS - REVEALING themselves to be:
text: MARY AND THE BLOODY STRANGER - a team now - making entry
text: by WEARING the MASKS and CLOTHING of the enemy. Holding
text: their weapons on the Neighbors.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Mister and Misses Langriche won't
dialog: be joining us. Drop your weapons.
text: Silence. All in shock. Mrs. Ferrin tries to make a
text: quick MOVE by raising her weapon but BAM! Mary shoots
text: her in the LEG. Mrs. Ferrin drops, howling as Mary
text: BELLOWS with FERAL INTENSITY:
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Anybody else want some? YOU? Mr.
dialog: Sabian? Mrs. Halverson? I’M NOT
text: FUCKING AROUND! C’MON!
text: The Neighbors are speechless. Mrs. Ferrin is bleeding,
text: crying, on the ground. Charlie and Zoey are staring at
text: MARY and THE STRANGER - thankful but shocked, as:
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Everyone drop your weapons. Zoey,
dialog: Charlie - over here.
text: The Neighbors drop their guns as Zoey and Charlie stand
text: with the help of the Stranger and move behind Mary - who
text: removes their gags. Then:
speaker_heading: MRS. FERRIN
dialog: Get it over with. Kill us
dialog: quickly.
text: Mary’s staring at the Neighbors for an extended beat -
text: the Stranger awaiting her command. Everyone’s looking at
text: Mary - but she continues to hesitate.
speaker_heading: MRS. FERRIN (CONT'D)
dialog: For godsakes - just do it. C’mon!
dialog: Then:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: They were going to kill us, Mom.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: It doesn’t matter. There’1ll be no
dialog: more killing tonight.
text: And that statement hangs there. Zoey and her Mother
text: holding a look when the bleeding Mrs. Ferrin makes
text: another quick move for a nearby GUN. BAM! Mary SHOOTS
text: Mrs. Ferrin in the OTHER LEG - YELLING:
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: ENOUGH! No one is killing anyone
dialog: anymore. Did you not hear what I
dialog: said, Mrs. Ferrin?
text: Mrs. Ferrin is writhing in pain now - from two bullet
text: wounds. Mary is a wild-eyed beast:
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: No more killing, you fucks. We’re
dialog: gonna play this night out in
dialog: motherfucking peace! DOES ANYONE
dialog: HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT?
text: No response. Everyone shocked speechless.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. SANDIN DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: All the NEIGHBORS, all alive, all now SEATED around the
text: SANDIN DINING ROOM TABLE, including a whimpering Mrs.
text: Ferrin whose bullet wounds are bandaged.
text: MARY, covered in blood, sits at the HEAD of the table.
text: CHARLIE and ZOEY are next to her. Also veiled in blood.
text: Charlie is still wearing the layers of clothes - he is
text: also donning his odd GLASSES and playing with the REMOTE.
text: The BLOODY STRANGER stands behind everyone (his wounds
text: also bandaged) - he’s covering the Neighbors with his
text: gun. He’s cleaned up and standing tall - he looks like
dialog: an absolute bad ass - the soldier he used to be.
text: The NEIGHBORS all have their heads down, EATING a big,
text: nearly gourmet BREAKFAST of OMELETTES, PANCAKES, FRENCH
scene_heading: TOAST, POTATOES, BACON, CEREAL, FRUIT, etc.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: gl.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: It's like some kind of bizarre DINNER PARTY - replete
text: with WALLS that have been RAVAGED by GUNFIRE and BLOODIED
text: GUESTS. It’s tense, everyone eating in silence, until:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: How’s the French Toast, Mr.
dialog: Halverson?
text: Everyone looks at Mr. Halverson. He mumbles something.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: I can’t hear you, Mr. Halverson.
speaker_heading: MR. HALVERSON
dialog: It’s very good.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Thank you. I appreciate that.
text: Everyone goes back to eating. The macabre dinner party
text: continuing in awkward silence - when we HEAR WHUMP WHUMP
text: WHUMP as Charlie (using his remote) steers VICTOR (with
text: the shirt still wrapped around his eyes) into the room.
text: Charlie puts Victor on the table. Everyone looks at the
text: RABBIT curiously before going back to eating.
text: Mary then raises the TV/INTERNET REMOTE and flicks on the
text: PROJECTION in the DINING ROOM. Everyone’s looking at her
text: as she types on the remote keyboard - searching for a
text: specific site - just as she did earlier. And just like
text: last time, as she types we begin to HEAR a BEEPING. Mary
text: (and everyone else) looks at the PROJECTION, seeing:
speaker_heading: WARNING
scene_heading: YOU ARE ABOUT TO ENTER THE-RESISTANCE.ORG. THIS WEB-SITE
text: Is NOT SANCTIONED BY ARCON. WOULD YOU LIKE TO PROCEED?
dialog: YES? NO?
text: Unlike last time, Mary doesn’t hesitate - she clicks YES.
text: The neighbors all seem very shocked by that as we see:
scene_heading: TV/INTERNET PROJECTION - as the site THE-RESISTANCE.ORG
text: appears and immediately displays a MAN’S FACE - up close -
text: looking right at US. It’s CARMELO JOHNS - the Purge
dialog: Detractor we saw protesting on TV in the morning. It’s a
text: live feed of Carmelo. But something’s wrong - his face
text: is bleeding, half his cheek ripped apart by a GUNSHOT as:
speaker_heading: CARMELO JOHNS (ON TV)
dialog: - Arcon’s found me. Burn the
dialog: Baptisia flowers and find the
dialog: American dream another way. Start
dialog: the revolution -
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: Mary stares at the dying Carmelo - moved. Everyone is
text: looking at her, confused as to why she’s watching him,
dialog: when suddenly, breaking this MOMENT:
text: WAAAA! A protracted SIREN beckons ominously 0.S. -
text: announcing the end of the Purge. Everyone’s looking at
text: Mary until the SIREN STOPS. Mary takes her eyes off the
text: TV - looks at her Neighbors, then addresses the Stranger:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Lower your weapon. It’s over.
text: The Stranger lowers his weapon. Mary does the same.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: (to the Neighbors)
dialog: Now get the hell out of my house.
text: The Neighbors begin filing out.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait, Mrs. Ferrin.
text: Mrs. Ferrin looks back at Mary.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: You're cookies tasted like the
text: inside of a cow’s ass.
text: The shell-shocked Neighbors, including Mrs. Ferrin,
text: continue on, down the hall, exiting. BEHIND THEM:
text: Charlie, Zoey, Mary and the Stranger are left alone now.
text: The Stranger breaks the moment, laying his gun down. He
text: casts one last look on the family before walking off.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Excuse me.
text: The Stranger pauses, looks back.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you.
text: The Stranger nods - then looks at Charlie. He reaches up
text: and removes his NECKLACE - his ARMY DOG TAGS. He flips
text: them to the Charlie, who catches them.
scene_heading: BLOODY STRANGER
dialog: Thank you, Charlie.
text: Charlie immediately puts the tags around his own neck.
text: The Stranger winks his one eye at the boy, then turns to
text: leave. Charlie stops him with:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Wait. Tell us who you are. Your
dialog: name. Are you really homeless?
dialog: Beat - the Stranger eyes Charlie - then:
scene_heading: BLOODY STRANGER
dialog: Lieutenant John Brakken - U.S.
dialog: Marine Corps. I fought in the
dialog: Fourth War - came home and served
dialog: under Arcon. Started drinking too
text: much - punched an officer and was
dialog: discharged. The drinking
dialog: continued - and I lost my way. I
dialog: ended up homeless. Here I am.
text: They stare at the Stranger - shocked he’s said so much.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Why didn’t you tell us any of this
dialog: when you first came in?
scene_heading: BLOODY STRANGER
dialog: You wouldn’t have listened. No
text: one listens.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What will happen to you?
text: The Stranger peers over at the TV - sees CARMELO bleeding
text: out. The Stranger looks back at the Sandins:
scene_heading: BLOODY STRANGER
dialog: Maybe it’s time to make people
dialog: listen. No matter what it takes.
text: Mary holds a look with the Stranger.
speaker_heading: BLOODY STRANGER (CONT’D)
dialog: Will you and your children be OK?
text: Mary considers the question - tears welling in her eyes.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I don’t know.
dialog: (peering around at
dialog: her bullet-ridden
dialog: home )
dialog: I just know I can’t be here right
dialog: now.
text: Another look between Mary and the Stranger. He nods to
text: her - a signal - ‘follow me’. The Stranger starts
text: walking out. Mary takes a beat, then stands, and says:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Kids.
text: Zoey and Charlie exchange a confused look. They both
text: finally rise, following their Mother as she starts out,
text: behind the The Stranger.
scene_heading: EXT. SANDIN MANSION - FRONT DOOR - MORNING - CONTINUOUS
text: As the FRONT DOOR OPENS and THE STRANGER steps out -
text: quickly followed by MARY, ZOEY, and CHARLIE (holding
text: Victor). They’re all squinting from the intense, nearly
text: blinding morning sunlight. They immediately see:
text: DEAD FREAKS peppering their lawn; HOMELESS PEOPLE
text: hanging from light poles; THE NEIGHBORHOOD MUTT carrying
text: the DECAPITATED HUMAN HEAD in its teeth.
text: The opulent cul-de-sac looks very different this morning.
text: The Stranger considers the carnage then starts walking.
text: Mary looks at her Children - they all seem a bit
text: perplexed by what they’re doing - but they all start
text: forward, following this Stranger, joining him as he walks
text: down the middle of the street, away from the cul-de-sac.
text: As they walk, Mary looks up at:
text: SKY-BOARDS peppering the sky - MOST PURGE PARTICIPANTS -
scene_heading: DALLAS! MOST MARTYRS - LAS VEGAS! ARCON'S REWARDS,
text: INCLUDING LOWER TAXES, WILL BE COMING TO THESE CITIES
text: VERY SOON! CONGRATS AMERICA ON ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL PURGE!
text: Mary looks away. She peers at the Stranger - who’s
text: walking forward, with purpose in his strides. She seems
text: oddly energized by him. Mary looks at her children:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: We’re gonna be OK, guys. Somehow
dialog: we'll be OK.
text: She takes her children’s hands in her own, and the
text: remaining Sandins and the Bloody Stranger continue onward
text: - leaving the cul-de-sac behind as the CAMERA RISES INTO
text: THE SKY watching this bloodied, but very alive foursome
text: walking off, together, into the hot morning sunrise.
text: FADE TO RED.
scene_heading: TO BE CONTINUED
