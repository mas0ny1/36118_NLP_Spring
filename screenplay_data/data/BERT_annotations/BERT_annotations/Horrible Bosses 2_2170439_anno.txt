dialog: April 20, 2012
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - MORNING
text: From overhead, we see a Toyota Prius chugging along down the
dialog: highway.
speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)
dialog: When you’re the president of the
dialog: 98th largest financial services
dialog: company in America you need to
dialog: project a certain image. An image
dialog: of boldness, strength and
dialog: confidence.
text: Suddenly, a brand new, shiny black Porsche Boxster
text: convertible ZOOMS around the Prius, leaving it in the dust.
text: As we move in, we see the driver of the Porsche is NICK
text: HENDRICKS. Sunglasses. Top down. Wind in his hair. He
dialog: looks pretty cool.
speaker_heading: NICK (V.0O.)
dialog: You’re not gonna get that image
text: driving a Prius.
scene_heading: EXT. COMNIDYNE PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Nick pulls into the lot and takes a reserved spot near the
text: entrance with a sign that reads “NICK HENDRICKS, PRESIDENT.”
text: He gets out of the Porsche and removes the dealer’s paper
text: floormat from under the pedals.
speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)
dialog: I put in a lot of years to become
dialog: president of Comnindyne and now I’m
dialog: earning a lot more and working a
dialog: lot... more. The strange thing is,
dialog: when I finally made it to the top,
dialog: I realized that I’d actually only
text: made it to the bottom of the top.
text: Nick heads toward the building, passing several parking spots
dialog: with much more expensive sports cars (Ferrari, Porsche 911
text: Turbo, Mercedes SLR McLaren) each with a sign bearing a name
text: and the title “PRESIDENT.”
speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)
dialog: Turns out Comnidyne has seven
dialog: presidents. And I’m the most
dialog: junior.
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MINUTES LATER
text: Nick enters to find his more senior COLLEAGUES in their
dialog: morning meeting.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Hey, sorry I’m late.
dialog: (holding up keys)
dialog: Had to stop by the dealership to
dialog: pick up a little something.
text: The others all react, impressed. PETER, 40's, squat, gnome-
text: like, heads to the window which looks down at the parking
dialog: lot.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well done. Hendricks got himself
text: some big boy wheels.
text: Another colleague, ARTHUR, 60’s, joins them at the window.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: (looking outside)
dialog: Which one is she?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (pointing)
text: Right there. She’s the Porsche.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Barely. You got a Boxster?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Uh huh. Two-thousand thirteen.
text: A sallow-looking woman, JEANINE, 50's, chimes in.
speaker_heading: JEANINE
dialog: Cost you that much?
text: The others all laugh derisively.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: It’s a great little car.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: That’s adorable. You’re a great
dialog: little man.
text: GLEN, 50's, hairpiece and jowls, steps up.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: I got my daughter a Boxster for her
dialog: Sweet 16. Made me take it back.
dialog: Said it was “too girly.”
text: They all laugh again. Nick grits his teeth.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Okay. Maybe we should get to work.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: You couldn't at least spring for
dialog: the Carrera?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Figured I’d go with the classic.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Uh, the Boxster was introduced
dialog: about forty years after the
dialog: Carrera. So, not exactly “a
dialog: classic.”
speaker_heading: JEANINE
text: (patting him on the
dialog: shoulder)
dialog: Don’t worry, Nick. Another ten
dialog: years here, you'll be able to
dialog: afford a real car.
text: Nick stares at her.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: All right, guys. Looks like the
dialog: Swiss are about to change their
dialog: drawdown regs, so we need to talk
dialog: about a new home for our master
dialog: feeder fund.
text: The presidents turn back to the piles of paperwork on the
text: table in front of them and resume their dreary work. As they
text: talk, the sound drops down and we PUSH IN on Nick as he
text: stares at his colleagues.
speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)
dialog: You know what’s at the top of the
dialog: corporate ladder? Another goddamn
dialog: ladder. I may be a president, but
dialog: I'm really just a fucking corporate
dialog: tool.
text: FREEZE ON Nick’s forlorn expression as the words appear over
dialog: him:
speaker_heading: FUCKING
speaker_heading: CORPORATE
speaker_heading: TOOL
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD POOL - DAY
text: We find KURT BUCKMAN sitting poolside on a chaise lounge,
text: reading US Weekly and sipping a can of beer.
speaker_heading: KURT (V.O.)
dialog: You're probably wondering, “how
dialog: does this handsome bastard get to
text: sit by the pool with a beer on a
dialog: workday?” Well, here’s how: you
dialog: quit your job, find a sugar mama
dialog: whose rich husband is out of the
dialog: picture and let her take care of
dialog: you.
text: He puts the magazine over his face and is about to take a
dialog: nap.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Kurt! Refill!
text: Kurt sets the magazine aside and springs to his feet.
scene_heading: INT. HARKEN LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Kurt enters, carrying three glasses of mojitos. Sitting on
text: the couch is RHONDA HARKEN and her friends, NIKKI, late 30's,
text: a lot of work done, and HEIDI, early 40’s, even more work.
speaker_heading: KURT (V.O.)
dialog: Does it bother me that my sugar
dialog: mama happens to be the ex-wife of
dialog: the man who tried to kill me and my
dialog: friends? Meh.
speaker_heading: RHONDA
dialog: (to the girls)
dialog: She spends thousands on Botox. She
dialog: should spend 50 cents on a razor
dialog: for that moustache.
speaker_heading: HEIDI
text: She looks like Tom Selleck with
dialog: fake boobs!
text: The girls cackle. Kurt quietly sets the glasses on the
text: coffee table and turns to go.
speaker_heading: RHONDA
dialog: Kurt. Really?
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RHONDA
text: The table. It’s African bubinga
dialog: wood. I’ve told you. Use a
dialog: coaster.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Right. Sorry.
text: He puts a coaster under each glass.
speaker_heading: RHONDA
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (back to the girls)
dialog: Speaking of Erica, have you seen
dialog: how fat her husband has gotten?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Have you seen my tub of shit
dialog: lately? He’s gained thirty pounds
dialog: since the holidays.
speaker_heading: HEIDI
dialog: (to Rhonda, indicating
dialog: Kurt)
dialog: At least you got a good one.
text: Kurt grins, flattered.
speaker_heading: RHONDA
dialog: He’s okay.
text: Kurt’s smile fades.
speaker_heading: RHONDA (CONT'D)
text: Getting a little doughy in the
dialog: middle.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: I don’t believe it.
speaker_heading: RHONDA
dialog: It’s true.
dialog: (to Kurt)
dialog: Pop that shirt off. Show them.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: RHONDA
dialog: The shirt. Pop it off.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: I’m not gonna--
speaker_heading: RHONDA
dialog: (sternly)
dialog: Pop it.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Rhonda, I really don’t--
speaker_heading: RHONDA
dialog: Pop. It. Off.
text: Resigned, Kurt takes his shirt off. He’s in pretty good
dialog: shape.
speaker_heading: RHONDA (CONT'D)
dialog: Look at that.
speaker_heading: HEIDI
text: He looks all right to me.
speaker_heading: RHONDA
dialog: No, look.
text: She grabs what belly fat Kurt has, pinching and jiggling it.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: RHONDA
dialog: How do we get rid of this? Because
dialog: this is gross. Here, touch it.
text: As the other women begin to poke and prod Kurt’s abdomen, he
text: sighs heavily.
speaker_heading: KURT (V.O.)
dialog: I guess the only real downside of
dialog: this whole arrangement is that
dialog: sometimes I feel kinda, I don’t
dialog: know, bad about myself. Like I've
text: turned into a ball-less little
dialog: bitch.
text: FREEZE ON Kurt as the words appear over him:
speaker_heading: BALL-LESS
speaker_heading: LITTLE
speaker_heading: BITCH
scene_heading: EXT. DALE’S HOUSE - DAY
text: DALE ARBUS opens the front door of his tiny house. His VERY
text: pregnant wife, STACY, bids him goodbye. Dale leans in to
text: kiss her, but her enormous belly makes it hard to reach her
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: DALE (V.O.)
dialog: It’s all happening. I got married.
dialog: Stacy’s pregnant-- with triplets!
dialog: And I finally got my sex offender
dialog: status expunged. Which is great,
dialog: because otherwise I’d have to stay
dialog: 100 yards from my own kids.
text: Dale crosses to his car and pulls out of the driveway.
scene_heading: EXT. DR. SLOCUM’S OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER
text: Dale pulls into the parking lot, passing a sign that reads
text: “DR. HARLEN SLOCUM, PEDIATRIC DENTIST” above an image of a
text: cartoon TOOTH having its own tooth pulled by another TOOTH
text: dressed as a dentist.
speaker_heading: DALE (V.O.)
dialog: I quit my dental assistant job and
dialog: got a new job. As a dental
dialog: assistant. But for a really sweet
dialog: man.
scene_heading: INT. DR. SLOCUM’S OFFICE HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Dale walks down a hallway, passing framed photos of DR.
text: SLOCUM in his dental scrubs at age 35... 45... 55... 75...
dialog: 80-something.
speaker_heading: DALE (V.O.)
dialog: A really sweet, really, really old
dialog: man.
scene_heading: INT. WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Dale enters a world of CHAOS populated by screaming KIDS and
text: a handful of exhausted PARENTS. Toys lie strewn everywhere.
text: A group of TODDLERS tear the upholstery out of a sofa
text: cushion. A RECEPTIONIST sits at a desk, oblivious.
text: Dale takes a step and TRIPS over something off-camera. He
text: looks down and picks up the CRYING INFANT he stumbled on.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Okay, whose baby is this? You
dialog: can’t just leave your babies on the
dialog: floor.
text: A harried MOTHER takes the baby from him as he carefully
text: picks his way across the kid-covered floor.
scene_heading: INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Dale enters to find a 4 YEAR-OLD BOY, GABE, hollering
text: miserably as DR. SLOCUM, 80’s, sits slumped asleep with
text: dental tools still inside Gabe’s open mouth.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Not again.
text: Dale hurries over and nudges the dentist awake.
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: Dr. Slocum! Wake up. You're with
dialog: a patient.
speaker_heading: DR. SLOCUM
dialog: (groggy)
dialog: What?! I know. What?!
text: Dale gently removes the tools from Gabe’s mouth. Gabe stops
text: yelling.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (to Gabe)
dialog: You're okay, buddy.
dialog: (checking)
dialog: Nothing bleeding here.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: I have to pee.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Okay. Bathroom’s down the hall.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Someone has to take me.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Where’s your mommy?
speaker_heading: GABE
text: She’s at Target.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Oh. Okay, I’ll take you.
speaker_heading: DR. SLOCUM
dialog: Hang on. I’ve got to check his
text: lower left cuspid.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: He’s gotta go to the bathroom,
dialog: doctor.
speaker_heading: DR. SLOCUM
dialog: Fine.
text: Dale escorts the boy out.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Dale leads Gabe to the bathroom door.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Okay. Here you go.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: You have to come in and help me.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Help you? What do you mean?
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: You have to unbutton my pants.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I don’t think that’s a great idea,
dialog: Gabe.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Please! I have to go!
text: Dale looks around furtively.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Okay, come on.
dialog: (hustling him inside)
dialog: Quick, quick, come on.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM —- CONTINUOUS
text: Dale and Gabe enter. Dale locks the door behind them and
text: starts uncomfortably undoing Gabe’s pants.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (mumbling)
dialog: It’s just that I recently had
dialog: something expunged from my record.
dialog: It was a big misunderstanding.
dialog: Empty playground. No kids
dialog: anywhere. But I really shouldn’t
dialog: be doing this...
text: He gets the pants open and heads for the door.
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay. You’re good to go. I’1l
dialog: wait outside.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: No! You have to aim for me.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: What?! No one’s taught you how to
dialog: aim?
text: Gabe shakes his head.
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: What kind of parenting-- Is your
dialog: mom always at Target?
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: I’m gonna go in my pants!
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I’m gonna go to jail!
text: Gabe does a desperate pee pee dance.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Please! It hurts!
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Aw man. You’re really gonna make
dialog: me do this?
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: All right. Let’s get it over with.
text: Dale takes a latex glove from his dental scrubs and pulls it
text: on his hand. With his arm outstretched and looking the other
text: way, he helps Gabe aim (off-screen). We hear the sound of
text: peeing.
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: There you go.
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: This is not a good situation.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER
text: A mortified Dale leads Gabe back to the exam room. Dale
text: peels off his glove and tosses it in a bin.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Feel better?
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Yes. Thank you.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: You’re welcome.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Now, you don’t necessarily have to
dialog: tell your mom that I helped you
dialog: pee. It can be our secret.
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Not a secret. Just a fun thing
dialog: that we never tell anyone else.
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Not a fun thing. Just a secret.
scene_heading: INT. DR. SLOCUM’S OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER
text: Dale peers through the blinds and sees Gabe getting in a car
text: with his MOTHER.
dialog: 11.
text: The car pulls out of its parking spot and drives forward
text: fifty feet or so, then SCREECHES to a halt, SLAMS into
text: reverse and ZOOMS back into the parking lot.
text: Dale looks like he’s going to puke as Gabe’s mother exits the
text: car and marches toward the building.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Oh shit oh shit oh shit...
text: He hurries to the waiting room to head her off.
scene_heading: INT. WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Dale bursts through the door to find Gabe’s mother walking up
text: to the receptionist.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Let me expl--
speaker_heading: GABE’S MOTHER
dialog: (to Receptionist)
dialog: I completely forgot to schedule
text: Gabe’s next appointment.
text: Dale lets out an enormous sigh of relief.
speaker_heading: DALE (V.O.)
dialog: I guess if I’m being honest, this
dialog: job stresses the crap out of me.
dialog: I’m not so much a dental assistant
dialog: as a goddamn babysitter.
text: We FREEZE on Dale’s face as the words appear:
speaker_heading: GOD
speaker_heading: DAMN
speaker_heading: BABYSITTER
scene_heading: INT. UPSCALE HOTEL BAR - THAT NIGHT
text: Nick, Kurt and Dale sit at a table with drinks. Like Nick,
text: most of the PATRONS wear business attire. Many are older. A
text: PIANIST plays soft jazz in one corner.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: (to Dale)
dialog: What’s the deal with you and little
dialog: kids’ dicks?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: There weren't “dicks.” It was just
dialog: one. You make it sound like it was
dialog: a boys choir!
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I don’t know, Dale. I’m starting
dialog: to see a pattern here. I mean, if
dialog: I had been on the sex offender
dialog: registry, I'd try and avoid
dialog: handling kids’ private parts.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: (to Dale)
dialog: I don’t think I can be friends with
dialog: you anymore.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yeah, feels like two strikes is
dialog: enough.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: What was I supposed to do? Let the
dialog: kid piss in his pants?
speaker_heading: KURT/NICK
dialog: Yeah./Uh huh.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: You guys don’t get it. You’re not
dialog: fathers-to-be. You don’t have the
dialog: instinct to protect children.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: I have the instinct to protect them
dialog: from people like you.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Very funny.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: How’s Stacy feeling?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Pregnant. Very pregnant. I don’t
dialog: think the human body is designed to
text: carry three babies.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Are you grossed out by her body?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: No! Of course not. It’s
dialog: beautiful.
dialog: (off their looks)
dialog: It’s a little gross. She’s got
text: this weird line that runs down her
dialog: belly.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Yeesh. Not worth it, I say.
dialog: 13.
text: A WAITER sets down a fresh dish of olives, removing the old
text: dish full of pits. Dale eagerly begins eating the new ones.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Dale, that’s your fourth bowl of
text: olives.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I like olives.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Just because they keep bringing
dialog: them doesn’t mean you have to keep
text: wolfing them down.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: But I like ‘em.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: (to Nick)
dialog: What do you care?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: It’s embarrassing. This is a
dialog: classy place.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: It’s a bullshit place. I don’t
dialog: know why you drag us here all the
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Yeah, what was wrong with our old
dialog: bar?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: This is much nicer.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Hotel bars suck. The beer costs
dialog: ten bucks and the women are either
dialog: old or hookers I can’t afford.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: And that bathroom attendant expects
dialog: me to pay him for paper towels, so
dialog: I can’t even wash my hands.
text: Kurt and Nick grimace as Dale roots through the olive dish.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: (to Nick)
dialog: I know why you like this place.
dialog: You’re a fancypants.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What?
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Admit it. Since you became
dialog: president, you’ve gotten all fancy.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I’m not a fancypants.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Dale?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (to Nick)
dialog: You're a little fancy.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Fuck you guys.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Hey, hey. That’s not a very fancy
dialog: thing to say.
dialog: (then)
dialog: It’s just that lately you seem to
dialog: care a lot more about where you
dialog: drink, what you wear, what kind of
dialog: car you drive--
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: How many olives I eat.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Look, when you get to my position,
dialog: people expect certain things of
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: But you’re the boss. Doesn’t that
dialog: Mean you don’t have to care what
dialog: people think of you anymore?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: It’s more complicated than that.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Hey, as long as it’s making you
dialog: happy.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yeah.
text: We stay on NICK. It’s pretty clear that he is not happy.
text: From the hallway outside the bar, they suddenly hear MUSIC
text: blaring over a loudspeaker. It’s “I GOTTA FEELING” by The
text: Black Eyed Peas, accompanied by CHEERING from what sounds
text: like a decent-sized crowd.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: What’s going on out there?
text: They exchange a curious look.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Nick, Kurt and Dale open the door find a motivational seminar
text: in progress. An audience of around 100 PEOPLE sit in rows of
text: seats as the music BOOMS from a PA. On a riser at the front
text: of the room, an energetic 40-something man claps along to the
dialog: song.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Who is that?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: You don’t know who that is? That’s
dialog: Denny Paul.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: How do you know him?
speaker_heading: DALE
text: From his sign.
text: Dale points behind them to a sign featuring a headshot of
text: DENNY PAUL beneath the title “YOU DA BOSS!”
text: Denny picks up a mic as the music fades out.
speaker_heading: DENNY
dialog: Am I the only one who has a feeling
dialog: that tonight is gonna be a good,
dialog: good night?!
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Let's go.
text: Nick and Kurt start to go.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Wait. Let’s see what Denny has to
dialog: say.
speaker_heading: DENNY
dialog: Show of hands. Who here had a
dialog: vision when they were younger of
dialog: where they wanted their life to go?
text: Most of the crowd raises their hands.
speaker_heading: DENNY (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay. Now how many of you are
dialog: living that vision? Who here is
dialog: living their “vision life”?
dialog: 16.
text: Only a few hands go up. Denny “scans” the crowd.
speaker_heading: DENNY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hmm. I don’t see any hands. Oh
dialog: wait, here’s one. Boom.
text: He puts up his own hand and points at it.
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: DENNY (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s right. This guy with his
dialog: hand up? You know who he is?
dialog: He’s me. Just little old me.
dialog: Living my vision life. Wanna know
dialog: how I did it?
speaker_heading: NICK KURT
dialog: Don’t care.
speaker_heading: DENNY (CONT'D)
dialog: I grabbed the reins of the horse
dialog: that was my life and I slapped that
dialog: horse's ass and I made it ride
dialog: where I wanted it to ride. Not
dialog: down some shitty path that the
dialog: horse wanted to ride. Because
dialog: horses are idiots.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: He’s not wrong.
speaker_heading: DENNY
dialog: Here’s the deal, gang: the only
dialog: people who are truly happy in this
dialog: crazy world are the ones who don’t
dialog: have to answer to anybody. They’re
text: their own boss. They control their
dialog: destiny.
text: ANGLE ON Nick and Kurt who are actually listening now.
speaker_heading: DENNY (CONT'D)
dialog: See, I used to be just like you. A
dialog: drone. No self-respect. Working
dialog: for the man. Then I realized, I am
dialog: the man. I quit my job, left my
dialog: loveless marriage and started my
dialog: own business... helping other
dialog: people start their own business.
dialog: And here’s the kicker, folks. Last
dialog: year, I made in the very high five
dialog: figures. Guess what? Vision life.
text: Lovin’ it.
text: Denny drops the mic to the floor. The crowd applauds
text: appreciatively. After a moment, Denny picks up the mic
dialog: again.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: DENNY (CONT'D)
dialog: So let’s get into the fifteen
dialog: steps. Step one: take a good look
dialog: at yourself in the mirror, or any
text: reflective surface: a shiny pan, a
dialog: still puddle--
text: A HOTEL EMPLOYEE approaches the guys.
scene_heading: HOTEL EMPLOYEE
dialog: Excuse me, gentlemen, can I see
dialog: your tickets, please?
text: Nick, Kurt and Dale all shake their heads and wander out of
dialog: the ballroom.
scene_heading: INT. UPSCALE HOTEL BAR - LATER
text: The guys are back in the bar.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: All I’m saying is, Denny Paul has a
dialog: point. I thought that when I went
dialog: to work for Dr. Slocum I’d be
dialog: happier. But my job still kinda
dialog: sucks.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I hear you, Dale. I’m not exactly
dialog: living the dream either.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Seriously? Have you learned
dialog: nothing? You want to kill your
dialog: bosses again?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: What? No! I just mean, maybe the
dialog: problem wasn’t working for our old
dialog: bosses. Maybe the problem is
dialog: working for anyone.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: I don’t work for anyone.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You kinda do.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (to Kurt)
dialog: Mrs. Harken treats you like a
dialog: slave.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: You don’t have sex with a slave.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Thomas Jefferson did.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (noticing)
dialog: Hey, look.
text: ANGLE ON Denny Paul drinking a whisky at the bar.
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s Denny Paul.
dialog: (calling to him)
dialog: Denny! Mr. Paul!
dialog: (Denny looks over)
dialog: Can we buy you a drink?
text: Nick and Kurt grimace. Denny shrugs, downs his drink,
text: signals the bartender for another one, and ambles over to
text: them. He looks fairly drunk.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: DALE
text: Buying him a drink.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Doesn't really look like he needs
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: DENNY
dialog: (a bit slurred)
dialog: What’s up, guys?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: We really enjoyed your seminar--
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: We snuck in.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: And we left after five minutes.

speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: (sotto to Nick)
text: Alcoholic alert.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Look out.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I’m Dale. This is Nick and Kurt.
dialog: We were just talking about how
dialog: great it would be to be our own
dialog: bosses.
speaker_heading: DENNY
dialog: If talking was doing, a telephone
dialog: would be a hammer.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Not sure I get that.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: That’s only because it makes no
dialog: sense.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: How did you do it, Denny? Did you
dialog: follow your own fifteen steps?
text: Denny looks at them and considers for a beat.
speaker_heading: DENNY
dialog: Buy me another drink.
text: Dale signals the waiter.
speaker_heading: DENNY (CONT'D)
dialog: (leaning in)
dialog: You wanna know a secret? The
dialog: fifteen steps are bullshit.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Get out of town.
speaker_heading: DENNY
dialog: Yeah. I just made ‘em up. People
dialog: love steps. And they love being
dialog: told what to do.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: So, what do we do? Tell us?
speaker_heading: DENNY
dialog: You want to know how I started my
dialog: business?
text: He fumbles for his wallet, taking it out and handing them a
dialog: business card.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (reading)
dialog: International Venture Partners?
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: DENNY
dialog: Bingo. Venture capital. These
dialog: guys set me up with enough cash to
dialog: get “You Da Boss” off the ground.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: What’s the catch?
speaker_heading: DENNY
dialog: No catch. They take a 10 percent
dialog: ownership stake. They make money
dialog: when you make money. You just
dialog: gotta have a good enough idea.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: And “You Da Boss” was a good enough
dialog: idea?
speaker_heading: DENNY
dialog: Did you see that crowd tonight?
dialog: I’m a very charismatic guy.
text: Denny notices a WOMAN in a pencil skirt walk past.
speaker_heading: DENNY (CONT'D)
dialog: Excuse me. Are you a prostitute?
text: The guys look horrified.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DENNY
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: All right, guys. Good luck with...
dialog: whatever we were talking about.
text: He stumbles off with the prostitute. Kurt and Nick watch him
text: go, incredulous. Dale stares at the business card.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Hmm. A lot to think about.
scene_heading: INT. HARKEN’S HOUSE - LATER
text: Nick, Kurt and Dale enter from the front door.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Keep your voices down. I don’t

speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: It’s past your curfew, isn’t it?
dialog: They head
dialog: Relieved,
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: You want to get smacked?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: No.
text: into the living room.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (looking around nervously)
dialog: Does she still have that cat?
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: No. He ran away months ago.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Good.
text: Nick sits on the sofa. As he does, a CAT leaps
text: onto his shoulder from behind with a YOWL and darts away.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell?! You said he ran
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: That’s the new cat.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What, does she rescue them from a
dialog: haunted house?
text: Kurt pours drinks from a wet bar and they all sit. Dale sets
text: his drink on the table.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Dale! Use a coaster. That’s
dialog: bubinga wood.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (to Kurt)
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (holding up business card)
dialog: I think we should seriously
dialog: consider this venture capital
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: They don’t just hand you money,
dialog: Dale. You need to pitch them a
dialog: good business idea.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Like an invention?
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Could be.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: I’ve got a ton of ideas for
dialog: inventions.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (dubious)
dialog: Do you?
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: You know how your dick sticks to
dialog: your balls when it’s hot out?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Um...
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Picture this: underwear with
dialog: compartments that separate your
dialog: dick from your balls.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No one’s gonna fund that.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: When it’s hot out, they will.
dialog: We'll just pitch it on a hot day.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: That's a stupid idea.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It should be a non-stick spray for
dialog: your balls, like Pam.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Much better.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Wait, wait, I got one. Regular
text: sized condoms that are packaged in
dialog: Magnum condom wrappers. So the
dialog: girl you're with thinks you’ve got
dialog: a big dick.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Ooh, that just gave me an idea. A
text: condom in a spray can. It goes on
text: as a liquid, and then it hardens
text: into a solid.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: You're just taking my ideas and
text: putting them in spray cans.
dialog: (then)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: KURT (CONT'D)
dialog: And how are you supposed to remove
text: the rubber after it’s fused onto
dialog: your penis?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: It’ll come with an antidote spray.
dialog: Some kind of acid. That’s for our
dialog: lab guys to figure out.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (to Dale and Kurt)
dialog: Why do all of your inventions have
dialog: to do with dicks and balls?
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: I don’t know. Why were all of the
dialog: Wright Brothers’ ideas about
dialog: planes?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Maybe Nick’s right. Maybe we need
dialog: to focus more on vagina inventions.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: No, the key to a good invention is
dialog: that it solves some everyday
dialog: problem.
text: They sit there and think for a minute.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Okay, here’s an everyday problem:
dialog: showering. You gotta shampoo,
dialog: condition, lather up, rinse,
dialog: repeat. It takes forever.
text: There’s a beat.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: So what’s the invention?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I don’t know. I thought we were
dialog: just talking about problems.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I think I’m gonna go to bed.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: One sec. Dummy may be onto
dialog: something. It does seem like
text: showering is pretty inefficient.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Right? I bet the average person
dialog: loses a day every week just
dialog: showering.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (re: Dale’s math)
dialog: Feels wrong.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: What if there was some kind of a
dialog: showerhead that you fill with soap,
text: shampoo and conditioner and it
dialog: mixes it with the water?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Yeah! You could turn a dial to
dialog: choose what you want it to spray.
dialog: Like those Miracle-Gro things you
text: attach to a garden hose.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Right.
text: They turn to Nick for his reaction.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: It’s... not terrible. But I’m sure
dialog: it already exists.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HARKEN KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
text: The guys stand around a laptop computer. On the screen is
dialog: Google search for “showerhead with built-in soap.”
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Not finding it.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Try Bed, Bath & Beyond. They’ve
dialog: got everything.
text: Kurt does.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: So, should we call that venture
dialog: capital guy?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: It’s 2 in the morning, Dale. And
dialog: you don’t have a prototype or even
dialog: a name for this thing.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: How about... the Shower Buddy?
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: That sounds like a gay friend who
dialog: soaps up your back in the shower.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I don’t know why you go right to
dialog: “gay.”
dialog: (types on laptop)
dialog: Let’s see what comes up under
dialog: “Shower Buddy.”
text: They all cringe and recoil at what appears on screen.
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, that’s pretty gay. But it’s
dialog: not a product.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: It’s more of a... position.
text: Rhonda enters in a bathrobe.
speaker_heading: RHONDA
dialog: What’s going on in here?
text: Kurt hastily slams the laptop shut on Dale’s hand.
text: She shuts
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Ow!
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Just hanging out with the guys,
dialog: hon.
speaker_heading: RHONDA
dialog: Do you know what time it is? Some
dialog: of us have to work in the morning.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: You don’t work.
speaker_heading: RHONDA
dialog: I’ve got yoga at ten. And I don’t
dialog: appreciate the attitude. It’s time
dialog: to say goodnight to your friends.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: But--
text: him down with a look.
speaker_heading: KURT (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Nick and Kurt)
dialog: You guys better go.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: What about our Shower Buddy?
text: Rhonda looks confused. Kurt herds Nick and Dale toward the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Forget it, Dale. It’s silly.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I don’t think it’s silly. I think
dialog: it could be the key to our vision
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: NICK
text: Goodnight, Kurt. Rhonda.
text: Nick and Dale exit. Rhonda heads for the stairs.
speaker_heading: RHONDA
dialog: Let’s go. Upstairs. My pussy’s
dialog: not going to eat itself.
text: Kurt sighs, then slumps out after her.

text: BUMPER STICKER has been stuck to his rear bumper that reads:
dialog: “My Other Car is a Porsche”
text: Nick tries to peel it off, but only part of the top layer
text: comes off. Pissed, he looks around and notices his fellow
text: PRESIDENTS watching from a window and laughing their asses
text: off at him.
scene_heading: INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY
text: Kurt stands at the checkout counter as a CUTE FEMALE CASHIER
text: rings up his purchases. He gives her a flirty smile which
text: she returns... until she sees what he’s buying: Secret
text: deodorant, Oil of Olay, and an enormous value pack of
dialog: tampons.
text: He hands her a credit card. INSERT the card: it belong to
text: Rhonda Harken and has her photo on it.
text: The cashier looks at him dubiously. Kurt shrugs sheepishly.

scene_heading: INT. DR. SLOCUM’S EXAM ROOM - DAY

text: has fallen asleep and the dental chair is empty.
text: He looks around frantically and gasps when he spots the
text: PATIENT, a five year-old girl, who has climbed halfway out
text: the window. Dale hurries over to rescue her.
scene_heading: EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - LATER
text: Dale’s car pulls up to a sleek, modern building.
scene_heading: INT. DALE'S CAR —- CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: INT. MR. NAGOPIAN’S OFFICE - LATER
text: Dale sits on a couch in a well-appointed office and finishes
text: his pitch to someone offscreen. Beside him stands an easel
text: with his Shower Buddy sketch tacked to it.
speaker_heading: DALE
text: The Shower Buddy eliminates the
dialog: endless cycle of washing and
text: rinsing and washing and rinsing.
dialog: It’s not just a time saver. It’s a
dialog: life saver. My team is ready to
dialog: move on this with or without your
dialog: help. But the only way we can do
dialog: that is with your help.
text: REVERSE ON ALEX NAGOPIAN, 40's, well dressed, confident and
text: slightly intimidating (think Liam Neeson). Beside him sits
text: JOYCE, 30's, an attractive colleague. Nagopian considers
text: Dale's pitch for a beat.
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: You're a funny little man, Dale.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Go on.
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: As far as your idea, this “Shower
dialog: Buddy”?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I love it.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Seriously?!
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: Yes. It’s smart, it fills a niche.
dialog: What do you think, Joyce?
speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: Sounds like the kind of product we
dialog: like to fund.
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: Of course, our due diligence people
dialog: will have to make sure no one else
dialog: has done it.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Well, we googled it and didn’t find
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: I see. And why aren’t your
dialog: partners here with you?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: They’re very busy men. We all are.
dialog: Very busy. Men.
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: But you have power of attorney to
dialog: sign on their behalf?
text: Dale stares at him for a beat.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: ...yes.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Does this mean we’re in business?
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: That depends. How much do you need
dialog: to get the Shower Buddy off the
dialog: ground?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Do you have a piece of paper?
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: So I can write down the amount and
dialog: slide it across the table to you.
text: Nagopian looks mildly annoyed. He nods to Joyce, who tears a
text: piece of paper off a pad and hands it to Dale.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: Great. Thanks. I’ve always wanted
dialog: to do this.
text: Dale scribbles on the paper and slides it across the coffee
text: table. Nagopian looks at it.
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: I can’t read this. Is this a “2"?
speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: (leaning in)
dialog: Looks like a “G.”
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: No, that’s a “9.”
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: Then I don’t understand this
dialog: number. You have two commas next
text: to each other.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: No, no, that’s not a comma. That’s
dialog: also a nine-- you know what? Let
dialog: me write it again--
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: Why don’t you just say the number?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (tentatively)
dialog: Nine hundred ninety-nine thousand,
dialog: nine-hundred, ninety nine dollars?
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: Why not an even million?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: It sounds like less?
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: This isn’t the Radio Shack. A
dialog: million is fine.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (floored)
dialog: Fuck me.
dialog: (then, covering)
dialog: Wonderful.
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: Joyce here will bring you to our
dialog: legal department to sign the
dialog: necessary paperwork.

speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Congratulations, Dale. We look
dialog: forward to a long and profitable
dialog: relationship with you and your
dialog: Shower Buddy.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That name? Is it a little gay?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: Fair enough.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER
text: Dale sits at a desk in another room as Joyce places a large
text: stack of documents in front of him.
speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: All you have to do is sign on the

dialog: partners.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Not so fast. If there’s one thing
dialog: I know about business: you never
dialog: sign anything without reading it
dialog: carefully.
speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: Take your time.
text: She sits down as Dale begins to read the first page.
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - TWO MINUTES LATER
text: Two pages into the stack, Dale is BORED OUT OF HIS MIND and

speaker_heading: DALE

scene_heading: EXT. BURGER JOINT - DAY
text: Nick, dressed for work, joins Dale, still in his suit, and

dialog: What’s going on?
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: He wouldn’t tell me anything till
dialog: you got here.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: This isn’t something I could tell
dialog: you over the phone.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Why are you wearing your church
dialog: clothes?
text: Kurt and Nick exchange a grave look.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Is it your unborn babies?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Oh, Dale. I’m so sorry. How’s
dialog: Stacy doing?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: She's fine! The babies are fine!
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Well, why did you scare us like
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I didn’t scare anybody! You're
dialog: scaring me.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: So you dragged us out here to tell
dialog: us your babies are fine?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: No! This has nothing to do with my
dialog: babies! You’re ruining this!
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Ruining what?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: This!

dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What-- what are we looking at here,
dialog: Dale?
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Is that one of those Publishers
dialog: Clearinghouse checks?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: No. It’s a real check. From the
dialog: venture capital place Denny Paul
dialog: used. I pitched them the Shower
dialog: Buddy and they loved it!
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: They loved the Shower Buddy?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: They said it filled a niche.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Let me see that.
text: He grabs the check and examines it.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Why would you do this without
dialog: telling us?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Because I knew you didn’t believe
dialog: in the Buddy like I did.
text: Nick gets up.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Come on.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Where are you going?
text: Nick points across the street at a bank.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I’m gonna see if this thing is
dialog: real.
text: Dale scurries after him. Kurt grabs his burger and follows.
scene_heading: INT. BANK —- MINUTES LATER
text: Nick, Kurt and Dale huddle around the window of a BANK TELLER

speaker_heading: BANK TELLER
dialog: Would you like this deposited to
dialog: separate or joint accounts?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: So it’s real?
speaker_heading: BANK TELLER
dialog: Um, yes it is.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Fuck me.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Told you!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (to Teller)
dialog: Can I have that back, please?
text: Nick takes the check and the three move away.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Dale)
dialog: You need to return this.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Whoa, whoa. Hang on.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No one hands you a million dollars
dialog: without there being a catch. This
dialog: is too good to be true.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: What if it’s too good to be not
dialog: true? Shouldn’t we at least
dialog: consider it?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (checks watch)
dialog: I’m going to be late for work.
text: He turns to go but Kurt stops him.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: So what? So you’re late for work.
dialog: You're late for being miserable.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I'm sorry?
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: You hate working at that place.
dialog: You've always hated it. Why keep
dialog: doing something that makes you
dialog: unhappy?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Yeah, Nick. This could be a whole
dialog: new start.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: If I quit, the ten years of hard
dialog: work I put in at Comndiyne will
dialog: have been for nothing.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: It was always for nothing. What do
dialog: you think is going to happen? On

dialog: gonna come in, thank you for giving
dialog: up your entire life and escort you
dialog: to corporate heaven?
speaker_heading: NICK
text: There is no Mr. Comnidyne.
speaker_heading: KURT

dialog: afraid to do something better.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Touché.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: This coming from the guy who lives

speaker_heading: NICK KURT

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: GLEN

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: How about Nick’s Boxster?
text: They laugh.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I quit.
text: They all look at him for a beat. Is he joking?
speaker_heading: JEANINE
dialog: What?
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yeah. I can’t do this anymore.
text: He starts to gather his things in his briefcase.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: With all due respect, guys, I just
dialog: don’t respect any of you. And I
dialog: really don’t want to turn into you.
text: He suddenly stops loading his case.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: What am I doing? I don’t need any

speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: “Shower buddy”?
speaker_heading: JEANINE

dialog: with a white one because you don’t
dialog: want to feel racist?
speaker_heading: RHONDA
dialog: (matter of fact)
dialog: Uh huh.
text: The dragging sound gets louder and the women look up to see
text: the BUBINGA WOOD COFFEE TABLE emerge from the house, being
text: shoved outside by Kurt.
speaker_heading: RHONDA (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell? Kurt, what are you
dialog: doing?
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: (grunting from effort)
dialog: I thought of a great spot for this
text: bubinga wood table.
text: He gives the table a final push RIGHT INTO THE POOL. The
text: water splashes Rhonda and her friends who gasp in disbelief.
speaker_heading: RHONDA
dialog: Are you insane?!
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: That's right. I’m sorry. I forgot
dialog: the coaster.
text: He takes a coaster from his pocket and tosses it into the
dialog: pool.
speaker_heading: KURT (CONT'D)
text: (nodding to Nikki and
dialog: Heidi)
dialog: Ladies.
text: And with that, Kurt turns, smiles and goes.

scene_heading: STARTING THE BUSINESS MONTAGE
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
text: Nick, Kurt and Dale stand with a REALTOR in the large, empty
text: space. Looking pleased, Nick and Kurt shake the Realtor’s
text: hand. Dale goes in for a hug. The Realtor looks
dialog: uncomfortable.
text: We go into a TIME LAPSE sequence as the warehouse is
text: transformed into a production/office space with manufacturing
dialog: equipment.
scene_heading: EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
text: The guys watch as a WORKER on a cherrypicker installs a sign
text: that reads NICKURDALE INDUSTRIES -- Home of the “Shower
text: Buddy"! Nick and Kurt shake hands. Dale goes in for a hug.
scene_heading: INT. CONSUMER PRODUCTS TESTING LAB - DAY
text: The three guys stand with a LAB TECH observing a male TEST
text: SUBJECT in a bathing suit trying out prototypes of the Shower
text: Buddy in a glass shower stall.
text: QUICK SERIES OF POPS as the prototypes malfunction:
text: -- The pressure builds up in the shower head and bursts in
text: the subject’s face.
text: -- The subject, now a bit more nervous, turns on the water
text: and nothing but soap oozes from the shower head.
text: -- The shower head sprays the perfect combination of water
text: and soap. Our guys look pleased until the shower head
text: inexplicably stops spraying. The subject cautiously inspects
text: the device and suddenly the shower head bursts in his face
dialog: again.
dialog: 39.
dialog: -- Our guys follow the bruised and pissed off subject to his
text: car, apologizing profusely. They manage to convince him to
dialog: go back into the building.
text: -- Fearing for his life, the same subject gingerly turns on
text: the shower which has a new model Shower Buddy installed.
text: This time it actually works as it should. Nick and Kurt high-
text: five. In the test chamber we see Dale yank open the shower
text: stall and hug the subject.
scene_heading: INT. NICKURDALE OFFICE - DAY
text: The guys shake hands and say goodbye to a SEXY YOUNG WOMAN
text: they've just finished interviewing. She hands over her
text: resumé and goes. Nick and Dale shake their heads,
text: unimpressed. Kurt, on the other hand, gives them an
text: enthusiastic thumbs up.
scene_heading: INT. NICKURDALE OFFICE - DAY
text: The guys shake hands and say goodbye to an average-looking
text: MIDDLE AGED WOMAN they’ve just finished interviewing. Nick
text: and Dale nod approvingly. Kurt gives them a thumbs down and
text: tears up her resumé.
scene_heading: INT. NICKURDALE OFFICE - DAY
text: The guys shake hands and say goodbye to an EXTREMELY HANDSOME
text: MAN they’ve just finished interviewing. The guys all look at
text: each other self-consciously. No one is sure how to react.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
text: The guys stand at the end of a production line manned by
text: about a dozen WORKERS as the very first consumer-ready Shower
text: Buddy rolls off the line. Nick, Kurt and Dale proudly hold
text: the device up as a PHOTOGRAPH is taken.
text: FREEZE on the image. PULL BACK to see the picture is on the
text: cover of “FORTUNE” Magazine. Then PULL BACK further to see
text: the cover is on Dale’s laptop screen. Dale is showing Nick
text: and Kurt what he Photoshopped. He gives them a look:
text: “wouldn't that be cool?” They shake their heads at him.
scene_heading: EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY
text: The guys smoke cigars as they cruise down the fairway in a
text: golf cart, enjoying a mid-week outing.
text: In QUICK POPS we see Nick, Kurt and Dale each tee off.
dialog: 40.
text: Then three more QUICK POPS as each tries to recover their
text: ball, still smoking their cigars:
text: Nick uses his club to try and knock his ball down from a tree
text: where it’s wedged.
text: Nick and Dale hold onto Kurt’s belt as he leans over a pond
text: searching for his ball.
text: Dale knocks on the door of a house. A pissed off GUY opens
text: the door and hands him his golf ball. WIDEN to reveal a golf
text: ball-sized hole in one window of the house. Dale smiles
text: sheepishly, takes the ball and hurries away.
scene_heading: INT. KURT’S LOFT - DAY
text: Kurt shows Nick and Dale around his new apartment. Moving
text: boxes are scattered around, but it’s a cool pad. A DOG
text: follows them around. Just then, the Sexy Young Woman they
text: interviewed comes out of the bedroom in one of Kurt’s shirts.
text: Nick and Dale give Kurt a disapproving look.
scene_heading: EXT. DALE’S HOUSE - DAY
text: Covering Stacy’s eyes, Dale leads her outside to surprise her
text: with a brand new minivan wrapped in a bow in the driveway.
text: He presses a button on the remote and the side door opens,
text: revealing two car seats installed in the back seat and one in
text: the front passenger seat. Stacy kisses him... then points to
text: the car seat in the front and shakes her head.
scene_heading: EXT. SAILBOAT - DAY
text: CLOSE ON our three guys toasting themselves with glasses of
text: champagne on the deck of a rented 40-foot sailboat. Wind in
text: their hair, white linen pants, etc. Suddenly, they are
text: violently jolted to the side.
text: PULL BACK to show their boat is in the harbor and has DRIFTED
text: sideways into another docked sailboat. Their sails are in
text: disarray-- clearly none of them knows the first thing about
text: sailing. Panicked, Dale begins winching a line which only
text: TEARS the mainsail down the middle. Kurt and Nick step onto
text: the dock and head off, leaving Dale to deal with the mess.
speaker_heading: END OF MONTAGE
scene_heading: INT. NICKURDALE CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING
text: The guys sit with GREG and NANCY, the handsome guy and middle-
dialog: aged woman they interviewed earlier.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Nancy, how we doing on our
dialog: production quota?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Solid. We’ve got five thousand
dialog: units in inventory.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Good. Greg, how are things on the
dialog: marketing front?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I’m talking to my contacts at QVC,
dialog: HSN and Amazon. There’s a lot of
dialog: interest.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Nice. Dale, can I get a refill?
text: Nick holds up his empty coffee mug.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: You bet!
text: Dale crosses to a coffee pot and refills Nick’s cup.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Kurt, how are sales?
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Well, we haven’t sold a single unit
dialog: yet, so sales are... non-existent.
dialog: But here’s the thing: it takes time
dialog: to build awareness. The only thing
text: standing between us and a multi-
dialog: million dollar success story is one
dialog: giant distributor. Like, say,
dialog: SkyMall.
text: Kurt slaps a SkyMall catalogue down on the table.
speaker_heading: KURT (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe you've heard of it. Reaches
dialog: six hundred fifty million airline
dialog: passengers a year.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yeah? So? Did you call them or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Nope. They called us. They’re
text: interested in the Shower Buddy and
dialog: want to meet with us later today
dialog: about putting it in their fall
dialog: catalogue.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Booyah!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: That’s great news.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: It’s better than great. Skymall
dialog: made household names out of the
dialog: Marshmallow Shooter, the Old Time
dialog: Popcorn Cart, the Pet Ramp. They
dialog: put the “world’s largest wall map”
dialog: on the map!
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Stacy and I got one of those Pet
dialog: Ramps for Darvis when he couldn't
text: jump onto the bed anymore.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: That dog reeks of shit. You let
dialog: him in your bed?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Of course. We love Darvis.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: If you love him, why don’t you give
dialog: him a bath once in a while?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Dogs don’t need baths. They’re
text: self-cleaning.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: That’s cats.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Ugh. I hate the smell of cats.
text: ANGLE ON Greg and Nancy, who exchange a look that says, “Who
dialog: the hell are we working for?”
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (to Greg and Nancy)
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: (then)
dialog: If the Skymall people are coming,
dialog: we've got to get ready for that
dialog: pitch. I’11 work up a
dialog: presentation. Kurt, why don’t you
dialog: set up the demo in here? Dale,
dialog: we're gonna need a lot more coffee.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I’m on it.
dialog: 43.
text: We follow Nick as he heads out into
scene_heading: INT. NICKURDALE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Nick crosses a second floor walkway that overlooks the modest
text: assembly line below. He passes an UNDERLING.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Hey, Tim. Did you get that
dialog: shipment in yet?
speaker_heading: TIM
text: Yep. A bunch of pens and stress
dialog: reliever balls with the company
text: name on it.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Perfect. Keep up the good work.
text: Nick heads into an office with a sign on the door that reads:
scene_heading: “NICK HENDRICKS, CO-CEO”
scene_heading: INT. NICK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Nick crosses to his desk, but before he gets there he’s
text: startled by a voice.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Nice suit.
text: Nick whirls around to see Mr. Nagopian sitting on the sofa.
text: Off to the side stands a LARGE MAN in a suit.
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: You’re much better dressed than
dialog: your “co-CEO” Dale.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Thank you. And you are...?
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: Alex Nagopian. International
dialog: Venture Partners.
text: He stands and shakes Nick’s hand.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Oh. Right. It’s nice to finally
dialog: meet you.
text: Nick nods at the big guy in the corner.
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: This is my associate, Ghoukas.
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Hi... Ghoukas.
dialog: (then, to Nagopian)
dialog: Thank you for believing in what
dialog: we're doing here.
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: Believing is my business. And how
dialog: is business?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: So far, so good. We've got a big
dialog: pitch lined up. Could be great for-
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: Good, good. Well, we’re not here
dialog: to get in the way. We just came by
dialog: to remind you that your repayment
dialog: is due tomorrow.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Re-what, now?
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: Your repayment. Didn’t Dale
dialog: explain to you the terms of our
dialog: loan?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Loan? You made a capital
dialog: investment. Didn’t you take a ten
dialog: percent stake in the company?
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: Why would I want ten percent of
dialog: “the Shower Friend?”
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Shower Buddy.
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: Friend, Buddy. It’s a stupid idea.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Then why did you invest in it?
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: I didn’t. I simply loaned you and
dialog: your friends a million dollars for
dialog: a month. And tomorrow, you owe me
dialog: two million dollars.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I think there’s been a
dialog: misunderstanding--
dialog: (pushing his intercom)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Jennifer, can you get Dale and Kurt
dialog: in here, please?
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: It’s all in the paperwork Dale
dialog: signed on your behalf.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: So what is this? Some kind of
dialog: scam?
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: A scam? No one forced you to
dialog: borrow a million dollars from us.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: There’s no way we can make a
dialog: payment like that by tomorrow. The
dialog: money you gave us is all invested
dialog: in the company.
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: In that case, I wouldn’t be
dialog: surprised if something unpleasant
dialog: happened to you and your friends.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Are you threatening us?
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: Of course not. I’ve just noticed
dialog: that the people who fail to repay
dialog: me tend to have accidents. And
dialog: strangely, Ghoukas is often the one
text: who finds them.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: That’s a threat!
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: It’s not. Have some sympathy for
dialog: poor Ghoukas. He’s the one who’s
dialog: always finding these horribly
text: disfigured bodies.
speaker_heading: GHOUKAS
dialog: I kill them.
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: Ghoukas! We’re doing a conceit.
text: Ghoukas shrugs.
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: All I’m saying is, if you fail to
dialog: repay me by tomorrow, something
dialog: terrible may or may not happen to
dialog: you and your friends.
speaker_heading: GHOUKAS
dialog: I'll kill you.
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: Ghoukas!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: All right, you know what? This is
dialog: the stupidest shakedown ever. If
dialog: we die, how are we going to pay you
dialog: back?
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: From the life insurance policies
dialog: Dale signed.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: He didn’t say anything about life
dialog: insurance policies.
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: That's probably because he didn’t
dialog: read them.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Fuuuuck.
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: Don’t worry, Nick. One way or the
dialog: other, I’ll get my money.
text: He pats Nick on the cheek and starts to exit. Ghoukas heads
text: out right on his heels.
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ghoukas, please. You don’t have to
dialog: walk that close.
text: Ghoukas stops walking. Nagopian exits. Ghoukas stands
text: there, unsure what to do.
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Now you’re too far!
text: Ghoukas heads out.
text: Nick slumps in his chair and distractedly grabs a Nickurdale
text: stress reliever ball. He squeezes the hell out of it for a
dialog: beat.
text: Dale and Kurt enter.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Hey, was that Mr. Nagopian I saw
dialog: leaving? Why wouldn’t he say hi?
dialog: That’s weird--
text: In the blink of an eye, Nick grabs Dale and slaps him across
text: the face.
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: ow!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You fucking idiot!
text: Kurt steps between them.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Hey, hey. What’s all this?
text: Nick reaches past Kurt and smacks Dale again.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Ow!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You killed us! We’re all dead
dialog: thanks to you!
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: What did I do?!
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: What did he do?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Nagopian? That “venture capital”
dialog: guy he got our money from? He’s
dialog: nothing but a loanshark! Dale
dialog: signed papers saying that tomorrow
dialog: we owe him two million bucks backed
dialog: up with life insurance policies.
dialog: If we don’t pay, we die.
text: Kurt turns to Dale and looks at him for a moment. Then he
text: also smacks him across the face.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Ow!
text: Nick slaps Dale again.
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop it! How was I supposed to
dialog: know? There was so much to read!
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: You goddamn moron.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I knew I shouldn’t have listened to
dialog: you guys. I gave up my career for
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: You're worried about your career?
dialog: What about our lives? Did this
dialog: Nagopian actually threaten you?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Basically. Ghoukas definitely did.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: What’s a Ghoukas?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: We should go to the cops.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: And tell them what? That Nagopian
dialog: handed us perfectly legal loan
dialog: documents which you forged our
dialog: signatures on? All that does is
dialog: send you to prison.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: It does?
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: I’m fine with that.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Hang on.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I’m fine with it, too. But as far
dialog: as Nagopian’s concerned, we still
dialog: stole a million dollars from him.
dialog: You don’t think Ghoukas is going to
dialog: kill us?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: What’s a Ghoukas?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (to Kurt)
dialog: If we liquidated everything right
dialog: now, how much cash would we have?
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: About three hundred grand.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: That means we have three days to
dialog: come up with 1.7 million dollars.
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: So, basically, we're riding a cat
text: without a candle.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What? What is that?
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: It’s a saying. It means we're
dialog: fucked.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I think I’ve heard that.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No, you haven't.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: It’s a common expression. It’s
dialog: from the olden days.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: It’s from the no days. Why would
dialog: you ride a cat? And why would a
dialog: candle help?
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: I don’t know. I didn’t come up
dialog: with it.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I think you did.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Guys, please. The longer we fight,
dialog: the more we're riding a cat without
dialog: a candle!
text: Nick’s assistant, JENNIFER, pops her head in.
dialog: She goes.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Guys? The SkyMall people said
text: they’re on their way.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Shit, that’s right!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Hang on. This could be a good
dialog: thing. If we sell these guys on
dialog: the Buddy, we could get enough up-
dialog: front money to pay off Nagopian.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: So, we've just gotta nail this
dialog: pitch.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Or we die. No pressure.
text: The guys exchange tense looks.
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. NICKURDALE CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
text: Nick, Kurt and Dale are mid-pitch. They look FRAZZLED and
text: SWEATY as they stand across from two seated SkyMall reps, DAN
text: and CLAIRE, 40's.
text: Behind the guys is a large schematic drawing on an easel
text: along with a PORTABLE SHOWER STALL with a Shower Buddy
dialog: attached.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (rapid-fire, manic)
dialog: ...there’s a reason everybody hates
dialog: showers because it takes so long
dialog: and the average person wastes one
dialog: week every month taking showers--
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Well, maybe not a week--
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: It’s all the soaping up and the
text: rinsing off and the shampooing and
dialog: the rinsing off and the
dialog: conditioning and the rinsing off--
speaker_heading: KURT NICK
dialog: What Dale is trying to say Dale means that we waste a
dialog: is, the Shower Buddy lot of time showering and the
dialog: eliminates the wasted time Shower Buddy helps to
dialog: and streamlines your shower streamline that process.
dialog: process.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Sounds great. How does it work?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: That’s an excellent question,
dialog: Claire.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Great question.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Really good.
dialog: 51.
text: There’s an awkward silence.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: .---So, how does it work?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Right--
dialog: (to Kurt)
dialog: You wanna get her in here?
text: Kurt hurries out.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: We thought the best way to show you
dialog: how the Shower Buddy works is to
dialog: show... you... how the Shower Buddy
dialog: works.
text: Dale crosses to the shower stall and begins fiddling with a
text: portable water pump attached to a tank.
text: Kurt ushers in a 20-something model, BROOKE, in a bathrobe.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: (to Brooke)
dialog: Hurry, hurry.
dialog: (to Dan and Claire)
dialog: This is Brooke. She’s gonna
dialog: demonstrate the Shower Buddy for
dialog: you by taking a shower. Brooke?
text: Brooke drops her robe. She’s in a bikini.
speaker_heading: KURT (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry, Dan. I know you were hoping
text: she was naked under there.
dialog: (to Claire)
dialog: Don’t tell his wife.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I am his wife.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: (covering)
dialog: I know. Husband and wife. Working
dialog: together. You’re like Lucy and
dialog: Desi. Only at SkyMall. Nice.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: This fucking pump...
text: Brooke steps into the stall.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: How we doin’, Dale?
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I think there’s something wrong
dialog: with the motor on this pump. But I
dialog: can do it by hand. No biggie.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: (nudging Claire and Dan)
dialog: Our next invention’s gonna be a
dialog: better water pump. Right, husband
dialog: and wife?
text: Dale kneels beside the stall and begins rhythmically jerking
text: the water pump.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Might take a second here to get the
dialog: flow going...
text: Brooke stands awkwardly in the dry shower.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (to Claire and Dan)
dialog: Shouldn’t be long.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (pumping away)
text: Getting close. Almost there.
text: There’s an uncomfortable beat as they all watch Dale.
text: There’s no getting around how much it looks like he’s jerking
text: off on his knees beside a woman in a shower.
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: Close your eyes, Brooke. Here it
dialog: comes!
text: Just then, a GOB OF LIQUID SOAP dribbles out of the Shower
text: Buddy, landing on Brooke’s face.
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes!
text: The model does her best to work with the limited amount of
text: water dribbling on her. She spreads the soap on her chest.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: (whispering to Nick)
dialog: Kinda looks like--
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: I know.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Dale, can we get any more water
dialog: pressure here?
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (winded)
dialog: I’m pumping as hard as I can!
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: All right, let me help.
text: Kurt joins Dale and the two of them begin working the pump
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (to Dan and Claire)
dialog: Okay, well, obviously, this isn’t
dialog: the best demonstration. With
dialog: normal water pressure, there’s a
dialog: steady stream of soap delivered--
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Ow! It got in my eyes!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Twist the nozzle to “rinse.”
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I can’t see.
text: She fumbles with the showerhead.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: All right, let me help you.
text: Nick reaches into the stall and tries to adjust the
text: showerhead.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Ugh, it got in my mouth.
text: Creamy soap runs down his and Brooke’s arms, as Dale and
text: Kurt, on their knees and dripping with flop sweat, continue
text: to pump away.
text: ANGLE ON DAN and CLAIRE who look appalled.
speaker_heading: DALE (0.S.)
dialog: Not so hard, Kurt, you’re hurting
dialog: me!
scene_heading: EXT. NICKURDALE WAREHOUSE - SHORT TIME LATER
text: Drenched and disheveled from the demonstration, the guys wave
text: goodbye as Dan and Claire’s car drives away.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Goodbye!
dialog: There’s a
dialog: They give
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Take care now!
dialog: beat.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: So, when do you think we’ll find
dialog: out?
text: him a withering look.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: That was awful. It felt like we
dialog: were fucking each other for crack.
speaker_heading: NICK
text: I’m covered in soap, but I feel so
dialog: dirty.
dialog: (then)
dialog: That goddamned Shower Buddy.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Don’t blame the Buddy. The Buddy
dialog: works. It just needed to be ina
dialog: real shower.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Well, that was our only shot.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: (to Dale)
dialog: You know, none of this would’ve
dialog: happened if you hadn’t bought that
text: dipshit Denny Paul a drink.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Oh yeah. How come Denny didn’t get
dialog: killed? He borrowed from Nagopian
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: And why would he refer us to him if
dialog: he knew he was a loan shark?
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Let’s call that fucker and find
dialog: out.
scene_heading: INT. KURT’S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER
text: The guys sit around Kurt’s desk. Denny Paul is on the
text: speaker phone.
speaker_heading: DENNY (0.S.)
dialog: How did you find me?

speaker_heading: DENNY

speaker_heading: DALE

speaker_heading: DENNY

speaker_heading: KURT

speaker_heading: DENNY
dialog: Is this a secure line?

speaker_heading: DENNY

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: DENNY
dialog: All right. Look, Nagopian is a
dialog: loan shark--
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: We know that!
speaker_heading: DENNY
dialog: I've barely been making my
dialog: payments. Every dime I earn goes
dialog: straight to him. I thought if I
dialog: brought him some fresh meat he'd
dialog: cut me some slack.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Fresh meat?
speaker_heading: DENNY
dialog: I’m sorry I dragged you into this.
dialog: But hey, maybe if we work together,
dialog: we can fix it.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: DENNY
dialog: Neither of us alone has enough

speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: DENNY

speaker_heading: DALE

speaker_heading: KURT

speaker_heading: KURT

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: KURT

speaker_heading: DALE

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What?!

speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Dale, your shoulder!
text: A FLESHY MOUND of some sort has landed on Dale’s shoulder.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (still deaf)
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: KURT

dialog: Aw, shit. Not you clowns again.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Detective. We know who did this.
speaker_heading: HAGAN
dialog: What do you mean, you know who did
dialog: this? Fire department says it was
text: an accidental gas leak.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: It was no accident.
speaker_heading: HAGAN
dialog: Is that right? How come every time
text: someone dies in front of their
dialog: house, you assholes aren’t far
dialog: away?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Just hear us out. We were coming

speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: We got venture capital from him and

speaker_heading: HAGAN
dialog: What the hell did you need venture

speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: For our Shower Buddy.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: (off Hagan’s confusion)
text: It’s an adjustable showerhead that

speaker_heading: HAGAN

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: HAGAN
dialog: Yeah, you need to change that

speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: We’re not going to have a company,
dialog: or our lives, if you don’t help us
dialog: take down Nagopian.
speaker_heading: HAGAN
dialog: Nagopian?
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Yeah. Alex Nagopian. He’s the guy
dialog: we borrowed money from.
speaker_heading: HAGAN
dialog: Get outta here.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What? You know him?
speaker_heading: HAGAN
dialog: We’ve been watching him for years.
dialog: The Feds think he’s the head of
dialog: Armenian Power.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: What’s Armenian Power?
speaker_heading: HAGAN
dialog: It’s the Armenian mob.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: That’s great. That’s perfect. We
text: borrowed money from a mob boss.
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: (to Hagan)
dialog: Hang on. If you know he’s a
dialog: criminal, why don’t you arrest him?
speaker_heading: HAGAN
dialog: Nagopian’s smart. He keeps himself
dialog: insulated from the shit his gang
dialog: does. And as far as we can tell,
dialog: this here was just an accident.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: And what happens on Monday when the
dialog: three of us also die in accidents?
speaker_heading: HAGAN
dialog: Well, then I’ll have a case.
speaker_heading: DALE

speaker_heading: DALE

speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: You're not Nagopian.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: No... Are you my five o’clock?
speaker_heading: HAGAN
dialog: (to the guys)
dialog: You're telling me you dragged me
text: clear across town to visit some

speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: We also have salads and flatbreads.
speaker_heading: HAGAN
dialog: This is some bullshit.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (to Tim)
dialog: How long have you been in this

speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Since the building opened last

speaker_heading: HAGAN

scene_heading: EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER
text: It’s dark now and it’s begun to drizzle as Hagan crosses to
text: his car with the guys on his heels.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Detective, if you go, we’re as good
dialog: as dead.
speaker_heading: HAGAN
dialog: Since I’ve known you three, nothing
dialog: you've told me has been true. Why
dialog: would I listen to you now?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Can’t you at least give us some
dialog: police protection?
speaker_heading: HAGAN
dialog: Protection from what? Your own
dialog: foolishness?
text: Hagan climbs into his car.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: So you're just going to drive away

speaker_heading: HAGAN
dialog: The hell you say?
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: It’s an expression.
speaker_heading: HAGAN
dialog: No it isn’t.
text: Hagan slams the door and drives off.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I don’t understand. If Quiznos was

dialog: Nagopian’s office there?
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I know how. Quiznos is in on this.
dialog: I didn’t see a single sandwich up
dialog: there. And who puts a Quiznos on

dialog: building--?
text: Kurt puts a hand over Dale’s mouth and keeps it there.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: (to Nick)
dialog: What do we do now?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Let’s figure it out in the car.
dialog: There’s no point standing out here
text: in the rain.
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KURT’S CAR - MINUTES LATER
text: Kurt drives. Nick is up front and Dale in the back. Without
text: the benefit of a windshield or a sunroof, WIND-DRIVEN RAIN
text: soaks the guys as they drive. Kurt shields his eyes with his
text: hand so he can see. They yell over the wind.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Glad we got out of the rain!
text: The windshield wipers flop ridiculously across the dashboard.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Maybe we should all stay together
dialog: tonight! Might be safer!
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Good idea! But not my place! I
dialog: don’t want my pregnant wife to get

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Kurt, your apartment is probably
dialog: the most secure!
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Okay, we can--
text: Just then, a wet PLASTIC BAG flies through the open

scene_heading: INT. PARKING GARAGE - LATER

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: It’s good that you locked it.
text: They head for the stairs to Kurt’s loft.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: We've got to establish a secure

dialog: traps, an early warning system...
dialog: I’m going to need twine, small
dialog: bells, thumb tacks, mousetraps--
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Calm down, Macaulay Culkin. I've
dialog: got an alarm system.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I guess that’1l work.
scene_heading: INT. KURT’S LOFT - MOMENTS LATER
text: The door to Kurt’s loft opens and the guys enter.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: So what exactly will we do if they
dialog: show up?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: We'll figure that out. The main
dialog: thing is that we’re ready for them
dialog: if they do come.
text: Kurt flips on the lights and they all gasp as they see
text: Nagopian’s thug, Ghoukas, sitting on the sofa, pointing a gun
text: at them. Another armed THUG appears behind them in the hall.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Oh god.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (to Kurt)
dialog: I thought you said you had an

speaker_heading: KURT

speaker_heading: GHOUKAS

speaker_heading: GHOUKAS
dialog: Your dog doesn’t need to be fed

speaker_heading: KURT

speaker_heading: KURT

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: That’s probably how he set up in

speaker_heading: DALE

scene_heading: INT. NAGOPIAN’S CONSTRUCTION TRAILER - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: So you don’t have my money?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: It’s just not possible to double a

dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: Not normally, no.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Come on, man. There has to be a

speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: Of course there is. It’s called

text: Ghoukas snickers.

speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Here’s what I’m thinking...
dialog: (to Kurt and Nick)
dialog: On your way home, you two will die

text: before the car crashed.
speaker_heading: KURT NICK
dialog: So specific.
speaker_heading: DALE

speaker_heading: DALE

speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN

speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Yeah. Wait, what?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (to Kurt)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: KURT

speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: It’s worth sixty thousand.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Creepy that you know that.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I’m not selling my babies anyway.
speaker_heading: KURT

speaker_heading: DALE

speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN (CONT'D)

dialog: your debt paid.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Why would you steal back something
dialog: you just sold?
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: Because that way I get their money

speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: This truck must mean a lot to you.

speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Look at this. A locked fence,

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I think that’s what Nagopian had in

speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Those guys have tattoos on their

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: If it were easy to rob a truck from

speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I had no idea starting a small

text: There’s a long beat.
speaker_heading: DALE

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Well, first of all, they’d have

speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: And I don’t think we’re going to

speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: You're thinking of Catherine Zeta-
dialog: Jones in “Entrapment.”
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: No, I’m not. Catherine Zeta-Jones
dialog: was also in “Ocean’s 11.”
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: No, she wasn’t. She was in

speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: It was the same cast.
speaker_heading: DALE

speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (still typing)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: (to Nick)
dialog: They always created a distraction
dialog: so the rest of the team could carry
text: out the heist.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: That’s true. Maybe create a
text: commotion inside the club. Draw
text: the guards in.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: What are you thinking? Smoke
dialog: pellets?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Do you have smoke pellets?
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Do you know how to make smoke
dialog: pellets?
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Guess that rules out smoke pellets.
dialog: (then)
dialog: What if two of us stage a fake
dialog: fight in there? Get everyone
dialog: watching that.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: That only leaves one of us to hot-

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: DALE

speaker_heading: JONES.
speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER
dialog: You three clowns just can’t abide
dialog: by the law, can you?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Clearly, some bad decisions were
dialog: made. Now can you please help us,
dialog: Motherfucker Jones?
speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER
dialog: What’d you call me?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Motherfucker Jones. Isn’t that
dialog: your name?
speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER
dialog: Not anymore. I changed it when I
dialog: got married.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Oh, congratulations.
speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Your wife didn’t like the name
dialog: “Motherfucker”?
speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER
dialog: No, bitch. She didn’t like the
dialog: name “Jones.” I took her last
dialog: name.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Really.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (to Motherfucker)
dialog: So what’s your name now?
speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER
dialog: Motherfucker Quang. She’s Chinese.
dialog: The hot kind. Not the big round
dialog: head kind.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: So she was okay with “Motherfucker”
dialog: but she didn’t like “Jones”?
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER
dialog: I’m pretty sure she doesn’t know
dialog: what the word “motherfucker” means.
dialog: She doesn’t know what a lot of
dialog: words mean.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: She sounds nice.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: But why did you take her last name?
speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER
dialog: Because I respect women and I
dialog: believe in equality.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: That’s fair.
speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER
dialog: And because she does everything I
dialog: tell her to do. No matter how
dialog: fucked up.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: That took a weird turn.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Okay, we don’t have a lot of time
dialog: here. So we need to know if you’ll
dialog: help us, Motherfucker... Quang?
speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER
dialog: I'll help you. But it’1l be fifty
dialog: large.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Here we go.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No. It’s not going to be fifty
dialog: large. It’s not going to be
dialog: anything large. It’s going to be
dialog: small.
speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER
dialog: (sighs, then)
dialog: All right. Gimme your watch.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: This is a Tag Heuer.
speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER
dialog: I know what it is.

speaker_heading: KURT

speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER

speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER
dialog: I don’t know about this. You

speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: You have tattoos on your head!
speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER
dialog: That's different. I grow out my
dialog: hair, I look like everyone else.
text: They grow out their hair, they look

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: We can’t turn back now.
speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER

speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER
dialog: (shocked)

scene_heading: NICK/KURT/DALE
dialog: No, no!/That’s not--/Oh boy.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Ni-Kur-Dale. It’s the name of our

speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER
dialog: Yeah, you gotta change that name.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: How much stock?
speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Done.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (leaning in to Nick)
dialog: I didn’t know we have stock.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: We don’t.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Okay, here’s how I see this going
dialog: down. Motherfucker and I will
text: stage a fight in the club. As soon
text: as the guards come inside to break
dialog: it up, you and Dale climb the
dialog: fence, hot wire the truck, drive it
dialog: through the fence and pick us up
text: out front.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Seems like Dale and I have the much
dialog: harder end of the plan.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Are you kidding? Do you know how
dialog: hard it is to stage a convincing
dialog: fake fight? The only reason I’ve
dialog: chosen myself for it is because--
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (rolling his eyes)
dialog: Don’t say “West Side Story.”
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: “West Side Story.” The school
dialog: paper said I was the most
dialog: convincing Bernardo they’d ever
dialog: seen.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (leaning in to
dialog: Motherfucker)
dialog: Bernardo is Maria’s brother. The
dialog: leader of the Sharks.
dialog: 78.
text: Motherfucker just stares at Dale.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yeah, well, I was Tony. I know how
dialog: to fake fight too.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Come on, Nick. You know Tony
text: avoided all the rumbles like a
dialog: little bitch. Bernardo was deep in
dialog: the shit the whole show.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Dale, you saw the show. Which of
dialog: us was the better fake fighter?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (delicately)
dialog: You were.
text: Nick scoffs.
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: You were the better dancer, Nick.
speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER
dialog: Fuck this shit.
text: Motherfucker turns and starts to walk away.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Okay, wait Motherfucker-- You and
dialog: Kurt will do the fake fight, Dale
dialog: and I will steal the truck.
dialog: Somehow.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Good luck, guys.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: The Sharks are going to have their
dialog: way tonight.
text: As they split up, Motherfucker turns to Kurt.
speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER
dialog: You three should just fuck each
dialog: other already.
scene_heading: INT. STRIP CLUB - MOMENTS LATER
text: Kurt and Motherfucker enter the dimly-lit club which is
text: populated by dozens of Arafia Pandilla GANG BANGERS who greet
text: them with hostile looks. On a stage, a STRIPPER works the
dialog: pole.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Damn. This place makes your bar
text: look like the Cheesecake Factory.
text: They take a seat at a table near the stage and eye their
text: surroundings nervously.
speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER
dialog: So, how do you want to do this?
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: I guess we should start with some
text: raised voices, then I’1l throw the
dialog: first punch. I won’t touch you,
dialog: but it’1ll be close, so you gotta
dialog: pretend I made contact. Then we’1l
dialog: just sort of wing it from there.
dialog: WWE style.
speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER
dialog: (raising his voice)
dialog: That sounds good to me!
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: (also raising his voice)
dialog: Oh, okay! We're going right into
dialog: this?!
text: Kurt stands, knocking his chair down. Motherfucker does the
text: same. A few heads turn. It’s hard for other people to hear
text: what they’re yelling over the music.
speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER
dialog: Fuck yeah, we are!
text: Motherfucker grabs Kurt by the shirt.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: ‘Cause I kinda wanted to psych
dialog: myself up for it a little more!
text: Kurt gives Motherfucker a little shove.
speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER
dialog: Might as well get this over with,
dialog: ‘cause I gotta work in the morning!
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: (“angrily”)
dialog: I didn’t know you had a job! What
dialog: do you do?!
text: Motherfucker shoves Kurt back.
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER
dialog: (“furious”)
dialog: I run the coffee shop at a Barnes
dialog: and Noble!
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: wi (“outraged”)
dialog: ice!
text: Motherfucker grabs a bottle and breaks it on the edge of the
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: KURT (CONT'D)
dialog: (still threatening)
dialog: Oh, shit! Don’t tell me you’re
dialog: actually gonna use that bottle!
dialog: ‘Cause that would really hurt me!
speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER
dialog: (getting in his face)
dialog: Don’t worry! I won't!
text: Motherfucker sets the bottle on the table. By now, most of
text: the bar patrons are watching this “fight.”
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: I’m gonna punch you in the face
dialog: with my right hand! You ready for
dialog: that?!
speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER
dialog: Bring it!
text: Kurt winds back and PUNCHES Motherfucker in the face, but
text: instead of missing him, he accidentally NAILS HIM RIGHT IN
text: THE NOSE. Motherfucker falls back and clutches his face.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: Oh my god, I’m so sorry.
speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER
dialog: You hit me!
text: Motherfucker looks at his hand and sees that his nose is
text: bleeding.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: I know. You must’ve leaned into
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER
dialog: Leaned into it?! I’11 lean into
dialog: you, bitch!
text: Now angry for real, Motherfucker punches Kurt.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Ow! Hey!
speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER
dialog: You want another one, Bernardo?!
text: The patrons regard this scuffle with little interest.
text: Motherfucker lunges for Kurt, who tries to fend him off with
text: a chair. But instead of hitting Motherfucker with it, he
text: swings it into a table where TWO GANG MEMBERS sit.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Uh oh.
text: The gang members stand up and grab the chair from Kurt. One
text: of them HURLS it at him but Kurt DODGES at the last second
text: and the chair flies into another GANG MEMBER who looks
dialog: pissed.
text: All at once, the club ERUPTS IN A FRENZY of chair-throwing,
text: punching and brawling.
scene_heading: EXT. STRIP CLUB - CONTINUOUS
text: Nick and Dale stand in the shadows, watching the club's
text: parking lot. Nick notices a THUG come out of the club and
text: gesture for the two guards to come inside. They leave their
text: posts and head in.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Look. They're going in.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Now’s our chance.
text: They sneak over to the 10-foot chain-link fence, topped with
text: barbed wire, that encloses the parking lot.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: There’s barbed wire. How do we get
dialog: over that?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Not a problem.
text: Dale takes off his jacket.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I’ve seen people do this. You toss
dialog: your jacket onto the barbed wire
dialog: and then you just climb over it.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Okay. Do it.
text: Dale tosses his jacket up... and right over the fence where
text: it lands on the ground on the other side. Nick gives hima
dialog: look.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I overshot it.
text: Dale tries to fish his jacket through a link in the fence but
text: it’s too thick and he only manages to wedge it halfway
dialog: through.
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: Damn it.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Can I have your jacket?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No. I’11 do it.
text: Nick takes his jacket off puts his over his shoulder, then
text: carefully climbs up the fence.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Oh, you’re not going to toss it
dialog: from the ground? That makes
dialog: sense...
text: Nick reaches the top and drapes his coat over the barbed
text: wire. He delicately clambers over the top.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (hushed)
dialog: Ow. Ow! Shit!
text: He reaches the ground.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: See? I told you that would work.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Didn’t work at all, Dale. Went
text: right through the jacket.
text: Nick holds out his hands which are flecked with bloody
text: scratches.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Oof.
scene_heading: INT. STRIP CLUB - CONTINUOUS
text: Kurt and Motherfucker cower next to the stage as COMPLETE
text: CHAOS surrounds them.
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Look, obviously I didn’t hit you on
dialog: purpose. I said I’m sorry.
text: A stripper falls off the stage and lands on them.
speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER
dialog: All right. I’m done with this
dialog: shit!
text: Motherfucker stands.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: MOTHERFUCKER
dialog: Home. You guys are a bad influence
dialog: on me.
text: He scurries toward the exit.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Motherfucker Quang, wait! We’1l
dialog: give you fifty thousand shares!
scene_heading: INT. COUNTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: We're seeing the chaos from above, through an interior
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: OSCAR (0.S.)
dialog: (Spanish with subtitles)
dialog: What’s going on down there?
text: REVEAL OSCAR, 30's, a tough as nails Arafia Pandilla member,
text: with the word “J€f€”" tattooed across his forehead (think
text: Javier Bardem). He smokes a cigarette and maintains an eerie
text: calm, even under the most extreme circumstances.
text: As he looks out a window onto the floor of the club, two GANG
text: MEMBERS bundle stacks of cash behind him.
speaker_heading: GANG MEMBER
dialog: (Spanish with subtitles)
dialog: Some kind of fight.
text: Oscar notices the two guards who came in from outside are
dialog: among the fighters.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: Who's guarding my fucking truck?
text: Oscar puts the cigarette in his mouth and heads out of the
dialog: office.
dialog: 84.
scene_heading: INT. STRIP CLUB - CONTINUOUS
text: Oscar goes down the stairs and into the war zone of the club.
text: As he heads for the back door, he is completely unfazed by
text: the violence around him. He’s like Robert Duvall in
text: “Apocalypse Now,” but instead of explosions, he walks through
text: flying chairs and bottles.
scene_heading: EXT. TRUCK —- CONTINUOUS
text: The 18-wheeler sits in the lot. A very faint light can be
text: seen coming from inside the cab.
speaker_heading: DALE (0.S.)
dialog: We're looking for a red wire with a
dialog: green or yellow stripe.
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK CABIN - CONTINUOUS
text: Nick and Dale crouch on the floor of the truck. Nick holds a
text: handful of wires from under the steering column while Dale
text: follows instruction on his smartphone.
speaker_heading: NICK
text: I see a blue wire with a yellow
dialog: stripe--
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: No! Don’t touch that one!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Calm down. We’re not defusing a
dialog: nuclear warhead.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Right. Sorry. I’ma little jumpy.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Here’s a red wire.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Okay good. According to this wiki,
dialog: that should be the power wire. We
dialog: need to connect that to the starter
dialog: wire.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Which is the starter wire?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Hang on, it’s loading.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Loading...
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Come on, Dale.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I can’t help it. It’s 3G.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Loading...
text: Suddenly, they hear a door bang shut outside.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What was that?
text: Dale peeks up out the window and sees Oscar emerging from the
text: club and looking around suspiciously.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (whisper yell)
dialog: Someone’s coming!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Get down!
text: Nick yanks Dale down below the window.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
text: Oscar notices Dale’s jacket wedged into the bottom of the
text: chain-link fence. He tosses away his cigarette as he crosses
text: to the back of the truck. He takes out his keys, unlocks the
text: rear door and opens it. He checks out the contents of the
text: trailer (we don’t see what’s inside).
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK CABIN - CONTINUOUS
text: Nick and Dale huddle together, terrified.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: What’s he doing back there?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Shhh.
text: Just then, they hear the rear door slam shut.
text: CLOSE ON the jumble of exposed wires. The slight movement of
text: the cabin from the door slamming causes the red wire to make
text: contact with a brown one. The two wires SPARK and we hear:
dialog: SFX: Truck ignition starting
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (hushed)
dialog: Yes!
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (hushed)
dialog: No!
scene_heading: EXT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS
text: Oscar reacts startled to the sound of the truck starting up.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: éQué diablos?
text: He crosses to the driver’s side door and pulls it open
dialog: revealing...
dialog: No one.
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK CABIN - CONTINUOUS
text: Oscar climbs into the driver’s seat and examines the
text: ignition. As he does, we REVEAL Nick and Dale cowering in
text: the backseat directly behind Oscar.
text: Oscar is about to turn in their direction when Dale spots a
text: six-pack of Coke on the floor. Without thinking, he grabs a
text: can and BASHES Oscar over the head with it.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Augghhh!
text: Oscar crumples over in the front seat. Nick and Dale
text: exchange a look of shock.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Jesus, Dale!
text: Before Dale can reply, Oscar sits up.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: What the fuck was that--?!
text: Dale hits him again. Coke spritzes out of the dented can.
speaker_heading: OSCAR (CONT'D)
dialog: (still conscious)
dialog: Ow! My head!
text: CLONK! Dale slams him again.
speaker_heading: OSCAR (CONT'D)
dialog: You son of a--
speaker_heading: CLONK!
speaker_heading: OSCAR (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuck!
dialog: 87.
text: Nick and Dale can’t believe this guy is still awake.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You're not hitting him hard enough!
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I’m hitting as hard as I can! You
dialog: try it!
text: Nick grabs a fresh can of Coke and clocks Oscar over the
text: head. But still Oscar fails to fall unconscious.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Damn it!
text: Nick and Dale both start BASHING Oscar over the head with
text: their respective cans. Coke sprays everywhere.
speaker_heading: OSCAR (CONT'D)
dialog: Ouch! Shit! Oooh!
text: At long last, Oscar slumps over, out cold. Nick and Dale
dialog: catch their breath.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: God, it’s hard to knock someone
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: NICK
text: Especially with a soda can.
text: There's a beat. Dale takes a sip from his battered can.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: (noticing something)
dialog: Oh damn.
text: REVERSE to see several THUGS exiting the club and hurrying
text: toward the truck.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: We've gotta go!
text: Nick and Dale scramble into the front seat.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (re: Oscar)
dialog: What about him?!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Just move him over!
text: Dale drags Oscar off the front seat as Nick slams the door
text: shut and grabs the gearshift.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Let’s get the hell out of here.
dialog: 88.
text: ACTION MUSIC crescendoes as Nick stomps on the gas pedal...
text: but the truck doesn’t move. Instead, we hear a horrible
text: GRINDING SOUND from the engine.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: What are you doing?!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I don’t know how to drive a truck!
dialog: There’s like eighteen gears on this
dialog: thing!
text: A GUNSHOT rings out, shattering the driver’s side window.
text: Dale and Nick duck down.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: They're shooting at us!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I got that.
text: Nick continues to grind the gears and the noise gets even
text: uglier. By now, the gang members are almost upon the truck.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, first gear... where are
dialog: you?
text: Finally, he grinds it into gear and the truck slowly lurches
text: forward toward the fence.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Gun it!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I’m trying, Dale! There’s like
dialog: five pedals down there!
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
text: A THUG manages to leap onto the side of the cab. He climbs
text: up to the window and points his gun at Nick. Just as he’s
text: about to fire, the truck rumbles through the fence -- not
text: fast, but with enough speed to bust through. The torn fence
text: scrapes along the sides of the truck and YANKS the thug from
dialog: his perch.
scene_heading: EXT. STRIP CLUB - MOMENTS LATER
text: Kurt runs out the front door of the club just as the truck
text: clumsily barrels around the corner, the trailer jumping the
text: curb and taking out a parking meter.
text: Kurt hurries over as Nick slows down for him to climb aboard.
dialog: 89.
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK CABIN - CONTINUOUS
text: Kurt slams the door shut as he takes a seat behind Nick and
dialog: Dale.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Took you long enough. Do you have
dialog: any idea what was going on in
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Do you have any idea what was going
dialog: on in here?!
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Where’s Motherfucker?
speaker_heading: KURT
text: He took off. Couldn’t take the
dialog: heat.
dialog: (then, noticing Oscar)
dialog: Who’s this gentleman?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: He’s in the gang. We knocked him
text: out with cans.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: No shit? That’s cool.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: We should probably tie him up or
dialog: something.
text: Kurt finds some bungee cords and proceeds to tie Oscar's
text: hands behind his back.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Are they following us?
speaker_heading: DALE
text: (looking out the side
dialog: window)
dialog: I don’t see anyone.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Hey, what do you think is in this
dialog: truck anyway?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No idea. Could be anything.
dialog: Drugs, weapons...
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Sex slaves.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I hope it’s not sex slaves.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: It’s not our business. The less we
dialog: know the better.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'll go easier on the turns in case
dialog: it’s sex slaves.
text: SFX: Dale’s cell phone rings
speaker_heading: DALE

scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: INT. DALE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME

dialog: Dale?! Where are you?! It’s four
text: in the morning.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Uh... got stuck at the office.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Well, it’s time!
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Time for what, hon?
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Time for three babies to come out
dialog: of my body!
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Right now? Are you sure?!
text: She glances over at a huge puddle of water on the floor next
text: to her.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Pretty sure.
dialog: (groans )
dialog: Ohhhhh god!
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Breathe, Stacy! Are you dilated?
dialog: Is your vagina dilated?!
text: Kurt and Nick exchange a look.
dialog: gl.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I can’t see my vagina, Dale.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Right. Okay. We’1ll be right
dialog: there! Just hang on!
text: He hangs up.
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: We've got to take Stacy to the

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: She’s in labor. We've got to pick
dialog: her up.
speaker_heading: KURT
text: In a stolen truck full of sex

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Not to mention the man with the
dialog: dragon tattoo back there.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Can’t she call a cab?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (steely)
dialog: You listen to me. My wife and
dialog: babies are the most important
dialog: things in the world to me. And
dialog: nothing’s going to stop me from
dialog: being there for them. So you
dialog: either drive this fucking rig to my

speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: What is this? What are you
dialog: driving?
speaker_heading: DALE
text: It’s a truck.

scene_heading: INT. TRUCK CABIN - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 92.
text: Dale helps Stacy recline in the back seat as Kurt climbs in

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Hey, Stacy. How you feeling?
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Hey Nick. I didn’t know you knew

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Oh yeah. Been driving them since I

text: All of a sudden, Stacy lets out a SCREAM.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: What? Is it a contraction?!
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: There’s a man on the floor!

speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Oh, right. That's...
text: (sees the “Jefe” tattoo on
dialog: Oscar’s forehead)
dialog: Jeffy. He’s an old college pal.
dialog: Latino college pal.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: What’s wrong with him?
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: He’s a drunk. Big drunk. We call
dialog: him Jeffy the... Drunk.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: He’s got so many tattoos. He looks
text: like a gang member.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: That’s a little racist, hon.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: You're right. I’m sorry.
text: As they speak, Nick notices something out his side-view
dialog: mirror.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Kurt. Is that--?
text: Kurt checks his mirror and sees two cars speeding up on the
text: truck’s tail. Inside can be seen several of the Arafia
dialog: Pandilla members.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Shit. Gun it.
text: Nick floors it and the truck picks up speed. At the same
text: time, Stacy begins to MOAN as her contractions get worse.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Hang on, babe. Just try to relax
dialog: and stay calm...
text: Dale glances out his window and sees one of the gang cars has
text: caught up and pulled alongside. A GANG MEMBER leans out his
text: window and aims a 9MM pistol at them.
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuck my shit!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Hang on.
text: He SWERVES SHARPLY to the right, putting some distance
text: between the truck and the gang car.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: What’s going on?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Nothing. You just focus on keeping
dialog: those babies inside for a little
dialog: longer.
text: CLOSE ON the speedometer which reads 90 MPH.
text: Kurt checks his mirror again and sees another GANG MEMBER
text: aiming his gun at them.
text: SMASH! The mirror SHATTERS as a bullet strikes it.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Whoa.
dialog: 94.
text: Nick can see that the cars have taken positions on either
text: side of the truck. Thinking fast, he swerves first left,
text: then right, causing the trailer to JACKKNIFE just enough to
text: impact each car. The gang cars go into a spin, driving off
text: the road and onto the shoulders.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yes!
text: The truck increases its distance from the pursuers.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: I think we’re losing them.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: The babies?!
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: No, no! The babies are fine.
scene_heading: SFX: POLICE SIREN
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No way.
text: Sure enough, a PATROL CAR has pulled out and is speeding up
text: behind the truck.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Gun it.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I’m not gunning anything. It’s a
dialog: cop.
text: Nick slows down and pulls over to the side of the road. The
text: squad car stops behind the truck and a PATROLMAN steps out.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - SAME TIME
text: Several hundred yards back, the two cars full of gang members
text: have stopped and turned off their lights, waiting to see what
dialog: happens.
scene_heading: EXT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS
text: The Patrolman approaches Nick’s window.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: Do you know you were doing 90 miles
dialog: an hour back there? A class 7
dialog: vehicle shouldn’t be going faster
dialog: than 55.
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I am so sorry about that, Officer.
dialog: It’s--
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: What are you hauling back there?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Hmm?
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: What’s in the trailer?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Just stuff. I don’t even know.
speaker_heading: DALE (0.S.)
dialog: Nothing secret.
speaker_heading: KURT (0.S.)
dialog: Dale!
text: The Patrolman reacts to the disembodied voices.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: All right, well, you're going to
dialog: show me. Everyone out of the cab,
dialog: please--
text: Just then, Stacy lets out a pained MOAN.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN (CONT’D)
dialog: What the hell’s going on in there?
text: He steps up on the running board and peers into the cab.
text: From his POV he sees Dale tending to Stacy. Oscar isn’t
text: visible.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Is she all right?
speaker_heading: KURT
text: She's having a baby.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Triplets!
text: Stacy moans again.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: That’s actually why we were
dialog: speeding. We’re taking her to the
dialog: hospital.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: Why didn’t you say so? Come on.
dialog: I'll give you an escort.
dialog: 96.
text: Suddenly, Oscar MOANS as he begins to regain consciousness.
text: The Patrolman looks puzzled for a moment. Stacy moans again
text: and he shakes it off and hurries back to his car.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: All right then.
text: As soon as the cop is gone, Dale grabs a fresh can of soda
text: and CLOCKS Oscar over the head with it. Oscar slumps over.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Why did you hit your friend with a
dialog: can?!
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (struggling to cover)
dialog: It’s an inside joke. Don’t worry.
text: The patrol car turns on its siren and pulls out. The truck
text: follows.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
text: The gang members watch, pissed off, as the truck leaves with
dialog: the cop.
speaker_heading: GANG MEMBER
dialog: (Spanish with subtitles)
dialog: What the fuck?
speaker_heading: GANG MEMBER #2
dialog: (Spanish with subtitles)
dialog: Don’t worry. We’ll get to them.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - MINUTES LATER
text: The truck ZOOMS down the road following the patrol car.
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT
text: The truck and the patrol car pull to a stop at the emergency
text: room entrance. Dale jumps out.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Wheelchair! Can we get a
dialog: wheelchair here?!
text: No one comes.
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: This is a terrible hospital.
dialog: 97.
text: He hurries inside. Kurt and Nick help Stacy out of the truck
text: as the cop joins them.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Oh god! They’re coming out!
speaker_heading: DALE (0.S.)
dialog: Here I am! I’m coming!
text: Dale runs back out pushing a wheelchair and Stacy sits.
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Nick and Kurt)
dialog: I'll be right back.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Kind of in a time crunch here,
dialog: Dale.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I know. But I got us into this and
dialog: I’m not gonna send you there
dialog: without me.
dialog: (wheeling Stacy inside)
dialog: Wish us luck!
text: Dale and Stacy go.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Good luck.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (to Patrolman)
dialog: Thank you, Officer. You’ve been a
dialog: big help.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: My pleasure. Y’know, I’ve always
dialog: wanted to do that: escort a
text: pregnant lady to the hospital.
dialog: It’s kind of the reason I became a
dialog: cop.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Aww, that’s nice.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: That and getting to shoot people.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Aww.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Well, we don’t want to keep you,
dialog: SO...
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: Just going to need to see the
dialog: contents of your trailer.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: I'm sorry?
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: Yeah, you didn’t get to show me
dialog: before.
text: Nick and Kurt exchange a fearful look.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Uhhh...
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: (no nonsense)
dialog: Let's go.
text: Nick lets out a sigh and slowly leads the Patrolman toward
text: the rear door of the trailer. He and Kurt stand there,
text: staring at the door for a beat.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Here we are...
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: Open it, please.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yup.
text: Nick unlatches the door and slides it up, revealing the
text: trailer’s interior. The patrolman shines his flashlight
dialog: inside.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: Holy crap.
text: REVERSE ANGLE to reveal stacked boxes labeled “DORA THE
scene_heading: EXPLORER PLUSH DOLLS.”
text: Kurt and Nick exhale, relieved.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN (CONT’D)
dialog: My daughter would cream her jeans
dialog: if she saw this.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Big “Dora the Explorer” fan, is
dialog: she?
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: Oh my god. She loves that little
dialog: bitch.
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Why don’t you take one for your
dialog: daughter?
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: Yeah?
text: Kurt hops onto the trailer and tears open a box. He hands a
text: Dora doll to the cop.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Here, y'know what? Take a Boots
dialog: the Monkey, too.
text: He hands the cop another doll.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: Thanks, guys. When my daughter
dialog: sees these, she’s gonna blow a
dialog: load.
text: Kurt and Nick look a bit disgusted.
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK CABIN - SHORT TIME LATER
text: Nick and Kurt climb back into the cab.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Why the hell would Nagopian want a
dialog: truck full of Nick Jr. dolls?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I don’t know and I don’t care. But
dialog: we're not waiting anymore. We've
dialog: got to get this truck back by sun-
dialog: up.
text: Nick GRINDS the truck into gear.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Oh yeah. What’s with the whole
dialog: “sun-up” thing, by the way? He
dialog: couldn't just give us a time? This
dialog: isn’t “High Noon.” Even that had a
dialog: time. Noon.
text: Before Nick pulls out, they see Dale running up.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Hey, wait! I’m ready to go!
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: What about the babies?
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: She had ‘em! Two boys and a girl!
dialog: And some poop. But I’m a dad!
text: He climbs aboard and they pull out.
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: You weren’t going to leave without
dialog: me, were you?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Sun's coming up, Dale. We're
text: running out of time.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Check it out.
text: He shows them a photo on his phone.
text: INSERT: Stacy struggling to hold THREE NEWBORN BABIES
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Congratulations, Dale.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Adorable.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Is the one on the right a little
dialog: wonky?
text: INSERT: the same photo. The one on the right is smaller and
text: goofier looking than his siblings.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Milo? He’s not wonky. He’s just a
text: little smaller than the other two.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: They're all beautiful.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Thank you.
text: He sits back. Nick leans toward Kurt.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: There’s definitely something going
text: on with Milo.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Right?
dialog: (then, checks watch)
dialog: I think we’re okay. I think we’re
dialog: gonna make it back to Nagopian in
dialog: time.
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: OSCAR (0.S.)
dialog: So you're working for that piece of
dialog: crap?
text: The guys jump, startled. Oscar has regained consciousness,
text: his hands still tied.
speaker_heading: OSCAR (CONT'D)
dialog: I should've figured.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (re: Oscar)
dialog: Shit. I forgot about him.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: What I don’t understand is, why
dialog: would Nagopian hire three putos
dialog: like you?
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: If we’re such putos, how did we
dialog: steal your truck and knock you out?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Yeah! And what’s a puto?
text: Oscar smiles calmly.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: You have no idea what kind of shit
dialog: you're in.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What about you? I hate to think
dialog: what Nagopian’s going to do to you
dialog: when we get there.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: I’m not worried.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: If you’re not worried, then why are
dialog: you crying?
dialog: (looking closer)
dialog: Oh wait. That’s a tattoo.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Whatever happens to me, my men will
dialog: find you and kill you.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: You have “men”? Why do you have
dialog: “men"?
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Because I’m the leader of the Arafa
dialog: Pandilla.
dialog: 102.
scene_heading: EXT. TRUCK —- CONTINUOUS
text: Nick JAMS ON the brakes and the truck SQUEALS to a stop.
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK CABIN - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (to Oscar)
dialog: You're the gang leader?!
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: What do you think this fucking
dialog: tattoo on my forehead says?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Jeffy. Isn’t your name Jeffy?
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Jefe. It means “boss”! Didn’t any
dialog: of you take Spanish in school?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I took French.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: (to Nick and Dale)
dialog: Why did you guys kidnap the gang
dialog: leader?!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: He got in the truck. We didn’t
dialog: have a choice.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: What do we do with him?
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: You let me go.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: We're not letting you go.
dialog: (then, quietly to Nick)
dialog: Should we let him go?
text: Dale leans forward to listen.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I don’t know. If we take him to
dialog: Nagopian he'll probably kill him.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Yeah. But if we let him out, he’1l
dialog: kill us.
speaker_heading: DALE
text: How? His hands are tied.
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: They won’t be tied forever, Dale.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Maybe we can make a deal with him.
dialog: We let him go and Nagopian doesn’t
dialog: kill him. And in return for saving
dialog: his life, he lets us off the hook.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Seems reasonable.
dialog: (turning to Oscar)
dialog: How does that sound, Jeffy?
text: They all look to see the rear truck door is open and Oscar is
dialog: gone.
speaker_heading: KURT (CONT'D)
dialog: Where did he go?!
scene_heading: EXT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS
text: Dale and Kurt get out of the truck and look around.
speaker_heading: DALE
text: He’s gone.
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Jeffy?!
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: You think he’s going to come back
dialog: if you call him?
speaker_heading: NICK (0.S.)
dialog: Forget about him. The sun is
dialog: coming up. Let’s get this damn
text: truck back.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: How did he open the door with his
text: hands tied? He’s like a Dominican
dialog: ninja. A Dominja.
text: We hear horrible GRINDING SOUNDS from the transmission and
text: Kurt and Dale climb in as the truck jerks forward.
scene_heading: EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAWN
text: The sun is just rising as the 18-wheeler pulls up to
text: Nagopian’s office trailer. Nagopian and Ghoukas exit the
text: trailer as Nick, Kurt and Dale step down from the truck.
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: You actually made it? No fucking
dialog: way.
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yes, fucking way. Here’s your
dialog: truck. Are we done now?
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
text: One moment. Ghoukas.
text: Ghoukas crosses to the back of the truck.
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: How did you get past the
dialog: Dominicans?
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: You ever see “Oceans 11”?
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: With Catherine Zeta-Jones?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: No.
text: Ghoukas returns with a Dora the Explorer doll and hands it to
dialog: Nagopian.
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: That’s what was in the truck.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: (to Nagopian)
dialog: Why did you need a bunch of dolls
dialog: so badly?
text: Nagopian yanks the head off the doll and pulls out a baggie
text: filled with powder.
speaker_heading: KURT (CONT'D)
dialog: Ah. Right. Drugs of some sort.
dialog: That makes more sense.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (leaning in)
dialog: We gave them to that cop’s
dialog: daughter.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Ooh. Probably shouldn’t have, huh?
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: I have to admit, I’m impressed. I
dialog: didn’t think you mongoloids would
dialog: pull it off.
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: So, are we... good?
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: Well, since you did bring me a
dialog: truck worth 20 million dollars, I’m
dialog: going to forgive your debt.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Oh, thank god.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: 20 million?
dialog: (whistles)
dialog: If anything, you should pay us
dialog: more.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: He’s kidding. Thank you, Mr.
dialog: Nagopian. We're really glad we
dialog: could work this all out without any
dialog: of us... being killed.
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: Ghoukas, call our friends a cab.
text: They shake hands with Nagopian just as a car pulls up, driven
text: by a WOMAN. Nagopian hands the Dora doll to Ghoukas who
text: takes it away.
text: The woman steps out of the car. Dale looks at her. Why does
dialog: she look familiar?
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello, dear.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Hi, hon. Gabe and I wanted to say
dialog: goodbye before we head for the
dialog: airport.
text: Dale looks even more uneasy.
text: The woman opens the rear passenger door and out steps Gabe,
text: THE BOY WHO DALE HELPED GO TO THE BATHROOM. Dale’s jaw
dialog: drops.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: No fucking way.
text: Nagopian gives his wife a kiss and lifts up his son for a
dialog: hug.
dialog: There’s a
dialog: disbelief.
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: How’s my little monster?
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: Well, we should get out of your

speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: We're waiting for a cab, Dale.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (getting panicky)
dialog: That’s okay. We don’t need a cab.
speaker_heading: GABE’S MOTHER
dialog: (noticing Dale)
dialog: Hey, don’t you work for Gabe’s
dialog: dentist?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Hm? No. What? I don’t think so.

dialog: Time to go, guys. Come on.
speaker_heading: GABE’S MOTHER
dialog: Yeah, you work with Dr. Slocum.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Don’t know who that is.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: What is your problem? You did work

speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Nope! Different person. Let’s go.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: I know you.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: No, you don’t.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Yeah, you’re the man who took out
dialog: my penis.
text: stunned silence. Nick and Kurt exchange a look of
text: Dale forces a laugh.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: What?! Where did that come from?
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: What are you saying, Gabe? This
dialog: man? He touched you?
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Just my penis.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Okay, hang on! Gabe asked me to do
dialog: it! He was practically begging me--
text: Mrs. Nagopian gasps. Nagopian’s expression turns stone cold
text: as he glares at Dale.
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: Let me back up. I took him to the
dialog: bathroom. Come on, Gabe. Tell
dialog: them why I did it.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Why not?!
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: You said we had to keep it secret.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Oh damn.
dialog: (to Kurt)
dialog: Should we--?
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Run? Yeah.
text: They grab Dale’s arm and take off RUNNING toward the exit of
dialog: the construction site.
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: Ghoukas!
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: (breathing hard)
dialog: God damn it, Dale. We were off the
dialog: hook!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Of all the kids you could've
dialog: molested...
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I didn’t molest anyone!
text: As they approach the exit, two cars speed onto the
dialog: construction site.
dialog: 108.
text: Oscar hangs out the passenger window of one car, holding a
text: gun. He rides with a half dozen of his tattooed GANG
speaker_heading: MEMBERS.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Is that--?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: It's Jeffy!
text: Oscar aims and FIRES his gun, narrowly missing them. Gravel
text: flies up beside them.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: This way!
text: Nick, Kurt and Dale retreat back the way they came. But
text: before they get far, they see Nagopian, Ghoukas and another
text: THUG leave the office trailer carrying weapons.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Not this way!
text: Nagopian’s thug aims his Uzi at the guys, but before he can
text: fire, he is SHOT IN THE ARM by one of the Dominicans.
text: Caught in the crossfire, our guys duck and scramble for
text: cover. Kurt spots the main entrance to the unfinished 10-
text: story office building.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Over here!
text: As the two gangs take pot shots at each other, Nick, Kurt and
text: Dale scurry into the building.
text: ANGLE ON Nagopian and Ghoukas, who see them go in and hurry
dialog: after them.
scene_heading: INT. UNFINISHED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
text: Nick, Kurt and Dale race up the emergency stairs. The higher
text: they go, the more unfinished the building is. They stop on
text: the third floor to catch their breath. They can hear gunfire
text: from outside. Nick pulls out his cell phone and dials.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Who are you calling?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: My mom.
dialog: (then)
dialog: 911!
text: Dale peers down the open area of the staircase.

speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I don’t see anyone--
text: P-TING! A bullet RICOCHETS off the railing beside Dale.
text: REVEAL Nagopian and Ghoukas at the bottom of the stairs
text: aiming up at them.
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: I’m going to put a bullet in your
dialog: balls!
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (calling down)
dialog: He was gonna pee in his pants! I
dialog: helped him--
text: P-TING! Another bullet flies past.
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Kurt)
text: He doesn’t want to listen.
text: The guys continue up the stairs.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Yes, hello. There are Dominicans
dialog: and Armenians shooting at us!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Well, it’s a long story. The main
dialog: thing to focus on is that they’re
dialog: shooting at us.
scene_heading: EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - CONTINUOUS
text: An SUV pulls up and unloads four ARMENIAN MOBSTERS, all

text: Oscar slips into the unfinished building and heads for the
dialog: stairs.
scene_heading: INT. UNFINISHED BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER
text: Nick, Kurt and Dale are now at the top floor. Nick’s still
text: on the phone. They leave the stairwell and take cover behind
text: a stack of drywall. There are no outside walls or windows,
text: only plastic sheets which flutter in the wind.
speaker_heading: SFX: BEEP
text: Nick looks at his phone to see an incoming call. The caller
text: ID reads: “SKYMALL INC.”

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (showing Kurt and Dale)
dialog: Guys, look.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: SkyMall? What could they want?
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Maybe they had second thoughts
dialog: about the Shower Buddy. Take it.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Not the best time for a business
dialog: call, Kurt. We’re about to be shot
dialog: to death.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Exactly. Wouldn’t you rather die
dialog: knowing that we’re not just three
dialog: idiots who quit their jobs for no
dialog: reason?
text: Nick hesitates. Kurt grabs the phone from him and answers

text: BANG! A shot overhead showers the guys with drywall pieces.
text: Kurt peeks out from his cover to find Nagopian and Ghoukas
text: scanning the room for them. A piece of plastic blows in from

speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: We're going to find you fuckers!

speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: (quietly)
text: I’m just down on the factory floor.
dialog: How can I help you, Claire?
text: As Claire speaks, the three crawl behind various piles of
text: construction equipment to avoid being found by the Armenians.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Well, despite our misgivings about
dialog: you and your colleagues on a
dialog: personal level, we showed your
dialog: Shower Buddy to our boss and she
dialog: flipped for it.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: (full voice)
dialog: Seriously?
dialog: (to Nick and Dale)
dialog: They like the Buddy!
text: BANG! Hearing Kurt’s voice, Nagopian fires in his direction.
text: Nick, Kurt and Dale hustle for a new hiding spot.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (to Kurt)
dialog: Shhh!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: We do have a couple of questions,
dialog: though, before we can make an
dialog: order.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Sure, sure. That’s great. Do you
dialog: think we could call you back a
dialog: little later in the day?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Unfortunately, we go to press on
dialog: our fall catalogue today, so it’s
dialog: kind of a now-or-never situation.
dialog: That’s why we’re calling so early.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: I see. Okay, well, we’ll be happy
dialog: to answer your questions--—
text: He peeks out from his hiding spot and sees Oscar and four of
text: his thugs run in with weapons drawn.
speaker_heading: KURT (CONT'D)
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Holy shit.
text: Nagopian and Ghoukas take cover as Oscar and his men turn
text: their attention to them.
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: You think you can steal from me,
dialog: pendejo?!
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: Jaj tam vret!
text: They open fire on each other. BANG, BANG, BANG! Kurt, Nick
text: and Dale cower.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Was that gunfire?
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Nope. Those are... bolt guns.
text: They're shooting bolts into the
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: All right, well, first of all, we
dialog: need to know if the estimates you
dialog: gave us on your maximum output
dialog: capacity were theoretical or rated?
text: One of the Arafia Pandilla members is SHOT multiple times. He
text: collapses directly over where Kurt is hiding, dropping his
text: gun and BLEEDING DOWN ONTO KURT’S HEAD.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: (reacting)
dialog: Ugghhh.
dialog: (then, keeping it
dialog: together)
dialog: Those estimates were rated, based
dialog: on actual productivity figures over
dialog: a two week period-- Pfft!
text: Kurt spits blood out of his mouth that has dripped down from
text: the fallen gang member above him.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE)
dialog: Okay, good. And tell me about your
dialog: replenishment lead time.
text: More of Nagopian’s men have joined the battle on the top
text: floor. It’s an all-out gang war.
text: Struggling to see despite the blood that has dripped into his
text: eyes, Kurt spots an Armenian THUG heading in his direction.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: (spits more blood)
dialog: Pfft! I’m gonna hand you over to
dialog: my co-CEO, Nick. He can tell you
dialog: all about our
dialog: (loudly for Nick’s sake)
dialog: replenishment lead time.
dialog: 113.
text: Kurt tosses the phone to Nick and scrambles for cover on his
text: hands and knees. As Nick speaks, he “army crawls” under a
text: tarp.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Hi, Claire. As far as our RLT
dialog: goes, our assembly line can produce
dialog: 75 completed units per hour, so we
dialog: can meet any orders with a minimum
dialog: of lead time--
text: BANG! A bullet rips through the tarp just over Nick. He
text: flinches.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Is everything okay there?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Everything's just f--UCK!
text: Nick holds up his left hand which we see has a BULLET HOLE IN
dialog: IT.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Excuse me?
text: Freaking out, Nick spots Dale hiding nearby.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (pained)
dialog: I’m gonna transfer you to my
dialog: colleague, Dale. DALE!
text: Nick throws the phone at Dale and grabs his hand in agony.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Dale here.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Um, hello. I was just going to ask
dialog: if your manufacturing cycle
dialog: efficiency matches the throughput
dialog: estimates from your production spec
dialog: sheet.
text: Dale hasn’t the slightest idea what Claire’s talking about.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: That’s all we needed to know.
dialog: Welcome to the SkyMall family.
dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Thanks, lady!
text: Claire shrugs and hangs up. Dale pumps his fist
text: victoriously.
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: Guys, we did it!
text: He looks over at Kurt who is disgustedly wiping blood from
text: his face, then at Nick who is frantically wrapping his bloody
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: Whoa. Are you okay?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No, I’m not okay! I got shot in
dialog: the fucking hand!
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: I swallowed gangster blood!
dialog: (noticing)
dialog: Oh shit.
text: They turn to see Oscar stalking straight toward them, his gun
dialog: drawn.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: And now you learn what happens when
dialog: you kidnap the head of the Arafa P--
text: BLAM! A bullet blasts right through Oscar’s head,
text: SPLATTERING ONLY KURT’S FACE WITH BLOOD.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Ugghh! With the blood. Pfft!
text: Oscar falls, revealing Nagopian standing behind him, his own
text: gun drawn.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: You saved our lives.
speaker_heading: MR. NAGOPIAN
dialog: I was aiming at you. He got in the
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: Oh.
text: Nagopian takes aim directly at Dale. Dale cringes. Nick
text: spots a wheelbarrow filled with POWDERED CONCRETE. He grabs
text: a handful and TOSSES it into Nagopian’s face, momentarily
text: blinding him.
dialog: They take
dialog: when they
dialog: They head
dialog: recovered
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: NICK
text: (clutching his wounded and
text: now concrete caked hand)
dialog: Ow!
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Come on!
text: off running in the direction of the stairs but stop
text: see Ghoukas blocking their path.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Ghoukas.
text: off in another direction. By now, Nagopian has
text: and is hunting them down.
text: Our guys find themselves at the edge of the building with a
text: HUNDRED FOOT DROP IN FRONT OF THEM.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: It’s a dead end.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: There’s no way down.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Wait, look.
text: Kurt points to a construction debris chute (like a
text: waterslide) that leads to a dumpster below.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Are you kidding? We wouldn’t
dialog: survive that.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Sure we will. It’s just like the
text: slides at Raging Waters.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yeah, if those slides ended in a
dialog: dumpster full of sharp metal!
text: Nagopian and Ghoukas are closing in.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Well, I’m going.
text: Kurt jumps feet first into the slide and disappears. Nick
text: and Dale look at each other for a beat. Dale shrugs and
text: jumps into the slide.
text: Nick sighs.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: God damn it.
dialog: 116.
text: He follows his friends down the chute.
scene_heading: INT. DEBRIS CHUTE - CONTINUOUS
text: Kurt BARRELS down the dusty slide.
speaker_heading: KURT
text: WHOAAAAHHHHH!
text: Right behind him, Dale speeds along.
speaker_heading: DALE
text: AHHHHHHHHHHH!
text: Bringing up the rear is Nick.
speaker_heading: NICK
speaker_heading: SHHHITIIIIIT!
text: From Kurt’s POV, we see the bottom of the chute rapidly
text: approaching. A LONG, SHARP piece of REBAR juts into the
text: slide, pointing directly up toward Kurt’s oncoming testicles.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Oh fuck.
text: He desperately splays out his legs and hands, slowing himself
text: down on the walls of the chute. He manages to stop his
text: descent a MERE FOOT from the pointy end of the steel bar...
text: UNTIL DALE SLAMS INTO HIM from behind, shoving him six inches
text: closer to the bar.
speaker_heading: KURT (CONT'D) DALE
dialog: Ahh! Oof!
text: Just then, Nick SLIDES INTO THE TWO OF THEM, shoving Kurt’s
text: crotch down to within AN INCH of being impaled.
text: Kurt takes a deep breath, then kicks the rebar to the side.
scene_heading: EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Filthy, bloody and exhausted, the three guys climb out of the
text: dumpster only to find a half dozen GUNS pointed at them.
speaker_heading: MAN (0.S.)
dialog: Freeze!
text: The guys realize they are surrounded by COPS, including
text: Hagan. A couple SWAT team vans unload and take up positions
text: around the building.
dialog: 117.
speaker_heading: HAGAN
dialog: So you dildos weren't bullshitting
dialog: me after all.
text: He gestures for the cops to lower their guns. An OFFICER
text: steps up to Hagan.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Sir, we've apprehended Nagopian.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Think you have enough evidence on
dialog: him now, Detective?
text: Hagan gives him a look.
speaker_heading: HAGAN
dialog: You guys okay?
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (re: the blood crusted on
dialog: his face)
dialog: Think I could get an AIDS test?
text: Nick’s cell phone rings. It’s SkyMall again.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE (0.S.)
dialog: It’s Claire Robbins again. I’m
dialog: sorry, I forgot one last thing.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE (0.S.)
dialog: Your company name. Nickurdale? It
dialog: kinda sounds like...
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: “N-word Dale.” Any way you could
dialog: change it?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Hmm, never occurred to us. But
dialog: sure, we can change it.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE - TWO WEEKS LATER
text: A RECEPTIONIST picks up the phone.
dialog: 118.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Thank you for calling Danickur.

dialog: worker picks it up and we
scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
speaker_heading: OVER CREDITS:
scene_heading: INT. NICK'S SHOWER - DAY
text: CLOSE ON a Shower Buddy in use. REVEAL Nick taking a shower.

text: Kurt lathers up happily under his own Shower Buddy.
scene_heading: INT. DALE'S SHOWER - DAY

dialog: two.
scene_heading: INT. MOTHERFUCKER’S SHOWER - DAY

scene_heading: INT. SHOWER - DAY
text: Nagopian looks unhappy as he adjusts his Shower Buddy. PULL

dialog: 119.
scene_heading: INT. NICK'S SHOWER - DAY
text: ANGLE ON THE FLOOR of the shower where the Shower Buddy has
text: left a thick and DANGEROUSLY SLIPPERY accumulation of soap,

text: Kurt turns and also falls on his ass, pulling the shower
text: curtain down with him.
scene_heading: INT. DALE’S SHOWER - DAY
