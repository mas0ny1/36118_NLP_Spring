dialog: 
scene_heading: AN LCD BILLBOARD WITH DEFECTIVE PIXELS
dialog: 
text: A BEAUTIFUL COUPLE dance on a giant can of a Red-Bull-like
text: drink-- HYPNO! The label morphs to different flavors.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. A VACANT LOT -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Colored light from the billboard flickers over a bullet
scene_heading: riddled sign: ROUTE 85. U.S. BORDER, EL PASO, TEXAS.
dialog: 
text: Beneath the sign is a LONG BLACK LIMOUSINE.
dialog: 
text: Cars whip past on the highway. Then A VAN passes, blasting
text: some future version of Techno Latino Hip Hop. A SQUEAL OF
text: TIRES OS. Now the music gets louder as the van returns,
text: cruising slowly past the black limo before pulling into the
text: lot. Five Bangers bail out and check out the black stretch.
dialog: 
text: The limo doors are locked, windows tinted, so they can't see
text: what's inside, but they check out the tires and wheels and
text: like what they see. With the speed of a pit crew, they open
text: the back of the van and out come TOOLS AND A JACK.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIMO -- SAME
dialog: 
text: We move over the back bench, past empty bottles, fast food
text: wrappers as A SLEEPING MAN'S FACE ratchets into frame.
text: He opens his red eyes.
dialog: 
text: The man is LOGAN aka The Wolverine or more accurately, Drunk
text: Wolverine. He blinks, dazed, feeling the car lurching upward.
text: Older than we've seen him, he clutches a Tequila bottle.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LIMO -- EL PASO HIGHWAY TURNOUT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: As the back door opens, the tequila bottle drops to the dirt
text: and A BOOTED LEG STEPS OUT.
dialog: 
text: Logan shuffles, stiff, to the other side of the stretch where
text: the Bangers work, removing wheels, lit by colored light.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: ...Uh. Please stop, guys. Those,..
text: those are chrome plated lugs.
dialog: 
text: They all five turn. Some pull guns on the drunk limo driver.
text: He just keeps talking, slurring some...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: you're gonna strip `em. Plating
dialog: flakes off, you know...
dialog: 
text: A Jittery Banger cocks his shotgun.
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: It's a lease, you know, and no one
dialog: wants to pay to ride in a--
dialog: 
text: -- THE JITTERY BANGER FIRES. Blows Logan right off his feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuck.
dialog: 
dialog: Now might be a good time to talk about "fights" described in
dialog: the next 100 or so pages. Basically, if you're on the make
text: for a hyper choreographed, gravity defying, city-block
dialog: destroying, CG fuckathon, this ain't your movie.
dialog: 
dialog: In this flick, people will get hurt or killed when shit falls
dialog: on them. They will get just as hurt or just as killed if they
dialog: get hit with something big and heavy like, say, a car. Should
dialog: anyone in our story have the misfortune to fall off a roof or
text: out a window, they won't bounce. They will die.
dialog: 
dialog: As for our hero with his so-called eternal life and healing.
dialog: Well, he's older now. If you keep reading, you'll discover
text: Logan's about to get his ass kicked. But before we get to
dialog: that, we should make it clear his abilities ain't what they
text: were. Yes, he's a drunk, but he's also fading on the inside.
text: Adamantium implants leeching into his system, causing chronic
text: pain and diminished healing, hence booze as painkiller.
dialog: 
dialog: So by all means, go ahead and worry about him.
dialog: Now where were we? Oh, yeah--
dialog: 
text: As the smoke settles, a CROWBAR-toting Banger angrily chews
text: out Jitters in Spanish for firing. The others resume their
text: work... none aware of Logan slowly getting up, till --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Guys... seriously...
dialog: (gets to his feet)
dialog: You don't wanna do this.
dialog: 
text: The Bangers react to Logan with bafflement. Ad-lib Spanish
dialog: reactions, nervous chuckles --
dialog: 
text: CROWBAR presses down JITTER'S gun as he moves to Logan.
dialog: 
text: We hear a familiar SNIKT! as claws slowly extend from one of
text: Logan's hands, then mostly extend from the other. Logan is
text: still frowning at his bad hand when--
dialog: 
text: CROWBAR THWACKS HIS SKULL. A metallic ring.
dialog: 
text: Off balance and pissed, Logan swings at them as they
text: converge, but he's drunk and soon they are pounding him with
text: knives and guns and fists and a torque wrench.
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 3.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He tries his best to keep them from the limo, catches one
text: guy's bat an inch before it would dent the car.
dialog: 
text: Another one of them shoots in that direction, but Logan puts
text: himself in front of the bullet. The pain from that little
text: move stops him long enough for them to resume the pummeling.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, Logan's eyes go yellow, pupils dilating. He lets
text: out a long, loud yell. Fury rockets up in him, like cocaine.
dialog: 
text: HE STANDS AND RAMS HIS CLAWS INTO CROWBAR and kicks another
text: Banger into the back of the open van. Yet another runs at
text: Logan only to get gored in the neck and tossed. This is real
text: work for Logan, not easy. And it is fueled by rage.
dialog: 
text: Jitters again raises his sawed-off, he will nail the car for
text: sure, but Logan slices off his arm above the elbow.
dialog: 
text: Sadly for Logan, the hand, while disconnected from the body
text: it once belonged to, is still holding the gun. So, as it hits
text: the dirt, the gun goes off, putting several pellet-sized
text: holes in the door of the limo.
dialog: 
dialog: This, more than anything else, doubles Logan anger--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: MOTHERF--
dialog: 
text: WHO GETS HIT ONCE MORE --and then goes after the last banger
text: who, seeing he had his chance, leaps into the van and spins
text: out of the lot, his wounded compadre in back, spilling onto
text: the dirt as the van bounces back onto the road.
dialog: 
text: Logan picks up his keys, some loose change and a single
text: silver bullet. He stands, staring at the holes in his
text: otherwise pristine stretch as RAIN BEGINS TO FALL.
dialog: 
text: He sucks in deep breaths, forcing himself to regain control.
text: His eyes return to normalcy. A PHONE VIBRATES OS. Logan takes
text: out his, looks at it (he's got a fare), kicks the jack from
text: the under the chassis.
dialog: 
text: WE CRANE UP as Logan starts up the stretch and makes a loop
text: in the lot, taking care to run over the three remaining
text: Bangers before laying rubber onto the highway...
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAIN TITLES BEGIN:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALL-IN GUEST (O.S.)
dialog: Everyone's asleep, Burt. Sleep-
dialog: walking! Hostages! No one cares!
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT./EXT. LIMO - EL PASO STREETS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: LOGAN cruises the wet El Paso streets. LCD Billboards for
text: chemically enhanced life. Gang graffiti on self-driving
text: buses. A kaleidoscope of moments, dark and mundane.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CALL IN GUEST
dialog: You can't see the connection? Tween
dialog: the ice caps, pornographers, debt,
dialog: mutants, poisoned water, it's all-Â­
dialog: 
text: Colored lights play against A TAXI &amp; LIMO ID. Logan's photo
text: over the name: "JAMES HOWLETT"
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALL IN HOST
dialog: Clyde, its 2026! We're talkin `bout
dialog: a hostage crisis and you're talkin'
dialog: mutants? That's history, pal. Trey
dialog: in Galveston, you're on!
dialog: 
text: A beat throbs through the partition. Logan's eyes flick to--
dialog: 
text: FOUR INEBRIATED PROM BOYS in back, in pastel tuxes. Three of
text: them stand on the bench looking out the sunroof. They howl
text: and shout, "rapping" with the now blasting music, waving to
text: rain-soaked Hispanics at a HEAVILY GUARDED BORDER GATE.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE-- LOGAN as he endures the torture, jaw clenched, brake
text: lights on his face as WE CUT TO :
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. EL PASO GAS STATION -- EARLIER
dialog: 
text: Wet and bullet-riddled from the altercation with the Bangers,
text: Logan grabs a "back-up" suit from the trunk. He holds it up,
dialog: not in the best shape, but will have to do.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BACK TO: INT./EXT. LIMO -- PROM CAR -- EL PASO STREETS
dialog: 
text: THE PROM TEENS in the back suck vape sticks and laugh. Two
text: get it on. One pitches forward and yells over the music.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEEN
dialog: Yo, Driver, you got any Bang in
dialog: this whip?!
dialog: 
text: Logan pretends he can't hear. Instead, his gaze shifts to his
text: passenger visor, and what's tucked there:
dialog: 
scene_heading: A PAGE FROM A SPANISH PENNY SAVER -- a USED 70 FT. SUNSEEKER
text: docked in the Gulf of Mexico, LA SERENATA painted on its
text: transom. Scrawled below: "Asking $60K."
dialog: 
text: Logan stares hard at the image of the boat. Takes a centering
text: breath -- when the TEEN BEGINS KNOCKING on the partition.
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Yo - Driver!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTHER TEEN
dialog: `Bitch is deaf.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. EL PASO GAS STATION -- EARLIER
dialog: 
text: Logan cleans up at the sink. Allows a couple slugs to pop
text: from his (slowly healing) wounds as he changes into a clean
text: suit. Looks at himself in the mirror. HIS PHONE BUZZES.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
text: Back to work, old man.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PLAZA THEATER / ARENA EL PASO - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Logan waits with other drivers as muffled off screen
text: "hallelujahs!" ring out O.S. He looks at a large screen TV
text: where the crowd can be seen, hands raised, praising God.
text: Everywhere are similar words in a "trademarked" design--
dialog: 
dialog: "You are God's plan!" "We are God's plan!"
dialog: "Be Part of God's plan!" "His plan!"
dialog: 
text: Then Logan notices, across the street--
dialog: 
text: A FIAT WITH MEXICAN PLATES AND A BAD HEADLIGHT DOUBLE PARKED.
text: The driver, a Woman inside watching him. A child in back in a
text: red jacket watches him too.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT./EXT. LIMO - EL PASO STREETS - LATER - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: AN OLD LADY and her HUSBAND, both in failing health, ride,
text: clinging to "God's Plan" Merchandise. The Old Lady looks out
text: the window at the lost souls on the street.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLD LADY
dialog: Shouldn't we lock the doors?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: They're locked, ma'am.
dialog: 
text: Logan watches as her husband takes her hand. Then, Logan
text: notices-- THE FIAT WITH MEXICAN PLATES. He makes a quick
text: turn, the old folks sliding to one side. He's lost them.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. EL PASO CEMETERY GROUNDS - DAWN
dialog: 
text: Logan in f.g., tossing out some trash as A PASTOR speaks to a
text: grieving assemblage over a grave.
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Returning to his limo, Logan watches THE BEREAVED FAMILY,
text: drawn in spite of himself: how they mourn the loss of their
dialog: own, how they console each other--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Logan.
dialog: 
text: He turns to face A DISHEVELED HISPANIC WOMAN, 35. She stands
text: about twenty paces from THE BATTERED FIAT WITH ONE HEADLIGHT,
text: wipers on. Logan eyes the woman, wild-eyed, dirty raincoat,
text: gets a big whiff of "crazy."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HISPANIC WOMAN
dialog: ...I knew it was you.
dialog: 
text: Logan moves past her, heads for his limo in line with others.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HISPANIC WOMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Please. I'm in trouble. You're the
dialog: only one who can help.
dialog: 
text: Logan looks at her as THE MOURNERS (his clients) come down
text: the hill toward the line of black vehicles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HISPANIC WOMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I need a hero.
dialog: 
text: Logan laughs as he pulls an umbrella from his trunk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Don't we all.
dialog: 
text: He turns to his clients, holding the umbrella over a sobbing
text: widow, escorting her to the door of his limo. The Hispanic
text: woman just stands there, rain soaking her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HISPANIC WOMAN
speaker_heading: (IN SPANISH)
dialog: What the hell happened to you?!
dialog: What are you hiding from?!
dialog: 
text: As Logan falls behind the wheel, he checks his clients in the
text: rear view and that's when there is a sudden screech--
dialog: 
text: THE FIAT makes a fast U-turn, nearly sideswiping him. And as
text: it swerves away, Logan glimpses THE FIGURE in the back
text: window. THE DARK-HAIRED GIRL IN A RED SLICKER, face a blur.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. EL PASO HOSPITAL -- MORNING
dialog: 
text: WIDE AS-- Logan pulls his stretch into a spot at A HOSPITAL
text: EMERGENCY ROOM ENTRANCE. He hurries through the rain, meeting
text: A LARGE MAN IN ORDERLY SCRUBS, smoking a vape under a canopy.
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The two talk for a moment, Logan hands the man cash and the
text: man toys with handing Logan a bag, pulls it away, demanding
text: more money. They argue.
dialog: 
text: REVERSE TO REVEAL-- A MAN IN A JEEP, WATCHING through the
text: rain, HIS METAL HAND ON THE WHEEL.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LOGAN'S LIMO -- OUTSIDE HOSPITAL -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Logan, now carrying the bag, hurries through the rain to his
text: Limo. He climbs inside starts it up but is startled by the
text: back door opening and closing. Logan spins to face --
dialog: 
text: A SMILING MAN in the back of his stretch. This is Donald
text: Pierce, 35. A southern boy, smooth and playful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: As I live and breathe. The
dialog: Wolverine. And he's a junkie now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Who the fuck are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: Y'know, you got some buckshot in
dialog: your door.
dialog: (plays with the liquor
dialog: bottles in back)
dialog: I heard you were in Phoenix.
dialog: Food's better there by the way. But
dialog: then, last night, some friends in
dialog: Texas H-P called, told me they
dialog: found three dead cholos in a
dialog: pullout out on 54. Not unusual,
dialog: except one was missing a hand.
text: Another a leg. Multiple parallel
dialog: lacerations. Slashes, femoral,
dialog: thoracic. So, they're thinking it
dialog: was either an escaped Tiger or
dialog: Freddy Krueger... but neither of
dialog: those can drive, one being
dialog: fictional the other extinct. And
dialog: since the wheel lugs they found
dialog: belong to a `24 Gauntlet--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Get out. Now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: Has she found you yet? ...Gabriela?
dialog: (off Logan's blank look)
dialog: See, I'm not looking for you,
dialog: mutey. Not really. I'm looking for
dialog: someone who's looking for you.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 8.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIERCE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: She took something of mine.
dialog: Something for which I am
dialog: responsible. When I wasn't looking.
dialog: Mexican lady. Long hair, long legs,
dialog: Long gone. Has her sights on you.
dialog: (off Logan's glare)
dialog: No bells?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: I don't know any Gabriela.
dialog: So get the fuck out.
dialog: 
text: Pierce just smiles, unfazed, then shifts his gaze to Logan's
text: bag of pills. Peering in, quasi-conspiratorial:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: I know what you're hiding, amigo.
dialog: Cue ball south of the border?
dialog: 
text: Logan tenses, says nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: What do you want?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: A little ...cooperation.
dialog: 
text: Flicks a business card.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIERCE (CONT'D)
dialog: If she does find you.
dialog: 
text: Then Pierce exits. Crosses in the rain to a Custom Ram Truck,
text: Logan looks to the card:
dialog: 
scene_heading: DONALD PIERCE -- CHIEF OF SECURITY
scene_heading: TRANSIGEN RESEARCH, A DIVISION OF ALKALI
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CORDOVA BRIDGE - BORDER - MORNING
dialog: 
text: A HUGE FUCKING WALL. "YOU ARE NOW LEAVING THE UNITED STATES"
text: says the sign mounted on top of it. Brown muted light pushes
text: through the haze over the factories on the Mexican side.
dialog: 
text: An agitated Logan in border traffic, talking on his phone as
text: he eyes the CAMERAS watching him:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Mr. Espiranza, yes, I know I said
dialog: June, but I want the boat now. Yes.
dialog: Why does that mean the price go up?
speaker_heading: (FRUSTRATED)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 9.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes, I know you wanted seventy, but
dialog: I am telling you I have 45 cash
dialog: now. Just bring it to port in Baja.
dialog: 
text: The seller HANGS UP. Logan sighs. Logan squints at the Penny
text: Saver on his seat, a listing for a Sunseeker circled when a
text: CAR HORN blares. Logan inches forward moving past--
dialog: 
text: A semi pulling A LIVESTOCK TRAILER loaded with sad looking
text: horses. EL RIO MEATS painted on the side.
dialog: 
text: A BORDER AGENT nods cheerfully at Logan, recognizing him.
text: Waves him on. And that's when we see --
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE WOMAN FROM THE CEMETERY (GABRIELA) WATCHING HIM FROM
text: BEHIND THE WHEEL OF HER FIAT. At a distance. She considers
text: following him, then swings her car around.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CIUDAD JUAREZ - HIGHWAY 45 -- MORNING
dialog: 
text: Logan drives through littered Mexican streets. Cinderblock
text: structures pocked with bullet holes, metal shutters pulled.
dialog: 
text: He merges onto Highway 45, heading for the desert.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED SMELTING PLANT - DAY
dialog: 
text: A vista of dirt, bisected by train tracks and fence. Logan
text: slows as he approaches A GATE. Beyond the gate, AN ABANDONED
text: SMELTING PLANT. Logan exits, pulls keys, unlocks the gate.
dialog: 
text: A CART WITH A PROPANE TANK STOPS as the limo comes up the
text: road. Camera reveals the cart is pushed by A TALL MAN in a
text: wide hat, sunglasses and gloves. He wipes his ghost-pale
text: brow. This is CALIBAN, an albino mutant in his 60's with more
text: than a passing resemblance to Edvard Munch's THE SCREAM.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SMELTING PLANT -- "KITCHEN" - DAY
dialog: 
text: THE WINDOWS ARE PAPERED TO KEEP OUT SUNLIGHT. Caliban,
text: glasses, hat and gloves off, prepares a tray of food as Logan
text: enters. From somewhere, the sound of AN OLD MAN SHOUTING.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALIBAN
dialog: He's having a bad day.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: They're all bad days.
dialog: 
text: Logan tosses Caliban the bag. He peers in. Logan crosses to
dialog: find something to eat.
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 10.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALIBAN
dialog: He needed these six hours ago.
dialog: This is not enough, you know. It
dialog: won't last through the week.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: I'm working on it.
dialog: 
text: Caliban puts the bag of meds back in Logan's hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALIBAN
dialog: Your turn.
dialog: 
text: Logan sighs and crosses toward a cabinet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALIBAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You know, he told me last night
text: he's communicating with someone.
dialog: 
text: Caliban follows. The old man's voice getting louder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
text: He's not talking with anybody.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALIBAN
dialog: Don't be so sure. He had all these
dialog: details. I thought that tank was
dialog: supposed to provide some sort of
dialog: barrier. It's got all these cracks
dialog: in it. What good is that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Please stop.
dialog: 
text: Moving down a corridor, Logan opens a cabinet beside AN
text: EXTERIOR DOOR. Pulls out a box of SYRINGE KITS and restocks
text: the pills and a vial of liquid from the bag. Loads a syringe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALIBAN
text: He's been asking questions again.
text: He's trying to read my mind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
speaker_heading: (RE: MEDS)
dialog: That's what these are for.
dialog: 
text: Logan swings open the door and Caliban dodges the sudden
dialog: blast of sunlight as--
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED SMELTING PLANT -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Logan crosses beneath a catwalk toward A HUGE ROUND PLATED
text: TANK pitched over on its side. The old man's voice getting
text: louder. He spins open the hatch and steps inside--
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 11.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HUGE PLATED TANK -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Logan enters the space and find himself facing, AN OLD MAN IN
text: A WHEELCHAIR making circles around mattress. CHARLES XAVIER
text: in his 90s. Bearded, tufts of white on his pate. A small
text: radio plays music with alligator clips to a car battery.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Friends, I have Good News today!
dialog: It's not about what you do. It's
dialog: not about your deeds. You can't
dialog: live up to his rules. God knows you
dialog: can't. That's OK! We're imperfect!
dialog: 
text: Logan steps over a dumped tray of food, approaches Charles
text: with the meds. Charles swings his chair around him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES (CONT'D)
dialog: Make way, sir.
dialog: 
text: Logan steps into his path and Charles stops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES (CONT'D)
dialog: I said make way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
text: The new Quesalupa from Taco Bell.
dialog: Get it with chicken, get it with
dialog: steak. But with cheese baked right
dialog: in the shell it's the next big--
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Who are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: You know who I am.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: (sees the syringe)
dialog: The man who puts me to sleep.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: We could both use some sleep.
dialog: 
text: Logan proceeds to roll up Charles' sleeve, but Charles
text: resists and they struggle for control of the needle--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Charles, you're making this--
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 12.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Charles lunges for the needle and as Logan pulls it away,
text: CHARLES FALLS OUT OF THE CHAIR to the floor. He looks up at
text: Logan, enraged. A RINGING SOUND begins to rise...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: What are you fucking doing to me!?
dialog: 
text: A tremor suddenly shakes Charles' body. And now Logan is hit
text: with a PSIONIC BLAST. THE RINGING LOUD AND UNBEARABLE, like a
text: fork scraping his brain. Charles eyes are now blood red.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SMELTING PLANT FUEL TANK - DAY
dialog: 
text: Caliban, headed back to the kitchen, suddenly fights a kind
text: of induced paralysis, struggling to move, breathe--
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SMELTING PLANT FUEL TANK - DAY
dialog: 
text: Logan, pushing through the pain, pulls out the syringe and
text: INJECTS Charles. The medication immediately takes effect,
text: subduing the wave.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SMELTING PLANT FUEL TANK - DAY
dialog: 
text: Caliban is released as well, gulping for air.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SMELTING PLANT FUEL TANK - DAY
dialog: 
text: Charles lies still, staring up at Logan who shakes off the
text: effects of the wave, the ringing fading. He reaches down and
text: picks up the disoriented old man--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: How long have I been here?
dialog: 
text: Logan carries him to the bed and sets him down. Charles looks
text: around, in tears. Logan doesn't answer, dumps two pills into
text: his palm which he transfers to Charles' hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES (CONT'D)
dialog: What are these?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: You remember what they are. The
dialog: shots mellow the seizures, the
dialog: pills keep them from happening.
dialog: 
text: Charles stares at the pills.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: How `bout you blow on them to make
dialog: them safe.
dialog: 
text: Charles looks up at Logan.
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 13.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Fuck off, Logan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: So you know who I am now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I always know who you are.
dialog: Sometimes I just don't recognize you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Take the pills.
dialog: 
text: Charles pops them in his mouth, swallows them. Logan starts
text: to clean up the spilled dinner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES

speaker_heading: CHARLES
text: A speciation.
speaker_heading: (THEN)

speaker_heading: CHARLES

speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: You always thought we were part of

dialog: 
text: Charles touches Logan's face. A tender moment until--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: What a disappointment you are.
dialog: 
text: Logan takes this in. Stung.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES (CONT'D)
dialog: When I found you, you were pursuing

speaker_heading: LOGAN

speaker_heading: CHARLES
text: A warm capper to life as an

speaker_heading: CHARLES (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: LOGAN

scene_heading: INT. LOGAN'S BEDROOM -- SMELTING PLANT -- LATE DAY
dialog: 
text: A SERIES OF SHOTS-- Logan on his back, unable to sleep, the
text: sun hitting his face through a soot covered window as he
text: stares hard at the Penny Saver boat listings: La Serenata.
dialog: 
text: He tosses the Pennysaver. Paces like a panther. Shirtless,
text: scarred. He stops, looks at his right hand, flexes it, stiff,
text: arthritic, knuckles swollen, the slits moist.
dialog: 
text: He forces his claws out. They come slow. Painfully. Middle
text: one lagging. He grabs the middle claw with his other hand and
text: pulls it hard, slicing into his palm, blood flowing.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SMELTING PLANT -- SUNSET
dialog: 
text: Stumbling in fading light, his palm wrapped with a rag, Logan

scene_heading: INT. SMELTING PLANT KITCHEN - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CALIBAN
dialog: I don't want to fight but we need
dialog: to talk about these things. There
dialog: are things.
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 16.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: What things.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALIBAN
dialog: Well. Would it be considered
dialog: nagging if repeated my observation
dialog: that the dose is too low. To
dialog: suppress the seizures.
dialog: 
text: He shakes a near an empty pill bottle and puts it on the
text: table. Logan examines it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: It's what the guy gave me. I wasn't
text: in a position to make demands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALIBAN
dialog: I almost died this morning. That
dialog: seizure was a--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: It wasn't even a minute.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALIBAN
dialog: It felt a lot longer than a minute.
dialog: I couldn't breathe. I was in a
dialog: terrible state. You're less
dialog: affected, Logan-- Please don't give
dialog: me that look. You know he needs a
dialog: higher dose. And I know you've got
text: more money squirreled away.
dialog: 
text: A red light blinks on the loading dock. Logan glares at
text: Caliban as a rumble rises.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: That money's to get us out of here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALIBAN
dialog: No. Not us. You and him. You're
dialog: saving up for a bloody Sunseeker. I
dialog: don't see myself hiding below deck
dialog: like Nosferatu, doing laundry, do
dialog: you? ...Folding your underwear.
text: Making pigs in a blanket.
dialog: 
text: Out another window we see-- A FREIGHT TRAIN PASSES.
dialog:

speaker_heading: CALIBAN (CONT'D)
dialog: This was in your pocket.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALIBAN
dialog: A year ago, you asked me to help
dialog: you. And God knows I try but I
dialog: can't help you, not really, if you
dialog: don't talk to me. I hear you at
dialog: night. You aren't sleeping. You
dialog: don't want to talk about that. Or
dialog: the booze you're drinking or the
dialog: pus you keep wiping from your
dialog: knuckles or the blood I wash from
dialog: your clothes or those brand new
dialog: holes in your chest, that haven't
dialog: healed. And I very much doubt you
dialog: want to talk about the fact that
dialog: you can't read the label on the
dialog: side of that bottle.
dialog: (re: the vial)
dialog: It's Ibuprofen.
dialog: 
text: Logan stares at the bottle, humiliated. Suddenly, he kicks
text: back his chair and, off Caliban's nervous expression, slaps
text: his cup out of his hands. It shatters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALIBAN (CONT'D)
dialog: That was my favorite mug.
dialog: 
text: Logan crosses to his coat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALIBAN (CONT'D)

dialog: 
text: HIS PHONE BUZZES-- Logan squints at what looks like a new

dialog: 
text: As he walks into the courtyard, he can see that she is brown

speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Sightings.

speaker_heading: GABRIELA

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: And by people, you mean fat

speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: When did that happen?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GABRIELA
dialog: This morning. Near the border. I

dialog: my car now.
dialog: 
text: She reaches for the NIGHT STAND, pries open its cheap side

speaker_heading: GABRIELA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: LOGAN

speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: I got a job that's gonna pay enough

scene_heading: EXT. LIBERTY MOTEL ALLEY AND ROAD -- DAWN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Ready to go?
dialog: 
text: But he gets no answer, his eyes finding the splintered wood

scene_heading: INT. LIBERTY MOTEL ROOM - MORNING

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: ...Fuck.
dialog: 
text: Logan makes a sweep of the room. Then recalls --
dialog: 
text: The NIGHT STAND. Pries the side panel free. There, wedged in

dialog: 
dialog: Sees her last text was to him. "Please hurry..."
text: He pockets the phone.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LIBERTY MOTEL - MORNING - RAIN
dialog: 
text: Logan closes the door behind him and steps into the rain,
text: scanning the lot. No sign of the girl anywhere.
dialog: 
text: He looks down, noticing gouges on the concrete, slashes,
text: filling with rain and blood. Then he spots --
dialog: 
text: A BLOODY CYBORG FINGER on the pavement. High Tech. Severed at

speaker_heading: CALIBAN
dialog: Hello! Logan! --What happened?
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. SMELTING PLANT -- A MOMENT LATER
dialog: 
text: Caliban reaches, ABOUT TO SHUT THE TRUNK-- WHEN LOGAN'S HAND

speaker_heading: CALIBAN
dialog: ...Who does that belong to?

speaker_heading: LOGAN

dialog: Go. Inside.
dialog: 
text: Caliban shuffles away as--

speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You need to turn around, asshole.
dialog: This is private property.

speaker_heading: PIERCE

speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: What girl.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: One that goes with that ball you're
dialog: holding. That's special rubber, you
dialog: know. Coated with something called
text: J-Tek. Gets in through the skin.
speaker_heading: (FAUX SERIOUS)
dialog: Very calming. Like Magnesium but

speaker_heading: (SMILES)
dialog: You feel calmer?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: There's no girl here.
dialog: 
dialog: Another laugh, then--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: I know you went to the motel.

speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: I was called there. There was no

speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: "The woman".
speaker_heading: (SIGHS)
dialog: Such as she was.
speaker_heading: (LOOKS UP)
dialog: So you saw Gabriela but you didn't

speaker_heading: LOGAN

speaker_heading: BEEN ENHANCED--
dialog: 
text: Out of nowhere A SOUND A LOT LIKE A BOOMERANG as A LEAD PIPE -
text: -- THWAP -- HITS PIERCE IN THE HEAD-- AND DOWN HE GOES.
dialog: 
text: Logan turns, stunned to see--
dialog: 
text: THE GIRL standing by an out-building.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Hey!
dialog: 
text: She looks at Logan, THEN SUDDENLY WINGS ANOTHER PIPE AT HIM.
text: Logan watches it come and CATCHES IT, about to wing it back
speaker_heading: WHEN--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Logan.
dialog: 
text: Logan turns to see Charles in his chair at the door of the
text: main building. Looks better than usual. Caliban behind him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES (CONT'D)
text: Logan. Caliban. This is Laura.
dialog: 
text: He then smiles at the girl...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (IN SPANISH)
dialog: We've been waiting for you.
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 28.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He motions for her to come inside. Caliban looks to Logan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES (CONT'D)
dialog: This way, child. Come here, Laura.
dialog: 
text: The girl (LAURA) crosses, snatches her backpack from Logan,
text: then steps over Pierce and crosses to Charles.
dialog: 
text: Bewildered, Logan kneels pulls a GUN from Pierce's waistband.
text: He hands it to Caliban who lands beside him, taking in the
text: cyborg hand and the tattoo on Pierce's neck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALIBAN
dialog: Looks like Ex-military. Maybe a
dialog: bounty hunter?
dialog: 
text: He hands Caliban Don Pierce's business card.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Worse.
dialog: 
text: Caliban reads Alkali on the card.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALIBAN
dialog: He's by himself?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Not for long.
speaker_heading: (THINKING)
dialog: Get him back in his ride. Drive him
dialog: to the wash and dump him. Then take
text: the car into Juarez, leave it for
text: the vultures.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALIBAN
dialog: What if he wakes up before I get
dialog: there?
dialog: 
text: He hands Caliban the gun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Text me where you are and we'll
dialog: pick you up.

scene_heading: INT. SMELTING PLANT KITCHEN - LATER - DAY
dialog: 
text: Logan enters with a duffle, shoving supplies in it. He
speaker_heading: WATCHES AS--
dialog: 
text: Charles sits beside "Laura" as she ravenously eats a bowl of
text: cereal. Charles speaks to her gently.
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 29.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: You did what you could, Laura.
dialog: (she looks at him)
dialog: Well. Yes. Of course, it's painful.
dialog: 
text: Logan eyes LAURA'S BACKPACK which she keeps close. He grabs
text: it but Laura stands, holding the strap. Logan shoves her
text: down. She grabs his arm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: You'll get it back-- after I figure
dialog: out what you and your mother have
dialog: got us into.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Logan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: What.
dialog: 
text: Logan peers in her bag, notices files, a toy horse and comic
text: book. He winces, looks up as Charles wheels over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: That wasn't her mother you met.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
text: So she talks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: We're communicating.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: (hands him pills)
dialog: Take them-- Now.
dialog: (goes back to packing)
dialog: We have to go. Leave. It isn't safe
dialog: here anymore. And you can't have an
dialog: attack out there. Understand?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: (swallows the pills)
dialog: She's the mutant I told you about.
dialog: The one we have to help.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: She's not a mutant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Yes, she is.
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 30.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: (crossing to a duffel)
dialog: What's her gift, eating? Pipe
dialog: throwing?
dialog: 
text: Logan is interrupted by A LOUD RUMBLE AS THE NIGHTLY FREIGHT
text: TRAIN APPROACHES. Laura bolts up from the table. Charles
text: reaches out for her...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: It's alright, Laura. It's only a
dialog: train. A choo choo.
dialog: 
text: He nods to the monitor. We see the FREIGHT TRAIN passing in
text: the distance. She stares at it. Like she's never seen one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
speaker_heading: (EXITING)
dialog: We gotta go.

scene_heading: INT. CALIBAN'S CAR - DAY
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT./EXT. CALIBAN'S CAR - MEXICAN ROAD - DAY
dialog: 
text: Caliban drags an unconscious Pierce out of the car. He moves
text: to exit, crosses to close the jeep's rear hatch when he HEARS
text: A SOFT RUMBLE. He looks off and sees...
dialog: 
text: ALL TERRAIN VEHICLES IN THE DISTANCE. Lots of them.
dialog: 
text: Caliban turns back to see Pierce standing by the driver door.
text: Grinning... He reaches for the gun on the dash and cocks it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: You're fucked now, mutey.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED SMELTING PLANT - DAY
dialog: 
text: As Logan shoves the last of the packed bags, and whatever
text: else he's grabbed, into the trunk. THE SAME RUMBLE. He looks
text: up at -- a cloud of silt rising on the horizon.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SMELTING PLANT KITCHEN - DAY
dialog: 
text: As Laura hears the rumble and stands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: It's alright. It's just another--
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 31.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: (coming in the door)
dialog: --it's not a train. We gotta go!
dialog: 
text: Out the window, FOUR BLACK FEDERALE TRUCKS approach in a
text: cloud of dust. Armed men in black hang onto the vehicles.
text: Behind the trucks, THE SAME FOUR LARGE CUSTOM ALL TERRAIN
text: VEHICLES. A different type of men are on board these,
text: mercenaries, in full tactical gear.
dialog: 
dialog: NOTE -- We'll call the mercenaries riding behind the
text: Federales, THE REAVERS. They outclass the Federales with
text: their weapons, vehicles, armor and skill. Many have
text: weaponized appendages where missing limbs should be.
dialog: 
text: Logan takes hold of Charles' wheelchair, pushing him to the
text: door. He passes Laura, points at her, an order:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't move!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: (as he wheels out)
dialog: Don't be afraid, child.
dialog: He'll come back for you!
dialog: 
text: She looks at Logan, not so sure.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED SMELTING PLANT - DAY
dialog: 
text: Logan wheels a bouncing Charles rapidly out the door over the
text: gravel and rocks toward the limo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: ...bloody hell.
dialog: 
text: THE RUMBLE GETS LOUDER and Logan and Charles look up as-- THE
text: VEHICLES SMASH THROUGH THE GATE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES (CONT'D)
dialog: My God...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT./EXT. LIMO - ABANDONED SMELTING PLANT - DAY
dialog: 
text: -- as Logan lifts him into the back of the limo, throws the
text: wheelchair in the trunk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Logan!
dialog: 
text: Logan quickly unzips his duffel, grabs something else. The
text: Federales almost upon them. Charles yells at Logan as he
text: slams the trunk and returns to Charles' door.
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 32.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES (CONT'D)
dialog: Logan! You have to go back for her!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: She's not our problem.
dialog: 
text: Logan grabs a seat belt and hurriedly straps Charles in...
text: and doing so, surreptitiously pulls out a loaded hypodermic
text: and jams it into the old man's (numb) thigh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I know what you just did.
dialog: 
text: Logan jumps behind the wheel, turns it over, hits the gas--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: LOGAN!
dialog: 
text: From the opposite direction, THREE MORE TRUCKS LOADED WITH
text: FEDERALES and FOUR MERCENARIES ON DIRT BIKES, BLOCK THEM.
dialog: 
text: Logan stomps on the brakes and SLIDES TO A STOP.
dialog: 
text: A door opens and Donald Pierce steps out of his truck, his
text: suit now dusted from his earlier misadventure. Around him,
text: FEDERALES AND REAVERS ALL train their guns on the limo.
dialog: 
text: Jumping off one of the Federale Jeeps, A MEXICAN COMMANDER,
text: chest decorated with mid-level brass, orders his men to take
text: tactical positions surrounding the structures. He barks
text: orders in Spanish and holds a police sketch of Laura.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FEDERALE COMMANDER
dialog: Este es el mutante! Capturar o

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SMELTING PLANT KITCHEN - DAY
dialog: 
text: Laura sits at the table. She refills her bowl with cereal and
text: eats it methodically with her spoon, watching the stand-off
text: outside through the windows like a TV show.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT./EXT. LIMO - ABANDONED SMELTING PLANT - DAY
dialog: 
text: Logan watches as Pierce walks toward their limo. Charles
text: getting fuzzier in back, the meds kicking in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Logan...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: I'm thinking.
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 33.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
text: (raises a finger, dreamily)
dialog: The child, Logan. We mustn't forget
dialog: Laura. ...Logan...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: (eyeing Pierce approaching)
dialog: Please be quiet.
dialog: 
text: Pierce arrives at the driver's side window, sees Charles in
text: back, smiles down at the old man smiling back at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: Ah, Charles Xavier. The most wanted
dialog: octogenarian in North America--
dialog: 
text: Logan shoves the door open into Pierce, knocking him back.
text: THE SOUND OF MANY GUNS CLICKING AS THE FEDERALES TRAIN
text: WEAPONS ON LOGAN. But Logan gets in Pierce's face, fiery:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Where's Caliban?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: (rolls down window, loopy)
dialog: Excuse me. I'm a nonagenarian,
dialog: actually...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: How about you tell me where the
dialog: girl is first. Or maybe I ought to
text: ask the cue ball. Seems friendly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: I told you, she's not here.
dialog: Where's Caliban?!
dialog: 
text: Pierce smirks, amused by Logan's anger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: I left him in the same hole you
dialog: were going to leave me.
dialog: 
text: Logan loses it, lunges for him -- when someone hits Logan
text: from behind. Hard. And again. As Logan falls to his knees and
text: turns-- SNIKT-- AND SEPARATES A REAVER from his arm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
speaker_heading: (TO PIERCE)
dialog: You got extra barbecue tongs for
dialog: this guy?
dialog: 
text: THE FEDERALE COMMANDER nods.
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 34.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: AND A SWARM OF FEDERALES ATTACK LOGAN WITH RIFLE BUTTS AND
text: BOOTS AND BEAT HIM TO THE GROUND. There are too many.
dialog: 
text: Pummeled, overwhelmed, his limbs all pinned, Logan turns over
text: to find PIERCE'S FOOT TO HIS THROAT. Pierce leans down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: Jesus. Seeing you this way,
dialog: Wolverine, it breaks my heart.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: As soon as I rip it out of your
dialog: chest, fuck-stick.
dialog: 
text: Pierce smiles, then nods to one of the Reavers (Mohawk) who
text: jumps off his bike and advances toward a side door of the
text: Smelting Plant. He's carrying a STEEL RESTRAINING COLLAR.
dialog: 
text: The Federale Commander shouts to Pierce.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FEDERALE COMMANDER
speaker_heading: (IN SPANISH)
dialog: No one goes in without Federale
dialog: escort. I am in charge.
dialog: 
text: Mohawk pauses. The Commander dispatches two of his Federales
text: to lead him inside, weapons drawn.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SMELTING PLANT KITCHEN - DAY
dialog: 
text: THE DOOR OPENS as MOHAWK AND THE TWO FEDERALES creep into the
text: dark room adjacent to the kitchen, advancing toward--
dialog: 
text: Laura at the kitchen table, her back to them. She seems
text: oblivious as she pours more cereal, eats with her spoon.
dialog: 
text: One of the Federales accidentally kicks a bottle and Laura
text: pauses her spoon in the air.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED SMELTING PLANT - DAY
dialog: 
text: ON LOGAN, watching. Charles, watching.
dialog: 
text: SUDDENLY, THERE ARE SCREAMS FROM INSIDE THE STRUCTURE. Men's
text: screams. Then it is quiet. Everyone turns as --
dialog: 
text: Creeaaak. A STEEL DOOR OPENS WIDE. LAURA steps from the dark
text: into the blazing light. She SQUINTS.
dialog: 
text: Pierce steps off Logan, having found his quarry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: That-a-girl.
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 35.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: --and now LAURA BOOTS SOMETHING which rolls to Pierce's feet.
dialog: 
text: Pierce and the Federale Commander look down at--
text: A SEVERED HEAD. WITH A MOHAWK.
dialog: 
text: THEN SHE TOSSES THE STEEL RESTRAINT COLLAR TO THE DIRT.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIERCE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (SIGHS)
dialog: ...Laura.
dialog: 
text: ON LOGAN -- Pulling himself up from the ground as--
dialog: 
text: LAURA-- continues walking toward Pierce. Hands at her sides.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIERCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Laura. Stay where you are. You want
dialog: to see your friends, right?
dialog: 
text: ON PIERCE-- as he nods to the REAVERS to prepare to take her.
dialog: 
text: A CYBORG-LEGGED REAVER OPENS THE DOORS OF A CONTAINMENT TANK
text: in back of one of their vehicles. Yet another REAVER (PRETTY
text: BOY, not) assembles A SAVAGE HARPOON AND RESTRAINT SYSTEM.
dialog: 
text: But the Federale Commander suddenly orders his men to --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FEDERALE COMMANDER
dialog: Tomar el mutante!
dialog: 
text: AND THE CIRCLE OF FEDERALES MOVE IN ON LAURA.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: Commander, stop!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FEDERALE COMMANDER
dialog: You said alive or dead.
dialog: 
text: SNIKT! -- BLOODY CLAWS EXTEND FROM LAURA'S KNUCKLES.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: Laura! NO! NO!!
dialog: 
text: ON LOGAN-- He reacts to the claws. In shock. Cannot believe
text: what he's seeing. With the attention on Laura, Logan starts
text: moving, limping, back to the limo. His eyes meet--
dialog: 
text: Laura's. A moment of mutual recognition. It breaks as she
text: turns to face the Federales.
dialog: 
text: ON CHARLES-- who, struggling against the meds, presses
text: himself against the glass, staring at Laura.
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 36.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: ...My Lord.
dialog: 
text: BACK TO LAURA AS -- THE FEDERALES LUNGE AT HER and, sadly for
text: them, Laura leaps in the air and becomes a whirling dervish
text: of death. Limbs and weapons sliced from her attackers like a
text: topiary. Guns fire to no effect as Laura evades the shots.
dialog: 
dialog: This little girl has been created, designed and trained for
dialog: one thing and one thing only: killing. And she's a virtuoso.
dialog: 
text: This wave dispatched, LAURA FLEES, HIDES BEHIND THE CATWALK
text: SUPPORTS. The armed Federales hunt for her among the supports
text: and she starts picking them off, one by one, with her blades
text: and even with their own guns.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, Laura is pinned against a concrete wall by A MUSCLE
text: BOUND REAVER. With an acrobatic move, she boots him in the
text: nuts and leaps over him, manages to run as--
dialog: 
text: PRETTY BOY FIRES THE HARPOON GUN, retracts the cable and pins
text: her to the ground. REAVERS AND FEDERALES SURROUND HER and
text: PRETTY BOY is about to put on the restraints when--
dialog: 
text: SNIKT! -- LOGAN GUTS PRETTY BOY FROM BEHIND-- AND ENGAGES THE
text: OTHERS as Laura pulls the harpoon from her side and runs.
dialog: 
text: Laura is grabbed by THREE MORE REAVERS, WHO RESTRAIN HER AND
text: STARTS TO DRAG HER AWAY -- BUT, SNIKT! --
dialog: 
text: TWO ADAMANTIUM FOOT CLAWS EMERGE FROM HER FEET dragging on
text: the concrete, making a ringing sound, like chalk on a black
text: board and -- suddenly -- with a double scissor-kick -- she
text: stabs one Reaver in the thigh and the other in the throat,
text: her gleaming foot claw sticking out the back of his neck.
dialog: 
text: Logan stares, slack-jawed. Then notices--
dialog: 
text: PIERCE AND ANOTHER REAVER are moving on the limo, about to
text: take Charles. Logan tosses them back and--
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT./EXT. LIMO - ABANDONED SMELTING PLANT - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Logan drops behind the wheel, watching through the windshield
text: as Laura takes on six or seven more hostiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: (drunk with the meds)
dialog: ...As I said, Logan, she's a
dialog: mutant... Like you. Very much like
dialog: you, in fact.
dialog: 
text: Logan grimly starts the engine.
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 37.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES (CONT'D)
dialog: Where are we going?
dialog: 
text: Logan ignores Charles as he put the limo in gear, gaining
text: speed, and then-- MAKES A HARD U-TURN AND --
dialog: 
text: WHAM! PLOWS INTO THE FEDERALES AND LAURA (WHO JUMPS ON THE
text: HOOD TO AVOID IMPACT).
dialog: 
text: Logan accelerates again, Laura clinging to the hood. Logan
text: punches a button, opening the sunroof as gunfire starts to
dialog: hit their limo.
dialog: 
text: Laura leaps into the limo. Charles smiles at her, pleased and
text: seemingly oblivious to the gunfire:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES (CONT'D)
dialog: Laura!
dialog: 
text: As they take a hard turn, a side window shatters and LAURA
text: INSTINCTIVELY SHIELDS CHARLES FROM THE BULLETS.
dialog: 
text: LAURA GETS HIT AND matter of factly sucks the slug out of her
text: arm and spits it on the seat like Lee Marvin.
dialog: 
text: Logan meets eyes with Charles in his rear view. And that's
text: when they are hit with A BARRAGE OF BULLETS--
dialog: 
scene_heading: WIDER -- SMELTING PLANT
dialog: 
text: THE FEDERALES HAVE LEAPT INTO THEIR JEEPS and fire at Logan's
text: limo as they spin out in the dirt, in pursuit.
dialog: 
text: Disgusted, Pierce also gets behind the wheel and leads his
text: Reavers in the opposite direction.
dialog: 
text: THE PLANT GATE BLOCKED BY THE ARMADA OF VEHICLES, Logan
text: drives straight at the chainlink fence-- and we prepare for a
dialog: classic action movie fence smash.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Hold on!
dialog: 
text: BUT THE LIMO HITS THE FENCE, BENDS THE SUPPORTS AND GRINDS TO
text: A PATHETIC HALT, TANGLED IN MESH. As it would in real life.
dialog: 
text: Federales open fire at the limo as Logan guns the engine in
text: reverse, trying to get traction on the dirt. Other Federales
text: speed toward them on motorcycles.
dialog: 
text: Under massive fire, bullet-riddled, Logan's limo finds
text: purchase, and he's backing out at high speed, ripping a long
text: section of chain link from its posts and dragging this "tail"
text: with him (driving backwards now).
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 38.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: LOGAN SWERVES HARD AND THE CHAIN LINK "TAIL" SWINGS OUT AND
text: WIPES OUT THE REAVER BIKES. One of the riders tumbles and
text: grabs onto the chain link tail, the limo dragging him.
dialog: 
text: The Reaver claws his way along the chain link toward the hood
text: of the car, drawing his gun, firing at the windshield.
dialog: 
text: Logan ducks and spins the car around. The dragging fence
text: swings wide, LOSING THE REAVER ON THE FENCE.
dialog: 
text: Pierce angrily peels his truck in another direction.
dialog: 
text: Logan sees the main gate ahead. As he guns for it, he notices
text: THE FLASHING RED TRAIN-WARNING LIGHTS at the loading dock.
dialog: 
text: TWO FEDERALE JEEPS reach the sides of the limo, guns aimed
text: squarely at Logan. Laura and Charles react as--
dialog: 
text: Logan steers the limo through a series of concrete structures
text: FORCING THE JEEPS INTO VIOLENT COLLISIONS.
dialog: 
text: Logan guns his limo into--
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OPEN DESERT - DAY
dialog: 
scene_heading: LOGAN'S LIMO RACES FROM THE PLANT GROUNDS, APPROACHING--
dialog: 
text: A HULKING FREIGHT TRAIN arriving quickly from parallel
text: tracks. The train is moving faster than the limo.
dialog: 
text: Logan makes a hard left, cranking the wheel just clipping the
text: front corner of Pierce's truck, spinning toward the tracks.
dialog: 
text: THE TRAIN HAS ALMOST CAUGHT UP WITH THEM AS--
dialog: 
text: THE LIMO PLOWS STRAIGHT INTO THE SIDE OF A FEDERALE TRUCK
text: which gets squeezed between the limo and train. Sparks fly.
dialog: 
text: LOGAN SPINS THE WHEEL, PUSHING THE TRUCK (and the Federale
text: Commander in it) INTO THE PATH OF THE TRAIN AS--
dialog: 
text: LOGAN GUNS HIS LIMO ACROSS THE TRACKS ITS REAR END PINGED BY
scene_heading: THE LOCOMOTIVE-- AND THE FEDERALE TRUCK OBLITERATED.
dialog: 
text: LOGAN'S LIMO COMES TO A STOP ON THE OTHER SIDE. Logan looks
text: back through the moving freight cars at--
dialog: 
text: Pierce and the remaining Reavers, stuck until it passes.

text: Logan's eyes darting to his rearview, peeled for any sign of
text: Reavers. He glances back at --
dialog: 
text: LAURA, beside Charles, her gaze fixed out the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Who the fuck are you?
dialog: 
text: Laura slowly turns, acknowledging Logan's existence.

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: You know who she is, Logan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: No. I don't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Does she remind you of anybody?

dialog: 
text: He turns as the DOOR IS OPENED and A SERIOUSLY INJURED
text: CALIBAN is carried inside and shoved into a chair. He's
text: hooked up to an IV, his head is covered with a HOOD.
dialog: 
text: Pierce rips off the hood and slaps Caliban's battered face.

speaker_heading: PIERCE
text: Wakey wakey.

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIERCE (CONT'D)
dialog: You know, I read about you when I
dialog: was a kid. You tracked that crazy
dialog: gilled mutey fishy motherfuck, what
dialog: was his name, Wave?
dialog: (flutters his metal digits)
text: Tracked him halfway `cross the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALIBAN
dialog: I'm sorry. I believe you're

speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: 'I'm not mistaken, you used to work

speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You do know this is bullshit,

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OKLAHOMA CITY - SIDE STREET - DAY
dialog: 
text: Shitty block. Graffiti everywhere. A GANG OF YOUNG THUGS hang
text: beneath the interstate overpass.
dialog: 
text: Logan gets out of his limo, checks the back, sees a couple
text: more of Laura's UNCANNY X-MEN COMICS lying on the bench.
text: Grabs them. Checks that's everything. Then finds several of
text: Charles pills wedged in the car seat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: ...Fuck.
dialog: 
text: He slams the door, walking past THE THUGS, tossing them the
speaker_heading: LIMO KEYS.

speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Knock yourselves out.
dialog: 
text: Walking toward the car lot, Logan eyes the cars in the lot

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: I know the finish looks beat but
dialog: it's a `19, got less than sixty on

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN

speaker_heading: LOGAN

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BAR - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
dialog: 
text: Logan sits, glancing at the television news, sipping a high

text: images weigh on Logan. He downs his drink and shuts the
text: comic, then he sees another XMEN COMIC.
dialog: 
text: His face becomes grim as he stares at THE COVER. It features
text: a DRAMATIC MUTANT TREK INTO THE MOUNTAINS. The title: "EXODUS

dialog: 
text: On the cover and pages to follow, THOUSANDS OF MUTANTS,
text: FLEEING OPPRESSION, UNDER ATTACK, headed for a place called

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Jesus Christ...
dialog: 
text: Logan turns the page where it is revealed-- "EDEN" IT'S A

dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 56.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "AMERICA, NO LONGER SAFE FOR MUTANTS! OUR HEROES FIND REFUGE
text: IN EDEN: LAST STOP ON THE MUTANT UNDERGROUND TO CANADA!"
dialog: 
text: AN INSET ON A SPLASH PAGE SHOWS A MAPPING DEVICE IN XAVIER'S
text: HAND. On the screen, a series of numbers, coordinates.
dialog: 
text: Logan blinks, looking at the cash envelope he got from
text: Gabriela. The exact same numbers are scrawled on it below the
text: fire road address. Logan glares, taking in the bald fact that
text: Eden is an imaginary place in a forty year old comic book.

scene_heading: EXT. OKLAHOMA CITY CASINO/HOTEL - VALET - LATE DAY

speaker_heading: VALET
dialog: Sir? Are the keys in it?
dialog: 
text: That's when he sees-- A MAN WITH A PROSTHETIC (CYBORG) HAND
text: standing at the entrance, talking in a cell phone.
dialog: 
text: Alarmed, Logan rounds the corner, moving past--
dialog: 
text: A HOTEL GARDENER with a hedge trimmer, touching up a shrub.
text: Looking for a side entrance, Logan passes other patrons, but
text: as he does, he clocks--
dialog: 
text: BLACK VEHICLES parked in a service entrance. And that's when
text: it hits-- A RINGING SOUND. A SCREECH and Logan turns to see --
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 57.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: CARS CRASHING INTO EACH OTHER ON THE STREET. He turns back to
text: see the Worker unconscious on the ground, the hedge trimmer

dialog: 
text: THE RINGING GETS LOUDER. Casino patrons are frozen in place,

dialog: 
text: We see LOGAN OUT THE WINDSHIELD as he moves toward the casino

text: CHOKING FOR AIR. In the bg, a battered burned Caliban is also
text: paralyzed by the wave, vibrating in his restraints.
dialog: 
text: We see on the console monitor, video feeds of body cams,

scene_heading: INT. OKLAHOMA CITY CASINO/HOTEL -- LOBBY -- LATE DAY
dialog: 
text: The RINGING LOUDER YET as Logan stumbles through the lobby

scene_heading: SNIKT! -- LOGAN'S TARNISHED CLAWS EMERGE AND --

scene_heading: INT. REAVERS COMMAND TRUCK -- LATE DAY

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OKLAHOMA CITY CASINO/HOTEL -- SUITE -- LATE DAY
dialog: 
text: Logan pushes through THE DOOR TO FIND-- A SURREAL SCENE:
text: THREE MORE REAVERS FROZEN IN MID ATTACK. The room service
text: cart up-ended.
dialog: 
text: CHARLES sits slumped in his chair, near the window, mouth in
text: a rictus-like grimace, body quivering, rippling waves of
text: force emanating from his skull.
dialog: 
text: LAURA, HER CLAWS OUT, is on the floor, semi-paralyzed,
text: struggling to pull herself toward Charles' meds. She reaches
text: the hypodermic, attempts to hand it to --
dialog: 
text: Logan who falls to his knees from the shrieking wave. He
text: fumbles, almost dropping it, eyes starting to roll up in his
text: own head as he lunges and jams the needle into Charles' neck.
dialog: 
text: After a moment, RINGING stops -- Logan falls back-- the
text: remaining Reavers fall to the ground and, as they gasp for
text: air, Laura and Logan kill them all. Brutal.
dialog: 
text: Charles is spent dazed, gasping for air.
dialog: 
text: Logan peers down at one of the dead Reavers, checking him
text: out, peering into his BODYCAM.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN

dialog: 
text: Bouncing in his chair, Charles stares at the suffering around

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: This way!
dialog: 
text: Logan lifts Charles into the back seat, throws the chair in

dialog: 
text: The camera pans with them as they depart, then finds--
dialog: 
text: SEVERAL REAVER VEHICLES parked at the side of the building.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MOVING IN ON -- THE REAVER COMMAND TRUCK. THE BACK DOORS

speaker_heading: PIERCE

dialog: 
text: Logan climbs out of the pick up and approaches the father,

speaker_heading: MOTHER (CONT'D)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKSON
text: Evening, Mr. Munson.

text: Will just nods.

speaker_heading: JACKSON (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: And I have a lawyer now--

speaker_heading: JACKSON
speaker_heading: TWO--
dialog:

speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Three.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: ...Don't wake her yet. Let her have

dialog:

dialog:

dialog: 
text: On the floor, LAURA OPENS HER EYES.
dialog: 
text: Charles LOOKS UP FROM HIS WOUND, blood coming. He tries to

scene_heading: PERFECT DOUBLE OF LOGAN.
dialog: 
dialog: For simplicity's sake, let's call this creature BAD LOGAN.
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 86.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He will also be referenced as "X-24", his model number. He
text: is a younger, stronger, clone of The Wolverine. Feral, he
text: moves in a slight crouch. He is not the absence of emotion
text: but rather, the presence of it, most noticeably, rage.
dialog: 
text: LAURA FLIES AT BAD LOGAN, SHRIEKING, landing on his back,
text: gouging his flesh. He spins, trying to shake her, swiping at
text: his back with his blades. He stumbles across the room and

text: on the floor, claws covered in blood. Then he looks to BAD
scene_heading: LOGAN-- AND LUNGES--

dialog: 
text: LOGAN RAISES HIS CLAWS AND, with all his strength, struggles
text: to hold back X-24 PRESSING DOWN, THEIR BLADES INTERLOCKED.
dialog:

text: BOOM! SHOT IN THE CHEST, torso exploding.
dialog: BOOM! SHOT IN THE NECK!

speaker_heading: RICE
dialog: You did fine, twenty four. Breathe.
dialog: You're healing. You did well.
dialog: You're a newborn by any measure.
dialog: Just breathe. Your body has work to

dialog: help with the pain.
dialog: 
text: He takes out A SILVER INJECTION GUN WITH A VIAL ATTACHED and

dialog: 
text: "WELCOME TO WYOMING."
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STAND OF TREES, OFF THE ROAD - WYOMING LAKE - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Overlooking a small lake. LOGAN finishes covering CHARLES'
text: GRAVE. Its physically hard for him to do this. Now he stands
text: there, trying to think of what to say. He looks at--
dialog: 
text: LAURA, on the other side of the grave, a few steps back. She
text: takes her sunglasses off. Takes the ear buds out of her ears.
text: Ready to hear his words.
dialog: 
text: BACK TO-- LOGAN. He looks back at the grave, then out at the
text: lake. Clears his throat. His eyes are sallow, his skin pale.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Well. It's got water and... it's...
dialog: 
text: Logan just halts. He looks down and sees-- Laura, taking his
text: hand in hers, the same way that Kathryn did with Will at the
text: farmhouse. She looks up at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: --its got water and it's --
dialog: 
text: Unable to contain himself, Logan pulls back his hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: ...Fuck this...
dialog: 
text: He starts away, limping, with the shovel. Only now do we
text: realize just how ravaged Logan's body still is from his
text: battle with X-24. Blood stains everywhere.
dialog: 
text: Laura stands there, staring as--
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 96.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Logan stumbles to the equally ravaged pick up truck. He
text: tosses the shovel in back and grunts something at Laura like
text: "come on!" When she doesn't move, he curses and gets in the
text: truck but it won't turn over. He starts cursing again and
text: gets out and pops the hood.
dialog: 
text: A dog barks. Laura looks out across the landscape.
dialog: 
text: Downstream a quarter mile, A MAN crosses from a STATION WAGON
text: with his labrador, pole on his shoulder, tackle box in hand.
dialog: 
text: Laura looks back down to Logan.
text: He has collapses in front of the car in a heap.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. URGENT CARE CENTER - TREATMENT ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Logan lies, hooked to an IV on a small bed. He coughs and
text: opens his eyes. He is in the examination room of some sort of
text: small town walk-in clinic. The place is decorated in a Rocky
text: Mountain style. Out the windows, granite peaks. An Old Doctor
text: stands over him. He has a soulful face, a bolo tie and big
text: belt buckle. Reminds one of Richard Farnsworth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLD DOCTOR
dialog: Welcome back. I was starting to
dialog: think I was gonna have to tell that
text: nice little girl out in the waiting
dialog: room that her daddy's gone.
dialog: 
text: Logan notices the EKG monitor connected to him. The Doctor
text: sits down and smiles...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLD DOCTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: I always hoped I would get a chance
dialog: to meet someone like you. There's
dialog: so few of you left.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN

dialog: need to get on my--
dialog: 
text: He tries to sit up, but the old doctor puts a hand on him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLD DOCTOR
dialog: What you need is rest... and
dialog: treatment. You need to check
dialog: yourself in somewhere and--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: --I'm alright. I'm fine.
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 97.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLD DOCTOR
dialog: No. You're not. I mean, I know
dialog: you're different. But that doesn't
dialog: change the fact that something
dialog: inside you is poisoning you. You
dialog: need to check yourself into a
dialog: hospital and run some tests, find
dialog: out what it is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: ...I know what it is.

scene_heading: INT. URGENT CARE CENTER - WAITING ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Logan limps into the waiting area. Laura is sitting there.
text: A Nurse looks up as the Doctor emerges, right behind him--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLD DOCTOR
dialog: Please. Mister. If you don't want
dialog: to go to a hospital, maybe I can--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: --Doc. Look at me. You seem like a
dialog: nice man. But you wanna save a

dialog: Let's go.

scene_heading: EXT. URGENT CARE CENTER - DAY
dialog: 
text: Logan and Laura emerge from the Mountain clinic with a big
text: sign with a red cross on it. Laura leads him, limping to--
dialog: 
text: THE FISHERMAN'S STATION WAGON. Yet another commandeered
text: vehicle. She hands him the keys with a lure fob.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: You can't just take shit, you know.
dialog: 
text: He opens the driver's door and finds a booster seat made from
text: bundled cardboard and a box of milkbones. Logan looks at
text: Laura climbing in on the passenger side.
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 98.
dialog:

speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Look. I don't know how you got me
dialog: here,.. but thank you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: De nada.
dialog:

speaker_heading: LOGAN

speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!
dialog: 
text: She stops. She stares at Logan a moment, then very slowly in

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
text: Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca, Delilah and
dialog: Rictor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Who is that?
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 99.

speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Okay. Look. This place. Your mom...

dialog:

text: out the comic, opens it.. Shows him an image of the idyllic
dialog: Box Canyon...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah, I know... I saw it...
dialog: 
text: She holds up another picture from the page he'd read in the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Right. This place does not exist.
dialog: No exist-o. It's fictional.

speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Si, Eden, por favor.

speaker_heading: LOGAN
speaker_heading: (STARTS COUGHING)

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Then, exasperated, rummages through her pack. He sits there,
text: too tired to fight, watches as she comes up with a MAP. She
text: points to where they are, and to where they need to go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Yes, I know. It's a long way.
dialog: 
text: She punches him in the arm. Hard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay. First-- ow. Second, Look at

speaker_heading: LAURA

speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Stop saying those names--

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Vaminos!
dialog:

speaker_heading: LAURA

dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 101.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: His stumped arm is exposed, doing its best to help his good

text: glances out a side window, he tosses a screwdriver back to--
dialog: 
text: A FLESHY NURSE standing over him, fumbling with a tool box.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: That ain't a torx, honey. That's a

dialog: 
text: Pierce glances again out the side window -- into the parking
text: lot of a rural high school, cordoned off, thick with military
text: vehicles, issue sedans, a command trailer and dome tents.
text: Outside the trailer, Dr. Rice is getting harangued by a group
text: of MILITARY BRASS and INTEL / CONTRACTOR TYPES.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: This? Or this. They look the same.
dialog: 
text: Pierce snatches the tool he needs from the nurse and in two
text: strokes, fixes his cyborg hand. Wiggles the fingers. Goes
text: immediately to work, grabbing AN EVIDENCE FOLDER.
dialog: 
text: Inside is a collection of documents from the farmhouse, among
text: them, Laura's wrinkled photograph.
dialog: 
text: HE PULLS IT CLOSE-- Gabriela and the X-23 kids. And another
text: nurse, Maria, the one who sang on birthdays. He turns the

text: something else, something that makes his eyes bright.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILITARY NURSE
dialog: Wow. Responsive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: What?

speaker_heading: MILITARY NURSE

dialog: 
text: The Major and his companions suddenly realize they are moving
text: through a makeshift morgue. TWO DOZEN BODIES laid out as a

text: Gabriela's video. Also among them, Will, Kathryn, and Nate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. RICE
dialog: I'd appreciate it, Major, if your

speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: Not all.

speaker_heading: DR. RICE

speaker_heading: PIERCE

text: look at the other side.
dialog: 
text: Rice turns it to reveal-- The coordinates in North Dakota.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIERCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Those are the coordinates of a fire
dialog: road in the Badlands. A reservation
dialog: near the Border. And, according to
dialog: Wikipedia, its also this.
dialog: 
text: He hands a tablet with the "EDEN EXODUS" X-MEN COMIC cued on

speaker_heading: DR. RICE (CONT'D)
dialog: So I understand that your mother

speaker_heading: MARIA

speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: No. Absolutely not.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: He stumbles out the door to see that the front end of the car

dialog: 
text: He shuffles, weak and woozy, following a path in the dirt,

text: A BOX CANYON. A STRUCTURE PEEKING OUT AT THE TOP OF A CLIFF.

text: some older, some younger than Laura, all looking down at him
dialog: like they caught the biggest fish ever. They are all mutants

scene_heading: INT. CLIFF TOP STRUCTURE -- BUNK AREA -- NIGHT

dialog: sleeping, or reading or busy.
dialog: 
text: A few of them tend to Logan.
dialog: 
text: One of the kids (DELILAH) brings a wet cloth for Logan, but

speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Pesadillas. ...you had night-mare.

speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: It's made of Adamantium. Same thing
dialog: they put inside us. That's why it
dialog: can kill us. Probably killing me
dialog: now. Anyway, I got that a long time
dialog: ago. Kept it as a reminder of what
dialog: I am. Now I keep it to--

text: Logan awakes to hear children playing outside. He watches as
text: some of the kids play a simple game of soccer. Suddenly one
text: of the girls wiffs and kicks right past a ball and then
text: continues prancing, her legs kicking high, arms waving like a
text: puppet. Some of the boys laugh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Jonah! Stop! STOP!
dialog: 
text: Logan sees little Jonah manipulating the girl like a
text: puppeteer. Everything he does, kicking out his legs, waving
text: his arms, she is somehow forced to do, a mirror image. Some
dialog: of the other kids come to her defense --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIZARD BOY
dialog: Jonah, let go! Now!
dialog: 
text: It all ends suddenly when Rictor steps up behind Jonah and
text: slaps him upside the head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICTOR
dialog: Cut the shit.
dialog: 
text: Another kid kicks the loose ball off the edge of the cliff
text: and REBECCA, runs right off the edge of the cliff to catch
text: the ball, then returns, walking on air.
dialog: 
text: Logan lies back in bed. Weak. But looking better.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CLIFF TOP STRUCTURE -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: From across the darkened room, Bobby walks up to Logan. Logan
text: considers him a moment. Bobby holds up an action figures, a
text: vintage toy, the paint chipped. As if expecting a reaction
text: from him. It's a Wolverine figure, then he holds up another.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: ...Was Sabretooth real?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: What.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Laura said you said all the stories
dialog: in the comic books were lies.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Not all. Not completely. Sabretooth
dialog: was real. He was in a program with
dialog: me. Like what they did to you.
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 110.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: So you did mean things with him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: But now you're doing good things.
dialog: 
text: Logan looks at the kid a moment, then--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Kid, I don't know what I'm doing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CLIFF TOP STRUCTURE -- DAY
dialog: 
text: The sound of snipping. Giggles.
dialog: 
text: Then we see nearly all the kids standing around Logan's cot
text: with glowing grins on their faces. Laura among them, although
text: she slides into the back of the pack as he sits up. BOBBY AND
text: REBECCA hide scissors behind their backs.
dialog: 
dialog: And now we see why. They have cut Logan's beard. Strike that.
text: They have shaped Logan's beard into mutton chops. They have
text: snipped off his moustache and soul patch. He touches his
text: face, guessing what they've done-- and crosses, limping to --
dialog: 
text: TO A MIRROR. They all squeal in joy as he takes in his
text: reflection. Then he glares at them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Not funny. Not funny at all.
dialog: 
text: Rictor suddenly hurries through the space, moving from one
text: room to the next. Logan moves after him --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, pal, how long have I been out?
dialog: 
text: But Rictor is already moving off outside--
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CLIFF TOP -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Logan hobbles after Rictor, who passes Jonah, packing a
dialog: backpack.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Hey.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICTOR
dialog: What.
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 111.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: How long have I been in that bed?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICTOR
dialog: Two days.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: You've been sitting here two days?
dialog: You can't do that. You can't just
dialog: stay here forever.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTHER KID
speaker_heading: (HELPFULLY)
dialog: We aren't. We had to wait. It was
dialog: the plan. Everyone had `til today
dialog: to find their way here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Well, if you keep waiting those
dialog: assholes will find you. And kill
dialog: you all. You need to get out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICTOR
dialog: (checking a bag)
dialog: What do you think we're doing,
dialog: asshole? We're leaving tomorrow at
dialog: dawn. We're going to cross the
dialog: border.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: To Canada?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICTOR
speaker_heading: (WALKING OFF)
dialog: Si.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT./EXT. EDEN - LOOKOUT TOWER - DAY
dialog: 
text: Logan finds Laura and the other mutant children packing up
text: belongings. The older ones lead younger ones-- loading guns,
text: stocking ammo, prepared for anything.
dialog: 
text: Rictor is hunched over a short wave radio. There are voices.
text: In French. He clicks off, crosses to the railing, addresses
dialog: the others like an adolescent general:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICTOR
dialog: That was the signal. They're ready
dialog: for us on the other side.
dialog: 
text: Everyone doubles their efforts. Logan joins Laura at an OLD
scene_heading: MOUNTED TELESCOPE.
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 112.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: It's a ten mile hike through the
dialog: woods, and then, see that pass?
dialog: 
text: Laura nods, eye pressed to the viewfinder...
dialog: 
text: Logan looks out at a distant, rugged mountain looms beyond a
text: swath of dense forest. There is a crevasse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Through there. That's the border.
dialog: That's where we can be free.
dialog: 
text: Rictor now turns to Logan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Okay. Good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICTOR
dialog: ...Come with me.
dialog: 
text: Logan notices Laura watching him tentatively. As if gauging
dialog: how he's going to react to something...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Come.
dialog: 
text: ...Rictor takes Logan by the arm and guides him, still
text: limping, to a closet --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Laura told me all you did for her.
dialog: She was lucky to have you. Not
dialog: everyone was so lucky.
dialog: 
text: Logan glances back at Laura, still watching him carefully.
dialog: 
text: Rictor opens a cupboard and hands Logan what is left of the
text: old envelope of cash. Logan stares down at the money --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Keep it. For your supplies or
dialog: whatever.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICTOR
dialog: She says it's yours.
dialog: 
text: Logan pushes the cash back in Rictor's hands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Yeah. Well. Look. I don't need
dialog: this. You do. For supplies. Buy her
dialog: some cereal.
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 113.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Rictor regards him a moment, nods solemnly and exits.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT./EXT. CLIFF TOP STRUCTURE -- EDEN -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Outside, the kids all sit before a fire, perched on their
text: rucksacks, eating from cans of food. Eager to make the trip.
dialog: 
text: Inside, Logan ties his boots sitting on the cot, observing
text: them with a hint of nostalgia -- the chatty camaraderie, two
text: of the kids goofing with their powers, laughter-- it tugs
text: unexpectedly at him.
dialog: 
text: And then he notices LAURA staring at him. A little hard, a
text: little cryptic. Logan turns to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: They seem nice. Your friends.
speaker_heading: (ADMITS)
dialog: Kinda remind me--
dialog: 
text: Laura abruptly rises and marches off. Logan thrown --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: 
text: is about to go outside -- when Logan GRABS her arm and tugs
text: her to his bunk area.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: What's going on with you?
dialog: 
text: She ignores him, yanking her arm free --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey. I asked you a question. What
dialog: are you pissed about? You're with
dialog: your friends. You made it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: And where will you go?
dialog: 
text: Logan considers this a moment, smiles--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Nearest bar, for starters.
dialog: 
text: Laura absorbs the answer, starts to exit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: What-- you thought I was coming
dialog: along?
dialog: 
text: She glares back at him-- clearly, yes.
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 114.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: That was never the deal. I got you
dialog: this far, that's all I signed up
dialog: for. I gave back the money --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Such a nice man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Hey, I never asked for this.
dialog: 
text: She starts to move off again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, I don't know what Charles put
dialog: in your head, but I'm not...
dialog: whatever it is you think I am.
dialog: 
text: Laura looks off, defiant, hurt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You don't need me. You've got
dialog: Rictor, Delilah, Rebecca, Bobby,
dialog: blah blah whoever. Hey. It's better
dialog: this way. I suck at this. Bad shit
dialog: happens to people I care about.
dialog: 
text: Laura meets his eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Then I will be fine.
dialog: 
text: And she walks off.
dialog: 
text: ON LOGAN, watching her go. Resisting every urge to chase
text: after her-- he SLAMS the door.
dialog: 
text: ON LAURA OUTSIDE, at the edge of the cliff, looking out at
text: the stars as she wipes her eyes, the faint laughter and noise
text: of the kids nearby. She glances back at Logan's door... then
text: turns to join them.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TOP OF CLIFF -- BUNK AREA -- PRE-DAWN
dialog: 
text: Logan asleep in his corner. He stirs awake.
dialog: 
text: He sees something near his face. A hypodermic and one last
text: vial of the green fluid on top of a backpack. Beside it, a
scene_heading: note: "NOT ALL AT ONCE. - RICTOR"
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TOP OF CLIFF -- DAWN
dialog: 
text: Logan ventures out by first light. It's eerily quiet here
text: now. All the kids are indeed gone. Laura too.
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 115.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Logan continues walking through the now-abandoned structure,
dialog: reckoning with the choice he made.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. EDEN - TOP OF CLIFF - DAWN
dialog: 
text: Logan is looking down at his station wagon still parked in
text: the swale -- when he halts. Hears a buzzing, then looks
dialog: upward and sees --
dialog: 
text: A flock of drones flying by overhead, fanning out.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT./EXT. EDEN -- LOOKOUT TOWER -- DAWN
dialog: 
text: Logan bursts in, hurries to-- THE TELESCOPE -- the one that
text: Rictor had Laura peer through yesterday. Logan brings his eye
dialog: to the viewfinder...
dialog: 
text: LOGAN'S POV THROUGH TELESCOPE: the same distant mountain and
text: crevasse that Laura had seen, five miles away, looming like a
text: beacon, haloed violet by the rising sun.
dialog: 
text: Logan breathes, at once relieved and regretful. About to step
text: away -- when he swings the telescope and sees --
dialog: 
text: LOGAN'S POV THROUGH TELESCOPE: something is moving toward the
text: base of the mountain... black objects, rustling trees...
text: Logan adjusts focus and sees--
dialog: 
text: A CONVOY OF MILITARY AND ALKALI VEHICLES...
dialog: 
text: Logan drops back from the telescope--
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. EDEN CLIFF TOP -- BUNK AREA -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: LOGAN GRABS that vial of green fluid and the needle. Throws
text: them in the backpack, eyes fixed in alarm --
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE WOODS -- DAWN
dialog: 
text: Logan bounding through the woods... but he is already out of
dialog: breath... stumbling...
dialog: 
text: Up ahead he starts to hear the echoed cracks of GUNFIRE,
text: children crying out, shrieking--
dialog: 
text: Logan falls to the ground. Gasping, coughing, his wounds
text: starting to reopen. About to lose consciousness, he reaches
text: into the backpack, fumbling with the syringe and the vial.
text: Draws everything in the container and injects himself...
dialog: 
text: Logan's eyes go wide as the drug hits his bloodstream.
text: He screams.
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 116.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DEEPER IN THE WOODS -- DAWN
dialog: 
text: It's a free-for-all as the Reavers descend on their prey --
text: the kids fleeing in all directions, desperately trying to
text: find cover in the maze of trees, bullets spraying, among
dialog: those running for their lives, Laura --
dialog: 
text: LIZARD BOY disappears like a chameleon into the bark of a
text: tree to avoid a chasing Reaver.
dialog: 
text: Once the Reaver passes, Lizard Boy steps out from the tree,
text: thinking he is safe, and turns to find Pierce standing there.
text: He fires his side arm into the boy's chest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIZARD BOY
dialog: Ow.
dialog: 
text: Lizard boy drops to the ground and Pierce leaves his body to
text: be dragged away by Reavers behind him.
dialog: 
text: NOT FAR AWAY IN THE WOODS --
dialog: 
text: DR. RICE rides in a jeep with two soldiers. He watches the
text: battle ahead from a safe distance. Behind him lumbers the
dialog: Alkali Control Vehicle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICE
dialog: Move faster. We can't let them get
dialog: to the border.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ELSEWHERE IN THE WOODS --
dialog: 
text: ELLA is cornered by several soldiers, who advance on her.
text: Her eyes roll up in her head as she draws on her powers and --
dialog: 
text: PINE NEEDLES LIFT FROM THE GROUND AND TEAR FROM THE TREES,
text: swirling into a whirlwind. The needles envelope the soldiers
text: in a vortex, blinding them, stabbing them, shredding their
text: skin, filling their mouthes, gagging them.
dialog: 
text: A SOLDIER GRABS ELLA from behind, covering her eyes. The
text: needles fall to the ground. As he proceeds to shackle her
text: wrists-- LAURA LEAPS UPON HIM, SPEARING HIM WITH HER CLAWS.
dialog: 
text: Laura and Ella run away as other soldiers fire upon them.
text: Laura tries to pull her friend, she is not fast enough.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
speaker_heading: (IN SPANISH)
dialog: Ella! Run faster! Run!
dialog: 
text: Laura takes a shot to the leg, stumbling, healing, limping
text: but still moving. She looks back to see --
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 117.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ella has been hit and is face down in the leaves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA (CONT'D)
dialog: Ella!
dialog: 
text: She crosses back to Ella to find her dead.
dialog: 
text: Soldiers converging, Laura flees toward other children up
text: ahead. Some soldiers turn as they hear -- gunfire and mens'
text: screams from behind them --
dialog: 
scene_heading: 173C BEHIND THEM, IN THE WOODS -- 173C
dialog: 
text: LOGAN SPRINTS THROUGH THE TREES. Speeding. Full strength.
dialog: We have never seen him before like this.
dialog: 
text: He is Weapon X in a full berserker rage. His body restored by
text: the huge dose of the drug, he cuts his way through Reavers
text: and Soldiers one after another like a saw blade. They fire on
text: him but it doesn't matter, he heals instantly. Each of them
text: are gored and slashed and killed as Logan races toward the
text: children up ahead, overtaking the Alkali convoy.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON -- LITTLE BOBBY
dialog: 
text: running in terror as he's pursued by THREE REAVERS, their
text: bullets chewing up the trees around him, gaining on him--
dialog: 
text: -- when he finally stumbles, peers up to see those Reavers
text: closing in on him, restraints and weapons at the ready when--
dialog: 
text: --SNIKT! Logan appears from nowhere and kills them in an
text: instant. A guerilla warrior, dropped back in the jungle for
dialog: one last battle.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ELSEWHERE IN THE WOODS --
dialog: 
text: JONAH uses his ocular mirror connection, making one of the
text: Reavers AIM HIS GUN AT HIS OWN MEN, MOWING THEM DOWN. Then he
text: mimes his "puppet" Reaver into aiming his automatic rifle at
text: himself, shooting himself in the chin.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON -- DELILAH
dialog: 
text: Delilah is caught against a tree. She breathes on her
text: captor's arm, FREEZING IT. Then she shatters his frozen limb,
text: and the soldier screams as more Reavers grab Delilah,
text: restraining her...
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON -- PIERCE
dialog: 
text: A Reaver brings Logan's backpack to Pierce. He looks at the
text: vial and empty syringe. He signals the troops to keep moving.
text: Concerned, he looks ahead to the convoy.
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 118.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON -- LOGAN
dialog: 
text: as he comes upon Ella, dead in the leaves. He pauses, seeing
text: a trail of blood leading off and away. Sniffs it. Laura...
dialog: 
text: Then Logan sees PIERCE THROUGH THE TREES. Dr. Rice behind him
text: in the jeep at the head of the convoy.
dialog: 
text: Pierce meets Logan's eyes as Logan starts toward him.
dialog: Pierce also sees--
dialog: 
text: A REAVER IN A TRUCK AIMS A HUGE RAIL-GUN AT LOGAN'S BACK.
speaker_heading: HE FIRES.
dialog: 
text: Logan is blown backward off his feet. Sprayed with shrapnel.
dialog: 
text: The convoy continues moving after the children in the
dialog: distance.
dialog: 
text: Logan pulls himself up from the smoldering brush to see --
dialog: 
text: LAURA up ahead, cornered by Reavers.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON -- LAURA -- SURROUNDED BY CONVERGING REAVERS.
dialog: 
text: She snarls and slashes at their rifles. But then she hears a
text: primal scream and looks up to see--
dialog: 
text: LOGAN, sprinting toward her, eyes aflame. He slaughters the
text: men surrounding Laura in a swirl of blood--
dialog: 
text: And then the father and daughter move on, chasing after the
text: convoy, slashing through several more Reavers emerging from
text: the woods to ambush them.
dialog: 
text: At the end of this father daughter blade Logan stumbles, out
text: of breath, motioning for Laura to move on, as she slashes at
dialog: one more Reaver.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Laura! Now!
dialog: 
text: Laura obeys, starts to run, but looks back at --
dialog: 
text: Logan, still panting for air. His fresh wounds not healing so
text: fast anymore. Laura knows what he's done.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: You took all the medicine.
dialog: 
text: Logan looks to his wounds, then to Laura.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA (CONT'D)
text: ...It's wearing off.
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 119.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: LOGAN TAKES THE DEAD REAVER'S SIDEARM, stuffs it in his belt
dialog: and leads Laura toward --
dialog: 
scene_heading: IN A WOODED CLEARING -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: THE CHILDREN run in a pack toward the mountains as fast as
text: they can go. RICTOR at the rear, exhorts them in Spanish to
text: go faster. He turns back to see--
dialog: 
text: THE ALKALI CONVOY GAINING ON THEM. Rictor doubles his pace,
text: trying to catch up to the children when-- BAM! -- HE IS SHOT
text: IN THE SHOULDER and falls to the ground, hard.
dialog: 
text: PIERCE LEAPS OFF HIS MOVING JEEP AND PUTS A BOOT ON RICTOR,
text: looping a restraint around the boy's neck just as--
dialog: 
text: Laura and Logan come to a stop at the edge of the clearing.
text: Pale and weak, Logan looks to Laura.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Go to your friends, Laura.
dialog: 
text: Laura takes a step but turns back as Logan adds--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: ...You'll know when.
dialog: 
text: As Laura moves off, Logan stumbles forward placing himself in
text: Pierce's path to the jeeps.
dialog: 
text: Laura moves surreptitiously through the woods to gain better
text: position on her captive friends. She eyes the two Reavers who
text: stand on a jeep, watching over the children-- and two other
text: Reavers standing watch nearby. Her eyes then land on--
dialog: 
text: Donald Pierce as he throws a bleeding Richter to his knees, a
text: gun to the back of the boy's head.
dialog: 
text: RICE'S JEEP COMES TO A STOP BEHIND PIERCE.
dialog: 
text: Laura looks to-- Logan, clutching for air.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: Green juice is wearing down, huh?
dialog: For an ol' mute, that a short high.
dialog: Gonna be hard to keep those claws
text: out soon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICTOR
dialog: (thrashing, to Logan)
dialog: Waste this dick, Logan!
dialog: 
text: Pierce knocks Rictor unconscious with the butt of his gun,
text: then aims the muzzle at Rictor's head. He looks back up at--
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 120.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Logan, weak, standing there. Dr. Rice steps up behind Pierce.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. RICE
dialog: Please stop, Mr. Howlett, or I am
dialog: going to have to tell these men to
dialog: fire on these children. You can see
dialog: the effects of the serum are
dialog: wearing off. You will not survive
dialog: any further wounds.
dialog: 
text: Logan glares at Rice, glances at Laura as she encircles the
text: remaining Reavers guarding her friends.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. RICE (CONT'D)
dialog: It's an honor to meet you. I'm
dialog: Zander Rice. I believe you knew my
dialog: father on the Weapon X program.
dialog: 
text: Logan's dark look goes darker. He holds up his bloody claws.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: He's the asshole who put this
dialog: poison in me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. RICE
dialog: Yes he was. One of them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: I think I might have killed him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. RICE
dialog: I think you're right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: Shit. Show some respect, mutey.
dialog: You're lookin' at the man who wiped
dialog: out your kind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. RICE
dialog: My friend Donald overstates. The
dialog: goal was not ending mutant-kind but
dialog: controlling it. I realized we
dialog: needn't stop perfecting what we eat
dialog: and drink when we could use those
dialog: products to perfect ourselves.
dialog: 
text: Laura sneaks closer to two of the Reavers, poised to attack.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. RICE (CONT'D)
dialog: To distribute gene therapy
text: discreetly, through, well,
dialog: everything -- from sweet drinks to
dialog: breakfast cereal. And it worked.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 121.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. RICE (CONT'D)
dialog: Random mutancy went the way of
dialog: polio. And we embarked on our next
dialog: endeavor.
dialog: 
text: Logan's eyes drift from Pierce to Rice to Laura, claws out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Growing mutants of your own.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: Dangerous times, James. We can't
dialog: trust fate to--
dialog: 
text: He lifts his pistol AND SHOOTS ZANDER RICE IN THE HEAD. The
text: Doctor falls back, dead, in the grass.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Yeah. Dangerous.
dialog: 
text: Two Reavers lunge for their weapons but Laura surprises them,
dialog: slitting their throats as--
dialog: 
text: LOGAN SHOOTS AGAIN, BLOWING OFF PIERCE'S CYBORG HAND-- and he
text: is about to shoot a kill-shot on Pierce but the pistol
text: clicks, its chamber empty.
dialog: 
text: Pierce turns and runs towards the Alkali control truck.
dialog: 
text: Logan stumbles after him, claws out now.
dialog: 
text: Pierce grabs hold of the control van door, throws it open--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: It's showtime, boy!
dialog: 
text: AND A HUGE CREATURE LEAPS OUT OF THE VAN, BLIND-SIDING LOGAN.
dialog: 
text: It is X24 and he slashes at Logan mercilessly. The fight
text: between them is bloody and feral.
dialog: 
text: Laura watches, terrified.
dialog: 
text: Logan struggles to stay on his feet, but there is fear in his
text: eyes. He doesn't know if he can hold his own against this
text: younger stronger version of himself.
dialog: 
text: The commotion distracts the two Reavers guarding the children
text: who raise their weapons.
dialog: 
text: A THIRD REAVER lines up a shot, putting Logan in his cross
text: hairs, when he is suddenly taken out by Laura.
dialog: 
text: Sensing their attention is elsewhere, young Bobby shifts his
text: weight, extending his finger, eyes rolling in his head as --
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 122.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: AN ELECTRICAL BOLT ARCS OFF HIS FINGER leaping to the jeep,
text: ELECTROCUTING THE TWO REAVER GUARDS.
dialog: 
dialog: Laura turns back as--
dialog: 
text: X-24 GRABS LOGAN AND TOSSES HIM LIKE A RAG DOLL into open
text: door of the control van.
dialog: 
text: Bleary, Logan grabs the fallen door, summons his remaining
text: strength and smashes X24 with it, knocking the monster to the
text: dirt. Logan reaches deep, bringing the iron door down like a
text: guillotine on X-24's throat.
dialog: 
text: Rictor come to consciousness in the grass, his eyes finding--
dialog: 
text: X24, pinned on the ground, struggling to breathe, the van
text: door pressing against his neck. X24 catches sight of Dr.
text: Rice, his fallen master.
dialog: 
text: Pierce watches, his survival riding on X24's ability to get
text: up and defeat Logan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIERCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Get up! Get up, boy! That's right!
dialog: He killed your Daddy!
dialog: 
text: X24 howls in rage and breaks Logan's hold, leaping at Logan,
text: mauling him and hurling his limp, bloody body beyond the
text: jeeps.
dialog: 
text: Satisfied with himself, X24 is shocked when--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICTOR
dialog: Laura! No!
dialog: 
text: LAURA LEAPS ON X24'S BACK and slashes at him.
dialog: 
text: Logan tries to crawl back to Laura to help her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Laura...
dialog: 
text: Pierce grabs a crossbow from the van and aims it at Logan. He
text: fires, harpooning Logan's leg. He howls in pain.
dialog: 
text: Pierce ties off the harpoon able and tosses the crossbow and
text: flees to his jeep, looking to escape but suddenly he is
dialog: cornered by --
dialog: 
text: THE NEWLY FREED MUTANT CHILDREN COMING AT HIM, each enraged,
text: aiming their fledgling mutant powers at him. They form a
text: circle, trapping him, freezing him, entangling him, shocking
text: him and burning him, all at once. Pierce cries in agony. They
dialog: have no mercy for their lifelong oppressor.
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 123.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Bloodied and cut, X24 manages to get a hold of Laura -- he
text: hurls her off his back into a tree... hard. She lies there,
text: limp at the base of the tree.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICTOR
dialog: Laura!
dialog: 
text: X24 crosses to Logan, weakened, depleted, preparing to kill
dialog: his elder, when suddenly--
dialog: 
text: Rictor extends his hands and with all his energy projects his
text: power to the ground beneath the Control Van.
dialog: 
text: Laura regains consciousness, noticing the empty pistol a few
text: feet away from her in the grass. Then she sees--
dialog: 
text: THE ROCK AND EARTH BENEATH THE CONTROL VAN START TO HEAVE
text: UPWARD and LIFT THE CONTROL VAN into the air...
dialog: 
text: Rictor screams as the power of his mutancy ripples through
dialog: him and with one last push --
dialog: 
text: He releases the rocks beneath the van--
dialog: 
text: AND THE HUGE VEHICLE TOPPLES ONTO X24, CRUSHING HIM.
dialog: 
text: Meanwhile, the children stare at Pierce. He lies dead at
text: their feet, mummified in ice, blood and twisted grass.
dialog: 
text: Logan gets to his feet and reaches out for Laura.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Laura. You need to get out.
dialog: (to the other children)
dialog: All of you. Get out of here! Now!
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, the is a metallic CREAK AND KLUNK AND X24 EMERGES,
text: BLOODIED, FROM BENEATH THE TOPPLED VAN. The children scream
text: as the monster makes a run at them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: (to the children)
dialog: Go, go GO! Run!
dialog: 
text: The children comply, Laura most hesitant as --
dialog: 
text: Logan stumbles to position himself between the children and
text: the unstoppable fully healed creature charging at him --
dialog: 
text: X-24 GORES LOGAN WITH BOTH HIS CLAWS and, using them like
text: grappling hooks, drags Logan off to the forest's edge.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: No!
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 124.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: X24 heaves Logan onto a fallen stump, A JAGGED WOOD LIMB
text: SPEARING THROUGH LOGAN'S TORSO. Logan howls in pain.
dialog: 
text: Laura runs to the pistol in the grass. Pulls the Adamantium
text: bullet from her pocket, fumbling to load the gun as--
dialog: 
text: Delirious, losing blood, LOGAN grabs helplessly at X24's
text: claws (already plunged into him) as the monster jams them
text: deeper, through him, and into the log-- then raises them for
dialog: one last goring when --
dialog: 
text: X24's Adamantium skull suddenly explodes. He collapses to the
dialog: ground. Done.
dialog: 
text: Laura stands ten feet away, holding the smoking pistol. Her
text: eyes meet Logan's and she drops the gun and runs to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN AND LAURA
dialog: 
text: She hacks Logan from the tree stump. Logan slides painfully
text: to the forest floor. He struggles to breathe. His body is
text: decimated, his skeleton showing through his wounds.
dialog: 
text: Laura's eyes are wild and fearful. She can see he is mortally
text: wounded... She kneels.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: no, no, no...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: ...Take your friends and run. Go.
dialog: Listen to me, Laura. Run. They'll
dialog: just keep coming and coming.
speaker_heading: (GRIPS HER)
dialog: ...Don't be what they made you.
dialog: 
text: The other mutant children emerge from the woods. Stand
text: quietly at a distance.
dialog: 
text: Logan watches them all, his eyes glassy, his body still.
text: Laura takes Logan's bloody hand, and this time, he holds on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: ...it's okay...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: No... ...daddy...
dialog: 
text: Logan looks at her. Then stiffens. Takes a short breath...
text: And in his eyes, there is a flicker of wonder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: So this is what it feels like.
dialog: Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 125.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: And then his breath releases and he is very still.
dialog: 
text: Laura squeezes his limp hand. Disbelieving that he has
text: passed. But there is nothing left in him.
dialog: 
text: Still holding his hand, Laura looks up at her friends, tears
text: in her eyes. The other children gather closer.
dialog: 
text: WIDER ON -- ALL THE CHILDREN IN A CIRCLE AROUND LOGAN. They
text: just stand there in the blast-radius of the carnage as the
text: sun drifts lower in the sky.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA (O.S.)
dialog: A man has to be what he is, Joey.
dialog: You can't break the mould.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAINS - LATE DAY
dialog: 
text: The young mutants lower Logan into the ground. BOBBY has made
text: a simple wooden cross for Logan's grave. Laura stares
text: unrelenting at Logan as the dirt covers him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: There's no living with a killing.
dialog: There's no going back. Right or
dialog: wrong, it's a brand. A brand that
dialog: sticks. Now run on home to your
dialog: mother, and tell her everything's
dialog: alright. There's no more guns in
dialog: the valley...
dialog: 
text: The children all look to Rictor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICTOR
dialog: We gotta go.
dialog: 
text: The children all grab their backpacks and start on the
dialog: mountain trail to Canada.
dialog: 
text: But Laura hesitates, still looking at Logan's grave. She does
text: not move, but then, tearful, grabs her own backpack. As she
text: passes Logan's makeshift cross, she looks at it a moment,
text: considering, then kneels and tips it on its side to make --
dialog: 
dialog: -- an "X".
dialog: 
text: The camera moves in on the X as in the distance, Laura joins
text: her friends scaling the dark mountains, moving toward their
dialog: future.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO BLACK.
dialog:
