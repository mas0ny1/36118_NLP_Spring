speaker_heading: FADE IN ON:
scene_heading: KATIE WEIDERMAN'S MOUTH, ECU
text: She's speaking into the telephone. Pretty mouth; in a few seconds
dialog: we'll see that the rest of her is just as pretty.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Bill? Oh, he says he doesn't feel
dialog: very well, but he's always like that
dialog: between books... can't sleep, thinks
dialog: every headache is the first symptom
dialog: of a brain tumor... once he gets going
dialog: on something new, he'll be fine.

scene_heading: SOUND, B.G.: THE TELEVISION.
text: THE CAMERA DRAWS BACK. KATIE is sitting in the kitchen phone nook,
text: having a good gab with her sister while she idles through some
dialog: catalogues. We should notice one not-quite-ordinary thing about
text: the phone she's on: it's the sort with two lines. There are
text: LIGHTED BUTTONS to show which ones are engaged. Right now only
text: one- KATIE'S- is. As KATIE CONTINUES HER CONVERSATION, THE CAMERA
text: SWINGS AWAY FROM HER, TRACKS ACROSS THE KITCHEN, and through the
text: arched doorway that leads into the family room.
dialog: KATIE (voice, fading)
dialog: Oh, I saw Janie Charlton today... yes!
dialog: Big as a house!
text: She fades. The TV gets louder. There are three kids: JEFF, eight,
text: CONNIE, ten, and DENNIS, thirteen. "Wheel Of Fortune" is on, but
text: they're not watching. Instead, they're engaged in that great
dialog: pastime, Fighting About What Comes On Later.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Come onnn! It was his first book!
speaker_heading: CONNIE
dialog: His first gross book.
speaker_heading: DENNIS.
dialog: We're gonna watch "Cheers" and "Wings,"
dialog: just like we do every week, Jeff.
text: DENNIS speaks with the utter finality only a big brother can
dialog: manage. "Wanna talk about it some more and see how much pain I can
text: inflict on your scrawny body, Jeff?" his face says.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Could we at least tape it?
speaker_heading: CONNIE
dialog: We're taping CNN for Mom. She said she
dialog: might be on the phone with Aunt Lois
dialog: for quite awhile.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: How can you tape CNN, for God's sake?
dialog: It never stops!
speaker_heading: DENNIS.
dialog: That's what she likes about it.
speaker_heading: CONNIE
dialog: And don't say God's sake, Jeffie- you're
dialog: not old enough to talk about God except
dialog: in church.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Then don't call me Jeffie.
speaker_heading: CONNIE
dialog: Jeffie, Jeffie, Jeffie.
text: JEFF gets up, walks to the window, and looks out into the dark.
text: He's really upset. DENNIS and CONNIE, in the grand tradition of
text: older brothers and sisters, are delighted to see it.
speaker_heading: DENNIS.
dialog: Poor Jeffie.
speaker_heading: CONNIE
dialog: I think he's gonna commit suicide.
dialog: JEFF (turns to them)
dialog: It was his first book! Don't you guys
dialog: even care?
speaker_heading: CONNIE
dialog: Rent it down at the Video Stop tomorrow,
dialog: if you want to see it so bad.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: They don't rent R-rated pictures to
dialog: little kids and you know it!
speaker_heading: CONNIE (dreamily)
dialog: Shut up, it's Vanna! I love Vanna!
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Dennis-
speaker_heading: DENNIS.
dialog: Go ask Dad to tape it on the VCR in his
dialog: office and quit being such a totally
text: annoying little booger.
text: JEFF crosses the room, poking his tongue out at Vanna White as he
text: goes. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as he goes into the kitchen.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: ...So when he asked me if Polly had
dialog: tested positive, I had to remind him
dialog: she's away at prep school... and God,
dialog: Lois, I miss her.
dialog: 
text: JEFF is just passing through, on his way to the stairs.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Will you kids please be quiet?
speaker_heading: JEFF (glum)
dialog: They'll be quiet. Now.
text: He goes up the stairs, a little dejected. KATIE looks after him,
text: loving and worried.
speaker_heading: KATIE
text: They're squabbling again. Polly used
dialog: to keep them in line, but now that
dialog: she's away at school... I don't know...
dialog: maybe sending her to Bolton wasn't
dialog: such a hot idea. Sometimes when she
text: calls home she sounds so unhappy.
scene_heading: INT. BELA LUGOSI AS DRACULA, CU
text: Drac's standing at the door of his Transylvanian castle. Someone
text: has pasted a comic-balloon coming out of his mouth which reads:
dialog: "Listen! My children of the night! What music they make!" The
text: poster is on a door but we only see this as JEFF opens it and goes
text: into his father's study.
scene_heading: INT. A PHOTOGRAPH OF KATIE, CU
text: THE CAMERA HOLDS, THEN PANS SLOWLY RIGHT. We pass another photo,
text: this one of POLLY, the daughter away at school. She's a lovely
text: girl of sixteen or so. Past POLLY is DENNIS... then CONNIE... then
speaker_heading: JEFF.
text: THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PAN AND ALSO WIDENS OUT so we can see BILL
text: WEIDERMAN, a man of about forty-four. He looks tired. He's peering
text: into the word-processor on his desk, but his mental crystal ball
text: must be taking the night off, because the screen is blank. On the
text: walls we see framed book-covers. All of them are spooky. One of
dialog: the titles is "Ghost Kiss."
text: JEFF comes up quietly behind his dad. The carpet muffles his feet.
text: BILL sighs and shuts off the word-cruncher. A moment later JEFF
text: claps his hands on his father's shoulders.
speaker_heading: JEFF
scene_heading: BOOGA-BOOGA!
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Hi, Jeffie.
text: He turns in his chair to look at his son, who is disappointed.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: How come you didn't get scared?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Scaring is my business. I'm case-hardened.
dialog: Something wrong?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Daddy, can I watch the first hour of
dialog: "Ghost Kiss" and you tape the rest?
text: Dennis and Connie are hogging everything.
text: BILL swivels to look at the book-jacket, bemused.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You sure you want to watch that, champ?
dialog: It's pretty-
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Yes!
scene_heading: INT. KATIE, IN THE PHONE NOOK
text: In this shot, we clearly see the stairs leading to her husband's
text: study behind her.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: I really think Jeff needs the
dialog: orthodontic work but you know Bill-
text: The other line rings. The other light stutters
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: That's just the other line. Bill will-
text: But now we see BILL and JEFF coming downstairs behind her.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Honey, where're the blank videotapes?
dialog: I can't find any in the study and-
speaker_heading: KATIE (to BILL)
dialog: Wait!
speaker_heading: (to LOIS)
dialog: Gonna put you on hold a sec, Lo.
text: She does. Now both lines are blinking. She pushes the top one
text: where the new call has just come in.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Hello, Weiderman residence.

speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Polly, calm down! Whatever it is can't

text: HUM OF AN OPEN LINE.
text: JEFF has wandered toward the TV room, hoping to find a blank tape.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Who was that?
text: Without looking at her husband or answering him, KATIE slams the
text: lower button in again.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Lois? Listen, I'll call you back.
dialog: That was Polly, and she sounded very
dialog: upset. No... she hung up. Yes. I will.
dialog: Thanks.
text: She hangs up.
speaker_heading: BILL (concerned)
dialog: It was Polly?
speaker_heading: KATIE
text: Crying her head off. It sounded like
dialog: she was trying to say "Please take me
dialog: home"... I knew that damn school was
dialog: bumming her out... Why I ever let you
dialog: talk me into it...
text: She's rummaging frantically on her little phone desk. Catalogues
text: go slithering to the floor around her stool.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Connie did you take my address book?
speaker_heading: CONNIE (voice)
dialog: No, Mom.
text: BILL pulls a battered book out of his back pocket and pages
dialog: through it.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I got it. Except-
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: I know, damn dorm phone is always busy.
dialog: Give it to me.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Honey, calm down.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: I'll calm down after I talk to her. She
text: is sixteen, Bill. Sixteen-year-old girls
text: are prone to depressive interludes.
dialog: Sometimes they even k... just give me the
dialog: damn number!
speaker_heading: BILL
scene_heading: 617-555-8641.
text: As she punches the numbers, THE CAMERA SLIDES IN TO CU.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Come on, come on... don't be busy...
dialog: just this once...
text: SOUND: CLICKS. A pause. Then... the phone starts ringing.
speaker_heading: KATIE (eyes closed)

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Well?

text: JEFF comes back in with a tape.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I found one, Dad. Dennis hid em. As

dialog: Hi, mom!
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Pol? Honey? Are you all right?
text: POLLY (happy, bubbling voice)
dialog: Am I all right? I aced my bio exam,
dialog: got a B on my French Conversational Essay,
dialog: and Ronnie Hansen asked me to the Harvest
dialog: Ball. I'm so all right that if one more
dialog: good thing happens to me today, I'll
text: probably blow up like the Hindenburg.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: You didn't just call me up, crying your

text: We see by KATIE's face that she already knows the answer to this
dialog: question.
speaker_heading: POLLY (filter)
dialog: Heck no!

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: She okay?
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Fine. I could have sworn it was Polly,
text: but... she's walking on air.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: So it was a prank. Or someone who was
dialog: crying so hard she dialed a wrong
text: number “through a shimmering film of
dialog: tears," as we veteran hacks like to say.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: It was not a prank and it was not a
dialog: wrong number! It was someone in my family!
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Honey, you can't know that.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: No? If Jeffie called up, just crying,
dialog: would you know it was him?
speaker_heading: BILL (struck by this)
dialog: Yeah, maybe. I guess I might.
text: She's not listening. She's punching numbers.

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: But if Polly's okay and your mom's okay...
speaker_heading: KATIE (positive)
dialog: It's Dawn.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Come on, hon, a minute ago you were sure
dialog: it was Polly.
speaker_heading: KATIE
text: It had to be Dawn. I was on the phone with
dialog: Lois and Mom's okay so Dawn's the only other
dialog: one it could have been. She's the youngest...
dialog: 
dialog: I could have mistaken her for Polly... and
text: she's out there in that farmhouse alone with
dialog: the baby!
speaker_heading: BILL (startled)
dialog: What do you mean, alone?
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Jerry's in Burlington! It's Dawn!
dialog: Something's happened to Dawn!
text: CONNIE comes into the kitchen, worried.
speaker_heading: CONNIE
dialog: Mom? Is Aunt Dawn okay?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: So far as we know, she's fine. Take

scene_heading: EXT. AN ISOLATED FARMHOUSE

scene_heading: INT. THE CAR, WITH BILL AND KATIE
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: I'm scared.

speaker_heading: BILL (solemnly)
dialog: Booga-booga.
speaker_heading: KATIE (total surprise)
dialog: How long have you had that?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Since last year. I didn't want to

scene_heading: EXT. BILL AND KATIE
text: They get out. KATIE stands by the front of the car while BILL goes
text: to the garage and peers in.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Her car's here.
text: THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH THEM to the front door. Now we can hear the
text: TV, PLAYING LOUD. BILL pushes the doorbell. We hear it inside.
text: They wait. KATIE pushes it. Still no answer. She pushes it again
text: and doesn't take her finger off. BILL looks down at:
scene_heading: EXT. THE LOCK, BILL'S POV
text: Big scratches on it.
scene_heading: EXT. BILL AND KATIE
speaker_heading: BILL (low)
text: The lock's been tampered with.

text: is louder.
speaker_heading: BILL

dialog: left you home, Kate.
text: He starts in. KATIE comes after him, terrified, near tears.
scene_heading: INT. DAWN AND JERRY'S LIVING ROOM
text: From this angle we see only a small section of the room. The TV is
text: much louder. BILL enters the room, gun up. He looks to the
text: right... and suddenly all the tension goes out of him. He lowers
dialog: the gun.
text: KATIE (draws up beside him)
dialog: Bill... what...
dialog: He points.
scene_heading: INT. THE LIVING ROOM, WIDE, BILL AND KATIE'S POV
text: The place looks like a cyclone hit it... but it wasn't robbery or
dialog: murder that caused this mess; only a healthy eighteen-month-old
text: baby. After a strenuous day of trashing the living room, Baby got
text: tired and Mommy got tired and they fell asleep on the couch
text: together. The baby is in DAWN's lap. There is a pair of Walkman
text: earphones on her head. There are toys- tough plastic Sesame Street
dialog: and PlaySkool stuff, for the most part- scattered hell to
text: breakfast. The baby has also pulled most of the books out of the
text: bookcase. Had a good munch on one of them, too, by the look. BILL
text: goes over and picks it up. It is "Ghost Kiss."
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I've had people say they just eat my

text: softens.
scene_heading: INT. DAWN AND THE BABY, KATIE'S POV

dialog: Shoulda called, guys. Place is a mess.
text: She's radiant when she smiles.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: We tried. The operator told Bill the

dialog: just the right thing to teethe on. I
dialog: don't want to scare you, beautiful, but
dialog: somebody's been at your front door lock
text: with a screwdriver or something.
dialog: Whoever it was forced it.
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Gosh, no! That was Jerry, last week. I
dialog: locked us out by mistake and he didn't
dialog: have his key and the spare wasn't over
text: the door like it's supposed to be. He
dialog: was mad because he had to take a whiz
dialog: real bad and so he took the screwdriver
dialog: to it. It didn't work, either- that's
dialog: one tough lock. (Pause) By the time I
dialog: found my key he'd already gone in the
dialog: bushes.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: If it wasn't forced, how come I could
dialog: just open the door and walk in?
speaker_heading: DAWN (guiltily)
dialog: Well... sometimes I forget to lock it.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: You didn't call me tonight, Dawn?
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Gee, no! I didn't call anyone! I was too
dialog: busy chasing Justin around! He kept
dialog: wanting to eat the fabric softener! Then
dialog: he got sleepy and I sat down here and
dialog: thought I'd listen to some tunes while
dialog: I waited for your movie to come on, Bill,
dialog: and I fell asleep-
text: At the mention of the movie BILL starts visibly and looks at the
text: book. Then he glances at his watch.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I promised to tape it for Jeff. Come on,
dialog: Katie, we've got time to get back.
speaker_heading: KATIE
text: Just a second.

speaker_heading: BILL

scene_heading: INT. JEFF, IN BED
text: His room is dark. The covers are pulled up to his chin.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You promise to tape the rest?
text: CAMERA WIDENS OUT so we can see BILL, sitting on the bed.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I promise.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I especially liked the part where the
text: dead guy ripped off the punk rocker's
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Well... they used to take out all the
text: blood-bags.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What, Dad?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Nothing. I love you, Jeffie.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I love you, too. So does Rambo.
text: JEFF holds up a stuffed dragon of decidedly unmilitant aspect.
text: BILL kisses the dragon, then JEFF.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: "Night.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: "Night. (As BILL reaches his door
dialog: Glad Aunt Dawn was okay.
speaker_heading: BILL

scene_heading: INT. TV, CU
text: A guy who looks like he died in a car crash about two weeks prior
dialog: to filming (and has since been subjected to a lot of hot weather)
text: is staggering out of a crypt. THE CAMERA WIDENS to show BILL,
text: releasing the VCR PAUSE button.
speaker_heading: KATIE (voice)
dialog: Booga-booga.
text: BILL looks around companionably. THE CAMERA WIDENS OUT MORE to
text: show KATIE, wearing a sexy nightgown.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Same to you. I missed the first
text: forty seconds or so after the break.
dialog: I had to kiss Rambo.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: You sure you're not mad at me, Bill?
text: He goes to her and kisses her.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Not even a smidge.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: It's just that I could have sworn it
dialog: was one of mine. You know what I mean?
dialog: One of mine?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: KATIE
text: I can still hear those sobs. So lost...
text: so heartbroken.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Kate, have you ever thought you
text: recognized someone on the street, and
dialog: called her, and when she finally turned
dialog: around it was a total stranger?
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Yes, once. In Seattle. I was in a mall
dialog: and I thought I saw my old roommate.
dialog: I... oh. I see what you're saying.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Sure. There are sound-alikes as well as
dialog: look-alikes.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: But... you know your own. At least I
dialog: thought so until tonight.
text: She puts her cheek on his shoulder, looking troubled.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: I was so positive it was Polly...
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Because you've been worried about her
text: getting her feet under her at the new
dialog: school... but judging from the stuff
dialog: she told you tonight, I'd say she's
dialog: doing just fine in that department.
dialog: Wouldn't you?
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Yes... I guess I would.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Let it go, hon.
text: KATIE (looks at him closely)
dialog: I hate to see you looking so tired.
dialog: Hurry up and have an idea, you.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Well, I'm trying.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: You coming to bed?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Soon as I finish taping this for Jeff.
speaker_heading: KATIE (amused)
dialog: Bill, that machine was made by Japanese
dialog: technicians who think of damned near
dialog: everything. It'll run on its own.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Yeah, but it's been a long time since
dialog: I've seen this one, and...
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Okay. Enjoy. I think I'll be awake for a
dialog: little while. (Pause) I've got a few
dialog: ideas of my own.
speaker_heading: BILL (smiles)
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Yeah.
text: She starts out, showing a lot of leg, then turns in the doorway as
text: something else strikes her.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: If they show that part where the punk's
dialog: head gets-
speaker_heading: BILL (guiltily)
dialog: I'll edit it.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: ‘Night. And thanks again. For everything.
text: She leaves. BILL sits in his chair.

scene_heading: INT. KATIE, IN BED
text: It's dark. She's asleep. She wakes up... sort of.
speaker_heading: KATIE (sleepy)
dialog: Hey, big guy-
text: She feels for him, but his side of the bed is empty, the coverlet
text: still pulled up. She sits up. Looks at:
text: INT. A CLOCK ON THE NIGHT-TABLE, KATIE'S POV
text: It says 2:03 A.M. Then it flashes to 2:04.
scene_heading: INT. KATIE
text: Fully awake now. And concerned. She gets up, puts on her robe, and
text: leaves the bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. THE TV SCREEN, CU
dialog: Snow.
text: KATIE (voice, approaching)
dialog: Bill? Honey? You okay? Bill? Bi-
scene_heading: INT. KATIE, IN BILL'S STUDY
text: She's frozen, wide-eyed with horror.
scene_heading: INT. BILL, IN HIS CHAIR
text: He's slumped to one side, eyes closed, hand inside his shirt. DAWN

speaker_heading: MINISTER (voice)

scene_heading: EXT. GRAVESIDE
text: All the WEIDERMANS are ranged here. KATIE and POLLY wear identical
text: black dresses and veils. CONNIE wears a black skirt and white
text: blouse. DENNIS and JEFF wear black suits. JEFF is crying. He has
text: Rambo the Dragon under his arm for a little extra comfort.
text: CAMERA MOVES IN ON KATIE. Tears course slowly down her cheeks. She
text: bends and gets a handful of earth. Tosses it into the grave.
speaker_heading: KATIE

scene_heading: EXT. A CHURCH DAY
scene_heading: TITLE CARD: FIVE YEARS LATER
text: THE WEDDING MARCH is playing. POLLY, older and radiant with joy,
text: emerges into a pelting shower of rice. She's in a wedding gown,
text: her new husband by her side.
text: Celebrants throwing rice line either side of the path. From behind
text: the bride and groom come others. Among them are KATIE, DENNIS,
text: CONNIE, and JEFF... all five years older. With KATIE is another
text: man. This is HANK. In the interim, Katie has also taken a husband.
text: POLLY turns and her mother is there.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: Thank you, Mom.
speaker_heading: KATIE (crying)
dialog: Oh doll, you're so welcome.
text: They embrace. After a moment POLLY draws away and looks at HANK.
text: There is a brief moment of tension, and then POLLY embraces HANK,
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: Thank you too, Hank. I'm sorry I was
dialog: such a creep for so long...
speaker_heading: HANK (easily)
dialog: You were never a creep, Pol. A girl
dialog: only has one father.
speaker_heading: CONNIE
dialog: Throw it! Throw it!

scene_heading: EXT. THE BOUQUET, CU, SLOW MOTION
text: Turning and turning through the air.
scene_heading: DISSOLVES TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE STUDY, WITH KATIE NIGHT
text: The word-processor has been replaced by a wide lamp looming over a
text: stack of blueprints. The book-jackets have been replaced by photos
text: of buildings. Ones that have first been built in HANK's mind,
dialog: presumably.
text: KATIE is looking at the desk, thoughtful and a little sad.
speaker_heading: HANK (voice)
dialog: Coming to bed, Kate?
text: She turns and THE CAMERA WIDENS OUT to give us HANK. He's wearing
text: a robe over pajamas. She comes to him and gives hima little hug,
text: smiling. Maybe we notice a few streaks of gray in her hair; her
dialog: pretty pony has done its fair share of running since BILL died.
speaker_heading: KATIE
text: In a little while. A woman doesn't
dialog: see her first one get married every
dialog: day, you know.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I know.
text: THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as they walk from the work area of the study to
text: the more informal area. This is much the same as it was in the old
text: days, with a coffee table, stereo, TV, couch, and BILL's old easy-
text: chair. She looks at this.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: You still miss him, don't you?
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Some days more than others. You didn't
dialog: know, and Polly didn't remember.
speaker_heading: HANK (gently)
dialog: Remember what, doll?
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Polly got married on the five-year
dialog: anniversary of Bill's death.
dialog: HANK (hugs her)
dialog: Come on to bed, why don't you?
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: In a little while.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Okay. Maybe I'll still be awake.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Got a few ideas, do you?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I might.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: That's nice.
text: He kisses her, then leaves, closing the door behind him. KATIE
text: sits in BILL's old chair. Close by, on the coffee table, is a
text: remote control for the TV and an extension phone. KATIE looks at
text: the blank TV, and THE CAMERA MOVES IN on her face. One tear rims
text: one eye, sparkling like a sapphire.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: I do still miss you, big guy. Lots and
dialog: lots. Every day. And you know what? It
dialog: hurts.
text: The tear falls. She picks up the TV remote and pushes the ON
dialog: button.
scene_heading: INT. TV, KATIE'S POV
text: An ad for Ginsu knives comes to an end and is replaced by a STAR
speaker_heading: LOGO.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (voice)
dialog: Now back to Channel 63's Thursday night
dialog: Star Time Movie... "Ghost Kiss."
text: The logo DISSOLVES INTO a guy who looks like he died in a car
dialog: crash about two weeks ago and has since been subjected to a lot of
text: hot weather. He comes staggering out of the same old crypt.
scene_heading: INT. KATIE
text: Terribly startled- almost horrified. She hits the OFF button on
text: the remote control. The TV blinks off.
text: KATIE's face begins to work. She struggles against the impending
text: emotional storm, but the coincedence of the movie is just one
dialog: thing too many on what must have already been one of the most
text: emotionally trying days of her life. The dam breaks and she begins
text: to sob... terrible heartbroken sobs. She reaches out for the
text: little table by the chair, meaning to put the remote control on
text: it, and knocks the phone onto the floor.
text: SOUND: The HUM OF AN OPEN LINE.
text: Her tear-stained face grows suddenly still as she looks at the
text: telephone. Something begins to fill in... an idea? an intuition?
text: Hard to tell. And maybe it doesn't matter.
scene_heading: INT. THE TELEPHONE, KATIE'S POV
text: THE CAMERA MOVES IN TO ECU... MOVES IN until the dots in the off-
text: the-hook receiver look like chasms.
text: SOUND OF OPEN-LINE BUZZ UP TO LOUD.
text: WE GO INTO THE BLACK... and hear

dialog: Who are you calling? Who do you want to
dialog: call? Who would you call, if it wasn't
dialog: too late?

scene_heading: INT. KATIE
text: There is now a strange hypnotized look on her face. She reaches
text: down, scoops the telephone up, and punches in numbers, seemingly
text: at random.
scene_heading: SOUNDS: RINGING PHONE.
text: KATIE continues to look hypnotized. The look holds until the phone
text: is answered... and she hears herself on the other end of the line.
speaker_heading: KATIE (voice; filter)
dialog: Hello, Weiderman residence.
text: KATIE- our present-day KATIE with the streaks of gray in her hair-
text: goes on sobbing, yet an expression of desperate hope is trying to
text: be born on her face. On some level she understands that the depth
text: of her grief has allowed a kind of telephonic time-travel. She's
text: trying to talk, to force the words out.
speaker_heading: KATIE (sobbing)
dialog: Take... please take... t-t-
scene_heading: INT. KATIE, IN THE PHONE NOOK, REPRISE
text: It's five years ago. BILL is standing beside her, looking

speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Polly? What's wrong?
scene_heading: INT. KATIE, IN THE STUDY
speaker_heading: KATIE (sobbing)
dialog: Please-quick-

dialog: 
text: SOUND: HUM OF AN OPEN LINE.
text: Slowly, very slowly, Katie hangs up the telephone. Then, after a
text: moment, she picks it up again. She speaks aloud with no self-
text: consciousness whatever. Probably doesn't even know she's doing it.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: I dialed the old number. I dialed-
speaker_heading: SLAM CUT TO:
text: INT. BILL, IN THE PHONE NOOK WITH KATIE BESIDE HIM

dialog: I promise not to give it out.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: It's 555-
speaker_heading: SLAM CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KATIE, IN BILL'S OLD CHAIR, CU
speaker_heading: KATIE (finishes)
dialog: -4408.
scene_heading: INT. THE PHONE, CU
text: KATIE's trembling finger carefully picks out the number, and we
text: hear the corresponding tones: 555-4408.
scene_heading: INT. KATIE, IN BILL'S OLD CHAIR, CU
text: She closes her eyes as the PHONE BEGINS TO RING. Her face is
text: filled with an agonizing mixture of hope and fear. If only she can
dialog: have one more chance to pass the vital message on, it says... just
dialog: one more chance.
speaker_heading: KATIE (low)
dialog: Please... please...
speaker_heading: RECORDED VOICE (filter)
dialog: You have reached a non-working number.

text: number... "through a shimmering film
dialog: of tears," as we veteran hacks like to
dialog: say.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: It was not a prank and it was not a

dialog: family!
scene_heading: (PRESENT DAY) IN BILL'S STUDY
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Yes. Someone in my family. Someone very
dialog: close. (Pause) Me.
text: suddenly throws the phone across the room. Then she begins to
text: AGAIN and puts her hands over her face. THE CAMERA HOLDS on
text: for a moment, then DOLLIES ACROSS TO
speaker_heading: THE PHONE
text: It lies on the carpet, looking both bland and somehow ominous.
text: CAMERA MOVES IN TO ECU- the holes in the receiver once more look
text: like huge dark chasms. We HOLD, then
