dialog: defeat...yourself?
text: Scott peers into the glimmering lenses, spotting his EVIL
text: MIRROR IMAGE staring back at him. The glasses dissolve and
text: Scott whips around to face...
speaker_heading: KNIVES CHAU
dialog: Negascott!
text: NEGASCOTT walks towards Scott, Knives and Ramona. Fringed
text: hair. Dark clothes. Evil face.
text: Knives and Ramona flank Scott in a fighting stance.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: No. This is something I have to
dialog: face on my own.
text: The girls reluctantly exit stage left as Scott walks forward
text: to confront his dark side.
text: Scott and Negascott face off. Both take a step forward...

text: Knives and Ramona huddle in the snow outside Chaos Theatre.
text: They look expectantly at the entrance, worried for Scott.
dialog: Then...
text: Scott strolls out with Negascott. They chat amiably, shake
text: hands and part ways. Scott approaches Knives and Ramona.
speaker_heading: KNIVES CHAU
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Aw, nothing. We just shot the shit.
dialog: He's a super-nice guy. We actually
dialog: have a lot in common.
text: Scott runs his fingers through his hair.
speaker_heading: KNIVES CHAU
dialog: Your hair.

speaker_heading: KNIVES CHAU
dialog: It's getting really shaggy.
text: Scott's HAT appears on his head! He looks totally freked.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: KNIVES CHAU
dialog: I like it.
text: Knives removes the hat from Scott's head, literally taking
text: his guard down. Ramona sees this and smiles.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: You do?
text: Scott smiles, then realizes Ramona has gone. He turns to see
text: her, pulling her hood up and walking into the darkness.
text: Scott calls after her. Steps tentatively away from Knives.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Hey... Where are you going?
text: Ramona, hoping to slip away, stops and turns back.
speaker_heading: RAMONA
dialog: I dunno. I should probably
dialog: disappear.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: After all that?
speaker_heading: RAMONA
dialog: It's hard, you know? I came here to
dialog: get away, but the past keeps
dialog: catching up. I'm tired of people
dialog: getting hurt because of me.
text: Ramona looks at Knives as she says this.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: I think I understand.
text: Snow begins to fall. Ramona straightens his parka tenderly.
speaker_heading: RAMONA
dialog: I should tahnk you, though.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: RAMONA
dialog: For being the nicest guy I ever
dialog: dated.

speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: That's kind of sad.
speaker_heading: RAMONA
speaker_heading: (ALMOST LAUGHING)
dialog: It is kind of sad.
text: She takes his hand briefly, then lets it drop.
speaker_heading: RAMONA
dialog: Well... Bye and stuff.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Yeah. And stuff.
text: She turns to walk off again. Scott watches, then hears-
speaker_heading: KNIVES (O.S.)
dialog: Go get her.
text: Surprised, Scott turns back to see a smiling Knives.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Wha?
speaker_heading: KNIVES
dialog: You earned it. You've been fighting
dialog: for her all along.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: But what about you?
speaker_heading: KNIVES
dialog: (totally sweet and sad)
dialog: I'll be fine. I'm too cool for you
dialog: anyway.
text: She grins and kisses his cheek.
speaker_heading: KNIVES
dialog: There's someone out there for me.
text: We hear a COUGH - Young Neil sidles into frame behind her.
text: Guitar still in hand.
text: We hear a 2ND COUGH - Nega Scott also sidles into frame.
text: Knives doesn't look back, but urges Scott to-
speaker_heading: KNIVES
dialog: Go talk to her. Before she's gone.
text: Ramona walks on into the night alone, but then-
speaker_heading: SCOTT (O.S.)
dialog: Hey... mind if I tag along?

speaker_heading: RAMONA
dialog: You want to come with me?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
speaker_heading: (HOPEFUL)
dialog: I thought maybe we could... try
dialog: again?
text: Ramona smiles. She holds out her hand like in the park scene
text: earlier. Scott takes it.
text: We see the door with the star on it, standing right in the
text: middle of the street, snow swirling around it.
text: Scott and Ramona walk towards the door, sunrise coming up
text: over Toronto, night magically turning to day, winter turning
dialog: to spring.
text: Over this magical transformation, we hear a lush rendition of
dialog: 'Ramona' swelling and hear whispers of gossip over Toronto's
text: cell phone airwaves.
speaker_heading: JULIE (V.O.)
dialog: Oh my God, can I blow your mind?
dialog: Scott Pilgrim totally threw down
dialog: with Gideon Graves at the grand
dialog: opening of Chaos Theater. Yeah, it
dialog: was apparently awesome.
speaker_heading: STACEY (V.O.)
dialog: Oh my God, it was a HUGE fight. I
dialog: mean bananas. My little brother
text: kicked a guy's head off. Literally.
dialog: It was unbelievable. Someone
dialog: seriously should have been filming
dialog: it.
text: Scott and Ramona walk through the door. Tilt up to the
text: heavens and reveal the CONTINUE graphic in the stars.
