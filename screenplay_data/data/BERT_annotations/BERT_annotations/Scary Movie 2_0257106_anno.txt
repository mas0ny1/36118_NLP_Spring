scene_heading: INT. HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
text: A party is winding down. Only a FEW GUESTS remain. They all
text: are gathered around the piano. A YOUNG PRIEST, FATHER HARRIS,
text: plays an old standard. Everyone sings along. A WOMAN in the
text: group, mid-40's, conservative, really getting into the song,
text: starts giving a soulful rendition, dropping to her knees ala
text: James Brown. The song ends. Everyone cheers. Father Harris
text: starts another.
speaker_heading: HARRIS

text: They all join in.
text: A YOUNG GIRL, MEGAN, enters the room. She watches the group.

speaker_heading: MEGAN

speaker_heading: CLOSE ON:

speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY

speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Father, come in, please.
text: Father McFeely enters. The mother closes the door behind
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: I'm so glad you're here.
speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY
dialog: I came as fast as I could, but at my
dialog: age the little soldier needs a lot
text: more thumpin before it starts pumpin.
dialog: If I tickle my ass before...
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: It's okay. I understand.
speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY
dialog: How is she?
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: (sadly)
dialog: She's gotten worse, Father. She won't
dialog: eat, she won't talk. The child won't
dialog: even let me touch her.
speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY
dialog: (reflecting)
dialog: Yes... Sometimes you have to give
dialog: them candy.
text: The mother gives Father McFeely an odd look.
text: They are interrupted by Father Harris. He extends his hand
text: to McFeely.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Father.
speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY
dialog: Not unless you have a paternity test
dialog: to prove it.
text: Harris looks confused.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: No, I was sent by the church to assist
dialog: you. My name is Father Harris.
text: They shake hands.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Would you like to see the girl?
speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY
dialog: Soon. First, I must bless this house.
text: McFeely walks to a room and opens the door.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
text: Small bare walls. A window in the center wall.
text: McFeely closes the door. He sits and opens a bible and begins
dialog: to read.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON:
text: The window. Flies begin to appear.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON:
text: McFeely. He wipes sweat from his brow.
text: BACK TO THE WINDOW:
text: More flies. Their BUZZING is loud.
text: McFeely, now sweating, profusely. He begins to cough.
text: The window is now covered with flies. The BUZZING is
text: deafening.
text: McFeely, coughing and gagging.
speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY
dialog: Lord, please help me to release this

speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY
dialog: Thank you, Father.
text: A DEMONIC VOICE is heard.
speaker_heading: DEMONIC VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Get out!!! You fuckin' pig!!!
text: The room door swings open.

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS
text: McFeely staggers out. Father Harris rushes over.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Father, are you okay?
speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY
dialog: Yeah, but you might wanna light a

dialog: (then)
dialog: Did you bring my bag?
speaker_heading: HARRIS

speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MEGAN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
text: McFeely and Harris enter.
speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY
dialog: Remember, don't ask her too many
dialog: questions.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Because she will lie?
speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY
dialog: No, because her breath smells like a
dialog: horse's ass.
text: Megan lays tied to the bed post of her bed. Her face is cut
text: up and twisted, eyes an eerie red. She's hooked up to an
text: I.V. with a small tube running out of her nose. It's shaped
text: like a CRAZY STRAW with red fluid going through it. The straw
text: leads to a cup. "SLURPIE!" Megan is wheezing, heavily. She
text: wears a tee-shirt that reads, "I went to Hell and all I got
dialog: was this stupid t-shirt."
text: They go to opposite sides of the room. Megan stares straight
dialog: ahead.
text: Father McFeely sees that next to Megan's bed are some get-
text: well cards, flowers, balloons, and a teddy bear. He picks up
text: one get-well card: It features a cheesy, happy cartoon dog
text: saying: "Heard You Were Possessed By The Devil"... He flips
text: the card open and reads the punch line: "He Picked One Hell
dialog: Of A Nice Girl!"
text: McFeely, shivering, his breath visible, takes the metal cross
text: from his pocket and kisses it. But it's so cold in the room
text: that his lips instantly stick to the metal.
text: He struggles to pull his lips off the cross and finally
text: manages to painfully tear it off his face.
text: McFeely makes the sign of the cross to Megan.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Shove it up your ass. You worthless
dialog: piece of shit!
speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY
dialog: Silence!!
text: Father McFeely tosses a mint in her mouth.
speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY
dialog: Look, my child. We've come to help
dialog: you.
text: Harris looks at Megan. He sits down on a chair besides the
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: MEGAN/DEMON
dialog: Your mother's in here with us, Harris.
dialog: Would you like to leave a message?
dialog: I'll see that she gets it.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: If that's true, then you must know
dialog: my mother's name. What is it?
text: Megan keeps a sharp stare on Harris. Harris' smile turns to
text: an angry stare. He rises and moves to her bedside.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: What is it?
text: Megan leans forward. BLANCHHHH!!! She vomits a disgusting
text: green bile in Harris' face. Harris wipes it off, coughing.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: That's right. Blanche was my mother's
dialog: name. You are the devil.
text: Harris tosses holy water on Megan. She falls back, writhing.
speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY
dialog: It burns! It burns!
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON:
text: McFeely, holding his crotch.
speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY
dialog: Damn Tijuana hooker.
text: Harris and McFeely begin to pray.
speaker_heading: MCFEELY/HARRIS
dialog: Our Father who art in Heaven...
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Your mother sucks cock in Hell,
dialog: Harris.
text: Harris tries to ignore her.
speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY
dialog: Oh shit, you gonna take that?
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY
dialog: What she said about your mother?
text: Harris fires back at Megan.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Oh, yeah, well your mama got one leg
dialog: and does jumping jacks like this.
text: He puts his feet together and jumps them from side to side
text: as he claps his hands over his head.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: So, your mama's so fat when she walks
dialog: by my bed, it does this.
text: Her bed bounces and bucks off the floor.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: What about your mama? Her butt is so
text: big, she wipes her ass like this.
text: He makes an exaggerated movement of putting his hand behind
text: his head then brings it up high and back down over his face.
text: The exchange continues with the possessed girl getting the
dialog: best of Harris.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Enough! Begone from this child of
dialog: God. I command you by the power of
dialog: the living and the dead...
text: Megan groaning, flicking her tongue wildly at McFeely.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: ...to leave the young servant so
dialog: that she may return to her...
text: McFeely responds back with the same gesture, then simulates
text: her giving head, then starts wildly thrusting his pelvis,
text: simulating sex. Megan falls back on her pillow and moans.
text: Harris shoots McFeely a hard look.
text: McFeely stops. Harris continues.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: In the name of the Father, the Son,
dialog: and the Holy Spirit, I cast you out.
text: McFeely, coughing, hardly able to catch his breath.
text: Megan on the bed, laughing. Smoke billowing out of her mouth.
text: Harris rushes to McFeely.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Father, are you alright?
text: McFeely nods yes, revealing he's smoking a joint.
speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY
dialog: This is some good shit.
text: He offers a hit to Harris.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: No thanks.
speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY
dialog: My holy water.
text: Harris gives him the bottle.
text: McFeely takes a swig.
speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY
dialog: Ahhh, that's better.
text: McFeely splashes some on Harris, playfully.
text: He clears his throat and starts again, taking turns splashing
text: the booze on her and taking sips from it.
speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY
dialog: The power of Christ compels you!
text: He splashes her again, then takes a sip.
text: She roars. Lights flicker. The scary, pale "DEATH HEAD"
text: flashes over her again. But this time, it's picking its nose.
text: The "DEATH HEAD" realizes it's seen and quickly pulls its
text: finger from its nose, trying to look all scary again.
speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY
dialog: The power of Christ compels you!
text: He splashes more booze on her and takes a sip. By this time,
text: Father McFeely is getting drunk.
speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY
dialog: (slurring)
dialog: The power of Chrishht compelshh yooo.
text: He's stumbling around, splashing the walls.
speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY
dialog: (slurring)
dialog: Power of compelshh Chrishhts you, or
dialog: something...
text: Suddenly, the girl's straps break and she starts floating
dialog: up.
text: Harris watches in awe. A MAGICIAN'S ASSISTANT passes a hoop
text: over her.
speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY
dialog: David Blaine, kiss my ass.
text: The girl continues to float up into spinning blades out of
text: the ceiling fan. WHACK! The blades slam into her head, sending
text: her flying back down on to the bed.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Father, I think you should rest.
speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY
dialog: No, I'm fine.
text: He staggers over to the bed, kneels and starts to pray.
text: Harris exits the room to retrieve his medical bag. He returns
text: to find McFeely lying unconscious on the bed. Megan, sitting,
text: quiet looks at McFeely.
text: Harris rushes over to McFeely.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Father!
text: Harris grabs McFeely and throws him down to the ground.
text: McFeely's eyes open.
speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY
dialog: I must have dozed off.
text: Harris, caught up in the moment, is oblivious that McFeely
text: is okay. He starts pounding violently on his chest.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: No!!!
text: Harris knee-drops McFeely. His efforts to revive McFeely
text: resemble a WWF grudge match. Harris diving off of furniture,
text: slamming down on McFeely. Finally, he checks his pulse. He
text: thinks McFeely is dead. Harris shouts out at Megan.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Look what you've done!
text: Megan sits, quietly.
text: Harris dives on top of Megan and starts choking her.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Take me! Take me!
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE:
text: McFeely sits up, still drunk and disoriented. He notices
text: Harris on the bed.
speaker_heading: MCFEELY'S POV:
text: He sees Father Harris on his hands and knees. His robe is
text: hiked above his waist exposing his naked ass.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Take me! God damn you, take me!
text: McFeely, now on his feet, smiles as he moves toward Harris.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON:
text: Harris' face.
text: It turns to shock and horror. He looks possessed as we hear
text: the sound of penetration.
speaker_heading: HARRIS
dialog: Nooooo!!!!!
text: Harris dives out the window.
text: McFeely watches as Harris tumbles down the long staircase.
text: Megan begins to giggle.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: You failed, McFeely. Your weapons
dialog: are useless against me.
speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY
dialog: You're mistaken my child. The Lord
dialog: has greater weapons than me.
text: McFeely picks up his bible.
speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY
dialog: Hear the word of the Lord and be
dialog: humbled!
text: McFeely lifts up a crucifix.
speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY
dialog: See the cross of the Lord and tremble!
dialog: If ye still not have faith, then...
text: McFeely reaches into his jacket and pulls out a .44 magnum.
speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY
dialog: ...suck on this!!!
text: Megan's eyes widen.
dialog: BLAM!!!

dialog: I guess we were technically never

dialog: I was seeing him in school. I saw
dialog: him at the mall about six months ago
dialog: and I was too nervous to introduce
dialog: myself so I followed him to his car,
dialog: and jotted down the license plate
dialog: number. It was registered to his
dialog: mother, so I went to her house. She
dialog: was so nice. I mean, she seemed like
dialog: she would be nice 'cuz I never really
dialog: spoke to her. I just waited til she
dialog: went to work then I climbed in through
dialog: her window and borrowed her phone
dialog: book. I say borrowed because I'm
dialog: going to give it back one day. But
dialog: anyway, I called everyone in it til
dialog: I found her son. He wasn't home when
dialog: I called so I left this message how
dialog: much in love I was with him. I was,
dialog: and how I wanted to have his children.
dialog: Just really opening up, and he never
dialog: called back. I'd call and call, and
dialog: anyway, six months and two restraining
dialog: orders later I just decided I deserved
dialog: better. What about you? Do you have
dialog: a boyfriend?

speaker_heading: BRENDA

speaker_heading: STUDENT
dialog: There you go my man.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Hey, pal, I can handle a door by

speaker_heading: STUDENT
dialog: Fine.
text: The student let the doors go. They swing, smashing into

speaker_heading: STUDENT #2
dialog: Are you okay? Let me help you to the

speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: I am not handicapped! I can use the

speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: I finished all the interviews.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Let me see the files.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
text: They're on top of the bookshelf.
dialog: I'll get them.
text: Dwight wheels himself over to a bookshelf. As he attempts to
text: retrieve the folder, the professor moves to assist him.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Let me help you.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: I don't need your help. I'm perfectly
dialog: capable.
text: Dwight climbs the bookshelf, reaches the top, and lifts up
text: the folder. Just then, the bookshelf topples over on top of
text: Dwight. His hand extends from the mess, holding the folder.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Here you go, Professor.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Are these all the subjects?
text: Dwight, disheveled, glasses bent, gets back in his wheelchair
text: and makes his way over to the Professor.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey

dialog: asked for.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Any of them hot?
text: Dwight rolls his eyes.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: I also took the liberty of putting
dialog: those with near-death experiences on
dialog: top.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
text: Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized
dialog: co-eds are a sure thing.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: (dripping with contempt)
dialog: As I am sure you are aware, Professor,
dialog: subjects who are close to death are
dialog: statistically more likely to have
dialog: the suggestibility required for
dialog: paranormal investigation, which is,
dialog: of course, why I've given them special
dialog: consideration.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Look, whatever you say, kid, but the
dialog: more they're hurtin', the more they
dialog: need a squirtin', if you know what I
dialog: mean.
dialog: (then, off Cindy's
dialog: picture)
dialog: Ooh, I like her.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned

speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Willing? I like that.
dialog: (then, off Ray's
dialog: picture)
dialog: And, this one?
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite
dialog: figure him out, but he seemed very
dialog: eager and excited when we met.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: What's this?
text: Professor holds up another photo of Ray. In this one, he's
text: got his shirt off and his thumbs hooked in his jeans' pockets.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Oh, that's the picture he sent me
dialog: after our interview.
text: The Professor continues looking at the pictures and files of

speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Car accident, gun shot, multiple

dialog: Where did you find these kids?
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: They are the survivors of the

speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Fantastic. These kids are exactly
dialog: the kind of catalyst needed to awaken
dialog: Hell House.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: How are we going to get them all up
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: I'll make it part of the class. We'll
dialog: tell them they're participating in a

speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: And what happens when all hell breaks
dialog: loose?
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: We record and document it. We're
dialog: gonna make history, Dwight. The first
text: documented, unrefuted evidence of
dialog: life after death. The book sales
dialog: alone will be worth millions. I'll
dialog: be rich, and you my friend, will

speaker_heading: BUDDY

speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: My assistant, Dwight, will be passing

speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Would you like me to help you pass
dialog: them back?
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: I don't need your help.
text: Dwight tips over in the wheelchair and falls hard against

text: out the papers. Everyone reaches down to collect one from
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: You should arrive no later than 6PM
dialog: tonight, and plan to be there until
dialog: Monday. That's it for now. I'll see

text: Buddy catches up to Cindy.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Hey, you left your book back there.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Thanks. I'm Cindy.

speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: So, I see you're really into spooks.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: No. I never date outside my race.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I meant you're into ghosts.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about
dialog: that kind of stuff.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: So it looks like we're going to be
text: spending the weekend together.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Maybe we can study together or
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: I'm sorry, Buddy. You seem really
dialog: nice, but I'm just getting over a
dialog: really bad relationship, and I'm not
dialog: ready to start dating yet.
text: Buddy looks disappointed.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: (playfully)
dialog: Okay. See you later, friend.
text: She turns to walk away. Buddy notices the top of her panties,
text: grabs and yanks them up.
speaker_heading: BUDDY

scene_heading: ANSWERING MACHINE
dialog: No new messages.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Anybody home?

speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Hello?

speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Is anybody here?
text: She digs through the cushions of a chair and pockets some
dialog: change.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: I was told there'd be somebody here.
text: She opens a couple of pieces of mail and reads it, then...
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Hello? Your test results are in.
text: Cindy continues walking through a swinging door and finds
text: HANSON, a well-dressed man, middle-aged, with a short arm
text: and a little hand. He's in the middle of preparing food. He
text: holds a meat cleaver in his hand as he turns toward her.
text: Cindy is startled.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Oh my God! I'm here with the...
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: Yes, Professor Oldman's group. Forgive
dialog: me. I didn't mean to frighten you.
text: He puts down the cleaver, and moves his hand towards Cindy's
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: My aren't you a lovely child.

speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: (tapping her nose)
dialog: And what is your name?
text: Cindy, almost cross-eyed, watching his finger.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: I'm Cindy.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: (extending his hand)
dialog: I'm Hanson the caretaker.
text: Cindy reluctantly shakes his hand.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: I'll show you to your room. Let me
dialog: help you with that.
text: He grabs the luggage.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: Whoa, that's heavy. I better use my
text: strong hand.
text: He grabs the luggage with his little hand. The bag opens,
text: spilling all of Cindy's items over the floor.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: I'm so sorry. I'll get them.

speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Right. What about condoms?
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Professor!
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Hey, you're the one who brought up
dialog: safety. I'm perfectly willing to go

speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Would you please focus?
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Fine.
dialog: (then)
dialog: What's all this stuff?
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Well, this measures the amount of

dialog: to the tiniest molecular disturbances.
text: The Professor is distracted by a bank of monitors.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Are those cameras all throughout the
dialog: house?
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Yes, I thought that it would be best.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Even in the bathroom?
text: Dwight gestures to a monitor.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: So, if one of our little chickadees
dialog: is taking a shower which one of these

dialog: up?
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: That one.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: After dinner, you and I will take

speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: Excuse me, sir, but the students
dialog: have started to arrive. Dinner will
dialog: be ready shortly.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Thanks, handyman.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: I'm the caretaker, not the handyman.
dialog: (off Dwight's footwear)
dialog: Nice skates. Be careful. You don't

text: Hanson exits before Dwight can respond.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: I'm going to change for dinner.
dialog: I'll see you shortly.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT

speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: Well, are you boys just gonna stand

text: Cindy and Dwight reseat themselves.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Professor, is this the same house
dialog: that a young girl was possessed by a
dialog: demon or something?
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Yes, it was reported, but never
dialog: substantiated.
speaker_heading: SHORTY
dialog: Yeah, just like that charges regarding
dialog: me and that blind Haitian girl.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Pass me the salt.
text: Brenda tosses a handful of salt over her shoulder. It goes
text: into Dwight's face.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Hey, what are you doing?
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Keepin' evil spirits away. And if
dialog: that don't work I always got this.
text: Brenda pulls out a gun and cocks it.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Not to worry. There's been no reported
dialog: activity in the house for over twenty
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Let's not forget, folks, this is a
dialog: study on sleep disorders.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Ah, yes, which reminds me, who here
dialog: thinks they'd wake up if somebody
dialog: snuck into their room and started
text: sniffing between their legs?
text: Hanson rolls in a cart filled with a variety of food,
text: including a huge turkey.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Enough spooky stuff. Let's eat.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Well ain't we gonna bless this food
dialog: first?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Allow me... God is good, God is great,
dialog: but not all the time. Sometimes he
dialog: could be a real asshole, because it
dialog: seems as though every time I try to
dialog: establish a relationship with him,
dialog: he never returns my calls. I've been
dialog: praying for twenty-four years and I
dialog: haven't heard his voice yet. Not one
dialog: message on my answering machine.
dialog: Your miracles don't impress me. It's
dialog: your quality time I want. So, if you
dialog: hear me, and I know you're up there,
dialog: thanks for the food. It's the least
dialog: you can do. In Jesus' name, don't
dialog: let me get started on him, Amen.
text: Alex looks up to see everyone staring in awe.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: Anyone care for appetizers?
text: Everyone chimes in their request.
text: Hanson removes the long napkin draped over his arm, revealing
text: his short arm and little hand with its stubby fingers. He
text: uses this hand to hold the tray of appetizers. He offers
dialog: some to the Professor.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: Finger food?
text: Hanson walks around the table with the tray, offering.
text: Everybody reaches to take one. They realize that the
text: appetizers look creepily like Hanson's fingers. Cindy breaks
text: the tension and reaches for a roll.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: How about these buns?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Ray!!!
text: Ray pulls his finger from Buddy's ass. POP!
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Oh, my bad.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: Sure, I'll just set them down and
dialog: you can help yourself.
text: Everyone grabs a roll. Cindy takes a big bite.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Ummm!! They smell delicious.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: Thanks. I made them by hand.
text: Everyone drops their rolls. Cindy spits a mouthful into her
dialog: napkin.
speaker_heading: HANSON
text: The potatoes are just about ready.
dialog: Let me just go whip them up real
dialog: good.
text: He whips the potatoes. His knuckles dip into the bowl,
text: covering them with potatoes. Hanson licks his knuckles.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: Ah, that's good. Dig in.
text: Hanson places the bowl on the table.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: And now for the turkey.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Say, what do you say you let me do
dialog: that? You just relax. You've done
dialog: enough.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: Oh, nonsense. It's my pleasure.
text: Hanson raises a large knife, then rests his little hand on
text: the turkey to hold it steady.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: You know, making a turkey is a real
text: art. The trick is in the stuffing. A
dialog: lot of people are afraid to get their
dialog: hands dirty. Not me. When I stuff
dialog: it, I like to get the whole hand up
dialog: in there. And you know I use a secret
dialog: ingredient in the stuffing...
text: Hanson pulls out a box of "HAMBURGER HELPLESS" with a crippled
text: white glove on the box.
text: Everyone moans. Their appetites, ruined as Hanson continues
dialog: to tear up the turkey.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: Who's first? Anyone like a wing?
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Yours, or the turkeys?
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: I supposed you'd like a leg. How
dialog: about two?
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: That's it. I'm gonna put my food in
dialog: your ass. I should warn you, I'm a
text: black belt in karate.
text: Dwight pulls out a picture of himself in karate outfit lying
text: on the floor with one leg up in a pose.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: You don't scare me. I was a Golden
dialog: Gloves champion.
text: Hanson pulls out his own picture of himself, shirtless in a
text: boxing pose with a regular glove and a miniature glove on
text: his little hand.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Relax, Dwight.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I got an idea.
dialog: (to Hanson)
dialog: Is there anything you didn't make?
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: Well, the dessert. I ordered out.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Great. What do you say we just skip
dialog: the heavy stuff and go straight to
dialog: the dessert?
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: Well, I guess if that's what you all
dialog: wish.
text: Hanson goes to retrieve the dessert. He returns with a large
dialog: cream pie.
text: Everyone smiles. Hanson cuts a piece, slowly. Everyone watches
text: to see if he'll put his hands in it. He doesn't.
text: Hanson places the pie on Cindy's plate.
text: Cindy smiles. She's about to take a bite when Buddy sticks
text: his finger in the pie.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: My germs!
text: He takes the pie from Cindy, but before he can take a bite
text: Dwight sticks his finger in the pie.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: My germs! Ha, ha!
text: Everyone laughs.
text: The professor reaches to cut himself a piece of pie when...
text: Hanson shoves his finger in the pie.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: My germs! Ha, ha!
text: Everyone tosses down their napkins and gets up from the table.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: (licking his fingers)
dialog: Funny, I always win that game.

speaker_heading: SHORTY

speaker_heading: THEO

speaker_heading: RAY

text: starts spinning the bottles on her big tits!
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Professor, what's the history of
dialog: this house?
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: I'm glad you asked. It actually makes

text: The Professor picks up a children's book. "This Old Haunted
text: House." He sits in front of the fireplace.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Gather around.
text: Everyone gathers around the fireplace.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: This house was built in 1898 by a
dialog: man named Archibald Keaton as a gift
text: to his wife, Cora.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora...
dialog: Keaton... I am here to communicate...
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: No, they sold the house in 1920 to a
dialog: millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his
dialog: evil presence.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: No, he lost the house after the stock
dialog: market crash.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: But he could still be haunting the
dialog: house. He's angry that he had to
dialog: leave.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: He's not dead, you idiot. He lives

speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Anyway, the last owner was a very
dialog: rich man who built his empire off
dialog: the blood and sweat of the people in
dialog: this town. He lived like a king until
dialog: one day the servants of the house
dialog: killed him.
text: A log in the fireplace snaps, startling everyone.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: I think there's more to the story.
dialog: I can feel something evil in the
text: house. It's all around. In the wall,
dialog: the floor, this piano...
text: She strums the wire keys. One snaps and smacks her in the
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Ouch!!
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: No, you don't understand. It's here
dialog: in these statues...
text: She touches two statues, holding lights. They smash her in
text: the head. She staggers over to a Cuckoo clock.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: This clock...
text: The clock strikes twelve. The bird shoots out and pecks her
text: in the face. She falls into a mirror.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: This mirror...
text: Her own reflection punches her in the face.
text: Brenda sails against the wall. She sees a collection of swords
text: and knives displayed on the wall.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: These...
text: The knives start to rumble.
speaker_heading: GROUP
dialog: NO!!!
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: You're right. Not in the knives.
text: She turns to see on the adjacent wall, antique guns.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: It's in the guns.
text: BLAM! The gun fires. Brenda goes down.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: My God! Is she dead?
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: No, they're just powder burns, thank
dialog: God. They were empty. Get her
dialog: upstairs.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Maybe this house is possessed.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: No such thing. What you all witnessed
dialog: was psychosomatic, purely self-induced
text: reactions brought on by hysteria.
dialog: Now I want everyone to get some rest.
dialog: We will start our testing in the
dialog: morning.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LAB -- NIGHT
text: The Professor speaks into a tape recorder.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: The group responded beyond
dialog: expectation. Cindy and Brenda seemed
dialog: most susceptible to the suggestion
text: of horror. Brenda exhibiting both
dialog: delusion and hysteria. Group fear
dialog: should manifest itself and intensify
text: as the night progresses.
text: Dwight is reviewing the video tapes from earlier. He notices
text: an image on the tape.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Professor, I think you should see
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot?
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: No, these are the tapes from the
dialog: living room. Check this out.
text: Dwight rewinds the tape. We see Brenda being attacked.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
text: The image there.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Are you sure it's not the tape?
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: I don't think so. It's on all the
dialog: cameras, and check this out. The
text: thermal readings inside the house
dialog: dropped ten degrees when the image
dialog: was recorded.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.

speaker_heading: SHORTY

speaker_heading: CINDY

speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: That was a great idea, Shorty.
speaker_heading: SHORTY
dialog: I told you it would taste just like

text: Cindy and Shorty finish eating, and toss the final bones in
text: the box. Cindy closes the box, She notices something strange
text: in the kitchen.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE:
text: All the cabinet doors are open and the chairs are stacked on

speaker_heading: CINDY

speaker_heading: PROFESSOR

speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Professor, you guys gotta see this.
dialog: Dwight, come here.
text: Cindy grabs Dwight's chair, places him in a circle on the

speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: What the hell are you doing?
speaker_heading: CINDY

speaker_heading: A BEAT
text: Dwight's chair moves by itself, slamming Dwight head first
text: into the wall.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Yippie! Wasn't that amazing?
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: It's some kind of energy field. We
dialog: better record this.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Got my camera right here.
text: Professor grabs Dwight's chair. Dwight is still dazed as he
text: is placed back in the circle. Again, his chair flies forward,
text: slamming him into the wall.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: I got it!
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: That's fantastic. Our first

speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: Hello, hello?
text: She shrugs and continues to remove her make-up.
text: Theo notices a pimple.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: Damn.
text: SPLAT!!! Goo hits the mirror as she pops the pimple.
scene_heading: GHOST'S REACTION.
text: Theo reaches for a brush. As she looks down the mirror is
text: tipped-up by the ghost. She doesn't notice.
text: Theo looks up and notices something else. There's a booger
text: in her nose.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: Oh, my. How long has that been there?
text: She picks her nose and flicks the booger.
text: The booger lands on the ghost. We see it shaking wildly as
text: the ghost tries to get it off.
text: Theo lifts her foot up and cracks her toes. She examines her
dialog: feet.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: Oh, I need a pedicure.
text: She looks on the table for something.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: Shit, forgot my clippers. Aw, fuck

speaker_heading: GHOST (V.O.)

speaker_heading: THEO

speaker_heading: GHOST POV:

speaker_heading: CLOSE ON:

speaker_heading: REVEAL:
text: Theo's real breasts are saggy.
text: Theo scratches her breasts under, on top, and around the

speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: Ahhh, that's better.
text: She walks past the ghost still scratching, this time under
text: her arm.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: Whew, not fresh are we?
text: By now, the ghost is ready to give up. From his POV we see
text: he doesn't follow Theo.
text: Theo bends over to get something out of her bag.
speaker_heading: GHOST POV:
dialog: Theo's perfect ass.
text: He makes his move.
text: The Ghost CAMERA moves in on Theo's ass.
text: Just as he's about to attack, Theo farts, loudly, releasing

text: visible for an instant.
text: The Ghost, waving in front of his nose.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: Whew. I was holding that one in all
dialog: day.

speaker_heading: BUDDY

text: Cindy staggers to her feet.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: You know, Buddy, about this friendship
dialog: thing...
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think
dialog: it's so cool... have a girl as a
dialog: friend.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl.
dialog: You can't be so rough with me.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Then what kinda stuff can we do?
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Gentle stuff like talking, sharing
dialog: thoughts and ideas, secrets and past
dialog: experiences. Stuff like that, you
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: It sounds gay, but guess since you're
dialog: a girl it's okay, huh?
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check
dialog: something out. Will you come with
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (sweetly)
dialog: Sure. We can practice talking.
speaker_heading: CINDY

scene_heading: INT. MUSIC ROOM -- SHORT TIME LATER

speaker_heading: BUDDY

text: Cindy, annoyed.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Buddy...
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Wait, I'm just about to tell you the
dialog: best part.
text: Cindy notices something on the floor.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Oh my God. Look.
text: Bloodied footprints.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Dude, somebody's on the rag.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Shhh!
text: Buddy and Cindy follow the footsteps.
text: They lead to a secret passage.
text: Cindy opens it to REVEAL a secret room.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SECRET STUDY -- CONTINUOUS
text: It's an old, dark creepy study. Shelves of dust covered with
text: books, several paintings on the wall, an old wooden desk.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: It must be a private study, or
dialog: something.
text: Cindy finds an old newspaper.
text: Headline: "Servants Kill Hugh Kane." There's a picture of
text: HUGH KANE and an article on the killing.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: There's more to the story of this
dialog: house than the Professor told us. It
dialog: says here that Hugh Kane had a wife
dialog: who died mysteriously a week before
dialog: the servants killed him.
text: Buddy looks at the painting on the wall. He wipes away the
text: dust exposing the face.
text: The painting is of a woman. It looks like Cindy. She's wearing
text: a pendant around her neck.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Whoa, check this out. She looks like
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Wow, she's beautiful. You really
dialog: think she looks like me?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Her hair doesn't have as many split
dialog: ends at yours. Her skin isn't as
dialog: oily as yours, either. Also, sometimes
dialog: your eyes get kinda squinty and they
dialog: look like you might have Down's
dialog: Syndrome or something. Otherwise the
text: resemblance is uncanny.
text: Cindy is feeling terrible about herself now. For a moment we
dialog: think the criticism is done.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Oh yeah... another difference is she
text: looks more sophisticated and classy.
text: More feminine. And her tits are
dialog: perfect. Not pointy and funny looking,
dialog: or spaced too far apart...
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: Alright!
text: Cindy finds a small chest, ornately decorated. The name
text: "Carolyn" inscribed on it.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Buddy, look at this. I think it
dialog: belonged to her.
text: Suddenly, a loud noise.
text: Cindy and Buddy nearly jump out of their skin.
speaker_heading: REVEAL:
text: A BLACK CAT.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Come on, let's get out of here.
dialog: This place is giving me the creeps.

scene_heading: INT. BRENDA'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Shhh... It's okay.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Ray, have you been here all this
dialog: time?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I just wanted to make sure you were
dialog: okay.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: So, I guess I can go now.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: No, stay.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Yeah, I think I'll feel better

dialog: man.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Yeah, me too.
text: Brenda gives a confused look.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: I'm gonna take a shower. I'll be
dialog: right back.
text: Brenda exits.
text: Ray sits on the bed for a moment. He notices a clown doll
text: sitting in a rocking chair across the room. The moonlight
text: gives the clown face an eerie glow.
text: Ray takes off his shirt and tosses it at the clown, covering
text: its face an causing the chair to rock.
text: Ray gets down and does a few push-ups.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON:
text: The door. A fog-like mist comes into the room. Ray feels a
text: chill and checks the thermostat.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Damn, it's cold.
text: Ray goes to retrieve his shirt. He notices the clown is gone.
text: Ray looks around and doesn't see the clown doll anywhere.
text: Suddenly, a rustling noise comes from under the bed.
text: Ray's breathing, quickens. He knows where he must now look.
text: Ray slowly lowers himself head first to the floor of the
text: bed, in preparation to look under it.
text: He very, very carefully lifts the dust ruffle and lets the
text: top of his head touch the rug. Ray is upside-down as he looks
text: into the darkness under his bed.
text: Under the bed. The clown is there, face to face with him,
text: smiling sardonically.
text: In the split-second it takes for a child to draw a breath
text: and let it out through the vocal chords, the clown wraps its
text: five foot extension arms around Ray's neck, cutting off half
dialog: his air.
scene_heading: WIDE ANGLE HIGH.
text: Struggling now for his life, Ray is dragged helplessly under
text: the bed and out of sight. Under the bed we hear a struggle,
text: followed by the evil laugh of the clown.
speaker_heading: CLOWN DOLL (V.O.)
dialog: Hee! Hee! Hee! Hee!
speaker_heading: RAY (V.O.)
dialog: Oh, you want to play!
text: We hear more struggling.
speaker_heading: CLOWN DOLL (V.O.)
dialog: Hey, stop that? Homey don't play
dialog: that.
text: The clown attempts to climb from under the bed, only to be
text: dragged back under by Ray. Now we hear Ray laughing,
text: maniacally.
speaker_heading: RAY (V.O.)
dialog: Hee! Hee! Hee! Hee!
speaker_heading: CLOWN DOLL (V.O.)
dialog: No! No! Noooooo!!!
scene_heading: INT. BRENDA'S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Are you okay? I thought I heard
text: screaming.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON:
text: The clown doll. His pants are down by his ankles. His head
text: turns to the camera. His smile is gone, replaced by a frown.
text: A single tear is running down his face.
scene_heading: INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
text: The window blows open. Curtains flutter in the wind.
text: Alex sleeping. Her head back, her mouth open. She snores,
text: lightly, unaware of the presence in the room. A breeze brushes
text: past her causing her hair to move. Alex remains asleep.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON:
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: The ghost pulls up her t-shirt to reveal a pair of perfect
dialog: breasts.
text: Her breasts get squeezed at the base, and bulge out like
text: water balloons, but she still doesn't wake up.
text: The GHOST continues kissing her neck.
text: Alex moans, still sleeping.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON:
speaker_heading: ALEX'S FACE
text: Her mouth opens wider. We see a growing indentation in her
text: cheek as if something is going in and out of her mouth.
text: Suddenly, Alex's eyes open. She sits up and tries to speak.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Mmph! Mmph!
text: The back of her head stretches to the shape of a penis.
text: Alex struggles with the force, finally breaking free.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Somebody help! Help!
text: The ghost pins her to the bed and attacks her. Throwing her
text: arms over her head, Alex screams.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (startled)
dialog: Ah!
text: Then throwing her legs behind her head, she screams again.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Oh! Okay.
text: The ghost starts fucking Alex. He's very rough and dominate.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (intrigued)
dialog: Oh, my God. Yes! Yes!
text: The ghost drags her up the wall and over a portrait of a
text: solemn looking man.
text: Then Alex's butt slides over his face and the man is now
text: smiling.
text: The ghost drags her across the ceiling and crashes her head
text: into the light fixture.
text: The sexual Olympics continue as she spider-walks down the
text: wall and is dragged across the floor, smoke comes up from
text: beneath her.
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: Oooh. Oooh. Rug burn. Rug burn.
text: The ghost gets Alex back to the bed and flips her over to
text: reveal tire skid marks down her back.
text: Still the sexcapades continue.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
text: The bedroom window is totally fogged over when Alex's hand

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: INT. CINDY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

text: startled by the sound of the door creaking open.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: (nervous)
dialog: Who's there?
text: The black cat enters. Cindy gives a sigh of relief.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Hey, kitty, kitty. How you doin'
dialog: girl?
text: The cat pauses and gives her the finger by flicking his claw
text: out with the gesture.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Huh?
text: Suddenly, the cat attacks grabbing and scratching her throat.
text: Cindy tosses the cat off and jumps to her feet.
text: The cat lands and pounces right back.
text: Cindy catches it and throws it down harder, sending it
text: crashing into a table which smashes into pieces.
text: Cindy and the cat circle each other.
text: The cat grabs a bottle from the table, breaks it, holding
text: the jagged side out towards Cindy.
text: The cat jumps on Cindy, knocks her to the floor, pinning her
text: down. The cat tries to shove the broken bottle into Cindy's
dialog: face.
text: Cindy, desperately, holds back the cat's paw. Her teeth
text: gritting with effort.
text: Cindy slowly turns the bottle towards the cat, who now looks
dialog: worried.
text: Cindy makes her move, flipping the cat over. Now, she's on
text: top pushing the bottle close to the cat's throat.
text: The cat gives a huge effort and shoves Cindy off of itself.
text: Fighting dirty, the cat reaches into its litter box and throws
text: some of the sand in Cindy's eyes. The cat then picks up a
text: chair and breaks it over Cindy's head, then jumps on her
text: back and tries to strangle her with piano wire. But Cindy
text: manages to flip the cat forward over her shoulder.
text: Cindy runs into the bathroom and locks herself inside.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CINDY'S BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: REVEAL:

text: hole for the kitty to reach in and turn the knob.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Somebody help me!
text: Cindy is desperate. She looks for anything that might save
text: her. Cindy grabs a ball of yarn.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Here, kitty, kitty. Look...
text: Cindy plays with the yarn.
text: The cat can't resist. He wants the yarn.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Go get it.
text: Cindy tosses the ball of yarn, it flies out the window. The

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CINDY'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS
text: Cindy staggers out of the bathroom, bloodied clothes torn.

speaker_heading: THEO

speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: Come on. We better get you cleaned

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT -- SHORT TIME LATER
text: Theo tends to Cindy's wounds. The professor pours a cup of
dialog: tea.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: I'm telling you, it was possessed.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Theo, did you see the animal?
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: No, I just heard the commotion, and
dialog: when I got there I guess it was gone.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: What, you think I did this to myself?
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: No, I'm just saying cats are known
dialog: to be very territorial animals, and
dialog: it is likely it did attack, but it
dialog: doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe
dialog: the two of you should sleep together.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: What are you getting at, Professor?
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Only that if this cat did attack,
dialog: he's less likely to come back if the
dialog: two of you were, let's say, together.
dialog: Come on, it's college. Time for you
dialog: two to experiment.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: Cindy, I don't think we're going to
dialog: get any help here.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Actually, I'd be more than willing
dialog: to walk you through it.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: Come, Cin, I'll make sure you're
text: tucked in.
text: Theo and Cindy rise to exit.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Good idea, and don't forget to give

speaker_heading: CINDY

speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: Good-night, Cin. I'll be next door
dialog: if you need me.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Thanks, I'll be fine.
text: Cindy closes the door and walks to her bed. She notices a
text: picture has fallen off the night stand.
text: Cindy places it back on the nightstand.
text: Cindy turns to climb into bed when she hears the picture
text: fall again. This time the frame breaks, revealing a key hidden
text: in the frame.
text: Cindy examines the key. She gets an idea.
text: Cindy retrieves the chest she found in the secret study form
text: beneath her bed. She places the key in the hole and turns
dialog: it.
text: The chest opens.
text: Cindy finds several items.
dialog: Pictures of Carolyn.
dialog: A diary.
text: An old fashioned dildo.
text: The pendant worn by Carolyn in the photos.
text: Cindy walks to the mirror, slowly placing the pendant around
text: her neck. She looks up into the mirror. Her eyes have a
text: strange look. She slowly turns and looks at the bedroom door.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN -- LATER THAT NIGHT

speaker_heading: PROFESSOR

speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Forbidden fruit.

speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Got a problem with that?
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's
dialog: gotten into you?
text: He snatches the apple back.
text: Cindy walks over to a basket of fruit on the counter and
text: picks up a banana.
text: Provocatively, she peels it and, looking deep in his eyes,

text: gagging and coughing.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Gock -- gock -- gock...
text: Finally, realizing that something is wrong, the Professor

text: Recovering, she sits back down on the stairs, continuing her

speaker_heading: THE PROFESSOR
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR

text: The Professor watches, seductively.
text: Cindy spreads her legs, lifts the front of her dress. A strong
text: gust of air comes from between her legs, blowing out the
text: candle. The wind is so strong, it begins to blow papers and
dialog: the Professor back.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: There. That's better.
text: Cindy gets up and walks over to the Professor. Only the desk
text: stands between them. Cindy grabs him by his tie, choking him

speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: I take it you're not mad at me.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: I wouldn't go that far.
text: She grabs his belt and pulls him into her, then holds the

text: Cindy rips open his shirt to reveal unusually large nipples
dialog: for a man.
text: Then unbuckling his belt and pants to reveal an adult diaper

speaker_heading: PROFESSOR

speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: (pinning him down)
dialog: Why don't you shut up, Professor?
dialog: Just relax.

dialog: eyes.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: I think she's starting to suspect
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: (Confused)
dialog: Who?
text: Suddenly, Cindy's face turns into RAY'S FACE.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Your wife!
text: The Professor screams, then pushed RAY off him. He gets up

dialog: the room.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON:

speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Oh, my God. It happened right here.

speaker_heading: DWIGHT

speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: That's why we came here, remember?
speaker_heading: DWIGHT

text: legs then tears it off.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Ouch!
text: She checks the strip to reveal her pussy lips stuck to the
dialog: strip.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Oops.
text: She puts them back between her legs.
text: She rises and walks over to the old 19th century-style
text: portrait of the supposed ghost, which once hung prominently
text: downstairs. It now sits propped up in a corner of her room
text: with a shrine set up all around it consisting of candles,
text: little "I love you" hearts, and her vibrator.
text: Alex walks over to the portrait, regards it lovingly for a
text: moment, and then kisses the figure sweetly on the lips. Then
text: she works her way down the portrait -- hungrily kissing,
text: nibbling, and licking. When she pulls back, seductively, the
text: cobwebs, dust and spiders that were clinging to the portrait
text: are now all over her face. She doesn't care, she simply
text: brushes them aside -- she's in love.

dialog: This one goes out to that someone
dialog: special from Alex over at the Hell
dialog: House. She says that even though you
dialog: two have only known each other for a
text: short time now, she feels a certain
dialog: connection to you that she's never
dialog: felt with any man alive. And even if
dialog: it doesn't work out between you two,
dialog: she wants you to know that there
dialog: will always be a special place for
dialog: you in the heart. So, Poltergeist,
dialog: this one's for you.
text: Alex climbs into bed and spreads rose petals all around.
text: Everything's ready. She sits back and waits.
text: While she waits, she puts the time to good use by doing some
text: sexual calisthenics. She lies flat on her back, sticks her
text: legs in the air, and stretches them wide apart a few times.
dialog: One-two-three-, one-two-three.
text: Then she gets on all fours and does a few stick-your-ass-
text: high-in-the-air stretches. One-two-three.
text: Then she does the simulated oral sex gesture, first with the
text: right hand, then with the left, making sure her forearms are
dialog: nice and loose. One-two-three, one-two-three.
text: A few facial and mouth exercises and she's done.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Well, I'm going to sleep now. So, if
dialog: there's some ghostly man out there
dialog: who wants to take advantage of me,
dialog: there's probably nothing that I will
dialog: be able to do about it because I'm
dialog: really a heavy sleeper! Okay, here I
dialog: go.
text: Alex gets under the covers and pretends to fall asleep.
text: A beat and Alex opens her eyes and looks around.
speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT STAIRS -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Dwight leads everyone to the basement door. He opens it. A
text: long flight of concrete steps.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Those steps look kind of hard. I'm
dialog: gonna need some help.
text: By now, the group is so used to Dwight going down steps,
text: they simply give him a push.
text: Dwight goes tumbling down the hard steps. The gang running
text: behind him.
text: Dwight lands hard at the bottom of the steps. The group

speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: (heroic)
dialog: Don't mind me. Save yourselves.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LAB -- CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: What are we gonna do?
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: We have to destroy him.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: How we gonna destroy what we can't

speaker_heading: SHORTY
dialog: I got it! We shave off our pubic

dialog: days. What? Ya'll never had crabs?
text: Dwight rolls over to a complex machine with a circle marked
text: on the floor in front of it.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Ghosts are just energy fields. We
dialog: can capture that energy. We can
dialog: dissipate it! But in order to do
dialog: that, we've got to get him in here.
text: On that spot.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: That's great Einstein. How are we
dialog: gonna do that? There's a powerful

speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: He's right. I should go first.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: He's so brave.
text: Dwight rolls over to a supply cabinet, opens it and starts
dialog: to hand out equipment.
text: Dwight is arming the teenagers, giving them each a strange
text: looking gun.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: These are highly experimental guns
dialog: that emit a bolt of concentrated
dialog: energy able to damage ectoplasmic
dialog: cells, giving it the ability to injure
dialog: or even destroy a ghost. There is no
dialog: ammunition. You only get three shots
dialog: a piece, so use it very wisely.
text: Goofing with his gun, shorty fires it at Brenda's butt,
dialog: burning it.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Hey!
text: Shorty laughs.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Conserve your ammunition!
speaker_heading: SHORTY
dialog: Sorry... right, right...
text: Shorty is startled by a cockroach and shoots it.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: The only way we're going to track
dialog: down these ghosts is if we're all
dialog: wearing one of these...
text: Dwight pulls out a DICK PUMP! They all look at him crossed.
text: Dwight realizes what he's holding in his hand.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: A dick pump?
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: I mean these!
text: Dwight holds up a pair of goggles.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: These are thermo-goggles.
text: The kids are putting on their goggles, trying them out.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: These can be used to track the ghosts.
dialog: These goggles work on the principle
dialog: of body heat. They're so powerful,
dialog: they'll even show where body fluids
dialog: of any kind have been recently, even
dialog: if it been wiped clean.
text: The kids look at each other and notice Dwight has goo in his
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: He may be invisible, but we have the
dialog: advantage of being armed with the
dialog: most innovative and complex high-
dialog: tech equipment known to man.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: How are we gonna stay in touch with
dialog: one another? Do we have walkie-talkies
dialog: or something?
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: No, we have these.
text: Dwight brings out several sets of two paper-cups with a string
text: attaching the two. The string is only about 10-15 feet long.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: All the money was spent on the guns
text: and the goggles.
text: He hands them out.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Let's get that bastard!
text: Alex points her gun at the group.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: No, I won't let you do it.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Alex, what are you doing?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Shut up, you slut. You think you can

speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: Let her go, Cin.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: But he'll kill her!
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: That means more screen time for us.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Alright, let's split up.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Every time some scary shit goes down
dialog: and we need to stick together, you
dialog: white folks always say "Let's split
dialog: up."
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: She's right. We should stick together.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Baby?

speaker_heading: ALEX

text: Alex swings the doors open and enters the dining room.
text: Almost immediately, she's pulled (by the ghost) across the

text: Alex is dying.
text: Theo enters.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: Oh my god! Alex!

speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: THEO

speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: Never happened!

speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: SHORTY
dialog: Yo, son, why me? What you want with

speaker_heading: GHOST
dialog: Boo!
speaker_heading: SHORTY
dialog: Leave me alone. Stay away from me.

speaker_heading: CINDY

speaker_heading: BRENDA

speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Aw, shit girl. This what you're
dialog: running from? He ain't nothing but a
dialog: skeleton. His skinny little ass can't
dialog: hurt anybody.
text: Brenda just stands her ground. This skeleton runs up and
text: grabs Brenda by the arm. Brenda makes a face as if she's not
dialog: very impressed.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: What?... this ain't shit.
text: With the skeleton still gripping her arm, Brenda raises her
text: arm, effortlessly lifting the skeleton off the ground. It
text: hangs there, looking worried and looking down at it's feet
dialog: dangling.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: (to Cindy)
dialog: It's just a bunch of old bones. No
dialog: muscle, no strength. He hardly even
dialog: weighs anything.
text: She flicks the skeleton off her arm. It hits the ground.
text: Dazed, it gets back on it's feet. Brenda stomps her feet and
text: moves like she's going to jump at it. The skeleton cowers,
text: throwing up its arms and looking scared.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: What you gonna do?
text: As the skeleton tries to run, Brenda plucks off its head.
text: Cindy smiles, realizing the skeleton poses no threat.
speaker_heading: SKELETON HEAD
dialog: Hey, give it back.
text: Brenda and Cindy play Keep-Away with the skull. The skeleton's
text: headless body running back and forth between them, arms
text: flailing, trying desperately to get its head back.
text: Finally, Cindy catches the skull, moves aside and sticks her
text: leg out, tripping the body. It tumbles to the wall and lies
dialog: there.
text: Brenda reaches down and grabs the bottom section of the
text: skeleton's spine, destabilizing the body. Like a house of

speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Oh my God, the ghost has Buddy!
dialog: Brenda do something!
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Okay.

text: He sees flowers placed around his portrait.
text: A vase of roses on his desk.
text: There are a pair of woman's panties on the desk lamp. He
text: picks them up to inspect them. Disgusted, he throws the
text: panties on the floor.
text: The ghost then catches sight of a three-layered wedding cake
text: set on a table.
text: Finally, he sees that Alex has pasted a photo of her face,
text: over the face of his beloved Carolyn in her portrait. This

speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: That we should take our friendship a

speaker_heading: BUDDY

text: The ghost ducks and the shot misses him.
text: Dwight is dragged painfully through the hallway smashing
text: into open doors, statues, cupboards. Finally, Dwight leaps
text: back into the chair.
text: Not a moment to soon. The ghost chair whips in front of
dialog: Dwight.
text: Dwight thinks fast. He uses a broken table as a ramp. He
dialog: catches some good air.
text: Dwight lands, slams on the brakes, sending his chair tipping
text: forward. Dwight shows his skills by spinning his chair as it
text: balances on the front wheels.
text: Dwight and the ghost chair now are at opposite ends of the
dialog: hall.
text: The scene plays very dramatic and in SLOW-MOTION. Dwight in
text: his wheelchair at one end of the hall and the ghost in his
text: wheelchair at the other end. WHITE DOVES begin to flutter
text: through the hallway ala a "JOHN WOO" movie.
text: One of the doves flies by in slow motion. It plops right on
text: his face.
text: The tires of Dwight's wheelchair begin spinning and squealing,
text: burning rubber and causing smoke to come from the tire.
text: The ghost's wheelchair tires burn rubber and starts barreling
text: toward Dwight at full (wheelchair) speed. Dwight starts
text: rolling with all his might toward the ghost in his wheelchair.
text: Coming towards each other like the motorcycle scene in "MI:2".
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON:
scene_heading: THE GHOST'S WHEELCHAIR
text: It speeds towards Dwight.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON:
text: DWIGHT IN HIS WHEELCHAIR
text: He speeds toward the ghost in his chair. Dwight is going so
text: fast that his hair is blowing back and bugs start splattering
text: up against his face and sunglasses.
text: Like two speeding trains, Dwight and the ghost are headed
text: right towards one another.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON:
speaker_heading: DWIGHT'S WHEELCHAIR
text: One of his tires blows out. We see that it reads "FIRESTONE."
text: Dwight still races towards the ghost. Right when they are
text: about to collide head on, Dwight leaps up out of his
text: wheelchair and the ghost leaps out of his wheelchair.
text: The two wheelchairs impact and EXPLODE!!!
text: Dwight goes to grab the ghost, but he goes right through it
text: and goes crashing out of the window at the end of the hallway.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Noooo!!!!!
scene_heading: EXT. HELL HOUSE -- NIGHT
text: Dwight, dangling from a statue on the house exterior. He's
text: slipping, losing his grip.
text: Suddenly, in the window above, appears Hanson. He extends
text: his little arm out to Dwight.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: Here. Take my hand.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON:
text: Hanson's nubby little hand.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: Come on. Take it.
text: Dwight can't bring himself to touch the little hand. He looks
text: at the ground below. It's sure death if he falls.
text: Hanson reaches further. We see his fingers as they touch
text: Dwight's hand.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Ahhhh!!!
text: Dwight lets go and falls to his death.
scene_heading: INT. FREEZER -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Frost has built up on the window. Icicles hang off of our
dialog: heroes.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (practically frozen
dialog: stiff)
dialog: What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I
dialog: can't move, I'm so cold.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: (rubbing his legs)
dialog: Can you feel that?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: No. Try a little higher.
text: Cindy starts rubbing his thighs.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Feel that?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (enjoying it)
dialog: No. Keep rubbing.
text: Cindy starts rubbing harder.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Better try a little higher.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: (catching on)
dialog: Now, come on -- you know I'm not
dialog: ready for that kind of --
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Cindy, please! It's a matter of life
dialog: and death. I'm asking you a friend.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Well... okay... but only as a friend.
text: Cindy makes ready to start rubbing Buddy's dick. Buddy leans
text: back, getting ready to enjoy it. He puts his arms around his
dialog: head, but then realizes that this whole thing depends on
text: Cindy believing that he can't move his arms, so he quickly
text: puts them back where they were before Cindy realizes what
dialog: he's done.
text: Cindy is still rubbing Buddy's crotch.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I'm coming!
speaker_heading: BUDDY EXPLODES
text: Cindy, eyes wide as she looks down. She jumps back just as
text: the goo flies towards her.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON:
text: The goo. It freezes in mid-air.
text: Cindy knows there's no more time to waste.
text: She desperately scrambles for a way out. She tries the door,
text: but it's bolted shut. She looks over to see some loose nuts
text: and bolts, a wire and a defibrillator. She goes to work
text: piecing something together, MacGyver-style.
text: Quick cuts of her snapping a wire loose.
text: She magnetizes the nuts and bolts.
text: She turns on the defibrillator.
text: We pull back to reveal Cindy has built with the loose scraps
text: a CAT BULLDOZER.
text: Cindy helps Buddy out of the freezer.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: You stay here. I've got to warn the
dialog: others.
text: Cindy exits.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: (into her cup)
dialog: Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
speaker_heading: RAY (V.O.)
dialog: This is Ray. What's up? Where are
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: CINDY
text: The ghost is close. He almost got
dialog: us. Buddy is hurt.
speaker_heading: RAY (V.O.)
dialog: What's your location? I repeat, what's
dialog: your location?
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Right behind you.
speaker_heading: REVEAL:
text: Cindy standing behind Ray.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Roger that we're on our way over.
text: Ray turns to Cindy.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Where's Shorty?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I don't know. He was right behind me
dialog: a minute ago.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN -- LATER
text: MUSIC: The same gentle piano music as in "Hannibal."
text: Cindy walks into the kitchen and sees Shorty seated at he
text: table, strapped to a chair. Hanson is nearby, grilling
text: something on a portable grill and conversing amiably with
dialog: Shorty.
text: Alarmed, Cindy grabs a snow globe.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON SNOW GLOBE:
text: Cindy hides the snow globe behind her back.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: Ah, Cindy. Sit down, dear. Dinner's
dialog: almost ready.
text: Cindy manages a smile and nears the table.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: Oh, and the little weapon you're
dialog: hiding? Put it on the table.
text: Caught, Cindy sheepishly places the snow globe on the table
text: and moves to sit.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: Come now, give it up.
text: Cindy pulls a heavy little statuette from under her shirt
text: and clunks it down next to the snow globe.
text: Hanson shakes his head no and gestures for her to come clean
dialog: with what else she has.
text: Cindy keeps pulling out more weaponry, tossing it on the
text: table. A bear-trap, a crowbar, a medieval battle axe, a
text: crossbow, case of dynamite, and a Star Wars lightsaber, which
text: she turns on and tosses onto the pile.
text: Cindy sits. Hanson goes back to his cooking.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Shorty, are you alright? Speak to
dialog: me!
text: Shorty is slumped and dazed, drooling on himself. Cindy
text: notices some hypodermic needles, chloroform and a rag.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: (to Hanson)
dialog: Morphine? chloroform? Horse
dialog: tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: No, actually, I found him like this.
dialog: That's his stuff.
text: With growing alarm, Cindy notices a cookbook on the table:
text: "Martha Stewart's Easy Brain Recipes", featuring a picture
text: of a pleasantly smiling Martha Stewart on the cover, her
text: mouth and chin soaked in blood and gore, clutching a chewed
text: brain in her hand.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: Sit down and join us, Cindy.
speaker_heading: SHORTY
dialog: (to Cindy)
dialog: Yeah, I always wanted to watch you
dialog: eat.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: She'd have to be really pretty and
dialog: I'd have to be very drunk.
speaker_heading: SHORTY
dialog: (delirious)
dialog: I'm going to work in Washington,
dialog: Cindy.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Are you?
speaker_heading: SHORTY
dialog: That's where my best customers are.
dialog: Marion Berry, George Bush, the
dialog: Redskins. I'd like to offer you a
dialog: job, Cindy. Can you type? Take
dialog: dictation? Swallow balloons filled
dialog: with cocaine?
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: Now you're being rude, Shorty.
speaker_heading: SHORTY
dialog: Washington is full of cornpone country
dialog: pussy -- just ask Jesse Jackson.
text: Hanson puts down his spatula and steps to Shorty.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: Alright! Everyone ready for the main
dialog: course?
text: Hanson pulls off Shorty's sweatband and take a can opener to
text: Shorty's head, running it all the way around the crown as
text: Cindy looks on in horror.
text: Cindy gasps as Hanson lifts off the top of Shorty's head,
text: revealing his brain. It's a sad sight. Small and
text: underdeveloped, it's surrounded by smoke. Corroded and half
text: smoked away. There's a small band-aid on it.
text: Hanson puts the top of Shorty's skull on his own head, hair
dialog: and all.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: (a la Shorty, gesturing
dialog: with a little hand)
dialog: Yo son, check this out.
speaker_heading: SHORTY
dialog: Dog, you look hot.
text: Hanson grabs a knife and goes to carve the brain.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Hanson, please.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself
text: feels no pain.
text: Hanson cuts into it. The brain screams in fright and shrinks
text: away from the knife, compressing itself into a corner of
text: Shorty's skull.
text: Hanson stabs over and over, the brain gracefully avoiding
text: being cut, moving from corner to corner of the skull. It
text: trembles.
text: Hanson watches and aims carefully, finally sticking the knife
text: into the brain.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: It's such a fascinating organ.
text: Hanson points out a section.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: This part here controls intelligence.
dialog: Watch what happens when I touch it.
text: Hanson touches it.
speaker_heading: SHORTY
dialog: (suddenly smart, with
dialog: a British accent)
dialog: Salutations, offspring. The fecal
dialog: matter is infirm. By the by, I do
dialog: not wish to monopolize the
dialog: conversation, but I believe I've
dialog: just figured out the cure for cancer.
dialog: It's really quite simple --
text: Hanson takes his finger off the brain and points out another
dialog: section:
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: And this part controls a person's
dialog: manners.
text: Shorty starts to belch and fart uncontrollably, wetting his
dialog: pants.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Stop touching his brain!
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: Um, I'm not touching anything.
speaker_heading: SHORTY
dialog: Sorry, y'all. My bad.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: Shorty, why don't you say grace?
speaker_heading: SHORTY
dialog: Me? Grace? Okay -- Dear God --
text: Just as Shorty bows his head, the little brain plops out
text: onto the table. Hanson picks it up and puts it back in.
speaker_heading: SHORTY
dialog: Amen.
text: Hanson now carves a little section of the brain.
speaker_heading: HANSON
text: This part removes the sense of humor.
speaker_heading: SHORTY
dialog: I am Tom Green, I am Tom Green.
dialog: Daddy want some sausage, sausage.
dialog: Daddy want some sausage...
text: Hanson drops the piece of brain on the frying pan.
text: Cindy looks over and looks at the grill Hanson is using. A
text: logo in the side reads: "the George Foreman Brain Grill",
text: with a picture of George Foreman's smiling head next to the
text: words. The top of George Foreman's head is missing, revealing
text: his brain.
text: Hanson takes the brain tidbit off the pan -- it has grill
text: marks now, and serves it to Shorty.
text: Shorty starts hooking up the piece of brain with the hot
dialog: sauce, pepper, salt, "A-1" steak sauce, melted velveta cheese,
dialog: etc...
text: Hanson starts scraping the leftovers off the dishes into
text: Shorty's head.
text: Cindy grabs the snowglobe and goes after Hanson, but Hanson
text: grabs her just as it's about to strike and slams her back
text: against the refrigerator, getting in her face, locking her
text: hair in the door and breaking off the handle.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell
dialog: me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Not in a thousand years.
text: Hanson leans in and presses a kiss against Cindy's lips.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: (muffled)
dialog: Stop! --
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: (pulling away)
dialog: Made you say it!
text: Suddenly OFF SCREEN we hear handcuffs clicking closed.
text: Pull back and reveal that she's handcuffed his small hand to
text: her. The handcuff is extremely loose on his hand.
text: OFF SCREEN Hanson hears Brenda and Theo approaching. Looking
text: around, he grabs a cleaver. Then he slams his and Cindy's
text: cuffed hands on the kitchen counter.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: It looks like I'll have to give you
dialog: something to remember me by... This
dialog: is really going to hurt.
text: Cleaver come down hard.
text: CU of Cindy screaming in SLO-MO.
text: REVEAL Hanson's crooked penis on the counter, the foreskin
dialog: cut-off.
speaker_heading: HANSON
dialog: I've been meaning to do this since
dialog: my Bar Mitzvah... Here.
text: Hanson hands her the piece of foreskin.
text: As she stares at in horrified shock, Hanson slips his baby
text: hand out of the cuffs, no problem, and runs off.
text: Cindy runs after him, hair still caught, dragging the
text: refrigerator after her.
text: Theo and Brenda arrive.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Cindy, what's going on?
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get
dialog: him!
text: The girls free Cindy and they run off. Cindy's hair is frozen
text: stiff in the air with a pork chop stuck to it. They leave
text: Shorty behind, passed out at the table.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LAB -- LATER
text: Ray and Buddy are scoping out the area.
text: Suddenly, there's a knock at the door.
text: As the knob begins to turn, Buddy and Ray take aim.
text: The door opens. A very disheveled Dwight, on his hands and
text: knees, appears.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Ouch...
speaker_heading: (ALTERNATE)
dialog: Mommy...
text: Buddy and Ray help Dwight into a chair.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Dwight, are you okay?
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: I can't feel my legs.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You never could feel your legs.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: What do you know about it?!... Listen,
dialog: the ghost is too powerful. The only
dialog: chance we have is to use this machine.
dialog: (to Buddy)
dialog: I need you to go get the others and
dialog: meet us upstairs.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Okay...
text: Buddy runs out.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: (hesitantly)
dialog: Alright... I might need your help.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: My help?
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: A little bit... Give me your belt.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I'm not even wearing any drawers.
dialog: Forget about a belt.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Okay, give me my belt.
text: Ray checks Dwight's pants.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You're not wearing a belt.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Alright, go to the belt store...
dialog: As they continue, we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY --NIGHT
text: Cindy, Brenda, and Theo start to lose articles of clothing.
text: Cindy removes a pin and lets down her hair.
scene_heading: MUSIC CUE: INDEPENDENT WOMAN
speaker_heading: REVEAL:
dialog: Our girls now resemble "Charlie's Angels."
text: Hanson comes upon a locked gate and cartwheels between it.
text: Brenda and Theo brace their hand and help Cindy over the
dialog: gate.
text: Cindy leaps over the fence and grabs a chain hanging from
text: the ceiling and swings toward the Hanson. She kicks him in
text: the chest. He falls to the floor.
text: Cindy drops from the chain as Brenda and Brenda climb the
text: gate in cat-like fashion.
text: Hanson rises to his feet and strikes a defensive pose.
text: It's Cindy and Hanson. She takes a running leap and kick at
text: Hanson ala Cameron Diaz in "Charlie's Angels." She slowly
text: moves through the air at him until Hanson picks up a bat.
text: Cindy sees this and begins to back peddle, but it's too late.
text: Hanson swings and connects. SWACK!! He beans her in the head
text: and she goes flying.
text: The girls gather again on the other side in front if a
text: fountain and assume the famous "Charlie's Angels" pose with
text: Theo and Brenda holding one leg up as Cindy squats in the
text: middle. Now with the fountain behind them, it appears all
text: girls are taking a piss.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE:
text: The girls are closing in. Hanson knows it.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: Brenda!
text: Hanson snatches one of Brenda's braids and runs it under his
text: nose smelling it like the villain in "Charlie's Angels."
text: Brenda, angry, assumes a fierce, expert looking Kung Fu pose --
text: but then breaks into a girlish schoolyard fighting technique,
text: arms pin-wheeling, etc.
text: Hanson then takes on Theo. She runs to back wall, flips and
text: roundhouse kicks him.
text: Hanson throws Theo into a wall.
text: Her boobs expand and break her fall.
text: It's now just Cindy and Hanson. Cindy begins to display
dialog: different Kung Fu fight techniques.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: The Crane style!
text: She does CRANE-like fighting moves --
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: The Crouching Tiger style!
text: She does TIGER-like fighting moves --
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: The Drunk Monkey!
text: Cindy starts stumbling around the room, acting drunk and
text: making monkey noises.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: The Mad Cow!
text: Cindy frowns, making a mad face and starts "mooing" like a
dialog: cow!
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: The Horny dog!
text: Cindy begins humping Hanson's leg wildly. Then she gets
text: carried away with her impressions of different animals, a
text: deer, a bear, etc. Hanson watches her totally entertained.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: The Camel Toe!
text: This move disgusts Hanson.
text: Cindy does the "Crouching Tiger" tornado-spin upwards and
text: land on a higher level, (JOKE TO COME).
text: Cindy finishes her moves and backs-up as Hanson starts to
dialog: short circuit.
text: The girls run in and they all watch the ghost starting to
dialog: combust.
text: Buddy runs up from the hall to the fence.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: You gotta get out of there!
text: He holds open the gate as the girls run down the hall.
text: They give one last look back as Hanson explodes.
text: Buddy, Brenda, Cindy and Theo run to the lab.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LAB -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Buddy, Brenda, Cindy and Theo enter to find Ray and Dwight
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: There's only one thing left to do.
dialog: You guys, go upstairs and get the
dialog: machine ready!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MUSIC ROOM/FOYER -- MOMENTS LATER
text: The group is gathered. Dwight is strapped to Ray's back.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Someone is going to have to lure him
text: onto the platform.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: I'll go.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Cindy, let me...
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Actually, I was going to say let me
dialog: have your computer if you die.
text: Cindy moves to the foyer.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Cool, but remember, as soon as he
dialog: gets on the platform you gotta get
text: out of there.
speaker_heading: (ALTERNATE:)
dialog: Nobody wants to go.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Alright, let's take a vote...
dialog: Rest to come...
text: Cindy crosses into the foyer. Buddy, Ray, Dwight, and Theo
text: stand in the doorway.
text: The machine is gathered at the bottom of the steps. Cindy
text: moves about, yelling to the ghost.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Hugh Kane, it's me you want, come
dialog: get me! I'm not afraid anymore! Show
dialog: yourself!
text: Suddenly, the foyer windows explode. The ghost breaks through
text: the window. Coming down the steps, he trips and falls. The
text: ghost rises into frame, stepping on the machine.
speaker_heading: GHOST
dialog: Prepare to die!
speaker_heading: (ALTERNATE LINE:)
dialog: Now you will be mine forever!
text: Cindy stands in the circle.
text: Buddy throws the switch.
text: A digital read-out... 10... 9... 8... 7...
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Cindy, get outta there. You'll be
dialog: killed.
speaker_heading: (ALTERNATE:)
dialog: Do something, Dwight!
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
text: I can't, she's still on the platform.
dialog: If I throw the switch she'll die.
dialog: Ahh! No!!!
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I'll get her.
text: With no concern for his safety, Ray, still with Dwight
text: strapped to his back, bolts towards Cindy.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON:
text: Ray. He's running in dramatic slo-mo.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: Why is he running so slow?
text: Brenda shrugs.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Ray, run faster.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Okay.
text: Ray looks back and nods. He breaks outta slo-mo and speeds
text: towards Cindy.
text: Digital read-out... 3... 2... 1... Ray tackles Cindy, hurling
text: her out of the way just as the machine's energy field zaps
dialog: the ghost.
text: Cindy, Ray and Dwight hit the ground with a bone-jarring
dialog: impact.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Yeah, I broke my fall.
text: Dwight, all wuzzy, complains.
text: The force-field turns on and the ghost is instantly in agony.
text: He screams.
text: Cindy manages to drag herself to the ghost.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Don't fight it. Let it go. It's time
dialog: for you. Rest time. Peace. Carolyn
dialog: is waiting for you on the other side.
text: These words make the ghost relax. His evil expression changes.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Yes, go to her. You will be together
dialog: with her for eternity.
text: A brilliant, heavenly light ala the final scene in "GHOST."
text: Syrupy music begins to play.
text: The ghost smiles. He places his hand against Cindy's as a
dialog: kind of gesture of good-bye.
text: Music swells.
text: Ghost rises towards the light.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Goodbye, Hugh Kane.
speaker_heading: GHOST
dialog: Take care of yourself, Cindy.
text: Suddenly, another ghost appears. It's Alex. Ray, Dwight and
text: Cindy turn their heads from the bright light.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: There you are, my love. I've been
dialog: looking for you. Now we can be
dialog: together forever.
text: The ghost's expression changes to fear. He begins to leave...
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Don't you float away from me.
speaker_heading: GHOST
dialog: No! No!
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Don't you run from me!... I'm coming
dialog: my love!
text: In a flash, both Alex and the Ghost are sucked into the light
dialog: and disappear.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FOYER -- MOMENTS LATER
text: As the Ghost goes off to his wretched eternal fate with Alex
text: in the afterlife, the kids look around at each other. Outside
text: the window, dawn is beginning to break. Birds are chirping.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: We did it, you guys! We made it!
text: The gang -- Cindy, Brenda, Ray, Buddy, Theo and Dwight --
text: hug. Shorty wanders into the room.
speaker_heading: SHORTY
dialog: Hey, y'all! What's going on?
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Shorty! You're alive!! But... what
dialog: about your head?
speaker_heading: SHORTY
dialog: That turned out to be a good thing!
dialog: It's gonna make smuggling a whole
dialog: lot easier. Remember that weed? I'm
text: about to get paid.
text: Cindy and Shorty hug.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: (triumphant)
dialog: Come on, guys. Let's get out of here.
text: Suddenly, the door opens. A ray of blinding sunlight floods
text: the room. Father McFeely enters with some COPS and EMTS.
speaker_heading: FATHER MCFEELY
dialog: I'm afraid we're too late.
text: The kids watch, confused, as the priest and the officers
text: rush past without acknowledging they're even there. The kids
text: look bewildered.
text: Cop #1 walks up to Cop #2.
speaker_heading: COP #2
dialog: I found one in the kitchen.
text: COP #3 runs up to Cop #1 and Cop #2, very excited.
speaker_heading: COP #3
dialog: There's ass, blood and guts
dialog: everywhere!
text: Cop #1 gives them the "thumbs up" and walks away without
text: saying a word. Cop #2 and Cop #3 walk away. On the back of
text: each of their jackets reads "DIRECTOR'S RELATIVE." Then Cop
text: #1 walks away revealing the back of his jacket, "JUST AN
dialog: EXTRA."
text: Cindy runs up to Father McFeely.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Father!
speaker_heading: MCFEELY
dialog: My child, you're alive!
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Yes, we made it!
speaker_heading: MCFEELY
dialog: We? What do you mean... we?
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Me and my friends... You see there
dialog: was this ghost. He came out of nowhere
dialog: and....
speaker_heading: MCFEELY
dialog: My child you are the only survivor.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: No, my friends are right here!
text: The kids stand in a group behind Cindy, but McFeely looks
text: right through them.
speaker_heading: MCFEELY
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Father, I don't understand. Tell me
dialog: what happened?
speaker_heading: MCFEELY
dialog: Soon, but first I must bless this
dialog: house.
text: McFeely walks off.
text: Ray and Dwight, still strapped to each other, watch the entire
text: scenario. They look at the others.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You mean to tell me we're dead!
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: I guess so.
text: Ray undoes his belt and Dwight falls of his back. Dwight
text: tries to stand up, but even though he's dead, his legs don't
dialog: work.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Noooooooo!
text: Suddenly, a bus (or car) drives through, smashing Cindy.

speaker_heading: BIRD
dialog: Will you just shut up? Shut the fuck
dialog: up!
text: The PHONE RINGS.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Hello? Oh hi Dad. Yeah, I'm so happy
dialog: to be back in college. I love my new
dialog: roommate, but I have to say I was a
text: little nervous at first because she's
dialog: so religious.
text: Show Megan fucking herself with a crucifix.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Let Jesus fuck me!
text: Megan's head spins around, then she spews green vomit and

speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: And I got the cutest little parrot.
dialog: Birds are such clean animals, he's
dialog: no trouble at all!
speaker_heading: BIRD
dialog: Uh, what do they put in this birdseed?
text: The bird sprays shit out his ass all over her wall.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Sorry to bother you about this, Dad
dialog: but I need you to send me some more
dialog: money. For some reason, the college
dialog: wouldn't accept the cash you sent
dialog: for my tuition.
text: She looks at a stack of 100's that are obviously counterfeit
text: smeared ink, "One Hundred Dollars" spelled wrong, Ben Franklin
text: in dreadlocks.

dialog: cigarettes.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Keep checking your mailbox, I'm
dialog: sending you a care package. Oh, and

dialog: the box.
text: There's a knock at the door.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: There's Buddy! Gotta go! Bye Dad!
text: Cindy opens the door, and Buddy is waiting there with a bunch
text: of flowers. Cindy smiles, then punches him through the
text: flowers, in the chest.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Open chest!
text: Buddy is sprawled on the floor with the wind knocked out of
text: him, flowers everywhere.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Gotta be faster than that, thimble
dialog: dick!
text: Cindy and Buddy exit.
text: Megan keeps spewing and swearing.
speaker_heading: REGAN
dialog: Fuck me! Fuck me!
speaker_heading: BIRD
dialog: Girl, I wouldn't fuck you if I was
text: lying in the desert dying of thirst,
dialog: with buzzards all around, and your
dialog: ass was a water fountain.
