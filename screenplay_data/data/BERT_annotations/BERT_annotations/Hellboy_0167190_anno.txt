scene_heading: INT. DARKROOM - INTERVIEW 1
text: In a photographic DARKROOM: old optical enlargers, porcelain
text: trays, timers, and stills hanging out to dry.
text: GEORGE MATLIN, a slightly obese, nearsighted man in his
dialog: seventies.
speaker_heading: OLD MATLIN
dialog: Is he real? Oh yeah -- Absolutely.
text: Super: CPL. GEORGE MATLIN, combat photographer.
speaker_heading: OLD MATLIN
dialog: I haven't talked about it for years,
dialog: you know?
dialog: (looks at the camera)
dialog: Everyone called me crazy...
text: Matlin smiles as he paws through a box of old negatives.
speaker_heading: OLD MATLIN
dialog: But I have the negative.
text: Someone turns on the darkroom's red safety light for an eerie,
dialog: dramatic effect.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN'S VOICE
dialog: Get ready, 3-2-1... Roll tape.
speaker_heading: OLD MATLIN
dialog: It all started back in ´44. I was a
text: Corps photographer aboard an allied
dialog: submarine...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SUBMARINE HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: YOUNG MATLIN's hands again paw through a bunch of negatives,
text: again under a red light. Now, at 21, he's wedged in a
text: submarine corridor, a crowded maze of pipes and gauges.
text: 35mm still cameras dangle from his neck. He shrinks back as
text: a squad of MARINES hustles past him, loading weapons.
speaker_heading: OLD MATLIN'S VOICE
dialog: ...off the coast of Scotland.
dialog: Classified mission. I was 21...
text: SGT. WHITMAN, 44, tough as nails, pushes through, his uniform
text: soaked in sweat.
speaker_heading: OLD MATLIN'S VOICE
dialog: We had an English civilian on board.
dialog: Not much older than me but already
dialog: an advisor to President Roosevelt.
dialog: "Paranormal" advisor, I kid you not --
text: Whitman continues down the passageway until he reaches a
dialog: small...
scene_heading: INT. SUBMARINE STATEROOM - NIGHT
text: Within, an incongruously proper young Englishman "reading"
text: an ancient set of Tarot cards.
speaker_heading: OLD MATLIN'S VOICE
dialog: His name was Trevor. Profesor Trevor --
speaker_heading: WHITMAN
dialog: -- Broom! Topside, now.
text: TREVOR "BROOM" BRUTTENHOLM is a gaunt, olive-skinned man in
text: his late twenties. In his hands, a tarot deck. He turns the
text: cards face up: THE FOOL, THE MOON...
speaker_heading: WHITMAN
dialog: The sooner we're done, the better.
text: Broom grabs a worn-down wooden box full of books and amulets.
text: It has a leather strap that allows him to carry it, much
text: like a carpenter's tool box.
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: This is an important mission, Sgt.
dialog: Whitman. I hope you realize that.
speaker_heading: WHITMAN
dialog: Oh -- you don't wanna know what I
dialog: think. Topside, now.
text: He moves away. Broom takes a small box and a few amulets.
text: Before exiting, he pauses and tensely turns the last TAROT

scene_heading: INT/EXT. SCOTLAND - TUNNEL - NIGHT
scene_heading: Super: OCTOBER 9, 1944, SCOTLAND.
text: It's raining like hell now. Soldiers move through a short
text: tunnel carved into the mountain.
text: Whitman signals his men to spread out, then comes alongside
dialog: Broom.
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I
dialog: have a word??
speaker_heading: WHITMAN
dialog: (impatient)
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: In private, if you don't mind...
scene_heading: EXT. SCOTLAND CHAPEL REMAINS
text: They enter the remains of a small chapel. Broom produces the
text: small box. It's full of rosaries.
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: Your men -- They'll need these --
text: Whitman scowls and huffs. A life-sized wooden Christ
text: contemplates the scene from above.
speaker_heading: WHITMAN
dialog: You are a Catholic??
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: Amongst other things, yes -- but
dialog: that's hardly the point.
text: Whitman locks and loads an automatic.
speaker_heading: WHITMAN
dialog: Here. You'll need one of these.
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: I abhor violence.
dialog: (Whitman moves away)
dialog: Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't
dialog: think me mad --
speaker_heading: WHITMAN
dialog: Three days too late for that one,
dialog: "professor."
text: He moves away. Broom looks up to the wooden Christ: It has
dialog: no eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. DITCH
text: MATLIN hauls his tripod and gear and joins the troops on the
text: move. Broom catches up with Whitman.
speaker_heading: WHITMAN
dialog: You're wasting our time: There's
dialog: nothing on this island but sheep and
dialog: rocks.
speaker_heading: BROOM
text: Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of
text: Trondham Abbey. Built on an
dialog: intersection of Ley Lines, the
dialog: boundaries between our world and the
dialog: other --
speaker_heading: WHITMAN
dialog: (interrupts him)
dialog: What a load of crap. Hell, a week
dialog: ago I hadn't even heard the word
dialog: parabnormal --
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: "Paranormal"
dialog: (Whitman moves on)
dialog: But -- you read the transmission.
speaker_heading: WHITMAN
dialog: Half transmission. Nonsense -- German
dialog: ghost stories!
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
speaker_heading: WHITMAN
dialog: Oh, I'll bet you have.
text: Reaching a slope, Matlin sets down his camera. Turning, he
text: sees lights.
speaker_heading: MATLIN
dialog: Sweet Jesus.
text: Drenched, Broom and Whitman look down upon an impressive
text: ROMANESQUE RUIN. Under worklights, dozens of NAZI SOLDIERS
text: swarm among thick stone walls and archways.
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: They must be here for the sheep.
speaker_heading: OMIT
scene_heading: EXT. AMONG THE RUINS - NIGHT
text: A dozen German soldiers swiftly assemble a large steel
text: MACHINE. The work is monitored by a spindly Nazi in BLACK
text: LEATHER, his face covered by an odd gas mask: KROENEN.
speaker_heading: WHITMAN
dialog: The freak in the gas mask --
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, one of the
dialog: Reich's top Scientists. Head of the
dialog: Thule Occult Society.
scene_heading: EXT. NEARBY - BROOM - NIGHT
text: He lowers a pair of binoculars and passes them to Whitman.
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: If he's here, this is worse than I
dialog: thought.
speaker_heading: WHITMAN
dialog: (to the radio man)
dialog: Air and sea backup. What's closest?
text: The RADIOMAN cranks a transmitter to life.
speaker_heading: RADIO MAN
dialog: Londonderry, sir. Forty minutes away.
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: We don't have forty minutes.
scene_heading: EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT
text: Kroenen throws a switch: On the machine, dozens of gears
dialog: respond!
text: Steam pistons thrust copper rails upright, lifting two mighty
text: metal rings, not unlike a gyroscope. Kroenen grunts and
text: signals for more floodlights to be turned on.
scene_heading: EXT. BEHIND THE ALTAR - NIGHT
text: The lights flood an ancient sacristy lined with eroded stone
text: saints. GRIGORY, tall and gaunt, stands naked, arms fully
dialog: extended.
speaker_heading: GRIGORY
dialog: No matter what happens to me, you
dialog: must carry on with the work.
text: ILSA, a severe, ageless Aryan beauty, reverentially drapes
text: an embroidered robe over his bony shoulders.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: I will not leave you.
speaker_heading: GRIGORY
dialog: Yes, you will... Leave me. Deny me.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Never --
text: He hands her a small LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. It contains hand-
text: drawn notes and illustrations.
speaker_heading: GRIGORY
dialog: This will guide you back to me.
text: He pulls her close, the clouds of their breath mingling.
speaker_heading: GRIGORY
dialog: I grant you everlasting life, youth
dialog: and the power to serve me.
text: He dips his fingers in a wooden bowl full of blood, then
text: wipes her tears away with a crimson thumb, both a consolation
dialog: and a ritual.
text: VON KRUPT, an acrid German General, wearing dark SCARLET
text: glasses and LEATHER GLOVES, appears. Looks at his pocket
text: watch. On the gold lid: a SWASTIKA.
speaker_heading: VON KRUPT
dialog: It's time.
speaker_heading: OMIT
scene_heading: EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - CEREMONY - NIGHT
text: Grigory walks towards the machine, its colossal steel and
text: copper clockworks gleaming in the floodlights.
speaker_heading: VON KRUPT
dialog: Five years of research and
dialog: construction, Grigory. Five years!!
text: He strides alongside Grigory and Ilsa, who holds an umbrella
text: to shield her master from the pouring rain.
speaker_heading: VON KRUPT
text: The furhrer doesn't look kindly on
dialog: failure.
speaker_heading: GRIGORY
dialog: There will be no failure, General. I
dialog: promised Herr Hitler a miracle. I'll
dialog: deliver one.
text: Kroenen mutters excitedly as he opens a polished oak box
text: containing a massive gold and copper MECHA-GLOVE.
text: Grigory extends his hand so that KROENEN may fit him with
text: the contraption, which is attached to cables and hoses.
scene_heading: EXT. THE HILLTOP - ALLIED SOLDIERS - NIGHT
text: The Americans fan out, unseen.
text: Broom and Whitman dive into a ditch barely in time to avoid
text: a German foot patrol.
text: Other GI's take up positions below a machine gun nest.
scene_heading: EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT
text: Grigory walks to the top of the altar, cables trailing behind
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: GRIGORI
dialog: Tonight, We will open a portal and
text: awaken the OGDRU JAHAD: The seven
dialog: Gods of chaos.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Our enemies will be destroyed. In an
dialog: instant, all impurity in this world
dialog: will be razed and from the ashes a
dialog: new eden will arise.
text: He looks down at the machine and whispers --
speaker_heading: GRIGORY
dialog: Ragnarok, Anung Ia Anung.
text: He flexes his fingers and in response --
text: -- the two metal rings swing around the machine's central
text: axis. TCHINK!!! WHIRRR!!! STEAM escapes from the ducts and
text: pipes. An invisible blast of energy forces the falling rain
text: to swerve momentarily away from Grigory's body.
text: Ilsa signals TWO NAZI SCIENTISTS standing at a control panel.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: More Power!! Don't let the level
dialog: drop!!
text: One of them inserts a 20 inch SOLID GOLD CYLINDER into the
text: machine. Two openings remain vacant next to it.
text: A blade of light opens in the air!
text: Burning symbols slash the air, like living serpents of fire.
scene_heading: EXT. COSMIC SLIT - NIGHT
text: The edges of the cosmic slit sizzle with color; an ALIEN
text: GALAXY sparkles on the other side. Suddenly, a work light
text: tears loose and flies in.
scene_heading: EXT. COSMIC SLIT - FROM THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT
text: The six-foot work light tumbles by the massive OGDRU JAHAD:
text: seven egg-like monoliths of unholy origin.
text: Within their translucent walls, horrible creatures lie
text: slumbering. As the light sweeps by, one of the giants opens
text: a filmy eye, and then another, and another, and another...
text: Fleshy tentacles move lazily within their crystalline prison.
scene_heading: EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT
text: Grigory screams as his body rises. Veins swell in his neck,
text: his face distorted by ecstasy and pain.
text: CLICK. Someone shoots a photograph.
scene_heading: EXT. RUINS - IN THE UNDERBRUSH - NIGHT
text: It's Matlin, snapping for all he's worth. Whitman pulls him
text: down and pulls out a large bayonet blade.
speaker_heading: WHITMAN
dialog: Listen to me, you moron: you do that
dialog: again, I'll carve you a new --
text: Too late. One of the NAZI SCIENTIST has heard them.
scene_heading: EXT. RUINS, IN THE UNDERBRUSH - NIGHT
text: The Nazi SCIENTIST approaches. Pauses next to the box with
text: the GOLD CYLINDERS.
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: (fierce whisper, to
speaker_heading: WHITMAN)
dialog: Listen to me!!! The portal is open!!!
dialog: We have to stop them!!!
scene_heading: EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT
text: Grigory dangles like a marionette in a new surge of energy.
text: Even the skeptical Von Krupt is in thrall.
text: The NAZI SCIENTIST reaches for a second GOLD CYLINDER. But
text: something else lands next to him: A GRENADE!!!
text: The explosion blows him to pieces. In a few seconds, the
text: squad of Allies storms the area.
text: A hail of bullets cuts down a dozen Nazis. The Allies overrun
text: the machine gun nest as grenades explode everywhere.
text: VON KRUPT shoots wildly, hitting Broom in the leg. But
text: Whitman's bullets rip into the old Nazi's chest.
text: Leaving a trail of blood, Broom crawls to a dead G.I. and
text: grabs a grenade from his belt.
text: TCHKKK!!! Kroenen extends two gleaming blades from twin steel
text: bands on his wrists and takes on an entire group of soldiers,
text: mowing through them with swords spinning like deadly rotors.
text: The steel chops clean through their weapons.
text: Broom pulls the pin and throws the grenade at the generator.
text: CLICK-CLACK!! It wedges itself between two moving tie rods.
text: Kroenen squeals and -- retracting his blades -- lunges after
text: it. The gyrating rails slice through his leather jacket. As
text: his fingers reach the grenade, it EXPLODES!!!
text: Kroenen flies through the air, hitting a stone wall, where
text: two long pieces of shrapnel pin him like an insect.
text: Another rail plunges -- FFFFT!!, like a javelin -- into the
text: earth right next to MATLIN.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Grigory!
scene_heading: EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT
text: Grigory's face is distorted, pulled like ectoplasmic taffy,
text: his body contorting and breaking. The cosmic portal suddenly
text: implodes! Nothing is left but a few burnt rails and the metal
text: glove, empty and smoking.
text: As the Allies approach, the fighting rages on.
text: Grigory and Ilsa are gone. And for now, so is Kroenen.
text: Embedded in the wall where he was pinned, two bloody rails,
dialog: nothing more.
speaker_heading: OMIT
scene_heading: EXT. INSIDE THE CHURCH - NIGHT
text: Allied SOLDIERS penetrate the ruins. Matlin helps Broom up.
speaker_heading: MATLIN
dialog: It's almost over!!
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: No. It's not.
text: He picks up a sample of white, viscous goo from the outer
text: rings of the smoking machine. Whitman approaches.
speaker_heading: BROOM
text: Cordon off the area. Something came
dialog: through.
speaker_heading: WHITMAN
dialog: From where??!!
text: Broom glances at a 13th century FRESCO depicting heaven and
dialog: hell.
scene_heading: EXT. INSIDE CHURCH RUINS - NIGHT
text: Still raining. A group of soldiers spreads out, using
text: flashlights to scour through the rubble. Every one of them
text: has a rosary hanging from the bayonet.
speaker_heading: OMIT
scene_heading: EXT. INSIDE CHAPEL RUINS - NIGHT
text: Broom hastily bandages his bleeding leg. Matlin and Whitman
text: roam over the debris. Rain POURS through the broken roof.
speaker_heading: MATLIN
dialog: Do you believe in hell?
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: There is a place -- a dark place
text: where evil slumbers and awaits to
dialog: return. From there it infects our
dialog: dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave
dialog: us a glance tonight --
speaker_heading: MATLIN
dialog: Grigory -- That's Russian, right?
dialog: (Broom nods)
dialog: Thought they were on our side...
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
speaker_heading: MATLIN
dialog: C'mon -- Rasputin??
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: In 1916, at a dinner in his honor,
dialog: he was poisoned, shot, stabbed,
text: clubbed, drowned and castrated.
speaker_heading: MATLIN
dialog: That makes him more than a hundred --
text: A rustling sound reaches their ears. Matlin readies a handgun
text: as Broom scans the walls with his flashlight. Something moves,
text: accompanied by a loud scrape.
text: Matlin cocks his pistol and nervously approaches a crumbling
text: statue. SCREEEECH!!!! A RED THING jumps into the air!!
text: Instinctively, Matlin shoots at it.
text: The RED THING leaps from arch to arch, followed by a trail
text: of bullet hits. Whitman and other soldiers join them --
speaker_heading: MATLIN
dialog: (to Broom)
dialog: What the hell was that? An ape?
speaker_heading: BROOM
text: No. It was red. Bright red.
speaker_heading: WHITMAN
dialog: What are you two talking about??
speaker_heading: MATLIN
text: A red ape.
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: It's-not-an-ape --
text: They hear the labored breathing of a living creature.
speaker_heading: MATLIN
dialog: It's got a big stone -- in its hand --
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: I think that is its hand.
text: Hissing, the thing cowers between a gargoyle and a stone
dialog: saint.
text: WHITMAN points his gun at the scarlet shape above. Broom
text: stops him from firing.
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: Wait --
text: In deep shadow, the RED THING observes with bright, golden
text: eyes veined with streaks of burnt sienna.
text: Broom slowly fishes a BABY RUTH candy bar from his pocket.
text: Peeling back the wrapper, he slowly waves the candy. The RED
text: THING shrinks back.
text: Broom bites into the candy and chews, noisily smacking his
text: lips. Offers the candy again. This time, out of the dark
text: comes a small FACE, not very different from the stone demons
dialog: around it.
text: The creature extends its right arm: it's solid stone with
text: tiny runes engraved around the thick, cylindrical wrist.
text: Four articulated stone fingers wiggle, reaching for the
dialog: chocolate.
speaker_heading: YOUNG SOLDIER
dialog: Jesus! would'ya look at the size of
dialog: that whammer!
text: Whitman moves closer. On the wall behind him, a shadow shows
text: the RED THING climbing into Broom's arms.
text: Broom tenderly covers it with a blanket. The stubby fingers
text: snatch the candy. Broom smiles.
speaker_heading: BROOM
text: It's a boy. Just a baby boy.
scene_heading: EXT. CHAPEL RUINS - NIGHT
text: The soldiers cluster around, curious to see it. Matlin
text: prepares his camera and directs them into a group shot. Broom
text: smiles like a proud new father and embraces the creature,
text: patting him gently. CLICK!!!
speaker_heading: OLD MATLIN'S VOICE
dialog: Best photo of my career --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DARKROOM - BACK TO INTERVIEW 1
speaker_heading: OLD MATLIN
dialog: and no one has ever seen it. They
dialog: keep saying he's not real, but I
dialog: want to set the record straight before
dialog: I go.
text: Matlin finally pulls an old 8x10 from a battered portfolio.
text: He smiles, full of memories.
speaker_heading: OLD MATLIN
dialog: Here. The real picture, not the
text: retouched one in LIFE magazine.
dialog: (hands over the
dialog: photograph)
dialog: This is him. The very same night we

dialog: Can I say it on TV? He called him --
scene_heading: EXT. INSIDE THE CHURCH - BACK TO '44 - NIGHT
speaker_heading: BROOM

text: FIGURE 1 spots a glowing firefly. They follow it into --
scene_heading: INT. ICE CAVE - MAIN NAVE - DAY
text: A cathedral-like vault that could easily hold a stadium.
text: From an opening somewhere above, eerie blue light streams
text: down on a magnificent labyrinth.
text: A few more fireflies speckle the air, winking on and off.
scene_heading: INT. ICE CAVE - LABYRINTH - DAY
text: The THREE FIGURES move past cyclopean statues guarding the
text: inhuman architecture. The humans are dwarfed by the monumental

scene_heading: INT. ICE CAVE - CENTRAL LABYRINTH AREA - DAY
text: At the center of the labyrinth the stone floor is covered in
text: grooves radiating from a shallow stone basin.
text: FIGURE 3 uncovers his face: he's a PEASANT GUIDE.
speaker_heading: PEASANT GUIDE
dialog: (in Romanian)
dialog: We shouldn't be here --
text: FIGURE 1 exchanges a meaningful look with FIGURE 2. FIGURE 1
text: throws two solid gold pieces at the feet of the Sherpa. On
text: them, an embossed SWASTIKA. After a greedy moment of thought,
text: the Peasant kneels to pick up the gold.
text: TCHKK!!! A long, shiny blade pierces the Peasant's chest
text: from behind. He blinks twice and slumps forward.
text: FIGURE 2 steps out from behind him, a long, bloody blade in
text: his hand.
text: The figures uncover their faces. ILSA has not aged and
text: KROENEN, still wears the same tight gas mask. He cleans his
text: blade in the snow and takes back the gold.
text: Ilsa watches the Sherpa's blood as it runs in a steaming
text: rivulet, tracing a glyph in the grooves and filling the basin.

dialog: door.
text: Broom pauses to buy a dozen BABY RUTH candy bars from a street
dialog: vendor.

text: is scanned. TWO VIOLET FLASHES. His ID and badge numbers
text: appear. CLACK! The gate opens.
scene_heading: EXT. UPHILL ROAD - THE MOPED - DAY
text: The moped putt-putts towards the building in the distance.
scene_heading: INT. B.P.R.D. LOBBY - DAY
text: Seated at a dramatic circular desk is a solitary guard. Myers
text: approaches.
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: Hello, I'm --
speaker_heading: LOBBY GUARD
text: -- Late. Five minutes late.
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: Yes, I --
speaker_heading: LOBBY GUARD
dialog: -- Section fifty-one. Step back.
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: Pardon?
speaker_heading: LOBBY GUARD
dialog: Two steps back, please.
text: Confused, Myers picks up his suitcases and complies. He
text: realizes he's DEAD CENTER on a giant B.P.R.D. Logo: A HAND
scene_heading: HOLDING A SWORD.
speaker_heading: LOBBY GUARD
dialog: Watch your hands and elbows.
text: Immediately, the floor under Myers' feet starts down. He's
text: on a small elevator.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. OPEN ELEVATOR - ON THE WAY DOWN - DAY
text: The panel overhead slides shut. A row of safety lights comes
dialog: on.
scene_heading: INT. OPEN ELEVATOR - DAY
text: He's in a vast underground area with other elevators moving
text: up and down in the distance.
scene_heading: INT. B.P.R.D. - CONCRETE CHAMBER 51 - DUSK
text: The elevator stops in a narrow, dark space. Neon lights
text: flicker on, illuminating a circular chamber. PAINTED on the
text: floor is a huge number: 51.
text: Right in front of Myers: a magnificent oak door.
text: Myers knocks on it. No answer. Myers enters.
scene_heading: INT. BROOM´S OFFICE (FULL AQUARIUM)- DUSK
text: Myers looks around, fascinated: books. An office made of
text: them. The soft glow of green-shaded reading lamps bathes
text: everything in an intimate, warm light.
text: One entire wall is a thick pane of glass, the wall of a huge
text: tank of water. A VOICE crackles through an intercom next to
dialog: the tank.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Turn the pages, please.
text: Myers jumps, then moves closer to the glass.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Over here... if you don't mind?
text: In the tank, ABE SAPIEN, a FISH-MAN glides in and out view.
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: Jesus Christ!
text: Myers looks at four BOOK STANDS facing the glass. Each
text: supports an open volume. He leans close to the glass, peering
dialog: intently.
text: Abe reappears. He is slender, dolphin gray, with dark patterns
text: streaking his soft skin. Bright blue eyes shine with
text: intelligence. Behind a thin wound-like mouth, gills are
text: bubbling.
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: (points at the books)
dialog: These -- ? You're reading these -- ?
text: Abe nods. Through a side door, Broom enters.
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: Four books at once. Every day -- as
dialog: long as I'm here to turn the pages.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: My name's Broom. Professor Trevor
dialog: Broom.
text: Myers extends his hand in greeting --
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: Sir, I'm --
text: BAM! Abe presses his webbed hand against the glass, closes
text: his eyes -- all three lids.
text: Abe's voice surges from the speaker.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Agent John T. Myers, Kansas City,
dialog: 76. "T" stands for Thaddeus, mother's
dialog: older brother. Scar on your chin
dialog: happened when you were ten, you still
dialog: wonder if it's ever going to fade
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: How did it --
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: -- He. Not "it."
speaker_heading: BROOM
text: Abraham Sapien. Discovered alive in
text: a secret chamber at St. Trinian's
dialog: Foundling Hospital, Washington.
text: Points at a small piece of antique paper, framed on the wall.
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: They took his name from this little
dialog: inscription that was stuck on his
dialog: tank.
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: (reads)
dialog: Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: The day Abraham Lincoln died. Hence
dialog: "Abe" Sapien.
text: Broom uncovers a tray by the tank: Four greenish eggs. Myers
text: gags and reels back.
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: Rotten eggs, a delicacy. Abe loves
dialog: them.
text: Abe smiles and takes a subaquatic bow, gracefully nabbing
text: the eggs as they float through the hatch.
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: How does he know so much about me?
speaker_heading: BROOM
text: Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: "Unique." That's a word you'll hear
dialog: quite a bit around here.
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: As you entered the lobby there was
dialog: an inscription --
speaker_heading: MYERS
text: On the desk, yes. In Latin.
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: Impressive. Do you remember what it
dialog: said?
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: "In absentia luci, tenebrae
dialog: vinciunt..."
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: "In the absence of light, darkness
dialog: prevails." For there are things that
text: go bump in the night, Agent Myers.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: We are the ones who bump back.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. B.P.R.D. - FREAK CORRIDOR "A" - NIGHT

speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: 1937: Hitler joins "The Thule Society" --
text: a group of German aristocrats obsessed
dialog: with the occult.
text: He points to an ANCIENT, BROKEN LANCE.
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: 1938: he acquires the Spear of

speaker_heading: BROOM
text: Hitler's power increases tenfold.
text: They go through a series of pneumatic doors.
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: In 1943, President Roosevelt decides
text: to fight back. THE BUREAU FOR
scene_heading: PARANORMAL RESEARCH AND DEFENSE is

text: Myers stares.
speaker_heading: BROOM
text: 1958, the occult war finally ends
dialog: when Adolf Hitler dies.
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: 1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: (enigmatic smile)
dialog: Did he, now?
text: They reach a FINAL DOOR. Stainless steel, like a BANK VAULT.
text: Waiting there is AGENT CLAY, a burly guy in a suit, with a
text: cartful of BEEF AND MASHED POTATOES. A dinner pile at least
text: 4 feet high.
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: Agent Myers, this is Agent Clay.
dialog: Follow his lead.
text: Broom hands Myers two BABY RUTH bars and walks away.
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: You're not coming?
dialog: Broom signals "no."
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: I hand-picked you from a roster of
dialog: over seventy academy graduates. Make
dialog: me proud.
text: The door closes behind him.
speaker_heading: CLAY
text: They're not speaking. Professor Broom
dialog: had him grounded.
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: Grounded? Who's grounded?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Okay. You saw the fish man, right?
text: Myers nods.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Well, come on in and meet the rest
dialog: of the family.
text: Clay uses an odd-shaped ELECTRONIC KEY to unlock the door.
text: Three solenoid locks turn. Two steel vertical PISTONS open
dialog: up.
scene_heading: INT. HELLBOY'S DEN - NIGHT
text: Clay pushes the cart into a solid concrete bunker, windowless,
text: austere except for a few SAMURAI suits of ARMOR and WEAPONS.
text: Dozens of CATS wander around; others are curled up on the
dialog: furniture.
text: There are Zippo's everywhere, from every era.
text: On a sofa (made from the bed of a pickup truck) is a heap of
text: blankets and comic books. All in all, a MEGA BACHELOR PAD.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: (sotto voce)
dialog: He gets fed six times a day. He's
dialog: got a thing for cats. You'll be his
text: nanny, his keeper, his best friend.
dialog: He never goes out unsupervised --
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: Who?!
text: Clay points at a torn comic book: HELLBOY, THE UNCANNY. Myers
text: picks it up, looks at the cover: it shows Hellboy -- in a
text: U.S. Uniform, fighting a monstrous ape.
text: Myers watches, amazed, as a bright red TAIL waves in and out
text: of a pool of light about ten feet away. One of the cats
text: playfully paws at it.
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: (sotto voce)
dialog: You're kidding --
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Those comics -- They never got the
dialog: eyes right.

speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: (to Clay, sotto voce)
dialog: Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real --
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: (sotto voce)
dialog: Yup. Sixty years old by our count.
dialog: But he doesn't age like we do --
dialog: think dog years: He's barely out of
dialog: his teens.
text: Myers gasps, seeing a monumental figure in the shadows,
text: exercising with a 300 lb. Stainless steel DUMBBELL. Crimson
text: biceps like cooked hams. Chomping an unlit CIGAR stub.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: What's with the hair, Clay?? Finally
dialog: got those implants??
text: Agent Clay blushes as he hides his scalp.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: It'll fill in. Where do you want
dialog: your dinner, Red? By the couch?
text: On a nearby pile of junked TV sets, a loop of Fleischer
text: cartoons and home movies cycles endlessly. One subject appears
text: over and over: an ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN with a pale face
text: and raven-black hair.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Who's the squirt?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Agent Myers is your new liaison.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Got tired of me?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back

text: BANG!!! Hellboy lets the dumbbell drop. Instinctively, Myers
dialog: jumps.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: I don't want him.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Manning says I'm too soft on you --
dialog: (sotto voce, nudging
dialog: Myers)
dialog: The candy. Give him the candy.
text: Myers remembers he's holding the Baby Ruths.
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these.
dialog: For you.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: Father's back?
dialog: (Clay nods)
dialog: Still angry?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Well, you did break out --
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: I wanted to see her.
dialog: (grunts)
dialog: It's nobody's business.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: It is. You got yourself on TV again.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: "Myers", huh? You have a first name??
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: (sotto to Myers)
dialog: Try not to stare. He hates when people
dialog: stare.
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: Uh-oh -- John.
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Staring at what?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: His horns. He files 'em. To "fit
dialog: in."
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: His what??!!
text: Hellboy finally enters the light. He's awe-inspiring, with
text: chiseled features, patterned red skin and deep-set golden
text: eyes. Involuntarily, Myers recoils.
text: In spite of himself, Myers is staring at the horn stumps.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Whatcha looking at, John??
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: Oh-n-no -- I --
text: An ALARM sounds, and a red light blinks on the wall. Myers
text: looks around, bewildered.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY

dialog: Hey, hey, hey. They're playing our
dialog: song.
speaker_heading: CLAY

scene_heading: INT./EXT. GARBAGE TRUCK - LIBRARY STREET ENTRANCE - NIGHT
text: AN AGENT is driving the truck, with MYERS at his side.
scene_heading: EXT. MACHEN LIBRARY - STREET ENTRANCE - NIGHT
text: The crowd parts like the Red Sea for the garbage truck. Dozens
text: of faces are reflected in the truck's mirrored logo. A MOUNTED
text: POLICEMAN rides past the mirrored sides of the truck.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. GARBAGE TRUCK LAB - LIBRARY CROWD - NIGHT
text: The MOUNTED POLICEMAN is visible as he rides by. The mirrors
text: are see-through. The back of the truck is a fully-equipped
text: crime lab, crammed with hi-tech gear and low-tech talismans.
text: ABE fits a respirator over his face. It looks like a

text: Hellboy looks out onto the CROWD.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One

dialog: (nostalgic)
dialog: Outside. I could be outside --
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: You mean, outside... with her.
text: Hellboy straps on a huge utility belt heavy with amulets,
text: rosaries, horseshoes. From an ashtray he grabs a handful of

speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Don't get psychic with me.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Nothing psychic about it. You're
dialog: easy.
text: Hellboy unlocks a STEEL BOX (STENCILED ON ITS LID: "THE GOOD
text: SAMARITAN") and extracts the meanest-looking, custom-built,
text: double-barrel, blue-finished, handgun ever made. A veritable
dialog: cannon.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY

speaker_heading: ABE

speaker_heading: CLAY

text: HELLBOY and ABE.
speaker_heading: CLAY

scene_heading: INT. MACHEN LIBRARY, MAIN LOBBY - NIGHT

dialog: At nineteen hundred hours an alarm

speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: Apparently not everything was fake.
text: Broom stands at the base of the marble staircase.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: (surprised to see him)
dialog: Father...?
text: Myers observes as the red Goliath sheepishly averts his gaze
text: from that of the fragile old man.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN CORRIDOR / MACHEN LIBRARY (SET) - NIGHT
text: They approach an oversize set of brass doors.
text: Abe removes a leather glove from his hand. FWAP!! he spreads
text: his webbed fingers on the door. He closes his three eyelids
dialog: and concentrates.
text: Two agents arrive with a rolling munitions case. Myers
text: observes as Hellboy opens it and looks over a potpourri of
text: bullets of all colors and shapes.
speaker_heading: BROOM
text: A 16th century statue was destroyed.
dialog: Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Who wards off demons.
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: Smuggled into this country by an

dialog: however, was hollow --
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Reliquary --
speaker_heading: BROOM
dialog: A prison. The Vatican deemed its

speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Oh, well. Lemme go in and say "hi".
text: As HELLBOY opens the big doors, a flickering amber glow
text: illuminates him. He steps inside.
scene_heading: INT. "MAGIK EXHIBITION" HALL - NIGHT
text: BLUE emergency lamps are on. The exhibits are destroyed;
text: piles of debris are burning. Hellboy walks past a fallen
text: display case.
text: He moves around cautiously. A couple of large carvings and
text: statues startle him.
text: On the floor: boots, half chewed. Bitten belts and shreds of
text: uniforms and hats.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: (whispers into radio)
dialog: Blue: It stinks in here -- Finely
text: aged roadkill.
text: The sickening sound of snapping bones and mastication reaches
text: his ears. Hellboy reacts to a smell, raises his eyes to
dialog: discover --
text: A huge pale CREATURE hangs from the ceiling, chewing slowly.
text: SAMMAEL: equipped with powerful arms, a head full of tentacles
text: and two well-muscled hind legs. Most of its face is hidden,
text: but the jaws are shiny with blood.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Whatcha havin'? Six library guards,

scene_heading: INT. MAIN CORRIDOR / MACHEN LIBRARY (SET) - NIGHT
text: Abe has found a small, medieval engraving of Sammael in one

speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: There's not much here: the entity's
dialog: name is Sammael, the desolate one,
dialog: son of Nergal --
scene_heading: INT. "MAGIK EXHIBITION" HALL - NIGHT
text: Sammael releases himself, lands on the floor. Part of the
text: neck is exposed: white, slimy skin, cracked like old marble
text: and criss- crossed with blue veins.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Hold it --
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Hey, Sammy, whaddayasay we work this

dialog: this out?
text: Sammael stands and turns around -- CRACK-KKK!!! His waist
dialog: twists him 360 degrees!!
text: Screeching, Sammael leaps away!!!
text: Hellboy shoots. The high-caliber ammo rips a few columns
text: apart and finally catches Sammael. The bullet goes through
text: it and destroys a statue and a large window behind him. The
text: monster squeals and goes down. With a rattling cough, it
text: grows still.
speaker_heading: OMIT

dialog: That's all for you, Sammy.
speaker_heading: ABE'S VOICE

text: arm!! Hellboy CRASHES into the brass doors!
scene_heading: INT. MACHEN LIBRARY - EXHIBIT CORRIDORS - NIGHT
text: The doors bulge and crack under Hellboy's impact.
text: Abe and Broom backpedal fast. Myers pulls out his gun, and
text: starts looking for another way in. Broom observes this,
dialog: pleased.
scene_heading: INT. MACHEN LIBRARY - MAGIK EXHIBIT HALL - NIGHT
text: Sammael lashes out with a massive punch.
text: HELLBOY goes K-KKRASH!!! K-KKRASH!!! through SIX glass
text: cabinets, then hits a window, falling --
scene_heading: EXT. AN ALLEY - BEHIND MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT
text: -- two stories down, landing sideways in an industrial garbage
text: bin. Hellboy fights to stay conscious. Blood drips from his
dialog: mouth
speaker_heading: GRIGORY'S VOICE
dialog: Child...
text: Hellboy looks up: standing in the alley, like an apparition,
text: is Grigory, in a black suit and overcoat, his eyes shielded
text: by pitch-black sunglasses
speaker_heading: GRIGORY
dialog: All grown up, I see.
text: Hellboy's in shock, confused.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: That voice --
speaker_heading: GRIGORY
dialog: I sang the first lullaby you ever
dialog: heard, my child. I ushered you into
dialog: this world.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I alone know your true calling, your
dialog: true name.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Don't tell me, it's Zeppo.
text: Hellboy catches sight of his big gun, lying on the ground.
text: He goes for it but, BAMMM!!!! SAMMAEL lands before him.
speaker_heading: GRIGORY
dialog: I can see that you're still young
dialog: and don't know your place.
dialog: (turns to Sammael)
dialog: Teach him.
text: Before Hellboy can reach the weapon --
text: WSHHHP!!! A 7-foot tongue lashes out from Sammael's mouth
text: like a whip. It's arm-thick, with yellow sacs billowing from
text: its sides. It wraps around Hellboy's right arm.
text: Hellboy falls to the ground, writhing, grinding his teeth.
text: The tongue squeezes and pulls. Smoke pours from Hellboy's
dialog: skin.
scene_heading: EXT. AN ALLEY - BEHIND MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT
text: Then -- BANG! BANG! BANG! Myers appears at the end of the
text: alley, firing round after round into Sammael's tongue. AMBER
text: BLOOD explodes in the air. The tongue recoils with an infernal
dialog: SQUEAL!!
text: Hellboy manages to roll away.
text: Myers goes for HELLBOY's gun... and grabs it! He takes cover
text: behind the trash container. HELLBOY is there.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: What do you think you're doing??
text: Myers proudly shows him the gun.
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: Helping you -- I just --
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: No one ever helps me. It's my job.
text: He grabs his gun and tries to reload, but his arm hurts too
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Damn -- Okay. Here --
text: He hands him the gun and a fresh clip. Reaching into his
text: belt, Hellboy extracts a vacuum-sealed packet.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: (throws it at Myers)
dialog: -- Then load this.
text: In the packet: A SINGLE BULLET.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: It's a tracking bullet. Crack the
dialog: pin. Load it.
text: KLANG!!! The tongue punches through the steel like a ramrod.
text: Again and again... Hellboy and Myers can barely dodge it.
text: Myers cracks a safety pin. The glass head on the bullet glows
text: like a chemical flare.
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: Jeez... What the hell is that?
text: He's looking at Hellboy's smoking arm. Inside a bloody gash,
text: a big, black stinger is gleaming.
text: Hellboy pulls it out, then steps on it. It pops like a ripe
dialog: grape.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Lemme go ask --
text: Hellboy steps from behind the container. Sammael's tongue
text: instantly wraps around the gun's muzzle.
text: BAM! BAM! Hellboy shoots repeatedly. His face lit weirdly
text: green as the tracking bullet lodges within the gun. Then --
dialog: BAM!!!!
scene_heading: INSIDE GUN SHOT
text: The glowing bullet flies through the barrel and out towards --
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY
text: -- Sammael, still in mid-air.
text: It hits him square in the chest: an explosion of green goo!!
text: With a shriek, the thing leaps over a wall. Hellboy scrambles
dialog: after it.
scene_heading: EXT. LOADING ALLEY - NIGHT
text: On the empty sidewalk, Hellboy sees a trail of GLOWING GOOP.
text: He hits full stride, following it around a corner. Myers
text: lands a second later, cradling his arm, chasing after him.
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: Wait! No, what are you doing?
scene_heading: LOADING DOCK / ALLEY
text: Sammael dashes by, followed closely by Hellboy, running full
dialog: tilt.
text: A ten-wheeler backs up, effectively blocking their way. A
text: few workers load pumpkin boxes in it.
speaker_heading: WORKER 1

dialog: Whoa-whoa-whoa-

text: Myers is a few steps behind.
speaker_heading: MYERS

dialog: Yeah, yeah, crazy costume, uh? Trick
dialog: or treat!!
scene_heading: EXT. WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT
text: Sammael runs past a group of trick-or-treaters, and jumps
text: straight into the street. Cars swerve, avoiding a collision
text: as Sammael lands on the opposite sidewalk. The TRICK OR
text: TREATERS scream.
text: Hellboy appears. He too dives straight into the traffic as
dialog: Myers follows --
text: He runs into the road... and a 4X4 speeds straight at him!
text: Seeing this, Hellboy runs back, and lands next to Myers,
text: holds out his STONE HAND and stops the 4x4 dead in its tracks.
text: The impact somersaults the car over them both. It lands with
text: a thud on the street, air bags exploding. Myers almost faints.
text: Other cars stop, tires squealing and horns blaring. A major
text: traffic jam.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY

scene_heading: INT. STUNT TRACKS - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. UNDERCARRIAGE - STUNT TRACKS - FRONT 1/4 CAR - NIGHT
text: Inches from the wheels, he punches his stone hand through

text: it against Hellboy's head.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Hey! Hey! I'm on your side!!
dialog: BAMMM!!! He goes under!!!
scene_heading: INT. STUNT TRACKS FRONT 1/4 CAR
text: The train whizzes overhead, grazing his horn stumps, making
text: sparks fly!! After the train passes, Hellboy sits up, forehead
text: smoking. Sammael is gone. A trail of GOOP is glowing. He
text: follows it, until it ends abruptly.
text: He looks ahead: no trace of Sammael... Then a fat drop of
text: glowing goop hits his hand.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Aw, I forgot --
text: He looks up. Sammael hangs from the ceiling, then drops.
text: Then the creature lifts Hellboy in a ferocious bear hug.
text: Hellboy twists around and cracks open the jaws of the
text: creature, like King Kong and the T-Rex.
text: Sammael staggers back and -- in an impossible maneuver, re-
text: knits his jaws together! Then he uses his bone scythe to
text: tackle Hellboy and -- TCHAKKKK!! -- pin his shoulder down. A
text: deep wound.
text: Sammael's mouth starts to open! Hellboy looks at the sparking
text: THIRD RAIL a few feet away.
text: Sammael's tongue rears back, a snake ready to strike.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Screw you.
text: Hellboy grabs the rail. An electrical discharge consumes
text: both creatures and burns the frame like flashpaper. Hellboy
text: lets go, his hand and body smoking. Sammael -- very crispy --
text: is convulsing in a cloud of smoke. He grows still.
text: Wreathed in smoke, Hellboy shakes off the shock and uses a

text: But after the guard moves on, a spidery form emerges from
text: the pool of shadows on the floor.
text: It's KROENEN, encased in shiny BLACK LATEX from head to toe.
text: On his chest, a close-fitting harness comprised of softly

text: He approaches a glass case which holds an ancient WOODEN

text: Then, on the glass, a reflection: ILSA.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Move.
text: She uses her hammer to destroy the glass case.

text: No apparent damage until: CRACKKKKK!!! a diagonal line appears
text: and the top half falls.
text: KROENEN reaches for a small crank embedded in his chest and

speaker_heading: GUARD 1
dialog: You! Don't move! Hands up!
text: Kroenen starts shaking, as if in a seizure and readies two
speaker_heading: TWIN BLADES.

text: They fall silently to the floor.
text: Kroenen dispatches two more in a flurry of knives.
text: The last guard raises his gun.
speaker_heading: GUARD 6
dialog: Don't --
text: Something is clearly stopping him. His hand breaks, twisted
dialog: by an unseen force!!
text: The flesh on his neck pushes upwards, held by an invisible
text: force. He starts floating in mid-air.
text: The blinking lights of arriving police cars tint the windows
text: red and amber. They outline a figure formerly submerged in
text: shadows. GRIGORY. He gestures with both hands, as if holding
text: an imaginary doll.
text: His arm muscles twitch under his skin, shifting, changing,
dialog: gaining strength.
text: With a quick gesture Grigory twists the lower and upper parts
text: of the guard's body in opposite directions.
text: With a wet CRUNCH, the guard's shadow on the wall goes limp.
text: Grigory looks at Ilsa.
speaker_heading: GRIGORY
dialog: Ready the welcome, my love --
text: Ilsa opens the reliquary jar and pours a circle of sand onto

speaker_heading: GRIGORY

text: He deposits it in mid-air, at the center of the circle.
text: Then, the sand begins to move, like liquid mercury. Lines

text: CORKBOARD covered with hundreds of Polaroids depicting scenes
dialog: of everyday life.
text: When the beam of light crosses her face, she turns slowly,
text: still asleep.
text: As the light fades, the shadows in the room grow deeper.
text: Grigory emerges from a dark corner. He gazes down on the

speaker_heading: GRIGORY
dialog: The Master is calling your name now,
dialog: my girl. We are all part of his plan.
dialog: You must return to the child... So,

text: He gently caresses the scar on her forehead. Under his skin,
text: a hideous movement, a writhing rearrangement of muscles. His
text: fingers start to glow.
speaker_heading: GRIGORY
dialog: ...dream of fire.
text: Liz convulses. A small ripple of heat rises from her forehead.
scene_heading: FLASH BACK TO:
scene_heading: EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING COURTYARD - DAY
text: Somewhere in a smokestack city, grown-ups and kids hang

dialog: courtyard.
scene_heading: ANGLE - LIZ - CONTINUOUS
text: Sitting on some tenement steps, LIZ, age 11. Sullen, alone,

text: A WOMAN -- Liz's MOTHER -- comes down the courtyard steps,

speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: (to Liz)
dialog: Liz!! Liz!! Come on, darling, give

speaker_heading: BLONDE KID
dialog: Freak!

speaker_heading: BLONDE KID

dialog: See? She knows her name.
text: Liz shies away from them.
speaker_heading: BLONDE KID
dialog: Go home, you freak. We don't want
dialog: you here.
text: They start throwing stones. One hits the steps. Another misses
text: her by inches. A third hits her in the shoulder.
text: Scared, Liz turns but a rock catches her full on the face.
text: She falls down, blood trickling from her forehead, splattering
text: the pavement. She starts sobbing. Another rock sails across,
text: but this time, in mid-air, it catches fire and turns to ash.
text: A ripple of heat starts crawling up Liz's hands. Soon a pale
text: blue flame rings her entire arm.
speaker_heading: LIZ

dialog: Not again, please, not again...
text: Firelight glints off the crucifix.

speaker_heading: LIZ

text: She then explodes. A white-hot supernova engulfs the
text: courtyard. Her mother's body burns like flash paper. Then
dialog: the rest of the people are --
scene_heading: THE ENTIRE TENEMENT COURTYARD
text: -- devoured by an explosion of atomic proportions. Benches,
text: people, trees. Everything. The four surrounding apartment

text: Liz... a little girl, still crying.
scene_heading: FLASH FORWARD TO:
scene_heading: INT. BELLAMIE HOSP. - LIZ'S ROOM, MIN. SEC. WARD - NIGHT

text: As Hellboy's pounding reaches his ears, he rises, like a

text: He opens an ancient leather folder and extracts an engraving

scene_heading: INT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 - (LOCATION R.WAREHOUSE) - DAY
text: Underwater, ABE finds an entire control room. 1940's magazines

scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY
text: Waiting above, Hellboy chews a Baby Ruth and pokes around.
text: Finds a pile of children's shoes covering some yellowing

scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL LABYRINTH (SET) - DAY

speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Damn it, Red.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 (LOCATION R. WAREHOUSE) - DAY
text: Abe nears the bottom of the cistern. As his feet touch bottom,
text: a cloud of silt fogs the water. He picks out a translucent
dialog: egg!
text: Suddenly, something big glides by. Abe turns: sees nothing.
text: He places the egg in a glass canister. Now eggs are floating
text: everywhere, undulating in the water like amber fireflies.
text: Abe swims slowly, collecting them one by one.
text: Some of them are snugly wedged between two rusty machines.
text: Abe's reliquary gets caught in a lever and snaps loose!! It
dialog: lands --
text: on a grate on the floor. Abe swims down and tries to grab
text: it, but it falls through. Abe curses and stands up --
text: -- only to find himself FACE TO FACE with Sammael!!
text: The monster rakes Abe across the chest; dark blue blood begins
text: to flow. Abe shoves himself into a long, concrete fissure.
text: Sammael can't fit through, but the tongue darts out, missing
text: Abe by inches. Sammael scratches at the walls, trying to
text: reach deeper, screaming in rage.
text: Abe screams too, emitting a trail of bubbles.
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM - DAY
text: The bubbles burst on the surface. Watching them is a SECOND

scene_heading: INT. INTERSECTION (LOCATION /BUILT SUGAR FACTORY) - DAY

scene_heading: INT. (LOCATION/BUILT SUGAR FACTORY) FURNACE ROOM - DAY
text: Hellboy stands in Kroenen's quarters. An array of gas masks

text: Suddenly: drool drops from above: Sammael hangs from a beam.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: (turning)
dialog: Didn't I kill you already?
text: Sammael lunges, hurling Hellboy through an open service

dialog: explosion of coins, glass and steel!!! Some bold New Yorker
text: in the crowd start picking up handfuls of change.
text: The dust clears, revealing a large crater in the platform
dialog: floor.
text: Sammael hits Hellboy. The Red Giant lands on a line of
text: turnstiles, uprooting them all.
text: Sammael flies through the air, unfolds its bone scythe.
text: Hellboy rolls away. Sammael misses: the tip imbeds itself in
text: the floor and then -- TCHAKKK!!! -- in a concrete column.
text: Sammael pulls, bringing down part of the ceiling. More SCREAMS
text: from the fleeing public.
text: A mezzanine above Hellboy collapses, bringing the ceiling,
text: steel cables and office furniture down onto the Red Giant.
text: Sammael takes a step towards the crowd and roars --
text: Then, BAMMMMMM!!! A desk flies up into the air. Hellboy's

speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Hey, Chunk-face!
text: He climbs out of the crater. Sammael growls.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: You can do better than that. Big

text: Hellboy rips off one of the turnstile bars and hits Sammael
dialog: again and again.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: See? It hurts! You shouldn't hit
dialog: people!
text: Sammael blocks the last hit and throws the bar away. It embeds
text: itself in the tile wall.
text: Sammael punches Hellboy, a hard uppercut.
text: Hellboy flies up, crashing through the plate glass of a second
text: mezzanine above the platform. He skids on the tile floor,
text: scraping a jagged line with his stone hand.
text: He slides past a group of BYSTANDERS and into a row of backlit
text: subway ads. He lands in a shower of glass and debris on a
text: wooden bench, breaking it in two.
text: Sammael climbs up into the mezzanine.
text: Hellboy gets up -- his back bristling with glass shards --

speaker_heading: YOUND GIRL
dialog: My kittens!! My kittens!!!
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Aw, crap.
text: Sammael charges!!! Hellboy scoops up the box, holds it high!!
text: Using his bone blade, Sammael pulverizes the bench.
text: Next, Sammael slashes at Hellboy, scattering a dozen shrieking
dialog: citizens.
text: Illuminated by sparks and shorting lamps, Hellboy advances,
text: blood dripping from his forehead and nose.
text: Hellboy starts to reload, but -- Sammael's tongue shoots
text: out. Hellboy throws the kitten box in the air and -- traps
dialog: the tongue with his stone hand --
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Second date. No tongue!!
text: -- while catching the box with his tail. The kittens are
dialog: fine.
text: Using the tongue, he throws Sammael out a glass window.
text: Sammael dangles above the tracks, but he re-joints himself
text: and grabs a handhold on the train wall above the tunnel.
text: From here, he pulls on Hellboy, sliding him toward the jagged
dialog: glass.
text: Sammael pulls harder, enters the tunnel.
text: Hellboy fights to free himself, but his sweaty face is
text: millimeters away from being sliced by the glass. All seems
dialog: lost, when...
text: WHAAAAA!!!!!! A train appears out of nowhere heading straight

text: He's sitting at a stainless steel desk, deep in concentration,
text: writing with evident difficulty. The floor around him is
text: covered with more crumpled pages. In the background, the

speaker_heading: of CHILI.
speaker_heading: MYERS

speaker_heading: HELLBOY

speaker_heading: MYERS

speaker_heading: HELLBOY

speaker_heading: BROOM

scene_heading: EXT. RUINS OF N.Y. - DUSK

speaker_heading: GRIGORY
dialog: In the frozen waters of the Malaya

scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - THE TRUCK BED - DAY

speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: (on the radio)
dialog: This better be the place or I'll

speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Sebastian Plackba #16...
scene_heading: 19TH CENTURY CEMETERY (MATTE SHOT / COMPOSITE)
text: Broken spiked fences succumb to rust and dead vines. Endless

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - MAUSOLEUM SECTION (LOCATION) - DAY
text: Later. The group gathers in frustration in an area of baroque

text: looks around.
speaker_heading: MANNING
dialog: Forget it. This is practically a
text: city. And it stinks, and it's muddy.
dialog: We'll go back, check into a hotel,

dialog: to make a grid, go by quadrants.
dialog: Maybe satellite photography.
text: He gestures and all the agents head for the vans.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Let me ask for directions.
scene_heading: EXT. OPEN GRAVE - DAY
text: The group surrounds a grave. Hellboy raises the broken stone
text: cover and then jumps in.
scene_heading: EXT. OPEN GRAVE (SET) - DAY
text: -- and lands on a rotten coffin. In it, a mummified corpse
text: lies in a miserable black suit.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Animam edere, animus corpus...
text: He presses the amulet on the cadaver's forehead. For a moment,
dialog: nothing, and then...
text: ...a brutal spasm!! The corpse gasps, breathes... and mutters
text: something in tongueless Russian. SUBTITLE: WHAT DO YOU WANT?
scene_heading: EXT. MOSCOW CEMETERY (LOCATION) - DAY
text: The group gawks as Hellboy climbs out, carrying the CORPSE
text: on his back. With an ear-to-ear grin, he approaches the team.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
text: Sixty feet further, comrades, and
text: three rows in...
text: The corpse fidgets on Hellboy's back. Its bony hand weakly
text: points, as if in confirmation.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: This here is Ivan Klimentovich: Say
dialog: "hi" Ivan.
text: The corpse mutters again. SUBTITLED: GO THAT WAY, RED MONKEY.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - YEFIMOVICH MAUSOLEUM (LOCATION) - DAY
text: A miniature black marble castle. Using a crowbar, Myers pries

speaker_heading: OMIT
scene_heading: INT. YEFIMOVICH MAUSOLEUM STAIRS - LATER - DAY
text: Two agents stand guard in the mausoleum, while the group

scene_heading: INT. YEFIMOVICH MAUSOLEUM - UNDERGROUND - STAIRCASE
text: Myers' flashlight flickers. He shakes it back to life.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND - UNDERGROUND INTERSECTION
text: They reach the bottom of the staircase: three corridors branch
text: off in different directions. Hellboy deposits the CORPSE
text: attop a pile of coffins.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: We'll be alright... as long as we
dialog: don't separate --
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR AND INTERSECTION - DAY
text: TCHKANGGG!!!!! large spiked metal plates shoot up from below,
text: blocking both their way out, demolishing the staircase and
text: ramming Stone: he's gone.
text: Wicked spikes cover the metal surface. Hellboy still bangs
text: on it, but to no avail: it's at least six inches thick. Liz
text: and Myers are on the other side.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: (into his walkie-talkie)
dialog: Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn
dialog: on your locators -- Anyone sees
dialog: anything...
speaker_heading: LIZ

speaker_heading: HELLBOY

speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: (into radio)
dialog: Are you sure about this?
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: On a scale of one to ten: two. But --
dialog: (beat)
dialog: -- she'll take care of you, Myers.
dialog: She's a tough one.
text: Liz and Myers move off. Hellboy shines his light down the
text: tunnel on the left. Agent Lime picks up the corpse and
text: follows.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL "A" / CHAMBER - DAY
text: Hellboy and Manning come into a vast chamber: Slavic motifs
text: crown the rugged stone pillars and archways. Water runs down
dialog: the walls.
text: Across a small stone bridge, light pours from a hexagonal
dialog: structure.
text: They step onto the bridge. KLANGGG!!! two gears release a
text: steel door from above, forcing them to forge ahead.
text: Somewhere, a massive clockwork is TICKING.
speaker_heading: MANNING
dialog: What's that --
text: Hellboy motions for silence. The CORPSE mutters: "IT'S
scene_heading: SOMETHING BIG"
text: They stare into the darkness.
speaker_heading: MANNING
dialog: We should go back -- you -- you could
dialog: tear that door apart --
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Don't move. We --
speaker_heading: MANNING
dialog: -- should go back. Now!
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: No. Don't --
speaker_heading: MANNING
dialog: I'm in charge. We go back!
text: Hellboy yanks Manning just in time. BAMMM!!!! A gigantic
text: metal pendulum swings past and demolishes one third of the
text: bridge a few feet from their feet. It takes Lime and the
text: CORPSE with it.
text: Another door on the far end of the bridge shudders downward.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Son of a --
text: Whoosh! The PENDULUM swings back. It destroys more of the
text: bridge. Manning sprints for all he's worth and crawls under
text: the door.
text: Hellboy runs, but chunks of stone disintegrate under his
dialog: feet.
text: The pendulum swings back taking out the final piece of the
text: bridge just as Hellboy rolls under the door --
text: -- and makes it into the hexagonal building.
scene_heading: INT. STONE CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Hellboy and Manning find themselves in a very narrow, arched
text: stone corridor. Its walls are lined with endless rows of
text: rusty steel blades.
text: Faint traces of WAGNER can be heard. They cautiously
dialog: proceed...
scene_heading: INT. HEXAGONAL STONE LAB - DAY
text: There. In yellow gaslight, Kroenen nods attentively as a
text: phonograph plays the love duet from TRISTAN UND ISOLDE.
text: Above him, ropes, hooks and pulleys.
scene_heading: INT. STONE CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Manning rest his hand too close to a blade.
speaker_heading: MANNING
dialog: Ouch!!
scene_heading: INT. HEXAGONAL STONE LAB - DAY
text: Kroenen comes alert. He scans the room, quietly winds himself
dialog: up.
scene_heading: INT. STONE CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Hellboy shoots a dirty look at Manning and then looks back
dialog: into the chamber --
text: -- Kroenen is gone.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: (to Manning)
dialog: Crap. This guy moves like a cockroach --
text: Hellboy readies his gun and then creeps toward the lab.
scene_heading: INT. HEXAGONAL STONE LAB - DAY
text: Hellboy's footsteps elicit soft creaks from the wooden floor.
text: Manning moves along behind him.
text: The record finishes playing. Silence --
text: SWISH!!! Kroenen's whirling blades slice the air, ripping
text: into Manning's arm. As Kroenen goes in for the kill --
text: -- Hellboy thrusts out his stone fist as a shield. Kroenen
text: bears down but Hellboy fends him off with powerful, deliberate
dialog: blocks.
text: Kroenen hauls out one of his long swords.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Screw that.
text: Hellboy yanks it away and bends it like a twig. BAMMMM!!!!
text: He punches Kroenen in the face, crumpling the steel mask,
text: smashing its lenses.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: You killed my father --
dialog: BAMMM!!!! another hit.
text: Kroenen staggers back with each blow. Finally, the mask falls
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Give your soul to God, Your ass is
dialog: mine.
text: An asthmatic wheeze erupts from his scarred face. Kroenen is
text: laughing.
scene_heading: INT. HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY
text: BAM!!! Under his feet, a huge trapdoor falls open. He and
text: Manning drop through, along with the phonograph.
text: Hellboy grabs a rope. It spins through a copper pulley, but
text: a large knot jerks him to a stop. Hellboy snatches Manning's
text: hand, but loses his backpack.
text: He looks down. The phonograph hits the ground with a crash.
speaker_heading: MANNING
dialog: (panting, whispers)
dialog: Well, it's not that big a fall...
text: KLANGGGG!!!!! The entire bottom bristles with six-foot,
text: sparkling steel blades.
scene_heading: INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY
text: Kroenen cautiously leans over the pit. He can't hear a sound.
text: As he peeks -- SWISH!! A loop of the rope wraps around his
text: neck and yanks him forward! Before he goes over, he
text: frantically digs his blades into the floor, anchoring himself.
scene_heading: INT. HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY
text: Hellboy has used the rope hanging below him as a lasso.
text: MANNING clings to his powerful back as he climbs up, hand
text: over hand.
scene_heading: INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY
text: Kroenen goes to cut the rope...
scene_heading: INT. HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: (reaching the top)
dialog: Oh, no you don't --
text: Hellboy wraps the rope around his stone fist and, with a
text: brutal stone-fist yank, pulls KROENEN into the pit!
text: With a horrible scream, Kroenen drops headfirst past them
text: and onto the spikes. He wriggles like a fish caught on a
text: hook, only making it worse, as he slides further down the
dialog: blades.
scene_heading: INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY
text: Hellboy climbs out and sits. Sees Kroenen's blade embedded
text: in the floor. Holding it: the prosthetic hand, still ticking.
scene_heading: INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY
text: Hellboy peers down. Still alive, Kroenen frees one arm,
text: slicing through his own ropy bicep.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: You like playing possum, you Nazi
dialog: pinhead?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Then try playing dead.
scene_heading: INT. BOTTOM OF HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY
text: Hellboy tips a massive cogwheel over the edge. Kroenen emits
text: a horrid scream as it crushes him.
scene_heading: INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY
text: Manning sits down, bandaging his injuries. Hellboy kneels
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Are you okay?
text: Manning nods weakly. Hellboy brings out a cigar and fires up
dialog: his Zippo.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: You'd better stay here. I'll find a
dialog: way out. We'll come back for you.
speaker_heading: MANNING
dialog: You call that thing a cigar??
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: MANNING
dialog: You never, ever light a cigar that
dialog: way.
text: He digs out one of his fine cigars, cuts it and hands it to
scene_heading: HELLBOY.
speaker_heading: MANNING
dialog: Use a wooden match. It preserves the
dialog: flavor.
text: He lights it for him. Hellboy grins.
speaker_heading: MANNING
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: My job.
speaker_heading: OMIT
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND NARROW TUNNEL - DAY
text: A narrow tunnel. Liz and Myers advance carefully.
text: Just ahead, a cave-in. Pieces of ceiling, timber, coffins
text: and corpses form a chaotic barrier. As they squeeze past...
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: So, he thinks that you and I... That's
dialog: why he's mad at me --
text: A few bones roll by. Wet earth drops onto their shoulders.
text: They draw their arms close to their bodies, pointing their
text: flashlight beams straight down. A moment of strange intimacy.
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: But it's not true, is it?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: What -- ?
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: That you feel that way about me.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: You want to know -- Now -- ? Here?
dialog: Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all
dialog: the same.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL "C" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - STEEP SLOPE - DAY
text: Hellboy labors up a steep slope, using rocks and roots for
text: handholds. He reaches a dead end and collapses, out of breath.
text: Light filters through a crack in the ground; he can faintly
dialog: hear Liz and Myers.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - CAVERN AREA - DAY
text: Liz and Myers reach a wider section of Tunnel "B". They find
text: themselves calf-deep in brown water.
text: Myers lights Liz's path as she steps onto a large stone.
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: Watch out. It's slippery...
text: His light shorts out. She shines her light past him.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Oh, my God...
text: Myers turns. His flashlight comes back on, revealing a complex
text: natural cavern. An entire WALL IS COVERED with translucent
dialog: eggs.
text: SAMMAEL is there, gnawing on a dry arm bone, with the hand
text: still attached. When the light hits his face, his milky pupils
text: constrict. A snarl...
text: A SECOND SAMMAEL emerges from the water. It shakes itself
text: off. A THIRD ONE raise its head.
text: Myers and Liz try to back away, but a metal wall rises right
text: behind them KLANKKKKK!!! They are trapped!!
text: Myers goes to grab a set of explosive belts. Tries to set up
text: the timer. Zipp! -- one Sammael snatches them away. Myers
text: falls to the ground, clothes torn, injured.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: (into the radio)
dialog: Marco, Marco, Marco... Get your Big
dialog: Red butt over here!
text: Something stomps on the ceiling directly above them. Again
dialog: and again.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL "C" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL FLOOR - DAY
text: Hellboy pounds the floor with his rock hand. Furiously.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Hang on kid, I'm coming for you!!
text: The rocks below him start to crumble.
scene_heading: EXT. ANTHILL VIEW OF UNDERGROUND TUNNELS AND PITS - DAY
text: In an "ANT FARM" view of the complex, we see Hellboy above,
text: pummeling and -- in the cavern below -- Liz and Myers.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL CAVERN AREA - DAY
text: Dust and rocks fall from above. The four identical creatures
text: move in on Liz and Myers. Myers shoots one in the head three
text: times. The creature shakes off the hits as if pelted with
text: pebbles.
text: One of them springs. As it flies through the air, Hellboy
text: crashes through the ceiling. He lands on top of it along
text: with a ton or two of stone. The creature is crushed.
text: Two eggs glow, metamorphosing. Presto -- two new Sammaels
text: are born. The first two Sammaels growl, joined by the two
text: new ones. Liz sprints to safety.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Sorry. Just couldn't leave you two
dialog: alone.
text: Hellboy scoops up Myers and deposits him next to Liz.
text: Lit by Myers' flashlight, two of the creatures jump. One
text: clamps onto Hellboy's back, the other onto his leg. Hellboy
text: howls. The third one joins in, like lions dragging down a
text: zebra. This time, though, the zebra fights back.
text: Hellboy pulls out his gun and fires a round into the chest
text: of a Sammael. Two eggs glow -- two new Sammaels are born.
dialog: They're FIVE.
text: Hellboy's torso is covered in blood. He falls to the ground.
text: A fourth and a fifth creature spring onto him, biting. Hellboy
dialog: is in trouble.
text: Liz watches and shivers. A ripple of heat shimmers over her
dialog: body.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: (at Myers)
dialog: Hit me.
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: What?
text: Liz is desperate, crying.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Hit me --
dialog: (beat)
dialog: All of my life I've run away from
dialog: it... Now I want it to happen! Do
dialog: it.
text: Hellboy screams. Water explodes under the fighting bodies.
text: Two of the Sammaels turn their attention to Liz and Myers.
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: I can't, I --
text: Liz slaps him.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I know now: I love him. I've always
dialog: loved him.
text: A beat of silence, then Myers slaps her across the face,
text: once. Hard. The heat ripple builds. The air vibrates around
text: her. Her pupils kick back light, like an animal's.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Go now.
text: Myers ducks behind a rock as Liz's arms blaze with fire.
text: The two approaching Sammaels are ready to pounce.
text: On top of Hellboy, one of them turns its head, like a lion
text: hearing the hunter's gunshots. A staggering Hellboy sees
text: Liz's body shake in a surge of white-hot energy.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: (weak)
dialog: Liz...
text: The water at her feet blows away as a concave shockwave of
text: fire expands.
text: The fire engulfs the creatures. Devours them all.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL CAVERN AREA - DAY
text: The screen FADES TO WHITE and then...
text: Silence, then a pulse. A high ringing tone. A heartbeat.
text: Hellboy pushes away the half-cooked remains of two Sammaels.
text: The other creatures are little more than blackened bones. He
text: stumbles forward. No water left. Everything is half-buried
text: in a cracked, bone-dry bed of mud. Liz lies on the ground,
text: on her side, unconscious.
text: Myers is alive, but too groggy to even acknowledge it. Weakly,
text: Hellboy turns around: In the eerie silence of his deafness,
text: he sees Grigory -- LAUGHING noiselessly, witness to an absurd
dialog: comedy.
text: Ilsa approaches. And -- in a simple, brutal move -- hits him
dialog: with a hammer --
speaker_heading: FADE OUT / FADE IN
speaker_heading: OMIT
scene_heading: INT. THE CATACOMBS - NIGHT
text: Hellboy slowly comes to. He is chained to a massive wooden
text: yoke. He takes notice of his surroundings: a large church-
text: like space, surrounded by funeral niches and statues holding
text: swords. High columns flank huge mechanical gears. An SOLAR
text: SYSTEM MODEL takes the place of an altar.
text: Off to one side, Ilsa uses a hammer to destroy the timers on
text: the explosive belts.
text: Next to the main nave, Myers is tied to a stone pillar. Under
text: his feet, a blood channel, leading to the immense stone slab
dialog: bought from Lapikov.
text: Liz lies at Grigory's feet. He's dressed in a ceremonial
text: robe and holds his leather book open. His back to Hellboy,
text: he faces a mural of the angel Abbadon holding a key.
speaker_heading: GRIGORY
dialog: "And I looked and beheld an Angel,
text: and in his hand the key to the
dialog: bottomless pit..."
text: Hellboy tenses, rage building. The yoke creaks, but doesn't
dialog: bend.
speaker_heading: GRIGORY
text: (gestures at the stone
dialog: piece)
dialog: These were the words I heard as a
dialog: peasant boy in Tobolsk. And now, the
dialog: door -- Sent by the Ogdruh Jahad so
dialog: that they might at long last enter
dialog: our world.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: (to Hellboy)
dialog: You are the key! The right hand of
dialog: doom!
text: Hellboy studies the stone sculpture, its three HAND IMPRINTS --
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: (triumphant)
dialog: What did you think it was made for?
dialog: Open the locks.
text: Hellboy stares at his huge right arm, as if for the first
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: Don't do it!! Don't do it!!
text: Ilsa kicks Myers in the face.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Silence!!
text: The open dome above reveals the moon. An eclipse is beginning.
text: The altar's clockworks monitors its progress.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Imagine it: An eden for you and her --
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: No.
text: Grigory turns to Hellboy.
speaker_heading: GRIGORY
dialog: No?
dialog: (reasonable)
dialog: In exchange for her life then, open
text: the door.
text: In torment, Hellboy, shakes his head: no.
speaker_heading: GRIGORY
dialog: As you wish.
text: He leans over Liz, whispers in her ear: Her body arches, her
text: mouth emits a plume of energy. Grigory greedily inhales it.
text: Then she goes limp.
speaker_heading: GRIGORY
text: She's dead.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Noooo! Noooo!!!
text: He struggles again. One of the cuffs snaps. He swats Ilsa
text: with his free hand. She stumbles backwards. Now Hellboy fights
text: to free his other hand. Indifferent, Grigory watches the
dialog: eclipse.
speaker_heading: GRIGORY
text: Her soul awaits on the other side.
dialog: If you want her back...
dialog: (beat)
text: Open the door and claim her.
text: His head and heart racing, Hellboy struggles for an answer.
text: Can't find one... the moon is almost totally eclipsed.
text: He drops his gaze. His voice a hoarse whisper.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: For her.
text: Grigory moves close to Hellboy. Rips the rosary off his wrist.
text: It lands near Myers.
speaker_heading: GRIGORY
dialog: Names hold the power and nature of
dialog: things. Mine for example. Rasputin:
dialog: "The crossroads."
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And crossroads I have become.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat

speaker_heading: HELLBOY

scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
text: Hellboy's stone arm glows. Ancient symbols of fire burn the
text: stone. Flames momentarily engulf his body.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
text: Hellboy roars as his HORNS majestically burst forth! Out of
text: his mouth, energy and light boil like condensing breath on a
dialog: winter's night.
text: Inebriated with power, the new PRINCE OF HELL smiles with
text: supreme arrogance. His shadow falls on the white marble of
text: the slab and mysteriously spreads over it until the stone
text: turns black as obsidian.
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: No!! Don't do it!! Listen to me!!
text: HELLBOY inserts his enormous paw into the FIRST IMPRINT on
text: the stone slab -- CLACK!! He turns it, like a lock.
text: A beam of crimson light shoot upwards into the sky.
scene_heading: EXT. VIEW FROM THE CITY - NIGHT
text: Visible from all over Moscow, the beam blazes to the moon!
dialog: The same phenomenon as in the prologue, but this time it's
text: more intense, with ripples and haloes.
scene_heading: INT. THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT
text: Again, the infinite, starry space. Again, the OGDRU JAHAD.
text: The ruby beam pierces the darkness.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
text: Hellboy watches as the FIRST IMPRINT disappears. In its place:
text: a burning glyph.
text: Myers struggles with his bindings. The rough hemp cuts his
text: skin, but he manages to free one hand.
scene_heading: EXT. ON THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT
text: OGDRU JAHAD shifts, suddenly breaking free. Gelatinous limbs
text: uncurl, expand. Its enormity puzzles the eye, obscuring the
dialog: frame.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
text: Hellboy thrusts his hand into the SECOND IMPRINT. CLACK! He
dialog: turns it.
text: Myers spots the broken rosary and reaches for it --
scene_heading: INT. THE SKY - NIGHT
text: IN THE STORM CLOUDS, LIGHTNING ILLUMINATES GARGANTUAN
text: TENTACLES REACHING INTO THE EARTHLY PLANE.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
text: Grigory drinks in the first signs of the arrival and laughs.
speaker_heading: GRIGORY
dialog: The final seal. Open it!
text: Hellboy puts his hand inside, CLACK!!! Before he can turn
text: it, Myers reaches the rosary. Ilsa lunges at him. He clobbers
text: her full in the face. She staggers back and down.
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: (to Hellboy)
dialog: Remember who you are!!!
text: He throws the rosary at Hellboy. Instinctively, Hellboy
text: catches it. It smokes in his hand.
text: He tosses it away. It lands next to the explosive belts.
text: Hellboy opens his palm, seeing the smoking, charred imprint
text: of the cross and beads. He looks over at Grigory.
text: With a blood-curdling scream, Hellboy grabs his horns with
text: both hands, brutally snaps them off. Energy spews from the
text: stumps.
text: He stabs Grigory with one of them. Grigory drops to his knees,
text: holding his stomach. Hellboy drops the blood-stained horn.
text: The final lock disappears into the stone. The light flickers
text: and the connection with the moon is broken.
text: Ilsa, licking her bloody lips, looks up. The sky is silent.
text: The thunderclouds are parting. The eclipse has ended.
text: Grigory crumples in agony.
text: The burning glyphs in Hellboy's stone hand dim down, his
text: features and body resume their usual shape. All is quiet.
speaker_heading: GRIGORY
dialog: You will never fulfill your destiny.
dialog: You will never understand the power
dialog: inside you.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: I can live with that.
text: He breaks Myers' chains, helps him up.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
text: Hellboy painfully takes Liz's limp body in his arms. Myers
text: stands by his side.
text: He kisses her forehead, caresses her hair, then walks down
dialog: the steps.
text: Myers steps on something. He looks under his foot: A smashed
text: GLASS EYE. Then... out of the silence, a WHISPER.
speaker_heading: GRIGORY
dialog: Child...
text: Hellboy turns. Grigory, on his knees, smiles.
speaker_heading: GRIGORY
dialog: (dying)
dialog: Look what you've done --
text: He looks up. In his empty eye socket, fleshy tendrils shift
text: lazily.
speaker_heading: GRIGORY
dialog: You've killed me -- an insignificant
dialog: man... but you have brought forth a
dialog: God.
text: He uncovers his abdomen. Long, fleshy pseudopods spill out
text: of the wound, like intestines.
text: A large entity erupts from Grigory's torso and claws the

speaker_heading: GRIGORY
dialog: Behold, my master, Behemoth. Guardian
dialog: of thresholds, destroyer of worlds.
text: Covered in steamy slime, a seven foot, multi-tentacled shape --
text: BABY BEHEMOTH -- lands on the stone slab. The squirming flesh
text: surges up like greasy pink foam. Growing exponentially by
dialog: the second.
text: Ilsa kneels and embraces Grigory's corpse. Kisses him on the
text: mouth. A gargantuan tentacled shadow looms above them.
speaker_heading: ILSA
dialog: Hell will hold no surprises for us.
text: A tower of flesh disdainfully crushes them both.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS - ADJACENT TUNNEL - NIGHT
text: In a passageway, Hellboy carefully hands Liz's body over to
dialog: Myers.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll
dialog: deal with whatever's back there.
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: Alone?
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: How big can it be?
text: As if in response, a massive tentacle fills the tunnel,
text: reaching for him. Oil lamps hanging from the ceiling smash
text: onto HELLBOY´S head as he is pulled back at breakneck speed,
dialog: finally confronting --
scene_heading: INT. THE CATACOMBS - NIGHT
text: BEHEMOTH!!! The size of a house --
text: Hellboy -- head smoking -- writhes in the grip of the
text: tentacle. It suddenly throws him toward the ceiling.
text: As he arcs back down, ABM!! -- he cracks the floor wide open.
text: Next to him: the rosary and the EXPLOSIVE BELTS. He tries to
text: grab them. The tentacle slams down, blocking his way.
text: The vibration sends the belts down into the crack. They bounce
text: off a small ledge and land further down. Far below, grinding
text: cogwheels and gears.
text: Hellboy manages to pull a steel sword from the closest marble
dialog: statue.
text: Hellboy stands up and swings the sword for all he's worth.
text: FWAP! He cuts clean through the tentacle. The tip hits the
text: floor, rolling into the crack.
text: From out of Behemoth's stump... a mass of wriggling tentacles
text: replaces the cut-off section! They squirm around Hellboy's
text: face as he slashes, again and again, fighting his way forward.
text: He leans into the crack, stretches his arm, struggling to
text: grab the belts. A few inches short. He jumps into the crevice,
text: onto the first ledge. It crumbles!!
text: The gears below grind a few falling bricks. The belts slide
dialog: away.
text: A tentacle captures Hellboy, pulls him up. At the last second,
text: he grabs the belts with his tail.
text: The beast raises Hellboy high. A multi-layered mouth opens
text: in the body of BEHEMOTH. The most horrible proboscis ever
dialog: seen.
text: Hellboy's tail passes him the belts.
text: The timers on them are crushed. A spark spurts: Useless.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: They never work --
text: He wraps them around his stone arm.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Ugh -- Now, this is gonna hurt --
text: He pulls the pin on all the explosives. BEHEMOTH drops him
text: into a squid-like beak and gulps him down.
text: After a moment, a weird gurgle emanates from the creature's
dialog: innards. Then --
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
text: A surge of light roils within the thing, outlining the pulpy
text: organs. The creature starts to burn.
speaker_heading: OMIT
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
text: A chain reaction yields a cacophony of explosions as Behemoth
text: is enveloped in a cloud of fire, goo and soft flesh.
text: Hellboy lands with a sickening, bone-crunching THUD!!!
text: With a bellow, Behemoth goes down, the limp tentacles missing
text: Hellboy as they vanish in a blaze of energy and light.
text: Finally, just a few cinders of flesh float in the air.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
text: Hellboy stands, covered in goo. Two final shockwaves of light
text: ripple over the ground.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Ouch -- It did hurt.
scene_heading: INT. ADJACENT TUNNEL
text: Hellboy lurches into the passageway and spots Myers. Painfully
text: drags himself over. Liz's body is on the floor.
text: Manning limps in from an adjacent room. Hellboy cradles Liz's
text: head in his huge hand. Holds her against his powerful chest
text: and whispers in her ear.
text: A beat or two, then a moan.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: In the dark -- I heard your voice --
dialog: What -- did you say -- ?
text: He looks at her, lovingly caressing her hair.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: "You, on the other side: let her go.
dialog: Because for her, for her -- I'll
dialog: die. I'll cross over."
dialog: (beat)
dialog: "And you'll be sorry I did."
text: Myers smiles. Liz looks at Hellboy for the first time as
text: what he is: the man she loves. A warm, gentle fire rims her
dialog: body.
text: Manning watches. Agent Myers smiles a sad smile, illuminated
text: by the flames.
text: Hellboy and Liz kiss. The fire haloes them and builds as Tom
text: Waits' CINNY'S WALTZ fills the air.
