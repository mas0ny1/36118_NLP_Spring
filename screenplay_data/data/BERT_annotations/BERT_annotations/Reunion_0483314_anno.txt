speaker_heading: HANNAH

dialog: change the meaning.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: But there is a difference.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Let her finish.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: He found another translation that
dialog: said, "Do thou rule over him." And
dialog: that's an order from God, for man
dialog: to rule over evil. Neither one
dialog: really gives anyone any choice, you
dialog: see? So Steinbeck went back to the
dialog: original hebrew and found one
dialog: word...
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: One word?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What was it?
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Timshel... and it meant, "thou
dialog: mayest." And this is very
dialog: different, it's not an order or a
dialog: promise, it's a choice, and it's
dialog: our choice. We may... but we also
dialog: may not. It's an offering of free
dialog: will, and it's about individual
dialog: responsibility and the invention of
dialog: consciousness. And that's what
text: Morton was talking about. He was
dialog: trying to tell us that we had a
