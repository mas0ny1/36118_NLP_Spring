speaker_heading: ACT ONE
scene_heading: INT. LSAT TESTING FACILITY - AFTERNOON
text: We open on a sign in large letters, “30 MINUTES LEFT.” As a
text: hand replaces “30” with “15;"” REVEAL a large room filled with
text: college students furiously racing to finish the LSAT test.
text: We pan across to the one figure who seems unfazed. MIKE ROSS
text: (Mets hat, short-hair, glasses, goatee) has already finished
text: and is doodling on the back of the test.
text: Mike notices a PROCTOR walk by, looking at him curiously. He
text: quickly turns the test over and pretends to nervously work on
text: it. We speed up time as the “MINUTES LEFT” sign goes from
text: “10” to “5" to 4,3,2,1. Finally the proctor yells:
speaker_heading: PROCTOR
text: Time’s up. Pencils down.
text: Mike blends in with the students and tosses his test on the
text: pile. As he leaves, the proctor moves the pile to the side,
text: leaving Mike’s test on top, then he taps Mike from behind.
speaker_heading: PROCTOR
dialog: Excuse me. Do I know you from somewhere?
text: We see anxiety momentarily cross Mike’s face. He swallows,
text: then turns around to see the Proctor looking at him intently.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I don’t think so. I have a very good
dialog: memory for faces.
text: The Proctor shrugs, he must be wrong. Mike walks away. The
text: Proctor hesitates, thinks to himself, then turns to pick up
text: Mike’s test; the pile’s knocked over, no way to tell which is
text: the one he wants. He turns back; no Mike. He yells...
speaker_heading: PROCTOR
dialog: Hey!
text: He fights through a group of students to get out the door...
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LSAT TEST - CONTINUOUS
text: Mike’s just outside the door. He breaks into a run around
text: the corner to a door at the end of the hall. No good, jammed
text: with students, he won’t have time to get through. As he runs
text: to his right, he trips over a GUY WEARING A METS SHIRT.
dialog: A Legal Mind 2.
scene_heading: INT. LSAT TEST FACILITY/HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: The proctor bursts through the throng of students and runs to
text: the door where Mike just was. He sees Mike from behind. He
text: grabs him, turns him around... it’s not Mike. The guy with
text: the Mets shirt is now wearing Mike’s Met’s cap. The proctor
text: looks down the hall, sees a men’s room and runs toward it.
scene_heading: INT. MEN’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Mike is in a stall. Without his Mets cap, his hair comes
text: down to his shoulders. He quickly removes his glasses and
text: the fake goatee he had on and flushes them. He exits the
text: stall, looking 100% different than he did seconds ago...
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MEN’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: A transformed Mike walks back down the hall with confidence.
text: He doesn’t break stride as the proctor runs by without even
text: noticing his existence. A small smile crosses his face...
scene_heading: INT. A SMALL APARTMENT - LATER
text: Mike knocks on the door of an apartment. It opens. The
text: YOUNG MAN looks exactly like Mike did at the LSAT’s. Short
text: hair, glasses, goatee. Mike returns his driver’s license.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Here.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: What did you get me?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What I said I was going to... a 158.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: I told you I wanted a 175.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: And I told you only one out of hundred
dialog: people can score that. You're a B-minus
dialog: student who got a thousand on the SAT’s.
dialog: I get you a 175 they’1ll know you cheated.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: So only a genius loser can get a 175?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Actually, I'd get a 180. Now, can I have
dialog: my money please?
text: The Young Man hands Mike a wad of cash. Mike counts it.
dialog: A Legal Mind 3.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: This is only half.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Then why don’t you go call the police?
text: The Young Man slams the door in Mike's face.
scene_heading: EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - 9:00 PM
text: We pan across the water to the facade of a gorgeous office
text: complex at the southern tip of the city. The offices in the
text: building are all dark. Except one. We ZOOM IN:
scene_heading: INT. STATE OF THE ART CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Two highly paid teams of LAWYERS SCREAM across the sleekest
text: conference table ever made. A young lawyer, LOUIS LITT, (33,
text: slick, arrogant) quietly exits.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY/KATHERINE PEARSON’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Louis is in the doorway of, “Katherine Pearson, Managing
dialog: Partner.” Louis knocks. Katherine (50's, distinguished)
text: doesn’t look up.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: We have a problem. The deal’s falling
dialog: apart.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Go get Harvey.
scene_heading: INT. PARK AVENUE CONDOMINIUM - SAME
text: Five well-heeled men play poker in the most expensive condo
text: in Manhattan. CLOSE ON HARVEY SPECTER, 42, with Clooney
text: looks. He’s fit, confident, takes pride in being well-
text: dressed. He watches as the river card is turned... A GREY
text: HAIRED MAN smiles at Harvey as he pushes in his chips.
speaker_heading: GREY HAIR
dialog: Raise fifty thousand.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I’m all in.
text: Harvey smiles back as he pushes a stack of chips three times
text: the size of Grey Hair’s bet into the pot.
scene_heading: INT. KATHERINE PEARSON’S OFFICE - SAME
text: Katherine is still at her desk. Louis knocks again.
dialog: A Legal Mind 4.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Gerald Tate is here. He wants to know
dialog: what’s happening to his deal.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Louis, didn’t I tell you to get Harvey?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Trust me, I can handle Gerald Tate.
text: Katherine looks up as if noticing Louis for the first time.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: No. You can’t.
scene_heading: INT. PARK AVENUE CONDOMINIUM - SAME
dialog: Harvey and Grey Hair are where we left them.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: The problem is, if you call, I’m going to
dialog: turn over two aces, and you'll lose.
speaker_heading: GREY HAIR
dialog: Yeah, yeah. And if I fold, you’ll show
dialog: me the bluff and it’1l kill me.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: If you fold, I’m not showing you anything.
text: A beat. Grey Hair pushes his chips in. Harvey throws his
text: cards down, revealing two aces...
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: That’s two hundred thousand.
dialog: (reads a text message, then)
dialog: You can pay me later... I’ve got to go.
scene_heading: INT. KATHERINE PEARSON'S OFFICE - 10:00 PM
text: GERALD TATE (55, street smart, ex-prize fighter) yells at
text: Katherine. Harvey saunters in unnoticed in his $4,000 suit.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: I don’t care who’s on his way. I'm
dialog: paying you millions, and you’re telling
dialog: me I’m going to get screwed?!
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Katherine, have I come at a bad time?
text: She cracks a smile. The cavalry is here. She hands Harvey a
text: stack of deal memos. Harvey proceeds to examine them.
dialog: A Legal Mind
text: A moment.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Gerald, I'd like you to meet Harvey
dialog: Specter. He’s our best attorney.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: If you’re their best attorney, where the
dialog: hell have you been the last three hours?
text: Harvey speaks calmly while scanning the memos.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Well, Gerald, I specialize in troubled
dialog: situations. And when I left here at 7:00
dialog: PM this deal wasn’t in jeopardy. So,
dialog: what I’m trying to do now is understand
dialog: what happened in the interim.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: We keep raising the price and they keep
dialog: rejecting it. It’s last minute bad faith
dialog: bullshit.
text: Harvey ignores Gerald and continues scanning.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: It says here Cooper's no longer staying
dialog: on as honorary Vice President.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: That’s right. I don’t want him around.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: He... wouldn’t be around. It’s an
dialog: honorary position.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: I don’t give a crap.
text: Harvey puts the memo down and looks Gerald in the eye.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I think you do. Because that’s what
dialog: changed since I left. Which means it’s
dialog: you who’s been dealing in bad faith.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: Well, now that you’ve gotten a handle on
dialog: what’s happened in the God damn interim,
dialog: what are you going to do about it?
dialog: Because he’s not getting that title.
text: Harvey casually pours a glass of water.
dialog: A Legal Mind 6.
dialog: He offers
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Let me just make sure I understand. We
dialog: negotiated a deal that got you everything
dialog: you wanted. Mr. Cooper signed it. And
dialog: now you won’t close until we take away
dialog: the last shred of his dignity?
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: Bingo.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Well, that’s not going to happen.
text: the water. Gerald looks at it with contempt, then:
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: Why the hell not?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Because I like Mr. Cooper. And my firm
dialog: doesn’t operate in bad faith.
text: Harvey drinks the water himself.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: How I see it is, instead of working
dialog: Cooper, you’re working me. So take your
dialog: faggoty attitude back in there and make
dialog: him sign my deal or I'll pay someone else
dialog: your money to do it for me.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: First of all, Gerald, if you think anyone
dialog: is gonna touch this deal after your bad
dialog: faith, you’re mistaken. Second, the way
dialog: our agreement works is the minute Cooper
dialog: signed the deal that gave you everything
dialog: you wanted, our fee was due and payable.
text: Harvey reaches into his jacket pocket.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Which is why at 7:30, I received
dialog: confirmation of a wire transfer from
text: escrow indicating payment in full.
text: He removes a fax.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I would say the ball’s in your court, but
dialog: the truth is your balls are in my fist.
dialog: I apologize if that image is too faggoty
dialog: for you, but I’m comfortable enough with
dialog: my manhood to put it out there.
dialog: A Legal Mind 7.
text: Harvey holds out the fax to Gerald, who is dumbstruck.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Now get your ass in there and close this
dialog: God damn deal.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: (to Katherine)
dialog: You let him talk to me like this?
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
text: Harvey speaks for the firm.
text: Gerald exits the office. Katherine leans in to Harvey.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: We got paid before Gerald signed the
dialog: deal?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
text: This is a memo about some fire drill on
dialog: Tuesday. By the way, you’re blue team
dialog: captain. You get to wear a fire hat.
scene_heading: INT. TREVOR STEVENS’ CONDOMINIUM —- CONTINUOUS
text: Leather couch, plasma TV, weed on the table; this is the pad
dialog: of a bachelor with serious disposable income. TREVOR, clean
text: cut, 22, suit and tie, takes a bite of a cheeseburger and
text: savors it. Mike looks at the bong, shakes his head to
text: himself and then turns to Trevor..
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I've got to get my shit together.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: This is the best cheeseburger I’ve ever
dialog: had in my life.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: It's from Monday. Trevor, I’m serious.
dialog: I almost got caught today, then my client
dialog: stiffed me for half. I’m sick of this
dialog: life. I’ve gotta stop getting stoned and
dialog: get my act together.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: Dude, look at me. You can bake up and
dialog: still be a success.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You sell pot for a living.
dialog: A Legal Mind 8.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: It still saps the motivation. Look, all
dialog: I’m saying is, you want in, you are in.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That's basically your offer before I got
dialog: caught cheating on your math test in
dialog: third grade.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: Goddamn memory.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: And by the way, it’s your offer on every
dialog: shady thing you’ve gotten me involved in.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: How was I supposed to know that chick was
dialog: the dean’s daughter? Look, nobody’s ever
dialog: going to suspect you’re a dealer.
text: Trevor indicates his clean cut image and suit and tie.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: Look at me. This is a two-thousand
dialog: dollar suit, I’ve got twelve of them.
text: Trevor starts counting on his fingers.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: I have an office, I take on real software
dialog: projects, my clients wear suits... They
dialog: give me briefcases of cash, I give them
text: identical briefcases with vacuum sealed
dialog: bud. I’m telling you, hide in plain
dialog: sight... oldest trick in the book.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: So what do you need me for?
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: I leave town tomorrow, I’ve got a client
dialog: coming in wants to meet at the Ritz. I
dialog: need somebody I trust to make the drop.
dialog: It’s totally safe. Come on, help me out.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You know, one stands a greater chance of
dialog: dying while dealing drugs than on death
dialog: row in Texas. Which begs the question:
dialog: why would anyone deal drugs?
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: What are you talking about?
dialog: A Legal Mind 9.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: It’s from “Freakonomics,” which I suggest
dialog: you read. But whether you do or you
dialog: don’t, you'll have to find someone else,
dialog: because I’m not interested.
speaker_heading: JENNY (0.S.)
dialog: Not interested in what?
text: JENNY GRIFFITH, Trevor's girlfriend, has entered the condo
text: without them noticing. She’s 22, dresses like a student, and
text: has no idea that Trevor deals pot. Trevor is defensive.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: What are you doing here? I thought you
dialog: were sleeping at your place tonight.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (what he should have said)
dialog: Hey, sweetie, what a pleasant surprise.
dialog: I’m so glad you stopped by.
text: She kisses Trevor then turns to Mike.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Not interested in what?
text: Mike and Trevor share a look, “What should we say?”
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Trevor's trying to set me up.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (covering)
dialog: That's terrific. Who’s the lucky girl?
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: I was trying to get him to work for me.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (brightening)
dialog: That's a great idea. It would take some
dialog: stress off of Trevor. And you’d pick up
dialog: writing code like you do everything else.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I’m gonna take off. I’ve got to get up
dialog: early to see my grandmother.
text: As Mike heads out, Jenny squeezes his hand.
scene_heading: INT. MANHATTAN UPSCALE BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Harvey and Katherine sit surrounded by beautiful people.
dialog: A Legal Mind 10.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: By the way, I’ve set up a meeting with
dialog: you and John Dockery next week.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Dockery? He’s Skadden’s biggest client.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
text: Not anymore. He’s looking around. He's
dialog: asked us to do a preliminary evaluation
dialog: of his corporate structure and assess
dialog: where he’s vulnerable to a takeover. I
dialog: want you to charm him and close him.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Consider it done.
text: A stunning WAITRESS approaches with their drinks. As
text: Katherine takes hers, she indicates Harvey to the waitress.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Miss, you are looking at the best closer
dialog: this city has ever seen.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: (to waitress, not embarrassed)
dialog: Katherine, please you're embarrassing me.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Closer, huh? Baseball?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Attorney. I close situations.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: So all you care about is money?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: The truth is... I do it for the children.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Handsome, wealthy, and funny... what do
dialog: you think you’re some kind of super hero?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I don’t like to toot my own horn. I feel
dialog: that question is best answered by one of
dialog: the many people whose lives I've saved.
text: She laughs.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: I’m Lisa.
dialog: A Legal Mind 11.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Harvey.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Well, Harvey, I don’t usually do this,
dialog: but I’m off in ten minutes. You want to
dialog: take me out for a drink?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Your timing couldn’t be more perfect.
dialog: Katherine here was just leaving.
text: Katherine is just starting to sip her full drink.
scene_heading: INT. MIKE’S STUDIO APARTMENT - NEXT MORNING
text: The unit’s barely larger than the table at the law firm.
text: Mike is asleep on a pullout that takes up the entire place.
text: An alarm rings. Mike hits snooze and goes back to sleep.
scene_heading: INT. EXQUISITE WEST END TOWN HOME - SAME
text: Katherine is eating an early breakfast with her mentor,
text: PHILLIP, a distinguished man in his seventies. His elegantly
text: appointed home resembles the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: .+-point is I can see myself stepping
dialog: down as senior partner in five years.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Seems like it’s only been ten minutes
dialog: since I handed the reins to you.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: It hasn't. Time just moves a lot faster
dialog: when you’re a hundred and sixty.
text: She smiles. There’s a pause...
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: What’s the matter?
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: How did you know I was your successor?
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: The truth? My gut. It told me you were
text: the only one with the balls for the job.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: That's what I was afraid you were going
dialog: to say. My gut tells me it’s Harvey.
text: But my heart tells me he’s not ready.
dialog: A Legal Mind 12.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: What’s he missing?
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Compassion.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Makes sense. The killer instinct that
dialog: makes him a great lawyer is what concerns
dialog: you about making him senior partner.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Exactly. If the leader of a firm doesn’t
dialog: care about the people who work for him or
dialog: the clients he represents... there won’t
dialog: be much of a firm left to lead.
text: Phillip refills her coffee.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: You know, you weren’t completely ready.
dialog: And he does have some years to learn.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: But compassion. I’m not sure you can
dialog: learn that.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: What are you going to do about it?
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: What would you do about it?
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: A man’s missing compassion? I'd shove
text: it down his throat.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: I imagine the opportunity will present
dialog: itself.
scene_heading: INT. HARVEY'S BEDROOM - SAME
text: Expansive, overlooking Central Park... if this bedroom were
text: an apartment, it’d go for $7,000 a month. Harvey leans over
text: a sleeping Lisa, the waitress from the night before and gives
text: her a kiss. She looks at the time.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Lisa, this was lovely, but it’s time to
dialog: go. I need to be in the office by 7:30.
dialog: A Legal Mind 13.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Can’t we hang out a little? I can make
dialog: you some breakfast.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: As tempting as that sounds, I’m afraid I
dialog: hate to miss a workout, and I really want
text: to get into the office before 7:30.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: That’s too bad. I was thinking maybe you
dialog: could eat it off my stomach.
text: She pulls her shirt up. Harvey takes in her fantastic body.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I guess if I skip the gym, I can still
dialog: get in by nine.
scene_heading: INT. NURSING HOME HALLWAY/MIKE’S GRANDMOTHER’S ROOM - LATER
text: Mike walks with the head physician at his grandmother's
text: nursing home, DOCTOR SHRAGER. She’s a kindly, older woman.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR SHRAGER
dialog: Your grandmother's getting worse. I need
dialog: to move her to full care, or I'll have to
dialog: transfer her to a state facility.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I won’t put her in a state facility.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR SHRAGER
dialog: Then you’1l have to come up with $10,000.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Then I will.
text: They stop outside a room. Shrager pats Mike affectionately,
text: then exits. Mike’s GRANDMOTHER (75, frail) is reading. He
text: approaches her. They hug. Mike sees her meds on the table.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I hear you’re not taking your pills.
speaker_heading: GRAMMY
dialog: Because they’re trying to poison me.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That’s nonsense. Doctor Shrager assured
dialog: me she wouldn’t poison you until January
dialog: at the earliest. She reached this year’s
dialog: quota, and if she does it before January,
dialog: she can’t count it as a 2009 poisoning.
dialog: A Legal Mind 14.
text: She eyes Mike suspiciously, then takes the pills.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Now what did I teach you?
text: She and Mike tap fists.
speaker_heading: GRAMMY
dialog: Michael, I’m worried about you. I’m not
dialog: going to be around forever, and -- I want
dialog: you to stop with that... stuff.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You... know about that?
speaker_heading: GRAMMY
dialog: I’ve got early stage Alzheimer’s, I’m not
dialog: an idiot. I know life’s been hard for
dialog: you, and you went looking for comfort.
dialog: But comfort has consequences. You’re not
dialog: a kid anymore. I want you to promise
dialog: you'll start living up to your potential.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I promise.
text: She takes her book and starts reading. Mike sees the book is
text: upside down. He tears up and walks out.
scene_heading: INT. KATHERINE’S OFFICE/HALLWAY - 9:30 AM
text: Harvey enters to see Katherine and Louis.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: 9:30. Nice of you to join us, Harvey.
dialog: And I see you're dressed like a pimp.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: My bad, Louis, I was out late after the
dialog: huge deal I closed for the firm last
dialog: night, and when I woke up, this was the
dialog: suit your wife picked out for me.
text: Harvey casually takes a sip of his coffee.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
text: Moving along. Harvey, interviews are set
text: up at the Ritz tomorrow.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: What? Why didn’t we just hire that
dialog: Harvard summer intern douche?
dialog: A Legal Mind
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: I think if you listen to the phrasing of
dialog: that question, you’1l come up with the
dialog: answer.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: What do you expect from Harvard? Book
dialog: smarts, no street smarts. We need people
text: with balls who can think on their feet,
text: not another clone with a rod up his ass.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Harvey, the fact that we only hire from
dialog: Harvard gives us a cache that’s more
text: valuable than a kid from SUNY Binghamton.
text: Harvey indicates that he can’t hear...
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Louis, if you’re going to talk out of
dialog: your ass, you have to remove the rod.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: You went to Harvard Law.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I’m an exception.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Then find another one.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Then let me skip the recruiting. I work
dialog: alone anyway.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: I would, Harvey, but all partners get an
dialog: associate. It’s just a rule.
text: Louis, caught off-guard turns to Katherine heatedly.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What? I deserve that partnership. I run
dialog: the lower level associates, my billable
dialog: hours destroy his and I am here night and
dialog: day doing whatever’s asked of me instead
dialog: of swanning in and out whenever I please.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I have to admit, he does make me sound
dialog: very swan-like.
dialog: A Legal Mind 16.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Watch it, Harvey. You’re not partner
dialog: yet, and I’ve been an attorney here two
dialog: years longer than you.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Yet the only skill you've developed is
text: kissing Katherine's ass.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Harvey, you won, shut up. Louis, this is
dialog: how it is. Now you two make nice.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Louis, I’m sorry. I was out of line with
dialog: the ass-kissing comment and I apologize.
text: Harvey holds his hand out. Louis reluctantly shakes it.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to call
dialog: your wife and tell her the man she loves
dialog: just made partner.
dialog: (off Katherine’s disapproval)
dialog: What? Too far? Come on, it’s my way of
dialog: showing there’s no hard feelings.
scene_heading: INT. NURSING HOME HALLWAY/LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Mike walks through the hallways. He dials his cell. Then:
speaker_heading: MIKE (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Trevor, I’m in. One time deal, I want
dialog: twenty-five. Take it or leave it.
scene_heading: INT. DRUG DEALER'S LIVING ROOM - NEW JERSEY - SAME
text: Trevor's with THREE WELL-DRESSED MEN holding weapons.
text: They're surrounded by briefcases filled with cash and
text: marijuana. Intercut Trevor and Mike.
speaker_heading: TREVOR (INTO PHONE)
dialog: I‘ll take it. There’s a briefcase in my
dialog: room with the stuff, pick it up tomorrow.
dialog: But you can’t take it into a luxury hotel
dialog: looking like a delivery guy. So you need
text: to shave, get a haircut and buy a suit.
speaker_heading: MIKE (INTO PHONE)
dialog: That’s a hell of a lot to ask.
speaker_heading: TREVOR (INTO PHONE)
dialog: I’m not just asking you. I’m paying you
dialog: twenty-five thousand dollars.
dialog: A Legal Mind 17.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE HARVEY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Harvey approaches his career-long secretary, DONNA. She’s in
text: her 30's, good-looking, and would take a bullet for Harvey.

speaker_heading: DONNA

speaker_heading: DEALER #2 (0.S.)
dialog: Why didn’t you tell Trevor he might be

speaker_heading: DEALER #1 (0.S.)
dialog: Same reason I don’t tell Gina I’m bangin’

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You scared the hell out of me.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Sorry. Look at you. You look great.
dialog: Tell me you decided to work with Trevor.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Trial basis. What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Wanna hear something ridiculous? My mom
dialog: is coming by my place later and I don’t
dialog: want to mess it up, so I’m hanging here.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That’s not so bad.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: That’s not the ridiculous part. After I
text: finish scouring the place for her visit,
text: I sprinkle a tee-ny bit of crumbs around.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Because I don’t want her to think I scour
dialog: the place just for her visit.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That is ridiculous.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I know. That’s what I just said.
text: Mike and Jenny share a smile. He starts out, she stops him.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: You want to look perfect your first day.
text: Jenny fixes Mike’s tie, it’s very intimate. She finishes,
text: noticing he’s staring at her. A moment, then:
speaker_heading: JENNY

speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Donna, do me a favor, give each guy a hard
dialog: time before you send him back. Then give
dialog: me a wink if they say something clever.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: What are you looking for?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I've gotta work with this guy a long
dialog: time. I’ve got to understand him, relate
dialog: to him, and trust him. Which means I’m
dialog: looking for another me.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Got it. Witty, charming, ballsy, thinks

text: A young, straight-laced applicant stands in front of Donna.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: What gives you the nerve to think we're

speaker_heading: INTERVIEWEE #1

dialog: A Legal Mind 20.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You can do this.
text: He picks up his briefcase, and heads out of the bathroom. We

text: Mike steels himself, gets on, and presses the fourth floor.
scene_heading: INT. RITZ-CARLTON - SUITE 205 OUTER ROOM - MINUTES LATER
text: Another applicant stands in front of Donna. He’s very short.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Wow. Are you sure you’re tall enough to
dialog: go on this ride?
text: He answers in an extremely high-pitched, meek voice.
speaker_heading: INTERVIEWEE #2
dialog: I don’t appreciate derogatory statements
dialog: about my physical characteristics.
text: Harvey looks out: Donna, amused, shakes her head no.
scene_heading: INT. RITZ-CARLTON ELEVATOR/HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER
text: Mike exits the elevator. He checks his watch: thirty seconds

scene_heading: FLASHBACK MIKE’S MEMORY - RITZ-CARLTON ENTRANCE EARLIER
text: We see the scene as Mike entered; the uniforms are BLUE.

scene_heading: INT. RITZ-CARLTON HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: BELLMAN

speaker_heading: SUIT
dialog: You think that’s him?
speaker_heading: BELLMAN
dialog: Matches the description. But he didn’t
dialog: go in the room.
speaker_heading: SUIT
dialog: It’s ten exactly, he’s just walking by?
speaker_heading: BELLMAN
text: It is a hotel.
speaker_heading: SUIT
dialog: And by coincidence our guy’s nowhere in

speaker_heading: BELLMAN
dialog: What do you want me to do? If our guy
dialog: shows up, you don’t look right standing
text: here without a bellman.
speaker_heading: SUIT
dialog: Go after him. Stay on the radio.

scene_heading: INT. RITZ-CARLTON STAIRWAY - SECOND FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
text: Mike lands on the stairwell, again the briefcase gets SLAMMED

scene_heading: INT. RITZ-CARLTON STAIRWAY - FOURTH FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
text: The bellman opens the stairway door. He looks down...
text: nothing. He looks up... nothing. Click. He hears the

scene_heading: INT. RITZ-CARLTON - SUITE 205 OUTER ROOM - A LITTLE LATER
text: A nervous, young-looking INTERVIEWEE #3, approaches Donna.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Kid, what's wrong with you? You look
dialog: like you're eleven years old.
speaker_heading: INTERVIEWEE #3
dialog: (extremely nervous)
dialog: I... I was late to puberty.

speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Rick Sorkin?... Rick Sorkin?
scene_heading: INT. RITZ-CARLTON HALLWAY/SUITE 205 OUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Mike tries to stop breathing heavily as he walks the hall

text: filled with men who look and are dressed exactly like him.
speaker_heading: DONNA (0.S.)
dialog: Mr. Sorkin, you’re five minutes late. Do
dialog: you have a reason I should let you in?
text: Mike looks over to see Donna. He stares at her. A beat.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I’m only here to ditch the cops. I don’t

scene_heading: INT. RITZ-CARLTON HOTEL - SUITE 205 - MOMENTS LATER
text: Mike and Harvey shake hands.
speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: HARVEY

scene_heading: INT. RITZ-CARLTON HALLWAY/SUITE 205 OUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: The bellman enters and realizes there are twenty men who look

speaker_heading: DONNA

scene_heading: INT. GERALD TATE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Gerald sits at his desk. His secretary appears at the door.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY

speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: Who the hell is Louis Litt?
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: He says he’s your lawyer.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: Send him in.
text: The secretary exits. A moment. Louis appears at the door.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Mr. Tate, I have information that I
dialog: believe will lead you to the conclusion
dialog: that you’re better served at Pearson,
dialog: Hardman with me as your lead counsel.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: Come in, have a seat.
scene_heading: INT. RITZ-CARLTON HOTEL - SUITE 205 - A LITTLE LATER
text: Harvey and Mike sit together. Harvey leans in, fascinated.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: How did you know they were the police?
dialog: A Legal Mind
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I read a novel in elementary school. The
text: cops were staking out a hotel and they
text: posed as a bellhop and a man in a suit.
dialog: It was the exact same thing.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: You read a novel in elementary school?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What? I like to read.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Why did you ask them what time it was?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: To throw them off. What drug dealer asks
text: a cop what time it is while he’s carrying
dialog: a briefcase full of pot?
text: Harvey shakes his head in awe.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
text: Now that is ballsy thinking under fire.
dialog: We should hire you. Jesus, I'd give you
dialog: the twenty-five grand as a signing bonus.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I'll take it.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Unfortunately, we only hire from Harvard.
dialog: And you not only didn’t go to Harvard Law
dialog: School, you didn’t go to any law school.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What if I told you I consume knowledge
dialog: like no one you’ve ever met, and I've
dialog: actually passed the bar?
text: Harvey looks at Mike, “I'd say you’re full of shit.”
text: points at a book sticking out of Harvey's bag.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I notice you have a Barbri Legal Handbook
dialog: with you. Open it up, read me something.
text: Harvey looks skeptical, but he opens up the book.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: “Civil liability associated with agency
dialog: is based on several factors including --”
dialog: 24.
dialog: Mike
dialog: A Legal Mind 25.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: “-~ the deviation of the agent from his
dialog: path, the reasonable inference of agency
dialog: on behalf of the plaintiff, and the
dialog: nature of the damages themselves.”
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: (looking up, stunned)
dialog: How did you do that?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I learned it when I studied for the bar.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Okay, hot shot, fire up that laptop, I’‘1l
dialog: show you what a Harvard Attorney can do.
dialog: That's my database of every legal issue
dialog: in existence. Pick one.
text: Harvey jumps up and points for Mike to sit at his laptop.
text: Mike punches the arrow key a couple times and hits enter.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Stock option backdating.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Although backdating options is legal,
dialog: violations arise related to disclosures
speaker_heading: under both FASB 123R and Internal Revenue
dialog: Code Section 409A.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You forgot The Sarbanes Oxley Act of ‘02.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: The statute of limitations renders
dialog: Sarbanes Oxley moot post 2007.
text: Mike peers closely at the screen while clicking the mouse.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Not if you can find actions to cover up
dialog: the violation, as established in the
dialog: sixth circuit, May 2008.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Impressive, but you are at a computer.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (turning the screen to Harvey)
dialog: I’ve been playing hearts: If you’re gonna
dialog: beat me, it better be at something else.
text: Harvey is stunned.
dialog: A Legal Mind 26.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: How can you know all that --
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I told you. I like to read. And once I
dialog: read something, I understand it. And
dialog: once I understand it, I never forget it.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Why take the bar?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Some dickhead bet me I couldn’t pass it
dialog: without going to law school.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: How long did he give you to study?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Four months. It was two months longer
dialog: than I needed.
text: Harvey begins to actually consider Mike’s proposition.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Do you really want this job?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: When I was in college my dream was to be
dialog: a lawyer. My grandmother needed money
dialog: and Trevor convinced me to memorize some
dialog: math test and sell it. Turns out we sold
dialog: it to the dean’s daughter. I lost my
dialog: scholarship and got thrown out of school.
text: Mike pauses, as if remembering how it felt... then:
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I got knocked into a different life, I’ve
dialog: been wishing for a way back ever since.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I had someone take a chance on me once.
dialog: But before she did, she made damn sure I
dialog: was committed to the job. I’m talking
dialog: about work. Long hours, high pressure,
dialog: no fucking around. I need an adult.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You give me this, I’1ll work as hard as it
dialog: takes to school those Harvard douches,
dialog: and be the best lawyer you’ve ever seen.
text: Harvey looks at a piece of paper he’s written something on.
dialog: A Legal Mind 27.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I’m inclined to give you a shot. But
dialog: what if I decide to go another way?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I'd say, fine. Sometimes I like to hang
dialog: out with people that aren’t that bright
dialog: just to see how the other half lives.
dialog: We see the paper says, “Thinks he’s the smartest one in the
text: room.” Harvey grins:
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Move over. I’m emailing the firm I’ve
dialog: found our next associate.
dialog: (as he types)
dialog: By the way, the bet with the dickhead,
dialog: how much was it for?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (joking)
dialog: Aaah, I can’t remember.
text: They both laugh. Harvey is finished emailing.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: All right, you start a week from Monday.
dialog: Here’s what you’re gonna do...
scene_heading: INT. MIKE’S STUDIO APARTMENT - TWO DAYS LATER
text: Mike packs a small bag with a couple of days worth of clothes
text: as the rest of their conversation continues in voice over.
speaker_heading: HARVEY (V.O.)
dialog: First off, that’s it for the pot. We
dialog: drug test. Stop now, you’ll be fine. I
dialog: assume that’s all the drugs you do.
speaker_heading: MIKE (V.O.)
dialog: (Harvey was on the money)
dialog: How do you know that?
speaker_heading: HARVEY (V.O.)
dialog: You read books, I read people. And pot
dialog: heads smoke pot. That’s what they do.
speaker_heading: MIKE (V.O.)
dialog: That’s not all I do.
text: Mike takes a tiny bag of pot and heads into the bathroom.
dialog: A Legal Mind 28.
speaker_heading: HARVEY (V.O.)
dialog: You're Albert freaking Einstein, but you
dialog: couldn’t manage to go to law school. You
dialog: think that’s not from pot?
speaker_heading: MIKE (V.O.)
dialog: Trevor got me kicked out of college. How
dialog: would I have gotten into law school?
text: Mike hesitates, then flushes the bag down the toilet.
speaker_heading: HARVEY (V.O.)
dialog: That's another thing. You’re gonna ditch
dialog: that briefcase and your boy Trevor.
text: Mike checks his cell: he’s had six missed calls from Trevor.
speaker_heading: HARVEY (V.O.)
dialog: Then you’re gonna get on a plane to
dialog: Harvard and you’re gonna learn everything
dialog: there is about going to law school there.
text: Mike pulls out the briefcase with the pot from behind the
text: couch. He shoves it to the back of his oven, puts a couple
text: pizza boxes in front to hide it, closes the oven and exits.
speaker_heading: HARVEY (V.O.)
dialog: Now get out of here. Oh, one more thing,
dialog: buy some better suits. You look like a
dialog: Bar Mitzvah boy. And not in a good way.
scene_heading: EXT. AIRPLANE - A LITTLE LATER

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Excuse me, I was wondering how to sign up
dialog: for the four o’clock law school tour?
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: You go back in time six weeks, because
text: that’s when the four o’clock booked up.
dialog: (off Mike’s look)
dialog: This is Harvard Law School, we get over
dialog: seven thousand applications a year. You

dialog: A Legal Mind 29.
scene_heading: EXT. HARVARD LAW LIBRARY - THREE FIFTY FIVE PM
text: Twenty people with name tags are in front of a sign: “Harvard

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Clifford Watkins?
scene_heading: CLIFFORD WATKINS
dialog: (air of superiority)
dialog: Can I help you?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: My name is Jonathan Atwater, I work for
text: Dean Wormer in the admissions office.
text: Clifford's attitude instantly changes.
scene_heading: CLIFFORD WATKINS
dialog: Yes, of course, what can I --
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Dean Wormer personally sent me to invite
dialog: you to an intimate cocktail hour for some
dialog: of our more... realistic candidates.
text: Clifford surveys the people around him and smiles knowingly.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: We'd like to be discreet, so if you'd be
dialog: so kind as to subtly hand me your name
dialog: tag you can proceed to the Dean’s office.
text: Clifford smiles smugly, hands Mike his name tag and exits.
text: As Mike dons Clifford’s name tag, a YOUNG WOMAN approaches.
text: As she starts the tour, Mike follows, taking in Harvard...
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Harvard Law is the oldest law school in
dialog: the country and boasts the most

scene_heading: INT. MIKE’S STUDIO APARTMENT —- FOLLOWING MONDAY
text: Close on a closet with three suits, numerous shirts and ties.

text: tie. Pullback to see that it is Mike. He lays his ensemble
text: on the couch and then heads into the shower.
scene_heading: INT. MIKE’S STUDIO APARTMENT - A LITTLE LATER
text: Mike is now out of the shower. He puts his ensemble back in
text: the closet and picks out a brown suit, blue shirt and blue
text: tie. He lays these out, then goes to shave.
scene_heading: INT. MIKE’S STUDIO APARTMENT - A LITTLE LATER
text: We are close on Mike, tying his tie in the mirror. We pull
text: back to see that he’s changed his ensemble again and is now
text: wearing a grey suit, white shirt and blue tie. He looks in
text: the mirror, likes what he sees, and heads out.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET MANHATTAN - A LITTLE LATER
text: Mike comes up from the subway with an excitement in his step
text: that only comes on the first day of a new career. His cell
text: rings, it’s Trevor again. He silences it and keeps walking.
scene_heading: INT. PEARSON, HARDMAN LAW FIRM - RECEPTION - A LITTLE LATER
text: Mike enters the lobby. As he takes in the grandeur of the

text: approaches the receptionist nervously...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Hi, I’m here to see Harvey... oh, my God,
dialog: I can’t think of his last name. I’m so
dialog: nervous, I’m not sure I know my last name.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (0.S.)
dialog: Ross. Mike Ross.
text: Mike turns to see RACHEL LANE, an attractive paralegal. He’s
text: been hit by a bolt of lightning. He stands there agog...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: We've been expecting you. I’m Rachel
dialog: Lane, paralegal. I’11 be giving you your
dialog: orientation.
text: She reaches to shake his hand. He blurts out...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Wow, you’re pretty.
dialog: A Legal Mind 31.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Good, you've hit on me. We can get it
dialog: out of the way that I’m not interested.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (sincere)
dialog: I wasn’t hitting on you. I --
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Please. I’ve given dozens of these, and
dialog: without fail, whatever new hotshot it is
dialog: thinks because I’m just a paralegal, I’‘1l
text: be blown away by his dazzling degree.
dialog: Let me assure you that I won’t.
speaker_heading: MIKE

dialog: I was. I was hitting on you.

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Now, take notes because I’m not going to

text: Rachel turns and starts walking. Mike mouths to himself:
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I love you.
text: As Mike follows we see him take in the firm. The banks of
text: offices lining the walls are fantastic. The interior walls
text: are glass, and we see right through them to stunning views of
text: downtown Manhattan. The interior of the firm is filled with
text: cubicles of secretaries, paralegals, and associates.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Each bank of offices specializes in its
dialog: own arena of the law and is anchored by
dialog: Department Heads at either end. On my
dialog: left is mergers and acquisitions, on the
dialog: opposite side is high net worth divorce.
speaker_heading: MIKE
text: Mergers across from divorce. Symmetry.
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: I‘1l just listen.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: The firm operates on a chain of command
dialog: model. Harvey’s your commanding officer.
dialog: However, Louis Litt oversees all
dialog: associates so you also answer to him.
dialog: A Legal Mind 32.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What do you think about Harvey?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: People are in awe of him, they say he’s
dialog: the best instinctive attorney anyone's
dialog: ever seen, but I have very little contact
dialog: with him, so I don’t really know.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What about Louis Litt?
text: Rachel looks at Mike, it’s clear she doesn’t think much of
text: Louis Litt, but doesn’t know Mike well enough to tell him.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Let’s get on with your tour..
scene_heading: INT. PEARSON, HARDMAN LAW FIRM - 9:30 AM
text: Harvey arrives, strutting through the halls, even cockier
text: than usual. As he passes people, he points at them, snaps
text: his fingers, and generally acts like he is king of the world.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Hey, Becky, you are glowing. I wonder
dialog: why that is? Oh, yeah, it’s the day they
dialog: announce my partnership. Nancy, have you
dialog: lost weight? Steve-o, looking...
text: Steve-o is sloppy, fat and ugly.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: ...like a guy who came to work.

speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Excuse me, why are you scratching the

speaker_heading: WORKER
dialog: I got a work order to take it off.
speaker_heading: HARVEY

text: Rachel arrives with Mike at his cubicle.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Finally, this is where you'll live.
dialog: (then, re: Mike’s note pad)
dialog: What’s wrong with you? I gave you that
dialog: for a reason, you haven’t taken one note.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That’s... because --
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Because you’ve been too busy ogling me to
dialog: listen to a word I’ve said.
text: Mike looks Rachel straight in the eye, but points at the
text: various locations around the office as he refers to them.
speaker_heading: MIKE
text: Partner's offices anchor the wings; fifth
dialog: floor’s research, sixth is security; any
dialog: work gets billed even if it’s finding an
dialog: address; I answer to Harvey and Louis
dialog: Litt and judging by how you responded to
dialog: my questions, I should admire Harvey and
dialog: fear Louis. You’ve been here five years
dialog: and just because I outrank you, I have no
dialog: authority to command your services.
dialog: (off her amazement)
dialog: Oh, it’s also clear you think you're too
dialog: smart to be a paralegal. That cover it?
text: Rachel looks at him, impressed. A beat. She covers:
dialog: A Legal Mind 34.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You know, nobody likes a show-off.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: But... you challenged me. You used the
dialog: word ogling...
text: Rachel is walking away.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Where are you going? When do I get to
dialog: see Harvey?
scene_heading: INT. KATHERINE PEARSON’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Katherine is at her desk. Harvey’s standing in front of her.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Gerald Tate fired the firm.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: What?! When?
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: An hour ago. When you were supposed to
dialog: be here.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: So you're taking my partnership away?!
text: Katherine stands up, heatedly.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Damn it, Harvey, most firms would put you
text: in front of the bar on ethics charges and
dialog: have your license stripped. You lied to
text: a client and he figured it out.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I lied to him to get him to do the right
dialog: thing and honor his goddamn contract.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Be that as it may, you didn’t get away
dialog: with it. And I can’t justify handing you
dialog: a partnership the same day you lose a
dialog: huge client.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: One client doesn’t --
dialog: A Legal Mind 35.
dialog: This just
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: One client? We’re in an economic shit
dialog: storm. Companies aren’t lining up to
dialog: spend money on attorneys right now.
text: sits there a minute.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: You know, he might have forgiven the
dialog: lying if you hadn’t humiliated him, but
dialog: you did. And you need to accept that.
text: Harvey realizes he isn’t going to change Katherine’s mind.
dialog: Katherine
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Katherine, if you hadn’t done as much for
dialog: me as you have, I'd be heading for the
dialog: door.
dialog: smiles.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: If I hadn’t done as much for you as I
dialog: have, I’d be throwing you out the window.
text: Harvey starts to leave.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: But Harvey, any shenanigans, you try to
dialog: leave and take one client, tell one more
dialog: lie... do one more thing that isn’t
text: straight as an arrow, and instead of
dialog: covering your ass, I’1l put you in front
dialog: of the bar myself.
scene_heading: INT. HARVEY'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Harvey enters, dejected. He doesn’t see Mike sitting there.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Who's ready for a great first day?!
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Mike, I’m going to have to let you go.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I just got my ass reamed for lying to a
dialog: client. If they find out I lied about
dialog: you going to Harvard Law School, they’1l
dialog: take away my license.
dialog: A Legal Mind 36.
speaker_heading: DONNA (ON INTERCOM)
dialog: You what?!
speaker_heading: HARVEY (INTO INTERCOM)
dialog: Not now, Donna.
dialog: (then, to Mike)
dialog: I have to put my own interests above
dialog: yours. It’s not personal. You're fired.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (putting it together)
dialog: So, you're worried if I stay, they might
dialog: find out you lied about me and you’1l
dialog: lose your license. But if you fire me, I
dialog: could tell them you lied about me and
dialog: you'd definitely lose your license.
dialog: 
text: This pisses Harvey off.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Are you saying if I throw you under the
dialog: bus, you’re going to drag me with you?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You put your interests above mine. I’m
dialog: just putting mine back up next to yours.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I like that. You just gave me an idea.
dialog: You're rehired.
scene_heading: INT. KATHERINE PEARSON'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Katherine is on the phone. Harvey storms in and hangs up.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Here's what’s going to happen. You’re
dialog: going to tell that workman to put the
dialog: “Partner” back on my door and that’s the
dialog: last we're going to talk about this.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: And why is that?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Because if you don’t, I'm going across
dialog: town to join Cynthia Harris. And then
dialog: I'm going to approach every client I've
dialog: ever closed, I’m going to put my charm on
dialog: them, and I’m going to take them with me.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: If you do that, you’ll force me to put
dialog: you in front of the ethics board.
dialog: A Legal Mind 37.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I don’t think you’1l put me in front of
dialog: the ethics board.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Because you were obligated to notify them
dialog: the second you knew I lied to Gerald, but
dialog: you didn’t. You put me in front of the
dialog: board now, you’ll be up there with me.
text: Katherine turns her back to Harvey in frustration. A beat.
text: We see a smile cross her face. This is her plan. She lets
text: out a deep breath and turns back to him, feigning defeat...
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: I'll give you the partnership, but you're
dialog: going to have to do something for me.
text: Harvey grins.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Anything. What do you need?
text: Katherine holds up a file.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Take on a pro bono.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Anything but that...
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Harvey, we all do it, even me. Pro bono
dialog: cases are how we as a firm show that we
dialog: care about more than just ourselves. And
dialog: it’s how you can show people in the firm
dialog: you care about more than just yourself.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I just did one.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: That was six years ago.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: You didn’t let me finish. I was going to
dialog: say I just did one six years ago.
text: Harvey holds out his hand, he’1ll take the case.
dialog: A Legal Mind 38.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: You'll handle it yourself? You won’t
dialog: pass it off to the new kid?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Absolutely.
text: Katherine hands him the file. He heads to the door.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: You want the “Partner” stenciled in bold,
dialog: or underlined, or what?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
text: Something subtle. In neon.
text: Katherine smiles as Harvey exits the room.
scene_heading: INT. HARVEY'S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER
text: Mike sits in a chair. Harvey tosses him the pro bono file.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Your first case. Donna set up a meeting
dialog: with you and the client this afternoon.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Awesome. What is it?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Pro bono. Sexual harassment. It’s
dialog: beneath me, but it’s important to
dialog: Katherine. So, don’t tell anyone I laid
dialog: it off on you and don’t screw it up...
text: Mike starts out.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Wait a second. Didn’t I tell you to get
dialog: some better suits?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What are you talking about?
dialog: (re: suit)
dialog: This is Men’s Wearhouse. I spent four
dialog: hundred dollars.
dialog: Harvey senses something’s not right.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: For how many suits?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Five. What?
dialog: A Legal Mind 39.
scene_heading: INT. DINER AT 53RD AND LEX - LATER THAT DAY
text: Mike is interviewing his client, Nancy, an attractive
text: waitress in her mid-thirties. They sit in a booth.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Please, Nancy, take me through the story
dialog: as you see it.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: It started two years ago. I was a proud
dialog: stay-at-home mother to our son, Freddie.
dialog: One day, after little league...
text: She smiles, reminiscing...
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Freddie was seven. Hated that he
dialog: couldn't play with the older kids...
text: Nancy gets serious again...
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: We came home to find my husband on the
dialog: floor of our bathroom. He died of a
dialog: heart attack. Just like that...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I’m so sorry.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I was devastated, but I didn’t have the
dialog: time - I didn’t have the luxury to grieve.
dialog: So, I did the best I could, I got myself a
text: job as a secretary at Devlin McGreggor.
text: Nancy becomes upbeat again as she remembers...
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I felt good about providing for me and
dialog: Freddie, I even got promoted to secretary
dialog: of the President, Charles Hunt.
dialog: (then)
dialog: That’s when everything changed.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Tell me what happened.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: He started asking me to stay late, have
dialog: drinks, go to dinner...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Did you?
dialog: A Legal Mind 40.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: At first I thought it was for work, so,
dialog: yes. But it started to not feel right,
dialog: so I just did my job and went home. One
dialog: night, Mr. Hunt called me into his office
dialog: and told me if I slept with him, he’d
dialog: take care of me within the firm, and if I
dialog: didn’t... he said he would fire me.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Did he use those exact words? Was he
dialog: that explicit?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: No. He’s not stupid. But neither am I.
dialog: And we both knew exactly what he meant.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What did you do?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I went to human resources. They said
dialog: they investigated and found nothing to
dialog: support my claim. Two months later I was
dialog: fired for poor job performance. I was
dialog: told to clean out my desk immediately.
text: She seems to be living it in her mind...
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: They wouldn’t let me say good-bye to
dialog: anyone. They wouldn’t give me a letter
dialog: of recommendation... they wouldn’t even
dialog: allow me to get unemployment benefits.
text: Mike looks like he wants to kill Mr. Charles Hunt.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I wasn’t looking for a payoff. All I
dialog: wanted was for it to stop. I feel so
dialog: violated. Can you help me?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: There’s some good news and some bad news.
dialog: The bad news is, as you said, he’s not
dialog: stupid and it’s going to be hard to prove
dialog: he propositioned you without a witness.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: What’s the good news?
dialog: A Legal Mind 4l.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That’s not what we have to prove. The
dialog: biggest exposure employers have isn’t the
dialog: harassment itself, it’s the retaliation.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: What do you mean?
text: Mike takes a sip of his coffee.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Your complaint is on record. Two months
dialog: later you got fired for poor performance.
dialog: All we have to prove is your performance
dialog: stayed consistent, and we’ve got them.
text: Nancy’s face falls.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What’s the matter?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: After what he said to me in that room --
dialog: I was under a lot of stress. It affected
dialog: me. I couldn’t sleep. I couldn’t keep
dialog: concentrate... my performance was poor.
text: Mike looks at her and smiles bravely...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Then we’re going to have to prove what he
dialog: said to you in that room.
scene_heading: INT. HARVEY'S OFFICE - LATER THAT AFTERNOON
text: Mike is updating Harvey on the case.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: You need my help? Give me an update.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You know, she’s a nice woman. She --
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Not on the client. On the case. I don’t
dialog: get emotionally attached to the clients.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: This woman's had her entire life ripped
dialog: apart. You don’t care?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I’m not about caring. I’m about winning.
dialog: A Legal Mind 42.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Why can’t you be about both?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I'd explain it to you, but then I'd have
dialog: to care about you, now give me an update.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Defense sent over the original files from
dialog: the investigation as a courtesy, but I --
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: No they didn’t. Nobody does anything as
dialog: a courtesy. They sent over those files
dialog: because that’s where they want you to
dialog: look. Listen to me, being a lawyer is
dialog: like being a doctor.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You mean how you don’t get emotional
dialog: about the client?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: No. I mean, you keep pressing until it
dialog: hurts, then you know where to look.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Forget about impeaching the investigation
dialog: - it won't lead anywhere. No employee is
text: going to testify against his own CEO.
text: Mike smiles at this...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What would you suggest I do?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Think. If this guy’s done this once...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: He’s done it before.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: And if people who work for him now won’t
dialog: testify against him...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: People who used to work for him might.
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: If I can find someone else he’s done it
dialog: to, I’ve got corroboration, and I’ve got
text: him nailed.
dialog: A Legal Mind 43.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I’d subpoena the personnel records of
dialog: every woman who’s left the firm during
dialog: this guy’s tenure.
text: Mike smiles as he holds up a subpoena.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That’s exactly what I thought.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Then what do you need my help for?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I... don’t know how to fill out a
dialog: subpoena.
text: Harvey smiles and shakes his head. His boy is working out.
speaker_heading: HARVEY (INTO INTERCOM)
dialog: Donna, I need you to show Mike how to
text: fill out a subpoena.
speaker_heading: DONNA (ON INTERCOM)
dialog: No problem. After that you want me to
dialog: show him how to wipe his ass?
text: Harvey smiles, then looks at Mike.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: It’s funny, because you should already
dialog: know how to do both those things.
text: Harvey slides a card across his desk to Mike.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What’s this?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: It’s my suit guy. Go in, tell him I sent
dialog: you, and spend some goddamn money.
text: Mike looks at the card.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What does it matter how much money I
dialog: spend on suits?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Because we're in the business of
dialog: convincing people to do what we want.
dialog: And like it or not, people respond to how
dialog: you're dressed.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: A Legal Mind
speaker_heading: HARVEY (CONT'D)
dialog: So if you want to be treated like you
dialog: belong at this level, this is what you’re
dialog: going to have to do.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Hey, you’re giving me advice. It sounds
dialog: like you actually care about me.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: What I want you to understand is that
dialog: you're a reflection of me. And as I told
dialog: you before, I damn sure care about me.
scene_heading: INT. MIKE’S CUBICLE - A LITTLE LATER
text: Rachel approaches Mike as he puts his jacket on to leave...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: It’s six o’clock. I’m going home.
text: Rachel laughs.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What’s so funny?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You're a rookie associate. If you go
dialog: home before nine on your first week, you
dialog: won’t make it through your first month.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Louis Litt wants to see you.
text: Mike gets up to go see Louis. He hesitates, then:
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Do you think this suit makes me look like
dialog: a Bar Mitzvah boy?
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS’S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER
text: Louis is at his desk. Mike sits across from him.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I know you had orientation from Rachel,
dialog: but I'd like to give you a special welcome
dialog: from me. Among other things, I’m sort of
dialog: the disciplinarian of the associates.
text: An associate, GARY appears at the door and addresses Louis.
dialog: A Legal Mind 45.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: You wanted to see me?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Yes, please. Come on in, Gary. Mike,
dialog: this is Gary Lipsky. Gary’s one of our
dialog: promising associates from last year.
text: Mike and Gary shake hands.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Gary, Mr. Pearson wanted me to ask if
dialog: you've completed the Petramco filing.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: My brother was in over the weekend...
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: This is third time I’ve asked you.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I‘1l get right on it.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Don’t bother. You’re fired.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: What?! You can’t --
text: Louis stands up.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I can. And I did. Go pack your things,
dialog: and don’t ever show your face here again.
text: Gary exits the office, stunned... Louis turns to Mike.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I arranged for you to see that because we
dialog: pay our associates very well and provide
dialog: the opportunity of unlimited advancement.
dialog: But in return we expect results. Have I
dialog: made myself clear?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Welcome to Pearson, Hardman.
text: Louis then reads a file as though Mike isn’t there. A beat.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Feel free to go back to work.

scene_heading: INT. HARVEY'S OFFICE - LATER
text: Harvey exits for the night. He runs into Katherine...
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Harvey. How’s the new kid doing?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Pretty good.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: What do you have him working on?
text: Harvey doesn’t want to tell her he dropped the case on Mike.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: This and that. Various matters.
text: Katherine looks at Harvey curiously...
scene_heading: INT. MIKE’S STUDIO APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Mike comes home to find Trevor on his couch, watching TV.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What the hell are you doing here?
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: Watching Sportscenter. Boo-yah.
text: Trevor gives Mike a big smile. Nothing. He gets serious.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: You won’t return my calls.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah, because you set me up.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: You think I knew about that?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Here we go, round fifty of I get shafted,
dialog: because you didn’t know the whole story.
text: Now Trevor tries righteousness.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: Hey, you knew there were risks when you
dialog: quoted that shit from that book. You
dialog: knew it, you needed the money, and I came
dialog: through with an opportunity like always.
text: Trevor realizes this tack won't work. He goes for sympathy.
dialog: 46.
dialog: A Legal Mind 47.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: You know, you’re not the only one who got
text: screwed. They held a gun on me.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Oh, really? Why did they do that?
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: To keep me from warning you.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: So you did know.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: Not until after it was too late.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Well it’s damn sure too late now.
text: Mike holds the door open for Trevor to leave.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: Let me make it up to you.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You want to make it up? Give me my key.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: (giving key, cajoling)
dialog: Mike, come on, you know I don’t want to
dialog: live in a world where we’re not tight.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Then kill yourself. Now get the hell out.
text: Trevor exits. Mike checks for the briefcase. It’s there.

speaker_heading: END OF ACT THREE
dialog: A Legal Mind 48.
speaker_heading: ACT FOUR
scene_heading: INT. MIKE’S CUBICLE - NEXT AFTERNOON
text: Mike opens an envelope, reads it and quickly heads off...
scene_heading: INT. HARVEY'S OFFICE/HALLWAY - LATER THAT AFTERNOON
text: Harvey leaves his office and passes Donna on the way out.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Donna, I need the --
text: She instantly hands him an envelope clearly full of cash.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Oh, also I didn’t get a chance to --
text: She gives him a coffee to go. A beat.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Marry me.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: I took care of that too. We’ve been
dialog: married for the last seven years.
text: Harvey smiles and heads out. Mike approaches, concerned.
speaker_heading: MIKE
text: The company’s fighting the subpoena.
dialog: They filed a motion to dismiss the case
dialog: based on our lack of evidence.
text: Harvey doesn’t stop walking.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Good.
text: Mike stands there a beat, then walks after Harvey.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Good. What do you mean good?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: They don’t want to hand over the files.
dialog: You pressed where it hurt. You’re
text: looking in the right place.
text: Mike catches up. They keep walking to the elevators.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Did you think they wouldn’t fight back?
dialog: A Legal Mind 49.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Well... I... now that you mention it.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: It's my fault. I keep forgetting you
dialog: don’t actually know anything. The idea
dialog: is you make a move, they make a move and
dialog: back and forth til one of you wins.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: But what if they win the motion and the
dialog: case gets dismissed?
text: Harvey arrives at the elevators and presses the down button.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Then you’re not as good as you think you
dialog: are.
text: The elevator door opens. Katherine is in it. She stays in
text: as the rest of the people file out...
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: What a coincidence. I was just wondering
dialog: how it’s going with the pro bono case.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Fantastic, I’m all over it.
text: Katherine is now alone in the elevator. Harvey gets on.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: That makes me happy. Because if I were
dialog: to find out you weren't giving it your
dialog: full effort, I would be very upset...
text: Concern registers on Harvey's face as the door closes. Mike
text: turns to go back to his cubicle. He sees Rachel, catches up
text: to her and follows her through the halls back to her office.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I need your help. There’s a hearing on
dialog: my subpoena.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I’ve got three other cases ahead of
dialog: yours, so you’ll have to wait in line.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: But my hearing is tomorrow.
text: She stops outside of her office and turns to Mike.
dialog: A Legal Mind 50.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Why are you coming to me?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Because Donna says you’re the best
dialog: researcher in the firm.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Let me see the motion.
text: Mike hands it to her. She reads it as they enter her office.
scene_heading: INT. RACHEL’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Mike sees Rachel’s office is much nicer than his cubicle.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Wait. You have an office? Why do you
dialog: have an office and I only have a cubicle?
text: Rachel smiles.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Like you said, I’m the best researcher in
dialog: the firm.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Really? I just made that up. I didn’t
dialog: even have time to talk to Donna.
text: Mike smiles. Rachel isn’t amused.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Is this all a joke to you? Because I
dialog: take my job seriously.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I’m sorry, I was just -- I care about
dialog: this woman. She’s got nowhere else to
dialog: turn and -- I can’t help her by myself.
text: Rachel looks at Mike and sees he’s sincere. He puts his
text: hands up to his head as though they are dog ears and then
text: flaps one of them over. Rachel breaks into a smile.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I get it. You’re a puppy. Do mea
dialog: favor, don’t poop on my laptop.
text: Rachel looks back down at the file, then back at Mike:
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You're asking to look at private files
dialog: without any evidence of your assertion.
dialog: A Legal Mind 51.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: But the only way we can find the evidence
dialog: is by looking at those files.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: That's a rickety argument.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: But is there precedent?
text: She sees a stack of files in her in-box, then looks at Mike.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Let’s go see if we can find one.
scene_heading: INT. PEARSON, HARDMAN LIBRARY - A LITTLE LATER
text: Mike and Rachel enter a miniature version of the Harvard Law
text: library. Highly sophisticated, well stocked and beautiful.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Research is as much art as science, we’ll
dialog: look at privacy and harassment law and
dialog: see if we can find a combination of cases
dialog: to make an argument. I/’11 take privacy.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I’ll take harassment law...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: This’ll take a while. We need dinner.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Chinese?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I can afford Chinese myself. This is on
dialog: the firm, I want sushi.
text: We see a montage of them reading books, journals, etc... They
text: show each other what they’ve found and shake their heads, it
text: won't work. Dinner comes... as they finish their sushi.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Remember when I said you thought you were
dialog: too smart to be a paralegal?... Why --
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: -- aren’t I a lawyer?
text: Rachel looks at Mike and decides to reveal her vulnerability.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I don’t test well.
dialog: A Legal Mind 52.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I’m smart, I know I’d be a good lawyer,
dialog: but... I can’t take tests. I don’t know
dialog: what happens to me. I bombed the LSAT’s.
dialog: Even if I could get into a law school,
dialog: there’s no way I’d ever pass the bar.
dialog: (wistfully)
dialog: If only there were some way to have
dialog: someone take the tests for me.
text: Mike laughs.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah, if only there were.
text: Harvey walks in and sees them smiling at each other.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Where are you on the research for
dialog: tomorrow's hearing?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Nothing yet.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: You say you care about the client. But
dialog: if you keep playing footsie with the
dialog: paralegal instead of finding me a valid
dialog: argument, the client’s going to lose.
text: Harvey exits. We resume the montage of Mike and Rachel
text: working. Again, nothing is working. More frustration.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: It’s no use. They did an investigation
dialog: and they did it by the book. It produced
dialog: no evidence, and we look like the bad
text: guys coming in putting them under duress.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Wait a second, what did you say?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I said we look like the bad guys.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: No. You said they did it by the book,
dialog: and we’re putting them under duress.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: So?
dialog: A Legal Mind 53.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: They didn’t do it by the book. The
dialog: investigation was done under duress...
text: Mike picks up one of the books and shows it to Rachel...
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP RESTAURANT - A LITTLE LATER
text: Harvey eats with VANESSA, a gorgeous woman in a killer dress.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: So, we get there and my client decides
dialog: it’ll be funny to introduce me to his
text: pastor as a recovering sex addict.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: What did you do?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
text: I hold out my hand to the pastor and go,
dialog: “Who said anything about recovering?”
text: Vanessa laughs. They share a moment... then:
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: I believe you have something for me?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: That’s what I love about you, Vanessa.
dialog: Business over pleasure.
text: Harvey puts the envelope of cash Donna gave him on the table.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: By the way, that dress... damn.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: This old thing? It was my father’s.
text: Vanessa counts the money in the envelope and puts it away.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Vanessa, how come you and I never...
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Because I don’t sleep around. And I
dialog: could never have a relationship with you.
dialog: All you ever think about is yourself.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: That’s ridiculous. I’m thinking about
dialog: you and me right now.
text: Vanessa smiles and shakes her head as she gets up to leave.
dialog: A Legal Mind 54.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: By the way, I’m not selfish everywhere.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Neither am I. But you’ll never know it.
text: Vanessa hands Harvey a manila folder and heads off. Harvey
text: watches her go, then looks opens the folder and looks inside.
scene_heading: INT. HARVEY'S OFFICE - NEXT MORNING
text: Mike stands as Harvey peruses his handiwork.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: This is good. We’re gonna have some fun.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Did... you say we?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: You didn’t think I was going to let you
dialog: come along?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Good instinct, I wasn’t. Then I thought
dialog: it would be cruel not to let you witness
dialog: my greatness.
text: Mike smiles.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You're a true giver.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - NEXT DAY
text: Harvey, Mike and DEFENSE COUNSEL are arguing the motion to
text: dismiss in front of a JUDGE, BAILIFF and STENOGRAPHER...
speaker_heading: DEFENSE COUNSEL
dialog: Your honor, this case should be thrown
dialog: out. Other than her story, plaintiff
text: doesn't have one piece of evidence.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Because the evidence lies within their
dialog: personnel files, which they’re
text: conveniently refusing to hand over.
dialog: A Legal Mind 55.
speaker_heading: DEFENSE COUNSEL
dialog: Those files have sensitive information.
dialog: He's fishing at the expense of our
dialog: employees’ right to privacy.
text: Harvey scoffs.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Please, he doesn't give a rat's ass about
dialog: his employees' right to privacy.
speaker_heading: DEFENSE COUNSEL
dialog: Your honor, Mr. Specter’s claim that we
dialog: don’t care about our employees, though
dialog: witty, carries no weight as a rule of law.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: True. But what does carry weight is that
dialog: under Article Seven of the statute, the
dialog: investigation of sexual harassment must
dialog: be conducted without any duress.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Your point?
text: Harvey walks the courtroom with ease as he makes his case.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Both the investigator and every person
dialog: interviewed answers to the CEO they're
dialog: investigating. That is the definition of
dialog: duress. It’d be like your bailiff accused
dialog: you of sexual harassment, and you assigned
dialog: your stenographer to investigate. How
dialog: likely do you think it would be that the
dialog: investigation yielded any fruit?
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: You honestly think I would harass Herman?
text: Harvey looks at the bailiff, a slovenly, fifty year old man.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I don’t know, your honor. Some people
dialog: have a thing for the uniform..
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: I'd like to think Herman would come to me
dialog: before it got to an investigation.
text: Harvey glances at Herman. Herman shakes his head no.
speaker_heading: DEFENSE COUNSEL
dialog: I saw that. That should be stricken.
dialog: A Legal Mind 56.
text: Harvey smiles, then continues to the Judge.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: And what if Herman did come to you, your
dialog: honor? And you betrayed his trust by
dialog: firing him under false pretenses?
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: You really think that little of me?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I wouldn’t trust you as far as I could
dialog: throw you, your honor.
text: They share a smile.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Your point is taken.
speaker_heading: DEFENSE COUNSEL
dialog: Your honor --
speaker_heading: JUDGE
text: Hand over the files.
text: Mike beams with their victory. The Judge addresses Harvey.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: But this doesn't go on forever. You've
dialog: got one week to show me evidence backing
dialog: up your claim or I'm dismissing the suit.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: But, your honor --
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: That's it, I’ve made my ruling, now Herman
dialog: and I have some communicating to do.
text: Mike turns to Harvey.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That was awesome.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: It was your argument. I just framed it
dialog: in a way that humanized the situation and
dialog: brightened all of our afternoons.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I feel like Michael Corleone in that
text: scene where the fat guy teaches him how
text: to shoot the gun.
dialog: A Legal Mind 57.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Are you saying I’m the fat guy?
dialog: (then)
dialog: I am not the fat guy.
scene_heading: INT. UPSCALE MENS STORE - LATER THAT AFTERNOON
text: Mike walks into a world he never knew existed. The world’s
text: finest suits are on display. He approaches RENE, who looks
text: him up and down in a condescending manner.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Excuse me, I’m looking for Rene.
speaker_heading: RENE
dialog: I’m Rene. When’s the Bar Mitzvah?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Did Harvey tell you I was coming here?
text: Rene looks at him with newfound respect.
speaker_heading: RENE
dialog: Harvey Specter sent you? That’s another
dialog: story. Do you know your inseam?
text: Mike is amused at the notion that he would know his inseam.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: No, I don’t.
speaker_heading: RENE
dialog: My lucky day. Why don’t you browse for a
text: minute. The suits are arranged by price.
dialog: Starting with the least expensive here
dialog: and moving up in price as you go back.
text: Rene exits. Mike picks up an “inexpensive” suit. He sees
text: the price: $2,000. He puts it back and walks out the door.
scene_heading: EXT. MANHATTAN STREET —- CONTINUOUS
text: Mike exits quickly. He sees Rene prancing toward the front
text: window holding ten thousand dollars of clothing. Mike smiles
text: to himself at his getaway. His cell phone rings, he answers.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Mike, it’s Jenny.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Trevor's having you do his dirty work?
dialog: A Legal Mind 58.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Trevor doesn’t even know I’m calling you.
dialog: And all I know is that you're not talking
dialog: to each other and I miss you and I want
dialog: things to go back to the way they were.
text: This stops Mike short.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I miss you too. But I don’t think things
dialog: are ever going back the way they were.
text: Mike hangs up the phone.
scene_heading: INT. TREVOR STEVENS’ CONDOMINIUM
text: We see that Jenny is sitting there with Trevor.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: What did he say?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: He said things aren’t ever going back the
dialog: way they were. What did you do?
text: A beat. Trevor lies.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: I don’t know.
scene_heading: INT. RACHEL’S OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER
text: Rachel is at her desk. Mike enters.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: The files are on their way. We have a
text: week to corroborate Nancy’s story.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: We won?! That’s fantastic!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I couldn't have done it without you.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Damn right, you couldn’t have. You didn’t
dialog: even know where to look without me.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You know, nobody likes a show-off.
text: Rachel smiles. Her intercom buzzes, she listens, then:
dialog: A Legal Mind 59.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
text: The files are in conference room C.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Why didn’t they bring them to my cubicle?
scene_heading: INT. AUXILIARY CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
text: Mike shows up. The conference room is filled with boxes upon
text: boxes. Mike looks at them all as Harvey approaches.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: They know you only have a week to find
dialog: whoever it is you’re looking for.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: They're fighting back.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: They're trying to bury you in paperwork.
text: Mike looks at Harvey with confidence.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: They picked the wrong guy.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: That’s what I like to hear. Now excuse
dialog: me, I have to go charm a new client.
scene_heading: INT. JOHN DOCKERY’S OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER
text: John Dockery, CEO of Dockery Chemical shakes Harvey’s hand.
speaker_heading: DOCKERY
dialog: Nice to finally meet you. Katherine says
dialog: you're going to sweep me off my feet.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I’ll do my best, Mr. Dockery.
text: Harvey hands him the manila folder from Vanessa, he opens it.
speaker_heading: DOCKERY
dialog: What the hell is this?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Looks to me like it’s you having sex with
text: a woman who isn’t Mrs. Dockery.
speaker_heading: DOCKERY
dialog: Are you trying to blackmail me?!
dialog: A Legal Mind 60.
dialog: A beat:
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: No, I’m not. You asked my firm to see
dialog: where you’re vulnerable to corporate take-
dialog: over. This is where you’re vulnerable.
speaker_heading: DOCKERY
dialog: What are you --
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Your wife owns fifteen percent of the
dialog: voting shares of your company. As far as
dialog: I can tell, you've been seeing this woman
text: and several others for quite some time.
dialog: How do you think your wife’s going to
dialog: vote her shares after she finds out?
speaker_heading: DOCKERY
dialog: Who says she has to find out?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Mr. Dockery, my investigator was able to
dialog: obtain these pictures in a week. What do
dialog: you think a motivated competitor of yours
dialog: will be able to dig up in a year?
text: This lands on Dockery. Harvey pours two glasses of water.
speaker_heading: HARVEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I have a simple solution. Trade her your
dialog: preferred shares, which have no voting
dialog: rights for her common shares, which do.
speaker_heading: DOCKERY
dialog: The preferred shares are worth two
dialog: million dollars more.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: A fraction of what you’ll lose if you get
dialog: voted out of your company.
text: Harvey offers a glass to Dockery. A beat.
speaker_heading: DOCKERY
dialog: You looking down your nose at me?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: John, please, I don’t care if you sleep
text: with the entire Knick’s dancers. Just
dialog: give her the preferred shares.
text: Harvey smiles. Dockery takes the glass.
dialog: A Legal Mind 61.
speaker_heading: DOCKERY
dialog: Katherine said you were going to charm me
dialog: to get my business.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I’m not interested in getting your
dialog: business. I’m interested in keeping it.
text: Harvey and Dockery share a drink.
scene_heading: INT. HARVEY'S OFFICE - NEXT EVENING
text: Mike enters. He’s been up all night and all the next day.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I know where they don’t want us to look.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: You got through those files by yourself
dialog: in a day and a half?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I would have done it faster, but I
dialog: ordered a pizza. Have you tried that
dialog: Papa John’s crazy bread? It’s fantastic.
dialog: (off look, coming clean)
dialog: Rachel helped me. Half the files were
dialog: men. Another chunk were women over
dialog: sixty. I read the rest.
text: Harvey smiles at Mike trying to pull one over on him.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Come on, it’s still impressive!
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: What did you find?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: We pieced together from the records there
dialog: was a dismissal on March 12, 2002. But
text: the file containing the employee name is
dialog: missing. That’s our woman, I know it.
dialog: I’m moving to slap monetary sanctions on
dialog: their attorney, possible jail time...
dialog: this guy isn’t gonna know what hit him.
text: A beat. Harvey dials his phone. It rings on speaker.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Phil, it’s Harvey Specter. Did you have
dialog: anything to do with the March 12th, 2002
dialog: files being left out of discovery?
dialog: A Legal Mind 62.
speaker_heading: PHIL (ON SPEAKER)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: If the file is here by noon, I'll believe
dialog: you, if not we’re filing for sanctions...
text: Harvey hangs up the phone and looks at Mike.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Threat of sanctions is better than filing
dialog: for sanctions.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That’s what I meant. I was going to
dialog: threaten him. Not file. I meant that.
scene_heading: INT. DINER - LATER THAT DAY
text: Mike sits with Nancy again...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Nancy, did you know, or have you ever
dialog: heard of a woman named Joanna Webster?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: No. Not that I can think of. Why?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: The company tried to hide her existence
dialog: from us. Her records show she met with
dialog: personnel over “work related issues,” in
dialog: 2002, then was let go two months later.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: You think Hunt did the same thing to her
dialog: that he did to me?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yes, I do.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Then get her to come forward and say so.
text: Mike knows that’s not going to be easy.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER THAT EVENING
text: Mike knocks on the door of an apartment. A woman, JOANNA
text: WEBSTER answers, she looks surprisingly similar to Nancy.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Can I help you?
dialog: A Legal Mind
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Joanna Webster, my name is Mike Ross, I’m
dialog: a lawyer. I have some questions about
dialog: your time at Devlin McGreggor.
text: Joanna hesitates.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Please, just let me tell you a story
dialog: about my client, Nancy Johnson...
scene_heading: INT. JOANNA’S LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER
text: Mike and Joanna sit, he’s clearly just told her about Nancy.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: That sounds about the same as what
dialog: happened to me. But --
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Please, all I need you to do is tell your
dialog: story. If you corroborate Nancy’s --
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Mr. Ross, what happened to me, happened
dialog: seven years ago. It was violating and
dialog: horrible and there was a reason I didn’t
dialog: do anything about it. I know what they
dialog: do. They’1ll put me on that stand and
dialog: attack me and I don’t want that.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Joanna, this man is a predator. He did
dialog: it to you, he did it to Nancy, and if you
dialog: don’t help stop him, he’1ll do it again.
text: Mike takes her hand.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I'll be with you every step of the way.
dialog: All you have to do is give a deposition
dialog: tomorrow, and then testify again on
text: Friday in front of the judge.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: I’m sorry, I can’t do it.
text: Mike’s face falls...
scene_heading: INT. HARVEY'S OFFICE - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Harvey is working late at his desk. Mike enters and slumps
text: into a chair, completely dejected...
dialog: A Legal Mind 64.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: What happened with the witness?
text: Mike becomes instantly excited:
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I got her to testify! You should've seen
dialog: me. I threw everything at her. Told her
dialog: if she didn’t stop him he’d do it again,
dialog: I'd be with her every step of the way...
text: Mike holds out his arms to Harvey in amazement.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: It didn’t work! I was done. I had
dialog: nothing. Then it hit me, I asked her
dialog: what if it was her daughter she was
dialog: testifying for... she melted. I used
text: empathy to get her to testify.
dialog: (starts singing)
dialog: Testify. Testify. She’s gonna testify.
text: Harvey looks at Mike:
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Well, I’m glad to see the fact that you
dialog: were up all night didn’t make you giddy.
dialog: (smiles, then)
dialog: Now go get some sleep. I don’t want you
text: singing during tomorrow’s deposition.
text: Mike leaves. Harvey smiles to himself as Katherine enters...
text: A moment.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Harvey, how’s it going with the pro bono?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I just talked a witness into testifying.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Really? What’s the witness’s name?
text: Harvey has no idea of the answer. He’s caught...
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: I’m not an idiot. Don’t treat me like
dialog: one. You pawned off the case.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I’m sorry you feel that way, but --
dialog: A Legal Mind
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Damn it Harvey, I told you this was a way
dialog: for you to show that you thought about
dialog: more than just yourself.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I’ve got higher profile cases that --
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Need I remind you when we met, you were a
dialog: 28 year old screw up? I gave you a shot
dialog: at the mail room, led you up the ranks to
dialog: paralegal, then paid for you to go to
dialog: Harvard Law. Where by the way you fucked
dialog: off the whole time and I still hired you.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: And you've benefitted from that ever
dialog: since. I closed Dockery for you
dialog: yesterday and I can’t make time to --
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: You made a promise to me! You made a
dialog: promise, you broke it, and then you lied
dialog: to my face. So, let me be clear, this
dialog: isn’t professional, this is personal.
dialog: And I‘1l tell you something else, you
dialog: made your bed, you better goddamn win.
text: Katherine leaves. Harvey realizes he let his mentor down...
scene_heading: INT. MIKE’S STUDIO APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

dialog: What the hell is wrong with you?
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: I need you to give me that briefcase
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: So that’s what this has all been about.
dialog: You don’t care about our friendship. You
dialog: just wanted the briefcase back.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: That’s not true. You’re my oldest friend
dialog: and you know it. But you don’t seem to
dialog: care about that anymore, so, yes, I also
dialog: need the briefcase back.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That’s too bad, because I don’t have it.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: Who throws something like that away?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I do. And by the way, I thought I had
dialog: you give me my key back.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: You think I wouldn’t have made a backup?
dialog: Mike, come on, why are you playing games?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I told you. I don’t have it. I ditched
dialog: it while I was running away from the cops
dialog: you sent me into.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: I don’t believe you. You can’t --

scene_heading: INT. PEARSON, HARDMAN LAW FIRM - LAW FIRM
text: Mike exits the elevator. As he passes the receptionist...
speaker_heading: LOUIS (0.S.)
dialog: Mike, hold it right there.

speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Where do you think you’re going?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: To my cubicle.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: No, you're not. It’s pee in a cup time.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Drug test. Follow me.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: No problem.
text: Mike hesitates. He looks down at his briefcase.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I’m just gonna put my things back at my --
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Now.
text: Louis starts walking. Mike isn’t sure what to do. A beat.
text: Mike follows Louis to the elevator.
scene_heading: INT. PEARSON, HARDMAN LAW FIRM - ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

dialog: floor of the firm.
scene_heading: INT. PEARSON, HARDMAN —- HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Mike nervously follows Louis into the bowels of the firm.
text: Their feet click as they make their way down the hall.
dialog: A Legal Mind
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: By the way, my cousin was your year at
dialog: Harvard. It’s funny. I asked if he
dialog: remembered you. He didn’t.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What’s his name?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Mitch Samberg.
text: Another beat.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Didn’t know him... big school.

speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Time to face the music.
scene_heading: INT. DONNA’S DESK - SAME
text: Harvey approaches Donna. He’s a little anxious.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
text: Donna, they’re on the way for Mike’s

speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: I don’t know.
text: Harvey nervously paces back to his office.
scene_heading: INT. DRUG TESTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Mike and Louis enter. The room looks like the examination
text: room in a doctor’s office. There is a technician there, who
text: hands Mike a plastic cup and indicates a bathroom.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
text: Leave the cup on the counter.
text: Mike leaves the room: The technician points at his briefcase.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: You'll have to leave that out here.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Why?

dialog: A Legal Mind 69.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: If you take it in there with you, I have

speaker_heading: HARVEY (0.S.)

text: Mike is startled again. He turns to see Harvey.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I was being drug tested. Why?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: The deposition’s this afternoon. I’m
dialog: going to handle it. I want you to dig
dialog: into this woman's background and find

text: are all there. Joanna takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: I'd been working for Mr. Hunt six months
dialog: when he started asking me to work late,
dialog: order dinner... One night, late, he...
dialog: tried to sleep with me. The next day, I
dialog: went to HR to request a change of
dialog: assignment. And two months later I was
dialog: fired for having a bad attitude.
dialog: Defense Counsel starts in...
dialog: A Legal Mind 70.
speaker_heading: DEFENSE COUNSEL
dialog: Ms. Webster, after working for Devlin
dialog: McGreggor, you went on to waitress at
dialog: Hooters, did you not?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Yes, I did.
speaker_heading: DEFENSE COUNSEL
text: A place that advertises the sexuality of
dialog: its waitresses to get business?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: You'll have to ask them that.
speaker_heading: DEFENSE COUNSEL
dialog: I'm asking you.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
text: And she’s not answering. It has no
dialog: relevance. Let’s move on.
text: Mike looks at Joanna reassuringly.
speaker_heading: DEFENSE COUNSEL
dialog: Ms. Webster, are you a truthful person?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DEFENSE COUNSEL
dialog: When you said earlier that you’d never
dialog: been arrested for a crime, were you
dialog: telling the truth then?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Yes.
text: Defense counsel holds up a folder.
speaker_heading: DEFENSE COUNSEL
dialog: In 1999 you weren’t arrested for stealing
dialog: a thousand dollars worth of jewelry from
dialog: the Willow Grove mall in Pennsylvania?
text: Joanna's face falls. Mike looks at Harvey, “Oh, shit.”
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: I was seventeen. It was one mistake.
dialog: Those records were supposed to be sealed.
dialog: A Legal Mind 71.
speaker_heading: DEFENSE COUNSEL
dialog: So, when you say those records were
dialog: sealed, what you mean is that you thought
dialog: you could get away with a lie?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: No, that’s not it. I knew you would
dialog: twist it around and make it seem
dialog: different that it is.
speaker_heading: DEFENSE COUNSEL
dialog: You've been arrested in your past. Then
dialog: you lied about it under oath. Is that
dialog: making it seem different than what it is?
text: Joanna looks at Mike and Harvey. They can’t help her.
speaker_heading: DEFENSE COUNSEL
dialog: No answer? Then I ask this, since you
dialog: lied here once, what’s to make us believe
dialog: you’re not lying about Mr. Hunt?
text: Joanna runs out of the room. Mike looks at Harvey.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Fix it.
text: Mike runs out after Joanna.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE OF PEARSON, HARDMAN - MINUTES LATER
text: Mike runs up to Joanna, who keeps walking...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Joanna, wait...
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: This is why I didn’t want to testify.
dialog: They twist some thing from a hundred
dialog: years ago and make me look like a liar.
text: She turns to Mike.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: They make it sound like what he did to me
dialog: didn’t happen.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Look, I know it was hard. But it doesn’t
dialog: matter what happened in there. I need
dialog: you to have the courage to give testimony
dialog: to the Judge on Friday to keep this case
dialog: alive. I don’t have time to find someone
dialog: else between now and then...
dialog: A Legal Mind 72.
text: She looks at him, then starts walking again...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Wait --
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: No. I’m not waiting. You promised me
dialog: this wouldn’t happen and it did.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You never told me you were arrested.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Please don’t contact me again.
text: Mike watches as his chance to win walks away.
scene_heading: INT. MIKE’S CUBICLE - LATER
text: Mike sits with his head in hands. Harvey approaches him.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I couldn’t convince her to stand her
dialog: ground and tell the truth anyway.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: How the hell did you miss that arrest?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I don’t know. I went to Rachel, we did
dialog: every background check we have.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Did you grill her like I told you to?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: It was a sealed record!
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Goddamn it, I knew it! You didn’t grill
dialog: her because you were afraid to make her
dialog: uncomfortable. That’s why I don’t get
dialog: emotionally involved. So I can ask the
dialog: tough questions that you won't.
text: Mike starts packing up his things.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: So, you're going to quit?
dialog: A Legal Mind 73.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: It’s either that or wait for Louis to
dialog: fire me.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: My first day, Louis fired Gary Lipsky for
dialog: screwing up a case. He said if I did the
dialog: same thing I’d be gone as fast as Gary.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Then go to your witness’ house and try to
dialog: get her to testify again.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I’m telling you, I was there today.
dialog: There’s no way.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: There’s always a way.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Then why don’t you go over there and
dialog: convince her.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Because you screwed it up.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: And you don’t give a damn about the
dialog: client.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: That’s not my job.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Does your job include giving a damn about
dialog: me? Because the least you could do is
dialog: offer to stand up to Louis Litt for me.
text: This pisses Harvey off.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Stand up for you?! I put my ass on the
dialog: line for you, and the first roadblock you
dialog: stumble into you want to quit. Being a
dialog: success is about knowing the difference
dialog: between having balls and having courage.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: And what is that?
dialog: A Legal Mind 74.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: You had the balls to get this job, but
dialog: you don’t have the courage to stick it
dialog: out when it gets tough.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That’s not true.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Isn’t it? You’ve had one foot out the
dialog: door since you got here.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I'm talking about that second briefcase
dialog: locked in your desk.
dialog: (off Mike’s look)
dialog: Yeah, I saw it. And I know what it is.
dialog: It’s a backup plan in case this doesn’t
dialog: work out. You can make some quick cash
dialog: and go right back to the life you told me
dialog: you didn’t want to lead.
text: This hits Mike hard.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: So, if you want to quit, go ahead. But
dialog: it isn’t because of Louis Litt, it isn’t
dialog: because of me and isn’t because of your
dialog: witness. It’s because you’re afraid you
dialog: might fail and then you’ll have to look
dialog: yourself in the mirror and admit you're
dialog: not as smart as you think you are.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Now go home and think about that. If
dialog: you're here in the morning, I'll know I
dialog: still have an associate.
text: Harvey turns and walks away. Mike throws a stack of papers
text: against the wall in frustration.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY - A LITTLE LATER
text: Mike is riding the subway with his box of things and one of
text: his briefcases at his feet. The subway stops. He gets off.
dialog: A Legal Mind 75.
scene_heading: INT. MIKE’S STUDIO APARTMENT - LATER
text: Mike enters and flops on the couch. He sits, not knowing
text: what to do. He reaches under the couch and pulls out his old
text: bong. He takes some pot out, puts it in the bong and lights
text: a match. Before he takes the hit, he blows out the match and
text: puts it all down in disgust. He gets up and leaves.
scene_heading: INT. NURSING HOME - MIKE’S GRANDMOTHER’S ROOM - LATER
text: Mike enters Grammy’s room. She’s asleep. He sits down next
text: to her and holds her hand. She wakes and sees him in a suit.
speaker_heading: GRAMMY
dialog: Michael, look at you... I’m so proud.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Grammy, I made good on my promise, but...
dialog: I want to quit. I can’t take it.
speaker_heading: GRAMMY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Because I can’t do the things I’m
dialog: supposed to do.
speaker_heading: GRAMMY
dialog: Michael, when your parents died, I lost
dialog: my son and my daughter-in-law. I was
dialog: scared, alone and too old to raise you.
text: She looks him in the eye and smiles.
speaker_heading: GRAMMY
dialog: But I had no choice. I had to make do...
dialog: because who else was going to care for my
dialog: grandson? I wasn’t going to give you up
dialog: unless they ripped you from my arms.
text: Grammy takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: GRAMMY
dialog: You made me a promise before. You're in
dialog: the door. Promise me now the only way
dialog: you'll leave is if they rip you out.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I promise.
text: Mike hugs her and exits. As before, he mumbles to himself...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I just have to do one thing first.
dialog: A Legal Mind 76.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS’S OFFICE - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Louis is working late. Harvey storms in.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Louis, I get that you were upset because
dialog: I was promoted before you. But if you
dialog: ever threaten to fire an associate of
dialog: mine again, I’m gonna kick your ass.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Don’t play dumb with me. You fired Gary
text: Lipsky in front of Mike Ross.
text: Louis smirks.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: What’s so funny?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
text: Gary Lipsky works in the mail room.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: He was a plant. I didn’t fire anybody.
dialog: It was just my way of letting Mike know
dialog: what’s expected of him.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: What’s wrong with you? You planted a
dialog: fake an employee to manipulate Mike and --
text: A light bulb goes off in Harvey’s mind.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: That’s it.
dialog: (then, to Louis)
dialog: You make me sick.
text: Louis seethes as Harvey runs out.
scene_heading: INT. TREVOR STEVENS’ CONDOMINIUM - A LITTLE LATER
text: Mike, holding the briefcase, uses his key to let himself into
text: Trevor's. Trevor and Jenny are immediately happy to see him.
speaker_heading: TREVOR/JENNY
dialog: Mike!/Thank god.
dialog: A Legal Mind 77.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I’m not giving this back because you want
dialog: it, I’m giving it back because I don’t
dialog: need it.
text: Mike puts the briefcase in front of Trevor. Jenny looks at
dialog: Trevor, he’s going to have some explaining to do...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I don’t know if I’m ever going to forgive
dialog: you or not, but I know this: We’re even.
text: Mike throws the key to Trevor’s place back to Trevor.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Wait a second...
text: Mike heads into Trevor’s bedroom. He comes back out holding
text: all of Trevor's two thousand dollars suits. As he exits...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Now we’re even.
scene_heading: EXT. PHILLIP’S TOWN HOME - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Katherine rings Phillip’s doorbell. He answers.
scene_heading: INT. PHILLIP’S TOWN HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Phillip pours them each a drink. He hands her the glass...
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Katherine, did you think he was going to
dialog: change overnight?
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: I’m worried he isn’t going to change at
dialog: all. I'’11 lose the best attorney I’ve
dialog: got.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: If you care about Harvey, putting him
text: through the ringer is his only chance.
text: Katherine takes a drink of her whiskey.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Remember when I was coming up, it was a
dialog: different time. Women weren’t welcome --
dialog: I took a lot of cheap shots you never
dialog: knew about.
dialog: Phillip looks at Katherine, “Didn’t I?”
dialog: A Legal Mind 78.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Those cheap shots forged you into the
dialog: woman you are today.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: My point is most men get hazed and think,
dialog: “I went through it, I’m gonna stick it to
dialog: the next guy.” I always felt, “I hated
dialog: that. Why put someone else through it?”
text: Phillip drinks his whiskey and smiles at the irony.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Then you need to learn to be harder, so
dialog: Harvey can learn to be softer.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Harvey knocks on Joanna Webster’s front door. She opens it.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Who are you? What do you want?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I work with Mike Ross.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Well, you can save your breath, because I
dialog: told Mike there’s no way I’m going
dialog: testify at that hearing tomorrow.
text: She closes the door. Harvey stops it.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: That’s not why I’m here. I know what you
dialog: did.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: What are you talking about?
text: Harvey enters her place as she slowly backs away.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: You're a plant. A fake employee. You
dialog: never worked at Devlin McGreggor, and you
dialog: were never harassed by Mr. Hunt.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: That’s not --
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I could tell you I’ve got the canceled
dialog: check, or the wire transfer, or whatever
dialog: smoking gun that exists, but I don’t.
dialog: A Legal Mind 79.
text: Harvey looks her dead in the eye.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: But I will. And when I do, you’1l be
dialog: going to jail. Unless you tell me what
dialog: happened right now.
text: Joanna Webster doesn’t know what to do.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I’m the guy you tell.
text: A moment.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: All I had to do was waste your time until
dialog: the hearing tomorrow. Please, I needed
dialog: the money, I don’t want to go to jail...
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Here's what you're going to do...
scene_heading: INT. HARVEY'S OFFICE - NEXT MORNING
text: Harvey's at his desk. Mike enters, sheepishly. Harvey
dialog: smiles.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I see you came to work today. Nice suit.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: It was a barter transaction. I got
text: twelve of them for one little briefcase.
text: Harvey smiles. He’s proud of Mike. Mike gets serious.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Listen, I’m sorry and --
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Forget it. When I started, Katherine
dialog: rode me so hard, I quit once a month. I
dialog: just told you what you needed to hear.
dialog: Mike still needs to say what he was going to say...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That’s just it. When I was ten my mom
dialog: and dad died in a car accident. After a
dialog: thing like that, you don’t trust anything
dialog: or anyone. Except my Grammy. She raised
dialog: me, she did the best she could...
text: Mike takes a deep breath and gets emotional.
dialog: A Legal Mind 80.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: She always told me what I needed to hear.
text: Mike looks at Harvey.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I guess it’s time I trusted someone else.
text: A moment. Harvey is moved. He tosses Mike a file.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Merry Christmas.
text: Mike looks through the file, absorbs it contents, then:
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What would you have done with this if I
dialog: hadn’t come in today?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I'd have used it myself.
text: Harvey lets it sink in that if Mike hadn’t come in today,
dialog: Harvey wouldn’t have tracked him down. Then:
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: You know what to do?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah. Press until it hurts.
scene_heading: INT. COURTHOUSE CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER THAT DAY
text: Mike slaps down a piece of paper. SLAM!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Wire transfer from your account in the
dialog: amount of five thousand dollars.
text: We reveal that Mike is standing in front of Mr. Hunt and his
text: defense counsel. Harvey sits quietly at the table along with
text: Nancy. Mike slaps down another piece of paper. SLAM!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Phone records proving multiple contacts
dialog: with Joanna Webster prior to her testimony.
dialog: Another document. SLAM!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: An affidavit stating you paid Ms. Webster
dialog: to falsely testify.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: A Legal Mind 81.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr. Hunt, harassment is a civil
dialog: violation, for which you were being sued.
dialog: Witness tampering is a crime, for which
dialog: you will go to prison.
text: Mike gathers up the pieces of paper.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: And I guarantee you’re going to learn
dialog: more about the act of unwanted sexual
dialog: advances than you ever thought possible.
speaker_heading: MR. HUNT
dialog: You think this is gonna intimidate me?!
dialog: Even if this evidence was credible, who
dialog: are you going to get to prosecute me for
dialog: some piss-ant witness tampering charge?
text: Mike turns to Harvey.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Harvey, didn’t you graduate law school
dialog: with New York’s current U.S. Attorney?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: In fact I did. I think he might be
dialog: interested in pursuing a case like this.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Are you two close?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I was the best man at his wedding.
speaker_heading: MR. HUNT
dialog: No you weren't. You're bluffing.
text: Harvey nods to Mike, who puts pictures in front of Mr. Hunt.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Here’s us at graduation. He’s sad ‘cause
dialog: he just found out I outranked him.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Here’s one with the District Attorney. I
dialog: wouldn't show him this case, though.
dialog: He’d push for the death penalty.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Here’s one of us at a bachelor party. It
dialog: was lame, no strippers. But he can’t put
dialog: guys like you away for sexual harassment
dialog: then go to strip clubs now, can he?
speaker_heading: DEFENSE COUNSEL
dialog: What do you want?
dialog: A Legal Mind 82.
text: Mike looks at Nancy, then addresses Mr. Hunt.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: A statement admitting what you did, your
dialog: resignation, and a guarantee you will
dialog: obtain treatment before working again.
text: Mr. Hunt nods his head yes.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: And Nancy gets reinstated with back pay,
dialog: a raise, and damages in the amount of
dialog: four years tuition for her son at the
dialog: most expensive university in the country.
speaker_heading: DEFENSE COUNSEL
dialog: Are we done?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yes, we’re done.
text: Defense counsel and Mr. Hunt exit. Nancy turns to Mike.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: This is everything I wanted. My job
dialog: back, my dignity, a future for Freddie...
text: Harvey smiles as Nancy hugs Mike...
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I can’t thank you enough.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: It was my pleasure.
text: Nancy shakes Harvey’s hand. Harvey and Mike exit the room...
scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE COURTHOUSE - A LITTLE LATER
text: Harvey and Mike walk out of the courthouse.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Okay, I just have one question, why did
dialog: you go to Joanna Webster’s house?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Because I figured it out.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I think you did it because you cared
dialog: about me.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I did it because it’s my job.
dialog: A Legal Mind
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Admit it, you cared. I saw the smile on
dialog: your face when I showed up this morning.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I didn’t smile.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Say what you want. You know it, and I
dialog: know it, you smiled.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I was thinking of a funny joke.
scene_heading: INT. KATHERINE’S OFFICE - THAT NIGHT
text: Harvey enters, contrite.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: You know we won.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Frankly, Harvey, I don’t care.
text: A moment. This lands on Harvey. He’s probably never said:
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I broke a promise to you. I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: (steely)
dialog: Make it up to me.
text: She tosses hima file. He reads it.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: This is a criminal case. I don’t --
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: The man’s innocent. He’s got a family.
dialog: He needs a winner.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: (putting it together)
dialog: You took my partnership away, folded
dialog: instantly when I threatened you, then
dialog: asked me to take a pro bono. Now you’re
dialog: asking me to do this?
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: I’m not saying you can’t still do the fun
dialog: stuff. And this is a paying case...
dialog: 83.
dialog: A Legal Mind 84.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: What I’m wondering is, have you just been
dialog: manipulating me this whole time into some
dialog: kind of... personal growth?
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Am I smart enough to do that?
text: Harvey holds up the file.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Is this the last one?
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: I don’t make promises I can’t keep.
scene_heading: INT. MIKE’S CUBICLE - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Mike heads out, Harvey joins him and hands him the file...
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: We start on this tomorrow.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Does this mean we're officially a team?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I wouldn't move your things into Wayne
dialog: Manor just yet.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: So, now you're Batman?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
text: Closer to him than the fat Godfather guy.
text: They approach the elevator as the door opens...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: George Clooney?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Christian Bale.
text: Mike shakes his head no as the elevator the door closes.
speaker_heading: MIKE (0.S.)
dialog: Did you really quit when you were first
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: HARVEY (0.S.)
dialog: Of course not. I’m not a wuss.
speaker_heading: END _OF SHOW
dialog:
