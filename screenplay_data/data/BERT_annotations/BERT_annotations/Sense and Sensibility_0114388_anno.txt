scene_heading: "SENSE AND SENSIBILITY"
dialog: Screenplay by
dialog: Emma Thompson
dialog: Based on the novel by
dialog: Jane Austen
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OPEN ROADS - NIGHT - TITLE SEQUENCE
text: A series of traveling shots. A well-dressed, pompous-looking
text: individual (JOHN DASHWOOD, 35) is making an urgent journey
text: on horseback. He looks anxious.
scene_heading: EXT. NORLAND PARK - ENGLAND - MARCH 1800 - NIGHT
text: Silence. Norland Park, a large country house built in the
text: early part of the eighteenth century, lies in the moonlit
dialog: parkland.
scene_heading: INT. NORLAND PARK - MR DASHWOOD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: In the dim light shed by candles we see a bed in which a MAN
text: (MR DASHWOOD, 52) lies his skin waxy, his breathing laboured.
text: Around him two silhouettes move and murmur, their clothing
text: susurrating in the deathly hush. DOCTORS. A WOMAN (MRS
text: DASHWOOD, 50) sits by his side, holding his hand, her eyes
text: never leaving his face.
speaker_heading: MR DASHWOOD
dialog: (urgent)
dialog: Is John not yet arrived?
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: We expect him at any moment, dearest.
text: MR DASHWOOD looks anguished.
speaker_heading: MR DASHWOOD
dialog: The girls--I have left so little.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Shh, hush, Henry.
speaker_heading: MR DASHWOOD
dialog: Elinor will try to look after you
dialog: all, but make sure she finds a good
dialog: husband. The men are such noodles
dialog: hereabouts, little wonder none has
dialog: pleased her.
text: They smile at each other. MRS DASHWOOD is just managing to
dialog: conceal her fear and grief
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: But Marianne is sure to find her
dialog: storybook hero.
speaker_heading: MR DASHWOOD
text: A romantic poet with flashing eyes
dialog: and empty pockets?
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: As long as she loves him, whoever he
dialog: is.
speaker_heading: MR DASHWOOD
dialog: Margaret will go to sea and become a
dialog: pirate so we need not concern
dialog: ourselves with her.
text: MRS DASHWOOD tries to laugh but it emerges as a sob. An older
text: MANSERVANT (THOMAS) now enters, anxiety written on every
dialog: feature.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Your son is arrived from London,
dialog: sir.
text: MR DASHWOOD squeezes his wife's hand.
speaker_heading: MR DASHWOOD
dialog: Let me speak to John alone.
text: She nods quickly and he smiles at her with infinite
dialog: tenderness.
speaker_heading: MR DASHWOOD
dialog: Ah, my dear. How happy you have made
dialog: me.
text: MRS DASHWOOD makes a superhuman effort and smiles back. She
text: allows THOMAS to help her out. She passes JOHN DASHWOOD as
text: he enters, presses his hand, but cannot speak. JOHN takes
text: her place by the bed.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Father...
text: MR DASHWOOD summons his last ounces of energy and starts to
text: whisper with desperate intensity.
speaker_heading: MR DASHWOOD
dialog: John you will find out soon enough
dialog: from my will that the estate of
dialog: Norland was left to me in such a way
dialog: as prevents me from dividing it
dialog: between my families.
text: JOHN blinks. He cannot quite take it in.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Calm yourself, Father. This is not
dialog: good for you.
text: But MR DASHWOOD continues with even greater determination.
speaker_heading: MR DASHWOOD
dialog: Norland in its entirety is therefore
dialog: yours by law and I am happy for you
dialog: and Fanny.
text: JOHN looks torn between genuine distress and unexpected
dialog: delight.
speaker_heading: MR DASHWOOD
dialog: But your stepmother my wife and
dialog: daughters are left with only five
dialog: hundred pounds a year, barely enough
dialog: to live on and nothing for the girls'
dialog: dowries. You must help them.
text: JOHN's face is a picture of conflicting emotions. Behind
text: them is the ominous rustling of parchments.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Of course
speaker_heading: MR DASHWOOD
dialog: You must promise to do this.
text: A brief moment of sincerity overcomes JOHN's natural
dialog: hypocrisy.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I promise, Father, I promise.
text: MR DASHWOOD seems relieved. Suddenly his breathing changes.
text: JOHN looks alarmed. He rises and we hear him going to find
speaker_heading: the DOCTOR.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Come! Come quickly!
dialog: But it is we who share the dying man's last words.
speaker_heading: MR DASHWOOD
dialog: Help them.
scene_heading: EXT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - LONDON - DAY
text: Outside the house sits a very well-to-do carriage. Behind it
text: waits another open carriage upon which servants are laying
text: trunks and boxes.
speaker_heading: FANNY (V.O.)
dialog: 'Help them?'
scene_heading: INT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - DRESSING ROOM - DAY
text: JOHN is standing in mourning clothes and a traveling cape.
text: He is watching, and obviously waiting for, a pert WOMAN (FANNY
text: DASHWOOD) who is standing by a mirror looking at him keenly.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: What do you mean, 'help them'?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Dearest, I mean to give them three
dialog: thousand pounds.
text: FANNY goes very still. JOHN gets nervous.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: The interest will provide them with
dialog: a little extra income. Such a gift
dialog: will certainly discharge my promise
dialog: to my father.
text: FANNY slowly turns back to the mirror.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Oh, without question! More than
dialog: amply...
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: One had rather, on such occasions,
dialog: do too much than too little.
text: A pause as FANNY turns and looks at him again.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Of course, he did not stipulate a
dialog: particular sum.
scene_heading: INT. LAUNDRY - NORLAND PARK - DAY
text: A red-eyed MAID (BETSY) plunges a beautiful muslin frock
text: into a vat of black dye.
scene_heading: INT. NORLAND PARK - MRS DASHWOOD'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: MRS DASHWOOD is rushing about, mourning ribbons flapping,
text: putting her knick-knacks into a small valise. The room is in
text: chaos. A young WOMAN (ELINOR DASHWOOD) looks on helplessly.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: To be reduced to the condition of
dialog: visitor in my own home! It is not to
dialog: be borne, Elinor!
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Consider, Mamma! We have nowhere to
dialog: go.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: John and Fanny will descend from
dialog: London at any moment, followed no
dialog: doubt by cartloads of relatives ready
dialog: to turn us out of our rooms one by
dialog: one do you expect me to be here to
dialog: welcome them? Vultures!
text: She suddenly collapses into a chair and bursts into tears.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: I shall start making inquiries for a
dialog: new house at once. Until then we
dialog: must try to bear their coming.
scene_heading: INT. JOHN AND FANNY'S CARRIAGE - DAY
text: JOHN and FANNY are on their way out of London.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Fifteen hundred then. What say you
dialog: to fifteen hundred?
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: What brother on earth would do half
dialog: so much for his real sisters--let
dialog: alone half-blood?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: They can hardly expect more.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: There is no knowing what they expect.
dialog: The question is, what can you afford?
scene_heading: INT. NORLAND PARK - DRAWING ROOM - DAY
text: A beautiful young WOMAN (MARIANNE DASHWOOD) is sitting at
text: the piano playing a particularly sad piece. ELINOR enters.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Marianne, cannot you play something
dialog: else? Mamma has been weeping since
dialog: breakfast.
text: MARIANNE stops, turns the pages of her music book and starts
text: playing something equally lugubrious.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: I meant something less mournful,
dialog: dearest.
scene_heading: EXT. ROADSIDE INN - DAY
text: JOHN and FANNY are waiting as the OSTLERS make the final
text: adjustments to their carriage. The LANDLORD hovers, waiting
dialog: for a tip.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: A hundred pounds a year to their
dialog: mother while she lives. Would that
dialog: be more advisable? It is better than
dialog: parting with the fifteen hundred all
dialog: at once.
text: He displays some coins in his hand. FANNY removes one and
dialog: nods.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: But if she should live longer than
dialog: fifteen years we would be completely
dialog: taken in. People always live forever
dialog: when there is an annuity to be paid
dialog: them.
text: JOHN gives the coins to the LANDLORD.
scene_heading: EXT. NORLAND PARK - MARGARET'S TREE-HOUSE - DAY
text: ELINOR comes to the foot of a large tree from which a small
dialog: staircase issues.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Margaret, are you there? Please come
dialog: down. John and Fanny will be here
dialog: soon.
text: A pause. ELINOR is about to leave when a disembodied and
text: truculent young voice stops her.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (V.O.)
dialog: Why are they coming to live at
dialog: Norland? They already have a house
dialog: in London.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Because houses go from father to
dialog: son, dearest not from father to
dialog: daughter. It is the law.
text: Silence. ELINOR tries another tack.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: If you come inside, we could play
dialog: with your atlas.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (V.O.)
dialog: It's not my atlas any more. It's
dialog: their atlas.
text: CLOSE on ELINOR as she ponders the truth of this statement.
scene_heading: INT. JOHN AND FANNY'S CARRIAGE - DAY
text: JOHN and FANNY joggle on.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Twenty pounds now and then will amply
dialog: discharge my promise, you are quite
dialog: right.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Indeed. Although to say the truth, I
dialog: am convinced within myself that your
dialog: father had no idea of your giving
dialog: them money.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: They will have five hundred a year
dialog: amongst them as it is--
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: --and what on earth can four women
dialog: want for more than that? Their
dialog: housekeeping will be nothing at all
dialog: they will have no carriage, no horses,
dialog: hardly any servants and will keep no
dialog: company. Only conceive how comfortable
dialog: they will be!
scene_heading: INT. NORLAND PARK - SERVANTS' HALL - DAY
text: The large contingent of SERVANTS who staff Norland Park are
text: gathered in gloomy silence as ELINOR addresses them.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: As you know, we are looking for a
dialog: new home. When we leave we shall be
text: able to retain only Thomas and Betsy.
text: CAM holds on THOMAS and BETSY, a capable woman.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: We are very sorry to have to leave
dialog: you all. But we are certain you will
dialog: find the new Mrs Dashwood a fair and
dialog: generous mistress.
scene_heading: EXT. NORLAND PARK. DRIVE - DAY
text: JOHN and FANNY's carriage approaches Norland.
speaker_heading: FANNY (V.O.)
dialog: They will be much more able to give
dialog: you something.
scene_heading: INT. JOHN AND FANNY'S CARRIAGE - DAY
text: JOHN and FANNY are about to get out.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: So we are agreed. No money but the
dialog: occasional gift of game and fish in
dialog: season will be very welcome.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Your father would be proud of you.
scene_heading: INT. NORLAND PARK - DINING ROOM - EARLY EVE
text: The entire family, with the exception of MARGARET, is present.
text: BETSY is serving food in an atmosphere of stiff silence.
text: Cutlery clinks. JOHN chews loudly. MARIANNE is rigid with
text: resentment. MRS DASHWOOD maintains a cool, removed dignity.
text: ELINOR tries to play hostess.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: How is Mrs Ferrars?
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: My mother is always in excellent
dialog: health, thank you. My brother Robert
dialog: is in town with her this season and
dialog: quite the most popular bachelor in
dialog: London! He has his own barouche.
text: In the brief silence which follows this, FANNY surreptitiously
text: checks the hallmark on her butterknife.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: You have two brothers, have you not?
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Indeed, yes. Edward is the eldest
dialog: Mamma quite depends upon him. He is
dialog: traveling up from Plymouth shortly
dialog: and will break his journey here.
text: MRS DASHWOOD looks at ELINOR pointedly. JOHN notices.
speaker_heading: JOHN
speaker_heading: (to MRS DASHWOOD)
dialog: If that is agreeable to you, of
dialog: course.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: My dear John this is your home now.
text: FANNY looks about, barely able to conceal her satisfaction.
scene_heading: INT. NORLAND PARK - ELINOR'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: ELINOR is sitting with a little pile of parcels. She puts a
text: shawl into some paper and ties it with ribbon as MARIANNE
text: thunders in, looking mutinous.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Fanny wishes to know where the key
dialog: for the silver cabinet is kept.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Betsy has it, I think. What does
dialog: Fanny want with the silver?
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: I can only presume she wants to count
dialog: it. What are you doing?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Presents for the servants. Have you
dialog: seen Margaret? I am worried about
text: her. She has taken to hiding in the
dialog: oddest places.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Fortunate girl. At least she can
dialog: escape Fanny, which is more than any
dialog: of us is able.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: You do your best. You have not said
dialog: a word to her for a week.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: (truculently)
dialog: I have! I have said 'yes' and 'no'.
scene_heading: INT. NORLAND PARK - BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY
text: FANNY, MRS DASHWOOD, ELINOR and JOHN are at breakfast.
text: MARIANNE enters. ELINOR catches her eye and indicates FANNY
text: with a slight motion of her head. MARIANNE makes a face.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: (very polite)
dialog: Good morning, Fanny.
text: FANNY is rather startled.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Good morning, Marianne.
text: ELINOR is relieved.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: (to Fanny)
dialog: How did you find the silver? Is it
dialog: all genuine?
text: ELINOR rushes in before MARIANNE gets any further.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Pray, when may we expect the pleasure
dialog: of your brother's company?
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Edward is due tomorrow. And my dear
dialog: Mrs Dashwood, in view of the fact
dialog: that he will not be with us for long,
dialog: I wondered if Miss Margaret would
dialog: mind giving up her room to him the
text: view is quite incomparable from her
dialog: windows and I should so much like
dialog: Edward to see Norland at its best.
text: MARIANNE slams her cup down and throws a furious look at
speaker_heading: ELINOR.
scene_heading: INT. NORLAND PARK - MARGARET'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: ELINOR and MARIANNE are removing MARGARET's toys.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Intolerable woman!
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: There is but one consolation if Edward
dialog: is anything like Fanny, we shall be
text: only too happy to leave.
scene_heading: EXT. NORLAND PARK - DRIVE - DAY
text: A very capable HORSEMAN (EDWARD FERRARS) canters up the gravel
dialog: drive.
text: CLOSE on his face as he gazes up at the elegant façade.
scene_heading: INT. NORLAND PARK - DRAWING ROOM - DAY
text: Everyone except MARGARET is present. EDWARD has just shaken
text: bands with ELINOR. He behaves with great respect to the
text: DASHWOODS and seems embarrassed by FANNY's pro prietorial
dialog: air.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: But where is Miss Margaret? I declare,
dialog: Mrs Dashwood, I am beginning to doubt
dialog: of her existence! She must run
dialog: positively wild!
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Forgive us, Mr Ferrars. My youngest
dialog: is not to be found this morning. She
text: is a little shy of strangers at
dialog: present.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Naturally. I am also shy of strangers
dialog: and I have nothing like her excuse.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: (dangerous)
dialog: How do you like your view, Mr Ferrars?
text: ELINOR glances at her warningly but EDWARD replies with
dialog: careful consideration.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Very much. Your stables are very
dialog: handsome and beautifully kept, Mrs
dialog: Dashwood.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Stables! Edward--your windows overlook
dialog: the lake.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: An oversight, Fanny, led me to the
dialog: wrong room. I have rectified the
dialog: situation and am happily settled in
dialog: the guest quarters.
text: MARIANNE and ELINOR look at each other in surprise. FANNY
text: looks furious.
text: MRS DASHWOOD smiles warmly at EDWARD.
text: CLOSE on ELINOR. She is impressed.
scene_heading: INT. NORLAND PARK - STAIRCASE - DAY
text: FANNY is walking with EDWARD, who looks at the pictures with
dialog: interest.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: They are all exceedingly spoilt, I
dialog: find. Miss Margaret spends all her
dialog: time up trees and under furniture
dialog: and I have barely had a civil word
dialog: from Marianne.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: My dear Fanny, they have just lost
dialog: their father their lives will never
dialog: be the same again.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: That is no excuse.
scene_heading: INT. NORLAND PARK - LIBRARY - DAY
text: FANNY leads EDWARD in. She sniffs with distaste.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: I have never liked the smell of books.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Oh? No. The dust, perhaps.
text: As they speak, EDWARD notices a large atlas retreating
text: apparently all by itself across the floor. Someone is
text: obviously under the table, pulling it out of sight. He
text: registers it and immediately moves in such a way as to shield
text: it from FANNY. He turns back, searching for something to
dialog: divert her.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I hear you have great plans for the
text: walnut grove.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Oh yes! I shall have it pulled down
dialog: to make room for a Grecian temple.
text: There is a stifled wail from under the table, which EDWARD
text: covers with a cough.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: How picturesque. Will you show me
dialog: the site?
text: And he ushers FANNY out, flicking a quick glance over his
text: shoulder at the fugitive's foot.
scene_heading: INT. NORLAND PARK - VELVET ROOM - DAY
text: ELINOR, MRS DASHWOOD and MARIANNE are sitting round a table
text: with a pile of letters. ELINOR is handing one back to her
dialog: mother.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Too expensive. We do not need four
dialog: bedrooms, we can share.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: This one, then?
text: ELINOR reads the letter quickly.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Marianne, we have only five hundred
dialog: pounds a year. I will send out more
dialog: inquiries today.
text: There is a knock on the door. Hesitantly, EDWARD appears.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Pardon my intrusion, but I believe I
dialog: have found what you are looking for.
text: MARIANNE and MRS DASHWOOD are puzzled by his elliptical manner
text: but ELINOR immediately understands and rises, in smiling
dialog: relief.
scene_heading: INT. NORLAND PARK - ENTRANCE HALL OUTSIDE LIBRARY - DAY
text: EDWARD is standing outside keeping a discreet lookout. The
text: door is half open and he can hear ELINOR trying to coax
text: MARGARET out. FANNY walks by with a BUTLER to whom she is
text: giving instructions. EDWARD pretends to examine the mouldings
text: and she passes on unsuspecting.
speaker_heading: ELINOR (V.O.)
dialog: Won't you come out, dearest? We
dialog: haven't seen you all day. Mamma is
dialog: very concerned.
text: More silence. EDWARD thinks hard. He makes a decision.
scene_heading: INT. NORLAND PARK - LIBRARY - DAY
text: EDWARD walks in loudly.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Oh, Miss Dashwood! Excuse me I was
dialog: wondering do you by any chance have
dialog: such a thing as a reliable atlas?
text: ELINOR looks up at him in astonishment.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: I believe so.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Excellent. I wish to check the
dialog: position of the Nile.
text: EDWARD appears to be utterly sincere.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: My sister says it is in South America.
text: From under the table we hear a snort. ELINOR looks at him in
dialog: realisation.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Oh! No, no indeed. She is quite wrong.
dialog: For I believe it is in--in Belgium.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Belgium? Surely not. You must be
text: thinking of the Volga.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (from under the table)
dialog: The Volga?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Of course. The Volga, which, as you
dialog: know, starts in...
speaker_heading: EDWARD
text: Vladivostok, and ends in...
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: St Albans.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Indeed. Where the coffee beans come
dialog: from.
dialog: They are having such a good time that it is rather a pity
text: the game is stopped by the appearance from under the table
text: of MARGARET who reveals herself to be a disheveled girl of
text: eleven. She hauls the atlas up and plonks it in front of
speaker_heading: EDWARD.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: The source of the Nile is in
dialog: Abyssinia.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Is it? Good heavens. How do you do.
dialog: Edward Ferrars.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Margaret Dashwood.
text: EDWARD shakes MARGARET's hand solemnly and looks over her
text: head at ELINOR. They smile at each other, a connection made.
scene_heading: INT. NORLAND PARK - DRAWING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY
text: JOHN is reading a newspaper. MRS DASHWOOD sits across from
text: FANNY, who thumbs through a fashion-plate magazine. ELINOR
text: is at a desk by the window writing a letter we see the words
dialog: 'of course we should like to leave as soon as possible'.
text: Suddenly she hears a commotion outside. MARGARET runs past
text: the window brandishing a stick. EDWARD follows, and proceeds
dialog: to teach her the first principles of sword-fighting. They
text: feint and parry, EDWARD serious and without a hint of
text: condescension, MARGARET concentrating furiously. EDWARD
text: suddenly turns, as though feeling ELINOR's gaze. She smiles
text: but looks away quickly.
scene_heading: INT. NORLAND PARK - VELVET ROOM - ANOTHER DAY
text: EDWARD comes into the doorway and sees ELINOR who is listening
text: to MARIANNE playing a concerto. ELINOR stands in a graceful,
text: rather sad attitude, her back to us. Suddenly she senses
text: EDWARD behind her and turns. He is about to turn away,
text: embarrassed to have been caught admiring her, when he sees
text: she has been weeping. Hastily she tries to dry her eyes. He
text: comes forward and offers her a handkerchief, which she takes
text: with a grateful smile. We notice his monogram in the corner:
speaker_heading: ECF.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: (apologetic)
dialog: That was my father's favourite.
text: EDWARD nods kindly.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Thank you so much for your help with
dialog: Margaret, Mr Ferrars. She is a changed
dialog: girl since your arrival.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Not at all. I enjoy her company.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Has she shown you her tree-house?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Not yet. Would you do me the honour,
dialog: Miss Dashwood? It is very fine out.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: With pleasure.
text: They start to walk out of shot, still talking.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Margaret has always wanted to travel.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I know. She is heading an expedition
dialog: to China shortly. I am to go as her
dialog: servant but only on the understanding
dialog: that I will be very badly treated.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: What will your duties be?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
text: Sword-fighting, administering rum
text: and swabbing.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Ah.
text: CAM tilts up to find MRS DASHWOOD on the middle landing of
text: the staircase, smiling down at them. CAM tilts up yet further
text: to find FANNY on the landing above, watching EDWARD and ELINOR
text: with a face like a prune.
scene_heading: EXT. NORLAND PARK - GARDENS - DAY
text: EDWARD and ELINOR are still talking as they walk arm in arm
text: in the late afternoon sun.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: All I want--all I have ever wanted
text: is the quiet of a private life but
dialog: my mother is determined to see me
dialog: distinguished.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: As?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: She hardly knows. Any fine figure
dialog: will suit a great orator, a leading
dialog: politician, even a barrister would
dialog: serve, but only on the condition
dialog: that I drive my own barouche and
dialog: dine in the first circles.
text: His tone is light but there is an underlying bitterness to
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: And what do you wish for?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I always preferred the church, but
dialog: that is not smart enough for my mother
dialog: she prefers the army, but that is a
dialog: great deal too smart for me.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Would you stay in London?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I hate London. No peace. A country
dialog: living is my ideal a small parish
dialog: where I might do some good, keep
text: chickens and give very short sermons.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELDS NEAR NORLAND - DAY
text: EDWARD and ELINOR are on horseback. The atmosphere is
text: intimate, the quality of the conversation rooted now in their
dialog: affections.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: You talk of feeling idle and useless
dialog: imagine how that is compounded when
dialog: one has no choice and no hope
dialog: whatsoever of any occupation.
text: EDWARD nods and smiles at the irony of it.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Our circumstances are therefore
dialog: precisely the same.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Except that you will inherit your
dialog: fortune.
text: He looks at her slightly shocked but enjoying her boldness.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: We cannot even earn ours.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Perhaps Margaret is right.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Right?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Piracy is our only option.
text: They ride on in silence for a moment.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: What is swabbing exactly?
scene_heading: INT. NORLAND PARK - DRAWING ROOM - EVE
text: Dinner is over. JOHN and FANNY are examining plans of the
text: Norland estate, looking for somewhere to build a hermitage.
text: EDWARD is reading out loud. ELINOR embroiders and listens.
text: MRS DASHWOOD and MARIANNE make up the rest of the audience,
text: the latter in a state of high impatience.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: No voice divine the storm allayed No
dialog: light propitious shone, When snatched
dialog: from all effectual aid, We perished
dialog: each alone: But I beneath a rougher
dialog: sea, And whelmed in deeper gulfs
dialog: than he.
text: MARIANNE jumps up and goes to him.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: No, Edward! Listen.
text: She takes the book from him and reads the stanza with
dialog: passionate brio.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Can you not feel his despair? Try
dialog: again.
text: Rather mortified, EDWARD starts again, but not before
text: receiving a sympathetic look from ELINOR which seems to
dialog: comfort him a little.
scene_heading: INT. NORLAND PARK - MORNING ROOM - DAY
text: MRS DASHWOOD is ruminating sadly. MARIANNE rushes in holding
dialog: a letter.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Mamma, look. This has just arrived.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: (reading from the
dialog: letter)
dialog: 'I should be pleased to offer you a
dialog: home at Barton Cottage as soon as
dialog: ever you have need of it' why, it is
dialog: from my cousin, Sir John Middleton!
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Even Elinor must approve the rent.
text: MRS DASHWOOD looks at the letter again and thinks.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Has Elinor not yet seen this?
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: No I will fetch her.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Wait. No. Let us delay.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: I think--I believe that Edward and
text: Elinor have formed an attachment.
text: Marianne nods, a little reluctantly.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: It would be cruel to take her away
text: so soon and Devonshire is so far.
text: MRS DASHWOOD makes her decision. She takes the letter and
text: hides it in the pocket of her gown. MARIANNE looks on
text: frowningly.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Why so grave? Do you disapprove her
dialog: choice?
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
text: By no means. Edward is very amiable.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Amiable but?
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: But there is something wanting. He
text: is too sedate his reading last night.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Elinor has not your feelings, his
dialog: reserve suits her.
text: MARIANNE thinks for a little.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Can he love her? Can the ardour of
dialog: the soul really be satisfied with
dialog: such polite, concealed affections?
dialog: To love is to burn to be on fire,
dialog: all made of passion, of adoration,
dialog: of sacrifice! Like Juliet, or
dialog: Guinevere or Heloise.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: They made rather pathetic ends, dear.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Pathetic! To die for love? How can
dialog: you say so? What could be more
dialog: glorious?
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: I think that may be taking your
text: romantic sensibilities a little far.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: The more I know of the world, the
dialog: more I am convinced that I shall
dialog: never see a man whom I can truly
dialog: love.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: You require so much!
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: I do not! I require only what any
dialog: young woman of taste should a man
text: who sings well, dances admirably,
text: rides bravely, reads with passion
dialog: and whose tastes agree in every point
dialog: with my own.
scene_heading: INT. NORLAND PARK - ELINOR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: ELINOR is in bed, deep in thought. MARIANNE enters in her
text: nightclothes, carrying a book of poetry. She reads, teasingly.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Is love a fancy, or a feeling? No It
dialog: is immortal as immaculate truth 'Tis
dialog: not a blossom shed as soon as Youth
text: Drops from the stem of life for it
dialog: will grow In barren regions, where
dialog: no waters flow Nor ray of promise
dialog: cheats the pensive gloom--
text: She jumps onto the bed. ELINOR smiles somewhat suspiciously.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: What a pity it is that Edward has no
dialog: passion for reading.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: It was you who asked him to read and
dialog: then you made him nervous.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Me?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: But your behaviour to him in all
dialog: other respects is perfectly cordial
dialog: so I must assume that you like him
dialog: in spite of his deficiencies.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: (trying hard)
dialog: I think him everything that is amiable
dialog: and worthy.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Praise indeed!
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: But he shall have my unanswering
dialog: devotion when you tell me he is to
dialog: be my brother.
text: ELINOR is greatly taken aback and does not know how to reply.
text: Suddenly MARIANNE hugs her passionately.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: How shall I do without you?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Do without me?
text: MARIANNE pulls away, her eyes full of tears.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: I am sure you will be very happy.
dialog: But you must promise not to live too
text: far away.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Marianne, there is no question of
dialog: that is, there is no under standing
dialog: between...
text: ELINOR trails off. MARIANNE looks at her keenly.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Do you love him?
text: The bold clarity of this question discomforts ELINOR.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: I do not attempt to deny that I think
dialog: very highly of him that I greatly
dialog: esteem that I like him.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Esteem him! Like him! Use those
dialog: insipid words again and I shall leave
dialog: the room this instant!
text: This makes ELINOR laugh in spite of her discomfort.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Very well. Forgive me. Believe my
dialog: feelings to be stronger than I have
dialog: declared but further than that you
dialog: must not believe.
text: MARIANNE is flummoxed but she rallies swiftly and picks up
dialog: her book again.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: 'Is love a fancy or a feeling?' Or a
dialog: Ferrars?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Go to bed!
text: ELINOR blushes in good earnest. MARIANNE goes to the door.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: (imitating Elinor)
dialog: 'I do not attempt to deny that I
dialog: think highly of him greatly esteem
dialog: him! Like him!'
text: And she is gone, leaving ELINOR both agitated and amused.
scene_heading: INT. NORLAND PARK - BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY
text: FANNY is standing by the window looking out. We see her POV
text: of ELINOR and EDWARD walking in the garden.
text: MRS DASHWOOD enters, pauses for a moment and then joins FANNY
text: at the window. FANNY pretends not to have been watching but
text: MRS DASHWOOD looks down at the lovers and then smiles sweetly
text: at her.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: We are all so happy that you chose
dialog: to invite Edward to Norland. He is a
dialog: dear boy and we are all very fond of
dialog: him.
text: FANNY does a bit of quick thinking.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: We have great hopes for him. Much is
dialog: expected of him by our mother with
dialog: regard to his profession
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Naturally.
speaker_heading: FANNY
text: And in marriage. She is determined
dialog: that both he and Robert will marry
dialog: well.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Of course. But I hope she desires
dialog: them to marry for love, first and
dialog: foremost? I have always felt that,
dialog: contrary to common wisdom, true
dialog: affection is by far the most valuable
dialog: dowry.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Love is all very well, but
dialog: unfortunately we cannot always rely
dialog: on the heart to lead us in the most
dialog: suitable directions.
text: FANNY lowers her voice confidingly.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: You see, my dear Mrs Dashwood, Edward
dialog: is entirely the kind of compassionate
dialog: person upon whom penniless women can
dialog: prey--and having entered into any
dialog: kind of understanding, he would never
dialog: go back on his word. He is quite
text: simply incapable of doing so. But it
dialog: would lead to his ruin. I worry for
dialog: him so, Mrs Dashwood. My mother has
dialog: always made it perfectly plain that
dialog: she will withdraw all financial
dialog: support from Edward, should he choose
dialog: to plant his affections in less...
dialog: exalted ground than he deserves.
text: It is impossible for MRS DASHWOOD not to get the point. She
text: is appalled and furious.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: I understand you perfectly.
text: She sweeps off.
scene_heading: INT. NORLAND PARK - MRS DASHWOOD'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY
text: MRS DASHWOOD, breathless with rage, is searching through her
text: wardrobe for the gown which contains SIR JOHN's letter. Frocks
text: fly hither and thither. Finally MRS DASHWOOD plunges her
text: hand into the right pocket and withdraws the letter. She
text: looks at it, suddenly concerned and anxious.
scene_heading: INT. NORLAND PARK - DINING ROOM - EVE
text: The entire family is present. Everyone is watching MRS
text: DASHWOOD, who has just made her announcement.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Devonshire!
text: He is devastated. FANNY is thrilled. MRS DASHWOOD looks at
text: him with compassion and then at ELINOR, who is trying to
dialog: keep calm.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: My cousin Sir John Middleton has
dialog: offered us a small house on his
dialog: estate.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Sir John Middleton? What is his
dialog: situation? He must be a man of
dialog: property.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
text: He is a widower. He lives with his
dialog: mother-in-law at Barton Park and it
dialog: is Barton Cottage that he offers us.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Oh, a cottage! How charming. A little
dialog: cottage is always very snug.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: But you will not leave before the
dialog: summer?
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Oh, my dear Edward, we can no longer
dialog: trespass upon your sister's good
dialog: will. We must leave as soon as
dialog: possible.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You will come and stay with us,
dialog: Edward!
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I should like that very much.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Edward has long been expected in
dialog: town by our mother.
text: MRS DASHWOOD ignores FANNY.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Come as soon as you can, Edward.
dialog: Remember that you are always welcome.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. NORLAND PARK - STABLES - DAY
text: ELINOR has come to say goodbye to her HORSE. She strokes the
text: soft face sadly. Then she senses someone and turns to find
text: EDWARD standing nearby.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Cannot you take him with you?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: We cannot possibly afford him.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Perhaps he could make himself useful
dialog: in the kitchen?
text: ELINOR tries to smile. EDWARD looks at her for a long moment
text: and then comes closer.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Miss Dashwood--Elinor. I must talk
dialog: to you.
dialog: The use of her Christian name--and in such a loving tone--
text: stops ELINOR's breath altogether.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: There is something of great importance
dialog: I need... to tell you--
text: He comes closer still. The HORSE breathes between them. ELINOR
text: is on fire with anticipation but EDWARD looks troubled and
text: has less the air of a suitor than he might.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: --about--about my education.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Your education?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Yes. It was less... successful than
dialog: it might have been.
text: EDWARD laughs nervously. ELINOR is completely bewildered.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: It was conducted in Plymouth--oddly
dialog: enough.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Indeed?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Yes. Do you know it?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Plymouth?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Oh--well--I spent four years there--
text: at a school run by a--a Mr Pratt--
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Pratt?
text: ELINOR is beginning to feel like a parrot.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Precisely--Mr Pratt--and there, I--
dialog: that is to say, he has a--
text: As EDWARD flounders, a familiar voice cuts through this
text: unexpected foray into his academic past.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Edward! Edward!
text: They turn to find FANNY powering down upon them, waving a
text: letter. EDWARD steps back, glancing almost guiltily at ELINOR,
dialog: who is as confused as we are.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: I have been all over for you! You
dialog: are needed in London this instant!
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Fanny, I am leaving this afternoon
dialog: as it is--
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: No, no, that will not do. Family
dialog: affairs are in chaos owing to your
dialog: absence. Mother is quite adamant
dialog: that you should leave at once.
text: FANNY is determined. She obviously has no intention of leaving
text: him alone with ELINOR. EDWARD turns to ELINOR, frustration
text: in every muscle, his jaw set tight.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Excuse me, Miss Dashwood.
text: FANNY drags EDWARD off, leaving ELINOR to gaze sadly after
dialog: them.
scene_heading: INT. THE LADIES' CARRIAGE - OPEN ROAD - RAIN - EVE
text: The DASHWOODS are on their way. The mood is very sombre.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Edward promised he would bring the
dialog: atlas to Barton for me.
text: MARIANNE looks at ELINOR, pleased.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Did he? Well, I will wager he will
dialog: do so in less than a fortnight!
text: MRS DASHWOOD looks at ELINOR with satisfaction.
scene_heading: EXT. THE LADIES' CARRIAGE - OPEN ROAD - EVE
text: The carriage rolls on.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (V.O.)
dialog: Are we there yet?
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD TO AND FROM BARTON COTTAGE - DAY
text: In comparison to Norland, Barton Cottage has the air of a
text: damp shoebox. it sits low and bleak in the grey lonely
dialog: countryside.
text: From one side we can see the DASHWOODS' carriage drawing up
text: at the gate. From the other, a much grander vehicle, from
text: which loud whooping can be heard, is approaching.
scene_heading: EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN PATH - DAY
text: As the exhausted DASHWOODS alight, they converge with a ruddy-
text: complexioned MAN in a redingote (SIR JOHN MIDDLETON) and a
text: rotund, equally roseate LADY (MRS JENNINGS) who have fallen
text: over each other in their haste to get out of their carriage.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Sir John!
text: SIR JOHN clasps her hands and starts to help her up the path,
text: followed by ELINOR, MARIANNE and MARGARET, who is clearly
text: fascinated by his bouncy companion.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Dear ladies, dear ladies, upon my
dialog: word, here you are, here you are,
dialog: here you are!
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Sir John, your extraordinary kindness--
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Oh, none of that, hush, please, none
dialog: of that, but here is my dear mamma-
dialog: in-law Mrs Jennings.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Was the journey tolerable, you poor
dialog: souls?
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Why did you not come up to the Park
dialog: first and take your ease? We saw you
dialog: pass--Like many people who live rather
text: lonely lives together.
text: SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS talk incessantly, interrupt each
dialog: other all the time and never listen.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: --but I would not wait for you to
dialog: come to us, I made John call for the
dialog: carriage--
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: She would not wait, you know.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: --as we get so little company.
text: They reach the front door and BETSY's smiling welcome. In
text: the confusion of milling people and THOMAS carrying the
text: lighter luggage, MARIANNE contrives to slip into the house
text: alone. We follow her but hear the conversation continuing in
text: V.O. MARIANNE looks about the parlour, where a dismal fire
text: is smoking. She starts up the stairs, expressionless.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS (V.O.)
dialog: But I feel as if I know you already--
dialog: delightful creatures!
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN (V.O.)
dialog: Delightful! And you know you are to
dialog: dine at Barton Park every day.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD (V.O.)
dialog: Oh, but dear Sir John, we cannot--
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN (V.O.)
dialog: Oh, no no no no no no no, I shall
dialog: not brook refusals. I am quite deaf
dialog: to 'em, you know--
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS (V.O.)
dialog: --deaf--
text: MARIANNE enters a small bedroom. She sits on the bed. Then
text: she goes to the window and opens it. Voices float up.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN (V.O.)
dialog: But I insist!
speaker_heading: ELINOR (V.O.)
dialog: Let us only settle in for a few days,
dialog: Sir John, and thank you--
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN (V.O.)
dialog: Oh, no thankings, no, please, can't
dialog: bear 'em, embarrassing, you know--
text: MARIANNE closes the window and crosses the corridor to another
text: bed room--similarly stark. She sighs and turns back down the
dialog: stairs.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN (V.O.)
dialog: We will send game and fruit as a
dialog: matter of course--
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS (V.O.)
dialog: --fruit and game--
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN (V.O.)
dialog: --and the carriage is at your beck
dialog: and call--
text: MARIANNE joins the group, who are now in the parlour.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: --call--and here is Miss Marianne!
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Where did you disappear to?
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: I declare you are the loveliest girl
dialog: I ever set eyes on! Cannot you get
dialog: them married, Mrs Dashwood? You must
dialog: not leave it too long!
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: But, alas, there are no smart young
dialog: men hereabouts to woo them--
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: --not a beau for miles!
text: The strain of exhibiting joy and gratitude is beginning to
text: tell on MRS DASHWOOD who is sagging visibly.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Come, Mother, let us leave them in
dialog: peace.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: But there is Colonel Brandon!
text: SIR JOHN is dragging her down the path.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Excellent fellow! We served in the
dialog: East India Regiment together.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Just wait till he sees you! If we
dialog: can persuade him out to meet you!
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Reclusive individual. But you are
dialog: fatigued. I can see that you are
dialog: fatigued.
text: Now he is pushing her into the carriage.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Of course she is fatigued!
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Come along, Mother, we really must
dialog: leave them to themselves.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: You must get your maidservant to
dialog: make you up some camphor--it is the
dialog: best tonic for the staggers!
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Send Thomas to us for the carriage
dialog: when you are ready!
text: They take off, waving wildly. MARGARET goes down the path to
text: watch them and turns back to her slightly stunned family.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I like them.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: What generosity.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Indeed. I am surprised they did not
dialog: offer us their clothing.
scene_heading: INT. BARTON COTTAGE - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: MARIANNE and ELINOR are getting undressed for bed. it's very
text: cold. They keep their underclothing on and get in, shivering
text: at the bony chill of the linen.
scene_heading: EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - KITCHEN GARDEN - DAY
text: BETSY is pinning out laundry.
scene_heading: EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN - DAY
text: MARGARET tries to climb an impossible tree. Her petticoats
text: snag and tear.
scene_heading: INT. BARTON COTTAGE - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: MARIANNE looks out of the window at the wild countryside.
text: Uncon sciously, one hand plays up and down on the sill as
text: though it were a keyboard.
scene_heading: INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY
text: ELINOR sits at a little desk counting money and making notes.
text: BETSY enters to clean out the fire. She notices the money.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Sugar is five shilling a pound these
dialog: parts, Miss Dashwood.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: (lightly)
dialog: No more sugar then.
scene_heading: INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - EVE
text: CLOSE on MRS DASHWOOD looking out of the window, thinking.
text: She remembers MRS JENNINGS's words:
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS (V.O.)
dialog: Not a beau for miles.
text: MRS DASHWOOD turns into the room to look at her brood. ELINOR
text: and MARIANNE are mending MARGARET's petticoats. CLOSE on the
text: mother's anxious expression--what is to become of them?
scene_heading: EXT. BARTON PARK - EVE
text: Establishing shot of SIR JOHN's house--a very comfortable-
text: looking country seat with fine grounds.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN (V.O.)
dialog: Where can Brandon be, poor fellow? I
text: hope he has not lamed his horse.
scene_heading: INT. BARTON PARK - DINING ROOM - EVE
text: CLOSE on an empty chair and place setting. Pull out to reveal
text: the DASHWOODS at their first dinner with SIR JOHN and MRS
speaker_heading: JENNINGS.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Colonel Brandon is the most eligible
dialog: bachelor in the county--he is bound
dialog: to do for one of you. Mind, he is a
dialog: better age for Miss Dashwood--but I
dialog: dare say she left her heart behind
dialog: in Sussex, eh?
text: MARIANNE flashes an unmistakable glance of alarmed concern
text: at her sister, which MRS JENNINGS notices.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Aha! I see you, Miss Marianne! I
dialog: think I have unearthed a secret!
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Oho! Have you sniffed one out already,
dialog: Mother? You are worse than my best
dialog: pointer, Flossie!
text: They both laugh immoderately. ELINOR tries to stay calm.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: What sort of man is he, Miss Dashwood?
dialog: Is he butcher, baker, candlestick-
dialog: maker? I shall winkle it out of you
dialog: somehow, you know!
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
text: She's horribly good at winkling.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: You are in lonely country now, Miss
dialog: Dashwood, none of us has any secrets
dialog: here--
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: --or if we do, we do not keep them
dialog: for long!
text: ELINOR tries to smile. MARIANNE looks furious. MARGARET is
text: staring at MRS JENNINGS as if she were some particularly
text: thrilling form of wildlife.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: He is curate of the parish, I dare
dialog: say!
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Or a handsome lieutenant!
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Give us a clue, Miss Dashwood--is he
dialog: in uniform?
text: ELINOR starts to change the subject, but MARGARET interrupts
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: He has no profession!
text: SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS turn on her with screams of delight.
text: ELINOR, MARIANNE and MRS DASHWOOD look at each other
text: helplessly.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: No profession! A gentleman, then!
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: (with daggers)
dialog: Margaret, you know perfectly well
dialog: there is no such person.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: There is! There is! And his name
dialog: begins with an F!
text: ELINOR looks hard at her plate.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Margaret!
text: MRS DASHWOOD is appalled at her youngest's relish for such a
text: vulgar game. SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS are cock-a-hoop.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: F indeed! A very promising letter.
dialog: Let me--F, F, Fo, Fa... Upon my word,
dialog: but I cannot think of a single name
dialog: beginning with F--
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Forrest? Foster? Frost? Foggarty?
text: MARIANNE suddenly stands up. SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS are
text: so surprised they stop talking. Everyone stares at MARIANNE.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: (controlled fury)
dialog: Sir John, might I play your
dialog: pianoforte?
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Of course, yes--my goodness. We do
dialog: not stand on ceremony here, my dear.
text: For once, ELINOR is grateful for her sister's rudeness as
text: everyone rises and follows MARIANNE out.
scene_heading: EXT. BARTON PARK - FRONT STEPS - EVE
text: A soldierly MAN of about forty (COLONEL BRANDON) is
text: dismounting from his horse. From within we hear MARIANNE's
text: song begin. His head snaps up to the windows. An expression
text: of pained surprise comes into his melancholy, brooding eyes.
scene_heading: INT. BARTON PARK - MUSIC ROOM - EVE
text: Everyone watches MARIANNE as she plays and sings. Behind
text: them we see BRANDON entering. But he stays in the shadow of
text: the door and no one notices him. CLOSE on his face. He gazes
text: at MARIANNE with an unfathomable look of grief and longing.
text: He breathes in deeply. Suddenly, ELINOR feels his presence
text: and looks around at him. After a few moments, she turns back,
text: slightly puzzled. The song finishes. Everyone claps. The MAN
text: ventures out into the light and SIR JOHN springs from his
dialog: seat.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Brandon! Where have you been? Come,
dialog: come and meet our beautiful new
dialog: neighbours!
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: What a pity you are late, Colonel!
dialog: You have missed the most delightful
dialog: singing!
text: BRANDON bows to the company and smiles slightly.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: A great pity, indeed.
text: ELINOR looks at him, even more puzzled.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Mrs Dashwood, may I present my dear
dialog: friend Colonel Brandon? We served
dialog: together in the East Indies and I
dialog: assure you there is no better fellow
dialog: on earth--
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Have you really been to the East
dialog: Indies, Colonel?
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: I have.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: What is it like?
text: MARGARET is quivering with fascination.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Like? Hot.
text: But COLONEL BRANDON knows what MARGARET wants to hear.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: (mysteriously)
text: The air is full of spices.
text: MARGARET smiles with satisfaction.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Come, Miss Dashwood--it is your turn
dialog: to entertain us!
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Oh no, Sir John, I do not--
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: --and I think we can all guess what
dialog: key you will sing in!
text: SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS are bursting with their new joke.
scene_heading: SIR JOHN/MRS JENNINGS
dialog: F major!
dialog: They fall about.
scene_heading: INT. SIR JOHN'S CARRIAGE - NIGHT
text: The DASHWOODS are returning home. A row is in progress.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: (to Margaret)
dialog: As for you, you have no right, no
dialog: right at all, to parade your ignorant
dialog: assumptions--
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: They are not assumptions. You told
dialog: me.
text: ELINOR stares at MARIANNE. MARIANNE colours and attacks
text: MARGARET again.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: I told you nothing--
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: They'll meet him when he comes,
dialog: anyway.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: That is not the point. You do not
dialog: speak of such things before strangers--
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: But everyone else was--
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Mrs Jennings is not everyone.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I like her! She talks about things.
dialog: We never talk about things.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Hush, please, now that is enough,
dialog: Margaret. If you cannot think of
dialog: anything appropriate to say, you
dialog: will please restrict your remarks to
dialog: the weather.
text: A heated pause.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I like Colonel Brandon too. He's
dialog: been to places.

text: the remains of a picnic into a basket. MRS DASHWOOD and
text: MARGARET examine a foxhole. In the foreground, MARIANNE is
text: cutting bulrushes for basketwork. Her knife is blunt and she
text: saws impatiently.
text: COLONEL BRANDON materialises at her side and wordlessly offers
text: her his hunting knife. Oddly nervous, MARIANNE takes it. She
text: turns back to the rushes and cuts them with ease. The
text: COLONEL's gaze follows her movements as if held by a magnet.
scene_heading: INT. KEEPER'S LODGE - BARTON PARK - DAY
text: SIR JOHN and BRANDON are cleaning their guns in companionable
text: silence--a habit left over from army days. SIR JOHN eyes
text: BRANDON roguishly.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: You know what they're saying, of
dialog: course...
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: The word is that you have developed
dialog: a taste for--certain company.
text: BRANDON stays resolutely silent. SIR JOHN is emboldened.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: And why not, say I. A man like you--
dialog: in his prime--she'd be a most
dialog: fortunate young lady--
text: BRANDON cuts across him.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: Marianne Dashwood would no more think
dialog: of me than she would of you, John.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Brandon, my boy, do not think of
dialog: yourself so meanly--
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: And all the better for her.
text: SIR JOHN subsides. BRANDON is clearly as angry with himself
text: as he is with SIR JOHN.
scene_heading: EXT. POND NEAR BARTON PARK - ANOTHER DAY
text: BRANDON strides along in hunting gear, a gun slung under one
text: arm, his dog trotting behind him with a duck clamped between
text: its jaws. The bulrushes catch his eye and he slows, then
text: stops. He stands for a moment deep in thought. Then he takes
text: his hunting knife, cuts one and walks off contemplatively.
scene_heading: EXT. BARTON PARK - GARDENS - DAY
text: An outdoor luncheon is in progress. COLONEL BRANDON is talking
text: to MRS DASHWOOD. Occasionally he looks over towards MARIANNE,
text: who is playing bilboquet with SIR JOHN and MARGARET. MRS
text: JENNINGS nudges ELINOR hard and gestures to BRANDON.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: (stage whisper)
dialog: Besotted! Excellent match, for he is
text: rich and she is handsome.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: How long have you known the Colonel?
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Oh, Lord bless you, as long as ever
dialog: I have been here, and I came fifteen
dialog: years back. His estate at Delaford
dialog: is but four miles hence and he and
dialog: John are very thick. He has no wife
dialog: or children of his own, for--
text: MRS JENNINGS lowers her voice to a stentorian whisper.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: --he has a tragic history. He loved
dialog: a girl once--twenty years ago now--a
dialog: ward to his family, but they were
dialog: not permitted to marry...
text: ELINOR is intrigued.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: On what grounds?
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Money. Eliza was poor. When the father
dialog: discovered their amour, she was flung
text: out of the house and he packed off
dialog: into the army. I believe he would
dialog: have done himself a harm if not for
dialog: John...
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: What became of the lady?
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Oh, she was passed from man to man--
dialog: disappeared from all good society.
dialog: When Brandon got back from India he
dialog: searched for heaven knows how long,
text: only to find her dying in a poor
dialog: house. You have seen how it has
dialog: affected him. Once I thought my
dialog: daughter Charlotte might have cheered
text: him up, but she is much better off
dialog: where she is.
text: ELINOR is silent with amazement at this unexpected history.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Look at him now, though. So attentive.
dialog: I shall try an experiment on him.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Oh no, please, dear Mrs Jennings,
dialog: leave the poor Colonel alone.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: No, no, it is just the thing--all
dialog: suitors need a little help, my dear
text: MRS JENNINGS winks at ELINOR and rubs her hands as though
text: about to perform a magic trick.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: (trillingly)
dialog: Colonel Brandon!
text: BRANDON looks up.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: We have not heard you play for us of
dialog: late!
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: For the simple reason that you have
dialog: a far superior musician here.
text: He indicates MARIANNE, who smiles absently.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Perhaps you did not know, Miss
dialog: Marianne, that our dear Brandon shares
dialog: your passion for music and plays the
dialog: piano forte very well.
text: MARIANNE looks at BRANDON in some surprise.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Play us a duet!
text: BRANDON looks at MRS JENNINGS warningly but she ignores him.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: I'll trow you know quite as many
dialog: melancholy tunes as Miss Marianne!
text: Her tone is so knowing that MARIANNE frowns uncomfortably.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Come! Let us see you both side by
dialog: side!
text: MARIANNE rises impatiently.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: I do not know any duets. Forgive me,
dialog: Colonel.
text: She moves away. MRS JENNINGS chuckles.
scene_heading: INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - LATE AFTERNOON
text: The DASHWOODS returning. MARIANNE is taking her bonnet off
text: so furiously that she simply gets the knot tighter and
text: tighter. Despite them selves, ELINOR and MRS DASHWOOD are
dialog: amused.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Oh! Are we never to have a moment's
dialog: peace? The rent here may be low but
dialog: I think we have it on very hard terms.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
text: Mrs Jennings is a wealthy woman with
dialog: a married daughter--she has nothing
dialog: to do but marry off everyone else's.
text: BETSY pokes her head out from the dining room.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: There's a parcel arrived for you,
dialog: Miss Dashwood!
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: A parcel!
text: They all crowd into the dining room to find a large package
text: on the table, which MARGARET is permitted to open. In the
text: meantime ELINOR comes to the rescue with the bonnet and
text: MARIANNE stands shifting like a spirited mare as ELINOR
text: patiently unravels the knot.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: It is too ridiculous! When is a man
dialog: to be safe from such wit if age and
dialog: infirmity do not protect him?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Infirmity!
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: If Colonel Brandon is infirm, then I
dialog: am at death's door.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: It is a miracle your life has extended
dialog: this far...
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Did you not hear him complain of a
dialog: rheumatism in his shoulder?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: A slight ache' I believe was his
dialog: phrase...
text: MARIANNE smiles and ELINOR laughs at her. Then MARGARET opens
text: the parcel to reveal--her atlas. The atmosphere alters
text: immediately as MRS DASHWOOD and MARIANNE look at ELINOR in
text: consternation.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: But Edward said he would bring it
dialog: himself.
text: There is a letter on top of the atlas. CLOSE on the address
text: 'To the Dashwoods'. MRS DASHWOOD picks it up, looks at ELINOR,
dialog: and opens
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: 'Dear Mrs Dashwood, Miss Dashwood,
dialog: Miss Marianne and Captain Margaret--
dialog: it gives me great pleasure to restore
dialog: this atlas to its rightful owner.
dialog: Alas, business in London does not
dialog: permit me to accompany it, although
dialog: this is likely to hurt me far more
dialog: than it hurts you. For the present
dialog: my memories of your kindness must be
dialog: enough to sustain me, and I remain
dialog: your devoted servant always. E. C.
dialog: Ferrars.'
text: A silence greets this brief epistle. ELINOR struggles to
text: contain her bitter disappointment.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: But why hasn't he come?
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: He says he is busy, dear.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: He said he'd come.
text: MARGARET is genuinely upset. ELINOR quietly hangs up
text: MARIANNE's bonnet.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Why hasn't he come?
text: MRS DASHWOOD looks beseechingly at MARIANNE, who nods and
text: grasps MARGARET's hand.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: I am taking you for a walk.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: No! I've been a walk.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: You need another.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
text: It is going to rain.
text: MARIANNE shoves her bonnet back on and drags MARGARET out.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: It is not going to rain.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You always say that and then it always
dialog: does.
text: We hear the front door slam behind them. There is a short
dialog: silence.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: I fear Mrs Jennings is a bad
dialog: influence.
text: She approaches ELINOR.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: You must miss him, Elinor.
text: ELINOR looks very directly at her mother.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: We are not engaged, Mamma.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: But he loves you, dearest, of that I
dialog: am certain.
text: ELINOR looks down. She speaks slowly, choosing her words
dialog: with care.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: I am by no means assured of his regard
dialog: for me.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Oh, Elinor!
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: But even were he to feel such a...
dialog: preference, I think we should be
dialog: foolish to assume that there would
dialog: not be many obstacles to his choosing
dialog: a woman of no rank who cannot afford
dialog: to buy sugar...
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: But Elinor--your heart must tell you--
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: In such a situation, Mamma, it is
dialog: perhaps better to use one's head.
text: She clears her throat, rises determinedly, picks up the
text: accounts book and opens it. MRS DASHWOOD is silenced.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELDS NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY
text: MARIANNE walks very briskly, dragging an unwilling MARGARET
text: behind her.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNS NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY
text: It has started to rain. Mists are gathering around the two
text: figures walking against the wind.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Is there any felicity in the world
dialog: superior to this?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I told you it would rain.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Look! There is some blue sky! Let us
dialog: chase it!
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'm not supposed to run.
text: MARIANNE runs off down the hill into the heart of the mist.
text: MARGARET stumbles after her, grumbling. We follow MARIANNE
text: in her headlong descent and suddenly, dramatically, she trips
text: and sprawls to the ground, letting out a sharp cry of pain.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Marianne!
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Help me!
text: She tries to get up, but the pain in her ankle is too great.
text: She sinks back to the ground. MARGARET is very alarmed.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
text: Margaret, run home and fetch help.
text: The mists have thickened. They can no longer see where they
text: are. Despite her rising fear, MARGARET squares her shoulders
text: bravely and tries to sense the direction.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I think it is this way. I will run
dialog: as fast as I can, Marianne.
text: She dashes off. As she goes into the mist we hear the thunder
text: of hooves.
text: CU Margaret's terrified expression. They seem to be coming
text: from all around. She wheels and turns and then--Crash! Through
text: the mist breaks a huge white horse. Astride sits an Adonis
text: in hunting gear. MARGARET squeals. The horse rears. Its rider
text: controls it and slides off. He rushes to MARIANNE's side.
speaker_heading: THE STRANGER
dialog: Are you hurt?
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: (transfixed)
dialog: Only my ankle.
speaker_heading: THE STRANGER
dialog: May I have your permission to--
text: He indicates her leg. Decorous, perhaps faintly impish.
speaker_heading: THE STRANGER
dialog: --ascertain if there are any breaks?
text: MARIANNE nods speechlessly. With great delicacy, he feels
text: her ankle. MARGARET's eyes are out on chapel-hooks. MARIANNE
text: almost swoons with embarrassment and excitement mixed.
speaker_heading: THE STRANGER
dialog: It is not broken. Now, can you put
dialog: your arm about my neck?
text: MARIANNE does not need any encouragement. He lifts her
text: effortlessly and calls to his horse: 'Bedivere!' It trots
text: obediently forward. The STRANGER smiles down at MARIANNE.
speaker_heading: THE STRANGER
dialog: Allow me to escort you home.
scene_heading: INT. BARTON COTTAGE - DINING ROOM - DAY
text: Rain is thudding against the window from which MRS DASHWOOD
text: turns, looking very worried.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Marianne was sure it would not rain.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Which invariably means it will.
text: But we can see she is trying to conceal her anxiety from her
text: mother. There are noises in the hall.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: At last!
text: MARGARET runs into the room dripping wet.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: She fell over! She fell down--and
dialog: he's carrying her!
scene_heading: INT. BARTON COTTAGE - FRONT DOOR - DAY
text: MRS DASHWOOD and ELINOR rush to the front door. They see the
text: STRANGER carrying MARIANNE up the garden path, his scarlet
text: coat staining the monochrome rain.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Marianne!
text: The STRANGER reaches the door. This is no time for
dialog: introductions.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: In here, sir--this way. Margaret,
dialog: open the door wider. Please, sir,
dialog: lay her here. Marianne, are you in
dialog: pain?
text: They move into the parlour.
scene_heading: INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY
text: MARIANNE is carried in, surrounded by ELINOR, MRS DASHWOOD
text: and MARGARET.
speaker_heading: THE STRANGER
text: It is a twisted ankle.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Do not be alarmed, Mamma.
text: The STRANGER deposits MARIANNE on the sofa. They look straight
text: into each other's eyes. Electric.
speaker_heading: THE STRANGER
dialog: I can assure you it is not serious.
dialog: I took the liberty of feeling the
text: bone and it is perfectly sound.
text: ELINOR raises her eyebrows at MARIANNE, who blushes to her
dialog: roots.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Sir, I cannot even begin to thank
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: THE STRANGER
dialog: Please do not think of it. I'm
dialog: honoured of be of service.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Will you not be seated?
speaker_heading: THE STRANGER
dialog: Pray excuse me--I have no desire to
dialog: leave a water mark! But permit me to
dialog: call tomorrow afternoon and inquire
dialog: after the patient?
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: We shall look forward to it!
text: He turns to MARIANNE and smiles. She smiles back gloriously.
text: He bows, and sweeps out of the room.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: (hissing)
dialog: His name! His name!
text: MRS DASHWOOD silences her with a gesture and follows him out
text: with all the solicitous charm she can command while MARGARET
text: pokes her head around the door to watch. ELINOR is removing
text: MARIANNE's boot and trying not to laugh at her.
scene_heading: EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - FRONT DOOR - DAY
text: MRS DASHWOOD calls out after him.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Please tell us to whom we are so
dialog: much obliged?
text: The STRANGER mounts Bedivere and turns to her.
speaker_heading: THE STRANGER
dialog: John Willoughby of Allenham--your
dialog: servant, ma'am!
text: And he gallops off into the mist--we almost expect Bedivere
text: to sprout wings. CLOSE on MRS DASHWOOD's excited expression.
scene_heading: INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY
text: MRS DASHWOOD runs back into the parlour, jittering with
text: excitement and anxiety.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Mr John Willoughby of Allenham!
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: What an impressive gentleman!
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: He lifted me as if I weighed no more
dialog: than a dried leaf!
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Is he human?
text: MARIANNE hits ELINOR. MRS DASHWOOD tends to her ankle.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Tell me if I hurt you.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: (regarding Marianne's
dialog: ecstatic expression)
dialog: She feels no pain, Mamma. Margaret,
dialog: ask Betsy to make up a cold compress,
dialog: please.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (leaving reluctantly)
dialog: Did you see him? He expressed himself
dialog: well, did he not?
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: With great decorum and honour.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: And spirit and wit and feeling.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: And economy--ten words at most.
text: From below stairs we can hear MARGARET wailing Wait for me!
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: And he is to come tomorrow!
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: You must change, Marianne--you will
dialog: catch a cold.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: What care I for colds when there is
dialog: such a man?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: You will care very much when your
text: nose swells up.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: You are right. Help me, Elinor.
text: MARGARET comes back with the bandages.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: What has happened?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: We have decided to give you to the
dialog: Gypsies.
text: ELINOR and MARIANNE go upstairs. MARGARET whispers to MRS
scene_heading: DASHWOOD.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Will they be married before Edward
dialog: and Elinor, do you think, Mamma?
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Margaret, you are worse than Mrs
dialog: Jennings.
scene_heading: EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - MORNING
text: The rain has cleared. SIR JOHN's horse munches grass
text: contentedly by the side of the road.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN (V.O.)
dialog: Mr Willoughby is well worth catching,
dialog: Miss Dashwood--Miss Marianne must
dialog: not expect to have all the men to
dialog: herself!
scene_heading: INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - MORNING
text: The DASHWOODS are having a frustrating time winkling
text: information about WILLOUGHBY out of SIR JOHN, who is in turn
text: only anxious to protect BRANDON's interest. MARIANNE has her
text: bandaged foot up on the sofa and is fast losing patience.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: But what do you know of Mr Willoughby,
dialog: Sir John?
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Decent shot--and there is not a bolder
dialog: rider in all England.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: But what is he like?
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Like?
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: What are his tastes? His passions?
dialog: His pursuits?
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: (mystified)
dialog: Well, he has the nicest little bitch
dialog: of a pointer--was she out with him
dialog: yesterday?
text: MARIANNE gives up. MRS DASHWOOD takes over.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Where is Allenham, Sir John?
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
text: Nice little estate three miles east.
text: He is to inherit it from an elderly
dialog: relative--Lady Allen is her name.
text: Now they are getting somewhere. MARIANNE is about to ask
text: another question when they hear a horse galloping up. Everyone
text: is electrified. MARGARET runs to the window and turns back
dialog: in disappointment.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: It is Colonel Brandon. I shall go
text: outside and keep watch.
text: MARGARET runs out of the room.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: You are all on the lookout for
dialog: Willoughby, eh? Dear me, poor Brandon.
dialog: You will none of you think of him
dialog: now.
text: BRANDON is admitted by BETSY. He is carrying a large bunch
dialog: of hothouse flowers.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: How is the invalid?
text: He hands MARIANNE the flowers with a smile.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Thank you so much, Colonel.
text: She rather absently hands the flowers to ELINOR, who goes
text: for a vase. SIR JOHN gestures at BRANDON with bluff
dialog: insensitivity.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Miss Marianne, I cannot see why you
dialog: should set your cap at Mr Willoughby
dialog: when you have already made such a
dialog: splendid conquest!
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: I have no intention of 'setting my
dialog: cap' at anyone, Sir John!
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: Mr Willoughby--Lady Allen's nephew?
text: BRANDON's light tone betrays no emotion. ELINOR comes back
text: in with the flowers and puts them on the table next to
speaker_heading: MARIANNE.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Aye, he visits every year for he is
dialog: to inherit Allenham--and he has a
dialog: very pretty estate of his own, Miss
dialog: Dashwood, Combe Magna in Somerset.
dialog: If I were you, I would not give him
dialog: up to my younger sister in spite of
dialog: all this tumbling down hills.
text: Suddenly MARGARET runs in screaming 'Marianne's preserver!'
text: at the top of her voice. Everyone starts to move at once.
text: MARGARET is silenced. BRANDON looks at MARIANNE, whose
text: incandescent expression makes her feelings all too clear.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Here is the man himself. Come, Brandon--
dialog: we know when we are not wanted. Let
dialog: us leave him to the ladies!
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Marianne! Sir John and the Colonel
dialog: are leaving.
text: MARIANNE looks up, suddenly self-conscious.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Goodbye, Colonel. Thank you for the
dialog: flowers.
text: ELINOR sees them out. We hear WILLOUGHBY's voice outside.
text: CLOSE on MARIANNE's radiant anticipation.
scene_heading: EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - FRONT DOOR - DAY
text: WILLOUGHBY is shaking hands with COLONEL BRANDON and SIR
speaker_heading: JOHN.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: How do you do, Colonel?
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: How does he do? How do you do, more
dialog: like. Go on in, they're waiting for
dialog: you!
text: BRANDON looks at WILLOUGHBY for a moment. He bows. WILLOUGHBY
text: bows. Then BRANDON and SIR JOHN exit.
scene_heading: INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY
text: ELINOR leads in WILLOUGHBY. MRS DASHWOOD greets him with
text: outstretched arms.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Mr Willoughby! What a pleasure to
dialog: see you again!
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: The pleasure is all mine, I can
dialog: asstire you. I trust Miss Marianne
dialog: has not caught cold?
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: You have found out my name!
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: Of course. The neighbourhood is
dialog: crawling with my spies.
text: He suddenly produces a bunch of wild flowers from behind his
text: back and offers them to MARIANNE with a courtly, humorous
dialog: bow.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: And since you cannot venture out to
dialog: nature, nature must be brought to
dialog: you!
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: How beautiful. These are not from
dialog: the hothouse.
text: WILLOUGHBY sees BRANDON's flowers.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: Ah! I see mine is not the first
dialog: offering, nor the most elegant. I am
dialog: afraid I obtained these from an
text: obliging field.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: But I have always preferred wild
dialog: flowers!
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: I suspected as much.
text: ELINOR takes the delicate flowers from WILLOUGHBY.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: I will put these in water.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Our gratitude, Mr Willoughby, is
dialog: beyond expression--
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: But it is I who am grateful. I have
dialog: often passed this cottage and grieved
dialog: for its lonely state--and then the
dialog: first news I had from Lady Allen
dialog: when I arrived was that it was taken.
dialog: I felt a peculiar interest in the
dialog: event which nothing can account for
dialog: but my present delight in meeting
dialog: you.
text: He is merry, spirited, voluble--a breath of fresh air. ELINOR
text: brings back WILLOUGHBY's flowers and places them next to
text: BRANDON's on the side table.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Pray sit down, Mr Willoughby.
text: She indicates a chair but WILLOUGHBY sees a book lying on
text: MARIANNE's footstool, picks it up and--to her great delight--
text: sits down on the stool at her feet.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: Who is reading Shakespeare's sonnets?
text: Everyone answers at once.
scene_heading: MARIANNE/ELINOR/MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: I am. / We all are. / Marianne.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Marianne has been reading them out
dialog: to us.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: Which are your favourites?
text: It is a general question but MARIANNE gaily commandeers it.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Without a doubt, mine is 116.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: Let me not to the marriage of true
dialog: minds Admit impediments. Love is not
dialog: love Which alters when it alteration
text: finds, Or bends with the remover to
dialog: remove--then how does it go?
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: '0, no! it is an ever-fixed mark.'
text: WILLOUGHBY joins in the line halfway through and continues.
text: ELINOR and MRS DASHWOOD exchange glances. Clearly, their
dialog: contribution to this conversation will be minimal.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: 'That looks on storms'--or is it
dialog: tempests? Let me find it.
text: WILLOUGHBY gets out a tiny leatherbound book.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: It is strange you should be reading
dialog: them--for, look, I carry this with
dialog: me always.
text: It is a miniature copy of the sonnets. MARIANNE is delighted,
text: and, mutually astonished at this piece of synchronicity,
text: they proceed to look up other favourites, chatting as though
dialog: they were already intimates.
text: MRS DASHWOOD smiles at ELINOR with satisfaction. ELINOR,
text: amused, picks up her sewing. MARGARET stares. WILLOUGHBY and
text: MARIANNE are oblivious to everything but each other.
scene_heading: EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN PATH - DAY
text: WILLOUGHBY is leaving. He has a flower from MARIANNE's bunch
text: in his buttonhole and is on his horse, looking about as virile
text: as his horse. Everyone has come out to say goodbye, MARIANNE
text: supported by ELINOR and MRS DASHWOOD.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: Till tomorrow! And my pocket sonnets
dialog: are yours, Miss Marianne! A talisman
dialog: against further injury!
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Goodbye! Thank you!
text: He gallops off. They all wave. MARGARET follows him down the
text: road for a while.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Good work, Marianne! You have covered
dialog: all forms of poetry; another meeting
dialog: will ascertain his views on nature
dialog: and romantic attachments and then
dialog: you will have nothing left to talk
dialog: about and the acquaintanceship will
dialog: be over.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: I suppose I have erred against
dialog: decorum. I should have been dull and
dialog: spiritless and talked only of the
dialog: weather, or the state of the roads.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: No, but Mr Willoughby can be in no
dialog: doubt of your enthusiasm for him.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Why should he doubt it? Why should I
dialog: hide my regard?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: No particular reason, Marianne, only
dialog: that we know so little of him--
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: But time alone does not determine
dialog: intimacy. Seven years would be
dialog: insufficient to make some people
dialog: acquainted with each other and seven
dialog: days are more than enough for others.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Or seven hours in this case.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: I feel I know Mr Willoughby well
dialog: already. If I had weaker, more shallow
dialog: feelings perhaps I could conceal
dialog: them, as you do--
text: Then she realises what she's said.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Marianne, that is not fair--
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: I am sorry, Elinor, I did not mean
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: I know. Do not trouble yourself,
dialog: Marianne.
text: ELINOR turns back into the house.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: I do not understand her, Mamma. Why
dialog: does she never mention Edward? I
dialog: have never even seen her cry about
dialog: him, or about Norland.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Nor I. But Elinor is not like you or
dialog: I, dear. She does not like to be
text: swayed by her emotions.
scene_heading: INT. BARTON COTTAGE - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: CLOSE on Edward's handkerchief. We can see the monogram ECF
dialog: clearly.
text: CLOSE on ELINOR staring out of the window. Tears stand in
text: her eyes but she presses the handkerchief to them before
dialog: they fall.
scene_heading: INT. BARTON PARK - DRAWING ROOM - EVE
text: After dinner. Tea has been served. ELINOR, COLONEL BRANDON,
text: MRS DASHWOOD and MRS JENNINGS play at cards. In a far corner
text: of the room, MARIANNE is concentrating as she draws a
dialog: silhouette.
text: WILLOUGHBY's profile glows behind the screen in front of
text: her, She looks up and stops, gazing, bewitched, at his beauty.
text: The lips move--a whisper: Marianne. Then, louder: Haven't
text: you finished? He moves out from behind the screen, eyes full
text: of laughter. They look at each other.
scene_heading: INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY
text: ELINOR and MRS DASHWOOD are at the accounts. WILLOUGHBY and
text: MARIANNE are on the other side of the room in the window
text: seat, whispering together. Clearly, he is already part of
dialog: the family.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Surely you are not going to deny us
dialog: beef as well as sugar?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: There is nothing under tenpence a
dialog: pound. We have to economise.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Do you want us to starve?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: No. Just not to eat beef.
text: MRS DASHWOOD is silenced but sighs crossly. ELINOR looks
text: over to the lovers and sees WILLOUGHBY in the act of cutting
text: off a lock of MARIANNE's hair, which he kisses and places in
text: his pocket-book. ELINOR is transfixed by this strangely erotic
text: moment. WILLOUGHBY senses her gaze and looks over. She snaps
text: her head back to her sums and is astonished to find that she
text: has written 'Edward' at the top of the sheet. Hastily she
text: rubs it out and writes 'Expenses'.
scene_heading: EXT. BARTON CHURCH. DAY.
text: MRS JENNINGS is talking to the elderly CURATE. Other
text: PARISHIONERS exit the church as WILLOUGHBY's curricle (the
text: eighteenth-century equivalent of a sports car) goes flying
text: by. MARIANNE sits by his side, the picture of happiness. MRS
text: JENNINGS nudges the CURATE and whispers. The PARISHIONERS
text: stare after them and comment to each other.
scene_heading: EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN PATH - DAY
text: MARIANNE and ELINOR are coming down the path together.
text: MARIANNE is dressed to go out. The argument has evidently
dialog: started indoors and is being continued here.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: If there was any true impropriety in
dialog: my behaviour, I should be sensible
dialog: of it, Elinor--
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: But as it has already exposed you to
dialog: some very impertinent remarks, do
dialog: you not begin to doubt your own
dialog: discretion?
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: If the impertinent remarks of such
dialog: as Mrs Jennings are proof of
dialog: impropriety, then we are all offending
dialog: every moment of our lives--
text: The conversation is halted by the arrival of COLONEL BRANDON
text: on horseback.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: (dismounting)
dialog: Miss Dashwood! Miss Marianne!
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Good morning, Colonel!
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: I come to issue an invitation. A
dialog: picnic on my estate at Delaford--if
dialog: you would care to join us on Thursday
dialog: next. Mrs Jennings's daughter and
dialog: her husband are traveling up
dialog: especially.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Thank you, Colonel, we shall be
dialog: delighted.
text: At that moment, WILLOUGHBY's curricle hoves into view and
text: MARIANNE's face lights up.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: (to Marianne)
dialog: I will of course be including Mr
text: Willoughby in the party.
text: Even MARIANNE is a little embarrassed and recollects her
text: manners. She smiles kindly at BRANDON.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: I should be delighted to join you,
dialog: Colonel!
text: The COLONEL helps her into the curricle, exchanging nods
text: with WILLOUGHBY, who is regarding him with some suspicion.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: Good morning, Miss Dashwood; good
dialog: morning, Colonel.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: The Colonel has invited us to
dialog: Delaford, Willoughby!
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: Excellent. I understand you have a
dialog: particularly fine pianoforte, Colonel.
text: The undercurrents of this conversation are decidedly tense.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: A Broadwood Grand.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: A Broadwood Grand! Then I shall really
dialog: be able to play for you!
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: We shall look forward to it!
text: MARIANNE smiles her perfect happiness at him and he whips up
text: the horses. They drive off, waving their farewells.
text: BRANDON looks after them for a silent moment, and then
text: collects himself and turns to ELINOR, who is less than
text: satisfied with their behaviour.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: Your sister seems very happy.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Yes. Marianne does not approve of
dialog: hiding her emotions. In fact, her
dialog: romantic prejudices have the
dialog: unfortunate tendency to set propriety
text: at naught.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
text: She is wholly unspoilt.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Rather too unspoilt, in my view. The
text: sooner she becomes acquainted with
dialog: the ways of the world, the better.
text: COLONEL BRANDON looks at her sharply and then speaks very
text: deliberately, as though controlling some powerful emotion.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: I knew a lady like your sister--the
dialog: same impulsive sweetness of temper--
dialog: who was forced into, as you put it,
dialog: a better acquaintance with the world.
dialog: The result was only ruination and
dialog: despair.
text: He stops, and briskly remounts his horse.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: Do not desire it, Miss Dashwood.
scene_heading: EXT. BARTON PARK - DRIVE - DAY
text: People and carriages fill the drive, the sun shines and the
text: atmosphere is pleasantly expectant. SIR JOHN is organising
text: the provision of blankets and parasols and COLONEL BRANDON
text: is busy furnishing the DRIVERS with their routes. There are
text: three new faces a pretty, blowsy WOMAN (CHARLOTTE PALMER), a
text: stony-faced MAN (MR PALMER) and an exceedingly good-looking
text: GIRL (LUCY STEELE), who are standing with ELINOR, MARIANNE,
scene_heading: MARGARET, MRS JENNINGS and MRS DASHWOOD.
text: MARIANNE is standing slightly apart, looking out along the
text: road, impatient for WILLOUGHBY.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Imagine my surprise, Mrs Dashwood,
dialog: when Charlotte and her lord and master
dialog: appeared with our cousin Lucy! The
dialog: last person I expected to see! 'Where
dialog: did you pop out from, Miss?' says I.
dialog: I was never so surprised to see anyone
dialog: in all my life!
text: LUCY STEELE smiles shyly and looks at the ground. MRS JENNINGS
text: continues sotto voce to MRS DASHWOOD.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: She probably came on purpose to share
dialog: the fun, for there are no funds for
dialog: such luxuries at home, poor thing.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I had not seen you for so long, dear
dialog: Mrs Jennings, I could not resist the
dialog: opportunity.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Oh, you sly thing! It was the Misses
dialog: Dashwood she wanted to see, not
dialog: Delaford, Mamma! I have heard nothing
dialog: but 'Miss Dashwood this, Miss Dashwood
dialog: that' for I don't know how long! And
dialog: what do you think of them now you do
dialog: see them, Lucy? My mother has talked
dialog: of nothing else in her letters since
dialog: you came to Barton, Mrs Dashwood. Mr
dialog: Palmer--are they not the very
dialog: creatures she describes?
text: MR PALMER regards his wife with a less than enchanted
dialog: expression.
speaker_heading: MR PALMER
dialog: Nothing like.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: (laughing gaily)
dialog: Why, Mr Palmer! Do you know you are
dialog: quite rude today? He is to be an MP,
dialog: you know, Mrs Dashwood, and it is
dialog: very fatiguing for him for he is
dialog: forced to make everybody like him--
dialog: he says it is quite shocking--
speaker_heading: MRS PALMER
dialog: I never said anything so irrational.
dialog: Don't palm all your abuses of the
dialog: language upon me.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: (to Mrs Dashwood)
dialog: Mr Palmer is so droll--he is always
dialog: out of humour.
text: MR PALMER does indeed have the air of a man under siege.
text: WILLOUGH BY suddenly appears in his curricle. MARIANNE waves
text: to him with a radiant smile. MRS JENNINGS nudges CHARLOTTE
text: and points to MARIANNE.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Here he is! Now you shall see,
dialog: Charlotte.
text: WILLOUGHBY drives up as close to MARIANNE as possible, making
dialog: her laugh.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: How now, Mr Willoughby! You must
dialog: greet my daughter Charlotte, and Mr
dialog: Palmer--
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: How do you do?
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: And my little cousin, Miss Lucy
dialog: Steele.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: Welcome to our party, Miss Steele!
text: LUCY bobs demurely. WILLOUGHBY inclines his head politely,
text: leaps from the curricle and hands MARIANNE in. MRS JENNINGS
text: coos and chuckles at them. CHARLOTTE nudges ELINOR.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: I know Mr Willoughby extremely well--
dialog: not that I ever spoke to him but I
dialog: have seen him forever in town. Your
dialog: sister is monstrous lucky to get
dialog: him. Mamma says Colonel Brandon is
text: in love with her as well, which is a
dialog: very great compliment for he hardly
dialog: ever falls in love with anyone.
text: ELINOR smiles politely. WILLOUGHBY moves the curricle out to
text: the front of the drive. CHARLOTTE points after them and laughs
text: with MRS JENNINGS. LUCY edges up beside ELINOR.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: May I beg a seat beside you, Miss
dialog: Dashwood? I have so longed to make
dialog: your better acquaintance! I have
dialog: heard nothing but the highest praise
dialog: for you.
text: ELINOR is relieved to change the subject.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: I would be delighted. But Sir John
dialog: and Mrs Jennings are too excessive
dialog: in their compliments. I am sure to
dialog: disappoint.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: No, for it was from quite another
dialog: source that I heard you praised and
dialog: one not at all inclined to
dialog: exaggeration.
text: LUCY speaks in a knowing, confidential undertone, as though
text: not wanting anyone else to hear. At that moment a HORSEMAN
text: thunders up the drive towards them. Everyone turns to face
dialog: the new arrival.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: What can this be?
text: It is a MESSENGER who has obviously had a long, hard ride.
text: He asks for COLONEL BRANDON and hands him a letter, which
text: BRANDON tears open. MRS JENNINGS is puce with suppressed
dialog: curiosity.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: My horse! Quickly!
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: What is the matter, Brandon?
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: I must away to London.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: No! Impossible!
text: Everyone gathers round BRANDON, who is, naturally, mortified.
text: A SERVANT brings up the COLONEL's horse.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: Imperative.
text: There is a murmur of disappointment from the party. SIR JOHN
text: is embarrassed and protests again.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: But Brandon, we are all assembled.
dialog: We cannot picnic at Delaford without
dialog: our host! Go up to town tomorrow.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: Or wait till we return and start
dialog: then--you would not be six hours
dialog: later.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: I cannot afford to lose one minute.
text: As he speaks, he is mounting his horse. His grave urgency
text: silences all protest and he gallops off, leaving everyone
text: stunned and, of course, deeply curious. Then they all start
text: to talk at once. LUCY is still next to ELINOR.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Oh, Miss Dashwood, I cannot bear it!
dialog: Just when I was to have the
dialog: opportunity of speaking with you.
scene_heading: EXT. MEADOW NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY
text: Having been denied their trip, the DASHWOODS and WILLOUGHBY
text: have set out an impromptu picnic. WILLOUGHBY is wandering
text: restlessly about.
text: The weather is sublime.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: Frailty, thy name is Brandon!
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: There are some people who cannot
dialog: bear a party of pleasure. I think he
dialog: wrote the letter himself as a trick
dialog: for getting out of it.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: (indulgently)
dialog: You are a very wicked pair, Colonel
dialog: Brandon will be sadly missed.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: Why? When he is the kind of man that
dialog: everyone speaks well of and no one
dialog: wants to talk to.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Exactly!
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Nonsense.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Colonel Brandon is very highly
dialog: esteemed at the Park.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: Which is enough censure in itself.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: (half laughing)
dialog: Really, Willoughby!
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: (imitating Mrs Jennings
dialog: perfectly)
dialog: Come, come, Mr Impudence--I know you
dialog: and your wicked ways--oh!
text: He gives a little shriek and waddles about the garden doing
text: her walk. He comes up to ELINOR and puts his head on her
dialog: shoulder.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: Come, Miss Dashwood, reveal your
dialog: beau, reveal him, I say! Let's have
dialog: no secrets between friends! Let me
dialog: winkle them out of you!
text: ELINOR hits him on the nose with her teaspoon and he waddles
text: off to MARIANNE.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: (as Mrs Jennings)
dialog: I declare, Miss Marianne, if I do
dialog: not have you married to the Colonel
dialog: by teatime, I shall swallow my own
dialog: bonnet.
text: MARIANNE laughs. WILLOUGHBY drops the parody suddenly.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: As if you could marry such a
dialog: character.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Why should you dislike him?
text: There is indeed an edge to WILLOUGHBY's raillery. He flicks
text: ELINOR an almost alarmed glance and then sweeps MARIANNE to
text: her feet and starts to dance around the garden with her.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: Because he has threatened me with
dialog: rain when I wanted it fine, he has
dialog: found fault with the balance of my
dialog: curricle and I cannot persuade him
dialog: to buy my brown mare. If it will be
dialog: of any satisfaction to you, however,
dialog: to be told I believe his character
dialog: to be in all other respects
dialog: irreproachable, I am ready to confess
dialog: it. And in return for an
dialog: acknowledgement that must give me
dialog: some pain.
dialog: (he is slowing down)
dialog: You cannot deny me the privilege...
dialog: (slower still)
dialog: of disliking him...
dialog: (and stopping)
dialog: as much as I adore...
text: He and MARIANNE are standing looking at each other. The
text: expression on WILLOUGHBY's face is heart-stopping. MARGARET
text: has stopped eating and is staring with her mouth open.
text: ELINOR glances at MRS DASHWOOD but she is gazing up at them
text: with almost as many stars in her eyes as MARIANNE.
text: Suddenly WILLOUGHBY breaks the mood by swinging away from
text: MARIANNE and gesturing to the house.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: --this cottage!
text: The tension is broken. MARGARET starts to chew again.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: I have great plans for improvements
dialog: to it, you know, Mr Willoughby.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: Now that I will never consent to.
dialog: Not a stone must be added to its
dialog: walls. Were I rich enough, I would
text: instantly pull down Combe Magna and
dialog: build it up again in the exact image
dialog: of that cottage!
speaker_heading: ELINOR
text: With dark, narrow stairs, a poky
dialog: hall and a fire that smokes?
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: Especially the fire that smokes!
dialog: Then I might be as happy at Combe
dialog: Magna as I have been at Barton.
text: He looks at MARIANNE, who has gone to sit at her mother's
dialog: feet.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: But this place has one claim on my
dialog: affection which no other can possibly
dialog: share.
text: MARIANNE is so irradiated with happiness that she looks like
text: an angel.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: Promise me you will never change it.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: I do not have the heart.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Or the money.
scene_heading: EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN PATH AND GATE - DUSK
text: MARIANNE is seeing WILLOUGHBY off.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: Miss Marianne, will you--will you do
dialog: me the honour of granting me an
dialog: interview tomorrow--alone?
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Willoughby, we are always alone!
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: But there is something very particular
dialog: I should like to ask you.
text: There is something about his formal tone that makes her feel
dialog: shy.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Of course. I shall ask Mamma if I
dialog: may stay behind from church.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: Thank you. Until tomorrow then--Miss
dialog: Marianne.
text: He mounts Bedivere and leaves. MARIANNE looks after him, her
text: eyes shining. He is coming to propose.
scene_heading: EXT. LONDON TENEMENTS - NIGHT
text: A district of extreme poverty, populated by the LOWLIFE of
text: LONDON: FOOTPADS, dogs, rats and SCAVENGERS of all kinds. In
text: the distance a tavern belches forth drunken REVELLERS who
text: sway and reel into the night.
text: A hooded HORSEMAN pulls up his exhausted steed at the entrance
text: to a slum. He dismounts and looks up at one of the windows.
text: The rags hanging there twitch as if someone is watching for
text: him. He strides inside.
scene_heading: INT. TENEMENT STAIRS - NIGHT
text: Stepping over a supine BEGGAR at the foot of the stairs, the
text: HORSEMAN flings back his hood--it is BRANDON, hollow-eyed
text: and dropping with weariness. We follow him up the stairs to
text: a door which is opened by an OLDER WOMAN.
scene_heading: INT. TENEMENT ROOM - NIGHT
text: He enters a bare room partitioned with filthy rags hung from
text: the ceiling and lit with stinking tallow lamps. At the window
text: stands the slight figure of a VERY YOUNG WOMAN. She turns.
text: BRANDON reacts with a tender smile which stiffens into an
text: expression of deep shock. We see her silhouette. She is
text: heavily pregnant. She bursts into tears and runs into his
dialog: arms.
scene_heading: INT. BARTON CHURCH - DAY
text: Amongst the small CONGREGATION listening to the sermon drone
text: on, we see the excited faces of ELINOR, MARGARET and MRS
scene_heading: DASHWOOD.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Do you think he will kneel down when
dialog: he asks her?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Shhh!
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (with satisfaction)
dialog: They always kneel down.
scene_heading: EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN PATH - DAY
text: The DASHWOODS return from church to find THOMAS grooming
text: Bedivere at the garden gate. Their excitement mounts.
scene_heading: INT. BARTON COTTAGE - FRONT DOOR - DAY
text: They all enter the cottage, talking nonsense loudly in order
text: to signal their presence. MARGARET giggles. Suddenly, MARIANNE
text: bursts out of the parlour sobbing, and disappears into the
text: room opposite. ELINOR and MARGARET stand by the door in utter
text: consternation, while MRS DASH- WOOD goes to MARIANNE.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: What is wrong, my dearest?
text: MARIANNE shakes her head and waves them away.
scene_heading: INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY
text: ELINOR, MARGARET and MRS DASHWOOD enter to find WILLOUGHBY
text: standing in a frozen attitude by the fireplace.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Willoughby! What is the matter?
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: I--forgive me, Mrs Dashwood. I am
dialog: sent--that is to say, Lady Allen has
dialog: exercised the privilege of riches
text: upon a dependent cousin and is sending
dialog: me to London.
text: He cannot look any of them in the eye.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: When--this morning?
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: Almost this moment.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: How very disappointing! But your
dialog: business will not detain you from us
dialog: for long, I hope?
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: You are very kind--but I have no
dialog: idea of returning immediately to
dialog: Devonshire. I am seldom invited to
dialog: Allenham more than once a year.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: For shame, Willoughby! Can you wait
dialog: for an invitation from Barton Cottage?
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: My engagements at present are of
dialog: such a nature--that is--I dare not
dialog: flatter myself--
text: The atmosphere is thick with tension. WILLOUGHBY flicks a
text: glance at the three WOMEN staring at him in mute astonishment.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: It is folly to linger in this manner.
dialog: I will not torment myself further.
text: He rushes past them and out of the cottage. They follow him
text: to the door.
scene_heading: EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - FRONT DOOR - DAY
text: The DASHWOODS cluster round the door.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Willoughby, come back!
text: She is silenced by ELINOR as WILLOUGHBY seizes Bedivere's
text: reins from THOMAS, mounts up and rides off at a furious pace.
scene_heading: INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY
text: They all rush back into the parlour.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Meg, dearest, please ask Betsy to
dialog: make a cup of hot tea for Marianne.
text: MARGARET nods dumbly and goes. MRS DASHWOOD has her arms
text: around MARIANNE.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: What is wrong, my love?
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Nothing! Please do not ask me
dialog: questions!
text: MARIANNE struggles free.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Please let me be!
text: She runs off upstairs and we hear her bedroom door slamming.
text: There is a moment of stunned silence.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: They must have quarreled.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: That is unlikely. Perhaps this--Lady
dialog: Allen--disapproves of his regard for
dialog: Marianne and has invented an excuse
dialog: to send him away?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Then why did he not say as much? It
dialog: is not like Willoughby to be
dialog: secretive. Did he think Marianne was
dialog: richer than she is?
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: How could he?
text: She gestures to the room and then looks at ELINOR with a
dialog: frown.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: What is it you suspect him of?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: I can hardly tell you. But why was
dialog: his manner so guilty?
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: What are you saying, Elinor? That he
dialog: has been acting a part to your sister
dialog: for all this time?
text: MRS DASHWOOD is getting defensive. ELINOR pauses to think.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: No, he loves her, I am sure.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Of course he loves her!
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: But has he left her with any assurance
dialog: of his return? Cannot you ask her if
dialog: he has proposed?
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Certainly not. I cannot force a
dialog: confidence from Marianne and nor
dialog: must you. We must trust her to confide
dialog: in us in her own time.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: There was something so underhand in
text: the manner of his leaving.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: You are resolved, then, to think the
dialog: worst of him.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Not resolved--
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: (cold)
dialog: I prefer to give him the benefit of
dialog: my good opinion. He deserves no less.
dialog: From all of us.
text: She stalks out of the room and starts up the stairs. ELINOR
text: follows her.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Mamma, I am very fond of Willoughby--
text: MRS DASHWOOD goes into her bedroom and shuts the door. ELINOR
text: is halfway up the stairs. She meets a wet-eyed MARGARET coming
text: down with a cup of tea.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: She would not let me in.
text: ELINOR takes the cup and MARGARET runs out into the garden
text: in tears.
text: The sound of sobbing also comes from MARIANNE's room, and
text: now from MRS DASHWOOD's as well. ELINOR sits down helplessly
text: on the stairs and drinks the tea.
scene_heading: EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - RAIN - DAY
text: The rain has settled in. The cottage looks cold and bleak.
scene_heading: INT. BARTON COTTAGE - UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY
text: BETSY carries another uneaten meal from MARIANNE's room. She
text: looks at the food and tuts in anxiety.
scene_heading: INT. BARTON COTTAGE - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: MARIANNE is sitting by the window looking out at the rain
text: through tear-swollen eyes. WILLOUGHBY's sonnets are on her
dialog: lap.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: How like a winter hath my absence
dialog: been from thee, the pleasure of the
dialog: fleeting year! What freezings have I
dialog: felt, what dark days seen! What old
dialog: December's bareness everywhere!
scene_heading: EXT. BARTON PARK - RAIN - EVE
text: Smoke issues from every chimney in the place.
scene_heading: INT. BARTON PARK - DRAWING ROOM - EVE
text: Dinner is over. MARIANNE sits listlessly by the window. MR

dialog: If only you would stop.
text: MRS JENNINGS and CHARLOTTE laugh at him.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: 'Twas you took her off my hands, Mr
dialog: Palmer, and a very good bargain you
dialog: made of it too, but now I have the
dialog: whip hand over you for you cannot
dialog: give her back!
text: The heavy silence behind the paper attests to the unhappy
dialog: truth of this statement.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Miss Marianne, come and play a round
dialog: with us! Looking out at the weather
dialog: will not bring him back.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: (sotto voce)
dialog: She ate nothing at dinner.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Mind, we are all a little forlorn
dialog: these days. London has swallowed all
dialog: our company.
text: CHARLOTTE and MRS JENNINGS start to gossip about the
text: disappearances of BRANDON and WILLOUGHBY. LUCY walks over
text: and sits by ELINOR, who politely puts aside the book.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: (low)
dialog: Dear Miss Dashwood, perhaps now we
dialog: might have our--discussion.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Our discussion?
text: LUCY looks around at MRS JENNINGS and lowers her voice still
text: further, so that ELINOR is obliged to move her chair nearer.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: There is a particular question I
dialog: have long wanted to ask you, but
dialog: perhaps you will think me impertinent?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: I cannot imagine so.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: But it is an odd question. Forgive
dialog: me, I have no wish to trouble you--
text: She looks away coyly as if deciding whether to speak.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: My dear Miss Steele--
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Miss Dashwood, if only Mr Willoughby
dialog: had gone home to Combe Magna, we
dialog: could have taken Miss Marianne to
dialog: see him! For we live but half a mile
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: MR PALMER
dialog: Five and a half.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: No, I cannot believe it is that far,
dialog: for you can see the place from the
dialog: top of our hill. Is it really five
dialog: and a half miles? No! I cannot believe
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MR PALMER
dialog: Try.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: You have my permission to ask any
dialog: manner of question, if that is of
dialog: any help.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Thank you. I wonder, are you at all
dialog: acquainted with your sister-in-law's
dialog: mother? Mrs Ferrars?
text: ELINOR sits back in deep surprise.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: With Fanny's mother? No, I have never
dialog: met her.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I am sure you think me strange for
dialog: inquiring--if I dared tell--
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: (shouting over)
dialog: If she tells you aught of the famous
dialog: 'Mr F', Lucy, you are to pass it on.
text: ELINOR tries to ignore MRS JENNINGS, who is keeping a curious
text: eye on them.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Will you take a turn with me, Miss
dialog: Dashwood?
text: LUCY rises and takes ELINOR's arm. She guides her as far
text: away as possible from MRS JENNINGS and CHARLOTTE.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: I had no idea at all that you were
dialog: connected with that family.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Oh! I am certainly nothing to Mrs
dialog: Ferrars at present--but the time may
dialog: come when we may be very intimately
dialog: connected.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: (low)
dialog: What do you mean? Do you have an
dialog: understanding with Fanny's brother
dialog: Robert?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: The youngest? No, I never saw him in
dialog: my life. No, with Edward.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Edward?
text: ELINOR stops walking.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Edward Ferrars?
text: LUCY nods.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Edward and I have been secretly
dialog: engaged these five years.
text: ELINOR is frozen to the spot.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: You may well be surprised. I should
dialog: never have mentioned it, had I not
dialog: known I could entirely trust you to
dialog: keep our secret. Edward cannot mind
dialog: me telling you for he looks on you
text: quite as his own sister.
text: ELINOR walks on mechanically. Disbelief has set in.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: I am sorry, but we surely--we cannot
dialog: mean the same Mr Ferrars?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: The very same--he was four years
dialog: under the tutelage of my uncle Mr
dialog: Pratt, down in Plymouth. Has he never
dialog: spoken of it?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: (awareness dawning)
dialog: Mr Pratt! Yes, I believe he has.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I was very unwilling to enter into
dialog: it without his mother's approval but
dialog: we loved each other with too great a
dialog: passion for prudence. Though you do
dialog: nor know him so well as I, Miss
dialog: Dashwood, you must have seen how
dialog: capable he is of making a woman
dialog: sincerely attached to him. I cannot
dialog: pretend it has not been very hard on
dialog: us both. We can hardly meet above
dialog: twice a year.
text: She sniffs and produces a large handkerchief which she holds
text: to her eyes so that the monogram is clearly visible. ECF.
text: ELINOR, seeing the copy of the handkerchief she has held so
text: dear, moves quickly to a chair and sits down.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: You seem out of sorts, Miss Dashwood--
dialog: are you quite well?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Perfectly well, thank you.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I have not offended you?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: On the contrary.
text: MRS JENNINGS has been watching. Now she rises, unable to
dialog: contain herself.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: I can stand it no longer, I must
dialog: know what you are saying, Lucy! Miss
text: Dashwood is quite engrossed!
text: MRS JENNINGS starts to bear down on them. LUCY whispers with
dialog: real urgency.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Oh, Miss Dashwood, if anyone finds
dialog: out, it will ruin him--you must not
dialog: tell a soul! Edward says you would
dialog: not break your word to save your
dialog: life! Promise me!
text: ECU on ELINOR's face.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: I give you my word.
text: MRS JENNINGS looms over them.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Well, what can have fascinated you
dialog: to such an extent, Miss Dashwood?
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Tell us all!
text: ELINOR cannot speak but LUCY glides smoothly in.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: We were talking of London, ma'am,
dialog: and all its--diversions.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Do you hear, Charlotte?
text: MRS JENNINGS claps her hands delightedly.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: While you were so busy whispering,
dialog: Charlotte and I have concocted a
dialog: plan!
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: It is the best plan in the world.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: I make for London shortly and I invite
dialog: you, Lucy, and both the Misses
dialog: Dashwood to join me!
text: ELINOR cannot hide her dismay. MARIANNE springs from her
dialog: seat.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: London!
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Oh, can I go! Can I go?
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: You know perfectly well you are too
dialog: young, dearest.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: I shall convey you all to my house
dialog: in Berkeley Street and we shall taste
dialog: all the delights of the season--what
dialog: say you?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Oh, please can I go? I'm twelve soon.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Mr Palmer, do you not long to have
dialog: the Misses Dashwood come to London?
speaker_heading: MR PALMER
dialog: I came into Devonshire with no other
dialog: view.
text: ELINOR exerts herself.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Mrs Jennings, you are very kind, but
dialog: we cannot possibly leave our mother...
text: LUCY's calculating eyes turn to MRS DASHWOOD with alacrity.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Indeed, the loss would be too great.
text: A chorus of objections goes up, particularly from MRS
text: DASHWOOD, who is both delighted and relieved to see MARIANNE
text: with a smile on her face.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Your mother can spare you very well.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Of course I can!
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Of course she can!
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: And look at Miss Marianne--it would
dialog: break her heart to deny her!
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: I will brook no refusal, Miss
dialog: Dashwood!
text: MARIANNE claps her hands, her eyes ablaze with joy. MRS
text: JENNINGS takes ELINOR's hand.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Let you and me strike hands upon the
dialog: bargain--and if I do not have the
dialog: three of you married by Christmas,
dialog: it will not be my fault!
scene_heading: INT. BARTON COTTAGE - ELINOR/MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: We are in ELINOR and MARIANNE's bedroom. ELINOR is in bed.
text: She is lying on her side with her back to MARIANNE. We are
text: CLOSE on her face. MARIANNE is running around excitedly,
text: pulling out ribbons, looking at dresses, etc.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: I was never so grateful in all my
dialog: life as I am to Mrs Jennings. What a
dialog: kind woman she is! I like her more
dialog: than I can say. Oh, Elinor! I shall
dialog: see Willoughby. Think how surprised
dialog: he will be! And you will see Edward!
speaker_heading: ELINOR cannot reply.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Are you asleep?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: With you in the room?
text: MARIANNE laughs.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: I do not believe you feel as calm as
dialog: you look, not even you, Elinor. I
dialog: will never sleep tonight! Oh, what
dialog: were you and Miss Steele whispering
dialog: about so long?
text: CLOSE on ELINOR's expression as she struggles with the
text: impossibility of unburdening herself to her sister without
text: breaking her promise to LUCY. After a pause--
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Nothing of significance.
text: MARIANNE looks at ELINOR curiously, then returns to her
dialog: packing.
scene_heading: EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN GATE - DAY
text: MRS DASHWOOD and MARGARET are waving MRS JENNINGS's carriage
text: off. MARIANNE waves back with such exuberance that she
text: practically falls out.
scene_heading: INT. MRS JENNINGS'S CARRIAGE - ROAD TO LONDON - DAY
text: MRS JENNINGS is chattering about London to MARIANNE, who
text: listens with new-found tolerance. LUCY is whispering into
text: ELINOR's ear.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I have written to Edward, Miss
dialog: Dashwood, and yet I do not know how
dialog: much I may see of him. Secrecy is
dialog: vital--he will never be able to call.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: I should imagine not.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: It is so hard. I believe my only
dialog: comfort has been the constancy of
dialog: his affection.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: You are fortunate, over such a lengthy
dialog: engagement, never to have had any
dialog: doubts on that score.
text: LUCY looks at ELINOR sharply, but ELINOR is impassive.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Oh! I am of rather a jealous nature
dialog: and if he had talked more of one
dialog: young lady than any other... but he
dialog: has never given a moment's alarm on
dialog: that count.
text: We can see from ELINOR's expression that she understands
text: LUCY perfectly. The strain around her eyes is pronounced.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Imagine how glad he will be to learn
dialog: that we are friends!
scene_heading: EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY
text: MRS JENNINGS's carriage trundles along.
scene_heading: EXT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - LONDON - DAY
text: Establishing shot of a handsome town house. MRS JENNINGS's
text: carriage comes into shot and stops in front of it.
scene_heading: INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - HALL - DAY
text: They enter the grand hallway under the supercilious gaze of
text: a powdered FOOTMAN (MR PIGEON). ELINOR is haggard after two
text: days of close proximity with LUCY. MRS JENNINGS is all
text: officious bustle and MARIANNE is feverish with anticipation.
text: She whispers to MRS JENNINGS, who laughs heartily.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: To be sure, my dear, you must just
dialog: hand it to Pigeon there. He will
dialog: take care of it.
text: MARIANNE hands a letter to the sphinx-like FOOTMAN. We can
text: see a large W in the address. ELINOR looks at MARIANNE
text: inquiringly but MARIANNE moves away from her.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Lord above, you do not waste any
dialog: time, Miss Marianne!
text: MARIANNE glances self-consciously at ELINOR and follows MRS
text: JENNINGS upstairs. LUCY goes up to ELINOR and whispers.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: A letter! So they are definitely
dialog: engaged! Mrs Jennings says your sister
dialog: will buy her wedding clothes here in
dialog: town.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Indeed Miss Steele, I know of no
dialog: such plan.
text: But ELINOR does not know what else to say. She marches firmly
dialog: upstairs.
scene_heading: INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY
text: MARIANNE and ELINOR have changed from their traveling clothes
text: and are having a cup of tea. At least, ELINOR is. MARIANNE
text: is pacing up and down in front of the window.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: John and Fanny are in town. I think
dialog: we shall be forced to see them.
text: There is a faint knocking from somewhere. MARIANNE jumps.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: I think it was for next door.
text: MARIANNE looks out of the window.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Yes, you are right.
text: She sits down with a rueful smile. Suddenly a much louder
text: rap is heard and they both jump. We hear a bustling
text: downstairs. MARIANNE can hardly breathe. She goes to the
text: drawing-room door, opens it, goes out, comes back in. We
text: hear a MAN's voice.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Oh, Elinor! It is Willoughby, indeed
dialog: it is!
text: She turns and almost throws herself into the arms of COLONEL
speaker_heading: BRANDON.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Oh! Excuse me, Colonel--
text: She leaves the room hastily. ELINOR is so ashamed of
text: MARIANNE's rudeness that she does not at first notice
text: BRANDON's mood of tense distress.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Colonel Brandon, what a pleasure to
dialog: see you! Have you been in London all
dialog: this while?
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: I have. How is your dear mother?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Very well, thank you.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Colonel, is there anything--
text: But BRANDON interrupts her.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: Forgive me, Miss Dashwood, but I
dialog: have heard reports through town...
dialog: is it impossible to--but I could
dialog: have no chance of succeeding--indeed
dialog: I hardly know what to do. Tell me
dialog: once and for all, is everything
dialog: finally resolved between your sister
dialog: and Mr Willoughby?
text: ELINOR is torn between discomfiture and compassion.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Colonel, though neither one has
dialog: informed me of their under standing,
dialog: I have no doubt of their mutual
dialog: affection.
text: BRANDON stands very still.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: Thank you, Miss Dashwood. To your
dialog: sister I wish all imaginable
dialog: happiness. To Mr Willoughby, that
dialog: he... may endeavour to deserve her.
text: His tone is heavy with some bitter meaning.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: What do you mean?
text: But he recollects himself.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: Forgive me, I--forgive me.
text: He bows and leaves abruptly. ELINOR is deeply troubled.
scene_heading: EXT. GREENWICH ARCADE - LONDON - DAY
scene_heading: The PALMERS, MRS JENNINGS, JOHN, FANNY, LUCY, ELINOR and
text: MARIANNE are walking through the arcade. Additional wealth
text: has evidently encouraged FANNY sartorially and she sprouts
text: as much fruit and feathers as a market stall. LUCY is holding
text: ELINOR's arm in a pinionlike grip. MRS JENNINGS is gossiping
text: with CHARLOTTE.
text: MARIANNE's good looks are heightened by her feverish
text: expectation of seeing WILLOUGHBY at every step, and many
text: young men raise their hats to her and turn as she passes.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Where is dear Edward, John? We expect
dialog: to see him daily.
text: FANNY stiffens. LUCY's sharp eyes dart hither and thither.
text: MRS JENNINGS senses gossip. ELINOR steels herself.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: And who is 'dear Edward'?
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Who indeed?
text: FANNY smiles glacially.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: My brother, Mrs Jennings--Edward
dialog: Ferrars.
text: MRS JENNINGS looks at ELINOR in sly triumph.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Indeed! Is that Ferrars with an F?
text: She and CHARLOTTE chuckle to each other. LUCY looks at ELINOR.
scene_heading: INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - HALL - EVE
text: MRS JENNINGS, LUCY, ELINOR and MARIANNE return from their
text: outing. MARIANNE immediately assails PIGEON.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Are there any messages, Pigeon?
speaker_heading: PIGEON
dialog: No, ma'am.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: No message at all? No cards?
speaker_heading: PIGEON
dialog: (affronted)
dialog: None, ma am.
text: MARIANNE sighs with disappointment and starts up the stairs.
text: MRS JENNINGS looks archly at ELINOR.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: I note you do not inquire for your
dialog: messages, Miss Dashwood!
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: No, for I do not expect any, Mrs
dialog: Jennings. I have very little
text: acquaintance in town.
text: And she follows MARIANNE firmly upstairs. LUCY watches her
text: go, and MRS JENNINGS chuckles and turns to her.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: She is as sly as you, Lucy!
scene_heading: INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: ELINOR wakes up. The flickering of a candle has disturbed
text: her. She sits up in bed and sees MARIANNE sitting at the
text: desk in her nightgown, writing another letter.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Marianne, is anything wrong?
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Nothing at all. Go back to sleep.
scene_heading: INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - MORNING ROOM - NIGHT
text: MARIANNE, in her nightclothes and dressing gown, paces
text: restlessly, her letter in her hands. A slight knock at the
text: door heralds a much-ruffled PIGEON, wig askew. MARIANNE hands
text: him the letter. He bows and goes, highly disgruntled.
scene_heading: INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - HALL - MORNING
text: MRS JENNINGS is giving PIGEON his instructions for the day.
text: MARIANNE comes running downstairs. PIGEON regards her drily.
speaker_heading: PIGEON
dialog: No messages, ma am.
text: MARIANNE looks so dejected that MRS JENNINGS takes her hand.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Do not fret, my dear. I am told that
dialog: this good weather is keeping many
dialog: sportsmen in the country at present,
dialog: but the frost will drive them back
dialog: to town very soon, depend upon it.
text: MARIANNE brightens.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Of course! I had not thought of--
dialog: thank you, Mrs Jennings!
text: She runs back upstairs. MRS JENNINGS calls after her.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: And Miss Dashwood may set her heart
dialog: at rest, for I overheard your sister-
dialog: in-law say that she was to bring the
dialog: elusive Mr F to the ball tonight!
scene_heading: EXT. GRAND CRESCENT LEADING TO BALLROOM ENTRANCE - NIGHT
text: So many carriages have entered the crescent to deliver the
text: GUESTS that gridlock has occurred and people are forced to
text: walk to the entrance. We see MRS JENNINGS, MARIANNE, ELINOR
text: and LUCY alighting from their carriage and picking their way
text: through the mud, their skirts raised above their ankles.
text: ELINOR nearly trips and is obliged to grab onto LUCY in order
dialog: not to slip into the dirt.
scene_heading: INT. GRAND BALLROOM - EVE
text: The great ballroom is crammed with GUESTS all determined to
dialog: enjoy themselves despite the considerable inconveniences
text: caused by noise, heat and overcrowding. MEN are sweating
text: profusely, WOMEN dab their brows, rack punch is being
text: swallowed by the gallon, flirting is conducted at fever pitch
text: and all conversation is inordinately loud. Only the DANCERS
text: have a modicum of space in which to perform their mincing
text: steps. MRS JENNINGS and her brood bump into the PALMERS.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: (screeching)
dialog: This is very merry!
text: MRS JENNINGS then spots FANNY, who is conducting a desultory
text: conversation with an overpowdered ACQUAINTANCE. She drags
text: ELINOR, MARIANNE and LUCY over to her.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: There you are! Goodness, how hot it
dialog: is, Mrs Dashwood. You are not alone,
dialog: I trust?
speaker_heading: FANNY
text: Indeed not. John is just gone to
dialog: fetch my brother--he has been eating
dialog: ices.
text: LUCY clutches at ELINOR's sleeve.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Your brother! I declare, that is
dialog: good news indeed. At long last!
text: And she beams her approval upon ELINOR.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Miss Dashwood, I declare I shall
text: faint clean away.
text: FANNY has seen JOHN threading his way towards them and waves
text: at him. There is someone behind him. LUCY preens. JOHN bows
dialog: to them.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Mrs Jennings, may I present my brother-
dialog: in-law?
text: He turns to reveal a good-looking young MAN with a vacuous
dialog: smile.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Mr Robert Ferrars!
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: My dear ladies--we meet at last!
text: There is a general bowing and shaking of hands. ELINOR is
text: relieved. LUCY drops a low curtsy.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: So you must be the younger brother?
dialog: Is Mr Edward not here? Miss Dashwood
dialog: here was counting on him!
text: ROBERT looks ELINOR up and down. He exchanges glances with
text: FANNY before he speaks.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Oh! He is far too busy for such
dialog: gatherings--and has no special
dialog: acquaintance here to make his
dialog: attendance worthwhile.
text: MRS JENNINGS looks at ELINOR in puzzlement.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Well, I declare, I do not know what
dialog: the young men are about these days--
dialog: are they all in hiding?
text: ELINOR looks down, agonised with embarrassment.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Come, Mr Robert, in the absence of
dialog: your brother, you must dance with
dialog: our lovely Miss Dashwood!
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: (not best pleased)
dialog: It would be my honour.
text: He turns to LUCY and bows.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: And perhaps Miss Steele might consider
dialog: reserving the allemande?
text: LUCY curtsies again. ROBERT escorts a most unwilling ELINOR
text: onto the dance floor.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: You reside in Devonshire, I b'lieve,
dialog: Miss Dashwood?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: We do.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: In a cottage?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: I am excessively fond of a cottage.
dialog: If I had any money to spare, I should
dialog: build one myself.
text: Luckily for ELINOR the set changes and she is obliged to
text: turn away from ROBERT. She wheels round to face her new
text: partner. It is WILLOUGHBY! They both stop dancing and stare
text: at each other aghast. A traffic jam starts and they are forced
text: to take hands and resume the steps.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: (stiff)
dialog: How do you do, Miss Dashwood?
text: ELINOR does not know quite how to respond.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: I am well, thank you, Mr Willoughby.
text: She looks about for MARIANNE, instinctively wanting to keep
text: her away from WILLOUGHBY.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: How is your--family?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: (cold)
dialog: We are all extremely well, Mr
dialog: Willoughby--thank you for your kind
dialog: inquiry.
text: WILLOUGHBY is shamed into silence. Then he sees MARIANNE. At
text: the same moment the music pauses. MARIANNE looks up. In the
text: brief moment of relative quiet, her great cry rings across
dialog: the room.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Willoughby!
text: Everyone turns to look as MARIANNE rushes towards him with
text: both arms outstretched, her face luminous with joy. As the
text: noise of the room builds again and PEOPLE change their
text: partners, we are aware that many are surreptitiously watching.
text: MARIANNE reaches him but WILLOUGHBY stands with his arms
text: frozen at his side. MARIANNE gives a little confused laugh.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Good God, Willoughby! Will you nor
dialog: shake hands with me?
text: WILLOUGHBY looks extremely uncomfortable and glances towards
text: a group of very smart PEOPLE who are watching him closely.
text: Central to this group is a SOPHISTICATED WOMAN who frowns at
text: him proprietorially.
text: WILLOUGHBY shakes MARIANNE's hand briefly. Behind her, MRS
text: JENNINGS is giving an animated commentary to FANNY and JOHN,
text: while LUCY whispers in ROBERT's ear as they go past to join
dialog: the set.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: (strangled)
dialog: How do you do, Miss Marianne?
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Willoughby, what is the matter? Why
dialog: have you not come to see me? Were
dialog: you not in London? Have you nor
dialog: received my letters?
text: WILLOUGHBY is sweating with tension.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: Yes, I had the pleasure of receiving
dialog: the information which you were so
dialog: good as to send me.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: (piteously)
dialog: For heaven's sake, Willoughby, tell
dialog: me what is wrong!
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: Thank you--I am most obliged. If you
dialog: will excuse me, I must return to my
dialog: party.
text: He bows, white to the teeth, and walks away to join the
scene_heading: SOPHISTICATED WOMAN.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Willoughby!
text: He is drawn away by his PARTY, some of whom look back at
text: MARIANNE with a mixture of curiosity and condescension.
text: MARIANNE almost sinks to her knees. ELINOR supports her.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Marianne! Come away!
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Go to him, Elinor--force him to come
dialog: to me.
text: MRS JENNINGS has come up, full of concern.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Dearest, do not betray what you feel
dialog: to everyone present! This is not the
dialog: place for explanations--
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Come along, dear.
text: They almost have to drag MARIANNE away. MRS JENNINGS turns
text: back to the DASHWOOD party. FANNY and JOHN have practically
text: imploded with embarrassment and are distancing themselves as
text: much as possible from the source. LUCY and ROBERT are dancing
dialog: nearby.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Will you come, Lucy?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Oh, are we leaving so soon?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: If I might be so bold, Mrs Jennings,
dialog: it would be our pleasure to escort
dialog: your young charge home.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: How very kind!
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: That is very handsome--
text: She rushes off to follow MARIANNE and ELINOR. We stay for a
text: moment with LUCY and ROBERT who have left the set.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: She actually sent him messages during
dialog: the night?
text: CAM rises to show the DASHWOODS exiting past the whispering,
text: sneering faces of the CROWD.
scene_heading: INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: MARIANNE sits scribbling a letter at the desk.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Marianne, please tell me--
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Do not ask me questions!
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: You have no confidence in me.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: This reproach from you! You, who
text: confide in no one.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: I have nothing to tell.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Nor I. We have neither of us anything
dialog: to tell. I because I conceal nothing
dialog: and you because you communicate
dialog: nothing.
scene_heading: INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY
text: A silent breakfast. MARIANNE is red-eyed from crying and
text: limp from lack of sleep. MRS JENNINGS is dressed to go out,
text: pulling on her gloves and bustling as usual. PIGEON enters
text: with a letter on a salver. He offers it to MARIANNE. She
text: seizes it and runs out of the room. MRS JENNINGS chuckles.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: There now! Lovers' quarrels are swift
dialog: to heal! That letter will do the
dialog: trick, mark my word.
text: She goes to the door.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: I must be off. I hope he won't keep
dialog: her waiting much longer, Miss
text: Dashwood. It hurts to see her looking
text: so forlorn.
text: She leaves and ELINOR finds herself alone with LUCY, who
text: loses no time in sharing her new-found happiness.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: What a welcome I had from Edward's
dialog: family, Miss Dashwood--I am surprised
dialog: you never told me what an agreeable
dialog: woman your sister-in-law is! And Mr
dialog: Robert--all so affable!
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: It is perhaps fortunate that none of
dialog: them knows of your engagement. Excuse
dialog: me.
text: ELINOR rises and leaves.
scene_heading: INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
text: ELINOR finds MARIANNE sitting on the edge of the bed. She
text: does not acknowledge ELINOR but merely lifts the letter and
text: reads out, with deadly calm:
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: 'My dear Madam--I am quite at a loss
dialog: to discover in what point I could be
dialog: so unfortunate as to offend you. My
dialog: esteem for your family is very sincere
dialog: but if I have given rise to a belief
dialog: of more than I felt or meant to
dialog: express, I shall reproach myself for
dialog: not having been more guarded. My
dialog: affections have long been engaged
dialog: elsewhere and it is with great regret
dialog: that I return your letters and the
dialog: lock of hair which you so obligingly
dialog: bestowed upon me. I am etc. John
dialog: Willoughby.'
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Oh, Marianne.
text: MARIANNE gives a great howl of pain and flings herself across
text: the bed as though in physical agony.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Marianne, oh, Marianne--it is better
dialog: to know at once what his intentions
dialog: are. Dearest, think of what you would
dialog: have felt if your engagement had
dialog: carried on for months and months
dialog: before he chose to put an end to it.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: We are not engaged.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: But you wrote to him! I thought then
dialog: that he must have left you with some
dialog: kind of understanding?
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: No--he is not so unworthy as you
dialog: think him.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Not so unworthy! Did he tell you
dialog: that he loved you?
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Yes. No--never absolutely. It was
dialog: every day implied, but never declared.
dialog: Sometimes I thought it had been, but
dialog: it never was. He has broken no vow.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: He has broken faith with all of us,
dialog: he made us all believe he loved you.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: He did! He did--he loved me as I
dialog: loved him.
text: MRS JENNINGS bursts through the door in her hat and coat,
text: panting.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: I had to come straight up--how are
dialog: you, Miss Marianne?
text: MARIANNE begins to sob uncontrollably.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Poor thing! She looks very bad. No
dialog: wonder, Miss Dashwood, for it is but
dialog: too true. I was told here in the
dialog: street by Miss Morton, who is a great
dialog: friend: he is to be married at the
dialog: end of the month--to a Miss Grey
dialog: with fifty thousand pounds. Well,
dialog: said I, if 'tis true, then he is a
dialog: good-for-nothing who has used my
dialog: young friend abominably ill, and I
dialog: wish with all my soul that his wife
dialog: may plague his heart out!
text: She goes round the bed to comfort MARIANNE.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
text: But he is not the only young man
dialog: worth having, my dear, and with your
dialog: pretty face you will never want for
dialog: admirers.
text: MARIANNE sobs even harder.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Ah, me! She had better have her cry
dialog: out and have done with it. I will go
dialog: and look out something to tempt her--
dialog: does she care for olives?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: I cannot tell you.
text: MRS JENNINGS leaves. MARIANNE seizes the letter again.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: I cannot believe his nature capable
dialog: of such cruelty!
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Marianne, there is no excuse for him--
dialog: this is his hand--
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: But it cannot be his heart! Oh, Mamma!
dialog: I want Mamma! Elinor, please take me
dialog: home! Cannot we go tomorrow?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: There is no one to take us.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Cannot we hire a carriage?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: We have no money--and indeed we owe
dialog: Mrs Jennings more courtesy.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: All she wants is gossip and she only
dialog: likes me because I supply it! Oh,
dialog: God! I cannot endure to stay.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: I will find a way. I promise.
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE-HOUSE - COVENT GARDEN - DAY
text: FANNY, JOHN and ROBERT are drinking chocolate together.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Apparently they never were engaged.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Miss Grey has fifty thousand pounds.
text: Marianne is virtually penniless.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: She cannot have expected him to go
dialog: through with it. But I feel for
dialog: Marianne--she will lose her bloom
dialog: and end a spinster like Elinor. I
dialog: think, my dear, we might consider
dialog: having them to stay with us for a
dialog: few days--we are, after all, family,
dialog: and my father.
text: He trails off. FANNY exchanges an alarmed glance with ROBERT.
text: She thinks fast.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: My love, I would ask them with all
dialog: my heart, but I have already asked
dialog: Miss Steele for a visit and we cannot
dialog: deprive Mrs Jennings of all her
dialog: company at once. We can invite your
dialog: sisters some other year, you know,
dialog: and Miss Steele will profit far more
dialog: from your generosity--poor girl!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That is very thoughtful, Fanny. We
dialog: shall ask Elinor and Marianne next
dialog: year, then... Certainly!
scene_heading: EXT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - LONDON STREET - DAY
text: MRS JENNINGS's carriage stands outside. A livened FOOTMAN
text: opens the door and LUCY steps out brandishing a new muff.
scene_heading: INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
text: MARIANNE sits alone on the bed. Around her lie her notes to
text: Willoughby, her lock of hair and the pocket sonnets. In her
text: hands is the creased and tear-stained letter from Willoughby
text: which she is examining over and over.
scene_heading: INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY
text: ELINOR is seated at a desk writing a letter. There is a sudden
text: rap at the front door. Footsteps are heard and as she turns,
text: the maid enters with COLONEL BRANDON. ELINOR rises to greet
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Thank you for coming, Colonel.
text: He bows. ELINOR is on edge. BRANDON looks haggard with
dialog: concern.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: How does your sister?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: I must get her home as quickly as
dialog: possible. The Palmers can take us as
dialog: far as Cleveland, which is but a day
dialog: from Barton--
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: Then permit me to accompany you and
dialog: take you straight on from Cleveland
dialog: to Barton myself.
text: ELINOR takes his hands gratefully.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: I confess that is precisely what I
dialog: had hoped for. Marianne suffers
dialog: cruelly, and what pains me most is
dialog: how hard she tries to justify Mr
dialog: Willoughby. But you know her
dialog: disposition.
text: After a moment BRANDON nods. He seems unable to remain still
text: or calm and finds it difficult to begin speaking.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: Perhaps I--my regard for you all--
dialog: Miss Dashwood, will you allow me to
dialog: prove it by relating some
dialog: circumstances which nothing but an
dialog: earnest desire of being useful--
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: You have something to tell me of Mr
dialog: Willoughby.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: (nods)
dialog: When I quitted Barton last--but I
dialog: must go further back. A short account
dialog: of myself will be necessary. No
dialog: doubt... no doubt Mrs Jennings has
dialog: apprised you of certain events in my
dialog: past--the sad outcome of my connection
text: with a young woman named Eliza.
text: ELINOR nods.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: What is not commonly known is that
dialog: twenty years ago, Eliza bore an
text: illegitimate child. The father,
dialog: whoever he was, abandoned them.
text: This is strong stuff. ELINOR's concern deepens.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: As she lay dying, she begged me to
dialog: look after the child. Eliza died in
dialog: my arms, broken, wasted away--ah!
dialog: Miss Dashwood, such a subject--
dialog: untouched for so many years--it is
dialog: dangerous...
text: He paces about, barely able to conceal his distress.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: I had failed Eliza in every other
dialog: way--I could not refuse her now. I
dialog: took the child--Beth is her name--
dialog: and placed her with a family where I
dialog: could be sure she would be well looked
dialog: after. I saw her whenever I could. I
dialog: saw that she was headstrong like her
dialog: mother--and, God forgive me, I
dialog: indulged her, I allowed her too much
dialog: freedom. Almost a year ago, she
dialog: disappeared.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Disappeared!
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: I instigated a search but for eight
dialog: months I was left to imagine the
dialog: worst. At last, on the day of the
dialog: Delaford picnic, I received the first
dialog: news her. She was with child... and
dialog: the blackguard who had--
text: BRANDON stops and looks straight at ELINOR.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Good God. Do you mean--Willoughby?
text: BRANDON nods. ELINOR drops into a chair, utterly shocked.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: Before I could return to confront
dialog: him, Lady Allen learned of his
dialog: behaviour and turned him from the
text: house. He beat a hasty retreat to
dialog: London--
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Yes! He left us that morning, without
dialog: any explanation!
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: Lady Allen had annulled his legacy.
text: He was left with next to nothing,
dialog: and in danger of losing all that
dialog: remained to his debtors--
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: --and so abandoned Marianne for Miss
dialog: Grey and her fifty thousand pounds.
text: BRANDON is silent. ELINOR is breathless.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Have you seen Mr Willoughby since
dialog: you learned...?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: We met by appointment, he to defend,
dialog: I to punish his conduct.
text: ELINOR stares at him, aghast.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: We returned unwounded, so the meeting
dialog: never got abroad.
text: ELINOR nods and is silent for a moment.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Is Beth still in town?
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: She has chosen to go into the country
dialog: for her confinement. Such has been
dialog: the unhappy resemblance between the
dialog: fate of mother and daughter, and so
dialog: imperfectly have I discharged my
dialog: trust.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: I would not have burdened you, Miss
dialog: Dashwood, had I not from my heart
dialog: believed it might, in time, lessen
dialog: your sister's regrets.
text: BRANDON moves to the door and then stops. He turns to her
text: and speaks with effort.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: I have described Mr Willoughby as
dialog: the worst of libertines--but I have
dialog: since learned from Lady Allen that
dialog: he did mean to propose that day.
dialog: Therefore I cannot deny that his
dialog: intentions towards Marianne were
dialog: honourable, and I feel certain he
dialog: would have married her, had it not
dialog: been for--for the money.
text: She looks up at BRANDON. Silence.
scene_heading: INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: MARIANNE is sitting on the bed staring into space. ELINOR is
text: kneeling by her, holding her hands.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Dearest, was I right to tell you?
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Whatever his past actions, whatever
dialog: his present course, at least you may
dialog: be certain that he loved you.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: But not enough. Not enough.
scene_heading: INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - STUDY - DAY
text: ELINOR sits alone with her head in her hands. Suddenly MRS
text: JENNINGS hustles in looking pleased.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Here is someone to cheer you up,
dialog: Miss Dashwood!
text: She is followed in by LUCY. MRS JENNINGS leaves, busy as
text: ever. LUCY plants an expression of ghastly concern on her
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: How is your dear sister, Miss
dialog: Dashwood? Poor thing! I must say, I
dialog: do not know what I should do if a
dialog: man treated me with so little respect.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: I hope you are enjoying your stay
dialog: with John and Fanny, Miss Steele?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I was never so happy in my entire
dialog: life, Miss Dashwood! I do believe
dialog: your sister-in-law has taken quite a
dialog: fancy to me. I had to come and tell
dialog: you--for you cannot imagine what has
dialog: happened!
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: No, I cannot.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Yesterday I was introduced to Edward's
dialog: mother!
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Indeed?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: And she was a vast deal more than
dialog: civil. I have not yet seen Edward
dialog: but now I feel sure to very soon--
text: The MAID comes back.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: There's a Mr Edward Ferrars to see
dialog: you, Miss Dashwood.
text: There is a tiny frozen silence.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Do ask him to come up.
text: ELINOR quite involuntarily sits down and then stands up again.
text: EDWARD is admitted, looking both anxious and eager. As LUCY
text: is sitting in the window seat, at first he sees only ELINOR.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Miss Dashwood, how can I--
text: But ELINOR cuts him off.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Mr Ferrars, what a pleasure to see
dialog: you. You... know Miss Steele, of
dialog: course.
text: EDWARD turns slowly and encounters LUCY's glassy smile. He
text: all but blanches. Then bows, and clears his throat.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: How do you do, Miss Steele.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I am well, thank you, Mr Ferrars.
text: EDWARD has no notion of what to do or say. He swallows.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Do sit down, Mr Ferrars.
text: LUCY's eyes are sharp as broken glass. EDWARD remains on his
text: feet, looking helplessly from one woman to the other.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: You must be surprised to find me
dialog: here, Mr Ferrars! I expect you thought
dialog: I was at your sister's house.
text: This is precisely what EDWARD had thought. He tries to smile
text: but his facial muscles won't work. ELINOR decides to fetch
dialog: help.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Let me call Marianne, Mr Ferrars.
dialog: She would be most disappointed to
dialog: miss you.
text: ELINOR goes to the door, thankful to escape, but MARIANNE
text: prevents her by walking in at that moment. Despite her
text: anguish, she is very pleased to see EDWARD and embraces him
dialog: warmly.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Edward! I heard your voice! At last
dialog: you have found us!
text: EDWARD is shocked by her appearance and momentarily forgets
dialog: his own confusion.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Forgive me, Marianne, my visit is
dialog: shamefully overdue. You are pale. I
dialog: hope you have not been unwell?
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Oh, don't think of me--Elinor is
dialog: well, you see, that must be enough
dialog: for both of us!
text: MARIANNE gestures to ELINOR encouragingly but EDWARD seems
text: unable to look at her.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: How do you like London, Marianne?
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Not at all. The sight of you is all
dialog: the pleasure it has afforded, is
dialog: that not so, Elinor?
text: Again, MARIANNE endeavours to ignite the lovers. ELINOR tries
text: to silence MARIANNE with her eyes but to no avail. MARIANNE
text: puts their coolness down to the presence of LUCY, at whom
text: she glances with a none too friendly air.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Why have you taken so long to come
dialog: and see us?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I have been much engaged elsewhere.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Engaged elsewhere! But what was that
dialog: when there were such friends to be
dialog: met?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Perhaps, Miss Marianne, you think
dialog: young men never honour their
dialog: engagements, little or great.
text: ELINOR is appalled by this remark but MARIANNE does not notice
text: it and turns back to LUCY earnestly.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: No, indeed--for Edward is the most
dialog: fearful of giving pain and the most
dialog: incapable of being selfish of anyone
dialog: I ever saw.
text: EDWARD makes an uncomfortable noise.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Edward, will you not sit? Elinor,
dialog: help me to persuade him.
text: Now EDWARD can stand it no longer.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Forgive me but I must take my leave--
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: But you are only just arrived!
text: ELINOR rises, desperate for them both to go.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You must excuse me, I have a
dialog: commission to attend to for Fanny--
text: LUCY jumps in like a shot.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: In that case perhaps you might escort
dialog: me back to your sister's house, Mr
dialog: Ferrars?
text: There is an extremely awkward pause.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I would be honoured. Goodbye, Miss
dialog: Dashwood, Miss Marianne.
text: He shakes hands with ELINOR and with MARIANNE, who is silent
text: with dismay. LUCY takes EDWARD's arm and looks up at him
text: proprietorially.
text: After a stiff bow and a muttered farewell from EDWARD, they
text: leave. MARIANNE looks at her sister in astonishment.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Why did you not urge him to stay?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: He must have had his reasons for
dialog: going.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: His reason was no doubt your coldness.
dialog: If I were Edward I would assume you
dialog: did not care for me at all.
scene_heading: EXT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - BACK GARDEN - DAY
text: A tranquil afternoon...
scene_heading: INT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY
text: LUCY is sitting with FANNY, who is doing some pointless
text: basketwork. LUCY hands FANNY rushes.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Poor Miss Marianne looked very badly
dialog: t'other day. When I think of her,
text: deserted and abandoned, it frightens
dialog: me to think I shall never marry.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Nonsense. You will marry far better
dialog: than either of the Dashwood girls.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: How can that possibly be?
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: You have ten times their sense and
dialog: looks.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: But I have no dowry.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: There are qualities which will always
dialog: make up for that, and you have them
dialog: in abundance. It would not surprise
dialog: me if you were to marry far and away
dialog: beyond your expectations.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I wish it might be so. There is a
dialog: young man--
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Ah ha! I am glad to hear of it. Is
dialog: he of good breeding and fortune?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Oh both--but his family would
dialog: certainly oppose the match.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: Tush! They will allow it as soon as
dialog: they see you, my dear.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: It is a very great secret. I have
dialog: told no one in the world for fear of
dialog: discovery.
text: FANNY looks up, curious to know more.
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: My dear, I am the soul of discretion.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: If I dared tell...
speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: I can assure you I am as silent as
dialog: the grave.
text: LUCY leans forward to whisper in FANNY's ear.
scene_heading: EXT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - DAY
text: We hold a long shot of the house for a moment of silence.
text: Then from inside comes an almost inhumanly loud shriek.
speaker_heading: FANNY (V.O.)
dialog: Viper in my bosom!
scene_heading: EXT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - BACK GARDEN - DAY
text: FANNY is trying to drag LUCY out of the house. ROBERT and
text: JOHN are trying to reason with her. FANNY loses her grip and
text: falls backwards. LUCY flings herself into ROBERT's arms.
text: ROBERT falls over.
scene_heading: EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY
text: MRS JENNINGS is running as fast as her fat little legs will
dialog: carry her.
scene_heading: EXT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BERKELEY STREET - DAY
text: MRS JENNINGS pants up the front steps.
scene_heading: INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
text: ELINOR and MARIANNE are packing. Their mood is gloomy and
text: uncommunicative. MRS JENNINGS explodes into the room fighting
dialog: for breath.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Oh, my dears! What a commotion! Mr
dialog: Edward Ferrars--the very one I used
dialog: to joke you about, Miss Dashwood--
dialog: has been engaged these five years to
dialog: Lucy Steele!
text: MARIANNE lets out a gasp. She looks at ELINOR, who nods at
text: her in swift confirmation.
speaker_heading: MRS JENNINGS
dialog: Poor Mr Ferrars! His mother, who by
dialog: all accounts is very proud, demanded
dialog: that he break the engagement on pain
text: of disinheritance. But he has refused
text: to break his promise to Lucy. He has
text: stood by her, good man, and is cut
dialog: off without a penny! She has settled
text: it all irrevocably upon Mr Robert.
dialog: But I cannot stop, I must go to Lucy.
dialog: Your sister-in-law scolded her like
dialog: any fury--drove her to hysterics.
text: She leaves the room, still rabbiting on. There is a silence.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: How long have you known?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Since the evening Mrs Jennings offered
dialog: to take us to London.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Why did you not tell me?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Lucy told me in the strictest
dialog: confidence.
text: MARIANNE looks at her in complete incredulity.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: I could not break my word.
text: Clearly, there is no arguing this point.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: But Edward loves you.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: He made me no promises. He tried to
dialog: tell me about Lucy.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: He cannot marry her.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Would you have him treat her even
dialog: worse than Willoughby has treated
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: No--but nor would I have him marry
dialog: where he does not love.
text: ELINOR tries hard to be controlled.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Edward made his promise a long time
dialog: ago, long before he met me. Though
dialog: he may... harbour some regret, I
dialog: believe he will be happy--in the
dialog: knowledge that he did his duty and
dialog: kept his word. After all--after all
dialog: that is bewitching in the idea of
dialog: one's happiness depending entirely
dialog: on one person, it is not always
dialog: possible. We must accept. Edward
dialog: will marry Lucy--and you and I will
dialog: go home.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Always resignation and acceptance!
dialog: Always prudence and honour and duty!
dialog: Elinor, where is your heart?
text: ELINOR finally explodes. She turns upon MARIANNE almost
text: savagely.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: What do you know of my heart? What
dialog: do you know of anything but your own
dialog: suffering? For weeks, Marianne, I
dialog: have had this pressing on me without
dialog: being at liberty to speak of it to a
text: single creature. It was forced upon
dialog: me by the very person whose prior
dialog: claims ruined all my hopes. I have
text: had to endure her exultation again
dialog: and again while knowing myself to be
dialog: divided from Edward forever. Believe
dialog: me, Marianne, had I not been bound
dialog: to silence I could have produced
dialog: proof enough of a broken heart even
dialog: for you.
text: Complete silence. Then MARIANNE speaks in a whisper.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Oh, Elinor!
text: MARIANNE bursts into sobs and flings her arms around ELINOR,
text: who, almost impatiently, tries to comfort her.
scene_heading: EXT. PALMER RESIDENCE - LONDON STREET - DAY
text: LUCY and MRS JENNINGS are on the doorstep. LUCY looks rather
text: lost and pathetic, with her little bundles, hastily packed.
text: The door opens and CHARLOTTE precedes the SERVANT, ushering
text: them in with shrill cries of sympathy.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON (V.O.)
dialog: I have heard that your friend Mr
dialog: Ferrars has been entirely cast off
dialog: by his family for persevering in his
dialog: engagement to Miss Steele.
scene_heading: EXT. SQUARE IN FRONT OF MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - LONDON - DAY
text: ELINOR and BRANDON walk round the quiet square.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: Have I been rightly informed? Is it
dialog: so?
text: ELINOR is greatly taken aback by this unexpected query.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: It is indeed so. Are you acquainted
dialog: with Mr Ferrars?
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: No, we have never met. But I know
dialog: only too well the cruelty--the
dialog: impolitic cruelty of dividing two
dialog: young people long attached to one
dialog: another. Mrs Ferrars does not know
dialog: what she may drive her son to--
text: He pauses, frowning in remembrance. ELINOR waits in suspense.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: I have a proposal to make that should
dialog: enable him to marry Miss Steele
dialog: immediately. Since the gentleman is
dialog: so close a friend to your family,
dialog: perhaps you will be good enough to
dialog: mention it to him?
text: ELINOR is completely taken aback. She takes a moment to reply.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Colonel, I am sure he would be only
dialog: too delighted to hear it from your
dialog: own lips.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: I think not. His behaviour has proved
dialog: him proud--in the best sense. I feel
dialog: certain this is the right course.
scene_heading: INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - STUDY - DAY
text: ELINOR is waiting. The MAID announces EDWARD and he walks in
text: momentarily. They are alone for the first time in months and
text: for a moment, neither speaks.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Mr Ferrars.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Miss Dashwood.
text: ELINOR indicates a seat for him but neither sits.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Thank you for responding so promptly
dialog: to my message.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I was most grateful to receive it. I--
dialog: Miss Dashwood, God knows what you
dialog: must think of me...
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Mr Ferrars--
text: He interrupts her, desperate to explain.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I have no right to speak, I know--
text: ELINOR has to stop him.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Mr Ferrars, I have good news. I think
dialog: you know of our friend Colonel
dialog: Brandon?
text: EDWARD looks completely bewildered.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Yes, I have heard his name.
text: ELINOR starts to speak rather faster than usual.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Colonel Brandon desires me to say
dialog: that, understanding you wish to join
dialog: the clergy, he has great pleasure in
dialog: offering you the parish on his estate
text: at Delaford, now just vacant, in the
dialog: hope that it may enable you--and
dialog: Miss Steele--to marry.
text: EDWARD cannot at first take it in. ELINOR sits down.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Colonel Brandon?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Yes. He means it as testimony of his
dialog: concern for--for the cruel situation
dialog: in which you find yourselves.
text: Now EDWARD sits--in shock.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Colonel Brandon give me a parish?
dialog: Can it be possible?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: The unkindness of your family has
dialog: made you astonished to find friendship
dialog: elsewhere.
text: EDWARD looks at ELINOR, his eyes full of growing
dialog: comprehension.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: No. Not to find it in you. I cannot
dialog: be ignorant that to you--to your
dialog: goodness--I owe it all. I feel it. I
dialog: would express it if I could, but, as
dialog: you know, I am no orator.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: You are very much mistaken. I assure
dialog: you that you owe it almost entirely
dialog: to your own merit--I have had no
text: hand in it.
text: But EDWARD clearly believes she has been instrumental in the
text: offer. He frowns slightly before speaking with rather an
dialog: effort.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Colonel Brandon must be a man of
dialog: great worth and respect ability.
text: ELINOR finds some relief in saying at least one thing that
dialog: she truly means.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: He is the kindest and best of men.
text: This makes EDWARD seem even more depressed. He sits silent
text: for a moment but then rouses himself to action.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: May I enquire why the Colonel did
dialog: not tell me himself?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: I think he felt it would be better
dialog: coming from... a friend.
text: EDWARD looks at ELINOR, his eyes full of sadness.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Your friendship has been the most
dialog: important of my life.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: You will always have it.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Forgive me.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Mr Ferrars, you honour your promises--
dialog: that is more important than anything
dialog: else. I wish you--both--very happy.
text: They rise. She curtsies. He bows.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Goodbye, Miss Dashwood.
text: EDWARD leaves silently. ELINOR stands stock-still in the
text: middle of the room.
scene_heading: EXT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - DAY
text: The PALMERS' carriage stands outside the house. COLONEL
text: BRANDON helps MARIANNE in beside ELINOR before mounting his
text: horse to ride alongside. MRS JENNINGS waves goodbye from the
text: steps. The carriage moves off. MRS JENNINGS blows her nose,
text: looks up and down the street in search of gossip and goes
text: back indoors with a sigh.
scene_heading: INT. THE PALMERS' CARRIAGE - ON THE ROAD - DAY
text: MARIANNE is sitting back in her seat with her eyes closed.
text: She does not look well. MR PALMER is behind his newspaper.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: What a stroke of luck for Lucy and
dialog: Edward to find a parish so close to
dialog: Barton! You will all be able to meet
dialog: very often. That will cheer you up,
dialog: Miss Marianne. I do declare I have
dialog: never disliked a person so much as I
dialog: do Mr Willoughby, for your sake.
dialog: Insufferable man! To think we can
text: see his insufferable house from the
dialog: top of our hill!
text: CLOSE on MARIANNE's eyes slowly opening.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: I shall ask Jackson to plant some
text: very tall trees.
speaker_heading: MR PALMER
dialog: (from behind the paper)
dialog: You will do nothing of the sort.
scene_heading: EXT. THE PALMERS' CARRIAGE - OPEN ROAD - DAY
text: The carriage bowls along, with BRANDON riding next to it.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (V.O.)
dialog: I hear Miss Grey's bridal gown was
dialog: everything of the finest--made in
dialog: Paris, no less. I should have liked
dialog: to see it, although I dare say it
dialog: was a sorry affair, scalloped with
dialog: ruffles--but what do the French know
dialog: about fashion?
scene_heading: EXT. CLEVELAND - DRIVE - AFTERNOON
text: The carriage stands outside the PALMER residence, a
text: resplendent affair with a great deal of land. BRANDON is
text: helping MARIANNE and ELINOR out of the carriage.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (V.O.)
dialog: I am resolved never to mention Mr
dialog: Willoughby's name again, and
dialog: furthermore I shall tell everyone I
dialog: meet what a good-for nothing he is.
speaker_heading: MR PALMER (V.O.)
dialog: Be quiet.
text: ELINOR and MARIANNE stand on the steps as the PALMERS debauch
text: from the carriage amid a welter of SERVANTS.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: (sotto voce)
dialog: I do not think she drew breath from
dialog: the moment we left London. It is my
dialog: fault--I should have found some other
dialog: way of getting home.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: There was no other way you said so
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: We shall be home soon enough. Mamma
dialog: will comfort you, dearest.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: I am stiff from sitting so long.
dialog: Will you tell Charlotte that I am
text: going for a stroll? ELINOR glances
text: at the sky in concern.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: I think it is going to rain.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: No, no, it will not rain.
text: ELINOR cannot help but smile at this return of the old
speaker_heading: MARIANNE.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: You always say that and then it always
dialog: does.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: I will keep to the garden, near the
dialog: house.
text: MARIANNE walks off. ELINOR watches her go anxiously.
scene_heading: INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY
text: MRS BUNTING, a rather baleful NANNY, looks on as MR PALMER
text: holds up a screaming BABY in a frilly bonnet for everyone's
dialog: inspection.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: We are very proud of our little
dialog: Thomas, Colonel--and his papa has
dialog: such a way with him...
text: BRANDON flicks a glance at MR PALMER for whom holding a baby
dialog: comes as naturally as breathing underwater.
scene_heading: EXT. CLEVELAND - GARDEN - DAY
text: MARIANNE walks purposefully towards the garden wall, beyond
text: which lies a hill.
scene_heading: INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY
text: ELINOR enters to find CHARLOTTE alone with the now hysterical
scene_heading: BABY THOMAS.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: There you are, Miss Dashwood! Mr
dialog: Palmer and the Colonel have locked
text: themselves up in the billiard room.
dialog: Come and meet little Thomas. Where
dialog: is Miss Marianne?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
text: She is taking a little air in the
dialog: garden.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Oh, very good. That is the great
dialog: advantage of the countryside--all
dialog: the fresh air and... and all the
dialog: fresh air...
text: CHARLOTTE's conversational difficulties are drowned out by
dialog: her offspring.
scene_heading: EXT. CLEVELAND - GARDEN - DAY
text: MARIANNE comes to a gate in the wall and turns the handle.
text: It opens. She throws a glance back to the house and passes
text: through. There is a low rumble of thunder.
scene_heading: INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY
text: BABY THOMAS is purple in the face but shows no signs of
text: quietening.
text: CHARLOTTE joggles him about inefficiently.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: He is the best child in the world--
dialog: he never cries unless he wants to
dialog: and then, Lord, there is no stopping
dialog: him.
scene_heading: EXT. THE HILL - DAY
text: MARIANNE, calm and determined, walks towards the top of the
text: hill. The wind whips and plucks at her hair and skirts.
scene_heading: INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY
text: ELINOR, traumatised by her new acquaintance with the shrieking
text: BABY THOMAS, goes to look out of the window. She frowns.
scene_heading: EXT. CLEVELAND - GARDEN - DAY
text: ELINOR's POV. MARIANNE is nowhere in sight. Storm clouds
dialog: have gathered on the bill.
scene_heading: INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY
text: ELINOR turns from the window. BABY THOMAS stops crying for
dialog: two seconds.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: I cannot see Marianne.
text: There is a crack of thunder. BABY THOMAS starts again.
scene_heading: EXT. THE HILL - DAY
text: Rain has started to pour down. MARIANNE walks on regardless.
scene_heading: INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY
text: CHARLOTTE shouts over BABY THOMAS to ELINOR.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: She has probably taken shelter in
dialog: one of the greenhouses!
scene_heading: EXT. THE HILL - DAY
text: MARIANNE has reached the top. Soaked to the skin, she stands
text: with the storm raging around her, staring at the spires of
text: Combe Magna, the place that would have been her home. Rain
text: streaks her face and the wind whips her hair about her.
text: Through frozen lips she whispers:
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Love is not love Which alters when
dialog: it alteration finds Or bends with
dialog: the remover to remove: 0, no! it is
dialog: an ever-fixed mark That looks on
dialog: tempests and is never shaken...
scene_heading: EXT. CLEVELAND - GREENHOUSES - DAY
text: BRANDON is looking for MARIANNE. He enters a greenhouse.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: Marianne!
scene_heading: EXT. THE HILL - DAY
text: MARIANNE stares at Combe Magna, a strange smile playing about
text: her lips. Then she calls to WILLOUGHBY as though he were
text: near. The effect is eerie, unworldly.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Willoughby... Willoughby...
scene_heading: INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY
text: CHARLOTTE, MR PALMER and ELINOR are waiting anxiously. BABY
text: THOMAS has been removed. ELINOR is staring out of the window.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: One thing is certain--she will be
text: wet through when she returns.
speaker_heading: MR PALMER
dialog: Thank you for pointing that out, my
dialog: dear. Do not worry, Miss Dashwood--
dialog: Brandon will find her. I think we
dialog: can all guess where she went.
scene_heading: EXT. THE HILL - DAY
text: BRANDON runs up the hillside as though the devil were at his
dialog: heels.
scene_heading: INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY
text: CHARLOTTE is handing ELINOR a cup of tea. ELINOR turns back
text: to look out of the window. She freezes.
scene_heading: EXT. CLEVELAND - GARDEN - DAY
text: ELINOR's POV of BRANDON walking up to the house with MARIANNE
text: cradled in his arms. It is like seeing Willoughby's ghost.
scene_heading: INT. CLEVELAND - HALL - DAY
text: Everyone rushes out of the drawing room as the COLONEL enters
text: with MARIANNE. He is exhausted and soaked. MARIANNE is dumb
text: with cold and fatigue.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: She is not hurt--but we must get her
dialog: warm!
text: ELINOR and MR PALMER take MARIANNE from BRANDON and go
text: upstairs, with CHARLOTTE in pursuit.
scene_heading: EXT. CLEVELAND - NIGHT - RAIN
text: The great house sits in darkness. A sense of foreboding.
scene_heading: INT. CLEVELAND - UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: ELINOR is in her nightgown, knocking at a door. MR PALMER
text: answers in his nightshirt, astonished to have been summoned
text: out of bed.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: I think Marianne may need a doctor.
scene_heading: INT. CLEVELAND - BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY
text: MR PALMER and CHARLOTTE are sitting at the breakfast table.
text: BRANDON is pacing. The rain has stopped.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: You'll wear yourself out, Colonel!
dialog: Do not worry! A day or two in bed
dialog: will soon set her to rights!
speaker_heading: MR PALMER
dialog: You can rely upon Harris, Colonel. I
dialog: have never found a better physician.
text: Enter ELINOR with DR HARRIS.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: (urgent)
dialog: What is your diagnosis?
speaker_heading: DR HARRIS
text: It is an infectious fever that has
dialog: taken far more serious hold than I
dialog: would have expected in one so young.
dialog: I would recommend the hasty removal
dialog: of your child, Mr Palmer--
text: CHARLOTTE runs out of the room screaming.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Mrs Bunting! Mrs Bunting!
scene_heading: EXT. CLEVELAND - FRONT STEPS - DAY
text: CHARLOTTE is getting into their carriage with MRS BUNTING
text: and BABY THOMAS. MR PALMER is on the steps with ELINOR. He
text: takes her hand and looks at her with real sympathy.
speaker_heading: MR PALMER
dialog: My dear Miss Dashwood, I am more
dialog: sorry than I can say. If you would
dialog: prefer me to stay I am at your
dialog: service.
text: ELINOR is touched to find this warm heart beneath his frosty
dialog: exterior.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Mr Palmer, that is very kind. But
dialog: Colonel Brandon and Dr Harris will
dialog: look after us. Thank you for
dialog: everything you have done.
text: MR PALMER nods, presses her hand, and walks down the steps
text: to the carriage.
scene_heading: INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY
text: BRANDON sits head in hands. His ghosts have come to haunt
dialog: him.
scene_heading: INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: MARIANNE is tossing and turning in the bed. DR HARRIS is
text: trying to take her pulse. He looks up at ELINOR, who is
text: watching anxiously.
speaker_heading: DR HARRIS
dialog: She is not doing as well as I would
dialog: like.
scene_heading: INT. CLEVELAND - UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY
text: ELINOR exits the bedroom to find BRANDON outside. She jumps.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: What can I do?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Colonel, you have done so much
dialog: already.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: Give me an occupation, Miss Dashwood,
dialog: or I shall run mad. He is dangerously
dialog: quiet.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: She would be easier if her mother
dialog: were here.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: Of course. Barton is but eight hours
dialog: away. If I make no stop, you may see
dialog: us early tomorrow morning.
text: He takes ELINOR's hand and kisses it.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: In your hands I know she will be
dialog: safe.
scene_heading: EXT. CLEVELAND - DRIVE - EVE
text: BRANDON mounts his horse, turns to look at the house for a
text: moment, and then spurs it violently forward.
scene_heading: INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - EVE
text: ELINOR is by the window, having watched BRANDON's departure.
text: DR HARRIS is by MARIANNE's side. He turns to ELINOR.
speaker_heading: DR HARRIS
dialog: Double the number of drops and I
dialog: will return as soon as I can.
scene_heading: EXT. CLEVELAND - NIGHT
text: The house stands in virtual darkness with only a dim light
text: issuing from one of the upper rooms.
scene_heading: EXT. OPEN ROAD - NIGHT
text: BRANDON riding fast, his cape billowing out behind him.
scene_heading: INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: MARIANNE's eyes glitter with the fever. ELINOR wipes her
text: brow. Suddenly she speaks.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Who is that?
text: She is looking at the end of the bed.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Look, look, Elinor.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: There is no one there, dearest.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: It is Papa. Papa has come.
text: ELINOR looks fearfully towards the end of the bed. MARIANNE
text: tries to smile with her cracked lips.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Dearest Papa!
text: The dead are coming for the dying.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE:
scene_heading: INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - LATER
text: ELINOR, her eyes red from watching, wipes MARIANNE's temples.
text: DR HARRIS takes her pulse and looks at ELINOR anxiously. His
text: silence is worse than any utterance.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE:
scene_heading: INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - LATER
text: The room is very still. MARIANNE is pale as wax. DR HARRIS
text: puts on his coat. ELINOR looks at him fearfully.
speaker_heading: DR HARRIS
dialog: I must fetch more laudanum. I cannot
dialog: pretend, Miss Dashwood, that your
dialog: sister's condition is not very
dialog: serious. You must prepare yourself.
dialog: I will return very shortly.
text: He leaves the room.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE:
scene_heading: INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - LATER
text: MARIANNE lies in the grip of her fever. ELINOR sits watching
text: her. Slowly she rises and walks to the bed. When she speaks,
dialog: her tone is very practical.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Marianne, Marianne, please try--
text: Suddenly, almost unconsciously, she starts to heave with dry
text: sobs, wrenched out of her, full of anguish and heartbreak
text: and all the more painful for being tearless.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Marianne, please try--I cannot--I
dialog: cannot do without you. Oh, please, I
dialog: have tried to bear everything else--
dialog: I will try--but please, dearest,
dialog: beloved Marianne, do not leave me
dialog: alone.
text: She falls to her knees by the bed, gulping for breath, taking
text: MARIANNE's hand and kissing it again and again.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE:
scene_heading: EXT. CLEVELAND - GARDENS - DAWN
text: A shimmer of light appears on the rim of the horizon.
text: Somewhere a lark breaks into clear untroubled song.
scene_heading: INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: DR HARRIS sits slumped in a chair. MARIANNE lies motionless.
text: ELINOR rises with difficulty from the bedside and goes to
text: the window. She is white as paper. The lark sings. Then,
text: from behind, comes the faintest of whispers.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE (V.O.)
dialog: Elinor?
text: ELINOR turns with a cry. DR HARRIS springs from his seat and
text: examines MARIANNE. He then turns to ELINOR with a smile of
text: relief and nods. At that moment the sound of carriage wheels
text: is heard on the gravel.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: My mother!
scene_heading: EXT. CLEVELAND - FRONT STEPS - MORNING
text: BRANDON helps MRS DASHWOOD, who is weak with exhaustion and
text: distress, out of the carriage.
scene_heading: INT. CLEVELAND - STAIRCASE - MORNING
text: ELINOR hurls herself down the stairs. She reaches the door
text: just as BRANDON and MRS DASHWOOD enter and practically swoons
text: into her mother's arms.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Mamma! She is out of danger!
scene_heading: INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: CLOSE on MARIANNE's face as MRS DASHWOOD kisses her.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: There, there, my love, my Marianne.
text: MARIANNE opens her eyes and smiles at her mother. MRS DASHWOOD
text: takes her gently into her arms. MARIANNE suddenly looks
text: anxious. She is too weak to move her head. She whispers with
dialog: urgent effort.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Where is Elinor?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: I am here, dearest, I am here.
text: MARIANNE looks at her with deep relief. Behind the DASHWOODS,
text: BRANDON stands at the door, unwilling to intrude on this
text: intimacy. He wipes his eyes and turns away. MARIANNE sees
text: and whispers to him.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Colonel Brandon.
text: BRANDON turns back, his eyes full of tears. MARIANNE looks
text: at him for a moment. Then, very quietly:
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Thank you.
scene_heading: EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN AND SURROUNDINGS - DAY
text: The cottage nestles in the first buds of spring. A piece of
text: rope hangs down from the branches of a tree in the garden.
text: It starts to wave about wildly and we see MARGARET emerging
text: and climbing down. She has built herself a new tree-house.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON (V.O.)
dialog: What though the sea with waves
dialog: continuall Doe eate the earth, it is
dialog: no more at all.
scene_heading: INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY
text: MARIANNE is on the sofa by the window. She is pale,
text: convalescent and calm. Different somehow. She listens intently
text: as BRANDON reads her the poem.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: Nor is the earth the lesse, or loseth
dialog: aught. For whatsoever from one place
dialog: doth fall, Is with the tide unto
dialog: another brought...
text: We move back to find MRS DASHWOOD and ELINOR at the other
text: end of the room, sewing peacefully.
scene_heading: MRS. DASHWOOD
dialog: He certainly is nor so dashing as
dialog: Willoughby but he has a far more
dialog: pleasing countenance. There was always
dialog: a something, if you remember, in
dialog: Willoughby's eyes at times which I
dialog: did not like.
text: ELINOR listens patiently as her mother rewrites history. We
text: cut back to BRANDON as he finishes reading.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: 'For there is nothing lost, but may
dialog: be found, if sought...
text: He looks up at MARIANNE. A soul-breathing glance. She smiles
text: as he closes the book.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Shall we continue tomorrow?
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: No--for I must away.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Away? Where?
speaker_heading: COLONEL BRANDON
dialog: (teasing)
dialog: That I cannot tell you. It is a
dialog: secret.
text: He rises to leave.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: (impulsive)
dialog: But you will not stay away long?
text: CLOSE on BRANDON's reaction.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELDS NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY
text: ELINOR and MARIANNE are out on a walk. They go very slowly,
text: MARIANNE leaning on ELINOR's arm. Their mood is loving,
dialog: companion able.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNS NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY
text: ELINOR and MARIANNE walk on. Suddenly, MARIANNE stops.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: There.
text: She indicates a spot on the ground but ELINOR can see nothing
text: and is momentarily alarmed. MARIANNE gazes at the ground and
text: breathes in deeply.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: There I fell, and there I first saw
dialog: Willoughby.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Poor Willoughby. He will always regret
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: But does it follow that, had he chosen
dialog: me, he would have been content?
text: ELINOR looks at MARIANNE, surprised.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: He would have had a wife he loved
dialog: but no money--and might soon have
dialog: learned to rank the demands of his
dialog: pocket-book far above the demands of
dialog: his heart.
text: ELINOR regards MARIANNE admiringly. MARIANNE smiles sadly.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: If his present regrets are half as
dialog: painful as mine, he will suffer
dialog: enough.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Do you compare your conduct with
dialog: his?
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: No. I compare it with what it ought
dialog: to have been. I compare it with yours.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Our situations were very different.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: My illness has made me consider the
dialog: past. I saw in my own behaviour
dialog: nothing but imprudence--and worse. I
dialog: was insolent and unjust to everyone--
text: ELINOR tries to stem the flow but MARIANNE continues.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: --but you--you I wronged above all.
dialog: Only I knew your heart and its sorrows
dialog: but even then I was never a grain
dialog: more compassionate. I brought my
dialog: illness upon myself--I wanted to
dialog: destroy myself. And had I succeeded,
dialog: what misery should I have caused
dialog: you?
text: ELINOR embraces her. They stand with their arms round one
text: another in silence for a moment. Then MARIANNE breaks away
text: and speaks with great good humour and energy.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: I shall mend my ways! I shall no
dialog: longer worry others nor torture
dialog: myself. I am determined to enter on
dialog: a course of serious study---Colonel
dialog: Brandon has promised me the run of
dialog: his library and I shall read at least
text: six hours a day. By the end of the
dialog: year I expect to have improved my
dialog: learning a very great deal.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY
text: THOMAS is sitting on the back of a local wagon, holding a
dialog: basket of food.
text: He jumps off near the cottage and waves a cheery farewell to
text: the DRIVER.
scene_heading: INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY
text: CLOSE on the accounts book, covered in blots and crossed-out
text: sums. Pull up to reveal MARIANNE labouring over it. Her
text: sickness has left her slightly short-sighted and she uses a
text: pince-nez that makes her look like an owl.
text: ELINOR is sewing and MRS DASHWOOD is snoozing. MARGARET goes
text: up and looks over MARIANNE's shoulder. She frowns at the
text: spider's web of ink.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You'll go blind if you're not careful.

dialog: Yes, ma'am--he brung back two lovely
dialog: fillets for you.
text: MRS DASHWOOD looks nervously at ELINOR like a child who has
dialog: been caught out.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Beef is far less expensive in Exeter,
dialog: and anyway they are for Marianne.
text: ELINOR laughs and rolls her eyes to heaven. BETSY turns on
dialog: her way out to remark:
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Sixpence a piece, Miss Dashwood. Oh,
dialog: and he says Mr Ferrars is married,
dialog: but I suppose you know that, ma'am.
text: There is a stunned silence. Everyone looks at ELINOR.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Fetch Thomas to us, Betsy.
text: BETSY leaves. They all sit very still. MARGARET is about to
text: talk to ELINOR about it but MARIANNE stops her. THOMAS enters.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Beg pardon, Miss Dashwood, but they
dialog: was the cheapest in the market--
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: It was a very good price, Thomas,
dialog: well done. Would you be so kind as
dialog: to build up the fire a little?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
text: There is a pause.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Who told you that Mr Ferrars was
dialog: married, Thomas?
text: THOMAS builds up the fire as he answers. He tells the story
dialog: with pleasure.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I seen him myself, ma'am, and his
dialog: lady too, Miss Lucy Steele as was--
text: they were stopping in a chaise at
dialog: the New London Inn. I happened to
dialog: look up as I passed the chaise and I
dialog: see it was Miss Steele. So I took
dialog: off my hat and she inquired after
dialog: you, ma'am, and all the young ladies,
dialog: especially Miss Dashwood, and bid me
dialog: I should give you her and Mr Ferrars's
dialog: best compliments and service and how
dialog: they'd be sure to send you a piece
dialog: of the cake.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Was Mr Ferrars in the carriage with
dialog: her?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Yes, ma'am--I just seen him leaning
text: back in it, but he did not look up.
text: ELINOR screws up her courage.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Did--
text: But she cannot continue. MARIANNE glances at her
text: compassionately and takes over.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Did Mrs Ferrars seem well?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Yes, Miss Marianne--she said how she
dialog: was vastly contented and, since she
dialog: was always a very affable young lady,
dialog: I made free to wish her joy.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Thank you, Thomas.
text: He nods and leaves, confused by the silent atmosphere. ELINOR
text: sits for a moment, then gets up and walks out.
scene_heading: EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN - EVE
text: ELINOR is standing by the gate, looking out. MRS DASHWOOD
text: comes down the path to join her. She links arms with ELINOR
text: and they stand in silence for a beat.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Your father once told me not to allow
dialog: you to neglect yourself. Now I find
dialog: that it is I who have neglected you
dialog: most.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: No, Mamma.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Yes, I have. We all have. Marianne
dialog: is right.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: I am very good at hiding.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Then we must observe you more closely.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Mamma?
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Yes, my darling?
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: There is a painful difference between
dialog: the expectation of an unpleasant
dialog: event and its final certainty.
text: MRS DASHWOOD squeezes ELINOR's arm tightly.
scene_heading: EXT. OPEN ROAD NEAR BARTON - DAY
text: A horse and cart are jogging along. The cart contains a large
text: object tied down and covered with canvas. The DRIVER whistles
dialog: tunelessly.
scene_heading: INT. BARTON COTTAGE - KITCHEN - DAY
text: MARGARET is standing on the kitchen table while ELINOR and
text: MARIANNE pin a piece of material around the bottom of her
dialog: skirt to lengthen it.
text: Suddenly there is a commotion upstairs.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD (V.O.)
dialog: Marianne! Marianne! Come and see
dialog: what is coming!
text: Everyone runs out of the kitchen.
scene_heading: EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN - DAY
text: THOMAS and the CARTER are carrying a small piano up the path.
scene_heading: INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY
text: They carry the piano into the parlour and to the DASHWOODS'
text: joyful astonishment it fits perfectly. MRS DASHWOOD reads
text: out the letter that has accompanied it.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: 'At last I have found a small enough
dialog: instrument to fir the parlour. I
dialog: expect to follow it in a day or two,
dialog: by which time I expect you to have
dialog: learned the enclosed. Your devoted
dialog: friend, Christopher Brandon.'
text: MRS DASHWOOD hands MARIANNE the letter and a broadsheet song.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: He must like you very much, Marianne.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: It is not just for me! It is for all
dialog: of us.
text: All the same, she looks conscious of the truth.
scene_heading: EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN - DAY
text: MARGARET is up her tree. ELINOR is pulling weeds. MRS DASHWOOD
text: is sitting on a stool working on MARGARET's dress and
text: listening to the strains of the new song which MARIANNE is
text: singing in the cottage. All of a sudden, MRS DASHWOOD rises,
text: shielding her eyes with her hand. She walks down to the gate,
text: looking out.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Here is Colonel Brandon! Marianne!
text: The piano stops. MARIANNE comes out and they all gather at
text: the gate to watch for the rider.
scene_heading: EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY
text: Their POV of a HORSEMAN in the distance.
scene_heading: EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN GATE - DAY
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: I do not think it is the Colonel.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: It must be. He said he would arrive
dialog: today. You must play him the new
dialog: song, Marianne.
text: Suddenly there is a yell from MARGARET's tree.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Edward!
text: MARGARET practically throws herself out of the tree onto the
dialog: grass.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: It is Edward!
text: The women look at each other in complete consternation.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Calm. We must be calm.
scene_heading: INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY
text: Tense silence reigns. Everyone tries to busy themselves.
text: BETSY enters.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Mr Ferrars for you, ma'am.
text: EDWARD follows her in, looking white and agitated.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: (rising)
dialog: Edward! What a pleasure to see you.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Mrs Dashwood. Miss Marianne. Margaret.
dialog: Miss Dashwood. I hope I find you all
dialog: well.
text: He bows formally to each of them, lingering on ELINOR, who
text: is looking firmly at her lap. He looks anxious.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Thank you, Edward, we are all very
dialog: well.
text: There is a pause while they all search for an appropriate
text: remark. Finally MARGARET decides to have a go at polite
dialog: conversation.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: We have been enjoying very fine
dialog: weather.
text: MARIANNE looks at her incredulously.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Well, we have.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I am glad of it. The... the roads
dialog: were very dry.
text: MRS DASHWOOD decides to bite the bullet.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: (giving him her hand)
dialog: May I wish you great joy, Edward.
text: He takes her hand somewhat confusedly and accepts her offer
text: of a seat. There is an awful silence. MARIANNE tries to help.
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: I hope you have left Mrs Ferrars
dialog: well?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Tolerably, thank you.
text: There is another bone-crunching pause.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I--But EDWARD cannot seem to find
dialog: any words.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Is Mrs Ferrars at the new parish?
text: EDWARD looks extremely confused.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: No--my mother is in town.
text: He plucks up the courage to look at ELINOR again and is
text: evidently not much comforted by what he sees.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: I meant to enquire after Mrs Edward
dialog: Ferrars.
text: EDWARD colours. He hesitates.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Then you have not heard--the news--I
dialog: think you mean my brother--you mean
dialog: Mrs Robert Ferrars.
text: They all stare at him in shock.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Mrs Robert Ferrars?
text: ELINOR has frozen. EDWARD rises and goes to the window.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Yes. I received a letter from Miss
dialog: Steele--or Mrs Ferrars, I should say--
dialog: communicating the... the transfer of
dialog: her affections to my brother Robert.
dialog: They were much thrown together in
dialog: London, I believe, and... and in
dialog: view of the change in my
dialog: circumstances, I felt it only fair
dialog: that Miss Steele be released from
dialog: our engagement. At any rate, they
dialog: were married last week and are now
dialog: in Plymouth.
text: ELINOR rises suddenly, EDWARD turns and they stand looking
text: at one another.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Then you--are not married.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: No.
text: ELINOR bursts into tears. The shock of this emotional
text: explosion stuns everyone for a second and then MARIANNE makes
text: an executive decision. Wordlessly, she takes MARGARET's hand
text: and leads her and MRS DASHWOOD out of the room.
scene_heading: EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN - DAY
text: The three DASHWOODS come into the garden, still holding hands.
scene_heading: INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY
text: ELINOR cannot stop crying. EDWARD comes forward, very slowly.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Elinor! I met Lucy when I was very
dialog: young. Had I had an active profession,
dialog: I should never have felt such an
text: idle, foolish inclination. At Norland
dialog: my behaviour was very wrong. But I
dialog: convinced myself you felt only
dialog: friendship for me and it was my heart
dialog: alone that I was risking. I have
dialog: come with no expectations. Only to
dialog: profess, now that I am at liberty to
dialog: do so, that my heart is and always
dialog: will be yours.
text: ELINOR looks at him, her face streaked with tears of released
dialog: emotion, of pain and of happiness.
scene_heading: EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN
text: MARIANNE and MRS DASHWOOD are stamping about in the garden
text: trying to keep warm. MARGARET has climbed into her tree-house.
text: The branches rustle.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
text: He's sitting next to her!
scene_heading: MRS DASHWOOD/MARIANNE
dialog: Margaret, come down!/Is he?
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: (scolding)
dialog: Margaret! Will you stop--
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: What's happening now?
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Marianne!
speaker_heading: MARGARET (V.O.)
dialog: He's kneeling down!
text: MRS DASHWOOD can't help herself.
speaker_heading: MRS DASHWOOD
dialog: Oh! Is he? Oh!
text: She and MARIANNE look at each other joyfully.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNS NEAR BARTON - DAY
text: The figures of EDWARD and ELINOR can be seen walking, in
text: deep conversation.
scene_heading: EXT. PATH NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DUSK
text: Later. The lovers walk slowly, their heads almost touching,
text: their words low and intimate.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Your mother, I suppose, will hardly
dialog: be less angry with Robert for marrying
dialog: Lucy.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: The more so since she settled the
dialog: money upon him so irrevocably--
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: --no doubt because she had run out
dialog: of sons to disinherit.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
text: Her family fluctuates at an alarming
dialog: rate. Then, in London, when you told
dialog: me of the Colonel's offer, I became
dialog: convinced that you wanted me to marry
dialog: Lucy and that--well, that you and
dialog: Colonel Brandon...
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Me and Colonel Brandon!
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I shall not forget attempting to
dialog: thank him for making it possible for
dialog: me to marry the woman I did not love
dialog: while convinced he had designs upon
dialog: the woman I did--do--love.
text: EDWARD stops walking. He looks at ELINOR and realises he can
dialog: stand it no longer.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Would you--can you--excuse me--
text: He takes her face in his hands and kisses her.
scene_heading: EXT. PATH TO BARTON CHURCH - DAY
text: A group of VILLAGE CHILDREN run down the hillside towards
text: the church waving ribbons and dressed in their Sunday best.
scene_heading: EXT. BARTON VILLAGE CHURCH - DAY
text: A large wedding party is gathered outside the church. The
text: entire village is present--CHILDREN, FARMERS, LABOURERS,
text: SHOPKEEPERS, and all our PRINCIPALS. We see MRS JENNINGS in
text: a gigantic mauve bonnet, CHARLOTTE and MR PALMER, SIR JOHN,
text: MRS DASHWOOD, MARGARET, THOMAS, JOHN and FANNY, who is dressed
text: in a fantastically inappropriate concoction, and some MEN in
dialog: regimental uniform.
text: The path to the church is strewn with wild flowers and
text: everyone holds a bunch of their own. The church bells start
text: to peal, and a great cheer goes up as the door opens and
text: BETSY comes out holding the bridal cake aloft.
text: The bride and groom appear: MARIANNE, in white lawn, and
text: COLONEL BRANDON in full uniform. Behind them come EDWARD in
text: his parson's garb and, on his arm, ELINOR as matron of honour.
text: CLOSE on them as they watch the party moving away. MARIANNE
text: and BRANDON make their way forwards, everyone throws their
text: flowers over them, whooping and singing. An open carriage
text: decked with bridal wreaths comes to meet them, and BRANDON
text: lifts MARIANNE in. His melancholy air is all but gone and he
text: radiates joyful life and vigour. MARIANNE also looks extremely
text: happy - but there is a gravity to her joy that makes her
dialog: seem much older.
text: According to the custom of the time, BRANDON throws a large
text: handful of six pences into the crowd, and the VILLAGE CHILDREN
text: jump and dive for them.
text: The coins spin and bounce, catching the sun like jewels. One
text: hits FANNY in the eye. She reels and falls over backwards
text: into a gorse bush. CAM pulls back as the wedding procession
text: makes its glorious way from the church. We draw away into
text: the surrounding countryside.
text: Then we see, on the far edge of frame, very small, a MAN
text: sitting on a white horse, watching. It is WILLOUGHBY. As we
text: draw back further still, he slowly pulls the horse around
text: and moves off in the opposite direction.
