dialog: 
text: Cris 2 reaches the gaming tables and merges with Cris 1.

speaker_heading: Cris (V.O.)
dialog: That's why I stay away from

dialog: 
text: Slot machines. Horse racing. Sports games.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRIS (v.o.)
dialog: And my goal isn't to win big. At

speaker_heading: CRIS (v.o.)
dialog: So no jackpots. No longshots. No

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRIS (V.O.)
dialog: Mainly I stick to blackjack. Boring

dialog: 
text: Cris antes up. Cards are dealt. He's got a four showing.
text: Taking a hit, he goes bust with a jack. So in real time, he
dialog: sticks.

text: Cris strides crisply through the casino. Sees another PAIR OF

text: random. A moment after each turn, a Black Suit appears ahead,
text: behind, or to the side - where they would have spotted Cris.
dialog: 
dialog: Tracking shot / high angle
dialog: 
text: A clearer perspective as TWO BLACK SUITS approach Cris' aisle
text: from different directions. Cris has no way to see them or

dialog: calm fast-walk.
dialog: 
text: Cris studies the gamblers playing the machines nearby, then
text: heads to a particular spot - where he is sure to be spotted -
text: except that a TEXAS-SIZED MAN repositions himself, blocking
text: the Black Suit's view.
dialog: 
text: The Black Suit moves on. Cris shifts to another spot just as
text: a different Black Suit arrives at the other end of the aisle.
text: This time, THREE FRAT BOYS change machines and obscure Cris

dialog:

dialog: 
text: Cris sees her. Recognizes her from his prevision as the woman

dialog: 
text: She sees Cris. Takes off after him.
dialog: 
dialog: Ferris
dialog: (to head mic)
text: He's heading toward...
dialog: (reads sign)
dialog: the Ipanema Grill.
dialog: 
text: Security Staff converge on the area. Cris is in plain sight.

dialog: 
text: Cris continues into the...
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: Kitchen area
dialog: 
text: Passing a room service cart, he rolls it in front of him. A
text: few steps on, he takes the bottle of OLIVE OIL on the cart
text: and pours some in front of one random closed door. Cris then
text: shoves the room service cart down the hall toward an empty
text: intersecting corridor. A Black Suit barrels into the empty
text: intersection just as the cart arrives - and tumbles over it.
text: Behind Cris, a door swings open; a Black Suit charges out;
text: steps precisely into the puddle of poured olive oil - and
text: falls on his ass.
dialog: 
text: Cris slips by him, but gets cut off by an arriving group of
text: FOUR MORE BLACK SUITS. Big guys. They try to grab him. He
text: evades their grasp almost magically and, like a Shaolin Monk,
text: somehow leverages them into each other until they are in a
text: pile on the floor. Cris darts around them into the...
dialog: 
dialog: Lobby
dialog: 
text: He co-opts a luggage cart that is loaded up for delivery.
text: Rolling it to the left, a Black Suit on that side doesn't see
text: him - and moves on. Cris switches to the right side of the
text: card - just as a second Black Suit would have seen him.
dialog: 
text: Abandoning the cart, Cris sets off across the lobby in a
text: herky-jerky rhythm.
dialog: 
text: He walks four quick steps without being seen. Then stops
text: behind a column just as Black Suit 1 turns his way. When
text: Black Suit 1 looks on, Cris resumes his journey, cutting
text: across the lobby at an acute angle. In this way, he avoids
text: being seen by Black Suit 2. Cris now backs up three steps and
text: avoids being seen by Black Suit 3.
dialog: 
dialog: By precisely choosing his movements and knowing where his
dialog: hunters will be looking, Cris achieves something like
dialog: invisibility.
dialog: 
text: The last obstacle to daylight is Ferris. She sees him. He
text: makes a run for the door. She dashes after him.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRIS

speaker_heading: FERRIS

speaker_heading: IRV
dialog: You want my advice? Get yourself a

speaker_heading: IRV
dialog: Make you a secret agent.

speaker_heading: IrV
dialog: No, you two stay here. I'll watch
dialog: the food.

text: Once out of Ferris' eyeline, Irv queries Cris with his hand
text: in the shape of a gun. Cris shakes his head, then turns to
text: Ferris - and waits for her to begin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: You're wasting your life, Cris. You
dialog: have the most amazing talent, and
dialog: you're running from it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRIS
dialog: Yeah, people say I could have been
dialog: a chef.
dialog: 
dialog: Ferris
dialog: Don't be cute. There's too much at

dialog: 
text: Her gravity anchors him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: Now if you say that man in the
dialog: liquor store was going to shoot
dialog: five people, I believe you. Why
dialog: else would you kill a stranger?
dialog: 
text: Cris guards his reaction.

speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: But no good deed goes unpunished,

speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 29.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FERRIS (cont'd)
dialog: And that's how it's going to be in

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRIS
dialog: Everyone but you, of course.

speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: I can fix your legal problems. More

speaker_heading: CRIS

text: Ferris looks at him, disapproving.

speaker_heading: FERRIS

dialog: That's not an option. Your country

speaker_heading: CRIS
dialog: Nobody's grabbed me yet.
dialog:

dialog: You're up against more powerful
dialog: forces now.

text: She lets that sink in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: I'd like you to come with me for
dialog: some testing. Would you be willing

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CrIS
text: Medium coffee, black, and a glazed.
dialog: 
text: As he waits, he sees a vague REFLECTION in the GLASS DISPLAY
text: CASE: a SQUARE CROSS, coming into focus.
dialog: 
text: Puzzled, Cris looks up and around to see the object that's
text: being reflected. He can't find it. Cris turns back to the
text: display case, but the reflection is gone. The DONUT GIRL
text: gives him his order.
dialog: 
text: Cris takes it, turns, and notices LIZ COOPER sitting by
text: herself at a booth, circling items in the classified section.
text: He recognizes her as the future mother of his future child.
dialog: 
text: Cris gazes at her face, which is both childish and mature,
text: shy yet indomitable.
dialog: 
text: She turns, scowling, from the staring stranger.
dialog: 
text: Cris approaches Liz and gives her that smile that always
dialog: works.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRIS

dialog: 
scene_heading: SNAPBACK TO:
dialog: 
text: The Donut Girl gives Cris his order. Now confident he's found

speaker_heading: CRIS

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHITE ROOM
dialog: 
text: Size of a squash court. Cris enters gingerly and peers

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: Cris, we'll be firing at you with
dialog: live ammo. Are you ready?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WisDOM
dialog: You're shooting your secret weapon?
dialog: 
text: Ferris signals Wisdom to be patient. Cris just stands there,
text: flatfooted, arms folded, unafraid.
dialog: 
text: Ferris nods. A Techie presses a button. The THREE RIFLES
speaker_heading: FIRE.
dialog: 
text: Cris is hit square in the chest!
dialog: 
text: By THREE BLUE PAINTBALLS.

speaker_heading: CrIS
dialog: You're paying for the shirt.

speaker_heading: WisDOM

speaker_heading: CRIS
dialog: "From now on, Cris, the bullets are
dialog: real."
dialog: 
text: Ferris sits back and nods to the techies to proceed.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BARE WHITE CHAMBER
dialog: 
text: Cris balances, at the ready, as the three rifles take aim at
text: him. He LUNGES at the very instant that one rifle FIRES. A
text: bullet ZINGS by his ear.
dialog: 
text: As the second rifle fires, Cris contorts -- and a bullet
text: parts his hair.
dialog: 
text: As the third rifles fires, he tumbles away, almost a blur.
dialog: 
text: More shots, in rapid sequence, erratic rhythm. Two at a time.
text: Three at a time.
dialog: 
text: Like a pinball, Cris pivots, crouches, dodges every bullet.
text: Then suddenly stops. Stands there. An easy target. Click,
text: click, click, the guns are out of bullets.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: He's almost impossible to shoot,

speaker_heading: WISDOM
dialog: Mind if I try?

speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: Be my guest.

speaker_heading: WisDOM
dialog: How do you know it's prevision?

text: Cris walks through the doorway into...
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE SMALLER WHITE ROOM
dialog: 
text: which is familiar from the opening sequence, but not exactly
text: the same. Because it's not exactly the same future. A HEAVY
text: CHAIR, bolted to the floor, faces a PLASMA SCREEN MONITOR on
text: the wall. To the left of the screen is a MIRROR; to the
text: right, a DIGITAL CLOCK-CALENDAR.
dialog: 
text: Ferris' FACE appears on the monitor.
dialog: 
dialog: Ferris on monitor
dialog: Cris, it's time to get started with
dialog: the next test. This won't be
dialog: unpleasant. We just need to you sit
text: in the chair.
dialog: 
text: Cris eyes the chair with suspicion.
dialog: 
dialog: 101.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: Ferris on monitor
dialog: I want you to look ahead, tell me
text: the time on the clock and then tell
dialog: me what film clip you see playing.
dialog: Let's start with five minutes from
dialog: now. Then we'll press ahead as far
dialog: as you're capable of.
dialog: (to Wisdom)
text: The clips have been assembled at
dialog: random by a computer, so nobody
dialog: knows what'll be playing next.
dialog: 
text: Cris looks into the mirror and sees his face reflected - as
text: an old man. He turns away.

dialog: Look, I'll stand here and tell you

scene_heading: INTERCUT BOOTH / WHITE ROOM

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRIS
dialog: I know what happens.

speaker_heading: Ferris oN MONITOR

speaker_heading: CRIS
dialog: You tie me down and never let me

dialog: 
text: Wisdom looks at Ferris. She shrugs, sheepish.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FerriS
dialog: That's only because you won't

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRIS
dialog: Because you're trying to force me.

dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: Ferris ON MONITOR
dialog: (severe)
dialog: Now sit in the chair. One. Two.
dialog: Three.
dialog: 
text: Ferris switches the toggle. The sizzle of electricity.

dialog: 
text: Ferris turns away, then makes herself look.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WISDOM
dialog: Whoa, you are one tough bitch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: We're still in a Code Red if I'm
dialog: not mistaken.
dialog: 
text: She turns off the juice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WISDOM

dialog: chose to resist.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: He's almost never had to face
dialog: consequences.
dialog: (flips toggle)
dialog: Cris, are you ready to get in the
dialog: chair?
dialog: 
text: Cris, recovering, shoots her the finger.
dialog: 
text: She switches the toggle again - and leaves it on. Wisdom

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: We need information, right?
dialog: 
text: Cris collapses, unconscious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FERRIS

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WISDOM
dialog: Okay, how do we use him to find the
dialog: bombs?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: Simple. We make him watch the news
dialog: and tell us about it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WISDOM
dialog: How far ahead can he see?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: I don't know. But I suspect we can
dialog: increase his range with practice.
dialog: Especially if we restrict his
dialog: future to only watching news. Then
dialog: he'll be like a timescope.
dialog: 
text: Wisdom nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WISDOM
dialog: You were right. This is huge.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: This is just for starters. You want
text: to stage a pre-emptive strike, he
dialog: can tell you if you'll hit the
dialog: target and whether they hit back
dialog: and what went wrong. And you can do
dialog: this over and over until you get it
dialog: perfect before you begin.
dialog: 
text: Wisdom chuckles at the enormity of the potential.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: wisDOM
dialog: And all he's ever done with it is a
dialog: little gambling and securities
dialog: fraud?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FeRRIS
dialog: I know, it's amazing; but he's not
dialog: ambitious.

dialog: We control him now. We just have to
dialog: keep it that way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WISDOM
dialog: Right now, sweetheart, we can't
text: even get him to sit in a chair.
dialog: 
text: Dread suddenly washes over Wisdom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WISDOM

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WISDOM
dialog: With this guy, you have to. Or
dialog: it'll be over before it begins.
dialog: 
dialog: Ferris
dialog: So we'll keep him in chains.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WISDOM
dialog: That may not be enough. We may
text: have to cut off his arms and legs.
dialog: Then I might start to feel safe.
dialog: 
text: Ferris grins uncomfortably.
dialog: 
dialog: Ferris
dialog: You're not serious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WISDOM
dialog: Think about it. What we're talking
dialog: about here is the next step in
dialog: human evolution. And I'm not gonna
dialog: make the same mistake the
dialog: Neanderthals made when they ran
dialog: across this good-looking Homo
dialog: Sapien fellow and all the lady

speaker_heading: FERRIS

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHITE ROOM
dialog: 
text: Cris rises from the floor into a crouched position, like an
text: animal ready to pounce.
dialog: 
text: The door flies open and A DOZEN ARMED MP's charge in, rifles
text: at the ready, and surround Cris. Cris checks the time on the
text: digital clock. It's 5:12 PM.
dialog: 
dialog: Corridors
dialog: 
text: Ferris and Wisdom getting closer; he's on a cellphone.

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHITE ROOM
dialog: 
text: Motionless, in a crouch...Cris suddenly dashes between two

dialog: 
dialog: White room
dialog: 
text: Where in some future Cris is once again surrounded by the
text: Dozen MP's who are actually outside, waiting to charge in.
text: Suddenly, Cris pounces low at one soldier's hips, shoving him
text: into the soldier next to him, which knocks over a third
text: soldier. Cris dashes for the door, but four MP's pull him
text: away before he can get out. [Attempt #2]
dialog: 
speaker_heading: Observation ROOM

dialog:

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: observation ROOM
dialog:

text: It's 5:09 PM. Just minutes before The MP's will charge into
dialog: the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHITE ROOM
dialog: 
text: Cris runs to the door and tries to bar it so they can't

dialog: 
text: Faster and faster, over and over, Cris relives the attack,
text: perfecting his movements, finding new opportunities. His
text: skill increases with each iteration as he anticipates every
text: soldier's action and counters it with the greatest economy of
dialog: means. [Attempts #7-12]
dialog: 
text: The fight takes on the quality of choreography as the MP's
text: seem to step right into Cris' punches and kicks. Cris flips
text: and throws them into each other, leveraging their movements
dialog: to achieve his goals with perfect efficiency.
dialog: 
text: But Cris still can't quite get out the door.

speaker_heading: wiSDOM (plasma screen)
dialog: Cris, don't you feel some sense of

dialog: new "finale" and...
dialog: 
text: Elegantly slips past all the MP's into the hall - and slams

text: command, shielding him from gunfire.
dialog: 
dialog: 111.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Security Police pour out from the other side. Cris reaches

dialog: 
text: Cris stops, thinks, then charges out shooting, fighting,
text: running -- completing a condensed burst of four impossible
text: tasks that get him to the next point of refuge.
dialog: 
text: He waits, thinks, charges and, with another burst of
text: choreographed action, makes it into an elevator whose doors
text: conveniently open at that moment. He darts inside, keeps
text: shooting, presses certain buttons - starting several stories

scene_heading: EXPLORATION SEQUENCE
dialog: 
text: Cris drops down from a ventillator shaft into an office. He
text: opens the door, walks into a corridor, and strides forward,
text: preternaturally calm.
dialog: 
text: He advances through an unfolding panorama of "stage sets" on
text: which different hypothetical scenarios play out, one at a
text: time, several simultaneously, or layered in like the melodic
text: themes in a round or fugue, creating the visual equivalent of
text: harmony and counterpoint.
dialog: 
text: Cris encounters Security Police searching for him. When they
text: discover Cris, they aim their weapons at him. He checks the
text: time. Snapback a few seconds. He hides before they arrive.
dialog: 
text: He goes through a door into a room. People are there.
text: Snapback. Hides in a different room. It's empty. Cris
text: searches the room. Looks in the desk drawers. Puts things in
text: his pockets. The door flies open. Security Police find him
dialog: and shoot. Snapback.
dialog: 
dialog: 114.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Cris treads down empty corridors. He multiplies into a legion
text: of Cris Johnsons, duplicated again and again, as he explores
text: room after room, searching them sequentially. Simultaneously.
dialog: 
text: He spends much time in a Handyman's Storeroom, while other
text: Cris Johnson's fade away.
dialog: 
text: Cris 27 finds the surveillance room with Leo in charge. Cris
text: scans the room. He is seen. He waits to see who will shoot
text: him first. He is hit in the chest. Fade out.
dialog: 
text: Cris 35 gets caught by two Security Police. He fights them,
text: takes their guns, but gets killed by reinforcements.
dialog: 
text: Cris 63 waits in a room and peers through a crack in the door
text: as his POV FAST FORWARDS, and he charts the comings and
text: goings of the search parties, until they discover him, at
text: which point he snapsback and hides in a different room. He's
text: hiding in many rooms simultaneously. Spying. Piecing together
text: the schedule of the patrol in that corridor.
dialog: 
text: The same situations repeat. Scanning for security cameras.
text: Fighting. Winning. Losing. Dying.
dialog: 
text: He goes down a stairwell. One version of himself exits at a
text: landing. A second iteration of himself continues to the next
text: floor down. At that landing, two iterations of himself turn
text: in different directions, left and right.
dialog: 
text: We follow the one that went to the left.
dialog: 
text: He sees MP's taking Liz from her holding room and escorting
text: her somewhere else.
dialog: 
text: He follows. Gets seen. By her. By them. Snapback.
dialog: 
text: He is waiting in several locations, watching to see where the
text: MP's will emerge with Liz. The MP's and Liz emerge from an
text: elevator in one of the locations. The other Cris' fade out.
dialog: 
text: Liz is ushered into a room and locked inside. Four guards
text: depart. Two guards remain posted outside. They see Cris.
dialog: 
text: He runs down stairs. Into the corridor. Into the room
text: directly under the room where Liz is being held.
dialog: 
text: Cris enters A FORENSICS LAB where the captured bomb is being
text: studied. There is a barrel of C4 PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE. MP's in
text: the room turn on him and open fire. Cris is blasted and falls
text: to the floor, dead. Snapback to...

scene_heading: VENTILLATION DUCT
dialog: 
text: Cris, where he started, motionless as a hibernating bear,
text: exploring his futures. CAMERA passes through walls, floors,
text: ceilings and finds Baines rushing through the corridors.
text: Baines enters...
dialog: 
dialog: Wisdom's office
dialog: 
text: Where Wisdom paces with one crutch while Ferris sits on a
text: sofa like Rodin's Thinker, in concentration almost as deep as
dialog: Cris'.
dialog: 
dialog: Baines
dialog: He hasn't gotten out through any
dialog: exit. The bad news is...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: wisdOM
dialog: You've lost him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BAINES
dialog: I'm issuing infrared to all my men.
dialog: We should have a fix in a few
dialog: minutes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WISDOM
dialog: You realize if he gets away now,
dialog: we'll never get him back. He'll be

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FeRRIS
dialog: I know how to flush him out.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: We don't actually have to do
dialog: anything.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We just have to decide to do

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: int. ground floor of facility - DAY
dialog: 
text: Guards stand in a solid line. No way out. Cris off to one
text: side, in a niche just inside the door. Camera pans and finds
text: a second Cris standing back, away from an exit. Pans and
text: finds a legion of Cris Johnsons, duplicated again and again,
text: trying each exit.
dialog: 
text: At one dim exit, he lies on the ground, charred and dead,
text: next to the gauntlet of MP's he has tried to outrun.
dialog: 
dialog: Wisdom's office
dialog: 
text: Wisdom and Baines are looking at each other, appalled, then
dialog: turn to Ferris.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WISDOM
dialog: You want me to threaten to kill a
dialog: pregnant woman?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: Threats don't count. When he
dialog: foresees that you actually did kill
dialog: her, that she's dead...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He won't let it happen. - He'll
dialog: come to us. Surrender. And she'll
dialog: live.
dialog: 
text: Wisdom regards her with perverse admiration.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: But it only works if we're not
dialog: bluffing. Because he'll know.
dialog: 
text: Wisdom considers the decision that lies ahead for him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NEAR THE LOBBY - DAY
dialog: 
text: Cris is still trying to get out the front door, but there's
text: one Soldier, call him CRACK SHOT, who kills Cris repeatedly.
text: Cris snapsback and tries various tactics, but he can't get
text: past Crack Shot alive.
dialog: 
text: He gives up. Turns and runs back into the heart of the
dialog: building.
dialog: 
text: Cris' mental pov expands to include the entire facility, like
text: a crystal doll house. Simultaneously, he is observing every
text: room, present in every room, charting the place, testing
dialog: possible actions.
dialog: 
dialog: 117.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The facility is a bee hive of activity. A bee hive that
dialog: accelerates to fast forward -- until all times are
text: simultaneous. Until the simultaneous activity is made even
text: denser by the accumulated layers of possibility.
dialog: 
text: Cris-134 spies Ferris and Wisdom walking together. He follows
text: them for a while, until he is discovered. Cris-134 fades out.
text: The Ferris and Wisdom who saw him fade out. But another
text: Ferris and Wisdom continue through the building, and their
text: trail gets picked up by Cris-62, who has detoured in order
dialog: to encounter them.
dialog: 
text: As Cris' goals are accomplished, superfluous versions of
text: himself fade away.
dialog: 
text: The surveillance of a sequence of Ferris-and-Wisdoms is
text: continued by Cris-91, then Cris-14, who watches as Wisdom and
text: Ferris approach two guards standing outside an INTERROGATION
text: ROOM. We recognize them as the MP's who are guarding Liz,
text: inside. Wisdom is let into the Interrogation Room by the
text: MP's. Ferris proceeds into a nearby office alone.

scene_heading: vENTILLATION duct
dialog: 
text: Cris comes out of his trance. Checks his watch. Sixteen
text: minutes have passed.
dialog: 
text: Cris composes his thoughts, takes a breath, then crawls
text: forward, leaving no Cris behind. Now it's for real.
dialog: 
text: A moment after he rounds a corner, A FLASHLIGHT BEAM stabs
text: into the duct that he vacated. It scans around. Withdraws.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NOTE:
dialog: 
text: The situations that Cris has just previewed from the
text: Ventillator Shaft constitute the raw material that he will
text: now re-craft into a single narrative: the story of his actual
text: escape attempt, staged in long takes, unfolding in almost-
dialog: real time. When appropriate, to illustrate Cris' ability, we
text: will portray several locations simultaneously via split-
text: screens which change in number, size, shape, and placement.

scene_heading: INT. HANDYMAN'S STOREROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Ceiling. The ventillator grill pops open. Cris drops to the
text: floor. He grabs a backpack conveniently hanging on a hook.
text: Without the slightest hesitation, he goes from shelf to box
text: to drawer, loading particular objects into the backpack.
dialog: 
dialog: 118.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORRIDOR
dialog: 
text: Empty. A door opens. Cris steps out into the hall carrying

scene_heading: SURVEILLANCE ROOM

speaker_heading: CORRIDOR
dialog: 
text: SOLDIER PETE and SOLDIER BRIAN charge into an empty corridor
text: and begin their search for Cris.
dialog: 
text: A door slams open, bashing Pete in the face. Cris breaks his
text: shooting arm, grabs his M-16, hides behind the door, and
text: sprays bullets low, hitting Brian in the shins. He runs to
text: Brian, breaks his shooting arm, takes his rifle. Drags Brian
text: and Pete into an open room. Tapes their mouths.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SURVEILLANCE ROOM
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WEST STAIRWELL - DAY
dialog: 
text: Cris pours floor polish in specific places.
dialog: 
text: SOLDIER KYLE and his TROOP charge out off the stairwell. Each
text: one steps directly into the polish and slips.
dialog: 
text: As they fall, Cris punches them out or puts them in
text: chokeholds, utilizing the elegant minimum of force or
text: violence. Child's play. As soon as they are unconscious, Cris
text: takes their guns, tear gas, and a gas mask.
dialog: 
dialog: 119.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORRIDOR
dialog:

speaker_heading: GUARD DOG.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANOTHER CORRIDOR
dialog: 
text: Cris lies in wait for the patrol. When they appear, he is
text: perfectly placed to mace each dog and each soldier with a
text: quick spritz. He goes back and sprays them again, to keep
dialog: them out of commission.
dialog: 
dialog: Surveillance room
dialog: 
text: Cris appears on several screens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: He's on this floor!...Shit! He's
dialog: coming here!
dialog: 
text: The door opens. A tear gas canister flies in. A moment later,
text: Cris charges in wearing a gas mask.
dialog: 
text: He opens fire at the video monitors, shattering every one.
dialog: 
text: By the time the MP's are ready to respond, Cris reaches and
text: grabs Baines' handgun. He swings out into the corridor with
text: Baines' gun in his hand...Without looking, his hand aims and
text: shoots several times.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORRIDOR
dialog: 
text: Emerging into the hallway, Cris looks down at the end of the
text: hall and sees two MP's falling to the floor, wounded.
dialog: 
text: Cris wraps electrical tape around the door handle and a pipe
text: on the wall, sealing the room shut, then turns and maces the
text: last of the dogs.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SURVEILLANCE ROOM
dialog: 
text: As the tear gas clears, the damage is visible. Every monitor

speaker_heading: FERRIS

speaker_heading: WISDOM

speaker_heading: BAINES

dialog: 
scene_heading: CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INTERROGATION ROOM
dialog: 
text: Baines and the four MP's arrives with Liz. Baines, Liz, and

dialog: check out the room.
dialog: 
dialog: 121.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: We expect them to find Cris. But they don't.
dialog: 
text: Outside, in the hall, a pencil rolls on the floor toward Liz.
text: She notices it and looks where it came from. Sees Cris,
text: hiding behind a janitor's cart. He puts his fist over his
dialog: heart. Gesture of love.
dialog: 
text: The two MP's in the room signal for Liz to be brought inside.
dialog: 
text: Two MP's outside the room bring her in. Baines stays on guard
text: outside.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INTERROGATION ROOM
dialog: 
text: While the Guards stand on alert, Liz sits in a chair and
text: discovers a piece of paper on a side table, placed exactly
text: where her hand has come to rest. On the paper, in pencil, a
text: square with a square cross within. She flips over the note.
text: It reads, "GO CRAZY!"
dialog: 
text: She considers, then SCREAMS as loud as she can while running
text: around wildly.
dialog: 
scene_heading: OUTSIDE INTERROGATION ROOM
dialog: 
text: Hearing the commotion, Baines opens the door. Behind his
text: back, Cris steps from hiding, opens the door to a room and
text: slips inside, closing the door just as Baines looks back.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INTERROGATION ROOM
dialog: 
text: The MP's force Liz into a chair behind a desk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Sit there and shut up.
dialog: 
text: Liz sees a drawer which is partially open. She looks inside.
text: Sees a hefty pair of scissors. Inside the drawer, a message
text: is written on the wood. "5:44, stab Wisdom." She looks at a
text: clock in the room. 5:41. But Wisdom isn't there.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WISDOM
dialog: Get more men up here.
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: INTERROGATION ROOM
dialog: 
text: Liz anxiously checks the clock. 5:43 and still no Wisdom.
text: Then the door opens. And Wisdom enters.
dialog: 
text: They study each other, neither knowing the other's plans. She
text: glances aside at the clock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FERRIS' OFFICE
dialog: 
text: She picks up the phone. Dials a number.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: This is Ferris. I'll need a chopper

dialog: 
text: Behind her, Cris steps out of hiding. By the time she sees
text: him, his forearm is around her neck.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM
dialog: 
text: At 5:44, Liz grabs the scissors, lunges at Wisdom, and stabs
text: at his neck. He raises his arm in time to block the blow.
dialog: 
dialog: 123.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The two MP's in the room fight her off, calling to the

dialog: 
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE INTERROGATION ROOM
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORRIDOR

dialog:

speaker_heading: CRIS
dialog: To a gang of murderers?
dialog: 
text: Ferris seems pleased.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: I see you got our message.
dialog: 
text: He checks his watch. 5:54.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRIS
dialog: What's about to happen...you've
dialog: brought it on yourselves.
dialog: 
text: Cris changes course and charges into a...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAIRWELL
dialog: 
text: which he descends at a run, roughly dragging Ferris with him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: fERRIS
dialog: It's not too late Cris. You can

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRIS
dialog: I'm planning on it.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORRIDOR
dialog: 
text: Cris charges out of the stairwell, shooting without
dialog: hesitation - forward, left, right, back - efficiently
text: targeting Security Police in the precise order of their
text: imminent readiness to fire at him. For each bullet, one

dialog: 
text: Wisdom's voice comes over the P.A. System.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WiSDOM (o.S.)
dialog: Johnson, this is Wisdom. It's 5:55.
dialog: You have five minutes to turn
dialog: yourself in...
dialog: 
text: Cris and Ferris keep moving.
dialog: 
dialog: Wisdom (o.S.)
dialog: Or your worst nightmare will

dialog: 
text: Cris marches right up to the Interrogation Room where Wisdom
text: holds Liz prisoner, using Ferris as a human shield.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WisDOM (o.S.)
dialog: Look ahead if you don't believe me.
dialog: 
text: Cris opens the door to the room, revealing Wisdom, Ferris,
text: and thirty Security Police and MP's - who take aim at him and

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SnAPBACK TO:
dialog: 
text: Cris crouches on the floor outside the Interrogation Room,

scene_heading: INT. FORENSIC LAB - DAY
dialog:

text: He guns down several armed MP's whom he knows would be

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRIS
dialog: Get out!
dialog: 
text: They flee. Cris locks himself and Ferris inside.
dialog: 
text: Cris goes over to the bomb. Squints for a beat. IN FAST
text: FORWARD, CONDENSED TIME, MULTIPLE SNAPBACK, he goes through
text: the whole learning curve on bomb detonation, blowing himself
text: up - and snapping back to life -- several times before
dialog: figuring out the right way to set it off.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INTERROGATION ROOM
dialog:

speaker_heading: THE LAB
dialog:

scene_heading: INTERROGATION ROOM
dialog: 
text: As Wisdom prepares to the pull the trigger, the bomb explodes
text: in a giant cataclysm.
dialog: 
dialog: Smoke and dust
dialog: 
text: Roiling. Opaque. Then clearing.
dialog: 
text: The center of the building
dialog: 
text: is gone. A jagged raw atrium extends several stories down and
dialog: up.
dialog: 
text: To the side, on a narrow ledge of floor extending from a
text: wall...crouches Liz. The only person remaining. She has
dialog: survived by inches. Very precise.
dialog: 
text: As she recovers from the blast, a door opens behind her. Cris

scene_heading: INT. JET - NIGHT

dialog: 
text: They continue into the main cabin, where Neal, the Showgirl,
text: the Pilots, and the Flight Attendant are glued to the
text: television. Neal sees Cris and Liz, but hardly acknowledges
text: them. He's in shock. They all are.

speaker_heading: TV NewsCASTER (o.S.)
dialog: The situation in Chicago is not

dialog: on the other hand, may require the

dialog: 
text: Liz and Cris look at each other, ashen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: This is what they wanted you to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRIS
dialog: I guess...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: And you wouldn't help?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRIS
dialog: They didn't explain. They were
dialog: trying to force me.
dialog: 
text: Liz shakes her head, incredulous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CrIS
dialog: They were gonna make me a slave.
dialog: 
text: She looks at Cris like he's scum - and heads for the front of
dialog: the plane.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRIS
dialog: Liz? Where are you going?
dialog: 
dialog: Liz
dialog: To the doctor.
dialog: 
text: She walks out of the jet and down the steps.

speaker_heading: NEAL
dialog: She's not coming with us?

scene_heading: LIZ'S HOUSE - DAWN
dialog: 
text: Where Cris lies in bed with Liz's head on his chest, the

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. Wisdom's HOUSE - dawn
dialog:

dialog: Ferris.
dialog:

dialog: This is Cris Johnson.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: Where did you get this number?
dialog:

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CrIS
dialog: I want to cooperate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: That's music to my ears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRIS
dialog: But I have conditions.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: I'm sure we can work something out.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRIS
dialog: Liz...
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Her eyes flicker open. She sees him looking down at her like

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LiZ
dialog: Come back to bed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRIS
dialog: I can't. - I have to go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: You're not leaving?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRIS
dialog: There's something I have to do.
dialog: Something you'd want me to do. And
dialog: I can't put it off any longer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: (wounded)
dialog: Fine. Then go. What do I care?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRIS
dialog: Liz, it's not like that. I searched
dialog: for you for a long time. I want to
dialog: be with you forever.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Don't overdo it. We just met last
dialog: night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRIS
dialog: But a lot has happened since then.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: While I was sleeping?
dialog: 
text: He proceeds with difficulty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRIS
dialog: We're going to have a child.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Then you really are an angel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRIS
dialog: I don't expect you to believe me.
dialog: But when you do find out, remember
dialog: that we came together for a reason.
dialog: That this wasn't just...one night.
dialog: It was a special chance for both of
dialog: us.

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Seeing his misery, she softens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Then why are you running away from

dialog: 
text: He holds back tears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRIS
dialog: I'm not...I'm taking the long way
dialog: around.
dialog: 
text: Now she's crying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I don't understand. We got off to
dialog: such a great start.
dialog: 
text: He nods, wistful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRIS
dialog: And I looked for a happy ending...
dialog: But this was the best I could do.
dialog: 
text: They kiss good-bye, and she makes it so wickedly sweet that
text: he can barely pull himself away.
dialog: 
text: Liz watches, mystified, as he leaves - stirred by feelings
dialog: for Cris that are just coming into being.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: See ya?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRIS
dialog: I wouldn't be surprised.
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: Ext. LiZ'S HOUSE - DAY

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. Ferris' car - DAY
dialog:

speaker_heading: CRIS
dialog: I wasn't ready till now.
dialog: 
text: Ferris shifts into gear and drives off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: We don't have time to waste. Maybe
dialog: you could start by telling me how
dialog: your talent works.
dialog: 
text: He thinks how to phrase it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRIS
dialog: "The future ain't what it used to
dialog: be." Ever hear that expression?
dialog: 
scene_heading: Ext./Int. front window of cottage - DAY
dialog: 
text: Liz watches from inside as Ferris' car pulls away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRIS (v.O.)
dialog: It's a joke, but it's true. The
dialog: future changes every time you look
dialog: at it. Because you looked at it.
dialog: Cause once you see it, you're
dialog: different. And that changes
dialog: everything else.
