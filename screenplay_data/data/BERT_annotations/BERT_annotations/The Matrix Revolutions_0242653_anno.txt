text: Iam, at it again.
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: You know what happened to Neo?
speaker_heading: ORACLE
text: Yes. He is trapped in a place between
dialog: this world and the Machine World. There
dialog: are links that have been constructed like
dialog: islands, used for trafficking
text: information. Somehow Neo washed up onto
text: one of them. The only way to rejoin his

dialog: through this world.
scene_heading: GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27, 2002 8.
dialog: 510
speaker_heading: PRINITY
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: ORACLE
dialog: It won't be easy. The link is controlled
text: by a program called the Trainman. He uses
dialog: it to smuggle programs in and out of the
text: Matrix. If he finds out where Neo is
dialog: before you get to him, then I'm afraid
dialog: our choices are going to become
dialog: difficult.
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ORACLE
dialog: Because of who the Trainman works for.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: The Merovingian.
speaker_heading: ORACLE
dialog: He has placed a bounty on your lives. You
dialog: must be careful at all times. Seraph

speaker_heading: SERAPH
dialog: Oh no.

scene_heading: INT. MACHINE CITY TOWER -— NIGHT 758
text: The entire passageway comes alive around Neo as cables and

text: under him and filling every jack.
text: A cobra-like cable rises up to the back of Neo'’s neck
text: pausing, its needle probing at the brain-jack.
speaker_heading: DEUS EX MACHTNA
dialog: AND IF YOU FAIL?
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: IT won't.

scene_heading: EXT. MATRIX CITY STREET - NIGHT 760
text: A sick green-black sky vomits a raging storm upon the urban
text: night-scape below. Lightning spits from every cloud like the
text: constant flicker of snake tongues.
text: Black boots stride down the center of the rain soaked street.
text: We follow as Neo walks, glancing left, then right at a city
text: of Agent Smiths. They line the streets, their perfect
text: silhouettes filling the windows of skyscrapers. It is a city
text: of dark-suited, sunglass-wearing shadows.
text: Lightning flash-bulbs a group of them, staring at Neo,
text: smiling identically.
text: A singular Smith enters the street and turns towards Neo,
text: walking at him until they stand, like gun fighters--
text: Face to face.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Mr. Anderson. Welcome back. We missed
dialog: you.
text: Rain pours off his face as lightning pitch-~forks the sky
text: behind him.
speaker_heading: SMITH (CONT'D)
dialog: Like what I’ve done with the place?

speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: The only place you can beat me, Smith-~
text: He snaps open his coat, his body automatically settling into
text: a defensive position.
speaker_heading: NEO (CONT'D)
dialog: Is in your dreams.
text: Smith’s smile twists into a sneer and he hurls himself at his
dialog: enemy.
text: The first exchange is a squall, fast and furious, as
text: lightning strobes the water exploding with every blow.
text: They mirror one another, neither one gaining or losing ground
text: until each sees the exact same opening-~-
text: Simultaneously delivering a thunder packed punch that sends
text: both men flying backwards-—-
text: Neo flips and lands gracefully, while Smith smashes down,
text: concrete buckling beneath him.
text: Smith growls, cocking and loading himself, then firing out,
text: hurtling up through the driving rain as--
text: Neo leaps to meet him and they collide high above the street.
text: Two egual and opposite forces slamming together like atoms
text: smashing as an expanding sphere of energy is unleashed from
dialog: the collision--
text: A globe of glass clearing away the rain swelling until it
text: breaks open against the surrounding urban cliffs.
text: The two men remain suspended in mid-air, battling, fists and
text: feet thrown with particle-accelerator speed.
text: Neo fights with ultimate precision, but Smith has become
text: overwhelmingly powerful. A blow snaps Neo’s head back,
text: sending his glasses flying and before he recovers--
text: Smith grabs him, spinning like a decathlete in the hammer
dialog: toss, and releases~-—
text: Hurling Neo into the side of a building.

text: He smashes into the building like a bullet, another seismic
text: wave of damage shattering the face of the building, following
text: the initial impact, the way thunder follows lightning.
scene_heading: INT. MATRIX BUILDING - NIGHT 761
text: Looking back through the bored opening his body just created,
text: Neo barely has time to stand before Smith barrels into him.
text: The battle rages through the building, Smith pummeling Neo
dialog: with wrecking ball force--~
text: Smashing him through walls of concrete, brick and steel.
text: Smith steps through one of the holes as Neo struggles to get
text: back on his feet.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Can you feel it, Mr. Anderson? Closing in
dialog: on you once more? I can.
text: Once more, Neo picks himself up.
speaker_heading: SMITH (CONT'D)
dialog: I really should thank you for it. After
dialog: all, it was your life that taught me the
dialog: purpose of all life.
text: He smiles.
speaker_heading: SMITH (CONT'D)
dialog: The purpose of life is to end.
text: Neo settles into a pose we have seen before. He signals to
dialog: Smith, “come get some.”
text: Nothing frustrates Smith as much as that little wave.
text: Another fury roars through the building, but this one ends
text: with Neo unloading an explosion of kicks culminating in-~
text: Bullet Time; a final boot launched like a LAS rocket,
dialog: blasting Smith--
scene_heading: EXT. MATRIX CITY STREET - NIGHT 762
text: Out of the building, sailing back through the sheets of rain

text: Smith grinds his teeth and launches himself back at him while
text: Neo dives into the open air and--
text: Again they fly at each other, the impact of this collision
dialog: much more powerful than the first as--
text: Waves of force shatter windows and rip lamp posts from the
text: concrete like a hurricane uprooting trees.
scene_heading: EXT. MATRIX CITY STREET - MID~AIR - NIGHT 763
text: They fight in mid-air, punching, kicking, grappling, locked
text: together but in constant motion like electrons chasing each
dialog: other around a single nucleus~-
text: Oblivious to the height, they rise up beyond the city’s glass
text: towers until they are amidst the flashing electric tongues of
text: lightning and the city is a distant pattern of light beneath
dialog: them.
text: Smith lands a series of savage blows that stun Neo and he
text: slips down, twisting, lost for a moment, suddenly vulnerable.
text: Above him, Smith rises up just as twin bolts of lightning
text: strike, haloing the dark-suited demon with jagged broken rays
dialog: of light. -
text: With the crashing din of thunder that follows, Smith attacks.
text: Diving down, he slams into Neo, tackling him, driving him
dialog: back to the earth--
text: Streaking like a comet, faster than the rain, plummeting past
text: the mirrored towers as Neo struggles to get free, fighting,
text: even as the inevitability of the ground rushes towards them
dialog: and-~
text: The unstoppable force meets the immovable object.
scene_heading: EXT. MATRIX STREET CRATER ~- NIGHT 764
text: The concussive blast craters the street, buckling buildings,
text: as a wave of unequaled destruction rushes out over the urban
dialog: chasm.
text: The explosion thunders away until there is only the hissing
text: rain, as the Smiths gather along the crater’s edge.
text: Inside the bowl of earth is the exposed viscera of the
text: metropolis; broken pipes, sparking cables and rent sewers.
text: The rain on his face slowly brings Neo’s consciousness back.

speaker_heading: SMITH (CONT'D)
dialog: Why do you do it? Why get up? Why keep
dialog: fighting?
text: Neo rolls over, pushing himself to his hands and knees.
speaker_heading: SMITH (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you believe you’re fighting for
dialog: something? For more than your survival?
dialog: Can you tell me what: it is? Do you even
dialog: know?
text: Neo glares at him with animal-like eyes.
speaker_heading: SMITH (CONT'D)
dialog: Is it freedom? Or truth? Perhaps peace?
dialog: Yes? No? Could it be for love?
text: He laughs.
speaker_heading: SMITH (CONT'D)
dialog: Tllusions, Mr. Anderson. Vagaries of
text: perception. The temporary constructs of a
text: feeble human intellect trying desperately
dialog: to justify an existence that is without
dialog: meaning or purpose.
text: Neo’s hands clench into fists.
speaker_heading: SMITH (CONT'D)
dialog: And all of them as artificial as the
text: Matrix itself, although only a human mind
dialog: could invent something as insipid as
dialog: love.
text: Rain streaks the mud down Neo’s face like black tears.
speaker_heading: SMITH (CONT'D)
dialog: You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson.

speaker_heading: NEO

text: Smith howls in frustration, hurling at him, but Nec absorbs
text: the attack, catching Smith momentarily off-balance-~
text: Firing back a furious attack that has Smith reeling, unable
text: to defend himself as Neo loads up a bomb. It is not a punch;
dialog: it is a cannonball--
text: Shot into Bullet Time; his fist shattering through the glass-—
text: like rods of rain as it hurls at Smith-~
text: Connecting flush, distorting his features as the flesh of his
text: face is knocked loose and his eyes go blank.
text: He staggers, stunned, out on his feet as Neo hauls back and
text: gathers the Tai-chi ball, summoning every last bit of his
dialog: energy, his life-force, then--
text: Slams it into Smith, catapulting him into the wall of the
dialog: crater-~
text: Burying him from sight.
text: Neo sways in the rain with barely enough strength to stand as
text: the army of Smiths look down from the crater edge.
text: A low ominous rumble begins to shake the earth. Neo drops his
text: head unable to watch as the rumble rises until--
text: The wall of the crater explodes like an exit wound, earth and
text: asphalt shot-gunning out, es Smith bursts from
dialog: 
text: He hangs in the air, his mud-covered face distorted with
dialog: rage.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: This is my world! My world!
text: He dives into Neo who has nothing left and batters him, each
text: bludgeoning blow striking in time with searing bolts of
dialog: lightning.
text: He seizes Neo by the throat, hoisting him up like a rag doll
text: and fires a super~punch that sends Neo flying--
text: Bouncing down to the earth like a crashing airplane,
text: trenching to a stop.
speaker_heading: 764
scene_heading: GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27, 2002 125.

speaker_heading: SMITH (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait... I’ve seen this... This is it!
dialog: This is the end!
text: He looks at Neo and in a flash of lightning we see the
text: immediate future as Smith stabs his entire fist into Neo’s
dialog: chest.
text: Smith blinks away the raindrops blurring his vision.
speaker_heading: SMITH (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes, you were laying right there, just
dialog: like that... And IT...
text: Another flash and we see the black mirror begin to cover
text: WNeo’s body.
text: Smith walks over to Neo who is desperately clinging to his
text: consciousness as if hanging from the edge of a precipice.
speaker_heading: SMITH (CONT'D)
dialog: I stand here, right here and I'm supposed
dialog: to say something... I say...
text: Again the future flashes in his eyes and he sees Neo’s hands
text: buried beneath the gleaming blackness.
speaker_heading: SMITH (CONT'D)
dialog: Everything that has a beginning, has an
dialog: end.
text: The familiar words suddenly clear Neo’s mind. He looks up as
text: Smith looks down.
speaker_heading: SMITH (CONT'D)
dialog: Den’t be afraid, Neo.
text: Neo almost can‘t believe what he just heard as--
text: Another flash reveals the liquid obsidian covering Neo’s
text: face, but his face is calm, even serene.
speaker_heading: SMITH (CONT'D)
dialog: What? What did I just say?
text: In his confusion, he looks to Neo who now understands.
speaker_heading: SMITH (CONT'D)
dialog: No, no. This isn’t right. This can’t be
dialog: right!
scene_heading: GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27, 2002 126.

speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: You were right, Smith. You were always

text: Rain pours down Smith’s tortured face.
speaker_heading: NEO (CONT'D)
dialog: It was inevitable.
text: Smith’s eyes fire, a scream rises up from him and in a
text: crackling, blinding flash of lightning--
text: He stabs his fist into Neo, who stands with his arms open,
text: accepting the blow.
text: Exactly as in the flashing visions, Neo is covered by the
text: darkness. Rising up over his face, Neo closes his eyes and is
text: lost beneath the liquid shroud.
text: The whole sky continues to weep as Smith enters him,
text: possessing him, as the darkness snaps into a perfect pair of
dialog: sunglasses.
text: The mud covered Smith backs away from the new Smith as if not
dialog: trusting him.

dialog: No!

text: Until there are hundreds of faceless forms all made out of
