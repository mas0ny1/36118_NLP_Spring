text: a gardening hat and trims hedges. He works slowly and
dialog: methodically.
dialog: 17.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
speaker_heading: (TO CHRIS)
dialog: That's the grounds-keeper... I
dialog: think his name is Walter.
dialog: 
text: Rose parks in front of the house, and. He has a pleasant
text: smile. Rose gets out of the car and waves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hi!
dialog: 
text: Walter turns and waves back. Chris gets out and waves too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
speaker_heading: (TO WALTER)
dialog: Hey! What's up?
dialog: 
text: Walter waves silently. Odd.
dialog: 
text: As Chris gets the luggage from the trunk, Rose runs to the
text: front door and RINGS the DOORBELL. FOOTSTEPS. The door swings
dialog: open revealing...
dialog: 
text: DEAN ARMITAGE, 59, a tall, balding, barrel-chested, bear hug
text: of a man. Though clearly smart, Dean has an endearing
dialog: cockiness and a bad case of Dad humor. He is the kind of guy
text: who pronounces garbage, Gar-bahge.
dialog: 
text: And... MISSY ARMITAGE, 56, A beautiful beacon of intellectual
text: patience. She is poised and warm; relaxed and in control. They
text: stand in the shadows of the doorway smiling. Rose hugs her
dialog: parents.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Hi!!!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN MISSY
dialog: There's my girl! Hello sweetheart.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: I miss you guys.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: We miss you, Ro Ro.
dialog: 
text: Chris approaches with the bags.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Hi.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Chris, these are my parents. Mom,
dialog: Dad, this is Chris.
dialog: 18.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Good to finally meet you...
dialog: 
text: Chris holds his hand out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Mr. Armitage will do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Sure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I got him.
speaker_heading: (TO CHRIS)
dialog: Come here.
dialog: 
text: Dean grabs Chris' arm and pulls Chris in tight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Call me Dean. We hug around here,
dialog: Fella.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Alright.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: My wife Missy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I've heard so much about you guys.
dialog: 
text: Missy holds Chris' shoulders and examines his face and chest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Yes, you'll do just fine. So
dialog: handsome.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Can we get inside before you guys
dialog: start embarrassing me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Of course, come inside, make
dialog: yourself at home.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I'm fine with the embarrassing by
dialog: the way; go ahead.
dialog: 
text: Missy and Dean laugh. The four enter the house. Missy shuts
text: the door behind them.
dialog: 
text: Outside, Walter watches as his smile fades away. He slowly
text: turns and goes back to work.
dialog: 19.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ARMITAGE LIVING ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: A wonderful house looms ahead. The interior is worldly and
text: interesting; clean and homey. Several paintings of castles and
text: medieval battles accent the walls. Taxidermy. One wall is all
text: bookshelf, and there is a fireplace.
dialog: 
text: Above the fireplace is a large hauntingly beautiful portrait
text: an old man and woman.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Wow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: "Wow" is good. We'll take wow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I grew up in a one bedroom, so for
dialog: me, this is ridiculous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: It ought to be. Lord knows we've
dialog: done enough work on it through the
dialog: years...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: (To Rose and Chris)
dialog: How was the ride in?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: We hit a deer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN MISSY
dialog: Oh no! Where?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't know. Down around Lyons
dialog: road?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
text: It came out of nowhere.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Are you guys okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS ROSE
dialog: Yeah. Yeah. It just fruck us out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISSY (CONT'D)
dialog: I bet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: You know what I say. One down... a
dialog: few hundred thousand to go.
dialog: 
text: Dean snickers.
dialog: 20.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISSY ROSE
dialog: Dean. So awful! Dad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: What?! Those things are everywhere
dialog: up here, Chris; like rats. The
dialog: damage they've done to the ecology
dialog: alone... Anyway, are we ready for
dialog: the grand tour?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISSY
text: Let them unload their bags first.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Leave `em. Walter will get `em.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I think we'll manage, Dad.

scene_heading: INT. ARMITAGE HOUSE - ROSE'S BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Rose's old room is preserved in the state of a young-minded
text: teenage girl. Lots of pink and dated boy band posters, a

dialog: 
text: Rose and Chris place their bags down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
speaker_heading: (SARCASTIC)
dialog: You think they wish I was still a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I cannot believe they kept it the

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: So...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: They're great.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Yay.
dialog: 21.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: No, they're totally sweet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I told you they'd love you.
dialog: 
text: He sees a picture of Rose in high school on stage in a
dialog: production of `The Crucible.'
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What?! Is this you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: "The Crucible." I was Abigail.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I didn't know you acted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: There's a lot you don't know about
dialog: me.
dialog: 
text: Rose grabs Chris by the belt and pulls him to the bed on top
text: of her. They kiss. She goes for his fly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Wait, what about the tour?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: "The tour?" Are you serious?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: We just got here. I don't wanna be
dialog: disrespectful...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Who gives a fuck? Be
dialog: disrespectful.
dialog: 
text: He stops her.

speaker_heading: CHRIS

scene_heading: INT. ARMITAGE DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY
dialog: 
text: Dean and Chris walk and look at pictures on the wall. Rose and
text: Missy catch up in the living room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Frankenstein's monster. Only
dialog: pieces of the original structure
dialog: remain; I like to think the soul
dialog: is in tact though.
dialog: 22.
dialog: 
text: They keep walking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: There are seven bedrooms, ten
dialog: bathrooms, three indoor dining
dialog: areas, two study's, two main
dialog: kitchens. There's an observatory
dialog: wing on the top floor. And you'd
dialog: be hard pressed to find a room
dialog: that doesn't serve as library.
dialog: 
text: Chris zones in on a photograph taken in the 90's in front of
text: the Armitage house. Dean and Missy are younger, and Rose and
dialog: her brother Jeremy are kids.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: That's Jeremy. Rose's brother.
dialog: He's in Med school.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I've heard stories.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: He went through a couple dark
text: spots but came out the other side.
dialog: You'll meet him later.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Oh, cool.
dialog: 
text: Dean points out the older couple in the picture, the same from
text: the portrait in the living room; GRANDPA and GRANDMA.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Mother and Father lived here till
dialog: the end. They died a few years ago
dialog: now. Passed away within weeks of
dialog: each other...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I hear that happens a lot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: "Love" is a powerful thing.
dialog: 
text: They move down the hallway to a black and white framed picture
text: of a 25 year old man posing in the starting position for a
dialog: race.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: My Dad was a runner. A good
dialog: runner; great sprinter.
dialog: 23.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, In fact, you might find this
dialog: interesting, he was just beat out
dialog: by Jessie Owens in the qualifying
dialog: round for the `36 Olympics in
dialog: Berlin. That's the one where--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: --Owens won in front of Hitler.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: You know your history.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Not really. That one always just
dialog: stood out in my mind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Of course. One of those perfect
text: moments. There's Hitler on his
text: high horse with his perfect Aryan
dialog: race, and here comes this black
dialog: guy to prove him wrong on the
dialog: world's stage. What a moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah, tough break for your father
dialog: though.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: He almost got over it.
dialog: 
text: Dean winks.
dialog: 
scene_heading: HOUSE - MISSY'S OFFICE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Dean opens the door to the office. He and Chris stand outside
text: the door as Dean reaches in to turn on the lights. In front of
text: the desk two comfortable-looking chairs face each other. Books
text: line the walls, and are stacked everywhere. Dean and Chris
text: don't enter. A white cat laying next to a teacup wakes up on
dialog: the desk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Okay Snowbell just looking.
speaker_heading: (TO CHRIS)
dialog: Missy's office. This is where she
dialog: takes appointments.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: She's a Therapist right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Yeah. One of the best in the

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: And you're a surgeon?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: A neurosurgeon; was. I retired

text: the house and twiddle my thumbs.
dialog: 
text: Dean and Chris pass a closed door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, downstairs is the wine cellar,
text: the games room, some storage.
dialog: Apparently a black mold issue down
dialog: there. Almost everything needs to

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ARMITAGE KITCHEN - DAY
dialog: 
text: Dean and Chris continue their walk-through. The kitchen is
text: large, homey and pristine. Large windows overlook the

text: She is still.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: My mother loved her kitchen.
dialog: 
text: Upon hearing them, Georgina comes alive. She resumes cleaning
dialog: the kitchen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: That view.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Oh, Georgina, this is Chris;
text: Rose's boyfriend.
dialog: 
text: Georgina turns to them. She has the same eerie smile as
text: Walter. Like she's masking something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Hi.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGINA
dialog: Hello.-
dialog: 25.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - LATE AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: The yard is huge and the woods beyond it ominous. The wind
text: RUSHES through the trees. Dean leads Chris out through the
text: yard towards a gazebo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Badminton and bocce ball, croquet;
dialog: we're a family who loves games.
dialog: Two other families have properties
dialog: on lake Pontaco, and they're way
text: on the other side. Total privacy.
dialog: 
text: Chris is distracted by Walter who prepares the lawn mower in

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I know what you're thinking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Well-to-do white family; black
dialog: servants...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I wasn't gonna go there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: You didn't have to. We hired them
dialog: a few years ago to help care for
dialog: my parents; they became part of
dialog: the family. Couldn't bear to let
dialog: them go. I hate the way it makes
dialog: us look though...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Hey. People need work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
text: They arrive at an outdoor patio. Dean stops Chris from

dialog: 26.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, crap.
speaker_heading: (CALLING)
dialog: Walter!
dialog: 
text: Walter turns to face them. He has that same eerily mild smile.
text: Vacant in its sincerity.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Another dead bird!
speaker_heading: (TO CHRIS)
text: Damn things fly into the patio
dialog: from time to time; break their
dialog: necks.

speaker_heading: DEAN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: My Dad was never really in the

text: was 11; She was hit by a car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISSY DEAN
dialog: Oh, that's awful; so young. I'm so
dialog: sorry to hear that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah. My aunt raised me, with my
dialog: cousins. We didn't have a lot of
dialog: money or anything, but she's a
dialog: good person; kept me off the
dialog: streets. She gave me my first
dialog: camera.
dialog: 
text: Rose holds Chris' hand.

speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: You two seem like you've been

speaker_heading: CHRIS ROSE
dialog: 4 months? 5 months.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: 5? She's right; I'm wrong.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: `Atta boy Chris. Get used to
dialog: saying that.

speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Not a lot of time, anyway. So...?
dialog: You guys in love or what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Mom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I mean, we've been trying to take
dialog: it slow but...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Yep. You're in love. I can tell.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Can't resist the inevitable.
dialog: 
text: Walter mows past them in the distance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: And how did you meet, again?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
text: At the blood drive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE

speaker_heading: DEAN

speaker_heading: ROSE

speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Uh oh. Get out of here before it's
dialog: too late!
dialog: 28.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
speaker_heading: (TO CHRIS)
dialog: Now, all you have to do is just
dialog: quit smoking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Oh no! A smoker!?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: And we were just beginning to like
dialog: you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: No. I'm quitting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: You should have Missy take care of
dialog: that for you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Oh God.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: How?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Hypnosis. Works like a charm.
dialog: 
text: Missy watches Chris' reaction intently. He is uncomfortable.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Oh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I thought the whole thing was B.S.
dialog: too. I smoked for 20 years. She
dialog: puts me under once, now the sight
dialog: of a cigarette makes me wanna
dialog: vomit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Of course, I'd give you the
dialog: service for free. You are family
dialog: after all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Wow. I don't... Thank you. Um, I
dialog: don't know.
dialog: 
text: Chris looks to Rose for help.

speaker_heading: ROSE

speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: If you change your mind... We're
dialog: just glad you could join us for
dialog: the big get-together.
dialog: 
text: Georgina brings the pitcher of iced tea around and refills

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: The get-together?

speaker_heading: MISSY

speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Drinks, good food, good people...

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Sounds fun.
dialog: 
text: Georgina has been pouring Chris' drink too long and his glass
text: has overflown.

speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Georgina!
dialog: 
text: Georgina snaps out of her daze. She realizes what she's done
text: and starts to clean.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISSY (CONT'D)
dialog: It's fine George, I'll get it.
dialog: Maybe you need a nap.
dialog: 
text: Georgina nods, smiles and walks away. Chris and Rose look at

dialog: 
text: A CAR HORN HONKS in front of the house.

speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Jeremy's home.

scene_heading: INT. ARMITAGE DINING ROOM - LATER/NIGHT

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: One more... So, let me set the
dialog: scene. I'm a junior; Ro's a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: Yeah, Rose.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I hate you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: Connor Garfield was on my lacrosse
dialog: team. Huge guy, like 6'3", and
dialog: crazy, just like "Looney Tunes,"
dialog: right? We had thrown a party--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: You did.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: I think my parents were in Greece
dialog: or something. We had gotten into
dialog: their liquor cabinet and we're all
dialog: shit-faced.
dialog: 31.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: No you weren't. Were you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: We put water in the bottles so you
dialog: wouldn't know. Let me finish.
dialog: Okay, so I'm upstairs in my
text: parents' bathroom hooking up with
dialog: Jenny Richardson. Hottest girl in
dialog: our class.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Uch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: You realize you're coming off like
dialog: a total douche right now, right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: Thanks. All of a sudden Connor
text: starts banging on the bathroom
text: door, right? I open it, and he's
text: got blood gushing out of his mouth
dialog: and he's screaming "Your thith-ter
dialog: bit my fuckin' thongue off!!!!"
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Whoa, what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
text: Sure enough, there is a centimeter
dialog: of tongue meat missing right here.
dialog: 
text: Jeremy demonstrates and Chris winces.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
speaker_heading: (TO ROSE)
dialog: Ahhhh! You bit him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
text: He cornered me and shoved his
dialog: tongue in my mouth, so yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Damn. That's badass, Bae.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: I'm going to see how dessert is
dialog: coming along.
speaker_heading: (TO DEAN)
dialog: Maybe we can change the
dialog: conversation to something a little
dialog: lighter.
dialog: 32.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Yeah, great story. Thanks for
text: making it totally uncomfortable.
dialog: 
text: Missy walks out of the dining room into the kitchen. The door
text: swings open and Chris gets another glimpse of Georgina who
text: stands with a kitchen knife and wears an intense and wicked
text: little smile. The door swings shut.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Okay, new subject. Chris, Yanks or
dialog: Mets?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Ah, Orioles. My mom was from
scene_heading: BALTIMORE SO--

speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Oh God.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: She's right. Let someone else talk
dialog: for a bit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: You've had your chance. He's
dialog: dating my sister. I can't bond
dialog: with the guy?
dialog: 
text: Dean exhales.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You mean like UFC? Yeah, nah. Too
dialog: brutal for me. I'm a lover, not a
dialog: fighter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: You ever get into street fights as
dialog: a kid?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Not really. I did take Judo for
dialog: after-school in 1st grade.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Awww.
dialog: 33.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: Cause, with your frame, your

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Cool... Thanks?
dialog: 
text: The kitchen door swings open again, and Missy walks back in

speaker_heading: MISSY

speaker_heading: ROSE
text: More ramblings from King Awkward.

scene_heading: EXT. THE ESTATE. NIGHT

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Rose and Chris make hushed love in her bed. A stuffed lion
text: seems to watch Chris. He turns it away.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ROSE'S BEDROOM - LATER
dialog: 
text: Rose sleeps, but Chris is wide awake. There's a buzz in his
text: ear. He smacks his own head and sits up. A soft HOWL of WIND
text: rushes through the room. The CLOSET DOOR CREEKS open.
dialog: 
text: Chris' eyes drift to the pack of cigarettes sticking out of
text: his camera bag pocket draped on the desk chair.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ARMITAGE HALLWAY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Chris leaves Rose's room and walks down the dark hallway. A
text: floorboard creaks under his feet. He turns down the stairs.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ARMITAGE DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Chris gets to the bottom of the stairs. He hears the
text: floorboard creek upstairs. He stops and turns, expecting
text: someone to follow him down. Nothing. Chris continues to walk
text: down the hallway past the pictures towards the kitchen.
dialog: 
text: The basement door is open a crack. Chris peers into it
text: curiously. A stairwell leads down into pitch darkness. Chris
text: shuts the door. A figure now stands at the end of the hallway
text: behind him. He doesn't notice. He just keeps going into...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ARMITAGE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Chris walks through the kitchen. He bumps into a bar chair

text: sliding back door of the house.
dialog: 35.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Chris steps out the back door and takes a cigarette out. Chris
text: looks into the vast night around him. The CRICKETS are
text: deafening.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, something DARTS FAST across the yard in the
text: distance. Chris peers out into the darkness. The thing RUNS
text: across the lawn again. A moment of terror comes over Chris. He
text: makes out a shape. It's now running towards him. Chris backs
text: up in fear just as the figure emerges from the shadows and
text: into the moonlight. It's Walter, the grounds keeper. He passes
text: Chris without noticing. Chris gathers his breath.
dialog: 
text: The kitchen light turns on and floods the backyard. Chris
text: drops the cigarette and stomps it out. He turns back towards
text: the house and finds himself face to face with Georgina, who
text: glares through the window dead in Chris' eyes. He's caught.
dialog: 
text: Georgina doesn't react. Chris it still. Georgina suddenly
text: exposes her teeth in a frightening grimace. Chris backs away
dialog: slowly.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ARMITAGE KITCHEN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Georgina sucks her teeth. She doesn't actually see Chris at
text: all. She's looking at her teeth in the reflection in the
text: window which, front lit, reflects her and the room around her.
text: Outside is invisible.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Chris realizes he's not caught. Close call. Inside Georgina
text: notices the bar chair has been moved. She moves it back into

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ARMITAGE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: MISSY

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: MISSY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MISSY

dialog: Please!!!!
dialog: 
text: There is no response. Chris cries. Eventually he slows down

text: up. He can still see the screen above but it is far away, like
text: the mouth of a deep and expansive well.

speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: (TO ROSE)
dialog: So, is it true? The love making.
dialog: Is it better?
dialog: 
text: Rose cackles at the bluntness of the question. Chris almost
text: chokes on his drink. Lisa continues to size Chris up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Wow. Um..
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LISA
speaker_heading: (TO ROSE)
dialog: I'm being too forward?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Oh, will you now?

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - LATER
dialog: 
text: Chris and Rose talk to PARKER DRAY, 60, and APRIL DRAY, 57.
text: They are an overweight, rose-cheeked tipsy wasp couple. Chris
text: and Rose try to mask boredom and annoyance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Who even cares about skin color?
dialog: My God.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Right. I mean--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: The world cares, April. But it's
dialog: not a question of physical
dialog: superiority, it's "What skin color
dialog: is more culturally advantageous?"
dialog: 
text: As Parker drones on Chris looks around the party. Dean
text: schmoozes animatedly with two couples. He quickly scans the
text: party, finds Chris and points him out. The two couples wave
text: and smile giddily. They had all just been talking about him.
text: Chris pretends to not see this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: "Advantageous?"
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, Chris sees another black guy walking through the
text: crowd. Relief. It is Andre, the jogger from the first scene,
dialog: but he's very different than before.
dialog: 50.
dialog: 
text: He seems glazed-over with the same frozen smile as Walter and
text: Georgina, and wears a particularly square ascot and golfing
dialog: hat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Fairer skin is has been in favor'
dialog: the last couple of thousands of
dialog: years, but the pendulum has swung
dialog: back again hasn't it..?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I'm sorry. I'm going to get
dialog: another drink.
dialog: 
text: Chris walks away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: I didn't mean to offend him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Really? `Cause you have yet to say
dialog: anything that's not a blanket
dialog: statement about race.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Now, Rose.--
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Andre stands by the bar and makes himself a Martini. Chris
text: approaches him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: It's good to see another brother
dialog: around here.
dialog: 
text: Andre turns to face Chris neatly. Andre's voice is completely
text: different from the first scene. There is no longer any trace
text: of an urban dialect. He speaks in a lower pitch and slow,
text: enunciating his words precisely.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDRE
dialog: Yes, of course it is.
dialog: 
text: Chris expects Andre to engage more. He doesn't. He just stares
text: at him smiling.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Who do you know?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDRE
dialog: Why, the Armitage's of course.
dialog: We're friends of the family.
dialog: 51.
dialog: 
text: PHIL, 65, a craggy effeminate man with manicured eyebrows,
text: cuts between them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
speaker_heading: (TO ANDRE)
dialog: There you are. Here, put this
dialog: somewhere.
dialog: 
text: Phil hands his napkin to Andre who pockets it obediently. Phil
text: places his hand on Andre's back possessively.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO CHRIS)
dialog: Oh, hello. I'm Phil... and you
dialog: are...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
text: Chris. Rose's boyfriend.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Fantastic. Logan and I know Rose
dialog: very well.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDRE
dialog: I'm sorry, where are my manners.
dialog: Logan, Logan King.
speaker_heading: (TO PHIL)
dialog: Chris was just telling me that he
dialog: felt more comfortable with my
dialog: being here.
dialog: 
text: Chris is let down. Andre isn't what he had hoped.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: That's nice. Logan, I hate to tear
dialog: you away, dear, but the Wincott's
dialog: were asking about you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDRE/LOGAN
dialog: Ah, well it was nice meeting you
dialog: Chris.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Sure.
dialog: 
text: Chris holds out his fist for Andre/Logan to bump. Andre/Logan
text: shakes Chris' fist and then, realizing his error fist bumps
text: him like it's the first time.
dialog: 
text: Andre/Logan and Phil laugh and walk away. They join a small
text: group of people who applaud Andre's arrival. Andre does a
text: little spin showing off his clothes.
dialog: 52.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Chris comes back to Rose. He is more creeped out and agitated.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Where's your drink?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What? Oh, I forgot.
dialog: 
text: Dean projects over the crowd.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Hello!
dialog: 
text: Everyone applauds and gives Dean their attention.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Achem! Once again, I want to thank
dialog: you all for coming. Words cannot
dialog: express how much it means to us
dialog: that after all these years we can
text: all still get together and share.
dialog: I'm reminded of stories of how the
dialog: knights of old would gather in
dialog: honor of a new crusade...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GAZEBO. DAY.
dialog: 
text: During Dean's speech, Chris wanders away from the group.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Ignorant shit...
dialog: 
text: Chris hadn't seen Jim Hudson, the blind man, who sits in the
text: gazebo with his seeing eye dog. He is close to Chris, but far
text: enough away from the group that no one else hears them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Who?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
text: All of them. Ignorant assholes.
dialog: They have no idea what real people
dialog: go through.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I guess people only see what's in
text: front of them.
dialog: 
text: Chris notices his faux pas.
dialog: 53.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Heh. No, you're right. And usually

speaker_heading: CHRIS-

speaker_heading: JIM

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Wait. Jim Hudson... of Hudson

dialog: 
text: Jim smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: The irony of being a blind art
dialog: dealer isn't lost on me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: How do you do it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I have an assistant describe work
dialog: to me. You've got something... The
dialog: images you capture... so brutally
dialog: melancholic. Powerful stuff.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Thank you. Yeah, I just like
dialog: finding the beauty in abandoned
dialog: things.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I used to dabble myself.
dialog: Wilderness mostly. I submitted to
dialog: Nat Geo 14 times before realizing
dialog: I didn't have "the eye" for it;
dialog: Began dealing. And then, of
dialog: course, my vision went to shit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Damn.
dialog: 54.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I know. Life can be a sick joke.
dialog: One day you're working in a dark
dialog: room, and the next day - BAM. You
text: wake up in the dark. Genetic
dialog: disease.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Shit ain't fair, man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Yeah.
dialog:

speaker_heading: JEREMY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah, sure.
speaker_heading: (TO JIM)
dialog: Nice to meet you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Stop by the gallery some time.
dialog: Bout time you had a solo show.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Really? Wow, okay. Thank you. That

speaker_heading: JIM

scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - LATER
dialog: 
text: Chris and Rose play badminton against Jeremy and Derrick. A
text: gaggle of party guests watch, entertained. Chris is actually
text: having fun. He swings big but misses the shuttlecock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: HA! Come on. You can do better
dialog: than that!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Not my game, what can I say.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: Yeah, I see that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Shut up Jeremy.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: I'm just saying, if your boy isn't

dialog: as well bring Mom up here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Whoa, whoa, okay. Now we talkin'
dialog: smack huh?
dialog: 
text: Chris serves the shuttlecock hard. The following rally is
text: long, captivating the crowd. Chris ends it with an impressive
text: diving swat. Derrick misses the return and the crowd goes
text: wild. Chris throws his arms up in celebration.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Boom!

speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Yay, baby!

speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: See, that's what I'm talking

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Hold up. Here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Where are you--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

scene_heading: INT. ARMITAGE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
dialog: 
text: Chris walks through the kitchen.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ARMITAGE LIVING ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Chris slips past several small groups of guests mingling. He
text: goes up the stairs to the second floor.
dialog: 
text: As soon as he are out of sight and earshot, the mingling
text: guests stop in mid-conversation. Everyone in the room waits
text: and listens to CHRIS' FOOTSTEPS above.
dialog: 
text: It is now clear that their conversations have been fake. They
text: are all hanging on Chris' actions.
dialog: 56.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ARMITAGE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY
dialog: 
text: Chris walks to Rose' room.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ROSE'S BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Chris exits the bathroom in Rose's room. The bed is made. He
text: picks his phone up from the dresser. It's unplugged and out of
text: batteries. That's odd. He plugs it in again as he hears a
text: CREAK down the hall.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ARMITAGE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY
dialog: 
text: Chris leaves Rose's room. A door at the end of the hallway is
text: a crack open. Chris slowly walks down the hall, and peers
text: inside. A couple lacrosse trophies and one for ju-jitsu.
text: Jeremy's room. Movement inside. It's Georgina making the bed.
text: The door creaks alerting her of his presence, she turns
text: slowly. Before she sees him he walks quickly back to Rose's
text: room just as she comes upstairs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Hey! You okay?
dialog: 
text: Chris waves for her to join him back in her room.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ROSE'S BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Chris speaks quietly and frantically to Rose.

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)

dialog: and I got no juice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I'm sure it was an honest mistake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah, or maybe not. Maybe she
dialog: doesn't like the fact that I'm
dialog: with you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Chris...
dialog: 57.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What? It's a thing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: You think my family's housekeeper

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Forget it. Nevermind.

speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Look, I get it. This whole thing

speaker_heading: ROD

speaker_heading: ROD

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Oh, no. It's cool. I was just
dialog: confused.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGINA

dialog: see?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah, I--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGINA

dialog: 61.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Really, it's okay. I didn't mean

dialog: ...get you in trouble.

speaker_heading: GEORGINA
dialog: Oh no, no, no, no, no, no...

scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: Chris walks back into the back yard where Dean entertains

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Chris! There you are. I wanted to
dialog: introduce you to some old friends.
dialog: We'll do it quickly. Down the
dialog: line: David and Marcia Wincott,

scene_heading: Each couple - DAVID and MARCIA, RONALD and CELIA, HIROKI,

speaker_heading: HIROKI

dialog: Can we ask him questions?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
speaker_heading: (JAPANESE)
dialog: Of course.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HIROKI
dialog: Do you find that being African
dialog: American has more advantages or
dialog: disadvantages in the modern world?
dialog: 
text: Chris pans the crowd who all give him their undivided
text: attention. The silence is long. Chris sighs. He looks for
text: Rose. She is off talking to someone.
dialog: 62.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah, I don't know, man.
dialog: 
text: They all smile like hungry vampires. Chris is very
text: uncomfortable with this unprovoked group interrogation. Andre/
text: Logan and Phil approach.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: That's actually a great question.
dialog: Logan! They were asking me about
dialog: the African American experience.
dialog: Maybe you could take this one.
dialog: 
text: Andre/Logan is a little caught off guard but dives in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDRE/LOGAN
dialog: My life as an African American has
dialog: been, for the most part, very
dialog: good. It's hard to be too specific
dialog: as I haven't much desired to leave
text: the house in a while.
dialog: 
text: The crowd chuckles. Chris takes out his phone.

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: We've become homebodies...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDRE/LOGAN

dialog: 
text: With the attention on Andre/Logan, Chris subtly backs away
text: from the conversation. He raises his phone toward Andre/Logan
text: and the group and snaps a picture. The FLASH POPS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Shit.
dialog: 
text: Everyone turns to Chris. Andre/Logan steps forward and looks
text: at Chris oddly; His head cocks a little and his peaceful
text: expression drifts slowly to maddened horror. Some of the party
text: guests gasp.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Logan?
dialog: 
text: Andre/Logan drops his glass and stumbles towards Chris. Chris
text: backs up, but Andre is already up in his space.
dialog: 63.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDRE
dialog: Get out.
dialog: 
text: Andre/Logan's voice is higher and scratchy, like it was in the
dialog: first scene.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Hey, man, I'm sorry, I--
dialog: 
text: Andre/Logan grabs Chris by the shoulders and screams shrilly.
text: Blood trickles out of his nose.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDRE
dialog: GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!!!
dialog: 
text: Phil and Jeremy grab Andre. They have to pry Andre/Logan's
text: grip off of Chris. When they do Andre/Logan screams
text: bloodcurdlingly. It takes all their strength to bring him into
text: the house. Missy and Dean follow.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: Rose sits on the couch. She's been crying. Chris comforts her

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: What the Hell was that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: It was a seizure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: A seizure?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Yes. Logan's okay. Missy's with
dialog: him now. Are you okay Chris?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah. Why did he come at me like
dialog: that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Yeah seizures don't make people
dialog: attack people, I'm sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: It was an abnormal manifestation
dialog: but yes, actually, sometimes they
dialog: do. The flash on your phone must
dialog: have triggered it.
dialog: 
text: Andre/Logan enters with stands with Missy and Phil to a
text: smattering of concerned applause.

dialog: 
text: He addresses a group in his lower pitched "Logan" voice.

speaker_heading: ANDRE/LOGAN
dialog: Well, I do believe I owe you all

text: The group grumbles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: We're just glad you're feeling

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDRE/LOGAN
dialog: Well yes I am. It's quite like

dialog: watching my experiences through a
dialog: window. Thank God you and Dean
dialog: were here to calm me down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
text: It's a simple glitch of the brain.

speaker_heading: ANDRE/LOGAN
dialog: I know I scared you all quite a
dialog: bit.. especially you Chris.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: No, I'm sorry about the flash. I

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDRE/LOGAN
dialog: Of course. How could you have?

speaker_heading: PHIL

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: ROSE
speaker_heading: BABY--

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: ROSE

speaker_heading: CHRIS

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
text: She laid there bleeding by the

speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: ROSE

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: This is so fuckin' crazy. He's

scene_heading: INT. ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Chris' phone lays on the dresser plugged in. He's in a hurry
text: now. He packs his small bag and looks out the window. One car
text: remains parked in the designated parking area. It's the first
text: to have arrived for the party: Jim Hudson's. The driver brings
text: the dog to the back seat. He gets a green envelope from the
text: glove compartment and brings it to Missy at the front door.
text: She accepts it silently.
dialog: 
text: The driver drives away without Jim.
dialog: 
text: Chris goes to leave Rose's room. Her closet creaks open. Chris
text: sees a framed picture of Rose inside. Not quite knowing what
text: he's looking for, he goes to the closet. The picture is a
text: frightening one. Rose is one of the witches in a high school
text: production of Macbeth. It's on top of a red shoebox that has
text: the drama/comedy masks drawn on top of it.
dialog: 
text: He takes it off of the shelf. Inside is a pile of pictures. On
text: top is one of Rose dressed as Juliet in a high school play.
dialog: 72.
dialog: 
text: The next one is of Rose at 13 playing Ms. Hannigan in Annie.
text: Chris flips through a few more pictures of Rose at different
dialog: ages in different class plays.
dialog: 
text: Finally Chris comes upon a photo printed from a computer. It's
text: a selfie of her and some other black guy. The picture is
text: almost identical to the one she took with Chris before the
text: ride up. Under the image are written the words. "X-mas 2014"
text: Stunned, Chris flips to the next picture. It's another
text: romantic selfie, this time with a different black guy.
text: Underneath, the caption "Memorial Day 2013"
dialog: 
text: He continues flipping through the stack of pictures of Rose
text: with 8 different black guys. The last one is a picture of Rose
text: with Walter. In it she kisses Walter's cheek intimately.
dialog: "Thanksgiving 2009" Walter looks different in the picture. He
text: isn't smiling vaguely; he's got swagger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
speaker_heading: (EMOTIONLESS)
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: 
text: Rose stands there in the doorway behind him. Chris subtly
text: drops the pictures back in the shoebox.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Um... Looking for my camera.
dialog: 
text: Rose points to her desk. He grabs his bag and the camera.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Where are the keys..? I gotta put
text: our bags in the trunk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Walter can do that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Nah, I'll do it.
dialog: 
text: Rose is truly distant for the first time. A different person.
text: She is methodical and emotionless. The jig is up, and now she
text: is now phoning it in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I was just looking for them. I'm

speaker_heading: JEREMY

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: MISSY

speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: In life? What is your purpose..?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
text: Right now, it's finding the keys.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: We've been looking for our purpose
dialog: for such a long time. Fire has

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I'm looking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Rose, what is this shit?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: There's a reason we worship the
dialog: Sun, Chris. He who lights the way
dialog: through the darkness of life. He
dialog: in all his glory was around long
dialog: before us and will be here long
dialog: after we are gone, but he too will
dialog: die some day! That's right even
dialog: the Sun God will die. It is no
dialog: less mortal than we, but it
dialog: inspires us to defy it! So what do
dialog: we do?--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: --Rose.--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
speaker_heading: (UNHINGED)

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: (Through tears of joyous
speaker_heading: MADNESS)
dialog: I'm saying that we've found OUR

scene_heading: INT. DARKNESS
dialog: 
text: Chris falls through the abyss towards `The Sunken Place' again
text: just like when he was hypnotized. The blue screen above him

speaker_heading: MISSY (O.S.)

speaker_heading: DEAN (O.S.)

speaker_heading: JEREMY (O.S.)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Here it is: My boy Chris has been
text: missing for two days.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE LATOYA
dialog: Your son is missing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: No, sorry, not my son, my boy.
dialog: He's my friend. He's 26. His name
dialog: is Chris... Washington...
dialog: 
text: He gives her time to write the name which she doesn't do. She
text: just stares at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROD (CONT'D)
dialog: He left town on Friday with his
dialog: girlfriend Rose... Armitage...
text: She's white.
dialog: 81.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE LATOYA
dialog: That's four days ago.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Yeah, I mean he's only been
dialog: MISSING for two days. He was
speaker_heading: SUPPOSED--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE LATOYA
dialog: --I'm gonna stop you right there.
dialog: Now you know the minimum amount of
dialog: time without contact before you
dialog: can file a missing persons report
dialog: IS--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: --Three days I know, but I have
dialog: reason to believe he's been
dialog: abducted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE LATOYA
dialog: Go on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Chris was set to come back home on
dialog: Sunday. I was watching his dog
dialog: Sid.
dialog: 
dialog: Latoya points to Sid
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE LATOYA
dialog: That's Sid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Yup. Cute right? Now look...
dialog: 
text: Rod takes out his phone and scrolls to a photo of Andre.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROD (CONT'D)
dialog: Chris sent me this which he took
text: at the girlfriend's parents house.
dialog: That's Andre Hayworth, a guy we
dialog: knew from back in the day. Come to
dialog: find out he went missing 6 months
text: ago in an affluent suburb upstate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE LATOYA
dialog: Don't look too missing to me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Well that's the thing. We found
dialog: him and now, according to Chris,
dialog: he's gay with a different
dialog: personality.
dialog: 82.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE LATOYA
dialog: Gay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: But he didn't used to be.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE LATOYA
dialog: I think he might just argue with
dialog: you on that one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: I know what I'm about to say is
dialog: gonna sound crazy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE LATOYA
dialog: Try me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: You ready for this...? I think
text: this family is abducting black
dialog: people and brainwashing them to
dialog: work for them as sex slaves and
dialog: shit... Sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE LATOYA
dialog: ...Brainwashing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE LATOYA
dialog: Hold on one second.
dialog: (over her intercom)
dialog: Garcia, Frostie, get in here a
dialog: second.
speaker_heading: (TO ROD)
dialog: I want you to tell these officers

scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - MOMENTS LATER
dialog:

speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: ...See, I don't know if the
dialog: hypnosis makes you a slave or if
dialog: just turns you gay or what, but
dialog: they already got two brothers that
dialog: we know of, and who knows how many
dialog: more there could be.
dialog: 
text: The officers are all riveted... Then... All three detectives
text: laugh. Rod is not being taken the slightest bit seriously.
dialog: 83.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LATOYA
dialog: (to her colleagues)
dialog: So, I don't want none of you

scene_heading: INT. CHRIS' LOFT - DUSK
dialog: 
text: Rod sits by the window with Sid. He looks out over rooftops
text: and thinks. He picks up his phone and calls Chris again. He
dialog: knows Chris won't answer. Then--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Hello?
dialog: 
text: Rod is taken off guard. He almost drops his phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Chris?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROD

speaker_heading: ROSE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: He left like two days ago.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: He left?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: We got in a fight. He got all
dialog: paranoid and flipped out; He took
text: a cab home. He forgot his phone.
dialog: Wait... You haven't seen him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: No. He never made it back here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Oh my God.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: I've been calling. I went to the

dialog: 
text: Rose is silent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROD (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: What did you say?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: I told them he was missing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Uh huh...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: So... What cab company did he use?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I don't know. A local one I'm
dialog: guessing. Maybe uber? Wait, I'm so
dialog: confused...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROD
text: Hold on a second.
dialog: 
dialog: Rod knows she had something to do with it.
dialog: 85.
dialog: 
text: He opens up `Garage Band' on Chris' computer and puts the
text: phone on speaker, recording her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROD (CONT'D)
dialog: So, last time Chris and I talked,
dialog: he told me your mom hypnotized
dialog: him?
dialog: 
text: Rose is silent. Then...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Rod, just stop.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I know why you're calling.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Why is that?
dialog: 
text: We now see Rose's family standing in the living room behind
text: her. They watch her operate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Come on. I mean, it's kind of
dialog: obvious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: That there's something between us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: No. I'm calling about Chris.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: We'd all go out drinking... I
dialog: remember you looking at me.
dialog: 
text: Rod is put on the spot. He becomes extremely uncomfortable.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: That's my best friend. If you did
speaker_heading: SOMETHING--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I know you think about fucking me,
dialog: Rod.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: --No. You crazy... No.
dialog: 86.
dialog: 
text: Rod hangs up in a panic. He looks at Sid helplessly.
dialog: 
text: Rose's flirtacious smile goes blank. She places the phone on
text: the dining room table and looks back at her family. They watch
dialog: in approval.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GAMES ROOM
dialog: 
dialog: "You've Got A Friend" plays.
dialog: 
text: Chris, still strapped to the chair, hangs his head in
text: resignation. Eyes shut, he sings along.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: ...Winter, Spring, Summer and
dialog: Fall, all you need to do is call.
dialog: And I'll be there. You got a
dialog: friend. Ain't it good to know
dialog: you've got a friend. Ain't it good
dialog: to know you've got a friend. Oh,
dialog: yeah, yeah, you've got a friend.
dialog: 
text: The song is over. After a moment. Chris begins to sing the
text: opening guitar lick. He gets a couple notes before realizing
text: he's singing alone.
dialog: 
text: The television in front of Chris flickers off and then back on
text: to the image of a tea cup comes into focus on the screen. A
text: spoon comes into the shot and clinks the side of the cup.
dialog: 
text: "TING TING, TING TING"
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: NO-
dialog: 
text: Before he can react, Chris falls asleep.
dialog: 
dialog: Later...
dialog:

text: the room. The image clicks to that of...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY (TELEVISION)
dialog: 
text: Jim Hudson, also shaven, sits on a hospital bed. And faces
text: Chris through the television.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Hello Chris. How's it going...?
dialog: You can answer. There's an
dialog: intercom in the room; I can hear
dialog: you.
dialog: 87.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I need water.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Yeah, sorry about that. If it
dialog: makes you feel any better, I'm
dialog: thirsty too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I need to get outta here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Right. So, the reason I am talking
dialog: to you now is so you can
dialog: understand what is happening to
dialog: you. I guess your `understanding'
dialog: it raises the success rate of this
dialog: whole thing. Not even sure I
dialog: `understand' it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Where's Rose?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Hot isn't she? Hot voice anyway,
dialog: you dirty dog. You're one of the
dialog: lucky one's. The son Jeremy's
dialog: wrangling method sounds way less
dialog: pleasant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Is this some kind of a game to
dialog: you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: They asked me for my favorite
dialog: song, which was hard; I like all
dialog: types of music. Turns out they
dialog: really just needed one I knew all
dialog: the words to: I went with James
dialog: Taylor's "You Got a Friend." I
dialog: hope it hasn't been too torturous;
dialog: that wasn't the point. The point
dialog: is that you learn it, and for us
dialog: to have that knowledge in common.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Who the fuck are you people?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Oh right. Okay, let me back up and
dialog: give you the cliff notes. The
dialog: Armitages and I are a part of a
dialog: society. A pretty extraordinary
dialog: society actually.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 88.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)
dialog: One whose sole purpose for many
dialog: many years has been a search for a
dialog: very powerful object. Armitage
dialog: lineage redefined the nature of
dialog: that search. They proved that the
dialog: power didn't just exist in that
dialog: object; You see, with science the
dialog: Armitage's created a miracle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You hypnotize me? Break my will..?
dialog: Make me a slave like the others?
dialog: This is some crazy racist shit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: No. Not racist, Chris. We don't
dialog: hate you. We want to be you... You
dialog: are not going to be a slave.
dialog: You're going to be a vessel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Wait, what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Missy's hypnosis was merely to
dialog: sedate you. Oh, that and to
dialog: prepare you psychologically...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: For what?
dialog: 
text: Jim smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: For the procedure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What's the procedure?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Are you ready...? Drum roll
dialog: please. Brain transplantation.
dialog: Some say it could never be done;
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)
dialog: They experimented for centuries,
dialog: but it turned out re-linking the
dialog: brain to a foreign central nervous
dialog: system was impossible. The nerve
dialog: connections are far too intricate
dialog: and delicate.
dialog: 89.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What the fuck?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Dean's the only guy who really
dialog: gets the science. He's the one who
dialog: discovered that full brain
dialog: transplantation isn't actually
dialog: necessary to transfer the soul,
dialog: and that partial brain
dialog: transplantation solves the little
dialog: nerve ending problem.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: No.
dialog: 
text: Jim holds up a Color coded diagram of the human Brain. There
text: is a big red part that takes up 80% of the image. The other
text: 20% is blue and located near the lower back of his skull.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Okay so... You see the blue part?
dialog: That's the piece of your brain
dialog: that's all rooted in the nervous
dialog: system. So that stays; keeping
dialog: those tricky little connections
text: intact. The rest is discarded.
dialog: Then they'll remove the red part
dialog: of my brain from my skull and put
dialog: in yours. Your "blue" and my "red"
dialog: basically absorb each other. And
text: apparently the brain heals
dialog: surprisingly fast, so assuming
dialog: everything goes as planned, we
dialog: should be up and functioning in a
dialog: couple weeks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: And my brain?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Your red part? It'll be discarded,
dialog: but don't worry. You wont be gone.
dialog: Well not completely. You'll still
dialog: be in there somewhere; limited
dialog: consciousness of course;
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)
dialog: you'll still be able to see and
dialog: hear but your existence will be as
dialog: a passenger... an audience. You
dialog: will live in...
dialog: 90.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
speaker_heading: (DEFEATED)
dialog: ...The Sunken Place.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Yes. That's what she calls it.
dialog: Good! So you understand, I'll
dialog: control the motor functions, the
dialog: will of our body, effectively
scene_heading: MAKING ME--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Me... You will be me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: As far as the world is concerned.
dialog: It's still a pretty new operation.
dialog: Some kinks. We're supposed to stay
text: away from flashes of light for
dialog: example. They can trigger a
dialog: "momentary lapse in control of
dialog: motor functions..."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Why black people?
dialog: 
text: Jim is disappointed in the question.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Well, because you get the highest
dialog: bids. For the last decade or so
dialog: anyway. I wish it was less simple
dialog: than that, but it's not. You're in
dialog: fashion, baby!
dialog: 
text: Final hope sinks from. Chris shoulders.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Honestly though, personally..? I
dialog: couldn't give two shits about
dialog: race. I don't care if you're
dialog: black, brown, green, purple...
dialog: whatever. What I want is so much
dialog: deeper: Your eye, man. I want
dialog: those things you see through.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: That's crazy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Take it as a compliment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You're not going to get away with
dialog: this.
dialog: 91.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: We have and we will. We'll be
text: together soon, brother.
dialog: 
text: The television turns off. Chris clenches his body trying to
text: pry free from his restraints, before his shoulders collapse
text: with exhaustion. He lifts his head to a rip in the leather arm
text: of the chair revealing its cotton stuffing. He looks at the
text: cotton. We see Chris make a difficult decision.
dialog: 
text: LATER...
dialog: 
text: We hear nothing except a HEART BEAT.
dialog: 
text: Chris' head hangs, asleep. His lips are dry. Chris wakes up.
dialog: 
text: The Television turns on. On the screen, a woman's hand holds a
text: tea cup. With a spoon, she clinks it. We don't hear it though.
text: We still hear nothing but the HEART BEAT.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: No, No--
dialog: 
text: Before Chris can finish SCREAMING, his eyes widen. He goes
text: limp -- unconscious again.
dialog: 
text: Rose enters wearing a white and black nurse's outfit with a
text: red cross on the chest. She rolls a medical table into the
text: room. She draws a dotted line across his forehead and around
text: to the back of his scalp. Then she unstraps his arm and
text: prepares it for an IV. She inserts the needle.
dialog: 
text: She goes to put earbuds connected to an ipod in his ears but
text: sees the arm of his chair has been stripped open. She looks at
text: Chris. Cotton makeshift earplugs have been stuffed in his
dialog: ears!
dialog: 
dialog: He's not really hypnotized!
dialog: 
text: Rose tries to scream but Chris grabs her throat with his free
text: hand and squeezes. The HEARTBEAT quickens. Rose pleads, but we
dialog: don't hear her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
speaker_heading: (INAUDIBLE)
dialog: Wait. Wait. Chris!.... Chri-
dialog: 
text: Chris chokes her. Tears stream down his face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Shhhh.
dialog: 
text: Rose convulses. She scratches his hand and cheeks. He's too
text: strong. She stares at Chris' eyes as her consciousness fades.
text: Then, through the agony, her face curls into a twisted smile.
text: She's having fun. Psycho. Rose goes limp in Chris' hands.
dialog: 92.
dialog: 
text: Chris takes the cotton out of his ears. We can hear again.
text: "You've got a Friend" plays on the earbuds of the ipod.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING ROOM.
dialog: 
text: Earbuds also rest in Jim Hudson's ears playing the same song.
text: He lies unconscious on one of two operating beds in the center
text: of the room connected to an IV and heart monitors.
dialog: 
text: A bright medical light shines on Jim's shaved head which also
text: has a dotted line around it. The other bed is empty and has a
text: light shining on it as well. This bed is for Chris.
dialog: 
text: Dean stands in a black and white robe with a red cross in the
text: middle, his palms upwards in silent prayer near some
text: ceremonial candles. Jeremy watches his father. They are
text: unaware of what's happening in the Medical room down the hall.

scene_heading: INT. DARK HALLWAY
dialog: 
text: Chris finds an old badminton set.
dialog: 
text: Jeremy exits the room briskly and walks down a dark hallway.
text: He turns into the games room and finds Rose's body.
dialog: 
text: Jeremy's eyes go wild. He turns as Chris emerges lunging from
text: the darkness with a badminton racket. Before Jeremy can
text: scream, Chris slams him in the face with the metal side of the
text: racket. He pulls Jeremy inside and shuts the door cutting off
text: the sound from outside. Jeremy wilts in pain.
dialog: 
text: Chris whips him over and over warping the racket to a crumpled
dialog: bloody mess.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING ROOM
dialog: 
text: Dean finishes sawing the top of Jim's skull off. He removes
text: the cranium preciously exposing Jim's brain.

speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Jeremy...?
dialog: 
text: Dean walks to the doorway. Dean scans the dark hallway. It's
dialog: quiet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ro Ro...?
dialog: 
text: Chris emerges charging from the darkness with Deer's head in
text: his arms. He punctures Dean through his neck and shoulder with

text: deer's head attached.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: MISS--
dialog: 
text: His call to Missy devolves into gargles. Dean falls knocking
text: the unused bed over along with some candles. The bed has
text: caught fire. The fire grows fast.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Missy takes a whistling tea pot off the stove and pours
text: herself a cup. Georgina sits nearby knitting. The window, like
text: before reflects the room around them.
dialog: 
text: She sniffs the air. She is suddenly afraid. She turns off the
text: light illuminating the back yard. Walter runs back and forth
text: in the distance. She turns the light back on again. Chris'
text: reflection is now behind hers. He looks savage; covered in
text: blood. Georgina screams and runs out the back door.
dialog: 
text: Chris heads to the door, but sees his phone on the dining room
text: table. He goes for it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Chris runs through the dining room and finds his cell phone on
text: the dining room table.
dialog: 
text: Chris picks up his phone and presses the power button. The
text: loading screen comes up.
dialog: 
text: Chris grunts with frustration as he hears a creak behind him.
text: It's Missy, now in the kitchen doorway behind him holding her
text: teacup and spoon. She begins clinking her tea cup...
dialog: 
dialog: TING...
dialog: 
text: Chris knocks the cup out of her hand spraying hot water on her
text: chest and face. She screams.
dialog: 94.
dialog: 
text: The cat bounds off the dining room table at Chris' face. Chris
text: punches it out of the air. This has given Missy enough time to
text: grab a knife. She lunges at Chris screaming psychotically.
text: Chris can't pin her down. She slices his hands. Chris grabs
text: the tea pot and cracks her in the head with it. She falls. He
text: hits her one more time. Done.
dialog: 
text: The cat slinks out an open window.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Chris runs towards the front door. Before he can open it, he

text: bloodcurdling scream from back in the kitchen:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY (O.C.)
dialog: Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!
dialog: 
text: Jeremy bursts though the dining room and pounces on Chris'
text: back. The two roll around.
dialog: 
text: Chris throws his elbow back at Jeremy who blocks it and uses
text: it to put Chris in a choke hold from behind. Chris slams the
text: back of his head into Jeremy's face. He does it again, and
text: again, and again. Jeremy squeezes tighter.
dialog: 
text: Chris, about to pass out, reaches into Jeremy's pocket and
text: pulls out his keys. He scrapes them deep into Jeremy's eye.
text: Jeremy screams in pain and Chris wriggles out of his grasp
text: tripping him with an improvised Judo throw. Jeremy lunges at
text: Chris again but slips on his own blood banging the back of his
text: head on the coffee table. He's out.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT YARD - NIGHT
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. SPORTS CAR - NIGHT
