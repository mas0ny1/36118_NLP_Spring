text: A blurred image forms on a white screen. A horizontal strip of

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
speaker_heading: (VOICE-OVER)
dialog: Take trust, for instance, or friendship: these are the important
dialog: things in life, the things that matter, that help you on your

scene_heading: EXT. DAWN
dialog: 
text: A series of fast-cut static scenes of empty streets.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
speaker_heading: (VOICE-OVER)
dialog: This could have been any city: they're all the same.
dialog: 
text: A rapid, swerving track along deserted streets and down narrow
text: lanes and passageways. Accompanied by soundtrack and credits.
dialog: 
text: The track ends outside a solid, fashionable Edinburgh tenement.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL. DAY
dialog: 
text: At the door of a flat on the third floor of the tenement. The
text: door is dark, heavy wood and on it is a plastic card embossed
text: with the names of three tenants. They are Alex Law, David
dialog: Stevens, and Juliet Miller.
dialog: 
text: A man climbs the stairs and reaches the door. He is Cameron
text: Clarke, thin and in his late twenties with a blue anorak and
text: lank, greasy hair. He is carrying an awkwardly bulky plastic bag.
text: Cameron gives the doorbell an ineffectual ring and then stands
text: back, shifting nervously from foot to foot until the door is
dialog: answered.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Hello, I've come about the room.
dialog: 
text: Cameron enters and the door closes.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY
dialog: 
text: David, Alex, and Juliet sit in a line on the sofa directly
text: opposite Cameron, who shifts uneasily in his armchair. Alex
text: checks some items on a clipboard before speaking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What's his name?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don't know -- Campbell or something?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Cameron.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Cameron?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (to Juliet)
dialog: Really?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: That's right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (to Cameron)
dialog: What?
dialog: 
text: Cameron is not sure what to say.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Yes, thanks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: And you like it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Oh, yes, it's great.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too,
dialog: don't you think?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff,
dialog: all that crap.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Well, yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: So tell me, Cameron, what on earth -- just tell me, because I
dialog: want to know -- what on earth could make you think that we would
dialog: want to share a flat like this with someone like you?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL. DAY
dialog: 
text: As Cameron plods slowly down the stairs, his shoes striking out
text: against the stone steps, Alex's criticisms continue.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
speaker_heading: (VOICE-OVER)
dialog: 
dialog: I mean, my first impression, and they're rarely wrong, is that
dialog: you have none of the qualities that we would normally seek in a
dialog: prospective flatmate. I'm talking here about things like
dialog: presence, charisma, style and charm, and I don't think we're
dialog: being unreasonable. Take David here, for instance: a chartered
dialog: accountant he may be, but at least he tries hard. The point is, I
dialog: don't think you're even trying.
dialog: 
text: Cameron has reached the bottom of the stairs. He opens the main
dialog: door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: And, Cameron -- I mean this -- good luck!
dialog: 
text: Cameron leaves and the main door closes behind him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: Do you think he was upset?

scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL. DAY
dialog: 
text: Inside the hall of the flat, David approaches the door toopen it.

speaker_heading: ALEX
speaker_heading: (VOICE-OVER)
text: David likes to keep spareshoelaces in sorted pairs in a box
dialog: marked, not just shoelaces', but spare shoelaces'.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I've come to see about the room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL. DAY
dialog: 
text: Outside the door of the flat a young Goth girl, aged about

scene_heading: INT. HALL. DAY

text: Inside the hall of the flat Alex approaches the door to open it.
dialog: Freeze-frame.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
speaker_heading: (VOICE-OVER)
dialog: Alex is a vegetarian. Do you know why? Because he feels it
text: provides an interesting counterpoint to his otherwise callous
text: personality. It doesn't. He thinks he's the man for me. He isn't,
dialog: though there was a time when, well, there was a time when...
dialog: 
text: Alex opens the door to the Goth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOTH
dialog: I've come about the room.

scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL. DAY
dialog: 
text: At the door of the flat a Man aged about thrity-five rings the

scene_heading: INT. HALL. DAY
dialog: 
text: Inside the hall of the flat Juliet approaches the door to open

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
speaker_heading: (VOICE-OVER)
dialog: Like one of those stupid posters -- you know, a gorilla cuddling
dialog: a hedgehog, caption love hurts --- that's what I think when I
dialog: think of Juliet.
dialog: 
text: Juliet opens the door to the Man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I've come about the room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY
dialog: 
text: In the living room each of the candidates is interviewed
dialog: individually with the same seating arrangements as before (i.e.
text: the trio on the sofa and the applicant on the chair). What we see
text: are briskly intercut excerpts from each of these interviews. We
dialog: do not get the responses to the questions, although we may see
text: some facial reaction.
dialog: 
text: All of David's questions are to the Woman.
dialog: 
text: All of Alex's questions are to the Goth.
dialog: 
text: All of Juliet's questions are to the Man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: All right, just a few questions.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Why do you want a room here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Do you smoke?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare
dialog: hands, do you then summon hellfire?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden
dialog: agenda?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either
dialog: divorced or you're not.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd
dialog: like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit
text: singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of
dialog: black to wear?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not
dialog: having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no,
dialog: this is important. Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad
dialog: thing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: With which of the following figures do you most closely identify:
dialog: Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of
text: emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner
dialog: of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Did you ever kill a man?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are
dialog: the sunshine of my life'?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but
dialog: D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I
dialog: were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the
dialog: alphabet of love.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: And what if I told you that I was the antichrist?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SQUASH COURT. EVENING
dialog: 
text: In a sports centre Juliet sits outside a glass-walled squash
text: court. She is ready to play, but at present is watching Alex and
text: David, who are inside the court.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SQUASH COURT. EVENING
dialog: 
text: Inside the squash court, Alex is about to serve.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for
dialog: personal domination.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Serve.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I was trying to educate you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Just serve.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: In the same fashion as chess.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Chess. Chess is often used as well.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Will you shut up and play.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You're a bad loser.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I haven't lost yet.
dialog: 
dialog: Alex serves.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SQUASH COURT. EVENING
dialog: 
text: The squash-court door opens and David walks out past Juliet as
text: Alex stands behind, jabbing his finger at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: Defeat, defeat, defeat-- sporting,personal, financial,
dialog: professional, sexual, everything. Next.
dialog: 
text: Juliet walks in and closes the door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SQUASH COURT. EVENING
dialog: 
text: Inside the squash court Alex is about to serve.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Did you know --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Just serve.
dialog: 
dialog: Alex serves.

scene_heading: INT. JULIET'S CAR (A MINI). NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Alex sits in the back, drinking.
dialog: 
text: Juliet is driving. David sits beside her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I wasn't trying to win.
dialog: 
text: There is no response from Juliet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to
dialog: know: I wasn't trying to win.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive
dialog: competitive urges.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: Discussion group, Alex, discussion.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I thought you stopped going.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people
dialog: should know that.
dialog: 
text: Alex leans close to Juliet. Juliet brakes abruptly and, as Alex
text: flies forward, elbows him in the chest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort
text: of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of
dialog: thing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: For the flat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to
dialog: that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked
dialog: her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We
dialog: had chemistry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: She hated you --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Well, she had problems --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
text: -- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: -- I'd be the first topoint that out. In all kindness I would.
dialog: But, like they say, you know, she's got to want to change, hasn't
dialog: she?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL. DAY
dialog: 
text: Outside the door of the flat Hugo rings the bell and waits.
text: Juliet opens the door. Hugo is in his early thirties, tall, dark
text: and bohemian in appearance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: You must be Hugo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGO
dialog: You must be Juliet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Would you like to come in?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGO
dialog: I'd be delighted.
dialog: 
text: Hugo walks in and Juliet closes the door quite deliberately
text: behind him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VACANT ROOM. DAY
dialog: 
text: Hugo looks around, pleased at what he sees, while Juliet watches
text: him. He sits on the edge of the bed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGO
dialog: It's nice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Would you like to see the rest?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY
dialog: 
text: Hugo is seated on the sofa, Juliet sits opposite on an armchair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: What do you do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGO
dialog: Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing,
dialog: and now I'm trying to write a novel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: What's it about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGO
text: A priest who dies.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I see.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGO
dialog: Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGO
dialog: Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's
dialog: about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't
dialog: die. You see, it's better already.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Writing seems easy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGO
text: It's a breeze.
dialog: 
text: The telephone begins to ring out in the hall. Juliet does not
text: move and at first says nothing. Hugo looks at her and towards the
text: door leading to the hall. After several rings, Juliet speaks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Do you think you could answer that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGO
dialog: The telephone?
text: It continues to ring.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in.
speaker_heading: HUGO
dialog: You're not in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGO
dialog: All right.
dialog: 
text: Hugo stands up. The ringing continues.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALL. DAY
dialog: 
text: Hugo lifts the phone. He turns to face Juliet and looks her in
text: the eye as he lies on her behalf.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGO
dialog: Hello. Yes. Who's calling please? Well, I'm sorry, but she's not
dialog: in right now. I don't know. Would you like to leave a message?
dialog: 
text: Hugo replaces the receiver.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGO
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: It was some guy called Brian.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Did he sound upset?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGO
dialog: A little bit. Is that good or bad?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: It's an improvement.
dialog: 
text: The telephone begins to ring again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGO
dialog: Shall I answer it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights
dialog: this week.
dialog: 
text: The telephone continues to ring.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGO
dialog: Working nights?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I'm a doctor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGO
dialog: And he's a patient of yours?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: No. But he needs treatment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGO
dialog: For what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: A certain weakness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGO
dialog: The human condition.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: You know about it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGO
dialog: I write about it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: And that's not the same thing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGO
dialog: No, but like all novelists, I'm in search of the self.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. MORNING
dialog: 
text: Juliet, dressed and fatigued, sits at the table sipping a coffee.
text: Alex is also seated at the table, but wearing an old dressing-
text: gown and munching at cornflakes while he reads a newspaper and
text: talks at the same time. An array of other papers is spread over
dialog: the table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I
dialog: normally find things.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
dialog: 
text: Juliet gets up and leaves the kitchen. The soundof a bath running
text: is heard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I'm not saying he didn't seem like a nice guy. All I'm saying is,
dialog: it's a bit strange, and this search for the self, and what he's
dialog: on about, you know.
dialog: 
text: Alex hears the mail falling through the door and stands up to
dialog: leave the kitchen and get it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: (calling from outside)

scene_heading: INT. HALL. MORNING
dialog:

text: He stops and lifts it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: Hello. No, she's not in. No. No. No. No ideas.
dialog: 
text: Alex replaces the reciever and walks on to the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: (from the bathroom)
dialog: Who was it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men?
dialog: Maybe it was just the emotion.
dialog: 
text: Alex picks up the mail and looks through it. As he does so,David
text: emerges from his room, dressed for work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: What do you think?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: About what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: About this guy, this Hugo person.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don't have time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I'm only asking what you think.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's
dialog: not a freak.
dialog: 
text: David opens the door. Alex hands him an envelope.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: This is for you. It's your mother's handwriting, so I didn't open
dialog: it. I don't like reading about your father's constipation.
dialog: 
text: David snatches the letter and leaves, closing the door.
dialog: 
text: Alex walks back across the hall, opening one of the letters and
text: reading it quickly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: (calling from the bathroom)
dialog: So we'll meet him, then?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this
dialog: guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and
dialog: descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft
dialog: touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused
dialog: and inflamed --'
dialog: 
text: Juliet's hand and arm appear around the bathroom door. She
text: attempts to grab the letter. Alex plays at holding the letter
text: just beyond her reach.

speaker_heading: ALEX
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
text: Aroused and inflamed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Alex.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: He even signs them, in his own name, can you believe it? I'd sign
dialog: someone else's name. I'd sign his name. If I wrote them, that is.
dialog: Which I don't.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. EVENING
dialog: 
text: Alex, David, Juliet and Hugo sit round a table towards the end of
text: a meal. Alcohol has been consumed. Bowls containing the last of

text: dispenses wine mainly into his own glass, alternating with
text: Macallan malt whisky, of which he pours generous amounts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Interesting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGO
dialog: I see.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yeah, well, that's what she said. Interesting. That's why you're
dialog: here, you see.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Normally I don't meet people, unless I know them already.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGO
dialog: I see.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: People can be so cruel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: So, uh...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGO
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGO
dialog: You were going to say something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What was I trying to say? Oh, yes, I think, we think, or at least
dialog: I suppose we think -- am I right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Just get on with it, Alex.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: We think it's fine.
dialog:

speaker_heading: ALEX
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: It's OK. There's no problem.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGO
dialog: You mean I can have the room?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Well, that's what I said, isn't it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He made it clear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Why, thank you, David.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Yes, you can have the room.
dialog: 
text: Alex pours yet more alcohol.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I'm not usually drunk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Not usually this drunk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Only on expenses.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...
dialog: 
text: With exaggerated scorn, Alex knocks over a glass of wine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
text: In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: It was you, Juliet, it was you --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: -- instead of what he is --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What I am.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: -- which is --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: JULIET

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I think you're lying.

speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: You're right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You see, they don't really know me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: No, Alex, we don't really love you.

text: Alex smiles at Juliet and drinks again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Can you afford this place?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGO
dialog: Yeah.
dialog:

speaker_heading: HUGO
dialog: Certainly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Have you ever killed a man?
speaker_heading: HUGO
dialog: No.

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, that's fair enough, then.

text: one, which he inserts in the door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALL. DAY
dialog: 
text: Inside the flat. The door opens and Hugolifts his cases in,

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JULIET'S ROOM. DAY
dialog: 
text: Juliet sleeps, undisturbed by the closing of the door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALL. DAY

scene_heading: INT. HUGO'S ROOM. DAY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Have you seen Hugo?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: No. Any idea which channel he's on?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALL. MORNING
dialog: 
text: The telephone is ringing. Alex lifts up the reciever. Again he is

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: No, she's not in.
text: Without waiting for any more, he replaces the reciever and walks

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Alex, I don't have the time --

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No.
dialog: 
text: David leaves, slamming the door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. MORNING
dialog: 
text: Alex returns to the kitchen, pausing only to knock at Hugo's
text: door, which elicits no response. In the kitchen Juliet sits
text: dressed for work, having just returned. He casually opens an
text: envelope and glances at both sides of the letter before handing
dialog: it to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: David hasn't seen him either.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: So I gathered.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Maybe he didn't like us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: David?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Hugo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
text: His car's still there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: He's got a car?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: So what's wrong with that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What sort of car?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALL. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: We see the door to Hugo's room, then Alex rapping sharply against
text: it. David and Juliet stand behind him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us,
dialog: Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's
text: not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
text: Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: So?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Open it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You want me to kick it open?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: All right. No problem.
dialog: 
text: After several ineffective kicks at the door, Alex turns to David.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: You want a go?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HUGO'S ROOM. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Inside Hugo's room we see the door as David, outside, throws
text: himself against it. At the third attempt the lock gives way and
text: the door bursts open.
dialog: 
text: In the foreground at one side is the bed with a naked foot lying
text: still and exposed.
dialog: 
text: When the door is open, David is first in, followed by the other
text: two. There is a period of silent shock as they contemplate Hugo's
text: naked corpse. Alex opens a window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Is this what they always look like?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
text: Juliet drapes a sheet over the body, covering it completely.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I wonder how he did it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Did what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what
dialog: happened. What do you think?
dialog: 
text: Quite casually, Alex begins to open drawers and cupboards,
text: emptying the contents on to the floor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Alex.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What? What's wrong?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I'm just looking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Don't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Don't look?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you
dialog: wonder what he died from?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be
dialog: rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
dialog: 
text: In a drawer in a bedside cabinet, Alex finds needles, syringes
text: and a small bag of powder. Without comment, he holds it up and
text: throws it on the bed.
dialog: 
text: He reaches under the bed and pulls out a case, which he opens. It
text: is empty and he pushes it back under.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I've never seen a dead body before.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
dialog: 
text: Alex continues to search. Juliet walks out.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALL. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Juliet stands alone.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HUGO'S ROOM. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Alex continues his brisk search through Hugo's posesseions while
text: David looks on, appalled but speechless.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALL. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Juliet listens to the sounds from the bedroom, then picks up the
text: telephone. She dials 999 and waits for a reply. It rings and
text: rings.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HUGO'S ROOM. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Alex has found and opened a large Gladstone bag. Neither David
dialog: norwe can see into it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts.
dialog: I mean, she was alive at the time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Can I show you something?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALL. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Juliet awaits an answer.
dialog: 
text: Alex approaches Juliet with the open bag. She turns around and
text: looks into it, then, seeing the contents, she replaces the
text: receiver. As she does so, the Operator's voice is audible for a
dialog: second.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OPERATOR
dialog: Hello, emergency services.
dialog: 
text: The telephone hits the cradle.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT

speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: No, Alex. It's, it's --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Unfeasible.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Is that all?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You mean immoral.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I'm only asking you both to think about it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me
dialog: that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You think so?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
speaker_heading: (AMUSED)
dialog: All right, then, go ahead, telephone. Telephone the police. Try

dialog: colleagues.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Now, was there a pet in the house? Yes, a pet, like a dog or a
dialog: budgie or a gerbil. You see, what I need is PC Plod rescues Harry

speaker_heading: LUMSDEN
dialog: Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Exactly what I was --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUMSDEN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Not any real sneering as such, no.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUMSDEN
dialog: There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Eh --

speaker_heading: LUMSDEN
dialog: But they sneer, don't they?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm not sure --

speaker_heading: LUMSDEN
text: Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes,

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. EVENING
dialog:

dialog: doorway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He's still here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: He couldn't get his car started.

speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: DAVID

scene_heading: INT. HUGO'S ROOM. DAY
dialog: 
text: The corpse as before.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ACCOUNTANT'S OFFICE. DAY
dialog: 
text: David sits at his desk, looking across the office.
dialog: 
text: Crouched over a large array of other desks, young men and women
text: in suits are pouring over folders and columned books. No one is
text: speaking except in muted tones on the telephones.
dialog: 
text: David watches them. He looks to his left and to his right: on
text: either side young men like him are toiling over accounts. He
text: turns and looks behind him, where another array of accountants
dialog: sit.
dialog: 
text: He turns back to his desk and opens the file he was previously
text: given. He looks at the columns of records of profit, with a large
text: total at the bottom.
dialog: 
text: When David looks up he sees Juliet seated beside his desk. She
text: smiles and directs his gaze, with her own, to the surrounding
dialog: scene.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HUGO'S ROOM. EVENING
dialog: 
text: The body in silhouette.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
speaker_heading: (VOICE-OVER)
dialog: OK. Let's do it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DIY STORE. DAY
dialog: 
text: Inside a large, brightly lit DIY store with Muzak playing in the
text: background. We start with a tracking shot along an aisle stacked
text: with potentially vicious tools.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
speaker_heading: (VOICE-OVER)
dialog: All right, now listen. We have to dispose of the body in such a
text: way as to make it unidentifiable, so that even if it is found,
text: then it's never anything more than an unknown corpse. Burning,
text: dumping at sea, and straightforward burial are all flawed either
dialog: by fingerprints, or, more commonly, by dental records. This I
dialog: have learned. Now, what I suggest is that we bury him out in the
text: forest, but first of all we remove his hands and his feet, which
text: we incinerate. And his teeth, which we just remove. It's as
dialog: simple as that.
dialog: 
text: As the tracking shot ends, we see David's head and shoulders as
text: he looks at something off picture. Suddenly a spring-loaded
text: screwdriver appears and is fired' so that the tip stops a few
text: millimeters from his face. David winces as we see that Alex is
text: holding it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: I always wondered what these were for.
dialog: 
text: Alex places the screwdriver down on the shelf and walks across
text: the aisle to pick up a saw and a hammer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: Now this is what we need. And this.
dialog: 
text: Alex hands the tools to David, who looks at them with disgust.
text: Alex walks on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: Now what else?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we
dialog: need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So who's going to do it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Dig the pit, I don't know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, not that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Then what? Who's going to do what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You know what I'm talking about.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You know what. Who's going to do it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me
dialog: and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I can't do it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I don't hear this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I won't be able to.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you
text: don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat
dialog: smells. We can't wait any longer.

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: ALEX

text: It pulls off the track onto a patch of grass. The engine is
text: switched off but the light remains on. The trio descend from the
dialog: van.
dialog: 
text: In fron of the van, Alex, illuminated by its lights, Alex, David
text: and Juliet stand together. Alex is showing them two long stems of
text: grass and one short one. He encloses them in his fist and holds
dialog: them out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: All right, then, here we are and this is it. Do you want to play
dialog: or not?
dialog: 
text: Alex holds his hand out towards Juliet, who takes the tip of one
text: of the stems. It is one of the larger ones.
dialog: 
text: Alex and Juliet turn to David. Alex holds out the stems. David
text: reaches out and takes one of the tips. It is the short straw.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I can't do it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Deeper in the forest, with the headlamps still casting a little
text: light throught the trees, we see David's head and shoulders. His
text: right arm is moving briskly back and forth accompanied by a
text: vicious sawing noise. The sawing stops as he evidently finished
text: with one extremity. He shuffles back and starts sawing at
dialog: another.
dialog: 
text: Alex leans against the spade in a shallow pit that he has dug. He
text: observes David impassively. The sawing stops again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: Finished.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: But not quite.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Is that going to be deep enough?
dialog: 
text: Alex bends down to pick up the hammer, which he holds out towards
dialog: David.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Don't you worry about that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Is this necessary?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
dialog: 
text: Most reluctantly, David takes the hammer and looks at Alex, who
text: gestures as if to say, "On you go.' With revulsion on his face,
text: he raises the hammer above his head.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S ROOM. DAY
dialog: 
text: David's face is visible against the plain white backdrop of his
dialog: pillow.
dialog: 
text: He lies fully clothed on his bed, looking up at the ceiling.
text: There is a knock at the door, then Juliet walks in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Are you all right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (without looking at Juliet)
dialog: Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Would you like to talk about it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY
dialog: 
text: Alex sits with his feet up watching a noisy game show, while
text: eating a snack and drinking from a can of beer. Newspapers lie
text: scattered at his feet.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LOFT. DAY
dialog: 
text: The loft above the flat in darkness, but the trapdoor is opened,
text: letting in a pool of light.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALL. DAY
dialog: 
text: David is pulling himself through the trapdoor up into the loft.
text: Beneath him is a stepladder. Juliet stands half-way up the
text: ladder, while Alex stands on the floor beside it. As David enters
text: the loft, Alex hands up the bag of money to Juliet, who passes it
dialog: on up to David.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Be careful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall
dialog: through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Stop nagging.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it
dialog: under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it
text: in the fridge.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LOFT. DAY
dialog: 
text: David moves on into the dark cavernous loft, edging his way
text: across beams and pipes. There are no skylights.
dialog: 
text: He stops and leans against some structure (the water tank). He
text: strains to see in the darkness.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly there is a loud sucking and flowing noise as water
text: empties from the water tank. David is startled and steps forward,
text: tripping. He reaches out as he falls, striking a light switch.
text: Briefly the loft is illuminated: David blinking as he lies across
text: some beams, the large cavernous area, the pipes, the water tank,
text: the bag of money lying between two rafters, and then the old
text: brass switches beginning to spark and the light goes out.
dialog: 
text: David scrambles towards the trapdoor.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HUGO'S ROOM. DAY
dialog: 
text: Now clean and empty, with no trace of recent habitation.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL. DAY
dialog: 
text: In a basement corridor in the hospital, pipes run along the
text: ceiling. Above a fenced-off area is a sign saying For
text: Incineration Only -- No Aerosols'. On the floor of this area are
text: yellow plastic sacks. Juliet appears around a corner carrying one
text: of these. Quite casually the clumps it on the pile and continues
dialog: past.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. QUARRY. EVENING
dialog: 
text: Alex pushes a blue car into a quary.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SUBURBAN LOCK-UP GARAGE. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: In the garage there is a car, gardening equipment, several sacks
text: of fertilizer and a trunk-style deep freeze, on the lid of which
text: sit Andy and Tim. Tim takes out a cigarette and offers one to
text: Andy, who declines.
dialog: 
text: They slide off the deep freeze and open it.
dialog: 
text: Inside the freezer there is a man, naked and bound with cord.
text: They lift him up. He is very cold and weak.
dialog: 
text: The Man begins to whisper inaudibly. Andy moves his head so that
text: he can hear the whisper. He listens, then nods approvingly.
dialog: 
text: They push him down again and close the lid. Andy holds the lid
text: while Tim dumps the sacks of fertilizer on top.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CHARITY BALL. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Alex, David and Juliet are attending a charity ball. Everyone is
text: dressed very smartly, in ball gowns and black ties with the
text: addition of a significant number of kilts.
dialog: 
text: Neither Alex nor David wears a kilt. The trio seem to know a
text: number of people there but do not seem especially keen to speak
dialog: to them.
dialog: 
text: A middle-aged, podgy, mustachioed Master of Ceremonies is
text: standing on a platform in front of the band, making a speech to
text: the diners who are still sat at their tables.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MC
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please. First of
dialog: all, may I thank you all for coming along tonight and supporting
dialog: our appeal to raise funds for the sick children's unit.
dialog: 
text: There is a quick drum roll and applause breaks out. We move to
text: the table where Alex, David and Juliet are seated. Alex leans
text: across to Juliet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You didn't tell me that this was for children. I hate children.
dialog: I'd raise money to have the little fuckers put down.
dialog: 
text: Some other guests around the table cast critical glances at Alex.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Sshh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I want my money back. Excuse me.
dialog: 
text: Alex signals to the waiter by lifting his hand and snapping his
text: fingers, then indicates another bottle of champagne that already
text: ists in front of him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MC
text: For all too often there's a complacency: out of sight, out of
dialog: mind, let someone else bother about these things.
dialog: 
text: Alex cheers once and starts to applaud on his own. Juliet nudges
text: him viciously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MC
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: But just before the dancing, I'd like to say a special thank-you
dialog: to a few of the people who've worked so very hard to make this
dialog: occassion happen.
dialog: 
text: The MC's drone continues in the background while conversation
text: continues back at the table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Do you know many of these people?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Yes. They're my friends.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I see, so if they want to talk to you, we say you're not in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MC
dialog: And now, ladies and gentlemen, and those of you who are neither
dialog: or both --
dialog: 
dialog: Drum roll.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MC
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: -- would you make your way to the floor for Strip the Willow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Are we going to dance?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Well, it's physical contact, isn't it?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DANCE FLOOR. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The dance floor a few minutes later. It is packed and rather
text: chaotic. Sweaty, dishevelled dancers sling one another around,
text: with the thud of flesh against flesh. Toes are stood on and
text: jackets discarded.
dialog: 
text: Juliet dances with Alex, who plunges in with the maximum of
text: violence, eventually tripping up and tumbling forcefully among
text: the other dancers.
dialog: 
text: He starts to get up, then rests his head back against the floor.
dialog: 
text: David has not been dancing. Instead he remains at their table and
text: at the bar, drinking steadily and watching the other two.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TABLE. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Back at the table, while most people are still on the dnace
text: floor, the trio sit drinking and Alex smokes a cigar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: That was good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Can we talk about something?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Not now. I have an idea.
dialog: 
text: Alex pours champagne on to a stack of glasses.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to
dialog: do --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Just stop worrying.
dialog: 
text: Alex stands and raises his glass.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: Love and happiness for ever.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: For ever and ever.
dialog: 
text: Alex drinks, then puts his glass down. Juliet drinks but does not
text: drain her glass. David sits still.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What's the problem?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I want to talk now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: After you drink to love and happiness forever.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: After.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: David, I promise we will. Keep him happy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.
dialog: 
text: David reaches out to take his glass. Suddenly, Alex flings an arm
text: out to point, knocking over David's glass and completely losing
dialog: interest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: Look over there. It's Cameron.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Who?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Cameron. You remember Cameron.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: No, I don't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What's he doing here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: That's not him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yes, it is. It's him. Cameron, Cameron, come on over.Yo!
dialog: 
text: From some distance away, Cameron becomes aware of Alex and
text: cautiously makes his way across until he stands a few feet from
dialog: the table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Nothing. We thought you were someone else.
dialog: 
text: Alex falls forward, laughing, and the other two also laugh as
text: Cameron walks away, humiliated again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us
dialog: around?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
speaker_heading: (UNSEEN)
dialog: The divine Juliet. Long time no see.
dialog: 
text: Brian approaches and is standing behind their table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Brian.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Would you care to dance?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hold on there. Who do you think you are?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Who do you think you are? You interrupted us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I'm Brian McKinley, and who are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, Brian McKinley, if you want to talk to my girlfriend, you
dialog: talk to me first. If you want to dance with her, then you apply
dialog: in writing three weeks in advance or you're gonna end up insode a
dialog: fucking bin-bag. You didn't apply, so you don't dance.
dialog: 
text: Shocked and frightened, Brian backs away, then turns around to
text: complete his departure. Juliet restrains David with a touch as
text: they watch him go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That was stressful. I found that stressful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking bin-bag',
dialog: I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the
dialog: full there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You think so?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Well, you certainly had a good look around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You were magnificent.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TOILETS. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The gents' toilet. Brightly-lit and white-tiled. Alex walk in and
text: goes into a cubicle and closes the door. We hear him whistling
text: and laughing as he passes urine. He keeps muttering bin-bag' to
text: himself. Then he flushes the toilet and opens the door. As he
text: does so a look of surprise appears on his face as he sees someone
text: waiting for him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Cameron! What a surprise.
dialog: 
text: As Alex is speaking Cameron's fist flies forward, hitting him in
text: the face and sending him flying backwards. Cameron enters the
text: cubicle and closes the door behind him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALL. MORNING
dialog: 
text: Mail falls through the letter box.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. MORNING.
dialog: 
text: Alex does not stir.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALL. MORNING
dialog: 
text: David emerges from his room, ready for his work. He looks towards
text: the kitchen, then walks to the door and opens it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. MORNING
dialog: 
text: We hear the main door closing as David leaves. Alex jolts with
text: energy with every sound. The telephone begins to ring. Juliet
text: looks at Alex expectantly, but he does not move. Eventually she
text: gets up and answers it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Hello. Hello.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Who was it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Don't know. No one said anything.
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the
dialog: days when I had such a thing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Are you all right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Then let's spend some money.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FLAT. DAY
dialog: 
text: There follows a video depicting the results of Alex's and
text: Juliet's spending spree. It opens with Alex seated at the kitchen
text: table talking to the camera, absolutely deadpan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Hello. It's been a struggle, but now the days of worry are over,
text: the light at the end of the tunnel has expanded into a golden
text: sunrise and at last, at long last, nothing will ever be the same
dialog: again.
dialog: 
text: Alex leans out and the camera foloows him as he presses the play
text: button on a tape recorder. The music begins.
dialog: 
text: Fast cuts follow, occasionally interrupted by out-of-focus shots
text: of the floor or ceiling as the camera swivels round and is
text: switched on and off.
dialog: 
text: Alex wearing several different suits, outfits and silk pyjamas.
dialog: 
text: Juliet wearing several different outfits.
dialog: 
text: Both of them posing with small objets d'art.
dialog: 
text: The expensive watch on Alex's wrist.
dialog: 
text: Juliet's jewellery.
dialog: 
dialog: Expensive toys.
dialog: 
text: Juliet takes a picture of Alex with a Polaroid camera.
dialog: 
text: Alex holds the camcorder out at arm's length in order to film
text: himself and turns to the camera and adjusts his tie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
text: This is Alex Law reporting from the scene of his own life, and
dialog: you know, I'm so happy I could die.
dialog: 
text: Darkness. TV. Turned off.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY
dialog: 
text: The music has stopped.
dialog: 
text: David presses the eject button and lifts the video from the
dialog: player.
dialog: 
text: Alex and Juliet are seated on the sofa, surrounded by their
text: acquisitions, and are evidently a little embarrassed. Juliet is
text: holding the Polaroid of Alex.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I think we ought to scrub this, don't you?
dialog: 
text: David reinserts the tape and presses record.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Will you calm down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
dialog: 
text: David picks up the Polaroid of Alex and throws it down, then
text: picks up a vase.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How much did you pay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How much did you pay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How much?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I don't know.

speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Two hundred.

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Two hundred pounds?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
text: Two hundred pounds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You paid two hundred pounds for this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: That's what it cost, David.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is
dialog: what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you
dialog: two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet.
dialog: 
text: From out in the hall, the phone starts to ring. Nobody moves.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S ROOM. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: David lies awake in his bed.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. A FLAT HALLWAY. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Hearing the noise, David sits up in bed, then gets out, reaching
dialog: for his clothes.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: David looks down the stairwell. Other neighbours, in nightclothes
text: or hurriedly dressed, are standing at the open door of the flat
text: below. David descends the the stairs and looks into the hall of
text: the other flat where the occupant, an Elderly Woman, lies
text: groaning on the floor.
dialog: 
text: A hand on David's shoulder pushes him out of the way and two
text: uniformed policemen walk past, followed by an ambulance man
text: carrying a stretcher.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Did they take anything? Did they take anything?
dialog: 
text: No one acknowledges his question or answers it.
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL. NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S ROOM. NIGHT

text: David lies awake in his bed.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DOOR OF THE FLAT. DAY
dialog: 
text: Someone attempts to open the door but cannot because there are
text: two new security chains on the inside. The door is forced against
text: the chains with no success and Alex calls from the other side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What is this? What is going on? David!
dialog: 
text: David approaches the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'll let you in.
dialog: 
text: David closes the door and looks through a new spyhole to see Alex
text: grinning at him while he releases the chains and then opens the
text: door again. Alex walks in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What is this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Security.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: There was a break-in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: Downstairs, I know. Pensioner's terror ordeal: page six.
dialog: 
text: Alex hands David a rolled-up newspaper.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Doesn't it worry you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've
dialog: worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's
dialog: terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a
dialog: pensioner it'll worry me.
dialog: 
text: Alex notices some more tools and the stepladder leading up to the
text: trapdoor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: What's all this for, more security?

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: JULIET

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: No, no, it's different.

speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: It tastes different.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I don't want it to taste different. I don't know why I bother. Is
dialog: that enough for you? Hey!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What? Yes, that's fine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You're sure? There's lots more.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What's wrong?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You're not eating.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Not eating what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Not eating like you used to, that's what.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: If you give me the plate, I'll eat.
dialog: 
text: Alex hands him the plate and he starts to eat. Alex watches him
text: chew a mouthful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Now swallow.
dialog: 
text: David does so.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: You know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying
dialog: about it. That's my advice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: He's right. You'd feel much better about it.
dialog: 
text: David has stopped eating.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Be like a weight off your shoulders.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You know we're right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Don't you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I want to secure it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank?
dialog: You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take
dialog: it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I don't see the point in that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the
dialog: money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's
dialog: underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you
dialog: can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's
dialog: nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this
dialog: for nothing, so that I could have nothing --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah, and you didn't saw his feet off.
dialog: 
text: There is silence. David resumes eating.

speaker_heading: DAVID

text: In the darkness we can just make out David's eyes as he sits in
dialog: darkness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (calling from below)
dialog: David, David, what are you doing up there?
dialog: 
text: The torch goes on. David lifts the bag of money from between the

text: Alex's voice can be heard throughout.

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Leave him alone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: He can't stay up there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: He'll come down. Leave him alone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come
dialog: down for that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL. DAY
dialog: 
text: Juliet looks through the door from a small office out into the

dialog:

scene_heading: INT. LUMSDEN'S OFFICE. DAY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's my mother, sir, she's very ill and I think I need to be with

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM. DAY
dialog: 
text: David shaves carefully with a safety razor.

speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Painful groin? What does that mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SISTER
dialog: I don't know. He wouldn't show me.
dialog: 
text: Juliet draws back the curtain of a cubicle. Alex is sitting on a
dialog: trolly.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Boy, am I glad to see you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: What are you doing here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: We have to talk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Your painful groin?
dialog: 
text: She turns and walks away. Alex chases after her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Later. But first -- him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: David?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Oh, good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: He won't do anything for me, but for you --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Forget it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use
dialog: your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: And the money?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: We could put it somewhere.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Where he can't get it?

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Now you thought of that, not me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET

text: Juliet walks away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALL. DAY
dialog: 
text: The hall is empty and the flat is silent. We see the trapdoor.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LOFT. EVENING
dialog: 
text: David sits in the darkness. A crack of light penetrates beside
text: the trapdoor.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Alex and Juliet sit at the table, eating in silence.
dialog: 
text: The doorbell rings. Alex and Juliet look at one another.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Expecting anyone?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Oh.
dialog: 
text: Alex resumes eating.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
dialog: 
text: Juliet glares at him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALL. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Alex approaches the door and is about to open it. At the last
text: moment he checks himself and looks through the spyhole.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THROUGH THE SPYHOLE. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Tim and Andy stand outside the door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALL. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Alex, slightly puzzled, fixes the security chains before opening
text: the door. As soon as he opens it, the door is kicked wide open as
text: the security chains break off. Tim and Andy enter the flat.
dialog: 
text: In a whirlwind of force they drag and shove Alex and Juliet into
text: the living room and bind them up with cord. There are no words
text: apart from slightly muffled cries.
dialog: 
text: At the end of this Andy stands in front of Alex holding a
text: crowbar. Swiftly and without warning, he cracks it across Alex's
text: shins. Then Andy slowly puts one one end of the crowbar into
text: Alex's mouth. For a moment he does nothing, then just as slowly
text: again, he takes the crowbar out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: It's in the loft.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALL. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The trapdoor is closed but the sound of it being unlocked can
text: just be heard (although not by anyone in the flat.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALL. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Tim pulls the ladder across to the trapdoor.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LOFT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: It is completely dark in the loft, but as the trapdoor opens a
text: shaft of light strikes upwards and illuminates a small pool
text: around the opening.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LOFT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Away from the trapdoor there appears to be a wall of uniform
text: darkness, but then we see a pair of eyes in the darkness. It is
text: David. He stands perfectly still.
dialog: 
text: There is a hammer in his right hand.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LOFT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Tim's head appears through the trapdoor. Cautiously he lifts
text: himself through and balances on the beams.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALL. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The hall is empty, but we can see the open trapdoor. Suddenly
text: there is a single thud, as might be caused by a body landing
text: heavily on and across some beams in the loft.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LOFT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: David stands motionless in the dark, exactly as before.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Andy has heard the single thud. He strains to hear anything else
text: but does not. Slowly he backs away to the door of the living
text: room, keeping the crowbar trained on Alex as he does so. He looks
text: back and up towards the trapdoor.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LOFT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Once again a small pool of light emanates from the open trapdoor.
text: Andy emerges into the front of this, crowbar in hand, peering
text: into the darkness. Carefully he stands up and moves out of the
text: light and steps across the beams. His foot strikes something and
text: he looks down. Tim's body lies spread-eagled beneath him. He
text: looks up. To one side of him is the brass light switch. Andy
text: lifts his arm, reaches towards it and switches it on. Sparks pour
text: out for a moment and then the light comes on for a fraction of a
text: second, long enough for Andy to see David's face is only
text: centimetres from his own.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALL. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Alex and Juliet are bound together as before. There is a loud
text: thud from the ceiling, following by a few heavy steps. Then
text: Andy's body falls headfirst through the trapdoor, straight down
text: to the floor below, landing awkwardly and coming to rest with his
text: head hanging back, looking towards Alex and Juliet. Andy takes
text: one agonal breath and dies. Blood trickles from the side of his
dialog: mouth.
dialog: 
text: Tim's body lands on Andy.
dialog: 
text: David drops himself from the hatch to the floor.
dialog: 
text: David takes a large knife from a wooden block.
dialog: 
text: Back in the hall he kneels, holding the knife, beside Tim.
text: Noticing something at the top of tim's neck, he uses the knife to
text: lift away Tim's T-shirt. A tattoo covers Tim's neck. David looks
text: at it, then stands up.
dialog: 
text: He walks through to the living room, where Alex and Juliet, still
text: bound, watch him approach. He looks at them for a moment, then
text: extends the knife and cuts the cord in one place.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: In a scene similar to the dismemberment of Hugo, we see David's
text: shoulders as he saws back and forth at something unseen. He stops
text: and reaches out for the hammer, picks it up and raises it above
text: his head.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD. DAWN
dialog: 
text: The van is silhouetted against a rising sun.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BACK OF THE VAN. DAWN
dialog: 
text: The tools and the yellow sack slide about in the back of the van.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VAN. DAWN
dialog: 
text: David is driving. Alex and Juliet are huddled silently away from
text: him. David seems quite at ease.
dialog: 
text: A thick bunch of keys dangles from the ignition. Juliet observes
dialog: them.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LOFT. DAY
dialog: 
text: David sits still in the darkness.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE. DAY
dialog: 
text: Alex sits at his desk fidgeting, about to write something but
text: unable to start. On the screen of his word processor is a page
text: mock-up with the headline CATS EAT PENSIONER'. As the telephone
text: on his desk rings, he is startled, then reaches out, slowly lifts
text: it fractionally and replaces it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TRAVEL AGENT'S. DAY
dialog: 
text: Hunched over a VDU, the Salesman is offering Juliet a range of
dialog: flights.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: October 15th, direct flight, London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro,
dialog: British Airways, you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five
dialog: pounds. Seven six five.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: That sounds fine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: Air Portugal, on the other hand, via Lisbon, same day, five
dialog: hundred and sixty-five. Five six five. It's up to you. Catering
dialog: important?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: Air France. Glasgow. Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong
dialog: end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. That's nine one two. It's
dialog: up to you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot
dialog: . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good
text: value, but refueling at Bogot is variable.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: The first one was fine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: Well, it's up to you. Seven six five. How will you be paying?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALL. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The hall is empty but we can hear David's footsteps on the beams
dialog: above.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Alex sits watching The Wicker Man on televison. He can hear the
text: footsteps above. He turns the sound up on the television so that
text: he cannot hear them, but he keeps looking up at the ceiling, as
text: though he expects to hear them or see somwthing.
dialog: 
text: Eventually he turns the sound back down and, after a moment's
text: silence, the footsteps start again, back and forth, then stop.
dialog: 
text: Alex looks up.
dialog: 
text: Without warning there is the sound of an electric drill.
dialog: 
text: The blade of the drill appears through the ceiling and is then
text: withdrawn. Alex is shocked. Other drill holes appear.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VARIOUS CEILINGS. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Holes are drilled in the ceilings.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LOFT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Rods of light penetrate up from the holes, interrupting but not
text: obliterating the darknes. David sits back, pleased with his work.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JULIET'S ROOM. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Juliet sits at her desk. Alex stands in the doorway. He is about
text: to speak. Juliet raises a finger to her lips. They both look at
text: the ceiling.

scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN AT FRONT OF THE FLAT. NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. HALL. NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. ALEX'S ROOM. NIGHT

text: David is searching through Alex's desk, looking through letters
text: and folders, then shoving them back into drawers.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN AT THE FRONT OF THE FLAT. NIGHT
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it
dialog: further.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: It's the only way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I refuse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: You're frightened.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see
dialog: what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive
dialog: and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead
text: dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He
text: killed them both: he cut them up.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JULIET'S ROOM. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: David is now searching through Juliet's desk. He picks up a large
text: brown envelope and looks into it. Beneath it is the airline
dialog: ticket envelope.
dialog: 
text: The doorbell rings.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THROUGH THE SPYHOLE. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: McCall and Mitchell stand outside the door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALL. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: David opens the door. McCall smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC
dialog: Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCCALL
text: It's about the burglary.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Burglary?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCCALL
text: Downstairs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Of course.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Can we come in?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: David sits on the sofa while the two policemen sit on armchairs
text: several feet apart.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went
dialog: downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just
dialog: stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and
dialog: then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And
dialog: that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful,
dialog: I don't think.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: did you hear anything before he cries?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the
dialog: last few days?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, nothing, sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Of course.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: There are only two other people in the flat.
dialog: 
text: McCall consults a notebook.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Two?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Who said there were four?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of
dialog: course, but now, four.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, three. Who said there were four?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading
dialog: information. Only three people here. You're sure?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes, absolutely.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Take a note of that, Mitchell. Only three, rather than four.
dialog: Write it down. You can use numbers or words, I have no
dialog: preference. Which are you using?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Both, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my
dialog: tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I see.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.
dialog: 
text: Uncomfortably, David realizes that Mitchell has noted down even
text: this last, trivial remark in a painful longhand and has
text: underlined a short segment of it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALL. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: In the hallway of the flat Mitchell stands at the open main door,
text: waiting to leave. McCall is kneeling at the door to Hugo's room,
text: tracing his finger down the broken lintel and lock. David looks
dialog: on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Loks like you had a break-in up here as well.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Someone lost the key.
dialog: 
text: McCall gently pushes the door open and the light from the hall
text: illuminates Hugo's room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Is this where no one stays?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah, that's right, that's it.
dialog: 
text: David notices that Mitchell is writing this down.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GARDEN AT FRONT OF THE FLAT. NIGHT
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You'll wait in the hall?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I'll wait there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police,
dialog: you'll tell them everything?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Everything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the
dialog: first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die
text: misunderstood.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Alex.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
dialog: 
text: She hands Alex a Yale key. Alex stares at it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LOFT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: In the darkness, the sound of the lock being turned is heard.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALL. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Alex tsands at the top of the ladder, holding the key in the
text: trapdoor lock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: All right, David, what I'm going to do is, I'm going to open this
dialog: lock and I'm going to come up, and what's important is that you
dialog: remain calm.
dialog: 
text: There is one light on. Juliet stands at the bottom of the ladder.
text: Having opened the trapdoor, Alex stops and listens, but there is
text: no sound above his own breathing. Juliet throws up a torch, which
text: he catches. He switches it on. It shines, then goes out, and he
text: knocks it against the ladder, making it work again. Slowly he
text: pushes the trapdoor open.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LOFT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The trapdoor opens. Below it, Alex crouches on the ladder,
text: expecting attack at any moment. He looks back down to Juliet, who
text: returns his gaze, then he slowly raises himself into the loft.
dialog: 
text: He turns around quickly, darting the torchlight around into
text: corners and squinting in the darkness, but he sees nothing.
dialog: 
text: The torch goes out. Cursing, he knocks it against a beam and it
text: shines again.
dialog: 
text: Slowly he moves further from the trapdoor into the centre of the
text: loft, still turning around and worried about what might be behind
dialog: him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALL. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Juliet stands waiting, braced for sounds of conflict.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LOFT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Alex is still looking but has relaxed a little, feeling les in
text: danger. In one corner he notices David's pile of left-possessions
text: and the mat on which he has been sleeping. He moves towards it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALL. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Juliet stands, still waiting.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LOFT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Alex stands in David's corner. With another sweep of the torch he
text: can still see nothing. He calls to Juliet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: He isn't up here.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALL. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A close-up of Juliet's face, just as David's hand slams across
text: her mouth, gripping her tightly while his other hand clamps on
text: the back of her head. David's mouth is right up against her ear
text: as he spits a warning into it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Tell him to look for the money.
dialog: 
text: Slowly, David relaxes his grip on Juliet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Look for the money.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LOFT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Alex, cheerful now, is looking in the rafters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Don't worry, that's what I'm doing.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALL. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: David holds Juliet across her face again. She is terrified and
text: does not struggle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Expecting anyone?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: No one. I promise.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Who have you talked to?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: No one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: If I think you're lying --
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LOFT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Alex stands gazing around the loft.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (from the loft)
dialog: Well, it's not up here.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALL. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: David pulls Juliet to one side.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LOFT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Alex is about to descend when he notices the water tank. He walks
text: over and lifts the lid. His face breaks into a smile as he
text: realizes what it holds. He dips an arm into the tank, raises the
text: yellow bag, then quickly lowers it again. Alex steps back from
dialog: the water tank.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALL. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Alex appears at the top of the ladder. Without looking, he slides
text: down as quickly as he can, calling out as he does so.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Juliet, I have --
dialog: 
text: Alex reaches the base of the ladder. He turns around to find
text: himself facing the blade of the battery-operated drill, held by
text: David. Juliet stands off to one side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: -- a problem.
dialog: 
text: David holds the drill even closer until it is almost touching the
text: centre of Alex's forehead and presses the trigger' to turn the
text: blade slowly as he speaks.
dialog: 
text: Alex does not move at all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You looking for me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Looking for you? Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: We just wanted to speak to you.
dialog: 
text: Alex's hands and sleeves are wet. A few drops of water fall from
text: his fingertips. Unnoticed by the other two, he slowly wipes his
text: hands on the back of his jeans.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Who else have you wanted to speak to? Maybe you thought they'd
dialog: already got me.
dialog: 
text: The blade os the drill scrapes Alex's skin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Who?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Your friends.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I don't know what you're talking about.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: He doesn't know David.
dialog: 
text: David holds the drill back slightly while he thinks. It could go
dialog: either way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, maybe you don't --
dialog: 
text: David lowers the drill and smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: I'm talking about the police.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ALEX'S ROOM. DAY
dialog: 
text: Alex has just woken up. He rubs his forehead. There is a nick in
text: it, where the drill has scratched. He rubs at it and examines the

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LOFT. DAY
dialog: 
text: David sits back suddenly, recoiling from the activity. He

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JULIET'S ROOM. DAY
dialog: 
text: The room is empty.
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. DAY
dialog: 
text: David takes orange juice out of the fridge and pours himself a
text: glass. He sits at the table and looks briefly into a corner that
text: we cannot see. The expression oh his face does not change and his
text: voice is impassive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I thought you'd gone to work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
speaker_heading: (UNSEEN)
dialog: With a face like this?
dialog:

speaker_heading: OFFICE BOY
dialog: The editor wants to see you.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. MORNING
dialog: 
text: David sits while Juliet talks. She is now seated behind him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I remember how things used to be here, and I see how they are
dialog: now, and I don't know why it is. I don't know how we let you
dialog: become like this. We were your friends and we should have looked
dialog: after you.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. EDITOR'S OFFICE. DAY
dialog: 
text: Alex sits nervously while the Editor sits on the side of his
dialog: desk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDITOR
text: Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond
dialog: recognition.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I don't know anything about it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDITOR
dialog: Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything
dialog: about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Cover it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDITOR
dialog: Well?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: But there's no --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDITOR
dialog: Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides,
dialog: we're short.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDITOR
dialog: Don't know what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Well, I've got this story, it's really good, I'm working on, that
dialog: is good, I feel it could be big, it this, eh, and it's, you know,
dialog: it's incredible. Am I right, did you say beyond recognition'?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. DAY
dialog: 
text: David and Juliet are seated as before.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I should hope so.
dialog: 
text: david turns towards her. He reaches out and softly touches her
dialog: face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Maybe we can still sort everything out.
dialog: 
text: Juliet takes his hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: We can try.
dialog: 
text: They look at one another.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST. DAY
dialog: 
text: Several police and unmarked vehicles, including one mobile
text: incident room', stand on a rough track. Another car arrives at
text: the end and is parkeed to one side. Alex steps out.
dialog: 
text: From where he stands, Alex can see towards the site of the
text: burials. There are a few policemen, uniformed and plain-clothes,
text: and a small knot of journalists, kept at bay by plastic tape
text: draped from tree to tree. Mounds of earth mark the site of the
text: exhumations.
dialog: 
text: Alex walks past the other journalists into the woods. He looks
text: back towards the sight, then turns to look in the opposite
text: direction. He finds himself at the edge of a golf course. From
text: the green to the graves is hardly any distance.
dialog: 
text: To one side, Alex sees McCall and Mitchell, hunched in earnest
text: discussion. Mitchell looks up briefly and ctaches Alex's eye.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BINT. KITCHEN/HALL. DAY
dialog: 
text: The kitchen is empty. We track through the kitchen and out into
text: the hall, stopping at the door to Juliet's room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JULIET'S ROOM. DAY
dialog: 
text: David and Juliet are seated on the bed. Among the junk on her
text: bedside table is the Polaroid photograph of Alex, propped up
text: against a tumbler. Juliet reaches out and turns it away before
text: pulling David towards her.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MOBILE INCIDENT ROOM. DAY
dialog: 
text: Several journalists sit close together on plastic chairs. Alex
text: sits at the back, near the half-open door. At the other end,
text: three police officers face them. They are a medium-ranking
text: Uniformed Officer, and to one side of him Mitchell and then
text: McCall, both of whom sit in silence.
dialog: 
scene_heading: UNIFORMED OFFICER
dialog: All right, ladies and gentlemen, the releasable and print-worthy
dialog: facts of the day so far are as follows. Late yesterdat afternoon,
text: forestry workers came across one set of human remains lying in a
text: grave which appeared to have been recently dug. Further
dialog: excavation on our part has revealed two similar, deeper graves,
text: again containing human remains.
dialog: 
text: Alex turns his head and looks out of the door towards the burial
text: site, now enclosed in a plastic tent. He continues to stare at
dialog: it.
dialog: 
text: While Alex is looking, the sound of laughter and Uniformed
text: Officer's subsequent comments become muted and we hear the memory
text: of a sound in Alex's head: it is the noise of the saw going back
text: and forth across the victim's limbs.
dialog: 
scene_heading: UNIFORMED OFFICER
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: As and when the corpses are removed, we will endeavour to
dialog: ascertain the mode of death and duration of burial, as well as
dialog: identification, which will of course be passed on to you after
dialog: informing, where possible, the next of kin.
dialog: 
text: Alex discreetly stands up and slips out of the van.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST. DAY
dialog: 
text: Alex walks away from the incident room towards his car. He breaks
text: into a run for a few paces.
dialog: 
text: The noise of the sawing continues.
dialog: 
text: As he reaches his car, Alex fumbles in his pockets for his keys.
text: He is sweating and trembling. He drops his keys. As he bends down
text: to pick them up, his foot slips on the wet grass. He falls to his
text: knees, his forehead banging against the car door. He kneels for a
text: moment, gripping the keys, his head resting against the door.
dialog: 
text: The noise of the sawing stops.
dialog: 
text: From behind, the arm of a Police Constable reaches out and his
text: hand rests on Alex's shoulder.
speaker_heading: THE END
