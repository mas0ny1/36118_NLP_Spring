scene_heading: EXT. FARM - DAY
dialog: 
text: It is a hot summer day. A large run down farm house,
text: several sheds, a red roof barn and a decrepid silo sit
text: between fields of dry, uncut grass, in a serene isolated
dialog: valley.
dialog: 
text: TWO MEN tack together a broken fence that encloses an
text: overgrown paddock.
dialog: 
text: THREE WOMEN work in a vegetable garden.
dialog: 
text: TWO WOMEN hang wet clothes on a clothes line.
dialog: 
text: TWO MEN work in a cluttered garage on an old car.
dialog: 
text: FOUR WOMEN sit in a circle on a broken down, buckling
text: front porch. One woman breast feeds a new born. The
text: others knit a large blanket.
dialog: 
text: TWO WOMEN and TWO MEN swim naked in a swimming hole.
dialog: 
text: A MAN in his forties sits alone in a room reading.
dialog: 
text: A MAN chops wood.
dialog: 
text: A bare foot TODDLER plays alone in the driveway.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FARM HOUSE - DAY
dialog: 
text: A large room with unfinished wood walls has several
text: blankets and pillows laid out like beds on the floor.
dialog: 
text: TWO WOMEN are in the kitchen preparing food.
dialog: 
text: MARTHA, sets a table for eight. Martha is beautiful but
text: appears run down. She is 24 years old but her weathered
text: face makes her look older. A bell rings off screen.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FARM HOUSE DINING ROOM - EVENING
dialog: 
text: The men sit around a table eating dinner.
dialog: 
text: One man sits at the head of the table, this is PATRICK.
text: Patrick is older than the other men. To his right is
text: WATTS, a man in his early twenties with a greasy patchy
dialog: beard.
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The women are scattered around the kitchen waiting. The
text: men finish dinner, pass through the kitchen and walk
dialog: outside.
dialog: 
text: The women file into the dining room, clear the men's
text: dishes, put more chairs around the table, and bring out a
text: new serving of food.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FARM HOUSE DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: The women sit around the table eating very small portions
text: of low protein food. Katie sits at the head of the table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FARM HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
dialog: 
text: The kitchen is filled with dishes.
dialog: 
text: TWO BABIES sleep next to each other in an old broken
text: crib. A teenage girl sleeps on the floor next to the
dialog: crib.
dialog: 
text: People are strewn all over the house sleeping. Suddenly,
text: a figure passes quickly through frame.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FARM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Martha walks out the front door, across the porch, and up
text: the driveway. She carries a small bag.
dialog: 
text: Her pace becomes increasingly faster. She looks back to
text: see a teenage girl, SARAH, standing in the window
dialog: watching.
dialog: 
text: Martha turns and walks faster, heading straight for the
text: woods. As she gets to the edge of the trees she begins
dialog: to run.
dialog: 
text: SLOW ZOOM: MARTHA DISAPPEARS INTO THE THICK WOODS.
dialog: 
text: Off screen, the house DOOR SLAMS SHUT. A MAN urgently
text: yells out: "MARCY MAY"
dialog: 
text: The camera holds on the trees shaking gently in the wind.
text: For a moment everything is quiet.
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, A MAN and TWO WOMEN enter frame and run into
text: the woods, chasing after Martha.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The woods are dark. Martha runs as fast as she can. She
text: hears the MAN's voice calling her from a distance. A man
text: and two women are chasing her.
dialog: 
text: Martha arrives at a steep heavily wooded hill. She keeps
text: running at full speed, then slips, falls, and rolls.
dialog: 
text: Martha ducks behind a fallen tree and looks back to see
text: the group arrive at the ridge to survey the woods and
text: begin their descent.
dialog: 
text: Martha holds still, listening as the people chasing her
text: pass by.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DINER PARKING LOT - DAY
dialog: 
text: Martha uses a pay phone at a diner. She dials and waits.
text: She is struck by the voice that answers, she transforms
text: from being a zombie to being flooded with emotion.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Martha doesn't know what to say, she bursts into tears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT'D)
dialog: Martha? What's wrong? What's happened?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I don't know. I should go back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Go back where?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Sorry for calling.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Martha! Don't hang up. Please! Do not

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I can't wait that long.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: It's okay, you don't have to-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I want to see you Martha. Please.
dialog: 
text: Martha thinks for a moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT'D)
dialog: Martha!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DINER - DAY
dialog: 
text: Martha sits alone in a booth hunched over a grilled
text: cheese sandwich and french fries. She devours the food
text: like she hasn't eaten in days.
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The entrance bell rings. Martha turns around and
text: cautiously peers over the booth. A FAMILY walks in. They
text: are seated. Martha returns to eating.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Marcy May?
dialog: 
text: It is Watts. His voice paralyzes her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: What are you doin'?
dialog: 
text: Martha stops eating. He slides into the booth and sits
text: across from her.
dialog: 
text: Watts reaches over and takes some french fries. He eats
text: them slowly, enjoying every bite. She can't look at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS (CONT'D)
dialog: We were worried about you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I'm fine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: Patrick's worried about you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I just wanted to come into town.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: I could've brought you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I wanted to walk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: Through the woods?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
speaker_heading: (TO WATTS)
dialog: Can I get you something?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
speaker_heading: (TO MARTHA)
dialog: You done?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The waitress goes to take Martha's plate. Watts puts his
text: hand out to stop her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
speaker_heading: (TO MARTHA)
dialog: You not gonna eat that?
dialog: 
text: Watts takes the half grilled cheese sandwich and stuffs
text: it into his mouth. The waitress clears the plate.
dialog: 
text: Watts takes Martha's napkin and wipes the grease from his
text: hands and mouth while he chews.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS (CONT'D)
dialog: You ready to go?
dialog: 
text: Martha doesn't respond.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Not right now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: No?
dialog: 
text: The waitress drops the check on the table.
dialog: 
text: Watts stares at Martha for another moment before reaching
text: into his pocket to pull out a mess of small papers. He
text: sorts through them and separates a $20 bill. He stuffs
text: the rest of the papers back into his pocket. He grabs her
text: hand, places the money in her palm and grips it closed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll get this.
dialog: 
text: He lets go. Her hand goes limp and the money falls on the
text: table. She does not look at him. He leans in and forces
text: eye contact with her.
dialog: 
text: Watts, growing increasingly tense, stands up and glances
text: around the diner. It is very busy. He does not want to
text: make a scene in front of all these people.
dialog: 
text: He leans down and kisses Martha on the cheek. She doesn't
text: kiss back. He holds his forehead to her forehead until
text: she reacts. She reluctantly kisses him on the lips.
dialog: 
text: Martha watches him walk outside. As soon as his back is
text: turned, she gets up, runs through the diner, and suddenly
text: cuts through the kitchen.
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BUS STOP - LATER
dialog: 
text: Martha sits on the ground hiding between two benches at

text: vomits behind the bench.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BUS STOP - LATER
dialog: 
text: Martha hides between two parked buses. She watches a
text: BLACK BMW pull into the parking lot. LUCY, a well dressed

text: walks towards Lucy. Lucy rushes over and hugs Martha.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LUCY'S CAR - DAY
dialog: 
text: Martha, wrapped in Lucy's sweater, leans her head against

dialog: mirror.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: It's nice to see you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: You too.
dialog: 
text: Lucy notices that Martha's left ear is bruised.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: What's going on?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Not much.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY

dialog: Martha thinks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT'D)
dialog: What happened?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: We had a fight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Who?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Me and this guy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Who?

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT'D)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: No!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Are you sure?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: No. I'm fine.
dialog: 
text: Lucy is skeptical.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Did you guys break up?
dialog: 
text: Martha nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT'D)
dialog: How long were you together?

speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: A while.
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: How long?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I don't know. Maybe a year, maybe more or
dialog: less.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: And you were here the whole time?
dialog: 
text: Martha nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT'D)
dialog: You've been back in New York for over a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I'm sorry.
dialog: 
text: Lucy is upset but manages to remain calm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I made you some tea.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 
text: Lucy takes a small hand towel and dries Martha's hair.

speaker_heading: LUCY

speaker_heading: MARTHA

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Get some sleep, you'll be as good as new

scene_heading: INT. LAKE HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Lucy sits at the kitchen table with a glass of RED WINE.
text: The front door opens. She puts on a smile as TED enters.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Well?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
text: She seems okay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED

speaker_heading: LUCY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED

speaker_heading: LUCY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: It's okay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY

speaker_heading: (HALF JOKING)

speaker_heading: LUCY
speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: I don't know.

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LAKE HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The house is completely dark. Martha finds her way
text: through the hallway and into the kitchen. She drinks
text: water from the faucet with an insatiable thirst.
dialog: 
text: The kitchen has large windows, through which a bright
text: spot light, lights the porch but pitch black darkness is
text: beyond that. Martha is scared to look outside. She forces

text: and quickly returns to her room.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LAKE HOUSE/MARTHA'S BEDROOM - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Martha is wrapped in a wet towel sleeping on the floor.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Well I love it.
dialog: 
text: Lucy puts some eggs on a plate for Martha.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA

speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Yeah. Do you still like to swim?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: You don't live in the city anymore?

speaker_heading: LUCY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT'D)
text: Ted's finishing a new building down town

dialog: pictures?
dialog: 
text: Lucy gets up from the table and walks to another room.
text: Martha sniffs her food. Ted doesn't notice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED
speaker_heading: (TO MARTHA)
dialog: Do you think she's excited to have you
dialog: back?
dialog: 
text: Lucy re-enters with her digital camera.

speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: This is the view, the interiors are

speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 13.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT'D)
dialog: We were supposed to move in the spring
dialog: but construction halted, so, it'll just
dialog: be a little while longer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED
speaker_heading: (SARCASTIC)
dialog: Yep, just a little while longer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Okay, sorry, no more work talk.

speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Why?

speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Just wondered.

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FARM FIELD - DAY
dialog:

speaker_heading: PATRICK

speaker_heading: ZOE

speaker_heading: PATRICK

speaker_heading: PATRICK

speaker_heading: TED
speaker_heading: (SMIRKING)

speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Martha! What are you doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY

dialog: 17.
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Why?

speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: You just can't. There are kids around and

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: So?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: So you can't. We don't, just don't. I
