speaker_heading: BONEY
dialog: Thoughts on a weapon?
speaker_heading: DONNELLY
dialog: (pointing on his photo)
dialog: The trajectory indicates blunt

dialog: first say this: I had nothing to do
dialog: with the disappearance of my wife.
dialog: I am cooperating fully with the
dialog: police. I have never hired a

dialog: Some so-called journalists
dialog: -especially a certain Southern
dialog: belle who shall remain

dialog: screaming: NICK, was AMY pregnant? NICK is this true? GO
text: stands stunned, melting wax dripping from her candle. ANDIE
text: runs away in tears. PANDEMONIUM. TOTAL CHAOS. BONEY and

speaker_heading: GILPIN
dialog: You do any housekeeping the day
dialog: your wife went missing?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BONEY
dialog: OK, because our guys did a Luminol
dialog: test, and I'm sorry to tell you,
text: the kitchen lit up. Amy lost a lot
text: of blood there. A lot.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Oh my god.
speaker_heading: BONEY
dialog: And then someone mopped it up.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Wait. If someone were staging a
dialog: crime scene, why mop up blood?
speaker_heading: BONEY
dialog: (too patiently)
dialog: No blood and no body suggests
dialog: kidnapping-which tells us to look
text: at people outside the house.
speaker_heading: GILPIN
dialog: Like the homeless you keep
dialog: mentioning.
speaker_heading: BONEY
text: A pool of blood and no body
dialog: suggests homicide. Which tells us
text: to look at people inside the house.
dialog: Which is what we’re doing here.
text: A beat. NICK tries to keep his cool.
speaker_heading: BONEY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: GILPIN
dialog: Money. Lack thereof.
speaker_heading: BONEY
dialog: Me and my ex, same. I mention it *
dialog: because we've had a look at your *
dialog: finances, Nick. Phew!
text: She scatters a dozen CREDIT CARD BILLS across the table: all
text: with NICK's NAME, all marked LATE. PAY NOW.
speaker_heading: BONEY (CONT'D)
dialog: One hundred and seventeen thousand
dialog: dollars in credit-card debt in the *

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Let me see those!
text: Nick scans the bills.
speaker_heading: BONEY
dialog: We pulled up some of the

text: She sets out print-outs of ONLINE purchase pages: the TV,

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Jesus! This is identity theft or

speaker_heading: BONEY

scene_heading: GG - Blue Draft - 8/29/13 75.
speaker_heading: BONEY
dialog: In April, you bumped up Amy’s life

speaker_heading: BONEY
dialog: You filed the paperwork.

dialog: So my question becomes-
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I think I need a lawyer.
text: Gilpin can’t help but smirk at Boney.
scene_heading: EXT. DUNNE HOUSE - LATER A110

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I wanted kids. We’d been trying. No *

speaker_heading: GO
