scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM
dialog: 
text: A dozen or so shadowy people are seated in the darkened room.
text: A slide projector dimly lights MR. FULLER, a crew-cutted
text: Robert Stack type in a suit, as he addresses the group. The
text: current slide is a still from a security video of a blurry
text: figure - it could be any of about a billion people.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FULLER
dialog: ...So, let's keep a steely eye out
dialog: for this bastard. (THEN) Before we
dialog: dismiss, this is your monthly
dialog: reminder of why we're here.
dialog: 
text: Fuller advances to a slide of the American flag. Close on
text: one of the group - a heavyset bald man in his mid-thirties.
text: He politely pays close attention to the presentation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FULLER (CONT'D)
dialog: The American people want to travel.
text: (Slide: Family in front of a fake
dialog: dinosaur) They want to attend
dialog: baseball contests (Slide: Fat guys
text: spilling beers as they go for a
dialog: foul ball) and popular music
dialog: concerts. (Slide: John Tesh)
dialog: 
text: Close on another face in the group. A doughy man with three-
text: day scruff and a trendily long haircut. He looks bored,
text: rolling his eyes at the speech.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FULLER (CONT'D)
dialog: They want to be happy. (Slide: People
dialog: line dancing) But, Security comes
text: first. (Slide: Army soldier with a
text: massive machine gun guards a play-
dialog: ground) Without security there can be
dialog: no happy. You are America's front
text: line in the global war on terror.
dialog: Let's hit the trenches and let's be
text: careful out there. (Slide: TSA logo)
dialog: 
text: The lights come up and as the group files out we get a better
text: look at their uniforms. The TSA agents move out into the...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT - SECURITY CHECK POINT - DAY
dialog: 
text: The agents take their places, manning the screening
text: equipment. We push in on the bald man as he takes up his
text: post next to the walk-through metal detector. This is KIRK
text: KETTNER. He is not a looker. His uniform only serves to
text: highlight his least attractive features but his eyes and
dialog: demeanor are pleasant and kind.
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The scruffy agent is STAINER. He stands at the x-ray
text: monitor. As the bags begin to move through, he does not pay
text: any attention, rather he hands Kirk a flyer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Kirk, bro. Tonight?
dialog: 
text: INSERT: The flyer reads, "Wheel in the Sky - a Tribute to
text: Journey at Club Vertigo - Every Tuesday Night!" Stainer is
text: pictured wearing a massive afro in the band photo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I don't know, Stainer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Dude, you never come see us
dialog: anymore. It's been like four
dialog: months. Time to forget about
text: Marnie and get back on the whores.
dialog: 
text: Stainer does a sex dance that makes everyone uncomfortable.
text: Fuller shoots a stern look from his office.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: It's not that. It's my Grandma.
dialog: I'll probably be at the hospital
dialog: for the next few nights.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Oh, shit. I spaced that. How's
dialog: she doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
text: She's hanging in there but it
text: doesn't look good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Dude, I'm sorry. She's a great
dialog: lady. That sucks.
dialog: 
text: A Middle-Eastern man in a cowboy hat is next in line. Mr.
text: Fuller appears behind Kirk, taps his shoulder and subtly
text: motions to the Arab. Kirk smiles at the potential terrorist.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Hey there, Habib.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HABIB
dialog: (perfect English with a

speaker_heading: KIRK

speaker_heading: HABIB

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I'm sorry. It's just...
dialog: 
text: Kirk gestures to his boss as he zips the bag back up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, Habib, you're all set buddy.
dialog: Have a good trip.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HABIB
dialog: Thanks Kirk. See you next time.
dialog: 
text: Fuller again appears behind Kirk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HABIB (CONT'D)
dialog: (to fuller - now in a
dialog: thick Arab accent)
dialog: Praise be to Allah.

scene_heading: EXT. AIRPORT CURB - DAY
dialog: 
text: Follow a pair of perfect female legs as the woman's heels
text: click along the sidewalk, suitcase rolling behind. Although
dialog: we can't see the woman riding on these legs, we can see
text: several men stare as she passes by on her way into...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT TICKETING
dialog: 
text: More stares from more men and even a few women as we follow
text: the legs to the check-in line. The legs glide to the front
text: and stop to wait for the next available ticket agent.
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: From the slightly upward angle, we see two young male ticket
text: agents. (One on each side of the legs.) One is black and one
text: white; each are dealing with customers. They simultaneously
text: notice our woman. They suspiciously eye one another and the
text: race is on. Each agent begins typing furiously to expedite
text: their current customer in the hope of waiting on her next.
dialog: 
text: Angle on the WHITE AGENT as he waits on a yuppie couple.
dialog: 
scene_heading: WHITE AGENT
speaker_heading: (RUSHED)
dialog: Okay, how many bags are you
dialog: checking? Any bags!?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YUPPIE MAN
dialog: Is this one too big to carry on?
dialog: 
scene_heading: WHITE AGENT
dialog: No. Carry it on. Good call.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YUPPIE WOMAN
dialog: Grant, you don't want to lug that
text: thing all over the airport.
dialog: 
text: The agent leans back and issues a bothered sigh. He looks to
text: his right to check the progress of the BLACK AGENT, who is
text: waiting on an old Asian woman.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BLACK AGENT
speaker_heading: (RUSHED)
dialog: Did you pack your bags yourself?
dialog: 
text: The Asian woman obviously did not understand a word of the
text: question but she smiles and nods along.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ASIAN WOMAN
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BLACK AGENT
dialog: Has anyone unknown to you asked you
dialog: to carry anything onto your flight?
dialog: 
text: More smiles and blank nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ASIAN WOMAN
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BLACK AGENT
dialog: I think you mean NO.
dialog: 
scene_heading: WHITE AGENT
dialog: You can't do that!

scene_heading: BLACK AGENT

speaker_heading: YUPPIE MAN
dialog: Where exactly is gate F5?
dialog: 
scene_heading: WHITE AGENT
dialog: Just past F4. Have a day now
dialog: folks. Let's hustle it up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ASIAN WOMAN
dialog: Sank you!
dialog: 
scene_heading: BLACK AGENT
dialog: No sweat. Keep it moving.
dialog: 
text: The Asian woman is not going anywhere. The black agent leans
text: into her face and barks once like a dog. Her smile turns to
text: fear as she backs away, ending the race in a dead tie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOTH AGENTS
dialog: Next!
dialog: 
text: Reverse to show the woman they were competing for. She is a
text: classy, sophisticated, blonde around thirty. Drop dead
text: beautiful. She is startled by the sudden call from both men.
text: She laughs off her little scare and then randomly chooses the
text: black agent. He shoots a smug victory grin over to his co-
text: worker, who is being an overtly sore loser.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Hi, I'm booked on flight 94 to
text: Burbank. Molly McCall.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BLACK AGENT
dialog: (trying way too hard)
dialog: California. Fantastic. So do you
dialog: travel quite a bit?
dialog: 
text: The white agent moves to loiter around the black agent's
text: station, just to get a better look at MOLLY.
dialog: 
scene_heading: WHITE AGENT
dialog: Hey Derek. You got the numbers on
dialog: the (making it up as he goes) new,

dialog: 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Stainer works the next x-ray belt, where a young rocker type
text: is running a guitar case through. Stainer stops the belt and
text: moves it back to get a better look.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Les Paul Classic re-issue?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKER
speaker_heading: (SMUG)
dialog: No, it's a sixty-five. Mint.

speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Fuck you. No way.
dialog: 
text: The rocker boy looks at his watch as Stainer rolls the case
text: through and pops it open.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKER
dialog: Dude, I'm late for my flight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Sorry, I have to search this case
dialog: for, you know, explosives and such.
dialog: This thing is sweet!
dialog: 
text: Stainer takes the guitar out and starts riffing on it as the
text: bins and bags pile up before him.
dialog: 
text: At Kirk's station, Molly (the blonde bombshell) is crossing
text: through. Every guy who can see her has been struck dumb but
text: Kirk banters with her like he would anyone else. No flirting
text: or stammering - just friendly and relaxed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Morning.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Oh, hello again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Second trip in two days?
dialog: 
text: Molly is putting her laptop back in her bag.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Uggh. Yeah. It's just a short hop
dialog: to L.A. but they've got me going
text: back and forth three days in a row.
dialog: This client is killing me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Well hang in there kiddo and I
dialog: guess I'll see you tomorrow.
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: It's a date.
dialog: 
text: Molly's long legs carry her toward the gates as every man
text: except Kirk watches. Fuller saunters up and nudges Kirk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FULLER
dialog: Did'ja see that? Boy would I ever
dialog: like to...you know...put my penis
text: in her vagina. (wink)
dialog: 
text: Back at Stainer's station. As he puts the guitar back in its
text: case, he scratches it on the corner of the x-ray machine.
text: Stainer and rocker boy lock in shocked gazes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKER
dialog: What the hell!?
dialog: 
text: He grabs his guitar and inspects a wicked scratch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Dude, I am so sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKER
dialog: Sorry my ass! This thing is worth
dialog: more than you make in a year, you
dialog: clumsy motherfucker!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Yeah, I bet it was but...
dialog: 
text: Stainer points to a white sign mounted in an acrylic stand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER (CONT'D)
dialog: "TSA is not responsible for items
dialog: lost or damaged in the security
dialog: screening process..."
dialog: 
text: Stainer flips the sign around to reveal a few more words hand-

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. KETTNER
dialog: Oh, hi Sweetie.
dialog: 
text: Across the room, Kirk's father is speaking to a man who looks
text: a bit like Kirk. The man is telling a funny story that
text: cracks up MR. KETTNER. The two pretend to box for a moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Who's that guy Dad's with?
dialog: 
text: MARNIE (the plain woman) stands and takes Kirk aside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: Kirk, you've been really great about
dialog: your mom and I staying so close
dialog: since we broke up but I know how
dialog: much Grammy meant to you... Well, is
dialog: it okay with you that I'm here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Sure. It's fine. (it's not)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: Okay, good. Then can I introduce
dialog: you to my new boyfriend?
dialog: 
text: She leads Kirk over to the man who is speaking with his
text: father. They are laughing again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ron, this is Kirk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Uh, oh - the ex. Awkward! (Ron
dialog: and Mr. Kettner laugh) No! I'm

dialog: Great to meet you. How you doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I've been better.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Right. Of course. I'm sorry about

dialog: Well, old people, you know, what
dialog: are you gonna do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Yeah. Thanks.
dialog: 
text: Kirk's brother ERIC and his fiance DEBBIE enter from the

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Little brother. Grammy wants to

text: Eric and Debbie walk with Kirk down the hall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Listen, I'm pretty sure she wants
dialog: to discuss the will. She won't
dialog: tell us dick, so we're kind of
dialog: hoping you can grease the wheels.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Okay, but you know Grammy didn't
dialog: have all that much. Once the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Yeah, yeah, the cremation and what
dialog: not...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Well, it's not going to leave

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: We've got a wedding to pay for,
dialog: Kirk and...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Debbie, let me handle this. We've
dialog: got a wedding to pay for, numbnuts,
dialog: and you know Mom and Dad are going
dialog: to Branson next month. Now you
dialog: always been Grammy's favorite so
dialog: we're counting on you to get in

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - GRAMMY'S ROOM
dialog: 
text: In a dimly lit hospital room, a very old woman lies in a bed.
text: She is hooked up to an I.V. and several monitors. Kirk comes
text: in and forces a smile. Grammy's voice is weak and shaky.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRAMMY
dialog: There you are Big Slick. Did you
dialog: bring 'em?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Grammy, you really shouldn't...
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRAMMY
dialog: Just hand 'em over. I'm on death's
dialog: door and you know it.
dialog: 
text: Kirk sits and reluctantly hands her a pack of cigarettes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRAMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, for Christ's sake. Filters?
dialog: 
text: Grammy lights up a smoke and savors a long drag. Kirk tears
text: up at how slightly his grandmother clings to life.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I love you Grammy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRAMMY
dialog: Don't start that shit now. You're
text: looking at one lucky old broad who's
dialog: done a lot - skydiving, rollerderby,
dialog: colored fellas. I got no complaints.
dialog: So when the check comes I don't want
dialog: any blubbering or bullshit outta
dialog: you. Just enjoy your life like I
dialog: did mine and raise a glass to your
dialog: old Grammy once in a while.
dialog: 
text: Kirk hugs her and he cries a bit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRAMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: You know how much I love you Kirk.

scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY
dialog: 
text: Molly is coming through Kirk's lane again. Mr. Fuller steps
text: in and stops her before she crosses through.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FULLER
dialog: Ma'am, could you please remove your
dialog: jacket and shoes?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Oh, sure.
dialog: 
text: She does. Fuller is leering at her stellar body. She's
text: about to go through when he stops her again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FULLER
dialog: Why don't we go ahead and strip off
dialog: that belt too while we're at it.
dialog: 
text: Molly takes an exasperated breath as she removes her belt.
text: She starts to move through but again Fuller stops her with a
text: raised palm. He then motions to her breasts and crotch.

speaker_heading: FULLER (CONT'D)
dialog: Any piercings you'd like me to know
dialog: about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Why don't you just come on through,
dialog: ma'am, and we'll see if anything
text: sets off the machine.
dialog: 
text: Molly steps through. The machine does not go off. She
text: gathers her things and mouths a silent, "Thank You" to Kirk
text: as she walks on. Fuller glares at Kirk but before he can say
text: anything, RANDY, a young agent, calls out from the office.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Kirk buddy! Phone call!
dialog: 
text: Kirk walks over to take the call.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FULLER
dialog: You best hope the terrorists are

dialog: too, mister!
dialog: 
text: Kirk takes the phone from Randy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: This is Kirk Kettner.
dialog: 
text: Kirk's expression tells us that some sad news is coming in.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT COFFEE SHOP - DAY
dialog: 
text: Kirk sits at a table with a cup of coffee. He opens his
text: wallet and flips to a photo of a much younger Grammy and an
text: eight-year-old Kirk in a casino. Grammy is smoking a
text: cigarette and dealing blackjack while Kirk sits at the table.
dialog: 
text: Kirk tears up and puts his face in his hands.
dialog: 
text: Molly is passing. She sees Kirk and stops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Oh Geeze. Please tell me I didn't
dialog: get you in trouble back there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No, no. It's not that. I ah...I

speaker_heading: MOLLY

dialog: know... I lost my grandmother a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Your grandmother too? And you were
dialog: close? Oh, you poor thing.
dialog: 
text: Kirk tries to keep it together. Molly looks at the photo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: She used to be a blackjack dealer
dialog: at the Horseshoe. When I was
dialog: little, she taught me and my
dialog: friends how to play poker. Turned
text: us into a bunch of eight-year-old
dialog: degenerate gamblers.
dialog: 
text: They share a sad laugh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK (CONT'D)
dialog: So, your grandmother too, huh?
dialog: 
text: Molly removes a small clear-plastic booklet of photos from
text: her bag and shows a picture of her grandmother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: My Grammy Keenan was ninety four
dialog: but independent right to the end.
dialog: She was always trying to cook for
dialog: everyone. You couldn't stop her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Oh, God, I know. Grammy used to
dialog: change her own oil. Right up until
dialog: a few months ago. She was... Do
dialog: you change your own oil?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
speaker_heading: (LAUGHS)
dialog: No. I wouldn't know where to begin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I know, me neither. She could
dialog: barley walk and I'd come over and
text: find her lying under her Cadillac
text: all covered in grease.

speaker_heading: KIRK

scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT COFFEE SHOP

dialog: pouch are some business cards that read, "Molly McCall -
text: Event Planner." Her cell number is on the card.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. AIRPLANE 737
dialog: 
text: Molly is sitting in a window seat. The flight is mostly
text: empty. The two other seats in her row are unoccupied until a
text: CREEPY BUSINESSMAN moves from the row behind her to the seat
text: next to Molly. He casually smiles as though there is nothing
text: odd about taking the center seat while the aisle seat (and
text: many full rows) are open. Molly looks at the vacant seats
text: and then at him as if to say, "You've got to be kidding."
dialog: 
scene_heading: CREEPY BUSINESSMAN
dialog: How you doin'?

dialog: 
text: Kirk comes in and stops at the bar to order a beer. Two men
text: are waving to him from a table near the stage. Kirk gets his
text: bottle and snakes through the crowd toward his friends.
dialog: 
text: On stage, Stainer (in his afro wig) plays guitar as his band
text: finishes the last chorus of "Lovin', Touchin' Squeezin'."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Thank you! We're going to take a
dialog: little breakski but we'll be back
text: in a few minutes to do Frontiers.
dialog: 
text: The band turns to put down their instruments and the house
text: music kicks in.
dialog: 
text: Kirk arrives where his friends are standing at a high bar
text: table. DEVON looks like Howdy Doody at 33. JACK is good-
text: looking and dressed semi-hipster. Devon gives Kirk a hug.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEVON
dialog: Hey Kirk. How you been holdin' up?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: It's been a rough week but, you
dialog: know, all of the services and
dialog: family stuff keep you pretty
dialog: busy... I really miss her, though.
dialog: 
text: Jack hugs Kirk as well.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: She sounded like a hell of a lady.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER (O.S.)
dialog: Oh, fuck yeah! Kirk's Grandma was
dialog: the shit.
dialog: 
text: Stainer arrives, hugs Kirk and gives him a kiss on the head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER (CONT'D)
dialog: She's with God now, buddy - and you
dialog: just know she's bustin' his balls.
dialog: 
text: Kirk laughs and Stainer raises his glass.
dialog: 
dialog: 16.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER (CONT'D)
dialog: To Stella!
dialog: 
text: The guys all raise their glasses and take a drink. This is
text: just what Grammy wanted and it's cheering Kirk up.
dialog: 
text: Kirk's cell phone rings. He has to talk loud over the music.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Hello?... Oh, Hi. I'm sorry I can
dialog: barely hear you. I'm at a club
dialog: and.... Club Vertigo? Oh, yeah -
text: it's right down the street from
dialog: there... Okay, sounds good.
dialog: 
text: Kirk hangs up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What was that all about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
text: Nothing, just a passenger. She
dialog: accidentally left something with
dialog: me. She's going to stop in and
dialog: pick it up I guess.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEVON
dialog: She's coming here? She a cute gal?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Very.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Well alright dude! That's a leave-
dialog: behind. She digs you!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No she doesn't. Trust me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
text: She does a leave behind and then
dialog: just happens to be in the
dialog: neighborhood? She practically has
dialog: her hands in your pants.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No, seriously - it's nothing. She's
dialog: way out of my league.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Dude, you said Marnie was out of
dialog: your league and let's face it,
dialog: Marnie's kinda nasty.
dialog: 
dialog: 17.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Marnie is standing behind Stainer. He doesn't miss a beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER (CONT'D)
dialog: ...Marnie...don't you think Marnie
dialog: Tomkins is kind of nasty?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: I don't know who that is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Oh, you don't know Marnie Tomkins?
dialog: She's just this girl. I thought you
dialog: knew her. Anyway, she's pretty nasty
dialog: looking... but you're looking good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: Kirk, I'm sorry about Grammy.
dialog: 
text: The guys slink away to give Kirk and Marnie some privacy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I realize she was never that crazy
dialog: about me but I know how much you
dialog: loved her and I hope you're okay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Thanks. Thanks, I'll be alright.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: Listen, are you going to Branson
dialog: with your folks next month?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No. It's not really my thing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: What's wrong with Branson? You too
dialog: good for Branson now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No. Branson's...awesome.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: Well, your mom invited Ron and I
dialog: along. We'd love to go but not if
dialog: it's going to be weird for you.
dialog: 
text: Kirk considers this. It will be weird.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: ...I mean the tickets are non-
dialog: refundable but it's up to you.
dialog: 
dialog: 18.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Stainer overhears this and groans out loud.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No. You should go. I'm sure
dialog: you'll have a great time. Totally.
dialog: 
text: Marnie hugs Kirk. This makes him uncomfortable.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: Kirk, I'm sorry about what happened
dialog: with us. You're going to make
dialog: someone very happy someday, but you
dialog: have to get over me first, okay?
dialog: Is it a deal?
dialog: 
text: Marnie hugs him again and then departs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: She's going to Branson with your
dialog: fucking parents? And bringing her
dialog: new fucking boyfriend!?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Yeah. He seems like a good guy,
dialog: though. He's an entrepreneur.
dialog: 
text: Across the room they see Marnie return to Ron with a hug.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Entrepreneur? Kirk, I know that
text: guy. He owns a Pizza Hut.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: So? That's a business.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
text: It's not even a real Pizza Hut.
dialog: It's one of those strip-mall take-
dialog: out ones. They don't even have
dialog: chicken wings. The guy's a fuckin'
text: douche bag.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: He's got more going on than I do.
dialog: That's all I'm saying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Dude, you can do a hell of a lot
dialog: better than her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEVON
text: One door closes, another door opens.
dialog: 
dialog: 19.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Fuck you Devon, that doesn't even
dialog: make any sense. But take this
dialog: broad that's coming here tonight -
dialog: I got a feeling about her. You're
dialog: gonna get on that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Absolutely. Visualize it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I appreciate what you guys are
dialog: trying to do but, I'm telling you,
dialog: I have zero chance with this one
dialog: and I'm completely okay with that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEVON
dialog: That's defeatist thinking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No it isn't. It's just like saying
dialog: I'll never go to the moon and I'm
dialog: okay with that too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: You're saying you don't want to go
dialog: to the moon? That's bullshit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No. I'm saying that I never will
dialog: go to the moon but I'm not going to
dialog: get down about it because, you know
dialog: - I never expected to.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: You don't know. Technology and
dialog: shit. You might go to the moon.
dialog: 
text: Kirk waves to someone at the door. The guys look up.
dialog: 
text: The guys' POV: Molly is stepping toward them - dressed in a
text: beautiful gown. They laugh the way you might laugh at a
text: particularly brutal football tackle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEVON
dialog: Holy Frijole.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh shit. Yeah, you're right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Sorry, bro. You'll go to the moon
dialog: before you'll hit that. No chance.
dialog: 
dialog: 20.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I told you.
dialog: 
text: Molly arrives at their table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Hey! There you are!
dialog: 
text: Molly hugs Kirk. From across the bar, Marnie takes notice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Here I am.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I'm sorry I'm so overdressed. I
dialog: just came from a work thing. Are
dialog: you doing okay with...everything?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Oh, you know... Hey, these are my
dialog: best friends - Jack, Devon and
dialog: Stainer.
dialog: 
text: The guys' I.Q.s drop like stones as they shake her hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Stainer?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Yeah, just a nickname. Doesn't
dialog: really mean nothin'.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Oh. Here's your pictures - all
dialog: safe and sound.
dialog: 
text: Kirk hands Molly the pictures.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Thank you so much for taking care of
dialog: them for me! I need to get some
dialog: copies made. If I lost these...uugh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No trouble at all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Hey, have you eaten yet?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Um...
dialog: 
dialog: 21.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I was going to go grab a bite. Let
dialog: me buy you dinner to pay you back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: You don't have to pay me back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I know. I want to. Come on! The
text: place across the street has the
text: best greasy burgers in town.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: A burger does sound good. (then to
dialog: the guys) I'm going to just ah...
dialog: 
text: Molly waves goodbye and heads for the door. Kirk starts to
text: follow but Stainer pulls him back for a quick huddle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Dude. It's cool that she's buying
dialog: you dinner but do not get your
dialog: hopes up about this one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Don't worry. Believe me, I know.
dialog: 
text: Kirk catches up with Molly. Marnie watches them exit.
dialog: 
text: A big guy has overheard this and leans over to Stainer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BIG GUY
dialog: Good advice there friend. Your boy
dialog: ain't got a prayer with that chick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: You talking shit about my buddy!?
dialog: 'Cause I'm giving out free fuckin'
dialog: ambulance rides!
dialog: 
text: Big Guy assesses the crazy on Stainer's face and stands down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah, I didn't think so!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BURGER JOINT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Kirk and Molly sit across from one another in a booth. The
text: WAITER arrives.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Start you off with something to
dialog: drink ma'am?
dialog: 
dialog: 22.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I'll have a Bass.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: And for your... brother?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: What? Oh, I'm not her brother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry. I just figured...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: You know what, a Bass sounds good.
dialog: Make that two.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Great. Sorry.
dialog: 
text: The waiter exits.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: So... You know what I do, what
dialog: about you? Your card said event
dialog: planner. How'd you get into that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Well, it wasn't the original plan.
dialog: I went to law school. Ended up at
dialog: a big firm but I hated it. Then,
dialog: they asked me to plan the Christmas
dialog: party. It was a big hit and a few
dialog: months later I was done with law.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Wow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I know. Pernicious career move,
dialog: right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Oh, I don't know what that word
dialog: means. What was it?
dialog: 
text: Close on Molly's smile. She finds Kirk's unabashed admission
dialog: very refreshing and endearing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I'm sorry. Like, destructive or...
dialog: 
dialog: 23.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Oh, okay. No, I don't think that's
dialog: so perni...gious?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Pernicious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Good - new word. No, not pernicious
dialog: at all. Not if you enjoy the work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I really do. We do a lot of
dialog: charity events and I get to work
dialog: with some of the most amazing human
dialog: beings on some really fun projects.
dialog: Next month I'm doing a cancer
dialog: benefit with Billy Joel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Wow. I love Billy Joel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: The only downside is I have to do a
dialog: lot of public speaking and I've
dialog: always struggled with stage fright.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Oh man - That's my number one fear.
dialog: I'm terrified of getting up in
dialog: front of people. I'd rather get a
dialog: Kentucky root canal.
dialog: 
text: Molly laughs. An older GOOD-LOOKING MAN steps up to the
text: table and stands facing her with his back to Kirk.
dialog: 
scene_heading: GOOD-LOOKING MAN
dialog: Excuse me, I was just sitting over
dialog: at the bar and I was wondering; has
dialog: anyone told you today that you are
dialog: absolutely stunning?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Are you seriously hitting on me
dialog: right in front of my boyfriend?
dialog: 
text: He turns to Kirk and both men start to laugh.
dialog: 
scene_heading: GOOD-LOOKING MAN
dialog: This is your boyfriend?
dialog: 
dialog: 24.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Oh, yeah right! (Catches Molly's
dialog: unspoken instructions.) But, yeah.
dialog: I'm her boyfriend, I guess, so...
dialog: 
scene_heading: GOOD-LOOKING MAN
dialog: Really? Wow. Well... sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Honest mistake.
dialog: 
text: The man gives Kirk a wink and wanders back to the bar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Did you get a load of that hair-
dialog: piece? What is it with men? I
dialog: mean, look at you. You're bald and
dialog: you're fine with it. A little
dialog: dignity is all I'm saying. The
dialog: toupees and plugs and the teen-
dialog: dream sports cars... Oh geeze, I'm
dialog: sorry. Do you drive a sports car?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I drive a 94 Taurus. It's got
dialog: AM/FM but I wouldn't call it a
dialog: sports car per se.
dialog: 
text: Molly laughs and we hard cut through the following snippets
text: of conversation as they eat, chat and laugh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK (CONT'D)
dialog: So here's this little old lady
text: trying to go through security with
text: six pounds of weed in her girdle!
dialog: 
text: Cut. The food is being served.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Oh, my God! I love that book!
dialog: 
text: Cut. The waitress is picking up the empty plates.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
text: So, a duck walks into a bar...
dialog: 
text: Cut. Molly is laughing while she's paying the bill.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Well, I've got an early morning. I
dialog: should go. Thanks for coming
dialog: along. This was really fun. And
dialog: thanks again for helping me out.
dialog: 
dialog: 25.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No, thank you for dinner. I feel
dialog: bad that you won't let me...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Oh, stop it. Listen, I handle some
dialog: of the charity events for the
dialog: Coyotes and I've got some tickets
dialog: for the hockey game tomorrow night.
dialog: You interested?
dialog: 
text: Kirk is a bit taken aback and confused. Is she actually
dialog: asking him out on a real date?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
speaker_heading: (NERVOUSLY)
dialog: Um, sure. Yeah, great. I mean,
dialog: I'm free tomorrow night.
dialog: 
text: She digs two tickets out of her purse and hands them over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Perfect. I hate to see them go to
dialog: waste. There's two so maybe bring
dialog: Stainer?
dialog: 
text: Kirk's expression is as much relief as disappointment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Oh, right. Thanks! Thank you.

speaker_heading: KIRK

speaker_heading: STAINER
speaker_heading: (PERPLEXED)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: Hey boys. Nice to meet you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Patty's my assistant and my go-to

speaker_heading: PATTY

dialog: so don't let her freak you out.

speaker_heading: KIRK

dialog: I was like, "what!?" But, okay!
dialog: Well, Patty seems cool. She's funny.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Well, yeah, she has to be.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: What does that mean?

speaker_heading: STAINER

scene_heading: INT. HOCKEY ARENA
dialog: 
text: The game has started. Kirk, Stainer, Molly and Patty are
text: cheering. The puck smacks the glass before them and another
text: player skates up for it. As he mucks it from the edge, he
text: looks up and sees Molly. He's distracted just long enough to
text: get brutally checked face first into the glass. A penalty is
text: called on the player who hit him. That player skates into
text: the penalty box near Molly. The name on his jersey reads,
text: "REESE." He speaks with a thick Canadian accent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REESE
dialog: Hey Molly! Yer lookin' good, eh!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: That was a bogus call, Bobby. Your

speaker_heading: STAINER (CONT'D)
dialog: You dick!

dialog: 
text: Reese wakes up and skates out of the box but it's too late.

speaker_heading: KIRK

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: That's okay, if Reese did that to
dialog: me I'd have gone over the glass
dialog: too. But I would have landed a few
dialog: before they got me. Reese has been

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PATTY
text: It's a curse, looking like that.
dialog: Who has the balls to hit on her?
dialog: Just the most arrogant A-holes like
dialog: Reese out there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Yeah, I suppose.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: Listen, Molly brought me along
dialog: tonight because, you know, she
dialog: thought I might be 'interested.'
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Oh. Oh yeah?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: But, just for honesty's sake, I'm
dialog: not interested. No offense.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No! Hey! None taken. I don't
dialog: blame you. I know I'm no Brad
dialog: Pitt. That's cool.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: What? You? No, I'm talking about
dialog: your pal, Stainer. I know he's your
dialog: friend but he seems like kind of a
dialog: dumbshit. (THEN) Wait. Why would
dialog: you think I was talking about you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to assume
dialog: anything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: Oh my God. You don't have a clue
dialog: do you? Molly's really into you.
dialog: 
dialog: 31.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Oh, yeah right!
dialog: 
text: Kirk laughs hard until he realizes that Patty isn't laughing.
text: Patty's nod says, "I'm serious."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK (CONT'D)
dialog: But... why would...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: A knockout like Molly be interested
dialog: in a spud like you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Well, yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: Got me. Again, no offense. But
dialog: listen, Kirk, your dream girl just
dialog: showed up. Try not to blow it.
dialog: 
text: Close on Kirk's terrified expression. The SOUND of a bowling
text: ball demolishing ten pins...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The place is crowded and classic rock is cranking. It's an
text: old alley with overhead-projection score sheets. Kirk,
text: Stainer and Devon sit and talk while Jack throws a strike.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEVON
dialog: Atta boy Jackers!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: It doesn't add up, Kirk. If
dialog: Molly's so into you, why bring her
dialog: friend and give you two tickets?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
text: She was hoping to set Patty up with
dialog: you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Oh, great.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: It's okay, she wasn't interested.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: So you're saying the hottest babe
dialog: in the world wants you and the fat
dialog: chick isn't into me. Will you
dialog: listen to yourself? Fuck you.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 32.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER (CONT'D)
dialog: What did Molly have to say about
dialog: all this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I don't know, Stainer, somebody got
dialog: thrown out of the game and I had to
dialog: drive him home, remember?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEVON
dialog: Pretty impressive catch, Kirky.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: There's no way. Don't get him all
dialog: worked up. Her friend was fuckin'
dialog: with him. Molly said herself that
dialog: Patty loves to mess with people.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEVON
dialog: Kirk, you deserve a gal like her.
dialog: And Stainer, why don't you try to
dialog: be a little more supportive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Why don't you try a little shut the
dialog: fuck up, Devon. This week, we're
dialog: not taking dating tips from the guy
text: who met his wife in eighth grade.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Are we still bowling?
dialog: 
text: Stainer picks up a crappy, beat up ball from the ball return.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: All I'm saying is - she's just too
dialog: hot. No judgement on Kirky, the
dialog: guy's just outgunned here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
text: I can't argue with him.
dialog: 
text: Stainer goes to the line. The BOWLER (a pro-type with a
text: custom ball and glove) on the next lane is already standing
text: about to roll. Stainer starts to step up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOWLER
dialog: Yo, house ball! I was up first.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Oh for fucks... What is it with you
dialog: people?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOWLER
dialog: Just wait your turn.
dialog: 
dialog: 33.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: All this noise and bullshit in this
dialog: place and I'm such a distraction
dialog: over here in your god damned
dialog: peripheral vision!?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Okay Stains, take it easy.
dialog: 
text: The bowler stands glaring back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Well!? Fuckin' roll then!
dialog: 
text: The bowler takes another minute to set. Stainer lets out a
text: long sigh. The bowler steps to the line and Stainer rushes
text: into his own delivery. Both men throw gutters. The bowler
text: comes at Stainer but their friends separate them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOWLER
dialog: You're lucky motherfucker!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Oh yeah!? Bring it, Brunswick!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEVON
dialog: Stainer! Cool your jets, buster.
dialog: 
text: The bowler's friends drag him away. Stainer takes a deep
text: breath before he shifts right back into conversation mode.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Okay. Anyway... I love Kirky but
dialog: let's face it, the guy's a three.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEVON
dialog: Stainer, that's just dirty pool.
text: He's at least a four.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: You're outta your fuckin' mind -
dialog: four! You go ahead and pump
dialog: rainbows up his ass. I'm just
dialog: being honest.
dialog: 
text: Stainer moves the score sheet and then writes a three on the
text: glass. It projects onto the overhead scoreboard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I can live with three.
dialog: 
dialog: 34.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: He's a nice guy and he's funny.
dialog: Those are a half a point each.
dialog: 
text: Stainer continues the equation on the projector.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER (CONT'D)
dialog: But he drives a shit box so we
dialog: gotta deduct a point for that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEVON
text: Kirk said she likes his Taurus.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: That's so fucked, I won't even
dialog: dignify it with a response. So
text: we're back to three. Meanwhile,
dialog: this Molly is a hard ten.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEVON
dialog: A hard ten?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Generally, if a broad is that hot
dialog: you can deduct a few points for dumb
dialog: or shallow but she went to law
text: school and her sister's blind.
dialog: That's a hard ten, friends, and that
dialog: is rare. A seven point disparity -
dialog: that's a chasm. The most you can
dialog: jump is two points. I can't even
dialog: get a ten.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, not even you, huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: I'm a five, okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Bullshit. Then what am I?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: You're a seven and a half.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Fine, you're a five then.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Okay, so I get a two point bump for
dialog: being in a band. That puts me at
dialog: seven. On a good day, most I can
dialog: bag is a niner.
dialog: 
dialog: 35.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: What about your shitty car?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Artist exemption. I'm expected to
dialog: have a shitty car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Is there an artist exemption for
dialog: being a jag-off?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Fuckin' A there is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Stainer's right. Patty was
text: probably just messing around. It's
dialog: not a big deal. Let's just bowl.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEVON
dialog: What about Rick Ocasek? Billy
dialog: Joel, Donald Trump...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Yeah, dumbass. Those are the wild-
dialog: cards. Money and fame.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: So, if he were a millionaire?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: A mil ain't what it once was,
dialog: Jackie. Devon's practically a
dialog: millionaire for Christ sake. A mil
dialog: might get you an eight but to bring
dialog: down a ten now days - two million
dialog: minimum.
dialog: 
text: Stainer finishes the equation by writing, "Kirk = Fucked."
text: Kirk's phone rings. He checks the ID and his eyes go wide.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: Hey, Molly... Um, yeah, sure...
dialog: No, that sounds good. Yeah, I know
dialog: where that is. Um, okay, yeah...
dialog: see you then.
dialog: 
text: Kirk hangs up and gapes at his friends, who wait in suspense.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK (CONT'D)
text: Holy crap. (dazed pause) She just
dialog: asked me out for tomorrow night!
dialog: 
dialog: 36.
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BOWLING ALLEY MEN'S ROOM
dialog:

dialog:

speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: (thick accent)
dialog: Kirk! You look like someone made a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: You know what Willy. I honestly
dialog: don't know how I'm doing.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER (O.S.)
dialog: Way to go, Big Slick.
dialog: 
text: Stainer is now next to Kirk, who glares back at him as they
text: walk across the food court.
dialog: 
text: A short, plain girl behind the Orange Julius counter gives
text: them an apprehensive wave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, shit. Let's go this way.
dialog: 
text: Stainer returns an uncomfortable smile but then redirects

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Who's that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Nobody. Just some chick I boned
dialog: once when I was drunk. You look
dialog: like shit, bro.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Thanks. I had trouble sleeping
dialog: last night. This Molly thing... I
dialog: don't want to want this, you know?
text: It just seems too good to be true.
dialog: I just don't get it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: I know what you mean. There has to
dialog: be some explanation.

speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I can't think of one. Not one that

dialog:

speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Well, let's spitball it a little.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Please don't say she wants me to
dialog: kill someone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Okay, then... maybe she's on a

dialog: that kind of thing.
dialog: 
text: Kirk is no longer responding.

text: Kirk walks away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OLD STRIP MALL - DAY

speaker_heading: MAURY (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh mercy. I didn't tape over her

speaker_heading: GRAMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyway! I love all of you, despite

dialog: spent my life a gambler and I always
dialog: put my money on the best bet. The

speaker_heading: MAITRE D
dialog: Look, I can appreciate that this is
dialog: not some common street-walker.
dialog: You're obviously willing to pay for
dialog: the best but we can't have this
dialog: kind of thing at my place.
dialog: 
dialog: 45.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: What? I'm not paying anyone.
dialog: We're just on a date.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAITRE D
dialog: You are on a date with her? What
dialog: am I an idiot? Now, I don't wish
dialog: to embarrass you, sir, or make a
dialog: scene. So, enjoy your dinner but,
dialog: be warned, do not ever bring
dialog: another professional into my place.
dialog: (louder and back into the French
dialog: accent) Tres bien Monsieur!

dialog: 
text: When Kirk rounds the corner, he sees that Molly and Talon are
text: still talking. Kirk hides behind a plant. Molly is beaming.
text: She stands to hug Talon and kiss his cheek before he exits
text: the restaurant. Kirk returns to the table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Oh, no. Did I miss Talon?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: He had to go but he asked me tell
dialog: you how much he enjoyed meeting you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Yeah. Super. He, uh, seems like a
dialog: great guy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: He is. He's wonderful. I know, I
dialog: know - the blue eyes and the rock
dialog: hard abs, right? But he's really
dialog: so much more than that. A gallery
dialog: in New York just opened an exhibit
dialog: of his photography. He's a genius.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (to the waiter)
dialog: Can we get the check?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Madame, your bill has been covered
dialog: by ze woman in ze Raiders Jacket.

scene_heading: INT. MOLLY'S CAR - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Molly and Kirk pull into a parking lot.
dialog: 
dialog: 46.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Oh my gosh! This is your
dialog: apartment? I used to live in this
dialog: neighborhood back in college.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Yeah, I'm gonna move to a better
dialog: place pretty soon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: We used to come to parties over
dialog: here sometimes. Oooohh. Can I
dialog: come up and see your place?
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. KIRK'S APARTMENT
dialog: 
text: It's Friday night and several college parties are raging in
text: the complex. Kirk leads Molly up the stairs and down the
text: balcony hall toward his door. They pass a few college
text: students on the way; a couple making out, a guy vomiting in a
text: bush. Two apartment windows are covered with tapestries of
text: Bob Marley and a giant pot leaf.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT
dialog: 
text: Kirk and Molly enter. The apartment is neat, clean and
text: fairly sparse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: It's not much, I know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: No, I like it!
dialog: 
text: Molly walks around and examines certain items. Kirk quietly
text: hides a framed picture of Marnie. Molly passes his computer
text: desk where she coos at a screensaver of baby polar bears.
text: Just as she passes it, she bumps the mouse and the computer
text: comes to life, revealing a "Hot Back-Door Asians" website.
text: Molly didn't see it and Kirk scrambles to turn off the
text: monitor. She turns to see what he's doing. He smiles. She
text: moves on to a rack of DVDs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Wow, we have a lot of the same
dialog: DVDs. Life of Brian, Cool Hand
dialog: Luke, Family Guy... Beaches, Kirk?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: What? It's a good movie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I love that movie.
dialog: 
dialog: 47.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She spots a crate full of vinyl records.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Wow, records. No Way! Look at all
dialog: this Cheap Trick!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: You like Cheap Trick?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Are you kidding? Heaven Tonight is
dialog: the first album I ever owned! A
dialog: hand-me-down from my big sister.
dialog: She was the coolest person in the
dialog: whole world.
dialog: 
text: She notices an upright piano in the corner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY (CONT'D)
dialog: You play the piano?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: A little. My grandma taught me.
dialog: It was kind of our thing. She was
dialog: a great player. Ragtime, show
dialog: tunes, that kind of thing. I'm
dialog: really not very good.
dialog: 
text: She plops down on the couch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Oh, I'll bet you're great. Play
dialog: something for me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No, I can't really play in front of
dialog: people.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: What, the stage fright thing? Come
dialog: on it's just me. Please?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No, I really can't. Trust me,
dialog: you're not missing anything.
dialog: 
text: Kirk decides to join her on the couch but then he balks into
text: a little dance of almost sitting. He finally commits to sit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: So you've never played in front of
dialog: anyone?
dialog: 
dialog: 48.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Nope. Almost did once. A talent
dialog: show in high school. I just sat up
dialog: there drenched in sweat. I really
dialog: thought I could do it but then I
dialog: made my big mistake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Let me guess. You looked at the
dialog: audience.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Yep. All these eyes on me. I'm
text: shaking, my head is spinning, I'm
dialog: trying to remember if I even play
dialog: the piano... and then, I puked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Right there on the stage?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
text: INTO the piano actually.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Shut up! You're lying! Why would
dialog: you do that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: It was a reflex. I was trying not
text: to barf on the floor. Turns out
dialog: it's a lot easier to clean puke off
text: a stage than out of a baby grand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Yeah, that has to be a real bitch.
dialog: Oh, I shouldn't be laughing. You
dialog: poor thing.
dialog: 
text: Molly brushes his hair back with her hand. Kirk is frozen
text: with fear. Molly leans in. Kirk also leans in but not too
text: far. Molly smiles, realizing that it's up to her to make
text: this official. She takes him by the collar, reels him in and
text: kisses him. They make out for a moment. Kirk is near panic
text: but he does his best to keep it together.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Sorry. I'm a little cotton-mouthed.
dialog: I'm going to get a glass of water.
dialog: How 'bout for you? Water? A nice
dialog: glass of, you know...water?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Yeah. That sounds good.
dialog: 
dialog: 49.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Kirk steps away from her and disappears into...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT KITCHEN
dialog: 
text: He pours a glass of water. He's about to return when he sees
text: his reflection in the window. The boner under his khakis is
text: not subtle. He looks down and starts to panic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Um... You want anything to eat?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY (O.S.)
dialog: No thanks.
dialog: 
text: Kirk opens the fridge and thrusts his pelvis in. He takes a
text: few deep, calming breaths. He closes the fridge - still at
text: full alert. Kirk searches the kitchen, his panic building.
text: He grabs a Time Magazine. He flips through frantically. He
text: turns to a bikini model in an ad, then a naked aboriginal
text: women, then bare breasts in a breast cancer article.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Oh come on!
dialog: 
text: He is sweating like crazy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY (O.S.)
dialog: Can I give you a hand?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No. I got it!
dialog: 
text: Kirk finally flips to a picture of Barbara Bush. He stares
text: at it hard. His boner begins to retreat.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Listen Kirk, I want you to know
dialog: that I would really like to, you
dialog: know, to be with you tonight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK (O.S.)
dialog: Really?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT KITCHEN
dialog: 
text: The boner pops back up. Kirk silently mouths, "MOTHERFUCKER!"
text: at his mischievous little man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY (O.S.)
dialog: Well, sure. But... I just don't
dialog: think I'm ready yet.
dialog: 
dialog: 50.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Kirk's reply is rushed with enthusiastic relief.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Sure! Sure! Yeah! No problem!
dialog: Great! That's...that's great!
dialog: Ice!? You want some ice!?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY (O.S.)
dialog: Sure.
dialog: 
text: Kirk opens the freezer. He puts a few cubes in her water and
text: then grabs a fistful and shoves his hand in his pants.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT
dialog: 
text: Molly gets cozy on the couch and looks even sexier.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I mean, don't get me wrong. I want
dialog: to! Believe me - getting naked and
dialog: crazy sounds fantastic right now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK (O.S.)
dialog: Shit!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Are you okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK (O.S.)
dialog: Yeah, fine.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT KITCHEN
dialog: 
text: Kirk runs the water while he digs under the sink. He finds
text: duct tape. He pulls some tape off the roll. It makes a loud
text: noise that causes Molly to pause and Kirk to tense up. Kirk
text: opens his pants and begins taping down the trouble-spot. He
text: coughs hard to cover each subsequent tug of the tape roll.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY (O.S.)
dialog: I just think we should get to know
dialog: each other first. I'm no prude.
dialog: I mean, I'm pretty generous in bed.
dialog: Once I trust a person, I like to
dialog: experiment and get pretty wild.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Oh, dear God.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY (O.S.)
dialog: But, I just need to feel safe
dialog: first.
dialog: 
dialog: 51.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Kirk finishes taping up, zips his pants and checks his
text: profile in the reflection from the window.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT
dialog: 
text: Kirk returns with two glasses of water and no visible boner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Hey. I'm totally fine with that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: You're the best.
dialog: 
text: Kirk gives an "aw-shucks" head tilt. Molly stands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, well, I'd better go then.
dialog: 
text: They walk to the door. Molly leans in and they kiss a few
text: moments more. Kirk winces as the tape is getting a little
text: snug. She drops her keys and then goes down on one knee to
text: retrieve them. Suddenly she starts coughing. She puts her
text: fist over her mouth.
dialog: 
text: Kirk's POV: As her head and fist bob in front of his crotch.
dialog: 
text: Kirk winces again. She hears the tape start to give way.
text: She looks up, slightly confused. Kirk looks around as though
text: he's looking for the source of the sound. Molly stands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY (CONT'D)
dialog: I had a really nice time. I'll
dialog: call you tomorrow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Great!
dialog: 
text: Kirk opens the door for Molly.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. KIRK'S APARTMENT
dialog: 
text: As Molly exits, she gives him one last kiss. Two studly male
text: college students are playing foosball on their patio. They
text: stop when one points out the hottie who's kissing Kirk.
text: Molly trots off.
dialog: 
scene_heading: COLLEGE STUDENT #1
dialog: Damn, man! That chick is fine!
dialog: 
text: Kirk returns a cool "whassup" nod to the guys.
dialog: 
scene_heading: COLLEGE STUDENT #2
dialog: All right Mr. Kettner!
dialog: 
dialog: 52.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: COLLEGE STUDENT #1
dialog: You wanna play some foos!?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No thanks fellas.
dialog: 
text: Kirk beams from the attention as he goes back inside.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT
dialog: 
text: He drifts over to his piano and sits down. The joy of what
text: has just happened is plastered on his face. He launches into
text: a furiously happy Jerry Lee Lewis style romp. Soon a
text: neighbor is pounding on the wall. Kirk stops playing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Sorry, Mrs. Neusbaum!
dialog: 
text: Kirk continues his celebration, dancing around the apartment.
text: He picks up the picture of Marnie and speaks to it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK (CONT'D)
dialog: Ron seems like a swell guy. I love
dialog: Pizza Hut. What? Who's this?
dialog: Why, this is my girlfriend, Molly.
dialog: Oh, don't be that way. Oh, there,
dialog: there, now. Here's a tissue.
dialog: 
text: He drops the picture and continues the dance.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Kirk lies in bed staring at the ceiling fan. The smile
text: continues as he drifts off to sleep. Time lapses as Kirk
text: sleeps and the sun comes up. Still smiling, his eyes open
text: like a shot and he reaches for his phone - "No Missed Calls."
dialog: 
scene_heading: MONTAGE OVER MUSIC:
dialog: 
text: 1) Kirk gets up and goes into the bathroom. He checks his
text: gut and hairline in the mirror.
dialog: 
text: 2) From under his bed, he pulls out a Total Gym still in the
text: box. It is dusty, unopened and has a ribbon still attached
text: along with a card that reads, "Happy Graduation - Love Mom
text: and Dad." He sits in the living room bewildered as he reads
text: the directions. The parts are spread out all over the floor.
text: He works out on the machine but it soon violently collapses
text: underneath him. He checks his phone. "No Missed Calls."
dialog: 
text: 3) He throws away unhealthy snacks and treats from the
text: cupboards.
dialog: 
dialog: 53.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He opens an untouched box of Healthy Bran and fills a bowl.
text: He watches cartoons as he heaps sugar on the healthy cereal
text: and then checks his phone. "No Missed Calls."
dialog: 
text: 3) He surfs the web. He reads info on the Hair Club For Men
text: site. He moves to Hot_or_Not.com. The first woman is very
text: pretty. He rates her a seven, the next is also pretty and
text: gets another seven, the next girl is very unattractive. Her
text: score is three. Kirk feels bad for her and rates her a ten.
text: He checks his phone. He moves on to "BackDoorAsians.com."
dialog: 
text: 4) Kirk watches a Connery James Bond movie on TV. The lower
text: third reads, "AMC's 24 Hours of Bond." No Missed Calls. The
text: sun is setting and Bond is now Roger Moore - No Missed Calls.
text: Kirk digs a box of Ding Dongs out of the trash and eats them
text: as he watches. It's dark outside and Kirk is in bed watching
text: Timothy Dalton - No Missed Calls. The morning light is
text: creeping in as Pierce Brosnan does the driving and Kirk is
text: still awake looking devastated - No Missed Calls.
dialog: 
text: 5) Kirk is at a convenience store buying milk. He is a mess -
text: tired, unshaven, wearing a frumpy sweatsuit. He passes the
text: magazine rack and something catches his eye. It's a gorgeous
text: picture of Molly on the cover of Phoenix Entrepreneur
text: Magazine. Kirk holds up the magazine and then catches his
text: own reflection in a mirror on a sunglasses rack.
dialog: 
text: 6) Kirk is walking home. Every street sign, billboard and T-
text: shirt he sees reads, "NO MISSED CALLS."
dialog: 
scene_heading: MUSIC FADES OUT
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT BATHROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: He stands in the shower sulking. He hears the phone ring in
text: the next room. He jumps out, grabs a small towel and starts
text: to dry off as he runs into the bedroom. He reaches the
text: charger base but the phone is not there. He stands and
text: listens hard to the ringing. He runs into the living room.
text: Angle on the phone. It's hiding under a pillow on the couch.
text: In the background, Kirk rushes around the room flipping up
text: papers and magazines. The phone keeps ringing and Kirk's
text: panic increases until he finally spots the phone. Kirk dives
text: for it, losing his towel in the process.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Hello!? Hello!?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER (V.O.)
dialog: Took you long enough. What were
dialog: you doing, taking a growler?
dialog: 
text: Kirk notices a woman on the landing outside behind him. She
text: can see his ass through the window. He covers up.
dialog: 
dialog: 54.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Sorry, Mrs. Nuesbaum.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN SHOPPING DISTRICT - DAY
dialog: 
text: Kirk and Stainer come out of a record store and walk past the
text: shops and restaurants. Kirk holds a stack of flyers for
text: Stainer's band. As they walk, Kirk hands flyers to Stainer
text: who posts them on walls and kiosks with a staple hammer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Kirk, it's a simple rule of life.
dialog: Look around. People are pretty
text: evenly matched.
dialog: 
text: Kirk and Stainer look at the couples that stand at the bus
text: stop, sit in the outdoor cafes and walk down the sidewalk.
text: Each couple is fairly closely matched - pretty with pretty,
text: ugly with ugly, heavy with heavy, fit with fit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Yeah, but Stainer, she was the one
dialog: who asked me out. So, why...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: That first night, were you
dialog: intimidated by her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No, I didn't think I had a chance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Exactly. So you were relaxed and
dialog: funny. You were on.
dialog: 
text: Stainer posts several "Wheel in the Sky" flyers on a kiosk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: So I gotta get back to that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: That's just it, Kirky. Now that
dialog: she's opened the door, you can't
dialog: get back to that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: So I'll have to fake it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Forget it. You can't fake that
dialog: far. A broad like her - she'll
text: smell that horseshit a mile away.
dialog: 
dialog: 55.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Kirk and Stainer enter a...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAFE FRONT PATIO
dialog: 
text: ...and take a table on the crowded patio.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Can we get a couple of menus?
dialog: (then to Kirk) You eating?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Maybe just a salad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Dude, one salad ain't going make up
dialog: for thirty years of chili dogs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I know. But I got dinner with my
dialog: folks later.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Fun. Be sure and stab your brother
text: in the eye with a fork for me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Sorry, Eric's not coming tonight.
dialog: 
text: Kirk motions toward a mismatched couple (nerdy guy with
text: knockout girl) who pass Kirk and Stainer's table on their way
text: to the valet stand. Stainer rolls his eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK (CONT'D)
dialog: You know what - this is ridiculous.
dialog: I'm just going to call her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Fuck you are! Put that thing away.
dialog: You do not call her. Don't you get
text: it? Talon is back in town.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No, she broke up with him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: So, you're telling me you were
text: sitting there, a sweating,
text: quivering stutter-bucket and when
dialog: you came back from the can, Molly's
text: hugging a guy who's so good looking
dialog: you'd probably fuck him. What do
dialog: you think she's doing this weekend?
dialog: 
dialog: 56.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: So what am I supposed to do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: What can you do? She hasn't called
dialog: - she's not going to.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: You're probably right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Just count yourself lucky. You got
dialog: to kiss a goddess and you got out
dialog: before she recalibrated your
dialog: hardware. A chick like that can
dialog: raise the bar too high and then
dialog: once she dumps you, nobody else
dialog: measures up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No, you're right. You know what -
dialog: it's good. It's better. I'm
dialog: actually relieved. You should have
dialog: seen this Talon guy. Man! All
dialog: I've been thinking about is having
text: to be naked in front of her. I
dialog: don't need that kind of pressure.
dialog: 
text: The valet pulls a red Ferrari up to the mismatched couple and
text: the nerdy guy opens the door for her. Stainer shakes his
text: head as if to say, "Was there even a doubt?"
dialog: 
text: Kirk's phone is sitting on the table - it rings. Kirk and
text: Stainer can see Molly's name on the caller ID.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Don't do it!
dialog: 
text: The phone rings again. Kirk glances down at the phone.
text: Stainer keeps a stern eye on Kirk. RING! Close on Kirk's
text: eyes turning weak. RING! Close on Stainer's threatening
text: eyes. RING! Kirk gives up and looks away. Stainer's eyes
text: calm. Kirk snatches the phone but Stainer grabs Kirk's
text: wrist, pinning it to the table. RING!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Cut it out!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Let it go!
dialog: 
dialog: 57.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: RING! Kirk reaches for the phone with his other hand but
text: Stainer's free hand intercepts it and these arms flail around
text: like battling snakes. Kirk presses the button to answer the
text: call and, instead, moves his head down to the phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Hello!?... Oh, no problem! Yeah I
dialog: was super busy yesterday anyway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Would you look at yourself?
dialog: 
text: Stainer lets go and Kirk sits up and backs away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Well, I have dinner with my folks
dialog: tonight... Oh, I wouldn't want to
dialog: subject you to them... Okay. If
dialog: you want to. I can pick you up...
dialog: 
text: Kirk gives a confident smile and an "I told you she'd call"
text: nod. Stainer crosses his arms and shakes his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, sure. Well then let me call
dialog: you back in a few minutes and I'll
dialog: give you directions. Alrighty.
dialog: Yeah. Buh-bye.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Well, I guess you just solved that.
dialog: An hour with your family and she'll
dialog: file for a restraining order.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No. Eric's not going to be there.
dialog: It's going to be good. You might
dialog: be wrong about Molly. She might...
dialog: 
text: Stainer spots a round little boy posting a "Lost Puppy" flyer
text: over one of the ten he just posted on the kiosk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: (to the boy)
dialog: Whoa! I don't think so Spanky! A
dialog: little lower!
dialog: 
text: The boy instead posts it over a "Walk For a Cure" poster.

scene_heading: EXT. KIRK'S PARENTS' HOME - EVENING
dialog: 
text: Molly drives up and stops in front of a small home on a
text: quaint residential street.
dialog: 
dialog: 58.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She climbs out of her car, checking the address on a small
text: sheet of paper. She sees Kirk sitting on the front porch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: You found it!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I had good directions!
dialog: 
text: She steps up the front walk toward Kirk, who points to a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I'm sorry. My folks aren't back
dialog: yet. We're locked out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: You don't have a key?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No. My dad's kind of obsessed with

scene_heading: MR. RILEY
dialog: Well, howdy Kirk!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Hey, what do say you take the night
dialog: off and I'll take Noodle around the
dialog: block for you? (to Molly) Are you
dialog: up for a walk?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: That sounds great.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MR. RILEY
dialog: Geeze Kirk, that's mighty nice.
dialog:

speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (baby talk)
dialog: Yes! Always happy to see you,

scene_heading: MR. RILEY
dialog: You're a good boy, Kirk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: It's no trouble at all.
dialog: 
text: Molly and Kirk start down the sidewalk with Noodle. An old

dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Honey!? Are you back in business!?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (To Molly)
dialog: I had a little neighborhood dog-
dialog: walking service when I was a kid .
dialog: (to the woman) No problem, Mrs. D,
dialog: we can take Norton along too!
dialog: 
text: Several soft-faded cuts as Kirk and Molly move through the
text: neighborhood. Soon they have a third dog. Kirk points out
text: landmarks as they talk and laugh. Now they have a fourth
text: dog. Molly takes his arm.
dialog: 
text: The evening light is a bit dimmer as they give Noodle back to
text: Mr. Riley. Kirk turns toward his parents' house. Now
text: there's a car parked in the driveway and a jacked-up, knobby-
text: tired pick-up parked out front. The truck has two bumper
text: stickers ("One Nation Under GOD!" and "No Fat Chicks!")
text: flanking a vanity license plate that reads, "ERIX-TOY."
text: Kirk's shoulders slump at the sight of it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, you know what I'm thinking,
dialog: let's go get Chinese.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: What are you talking about? I want
dialog: to meet your family.
dialog: 
text: They start toward the door. Molly's cell phone rings.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm so sorry. It's Patty. I've

scene_heading: MR. KETTNER

dialog: Kirk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS. KETTNER (O.S.)
dialog: Hi sweetie!
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Close the door, fucknut.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Hey Eric. I thought you were
dialog: hanging drywall tonight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Nah. Fuckin' Leroy fired me again.
dialog: Like that dick never came to work
text: with a little buzz on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Okay, listen, I brought a date
dialog: tonight. I really like her.
dialog: Please don't embarrass me in front
dialog: of her. I'll do anything you want.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I promise I won't mention her
dialog: goiter.
dialog: 
text: Eric and Dad crack up.
dialog: 
text: A flushing sound and then Ron comes out of the bathroom.
text: He's buckling up. Kirk's shoulders drop again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: I did like you said Mr. K.
dialog: 
text: Eric tosses Ron and Mr. Kettner each a beer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Oh, hey Ron. So Marnie's here?
dialog: 
text: Marnie appears in the door of the kitchen. She's holding a
text: corningware pot filled with mashed potatoes.
dialog: 
text: Molly finishes her call. She's up the front steps and Kirk
text: lets her in. Eric, Ron and Mr. Kettner are stunned. Marnie
text: drops the pot and it smashes on the floor in front of her.
dialog: 
dialog: 61.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Kettner and Debbie rush out to see what Marnie is gaping
text: at. Debbie (still pregnant) is immediately threatened by the
text: way Eric is looking at Molly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK (CONT'D)
dialog: Everyone, this is Molly McCall.
dialog: 
text: Kirk's never seen his family so impressed. He can't hide his

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KIRK'S PARENTS' KITCHEN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Kirk, Molly, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Kettner, Marnie, Ron and Debbie sit

text: watching Ron whose eyes are all over Molly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You want another one Dad?
dialog: 
scene_heading: MR. KETTNER
dialog: You read my mind.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. KETTNER
dialog: You two take it easy now. We have
dialog: guests. (THEN) Eric honey, I'm
dialog: sure if you apologize to Leroy,
dialog: he'll take you back.
dialog: 
text: Eric returns to the table with the beers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Nah, fuck him. Anyways, Leroy ain't
dialog: payin' shit ever since he trucked
dialog: in all those spics from Fresno.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Geeze Eric!
dialog: 
text: Ron looks offended and raises a palm to indicate that...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: I got this, Kirk. Eric, before you
dialog: go bad-mouthin' a whole group of
dialog: people, you should know that my
dialog: grandmother on my father's side is
dialog: from Fresno.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Hey, I'm sorry. I didn't know.
dialog: (THEN) So, Molly. What do you do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I'm an event planner.
dialog: 
dialog: 62.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You see? That's using your head.
dialog: That's a business to get into.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Well, thank you Eric.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Book a band, blow up a few balloons
dialog: and people pay out the ass for it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: There's a little more to it than
dialog: that, Eric. Molly handles some big
dialog: events. She's even doing a benefit
dialog: with Billy Joel next month.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
speaker_heading: (PLAYFULLY)
dialog: Actually, Eric's right. Just a few
text: balloons.
dialog: 
text: Molly smiles to reassure Kirk that she can handle herself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: You know, Molly, I'm a business
dialog: owner myself. A little restaurant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: I wouldn't really call it a
dialog: restaurant, Ron.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: We serve food that people eat. So -
dialog: restaurant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARNIE
text: It's a Pizza Hut with no tables.
text: It's a take out place.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: So, Molly, me and Debbie here are
dialog: getting hitched. What do you get
dialog: for a wedding job?
dialog: 
text: Kirk raises his eyebrows into "please-behave-yourself" puppy
text: dog eyes. Eric shoots back an "oh whatever" sneer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Hmmm. Honestly, I don't really do a
dialog: lot of weddings. I specialize more
dialog: in fund-raisers, corporate events,
dialog: that kind of thing.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 63.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Right now I'm working on the annual
dialog: benefit for the Children's Cancer
dialog: Center.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: But you've done weddings.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I've done a few.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: So, what do you get for one?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Dad, could you...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Don't get your panties in a wad,
dialog: Kirk. He's just making
dialog: conversation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Geeze, there are so many factors
dialog: that affect the cost of a wedding.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: We're looking at about two hundred
dialog: people and we're gonna do this
dialog: whole Nascar theme.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I'm getting a kick-ass dress made
text: out of actual checkered flags and
text: Eric is going to be in an orange
text: tux with a big Home Depot logo on
text: the back and Tony Stewart's number
text: 20 on the shoulders.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Oh, how fun!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: So what's the damage for
dialog: supervising something like that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Eric, please.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I'm just talkin' ballpark. I'm
dialog: ain't gonna try and Jew her down.
dialog: 
dialog: 64.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Okay. Before expenses, my base fee
dialog: for a non-charity event is fifteen
dialog: thousand. So, I'd ballpark that
text: somewhere around twenty-five grand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
speaker_heading: (STUNNED)
dialog: Fuck a duck.
dialog: 
text: For a moment everyone is chewing and there is a break in the
text: conversation. Kirk is getting wound up tighter and tighter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC (CONT'D)
dialog: So you're making a comfortable
dialog: living, you seem like you got your
text: head together more or less and
dialog: Christ, look at ya. What the hell
dialog: you doing with numbnuts here?
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. KETTNER
dialog: Eric!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Come on, Ma - we're all thinking it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. KETTNER
dialog: Molly, I'm so sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: No, it's fine. The truth is, Kirk
dialog: and I are just getting to know one
dialog: another but so far, I think he's
dialog: decent, he's funny and... You
dialog: know, when we first met, Kirk asked
dialog: me in all sincerity if I knew how
dialog: to do an oil change.
dialog: 
text: Eric, Ron and Mr. Kettner each let out a quick burst of "yeah
dialog: right" laughter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY (CONT'D)
dialog: I know! And, you're right, I don't
dialog: but... I just love that he asked.
dialog: 
text: A moment passes as they all process this. The women at the
text: table all know exactly what Molly means. The men are simply
dialog: confused.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Funny? Kirk is funny? Tell us a
dialog: joke there Sinbad.
dialog: 
dialog: 65.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. KETTNER
dialog: (to Kirk) Well I hope you can hold
dialog: onto this one pumpkin. (to Molly)
text: When Marnie broke up with him he
dialog: was devastated for months, the poor
dialog: little guy.
dialog: 
text: Marnie looks up, surprised and touched by the comment. Kirk
text: is mortified.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: No shit, when you dump him, he's
dialog: liable to kill himself.
dialog: 
text: Kirk rubs his own head to keep it from exploding. Molly calms
text: him with a hand on his back. This move isn't lost on Marnie.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KIRK'S PARENTS' BATHROOM - LATER
dialog: 
text: Kirk splashes water on his face and then looks for a towel
text: but can't find one. He's forced to use his sleeve. He is a
text: wreck. He takes a deep breath and steps out into...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KIRK'S PARENTS' HOME ENTRY HALL
dialog: 
text: ...to find Marnie at the front door putting her coat on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Are you heading home?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: Got to get home and let Peanut out.
text: (she wipes some lint off of Kirk's
dialog: shirt sleeve.) Kirk, you look
dialog: really good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Thanks. You do too.
dialog: 
text: Marnie smiles a sad smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: Ron! Let's go!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: I'm coming! It was really
dialog: fantastic to meet you Molly. If
dialog: you ever need a pizza...
dialog: 
text: Ron gives Molly a hug that makes Marnie as uncomfortable as
text: it does Molly. He then passes Kirk as he crosses to the
text: front door, carrying a pile of foiled over paper plates.
dialog: 
dialog: 66.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RON (CONT'D)
dialog: Cripes Kirk! Crack a window in

scene_heading: INT. KIRK'S PARENTS' KITCHEN
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Kettner and Molly are cleaning up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Molly, you don't have to do that.

speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: No, It's fine.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. KETTNER
dialog: You let us have some girl time.
dialog: Take these downstairs to your dad.
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KIRK'S PARENTS' BASEMENT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Kirk's father has built a tacky little basement bar decorated
text: with neon beer signs and Eric's old trophies and ribbons.
text: Mr. Kettner and Debbie sit at the bar and smoke as Eric
text: stands behind the bar and serves them cocktails. Kirk comes
text: down the basement stairs and joins them. The hockey game
text: wrap-up highlights are running on a TV mounted above the bar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: So, what was the final score?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You think you're hot shit now? Is
dialog: that it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Look, Eric, you've had a lot to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Don't tell him what to do. (to
dialog: Eric) You're doing fine, baby.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You think you're better than me.
dialog: Say it. Well take a look around,
dialog: Big Slick. (re: trophies) Every
dialog: one of these says Eric. First
dialog: place! First Place! M.V.P.!
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 67.

speaker_heading: ERIC (CONT'D)
dialog: Winner! Winner! You think you're
dialog: the winner now? Well forget it,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
speaker_heading: (STANDING)
dialog: Well, it's been fun.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MR. KETTNER
dialog: Now don't be that way, boy. All
dialog: your big brother is trying to say
dialog: is that we're worried about you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You show up here with that piece of
dialog: ass!? Either you're fucking with
dialog: us or she's fucking with you so
dialog: which is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Look, I know she's a little out of
dialog: my league but...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: A little!? Are you shitting me?
dialog: Alright, alright! I think we can
dialog: all agree that Debbie here is one
dialog: wicked hot box.
dialog: 
text: Debbie smiles and squeezes Eric's hand. Mr. Kettner nods and
text: raises his glass.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: She's um... very attractive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Yeah, and this Molly makes her look
text: like a pig.
dialog: 
text: Debbie lets go of Eric's hand and storms upstairs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC (CONT'D)
dialog: You see? This girl of yours is
dialog: already startin' shit. (Calling
dialog: after Debbie) Come on baby! Kirk
dialog: didn't mean nothing by that!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Look, I don't know what's going on
dialog: either but...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I'm goin' upstairs and gettin' to
dialog: the bottom of this.
dialog: 
dialog: 68.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Eric! No!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I think this gal is messing with my
dialog: little brother and I'm not going to
dialog: sit still for it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Eric! Okay! I know! I'm sure
text: she's just slumming or something
dialog: and it's all going to be over any
dialog: minute but, Jesus Christ! She'll
text: come to her senses without any help
dialog: from you! She's up there with...
dialog: 
text: Kirk turns to point up the stairs. As he glances back, he
text: finds Molly standing on the steps listening and frowning down
text: at him. Before Kirk can get a word out, Molly storms out of
text: the house. Kirk runs upstairs but she's in her car before he
text: can get out the front door. Eric appears behind him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Way to go numbnuts. You should
dialog: have let me handle it.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I know. I'm sorry, man.
dialog: 
text: Kirk hands the bag back to Habib and sends him on his way.
text: Randy, another agent, hands Kirk a note.
dialog:

speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Well, I guess this is it. I'm

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT FOOD COURT

speaker_heading: MARNIE

dialog: 
text: Kirk sits down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Kirk, I think I messed up. I see a

dialog: was thinking that we should
dialog: maybe... get back together. Just
dialog: to try it out, you know?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Wow. I don't know, Marnie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: Why not? Please don't say it's
dialog: because of this Molly person.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No, I think I already screwed that
dialog: up anyway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: Good. I was really worried about
dialog: you with her. She seems like kind
dialog: of a bitch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: What? She is not.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: Well, she acts like she's better
dialog: than everyone with her hybrid car
dialog: and her la-de-da charity work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: She doesn't do that at all, Marnie.
dialog: You're just putting that on her.
dialog: 
dialog: 70.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: Okay, maybe so. See? This is what
dialog: I mean. You never argued with me
dialog: before. You're really growing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: What about Ron?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: If you want to get back together,
dialog: of course, I'll break up with Ron.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: You mean you're still with him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: I'm not going to risk being all
dialog: alone just because you don't know

dialog: Kirk. Deep down, you know where
dialog: you belong.

speaker_heading: KIRK

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: This wasn't my idea. I ain't
dialog: dropping twenty bucks to go in

dialog: 
text: Kirk begrudgingly buys Stainer a ticket.

scene_heading: EXT. AIR SHOW

speaker_heading: STAINER

dialog:

speaker_heading: STAINER (CONT'D)
dialog: Those are the coolest guys in the

speaker_heading: MOLLY

speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Your family I can deal with.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: And for me... For what I said.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Do you really think I'm that
dialog: shallow? You think I need to slum?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
text: No. I don't know what to think.
dialog: You just have to understand that
dialog: this is a new area for me. Believe
dialog: it or not, I don't have gobs of

dialog: 72.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Is that all I am to you?

speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No, but I don't have much

text: This melts Molly a bit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Kirk, this can't work if you put me

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: It's not that I... Okay, look...
dialog: When I was a kid, we played a lot
dialog: of baseball in my neighborhood.
dialog: The worst part was picking teams
dialog: because I was always picked last.
dialog: Every time. Like they couldn't
dialog: start a friggin' game without first
dialog: establishing how much I sucked.
dialog: So, now you come along and make me
dialog: feel like the first pick. But...
dialog: what if I can't hit?
dialog: 
text: Molly softens and smiles.

speaker_heading: MOLLY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Perfect. Okay, I get it - Talon is
dialog: what - your call-sign?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TALON
dialog: No, it's my name.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Then what's your call-sign?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TALON
dialog: Oh, I'd rather not say. It's
dialog: embarrassing. Just something the

dialog: 
text: Talon puts his arm around Kirk and walks him away from the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TALON (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyway listen Kirk, is it fair to
dialog: say that you and Mol are close?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Yeah, I guess.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TALON
dialog: Well, I understand that fellas like
dialog: yourself tend to have uniquely
dialog: candid relationships with the women
dialog: they befriend. Am I right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Fellas like myself?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TALON
dialog: Don't get me wrong. I have no
dialog: problem with your lifestyle. What
dialog: grown men do in the privacy of

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Talon, I'm not...
dialog: 
dialog: 74.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TALON
dialog: Hey, I'm in the Navy. I don't ask

dialog: 
text: Talon looks over his shoulder to confirm they are alone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TALON (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, I don't know what Molly's told
dialog: you about me, but anything bad - I
dialog: deserve. I hurt that girl. I hurt
dialog: one of God's own angels and I've
dialog: regretted it every minute since.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No. She speaks very highly...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TALON
dialog: God as my witness, I WILL make it

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Um... Sure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TALON
dialog: You're the man. Come here.

speaker_heading: TALON (CONT'D)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLUE ANGEL #2
text: Yo! Foot-Long! We scramble in
dialog: ten.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TALON
dialog: Roger!
dialog: 
text: Talon finishes the long hug. He and the other Blue Angels
text: walk off in formation. Stainer rejoins Kirk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: That was Talon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Who? The Blue Angel guy? (cracking

scene_heading: MONTAGE OVER LOUD CATCHY TUNE:
dialog: 
text: 1) Kirk and Molly walk arm in arm through the air show crowd.
text: Kirk's POV as every guy that passes checks her out. Close on
text: Kirk's proud expression. The Blue Angels take flight. Close
text: on the planes as they weave in and out of an intricate
text: formation. A wider shot reveals that their jet trails spell
text: out "MOLLY" inside a heart. Reverse to pan across Molly
text: (worried about Kirk's reaction), Kirk (trying not betray his
text: insecurity) and Stainer (trying to hold back his laughter.)
dialog: 
text: 2) Kirk and Molly in a crowded movie theatre. She squeezes
text: his hand and he smiles back at her. Molly turns back to the
text: screen and Kirk's smile quickly degrades into a dirty look.
text: The shot widens to reveal who Kirk is glaring at - another
text: man (also with a date) sits on Molly's opposite side and
text: stares down at her cleavage. The man looks up to meet Kirk's
text: gaze and smiles back. He offers Kirk a fist-tap behind
text: Molly's head. Annoyed, Kirk doesn't tap back. Molly is
text: oblivious to this exchange.
dialog: 
text: 3) As Molly walks down a city sidewalk at night, Kirk has
text: stopped to tie his shoe. When he trots after her to catch up,
text: he is tackled by two cops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Nice try pervert!
dialog: 
text: Molly spins around, horrified.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP (CONT'D)
dialog: It's okay ma'am. This fat tub of
dialog: shit was following you but we got
dialog: him.
dialog: 
text: Molly angrily grabs Kirk by the arm and frees him from the
text: cop's grasp.
dialog: 
text: 4) Kirk, in his TSA uniform, addresses a group of patients at
text: the Children's Cancer Center. He demonstrates a metal
text: detector wand. Molly sits with the kids who look bored out
text: of their minds. Suddenly, the kids light up and Kirk feels
text: he's making an impression until he realizes that Talon has
text: come up behind him. Talon is dressed in his flight suit and
text: carrying an arm-load of toy jets. The kids excitedly jump up
text: and gather 'round Talon; some even hug him.

speaker_heading: FADE MUSIC
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Dressed up and wearing party hats, Kirk, Stainer, Devon, Jack
text: and about thirty others stand in a small, classy restaurant.
dialog: 
dialog: 76.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The place is decorated with balloons and streamers. A huge
text: banner reads, "HAPPY BIRTHDAY KATIE!"
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Seriously, what's with the banner?
dialog: She's blind, right? Seems like
dialog: they could have saved a few bucks
dialog: there.
dialog: 
text: Patty runs in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: Here they come! Everybody hide!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Is that really necessary?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Stainer! Just hide.
dialog: 
text: They hide. Molly leads her sister, KATIE, into the
text: restaurant. "Surprise!" Molly hugs Katie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Stainer)
dialog: Still think she's Al Qaeda?
dialog: 
text: Stainer brushes off the comment. Molly waves Kirk over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Katie, I'd like you to meet Kirk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: It's so nice to meet you, I've
dialog: heard great things.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Oh, thank you. Molly raves about
text: her big sister non-stop.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: May I?
dialog: 
text: Katie reaches out to feel Kirk's face. She's a bit perplexed
text: by the result. Two blind teenaged boys approach.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLIND TEEN
dialog: Mrs. McCall?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Robert! Is Jerry with you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Yes, ma'am. Happy Birthday.
dialog: 
dialog: 77.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: It's so nice you came. (to Molly)
dialog: These are two of my star pupils,
dialog: Robert and Jerry. Boys, this is my
dialog: sister, Molly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: It's nice to meet you.
dialog: 
text: They each feel Molly's face and then start elbowing one
text: another like a couple of horny construction workers.
dialog: 
text: A cake is brought in as everyone sings an unrecognizable but
text: uncopyrighted birthday song. Katie blows out her candles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: What's your wish, Katie?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: I wish Kirk would play the piano
dialog: for me.
dialog: 
text: Kirk's face drops. Molly kisses her sister on the forehead
text: as she has obviously coached the response. Immediately Patty
text: is behind Kirk, pushing him. Kirk tries to politely decline
text: but now Katie has him by the hand and is leading him to the
text: piano bench. Everyone applauds and cheers for him to play.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Really. I can barely play.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Come on, Kirk! For my birthday?
dialog: 
text: Kirk is sweating. He reaches for the keys but he is now
text: white as a ghost. Molly watches in suspense, rethinking
text: what she's done. Kirk's hands shake. He moves them around,
text: hunting for a place to begin. The party-goers stare and the
text: room gets quiet. Kirk puts his hand over his mouth as though
dialog: he might vomit.
dialog: 
text: Molly presses play on a CD player behind the bar. Suddenly,
text: a Cheap Trick song kicks in over the restaurant's sound
text: system. Katie jumps up to dance with her friends.
dialog: 
text: Kirk gets up from the piano and tries to laugh it off. Talon
text: appears behind him and puts a hand on his shoulder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TALON
dialog: It's okay Kirk. You'll rock us
dialog: next time right chief?
dialog: 
dialog: 78.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Oh, hey Talon. Thanks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TALON
dialog: I'm glad you're here. I feel
dialog: terrible about our little
dialog: misunderstanding. I don't know
dialog: what had me thinking you were a gay
dialog: fella. Molly tells me you two have
dialog: been seeing each other.
dialog: 
text: Patty passes between them and gives Talon a dirty look.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TALON (CONT'D)
dialog: She's got every right. I'd hate me
dialog: too. (THEN) I want to congratulate
dialog: you, Poncho. You're the better man.
dialog: Now, I'll step aside and truly wish
dialog: you the best of luck. I wouldn't
dialog: wish losing that girl on my worst
dialog: foe. But, make no mistake, you blow
dialog: it and I'll be waiting in wings.
dialog: Love and war, right chief?
dialog: 
text: Talon gives Kirk a respectful military salute. Kirk holds
text: his forced confidence until Talon departs. Once alone,
text: Kirk's poise deflates and he plops down into a chair.
dialog: 
text: The party goes on and Katie opens a small present.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Oh, it's a DVD.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Who's this from?
dialog: 
text: Nobody claims it but Jack and Devon look at Stainer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
text: What? It's closed captioned.
dialog: 
text: Patty and Kirk are sitting and talking at a table that is
text: away from the group. Across the room, Talon raises a glass
text: to them. Patty gives Talon the finger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: What did he do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: Listen, Molly would kill me if she
dialog: knew I was telling you this but I'm
dialog: trying to do you a favor.
dialog: 
dialog: 79.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: Molly has this physical...um issue.
dialog: You know, kind of like a birth
dialog: defect?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Oh, my God.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: It's not a big deal but she's
text: really self-conscious about it.
dialog: Talon and some other guys she's
dialog: dated have been weirded out and
dialog: made her feel like a freak.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: What is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: It's better if she tells you but if
dialog: you can't deal with it, just get
dialog: lost now and don't put her through
dialog: that heartbreak again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No, no. I wouldn't do that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: Good. 'Cause if you do, it'll be
dialog: your last conscious act... (she
dialog: stands) Cake?
dialog: 
text: Patty heads off to get some cake. Kirk sits, considering
text: this information. He looks at Molly. She is wearing a small
text: black dress. She looks perfect in every way. Kirk crosses
text: the room and walks out to the...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RESTAURANT FRONT SIDEWALK
dialog: 
text: He throws his hands up in the air and does a happy dance
text: similar to the one he had done after their first kiss.
dialog: 
text: Stainer, Devon and Jack are around the corner as Stainer and
text: Jack are smoking a bowl. Devon hears Kirk's celebration and
text: peers around the corner. He waves the others over. The guys
text: come around the front to join Kirk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Dude?

speaker_heading: KIRK (CONT'D)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEVON
dialog: Excuse me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: That's terrible.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No. That's awesome! Don't you get
dialog: it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEVON
dialog: Ahhhh No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER
dialog: Sure, I get it. She needs a good
dialog: guy like Kirky 'cause the guys she
dialog: dates can't handle it, right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: It sent Talon packing.
dialog: 
text: Kirk and Stainer high five. Jack and Devon look disturbed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEVON
dialog: Well, what's wrong with her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I don't know yet. Patty just said
dialog: she had a physical issue.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEVON
dialog: Well that could be anything. Did
dialog: she say it was a birth defect?
dialog: 
dialog: 81.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: She said it was, "something like a
dialog: birth defect."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What if it's something really bad?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I hope it is. I hope it's
dialog: something that would make most guys
text: run screaming. It won't matter to
dialog: me. I love her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: That's cool that you love her but
dialog: it's pretty fucked up to be rooting
text: for a harsh deformity.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEVON
dialog: Oh, wow. What if this is Patty's way
dialog: of telling you that Molly is a man?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAINER

scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - LATER

speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Kirk, I'm so sorry about the piano
dialog: thing. It was stupid of me.

speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No. I know what you were trying to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Well, anyway, thanks for all your

scene_heading: MONTAGE OVER LOVE SONG:
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Kirk opens a bottle of wine. He pours one glass to share.
dialog: 
text: They sit on the couch talking. Kirk is on! He is confident
text: and silly and Molly is eating it up.
dialog: 
text: They are making out passionately on the couch.
dialog: 
text: Molly stands and extends her hand to Kirk. Kirk stands and
text: his boner is impossible to miss. This time he looks down at
text: it as if to say, "How 'bout them apples!?" Molly laughs and
text: leads him into the bedroom.
dialog: 
text: Kirk sits on the bed and Molly goes into the bathroom. He
text: lights a candle. He is now in a normal state of nervousness
text: but nothing like he had been before. He pulls out a stick of
text: gum. He chews it quickly and spits it out.
dialog: 
text: Kirk lies down and then sits up and then repeats this. He
text: decides to sit.
dialog: 
text: Molly opens the door. She is wearing sexy ligerie and

speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Hey, take a look at me.
dialog:

dialog: item up for bids is from nine-year-
dialog: old Walter Benegan. And this is
dialog: a... little something that you can
dialog: put your paper clips or do-dads
dialog: in... Oh, who am I kidding, it's an
text: ashtray. (audience laughs) Let's
dialog: start the bidding at one hundred
dialog: dollars.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: One hundred.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: One hundred. Thank you sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Two hundred.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Two hundred to the...
dialog: 
dialog: 103.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN 2
dialog: Two Fifty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN
text: Two seventy five.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Fantastic. Two-seventy-five. Do I
dialog: hear three hundred?
dialog: 
text: No replies. The small boy hangs his head. He was hoping his
text: piece would fetch more. His mother pats him on the head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY (CONT'D)
text: Two Seventy Five going once. Going
dialog: twice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK (O.S.)
dialog: Ten thousand dollars!
dialog: 
text: The small boy looks up, elated. The spotlight searches the
text: room and lands on Kirk near the back. The audience applauds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Kirk? I hope you don't really
dialog: think this is going to...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TALON
dialog: Eleven thousand!
dialog: 
text: Talon stands across the room, crossing his arms in defiance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: What!?
dialog: 
text: Eric bursts in through a door near Kirk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Fifteen Thousand!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TALON
dialog: Fifteen thousand five hundred!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Both of you! This is ridiculous...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Go get him Kirk! It's chump change
dialog: to you now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Twenty Thousand!
dialog: 
dialog: 104.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The crowd applauds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Is that a serious bid?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TALON
dialog: Fifty thousand dollars!
dialog: 
text: Bigger applause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Talon! Please!
dialog: 
text: Eric makes a fist to indicate that it's time for the killing
text: blow. Kirk nods back his agreement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Three million dollars!
dialog: 
text: Eric's eyes go wide. This is not what he had in mind. The
text: crowd erupts into laughter. Talon also laughs off the bid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Kirk, that's your entire
dialog: inheritance.
dialog: 
text: The crowd shifts from laughter into excited chatter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Folks, calm down. I don't want to
dialog: get anyone's hopes up. It's only
dialog: fair that I clarify something to
dialog: the bidder. Kirk, please
dialog: understand that if you commit this
dialog: money, we will all be eternally
dialog: grateful and I think your
dialog: grandmother will be very proud of
dialog: you... But it doesn't change
dialog: anything between you and me.
dialog: 
text: This sets off a volley of whispers among the crowd and puts a
text: smile on Talon's face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY (CONT'D)
dialog: So, again, is this a serious bid?
dialog: 
text: Kirk looks to Molly, then his brother - who is shaking his
text: head NO! He then scans the hopeful expressions on the faces
text: of the kids and their parents. Kirk takes a deep breath.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Three million dollars.
dialog: 
dialog: 105.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You stupid son of a bitch!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Three million going once. Going
dialog: twice. Sold to the man in the
text: Branson Bound sweatshirt.
dialog: 
text: The crowd cheers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMCEE
dialog: Congratulations to little Walter
dialog: whose ashtray has brought in more
dialog: than any piece in our history.
dialog: 
text: The young sculptor beams. The crowd cheers again. Kirk
text: gives a smile and a nod of resignation as he leaves the room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HILTON BAR
dialog: 
text: Kirk and Eric sit at the bar, each nursing a drink. Eric is
text: fuming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You are such a numbnut. I am
dialog: telling you - absolute numbnuttery!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Excuse me. May I use that ashtray?
dialog: 
text: Kirk turns to find that he is sitting next to BILLY JOEL, who
text: is smoking a cigar. Eric passes him the ashtray that Kirk
dialog: just bought.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Sure. Careful with it there,
dialog: Captain Jack. It cost him three
dialog: million bucks.
dialog: 
text: Billy Joel, ashes in the ashtray.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BILLY JOEL
dialog: Yeah, I saw that. Tough break in
dialog: there, my friend. Still, that was
dialog: a hell of a good thing you did for
dialog: those kids.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BILLY JOEL
dialog: Beautiful women huh? What are you
dialog: gonna do?
dialog: 
dialog: 106.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I guess I'm going to go home.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BILLY JOEL
dialog: It's none of my business but I do
dialog: know a thing or two about hooking
dialog: up with women who are out of your
dialog: league. Can I tell you a little
dialog: secret?
dialog: 
text: Kirk and Eric look at one another in disbelief and then at
dialog: Joel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Sure.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BILLY JOEL
dialog: Look, it's not about money, fame or
dialog: power...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Whoa! All due respect there, Big
dialog: Shot. How would you know? You had
dialog: all that shit when you bagged the
dialog: big ones.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BILLY JOEL
dialog: Yeah, but I had all that shit when
dialog: I lost 'em too. It's not enough.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You believe this fuckin' guy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Jesus Christ, Eric! I'm trying to
dialog: get some advice from Billy Joel.
dialog: Do you think you could manage to
dialog: shut the fuck up for two minutes!?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Fine. Geeze. What's up your ass?
dialog: 
scene_heading: BILLY JOEL
dialog: Thank you. Look kid, it's not what
dialog: you can give 'em or even what you
dialog: can give up. It's what your made
dialog: of.
dialog: 
text: Joel places a cocktail in front of Kirk and then clinks his
dialog: own against it.
dialog: 
dialog: 107.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HILTON BALLROOM - LATER
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, please
dialog: welcome The Piano Man! The
dialog: Entertainer! And our foundation's
dialog: greatest champion! Mr. Billy Joel!
dialog: 
text: The crowd cheers as the curtain rises. The crowd's
text: excitement turns to confusion.
dialog: 
text: From the back of the room, Molly notices the crowd's
text: reaction. She turns to see Kirk seated before the huge white
text: grand piano, his hands sweaty and shaking over the keys.
dialog: 
text: Kirk looks at the crowd. Hundreds of confused faces stare
text: back at him.
dialog: 
text: Beehive rushes Patty in a panic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEEHIVE
dialog: Aren't you going to do something
dialog: about this!?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: Lady, he just gave three million
dialog: dollars. He can go up there and
dialog: try to blow himself for all I care.
dialog: 
text: Kirk wrings his hands as they shake harder.
dialog: 
text: Billy Joel stands in the wings and gives Kirk a nod of, "You
dialog: can do it."
dialog: 
text: Molly turns to walk away but notes ring out from the piano
text: and she stops.
dialog: 
text: Kirk plays and sings "Just the Way You Are" - badly. His
text: voice and hands shake but he forges on. The audience is
text: confused, cringing and restless.
dialog: 
text: Someone starts booing. Kirk can't help but glance up to see
text: who it is - it's Eric.
dialog: 
text: When Kirk reaches the instrumental break, he settles in a bit
dialog: - he can actually play.
dialog: 
text: As the last note fades, Kirk leaps up, and runs out into
dialog: the...
dialog: 
dialog: 108.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HILTON BACK ALLEY
dialog: 
text: Kirk bursts out the door and vomits into a dumpster. He
text: falls backwards against the wall and slides down into a
text: sitting position.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY (O.S.)
dialog: You realize that there's a good
dialog: chance this won't work out.
dialog: 
text: Molly steps out into the alley.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY (CONT'D)
dialog: And you could get hurt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: And you're going to have to be
text: naked in front of me at some point.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I can work up to that.
dialog: 
text: Kirk stands up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK (CONT'D)
dialog: So, you and me are...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Three million dollars for kids with
dialog: cancer and you sing to me? I'm not
dialog: made of wood you know.
dialog: 
text: Molly hugs him. The first intro riff of a piano version of
text: "Pressure" kicks in and the crowd inside goes crazy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY (CONT'D)
dialog: But one condition.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Anything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: You have to go brush your teeth
dialog: right now.
dialog: 
text: Talon walks out into the alley, still holding the flowers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TALON
dialog: So, Molly... Can we finish our
dialog: conversation?
dialog: 
dialog: 109.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Kirk takes Molly's hand and leads her past Talon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Sorry Poncho, she's with me.

dialog: 
text: Close on Kirk - looking dapper but sweaty and nervous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PREACHER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
text: Two souls who have come together
dialog: this day in holy matrimony.

dialog: pronounce you husband and wife.
dialog: You may now...
dialog: 
text: A wider shot reveals the NASCAR theme wedding of Eric and
text: Debbie. Kirk stands among the groomsmen. Each are dressed
text: in tuxes that represent the colors, numbers and sponsors of
text: certain drivers. Molly stands among the bridesmaids. Each
text: dressed in a checkered-flag gown. Ron and Marnie are also in
text: the wedding party.
dialog: 
text: Debbie hands her mulatto baby to the preacher so that she and
text: Eric can share a disgusting wide open mouth kiss. Debbie
text: grabs Eric's ass while Eric gropes her breasts.
dialog: 
text: Stainer and Wheel in the Sky kick into "Any Way You Want It"
text: from a bandstand nearby. Patty dances in front of Stainer -

dialog:

text: racing wheel and tire.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WEDDING - STREET
dialog: 
text: The guests throw rice as Eric and Debbie run to a stretch
text: Nascar limo.
dialog: 
dialog: 110.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Eric picks up Debbie and loads her in through the window. He
text: then runs around to the other side and jumps into that
text: window. The limo burns rubber as it peels away.
dialog: 
text: Pan across the guests as they wave goodbye; Devon and his
text: squeaky clean family, Jack and a hot date, Mr. &amp; Mrs.
text: Kettner, Marnie &amp; Ron. Patty and Stainer - making out. Kirk
text: and Molly stand together arm in arm. Kirk holds a ceramic
text: urn, painted with the Las Vegas skyline.
dialog: 
text: Push in on the urn until the skyline becomes real. Push in
text: toward the top of The Stratosphere Casino. Continue pushing
text: in until we are inside the observation deck. Push through
text: the gift shop where the TV is tuned to CNN. As we pass the
text: TV we hear.

dialog: In a press conference held earlier
dialog: today, NASA officials announced
