scene_heading: 1 EXT. RODEO STADIUM - DALLAS - TEXAS - DAY 1
text: Ambient sounds of the CROWD, RODEO, SEX, and a strange
text: RINGING fade in along with IMAGES of...
text: A COWBOY riding a BULL in an enclosed RODEO ring.
text: RON WOODROOF, early 40's, handsome, long sandy hair, denim
text: clad, worn snakeskin boots, dusty, cowboy hat, mirrored
text: aviators, is engaged in wild SEX with a WOMAN. He watches the
text: rodeo through open slats in a BULL STALL as the STEER throws
text: the COWBOY violently thru the air; he lands hard on the dirt.
text: Another WOMAN snorts cocaine and offers some to Ron as he
text: switches over to having SEX with her.
text: The BULL STOMPS the Cowboy with its HOOFS.
text: Ron climaxes -- pleasure and pain seem to come out of him, but
text: we can't hear him, only this strange RINGING.
text: RODEO CLOWNS grab the Cowboy's limp body and drag him out of
text: the ring.
text: Ron catches his breath; something is off.
speaker_heading: RON (V.O.)
dialog: Did ya hear Rock Hudson was a cock
dialog: sucker?
scene_heading: 2 EXT. RODEO STADIUM - LOCKER ROOM - DAY 2
dialog: A Dallas NEWSPAPER folded in half. July. 1985. AIDS. New
text: treatment. In Paris. ROCK HUDSON on the cover. A HAND
text: scribbles numbers over the photo.
speaker_heading: CLINT (V.O.)
dialog: Where'd ya hear that?
dialog: CLINT (32) a greasy hick who's spent the last five months
text: under the hood of a CHEVY, hands RON a WAD of CASH.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: It's called a newspaper. You heard of
dialog: it?
text: Ron smiles, adjusts his cowboy hat as he records some bets.
text: Nearby, BULL FIGHTERS are putting on their clown makeup.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: What a waste. All that fine Hollywood
text: pussy on a guy who smokes his friends.
text: A HAND comes down through the slats holding a ten dollar bill.
scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 2
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: C'mon Rog, this ain't the sandbox.
dialog: Twenty's the minimum.
text: ROG slides another ten down; Ron snatches it.
speaker_heading: ROG
dialog: Who the hell's Rock Hudson?
text: Ron looks at Rog. A beat, then he starts laughing, then
dialog: coughing...
scene_heading: 3 EXT. RODEO STADIUM - BULL STALL - DAY 3
text: ...and coughing as we follow him into the stalls. Ron glad-
text: hands as he goes; it seems everyone knows him but doesn't
text: necessarily like him. He makes his way toward T.J., white
text: trash, pale as winter, who wipes vomit from his chin. As he
text: nervously looks down at the big angry BULL he's about to ride,
text: Ron hands him a pint of tequila.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Calm the nerves, brother. You look
dialog: great.
text: T.J. takes a swig, gives him a look.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: It's your day, I can feel it.
text: T.J. watches as Ron takes a bottle of NYQUIL out of his pocket
text: and downs it... to stop his hacking cough.
speaker_heading: T.J.
dialog: I don't know, Ron.
text: Ron fans the money out for T.J. to see.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Eight seconds and you'll be gettin blown
dialog: by a hundred dollar hooker before you can
dialog: scrape the bullshit off your boots.
text: Ron winks and smiles. T.J. signals the BULLMAN that he's
dialog: ready. And in five, four, three, two, one...
text: THE GATE is up, the BULL is out, the crowd is HOLLERING and
text: T.J.'s back is bending in unnatural ways.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: C'mon! One one thousand, two one
dialog: thousand, three one thousand...
scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 3
text: And T.J. is DOWN.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Ah hen shit!
text: Ron looks to the BLEACHERS. The GAMBLERS are already
text: searching for him.
text: Ron slips out a SIDE ENTRANCE.
scene_heading: 4 EXT. RODEO STADIUM - PARKING LOT - DAY 4
text: Sweating, heart racing, Ron runs across the lot and jumps over
text: fences to escape THE GAMBLERS that are running after him. As
text: they close in, Ron spots a cop, TUCKER, walking towards his
text: patrol car.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Hey, buddy I need you to arrest me.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Fuck off, Woodroof.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Come on, man. I'm serious!
text: Tuck sees the angry mob approaching.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Looks like you got a few pissed off
dialog: customers.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: You gonna cuff me or what?
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Figure it out yourself.
text: And with that, Ron PUNCHES Tucker in the face. The mob of
text: Gamblers are stopped in their tracks.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: You son of a bitch!
text: Tucker PUNCHES Ron in the face twice, then cuffs him. He
text: looks at the mob of Gamblers.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Get the fuck outta here before I arrest
dialog: all of you.
text: Ron smiles through a bloodied mouth.
scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 4
scene_heading: 5 EXT. RON'S TRAILER - DAY 5
text: Tucker's police car pulls up.
speaker_heading: TUCKER (V.O.)
dialog: They're gonna kick the shit out of you
dialog: one day, Woodroof. Maybe worse.
scene_heading: 6 INT. TUCKER'S POLICE CAR - DAY 6
text: Both Ron and Tucker are bleeding and bruised.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Gotta die from somethin'.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Handle your business, huh? Get your
dialog: shit together.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: You're startin' to sound like your
dialog: ol' man. How's he doin' by the way?
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: (beat)
dialog: There's good days and bad.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: (waving him off)
dialog: Ah, he's a tough one.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Though I can't imagine how disappointed
dialog: he must be havin' you for a son.
text: Tucker looks at him, half-smiles.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Get the fuck outta my car.
text: Ron smiles, starts to get out, then stops. Holds his head a
text: moment. We hear the strange RINGING sound again.
speaker_heading: TUCKER (CONT'D)
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: (covers)
dialog: You rattled my fuckin' brain.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: What brain?
scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 5
text: Ron forces a smile, then exits the car. Tucker watches as Ron
text: slowly heads toward his trailer; something seems off. After a
text: few beats, Tucker brushes it off and pulls away.
scene_heading: 7 INT. RON'S TRAILER - DAY 7
text: Books, newspapers, empty beer cans and liquor bottles; on
text: the wall, we may notice a painting of some Texas Wildflowers.
text: Ron stumbles in as the RINGING sound comes back. He stops,
text: steadies himself on a piece of furniture, takes a few steps
text: then collapses, unconscious.
scene_heading: 8 INT. RON'S TRAILER - MORNING 8
text: The first shafts of sunlight fall over Ron, still asleep where
text: he dropped. After a few beats, he stirs, pulls himself on to
text: a chair. "What the fuck?".
scene_heading: 9 EXT. OIL FIELD - DAY 9
text: Lunch time. Already a little drunk, Ron finishes off a pint
text: of whiskey as Clint and a battered T.J. eat sandwiches nearby.
text: Ron starts coughing again as he grabs a packet of cocaine out
text: of his shirt pocket. He slides it across the table to Clint
text: who hands him cash.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: That shit is purer than a preacher
dialog: daughter's pussy.
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: Not after you just coughed your lungs all
text: over it.
speaker_heading: T.J.
dialog: You think anymore 'bout Saudi Arabia?
dialog: They need guys over there.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: What do you wanna go work for a buncha
dialog: sand niggas for?
speaker_heading: T.J.
dialog: They pay five times as much, that's why.
text: Ron raises his eyebrows, not bad.
speaker_heading: T.J.
dialog: I'm signing up.
scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 6
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: They got hot ladies over there?
speaker_heading: T.J.
dialog: It's a Muslim country. You can't fuck
dialog: the women.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Now that takes me out right there.
text: The FOREMAN races over to them.
speaker_heading: FOREMAN
dialog: Woodroof, there's been an accident on
dialog: platform five. They need an electrician
dialog: right away!
scene_heading: 10 EXT. DRILL PLATFORM - DAY - LATER 10
text: A MEXICAN WORKER has his leg caught in the drill. It's
text: severed and he's losing blood fast. Ron walks over.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Dumb spic. How'd you get your leg in
dialog: there?
text: The guy's breath is coming in short fast spurts.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Where's the ambulance?
speaker_heading: FOREMAN
dialog: He's illegal.
text: Ron takes his OWN shirt off, rips it in half, kneels down next
text: to the MEXICAN, wipes some sweat off his brow and ties a
text: makeshift tourniquet around his leg.
text: Ron looks to the Foremen.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Go call `em.
dialog: (the FOREMEN doesn't move)
dialog: Go FUCKING call `em.
text: He walks off to call. Ron turns back to the Mexican.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Alright we're going to get you outta
dialog: there but you gotta stay still until I
dialog: say get the fuck out and then you get the
dialog: fuck out. Comprende?
scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 7
text: The guy nods. Ron walks over to the electrician's box. He's
text: a little DRUNK. He grabs a wire and is about to cut it.
speaker_heading: RON (CONT'D)
dialog: Alright, on the count of three. One,
dialog: two...
text: Ron cuts the wire, an electrical spark shoots out and before
text: he can move back the box blows up in his face. Everything
text: goes black.
speaker_heading: RICK FERRIS (V.O.)
dialog: Azidothymidine, or AZT -- was originally
dialog: developed as a treatment for cancer.
scene_heading: 11 INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 11
text: Barrow Wilkem rep RICK FERRIS, slick, well-dressed, gold
text: Rolex, 40s, stands before DR. NATHAN SEVARD, 50's, arrogant,
text: DR. EVE SAKS, early 30s, sophisticated, and five other
text: PHYSICIANS, 40s-60s, all members of the hospital board.
speaker_heading: RICK FERRIS
dialog: With the onset of HIV, however, we at
dialog: Barrow Wilkem began a trial in which we
dialog: administered AZT to infected lab animals.
dialog: Initial findings suggested increased CD4
dialog: counts, restored T-cell immunity and also
dialog: evidence of inducing weight gain.
speaker_heading: SEVARD
dialog: Isn't it also true that it had some
dialog: concerning side effects in animal tests,
dialog: significantly decreasing the animals red
dialog: and white blood cells?
speaker_heading: RICK FERRIS
dialog: Yes, but its effect on the virus is
dialog: better than anything else that's been
dialog: tested.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (looking into her file)
dialog: In 64, when AZT was developed for cancer
dialog: treatment, it was shelved due to lack of
dialog: anti cancer efficacy and toxicity.
scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 8
speaker_heading: RICK FERRIS
dialog: We believe those problems were dosage
dialog: based.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: So you're conducting another animal
dialog: study?
speaker_heading: RICK FERRIS
dialog: Actually the FDA has given us permission
dialog: to go straight to human trials which is
dialog: what brings me here today. We're
text: conducting a double-blind, placebo-
dialog: controlled randomized trial throughout
dialog: the United States. Dallas Mercy is one
dialog: of the proposed sites.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: How long do you see the study going on?
speaker_heading: RICK FERRIS
dialog: We're hoping to fast track it within a
dialog: year? During which time the hospital and
dialog: its administering physicians will be very
dialog: well compensated for their efforts.
text: Eve notices as Sevard trades looks with Board Member #1.
speaker_heading: RICK FERRIS
dialog: Sadly, the AIDS crisis will only get
dialog: worse before it gets better. And I
dialog: know I speak for everyone at Barrow
dialog: Wilkem when I say getting this drug to
dialog: market is our number one priority. This
dialog: is a unique opportunity. A chance to be
dialog: on the forefront in finding a cure.
text: Eve looks at Ferris and smiles.
scene_heading: 12 INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY 12
text: Dr. Sevard walks down the hallway with Eve.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Does it not drive you just a little bit
dialog: crazy when these guys stand up there
dialog: talking about curing the sick while
dialog: they're flashing gold Rolexes? What do
dialog: they know about sick patients?
speaker_heading: DR. SEVARD
dialog: They're pharma reps, not doctors. And
dialog: like it or not, this is a business.
scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 8A
speaker_heading: DR. SEVARD
dialog: How the hell did they get permission to
dialog: go to human trials?
speaker_heading: DR. SEVARD
dialog: People are desperate. People are dying.
dialog: There is nothing else out there.
text: And with that, a NURSE approaches them with a file, surgical
text: mask and latex gloves.
scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 9
scene_heading: 13 INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - ROOM - DAY 13
text: Ron, head and eyes bandaged, lays on a bed. After a few
text: beats, he peels off the eye bandages, gets up. He opens a
text: cabinet, then a drawer. Finds a bag of sucking CANDY, pops a
text: piece in his mouth, puts some in his pocket. He sees his
text: jacket on the back of the door, searches his pockets for a
text: cigarette. He's about to light one when Dr. Sevard enters
text: with Eve Sakes. Both wear surgical masks and latex gloves.
speaker_heading: DR. SEVARD
dialog: Mr. Woodroof. I'm Dr. Sevard.
text: Ron turns to Eve, flashes a smile.
speaker_heading: DR. SEVARD
dialog: We saw something that concerned us in
dialog: your initial blood work so we ran some
dialog: additional tests.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Blood tests.
text: Ron stops moving and tries to assess the situation. Is he in
dialog: trouble?
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: What kinda blood tests, cause I don't use
dialog: drugs.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: We didn't test you for drugs.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Good, cause that ain't none of yer
dialog: business anyway.
speaker_heading: DR. SEVARD
dialog: You've tested positive for HIV --
text: Ron looks at Dr. Sevard blankly.
speaker_heading: DR. SEVARD
dialog: ...the virus that causes AIDS.
text: Ron freezes. A long beat.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Who you kidding, Rock cock sucking Hudson
dialog: bullshit?!
speaker_heading: DR. SEVARD
dialog: Have you ever used intravenous drugs or
dialog: had any homosexual --
scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 10
text: Ron spits out his CANDY.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Homo? Homo? That's what you said,
dialog: right? Shit. You gotta be kidding me.
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: I ain't no faggot, I don't even know any
dialog: faggots, I'm a rodeo!
text: The room is silent.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Look at me, doc. Come on now, look at
dialog: me. What do you see?
speaker_heading: DR. SEVARD
dialog: Your T-cell count is down to nine, a
dialog: healthy person has five hundred to
dialog: fifteen hundred.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: What the fuck's a three-Cell?!
speaker_heading: DR. SEVARD
dialog: T-cell. Frankly we're surprised you're
dialog: alive.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Well surprise this: you've made a fuckin'
dialog: mistake!
text: Ron looks back and forth from Dr. Saks to Sevard. No mistake.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: You must've mixed my blood with some
dialog: daisy puller or sumptin.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: We ran the blood test several times.
text: Eve hands him some pamphlets and other paper work.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: That's some information on HIV and AIDS
dialog: you may find informative and your test
dialog: results.
text: Ron flips through the papers. Becomes frustrated by
text: terminology he doesn't understand.
speaker_heading: DR. SEVARD
dialog: Mr. Woodroof, we're trying to impress
dialog: upon you the gravity of your situation.
dialog: (MORE)
scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 11
speaker_heading: DR. SEVARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Based on your condition, we estimate that
dialog: you have about thirty days to get your
dialog: affairs in order --
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Thirty days?
text: Ron jumps off the examining table.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: What is this shit?!
text: They don't respond.
text: Ron laughs incredulously and walks towards the door.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: I got a news flash for all y'all, there
dialog: ain't nothin' out there that can kill Ron
dialog: Woodroof in thirty days.
text: Ron looks at the papers, tosses them up in the air and exits.
scene_heading: 14 INT. RON'S TRAILER - NIGHT 14
text: Music BLARES as Ron and T.J. party with two hot girls, KELLY
text: and CRYSTAL, 20s. T.J. cuts a line of coke on a mirror while
text: Ron dances over to the girls with SHOTS of Jack Daniels. They
text: both start kissing, then rubbing up against Ron.
scene_heading: 15 INT. RON'S TRAILER - NIGHT 15
text: T.J. is having sex with Kelly as Ron kisses Crystal; he leans
text: down, snorts what is probably his fiftieth line of coke. He
text: shakes it off, slams some Jack Daniels from the bottle as if
dialog: it was Kool Aid. He's obliterated.
text: As Ron stares off at something, T.J. waves at Crystal to join
text: him and Kelly; as she does, we see what Ron is staring at -- a
speaker_heading: CALENDAR.
dialog: But its days have no numbers. Except one, in blood RED -- 30.
text: Ron snaps out of his hallucination.
scene_heading: 16 INT. RON'S TRAILER - NIGHT 16
text: T.J. sits down next to Ron, takes a rolled up dollar bill and
dialog: does a line of coke.
speaker_heading: T.J.
dialog: Damn doctors cut your balls off?
scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 12
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Shit, you tell `em you got a cold and
dialog: they'll give you two weeks off. You
dialog: should try it.
text: Ron takes the dollar back as T.J. walks to the table to pour
dialog: himself a drink.
speaker_heading: T.J.
dialog: Well, you didn't miss nothin' at work.
dialog: I'd take disability any day.
text: Ron does a line of coke. Sees his reflection in the mirror.
text: Pushes it away.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: I mean I got a stupid cough and they tell
dialog: me I got some HIV virus.
text: T.J. looks at Ron, hears him but doesn't hear him, maybe it
text: doesn't even register he's so wasted.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: (mutters)
dialog: Hell, like I got the AIDS. Damn
dialog: hospital, mixed up my blood samples.
speaker_heading: T.J.
dialog: Man, I went to them doctors once, they
dialog: tell me I had chlamydia, I came back home
dialog: I realized I had crabs.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: S'what I'm saying.
text: T.J. licks some coke off his fingers.
speaker_heading: T.J.
dialog: I heard you get that just by touchin'
dialog: someone. Or that queers get it.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Which is exactly why it's a mistake.
speaker_heading: T.J.
dialog: Well, what if it ain't?
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: You know me, T. You fuckin' serious?
speaker_heading: T.J.
dialog: Damn right I know you, like you was born
dialog: with some kinda pussy addiction.
scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 13
text: Ron smiles at the compliment as T.J. dives into the mirror and
text: inhales the last line of coke.
text: One of the GIRLS walks over.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You said we would be dancin' by nine.
text: T.J. smiles at Ron.
speaker_heading: T.J.
dialog: We should get goin'.
text: T.J. puts on his jacket.
speaker_heading: T.J.
dialog: Let's go girls.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: I'll catch up with you.
speaker_heading: T.J.
dialog: Alright brother, you cool?
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: I'm cool.
speaker_heading: T.J.
dialog: See you there.
text: T.J. and the girls leave.
text: Ron gets up, wasted, and stares out the screen door into the
text: cold dark night, nothing stares back at him.
scene_heading: 17 INT. DALLAS PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY 17
text: Ron is seated in front of a screen that shows a microfiche of
dialog: information on AIDS, HIV and AZT.
text: LATER - DAY: Ron continues reading; the LIBRARIAN looks over
text: as he endures a brief coughing spasm, then he goes back to his
text: work. We PUSH IN on the phrase"...Unprotected sex..."
text: LATER - DAY: Ron continues reading, runs his finger along the
text: words. Stops at "INTRAVENOUS DRUG USE". As he closes his
text: eyes and exhales--
scene_heading: 18 EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT - DREAM / FLASHBACK 18
text: We're on a SNAKE TATOO on the back of a naked girl having wild
text: sex with a younger and heavier Ron, totally wasted, and...
scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 14
text: hypnotized by the tattoo that goes up to her neck and down to
text: her arm -- marked with track marks.
scene_heading: 19 INT. DALLAS PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY 19
text: Ron slams the book shut with rage. He screams out releasing
text: his anger. His voice echoes off the library walls.
scene_heading: 20 INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - RECEPTION AREA - DAY 20
text: Ron impatiently stands at the Triage desk, looking at a NURSE,
text: 40s. He spots a tattooed Hispanic ORDERLY mopping the floor
text: in the hallway. He locks eyes with Ron for a second too long
text: then moves on.
speaker_heading: NURSE FRAZIN
dialog: Dr. Sevard's not on today.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Do I look like I can wait til tomorrow?
speaker_heading: NURSE FRAZIN
dialog: If you'll tell me what the problem is --
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Problem? Which problem you want to hear
dialog: about? My lungs bleeding, my skin
dialog: crawling, the jackhammer in my head...
dialog: hell that's just the beginning of my
dialog: problems sweetheart.
text: Having overheard Ron's rant, Dr. Eve Saks walks over.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Mr. Woodroof?
text: Ron turns around.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: I don't want no nurse. I want a doctor.
dialog: A goddamn doctor! Today! NOW!
text: The Orderly watches Ron and Eve.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Fine. How can I help you?
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Are you fuckin' deaf, lady?
scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 15
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: No. I'm a fucking doctor!
text: Oh? Ron contemplates Eve, slowly breaking into a smile. Eve
text: hears her name called over the speaker system.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: If you want to discuss your list of
dialog: problems, you can meet me in my office in
dialog: twenty minutes.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Twenty minutes?
dialog: (he takes a long look at her)
dialog: I like your style, Doctor.
text: Ron watches her as she walks away.
scene_heading: 21 INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - DR. EVE SAKS' OFFICE - DAY 21
text: Diplomas hang in neat rows. A perfectly ordered desk. Eve
text: meticulously records numbers on a chart.
speaker_heading: RON (O.S.)
dialog: Can you get me AZT?
text: Eve looks up as Ron walks in and sits down.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Barrow Wilkem just released it for
dialog: testing, right? This hospital is one of
dialog: the sites.
text: She nods yes, surprised how well informed he is.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Well can I buy some?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: That isn't how it works. For about a
dialog: year, a group of patients will either get
dialog: the drug or a placebo, it's left up to
dialog: chance, not even the doctors are allowed
dialog: to know.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: You give dyin' people sugar pills?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: It's the only way to know if a drug
dialog: works.
scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 16
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Can you get it for me?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Unfortunately no. But when it's proven
dialog: to work and if you fit the profile, then
dialog: yes.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: So, you're tellin' me I'm as good as a
dialog: horse being sold for dog food?
text: Eve's look says it all. Ron takes out a list.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Okay, what about in Germany, this Dextran
dialog: Sulfate, or in France they got DDC, or AL
dialog: 721 in Israel... I read that one is
dialog: proven to work and it ain't toxic.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: None of those drugs have been approved by
dialog: the FDA.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Screw the FDA, I'm gonna be DOA. Do I
dialog: have to sue this hospital to get me some
dialog: medicine?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Mr. Woodroof, I assure you that would be
dialog: a waste of precious time.
text: Ron takes a moment, eases up.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Call me Ron, will ya?
text: Eve doesn't play his game. She writes something down on a
text: piece of paper.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: There is a support group that meets every
dialog: day at Draddy Auditorium, perhaps you
dialog: could share your feelings and concerns...
text: Ron abruptly stands.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: I'm dying and you're tellin' me to go get
dialog: a hug from a bunch of faggots?
text: Eve watches as Ron backs away.
scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 17
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Good night, good day, and good riddance.
scene_heading: 22 INT. LONESTAR BAR - DAY 22
text: Ron bursts through the door and shouts to the BARTENDER.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Neddie Jay, one shot of Cactus and a
dialog: Rolling Rock back.
text: Ned doesn't move as Ron continues toward a table where T.J.,
text: Clint and three other FRIENDS are sitting.

speaker_heading: T.J.
dialog: C'mon Ron, we don't want no trouble.
text: Ron puts a fake, friendly hand on T.J.'s shoulder who backs

speaker_heading: RICK FERRIS (V.O.)

speaker_heading: RICK FERRIS
dialog: In short, I'm happy to say that help may
dialog: finally be on the way.
text: That is Ron's POV as he listens to Ferris, looking around at
text: the crowd, who are almost exclusively gay MEN. Ron wanders
text: toward a table lined with LITERATURE. An EFFEMINATE MAN

speaker_heading: EFFEMINATE MAN

speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Tooth fairy, if we weren't in a public

text: The Man's eyes go wide as he backs off. Ron turns back to the
text: table, takes a few pamphlets. Titles include: "POPPERS STUDY:
text: POSSIBLE CAUSE OF AIDS"; "AZT SHOWS SIGNS OF PROMISE". Ron
text: drifts toward the front, where the CROWD is getting hostile.
speaker_heading: AUDIENCE MEMBER #1 (O.C.)

scene_heading: 24 INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT 24
text: CLOSE ON -- a line of flickering CANDLES.

text: Ron downs a shooter and grimaces again. He slams the glass
text: down on a table among empty glasses and looks up at the

text: thoughts. Then he looks up and sees something across the
text: room, past the stripper. She tries to get his attention.
speaker_heading: STRIPPER
dialog: If you're not gonna look or buy a dance,

speaker_heading: RON

speaker_heading: RON

scene_heading: 25 EXT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - REAR - NIGHT 25
text: Cowboy boots nervously play with a McDonald's Bag on the

scene_heading: 26 INT. RON'S TRAILER - NIGHT 26

scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 21

scene_heading: 27 EXT. OIL FIELD - DAY 27
text: As Ron pulls up to his jobs site in his battered '73 Lincoln,

text: He pops a pill of AZT and drinks from a bottle of Tequila.
scene_heading: 29 EXT. TRAILER PARK - NIGHT 29
text: A labyrinth of identical trailers. Ron wanders, searching for

text: He stops in front of one and stares at the door where two
text: YOUNG BOYS are seated on the steps, staring back at him.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: The hell you doin' here?

speaker_heading: RAYON

speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Rayon, the whole point of this study is

speaker_heading: RAYON
dialog: Come on, Evie, you know there ain't no

speaker_heading: EVE

speaker_heading: RAYON

scene_heading: 31 EXT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - REAR - DAY 31
text: A steady drizzle. Ron stands out by the dumpster, his boots

speaker_heading: HISPANIC ORDERLY
dialog: There ain't no more, they started

speaker_heading: ORDERLY

speaker_heading: RON
dialog: What the hell is this bullshit?
scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 23
text: Ron takes a swing at the Orderly but misses. Something about

speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Mr. Woodroof?
scene_heading: 32 INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - ROOM - NIGHT 32
text: Ron lays in bed asleep, an I.V. tube hooked up to his arm.
speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)

speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Beautiful.
text: Eve frowns, didn't expect that.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: You're in the hospital.
text: Ron blinks. Clears the fantasy. His eyes scan the room.
speaker_heading: EVE

speaker_heading: RON
dialog: I'm sure that didn't surprise anyone.

speaker_heading: RON

speaker_heading: RON

speaker_heading: RAYON (O.C.)

scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 24
speaker_heading: RAYON
dialog: I'm Rayon.

speaker_heading: RAYON
dialog: Full house. Jacks over threes.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: I'da figured you for queens.
text: Cleaned out, Ron tosses his cards; Rayon scoops up the money.
speaker_heading: RAYON
dialog: Sorry darlin'.
text: As Ron starts to unfold his legs, he suddenly SCREAMS in pain,
text: grabbing his calf. Rayon grabs his leg, presses his fingers
text: deep into the muscle and massages. Ron contorts in pain,
text: grips the side of the bed. Rayon goes deeper.
scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 25
speaker_heading: RAYON
dialog: Breath. Relax.
text: Ron breaths. Finally the pain subsides and Ron is left limp.
speaker_heading: RAYON
dialog: Here, drink some water.
text: Rayon HOLDS the cup so Ron can drink.
speaker_heading: RAYON
dialog: You gotta stay hydrated or your muscles

speaker_heading: RAYON
dialog: You got nice feet.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Jesus Christ, I'm straight, OK!

speaker_heading: RON

scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 27
text: He looks around, eyes wild, heart racing... but there's no one
text: there to hear him. After a beat, he crosses to his car, pops
text: the trunk. Grabs a single-barreled Winchester SHOTGUN lying
text: within it. He checks the CHAMBER, spins the gun, does a few
text: maneuvers, the barrel pointing at his head. He pumps it, then
text: in a flash levels it and BLASTS the lock off his trailer door.
scene_heading: 36 INT. RON'S TRAILER - NIGHT 36
text: Ron enters, and desperately looks around for something,
text: anything to take with him. He finds HIDDEN CASH in a Patsy

scene_heading: 37 EXT. TRAILER PARK - NIGHT 37

speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Have fun, kids. It's all yours.
text: And with that, he pulls away.
scene_heading: 38 INT. RON'S CAR - HIGHWAY - DAY 38

scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 28
text: DR. VASS (50's), fit but tired, shouts in Spanish to a MAN

speaker_heading: DR. VASS

speaker_heading: DR. VASS

speaker_heading: DR. VASS
dialog: Looking to poison yourself?
text: He grabs an empty bottle of pills on the counter. Throws it

speaker_heading: DR. VASS
dialog: That's from the chemical manufacturer who
dialog: makes AZT, Sigma.
text: Ron looks at the bottle labeled with skull and crossbones:
text: HIGHLY TOXIC, NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION.
speaker_heading: DR. VASS
dialog: First thing I tell my patients: you won't
dialog: find that shit here!
text: Ron looks confused. A nearby stack of boxes tumbles over.
text: Dr. Vass shouts to no one in particular.
speaker_heading: VASS
dialog: Who stacked those boxes there?
dialog: (to Ron)
dialog: Check in with a nurse.

dialog: That's what I call a recipe for disaster.
speaker_heading: RON

dialog: Doc, this place is a shit-hole.
speaker_heading: DR. VASS

speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Why? What'd you do?
speaker_heading: DR. VASS
dialog: I didn't play ball.

speaker_heading: DR. VASS
dialog: These drugs you're doing, they're

speaker_heading: RON
dialog: So cocaine gave me pneumonia?
speaker_heading: DR. VASS
dialog: Cocaine made you more susceptible.
dialog: As did AZT.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: I thought AZT's supposed to help me.
speaker_heading: DR. VASS
dialog: The only people AZT helps are the people

speaker_heading: DR. VASS
dialog: This is DDC, it works as an anti viral

dialog: is Peptide T, it's a protein -- totally

text: The GUARDS move to grab Ron.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Get away from me. I got AIDS. I'll spit
dialog: on you.
text: Ron spits on the floor. The guards back off. Dr. Sevard
text: watches slack-jawed as Ron continues to spit. The guards grab
dialog: him...
text: ... as Eve watches Sevard, emotionally charged.
speaker_heading: RON (O.C.)
dialog: You see this? This is harassment. Get
dialog: me my attorney or do I have to be my own
dialog: lawyer too. Own doctor, own lawyer.
scene_heading: 125A EXT. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB HOUSE - DAY 125A
text: Ron slams the car door shut, walks towards the house watching
text: the line of men snaking out the door. He takes them in. Most

scene_heading: 125B INT. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 125B
text: Ron enters as Denise finishes handing out information to three
text: very sick MEN. Denise makes her way over to Ron.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: (re: sick men)
dialog: From Austin. All on AZT. Their

scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 83
speaker_heading: RON

scene_heading: 126 INT. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB HOUSE - RON'S OFFICE - DAY 126

speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Rayon was a drug addict! It wasn't a day

dialog: as a whole!
text: Ron registers. Calms down a bit.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Ron, you stole my prescription pad! So
dialog: don't accuse me of acting irresponsibly!
dialog: Rayon came to the hospital on his own...
scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 83A
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: (cutting her off)
dialog: ... and got carried out in a trash bag

speaker_heading: EVE

scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 84
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Let me ask you something. Let's say I
dialog: have the cure right here in my back
dialog: pocket. I could save everyone today.
text: Eve's expression changes.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: But I don't have no funding and I don't
dialog: have no backing. Now how long is it
dialog: gonna take before the FDA approves it?
text: Ron crosses to the desk, produces a copy of the Lancet Medical
text: Journal Study he got from Dr. Vass, and hands it to her.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Read that and you tell me how wrong is
dialog: too wrong?
scene_heading: 127 INT. EVE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 127
text: Eve walks into her house, opens a drawer, removes a hammer,
text: smashes it down on a nail and misses. She smashes the hammer
text: down again, harder, and again, and again. Her POV: lots of
text: holes in the wall, very far from the nail, and soon hidden by
text: Ron's painting of the Texas Wildflowers. She walks away
text: without straightening it, sits down and starts reading the

speaker_heading: RON (V.O.)

speaker_heading: DAVID WAYNE

dialog: all of our suppliers down, what can I
dialog: tell you?
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: If I don't get it by the end of the week
dialog: I wanna file a lawsuit.
speaker_heading: DAVID WAYNE
dialog: Come on, Ron, we lost the restraining

scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 85
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Well find a place where it's not,

speaker_heading: DR. SEVARD
dialog: We're starting very slowly with a fifth

speaker_heading: EVE

text: At the back of the room, Ron enters, hooked up to an I.V. drip

text: copies of his flyer.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Here you go, please read this.
speaker_heading: RICHARD BARKLEY (O.S.)

text: Everyone turns to look at Ron.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: I'm givin' people information... on this
dialog: trial I'm in, right now. I want everyone
dialog: here to know what's going on.
speaker_heading: RICHARD BARKLEY
dialog: And what is going on?
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Why was Peptide T cut off? A non-toxic
dialog: drug, that I have proof works and that
dialog: according to the National Institute of
dialog: Mental Health, is completely safe.
speaker_heading: RICHARD BARKLEY
dialog: Mr. Woodroof, you are nothing but a
dialog: common drug dealer--
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: I'm a drug dealer? You're the drug
dialog: dealer. The pharmaceutical companies are
dialog: the drug dealers.
text: Ron grabs a bag of jelly beans out of the hands of a person in
text: the audience. Holds them up.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: The yellow number fives, red, green and
dialog: purple dye you put in this here candy
dialog: causes seven kinds a cancer.
text: A SECURITY MAN approaches, Ron walks away from him.
scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 87
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: The aspartame in my diet coke, the
dialog: steroids in my meat, the hormones in my
text: milk, the antibiotics in the chicken.
dialog: Now that's the shit the FDA knows will
dialog: kill you. Yet you're all up there
dialog: worried that some sick people will find
dialog: somethin' without you and y'all won't get

speaker_heading: EVE

scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 88
speaker_heading: RON

speaker_heading: RON
dialog: A nice, warm hug...
dialog: (she accepts it)
dialog: ...and a day of watchin' some bull
dialog: ridin', that's what you need, doctor
dialog: Woodroof's order.
text: She smiles and they both let go, uneasy with the closeness.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Don't you miss a regular life?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Regular? What's that? Doesn't exist.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Yeah, I guess.

dialog: I just want...
text: Ron looks at her.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: What?
text: He takes the can back.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: ... an ice-cold beer at Ruby's. Go

speaker_heading: RON

text: reason, she becomes emotional and decides to straighten it.
scene_heading: 136 INT. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB HOUSE - BATHROOM - EARLY MORNING 136
text: CLOSE ON Ron's box of meds, almost empty. By the look on his
text: face, Ron clearly just woke up. But there is something else.
text: He takes an empty bottle of Peptide T and looks at it,
text: confused. Hears the strange ringing again...
scene_heading: 137 INT. RON'S CAR - DALLAS STREET - DAY 137
text: And that is all we hear as we see Ron driving along the street
text: into the middle of an intersection. Ron stops the car, puts
text: his hands over his ears, and walks out.
scene_heading: 138 EXT. STREET - DALLAS - DAY 138
text: Ron tries to direct traffic, bear foot. People blare their
text: car horns. Others scream out their windows. A POLICEMAN
text: arrives on the scene and approaches Ron.
text: Tucker pulls up and sees Ron, he jumps out of his car.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: I'll take care of this.
text: Tucker steps in. He grabs Ron's arm, makes eye contact.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Ron! You are in the middle of the
dialog: street. Do you understand what I'm
dialog: sayin'?
text: No answer from Ron.
speaker_heading: TUCKER

speaker_heading: TUCKER

speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: I'll be there, man, and don't you fuckin'
dialog: hit me again!
scene_heading: 141 EXT. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB HOUSE - DAY 141
text: A line of customers is out the door as three Dallas Police
text: Cars pull up. As Tucker gets out of the lead car, he is
text: greeted by Richard Barkley and two FDA Agents. They head
text: inside. That's Ron's POV...
scene_heading: 142 INT. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 142
text: ...as he's watching from a window.
text: Eve tends to several buyers club members, I.V.s attached to
text: them, lying on the floor.
text: A NEWS TEAM films the entire thing.
scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 91
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (to the reporter)
dialog: This is Fluconazole. It helps them with

text: Suddenly, the front door OPENS. Police are in the room, guns
text: drawn.
speaker_heading: RICHARD BARKLEY
dialog: No one move. Put your hands in the air.
text: The news camera keeps rolling.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Ronald Woodroof?
text: Ron steps up through the crowd.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: I have a warrant for your arrest, a
dialog: search warrant for the premises, and a
dialog: court order to cease and desist business
dialog: immediately.
text: And with that, Ron allows Tucker to handcuff him. And as he
text: does, the Customers "Boo" and "Hiss" loudly, all caught on by
dialog: the News Crew.
speaker_heading: RICHARD BARKLEY
dialog: Turn off that camera. Now!
text: But the Camera Man doesn't stop filming.
speaker_heading: RICHARD BARKLEY

speaker_heading: RON
dialog: It's the bust of the century! Don't they

text: from the sidewalk. Ron is put in the Squad Car by Tucker.
scene_heading: 144 INT. DALLAS POLICE STATION - HOLDING ROOM - DAY 144
text: David Wayne enters and throws a NEWSPAPER on the table in
text: front of Ron.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Deadly drugs? What the fuck?
speaker_heading: DAVID WAYNE
dialog: They wrote the FDA's story.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: I can't believe it. I tipped those
dialog: assholes off.
speaker_heading: DAVID WAYNE
dialog: Don't worry. I got good news. I got you
dialog: a change of venue for the Peptide T trial
dialog: in San Francisco. And no surprise,
dialog: they're not pressing charges.
speaker_heading: DAVID WAYNE
dialog: Then what the fuck am I doin' here?
speaker_heading: DAVID WAYNE
dialog: They're trying to break you, I don't
dialog: know. Let's get out of here.

scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 92A
scene_heading: 146 INT. COURTROOM - SAN FRANCISCO 146
text: Ron, dressed in a conservative suit, is looking extremely ill.
text: Next to him is David Wayne and two other younger ATTORNEYS.
dialog: On the opposing side are FDA representatives including Richard
text: Barkley and others who we haven't ever seen before. They have
dialog: a team of four attorneys.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: The constitution, specifically the ninth
dialog: amendment, does not state that you have
dialog: the right to be mentally healthy or
dialog: physically healthy. It does state that
dialog: you have a right to chose your own
dialog: medical care but that is interpreted as
dialog: medical care that is approved by the Food
dialog: and Drug Administration.
text: The Judge looks over to the FDA table.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Regarding the FDA, the court is highly
dialog: disturbed by its bullying tactics and
dialog: direct interference with a drug whose own
dialog: agency has found to be non-toxic. The
dialog: FDA was formed to protect people, not
dialog: prevent them from getting help.
text: The Judge sighs.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: The law does not seem to make much common
dialog: sense. If a person has been found to be
dialog: terminally ill they ought to be able to
dialog: take just about any drug they feel will
dialog: help... but that is not the law. Mr.
dialog: Woodroof, there is not a person in this
dialog: courtroom who is not moved to compassion
dialog: by your plight, what is lacking here is
dialog: the legal authority to intervene. I'm
dialog: sorry. This case is hereby dismissed.
text: The Judge bangs the gavel.
text: David Wayne raises in frustration. Ron closes his eyes,
dialog: defeated.
scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 93
scene_heading: 147 INT. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 147
text: Ron, still looking sick, opens the door and is startled by a
text: crowd of people clapping and cheering.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Jesus Mother Mary Fucking Christ!
text: Among the crowd, Ron spots Eve and David Wayne with a smile of
text: victory on their faces. Ron doesn't understand. They walk to
text: him and show him a paper with the FDA logo on it.
dialog: Black.
dialog: Super:
dialog: Following the trial, the FDA in Washington allowed Ron to get
dialog: Peptide T for his own personal use.
text: And as the cheering and clapping grow bigger, we cut to:
scene_heading: 148 EXT. RODEO - DAY 148
text: Ron, 20 pounds heavier, looking healthier, is sitting atop the
text: railing above the stall looking down at the bull. He's got on
text: gloves, hat, pants, and boots, ready to ride. He removes a
text: flask from his pocket and takes a long swig. The BULLHAND and
text: Ron exchange a look. Ron nods, takes a deep breath, swings
text: his legs over the railing, straddles the stall, stays above
text: the animal. The moment Ron's ass hits the leather, the gate
text: is up, the bull is out, and the crowd whoops it up.
text: Rodeo contestant number "43" Ron Woodroof rides the bull, his
text: hands, legs and heels all working together. His "off" hand is
text: held out above him, cutting the air for balance.
text: The bull makes an abrupt change of direction, catches Ron off
text: guard and just when it seems that he's about to be thrown in
text: the air, we hear Eve screaming her guts out as the image
text: freezes on a PERFECT FRAME on this cowboy in action to control
dialog: the beast.
text: The crowd's CHEERS are echoing in the distance, blended with
text: the soft strange ring that we know, that only Ron could hear.
text: And as we zoom in on the image:
text: FADE TO BLACK.
dialog: Ronald Woodroof died on September 12, 1992, seven years after he
dialog: was diagnosed with the HIV virus. He managed to stay alive
dialog: using unapproved drugs and was memorialized by 1000 gay men in
dialog: Dallas, Texas.
scene_heading: Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 93A-95
text: FADE OUT.
dialog: Fluconazole and Alpha Interferon are now FDA approved.
dialog: DDC was approved in 1992 but is no longer used due to its
dialog: highly toxic effects.
dialog: Peptide T remains unapproved but still in studies for
dialog: neurological diseases, like Alzheimer.
dialog: Today, it is had been scientifically proven that HIV is the
dialog: cause of AIDS. Based on this knowledge, great strides have
dialog: been made in treating this infection with anti-HIV medications
dialog: but a cure has yet to be discovered.
dialog: The first studies with AZT as a single drug (monotherapy)
dialog: while showing initial good results did not ultimately prove to
dialog: be a long term solution for HIV treatment.
dialog: By 1996, medical researchers learned that HIV is best treated
text: with a combination cocktail of at least three HIV medications.
dialog: AZT was frequently used as a part of these early combination
dialog: therapies. Today, AZT has been largely replaced by safer, new
dialog: HIV medications. *
