speaker_heading: ALAN TURING (V.0O.)
dialog: Good. This is going to go very

dialog: things. Important things. You’re
dialog: writing some of this down? That’s
dialog: good.
text: INSIDE ALAN’S HOUSE: There's been a break-in, and the house

speaker_heading: ALAN TURING (V.0O.)
dialog: I will not pause, I will not repeat
dialog: myself, and you will not interrupt
dialog: me. If you ask me a question, I
dialog: will ignore it. You think that
dialog: because you’re sitting where you
dialog: are, and I am sitting where I am,
dialog: that you are in control of what is
dialog: about to happen. You’re mistaken. I
dialog: am in control, because I know

dialog: What I will need from you now is a
dialog: commitment. You will listen
dialog: closely, and you will not judge me.
text: And, in the corner: A MACHINE. It’s the size of a dresser,

speaker_heading: ALAN TURING (V.O.)
dialog: When I am finished — when I have

scene_heading: INT. ALAN TURNING’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Detective Nock enters to find the same messy crime scene we
text: just saw. He’s addressed by SERGEANT STAEHL.
scene_heading: SGT. STAEHL
dialog: Bit late, don’t you think?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK
text: The baby. Up all night, hollering
text: and crying. June says it’s collick.
dialog: (cre: the mess)
dialog: What’s all this, then?
scene_heading: SGT. STAEHL
dialog: Turing, Alan. Professor at King’s.
dialog: Seems there’s been a robbery.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK
dialog: What of?
scene_heading: SGT. STAEHL
dialog: That’s just it. Nothing’s missing,
dialog: really.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK
dialog: No, what’s he a professor of?
scene_heading: SGT. STAEHL
dialog: (consulting notes)
dialog: Maths. Or, as he put it, “ordinal
dialog: logic, with a dose of number
dialog: theory.”
dialog: ON NOCK: What on earth does that mean?
text: Staehl shrugs.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK
dialog: What’s he doing in Manchester?
text: Sergeant Staehl shows Nock the MACHINE in the corner.
dialog: ON NOCK: What the hell is that?
scene_heading: SGT. STAEHL
dialog: Something with machines. Project at
dialog: the NPL, I checked, but he won’t
dialog: say what it’s on.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK
dialog: He’s a bit squirrely then, our
dialog: Professor Turing?
scene_heading: SGT. STAEHL
dialog: That’s putting it mildly.
text: Sergeant Staehl motions to the next room, and he follows Nock
dialog: in...
text: ++. Where they find ALAN TURING, 38. He’s the smartest man in
dialog: the room, and he knows it. But he doesn’t really care if you
dialog: do.
text: Turing is VERY CAREFULLY sweeping up a pile of WHITE POWDER.
text: He’s doing it with a PAINTBRUSH, his mouth covered in a
dialog: scarf.
text: He’s totally oblivious to the detectives as they enter.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK
dialog: Professor Turing?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Professor Turing? My name is
text: Detective Nock. Manchester Police.
dialog: Sergeant Staehl here tells me
dialog: you've had a robbery last night.
dialog: (still nothing)
dialog: Professor Turing?
text: Detective Nock steps closer, peering over Turing’s shoulder
text: at the white powder.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK (CONT’D)
dialog: Professor —
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: — I would step back, if I were you.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK
dialog: Pardon me?
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: Step back, and don’t breathe so
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK
dialog: Breathe?
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: You're breathing heavily and you’re
dialog: going to inhale this junk and
dialog: you're going to leave your collicky
dialog: son without a father.
text: Detective Nock stops, and steps back. What in the world?
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING (CONT’D)
dialog: Sound carries in this house.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK
dialog: What is all that?
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: Cyanide. Undiluted. Wouldn’t take
dialog: more than a thimbleful to kill you.
text: Turing finishes sweeping the cyanide into a jar, before
dialog: safely CAPPING IT.
text: Turing stands, removes his scarf, and for the first time
text: takes a look at Detective Nock. Sizes him up.
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING (CONT’D)
dialog: Oh. Disappointing.
text: Detective Knock and Sergeant Staehl exchange a look.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK
dialog: Pardon?
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: I'd hoped for a bit more.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK
dialog: Sergeant Staehl, is it just me, or
dialog: do you get the sense that we’re
dialog: being insulted?
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: (to Nock)
dialog: You lied to your friend here about
dialog: your son, which is just unseemly.
dialog: Collick didn’t keep you up all
dialog: night. Drink did. You’ve bags under
dialog: your eyes the size of strawberries.
dialog: Your topcoat reeks of whiskey.
dialog: You're short of breath after
dialog: walking 30 paces. And I believe
dialog: Manchester United had a match
dialog: yesterday, yes? I could hear the
dialog: shouting from Simpson’s on my way
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK
dialog: (caught)
dialog: ++. We won by four. Would’ve been
dialog: unseemly not to celebrate.
text: Sergeant Staehl SIGHS, embarrassed.
scene_heading: SGT. STAEHL
dialog: You had a break in last night. Your
dialog: neighbor, a Mr. Springborn, called
dialog: to report the noise. Only you say
dialog: there’s nothing missing. Odd. So
dialog: how about it — You tell us what
dialog: happened, and we find the chap who
dialog: did this.
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: Gentlemen, I don’t think you could
dialog: figure out who broke into my house
dialog: if he walked up and spat in your
dialog: face. What I could really use at
text: the moment is not a bobby but a
dialog: good cleaning lady. So unless one
dialog: of you has an apron in your car,
dialog: I'd suggest that you file your
dialog: reports and leave me alone.
text: Staehl is about to say something — and probably something
text: aggressive, by the look of his face — but Nock stops him.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK
dialog: ++. As you say, Professor Turing.
dialog: Best of luck with your cyanide.

speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK
dialog: Curious, isn’t he?
scene_heading: SGT. STAEHL
dialog: Oh, you've a soft spot for the
dialog: bastard ‘cause he called you on
dialog: your drink? Which, while we’re on
dialog: the subject —
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK
dialog: — Seemed a bit forced though,
dialog: didn’t it?
scene_heading: SGT. STAEHL
dialog: Don’t know what you mean.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK
dialog: If you didn’t want a pair of
dialog: bobbies digging around in your

dialog: they don’t. Tell me you don’t think
dialog: this is suspicious.
scene_heading: SGT. STAEHL
dialog: I don’t think this is suspicious.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK

scene_heading: INT/EXT. TRAIN - DAY - LATER
text: Alan Turing walks down the aisle of a train bound for

speaker_heading: ALAN TURING

speaker_heading: COMMANDER DENNISTON
dialog: In my office? She tell you to help
dialog: yourself to a cup of tea while you
dialog: were here?
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: No. She didn’t.
speaker_heading: COMMANDER DENNISTON
dialog: She didn’t tell you what a joke is
dialog: then either, I gather.
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: Was she supposed to?
speaker_heading: COMMANDER DENNISTON
dialog: For Christ’s sake — who are you?
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: Alan Turing.
speaker_heading: COMMANDER DENNISTON

dialog: Turing... Let me see... Oh, Turing.
dialog: The mathematician.
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: Correct.
speaker_heading: COMMANDER DENNISTON
dialog: How ever could I have guessed?
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: You didn’t. It was written on your

speaker_heading: COMMANDER DENNISTON
dialog: ++. King’s College, Cambridge. Says

speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: I’m not sure I can evaluate that,

speaker_heading: COMMANDER DENNISTON
dialog: How old are you, Mr. Turing?
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: COMMANDER DENNISTON
dialog: How old were you when you became a
dialog: fellow at Cambridge?
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: COMMANDER DENNISTON
dialog: And how old were you when you
dialog: published this paper here, that has
dialog: a title I can barely understand,
dialog: which apparently got you this
dialog: fellowship?
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: 23.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: COMMANDER DENNISTON
dialog: And you don’t think that qualifies
dialog: you as a certified prodigy?
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: Rather depends on how old my peers
dialog: were when they did comparable work,
dialog: doesn’t it?
speaker_heading: COMMANDER DENNISTON
dialog: And how old were they?
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: Newton discovered the binomial
dialog: theorem at 22. Einstein published
dialog: four papers that changed the world
dialog: at 26. As far as I can tell I’ve
dialog: barely made par.
speaker_heading: COMMANDER DENNISTON
dialog: You're serious, aren’t you?
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: Would you prefer I make a joke?
speaker_heading: COMMANDER DENNISTON
dialog: Not sure you know what those are.
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: It hardly seems fair that that
dialog: would be a requirement for

speaker_heading: COMMANDER DENNISTON

speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: Oh, I don’t, really.
speaker_heading: COMMANDER DENNISTON
dialog: (suspicious)
dialog: Are you a bleeding pacifist,

speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: I’m agnostic about violence.
speaker_heading: COMMANDER DENNISTON
dialog: But you realize that 600 miles from

speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: Politics is not my area of

speaker_heading: COMMANDER DENNISTON
dialog: I believe you’ve just set a record
dialog: for the shortest job interview in

speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: Mother says that I can be off-

speaker_heading: COMMANDER DENNISTON

dialog: I've rejected for this program?
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: COMMANDER DENNISTON

text: At the mention of this word Denniston looks suddenly serious.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY ("MARGARET")

speaker_heading: ALAN TURING

speaker_heading: COMMANDER DENNISTON

speaker_heading: (MORE )

speaker_heading: ALAN TURING (CONT'D)
dialog: If the Allies broke Enigma — well,
dialog: this would turn into a very short
dialog: war indeed. Of course you’re
dialog: working on it. But you also haven't
dialog: got anywhere. If you had, you
dialog: wouldn’t be hiring cryptographers
dialog: out of University. You need me a
dialog: lot more than I need you. I'd just
dialog: as easily go work for the Germans,
dialog: frankly, but they simply don’t have
dialog: anything this good to work on. Our
dialog: mathematicians aren’t as impressive
dialog: as theirs. With one significant
dialog: exception. I like solving problems,
dialog: Commander. And Enigma is the most
dialog: difficult problem in the world.
speaker_heading: COMMANDER DENNISTON
dialog: Enigma isn’t difficult. It’s
dialog: impossible. The Americans. The

speaker_heading: JOHN CAIRNCROSS
dialog: But we have an Enigma machine.
speaker_heading: COMMANDER DENNISTON
dialog: Yes. Polish intelligence smuggled

speaker_heading: JOHN CAIRNCROSS
dialog: So what’s the problem? Just put the
dialog: intercepted messages back in to
dialog: Enigma and —
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: — It’s not that simple, is it? Just
dialog: having an Enigma machine doesn’t
dialog: help you decode the messages.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: COMMANDER DENNISTON
dialog: Very good, Mr. Turing. To decode a
dialog: message, you need to know the
text: machine’s settings. The Germans
dialog: switch settings every day, promptly
dialog: at midnight. We usually intercept
dialog: our first message around 6am. Which
dialog: gives you exactly 18 hours every

speaker_heading: ALAN TURING (V.0O.)

text: From above, we hear the familiar LAUGHTER OF THE SCHOOLBOYS.
text: REVEAL: The “coffin” is make-shift; the Boys have constructed

speaker_heading: BOY #2
dialog: C’mon don’t be such a kike about

speaker_heading: BOY #3
dialog: Leave him to bloody rot.

speaker_heading: ALAN TURING (V.0O.)

speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: They’re getting worse.
speaker_heading: YOUNG ALAN
dialog: They only beat me up because I’m

speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: No. They beat you up because you’re

speaker_heading: STEWART MENZIES
dialog: And you think they’re qualified for
dialog: Bletchley because they’re good at

speaker_heading: ALAN TURING

dialog: complete the puzzle, at which
dialog: point—
text: a WOMAN enters. Everyone turns to look..
text: Her name is JOAN CLARKE, 20s, a graduate student at Cambridge
text: who’s trying to get as far away from her preacher father as
dialog: possible,
dialog: story.
dialog: and she’s about to become very important to this
speaker_heading: MI-6 AGENT
dialog: Pardon, Ma’am, this room is
dialog: restricted.
speaker_heading: JOAN CLARKE
dialog: Apologies for my tardiness — bus

speaker_heading: MI-6 AGENT
dialog: (to Joan)
dialog: You’re not allowed in here, Ma’am.
speaker_heading: JOAN CLARKE
dialog: I’m only a few minutes late. With

speaker_heading: MI-6 AGENT
dialog: No, ma’am, the secretaries are to
dialog: head upstairs. This room is for the

speaker_heading: ALAN TURING

speaker_heading: JOAN CLARKE
dialog: I am a candidate.
speaker_heading: MI-6 AGENT

speaker_heading: ALAN TURING

dialog: What is going on here?
speaker_heading: JOAN CLARKE
text: There was a crossword in the paper.
dialog: I solved it. I got a letter saying

text: She hands the Agent the LETTER.
speaker_heading: MI-6 AGENT
dialog: Miss, did you really solve this

speaker_heading: JOAN CLARKE

dialog: have solved the puzzle myself? I am
dialog: quite —
speaker_heading: MI-6 AGENT
dialog: — Ma’am I'll have to ask you —
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: — Miss Clarke. I find tardiness
dialog: unacceptable under any
dialog: circumstance. Now take a seat, so

dialog: Joan stares at Alan: Thank you.
speaker_heading: JOAN CLARKE
dialog: Apologies again for being late.

dialog: position I’m qualifying for?
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: Oh for God’s sake — No.
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: JOAN CLARKE
dialog: It’s just that I’ve a pretty decent

dialog: rather not give it up for something
dialog: less interesting.
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: Miss Clarke. You now have the
dialog: distinct honor of having wasted

dialog: As they work:
speaker_heading: STEWART MENZIES
dialog: (whispering to Alan)
dialog: Six minutes? Is that even possible?
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: No. It takes me eight. But this
dialog: test isn’t about crosswords — it’s
dialog: about how you approach solving an
dialog: impossible problem. Do you take the
dialog: whole thing at once? Do you divide
dialog: it into smaller —
text: — Suddenly, Joan sits up. She’s finished. Early.
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: JOAN CLARKE
dialog: Yes.

speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Cryptography is the science of

speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Not secret. That’s the brilliant

speaker_heading: YOUNG ALAN
dialog: (confused)
dialog: How is that different from talking?
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Talking?
speaker_heading: YOUNG ALAN
dialog: When people talk to each other they

dialog: Newspapers say they became

speaker_heading: JOAN CLARKE
dialog: Did you ever notice that the

dialog: travel downwards, as opposed to
dialog: upwards in any other beer? Ever
dialog: wonder why? It’s because the pint
text: glass creates drag on the bubbles
text: along the side; but the center
text: bubbles are free to sprint upwards.
text: Then the rising current in the

dialog: bubbles and... And voila: Guinness.

text: right, and she looks up at me and
dialog: says, “I’m to put it in my mouth?”
dialog: And I say, “yes, you know. The
dialog: French way.” So she pops it in,
text: closes her lips around the thing...
text: And then she starts humming the
dialog: bloody Marseillaise!
text: The men BURST INTO LAUGHTER.
text: Except for Alan, who looks a bit confused.
speaker_heading: PETER HILTON
dialog: (to Alan)
dialog: What about you and Joan? Does she
dialog: do it the French way?
text: Alan looks away, uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: HUGH ALEXANDER

speaker_heading: JOHN CAIRNCROSS
dialog: Because you’re a homosexual?
text: at him, surprised.
speaker_heading: JOHN CAIRNCROSS (CONT'D)
dialog: I suspected. You’re not quite as
dialog: much of an enigma as you think you
dialog: are. Or as much as Enigma is.
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: Should I tell Joan? I’ve had
dialog: affairs. With other men.
speaker_heading: JOHN CAIRNCROSS
dialog: You know, in my admittedly limited
dialog: experience, women tend to be a bit
dialog: touchy about accidentally marrying
dialog: homosexuals. I think perhaps not
dialog: spreading this information around
dialog: might be in your best interest.
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: Having children, a family... I want
dialog: that with her. I do. I just don’t
dialog: know if I can... Pretend...
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: JOHN CAIRNCROSS
dialog: You can’t tell anyone, Alan. It’s
dialog: illegal. And Denniston is looking
dialog: for any excuse he can get to put
dialog: you away.
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: ++. I know.
speaker_heading: JOHN CAIRNCROSS
dialog: This has to stay a secret, or trust
dialog: me, they’ll kill you for it.
dialog: ON ALAN: He knows John is right.
text: As Alan thinks, Joan comes back over and offers him her hand.
speaker_heading: JOAN CLARKE
dialog: Come on, now it’s your turn.

text: CLOSE ON A LETTER: “I LOVE YOU” is written on the paper.
text: REVEAL: Young Alan sits in his dormitory room, ENCRYPTING his
dialog: love letter to Christopher.
text: Slowly, letter by letter, Alan transforms “I LOVE YOU” into
dialog: code...
text: Hearing a commotion, Alan LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW:
text: BOYS are being unloaded from a BUS at the gates, dropped off
dialog: to begin the new spring term.
text: Alan sees them all, excited: Christopher is coming back!
text: He STUFFS HIS ENCRYPTED LETTER IN AN ENVELOPE and RUNS OFF to
scene_heading: EXT. SHERBORNE SCHOOL FOR BOYS - FRONT GATES - MINUTES LATER
text: Alan waits eagerly by the main gate as BOYS STREAM PAST —
text: — Joking, horsing around —

dialog: 75.
dialog: — Until: They’re all gone.

dialog: Well look. Mr. Turing is all alone.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MANCHESTER POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - 1951
text: Alan Turing sits alone in the interrogation room with his

text: Detective Nock enters.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK
dialog: Cup of tea?
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: (eyes closed)
dialog: Thanks, no.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK
dialog: ++. Mr. Turing, may I tell you a
dialog: secret?
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: I’m quite good with those.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK
dialog: I’m here to help you.
text: Suddenly, Alan opens his eyes.
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: (re: being in jail)
dialog: Clearly.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK
dialog: (changing tacks)
dialog: Can machines think?
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: You've read my published work.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK
dialog: What makes you say that?
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: Because I’m sitting in a police
text: station, accused of entreating a
dialog: young man to touch my penis, and
dialog: you’re asking me whether machines
dialog: can think.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK
dialog: Can they? Could machines ever think
dialog: as human beings do?
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: Most people say no.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK
dialog: You're not most people.
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: The problem is that you’re asking a
dialog: stupid question.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK
dialog: I am?
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: Of course machines can’t think “as
text: human beings do.” A machine is
dialog: different from a human being;
dialog: hence, it would think differently.
dialog: The interesting question is, just
dialog: because something thinks
dialog: differently from you, does that
dialog: mean it’s not thinking? We allow
dialog: that humans have such divergences
dialog: from one another. You like
dialog: strawberries. I hate ice-skating.
dialog: You cry at sad films. I’m allergic
dialog: to pollen. What does it mean to
dialog: have different tastes — different
dialog: preferences — other than to say
dialog: that our brains work differently?
dialog: That we think differently from one
dialog: another? And if we can say that
dialog: about each another, why can’t we
dialog: say the same for brains made of
dialog: copper and steel?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK
dialog: That’s... This big paper you
dialog: wrote... What’s it called?
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: “The Imitation Game.”
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK
dialog: Right. That’s what it’s about?
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: (thinking)
dialog: ++. Would you like to play?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK
dialog: Play?
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: The game. It’s a test, of sorts.
dialog: For determining whether something
dialog: is a machine, or a human being.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK
dialog: How do we play?
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: There's a judge, and a subject. The
dialog: judge asks questions, and based on
dialog: the subject’s answers, he
dialog: determines: Who is he speaking
dialog: with? What is he speaking with? All
dialog: you have to do is ask me a
dialog: question.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK
dialog: ++. What did you do during the war?
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: I worked in a radio factory.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NOCK
dialog: What did you really do during the

dialog: ON ALAN: This is going to work. This has to work.
dialog: Suddenly...
text: DING. The chime announces the stroke of midnight.
speaker_heading: HUGH ALEXANDER
dialog: Damn it!
text: Everyone is pissed, frustrated.
text: Alan looks as if he’s about to rip his own hair out: Why
dialog: won’t this damned thing work?
text: As the machine CLACKS on, oblivious, they all walk outside:
scene_heading: EXT. BLETCHLEY PARK - NEAR HUT 11 - CONTINUOUS
text: The team walks across Bletchley together, moving as one
text: through the most highly secret war zone in the world.
text: MORE SECURITY has been added throughout the park, including

text: the team hands over absentmindedly.
speaker_heading: JOHN CAIRNCROSS
dialog: We’re soon out of time. Our
dialog: month...
speaker_heading: PETER HILTON
dialog: So that’s it then. We lost.
speaker_heading: HUGH ALEXANDER
dialog: It does not matter how much we
dialog: improve on it, that machine will
dialog: never be able to check 159 million
dialog: million million possibilities in
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: It’s searching... It’s just... It
dialog: doesn’t know what it’s searching
dialog: for... If only we knew what the
dialog: messages were going to say...
speaker_heading: JOHN CAIRNCROSS
dialog: If we knew what the messages were
dialog: going to say, we wouldn’t have to
dialog: decrypt them at all.
dialog: ON ALAN: Maybe it was always impossible after all.
dialog: 79.
scene_heading: INT. BLETCHLEY PARK - BEER HUT - LATER
text: It’s crowded in the beer hut, even this late at night.

speaker_heading: HELEN

speaker_heading: JOAN CLARKE
dialog: Hugh? Bit of a cad, actually.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: So my type then?
speaker_heading: JOAN CLARKE
dialog: Here, I’1ll introduce you.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: No! Lord, engaged for a fortnight
dialog: and you’ve already forgotten how to
dialog: do this? He’ll come over.
speaker_heading: JOAN CLARKE
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Yes. I smiled at him fifteen

dialog: him since.
scene_heading: ON HUGH, ALAN, JOHN, AND PETER:
text: Hugh is looking at the girls.
speaker_heading: HUGH ALEXANDER
dialog: (re: Helen)
dialog: Who's that, then?
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: Helen? Works with Joan in the
text: WREN’s hut.
speaker_heading: PETER HILTON
dialog: You do have a point about the

speaker_heading: HUGH ALEXANDER
dialog: She wants me to come over.
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: How can you possibly know that?
speaker_heading: HUGH ALEXANDER
dialog: She smiled at me awhile back and
dialog: hasn’t looked again since.
scene_heading: ON JOAN AND HELEN:
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (cre: Hugh’s glances)
dialog: And... Got him.
speaker_heading: JOAN CLARKE
dialog: Is it odd that when I was single
dialog: this game felt tedious, but now it
dialog: seems just dreadfully fun?
text: ON THE BOYS:
speaker_heading: HUGH ALEXANDER
dialog: (ve: Helen’s glances)
dialog: And... Brilliant. She’s in. Alan,
dialog: introduce me.
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: Why me?
speaker_heading: HUGH ALEXANDER
dialog: Because there is nothing like a
dialog: friend’s engagement to make a woman
dialog: want to do something she will later
dialog: regret with the fiancé’s better-
dialog: looking chum.
text: Hugh drags Alan across the pub to Helen and Joan.
scene_heading: ON JOHN AND PETER:

speaker_heading: PETER HILTON
dialog: No bet.
scene_heading: ON HUGH, ALAN, JOAN, AND HELEN:
speaker_heading: HUGH ALEXANDER
dialog: (to the ladies)
dialog: Alan Turing has a theory.
speaker_heading: JOAN CLARKE
dialog: He has many.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: HUGH ALEXANDER
dialog: He believes that the regulations
dialog: against men and women working side-
dialog: by-side are sound, because such
dialog: proximity will necessarily lead to
dialog: romance.
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: No I don’t —
text: Hugh KICKS Alan, who shuts up.
dialog: Hugh looks
dialog: Joan picks
speaker_heading: HUGH ALEXANDER
dialog: — However, I disagree.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: You do?
speaker_heading: HUGH ALEXANDER
dialog: I think that if I were working
dialog: beside a woman all day long, I
dialog: could manage to appreciate her
dialog: abilities and intellect without
text: needing to take her to bed.
dialog: (to Helen)
dialog: Pardon, have we met?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I don’t recall. But let’s assume we
dialog: haven't.
text: at Alan for an introduction: Alan is silent.
dialog: up the slack:
speaker_heading: JOAN CLARKE
dialog: Helen Stewart, Hugh Alexander.
speaker_heading: HUGH ALEXANDER
dialog: So who do you agree with? Alan or
dialog: myself?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Well, Alan, of course.
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: I’m flattered, but this is not
dialog: actually —
text: Now Joan KICKS Alan, who is still very confused.
speaker_heading: HUGH ALEXANDER
dialog: — Rubbish.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I work beside a man every day, and
dialog: I can’t help but have developed a
text: bit of a crush on him.
speaker_heading: HUGH ALEXANDER
dialog: Well who is this man, so I can kick
dialog: his arse?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Oh, it’s been chaste, you've no
dialog: need to worry. We’ve never even
dialog: met. He’s a German.
speaker_heading: HUGH ALEXANDER
dialog: Now I really want to kill him.
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: How do you mean you work alongside
dialog: a German?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Each of us intercepts messages from
text: a specific German radio tower. So
dialog: we've a counterpart on the other
text: side, who’s tip-tapping out the
dialog: messages. Everybody types a touch
dialog: differently; you get to know the
dialog: rhythm of your counterpart. It’s
dialog: strangely intimate. I feel as if we
dialog: know each other. Pity he has a
dialog: girlfriend... But that’s why I
dialog: disagree with you. I’m in love with
dialog: a co-worker, of sorts, even if
dialog: we've never met.
speaker_heading: HUGH ALEXANDER
dialog: I’ll require another pint to tell
dialog: you why you’re wrong.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Let's.
text: Helen and Hugh walk away to the bar...
speaker_heading: JOAN CLARKE
dialog: (to Alan)
dialog: That’s what flirting looks like. In

dialog: Something is wrong...
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: HELEN!!!
text: Everyone in the room turns and stares at him.
text: Joan winces.
text: Helen and Hugh come back over.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Yes, Alan?
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: Why do you think your German
dialog: counterpart has a girlfriend?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Oh, it’s a stupid joke, don’t worry
dialog: about it.
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: Tell me.
speaker_heading: HELEN
text: Each one of his messages begins
dialog: with the same five letters. C-I-L-L-
dialog: Y. So I suspect Cilly must be the
dialog: name of his amore.
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: That’s impossible. The Germans are
dialog: instructed to choose five letters
text: at random to start every message.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Well, this bloke doesn’t.
speaker_heading: HUGH ALEXANDER
dialog: Love’l1l make a man do strange

scene_heading: OF PREVIOUSLY DECRYPTED MESSAGES —

speaker_heading: JOAN CLARKE
dialog: Alan?
text: — Hugh, John, and Peter enter as Alan spreads the messages

speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: What if Christopher doesn’t have to
dialog: search through all the settings?
dialog: What if he only had to search the
dialog: ones that produce the words we

dialog: message?
speaker_heading: HUGH ALEXANDER

speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: Yes! That’s it!
dialog: (looking at message)
text: They send a weather report at 6AM.
dialog: Every day. That means there are

speaker_heading: HUGH ALEXANDER
dialog: “Heil bloody Hitler.”
speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: Heil bloody Hitler.

scene_heading: INT. BLETCHLEY PARK - HUT 11 - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: JOHN CAIRNCROSS

speaker_heading: ALAN TURING

text: They watch the CLACK CLACK CLACK of Christopher as he

text: — They’re nervous, fretting, anxiously awaiting his
dialog: calculations...
text: Finally, Christopher STOPS.
text: Silence, as a SERIES OF ROTORS on the side of Christopher
text: snap into place, displaying a SET OF LETTERS.
speaker_heading: PETER HILTON
dialog: What happened? Did it work?

text: ON THE MAP: It’s the Atlantic Ocean. Blue pins represent the
text: Allied ships, red ones represent the Axis ships.
speaker_heading: HUGH ALEXANDER
dialog: You did it.
dialog: (turns to Alan)
dialog: Bloody hell, you did it. You just

speaker_heading: JOAN CLARKE
dialog: Civilians. Hundreds of them. We can

speaker_heading: JOHN CAIRNCROSS
dialog: And knock out a whole German fleet

speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: (figuring something out)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JOAN CLARKE
dialog: Is there enough time to save them?
speaker_heading: JOHN CAIRNCROSS

speaker_heading: HUGH ALEXANDER (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: PETER HILTON
dialog: We can’t act on every piece of

speaker_heading: JOAN CLARKE

speaker_heading: PETER HILTON

dialog: John. Please. I am begging you.
dialog: Just this once. Just one time. The
dialog: Germans won’t get suspicious just
dialog: because we stopped one attack. It’s
dialog: one time. No one will know. I’m
dialog: asking you. As your friend. If I
dialog: mean anything to you. Please.
dialog: Silence. This is the hardest thing anyone in this room has

speaker_heading: ALAN TURING

speaker_heading: ALAN TURING

speaker_heading: JOAN CLARKE

dialog: Suddenly:
speaker_heading: JOHN CAIRNCROSS (0.S.)
dialog: Peter will come around eventually.

speaker_heading: BIBLE.
text: What’s John going to do? Alan is terrified...
speaker_heading: JOHN CAIRNCROSS (CONT'D)
dialog: Jack, could you give Alan and I

speaker_heading: JOHN CAIRNCROSS (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: STEWART MENZIES

speaker_heading: (MORE )

speaker_heading: ALAN TURING
