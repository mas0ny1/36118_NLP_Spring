scene_heading: EXT. LAUGHTER, COLORADO - DAY
text: Half a dozen abandoned shacks and a boarded up gas station
text: make up the central hub of Laughter, Colorado. She'd be a
dialog: ghost town âcept the ghosts considered her a shithole ages
text: ago and baled. The buck ten for leaded sign gives us an idea
dialog: how long ago this place went dry.
text: Suddenly an old Chevy RIPS around the corner, wheels sending
text: PLUMES of dust skyward.
scene_heading: INT. OLD CHEVY - DAY
text: Three grimy looking fuckers are stuffed into the cab.
text: FUCKING DRIVER looks as though he may piss himself. FUCKING
text: MIDDLE twists around, glares through the back glass and
text: FUCKING PASSENGER white-knuckles a tire iron.
speaker_heading: FUCKING DRIVER
dialog: Goddamned old man!
scene_heading: FUCKING PASSENGER
dialog: I thought he was dead! She said he
dialog: was dead!
speaker_heading: FUCKING MIDDLE
dialog: I don't see him. Just go. I think
dialog: we lost him.
scene_heading: EXT. LAUGHTER - MAIN STREET - DAY
text: They race through the dusty derelict little town, peeling for
text: the main road in the distance when they round a corner --
text: --to face a â70 PLYMOUTH ROADRUNNER, beat to shit, engine
text: screaming. SPEEDING head on. This ain't chicken because
text: these three Fuckers don't even have time to react before:
speaker_heading: MILTON
text: âThe Old Manâ, shock of white hair, drives the Roadrunner,
text: locks the tires and spins the wheel.
text: The Roadrunner fishtails, slides sideways AT THEM!
text: The truck's gonna ram the driver's side. At least it would
speaker_heading: BUT:
text: MILTON AIMS A SHOTGUN through the driver's side window.
text: Fearless. Pissed off. He FIRES!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
text: The shot BLOOMS right at us! Then SLOWS TO NEAR FROZEN -
text: Hanging in mid-air - suspended, like we could touch it:
dialog: TITLE CARD appears--
dialog: "DRIVE ANGRY"
text: --then the shot BURSTS through the title! SHATTERING the
dialog: words right at us!
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: ...EXPLODING into the hood of the Chevy! The hood RIPS up,
text: SLAMS the windshield.
text: Truck CAREENS out of control!
text: Milton GUNS the Roadrunner away from truck...but...
text: KRAACK - The Truck nails the Roadrunner's rear quarter panel.
text: Roadrunner and truck go into a spin. A tornado of dust
text: SWIRLS around the two vehicles.
text: The Roadrunner SPLINTERS into a boarded store front!
text: The Truck HITS a ditch and UPENDS. Flips. SLAMS into the
text: dirt on its roof, wheels SPINNING.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Smoke HISSES from the totalled Roadrunner. Door creeks open.
text: Milton emerges slow and sure. He crosses toward the Chevy.
text: Fucking Passenger rises from behind the truck and rushes
text: Milton, tire iron held high over his head!
text: Milton spins and KUH-FOOM!
dialog: --blows Fucking Passenger's hand clean off! Passenger
text: screams as Milton snatches the iron out of the air and --
speaker_heading: KER-ACK!
text: -- slams it across his face! Passenger drops. Hard.
text: Milton stoops, removes Passenger's wallet, digs the cash out.
scene_heading: OVER MILTON'S SHOULDER
text: Fucking Driver scrambles from behind the wheel, springs to
text: his feet and runs.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
text: Milton spins, BLOWS his knee apart from 20 paces. Driver
text: SCREAMS and face-firsts the cracked pavement.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: As Fucking Middle drags himself from the passenger side. He
text: got the worst of it. Looks like his face went through the
text: windshield. He looks up --
text: -- into the barrel of Milton's shotgun. A beat.
speaker_heading: FUCKING MIDDLE
dialog: I'll never tell you where they've
dialog: taken her...NEVER.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: I know.
text: The EXPLOSION vaporizes what's left of his face.
scene_heading: ON FUCKING DRIVER
text: As he tries to stand but his lower leg dangles from a piece
text: of cartilage. He falls, WRITHES on the ground. He looks up
text: at Milton standing over him.
speaker_heading: FUCKING DRIVER
dialog: You...you took my leg you fuck!
text: Milton presses the shotgun barrel into the man's good knee.
speaker_heading: FUCKING DRIVER
dialog: Wait. Wait!
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Where is she?
speaker_heading: FUCKING DRIVER
dialog: I...I don't...
text: Suddenly Fucking Passenger, flattened by the tire iron, sits
text: up, dazed. Sees Milton. Spots the iron. Goes for it.
text: Milton spins and KAFOOM!
dialog: Blows Fucking Passenger to hell.
speaker_heading: FUCKING DRIVER
dialog: Stillwater! Stillwater Marsh! I
dialog: don't know where exactly. They
dialog: call it Wolf Deer Run, that's all I
dialog: know. I swear!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
text: Milton digs Driver's cell phone out...stares at it for a
text: moment, drops it, finds wallet, takes cash.
speaker_heading: FUCKING DRIVER
dialog: But you're too late. You gotta
dialog: know that. Next full moon she's
dialog: dead. Nothing you can do. She's
dialog: dead and hell will walk the earth--
speaker_heading: WHAM!
text: Milton shoves the barrel of his shotgun into the man's mouth,
text: breaking a couple teeth in the process.
text: Milton hisses, his throat dry, like a man who hasn't quenched
dialog: his thirst in a decade.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: You tell him I'm coming. You got
dialog: that? I'm coming to get her back.
dialog: You tell him. Tell him I'm gonna
dialog: kill every last one of you fuckers.
text: Milton turns on his heels. Walks into the dust and doesn't
dialog: look back.
scene_heading: EXT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAY
text: Black smoke billows from the BBQ of this shithole diner.
text: It's the only building as far as the eye can see. The lot
text: dotted with vehicles past their prime. A muscle bound â67
text: GTO stands out.
scene_heading: INT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAY
text: Covered in a thick layer of cooking grease, this is one of
text: those diners where white trash goes to die. Half a dozen
text: PATRONS sit at bar and booth as a young American Indian
text: couple, MARY and DALE, enter with their children 2, 4 and 7.
text: Two waitresses, PIPER (25) and NORMAJEAN (57) stand at the
text: kitchen pick-up window. Through which we can see the
text: joint's owner, FAT LOU, dripping sweat into a pile of
text: scrambled eggs. Fat Lou is fat. Holy fuck fat.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: So I tell him, I says, âFrank,
dialog: that's it. No more free milk. You
dialog: gonna have to buy the cow you son
dialog: of a bitch.â
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: NORMAJEAN
dialog: But you're not fat, Piper
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Wha? No, NormaJean, âbuy the cow.â
dialog: Marry me? He's got to marry me.
dialog: I'm sayin I cut him off.
speaker_heading: NORMAJEAN
dialog: You cut him off?
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Not just yes but hell yes! No
dialog: tits, no ass. And I told him if I
dialog: see that big ol' dick of his
dialog: anywhere near my face I'm gonna
dialog: bite it in half.
text: Normajean giggles with embarrassment.
speaker_heading: NORMAJEAN
dialog: You said that? How long's it been?
text: Piper frowns.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Well, it's only been two days but
dialog: that's like a decade in horny
dialog: fucker years.
speaker_heading: NORMAJEAN
dialog: So he bought you a diamond?
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: A diamond? God no. If Frank had
dialog: money for a diamond I would have
dialog: jacked his sorry ass ages ago and
dialog: put this shithole life in the rear
dialog: view. But he did get down on his
dialog: knees and ask me to be his bride.
speaker_heading: NORMAJEAN
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Yes way!
text: NormaJean grabs Piper in a great big hug.
speaker_heading: NORMAJEAN
dialog: Oh! Piper!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: I KNOW!
scene_heading: FF-FF-FFUMP!
text: Something yellow peppers them both. The girls look up as --
text: Fat Lou SLAMS two plates of food into the window.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Did...did you just throw scrambled
dialog: eggs at us?
speaker_heading: FAT LOU
dialog: I don't pay you bitches to stand
dialog: around. Now get the fuck back to work!
text: Piper snatches one of the plates.
text: She delivers it to a Patron sitting at the bar, then turns
text: toward the newly arrived customers.
text: The American Indian couple scans a menu...
text: ...and Milton (the old guy from our opening) scans her...he
text: quickly looks down at an unfolded map of Colorado as --
text: NormaJean steps up to Milton.
speaker_heading: NORMAJEAN
dialog: Hello beautiful, coffee?
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: That'd be great. Tell me,
dialog: Stillwater Marsh around here?
speaker_heading: NORMAJEAN
text: (shrugs) Stillwater...doesn't ring
dialog: a bell. I'll get that coffee.
text: But Milton makes eye contact with Mary, the Indian mother.
text: She quickly looks away. She knows something...
text: Milton opens his mouth to speak as--
text: --Piper approaches the American Indian couple.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Hi guys, I'm Piper. Can I bring
dialog: you something to drink?
speaker_heading: MOTHER MARY
dialog: We'll take this.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
text: Mary points to the menu, Piper leans in, reads.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: âShe's a Brickhouseâ breakfast.
text: Ten monster flapjacks for 4.99.
speaker_heading: MOTHER MARY
dialog: And five waters.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Five waters. And what can I get for...
text: Father averts his eyes. He's embarrassed.
speaker_heading: MOTHER MARY
dialog: That's it. Just the pancakes. If
dialog: that's okay?
text: Piper stares at them as if for the first time. Shit...
dialog: they're hungry. And broke.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Oh. Of course. Coming right up.
text: Piper shoots Milton a look as she crosses to the kitchen.
text: Milton rises slightly. He's clearly trying to get Mary's
text: attention. She's ignoring him.
text: Piper calls through the window to Fat Lou.
speaker_heading: PIPER
text: One brickhouse.
text: She turns and stops suddenly. Stares at a pile of muffins
text: kept fresh within a glass cake stand.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Mary can no longer avoid Milton's stare.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Stillwater Marsh? You know it?
text: Dale, the father, keeps his back to Milton as he speaks.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: No. We don't.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: It's important.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: MOTHER MARY
dialog: You're in the wrong state.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Mary!
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: And what state Should I be in?
text: Dale turns, glares at Milton.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Nevada. Catch the 50 and cut across.
dialog: It's a two day drive from here.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: And Wolf Deer Run?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Never heard of it.
text: The 7 year old LITTLE GIRL'S eyes brighten.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: Yes you have daddy. Wolf Deer Run,
dialog: that's where The Smiling Man takes
dialog: the wicked children to see the
dialog: Mother of all things.
text: Mary SHUSHES her Little Girl and pulls her close.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Mother of all things, that sounds
dialog: very interesting.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: Oh it is! The Mother of all things
dialog: bleeds black tears unto those who
speaker_heading: CUT HER--
text: Mother places her hand over her daughter's mouth.
speaker_heading: MOTHER MARY
dialog: It's nothing. Just a story parents
dialog: tell to their children. Like the
dialog: boogey-man or the tooth-fairy.
text: A plate filled with muffins thumps down before them. Piper
text: leans in with three kiddie cups.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: And three milks.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: MOTHER MARY
dialog: But we didn't order--
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: (whispers) --On the house.
text: She winks and moves away...eyeing the kitchen window. She
dialog: doesn't notice...
speaker_heading: MILTON
text: staring at her again. An impressed smirk on his face.
text: Suddenly NormaJean steps in front of him.
speaker_heading: NORMAJEAN
dialog: So, aren't you gonna ask what time
dialog: my shift ends? Full moon tonight.
dialog: I'm always a little ârandy' during
text: full moon.
speaker_heading: MILTON
text: Full moon's three days off.
speaker_heading: NORMAJEAN
dialog: (she touches his hand)
dialog: You sure âbout that, sweetie?
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Pretty sure. (looks outside) Hell
dialog: of a ride out there. Yours?
speaker_heading: NORMAJEAN
dialog: The GTO? I wish.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: (glances at Piper)
dialog: Hers?
speaker_heading: NORMAJEAN
dialog: Sure but if you're lookin' for a
dialog: ride...
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: And would you be gentle?
speaker_heading: NORMAJEAN
dialog: Life's too short for that, sweetie.
scene_heading: INT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - KITCHEN - DAY
text: Piper enters with two dirty plates, scrapes them and drops
text: them into a soapy sink. She turns right into --
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: FAT LOU
text: He glares down at her.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Jesus Lou, back the fuck off.
speaker_heading: FAT LOU
dialog: âOn the houseâ? On the fucking
dialog: house?
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Oh relax. We gotta toss them
dialog: muffins out today anyway.
text: She sidesteps him, exits the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. HIGHWAY 50 - FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAY
text: As Piper crosses toward the bar, Lou grabs her from behind,
text: spins her around.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Get your hand off of me!
text: His fat fingers tighten around her shoulder.
speaker_heading: FAT LOU
dialog: You get over there and you charge
dialog: them for those muff...
text: Piper strikes. Like a snake. Her hand reaches beneath the
text: fat of his belly and vice grips his balls. Hell, we even
text: hear the CRUNCH.
text: Fat Lou GASPS and doubles over allowing Piper to SLAM her
text: forehead into the bridge of his nose!
scene_heading: KER-RACK!
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: I told you, you fat fuck son of a
dialog: bitch, never to touch me again!
text: His nose seeps blood.
speaker_heading: FAT LOU
dialog: Let...go...of...my...
text: She SLAPS him across the face with her free hand.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Shut up.
text: She takes a step backwards, but keeps her hand clamped to his
text: nuts. He has no choice but follow.
text: She pulls him up to the American Indian family.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Tell'em.
speaker_heading: FAT LOU
dialog: Wha...what?
text: We see it in her face. She squeezes. Lou's eyes go
text: wide...flutter...he's about to pass out.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Tell them...the muffins...are on
dialog: the house.
speaker_heading: FAT LOU
text: On. The. House.
text: She lets go. Lou drops to his knees, then timbers to the
text: floor as Piper turns to the family.
text: The children are huddled, terrified against their parents.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: I'm sorry your kids had to see
dialog: that. Put some honey butter on
dialog: those bran muffins and they taste
dialog: an awful lot better.
text: Piper turns and crosses toward the door.
text: NormaJean is pale as she watches her go.
text: Piper brushes past Milton's booth. His cup is there but
text: Milton is gone.
scene_heading: EXT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAY
text: We're close on a car door as it SLAMS.
text: CLOSE ON GLASS PACK EXHAUST PIPES as the car RUMBLES with
text: life. An âI brake for pussyâ bumper sticker stands out.
text: THE BACK GLASS vibrates as MUSIC blares from within.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
scene_heading: INT. GTO - DAY
text: Piper's French manicured hand wraps the floor-mounted gear
text: shift like a cock and SLAMS it into drive.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DAY
text: With Piper behind the wheel the GTO tears onto the highway...
text: ...and blows passed Milton, as he walks west, duffle bag
text: thrown over his shoulder.
scene_heading: INT. GTO - DAY
text: Piper SINGS. She's empowered. Then...
scene_heading: KA-THUNK.
text: She grips the wheel.
text: The RPMS drop.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DAY
text: The GTO pulls off the road...white smoke HISSES from beneath
dialog: the hood.
text: CLOSE ON ENGINE as the hood POPS.
text: Piper waves a hand in front of her face as the smoke devours
text: her. She COUGHS. Stares. It's clear she don't know jack
dialog: shit about engines.
text: FOOTSTEPS. Piper slips the keys between her fingers. Ready.
text: Milton appears through the smoke.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Car trouble?
text: Piper stares. It's the way he said it. Too knowing.
text: Milton glances at the engine.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Oh, that's not so bad. I can fix
dialog: that for you if you like.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: I would. Thank you.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: If you give me a lift.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: I'm only going as far as Blackfoot
text: Falls. The truckstop there.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: And I'd be much obliged.
text: Milton leans in, flicks something then rises and THUMPS the
text: hood shut with a smile.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Shall we?
scene_heading: INT. GTO - DAY
text: Piper behind the wheel focuses on the road. Milton sits in
text: the passenger seat, hugs his duffle bag, glances at Piper.
text: Suddenly Piper turns on him.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Get it straight old man. I ain't
dialog: sleeping with you.
text: Milton chuckles.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Darlin, my days of bedding a gal ten
dialog: minutes after I meet her are over.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Yeah. Well, that's good to hear.
speaker_heading: MILTON
speaker_heading: (TO HIMSELF)
dialog: For now, anyway.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - LAURA'S TRUCK STOP MOTEL - DAY
text: Several big rigs are parked near the truck stop. A few
text: derelict vehicles outside the adjacent run down old motel.
text: Piper's GTO pulls in and parks near the road.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 14.
text: Piper climbs out. Milton rises stiffly and crosses toward
text: her as he tosses the duffle over his shoulder. He offers his
text: hand, gives her a smile.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: âPreciate the ride, ma'am.
text: Milton crosses toward an old Superman style phone booth.
scene_heading: EXT. LAURA'S MOTEL - DAY
text: Piper inserts her key, glances back at Milton.
text: He's in the booth now, his back to her.
text: Piper turns the key and opens the door.
scene_heading: INT. LAURA'S MOTEL - ROOM 9 - DAY
text: First thing we see is MONA'S naked ass and back. Long red

speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Oh Frank, you know how long I've
dialog: wanted to feel you inside me?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Faster.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Oh, you want it faster?
text: Mona thrusts her pelvic the tiniest bit faster.
text: Suddenly Piper's hand clinches a handful of red hair and
text: yanks! Mona SCREAMS in pain, Frank YELPS in fear as Piper
text: drags Mona backwards off the bed.
scene_heading: EXT. LAURA'S MOTEL - DAY
text: Piper drags Mona, KICKING and SCREAMING, into the lot, then
text: drops her and whirls toward the room--
text: -- where Frank struggles, desperate to find his pants.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: What's the matter with you?! You
dialog: psycho bitch from...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 15.
text: Piper spins on Mona, points a finger in warning.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Don't.
text: It shuts Mona up.
text: Piper storms back toward the room.
speaker_heading: HER POV
text: Frank hops with one leg in his jeans. He sees her coming.
text: Although he's a big fella, he looks scared.
text: Suddenly Mona steps in front of Piper and SLAPS her across
dialog: the face!
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Fuck you, Piper, we're in lo--
speaker_heading: WHAM!
dialog: Piper clocks Mona!
text: Mona stands there...dazed. Swaying. Confused.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: What was that? I didn't catch that
dialog: last word.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Oh...I...I said...we're in lo--
speaker_heading: WHAM!
text: This time Mona stumbles backwards and CRASHES into a metal

scene_heading: INT. LAURA'S MOTEL - ROOM 9 - DAY
text: Piper stuffs a gym bag with clothes.
speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: I'm warning you, Frank. Don't come
dialog: near me.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Look, sooner you accept this is
dialog: your fault, the better.
text: Piper stops, turns, stares.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Baby, I can't just turn it off.
dialog: Now you know that. I gotta have
dialog: it. At least once a day. It's in
dialog: the wiring. You did this. You
dialog: made me cheat on you. You're lucky
dialog: I'm not more pissed about it.
text: Piper stares for a moment. It's like she's been sucker
text: punched. Then she zips her bag and crosses to the door.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Piper! Now cut it out. Enough
dialog: with the drama!
scene_heading: INT. HIGHWAY 70 - LAURA'S MOTEL - PHONE BOOTH - DAY
text: Milton watches Piper's room. It's clear the phone to his ear
text: is a fake out.
text: Suddenly a look crosses his face. He jerks around.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: THE GAS STATION ACROSS HIGHWAY 70
text: ...the garage. A grimy looking GREASE MONKEY is staring at

speaker_heading: FRANK (O.S.)
dialog: Piper!
scene_heading: EXT. LAURA'S TRUCK STOP MOTEL - DAY
text: Piper exits, glances at Mona, sprawled out unconscious in the

speaker_heading: ASIAN MAN
dialog: Hey?!

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Baby, Please. Now hold on. Can we

text: Piper keeps walking. Never looks back.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Piper, stop this! You got nowhere

speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: I'll go to San Francisco and stay
dialog: with my cousin.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (Realization) Whoa. You ain't
dialog: taking my car.
text: Piper pulls out the keys, twirls them on her finger.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I said, you ain't taking my car, bitch.
text: Frank grabs her by the shoulder. Piper spins and --
speaker_heading: WHAM!
text: -- punches him in the face. Caught off guard, Frank
text: stumbles, nearly goes down.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Your car?! Who's been making the
dialog: payments you out of work, skanky
dialog: Mona fucking piece of shit?!
text: She drops the gym bag and launches into him. A blur of FISTS
text: and CLAWS. The tears flow. Heartbreak, anger, humiliation.
text: Frank stumble backwards. Tries to block the blows. WHAM!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Stop...
speaker_heading: WHAM!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: ...hitting me!
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 18.
text: She swings but this time Frank lashes out.
speaker_heading: KUH-RACK!
text: He punches her in the face. Hard. She drops to her hands
text: and knees. When she looks up, her teeth are caked in blood.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You're insane, you know that? Look
dialog: what you made me do!
text: She staggers to her feet, sways before him.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Come on, I'll get you some ice--
text: She SPITS blood in his face and SWINGS!
text: He blocks the blow and BACKHANDS her with the force of
text: thunder. She spins and SLAMS into the ground. Doubtful
dialog: she'll get up this time, then --
speaker_heading: QUIET LAUGHTER
text: Frank stares as Piper rolls over.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Frank. Sweetie. I'm gonna tell
dialog: everybody what I caught you doing
dialog: with my pink dildo.
text: Her laughter becomes a hysterical fit.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: That's it.
text: He drops on top of her, his fingers curl into a fist.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You don't wanna fuck me? Fine.
dialog: When I'm done nobody's gonna wanna
dialog: fuck you. Ever.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Go to hell.
text: Frank raises his fist into the air. Then...
speaker_heading: MILTON (O.S.)
dialog: Hey.
text: Frank looks up as a boot catches him under the chin, lifting

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 19.

speaker_heading: FADE UP ON:
scene_heading: EXT. COLORADO PLAINS - DUSK

text: The ACCOUNTANT. Least he sure as shit looks like an

dialog: Friendly even.
text: He loosens his tie, slips his jacket off and tosses it over

speaker_heading: FAT LOU
dialog: What did you call me?

speaker_heading: FAT LOU
dialog: I said, what did you call--
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: --I called you âfat fuck' and we had

speaker_heading: FAT LOU
dialog: Wha-what?
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: I'm looking for someone. An old

text: The Accountant smells the air, embraces it.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: He was here earlier. Traveling

speaker_heading: FAT LOU
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: I'm the Accountant.
speaker_heading: FAT LOU
dialog: That's supposed to mean something
dialog: to me?
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: It will if I add you to the books.
dialog: And if you don't tell me what I
dialog: want to know...
text: NormaJean opens her mouth to speak. Shuts it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

text: The Accountant turns to her, quickly. So quickly she takes a

speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: You had something to say?
speaker_heading: NORMAJEAN
dialog: He was here. Earlier.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: Yes. We've established that.
speaker_heading: NORMAJEAN

speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT

text: Milton is driving. He gazes out the window...up to the sky.
text: Piper looks.
text: The MOON hangs a few days from full.
text: Piper slides over the seat, drags Milton's jacket with her,

speaker_heading: MILTON

speaker_heading: PIPER

speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Roy.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Milton?

speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Thought you were dead.
speaker_heading: MILTON

speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: You planning on staying?

speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: And you'd spend the night here?
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: I'd spend the night here fucking

text: Suddenly Milton twists around, stares toward the bar.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: I...nothing I guess.
text: A large breasted waitress, fuckin' hot for a woman in her
text: fifties, approaches with chips and salsa. Eyes Milton.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Well, hello. I'm Candy. Start you
dialog: off with some drinks?
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Beer.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Same.
text: Candy plops two pens and index cards on the table.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: And I'll need to see your IDs.
text: Piper pulls her license absently and slides it over, begins
text: filling out the card.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Guess it's been awhile since you
dialog: drove that truck through here.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: You want a drink? You gotta be a

speaker_heading: MILTON

text: She tosses his card on the table.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: For you, gorgeous, we'll break the

speaker_heading: PIPER

speaker_heading: MILTON

speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Jeez, Milton, how long's it been?
dialog: Sounds like you used to stick it in
dialog: anything with a crack.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Yeah. Well. I've been distracted.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Suit yourself. But nobody reaches
dialog: the end and says, âWish I hadn't
dialog: fucked so much.â
text: Milton's gaze returns to Candy. Even a man as driven as he
text: needs a reboot sometimes. Candy catches his look, smiles.
text: Piper slides from the booth.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Where are you...?
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: I'm gonna do my nails, take a hot

speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: What about your beer?

speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: You drink it. See you at dawn.
text: But she walks right passed the âMotel Guestsâ door and
text: approaches the Busboy, who's already eyeing her.
text: As she does, our focus settles on a shadowy area at the back
text: of the bar. JONAH KING steps into the light. Ruggedly good
text: looking. He wears a necklace with something bulky hidden
text: beneath his shirt. There's an old scar under his left eye
text: but a scar on this guy simply adds to his fuckabilty factor.
text: He glances at Milton then --
speaker_heading: JONAH KING
dialog: It's Roy isn't it?
text: Roy spins from the bar, smiles a friendly smile.
speaker_heading: ROY

speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: There was an old man, yes?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Wha?
text: The Accountant sniffs the air.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT

speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Fuck should I know where he went?

speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: What kind of car?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You know what, fuck you. You ain't

text: Frank starts to close the door but the Accountant grabs his
text: wrist, twists him around and shoves him into the room!
text: Frank doesn't stumble forward. He flies. Lifted off the

text: wall and bounces into the dresser.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You son of a --
text: Frank staggers to his feet. Dazed. Mouth bleeding. He

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You leave me no choice but to beat

text: The Accountant dodges.
text: Bat SMASHES down on the TV. SPARKS &amp; GLASS fly.
text: The Accountant STOMPS on the bat, SNAPS it in two.
text: SLOMO: The short end rips from Frank's hands, knocks him
text: backwards. The piece spins in the air - for a second, hangs
dialog: there until...
text: The Accountant snatches it, letting his follow-through gather
dialog: momentum.
text: Frank can only watch as the Accountant -
text: HURLS THE JAGGED TIP OF THE BAT RIGHT AT HIM --
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 29.
text: The tip STRIKES Frank in the shoulder with such force, it
text: impales him up to the knob. Drives him backwards where it
text: embeds into the wall!
text: The Accountant grabs the broken barrel end of the bat, tosses
text: it from hand to hand with a loud SLAP of flesh on wood.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: What kind of car?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (dazed) I...what?
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: Your car. What kind is it?
text: Frank stares down at the bat protruding from his shoulder.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Wha...what did you do?
text: The Accountant reaches out and twists the bat. Frank SCREAMS
text: out in pain.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: Answer the question.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: A â67 GTO! Arrgg!
text: The Accountant turns and walks toward the door. Stops to eye
text: a framed photo of Piper and Frank on the dresser.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hey! Just hold on!
text: The Accountant pivots and flings the barrel of the bat.
speaker_heading: FRANK'S POV
text: It's coming right at his face. Frank tries to dodge...twists
dialog: his head...no good.
text: The other end of the broken bat RAMS through his face, PINS

speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: I'm looking for someone. Five-
text: eleven. White hair. Driving a â67
text: GTO. He's traveling with her.
text: He hands Trooper #2 the framed photo.
speaker_heading: TROOPER #2
dialog: Excuse me?
text: The Accountant pulls a shiny, ancient coin, worn from being
text: worried over the years, from his pocket. He tosses it, the
text: coin catching the light, glinting madly. Trooper #2 stares at
text: it. Can't seem to take his eyes off it.
text: Trooper #1's eyes widen as he stares into Frank's room.
speaker_heading: TROOPER #1
dialog: Jesus.
text: He pulls his gun. Points it at the Accountant.
speaker_heading: TROOPER #1
dialog: Keep your hands where I can see them!
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: Troopers, this is your lucky day.
text: Trooper #2 is watching the hypnotic glinting coin.

speaker_heading: TROOPER #2
dialog: I guess...
speaker_heading: TROOPER #1
dialog: Yes, we are...
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: Wasn't actually a question. I can

speaker_heading: TROOPER #1
dialog: That's against protocol...
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: This man is highly dangerous. He

dialog: to end your life.

speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Jesus Christ. You're the best fuck
dialog: I've ever had.
text: Piper crosses to the adjoining room.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Hello? Do you mind?! We're...
text: Candy sits up and suddenly takes in her surroundings. She
text: SCREAMS, wraps herself in a sheet and flees from the room.
scene_heading: PIPER'S POV INTO HER ROOM
text: Man with Axe is lying face down in his own blood. Dead. But
text: it's Busboy who draws Piper's attention. Lying beneath blood
text: drenched white sheets. He never saw it coming.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Aw, hell.
text: Milton, in pants, pulls his shirt on, rolls Man with
text: Shotgun's face with his boot. Reloads the 357.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: I definitely got their attention.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: What. The fuck? You know these people?
text: Milton flings his duffle over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Come on. There are probably more.
scene_heading: EXT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR - FRONT - NIGHT
text: Jonah King slips from the bar and rushes toward a parked
text: Sedan. He POPS the trunk and grabs a gym bag. As he crosses
text: toward the Driver's side door...
text: The gym bag starts to CRY.
speaker_heading: JONAH KING
dialog: Shhhh. Don't cry little precious.
text: FF-FFUMP! Two doors shut.
text: Jonah King turns, freezes.
text: Our two State Troopers stand near their parked cruiser,
text: staring from Jonah to the CRYING gym bag.
dialog: For a cop, this is that one in a life time event. A career
dialog: maker. News. Media. Leno. Then--
text: The cruiser's back door opens. The Accountant steps out. He
text: ignores Jonah King and the crying gym bag.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: Troopers. Remember why we're here.
text: He walks by them towards the front door of the bar.
text: Both Troopers turn and move around the side of building.
text: Jonah King...stares...stunned, he absentmindedly scratches at
text: the old scar on his face then leaps into the Sedan with the
text: gym bag, engine ROARS to life.
scene_heading: EXT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR - BACK LOT - NIGHT
text: Milton and Piper exit into the back lot.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Milton, I'm serious! I want some
dialog: answers!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 39.
text: They turn as the SPEEDING Sedan tears onto the highway. As
text: it disappears behind the barn it reveals --
text: --Man With Shovel. He FLINGS the barn doors open, stares at
text: Milton and Piper for a moment then vanishes within.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Yeah, we both want some answers.
text: Milton moves toward the barn as--
text: The State Troopers walk around the bar.
text: Everyone freezes.
text: The Troopers stare from Piper to Milton, then back to Piper.
dialog: Recognition.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Aw fuck.
text: Milton grabs Piper, places himself between she and the
text: Troopers as they go for their guns.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Come on!
text: Milton pulls the 357 and opens fire!
text: The Troopers, emboldened and fearless, stand their ground and
dialog: shoot back!
speaker_heading: FFFUMP!
text: Milton staggers, clutches his side. A crimson spot spreads
text: across his belly. Piper tries to catch him as he stumbles,
text: falls to one knee, his duffle tumbles to the ground, clothes
text: spilling from within.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: No!
dialog: The Troopers keep FIRING!
text: Piper stares down at Milton's open duffle. There's a gun
text: lying within the spilled clothes. An ancient six shooter.
dialog: We get just a glimpse, but we can tell this isn't just any
text: old gun. There's detailed inscriptions scrawled into the
text: metal. The steel of it is thick, tarnished and somehow angry.
text: She reaches for it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: No! Not that one.
text: He shoves the 357 toward her. Piper snatches it without
dialog: hesitation, rises and --
speaker_heading: KUPOW!
text: Trooper #1's chest EXPLODES. The force spins him...still
text: firing...he SHOOTS Trooper #2 in the ear!
text: Both men crash to the ground. Dead.
speaker_heading: KAFOOM!
text: The barn doors explode outward as a big Dodge truck powers
text: toward the highway, Man with Shovel behind the wheel.
text: Piper turns to find Milton struggling toward the GTO.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: What are you doing?!
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Have to stop him...
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Milton! Those cops weren't trying
dialog: to arrest us!
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: No. They weren't. Get in.
text: Milton climbs behind the GTO's wheel.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: I'll drive.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: You gotta patch me up. I'll drive.
text: Piper fumes but climbs into the passengers seat.
scene_heading: INT. GTO - NIGHT

speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: They were trying to kill us!
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Yes.
dialog:

speaker_heading: PIPER

speaker_heading: MILTON

scene_heading: THROUGH WINDSHIELD
text: The Accountant steps from the back door of the bar.
text: Hunter and Hunted glare.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Christ.
text: Piper's attention is still on the dead cops.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Christ is right! They start
dialog: shooting with no warning?! What
dialog: are you, a murderer? You escape
dialog: from prison or something?
text: The GTO tears onto the highway!
scene_heading: IN REARVIEW MIRROR
text: The Accountant just stands there...fading into the darkness.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Well?! Which is it?!
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Both.
text: Piper raises the gun, points it at Milton.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: What have you gotten me into? I
dialog: should...I should...Jesus, I just
dialog: killed a cop! I'm going to prison.
dialog: Give me one good reason I shouldn't
dialog: shoot you in the face.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Because I'm driving.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: You know what I mean!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

text: Milton gestures through the windshield, toward the distant
text: brake lights ahead.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: They took my grand-baby. Took my
dialog: grand-baby and killed my...
text: He breaks off. Looks away.
scene_heading: THROUGH WINDSHIELD
text: We see the lighted Amber Alert sign come into view and
text: quickly blur passed.
text: Piper stares at Milton.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: The little girl on the news? The
dialog: baby girl they're looking for?
text: Milton nods.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: But the news said the baby's
dialog: parents were...
text: Piper stops.
text: Milton's eyes glisten. He speaks in a whisper.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Sons of bitches killed my daughter.
text: Piper stares. Milton steadies himself.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: So Yeah. I busted out. And I'm
dialog: gonna get my grand-baby back. I'm
dialog: gonna get her back and I'm gonna
dialog: kill every last one of the fuckers.
speaker_heading: (A BEAT)
dialog: You want out, I'll understand.
dialog: Piper considers, then --
speaker_heading: KUH-FWAM!
text: They both slam into their seats as the GTO is rear-ended.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 43.
scene_heading: EXT. GTO - NIGHT
text: It's the Trooper's cruiser. The Accountant, face blank, sits
text: behind the wheel.
scene_heading: INT. GTO - NIGHT
text: Milton fights with the wheel as the muscle car fishtails. He
text: mashes the accelerator pulling out of the spin!
speaker_heading: MILTON
text: In the back seat. Now.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: What? Why?
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Now!
text: Piper scrambles into the back seat as Milton watches the
text: cruiser pull up along side him.
speaker_heading: MILTON
text: Shotgun. It's already loaded.
text: Piper digs the shotgun from the duffle and heaves it into the
text: front seat.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Have the other one ready. Not the
dialog: 357. The OLD one.
scene_heading: THROUGH PASSENGER WINDOW
text: The cruiser pulls up and matches the GTO's speed. After a
text: beat the Accountant turns and smiles at Milton.
text: Milton smiles back, lifts the shotgun, shoves the barrel
text: through the passenger window.
speaker_heading: BOOOM!
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DRY GORGE BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: The cruiser's driver's side window explodes.
scene_heading: INT. GTO - NIGHT
speaker_heading: MILTON'S POV
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 44.
text: The Accountant brushes shattered glass from his shoulder.
text: When he looks back at Milton its with a face of arrogance. A
text: cat toying with a three-legged mouse. He pulls the cruiser
text: next to Milton. Matches the GTO's speed. Shouts across.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: It's over, Milton. Stop the car.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: I can't do that.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: Really? What makes you think you
dialog: have a choice?
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: I got something I gotta do first.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: Then you should have done it a long
dialog: time ago.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: I didn't have to do it a long time ago!
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: Milton, I will kill that nice woman
dialog: in the backseat to get to you.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: I won't let you do that.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: Again. What makes you think you
dialog: have a choice?
speaker_heading: MILTON
speaker_heading: (TO PIPER)
dialog: Now.
text: Piper hands Milton the ancient Six Shooter. Milton snatches
text: it, points it across the gap between cars, pulls back the
text: hammer with a thunderous...KUH-THUNK.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: This does.
text: The Accountant's eyes widen.
scene_heading: SSHHU-BOOOM!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 45.
text: It's as if God tripped, fell and the entire earth shook as a
dialog: result!
text: The recoil nearly rips Milton's arm off.
text: We travel with the slug, fire trailing it, as it SLOMOs
text: toward the Accountant...his eyes continuing to widen...the
text: muscles in his face contracting.
scene_heading: INT. CRUISER - NIGHT
text: The Accountant cuts the wheel. Hard.
text: He wracks his head around as the slug just kisses his cheek.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DRY GORGE BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: The Cruiser SLAMS into the guard rail! The back-end rockets
text: forward as the cruiser goes into a spin.
text: The GTO fishtails away.
scene_heading: INT. GTO - NIGHT
text: Milton fights with the wheel as --
scene_heading: IN REARVIEW MIRROR
text: The Cruiser bucks up and over the guard rail.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DRY GORGE BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: The Cruiser, spins like a top, helicopters out over the
text: nothingness and plummets to the dry valley below.
scene_heading: KER-FRUNCH!
text: And flattens sending out a dusty shockwave in all directions.
scene_heading: INT. GTO - NIGHT
text: Milton manages to stop the GTO before it slams into the rail.
text: The GTO BUCKS and STALLS.
text: He breathes a sigh, then turns and stares in the direction
dialog: they'd been going.
text: He can just make out the fleeing Cultist's tail lights.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 46.
text: The back door opens. Piper leaps out.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Piper! Wait!
text: Milton watches the taillights vanish over a distant ridge.
text: He starts the engine...then hesitates...
scene_heading: THROUGH BACK WINDOW
text: Piper approaches the destroyed guard rail.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DRY GORGE BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: Piper stares into the valley below.
speaker_heading: HER POV
text: We can just make out the flattened Cruiser in the light of
text: the three quarter moon. No fireball. No smoke. No sign of
text: movement. Just flattened metal.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: He's not one of the ones who took
dialog: your granddaughter, is he?
scene_heading: MOVE TO REVEAL
text: Milton stands behind her. Shakes his head.
speaker_heading: MILTON
text: Someone else.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Is there anyone not trying to kill you?
text: Milton stares up the road. Piper considers, then --
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Come on. I'll help you. But
dialog: we're dealing with that first?
text: She points to his blood soaked shirt.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - NIGHT
text: The GTO THUNDERS beneath a starry sky.

scene_heading: INT. GTO - NIGHT
scene_heading: CLOSE ON SPEEDOMETER
text: The needle hovers at 95 mph.
text: PULL BACK TO REVEAL
text: Piper behind the wheel. Milton, shirtless, his stomach
text: wrapped in homemade bandages, grabs his shotgun, reloads.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: My daughter got mixed up with the son
dialog: of a bitch right out of college.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: She knew him? She knew Jonah King,
dialog: the man they think killed...
text: She stops herself.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: She knew him. The world was in a
dialog: fuckin tailspin and King was
dialog: preaching quiet revolution.
text: He places the shotgun on the dash, grabs the 357.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: It was four months before she
dialog: realized âquiet' meant hiding in
text: the basement, cutting the heads off
dialog: chickens.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Jonah King was into voodoo?
text: Milton reloads the 357, slowly, methodically.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Voodoo, the occult, not much he
dialog: wasn't into. When she told him she
text: was leaving, he helped her pack.
text: Gassed up her car. Cooked her a
text: hot meal. Then while she slept he
text: broke her leg in three places with
text: a tire iron.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Jesus.
text: She twists her pink bandanna nervously in her hands.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: She learned her lessen. Was a good
dialog: little follower for eighteen
dialog: months. That's when they met with
dialog: some witch doctor bullshit artist
dialog: in Chinatown. It was Chinese New
dialog: Year so the place was wall to wall
text: slants. She saw her chance,
text: stabbed Jonah in the face with a
text: souvenir corkscrew and vanished
text: into the crowd.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Milton. Your daughter was in a
dialog: cult for two years and you didn't
dialog: know? Why didn't you help her?
text: Milton grabs the ancient six shooter. It's got real weight.
text: His blood-stained fingers run down the scrolled steel. The
text: gun almost seems alive. Pops the chamber.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: I didn't find out about any of this
dialog: until...until I got locked up.
text: Only two bullets left. He SNAPS the gun shut.
text: Shoves it into his duffle.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Not gonna reload?
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Only had three bullets to begin...
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Milton.
scene_heading: THROUGH WINDSHIELD
text: Lights ahead. Several. And road flares. There's been an
dialog: accident.
text: Milton eases the shotgun into his lap.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CRASH SITE - DAWN
text: Several vehicles and an RV block the road. The PASSENGERS
text: scramble back and forth. There's a jack-knifed flatbed, a
text: crumpled Station Wagon and the Cultist's Dodge truck is
text: overturned on the shoulder.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 49.
scene_heading: INT. GTO - DAWN
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: That's his truck.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Stay put. I won't be long.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CRASH SITE - DAWN
text: Milton climbs from the GTO and crosses toward the overturned
text: Dodge. He lets the shotgun dangle at his side, keeping it
text: hidden behind him.
text: TATTOOED GUY and SKANKY GAL stand near the RV with MAN IN
text: LEATHER JACKET. BUSINESS WOMAN paces on her cell phone.
text: Milton glances at MAN WITH WIG sitting in the driver's seat
text: of his station wagon, his face in his hands. LADY IN
text: LEOPARDSKIN HOTPANTS kneels beside him. In the passenger
text: seat, BURLY DUDE's on his phone. Watching Milton.
text: There's a couple near the overturned Dodge. TRUCK DRIVING
text: WOMAN gazes into the upsidedown cab. THIN OLD MAN rises and
text: nods as Milton approaches.
speaker_heading: THIN OLD MAN
dialog: I think he's gonna be okay.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Is that right?
text: In a swift move, Milton RATCHETS a shell into the chamber,
text: drops to one knee, aims into the cab.
speaker_heading: MILTON'S POV
text: The cab is empty.
text: Somewhere near, we hear a MUFFLED BABY'S CRY.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON MILTON'S FACE
text: Realization. Shit. But it's too late.
text: A snub-nosed .38 appears at his temple.
speaker_heading: THIN OLD MAN
dialog: I wouldn't.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: PIPER (O.S.)
dialog: Milton!
text: Milton rises slowly and takes in the situation.
text: Tattooed Guy comes up fast behind the GTO. We get a good
text: look at him. It's Man with Shovel. Piper's getting out,
text: doesn't see Tattooed Guy until he's grabbed her. Presses the
text: pistol in her ribs.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Hey! Let me go, fucker!
text: She goes to fight but Man in Leather Jacket approaches her
text: with an axe. Burly Dude is with him.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Don't Piper! (to Thin Old Man)
dialog: Let her go. She's a pain in the
dialog: ass you don't want.
text: Milton still hasn't let go of his shotgun.
speaker_heading: THIN OLD MAN
dialog: Drop it. Or we'll gut her.
text: To emphasize the point, Truck Driving Woman pulls a Rambo
text: Knife from her purse and smiles a missing toothed smile.
text: Milton drops the shotgun as --
text: --Man With Wig steps from his car with a scoped hunting
text: rifle. Lady in Leopardskin rises revealing a baseball bat
text: with nails and spikes protruding from the end.
text: Skanky Gal and Business Woman open the RV's door.
text: Jonah King steps from within then smiles down at Milton. He
text: cradles a baby in his arms.
speaker_heading: JONAH KING
dialog: Milton, isn't it? Why are you here?
dialog: Why are you making such a fuss?
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Isn't that obvious, you sick fuck?
dialog: I'm here for her.
text: Milton gestures toward the baby.
speaker_heading: JONAH KING
dialog: What's obvious is that you clearly
dialog: abandoned your daughter.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: JONAH KING (cont'd)
text: Crushed her so completely that she
dialog: told everyone you were dead. No,
dialog: Milton, I cannot in good faith hand
dialog: over this child to you.
speaker_heading: MILTON
text: But sacrificing her under the full
dialog: fuckin moon, that's okay?
speaker_heading: JONAH KING
dialog: Okay? Milton, your granddaughter is
dialog: unbelievably blessed. Look around.
dialog: The world's on fire. Companies own
dialog: our governments and the people
dialog: suffer. Daily. And will continue to
dialog: suffer until change comes. And
dialog: change will come. Thanks to your
dialog: granddaughter, Milton. She will open
text: the door to a new world order.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Your BS don't work on me. You
dialog: killed my daughter but I won't let
dialog: you kill my grandbaby.
speaker_heading: JONAH KING
dialog: Your daughter's death was an
dialog: accident.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: No shithead, it wasn't. I saw the
dialog: whole damn thing. I saw who you
dialog: are when no one's lookin'. And I

text: Jonah's armor cracks a little as Milton faces the others.
speaker_heading: JONAH KING
dialog: Milton, you're embarrassing your--
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: (to the crowd)
dialog: --What was it three or four days
dialog: before he showed after killin my
dialog: little girl? You jerkoffs didn't
dialog: notice he was walking a little stiff?
text: Milton glances at Skanky Gal and Business Woman.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: When's the last time he shared a
dialog: bed with either of you? Before
dialog: that night, right?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 52.
text: The girls shoot a nervous glance at Jonah.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: You forced my daughter onto her

text: Jonah stares at Milton in shock. How does he know?
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: But don't take my word for it. Ask
text: him. Leather Jacket was there.
dialog: Jonah made him swear not to tell.
text: Jonah lifts a .38 auto from within the baby's blanket and

scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CRASH SITE - DAWN
text: Man With Wig pops the back of the Station wagon. Truck
text: Driving Woman and Thin Old Man lean in, snatch two shovels.
text: Burly Dude drags Leather Jacket's body next to Milton's as
text: the others join him.
text: They gaze down at Milton, his one eye open and unseeing. A

text: MILTON'S GOOD EYE TWITCHES.
text: Everyone stares. Did they just see that right?
text: THE 357 COMES UP IN MILTON'S HAND - FIRES!

speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT

scene_heading: INT. GTO - DAY

speaker_heading: JONAH KING

scene_heading: INT. RV - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. GTO - DAY

speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Got ya.

speaker_heading: MILTON

speaker_heading: PIPER

speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: What do we do now?
speaker_heading: MILTON

speaker_heading: MAN WITH WIG

speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: Christ on a cracker. My apologies.

text: Wig's shirt falls open revealing a pentagram tattooed above
text: his left breast.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: What's that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: MAN WITH WIG
dialog: It's a symbol of our pact with Lord

speaker_heading: MAN WITH WIG

speaker_heading: WEBSTER

speaker_heading: MILTON

speaker_heading: WEBSTER (O.S.)
dialog: That fire makin you homesick?
text: Piper and Webster approach with a six pack.
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: Cold beer?
text: Milton gazes up at the moon. It isn't full but it's close.
text: The fire CRACKLES, POPS. He stares at it.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: You know the pain and suffering
dialog: ain't the worse part, right?
dialog: That's what they tell ya, what they
dialog: want you to believe. But it's all
dialog: a big fuckin lie. Nosir, worst
dialog: part's the goddamn video feed.
text: Webster and Piper exchange a glance.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: It ain't about the fire and brimstone.
dialog: Ain't about your suffering. It's
dialog: about the suffering of them you love.
dialog: Cuz you see it. You see it all. In
dialog: full goddamn detail. And there ain't
dialog: nothin you can do about it.
text: Milton chunks a 2x4 into the fire. Sparks SWIRL into the air.
speaker_heading: MILTON

text: Milton goes quiet.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: He loved that daughter of mine.
dialog: Loved that little baby too. He
dialog: kept fightin long after he should'a

dialog: better at killin than others. Just

dialog: all. And...and then I'll be done.
text: Milton finally goes silent.

text: Webster looks steely. Determined.
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: Milton, I can't fix that car. But

speaker_heading: MILTON

speaker_heading: PIPER

speaker_heading: PIPER

speaker_heading: MILTON

dialog: Piper's coming with me.
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: You take that little girl over me?
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Give me the fuckin shells. And the gun.
text: Milton snatches both and hands them to Piper. He then
text: quickly places an arm around Webster's shoulders and walks
text: him out of earshot.
text: Piper places the gun and shells in the backseat then stares
text: at the two men.
text: They glance back at her several times. Then Webster nods.
text: Milton returns, slides into the passenger seat.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Let's go.

speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: He's not coming?
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: He's too old. He'll just slow us

speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: That's what you told him?
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: That's what Timmy told Lassie isn't it?
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Who the fuck is this Timmy and

speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: This ain't gonna be easy, Piper. I

scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY 50 - BORDER - DAY

scene_heading: INT. 69 NOVA - DAY
text: Milton behind the wheel, Piper has her bare feet on the

speaker_heading: PIPER

text: She breaks off. Her mouth drops.
scene_heading: THROUGH WINDSHIELD
text: As the NOVA tops a ridge, in the distance we see a police
text: barricade. Several State Trooper Cruisers line the roadway
text: in front of a bridge crossing a dry ravine. Cruisers line
text: the side of the road.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY 50 - DRY RAVINE BRIDGE - DAY
text: Twenty cruisers. Thirty TROOPERS are set up behind their

dialog:

text: Cap, the American Indian Police Captain, stands in front, a

speaker_heading: CAP
dialog: Just keep driving him to us. We'll
dialog: do the rest. And make sure you
text: peel off before the fireworks.
text: He lowers the handset, addresses the men.
speaker_heading: CAP
dialog: Gentlemen, these two killed two of
dialog: our own. I know you'd like them to
dialog: pay. Therefore, when I tell you to
dialog: aim for the tires, what I mean is
dialog: aim for their heads. Are we clear?
text: The men nod with steely determination.
speaker_heading: CAP
dialog: Very good. Please aim for the tires.
scene_heading: INT. 69 NOVA - DAY

speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Just don't stop.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Too many of them.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Just keep driving.
speaker_heading: MILTON

scene_heading: INT. 69 NOVA - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. 69 NOVA - DAY
text: The Cruiser's front end, hits the blacktop, digs in and flips

dialog: The radio antenna SNAPS!
scene_heading: INT. MACK TRUCK - DAY
text: The Accountant smiles. Then cuts the wheel. Hard.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY 50 - DRY RAVINE BRIDGE - DAY

scene_heading: INT. 69 NOVA - DAY
scene_heading: THROUGH WINDSHEILD

speaker_heading: MILTON

scene_heading: THROUGH WINDSHIELD

scene_heading: EXT. 69 NOVA - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY 50 - DRY RAVINE BRIDGE - DAY
text: Cap staggers into the road, FIRING at the Nova!
speaker_heading: CAP
dialog: Hurry! After them!
text: Those men still near, scramble toward the working vehicles as
scene_heading: SCRRREEEECH.
text: The Mack skids to a stop behind them, now parallel across the

scene_heading: CLOSE ON SARGE AND CAP
speaker_heading: SARGE

scene_heading: ON ACCOUNTANT

scene_heading: POV FROM TROOPERS
text: He's holding an FBI badge in the air.
speaker_heading: CAP
dialog: No Goddamn way. No ever-loving way

speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: Need you boys to stand down. Captain,
dialog: you know what this badge means, right?
text: Not a single gun lowers. All trained at The Accountant.

speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: Federal Bureau of get the fuck
dialog: outta my way. You boys have

text: He stops, turns...sniffs the air.
text: His focus settles on a YOUNG FACED TROOPER.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: You.
text: ANGLE - Looking down on The Accountant surrounded by armed
text: angry troopers. He steps from the truck, nudges Cap aside
text: like he wasn't there. Cap can't believe it.
text: Shot continues, moving down, closer and closer until the
text: Accountant is face to face with a Young Faced Trooper.
text: The kid keeps his gun aimed, nervous, excited and confused.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 86.
text: Suddenly the Accountant moves fast. He bats the gun aside,
text: snatches the kid's uniform shirt and pulls it open, popping
text: two buttons.
scene_heading: YOUNG-FACED TROOPER
dialog: Hey, Hey!!! Cap!
text: And there...above the kid's left breast...a pentagram tattoo.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: It seems you're serving two masters.
text: The kid says nothing stares. Every cop's gun is sighted on
text: the Accountant. He doesn't seem to notice.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: Take out your phone and call him.
dialog: Call Jonah King. Tell him the old
text: man is dead.

speaker_heading: CAP

scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY 50 - NEVADA - DAY

scene_heading: INT. 69 NOVA - DAY
text: Piper stares through the back window.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: I don't think...why aren't they
dialog: following us?
text: Milton slips into his hunting vest. A scowl on his face.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: They're likely scared of you.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Now what?
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Now we drive.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 87.
text: We pull back...
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY 50 - NEVADA - DAY
text: ...out of the back glass as the Nova speeds up.
text: Faster...faster. The sun suddenly time lapses across the
text: sky. The landscape blurs. Only the Nova and the moving sun
text: remain...until the sun dips into the Western horizon and
text: vanishes...replaced by one hell of a bright full moon.
scene_heading: EXT. SOMEWHERE IN NEVADA - NIGHT
text: Suddenly our view veers off the highway and rips toward a
text: rocky outcropping in the distance.
text: We slow and drop toward the ground until we're mere inches
text: above the cracked earth...we come to a stop.
speaker_heading: FOOM
text: A BOOT slams into view.
text: PULL BACK TO REVEAL
scene_heading: EXT. STILWATER MARSH - NEVADA - NIGHT
text: Milton climbs from the Nova. In the distance we can hear
text: DRUMS. BONGOS. There's CHANTING. And LAUGHTER.
text: Piper rises and gazes at him over the roof. She's scared.
text: Milton shoves the 357 into his back waistband, slides the
text: ancient revolver into a leather hip-holster then he leans in
text: and grabs his shotgun.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Stay here.
text: Piper nods.
text: Milton moves toward the jagged rocks in the distance but soon
text: we can make out the flicking light of fire ahead as Milton
text: moves toward a cliff's edge.
scene_heading: EXT. STILWATER MARSH - CLIFF'S EDGE - NIGHT
text: Milton lowers to the ground and crawls to the edge.
speaker_heading: MILTON'S POV
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 88.
text: A twenty foot drop off to the ravine floor below. The ravine
text: is filled with giant oil derricks, like metallic T-Rex's,
text: rising and falling to the SHRIEK of oiled metal.
text: And in the center of this Jurassic gathering, a CROWD of
text: people dance and sway around a giant bonfire. It is
text: celebration, ritual and orgy rolled into one.
text: Brawny cultists erect a makeshift stone altar. On the
text: opposite side of the Oil-Rig ravine - the battered RV sits
text: like a mobile command post.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON MILTON'S FACE
dialog: He was expecting less than twenty followers. There are forty
dialog: down there. Fuck.
scene_heading: EXT. STILWATER MARSH - NEVADA - NIGHT
text: Milton walks slowly back toward the Nova. His head lowered
text: in deep thought. How does one man and a kid take on forty?
text: Suddenly a look of alarm crosses his face!
text: He jerks the ancient revolver and aims it ahead.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: Piper sits on the hood of the Nova next to the Accountant.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Get away from her.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: I think not.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: I shoot you with this, you know
dialog: what it means. No heaven. No
dialog: hell. You cease to exist.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: All the more reason to keep Ms.
dialog: Piper in close proximity. You are
dialog: old, Milton. You might miss again.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: You can't stop me.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: Stop you? Milton, you wouldn't be
dialog: here without me, you ungrateful
dialog: shit. That roadblock back there,
dialog: that would have stopped you. So I
dialog: want you to drop that iron God-
dialog: Killer and say thank you.
text: Milton stares.
text: The Accountant, moves. Quickly. With a crisp flick,
text: suddenly there's a blade at Piper's throat. She GASPS.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: I said, drop it and thank you.
text: Milton puts up his hand, flings the revolver into the
text: darkness behind him.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Don't hurt her. Th-Thank you.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: That's better.
text: He lowers the blade, but keeps Piper close.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: You're not the first to get out and
dialog: I doubt you'll be the last but I
dialog: gotta know, HOW did you get out
dialog: with the God-Killer?
speaker_heading: MILTON
speaker_heading: (CHUCKLES)
dialog: I just walked in and took it.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: You did not.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: I'm an old washed up lifer. Never
dialog: occurred to'em that I was up to no good.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: Wouldn't wanna be you when he finds
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: What's he gonna do? Not let me
dialog: back in? Now, I gotta know. Why?
dialog: Why help me?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: I know why. It's because of those
dialog: crazy fucks out there isn't it?
dialog: They figured something out didn't
dialog: they? Somehow they know how to
dialog: summon a piece of hell to earth.
text: The Accountant laughs.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: That's cute. You haven't told her?
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: She don't listen.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: Young Ms. Piper, let you in on a
dialog: little secret. The Dark Lord?
dialog: Satan? Beelzebub? Lucifer? Simply
text: the warden of a very large prison.
dialog: Quiet man, actually. Thoughtful.
dialog: Well read. I happen to know the
dialog: idea of sacrificing children in his
text: honor annoys him greatly.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Then why? Why help me?
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: Simple. Like the warden, we all
dialog: have jobs to do. Getting you here
dialog: makes my job easier. You get what
dialog: you want, I get what I want.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Then help me, now. There are forty of
dialog: them down there. You and I could--
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: --No.
speaker_heading: MILTON
speaker_heading: BUT--
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: --No. You want to save her then go
dialog: do it. If you win, I win. If they
dialog: take you down, I win.
text: He hugs Piper closer.

dialog: 
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: You like butter on your popcorn?
dialog: It's sure to be a grand show.
text: Piper doesn't know what to say.
text: The Accountant glances back at Milton.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: You're still here? Milton, the clock
text: is ticking. Midnight approaches.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Then get off my fuckin car.
scene_heading: EXT. OIL RIG RAVINE - NIGHT
text: The RV door flings open revealing Jonah King. He walks with
text: arrogance through the orgy around him, his followers turn to
text: him with reverence. His name is WHISPERED like a secret.
text: He approaches the make-shift stone altar where Skanky Gal
text: holds the baby within a bundle of blankets.
text: HIGH ABOVE: the moon is full and ripe.
speaker_heading: JONAH KING
text: It's almost time.
text: Skanky Gal nods. But there is hesitation in her eyes. She's
text: grown attached to the baby.
text: Jonah takes the baby, places her on the stone altar.
speaker_heading: JONAH KING
dialog: My brothers and sisters, we have come
dialog: so far. To this place where the
text: dying earth bleeds its corrupt soul
dialog: at our feet. From its death, it shall
dialog: be reborn. As we will be. We who
dialog: have survived the slings. The
text: arrows. The revulsion of those too
dialog: weak to believe. We have been cast
text: out. And hunted. But no more.
text: Followers gather, move in unison, dance, writhe, fuck.
text: Tattoo approaches with an old rusty knife. It was probably
text: elegant once. Now it is worthless. He hands it to Jonah.
text: The Followers GASP in holy awe.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: JONAH KING
dialog: (raising the knife)
dialog: With this sacrifice, no more will

dialog: not meek. We are chosen. The

dialog: our command. For now we...
text: A HOWLING noise.
text: No. An engine. Distant but thunderous.
text: Heads turn. The sound echoes throughout the ravine then --
speaker_heading: FOOOM!
text: The NOVA ROCKETS from the cliff's edge!
text: It plummets straight at the cultists!
text: They scatter! But three are not so lucky, they vanish as the
text: giant Chevy turns them to PULP!
text: Jonah's jaw drops. This can't fuckin' be.
text: Skanky Gal, grabs the baby and flees toward one of the giant
dialog: oil derricks!
scene_heading: INT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT
text: Milton wears a mask of rage as he rips the Nova into a 180,
text: his 357 aimed out the window.
text: KABOOM! BOOM! KUHFWOOM!
text: He's shooting Cultists in a barrel.
text: But the Nova is the better weapon. He FLOORS it, then LOCKS
text: the brakes, fishtailing.
scene_heading: EXT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT
text: The Nova's ass-end veers like a dragon's tail SMACKING
text: cultists aside with BONE-SHATTERING brutality.
scene_heading: EXT. OIL RIG RAVINE - NIGHT

text: JONAH can see Milton's got him.
text: MILTON grits and pulls the 357's trigger: Click. Click.
speaker_heading: BLAM!
text: Jonah fires a fresh round - barely missing as--
text: Milton GUNS the engine - SMASHES two followers head on. They
text: fly up the hood, SMASH the glass - but shield him from
text: another frontal assault. Their bodies RIDDLED with lead.
text: The Cultists circle him to get a better shot.
text: A Magnum is thrust into the driver's side window - right in
text: Milton's face.
text: He leans back just as the gun is FIRED. Milton yanks the
text: wheel, reverses the Nova - wrenches the Magnum from the
text: fucker's hand. The Cultist hangs on. Claws at Milton.
text: Milton twirls the Magnum, gunslinger style. Jams the barrel
text: into the Cultist's face and FIRES.
text: Milton runs down any that get in his way.
scene_heading: EXT. STILWATER MARSH - CLIFF'S EDGE - NIGHT

text: He can hear her heartbeat.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: You want to help him.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: He chose you, you know that. Fast
dialog: car, spunky attitude. He put your
dialog: life at risk and you still want to
dialog: help him?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: Then go.
text: She rushes toward a goat path leading down to the valley
text: below. Suddenly something catches her eye.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON GROUND
dialog: The Ancient Revolver.
text: Without the slightest pause, Piper snatches it, spins and
dialog: aims it right at...
text: The Accountant's smiling face.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: Hold on tight. It has quite a kick.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: If I kill you, you can't take him.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: Someone else will come...someone
dialog: else always comes.
text: Piper considers, the SOUNDS of battle rising from below.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: Piper, he didn't steal that gun to
dialog: kill me. He stole it to slow me down.
dialog: He's getting what he wanted. Now, go
text: to him. Before it's too late.
text: Piper turns and scrambles down the goat path.
scene_heading: INT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT
text: Milton is ROARING in anger as the NOVA is PEPPERED with
text: bullets and shotgun blasts. GLASS, SPARKS and CHAOS rain
text: down on him. Steam and oil SPEW from the engine.
scene_heading: EXT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT
text: Ducking in the seat, unable to see, Milton fights to keep
speaker_heading: CONTROL UNTIL:
text: Jonah BLASTS the front driver's side tire, SHREDDING it -
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 95.
text: The NOVA pitches hard to the left, PIN-WHEELING right into an
text: oil derrick.
text: The SCREAM of metal on metal rips through the ravine. The
text: Nova SCREECHES to a halt, tires SPIN, smoke spews, gas drips
text: from the wreck.
text: Jonah and the half a dozen remaining Cultists zero in around
text: the Nova, guns trained on the driver's door.
text: Jonah nods to Tattoo who approaches close to the ground,
text: reaches out slowly and YANKS the door open.
speaker_heading: KA-FOOM!
text: Tattoo is blown backwards by a shotgun blast!
speaker_heading: JONAH KING
dialog: Kill him!
text: Jonah and his men open FIRE!
scene_heading: INT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT
text: Milton SCREAMS as the Nova's cab turns into a warzone. He
text: clambers deep inside the wreck. Praying they don't ignite
text: the leaking fuel. Then the firing stops.
scene_heading: EXT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT
text: Jonah and his men draw closer and closer.
speaker_heading: THEIR POV
text: Soon they'll have a direct shot right into the Nova's open
text: driver's side door.
speaker_heading: PIPER (O.S.)
speaker_heading: HEY!
text: The men spin to find Piper standing behind them, ancient
text: revolver aimed into their group. She pulls the trigger.
speaker_heading: KAFOOM!
text: Jesus wept. The KICKBACK blows Piper off her feet, the gun
text: jerked from her hands.
text: She lands on her back. Hard. The wind KNOCKED out of her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 96.
text: The GOD SLUG slams into a cultist's stomach. It EXPLODES
text: through him, and into the BATTERED RV BEHIND:
speaker_heading: KABLAAAAM!
text: The RV goes nuclear - blows shrapnel and cultists helter
text: skelter across the ravine, shredding the remaining five.
text: JONAH is spattered with his men's blood, dives behind the
text: wreck of the Nova.
speaker_heading: JONAH KING
dialog: Well...this has all gone to shit.
text: He steadies himself, grips the shotgun and shoves it into the
text: Nova's open driver's side door.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: Empty. The passenger door is open. Milton is gone.
text: Jonah spins in all directions. Expecting a trick. But
text: nothing. He rushes around the Nova to find...
text: Milton crawling. Bleeding.
speaker_heading: MILTON'S POV
text: Skanky Gal cowers twenty yards away beneath an oil derrick.
text: The baby wrapped in pink blankets in her arms.
text: Jonah walks up oozing arrogance. He knows he's won.
text: He places the barrel of the shotgun to Milton's chin.
speaker_heading: JONAH KING
dialog: You lose.
speaker_heading: (LOOKS UP)
dialog: Get over here!
text: Skanky continues to cower. Doesn't budge.
speaker_heading: JONAH KING
dialog: I said get over here! I want him
dialog: to watch me kill the kid!
text: Skanky doesn't move.
speaker_heading: JONAH KING
speaker_heading: (TO MILTON)
dialog: Stupid bitch. Fine. Then just
dialog: know I promise to kill her slowly.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 97.
text: Jonah raises the barrel to Milton's forehead then...
text: Someone near CLEARS HIS THROAT.
text: Jonah turns, stares.
text: The Accountant leans against the Nova's hulk. He winks.
text: At Jonah's feet, Milton scrambles forward and we realize he
text: wasn't crawling toward his grand-baby.
text: He was crawling toward the ancient revolver.
text: He snatches it, rolls onto his back as--
text: Jonah swings his gun toward Milton --
speaker_heading: KAFOOM!
text: The burning God Slug HITS JONAH IN THE FACE!
text: Jonah's head is obliterated. The force yanks his headless
text: body into the air, spins it sky-wards in a plume of flame.
text: The Accountant moves away, watching as --
text: The burning corpse slaps onto the leaking wreck of the Nova.
speaker_heading: THE GAS IGNITES
text: FLAMES ERUPT with THUNDER clear to the heavens - the Nova
text: ROARS one final time, living up to it's name in a furious
text: ball of fire that consumes whatever's left of Jonah King.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Piper SUCKS in air. Sits up. Fire lighting her face.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Milton?!
text: He lies on his back several yards away.
text: Piper rushes up, falls beside him.
text: He's alive, mouth filled with blood. She takes his hand.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Skanky Gal looks up to find...
text: ...the Accountant standing over her. He holds out his arms.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 98.
text: She hands him the baby.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: I'm curious. Would you have let
dialog: him do it?
text: She opens her mouth to speak, says nothing...
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: That's what I thought.
text: He turns and walks away from her.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: See you. Soon.
text: Skanky bolts. Races off into the darkness.
scene_heading: ON MILTON AND PIPER
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Milton...no...
text: Milton struggles. His head lolls back and forth. Eyes flick
text: around. Searching.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Where...where is she?
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: She's here.
text: The Accountant hands the baby to Milton.
text: Milton stares at the tiny face. The big bright eyes.
text: Innocent. Beautiful in every miraculous way.
text: He places her in Piper's arms.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Keep her safe.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: I will. Anyone tries to hurt her
dialog: and I'll kill'em.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: I know. That's why I chose you.
text: A HORN BLARES.
text: They all turn toward the high cliff.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: THEIR POV
text: WEBSTER climbs from the 69 Camaro.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Webster will look after you both.
dialog: As long as he can. And he'll keep
text: trying long after he can't.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Milton. This can't...you can't
dialog: just give up. There's gotta be
dialog: something we can do to...
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Beat the devil? Nah. Never gonna
dialog: happen. I'm askin more than I have
dialog: a right to. I know it. But love
dialog: her for me, Piper. Love her and
dialog: make her yours. I don't have any
dialog: right to ask for your promise...
speaker_heading: PIPER
scene_heading: (WITHOUT HESITATION)
dialog: I promise. Milton. I promise.
text: Milton coughs.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Thank you.
text: And like that. The life fades from his eyes.
text: Piper holds the baby close, SOBS.
text: She looks up at the Accountant. But he is gone.
scene_heading: EXT. STILWATER MARSH - NEVADA - DAWN
text: The sun glows to the east as --
text: --Piper cradles the baby as she climbs the goat path where
text: Webster is waiting. He rushes to her, places an arm around
text: her. Leads her toward the Camaro as --
scene_heading: EXT. OIL RIG RAVINE - DAWN
scene_heading: CLOSE ON MILTON
text: He twitches.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 100.
text: His one good eye opens. It rolls around then settles on
dialog: something above.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: How was that?
scene_heading: MOVE TO REVEAL
text: The Accountant stands over him.
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: I've seen better. Guess she
dialog: doesn't know you can beat him, slow
dialog: him, shoot him, even stop him...
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: ...But you can't kill a dead man.
text: Milton sits up slowly. Bones CREAK. He holds his hand out.
text: The Accountant takes it. Pulls him to his feet.
text: They turn and walk toward the rising sun.
text: They walk until they are just silhouettes against a bright
dialog: yellow glow...then...
text: ...they fade into the shimmering heat...
text: ...and they are gone.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
