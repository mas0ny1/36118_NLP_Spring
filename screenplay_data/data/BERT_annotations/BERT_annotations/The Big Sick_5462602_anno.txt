dialog: Nanjiani!
speaker_heading: KUMAIL (V.O.)
dialog: Hello. I grew up in Pakistan. And people
dialog: are always asking me, what was that like?
dialog: Really not that different from here. I
dialog: mean we played cricket, which is just a
dialog: spicier version of baseball. And we
dialog: prayed a lot. Well not a lot, just five
dialog: times a day. And we marry someone our
dialog: parents find for us. Arranged marriage,
dialog: you know. For me, it was probably that we
dialog: got episodes of the A-Team a little bit
dialog: later. And by a little bit later, I mean
dialog: we just got episode two. But other than
dialog: that, it was exactly the same.

text: Kumail walks into the comedy club as MARY is doing a set
text: on stage. CHRIS intercepts Kumail as he walks backstage.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: There's no bad crowds dude. Only bad
dialog: comedians.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: You complain about the crowd like all
dialog: the time.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah, but that's when they're really bad.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: So like ninety percent of the time,
dialog: they're really bad?
dialog: 2
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Will you just watch and give me notes
dialog: tonight? If we both give each other
dialog: notes, I think it would be helpful.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Your notes are just to add more "fucks"
dialog: into the bit.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Fuck's a funny word. Soft on the top and
text: it's hard on the end.
text: Mary walks off the stage and sits on the couch next to
dialog: CJ.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: That was truly horrible.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Hey, that was great.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: No, he didn't even crack a smile. I
dialog: thought I was gonna puke.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Bob Dalavan.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Who's Bob Dalaban?
speaker_heading: CJ
dialog: Bob Dalavan - works for the Montreal

speaker_heading: DODD (O.S.)
dialog: Now before I bring up the next guy, you
dialog: guys know tonight is Jell-o Shot
dialog: Tuesday! Whooo!! And we all know what
dialog: happens after eight Jell-o shots. We
dialog: urinate all over ourselves and puke.
dialog: Okay, so I'm going to bring up the next
dialog: comic. You know this man.
text: Chris slaps his own face.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Confidence. Poise. Smile.
speaker_heading: Dodd (O.S.)
dialog: Give it up for Mister Chris Jones!
text: Chris walks on stage.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: He's like if a serial killer fucked an

speaker_heading: CJ
dialog: He's like Daniel Day Lewis except he

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Just bought a laser printer. Printed

speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Hey Dodd. Dalavan's in the crowd
dialog: tonight. Could I do ten?
speaker_heading: DODD
dialog: No. Five minutes. You put out chairs,

speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: C'mon man. I'll double it up next time.

speaker_heading: DODD
dialog: No.
text: Dodd walks back into the bathroom.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL

speaker_heading: DODD
dialog: I'm making up next week's schedule.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Okay. Cool.
scene_heading: INT. TRIPLE DOOR - LATER
text: CJ is on stage crushing it. Kumail and Mary watch from
dialog: the wings.
speaker_heading: CJ
dialog: I was in bed with my girlfriend and I was
dialog: trying to mansplain to her that, you
dialog: know, we are on one little rock orbiting
text: a star in a galaxy of a billion stars in
text: a universe full of a billion galaxies, so
dialog: I forgot your birthday. Who gives a shit?
dialog: You are cosmically over reacting to this.
dialog: Honestly you are being super selfish.
dialog: You're right, but you're selfish.
text: Kumail looks out at the crowd. Dalavan enjoys CJ's set.
scene_heading: INT. TRIPLE DOOR - LATER
text: Kumail puts a RECORDER on his stool, presses RECORD and
text: starts his set.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Hey! Have you guys heard of this new drug
dialog: cocktail called cheese? I saw these news
dialog: reports so I looked up what cheese is and
dialog: cheese is a mixture. Cheese is Tylenol PM
dialog: and heroin. So really, it's heroin.
dialog: Heroin's doing the heavy lifting. Just do
dialog: the heroin, it's very powerful. You
dialog: already have heroin.
text: Kumail looks to see if Bob Dalavan is laughing. He's not
text: there. He's in the back talking to CJ. Fuck.

speaker_heading: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
dialog: (pushing through)
dialog: Is Pakistan in the house?!
text: O.S. A WOMAN "Woo-hoos!" Kumail looks out at the crowd
text: and sees EMILY, late 20's, white with a streak of blue
text: in her hair. She sits at a table with a few friends.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
dialog: You're not from Pakistan. I would have
dialog: noticed you.
text: She smiles.
text: Crowded bar scene after the show. Kumail, Chris, Mary
text: and CJ hang out at the bar.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: He just gave you Montreal? Like you
dialog: don't have to showcase or audition or
dialog: anything?
speaker_heading: CJ
dialog: It was too easy. Like I wanted to
dialog: struggle. I wanted a story to be able
dialog: to tell on talk shows and instead,
dialog: like, you guys don't know how hard it
dialog: is not to struggle. It's a struggle
text: succeeding effortlessly.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Did he say anything about me?
speaker_heading: CJ
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What about me?
speaker_heading: CJ
dialog: Both of you. He said, those guys
dialog: performed...
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I truly hate you, actually.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: We all hate you.
text: Kumail walks over to Emily and her friend JESSIE, talks
text: loud over the music.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Hi.
dialog: 6
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Um, my name is Kumail.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Yeah. We know.
speaker_heading: JESSIE
dialog: We saw you perform.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Yeah. Now that the niceties are out of
dialog: the way, I have to tell you that when
dialog: you yelled at me, it threw me off. You
dialog: really shouldn't heckle comedians. It's
dialog: so rude.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I didn't heckle you. I just woo-hooed
dialog: you. It was supportive.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Okay, that's a common misconception.
dialog: Yelling anything at a comedian is
dialog: considered heckling. Heckling doesn't
dialog: have to be negative.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: So if I yelled out "You're amazing in
dialog: bed," that would be a heckle?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Yeah. It'd be an accurate heckle.
speaker_heading: JESSIE
dialog: Wow. Goodbye!
text: Jessie walks away.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Don't go! You scared my friend off now.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Emily.
text: Kumail writes Emily's name in Urdu on a napkin.
dialog: 7
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: I want to show you something, Emily.
dialog: This is your name in Urdu.
text: Emily picks up the napkin, looks at it.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Whoa. Does this move work?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: I've had some minor success with it.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Bullshit.
scene_heading: INT. TRIPLE DOOR BAR - LATER
text: Emily and Kumail are still at the bar.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: So you came to a comedy show with your
dialog: friends?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Yeah, we're all grad students at U of
dialog: C.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: What are you studying at grad school?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I study psychology. I'm going to be a
dialog: therapist.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Oh so you're gonna sit on a couch and
dialog: ask people, "how did that make you
dialog: feel?"
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Eventually. Right now I'm doing field
dialog: work with a group of guys convicted of
dialog: domestic violence.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: EMILY
text: Cheers to that.
dialog: 8
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Oh wow. No, don't cheers to that. To
dialog: you becoming a therapist.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Great. To me getting my masters. We'll
dialog: start there and then we'll go to the
dialog: rest of it.
scene_heading: INT. KUMAIL'S APARTMENT - LATER
text: Kumail and Emily walk in. It's a typical bachelor pad
text: boy house. Milk crates for furniture, mess everywhere,
text: no art on the walls. Chris is sitting on the couch
dialog: watching TV.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: So my roommate Chris is probably on the
dialog: couch. He's going to try and start a
dialog: conversation. So no matter what- do not
dialog: engage. Okay? Let's go.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Hi!
text: Emily and Kumail walk by Chris avoiding eye contact.
text: Kumail closes the bedroom door behind him.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Good for him.
scene_heading: INT. KUMAIL'S BEDROOM- CONTINUOUS
text: Kumail's bed is an inflatable air mattress. There are
dialog: clothes everywhere.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Do you want to watch a movie?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Sure. Should I just, put my stuff down?
dialog: Or...
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Yeah, I would say it's safe. You know
dialog: what, go for that area. I cleaned that
dialog: earlier this year.
text: Kumail points to a corner of his room covered in dirty
dialog: clothes.
dialog: 9
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Should I take my shoes off or is this a
dialog: shoes on bed?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: No, it's a shoes off bed. I have strict
dialog: rules.
text: Emily crawls onto the air mattress.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Oh wow. That's totally an inflated
dialog: mattress.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Yeah. Did you think it would be a flat
dialog: inflatable mattress?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I did think it might be an actual
dialog: mattress.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Well air mattresses are actual
dialog: mattresses. You're being bigoted towards
dialog: air based comfort items.
text: Kumail picks up the remote and turns on the TV. Night of
text: the Living Dead is playing.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Night of The Living Dead?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Sure, I haven't ever seen that movie.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Okay, so basically the dead start rising.
dialog: And the good guys, um...
text: They eye each other flirtatiously. Laugh. Lean in and
dialog: kiss.
scene_heading: INT. KUMAIL'S LIVING ROOM
text: Chris hits the Siri button on his iPhone.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Text Lauren. You up girl?
speaker_heading: SIRI
dialog: What do you want to say to Warren?
dialog: 10
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Ah, no. Fuck.
text: Chris hits the Siri button again.
speaker_heading: SIRI
dialog: What do you want to say to-
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You up? Period. Send.
speaker_heading: SIRI
dialog: That may be beyond my abilities at the

scene_heading: INT. KUMAIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Kumail and Emily post-coital.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: What are these scars?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Oh, they're a smallpox vaccination.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I thought only old people had those.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Well I'm from Pakistan. We're still
dialog: fighting some battles you guys have
dialog: already won.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: What were you like in high school? Were
dialog: you like, super funny? Were you really
dialog: smart?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: I was very shy. They called me
dialog: chashmullee.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: It roughly translates to "dweeb." I'll
dialog: show you a picture.
dialog: 11
text: Kumail flips through his phone and produces his old high
text: school photo, shows it to her.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Of you in high school? Oh my god!
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Boom.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: And I'm thinking I'm killing it right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: What inspired this hair cut?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Hugh Grant.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Oh no. And you're so serious.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: I read in an interview with Hugh Grant,
dialog: he said he doesn't smile because it
dialog: makes his face look fat. So I didn't
dialog: smile in pictures for many years. What
dialog: were you like in high school? Were you
dialog: voted... Most Sexy?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: No. I was voted "Most Noticeable."
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: That's good.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: No. It's really not good. I had acne,
dialog: and I was a Goth and I had this
dialog: terrible perm. The kids called me
dialog: Beetlejuice. I don't know why. Actually
dialog: I do know why, it's because they
dialog: thought I looked like Beetlejuice. I
dialog: think I'm done with this subject. In
dialog: fact, I think I'm gonna go home.
text: Emily gets up, pulling the blanket with her to hide her
text: body. Kumail holds onto it, stopping her progress.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Wait we haven't even had sex again yet.
dialog: 12
text: She tugs the blanket, he lets go. She dresses behind it.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: No. No. I'm really not that kind of
dialog: girl. I only have sex once on a first
dialog: date. Plus a hand job.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Well I haven't had that yet!
text: Emily laughs.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: You don't get that because you made fun
dialog: of me.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: What is happening right now? What are you
dialog: doing?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I'm changing under this blanket.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: I've seen everything. Do you remember, we
dialog: were just having sex?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Yeah, but you were in the throes of
dialog: passion then. Listen, I had a really nice
dialog: time. Thank you very much. I'm just gonna
dialog: call an Uber and go home.
text: Emily pulls out her PHONE, calls an Uber. Kumail's phone
text: makes a noise. They exchange a look.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Your driver will be ready as soon as he
text: puts on his pants.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Were you available for rides while we
dialog: were fucking?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Yeah, but I only looked a couple of
dialog: times.
scene_heading: INT. KUMAIL'S CAR - LATER
text: Kumail Ubers Emily home. Emily sits in the back.
dialog: 13
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: So. Maybe I'll run into you at the club
dialog: sometime and we can grab a drink?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I'm not really - I know this sounds
dialog: like a line - but I'm not really dating
dialog: right now. I have a lot of school and
dialog: work and just a lot on my plate.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: That's perfect because I'm not really
dialog: dating right now either. I actually
dialog: have a pretty strict two-day rule where
dialog: I can't see someone more than two days
dialog: in a row. So since we hung out for two
dialog: days, if I were to see you again, which
dialog: I won't because you're not dating, I'm
dialog: not dating, I wouldn't be able to see
dialog: you until Monday.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: We haven't hung out for two days. We've
dialog: hung out for about five hours. Just to
dialog: like, be totally clear.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Yesterday and today. Cause it's after
dialog: midnight, today is actually tomorrow.
dialog: Earlier tonight was yesterday. So two
dialog: days.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: You see, I don't date time nerds, so that
dialog: really takes you off the table.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: That works out, because I am a hard
dialog: core time nerd.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Yeah, I can tell.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: I'm like, very strict about AM/PM
dialog: stuff.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: So wait, just to establish, what did we
dialog: just decide?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: We decided we aren't ever going to see
text: each other again.
dialog: 14
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Great. I'm glad we're on the same page.

dialog: brand's name. Touch them. They're so
dialog: soft.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: I don't want to touch your jeans.
speaker_heading: AZMAT
dialog: They're like sweatpants. You should be
dialog: stylish like your father. It's not very
dialog: difficult. Just observe me.
speaker_heading: NAVEED
dialog: Get some Daddy Style.
speaker_heading: SHARMEEN
dialog: Kumi, why don't you grow a beard? Not
text: like Naveed's, just a small one.
speaker_heading: AZMAT
dialog: Maybe like mine, small and stylish.
speaker_heading: SHARMEEN
dialog: Kumi, I've been thinking, you know, why
dialog: you don't enroll for LSAT now?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Yeah sorry, Ma. I haven't done it yet.
dialog: I like that you bring it up as though
dialog: you've never brought it up before.
speaker_heading: NAVEED
dialog: How's the stand-up coming Bhai?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: It's going fine.
speaker_heading: SHARMEEN
dialog: Since when are you someone to stand-up?
dialog: You know who I think should stand up is
text: Malala. She has something to say.
dialog: 15
speaker_heading: NAVEED
dialog: Ma-la-la.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
text: She does open mics and she crushes. Lot
dialog: of ethnic material, which I think is a
dialog: crutch, and that one story gets a lot of
dialog: play, but -
speaker_heading: FATIMA
dialog: You should be on that show Saturday Night
dialog: Live!
speaker_heading: NAVEED
dialog: SNL!
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: That's a great idea. I should e-mail
dialog: them, I don't know why I hadn't thought
dialog: of that.
speaker_heading: AZMAT
dialog: You know, I hacked into your Cousin
dialog: Rehan's Facebook account-
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: You hacked into it?
speaker_heading: AZMAT
dialog: Yeah, they were not accepting my friend
dialog: request so I had to hack into it and I
dialog: discovered he and that white woman he is
dialog: living with are having a baby -
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: They're married.
speaker_heading: AZMAT
dialog: Yeah, whatever. And then I hacked into
dialog: Tumblr and I discovered that they named
dialog: him Davé. Can you imagine?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Dave. It's probably Dave.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: Ah, Dave. Yes, Dave.
speaker_heading: SHARMEEN
dialog: Very, very, very sad. No one is going to

dialog: 16
speaker_heading: FATIMA
text: It's like he's dead. Or worse.

speaker_heading: AZMAT

speaker_heading: AZMAT
dialog: No, no-
scene_heading: DOORBELL RINGS.
speaker_heading: SHARMEEN
dialog: Oh. I wonder who that could be?
text: Sharmeen goes to the door.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: I'm guessing it's a young, single
dialog: Pakistani woman who just happened to be
dialog: driving by our house, which is in a cul-
dialog: de-sac and I'm also guessing that the
dialog: phrase "dropped in" will be said in the

speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: I'm not a burger.
speaker_heading: NAVEED

speaker_heading: KUMAIL

speaker_heading: NAVEED
dialog: Well thank you for that information
dialog: that no one gives a shit about and you
dialog: should listen to mom and grow a beard.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL

speaker_heading: NAVEED
dialog: Try being a man and conditioning like I

speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: What's the whole thing with Muslims
dialog: growing beards anyway? It's such an
dialog: arbitrary thing. Like who decided that?
dialog: Oh, we have to have beards.
speaker_heading: NAVEED
dialog: Yeah. There are a billion of us and you

speaker_heading: KUMAIL

speaker_heading: KUMAIL
text: She's white.
speaker_heading: NAVEED

speaker_heading: KUMAIL

speaker_heading: NAVEED
dialog: Listen. I understand. You're in

dialog: have to marry a Pakistani girl. Like I
dialog: hung out with other girls. But then I
dialog: married Fatima. We hardly spoke two
dialog: words to each other the first few
dialog: months! But now, Kumi, she's like my
dialog: best friend. You have to break up with
text: her immediately.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: If I find someone who's as good for me
dialog: as Fatima is for you, Mom would
dialog: understand, right? I mean, she wouldn't
dialog: love me less?
speaker_heading: NAVEED
dialog: She would definitely love you less.

speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Uh huh. It tastes like grape juice
dialog: that's gone bad. How do you know so
dialog: much about wine?
dialog: 33
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Um, because, I was pretty unhappy in my
dialog: first marriage and I drank a lot and
dialog: one way to cover drinking is to know a
dialog: lot about wine.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: I'm sorry wait, what did you say?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: That knowing a lot about wine sort of
dialog: covers for drinking a lot.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: No, the huge piece of information
dialog: you're trying to blow right past.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Yeah. I was married.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: You were married?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I was. I was married. Do you want to

speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Yeah, cause I don't really have any
dialog: questions other than...when did you get
dialog: married? When did you get divorced?
dialog: What's his name? How tall is he? Did
dialog: you love him? I guess I have a couple
dialog: of questions.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Uh huh. His name was, is Ryan. We met in
dialog: college. Everyone I knew was getting
dialog: married super young, so we did. And one
dialog: day I was at a restaurant and I saw
dialog: this couple making out and I thought "I
dialog: don't think about my husband like that,
dialog: but I guess that's okay" and then
dialog: another part of my brain was like "NO
dialog: IT'S NOT OKAY THIS IS YOUR LIFE". I
dialog: feel like this is freaking you out.
dialog: Does this freak you out?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: It's not freaking me out.

text: Kumail sits with CJ backstage.
speaker_heading: CJ

dialog: Bob Dalavan's gonna be here on
dialog: Thursday. If you book the Montreal

speaker_heading: KUMAIL

speaker_heading: KHADIJA

text: Kumail sees Bob Dalavan at a table with CJ. Dalavan
text: listens to Kumail's set and seems into it.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: KUMAIL

speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Jessie called me and wanted me to make

speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Oh, no, actually I'd love to go home

speaker_heading: NURSE BETTE
dialog: Sir, can you step outside a moment,
dialog: please? If you want to stay you have to
text: go to the security desk to get a pass.
dialog: 46
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Where is the security desk?
speaker_heading: NURSE BETTE
dialog: It's downstairs. Exactly where you walked
text: in. At the security desk.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
text: The security desk is at the security
dialog: desk. Got it.
scene_heading: INT. EMILY'S ICU ROOM - LATER
text: Emily is propped up. Kumail next to her. He has a badge.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL

scene_heading: DR. WRIGHT
dialog: Are you her husband?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: No--
dialog: 47
scene_heading: DR. WRIGHT
dialog: We need to intubate her immediately. I

dialog: I'm going to ask you again. Are you her
dialog: husband?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: What does "intubate" mean?
scene_heading: DR. WRIGHT
dialog: We have to put her on a respirator and
dialog: to do that we need to put her in a
text: medically induced coma.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Coma.
scene_heading: DR. WRIGHT
dialog: Yes, to stabilize her so we can work on
dialog: the infection. And it needs to happen
dialog: right now. So, I'm going to ask you one
dialog: last time, are you her husband?
text: Kumail signs the forms.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Dr. Wright and Orderlies rush Emily down the hallway on
text: a GURNEY. Kumail runs with them. Trying to keep up.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: What's going on?! Where are you taking
dialog: me?
text: Emily disappears into an OR. Kumail watches DOCTORS and
text: NURSES descend on her. Nurse Judy puts her hand on his
dialog: arm.
speaker_heading: NURSE JUDY
dialog: You should call her family.
scene_heading: INT. EMILY'S ICU ROOM
text: Kumail, freaked out, stares at Emily, hooked up to

speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: I'm sorry.
dialog: 48

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

dialog: Hey, Mrs. Gardner? This is Kumail,
dialog: Emily's friend. I'm so sorry to be
dialog: calling you so late. Emily's fine.
dialog: Just want to get that taken care of.

dialog: together.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: We know who you are Kumail.
text: They're clearly tired, terrified. Nurse Judy enters.
speaker_heading: NURSE JUDY
dialog: Mr. and Mrs. Gardner. The doctors would
dialog: like to see you now.
speaker_heading: BETH

speaker_heading: NURSE JUDY
dialog: Listen, the doctor will be here any
text: minute. She's just running a little
dialog: late. Don't read anything into this
text: being in the bereavement room. It was
dialog: the only room we had available.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Okay. Thank you.
text: She exits. Terry nervously taps on his knees, annoying
dialog: Beth.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Terry, Terry-- it's driving me insane.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I know, I know. But it makes me feel
dialog: better.
text: The doctor walks in.
scene_heading: DR. CUNNINGHAM

dialog: strategy.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: "All the doctors"? How many are there?
scene_heading: DR. CUNNINGHAM
dialog: Five.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Five? Why so many? Is that normal?
speaker_heading: Dr. CUNNINGHAM
dialog: Yes, it's standard with patients in the
dialog: ICU. We come at it from different
dialog: angles--
dialog: 50
dialog: When we cut back it is a different person now. DR.
text: LEWIN. Terry, Kumail and Beth stay but the doctors
dialog: change.
speaker_heading: DR. LEWIN
dialog: We immediately initiated orotracheal
dialog: intubation. Thankfully it hasn't affected
text: her heart at this point.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: DR. WHELAN
dialog: We don't know the exact nature of the
dialog: infection yet, but we've got her on a
dialog: broad spectrum of antibiotics.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: DR. PLATT
text: ...critical infections centering around
dialog: the costodiaphragmatic--
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: DR. SPELLMAN
dialog: Our theory is methicillin-resistant

speaker_heading: (taking NOTES)

text: plugged into the wall. These are the PEOPLE WHO WAIT.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: That was very reassuring, wasn't it?
dialog: Apparently, there are good and bad
dialog: comas. And the kind that they put her
dialog: in, the medically induced ones, are
dialog: definitely the good kind of coma.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 51
speaker_heading: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Like you know how there are good and
dialog: bad carbs. Gremlins, those can be good
dialog: or bad.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Listen, Kumail... We're gonna handle
dialog: things from here. You've been very

speaker_heading: KUMAIL

scene_heading: INT. TRIPLE DOOR - BACKSTAGE - THAT NIGHT
text: Kumail, Mary, Chris, CJ, &amp; Sam sit with notebooks open.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What about this? I saw a sniffer dog at
dialog: the airport get a boner. Does that mean
dialog: drugs or bombs?
speaker_heading: CJ
dialog: That's good. What if instead of it being
dialog: at the airport, you quit comedy and never
dialog: did comedy ever again?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Fuck you. It's a good bit.
speaker_heading: CJ
dialog: Just for the sake of the public. So they
dialog: wouldn't have to look at your face or
dialog: hear your words.
text: Kumail interjects.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: It's okay that I'm not there, right?
dialog: Like, I don't need to be there, right?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What happened?
dialog: 52
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: He put his girlfriend in a coma. You
dialog: know, the way you do.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: He signed a paper that allowed doctors to
dialog: put her--
speaker_heading: CJ
dialog: He suggested it.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: She's gonna be fine. She's gonna be fine.
dialog: They said she's gonna be fine. Doctors
dialog: know medical stuff. That's what doctors
dialog: do. They're good at medical stuff. This
text: is a medically induced coma. This is
dialog: their specialty.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: It might be a good thing. She might wake
dialog: up with a new skill. Like my cousin
dialog: blacked out once and when he came to, he
dialog: thought he knew a different language.
speaker_heading: CJ
dialog: Did he?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: No, it was just gibberish that he made
text: up. It was brain damage.
text: CJ and Mary shake their heads. Kumail looks freaked out.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I got another Taco Bell one...
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM- MONDAY MORNING
text: Terry and Beth wait. Beth is sewing a shirt of Emily's.

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Did you forget something?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Is she up yet?
dialog: 53
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: No, she's not. They won't tell us
dialog: anything. We've been here all morning.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: I know you guys said you don't need me
dialog: to stay, but I think I'm just going to
dialog: wait anyway.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You guys broke up. I'm not sure why
dialog: you're here. You don't have to worry
dialog: about being committed to anything,
dialog: Kumail. You didn't want to when she was
dialog: awake. There's no need to do it when
text: she's unconscious.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: It's more complicated than that--
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Is it? Because I know about the two-day
dialog: rule, I know about the headshots and the
dialog: secrets. She tells us everything.
dialog: (beat, then)
dialog: You really don't have to stay Kumail. You
dialog: have already done a lot.
text: Kumail is speechless. After a beat of awkward quiet--
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: I'm just gonna stay for a second. Is this
dialog: seat- ?
text: Kumail gestures to the empty seat next to Beth, but she
text: throws her sewing on it and turns away.
text: Kumail walks to another row of seats and sits down,
text: facing Emily's parents. Beth watches him intensely for a
text: few beats before Kumail turns to the woman sitting next
text: to him.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Is that lady still looking at me?
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA- LATER
text: Kumail carries his tray, spots Terry and Beth together
text: having a hushed conversation. He sits at a different

dialog: 54
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: No reason you should eat there by
dialog: yourself. Right, hon?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (barely looks up)
dialog: It's a free country.
text: Kumail nods. Sits down. They eat. It's awkward.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: How's your sandwich?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Best fuckin' sandwich I've ever had.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Mine's good. Tuna's always a gamble.
dialog: You know, we're not by the water. Well,
text: we are by the water, but it's a lake.
dialog: There's no tuna in the lake. Whatever.
dialog: I threw the dice. I got the 7's, I
dialog: guess. Whatever the good dice number
dialog: is.
dialog: More silence.
speaker_heading: TERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: So, uh, 9/11?
text: Blank looks from Kumail and Beth.
speaker_heading: TERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: No, I mean, I've always wanted to have a
dialog: conversation about it with...people.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: You've never talked to people about 9/11?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: No, uh, what's your stance?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: What's my stance on 9/11? Oh, ummmm...
dialog: Anti. It was a tragedy.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I mean we lost 19 of our best guys.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Huh?
dialog: 55
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: That was a joke, obviously. 9/11 was a
dialog: terrible tragedy, and it's not funny to
dialog: joke about it.
text: Beth and Terry are PAGED on the intercom. They quickly
text: gather up their things and get up to leave.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, can I come?
speaker_heading: TERRY BETH
dialog: Yeah. No.

speaker_heading: BETH

scene_heading: DR. CUNNINGHAM
dialog: I know this isn't the news you were
dialog: hoping for but we aren't ready to bring
text: Emily out of the coma yet.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Oh. I-
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: What happened?
scene_heading: DR. CUNNINGHAM
dialog: The antibiotics aren't doing exactly
dialog: what we'd hoped they would, and we
dialog: don't want to mess around. So we're
dialog: going to perform surgery tomorrow
dialog: morning to remove the infection.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Wait a second- Dr. Spellman told us
dialog: that the antibiotics would work. He
dialog: didn't say anything at all about
dialog: surgery.
dialog: 56
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: What does that mean? What kind of
dialog: surgery?
scene_heading: DR. CUNNINGHAM
dialog: It's called thoracentesis, it's a very
dialog: common procedure. We're going to go in
dialog: between the ribs and remove the
dialog: infection.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (scribbling in his notebook)
dialog: How do you spell that please? Thora- ?
dialog: What's the last part?
scene_heading: DR. CUNNINGHAM
dialog: -Centesis.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: And where is the infection?
scene_heading: DR. CUNNINGHAM
text: On the lung.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What's the risk?
scene_heading: DR. CUNNINGHAM
dialog: Low. My advice to you is that you go
dialog: home, you get something to eat, and try
dialog: to relax.
scene_heading: INT. KUMAIL'S CAR - NIGHT

speaker_heading: BETH (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm gonna do some research.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Oh hey, that's the book I gave her.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: No, I gave her that one. Hey, do you
dialog: have that little notebook from the
dialog: doctors?
text: Terry hands her the notebook.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: No, this is the book I gave her.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: I'm just gonna clean up Emily's rooms
dialog: real quick.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I remember. I met her at the falafel
dialog: place and then we went to that book store
dialog: that's hardly ever open and I bought it
dialog: for her.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: You're not the only one who gives her
dialog: things.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What's up with you?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I'm just tired of you thinking that
dialog: you're the only one who gives her things.
dialog: I gave her that book.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Look at the inscription.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: No. That's stupid.

scene_heading: INT. EMILY'S BEDROOM- SAME

speaker_heading: KUMAIL

speaker_heading: TERRY

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: You ever played You Can't Rhyme It?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL

speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Ok, Stonehenge.

dialog: I don't know, Terry. But 17th is bad.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: It's not great, unless the sample size
dialog: is, you know, that all depends.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Here, look at the comments.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: This is why I don't want to go online
dialog: cause it's never good. You go online,
dialog: they hated Forrest Gump. Frickin' best
dialog: movie ever.

scene_heading: DR. CUNNINGHAM
dialog: Terry - Hi. Can we talk?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yeah.
scene_heading: DR. CUNNINGHAM
dialog: We got the biopsy results. They are
dialog: unfortunately inconclusive. We are
dialog: concerned-
text: Music drowns out the rest of their conversation as Terry
text: looks increasingly distraught.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - LATER
text: Terry speaks with Beth and Kumail.
dialog: 78
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: They couldn't find out what the disease
dialog: was, or where the virus came from or
dialog: the bacteria or whatever.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: But they took out the infection so it
dialog: shouldn't matter?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I know, that's what I said but her
dialog: vitals didn't normalize. And now they
dialog: say that the infection is continuing to
text: spread, it's in her kidneys.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: But the kidneys are so far from the
dialog: lungs.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I know, it's an aggressive infection
dialog: and they said what they gotta do now is
dialog: figure out what this mystery disease
dialog: actually is.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I'm calling Northwestern.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Just hold on, hold on.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Terry! Goddammit!
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: I think we should talk about this--
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: --You shut up! I'm sick of this shit,
dialog: Terry. We're getting her out of here!
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: They're in the middle of the whole
dialog: process of elimination.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: So you're saying Northwestern can't
dialog: take that information and continue the
dialog: search? This place is a shithole.
text: She looks towards the other people in the waiting room.
speaker_heading: BETH (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry. Anna, could I have that?
dialog: 79
text: She takes her bag from Anna.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Will you just stop for a second? They're
dialog: the doctors. You act like you know what
dialog: you're talking about. You don't.
text: Beth searches in her bag.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I can't find my cellphone. You got a
dialog: phone?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Don't give her a phone. You don't need a
dialog: phone. You don't need to call anybody
dialog: right now.
text: Kumail takes out his phone, hands it to Beth. She starts
text: fiddling with it.
speaker_heading: TERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: They're doing it. They're the experts
dialog: here, and I trust them.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Well that's very nice. But I don't. Can
dialog: you unlock that thing?
text: Beth hands the phone back to Kumail, he unlocks it, hands
dialog: it back.
speaker_heading: BETH (CONT'D)
dialog: There's a reason why they're #17 and
dialog: Northwestern's #1. And it's not because
dialog: people trust them!
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Oh - you think that you're smarter than
dialog: me because you say big sentences. Well
dialog: you're not!
text: Kumail is trying to give them space, unsure what to do.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I don't think I'm smarter than you! You
dialog: just don't think you're as smart as I
dialog: am! That's not my fault!
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Right. It's never your fault.
dialog: Everything's my fault.
dialog: 80
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Oh there are some things that are
dialog: definitely just your fault.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Okay, that's bullshit. You need to stop
text: freaking out and calm down.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: And you need to stop being a coward.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Greatest hits, coming back. You can
dialog: stop, I'll replay the rest of this from
dialog: memory.

text: smiles.
speaker_heading: NURSE JUDY
dialog: Oh, you're giraffe-ing it.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: It was the biggest thing they had. I
dialog: don't even know if she likes giraffes. We
dialog: never talked about giraffes. Hey, do
dialog: they know what they're doing? Cause
dialog: they don't tell us anything. Like, Lyme
dialog: Disease? You know the girl on The Real
dialog: World had it? Did you guys look for
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: NURSE JUDY
dialog: Yes, we did.
dialog: 81
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Did you know she gets hurt all the
dialog: time? She messed up her ankle recently -
dialog: could that be Lupus?
speaker_heading: NURSE JUDY
dialog: Kumail. We're looking into everything.
dialog: We're not holding anything back from
dialog: you. We're still just eliminating
dialog: possibilities.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Cause Beth wants to move her to
dialog: Northwestern.
speaker_heading: NURSE JUDY
dialog: Oh no. Emily should not be moved. The
dialog: hospital will approve it because it'll
dialog: get the liability off their hands, but
dialog: we put her in a coma for a reason. To
dialog: stabilize her. Moving her could be very
dialog: dangerous. The infection could spread.
dialog: Trust me she is fighting. And so are
dialog: we.
text: Kumail looks frightened.
scene_heading: INT. WAITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Terry balls up his coat to use as a pillow, trying to
text: get comfortable. Kumail enters. TERRY sees him and sits
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Hey Terry. I was just talking to the
dialog: nurse - You okay?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yeah, of course. Totally fine.
text: Terry's eyes are very puffy and red.
speaker_heading: TERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Beth went to Emily's, so I'm gonna wait
dialog: here until they kick me out. Keep an
text: eye on her.
text: Long pause. Terry and Kumail staring at one another.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Do you wanna crash at my place?

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: You got the golf channel?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: That wasn't funny, right?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: I thought that was a serious question.
speaker_heading: TERRY

scene_heading: INT. KUMAIL'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: Kumail and Terry walk in.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Wow...this place is terrible.
scene_heading: INT. KUMAIL'S BEDROOM - LATER
text: Kumail and Terry lay on separate air mattresses.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Hey I talked to Nurse Judy, and she was
dialog: saying that moving Emily could be a bad
dialog: idea.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Yeah, she said it could be dangerous.
text: Terry listens but doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Like...
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: No. Yeah. I hear you. I'd give anything
dialog: to trade places with Emily. Being a
dialog: parent, it's a nightmare. Loving
dialog: somebody this much sucks.
dialog: 83
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Yeah.
text: Kumail's not sure what to say.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: And I guess you've noticed some tension
dialog: between Beth and me.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Not really. That's none of my business.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yeah well, it's there. Big time.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: It's getting really late. We should go
dialog: to sleep.
text: Kumail turns off the light. A beat of quiet in the dark.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I cheated on her.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Fuuuuck.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I did. It was just a one night stand.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: We met at some bar in Cincinnati. They
dialog: have these teacher conferences. Who
dialog: goes to a math conference to get laid?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Math teachers?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yeah. I think I was depressed, that's
dialog: what it was.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Yeah. Let's talk about it tomorrow. Get a
dialog: full night's sleep. Catch up fresh in the-
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: She just smelled so good. It was horrible
dialog: too. As soon as I was finished. As soon
dialog: as I'd finished, I was like, what did you
dialog: fucking do?! What did you just do?!
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 84
speaker_heading: TERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: What did you do?! You know that moment of
dialog: clarity you get right after an orgasm?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I told Beth right away. I had to. She
dialog: was devastated. Now she hates me.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: She might be mad at you, but she doesn't
dialog: hate you. You should've heard the way she
dialog: was talking about you. Hey, can I ask you
dialog: something? Why did you tell her?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Oh, I had to. I'm no good with guilt.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Do you guys talk about it?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Not anymore. She said she forgave me,
dialog: but no. She hasn't. Let me give you
dialog: some advice Kumail. You're going to
dialog: know the woman you want to spend the
dialog: rest of your life with when you cheat
dialog: on her. When you cheat on her and you
dialog: just feel like shit.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: So, to fully know I love someone, I
dialog: have to cheat on them?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Out loud it sounds stupid. Yeah, that's
dialog: terrible advice.
text: Terry is clearly fraught.
speaker_heading: TERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Love isn't easy. That's why they call
dialog: it love.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: I don't really get that either.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I know. I thought I could just start
dialog: saying something and something smart
dialog: would come out.

scene_heading: INT. KUMAIL'S BEDROOM - MORNING

speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Hey did you see Terry?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: No, I heard him leave this morning. I'm

speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: No, I'm good, thank you.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You don't want a hot dog or nothing?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Dude it's 8:30 in the morning.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Okay, no hot dog.
text: Chris opens the door to leave as Azmat and Sharmeen

speaker_heading: SHARMEEN
dialog: We just spoke to Khadija's parents.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: SHARMEEN
dialog: What is wrong with you, Kumi?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Nothing is wrong with me. I'm sorry-
speaker_heading: SHARMEEN
dialog: Sorry? That's all you have to say?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: I wasn't that into her.
dialog: 86
speaker_heading: SHARMEEN
dialog: "Into her"? Do you know how difficult
dialog: it is to get an appointment with her?
text: She is in very high demand.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Okay. So?
speaker_heading: SHARMEEN
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Can we please talk about this another
dialog: time?
speaker_heading: SHARMEEN
dialog: No, no, Kumi. We will talk about this
dialog: now. We have sacrificed everything for
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: I know, okay?
speaker_heading: SHARMEEN
dialog: We have left our family. We have left
dialog: our home. I have missed the birth of my
dialog: sister's daughter. I have not seen my
dialog: mother for fifteen years. Your father,
dialog: he had to do his graduate school.
dialog: Again. He had to give exams. Again.
speaker_heading: AZMAT
dialog: I was in my mid 50's. They were in 20s.
dialog: They used to call me Father Time!
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: I know that. I really appreciate
dialog: everything you did for me, but can we
dialog: talk about this another time?
speaker_heading: SHARMEEN
dialog: Kumi, if you don't want to be a lawyer,
dialog: fine. If you want to do the stand-up
dialog: comedy and embarrass us as a family,
dialog: fine. There is only one thing that we
dialog: have ever asked from you: that you be a
dialog: good Muslim and that you marry a
dialog: Pakistani girl. That is it, one thing!
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Can I ask you something that has never
dialog: made sense to me? Why did you bring me
dialog: here if you wanted me to not have an
dialog: American life?
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 87
speaker_heading: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
dialog: We come here but we pretend like we're
dialog: still back there? That's so stupid!
speaker_heading: AZMAT
dialog: Don't you talk to your mother like
dialog: that!
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: You don't care what I think. You just
dialog: want me to follow the rules. But the
dialog: rules don't make sense to me. I don't
dialog: pray. I don't. I haven't prayed in
dialog: years. I just go down there and I play
dialog: video games.
speaker_heading: AZMAT
dialog: You don't believe in Allah?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: I don't know what I believe, Dad! I
dialog: don't know. And I can't marry someone
dialog: you find for me.
speaker_heading: SHARMEEN
dialog: And why not?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Because I'm in love with someone. I am.
dialog: Her name is Emily and she's gonna be a
dialog: therapist. And right now she's very
dialog: sick but I couldn't tell you that. It
dialog: makes me so sad that I couldn't tell
dialog: you any of that. I really appreciate
dialog: everything you've done for me. I truly,
dialog: truly do. And I know Islam has been
dialog: really good for you, it has made you
dialog: good people, but I don't know what I
dialog: believe. I just need to figure it out
dialog: on my own.
speaker_heading: SHARMEEN
dialog: You're not my son.
text: Sharmeen turns her back on Kumail and heads towards the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: AZMAT
dialog: Kumi, you're being selfish. You're not
dialog: thinking about us. You're not thinking
dialog: about Khadija. In fact you're not even
dialog: thinking about that girl that you are in
dialog: love with. You think American Dream is
dialog: just about doing whatever you want and
dialog: not thinking about other people?
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 88
speaker_heading: AZMAT (CONT'D)
dialog: You're wrong! You are wrong!
text: Sharmeen and Azmat leave. Chris comes back in.
speaker_heading: CHRIS

scene_heading: INT. WAITING ROOM - LATER

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: We're gonna move her.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: What? What are you talking about? You
dialog: fucking caved?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I didn't cave. I don't cave.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Okay, okay. I know you don't cave. You're
dialog: great. But we talked about this last
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I know. We're moving her. She's right.
text: Terry walks towards Beth as Kumail follows.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: What? No. I told you what the nurse
dialog: said. Hey Beth, the nurse told me that
dialog: moving Emily could be a very bad idea.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Well Northwestern told us it could be
dialog: very good.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Well, they don't see her. This nurse
dialog: sees her and she told me herself.
dialog: 89
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: It's okay. They don't need to see her.
text: Beth and Terry gather their things to leave, and Kumail

speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: It's not okay. There. I got it!
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: That's a map of the garage.

speaker_heading: KUMAIL

dialog: her. I hurt her. She loves birds. Like
text: she gets excited every time she sees a

scene_heading: EXT. HALLWAY - SAME
text: Cunningham speaks with Terry and Beth.
scene_heading: DR. CUNNINGHAM
dialog: Emily has a rare condition called Adult
dialog: Onset Still's disease. Kumail mentioned
text: Emily's hurt ankle and the swelling
dialog: still hadn't gone down even after
text: several days in bed, which is strange.
dialog: Still's disease is when the body thinks
dialog: healthy tissue is an infection so it
text: tries to fight it. It's like a big
dialog: biological misunderstanding.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yeah, yeah.
speaker_heading: DR CUNNINGHAM
dialog: We gave her anti-inflammatories and she
dialog: stabilized within hours. She's gonna
dialog: take time to recover but she'll be

speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: I was visiting someone down the hall and
dialog: I was like, I'll just pop in and say hi
dialog: to Emily.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: No, I'm joking, I was here for you.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: You're an asshole and I don't like you.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: I'm not an asshole. I'm really not.
dialog: 97
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: No, you're an asshole.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: You have a lot of drugs in you so you're
text: not thinking as clearly.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Naw dog. I'm not joking. You're not funny
dialog: to me. You just make me sad. You make me
dialog: sad inside of my heart, and it makes me
dialog: sad to look at you. So I think you should
dialog: probably go. Just go and tell my mom I
dialog: want her.
text: Kumail doesn't know what to say.
speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT'D)
dialog: Will you please get my mom?
text: Kumail nods and heads out to the hallway.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Emily wants to see you.
text: Beth goes back inside Emily's room.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm gonna head out. I don't think I
dialog: should be here.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Alright, Kumail. Here's the thing. Your
dialog: living condition is a potential health
dialog: risk and you're not that funny. But....
dialog: you're probably not suited to do
dialog: anything else either so that's
dialog: troublesome--
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: You really made it sound like you were
dialog: going to say something positive there.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I guess I did, didn't I? You know I
dialog: know the good stuff. You know how I

speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: So you gonna hang around Chicago for a

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Yeah. She's got physical therapy.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Did you ever think you'd be excited to
dialog: have your daughter go through physical
dialog: therapy?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's so strange that we could go
dialog: through one of the most intense
dialog: experiences of our lives together and
dialog: just never see each other again.

speaker_heading: BETH

dialog: us.
dialog: 99
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Are you serious?
speaker_heading: CJ
dialog: You gotta do it. It's going to suck at
dialog: first but we'll have each other and
dialog: maybe eventually get paid to write
dialog: jokes. It's gonna be the best. Come on
dialog: dude.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You have to come. I know you did not
dialog: get Montreal and that is only because
dialog: you did one of the worst sets I've ever
dialog: seen in my goddamn life.
speaker_heading: CJ
dialog: It was nonsense.
speaker_heading: MARY
text: A living disgrace.
speaker_heading: CJ
dialog: I would call it shit, but I would be
dialog: worried that I'd be insulting actual
dialog: shit.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Yeah, it was so bone-chilling to me, I
dialog: thought a ghost had passed right through
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: We don't have to keep going over how bad
dialog: the set was. I saw their faces and the
text: noises they didn't make.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I felt one of my eggs die.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Doesn't that happen every month?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: It happens every month, Kumail, but I
dialog: don't always feel it and go, ohhhhh. And
dialog: that's what you made me do. I'm packing
dialog: my things up and I'm moving to New York,
dialog: and guess what, baby? You're coming with
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: What about Chris?
dialog: 100

speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: TERRY

text: Emily clocks Kumail as he WALKS IN holding a large bag.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: (leans over to Beth)
dialog: Why is Kumail here?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Cause he was there the whole time. I

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Emily, come on up here. I wanna say

speaker_heading: TERRY (CONT'D)

text: Kumail finally approaches Emily.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Hey. I like your cane. I've heard

speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Hey, can we talk for a second?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Sure.
scene_heading: INT. EMILY'S BEDROOM- CONTINUOUS
text: They walk in. Lots of jackets on the bed.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: So, I've been collecting some things
dialog: that are important to me and I wanted
dialog: to show them to you. I call this my bag
dialog: of devotion.
text: Kumail presents the BIG BAG and starts to take items
text: out. He holds up a bunch of HOSPITAL PASSES.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
dialog: This is all the visitor passes from
dialog: when I visited you when you were in the-
text: He holds up some TICKET STUBS.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
dialog: These are the ticket stubs from when
dialog: your parents came to see me perform and
dialog: I realized how great they are, and how
dialog: great you are, and how great honesty
dialog: is.
text: He holds up a JAR FULL OF ASHES.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: What did you do? Did you cremate
dialog: someone?
dialog: 102
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: These are the ashes of all the
dialog: Pakistani women - not the women - the
dialog: pictures of the Pakistani women. I
dialog: thought this was a good idea, but it
dialog: feels a little stupid.
text: Kumail puts the items down and kneels before Emily.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
dialog: I know I was a terrible boyfriend. But
dialog: I've changed. And I am the person you
dialog: need me to be. I really am. So, will
dialog: you take me back?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Kumail, I'm really glad that you went
dialog: through this experience, but you have
dialog: to understand that all that happened
dialog: while I was asleep. Like you felt one
dialog: way a few weeks ago and now you're
dialog: saying you feel the total opposite way
dialog: and the only thing that's changed is
dialog: that I was in a coma. Honestly, I look
dialog: at all of this, and I just think, I
dialog: can't do it again. I can't be the
dialog: reason that you don't have a family. It
dialog: just feels totally different now. And I
dialog: can't do that again. Do you understand?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Okay.

text: dinner. Kumail joins them. We see he has another LARGE
speaker_heading: BAG.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Ma. Dad. Fatima. Bhai. There's no
dialog: plate. Oh I forgot. I've decided I
dialog: won't let you kick me out of the
dialog: family. Since I am a member of the
dialog: family, it would stand to reason that I
dialog: would get a vote in whether or not I
dialog: get kicked out, and that vote would
dialog: have to be unanimous. Standard
dialog: parliamentary procedure. So all those
dialog: in favor of not kicking Kumail out of
dialog: the family, raise your hand.
text: Kumail raises his hand. Everyone else stares silently.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Great. Motion to kick Kumail out of the
dialog: family, denied. So you guys can just
dialog: talk to me.
text: Everyone is silent.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, you're giving me the silent
dialog: treatment. I figured that was what was
dialog: going to happen. I have a solution.
text: Kumail pulls out cue cards from his bag and shows them.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
dialog: "Hi. How are you?" It's just a real
dialog: basic one. "Pass the salt." Practical.
dialog: "Always with the comedy." Mom, made
dialog: that one specially for you. "Kumail,
dialog: how did you become so much more
dialog: handsome than your brother Naveed?"
dialog: 104
speaker_heading: NAVEED
dialog: Bullshit.
text: Naveed and Azmat exchange a look.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: I admit this one is designed to stir up
dialog: some controversy. "It's interesting how
dialog: you can't really kick someone out of your
dialog: family because they'll always be your
dialog: family." I agree with that one. It's a
dialog: good one. So, I'm gonna leave these here
dialog: for you.
text: Kumail leaves the cards on the dining table.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry I lied about the girls and
dialog: the LSAT and all of that. That was
dialog: wrong. And one more thing: I'm moving
dialog: to New York to pursue stand-up, but I
dialog: am not leaving this family.

dialog: My parents want me to get arrange
dialog: married. Or as it's called in Pakistan,
dialog: romance! Earlier today, I told them
dialog: everything. I told them about my life. I
dialog: told them about Emily. They kicked me out
dialog: of the family. I may never talk to them
dialog: again. So that happened -

dialog: different about everything. Like
dialog: cherish every sunrise. And for the most
dialog: part I just feel like, ugh I can't get

speaker_heading: KUMAIL

speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL

speaker_heading: EMILY

speaker_heading: AZMAT
dialog: You are still kicked out of the family,

speaker_heading: KUMAIL

dialog: to be Thanksgiving. On my first day in
dialog: America, my uncle took me to the Macy's
dialog: Thanksgiving Day Parade and I was like,
dialog: this is every day in America! As
dialog: advertised. Every day they have a party
dialog: celebrating Garfield. No day has lived
dialog: up to that day. So I was lying to my
dialog: parents, I was telling them I was gonna
dialog: be a lawyer. And they're very
dialog: disappointed cause they wanted me to be
dialog: a doctor. And you guys are like, why
dialog: didn't you just tell them that you
dialog: wanted to be a doctor?
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 113
speaker_heading: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
dialog: It's a lie anyway. And I'm like, well it
dialog: has to be believable. If I told them I
dialog: want to be a doctor, they'd be like,
dialog: "bullshit." If I say lawyer, they're
dialog: like, "oh, ok, that's something." Cause
dialog: there's a strict hierarchy: doctor,
dialog: engineer, lawyer, hundreds of jobs,
dialog: ISIS, then comedian.

dialog: Uhh. I'm sorry. It's very rude to
dialog: heckle comedians.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Oh that wasn't a heckle. I just kind of
dialog: woo-hooed you.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Well see that's a common misconception.
dialog: Heckling doesn't have to be negative.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: So if I was like, oh my god, you're
dialog: amazing in bed! That would be a heckle?
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Yeah, and now you're getting more laughs
dialog: than me, and I don't like that. Do you
dialog: want to come up, do my job? Are you from
dialog: out of town, m'am?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Chicago.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
dialog: Ooh Windy City. And what brings you to

speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I'm here to see someone.
speaker_heading: KUMAIL
