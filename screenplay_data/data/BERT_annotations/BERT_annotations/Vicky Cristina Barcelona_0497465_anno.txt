dialog: which she then hated, had just
dialog: broken up with yet another
dialog: boyfriend, and longed for a change

speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.0.) (cont'd)

speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.0.) (cont'd)

speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.0.)
dialog: Cristina, on the other hand,
dialog: expected something very different
dialog: out of love. She had reluctantly
dialog: accepted suffering as an inevitable
dialog: component of deep passion, and was
dialog: resigned to putting her feelings at
dialog: risk. If you asked her what it was
dialog: she was gambling her emotions on to

text: Cristina takes a pin out of her hair and lets it fall down
text: around her shoulders.
speaker_heading: VICKY

dialog: to fly to Oviedo and back?
speaker_heading: JUAN ANTONIO
dialog: Mm...no, we’ll spend the weekend. I
dialog: mean, I’1l1 show you around the city

dialog: good wine, we’1ll make love.
text: Vicky stares at Juan Antonio as Cristina smiles.
speaker_heading: VICKY

speaker_heading: JUAN ANTONIO
dialog: I’1l get your bill.

speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: Jesus, this guy, he doesn’t beat
dialog: around the bush. Look, senor, maybe
dialog: in a different life.
speaker_heading: JUAN ANTONIO
dialog: Mm-hm? Why not? Life is short. Life
dialog: is dull. Life is full of pain. And
dialog: this is a chance for something
dialog: special.
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: Right, well, who-who exactly are
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: JUAN ANTONIO
dialog: I am Juan Antonio. And you are...
dialog: (to Vicky)
dialog: ...Vicky...
dialog: (to Cristina)
dialog: ...and you are Cristina. Right? Or
dialog: is it the other way around?
speaker_heading: CRISTINA
dialog: Yeah, that’s right.
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: Yeah, I mean, eh, you know, it
dialog: could be the other way around
dialog: because, frankly, it doesn’t matter
dialog: because either of us will do to
dialog: keep the bed warm. You know, I, I
dialog: get it.
speaker_heading: JUAN ANTONIO
dialog: Well, you are both so lovely and
dialog: beautiful.
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: Yeah, thank you, but we do not fly
dialog: off to make love with whoever
dialog: invites us to charming little
dialog: Spanish towns.
speaker_heading: JUAN ANTONIO
dialog: (to Cristina)
dialog: Does she always analyze every
dialog: inspiration until each grain of
dialog: charm is...uh...como se dice, eh
text: squeezed out of it.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: CRISTINA
dialog: I guess I have to say that, um...My
text: eyes are green, actually.
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: Oh, God, look, I wouldn’t call our
dialog: reluctance to leap at your sexual
dialog: offer being over-analytical. If you
dialog: would care to join us for some
dialog: recognized form of social
text: interaction, like a drink, then
dialog: we'd be fine, but otherwise, I
dialog: think you should try, you know,
text: offering to some other table.
speaker_heading: JUAN ANTONIO
dialog: Mm-hm. what offended you about the
dialog: offer? Surely not that I find you
text: both beautiful and desirable.
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: Offended me, no. It’s very amusing,
dialog: galling, to be honest, but, uh, the-
text: Vicky looks at Cristina, then checks her wristwatch.
speaker_heading: VICKY (cont’d)
dialog: (to Cristina)
dialog: Is it my imagination or is it
dialog: getting a little late? Shall we go?
text: Cristina smiles at Juan Antonio.
speaker_heading: CRISTINA
dialog: I would love to go to Oviedo.
text: Vicky looks at Cristina with disbelief.
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: What? Are you kidding? Can we
dialog: discuss this?
text: Cristina shakes her head at Vicky.
speaker_heading: CRISTINA
dialog: I think it would be so much fun. I
dialog: think we should go.
dialog: (to Juan Antonio)
dialog: I would love to go.
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: Cristina, can we discuss this some
dialog: other time when--?
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: JUAN ANTONIO
dialog: (to Cristina)
dialog: You know, when I saw you across the
dialog: room at the art gallery, I noticed
dialog: you have beautiful lips. Very full,
dialog: very sensual.
speaker_heading: CRISTINA
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: Okay, okay, look. I’m sure...You
dialog: know, if you wanna go--
speaker_heading: CRISTINA
dialog: (to Juan Antonio)
dialog: Well, I can’t guarantee the
dialog: lovemaking because I happen to very
dialog: moody.
text: Juan Antonio shakes his head.
speaker_heading: JUAN ANTONIO
dialog: Let’s not negotiate like a
dialog: contract. I came over here with no
dialog: subterfuge and presented my best
dialog: offer. Now I hope you will discuss
dialog: it and give me the pleasure to take
dialog: you with me to Oviedo. I have the
dialog: good fortune to borrow my friend’s
dialog: plane. It’s just big enough for the
dialog: three of us and I’m a very good
dialog: pilot.
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: Right. Oh, it sounds very safe.
speaker_heading: JUAN ANTONIO
dialog: Think it over.
text: Juan Antonio walks away from the table, leaving Vicky and
text: Cristina to discuss his proposition.
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: I hope you’re joking about going.
speaker_heading: CRISTINA
dialog: Oh my God, this guy is so
dialog: interesting.
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: Interesting? Are you kidding?
dialog: What’s so interesting?
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: VICKY(cont'd)
dialog: He wants to get us both into bed.
dialog: You know, but he’1l settle for
dialog: either. In this case, you.
text: Vicky sighs.
speaker_heading: CRISTINA
dialog: Vicky, I’m a big girl, okay? If I
dialog: want to sleep with him, I will. If
dialog: not, I won’t.
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: Cristina, he’s a total stranger
dialog: This is impulsive, even for you
dialog: and, if I heard right, he-he was
text: violent with his wife.
speaker_heading: CRISTINA
dialog: Well at least he’s not one of those
dialog: factory-made zombies, you know? I
dialog: mean, this would be a great way to

speaker_heading: CRISTINA
dialog: Look, you got to admire his no-
dialog: bullshit approach.
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: What are you talking about? It’s
dialog: all bullshit. I’m not going to

speaker_heading: CRISTINA

dialog: language, and that’s an important
dialog: point with my father, actually.
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: Oh, really? It is? Why?
speaker_heading: JUAN ANTONIO
dialog: Because he’s a poet and he writes
dialog: the most beautiful sentences in the

dialog: know -- he doesn’t believe that a
dialog: poet should pollute his words by
dialog: any other tongue which is quite a--
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: Right, right. No, it makes sense. I

speaker_heading: JUAN ANTONIO

speaker_heading: JUAN ANTONIO
dialog: Well, because he hates the world,

speaker_heading: VICKY

dialog: love one afternoon? Beforehand,
dialog: she gave them both her blessing,
dialog: but then had mixed feelings. She

speaker_heading: CRISTINA
