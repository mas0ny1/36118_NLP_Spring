scene_heading: EXT. CENTENNIAL LANE - DUSK
text: JUNO MacGUFF stands on a placid street in a nondescript
text: subdivision, facing the curb. It's FALL. Juno is sixteen
text: years old, an artfully bedraggled burnout kid. She winces
text: and shields her eyes from the glare of the sun. The object
text: of her rapt attention is a battered living room set, abandoned
text: curbside by its former owners. There is a fetid-looking
text: leather recliner, a chrome-edged coffee table, and a tasteless
text: latchhooked rug featuring a roaring tiger.
speaker_heading: JUNO (V.O.)
text: It started with a chair.
scene_heading: INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - MOLD-O'-RIFFIC BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: FLASHBACK - Juno approaches a boy hidden by shadow. He's
text: sitting in an overstuffed chair. She slowly, clumsily lowers
text: herself onto his lap.
text: A 60's Brazilian track plays from a vintage record player.
speaker_heading: WHISPERED VOICE
dialog: Do you know how long I've wanted
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: WHISPERED VOICE
dialog: Wizard.
scene_heading: EXT. CENTENNIAL LANE - CONTINUED
text: A DOG barks, jarring Juno back to reality.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Quiet, Banana. Hey, shut your gob
dialog: for a second, okay?
text: We see a teacup poodle tethered in the yard a few feet away
text: from the abandoned living room set. The dog yaps again.
speaker_heading: JUNO (V.O.)
dialog: This is the most magnificent discarded
dialog: living room set I've ever seen.
text: She swigs from an absurdly oversized carton of juice and
text: wipes her mouth with the back of her hand.
scene_heading: BEGIN ANIMATED TITLE SEQUENCE:
text: Juno marching down various street, pumping her arms like a
text: jogger and chugging intermittently from the huge carton of
text: juice. We watch her breathlessly navigate suburbia, clearly
text: on a mission.
scene_heading: EXT. DRUGSTORE - DAY
text: Finally, a panting Juno arrives at DANCING ELK DRUG on the
text: main drag of her small Minnesota suburb, Dancing Elk.
text: The automatic doors of the store part to reveal Juno's flushed
text: serious face. She carelessly flings the empty juice container
text: over her shoulder and onto the curb. A group of DROPOUTS
text: with skateboards near the entrance glare at her.
text: She enters the DRUGSTORE.
scene_heading: INT. DRUGSTORE - CONTINUOUS
text: ROLLO, the eccentric drugstore clerk, sneers at Juno from
text: behind the counter. He wears a polyester uniform vest.
speaker_heading: ROLLO
dialog: Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the
dialog: Crime Dog! Back for another test?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I think the last one was defective.
text: The plus sign looked more like a
dialog: division sign.
text: Rollo regards her with intense skepticism.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I remain unconvinced.
text: Rollo pulls the bathroom key out of reach.
speaker_heading: ROLLO
dialog: This is your third test today, Mama
dialog: Bear. Your eggo is preggo, no doubt
dialog: about it!
text: An eavesdropping TOUGH GIRL wearing an oversized jacket and
text: lots of makeup gapes at Juno from the beauty aisle.
speaker_heading: TOUGH GIRL
dialog: Three times? Oh girl, you are way
dialog: pregnant. It's easy to tell. Is your
dialog: nipples real brown?
text: A pile of stolen COSMETICS falls out of the girl's jacket
text: and clatters to the floor.
speaker_heading: TOUGH GIRL
dialog: Balls!
text: Juno crosses and crosses her legs awkwardly, hopping. It's
text: obvious she has to use the bathroom urgently.
speaker_heading: ROLLO
dialog: Maybe you're having twins. Maybe
dialog: your little boyfriend's got mutant
dialog: sperms and he knocked you up twice!
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Silencio! I just drank my weight in
dialog: Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto.
text: Rollo sighs and slips her the bathroom key. Juno races down
text: one of the aisles.
speaker_heading: ROLLO
dialog: Well, you know where the lavatory
dialog: is.
dialog: (calling after her)
dialog: You pay for that pee stick when you're
dialog: done! Don't think it's yours just
dialog: because you've marked it with your
dialog: urine!
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Jesus, I didn't say it was.
speaker_heading: ROLLO
dialog: Well, it's not. You're not a lion in
dialog: a pride!
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: These kids, acting like lions with
dialog: their unplanned pregnancies and their
dialog: Sunny Delights.
scene_heading: INT. DRUGSTORE - BATHROOM - DAY
text: In the dim, reeking public bathroom, Juno hovers over the
text: commode with her boxer shorts around her ankles. She clumsily
text: tries to use the pregnancy test.
text: We see the test box sitting on the sink. It's a TeenWave
text: Discount Pregnancy Test. The accompanying outdated package
text: photo is of a shrugging 80s teen with a resigned expression.
text: The fine print on the box reads "From the makers of Sun-Glitz
dialog: Lightening Hair Spritz!"
scene_heading: INT. DRUGSTORE - FRONT COUNTER - DAY
text: Juno holds the developing test in her hand and slaps the
text: open test box on the front counter. Rollo scans it and bags
text: it indifferently.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Oh, and this too.
text: She places a giant licorice Super Rope on the counter.
speaker_heading: ROLLO
dialog: So what's the prognosis, Fertile
dialog: Myrtle? Minus or plus?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (examining stick)
dialog: I don't know. It's not... seasoned
dialog: yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that
dialog: pink plus sign again. God, it's
dialog: unholy.
text: She shakes the stick desperately in an attempt to skew the
dialog: results. Shake. Shake. Nothing.
speaker_heading: ROLLO
dialog: That ain't no Etch-a-Sketch. This is
text: one doodle that can't be undid,
dialog: homeskillet.
scene_heading: EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - EVENING
text: Juno walks slowly and dejectedly up the street to her house,
text: gnawing on the Super Rope. She stops and loops the Super
text: Rope over a low-hanging tree branch, contemplating how to
dialog: fashion a noose.
text: Juno trudges toward her HOUSE. The yard is a wild tangle of
text: prairie grass and wild flowers.
scene_heading: INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - JUNO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Juno's BEDROOM is decorated with punk posters: The Damned,
dialog: The Germs, the Stooges, Television, Richard Hell, etc. She
text: picks up a hamburger-shaped phone to call her best friend,
speaker_heading: LEAH.
scene_heading: INT. LEAH'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: LEAH's room is cluttered with the sentimental junk that
text: certain girls love to hoard. The PHONE rings.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: (answering phone)
dialog: Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I am a suicide risk.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Is this Juno?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones
dialog: that need collecting?
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Only the one in my pants.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (in low tones)
dialog: Dude, I'm pregnant.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you
dialog: have a big lunch?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: It's not a food baby. I took three
dialog: pregnancy tests today. I am definitely
text: up the spout.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: How did you even generate enough pee
dialog: for three pregnancy tests?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I drank like ten tons of Sunny
dialog: Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant.
dialog: And you're shockingly cavalier.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Is this for real? Like for real, for
dialog: real?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Unfortunately, yes.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: That's the kind of emotion I was
text: looking for in the first take.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Well, are you going to go to
dialog: Havenbrooke or Women Now for the
dialog: abortion? You need a note from your
dialog: parents for Havenbrooke.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I know. Women Now, I guess. The
dialog: commercial says they help women now.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Want me to call for you? I called
dialog: for Becky last year.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do
dialog: need your help with something very
dialog: urgent.
scene_heading: EXT. CENTENNIAL LANE - NIGHT
text: Leah and Juno struggle to drag a recliner across a well
text: manicured suburban lawn. They make a formidable team.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Heavy lifting can only help you at
dialog: this point.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: That is sick, man.
text: Leah busts a gut laughing. It's a stunningly accurate
text: portrayal of Bleeker's parents.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: So, you were bored? Is that how this
dialog: blessed miracle came to be?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Nah, it was a premeditated act. The
dialog: sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: When did you decide you were going
dialog: to do Bleeker?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.
scene_heading: INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - SPANISH CLASS - DAY - (FLASHBACK)
text: Bleeker and Juno are sitting at their desks, listening to a
text: teacher lecturing about spanish. Bleeker discreetly pushes a
text: POSTCARD to Juno with his foot. She picks it up off the floor,
text: reads it, then looks at Bleeker, who is watching the teacher
text: obediently.
scene_heading: EXT. CENTENNIAL LANE - NIGHT
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Aha! You love him.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: It's extremely complicated, and I'd
dialog: rather not talk about it in my fragile
dialog: state.
text: She hefts a coffee table with her bare hands. She's wearing
text: her father's LIFTING BELT.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: So, what was it like humping Bleeker's
dialog: bony bod?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: It was magnificent, man!
scene_heading: INT. BLEEKER'S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: CU of Bleeker putting on double socks in his Car-Bed.
text: CU of Bleeker putting on his sweat bands.
text: CU of Bleeker applying Runner's Glide.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - BLEEKER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
text: CU of a CROISSANT POCKET warming in the microwave.
scene_heading: EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - MORNING
text: PAUL BLEEKER steps onto the front porch of his house for
text: early morning track practice. He wears a cross country uniform
text: that reads "DANCING ELK CONDORS." He is eating some kind of
text: microwaved snack gimmick.
text: Bleeker is startled to discover that Juno is outside waiting
text: for him. She has somehow arranged the living room set on the
text: front lawn, and is seated in the armchair, chewing a pipe
text: officiously.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Hey Bleek.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Cool.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Your shorts are looking especially
dialog: gold today.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: My mom uses color-safe bleach.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Go Carole.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: So, guess what?
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I don't know...
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I'm pregnant.
text: Stunned silence. Juno pops up the footrest of the recliner
text: and leans back comfortably.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: I guess so.
dialog: (fidgeting)
dialog: What are you going to do?
text: The Dancing Elk Prep cross country team runs past Bleeker's
text: house in a thundering herd, wearing a motley assortment of
text: warm-ups. Their momentum stirs the crackling fall leaves.
text: They wave and holler at Bleeker and Juno.
speaker_heading: JUNO (V.O.)
dialog: When I see them all running like
dialog: that, with their things bouncing
dialog: around in their shorts, I always
dialog: picture them naked, even if I don't
dialog: want to. I have intrusive thoughts
dialog: all the time.
scene_heading: EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - CONTINUED
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: I'm supposed to be running.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I know.
text: There's an awkward silence.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: So, what do you think we should do?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I thought I might, you know, nip it
text: in the bud before it gets worse.
dialog: Because I heard in health class that
dialog: pregnancy often results in an infant.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Yeah, typically. That's what happens
dialog: when our moms and teachers get
dialog: pregnant.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: So that's cool with you, then?
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do
dialog: what you think is right.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I
dialog: know it wasn't your idea.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Whose idea was it?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I'll see you at school, O.K.?
text: She mounts her bicycle and waves before riding off.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: (to nobody in
dialog: particular)
dialog: Whose idea was it?
scene_heading: EXT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - DAY
text: Juno pushes her crappy bike into the bike rack and winds a
text: lock around it. In the background, a group of 3 NERDS play a
text: live-action RPG.
speaker_heading: NERD
dialog: You did not! You don't have the armor.
dialog: That Orc Armor you bought from the
dialog: wizard doesn't have the power level
dialog: to parry my hit!
scene_heading: INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Juno tries to push through the masses, but the throng of
text: students is thick and unwielding.
scene_heading: INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
text: Juno rummages through her locker, which is plastered with
text: photos of Leah and Bleeker, plus a giant poster of Iggy Pop
dialog: in his heyday.
text: She grabs a dilapidated physics textbook. A few pages slip
text: out. STEVE RENDAZO (the same asshole who harassed her as she
text: walked to the drugstore) passes by in the hallway.
speaker_heading: STEVE RENDAZO
dialog: Hey, your book fell apart!
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: STEVE RENDAZO
dialog: It must have looked at your face.
speaker_heading: PWAH!
text: He high-fives his klatch of buddies and moves along.
speaker_heading: JUNO (V.O.)
dialog: The funny thing is that Steve Rendazo
dialog: secretly wants me. Jocks like him
dialog: always want freaky girls. Girls with
text: horn-rimmed glasses and vegan footwear
dialog: and Goth makeup. Girls who play the
dialog: cello and wear Converse All-Stars
dialog: and want to be children's librarians
dialog: when they grow up. Oh yeah, jocks
dialog: eat that shit up.
text: We see Steve looking back at Juno for a brief second with
dialog: mixed feelings.
speaker_heading: JUNO (V.O.)
dialog: They just won't admit it, because
dialog: they're supposed to be into perfect
dialog: cheerleaders like Leah. Who,
dialog: incidentally, is into teachers.
text: We see Leah at the far end of the hallway, talking animatedly
text: with a paunchy middle-aged teacher, KEITH.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: (from a distance)
dialog: Me too! I love Woody Allen!
scene_heading: INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - SCIENCE LAB - DAY
text: STUDENTS bustle in, as the teacher, MR. TINKER tries to
text: maintain order. Juno heads toward her desk and sets down her
dialog: bag.
speaker_heading: MR. TINKER
dialog: People! We're doing our photomagnetism
dialog: lab today, so find your partner and
text: break out into fours.
text: Juno looks up and meets eyes with her longtime lab partner:
dialog: Bleeker. Sound the gong of awkwardness!
text: Juno and Bleeker head separately over to an available lab
text: station and unpack their bags in silence.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Well! Nothing like experimenting.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: I did the prep questions for this
dialog: lab last night. You can copy my
dialog: answers if you need to.
text: He slides a piece of graph paper in front of Juno without
text: looking at her.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: But you copy my work every week.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab
dialog: partner, huh?
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: I don't mind. You definitely bring
text: something to the table.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Charisma?
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Or something.
text: The other two LAB PARTNERS, a humorless couple, join them at
dialog: the station.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: So, who's ready for some
dialog: photomagnificence?
speaker_heading: GIRL LAB PARTNER
dialog: I have a menstrual migraine, and I
dialog: can't look at bright lights today.
speaker_heading: GUY LAB PARTNER
dialog: Amanda, I told you to go to the
dialog: infirmary and lie down. You never
dialog: listen.
speaker_heading: GIRL LAB PARTNER
dialog: No Josh, I don't take orders. Not
dialog: from you and not from any man.
speaker_heading: GUY LAB PARTNER
dialog: You know, you've been acting like
dialog: this ever since I went up to see my
dialog: brother at Mankato. I told you,
dialog: nothing happened!
speaker_heading: GIRL LAB PARTNER
dialog: Something happened. Because your
dialog: eyes? Are very cold? They're very
text: cold, Josh. They're cold, lying eyes.
speaker_heading: GUY LAB PARTNER
dialog: What? My eyes are not lying!
speaker_heading: GIRL LAB PARTNER
dialog: Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato,
text: they have been lying eyes.
text: Juno and Bleeker observe the argument like tennis spectators,
text: fascinated by the dynamics of a real couple.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Okay... I'm going to set up the
dialog: apparatus. Juno, want to get a C
dialog: clamp out of that drawer?
speaker_heading: GIRL LAB PARTNER
dialog: I'm going to the infirmary.
speaker_heading: GUY LAB PARTNER
dialog: Good. Call me when you're OFF the
dialog: rag.
speaker_heading: GIRL LAB PARTNER
dialog: Fine. Call me when you learn how to
dialog: love just one person and not cheat
dialog: at your brother's college just because
dialog: you had four Smirnoff Ices and a
dialog: bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored
dialog: Boone's!
speaker_heading: GUY LAB PARTNER
dialog: Good, I'll be sure to do that, Amanda.
dialog: I'll make a note of it.
text: He furiously scrawls a fake memo in his notebook.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Snow Peak Peach is the best flavor
dialog: of Boone's. Right, Bleek?
text: Bleeker reddens and continues constructing the apparatus.
text: GIRL LAB PARTNER stalks off dramatically.
text: Bleeker shakes his head and rifles through his textbook.
scene_heading: INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - JUNO'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
text: Juno examines a large ad in the newspaper that depicts a
text: distraught TEEN GIRL clutching her head in a moment of staged
text: conflict. The ad reads: "Pregnant? Find the clinic that gives
dialog: women choice. Women's Choice Health Center."
text: Juno picks up her hamburger phone and dials. For a moment,
text: she attempts to copy the melodramatic pose from the ad,
text: checking herself out in the mirror.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (talking along with
dialog: voice prompt)
dialog: "Para instruciones en Espanol, oprima
dialog: numero dos."
text: She presses a few buttons in succession.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Yes, hello, I need to procure a hasty
dialog: abortion?... What was that? I'm sorry,
text: I'm on my hamburger phone and it's
dialog: kind of awkward to talk on. It's
dialog: really more of a novelty than a
dialog: functional appliance.
text: She SMACKS the phone a couple of times.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Better? Okay, good. Yeah, as I said,
dialog: I need an abortion, two... sixteen...
dialog: Um, it was approximately two months
dialog: and four days ago that I had the
dialog: sex. That's a guestimate. Okay, next
dialog: Saturday? Great.
text: She hangs up the phone.
speaker_heading: JUNO (V.O.)
dialog: I hate it when adults use the term
dialog: "sexually active."
scene_heading: INT. HEALTH CLASS - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: A HEALTH TEACHER in slo-mo puts a condom on a banana.
speaker_heading: JUNO (V.O.)
dialog: What does that even mean? Can I
dialog: deactivate someday, or is this a
dialog: permanent state of being? I guess
dialog: Bleeker went live that night we did
dialog: it. I guess he hadn't done it before,
dialog: and that's why he got that look on
text: his face.
scene_heading: INT. BLEEKER'S HOUSE - MOLD-O'-RIFIC BASEMENT - NIGHT
speaker_heading: (FLASHBACK)
text: We see Paulie's face at the moment of his deflowering: he's

scene_heading: INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Juno, her father MAC, her stepmother BREN, and LIBERTY BELL
text: sit at a very typical kitchen table, eating dinner. MAC

speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: You should have seen this octopus
dialog: furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat
dialog: suit just to get up in there...
speaker_heading: JUNO (V.O.)
dialog: My dad used to be in the Army, but
dialog: now he's just your average HVAC
dialog: specialist. He and my mom got divorced
dialog: when I was five. She lives on a Havasu
dialog: reservation in Arizona...
scene_heading: PHOTO: ARIZONA TRAILER PARK
speaker_heading: JUNO (V.O.)

scene_heading: INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - JUNO'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: PILE OF NEGLECTED CACTI festering in a corner of Juno's room.
speaker_heading: JUNO (V.O.)

speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: So Juno, how did your maneuver go
dialog: last night?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Which maneuver, sir? The one in which
dialog: I moved an entire living room set
dialog: from one lawn to another, or the one
dialog: in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce
dialog: blue slushie in ten minutes?
text: Bren speaks in her strong city accent.
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: Juno? Did you happen to barf in my
dialog: urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by
dialog: the front door, the one I got up in
dialog: Stillwater? I found some weird blue
dialog: shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there
dialog: this morning.
speaker_heading: JUNO

speaker_heading: LONE PROTESTER

speaker_heading: SU-CHIN

speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Good. I'm good.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Did you finish that paper for Worth's

speaker_heading: SU-CHIN
dialog: No, not yet. I tried to work on it a

dialog: trouble concentrating.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: You should try Adderall.
speaker_heading: SU-CHIN
dialog: No thanks. I'm off pills.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Wise move. I know this girl who had
dialog: a huge crazy freakout because she
dialog: took too many behavioral meds at
text: once. She took off her clothes and
text: jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale
dialog: Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah!
dialog: I'm a kraken from the sea!"
speaker_heading: SU-CHIN
dialog: I heard that was you.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Well, it was nice seeing you.
text: She continues on toward the clinic entrance.
speaker_heading: SU-CHIN

text: The receptionist hands Juno the clipboard and a pen.
scene_heading: PUNK RECEPTIONIST

speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Congrats.
text: She takes a seat in the WAITING ROOM and rifles through a
text: pile of old magazines. The magazine selection is lots of
text: "mommy mags" and health related periodicals. She selects an
text: issue of Family Digest and gingerly flips through for a few
dialog: moments.
text: Then she looks over and notices the FINGERNAILS of a nearby
text: teen, who looks as nervous as she does. The girl bites her
text: thumbnail and spits it onto the floor.
text: Juno looks away, but immediately notices another waiting
text: woman, who absently scratches her arm with long fake nails.
text: Suddenly, she sees fingernails EVERYWHERE. The receptionist
text: clicks her nails on the front desk. Another woman blows on
text: her fresh manicure. Everyone seems to be fidgeting with their
text: fingers somehow. Juno suddenly looks terror-stricken...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: PUNK RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Excuse me, Miss MacGoof?
text: There's no answer. We see that Juno's chair is EMPTY.
text: The receptionist cranes her neck and sees the front door
text: drift shut. Juno's figure recedes into the distance as she
text: tears off down the street, running as fast as she can.
scene_heading: EXT. LEAH'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Leah's front door swings open to reveal a breathless Juno
text: standing sheepishly on the porch. Leah sighs.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: What are you doing here, dumbass? I
dialog: thought I was supposed to pick you
text: up at four.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled
text: like a dentist in there. They had
dialog: these really horrible magazines,
dialog: with, like, spritz cookie recipes
dialog: and bad fiction and water stains,
text: like someone read them in the tub.
dialog: And the receptionist tried to give
dialog: me these weird condoms that looked
dialog: like grape suckers, and she told me
dialog: about her boyfriend's pie balls, and
dialog: Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told
dialog: me the baby had fingernails.
dialog: Fingernails!
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's
dialog: claws could scratch your vag on the
dialog: way out?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I'm staying pregnant, Le.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Keep your voice down dude, my mom's
dialog: around here somewhere. She doesn't
dialog: know we're sexually active.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: What does that even mean? Anyway, I
dialog: got to thinking on the way over. I
dialog: was thinking maybe I could give the
dialog: baby to somebody who actually likes
dialog: that kind of thing. You know, like a
text: woman with a bum ovary or something.
dialog: Or some nice lesbos.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: But then you'll get huge. Your chest
dialog: is going to milktate. And you have
dialog: to tell everyone you're pregnant.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I know. Maybe they'll canonize me
dialog: for being so selfless.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Maybe they'll totally shit and be
dialog: super mad at you and not let you
dialog: graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for
dialog: spring break.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Bleeker and I were going to go to
dialog: Gettysburg for spring break.
text: Leah sighs, as if there's no helping her nerdy friend.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Well, maybe you could look at one of
dialog: those adoption ads. I see them all
text: the time in the Penny Saver.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: There are ads? For parents?
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn."
dialog: They're right by the ads for like,
dialog: iguanas and terriers and used fitness
dialog: equipment. It's totally legit.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Come on, Leah. I can't scope out
dialog: wannabe parents in the Penny Saver!
dialog: That's tacky. That's like buying
text: clothes at the Pump n' Munch.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK BENCH - DAY
text: Juno and Leah are sitting at a bench in a park. They slurp
text: giant blue slushies and sift through a pile of Penny Savers.
text: Juno has her pipe with her.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: The Penny Saver sucks.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Yeah, but it sucks for free.
text: They turn the pages in silence for a moment. Their lips and
dialog: teeth are Windex-blue.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Look at this one "Wholesome,
dialog: spiritually wealthy couple have found
dialog: true love with each other."
dialog: (checks to see that
dialog: Juno is paying
dialog: attention)
dialog: "All that's missing is your bastard."
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (reading a different
dialog: page)
dialog: There's a guy in here who's giving
dialog: away a piano. Free for the hauling!
dialog: We should put it in Bleeker's yard.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: You're not listening to me.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: No, I heard you. I just can't give
dialog: the baby to people who describe
dialog: themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking
dialog: for something a little edgier.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: What did you have in mind, a family
dialog: of disturbed loners who are into
dialog: gunplay and incest?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I was thinking a graphic designer,
dialog: mid-thirties, and his cool Asian
dialog: wife who dresses awesome and plays
dialog: bass. But I'm trying to not be too
dialog: particular.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: All right, how about this one?
dialog: "Healthy, educated couple seeking
dialog: infant to join our family of five.
dialog: You will be compensated. Help us
dialog: complete the circle of love."
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Yeesh, they sound like a cult.
dialog: Besides, they're greedy bitches.
dialog: They already have three kids!
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Hey, Juno. Juno! Look at this one.
text: She points to the paper and motions for Juno to look. Juno
text: scans the ad silently.
text: We see the ad. It contains a photo of an attractive couple
text: with ambiguous Mona Lisa smiles. It reads "Educated,
dialog: successful couple wishes to..."
speaker_heading: JUNO (V.O.)
dialog: They were Mark and Vanessa Loring,
dialog: and they were beautiful even in black
dialog: and white.
scene_heading: EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - PAULIE'S WINDOW - NIGHT
text: We see Paulie's bedroom window -- festooned with childish
text: curtains -- and the light on inside.
scene_heading: INT. BLEEKER'S HOUSE - PAULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Bleeker lies on his Car-bed in his track uniform, listening
dialog: to the same LP from when he and Juno went all the way.
text: He stares between the pages of his embossed Dancing Elk Prep
dialog: yearbook.
text: We see the object of his gaze is Juno's black and white
text: YEARBOOK PHOTO. Next to it, we see a sloppy, handwritten
text: message from Juno. We hear Juno's voice reading the message:
speaker_heading: JUNO (V.O.)
dialog: Hey Bleeker! Spank off to this with
dialog: motion lotion. Just kidding (kind
dialog: of.) Your best friend, Juno.
text: Bleeker picks up the phone. It's the same HAMBURGER PHONE
text: Juno has. He reconsiders and puts it down.
text: There's a knock on the bedroom door.
text: BLEEKER'S MOM pokes her dowdy head inside.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER'S MOM
dialog: Paul? Are you coming downstairs to
dialog: eat?
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER'S MOM
dialog: You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: I'm not hungry, oddly.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER'S MOM
dialog: But it's breakfast for supper. Your
dialog: favorite, Paulie. I made French toast
dialog: and sausage. Patties, not linkies,
dialog: just like you like it.
text: Bleeker places his hand silently on his stomach.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER'S MOM
dialog: Juno MacGuff called while you were
text: out running. She wants to know if
dialog: you're coming to her little
text: coffeehouse performance on Saturday.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Thanks for the message.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER'S MOM
dialog: You know how I feel about her.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: You've mentioned it about fifty times.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER'S MOM
dialog: I just hope you don't consider her a
dialog: close friend.
text: Bleeker's mom gives up and closes the door.
text: We see that Bleeker is clutching a pair of PANTIES in one
text: hand, which he slowly releases as the 45 ends.
scene_heading: INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
text: Bren and MAC are seated on the couch. Leah is standing nearby
text: for reinforcements. Juno paces nervously, trying to suss out
dialog: how to break the massive news.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I have no idea how to spit this out.
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: Hon, did you get expelled?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: No. The school would probably contact
dialog: you in the event of my expulsion.
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: Well, I was just asking. It seemed
dialog: plausible.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Do you need a large sum of money?
dialog: Legal counsel?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: No, no, I'm definitely not asking
dialog: for anything. Except maybe mercy.
dialog: Like, it would be really great if
dialog: nobody hit me.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: What have you done, Junebug? Did you
dialog: hit someone with the Previa?
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Best to just tell them, man. Rip off
text: the Band-Aid and let it bleed.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I'm pregnant.
text: Bren and Mac are predictably speechless.
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: Oh, God...
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: But I'm going to give it up for
dialog: adoption. I already found the perfect
dialog: people.
text: Leah presents the Penny Saver photos of the Lornings.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: They say they're going to pay my
dialog: medical expenses and everything. I
dialog: promise this will all be resolved in
dialog: thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend
dialog: it never happened.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: You're pregnant?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I'm so sorry, you guys. If it's any
dialog: consolation, I have heartburn that's
text: like, radiating down to my kneecaps
dialog: and I haven't gone number two since
dialog: Wednesday. Morning!
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: I didn't even know you were sexually
dialog: active!
text: Juno cringes upon hearing her most-hated term.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Who is the kid?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: The baby? I don't know anything about
dialog: it yet. I only know it's got
dialog: fingernails, allegedly.
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: Nails? Really?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: No, I mean the father! Who's the
dialog: father, Juno?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Oh. It's, well, it's Paulie Bleeker.
text: Bren and Mac burst into shocked laughter.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had
dialog: it in him!
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: (giggling)
text: He just doesn't look, well, virile.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: I know, right?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Okay, this is no laughing matter.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (indignant)
dialog: No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by
dialog: the way. He was very good in... chair.
text: Leah fires a be quiet glance at Juno.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Did you say you were thinking about
dialog: adoption?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Yeah, well, there's this couple who've
dialog: been trying to have a baby for five
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: We found them in the Penny Saver by
dialog: the exotic birds section.
text: Bren looks understandably alarmed. Juno hastily attempts to
dialog: make the situation sound more legitimate.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: But they have a real lawyer and
dialog: everything. I'm going to meet with
dialog: them next weekend.
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing
dialog: to do. Probably tougher than you can
dialog: understand right now.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Well, I'm not ready to be a mom.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Damn skippy, you're not! You don't
dialog: even remember to give Liberty Bell
text: her breathing meds.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Once! And she didn't die, if you
dialog: recall!
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: Honey, had you considered, you know,
dialog: the alternative?
text: Leah and Juno exchange glances.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: Well, you're a brave young lady.
dialog: You're made of stronger stuff than I
dialog: thought. You're a little Viking!
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Cool it.
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: First things first, we have to get
dialog: you healthy. You need prenatal
dialog: vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do
dialog: incredible things for your nails, so
dialog: that's a plus. Oh, and we need to
dialog: schedule a doctor's appointment.
dialog: Find out where you're going to
dialog: deliver.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: The term "deliver" is so weird. Can
dialog: we not say "deliver"?
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: How does "crap it out" sound?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Juno, I want to come with you to
dialog: meet these adoption people. You're
dialog: just a kid. I don't want you to get
text: ripped off by a couple of babystarved
text: wingnuts.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Sure, Dad.
text: Mac nods, satisfied, then contemplates the situation dismally.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: I thought you were the kind of girl
dialog: who knew when to say when.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I have no idea what kind of girl I
dialog: am.
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: (sensing tension)
dialog: Why don't you girls go upstairs for
dialog: a while? I think Mac's gonna blow.
text: Juno and Leah hightail it upstairs.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Just tell it to me straight, Bren.
dialog: Do you think this is my fault? Her
dialog: mother's fault?
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: I think kids get bored and have
dialog: intercourse. And I think Junebug was
dialog: a dummy about it. But we have to
dialog: move on from here and help her figure
dialog: it out.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: You're not going to be a Pop-Pop.
dialog: And Juno's not going to be a ma.
dialog: Somebody else is going to find a
dialog: precious blessing from Jesus in this
dialog: garbage dump of a situation. I
dialog: friggin' hope.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: (conspiratorially)
dialog: Did you see it coming when she sat
dialog: us down here?
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she
dialog: was expelled or into hard drugs.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: That was my first instinct too. Or
dialog: D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm
dialog: going to punch that Bleeker kid in
dialog: the weiner the next time I see him.
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: Oh Mac, no! He's a sweet kid. You
dialog: know it wasn't his idea.
text: Mac shrugs in agreement.
scene_heading: INT. LORING HOUSE - DAY
text: Music plays as we see SPARSE IMAGES OF VANESSA LORING'S HANDS
dialog: preparing the house for Juno's arrival --
text: Sprucing a vase of FLOWERS.
text: Straightening a FRAMED PHOTO of the Lorings.
text: Dusting off a table with one of those WETNAPS for furniture.
text: Lining up a shelf of BOOKS.
scene_heading: EXT. LORING NEIGHBORHOOD - PREVIA - DAY
text: The Previa cruises slowly into the Loring's fancy gated
text: community. Mac pulls over and parks on the curb.
scene_heading: EXT. LORING HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - DAY
text: Mark and Vanessa Loring have an impressive, though generic
text: McMansion. The entire yard is unlandscaped soil. Mac presses
text: the doorbell while Juno chews her nails uncomfortably. Both
text: look mortified as they wait for someone to greet them.
text: VANESSA opens the door. She's a pretty, meticulous woman in
dialog: her early thirties. Very Banana Republic.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno
dialog: and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Vanessa, right?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Hello. Thank you for having me and
dialog: my irresponsible child over to your
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
scene_heading: INT. LORING HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY
text: Vanessa awkwardly leads them into her home.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Can I take your coats?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Sure.
text: She takes off her hooded sweatshirt and thrusts it into
text: Vanessa's arms who sets it on a bench.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by
dialog: the way. Super classy. Not like those
text: other people with the fake woods in
dialog: the background. Like I'm really going
dialog: to fall for that, you know?
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: You found us in the Penny Saver?
text: MARK LORING appears next to Vanessa. He's a boyishly
text: attractive guy in his mid-thirties.
text: He glances sheepishly at Vanessa upon hearing the Penny Saver
text: mention, then extends his hand to Mac and Juno.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Hi. I'm Mark Loring. I'm the husband.
scene_heading: INT. LORING HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Mark and Vanessa usher Juno and Mac into the austere, spacious
text: living room. A woman in a business suit sits on the couch
text: with a briefcase in her lap.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (in exaggerated,
dialog: growling German accent)
dialog: Geeeerta Rauuuss!
speaker_heading: GERTA
dialog: (straight)
dialog: Nice to meet you.
text: Mac seizes Mark's hand and pumps it heartily.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: I'm Mac MacGuff, and this, of course,
dialog: is my daughter Juno.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Like the city in Alaska?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Cool. Well, let's sit down and get
dialog: to know each other a bit.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: I'll get drinks. What would everyone
dialog: like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin
dialog: Water...
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: A Maker's Mark, please. Up.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful
dialog: sense of humor, which is just one of
dialog: her many genetic gifts.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I also have good teeth. No cavities.
dialog: We finally got fluoridated water in
dialog: Dancing Elk.
text: She bares them frighteningly to demonstrate.
text: Vanessa stares, unflappable.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: We're fine, thank you.
text: Mac and Juno join Mark and Gerta Rauss on the couch.
speaker_heading: GERTA
dialog: So, Juno. First off, how far along
dialog: are you?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I'm a junior.
speaker_heading: GERTA
dialog: No, I mean in your pregnancy.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the
dialog: doctor yesterday and they said I was
dialog: twelve weeks.
text: Vanessa enters with the refreshments on a tray.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost
dialog: into your second trimester, then?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on
dialog: May 4.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: The tough part's almost over for
dialog: you. I mean, my girlfriends always
dialog: tell me the first couple months are
dialog: the hardest.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm
dialog: more worried about the part where I
dialog: have to start wearing jeans with an
text: elastic panel in the front.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: I think pregnancy is beautiful.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Well, you're lucky it's not you.
text: Vanessa's looks to the ceiling.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: (clearing throat)
dialog: So, let's discuss how we're gonna do
dialog: this... thing.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Well, I just have the baby and give
dialog: it to you, right?
speaker_heading: GERTA
dialog: Mark and Vanessa are willing to
dialog: negotiate an open adoption.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: (protective)
dialog: Wait. What does that mean?
speaker_heading: GERTA
dialog: It means they'd send annual updates,
dialog: photos, let Juno know how the baby
text: is doing as he or she grows up. Of
dialog: course, Juno's legal rights would be
dialog: terminated...
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Whoah. I don't want to see pictures.
dialog: I don't need to be notified of
dialog: anything. Can't we just kick it old
dialog: school? I could just put the baby in
dialog: a basket and send it your way. You
dialog: know, like Moses in the reeds.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Technically, that would be kickin'
dialog: it Old Testament.
text: Mark and Juno lock eyes.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to
dialog: do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping
text: off a Band-Aid.
speaker_heading: GERTA
dialog: Well, then we agree a traditional
dialog: closed adoption would be best for
dialog: all involved, then?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Shit, yeah. Close it up.
text: Vanessa is clearly ecstatic.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Obviously, we'll compensate you for
dialog: your medical expenses.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Are you looking for any other
dialog: compensation?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Well, no... I'm not going to sell
dialog: the baby. I just want it to grow up
dialog: with people who are ready to love it
dialog: and be parents. I'm in high school,
dialog: dude. I'm ill-equipped.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: You're doing an amazing and selfless
dialog: thing for us.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Vanessa has wanted a baby since we
dialog: got married.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: I want to be a mommy so badly!
text: Juno and Mac stare at her.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: You don't say.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Well, haven't you ever felt like you
dialog: were born to do something?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Well, I was born to be a mother.
dialog: Some of us are.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Mark, are you looking forward to
dialog: being a dad?
text: Mark is caught off guard.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Sure, why not? I mean, every guy
dialog: wants to be a father. Coach soccer,
dialog: help with science projects and... I
dialog: don't know. Fatherly stuff.
text: Mac casts a subtle, dubious glance at Mark.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Well, shall we start looking over
dialog: the paperwork? Gerta has already
dialog: drafted some preliminary documents.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Can I use the facilities first? Being
dialog: pregnant makes you pee like
dialog: Seabiscuit.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Sure. The powder room down here is
dialog: being re-tiled, but you can use the
dialog: master bath upstairs. Go up, then
dialog: turn left and on your right...
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Room with a toilet, got it.
scene_heading: INT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY/STAIRS - DAY
text: Juno heads into the foyer and up the stairs. We see a posed
text: photo of Mark and Vanessa in the stairwell. Their house is
text: beautiful, but frigid. Juno rubs her arms, shivering.
scene_heading: INT. LORING HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY
text: The Loring's bathroom is huge. Juno flushes and goes to the
text: double sink to wash her hands. She opens the overhead cabinet
text: and sees Vanessa's toiletries. She spritzes on some perfume
text: and examines the more expensive grooming items. There's a
text: crinkled tube of LUBE in the cabinet. Juno picks it up,
text: fascinated. She rubs a drop of it between her hands and runs
text: it through her hair like pomade.
scene_heading: INT. LORING HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY
text: Juno opens the bathroom door and instantly BUMPS into Mark.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to
dialog: see you up here.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Sorry. I was just getting something.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Did your wife send you up here to
dialog: spy on me?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What? No! Do we come off like paranoid
dialog: yuppies or something?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Well, you don't just invite a random
dialog: pregnant teenager into your house
dialog: and leave her unsupervised. I could
dialog: be a total klepto, for all you know.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I don't get a klepto vibe from you.
dialog: Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't
dialog: rule it out.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I did steal a squirt of perfume.
dialog: What do you think? It's Clinique
dialog: Happy.
text: She holds her WRIST up to Mark's twitching nostrils.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Smell those sparkling topnotes!
text: Mark inhales.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Am I supposed to feel happy now?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: You should be happy, Holmes. I'm
dialog: giving you and Vanessa the gift of
dialog: life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life!
dialog: And you don't even have to be there
dialog: when the baby comes out of me all
dialog: covered in...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Viscera?
speaker_heading: JUNO
text: Blood and guts.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: We'd better get back downstairs ASAP.
text: Juno mocks his use of "ASAP" silently.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (halting)
dialog: Wait a minute. Is that a Les Paul?
text: Juno is staring into a room with the door slightly ajar. We
text: see GUITARS mounted on the wall, and the edges of posters.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa
dialog: lets me have a room for all my old
dialog: stuff.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Wow, you get a whole room in your
dialog: own house? She's got you on a long
dialog: leash there, Mark.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Shut up.
scene_heading: INT. LORING HOUSE - MARK'S "SPECIAL" ROOM - DAY
text: The walls are plastered with FRAMED POSTERS of early-90s alt
dialog: rock bands. (Mudhoney, Jane's Addiction etc.) Mark removes
text: his LES PAUL from its moorings and hands it to Juno.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: It's beautiful. I've always liked
dialog: Gibson better than Fender.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What do you play?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I rock a Harmony.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: (holding back a chuckle)
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.
text: Juno turns the guitar over, examining it closely.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: What is that, Mahogany? What happens
dialog: if you crack the neck?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Tell me about it. I used to play in
dialog: a really tight band back when I lived
dialog: in Chicago, and one night we opened
dialog: for the Melvins... do you know who
dialog: the Melvins are?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (lying)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Well, we were playing with them and
dialog: I busted this guitar onstage. It
dialog: cost me $800 and a dime bag just to
dialog: have it fixed.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: When was this, like '96?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: '93. I'm telling you that was the
dialog: best time for rock and roll.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You
dialog: weren't there, so you can't understand
dialog: the magic.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You weren't even alive!
scene_heading: INT. LORING HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Vanessa, Mac and Gerta Rauss are waiting in awkward silence
text: for Juno and Mark to return. Mac notices a brand new PILATES
text: MACHINE sitting in its packaging in a corner of the room.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: So. What's that thing?
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: A Pilates machine?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: What do you make with that?
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: You don't make anything. It's for
text: exercising.
scene_heading: INT. LORING HOUSE - MARK'S SPECIAL ROOM - SAME
text: Mark and Juno tool around on the guitars unplugged. They
text: play little riffs. He teaches her a couple chords.
scene_heading: INT. LORING HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: My wife just ordered one of those
dialog: Tony Little Gazelles off the TV, you
dialog: know, from the guy with the ponytail?
text: Vanessa and Gerta have no response.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: That guy just doesn't look right to
dialog: me.
text: Suddenly, a shriek of AMP FEEDBACK, followed by loud,
text: discordant GUITAR STRUMMING can be heard drifting down from
text: upstairs. Vanessa's looks to the ceiling.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: (to her guests)
dialog: Will you excuse me?
scene_heading: INT. LORING HOUSE - MARK'S SPECIAL ROOM - DAY
text: Mark has strapped on the Les Paul and is playing and singing.
dialog: "Doll Parts" by Hole.
speaker_heading: JUNO AND MARK
dialog: (quietly singing
dialog: together)
dialog: "Yeah, they really want you... they
dialog: really want you... they really do."
dialog: Building together.
speaker_heading: JUNO AND MARK
dialog: (singing together and
dialog: connecting)
dialog: Yeah, they really want you... they
dialog: really want you... and I do to.
dialog: (both blush)
text: VANESSA appears in the doorway. Juno immediately puts down
text: the guitar. Mark doesn't notice her immediately.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: (passionate singing)
dialog: I WANT TO BE THE...
dialog: (notices Vanessa)
dialog: Oh, sorry honey...
text: Mark clumsily puts down the guitar and stands up.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: You guys are playing music?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Juno just wanted a closer look at
dialog: Kimber here.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Your guitar is named Kimber?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: That's all right. My axe is named
dialog: Roosevelt. After Franklin, not Ted.
dialog: Franklin was the hot one with the
dialog: polio.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: I think Gerta is waiting for us
dialog: downstairs with some important stuff
dialog: for us to go over.
text: Mark hangs the guitars back on the wall. He and Juno exit
text: the room, chastised. Vanessa looks to Mark in question.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Didn't mean to interrupt the jam
dialog: sessions.
scene_heading: INT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - DAY
text: Juno and Mac have put their coats on and are in the process
text: of leaving. Gerta hands Juno the DOCUMENTS. Vanessa and Mark
text: trail behind.
speaker_heading: GERTA
dialog: So, look those over and give me a
dialog: call at my office if you have any
dialog: questions.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Juno, we'd really appreciate it if
dialog: you could keep us updated on any
dialog: doctor's appointments, ultrasounds,
dialog: other things of that nature.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to
dialog: know how your kid is cooking.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: So, then, you really think you're
dialog: going to go ahead with this?
text: Mac STARES at Juno gravely.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Yeah. For sure. I like you guys.
text: Juno looks at Mark.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: How sure? Percentage-wise, would you
dialog: say you're 80% sure, 90% sure?
text: Mark seems visibly embarrassed by Vanessa's manic demeanor.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Oh really?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Look, if I could give it to you now,
dialog: I would. But it probably looks like
dialog: a Sea Monkey at this point, so I
dialog: think we should leave it in there
dialog: for a while until it gets cuter, you
dialog: know?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: I think that's a great idea.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: That's great, right? Stellar news.
dialog: Well, you guys drive safe, and we'll
dialog: hear from you soon, all right?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: All right, take care of yourselves.
text: Juno and Mac exit. Mark shuts the door. All is silent in the
text: foyer. Mark, Vanessa and Gerta stand motionless. Gerta pumps
text: her fist triumphantly, trying to create a mood of celebration.
speaker_heading: GERTA
dialog: (overly aggressive)
dialog: All RIGHT!
text: Vanessa buries her head in her hands and weeps hoarsely.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - MORNING
text: It is now WINTER. The TRACK TEAM jogs in formation, leaving
text: tracks in the snow. Those bastards never stop running.
scene_heading: EXT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - TRACK - DAY
text: Bleeker is running alone on the track. His exhalations are
text: icy puffs in the air. Bleeker's friend VIJAY jogs up alongside
text: him. Vijay is a solemn, skinny boy, much like Bleeker.
speaker_heading: VIJAY
dialog: Hey man.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Oh, hey Vijay.
speaker_heading: VIJAY
dialog: Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: VIJAY
dialog: Just like our moms and teachers!
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: VIJAY
dialog: Did you hear it's yours?
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: VIJAY
dialog: What a trip, man.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: I don't really know anything about
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: VIJAY
dialog: You should grow a moustache. You're
text: a real man now.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: I can't grow a moustache. It never
text: comes in evenly.
speaker_heading: VIJAY
dialog: Me neither. But I'm going to stop
dialog: wearing underpants in order to raise
dialog: my sperm count. See you.
text: VIJAY jogs off. Bleeker STOPS and wipes away his sweat.
scene_heading: INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - HEAD OFFICE - DAY
text: We're looking over Juno's now FIVE MONTH PREGNANT BELLY to a
text: school administrator filling out a slip.
text: Juno takes the slip, turns around and smiles all the way
dialog: out.
scene_heading: INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Juno exits the head office and bumps into Bleeker.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Hey Juno... A couple of us are going
dialog: to the cineplex after school to donut
dialog: that movie with the guy with eighteen
dialog: kids.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Sorry, Bleek... Going for my
dialog: ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Okay, cool.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I'll try to drop by later.
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON
text: SPLOOGE! We see ultrasound goo being squirted onto Juno's
text: exposed pregnant belly. An ULTRASOUND TECHNICIAN is using a
text: Doppler device to view the contents of her burgeoning bump.
text: Bren and Leah ooh and ahh at the resulting image.
text: The tech takes measurements and types them into her database.
speaker_heading: ULTRASOUND TECH
dialog: That's the feet...
speaker_heading: ALL THREE
dialog: Oooh...
speaker_heading: ULTRASOUND TECH
dialog: And there's a hand...
text: The monitor reveals the baby's head.
speaker_heading: ALL THREE
dialog: (various)
dialog: Check that out... No way...
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: (dreamily)
dialog: Would you look at that?
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Check out Baby Big-Head. That kid is
dialog: scary!
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've
dialog: got in your belly is Taco Bell!
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Touche.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (gazing at the monitor)
dialog: It is really weird looking. It's
dialog: like it's not even real. I can't
dialog: believe there are saps who actually
dialog: cry at these things.
text: Juno and Leah look at BREN, who is dabbing her eyes
text: discreetly.
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: What? I'm not made of stone.
speaker_heading: ULTRASOUND TECH
dialog: Well, there we have it. Would you
dialog: like to know the sex?
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Aw, please Junebug?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: No way. No, I definitely don't want
dialog: to know.
speaker_heading: ULTRASOUND TECH
dialog: Planning to be surprised when you
dialog: deliver?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I want Mark and Vanessa to be
dialog: surprised, and if I know, I won't be
dialog: able to keep myself from telling
dialog: them and ruining the whole thing.
speaker_heading: ULTRASOUND TECH
dialog: (condescending)
dialog: Are Mark and Vanessa your friends at
dialog: school?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: No, they're the people who are
text: adopting the baby.
speaker_heading: ULTRASOUND TECH
dialog: Oh. Well, thank goodness for that.
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: ULTRASOUND TECH
dialog: I just see a lot of teenage mothers
dialog: come through here. It's obviously a
dialog: poisonous environment for a baby to
dialog: be raised in.
text: Juno, Leah and Bren become immediately defensive.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: How do you know I'm so poisonous?
dialog: Like, what if the adoptive parents
dialog: turn out to be evil molesters?
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Or stage parents!
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: They could be utterly negligent.
dialog: Maybe they'll do a far shittier job
dialog: of raising a kid than my dumbass
dialog: stepdaughter ever would. Have you
dialog: considered that?
speaker_heading: ULTRASOUND TECH
dialog: No... I guess not.
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: What is your job title, exactly?
speaker_heading: ULTRASOUND TECH
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
speaker_heading: ULTRASOUND TECH
dialog: I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: Well I'm a nail technician, and I
dialog: think we both ought to stick to what
dialog: we know.
speaker_heading: ULTRASOUND TECH
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: You think you're special because you
dialog: get to play Picture Pages up there?
text: Bren gestures to the ULTRASOUND MONITOR.
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: My five year-old daughter could do
dialog: that, and let me tell you, she is
dialog: not the brightest bulb in the tanning
dialog: bed. So why don't you go back to
dialog: night school in Manteno and learn a
dialog: real trade!
text: The ULTRASOUND TECH exits in a huff.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Bren, you're a dick! I love it.
scene_heading: INT. JUNO'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: Juno lays in bed checking out the ULTRASOUND PRINT OUT.
scene_heading: EXT. LORING NEIGHBORHOOD - PREVIA - AFTERNOON
text: The Previa drives into the front gate of Mark and Vanessa's
text: exclusive community. A sign on the gate reads "Glacial
dialog: Valley."
scene_heading: EXT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - AFTERNOON
text: Juno rings the doorbell, shifting her weight in the cold.
text: MARK answers the door, dressed in a t-shirt and jeans.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see
dialog: you here.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I've got something really cool to
dialog: show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No, she's working late tonight. She's
dialog: trying to accrue some extra time off
dialog: for when, you know...
text: He gestures awkwardly to Juno's belly.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Right. I hear they can be kind of a
dialog: time-suck.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Sure. What is it with you rich people
dialog: and your herb-infused juices?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I don't know. Something to do with
dialog: the four-packs...
dialog: (adding)
dialog: ...They're not bad.
scene_heading: INT. LORING HOUSE - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON
text: Mark leads Juno into the kitchen, where he pours two drinks.
text: The STEREO blares in the background.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Why aren't you at work?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I mostly work from home. I'm a
dialog: composer.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No, more commercial stuff.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Commercials.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Have you seen those ads for Titanium
dialog: Power men's deodorant?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Titanium Power! Get more snatch by
dialog: the batch!
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I wrote that.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: You're kind of a sellout, aren't
dialog: you? What would the Melvins say?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: They'd say you came a long way out
dialog: here not knowing if anyone would be
dialog: home.
text: She holds up a manila envelope.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Come on, you're going to want to sit
dialog: down for this.
scene_heading: INT. LORING HOUSE - DEN - AFTERNOON
text: As they move into the living room, Juno sits down and motions
text: for Mark to join her on the couch.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Park it, dude.
text: Mark sits down. With great fanfare, Juno retrieves a dark,
text: glossy sheet from the envelope. It's her ULTRASOUND.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Behold, good sir! The very first
dialog: photo of your future child.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You're kidding!
text: Mark EXAMINES the ultrasound, baffled.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I think it kind of looks like my
dialog: friend, Paulie.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: (joking)
dialog: Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: No, he's the dad.
text: Mark looks jolted, as if it's the first time he considered
text: that her baby might have a father. He stands up and holds
text: the photo up to the light critically.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: The doctor can tell, but I decided
dialog: not to know. I want it to be a big
dialog: surprise.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Well, it can really only go two ways.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: That's what you think. I drink tons
dialog: of booze so you might get one of
dialog: those scary neuter-babies that's
dialog: born without junk.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Junk?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: You know... it's parts...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I know what junk is.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (teasing)
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: We definitely want it to have junk.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Well don't worry about it. My stepmom
dialog: is forcing me to eat really healthy.
dialog: She won't even let me stand in front
dialog: of the microwave or eat red M&amp;Ms.
dialog: Hope you're ready.
text: Mark chuckles.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Wait...do you hear that?
text: A new SONG has begun. Mark closes his eyes in ecstasy and
text: walks toward the stereo. Juno follows him toward the source
text: of the music, looking perplexed by how happy he is.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: It's only my favorite song. It's
dialog: Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the
dialog: Carpenters.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (excited)
dialog: I've heard the Carpenters before.
dialog: Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not
dialog: unlike the White Stripes.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You haven't heard the Carpenters
dialog: like this. Listen.
text: Mark grabs the STEREO REMOTE off the kitchen counter and
text: turns up the volume to a roar. Mark and Juno stand in silence
text: in the kitchen. Mark mouths along with the lyrics.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: (lipsynching)
dialog: Don't you remember you told me you
dialog: loved me, baby...
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Hey, I like this.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: This album is all Carpenters covers
dialog: by alt-rock bands. It's called If I
dialog: Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll
dialog: rip a copy for you before you leave.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: You don't have to do that.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: It's the least I can do. What did
dialog: you say your favorite band was?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I didn't. But it's a three-way tie
dialog: between the Stooges, Patti Smith and
dialog: the Runaways.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yeah, I definitely need to make you
dialog: some CDs. At least while my kid is
text: hanging out in there.
text: He gestures at Juno's burgeoning paunch.
text: Mark walks over to his music collections and starts pulling
dialog: CD's. He's got a Carpenter's disc, the "No Alternative"
dialog: charity compilation, and Mother Love Bone.
text: Juno spots a VHS TAPE on the coffee table and picks it up.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (reading title)
dialog: The Wizard of Gore?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: (distracted)
dialog: Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis.
dialog: He's the ultimate master of horror.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate
dialog: master of horror.
text: Mark SWIVELS AROUND slowly on his desk chair, surprised.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Argento's good, but Lewis is
dialog: completely demented. We're talking
text: buckets of goo. Red corn syrup
dialog: everywhere. And fake brains up the
dialog: yin-yang.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (examining the tape
dialog: box)
dialog: Frankly, this looks kind of stupid.
text: Mark gives a look - "Oh, Really?"
scene_heading: INT. LORING HOUSE - DEN - AFTERNOON
dialog: We see some particularly memorable footage from The Wizard
dialog: of Gore.
text: Mark and Juno are watching the movie and drinking root beer
text: floats. They're sitting dangerously close on the sofa.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (watching movie)
dialog: This is even better than Suspiria.
dialog: You've got decent taste in slasher
dialog: movies, Mark.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Here's to dovetailing interests.
text: He raises his mug in a toast and Juno clinks it awkwardly.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: So, have you and Vanessa thought of
dialog: a name for the baby yet?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison
dialog: for a girl.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (aghast)
dialog: Madison? Isn't that kind of... I
dialog: don't know, gay?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: God, pretentious much? I guess
dialog: everyone should have a mysterious
dialog: name like Juno, huh?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: My dad went through this phase where
dialog: he was obsessed with Greek and Roman
dialog: mythology. He named me after Zeus's
dialog: wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays,
dialog: but I'm pretty sure Juno was his
dialog: only wife. She was supposed to be
dialog: really beautiful but really mean.
dialog: Like Diana Ross.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: That suits you.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Uh, thanks.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You know, not many teenage girls in
dialog: your situation would actually go
dialog: through with this.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I weighed my options. But after all
dialog: this, I'm glad I didn't, you know,
dialog: get rid of it. I want to have it.
dialog: For you guys.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You're something else.
text: A door suddenly slams upstairs. Vanessa's home.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Why? What the big deal?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Nothing. She just hates when I sit
dialog: around watching movies and 'not
dialog: contributing.'
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I'll handle this. I'm really good at
text: diffusing mom-type rage.
text: Juno jumps up and rushes out.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Wait... aww, crap!
scene_heading: INT. LORING HOUSE - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON
text: Vanessa slides her BRIEFCASE off her shoulder and ventures
text: into the living room. She's struggling to carry some oversized
dialog: shopping bags.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Mark? Are you home? I want to show
dialog: you some things I picked up.
text: Juno intercepts her breathlessly, clutching the ULTRASOUND
text: photo. Mark trails behind her.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Hi Vanessa!
text: Vanessa JUMPS and makes a strangled sound.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Juno! God, you startled me. What are
dialog: you doing here? What's wrong?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Nothing...
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Then what's going on?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I went to the doctor today.
text: Vanessa is obviously entertaining some worse-case scenarios.
text: Her eyes are wide and she's uncharacteristically ruffled.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Is the baby okay?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Sure. It's the right size and
dialog: everything. I even saw its phalanges
dialog: today! Check this...
text: She holds the ULTRASOUND up to show Vanessa and drapes her
text: arm around her.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: What...
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: This is the baby. Your baby.
text: Vanessa drops the shopping bags, sick with relief.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Oh my God...
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (kindly)
dialog: Doesn't it look like it's waving?
dialog: It's kind of like it's saying "Hi,
dialog: Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Yeah. Yeah, it kind of does.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Juno was nice enough to bring this
dialog: by for us.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I came over as soon as I got that
text: cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis.
dialog: My stepmom verbally abused the
dialog: ultrasound tech so we were escorted
text: off the premises.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: (distracted)
dialog: Oh, that's great!
text: She can't divert her gaze from the photo.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: See? Nothing to worry about.
text: Vanessa chuckles tightly, clearly embarrassed by her show of
dialog: emotion.
scene_heading: INT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY WAY - DAY
text: Vanessa and Mark walk Juno out. Juno peers at some shopping
text: bags from various kids stores.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Oh it's just some stuff I picked up.
dialog: For, you know, the baby. Babies need
dialog: a lot of things. I want everything
dialog: to be just right.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I thought people got all that stuff
dialog: at baby showers. When my stepmom had
dialog: my sister I remember she got about a
dialog: million presents. They were all lame
dialog: though, so I wasn't jealous.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Um, I think people are kind of unsure
dialog: about the situation because it's
dialog: not, you know, set in stone.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: What do you mean? You mean...
dialog: (aghast)
dialog: Do you think I'm going to flake out
dialog: on you?
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: No, no, I don't think that, Juno.
dialog: It's just that, we went through a
dialog: situation before where it didn't
dialog: work out.
text: Juno glances at Mark and again at Vanessa. Vanessa looks
dialog: embarrassed.
speaker_heading: MARK
text: Cold feet.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: You should have gone to China. I
dialog: heard they give away babies like
dialog: free iPods. They shoot 'em out of
text: those T-shirt guns at sports events.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: (abruptly)
dialog: Right. Well, Juno, your parents must
dialog: be wondering where you are. You might
dialog: want to head home.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they
dialog: figure nothing worse could happen to
dialog: me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was
dialog: nice seeing you guys again.
text: She waves and heads for the door.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: (to Juno)
dialog: Hey, don't forget your bag.
text: Vanessa looks pain-stricken as Mark helps Juno with her bag.
scene_heading: EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Juno kicks the snow off her shoes before she enters.
scene_heading: INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Bren sits at the kitchen table with a mug of coffee and an
dialog: issue of Dog Fancy.
text: Juno enters nonchalantly, drinking a giant slushie.
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark
dialog: and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I
dialog: wound up staying for a couple of
dialog: hours.
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: A couple of hours? Why are you going
dialog: up there in the first place?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: They said they wanted to know about
dialog: this stuff. They said to keep them
dialog: updated, so I did!
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: You could have sent it to them. Why
dialog: would you drive an hour out to East
dialog: Jesus, Nowhere?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I don't know, I just did. And while
dialog: we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark
dialog: and I watched The Wizard of Gore and
dialog: he burned me some CDs of weird music.
dialog: He's kind of cool.
text: A beat as Bren absorbs this.
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a
dialog: married stranger. You overstepped a
dialog: boundary.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're
text: the one overstepping boundaries.
dialog: You're acting like you're the one
dialog: who has to go through this and get
dialog: huge and push a baby out of your vag
dialog: for someone else. Besides, who cares
dialog: if he's married? I can have friends
dialog: who are married.
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You
dialog: don't know squat about the dynamics
dialog: of marriage.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: You don't know anything about me!
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: I know enough.
text: Bren rises to leave, clutching the Dog Fancy magazine.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (gesturing to the
dialog: magazine)
dialog: We don't even have a dog!
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: Yeah, because you're allergic to
dialog: their saliva. I've made a lot of
dialog: sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a
dialog: couple years you're going to move
dialog: out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Wow, dream big!
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: Oh, go fly a kite.
text: Bren STORMS out. Juno heads to the URN by the door and
text: defiantly pours the remains of her blue slushie into it.
scene_heading: EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Juno parks her PREVIA on the street. She walks up to the
text: house and rings the doorbell.
text: BLEEKER'S MOM answers, visibly annoyed. Her eyes drift down
dialog: to Juno's middle.
speaker_heading: JUNO (V.O.)
dialog: Bleeker's mom was possibly attractive
text: once. But now she looks a hobbit.
dialog: The fat one that was in The Goonies.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER'S MOM
dialog: Hi Juno. What can I do for you?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I borrowed Paulie's physics notes in
dialog: school today. I'm pretty sure he
dialog: needs them back, or his grade could
text: plummet to an A minus.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER'S MOM
dialog: Fine. Come in.
text: She steals another glance at Juno's belly.
scene_heading: INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Bleeker's mom escorts Juno wordlessly up the stairs and down
text: the hallway to Paulie's bedroom. Juno discreetly tries to
text: charge ahead of her, but her expanding middle prevents her
text: from getting past Bleeker's mom. They share an extremely
text: awkward moment wedged side-by-side in the narrow hallway.
text: Bleecker's mom nudges past Juno and knocks on Bleeker's
text: bedroom door. The door has a cheesy racecar-themed decoration
text: hanging on it that says PAULIE'S VRROOOM! It looks like
dialog: something a 5-year old might have.
scene_heading: INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - PAULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Paulie is on the floor surrounded by old quizzes, studying
text: like the tortured brainiac he is. Mrs. Bleeker opens the
text: bedroom door. Juno appears. Paulie jumps, startled.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Hey, don't concentrate so hard, man.
dialog: I think I smell hair burning.
text: Bleeker smiles faintly.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER'S MOM
text: Ten minutes.
text: She closes the door halfway and leaves. Juno rolls her eyes
text: and pulls the door shut entirely.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: What's up?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I just wanted to come over. You know,
dialog: say hi. I miss hanging out with you
dialog: on school nights.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: I miss it too.
text: He nervously cracks open a container of ORANGE TIC-TACS and
text: pours them into his mouth.
speaker_heading: JUNO (V.O.)
dialog: Orange Tic-Tacs are Bleeker's one
dialog: and only vice. When we made out, the
dialog: day I got pregnant, his mouth tasted
text: really tangy and delicious.
scene_heading: INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - "MOLD-O'-RIFFIC" BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: CU ON BLEEKER'S MOUTH AS HE KISSES JUNO FOR THE FIRST TIME
scene_heading: INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - PAULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Bleeker glances at Juno's midsection, embarrassed.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: So, it looks like you're getting
dialog: pregnant-er these days.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private
dialog: adoption thing. These married people
dialog: in Saint Cloud are going to be the
dialog: parents.
text: Bleeker is visibly relieved.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Really? What are they like?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: The guy is super cool! His name is
dialog: Mark and he's into old horror movies
dialog: and he plays guitar. I actually hung
dialog: out with him today.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Is that normal?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I asked my dad and Bren not to narc
dialog: us out to your folks, so we should
dialog: be safe.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Oh. That's a relief.
text: Juno walks over to the bed and sits down next to Bleeker.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I'm going to really start looking
dialog: like a dork soon. Will you still
dialog: think I'm cute if I'm huge?
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: I always think you're cute. I think
dialog: you're beautiful.
text: Juno is caught off guard by his sincerity.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Jesus, Bleek.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Well, I do.
text: The song playing ends, and another one begins. It's "the
text: song," the track that Bleeker and Juno both recognize from
text: the infamous night in the basement.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Hey Junebug, when all this is over
dialog: we should get the band back together
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new
dialog: drumhead we should be good to go.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: We could get back together too.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Were we together?
text: Bleeker picks at the carpet, dejected.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Well, we were once. You know, that
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: What about Katrina De Voort? You
dialog: could go out with Katrina De Voort.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: I don't like Katrina.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I totally heard you did.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: I don't. Katrina smells like soup.
text: Her whole house smells of soup.
scene_heading: EXT. LORING HOUSE - DAY
text: The house is covered in fresh snow.
scene_heading: INT. LORING HOUSE - NURSERY - DAY
text: Mark and Vanessa stand silently in the nursery. The walls
text: are primed slate gray. A single ANTIQUE ROCKING CHAIR sits
text: in the corner. Vanessa beams proudly and holds two paint
text: samples up near the wall.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: What do you think? Custard or
dialog: Cheesecake?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: They're yellow.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Well, I wanted to pick something
dialog: gender-neutral for now. Once we get
dialog: the baby, God willing, we can create
text: a more decisive palette.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Why do people think yellow is gender-
dialog: neutral? I don't know one man with a
dialog: yellow bedroom.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: I think I'm leaning toward Custard
dialog: in this light. I don't know. I should
dialog: paint a small area...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Or you could just wait a couple
dialog: months. It's not like the baby's
dialog: going to storm in here any second
text: and demand dessert-colored walls.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: What to Expect says that readying
dialog: the baby's room is an important
dialog: process for women. It's called
dialog: "nesting."
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Nesting, huh? Are you planning to
text: build the crib out of twigs and
dialog: saliva?
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: You should read the book. I even
dialog: flagged the "daddy chapters" for
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I just think it's too early to paint.
dialog: That's my opinion.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: And I disagree.
text: Mark shrugs, resigned.
text: Vanessa points to the nursery's largest wall.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: That wall is going to need something.
dialog: Maybe we could put our first family
dialog: picture there.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Hm.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Can you see it?
text: Mark stares at the wall, looking lost.
scene_heading: INT. RIDGEDALE MALL - DAY
text: Juno and Leah are walking through the mall, looking bored.
text: Juno is wearing one of Mac's giant hockey jerseys in lieu of
text: actual maternity wear. Leah gnaws on a giant cinnamon pretzel.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Yum. This pretzel tastes like a
dialog: friggin' donut!
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Share the love, Tits!
text: She wrestles Leah for the pretzel. Onlookers stare at them,
text: appalled, as Leah puts Juno in a half-Nelson.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (to eavesdroppers)
dialog: She's assaulting me! She's denying
dialog: me fresh-baked goodness!
text: Leah claps a hand over Juno's mouth.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (muffled)
dialog: Hly shht!
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: What?
text: Juno drags Leah behind a pillar and peers out from behind
text: it. They're watching a group of well-heeled women and their
text: children shopping en masse. One of the women is pushing a
text: toddler in an ultramodern stroller. And one of the women is
text: VANESSA, looking vaguely detached.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (hushed)
dialog: That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
text: Juno nods.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: No way! She's pretty.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: You sound shocked or something.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: I just thought she'd look really old
dialog: in real life.
text: The women gather near a play area, sip Frapps and loudly
text: discuss their outfits for an upcoming party.
speaker_heading: WOMAN #1
dialog: And I was like, "No offense, sweetie,
dialog: but nobody looks good in gauchos."
speaker_heading: WOMAN #2
dialog: Especially not with her build.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (mimicking the women,
dialog: Peanuts-style)
dialog: Wah-wah-waaah!
text: One of the little girls in the group tugs at Vanessa's sleeve.
text: Vanessa happily follows the little girl over to their play
text: area and begins to play energetically with her.
text: Juno watches intently, but Leah just snickers.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: She's gonna steal that kid for her
dialog: collection.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Right, seriously.
text: They watch Vanessa for a few more moments. The other kids
text: wander over toward the play area while their mothers ignore
text: them. Vanessa continues to entertain the children.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Bo-ring!
text: Leah stands up. Juno lingers for a moment.
scene_heading: INT. RIDGEDALE MALL - ELEVATOR BANK - A HALF HOUR LATER
text: Leah and Juno approach the elevator.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I want a huge cookie. And like, a
text: lamb kebob. Simultaneously.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: God, Spermy. Must you always feed?
text: The elevator door opens, revealing... Vanessa.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Juno?
text: Juno tries her best to look enthused.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to
dialog: the mall today?
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Just, you know, shopping with my
dialog: girlfriends.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: You're gay?
text: Juno glares at Leah.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: (confused)
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Please excuse Leah. She's mentally
dialog: challenged.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically.
dialog: I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button
dialog: now!
text: She lifts her shirt and presses her popped-out NAVEL.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: That's great.
text: Vanessa is admiring the belly, when Juno grimaces.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Dude, it's moshing all over.
text: Vanessa looks confused.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (explains)
text: It's kicking.
text: Vanessa nods in understanding then begins summoning the
dialog: courage for an unusual request.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Are you kidding? Everyone at school
dialog: is always grabbing at my belly. I'm
dialog: like a legend. They call me the
dialog: Cautionary Whale.
text: She grabs Vanessa's hand and plants it on her stomach.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: I can't feel anything.
text: Vanessa moves her hand, wanting desperately to feel the baby.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: It's not moving for me.
text: She says this as though it's an admission of failure.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Oh, you should try talking to it.
text: They can apparently hear speech in
dialog: there, even though it sounds all ten
text: thousands leagues under the sea.
text: Vanessa kneels down next to the swell of Juno's belly.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Hi. Hi, baby. It's me. My name is
dialog: Vanessa. I can't wait to meet you.
text: Leah gives a look to Juno as if she's about to barf.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Can you hear me sweet angel?
text: Vanessa looks like she's giving up hope. Then suddenly,
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Oh my God -- It moved! I felt it!
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Elbow.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Wow! It's magical.
text: Juno smiles at Vanessa in awe of her genuine affection.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - MORNING
text: The streets are covered in muddy, slushy snow. The mud is
text: instantly TRAMPLED underfoot by the collective feet of the
text: Dancing Elk Track Team on their morning run.
scene_heading: INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - BREN'S DESK - DAY
text: Bren cuts the top three inches off a pair of Juno's jeans.
text: Then, using a sewing machine, begins attaching an elastic
dialog: waistband.
scene_heading: INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY
text: We're behind that same WAISTBAND, as Juno walks through the
text: students. Now, people seem to part the waters for the belly.
scene_heading: INT. LORING HOUSE - MARK'S "SPECIAL ROOM" - DAY
text: Mark has the Les Paul on his lap as he stares at the boards
dialog: of an awful commercial.
text: CU - THE SCRIPT (storyboards). A kitchen scene with a kid
text: eating a new breakfast product called -- BRUNCH BOWLZ.
text: Annoyed and out of ideas, Mark begins an impromptu song...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: IF YOU'RE TIRED OF BREAKFAST
text: BUT NOT HUNGRY FOR LUNCH,
dialog: MICROWAVE YOURSELF
text: A HEALTHY BOWL OF BRUNCH!
text: Mark drops his head, dejected. Then, the phone rings.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: (picks up)
dialog: Hello?
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - PHONE BOOTH - DAY
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: So, I've been spending a lot of time
dialog: listening to that weird CD you made
dialog: me.
text: Mark instantly smiles.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Oh really? What's the verdict?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Cute?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Well, when you're used to the raw
dialog: power of Iggy and the Stooges,
dialog: everything else sounds kind of
dialog: precious by comparison.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I imagine you have a collection of
dialog: punk chestnuts to prove your point.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Consider it your musical education.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'm dying to see what you've got to
dialog: teach me.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Okay, stop surfing porn and get back
dialog: to work. Just wanted to say hi.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Go learn something.
text: Mark hangs up. Smiles.
scene_heading: INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY
text: CU on Juno's tray sliding along, picking up an odd combo of
dialog: pregnant food.
text: Pull up to find Juno and Leah walking their trays to a table.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: God, you're getting huge. How many
dialog: months has it been now?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Almost eight. You wouldn't believe
dialog: how weird I look naked.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: I wish my funbags would get bigger.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Trust me, you don't. I actually have
dialog: to wear a bra now. And I have to rub
dialog: this nasty cocoa butter stuff all
dialog: over myself or my skin could get
text: stretched too far and explode.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Hot!
scene_heading: INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Juno and Leah are sitting inside an emptied awards case on
text: the wall, eating their lunch.
text: Juno notices that the other kids in the cafeteria can't help
text: but glance her way. Some look derisive, others are amused.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: God, why is everyone always staring
dialog: at me?
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Well, you are kind of... convex.
text: She illustrates by making a rounded gesture near her stomach.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Wow, someone's been actually doing
dialog: her geometry homework for once!
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: I don't have a choice. Keith's been
dialog: grading me really hard lately.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers
dialog: as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is
dialog: already heightened these days.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Keith's hot.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Eww, he's all beardy!
text: We see KEITH the teacher talking to some science kids in the
text: background. He has a Wild America beard. He lifts a cup of
text: coffee to his lips and slurps lustily.
text: BACK ON JUNO AND LEAH:
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Did you hear Bleek is going to prom
dialog: with Katrina De Voort?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't
dialog: like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: He asked her. I heard they were going
dialog: to Benihana, then the prom, then to
text: Vijay's parents' cabin.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house
dialog: reeks of soup!
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Oh, it totally does. I was there for
dialog: her birthday about four years ago
dialog: and it was like Lipton Landing. But
dialog: you know, boys have endured worse
dialog: things for nookie.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: There's no way in hell they're having
dialog: sex or even holding hands.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: I wouldn't be so sure about that. He
dialog: did it with you. He's a man now.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're
dialog: best friends.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Are you jealous? I thought you said
dialog: you didn't care what he did.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I'm not jealous, and I don't care. I
dialog: just know he doesn't like Katrina
dialog: and I don't think he should toy with
text: her emotions like that. She seems so
dialog: nice and all.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once
dialog: you're old enough to go, it's not
dialog: cool anymore.
scene_heading: INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - BLEEKER'S LOCKER - DAY
text: Bleeker retrieves a book from his open locker. Juno marches
text: up to him, belly leading the way.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Are you honestly and truly going to
dialog: prom with Katrina De Voort?
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Um, hi?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Leah just told me you were going
dialog: with her.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to
dialog: go. A bunch of us from the team are
dialog: going to Benihana, then the prom,
text: then Vijay's parents' cabin.
text: Juno is clearly AFFRONTED.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: (meekly)
dialog: We're getting a stretch limo.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Your mom must be really glad you're
dialog: not taking me.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: You're mad. Why are you mad?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great
dialog: mood. Despite the fact that I'm
dialog: trapped in a fat suit I can't take
dialog: off, despite the fact that everyone
dialog: is making fun of me behind my back,
dialog: despite the fact that your little
dialog: girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in
dialog: art class yesterday...
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Katrina's not my girlfriend! And I
dialog: doubt she was actually giving you
text: the stinkeye. She just looks like
dialog: that all the time.
text: A GIRL strides past (obviously KATRINA) with a sour look
text: aimed squarely at Juno.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Whatever. Have fun at the prom with
dialog: Soupy Sales. I'm sure I can think of
dialog: something way more cool to do that
dialog: night. Like I could pumice my feet,
dialog: or go to Bren's dumb Unitarian church,
dialog: or get hit by a ten-ton truck full
dialog: of hot garbage juice. All those things
dialog: would be exponentially cooler than
dialog: going to the prom with you.
text: She starts to walk away.
text: Bleeker takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: You're being really immature.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (turning around)
dialog: What?
text: Bleeker BRACES himself and pushes up his lab goggles.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: That's not how our thing works! I
dialog: hurl the accusations and you talk me
dialog: down, remember?
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Not this time. You don't have any
dialog: reason to be mad at me. You broke my
dialog: heart. I should be royally ticked at
dialog: you, man. I should be really cheesed
dialog: off. I shouldn't want to talk to you
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Why? Because I got bored and had sex
dialog: with you one day, and then I didn't,
dialog: like, marry you?
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Like I'd marry you! You would be the
dialog: meanest wife of all time. And anyway,
dialog: I know you weren't bored that day
dialog: because there was a lot of stuff on
dialog: TV. The Blair Witch Project was on
dialog: Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I
dialog: want to watch this, but we should
dialog: make out instead. La la la."
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the
dialog: Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure
dialog: you guys will have a really bitchin'
dialog: time!
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: (searching for a
dialog: comeback)
dialog: Yeah, well... I still have your
dialog: underwear.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I still have your virginity!
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: (looking around,
dialog: panicked)
dialog: Oh my God, SHUT UP!
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: What? Are you ashamed that we did
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Well at least you don't have to walk
dialog: around with the evidence under your
dialog: sweater. I'm a planet!
text: Juno picks up her BACKPACK dejectedly and slides it over her
text: shoulder. She's about to walk away, when...
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Wait, let me take that.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: You shouldn't be carrying that heavy
dialog: bag. I'll take it.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Oh. It's fine. What's another ten
dialog: pounds?
text: She turns around, wipes TEARS off her cheek (making sure no
text: one sees) and continues down the hallway.
scene_heading: EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - PREVIA - DAY
text: Juno climbs ungracefully into the van. She starts the engine,
text: then pauses to dig through her backpack for something. She
text: produces a brush and begins brushing her hair in the rearview
text: mirror, examining herself self-consciously. She puts on some
text: Dr. Pepper Lip Smacker and backs out of the driveway.
scene_heading: INT. LORING HOUSE - MARK'S SPECIAL ROOM - DAY
text: Mark is seated at the computer, surfing a horror movie
text: website. He has the blank expression of a bored obsessive.
text: The doorbell rings.
scene_heading: INT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - DAY
text: Mark opens the door. Juno stands there, looking radiantly
text: knocked-up. She holds a stack of CDs. Mark breaks into a
dialog: grin.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Wow. That shirt is working hard.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (furtive)
dialog: Is Vanessa here?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Nope. We're safe.
text: He and Juno smile conspiratorially.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Cool.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Come on, I have something for you.
text: He gestures for Juno to follow him into the house.
scene_heading: INT. LORING HOUSE - BASEMENT - AFTERNOON
text: The Lorings' basement is dank, cluttered unfinished and
text: unattractive, much like Paulie Bleeker's. Mark pulls a chain
text: to illuminate a bare bulb.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room?
dialog: It's beautiful!
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my
dialog: old comics down here, and I want to
dialog: show you one of them.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Oh God, you're one of those guys...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You're gonna like this, I promise.
text: Mark RUMMAGES through a cardboard box in the corner.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: (extracting a bagged
speaker_heading: COMIC from the box)
dialog: Here it is.
text: He shows the COMIC to Juno. It's called "Most Fruitful Yuki."
text: It depicts a pregnant JAPANESE GIRL kicking ass and taking
dialog: names.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: "Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh
dialog: my god, she's a pregnant superhero!
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Isn't that great? I got it when I
dialog: was in Japan with my band. She reminds
dialog: me of you.
text: Juno examines the comic. "Most Fruitful Yuki" does resemble
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Wow, I actually feel like less of a
dialog: fat dork now.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man.
dialog: You should be proud to be the same
dialog: condition.
text: She throws a KARATE KICK in Mark's direction with a KEE-YA!
text: Juno is sincerely pleased.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Okay, how about some tunes?
text: There's a battered portable CD player in the corner. Juno
text: kneels down and pops in one of the discs.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Now this first one is kinda slow.
dialog: But it's Mott the Hoople so it's
text: still totally rad and hardcore.
text: Juno puts in the CD and "All The Young Dudes" fills the room.
text: Mark Laughs.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I actually know this one.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: You do?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yeah, this song's older than me, if
dialog: you can believe that. I danced to it
dialog: at my senior prom.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: That's almost interesting, Mark. Who
dialog: did you dance with?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she
dialog: was a good dance partner. Even let
text: me put my hands on her butt.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Oh man, I can just picture you slow
dialog: dancing like a dork!
text: She mockingly places her hands on Mark's waist and moves
text: back and forth stiffly.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No, I put my hands on your waist.
dialog: Then you put your arms around my
dialog: neck. That's how we did it in '88.
text: Mark puts his hands on what remains of Juno's waist. She
text: drapes her arms around his neck self-consciously.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Oh, okay. Like this.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You've never been to a dance, have
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (casually defensive)
text: Only squares and nerds go to dances.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What are you?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I don't know.
text: They SWAY slowly to the music. Juno's belly bumps up against
dialog: Mark.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I feel like there's something between
dialog: us.
text: They laugh.
text: Juno rests her head on Mark's chest. They dance in silence
text: for a few moments, then stop moving. Mark pulls Juno as close
text: as he possibly can, given her expanding girth.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'm leaving Vanessa.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (quiet at first)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: It's just not working out, but I'm
dialog: getting my own place in the city...
dialog: and I've got it all planned out.
dialog: It's something I've wanted to do for
dialog: a long time...
text: Juno backs away.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (growing)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: No. No, you definitely cannot do
dialog: that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack
dialog: of no!
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: This isn't what we agreed on. You
dialog: guys have to take care of... this!
dialog: You are the chosen custodians of the
dialog: big-ass bump!
text: She GESTURES wildly to her belly. Suddenly, something matters
text: to her far more than the approval of an older guy.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: But I thought you'd be cool if...
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: I want you guys to adopt the Buglet.
dialog: I wanted everything to be perfect.
dialog: Not shitty and broken like everyone
dialog: else's family. Listen, once I have
text: the baby, Vanessa is going to finally
dialog: be happy, and everything will be all
dialog: right. Believe me on this one!
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: A baby is not going to fix everything.
dialog: Besides, I don't know if I'm ready
dialog: to be a father.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (aghast)
dialog: But you're old!
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I... How do you think of me, Juno?
dialog: Why are you here?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I don't know. I just liked being
dialog: your friend. I sort of liked becoming
dialog: furniture in your weird life.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: This...
text: (he gestures to the
dialog: dank surrounding
dialog: room)
dialog: ...this is what my life has become.
text: Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground.
dialog: Is that so appealing to you?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault?
dialog: Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: That's not the point. We're just not
dialog: in love anymore.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa
dialog: when you married her? If you love
dialog: someone once, you can love them again,
dialog: I know it. My friend Leah has gone
dialog: out with the same guy, like, four
dialog: times. You're just not trying.
text: Mark suddenly sees Juno for what she is -- a teenage girl.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'm such an idiot. I can't believe
dialog: what an idiot I am.
text: He paces over to the wall and KICKS it softly.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Please don't get a divorce! God,
dialog: Mark, just do me a solid and stay
dialog: with your wife.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: God, you're so young.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Not really. I'm sixteen. I'm old
dialog: enough to tell when people are acting
dialog: like total a-holes!
text: Juno turns to leave, then shoots one furious look back at
dialog: Mark.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Oh and by the way, I bought another
dialog: Sonic Youth album and it's the worst
dialog: thing I've ever heard! It's just
dialog: noise, man!
text: She bolts up the stairs, sobbing.
scene_heading: INT. LORING HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Juno reaches the top of the stairs and scrambles toward the
text: front door, only to be intercepted by Vanessa, who's returning
text: home from work, carrying her briefcase and a freshly purchased
text: NURSING PILLOW. They nearly collide.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Juno? What's going on?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Nothing.
text: It's obvious from Juno's tears and flushed face that she's
text: lying. Vanessa instantly goes pale with fear, but she tries
text: her hardest to seem serene and "together" in front of Juno.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: (pretending to be
dialog: calm)
dialog: Mark? Why is Juno crying?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine
dialog: home furnishings. See you later.
text: She rushes toward the door.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Hold on.
text: Juno halts.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Juno, what's the matter?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: She's hormonal. Right, June? It's
dialog: just part of the whole process.
text: Juno looks totally betrayed. She doesn't respond. Vanessa
text: looks at Juno's expression and knows Mark is lying.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: What did you do?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I didn't do anything... I just...
dialog: I've just been thinking.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: (you've been thinking?)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Just thinking if this is really the
dialog: right thing for us.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: What are you referring to?
text: She knows exactly to what he's referring.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I've been just wondering if we're,
dialog: you know, ready.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Of course we're ready. We've taken
dialog: all the classes. The nursery. The
dialog: books --
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I know we're prepared. I just don't
dialog: know if... I'm ready.
text: Juno's face continues to fall. Vanessa notices.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: (to Juno)
dialog: Juno, don't worry about this. He
dialog: just has cold feet. That's how boys
dialog: are. The books all say the same thing.
text: A woman becomes a mother when she
text: gets pregnant. A man becomes a father
text: when he sees his baby. He's going to
dialog: get there. He'll get there.
dialog: Juno ain't buying it.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: (to Mark)
dialog: Why don't we let Juno go home and we
dialog: can discuss this later on, okay?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: It all just happened so fast. We put
dialog: that ad in the paper. I thought it
dialog: would take months if, you know, ever
dialog: and then -- boom -- Two weeks later,
text: she's in our living room.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: She answered our prayers.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: (ignores the comment)
dialog: Ever since, it's just been like a
text: ticking clock.
text: This stops Vanessa. Juno looks offended.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: What are you saying?
text: A long hideous beat.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: It just feels a little like bad
dialog: timing.
text: Another hideous beat.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: What would be a good time for you?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I don't know. There's just things I
dialog: still want to do.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Like what? Be a rock star?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Don't mock me.
text: Vanessa sighs. It's done.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: You're trying to do something that's
dialog: never going to happen. And you know
dialog: what? Your shirt is stupid. Grow up.
dialog: If I have to wait for you to become
dialog: Kurt Cobain, I'm never going to be a
dialog: mother.
text: Vanessa looks defeated.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I never said I'd be a great father.
text: We hear the front door closing. Vanessa and Mark look over
text: and notice that Juno has escaped the conflict.
scene_heading: EXT. LORING HOUSE - AFTERNOON
text: Juno runs up to her car sobbing. She struggles with the keys,
text: but finally makes it into the Previa and drives off.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - AFTERNOON
text: The Previa slides off the road and comes to a stop on the
dialog: shoulder.
scene_heading: INT. PREVIA - AFTERNOON
text: Juno buckles over the steering wheel, crying, unwinding for
text: the first time since she became pregnant.
text: After a beat, she begins to gather herself.
scene_heading: INT. BLEEKER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Bleeker is sitting next to his bed, noodling on the guitar.
dialog: He's playing a theme that we will soon recognise.
scene_heading: EXT. CORNER STORE - NIGHT
text: Juno lays on the hood of her Previa, contemplating her future.
text: We push in close... when she gets an idea.
text: She hops off the hood and scurries into the Previa where she
text: finds a crumpled up Jiffy Lube receipt. She unfolds it and
text: pulls out a pen, ready to write something... a note?
scene_heading: EXT. LORING HOUSE - NIGHT
text: It's quiet after the storm. Inside, we see Vanessa sitting
text: alone at her perfect dining room table, drinking a glass of
dialog: wine.
scene_heading: INT. LORING HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Vanessa takes a sip and continues to let the days events
text: sink in. After a beat, Mark comes down the stairs to join
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I called Gerta Rauss. She says she
dialog: can represent both of us. They call
dialog: it "collaborative divorce." It's
text: apparently all the rage right now.
dialog: And it's easy because we don't have
dialog: children.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: No, it's fine. Thanks for making the
dialog: call, I guess.
text: Mark nods and sits down.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: We're actually, finally doing this?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Looks like it, yeah.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Have you found a place to stay?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yeah, downtown.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: A hotel?
speaker_heading: MARK
text: It's a loft.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: (lightly teasing)
dialog: Aren't you the cool guy?
text: They STARE at the wall, speechless and defeated.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: I wanted a baby so bad. So bad.
text: She buries her head in her hands.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I know you did.
text: There's a LOUD KNOCK on the front door.
scene_heading: EXT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - NIGHT
text: Mark opens the door. There's a folded piece of paper sitting
text: on the doormat. He squints and sees Juno pulling away in the
dialog: van.
text: Mark carefully unfolds the piece of paper -- it takes a minute
text: because of Juno's proficiency in "teen girl origami." He
text: holds it up. We can see there's WRITING on the back.
speaker_heading: MARK
text: It looks like a bill from Jiffy-Lube.
text: Vanessa takes the note from his hand and turns it over,
text: examining it.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: It's for me.
scene_heading: EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Juno parks her car and walks up to her house. A porch light's
text: been left on for her, and the place looks cozy and inviting.
speaker_heading: JUNO (V.O.)
dialog: I never realize how much I like being
dialog: home unless I've been somewhere really
dialog: different for a while.
text: She picks a CROCUS from the unkempt garden near the porch
text: and sniffs it. She lifts her shirt and tickles her belly
text: with it. Then she tucks the flower into her unkempt hair.
scene_heading: INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Mac is alone at the kitchen table going over the family
text: finances while drinking one of Bren's weight loss shakes.
text: Juno enters.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Hi Dad.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Hey, big puffy version of Junebug.
dialog: Where have you been?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Dealing with stuff way beyond my
dialog: maturity level. Where is everyone?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot
dialog: ice skating class.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate.
dialog: Liberty Bell's still getting the
dialog: hang of stairs.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: No, but you know Bren. She dreams
dialog: big.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Yeah, she does.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: You look a little morose, honey.
dialog: What's eating you?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I'm losing my faith in humanity.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Think you can narrow it down for me.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I guess I wonder sometimes if people
dialog: ever stay together for good.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: You mean like couples?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Yeah, like people in love.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Are you having boy trouble? I gotta
dialog: be honest; I don't much approve of
dialog: you dating in your condition,
dialog: 'cause... well, that's kind of messed
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Dad, no!
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't
dialog: that what you girls call it? Skanky?
dialog: Skeevy?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Please stop now.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: (persisting)
dialog: Tore up from the floor up?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Dad, it's not about that. I just
dialog: need to know that it's possible for
dialog: two people to stay happy together
dialog: forever. Or at least for a few years.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: It's not easy, that's for sure. Now,
dialog: I may not have the best track record
dialog: in the world, but I have been with
dialog: your stepmother for ten years now,
dialog: and I'm proud to say that we're very
dialog: happy.
text: Juno nods in agreement.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: In my opinion, the best thing you
dialog: can do is to find a person who loves
dialog: you for exactly what you are. Good
dialog: mood, bad mood, ugly, pretty,
dialog: handsome, what have you, the right
dialog: person will still think that the sun
dialog: shines out your ass. That's the kind
dialog: of person that's worth sticking with.
text: A wave of REALIZATION crosses Juno's face.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I sort of already have.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You
dialog: know I'll always be there to love
dialog: and support you, no matter what kind
dialog: of pickle you're in.
text: He nods toward her belly.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Obviously.
text: Juno laughs and hugs her father, planting a smooch on his
dialog: cheek.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I need to go out somewhere for just
dialog: a little while. I don't have any
dialog: homework, and I swear I'll be back
dialog: by ten.
text: She salutes and dashes out of the kitchen.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: You were talking about me, right?
speaker_heading: MONTAGE:
scene_heading: INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - BLEEKER'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: We push in over Bleeker sleeping in his car-bed towards the
text: window. We look out onto the lawn to find Juno and Leah
text: running back to the Previa, hopping in, and screeching off.
scene_heading: EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - MORNING
text: Bleeker steps out of the house for his usual early-morning
text: run. He looks down to see a message scrawled in chalk on the
text: stoop: "BLEEKER -- CHECK THE MAIL."
text: He walks down to the end of the driveway and opens the latch
text: on the mailbox.
text: At least one hundred containers of ORANGE TIC TACS come
text: pouring out in an colorful deluge. They spill out onto the
text: driveway. Bleeker smiles.
scene_heading: EXT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - TRACK - MORNING
text: Juno waddles toward the field. The guys on the track team,
text: ridiculously arrayed as usual, are doing hurdler stretches.
text: They stare at her quizzically. Bleeker spots Juno approaching
text: and jogs up to the chainlink fence.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Did you put like a hundred things of
dialog: Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Yeah. That was me.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (blushes)
dialog: Because they're your fave. And you
dialog: can never have too much of your
dialog: favorite one-calorie breath mint.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty
text: much set until college on the Tic
text: Tac front.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: You know, I've been thinking. I'm
dialog: really sorry I was such a huge bitch
dialog: to you. You didn't deserve that. You
dialog: never deserve any of the poo I unload
dialog: on you.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: You know it's okay.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Also, I think I'm in love with you.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: What, you mean as friends?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: No, for real. I think you are the
dialog: coolest person I've ever met. And
dialog: you don't even have to try.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: I try really hard, actually...
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: No, you're naturally smart. You always
dialog: think of the funniest things to do.
dialog: Remember when you passed me that
dialog: postcard during Spanish class, and
dialog: it was addressed like, "Junebug
dialog: MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the
dialog: Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having
dialog: fun in Barcelona -- wish you were
dialog: here"? That was hilarious.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: I was just bored. I only think school
dialog: is awesome like, 80% of the time.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Plus, you're the only person who
dialog: doesn't stare at my stomach all the
dialog: fucking time. You actually look at
dialog: my face. And every time I look at
dialog: you, the baby starts kicking me super
dialog: hard.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: It does?
text: Juno presses Bleeker's hand against her belly.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Wizard!
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: I think it's because my heart starts
dialog: pounding when I see you.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Mine too.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Basically, I'm completely smitten
dialog: with you, and I don't care if I'm
dialog: making an ass out of myself right
dialog: now, because you've seen me make an
dialog: ass out of myself a million times,
dialog: and you still want to be my friend.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Well, yeah. You're the best friend
dialog: I've ever had, even when you're being
dialog: kind of evil.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: That's all I need from you. That's
dialog: more than I could ever ask for. You're
dialog: just golden, dude.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Can we make out now?
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Okay.
text: Bleeker and Juno KISS, oblivious to the gawking track team
text: guys in the background.
text: In the distance, near the school entrance, we see STEVE
text: RENDAZO (the kid who always TORMENTS Juno) regarding the
text: makeout session with a sad, envious expression.
text: LEAH passes by, does a double take, then hurries up to the
text: fence, rolling her eyes.
speaker_heading: LEAH
dialog: (disgusted)
dialog: You know, you can go into early labor
dialog: sucking face like that!
text: Juno gives her the FINGER, not breaking the clinch with
dialog: Bleeker.
scene_heading: INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - JUNO'S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Juno is lying on her back on the bed, staring at the ceiling.
text: She's more pregnant than we've ever seen her. She revs a
text: Matchbox car against the slope of her belly and lets it roll.
text: Juno suddenly sits up, looking thoroughly freaked. She pats
text: her lap frantically and jumps off the bed.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Dad!
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - MAC'S WORK DESK - SAME
text: Mac looks up from the lure he's working on.
speaker_heading: MAC (O.S.)
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Either I just pissed my pants or...
speaker_heading: MAC (O.S.)
dialog: Or...
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Thundercats are go!
scene_heading: EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - DAY
text: Mac, Bren and Liberty Bell rush out of the house. They pile
text: into the Previa at breakneck speed. Juno waddles behind them,
dialog: protesting.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
text: CU of Juno wearing a puffy surgical cap. She's being pushed
text: down the hospital corridor in a wheelchair. She bursts into
text: giggles. Pull back to reveal her that Leah is pushing her
text: rather aggressively. Leah jokingly steers the wheelchair
text: into a wall. Juno feigns whiplash.
text: Bren appears behind them and orders Juno out of the
text: wheelchair, exasperated. She pulls off Juno's surgical cap.
text: Leah and Juno snicker.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - BIRTHING SUITE - DAY
text: We see Juno is in a BIRTHING SUITE at the hospital, pacing
text: impatiently, bent over in obvious discomfort. She's wearing
text: her Chuck Taylors and knee socks with her hospital gown.
text: Leah and Bren stand nearby.
text: Juno doubles over in pain.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: (panicked)
dialog: Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I
dialog: get that Spinal Tap thing?
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: It's called a spinal block, and you
dialog: can't have it yet, honey. The doctor
dialog: said you're not dilated enough.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: You mean I have to wait for it to
dialog: get even worse? Why can't they just
dialog: give it to me now?
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: Well, honey, doctors are sadists who
dialog: like to play God and watch lesser
text: people scream.
text: Juno lets out a genuine shriek of pain.
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: (checking her watch)
dialog: Shit.
dialog: (To the doctor)
dialog: Hey, can we give my kid the damn
dialog: spinal tap already?
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - BIRTHING SUITE - LATER
speaker_heading: JUNO (V.O.)
dialog: It really didn't hurt that bad having
dialog: him.
text: We see Juno in the process of delivery, from her POV. Leah
text: holds one of Juno's feet and Bren holds the other.
speaker_heading: JUNO (V.O.)
dialog: The best part was when I peed on
dialog: Leah during labor.
text: We see Leah holding Juno's FOOT, which is shaking. Leah's
text: shirt is soaked. She rolls her eyes and mouths "Fuck you" at
text: Juno. Juno's raised MIDDLE FINGER enters the frame.
speaker_heading: JUNO (V.O.)
text: And then, out of nowhere, there it
dialog: was...
text: The doctor reveals JUNO'S BABY BOY above the sheet.
speaker_heading: JUNO (V.O.)
dialog: There he was.
text: Juno looks at the baby in awe, then her eyes begin to
text: flutter... and she passes out.
scene_heading: EXT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - TRACK - AFTERNOON
text: Paulie Bleeker is running as fast as his legs can carry him
text: on the Dancing Elk track. There's a very sparse crowd in the
text: bleachers. As Paulie approaches the tape, his envious teammate
text: Vijay looks on. Bleeker's mom is seated near Vijay, holding
text: a video camera.
speaker_heading: JUNO (V.O.)
dialog: I decided to not call Bleeker to
dialog: tell him that I was having the baby.
dialog: He had a big meet against Manteno
dialog: and I didn't want him to get all
dialog: worried about me and choke.
text: Paulie breaks the tape, winning the race. The fifteen or so
text: people in attendance cheer.
speaker_heading: VIJAY
dialog: (admiringly)
text: His legs are as swift as his seed.
scene_heading: MRS. BLEEKER
dialog: What did you say?
text: Bleeker pants at the finish line, dripping with sweat.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: P. Bleeker has just broken a district
dialog: record in the 400.
text: Bleeker looks out at the BLEACHERS, scanning them for Juno.
text: She's not there.
speaker_heading: JUNO (V.O.)
dialog: But he figured it out anyway.
text: Bleek takes off RUNNING toward the parking lot without
text: stopping to explain. His mother stands up, confused.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - MATERNITY WARD - DAY
text: A NURSE reaches into one of the maternity ward bassinets and
text: gently lifts up a swaddled newborn baby.
text: The nurse turns and addresses an unseen spectator.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Would you like to meet your son?
text: Pull back to reveal she's speaking to VANESSA, who stands,
text: paralyzed, several feet away.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: I have a son?
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: (amused)
dialog: You are the adoptive mother?
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: I have a son.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Healthy kid, too. Didn't waste any
dialog: time getting out.
text: Vanessa reaches out for the baby and gingerly accepts him in
text: her eyes. She spends a few moments just looking at him.
text: She feels someone watching her, then looks up to see a Bren
text: leaning against the doorway.
text: Vanessa blinks away her tears self-consciously.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: How do I look?
speaker_heading: BREN
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Like a mom. Scared shitless.
text: Vanessa laughs.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - BIRTHING SUITE - DAY
text: Juno is curled up on her bed in the birthing room. The birth
text: is obviously over; there's that air of stillness and
text: accomplishment, a task completed. The doctors have cleared
text: out. Mac sits in a chair next to the bed, looking like he's
dialog: not sure what to say.
text: He holds up a deck of Playing cards as if to initiate a game,
text: but Juno gently pushes his hand away. Their eyes meet. His
text: expression is helpless, hers is utterly drained.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Someday, you'll be back here, honey.
dialog: On your terms.
text: Juno nods and swallows.
text: Over Mac's shoulder, a silhouette appears in the doorway.
text: It's Bleeker in his track uniform.
text: Juno sees him and bursts into sudden, ragged sobs. Mac glances
text: at her, alarmed. Paulie moves toward the bed. Mac clears his
text: throat, gets up and leaves the room.
text: Paulie climbs onto the hospital bed and carefully puts his
text: arm around Juno. She leans into him, letting herself go for
dialog: the first time in months.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - BIRTHING SUITE - EVENING
text: Juno lies on the bed. She looks rested and relaxed compared
text: to her earlier crying jag, but her face is still pink and
text: swollen. Bleeker is curled up next to her, still in his track
text: uniform and spikes.
speaker_heading: JUNO (V.O.)
dialog: Bleeker decided he didn't want to
dialog: see the baby. Neither did I, really.
dialog: He didn't feel like ours.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - MATERNITY WARD - EVENING
text: We see Vanessa leaning over the bassinet, unable to take her
text: eyes off the baby, touching it's hair reverently.
speaker_heading: JUNO (V.O.)
dialog: I think he was always hers.
scene_heading: INT. LORING HOUSE - NURSERY - DAY
text: The nursery is perfectly decorated in Vanessa's immaculate
text: taste. Nothing looks as though it's been touched. We see the
text: antique ROCKING CHAIR sitting empty.
speaker_heading: JUNO (V.O.)
text: It ended with a chair.
text: We pan past the wall Vanessa had said "needed something."
text: There's a framed note on the wall. It looks like it was
text: handwritten on the back of a Jiffy Lube bill. We see that it
dialog: says: "Vanessa -- If you're still in, I'm still in. Juno."
text: We move to the door and get a view of Vanessa's bedroom. We
text: see her lying in bed with a burp cloth draped over her
text: shoulder, feeding the baby. For the first time ever, Vanessa
text: looks disorganized, unshowered -- and incredibly happy. There
text: are formula bottles on the bedside table and a bassinet pushed
text: close to the bed. Obviously, she hasn't been away from the
text: baby for a single moment.
text: The baby reaches up and grabs Vanessa's thumb. Vanessa glows
text: with an expression of pure bliss.
scene_heading: EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - DAY
text: It's a sparkling summer afternoon. Juno wheels her bicycle
text: out of the detached garage. She waves goodbye to Bren, who
text: is playing in the yard with two WEIMARANERS. She looks almost
text: as happy with her dogs as VANESSA looked with her baby.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - DAY
text: Juno rides her bike aggressively down the street. Her guitar
text: is slung over her shoulder in a gig bag. She's obviously not
text: pregnant anymore. She looks happy, but older.
speaker_heading: JUNO (V.O.)
text: As boyfriends go, Paulie Bleeker is
dialog: totally boss. He is the cheese to my
dialog: macaroni. I know people are supposed
dialog: to fall in love before they reproduce,
dialog: but normalcy's not really our style.
text: As she tears recklessly down the street on her bikes, she
text: passes the Dancing Elk TRACK TEAM, still running in
text: outrageously skimpy shorts and bandanas.
text: Juno RIDES up to a garage where Bleeker is sitting, tuning
dialog: his guitar.
scene_heading: EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - DAY
text: Juno bikes up to find Bleeker sitting on the stoop. She smiles
text: and takes out her guitar. She sits across from Bleeker and
text: pulls the pick out of the strings.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Ready?
text: Bleeker nods.
text: Juno begins strumming her guitar and playing "Anyone Else
text: But You," by the Moldy Peaches. Bleeker joins in. At first
text: their playing is discordant, but suddenly it works.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: You're a part time lover and a
dialog: fulltime friend. The monkey on your
dialog: back is the latest trend. I don't
dialog: see what anyone can see, in anyone
dialog: else but you.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: Here is the church and here is the
dialog: steeple. We sure are cute for two
dialog: ugly people. I don't see what anyone
dialog: can see, in anyone else but you.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: We both have shiny happy fits of
dialog: rage. You want more fans, I want
dialog: more stage. I don't see what anyone
dialog: can see, in anyone else but you.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: You are always trying to keep it
dialog: real. I'm in love with how you feel.
dialog: I don't see what anyone can see, in
dialog: anyone else but you.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: I kiss you on the brain in the shadow
dialog: of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed,
text: my body's swinging from side to side.
dialog: I don't see what anyone can see, in
dialog: anyone else but you.
speaker_heading: JUNO
dialog: The pebbles forgive me, the trees
dialog: forgive me. So why can't you forgive
dialog: me? I don't see what anyone can see,
dialog: in anyone else but you.
scene_heading: JUNO AND BLEEKER TOGETHER
dialog: Du du du du du du dudu. Du du du du
dialog: du du dudu. I don't see what anyone
dialog: can see, in anyone else but you.
text: She and Bleeker exchange glances as they play. They smile
text: ambiguously. Juno leans over and kisses Bleeker on the cheek.
text: Pull out to reveal the surrounding green suburb buzzing with
dialog: life and summer activity.
speaker_heading: FADE TO BLACK
