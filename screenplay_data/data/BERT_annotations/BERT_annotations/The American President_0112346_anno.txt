dialog: dialogue from various presidential speeches.
scene_heading: MAIN TITLES END ON
scene_heading: EXT. BEAUTIFUL ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY
text: It's an early November morning, and the sun has just come
dialog: over this extraordinary building. WE HOLD on this for a moment
dialog: before we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. A CORRIDOR IN THE RESIDENCE - DAY
text: A SECRET SERVICE AGENT presses the button by the private
text: elevator as he talks into his shirt cuff.
speaker_heading: AGENT COOPER
dialog: Liberty's moving.
text: Another AGENT rounds the corner into the corridor and is
dialog: followed a step or two later by
scene_heading: PRESIDENT ANDREW BENJAMIN SHEPHERD.
text: SHEPHERD's walking with his personal assistant, JANIE, a shy,
text: professional and incredibly efficient 25-year-old.
speaker_heading: JANIE
dialog: The 10:15 event's been moved inside
dialog: to the Indian Treaty Room.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: (to Janie)
dialog: The 10:15 is American Fisheries?
speaker_heading: JANIE
dialog: Yes, sir. They're giving you a
dialog: 200-pound halibut.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Janie, make a note. We need to
dialog: schedule more events where somebody
dialog: gives me a really big fish.
text: JANIE starts to make a note.
speaker_heading: JANIE
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Janie, I was kidding.
speaker_heading: JANIE
dialog: Of course, sir.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: (to the AGENT at the
dialog: elevator)
dialog: Hey, Cooper.
speaker_heading: AGENT COOPER
dialog: 'Morning, Mr. President.
text: SHEPHERD and JANIE enter the elevator. As the doors close...
speaker_heading: JANIE
dialog: Mr. Rothschild asked to have a moment
dialog: with you this morning.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Is he upset about the speech last night?
speaker_heading: JANIE
dialog: He seemed concerned.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Well, it wouldn't be a Monday morning
dialog: unless Lewis was concerned about
dialog: something I did Sunday night.
text: The elevator doors open, revealing LEWIS ROTHSCHILD. At 32,
dialog: LEWIS is the President's chief domestic policy advisor. It
dialog: would appear that he averages about two hours sleep a night,
text: though that doesn't seem to slow him down.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: You skipped the whole paragraph.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: (to Janie)
dialog: And Monday morning it is.
text: LEWIS falls into the pace as the three of them head for the
text: double doors leading to the South Lawn.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: "American can no longer afford to
dialog: pretend that they live in a great
dialog: society"...and then nothing. You
dialog: dumped the whole handguns paragraph.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: This is a time for prudence, Lewis.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: That was the kick-ass section.
text: The three of them are now OUTSIDE and making their way down
text: the COVERED WALKWAY that runs from the East Wing to the West
dialog: Wing.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: I thought what with being the
dialog: President and all...
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: Sir, of course I didn't mean to
dialog: imply--
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: I thought you'd be turning cartwheels
dialog: this morning, Lewis -- 63 percent job
dialog: approval.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: That's great news, sir, but...
text: They walk past a GROUNDKEEPER who's at work at a patch of grass.
speaker_heading: GROUNDKEEPER
dialog: 'Morning, Mr. President.
text: Before he's even completed the last syllable of the greeting,
dialog: JANIE quickly and quietly said--
speaker_heading: JANIE
dialog: Charlie.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: 'Morning, Charlie.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: Sir, the press is gonna need an
dialog: explanation.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: For what?
text: SHEPHERD, LEWIS and JANIE walk through the door being held
text: open by an AGENT. The conversation continues as they make
dialog: their way through the corridors of
scene_heading: INT. THE WEST WING - DAY
text: They walk quickly down a hallway teeming with STAFFERS, AIDES
text: AND OFFICE WORKERS.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: Because you dropped the whole kick-ass
dialog: section, now we've got this thing hanging
dialog: out there.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: There's a thing hanging out there?
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: "Americans can no longer afford to
dialog: pretend that they live in a great
dialog: society." Then ...nothing. No
dialog: explanation. No context. So now it's
dialog: just this thing.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: And it's hanging out there?
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: SHEPHERD stops at an open doorway, calls to a STAFFER--
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Maria--
speaker_heading: STAFFER (MARIA)
dialog: Good morning, sir.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Did they tell you I'm gonna need--
speaker_heading: STAFFER (MARIA)
dialog: --overall consumer spending and not
dialog: just first homes. Yes, sir. We'll have
dialog: it for you in 15 minutes.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Thanks.
text: SHEPHERD moves on. LEWIS and JANIE stay with him.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: Mr. President, I really feel we need
dialog: to focus on...
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Lewis, however much coffee you drink
dialog: in the morning, I want you to reduce it
dialog: by half.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: I don't drink coffee.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Then hit yourself over the head with
dialog: a baseball bat, would you please?
text: Another STAFFER crosses their path--
speaker_heading: JANIE
dialog: Happy birthday, Laura.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Hey, Laura, happy birthday.
speaker_heading: STAFFER (LAURA)
dialog: Thank you, sir.
dialog: Once out of earshot--
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
speaker_heading: (to JANIE)
dialog: I should send her some flowers.
speaker_heading: JANIE
dialog: You already did, sir.
text: And, with that, they walk through a doorway and into
scene_heading: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
text: In the OUTER OFFICE, MRS. CHAPIL, the President's secretary,
text: is hard at work on a word processor. She stands as SHEPHERD
dialog: walks in--
speaker_heading: MRS. CHAPIL
dialog: Good morning, Mr. President.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: How're you, Mrs. Chapil?
speaker_heading: MRS. CHAPIL
dialog: Fine, thank you, sir. Mr. Kodak left
dialog: the detailed breakdown of the approval
dialog: poll for you. He seemed to indicate that
dialog: it was very good news.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Sixty-three percent of it, at any rate.
text: And by now they're in the OVAL OFFICE itself. SHEPHERD has
text: gone to his desk and is looking over the various overnight
text: briefing memos that have been left for him. As someone used
dialog: to doing six things at once, he has no trouble reading,
text: listening, and talking at the same time.
speaker_heading: MRS. CHAPIL
dialog: Lucy called just a moment ago. You
dialog: forgot to sign her permission slip
dialog: for her class--
speaker_heading: JANIE
dialog: --the museum trip. I'll go get it.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
speaker_heading: (to JANIE)
dialog: What time does she get home today?
speaker_heading: JANIE
dialog: Three-twenty.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: How's my afternoon look?
speaker_heading: JANIE
dialog: Very crowded.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Schedule some time for me at 3:30.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Buenos dias, Senor Presidente.
text: This from ROBIN McCALL, a strikingly tall black woman and the
text: President's press secretary, as she strides into the room.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Too-tall McCall, how was Mexico?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I didn't truly appreciate it until I
dialog: came back and discovered that America
dialog: isn't a great society.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
speaker_heading: (to ROBIN)
dialog: He dumped a whole section.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Now there's a thing hanging out there.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Not a great society, sir?
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Well, with you out of the country, it
dialog: wasn't, Robin. Now that you're back,
dialog: we're great again.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: There's a press room full of people
dialog: saying "What did he mean by that?"
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: See?
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: (re: a memo he's been
dialog: looking at)
dialog: A.J., did you get one of these?
text: This is said to A. J. MACINERNEY as he walks through a
text: separate entrance on the left side of the room. In addition
dialog: to being the President's Chief of Staff and closest advisor,
dialog: he's the President's closest and oldest friend.
dialog: A.J.
dialog: Is that the letter from Solomon at
dialog: the GDC?
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: It would appear to be a letter from
dialog: the entire environmental community.
dialog: These people are outta control.
dialog: A.J.
dialog: I think they're just frustrated,
dialog: Mr. President.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Are they blaming the President for
dialog: global warming?
dialog: A.J.
dialog: Well, they don't think he caused it,
dialog: if that's what you mean.
dialog: (continuing;
speaker_heading: to SHEPHERD)
dialog: Sir, I'm on the phone with these
dialog: people twice a week. I honestly
dialog: don't know what they want at this
dialog: point.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: What they want is a 20 percent reduction in
dialog: fossil fuel emissions.
dialog: A.J.
dialog: It won't pass at 20 percent.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: We haven't really tried.
dialog: A.J.
dialog: Lewis, McSorley, McCluskey and Shane
dialog: hold too many markers. If we try to
dialog: push this through and lose, there will
dialog: be a very loud thud when we hit the
dialog: ground, and that's not what you want in
dialog: an election year.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Talk to the GDC again, A.J. Tell them
dialog: the President resents the implication
dialog: that he's turned his back on the
dialog: environment. Tell them I'll send 455 to
dialog: the floor. But we're gonna ask for a
dialog: 10 percent reduction. If they want to pull
dialog: their support, fine. At 63 percent job
dialog: approval rating. I don't need their help
dialog: getting a bill passed. We gotta get going--
dialog: where's Leon?
dialog: A.J.
dialog: (to an AIDE)
dialog: Would you call Mr. Kodak and tell him
dialog: the President's--
text: A.J.'s sentence is cut short by the sound of a head-on
dialog: pedestrian collision in the outer office--
speaker_heading: MRS. CHAPIL (O.S.)
dialog: Aaagh!
speaker_heading: KODAK (O.S.)
dialog: Sorry! Sorry, my fault.
dialog: A.J.
dialog: (to the AIDE)
dialog: Never mind.
text: LEON KODAK comes into the oval office. The White House
text: pollster is a likable, if clumsy, numbers whiz. He, along
text: with A.J., LEWIS, and ROBIN, are regarded as the President's
dialog: Starting Team. The people in this room have grown very close
dialog: over the past few years.
speaker_heading: KODAK
dialog: Excuse me. Good morning, Mr. President.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: You all right?
speaker_heading: KODAK
dialog: They keep moving that big ficus plant.
dialog: A.J.
dialog: We're all here, Mr. President.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Okay. First, I wanted to say
dialog: congratulations. Three years ago, we
dialog: were elected to the White House by
dialog: one of the narrowest margins in history,
dialog: and today Kodak tells us 63 percent of
dialog: registered voters think we're doing a
dialog: good job.
speaker_heading: KODAK
dialog: Wait a second. You wanted me to poll
dialog: registered voters?
text: Everyone LAUGHS... even SHEPHERD smiles...
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: But the poll also tells us what we
dialog: already knew: We don't get this
dialog: crime bill of ours through Congress
dialog: and these numbers are gonna be a
dialog: memory. So, starting today, we're
text: shifting it into gear.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Can I tell my morning press gaggle
dialog: that gun control--
dialog: A.J.
dialog: Crime control, Robin. Gun control
dialog: means we're wimps and we're soft on
dialog: crime.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: Hang on, are we not--
dialog: A.J.
dialog: Lewis--
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: Are we not putting back the handgun
dialog: restrictions?!
dialog: A.J.
dialog: We're leaving 'em out.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: Sir, we campaigned on this issue.
dialog: Now, I understand we took it out when
dialog: we were in the low forties, but we
dialog: can push it through now.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: After the elections.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: Sir, we may never have an opportunity
dialog: like this again. Let's take this 63
dialog: percent out for a spin and see what
dialog: it can do.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: We can't take it out for a spin, Lewis.
dialog: We need it to get re-elected. For
dialog: reasons passing understanding, people
dialog: do not relate guns to gun-related crime.
dialog: A.J.
dialog: Robin, you can brief the press this
dialog: afternoon. As of today, the crime
dialog: bill's priority one on the President's
dialog: domestic agenda.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Got it.
dialog: A.J.
dialog: Leon, you're gonna run the war room.
dialog: We're gonna need detailed projections
dialog: for all the target districts by the
dialog: end of the week. And, Leon, don't be
dialog: a nice, sweet guy from Brooklyn. Do
dialog: what the N.R.A. does.
speaker_heading: KODAK
dialog: Scare the shit out of 'em?
dialog: A.J.
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: KODAK
dialog: I can do that.
dialog: A.J.
dialog: Lewis, we want you to be legislative
dialog: liaison on this. You're gonna run
text: the show on the hill.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: Can I just say, to return to the
dialog: subject for one moment, that it might
dialog: be easier to fight a war on drugs if
dialog: we weren't arming drug dealers.
text: SHEPHERD responds a little too quickly -- we see a spark of a
dialog: temper.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Lewis, we've gotta fight the fights
dialog: we can win.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: Yes, sir.
dialog: A.J.
dialog: We want to announce the crime bill at
dialog: the State of the Union, which is 72
dialog: days from today. The last nose count
dialog: put us 18 votes short.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Eighteen votes in 72 days. Thank you,
dialog: everyone. Janie, what's next?
dialog: A.J.
dialog: Thank you, Mr. President.
text: The meeting's over. LEWIS, ROBIN, and KODAK say their "Thank
dialog: you, Mr. President"'s as they exit.

speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Did the President read the letter?
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: The President's pissed as hell,
dialog: Susan. That letter was a stupid move.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: It was aggressive, and we should
dialog: stand by every--
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: This isn't the guy who needed us four
dialog: years ago, Susan. He's incredibly
dialog: popular. He's gonna win re-election
dialog: in a walk, and he could give a shit
dialog: what we stand by! If the President
dialog: passes the most important piece of
dialog: environmental legislation in history,
dialog: and does it despite our negative
dialog: endorsement, our political weight in
dialog: the future will rank somewhere below
dialog: the Save the Spotted Owl Society.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm bringing in some help.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: We don't need another environmental
dialog: expert to confirm what every other
dialog: environmental expert--
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Not an environmental expert, a
dialog: professional political strategist.
dialog: We're playing hardball with Andrew
dialog: Shepherd, and we need a heavy bat.
speaker_heading: SUSAN

dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: ROBIN

speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: You talked to Mr. Linder?
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD

speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I don't know what to say, Dad. I
dialog: guess I'm just not...I don't know.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Luce, take a look at this book. This

dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD

speaker_heading: SYDNEY
speaker_heading: (to the GUARD)

speaker_heading: SUSAN

speaker_heading: GUARD
speaker_heading: (to SUSAN)
dialog: Yeah, I do. Frank Capra, great

speaker_heading: SHEPHERD

speaker_heading: EDUCATION SECRETARY
dialog: I know the proposal only scratches
dialog: the surface, but it's the least we
dialog: can do.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: We're already doing the least we can
dialog: do, but I can't think of anything
dialog: better, so we'll go with this for now.
speaker_heading: (to HUD SECRETARY)
dialog: Jerry, say hello to Linda for me.

speaker_heading: JANIE

speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Ahead?
speaker_heading: JANIE
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: (exited)
dialog: Janie, this is unprecedented. I don't
dialog: know what to do with myself.
speaker_heading: JANIE
dialog: Mr. MacInerney asked me to remind you
dialog: to pop your head in on--
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: The GDC meeting. Right.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. A.J.'s OFFICE - DAY
dialog: A.J.
dialog: Your concerns are not falling on deaf
dialog: ears. The environmental lobby has
dialog: known no greater alley in the White
dialog: House than President Shepherd.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Hardly an impressive distinction, A.J.
dialog: SUSAN is trying to avert the inevitable--
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Sydney, we should leave Mr. MacInerney
dialog: alone now. He's already given us more
dialog: time than--
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Susan, Mr. MacInerney doesn't want
dialog: us to leave, because Mr. MacInerney's
dialog: not yet done what he needs to do today.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Sir, Ms. Wade's been thrown into the
text: deep end of the pool on her first day.
dialog: She hasn't even had a chance to read
dialog: the report of the Quebec Conference.
text: SYDNEY -- whose brain is telling her to slam on the brakes,
text: check her swing, smile and leave the building -- decides,
text: instead, to hit the gas and swing away. The OTHERS are watching
text: this as if they were watching the evolution of a train wreck.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: You're right. I haven't read it. If
dialog: someone had asked me yesterday, I'd
dialog: have told them the Quebec Conference
dialog: was made up of six professional hockey
dialog: teams. But what I do know is that it's
dialog: time for the President to run for
dialog: president again. Leon Kodak is as good
dialog: as it gets when it comes to electoral
dialog: strategy, and I'm certain he's told the
dialog: President exactly what I'd tell him:
dialog: Nail down Michigan and California,
dialog: where they make cars and airplanes --
dialog: and burn plenty of fossil fuel. But if
dialog: I had read these eight hundred pages,
dialog: I would have discovered that it's the
dialog: burning of fossil fuels that's been
dialog: mostly responsible for global warming and
dialog: that the 20 percent reduction recommended
dialog: by the GDC is a necessary first step
dialog: toward arresting the catastrophic greenhouse
dialog: effect that has gone unchecked by this
dialog: administration...
speaker_heading: SUSAN
speaker_heading: (to SYDNEY)
dialog: It's really time to--
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Susan, I promise you, the White House
dialog: Chief of Staff will not let us leave
dialog: here until he's broken the bad news.
dialog: No one in the room really understands what's going on...
dialog: except A.J., who would like to take the time to admire
dialog: SYDNEY but, of course, can't.
dialog: A.J.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'm afraid Sydney's right. Although
dialog: not about Michigan and California.
dialog: The President has asked me to convey
dialog: to you that he's sending his energy
dialog: bill to the floor with a call for a
dialog: reduction of 10 percent.
text: There's an uncomfortable silence in the room...
dialog: A.J.
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: The President is willing to go it
dialog: alone on this, but he's asking for,
dialog: and frankly he's expecting, the full
dialog: support of the GDC.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: The President's expecting our full
dialog: support?
dialog: A.J.
dialog: Yes, he is.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: The President's dreamin', A.J.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Sydney!
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: --the President has critically
dialog: misjudged reality. If he honestly
dialog: thinks that the environmental
dialog: community is going to whistle a
dialog: happy tune while rallying support
dialog: around this pitifully lame mockery of
dialog: environmental leadership just because
dialog: he's a nice guy and he's done better
dialog: than his predecessors, then your boss
dialog: is the Chief Executive of Fantasyland.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Let's take him out back and beat the
dialog: shit out of him.
text: SYDNEY's blown out her speakers because she's turned in the
text: direction of the private office entrance to see, live and in
dialog: person, The President of the United States.
text: She is frozen. Mortified. If she were capable of thought
dialog: process, she would be preying for something heavy to fall on
dialog: her head right now.
dialog: A.J.
dialog: Good morning, Mr. President. How are
dialog: you today?
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Couldn't be better.
dialog: (to the GROUP)
dialog: I apologize for the interruption, but
dialog: A.J. asked me to stop and say hello.
dialog: You wouldn't be Sydney Ellen Wade, by
dialog: any chance, would you?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Mr. President, I'm...don't know what
dialog: to say. I'm speechless.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: All evidence to the contrary.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Mr. President, we haven't met. My
dialog: name is Susan Sloan. I used to work
dialog: with Congressman Myers. I hope this
dialog: episode in no way--
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Sydney?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Yes, sir?
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: You got a second?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Of course.
text: SYDNEY gets up to leave. SHEPHERD escorts her out of A.J.'s
text: office and into the hallway.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: I thought maybe we might have a word
dialog: in private. Someplace a little less
dialog: intimidating.
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Janie?
speaker_heading: JANIE
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
speaker_heading: (to SYDNEY)
dialog: This is my personal assistant, Janie
dialog: Basdin. Janie, would you show Ms.
dialog: Wade into the rec room. I'll be there
dialog: in a second.
text: SHEPHERD enters a doorway off of the hall. SYDNEY continues
dialog: down the hallway.
speaker_heading: JANIE
speaker_heading: (to SYDNEY)
dialog: This way...
text: JANIE leads SYDNEY into...
scene_heading: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
text: ...where SYDNEY just stands uncomfortably, not knowing
text: whether to sit or stand. Waiting. Trying -- the way a jumper
text: on a window ledge tries not to look down -- trying not to
dialog: notice things like the JFK Desk, the Seal of the President of
dialog: the United States, the bust of Lincoln...
dialog: SHEPHERD strides in--
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Sorry to keep you waiting.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Mr. President--
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Is it okay if I call you Sydney?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Of course. Mr. President--
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Have you ever been in the Oval Office?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: I've just been on the regular tour.
dialog: It didn't include...
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: I hear it's pretty good.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Mr. President, what you saw in there
dialog: was nothing more than vanity run amok.
dialog: I was showing off for a colleague who
dialog: doesn't think very much of me. It'd
dialog: be a real injustice for you to hold the
dialog: GDC accountable for my behavior today.
dialog: On top of which, I'm monumentally sorry
dialog: for having insulted you like that.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Are you under the impression that I'm
dialog: mad at you?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Well...
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Sydney, seldom does a day go by that
dialog: I'm not burned in effigy.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Not by a professional political
dialog: operative standing 30 feet from the
dialog: Oval Office.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: No, I'll give you that.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Mr. President--
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Did you know that when the City
dialog: Planners sat down to design
dialog: Washington, D.C., their intention was
dialog: to build a city that would intimidate
dialog: and humble foreign heads of state?
dialog: It's true.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: I didn't know that.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: The White House has the single
dialog: greatest home court advantage in the
dialog: modern world.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Learned that one the hard way.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Sydney, this bill is important to me.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Yes, sir, I'll convey your message.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: But you don't believe me?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: The GDC is asking for 20 percent, sir.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: It's not gonna pass at 20 percent.
text: It's a long shot at 10.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: How do you know that until you put
dialog: the full weight of the White House
dialog: behind--
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Sydney, at 20 percent, we are 34 votes
dialog: shy in the House. It can't be done.
dialog: But I tell you what. I'll make you a
dialog: deal with you. If you can get 24
dialog: votes, I'll get you the last 10.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Twenty-four votes?
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: If you can swing 24 votes by the
dialog: State of the Union, I'll promise you
dialog: full White House support.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Do I have your word on that, sir?
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Absolutely. Listen, are you hungry?
dialog: I skipped breakfast. You wanna have
dialog: some coffee? A donut or something?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Sir, I'm a little intimidated by my
dialog: surroundings, and yes, I've gotten
text: off to a rocky and somewhat stilted
dialog: beginning, but don't let that
dialog: diminish the weight of my message:
dialog: The GDC has been at every president
dialog: for the last decade and a half that
dialog: global warming is a calamity, the
dialog: effects of which will be second only
dialog: to nuclear war. The best scientists
dialog: in the world have given you every
dialog: reason to take the GDC seriously.
dialog: But I'm gonna give you one more. If
dialog: you don't live up to the deal you
dialog: just made, come New Hampshire, we're
dialog: gonna go shopping for a new candidate.
text: SYDNEY heads for the door--
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: You can't do that, Sydney.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: With all due respect, Mr. President,
dialog: who's gonna stop me?
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Well, if you go through that door,
dialog: the United States Secret Service.
dialog: That's my private office.
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: You need to go out that way.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Ah.
text: SYDNEY, with as much dignity as she can muster, leaves the
text: Oval Office. SHEPHERD muses about what has just transpired.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE BILLIARD ROOM - NIGHT
text: SHEPHERD has converted one of the rooms on the second floor

text: stands to the side with his pool cue.
dialog: A.J.
dialog: McSorley, McCluskey and Shane know
dialog: we're making our move on the crime

speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Should I meet with them?
dialog: A.J.
text: Let Lewis take a pass at them first.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD

speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Nice shot, Mr. President? You won't
dialog: call me by my name when we're playing
dialog: pool.
text: A.J. assesses the table.
dialog: A.J.
dialog: I will not do it playing pool, I will

speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: At ease, A.J., and get away from the
text: pocket. 9 in the corner.
text: SHEPHERD makes the shot.
dialog: A.J.
dialog: Leo Solomon phoned. He said he was
dialog: thrilled with the deal you made this
dialog: morning.
text: SHEPHERD lifts his cue for a moment...trying to think it
dialog: there was something he was supposed to tell A.J.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: I forgot to tell you.
dialog: A.J.
dialog: It's a waste of time.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Not our time. GDC makes a big
dialog: push for the votes, and when they
dialog: come up short, we move in with the
dialog: softer bill, to get passed, we're
dialog: everybody's hero. 3 in the side.
dialog: A.J.
dialog: Also, Sydney Wade called.
text: SHEPHERD, a hair too excited by this news, misses by a mile.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Sydney Wade?
dialog: A.J.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: She wanted to apologize one more time

speaker_heading: SHEPHERD

dialog: (beat)
dialog: Sydney Wade?
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: When she called.
dialog: A.J.
dialog: Did she say anything about you?
text: 13 in the corner.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: No, it's just that we had a nice
dialog: couple of minutes together. She
dialog: threatened me and I patronized her
dialog: and we didn't have anything to eat,
dialog: but I thought there was a connection.
text: A.J. is staring at him in disbelief.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: She didn't say anything about me?
dialog: A.J.
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Well, no, but I could pass her a note
dialog: before study hall and--
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Tell me this: Hypothetically, what
dialog: would happen--
dialog: A.J.
dialog: I feel a nightmare coming on. 1 in
dialog: the corner.
text: He misses the shot.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: --if I called Sydney and asked her
dialog: to be my date at the State Dinner
dialog: Thursday night?
dialog: A.J.
dialog: You're not serious.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Don't I sound serious?
dialog: A.J.
dialog: The President can't just go out on
dialog: a date.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Why not? Jefferson did. Wilson did.
dialog: A.J.
dialog: You're not--
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Wilson was widowed during his first
dialog: term. He meets a woman named Edith
dialog: Gault. He dated her, courted her,
dialog: married her, and somewhere in there
dialog: managed to form the League of Nations.
dialog: A.J.
dialog: Mr. President, this is an election
dialog: year. If you're looking for female
dialog: companionship, we can make
dialog: arrangements that'll insure total
dialog: privacy and--
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: I don't want you to get me a girl,
dialog: A.J. What is this, Vegas?
dialog: A.J.
dialog: No, sir, this is the White House.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: And I'm talking about something
dialog: that in no way is at conflict with
dialog: my oath of office. I'm a single
dialog: adult, and I met a woman that I'd
dialog: like to see again socially. How's
dialog: that different from what Wilson did?
dialog: A.J.
dialog: The difference is he didn't have to
dialog: be the president on television.
dialog: You've said it a million times:
dialog: If there were a television set in every
dialog: living room 60 years ago, this country
text: does not elect a man in a wheelchair.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: What are you saying?
dialog: A.J.
dialog: We'll take a hit.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: How big?
dialog: A.J.
dialog: I don't know. Five points. Maybe
dialog: more.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Five points we're standing here
dialog: talking about?!
dialog: A.J.
dialog: It could be more.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD

speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: No. No. I don't want to check a
dialog: polling sample to see if this is

dialog: to stay out an hour past curfew.
dialog: This isn't the business of the
dialog: American people.
dialog: A.J.
dialog: Mr. President, the American people
dialog: have a funny way of deciding on

dialog: It's my fault. I shouldn't have
dialog: called you at home. Should I call
dialog: you at the office tomorrow?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: No, sir, of course not. I mean --
dialog: yes, you can call me anytime you want
dialog: -- this is fine. Right now is fine.
dialog: When I said "of course not," I meat
dialog: that...You know what? The hell with it
dialog: -- I'm moving to another country.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: What did you mean when you said you
dialog: don't have a phone.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: I just moved to Washington over the
dialog: weekend, and my apartment isn't ready
dialog: yet. This is my sister's apartment.
dialog: Come to think of it, how did you get
dialog: this number?
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: (beat)
dialog: How did I get the number. That's a
dialog: reasonable question. I don't know.
dialog: Probably the FBI.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: (trying to pretend
dialog: it's just another
dialog: guy on the phone)
dialog: The FBI. Sure. 'Cause i-if you want
dialog: to find someone and you're the
dialog: president, that's who you would call.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: You know who else is good at that?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: The C.I.A.?
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Well, yeah, but I was thinking of the
dialog: Internal Revenue Service. They have
dialog: computer files that...Well...I should
dialog: stop stalling. As I'm sure you know,
dialog: the French have elected themselves a
dialog: new president, and we're having a formal
dialog: state dinner at the White House, and I
dialog: was wondering -- and you're under no
dialog: obligation at all -- but I thought it
dialog: might be fun... I was wondering if you
dialog: maybe wanted to go...with me, and uh...
dialog: there it is. That's why I was calling.

speaker_heading: SYDNEY

dialog: And I won't let you down, sir.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD

speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: No. Of course. I'm a little...uh...what
dialog: do I do? I, I mean, where do I go?
dialog: Should I meet you? Will you...
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: I'm gonna have a very nice woman
dialog: named Marsha Bridgeport call you.
dialog: She's the White House Social Director,
dialog: and she'll help you with anything you
dialog: want. Now when she calls you and tells
dialog: you her name is Marsha Bridgeport,
dialog: it'll help if you give her the
dialog: benefit of the doubt.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: I'll see you Thursday night.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY

speaker_heading: D'ASTIER

speaker_heading: SYDNEY enters.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Leo, you wanted to see me?
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: So there I was, thinking maybe I
dialog: should give Sydney a call. She's
dialog: new in town, doesn't know many
dialog: people...
text: LEO produces a copy of the morning paper, which has a photo
text: of SHEPHERD and SYDNEY dancing.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Leo--
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Then I picked up the Times--
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: It was crazy. He called me at home.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Nothing. It was innocent. His
dialog: cousin got the flu at the last
dialog: minute.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Did you sleep with him?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Did you sleep--
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: That's none of your business, Leo.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Yeah, it is, Sydney.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: You wanna tell me how my personal
dialog: life in any way--
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Because when it's the President, it's
dialog: not personal. Sydney, I hired your
dialog: reputation. I hired a pit bull, not
dialog: a prom queen.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: That's unfair.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: It's incredibly unfair. But you've
dialog: spent a lot of time over the year
dialog: telling me the trouble with the
dialog: environmental lobby is that we don't
dialog: understand the fundamental truth that
dialog: politics is perception. This is a
dialog: bad time to develop ignorance.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: You're making way too much of this.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Am I? This is your time, Sydney.
dialog: You're sitting at the grown-ups'
dialog: table. You have a chance to get
dialog: everything you want -- run a national
dialog: campaign, be a major player inside
dialog: the party. But this relationship had
dialog: better go all the way, because with
dialog: the leader of the free world there is
dialog: no halfway. Politics is perception,
dialog: and if thing don't work out, the
dialog: amount of time it'll take you to go
dialog: from being a hired gun to a cocktail
dialog: party joke can be clocked with an egg
dialog: timer.
text: There's a quick knock at the door -- Leo's SECRETARY steps in
text: with a strange-looking package.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Leo, there is no relationship. It
dialog: was one night. It's done.
speaker_heading: LEO'S SECRETARY
dialog: Mr. Solomon, this was just delivered
dialog: by White House messenger. It's
dialog: marked "Perishable."
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: The White House has sent me something
dialog: perishable?
speaker_heading: LEO'S SECRETARY
dialog: It's for Ms. Wade.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Here we go...
text: SYDNEY begins unwrapping the package.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Relax, Leo. I'm sure it's just a
dialog: formality.
speaker_heading: LEO'S SECRETARY
dialog: (exited)
dialog: It's from him.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Of course it's from him.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: So he had some staff flunky send
dialog: me a fruit basket.
speaker_heading: LEO'S SECRETARY
dialog: He wrote the note himself.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: I'm sure he didn't take the time to--
speaker_heading: LEO'S SECRETARY
dialog: The messenger said he was waiting in
dialog: the Oval Office for ten minutes while
dialog: the President wrote the card.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Okay, listen, so he--
speaker_heading: (to LEO'S SECRETARY)
dialog: --it took him ten minutes to write a
dialog: card?!
speaker_heading: LEO'S SECRETARY
dialog: Apparently he went through several
dialog: drafts.
text: SYDNEY can't stifle her laugh -- she sees what the gift is.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: What is it...what is it?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: A ham.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: (beat)
dialog: A ham?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: He sent me a Virginia ham.
speaker_heading: LEO'S SECRETARY
dialog: Dig it, Ms. Wade. You're the
dialog: President's girlfriend.

speaker_heading: SHEPHERD

speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: I got the ham, yes. Thank you very

speaker_heading: SHEPHERD

speaker_heading: SHEPHERD

speaker_heading: SHEPHERD

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Which? Robbins or Stackhouse?
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Either one. I have to be in and out.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Sir, Governor Stackhouse said he just
dialog: needed 10 minutes. I think he wants

speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Stackhouse wants to talk about

speaker_heading: JEFF

speaker_heading: SHEPHERD

speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Yes. Not many. A few. One. I have

speaker_heading: SHEPHERD

speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: You like to make jokes about this,

speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: I am not mocking you, honest. I'm

speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: This isn't a state of mind. You are

dialog: President.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD

speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Well, I have no intention of pursuing

dialog: that leaves everything out, and

speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: If I were on your staff, I would tell

speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Let's clear up a couple of things.
dialog: Number 1: I seldom prance.
dialog: Number 2: I have no intention of

speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: What the hell does it matter how
dialog: much money I--
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: You would raise your voice to the

speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: I'm only thinking about the health

dialog: (of course she is)
dialog: That's not the issue--
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Well, I tell you what. Let's make
dialog: it the issue. Let's try something
dialog: new, 'cause I know that most couples,

speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: You're not most people.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: You know what your problem is?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: What's my problem?
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Sex and nervousness.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Sex and nervousness is my problem.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Yes. Last night when we were
dialog: looking at the different place
dialog: settings in the dish room, I
dialog: realized that those place settings
dialog: were provided by the First Ladies.
dialog: And I'll bet none of those First
dialog: Ladies were nervous about having
dialog: sex with their President husbands.
dialog: And you know why?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: No, but I'm sure you'll explain it
dialog: to me.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: I will. Because they weren't
dialog: presidents when they met them. Not
dialog: the case here.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Ahhhhhh.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: You see what I'm getting at?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Yes. May I use your bathroom for a

speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Sure. It's right through there.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: I want to freshen up.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: As you pass through, you'll see a

dialog: you feel comfortable, hang up your

speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: (speaking up)
dialog: Okay. You're attracted to me, but
dialog: the idea of physical intimacy is
dialog: uncomfortable because you only know
dialog: me as the President. It's not always
dialog: gonna be that way, and the reason I
dialog: know that is because there was a
dialog: moment last night when you were with
dialog: me and not the President, and I know
dialog: what a big step that was for you.
dialog: So, Sydney, I'm in no rush. Here's
dialog: my plan: We're gonna slow down.
dialog: When you're comfortable, that's
dialog: when it'll happen.

speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Are you nervous?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Good. My nervousness exists on
dialog: several levels. Number 1 -- and
dialog: this is in no particular order --
dialog: I haven't done this in a pretty
dialog: long time. Number 2: Any expectations
dialog: you might have, due to the fact that
dialog: I'm, you know...
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: The most powerful man in the world?
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Exactly, thank you. Just so you
dialog: remember that's a political
dialog: distinction that comes with the

dialog: to question your family values?

dialog: Oh yes, he does, A.J. I'm a citizen,
dialog: this is my president, and in this
dialog: country it is not only permissible to
dialog: question our leaders, it is our

dialog: that, Mr. President, because you have

dialog: And in the absence of genuine
dialog: leadership, they will listen to
dialog: anyone who steps up to the

dialog: This is oatmeal.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: We never have oatmeal.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: It's good for you.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I'm from Wisconsin. I need food.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: You're not from Wisconsin. I'm from
dialog: Wisconsin. You've lived in
dialog: Washington your whole life.
text: He glances toward the T.V. screen. ROBIN's standing up there
dialog: doing what she's been told: "No comment...No, this President
dialog: is not participating in character debates..." He mutes the
dialog: volume.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: How are you doing in your
dialog: Constitutional debates?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: We're done.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: You're done?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: We ratified it last week.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Oh...well...that's good. Why didn't
dialog: you tell me?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: It's not a big deal, Dad.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Okay, I give up. I don't care why
dialog: you're not happy in social studies.
dialog: I care about why you're not talking
dialog: to me about why you're not happy in
dialog: social studies.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Dad, I'm perfectly--
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: You're not perfectly happy. You
dialog: don't think I know when something's
dialog: bothering you?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Damnit, Dad!
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: You know--
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Talk to me.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Look--
text: LUCY winds herself up. It would appear she's about to burst.
dialog: She's about to say the hardest thing she's ever had to say in
dialog: her life--
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: --sometimes when you talk, you say
dialog: things I disagree with.
text: SHEPHERD is stunned and totally confused...
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Almost every time I talk, I say
dialog: things you disagree with.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I mean politically.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Politically?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: (pause)
dialog: What do you mean?
text: It just starts spilling out in a stream--
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Yes. Okay. Yes. Sometimes, I mean,
dialog: I'm not sure. You know a lot more
dialog: than I do -- but still, I have these
dialog: feelings, and I don't think they're
dialog: wrong. Like, okay, for instance, I'm
dialog: not so sure it's all right to burn a
dialog: flag. I mean, it really bothers a lot
dialog: of people, and I don't know why you
dialog: think it's okay. I hear Senator
dialog: Rumson talk, and some of the things
dialog: he says sounds right to me, and I
dialog: think, "God, am I like Bob Rumson?!
dialog: I mean, Dad thinks he's a jerk. Dad
dialog: hates this guy!
dialog: Why am I agreeing with him" And then
dialog: I think, "Well, maybe I'm not really
dialog: like Bob Rumson, but maybe I'm not
dialog: like Dad either." But the point is
dialog: I'm the President's kid, and people
dialog: pay attention to what I say, and if
dialog: I say something different from what
dialog: you say, it'll be embarrassing for
dialog: you. So I can't just get up in social
dialog: studies class and say whatever I want.
dialog: SHEPHERD is silent...totally blown away...he had absolutely
dialog: no idea...
text: He stands up slowly and moves toward her...LUCY doesn't know
dialog: what's coming...
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Stand up please.
text: LUCY gets up slowly...
dialog: She's never seen her father like this...
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I want you to pay very close
dialog: attention to what happens now.
text: SHEPHERD knees down, cups her daughter's face in his hands,
text: and gently kisses her forehead. He pulls her to him and
text: holds her in a tight embrace...
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: In your lifetime, you will never
dialog: embarrass me. It could never happen.
dialog: You're not the President's daughter,
dialog: Lucy, you're mine.
dialog: And no one's gonna vote me out of
dialog: that job. You're my daughter, and
text: everything else is a distant second.
dialog: (more)
dialog: School is for you, Lucy. You say
dialog: what you want. The only thing you
dialog: have to do to make me happy is
text: come home at the end of the day.
text: LUCY squeezes her dad tight...they hold the embrace for a
dialog: long moment.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: One more thing. I don't dislike
dialog: Senator Rumson because of his
dialog: political views. And even if you
dialog: voted for everything he would vote
dialog: for, that wouldn't make you like him.
dialog: There's a fundamental difference
dialog: between you and the Bob Rumsons of
dialog: the world.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: The difference is that he says he
dialog: loves America. Saying you love
dialog: America is easy. What takes
dialog: character -- and this is what you
dialog: have--
text: SHEPHERD trails off, realizing he's about to quote Sydney...
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What takes character is loving
dialog: Americans.
dialog: (beat)
text: And now it's as if SHEPHERD is waking himself up from the
dialog: longest trip of his life...
text: ...he looks over at the T.V. monitor..."No comment"...
dialog: "No, I don't know how many other ways I can say it. The
dialog: White House isn't getting involved in..."
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Luce, I gotta go.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Dad, is everything all right?
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Everything's fine. I'm just a little
dialog: late for work.
text: He heads for the door, shouting out as he goes--
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Somebody get my daughter some food!
dialog: The girl's from Wisconsin, for cryin'
dialog: out loud!
dialog: And he's gone as we...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE PRESS BRIEFING ROOM - EARLY MORNING
text: ROBIN is on her last drops of energy and patience.
speaker_heading: REPORTER #4
dialog: Robin, will the President ever
dialog: respond to Senator Rumson's
dialog: question about being a member of
dialog: the American Civil Liberties Union?
text: But instead of hands going up, the PRESS CORPS suddenly
text: stands. ROBIN turns to see SHEPHERD stride in and step up to
dialog: the podium.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Yes, he will. 'Morning.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Good morning, Mr. President.
text: SHEPHERD takes the podium. There's a palpable BUZZ in the
text: room as video operators adjust their equipment, etc. People
text: starts to stand.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: That's all right, you can keep your
dialog: seats. For the last couple of
dialog: months, Senator Rumson has suggested
dialog: that being president of this country
dialog: was, to a certain extent, about
dialog: character...
speaker_heading: ANGLE - ROBIN
text: who's picked up the receiver from a wall phone and punches in
dialog: four numbers.
text: She turns in to the wall to shield her conversation from the
dialog: rest of the room.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Lewis...call A.J. and come on down
dialog: here...I don't know, but
dialog: something's happening.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: ...and although I have not been
dialog: willing to engage in his attacks on
dialog: me, I've been here three years and
dialog: three days, and I can tell you
dialog: without hesitation: Being President
dialog: of this country is entirely about
dialog: character.
text: LEWIS enters with A.J. and KODAK.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: For the record: Yes, I am a card-
dialog: carrying member of the A.C.L.U. But
dialog: the more important question is why
dialog: aren't you, Bob? This is an
dialog: organization whose sole purpose is to
dialog: defend the Bill of Rights, so it
text: naturally begs the questions.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Why would a senator, his party's most
dialog: powerful spokesman and a candidate
dialog: for president, choose to reject
dialog: upholding the Constitution? If you
dialog: can answer that question, then,
dialog: folks, you're smarter than I am,
dialog: because I didn't understand it until
dialog: a couple of minutes ago. Everybody
dialog: knows American isn't easy. America is
dialog: advanced citizenship.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You gotta want it bad, 'cause it's
dialog: gonna put up a fight. It's gonna
dialog: say, "You want free speech? Let's
dialog: see you acknowledge a man whose words
dialog: make your blood boil, who's standing
dialog: center stage and advocating, at the
dialog: top of his lungs, that which you
dialog: would spend a lifetime opposing at the
dialog: top of yours. You want to claim
dialog: this land as the land of the free,
dialog: then the symbol of your country can't
dialog: just be a flag; the symbol also has
dialog: to be one of its citizens exercising
dialog: his right to burn that flag in
dialog: protest." Show me that, defend that,
dialog: celebrate that in your classrooms.
dialog: Then you can stand up and sing about
dialog: the land of the free. I've known Bob
dialog: Rumson for years. I've been operating
dialog: under the assumption that the reason
dialog: Bob devotes so much time and energy to
dialog: shouting at the rain was that he simply
dialog: didn't get it. Well, I was wrong.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Bob's problem isn't that he doesn't
dialog: get it. Bob's problem is that he
dialog: can't sell it. Nobody has ever won
dialog: an election by talking about what I
dialog: was just talking about.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: This is a country made up of people
dialog: with hard jobs that they're terrified
dialog: of losing. The roots of freedom are
dialog: of little or no interest to them at
dialog: the moment. We are a nation afraid
dialog: to go out at night. We're a society
dialog: that has assigned low priority to
dialog: education and has looked the other
dialog: way while our public schools have
dialog: been decimated. We have serious
dialog: problems to solve, and we need
dialog: serious men to solve them. And
dialog: whatever your particular problem is,
dialog: friend, I promise you, Bob Rumson is
dialog: not the least bit interested in
dialog: solving it. He is interested in two
dialog: things and two things only: Making
dialog: you afraid of it and telling you
dialog: who's to blame for it. That, ladies
dialog: and gentlemen, is how you win
dialog: elections. You gather a group of
dialog: middle-aged, middle-class, middle-
dialog: income voters who remember with
dialog: longing an easier time, and you talk
dialog: to them about family and American
dialog: values and personal character. Then
dialog: you have an old photo of the
dialog: President's girlfriend. You scream
dialog: about patriotism and you tell them
dialog: she's to blame for their lot in life,
dialog: you go on television and you call her
dialog: a whore. Sydney Ellen Wade has done
dialog: nothing to you, Bob. She has done
dialog: nothing but put herself through law
dialog: school, prosecute criminals for five
dialog: years, represent the interests of
dialog: public school teachers for two years,
dialog: and lobby for the safety of our
dialog: natural resources.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You want a character debate? Fine,
dialog: but you better stick with me, 'cause
dialog: Sydney Ellen Wade is way out of your
dialog: league. I've loved two women in my
dialog: life. I lost one to cancer, and I
dialog: lost the other 'cause I was so busy
dialog: keeping my job I forgot to do my job.
dialog: Well that ends right now.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Tomorrow morning the White House is
dialog: sending a bill to Congress for its
dialog: consideration. It's White House
dialog: Resolution 455, an energy bill
dialog: requiring a 20 percent reduction of the
dialog: emission of fossil fuels over the
dialog: next ten years. It is by far the
dialog: most aggressive stride ever taken in
dialog: the fight to reverse the effects of
dialog: global warming. The other piece of
dialog: legislation is the crime bill. As of
dialog: today it no longer exists. I'm
dialog: throwing it out. I'm throwing it out
dialog: and writing a law that makes sense.
dialog: You cannot address crime prevention
dialog: without getting rid of assault
text: weapons and handguns.
dialog: I consider them a threat to national
dialog: security, and I will go door to door
dialog: if I have to, but I'm gonna convince
dialog: Americans that I'm right, and I'm
dialog: gonna get the guns. We've got
dialog: serous problems, and we need serious
dialog: men, and if you want to talk about
dialog: character, Bob, you'd better come at
dialog: me with more than a burning flag and
dialog: a membership card. If you want to
dialog: talk about character and American
dialog: values, fine. Just tell me where and
dialog: when, and I'll show up. This is a
dialog: time for serious men, Bob, and your
dialog: fifteen minutes are up. My name's
dialog: Andrew Shepherd, and I am the
dialog: President.
text: SHEPHERD exits the press room, leaving a stunned room in his
dialog: wake.
text: The MURMURS begin from the PRESS CORPS. They're talking
dialog: among themselves, confirming that they just saw what they
text: just saw. ROBIN steps to the podium.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Any questions?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - WEST WING - DAY
text: A.J. and LEWIS are following after the President.
dialog: A.J.
dialog: Well, you don't see that every day
dialog: of the week.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: He's got the whole White House Press
dialog: Corps asking each other how to spell
dialog: "erudite."
dialog: A.J.
dialog: Lewis, call the printer.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: I know. Gotta rewrite the State of
dialog: the Union.
dialog: A.J.
dialog: Every word, Lewis. It's a whole new
dialog: ball game. You've got 35 minutes.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: Oh, good. I thought I was gonna be rushed.

scene_heading: INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY

speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: I don't want the limo. I don't want
dialog: an escort.
text: A.J. enters.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I want a plain, ordinary, non-
dialog: bullet-proof automobile. Someone
dialog: around here must have a Chevy I
dialog: can borrow. Well, find one and
dialog: meet me outside the West Wing
dialog: entrance in five minutes.
dialog: A.J.
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: I'm going to her house. I'm gonna
dialog: stand at her front door till she
dialog: lets me in. And I'm not leaving till
dialog: I get her back.
dialog: A.J.
dialog: How're you gonna do that?
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: I haven't worked that out yet. But
dialog: I'm sure groveling will be involved.
dialog: A.J.
dialog: You're just gonna drive over?
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: I'm the Commander-in-Chief of the
dialog: most powerful army in the world.
dialog: You don't think I can drive ten blocks?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Just stay away from DuPont Circle.
dialog: I hear it's murder this time of day.
text: SHEPHERD doesn't need to turn around to know who's standing
text: in the doorway, but of course he does anyway.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Hi, A.J.
dialog: A.J.
dialog: It's nice to see you, Ms. Wade. If
dialog: anybody needs me, I'll be in the
dialog: Roosevelt Room, giving Lewis oxygen.
text: A.J. exits.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: I heard your speech. I was in my
dialog: car, and it just kind of steered
dialog: its way over here.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: I'm glad.
text: SYDNEY and SHEPHERD just gaze at each other for a moment and
text: smile. SYDNEY starts toward him.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Sydney, I didn't decide to send
dialog: 455 to the floor to get you back.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: I didn't come back 'cause you decided
dialog: to send 455 to the floor.
dialog: They move to kiss. It doesn't last very long because...
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: (entering)
dialog: Mr. President, I thought you might
dialog: want to look at this. I moved Social
dialog: Security up front. Hello, Sydney.
speaker_heading: JANIE enters--
speaker_heading: JANIE
dialog: Mr. President, Leventhal at
dialog: Treasury wants two minutes. Hello,
dialog: Sydney.
dialog: MRS. CHAPIL enters--
speaker_heading: MRS. CHAPIL
dialog: Mr. President -- Excuse me, Miss
dialog: Wade -- Miss McCall is on her way
dialog: over.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
speaker_heading: (to SYDNEY)

speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Yes, you do.

speaker_heading: ANCHOR (V.O.)
dialog: We're only a moment or two away from
dialog: the arrival of President Shepherd and
dialog: his State of the Union address.
dialog: Lloyd, you've served on the staffs of
dialog: several past administrations, what
dialog: kind of last-minute activity is the
dialog: President engaged in right now?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. A VIP ROOM - NIGHT
text: It's off the main corridor, and it's being used as a green
text: room for SHEPHERD and his group -- LEWIS, KODAK, A.J., JANIE,
text: and various AIDES and STAFFERS. People are buzzing around in
text: a last-minute flurry. SHEPHERD is fumbling with his cuff
dialog: links.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: I'm having a cuff links crisis.
text: LUCY takes his sleeves.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: (continuing; to LUCY)
dialog: I think they've locked.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Hold still.
speaker_heading: ROBIN steps in.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Mr. President, they're waiting for
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: All done.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Lewis.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: Sir.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Things have been a little rough
dialog: between us lately.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: I know sir, I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Don't stop what you're doing.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: That's kind of you, sir, but I
dialog: realize I've been a little
dialog: insensitive about some personal...
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: No, you were right. Two hundred and
dialog: sixty-four million people don't give
dialog: a damn about my life.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: Just so you know I've never been one
dialog: of them, Mr. President.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: This way, people. Let's go.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
speaker_heading: (to LEWIS)
dialog: See you after.
text: The PEOPLE in the room start to gather their things and exit,
dialog: ROBIN handling any and all last-minute "Mr. President"'s as
text: she herds people out the door.
text: LUCY walks past SHEPHERD. She holds SHEPHERD's old tattered
text: textbook and has it opened to a specific page...
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Whatcha got there, Luce?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Article 2, Section 3, of the U.S.
dialog: Constitution. Executive Powers.
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "He shall, from time to time, give to
dialog: the Congress information of the State
dialog: of the Union, and recommend to their

dialog: A.J.
dialog: Sounds right up your alley.
text: SHEPHERD looks at his old friend and extends his hand for a

text: pulls him into a strong embrace.
text: A.J. whispers a shout into SHEPHERD's ear--
dialog: A.J.
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Give 'em hell, Andy.
text: A.J. pulls away, leaving SHEPHERD to enjoy the moment without

dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You've got 30 seconds, Mr. President.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: (to LUCY)
dialog: I'll see you afterward. I want a
dialog: critique.
text: The room clears out...revealing SYDNEY, dressed like the
text: First Lady she's soon to be, sitting against the window sill.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: There's been something I've been
dialog: trying to give you since our first
dialog: date. I tried a bunch of times, but

dialog: Anyay...
text: SHEPHERD has picked his black canvas gym bag with the gold
dialog: Presidential seal.

speaker_heading: SHEPHERD

dialog: These are for you.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY

speaker_heading: SHEPHERD

scene_heading: SECRET SERVICE, CAPITOL SECURITY, WHITE HOUSE STAFF, and,

text: SYDNEY is still clutching her flowers as they near the double
dialog: doors to the House Chamber--
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: How'd you finally do it?
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: (raising his voice
dialog: above the cheering)
dialog: Do what?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Manage to give a woman flowers and
dialog: be President at the same time.
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Well...it turns out I've got a rose
dialog: garden.
text: SYDNEY is stopped in her tracks as--
dialog: --the doors to the Chamber fly open--
speaker_heading: DOORKEEPER
dialog: Mr. Speaker!!!...THE PRESIDENT OF THE
dialog: UNITED STATES!!!
text: The CHAMBER leaps to its feet in a thunderous ovation,
text: shouts of "Bravo!" from the gallery...
text: At the back, LEWIS and ROBIN and KODAK are trying to maintain
dialog: their professional cool, but it's a moment impossible not to
text: get caught up in...SYDNEY is clutching her flowers with both
