dialog: As you know, my husband Bob is a visionary

dialog: than saw Celine Dion’s farewell tour in Las

speaker_heading: LAURA (V.O., CONT’D)
dialog: And yes, Bob took home the blue ribbon

dialog: 20 years.
text: DA VINCI’S LAST SUPPER - From afar, the sculpture looks
text: ridiculous. But as we get closer, we see the exquisite
text: detail of the CHALICE, the ROBES that flow right before our

speaker_heading: LAURA (V.O. CONT’D)

text: And then she begins carving. Slow at first. Then faster.
text: Then faster. Then faster (we just see her face.)
text: CLOSE ON: her carved stick of butter. It’s an exact,
text: perfect replica of the CHALICE from Bob’s piece. It’s
dialog: brilliant.
speaker_heading: LATER —
text: Bob is surrounded by adoring women. He’s like a chubby,
text: diabetic Zac Efron. Laura leers at them.
speaker_heading: LAURA (V.O.)
dialog: Being the wife of a celebrity, I was
dialog: used to the way other women could get

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Quiet one, aren’t ya’?

text: Laura leers at Destiny, arms folded.
speaker_heading: LAURA (V.O., CONT'D)
dialog: (forced)
dialog: Still, I wish her the best.

speaker_heading: NED EATON
dialog: - and carving butter is not easy. I mean,
dialog: some of these jokesters come in here with

speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I call it My Scarlet Letter and it’s
text: inspired by a movie starring Demi Moore.
dialog: Thank you and God bless you.
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Butter saves!

text: Brooke looks over to Bob and mouths the words: 600 dollars.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Well thank you, Brooke. That was
dialog: very inspirational. Destiny?
text: Now Destiny takes the podium and pulls out a few rumpled
text: note cards. She’s really shy and nervous, but the crowd
text: sees that’s she’s only 12 and lets out a big adorable sigh.

text: GUSHES. Laura rolls her eyes.
speaker_heading: DESTINY
dialog: (poised)
dialog: My name is Destiny. My last name
dialog: is either Washington or Wilson. The
dialog: reason I’m not sure is because the
dialog: state of Iowa is not sure. You see,
dialog: I am, and have been, a foster child.
dialog: I have been shuttled from home to
dialog: to home. And while some of my experiences
dialog: have been negative, most have been
dialog: overwhelmingly positive. I have seen the
dialog: great people of Iowa, from Des Moines to
dialog: Winnemucca County and I know this to be
dialog: true: Iowans are the greatest people
dialog: ever to walk the face of the Earth!
text: CHEERS. Destiny puts down her note cards. She’s

speaker_heading: DESTINY (CONT'D)
dialog: So why then, can a 12-year-old black
dialog: girl with no family history, no money
dialog: and no connections, stand before you and
dialog: dare to think she can win this competition?
dialog: (BEAT, leaning forward, dramatic)
dialog: Because I dare to dream.
dialog: is RAPT.
speaker_heading: DESTINY (CONT’D)
dialog: (increasingly more animated)
dialog: It is that same daring that drove the
text: Pilgrims across the vast, dark oceans to
dialog: America. Why did they risk it?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Because they dared to dream.
dialog: Seriously, people are hanging off every word. Some people

dialog: (BEAT, the crowd repeats with her!)
dialog: Because he dared to dream.

speaker_heading: DESTINY (CONT'D)
dialog: (pointing to her sculpture)
dialog: And it was the gumption of a poor

speaker_heading: NANCY

text: Laura is caught off guard, but stumbles up to the milk

speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: (nervous and horrible)
dialog: Family. When I think about butter I think
dialog: of family. Why? Because like the thread
text: of a grandmother’s quilt, butter is the
text: centerpiece of the family dinner and family
dialog: in turn, is the thread that holds our great
dialog: country together. Without butter, there is
dialog: no family, and without family, there is

text: The judges look to each other then give her the go-ahead.
speaker_heading: LAURA (CONT'D)
dialog: you know, this really hard.
text: And then she begins to cry. We don't quite know if its
dialog: heartfelt cry or an ‘I’m going to lose’ cry-
speaker_heading: LAURA (CONT’D)
dialog: Before you cast what may be the most
dialog: important vote of your lifetime, I’d like
dialog: to remind you what this contest is about.
dialog: It is about ‘excellence in butter.’ And
dialog: from what I’ve seen in recent days, my
dialog: faith in this panel’s commitment to
dialog: excellence has been challenged. Unless
dialog: I’m mistaken some people seem to think
dialog: this competition is about who is the most
dialog: disadvantaged, who’s had the hardest life.
dialog: Who’s had to overcome the most to get here.
text: The judges and the crowd seem skeptical.
speaker_heading: LAURA (CONT’D))
dialog: You know, this is exactly why I stopped
dialog: watching my American Idol. Every year
dialog: the best singer gets up there and every

speaker_heading: LAURA (CONT‘D)
dialog: And I am sorry that I didn’t spend 15
dialog: years of my life sucking every cock that
text: flew in front of my face, only to throw on

text: Laura looks to Brooke. The crowd is stunned.
speaker_heading: LAURA (CONT’D)
dialog: And I’m sorry my ancestors weren’t running

dialog: Amazing Grace.
text: Laura looks to Destiny.
speaker_heading: LAURA (CONT'D)
dialog: And I guess I’m most sorry I spent all my
dialog: life working hard and doing the right thing.
dialog: Because that’s what I thought this competition
dialog: was about. And I just hope when you vote,
dialog: you remember that.
text: Laura steps down. And guess what? She’s got them back.
text: A few people in the crowd are not having it, but for the

speaker_heading: NANCY

dialog: not entirely your own.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: And you defended me, right?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Well, I — I’m impartial —
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: I assume they showed you proof? Where
dialog: is it? I want to see it.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Well, it was just a sense that some
dialog: of them-
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: It was that Miss Dairy heifer, wasn’t
dialog: it? Or that Helen. You know she has a
dialog: history of lying, don’t you?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: No, I wasn’t aware of that.
text: Laura moves closer to Nancy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: The work is mine. And unless they
dialog: can prove otherwise, I suggest you
dialog: march right back in there and tell

scene_heading: INT. MOOSE LODGE — SAME
text: Two coolers face each other. Each with identical slabs of
dialog: butter. They’re roped off which is a good thing because the
text: room is filled with ONLOOKERS.
text: Destiny, holding the KNIFE SET Brooke bestowed upon her,
text: faces Laura. Laura tries to psych her out with one of her

text: Nancy stands on a crate between then and BLOWS A WHISTLE:
text: It’s on.
scene_heading: DESTINY'S COOLER —

speaker_heading: CROWD —

speaker_heading: LATER —
text: Even more people have come to check out the competition.
scene_heading: DESTINY’S COOLER —
text: Her piece is moving along. We can make out a figure.. that’s
dialog: about it.
speaker_heading: LAURA’S COOLER —
text: Laura is moving along too. It kind of looks like a car.
text: Maybe a convertible.

text: Destiny, ever polite, smiles.
speaker_heading: LAURA'S COOLER —
text: Laura makes a wrong cut. A hunk of butter falls to the

text: She then spots Bob outside the cooler and gives him the
dialog: evil eye: this is all your fault.
speaker_heading: MAIN ROOM —
text: We can now see that more people are crowded around

text: Standing room only. The kids make their way past the beer

text: Despite the crowd outside, Destiny is all focus.

dialog: Laura’s isn’t that bad. It’s a little clunky, but we can

scene_heading: DESTINY’S FINAL SCULPTURE -
text: Is simple but lovely. Like Davinci’s Madonna with Child
text: painting, her piece is a_ new mother cradling her baby.
text: Despite the simple image, the detail is intense. The robes,
text: the eyes, the child’s tiny fingers — it’s like nothing the
dialog: crowd has ever seen.
speaker_heading: MAIN HALL —
text: The crowd, almost simultaneously, whips their head over to
scene_heading: LAURA’S FINAL SCULPTURE —
text: Jackie 0. crawling to the back of the presidential limo,

text: Zapruder Film) It’s well done, but completely tasteless.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAIN HALL —

speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: May I have your attention, please?

text: Orval (the head judge) steps up onto the milk crate.
speaker_heading: ORVAL
