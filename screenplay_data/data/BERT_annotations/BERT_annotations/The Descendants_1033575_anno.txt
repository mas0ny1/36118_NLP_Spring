dialog: My missionary ancestors came to the

dialog: on clothes, work hard, believe in
dialog: Christ, and stop surfing and hula
dialog: dancing. They made business deals
dialog: along the way -- buying an island, or
text: marrying a princess and inheriting her
dialog: land. Now their descendants wear
text: bikinis and running shorts, play beach
dialog: volleyball and surf, and take up hula

speaker_heading: MATT (V.O.)

dialog: waves. Are they nuts? How can they
dialog: possibly think our families are less

speaker_heading: MATT (V.O.) (CONT'D)

dialog: She was originally supposed to marry

speaker_heading: ALEXANDRA

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: ALEXANDRA

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: ALEXANDRA

speaker_heading: RALPH

speaker_heading: ALEXANDRA

speaker_heading: SCOTTIE
dialog: What do you love about her?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I love... I don't know. The way we are
dialog: with each other, most of the time,

dialog: of feeling joy than anyone I've ever
dialog: known. I just like being with her,

text: Like right beneath her. She got down
text: on her stomach and started paddling
dialog: like crazy, and this big fin kept
text: following her. She even paddled up
text: onto the nearest rocks instead of all
dialog: the way to shore. Got cuts all over
dialog: her legs and hands. Only time I ever
dialog: saw your mother scared, and she was
text: really scared. She even threw up.
text: Crying and shaking. I had to hold her
dialog: for a long time. She really thought
dialog: she was going to die. Of course she
dialog: hid all that from the Mitchells, turned
dialog: it into a funny "Me-versus-a-shark"
dialog: story. I told her...

dialog: That's what I'm saying. That's Don's

dialog: That's right. It's an octopus. Such a
text: funny creature with its eight legs.
dialog: But did you know octopi are actually
dialog: extremely intelligent, like dogs and
dialog: cats? They have unique personalities,
dialog: and just like us they have a lot of
dialog: defense mechanisms. I'm sure you know
text: about the ink sac. She uses ink to
dialog: confuse her predators. She can
text: camouflage herself. She can emit
dialog: poison, and some can mimic more
dialog: dangerous creatures, like the eel. I
dialog: keep her to remind me of our defense
dialog: mechanisms -- our ink, our camouflage,
dialog: our poison, all the things we use to
dialog: keep away hurt. The reason Dr.
dialog: Johnston invited me here today is to
dialog: meet you, Scottie. I've heard a lot
dialog: about you.

speaker_heading: DR. HERMAN

dialog: you and tell you that if you ever want

speaker_heading: DR. JOHNSTON
dialog: Yes. We worked really hard with her,

dialog: she's in what we call an irreversible
dialog: coma. Do you know what that means?
speaker_heading: SCOTTIE
dialog: It means she doesn't have a brain
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: DR. JOHNSTON
dialog: Not exactly, but... yes, that's the
dialog: general idea. So we're doing exactly
dialog: what she wanted us to do if that ever

speaker_heading: ALEXANDRA
