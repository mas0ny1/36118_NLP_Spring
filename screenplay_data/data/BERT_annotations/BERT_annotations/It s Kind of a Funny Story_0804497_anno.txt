dialog: It’s Kind of a Funny Story
text: Written for the screen by
dialog: Ryan Fleck & Anna Boden
dialog: Based on the novel by
dialog: Ned Vizzini
scene_heading: EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT
text: CRAIG GILNER (16, handsome, but awkward) glides on his bike
text: toward the Brooklyn Bridge. He is the only one on the
text: streets. A rhythmic beating heart is the only sound we hear.
scene_heading: BADOOM BADOOM BADOOM
text: The heartbeat increases in pace as Craig nears the bridge.
scene_heading: EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE PEDESTRIAN PATH
text: We float behind Craig as he approaches the bridge’s first
text: tower. Craig is still the only person there.
scene_heading: BADOOM BADOOM BADOOM
text: He arrives at the tower, steps off his bike, and looks out
text: over the East River.
scene_heading: BADOOM BADOOM BADOOM
text: He climbs up onto a steel girder. Walks to the edge, over
text: the speeding traffic below, then out over the water.
scene_heading: BADOOMBADOOMBADOOMBADOOM
text: SILENCE...
speaker_heading: LYNN (0.S.)
dialog: Craig!?
text: Craig looks behind him to find his mother (LYNN, early 40s),
text: father (GEORGE, mid 40s), and little sister (ALYSSA, 8) all
text: standing by his bike.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: What were you planning to do with your
dialog: bike, honey?!
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I don’t care about my bike! I’m
dialog: killing myself!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: But we spent a lot of money on that
dialog: bike, Sport! We only ask that you take
dialog: care of it!
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Think of me, Craig! I might want that
dialog: bike when I grow up!
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I’m sorry, I just didn’t think--
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: That’s right, honey, you weren’t
dialog: thinking of us when you decided to do
dialog: this, were you?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Pretty selfish, I'd say. Have you
dialog: thought about how this might affect
dialog: your sister?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I'll be traumatized for life.
text: Craig stares at his family for a beat.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I’m sorry, I--
text: A CAR HORN BLARES and Craig flinches, blinded by the oncoming
text: headlights. He loses his footing on the thin metal plank.
text: He SLIPS AND FALLS as his family watches in horror.
text: CRAIG'S POV: hurling down toward the water below. At the
text: moment before impact, the frame FREEZES a few feet above the
dialog: water--
speaker_heading: CRAIG (V.0.)
dialog: This is the moment where I usually wake
text: up in a sweaty panic.
text: ANGLE ON CRAIG’S anguished face frozen in time.
speaker_heading: CRAIG (V.0.)
dialog: But for some reason... this time was
dialog: different--
text: The POV frame resumes action and Craig plunges into the
dialog: water.
text: TITLE: “IT’S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY”
scene_heading: EXT. ARGENON HOSPITAL - DAWN
text: Craig locks his bike to a rack in front of an illuminated
text: emergency room sign. He turns towards the hospital.
text: Overhead the sky is illuminated by a pre-dawn glow.
scene_heading: SUPER: “SUNDAY: DAY 1”
scene_heading: INT. EMERGENCY ROOM
text: Craig wanders into the bright, fluorescent-lit room,
text: approaches the NURSE at the registration desk.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Hi... I want to kill myself.
text: Unphased, the nurse hands him a clipboard.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Fill this out, please.
scene_heading: INT. EMERGENCY ROOM WAITING AREA - NOT MUCH LATER
text: Craig waits near an ear-infected KID, when his attention
text: shifts to the sliding doors. A man, dressed in blue doctor’s
text: scrubs, saunters in with a cup of coffee, takes a seat
text: (unusually close) next to Craig. He is BOBBY (late 30s, semi-
text: balding).
text: Craig does his best to ignore him, until...
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Hey.
text: Craig turns to him. Upon closer inspection, he appears a bit
text: too disheveled to be a doctor or nurse. He looks at Craig
text: with an unhinged intensity.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You gotta cigarette?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Uh... no. Sorry.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What’s wrong with you?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I just don’t smoke.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No, I mean why are you in the E.R. at
dialog: five o’clock on a Sunday morning?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: (hesitant)
dialog: Well, um, there’s been a lot going on
dialog: in my head lately.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Go on.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Okay, well, um... I don’t really know
dialog: how to describe it. Like there’s a
dialog: girl...
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: And, you know, this summer school
dialog: application I’ve been nervous about.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Summer school.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Yeah, it’s like this super prestigious--
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: --Why would you want to spend your
dialog: summer in school?
text: Craig stares at Bobby for a beat.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You should be at Coney Island bird
text: dogging chicks on the beach.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Are you a doctor?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: You don’t really seem like a doctor.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Ever heard of Doogie Howser?
text: Craig stares at Bobby, trying to make sense of the question.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (standing up)
dialog: I hope they fix whatever’s wrong with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Thanks.
text: Bobby stalks off, disappears around a corner.
scene_heading: INT. E.R. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - LATER
scene_heading: DR. ISAIAH MAHMOUD, an E.R. resident (Indian, early 30s)
text: takes Craig’s blood pressure.
speaker_heading: DR. MAHMOUD
dialog: How long have you been feeling
dialog: suicidal?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I don’t know... I’ve been depressed
dialog: for about a year now. Thought about it
dialog: a few times, but never like this.
dialog: Never so... real.
speaker_heading: DR. MAHMOUD
dialog: Did anything specific happen today that
dialog: might have triggered these feelings?
text: Slight PUSH IN on Craig...
speaker_heading: CRAIG (V.0.)
dialog: Sometimes I wish I had an easy answer
dialog: for why I’m depressed. My father beat
dialog: me. Or I was sexually abused. But
dialog: none of that stuff has ever happened to
dialog: me... It was just a normal Saturday.
scene_heading: INT. AARON’S BEDROOM - EARLIER THAT DAY
text: Craig and his friends lounge around the room, listening to
dialog: Aaron's record collection. There is: AARON (not particularly
text: good-looking, but supremely self-confident), his girlfriend
text: NIA (an ultra-hip, tightly-clad cutie), RONNY (a 1990s hip-
text: hop throwback), and SCUGGS (jew-fro).
text: Ronny coughs, exhaling smoke, and passes a joint to Aaron,
text: who cuddles next to Nia on the bed. Everyone talks
text: animatedly, except for Craig, who stares at Nia, longingly.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: He practically had to strip search me
dialog: to find it. It's like, dude, you're a
text: security guard at a rock concert. Why
dialog: are you taking your job so seriously?
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: He probably just wanted some free weed.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: How much did they get?
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: An eighth. But it was worth it. APW
dialog: was the bomb.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: It was pretty jokes... But oh-eight was
text: off the hook.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I need to go.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: What-- you’re leaving? I didn’t even
dialog: play Saucerful of Secrets yet.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Yeah, I just...
speaker_heading: SCUGGS
dialog: Don’t bug Craig. He’s in the Craig
dialog: zone.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: Yeah, he’s Craig-ing out!
text: They all laugh. Craig forces a chuckle.
scene_heading: EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY
text: Craig rides his bike over the bridge, stops to answer his
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Hey...
scene_heading: INT. AARON’S BEDROOM - DAY
text: Nia playfully pushes Aaron off her.
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: Hey Craig. I forgot to ask you to
dialog: cover for me tonight, in case my
dialog: parents call or whatever.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Oh... You're staying over Aaron's?
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: I told them there was some school sleep
dialog: over. They’re a little suspicious, so
dialog: they might call.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: No problem.
text: Craig hangs up, looks out over the East River.
scene_heading: INT. CRAIG'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Craig's family sits around the table for dinner.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hey there, Craigers. How's the
dialog: Franklin Gates application coming
dialog: along?
text: Craig stares at his dad for a beat, then VOMITS on the table.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Gross.
text: Craig's parents look to him, concerned.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: (to Lynn)
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (with Dr. Mahmoud’s voice)
dialog: Craig? Anything you can think of that
dialog: may have set you off?
scene_heading: INT. ARGENON HOSPITAL - E.R. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - PRESENT
text: Dr. Mahmoud waits for an answer.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Um... no. Nothing unusual.
speaker_heading: DR. MAHMOUD
dialog: Are you taking any medication?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Zoloft. But I stopped.
speaker_heading: DR. MAHMOUD
dialog: Did your doctor take you off the
dialog: medication?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: No. I just stopped on my own.
speaker_heading: DR. MAHMOUD
dialog: Oh... you shouldn’t do that.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Yeah, I know.
speaker_heading: DR. MAHMOUD
dialog: Do your parents know where you are?
text: Craig shakes his head.
speaker_heading: DR. MAHMOUD
dialog: Well, Craig, you don’t seem to be in
dialog: immediate danger to yourself, so I
dialog: think we should call your parents, tell
dialog: them what happened, and refer you to
dialog: one of our out-patient services.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: But I need help now. The hotline said
dialog: you'd help me.
speaker_heading: DR. MAHMOUD
dialog: I understand you’re upset, but the
dialog: people we admit to the hospital are
dialog: very sick.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I am too. Can’t you, like, give me
dialog: something...
speaker_heading: DR. MAHMOUD
dialog: Not without parental consent. Look,
dialog: this is serious business, Craig. We
dialog: very rarely take in patients your age.
dialog: I think it would be best if we tried to
dialog: handle this without--
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Okay, maybe I'm not explaining right...
dialog: how serious. See, my school is really--
dialog: and not just my school-- it's like I
dialog: throw up sometimes because everything
text: feels like it's building up. And
dialog: everyone else seems like they're
dialog: totally handling everything-- like my
dialog: friends, right? Aaron and Nia--
dialog: They're both so... But not me. I like
dialog: sweat all the time. I'm sweating now,
dialog: aren't I?
text: Craig wipes his forehead, catches his breath.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: You know what I mean?
text: Dr. Mahmoud doesn’t move.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I’m scared, okay? I can’t go back out
dialog: there... I don’t know what... I might
dialog: do something... I just need some help.
dialog: Please. I need you to help me.
text: Dr. Mahmoud stares at Craig, concerned. He thinks it over.
text: INSERT: Dr. Mahmoud signs the admittance form.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
text: We follow NURSE SMITTY, a thin, bearded hippy-looking dude in
text: blue jeans, as he leads Craig off the elevator. Craig
text: notices a sign on the wall reading ADULT PSYCHIATRIC with an
text: arrow pointing to the right.
text: Smitty leads Craig towards a set of heavy double doors
text: labeled THREE NORTH. Smitty flashes his ID, and the Three
text: North SECURITY GUARD buzzes them inside.
text: After they pass through the threshold, the doors shut, and
text: the lock echoes through the corridors.
text: ON CRAIG, peering over his shoulder at the prison-like metal
dialog: doors.
scene_heading: INT. THREE NORTH REGISTRATION OFFICE - MINUTES LATER
text: A cute, West-Indian Nurse, MONICA, sips coffee behind the
text: desk. Nurse Smitty shuffles papers nearby.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Welcome to Three North, Craig. Let’s
dialog: go over some rules. First rule of
dialog: Three North: we do NOT talk about
dialog: Three North.
text: This grabs Craig’s attention. Smitty cracks up.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Just kidding.
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: That gets me every time.
text: Craig forces a smile.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: What exactly is Three North?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Our adult psychiatric floor.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Oh, but I’m only sixteen.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Our teen floor is undergoing
dialog: renovations, so all teens are here with
dialog: the adults.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Oh...
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: And you'll be expected to act like one
dialog: while you’re with us.
text: Craig nods.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: So, starting tomorrow, you'll be
dialog: following the schedule and
dialog: participating in the group activities.
text: She hands Craig a sheet of paper.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Our floor has a point system, whereby
dialog: patients get privileges for
dialog: participating in activities and meals,
dialog: and lose privileges for non-
dialog: participation and/or acting out.
text: INSERT: A schedule outlining the hour-by-hour itinerary for
text: the week. Includes things like: BREAKFAST, VITALS, THERAPY
scene_heading: (GP. #1), ARTS & CRAFTS, BINGO, LUNCH.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: In the meantime, we’ll contact your
dialog: family, and they can bring over a
dialog: change of clothes, toothbrush, that
dialog: kind of thing.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Um, well, I don’t think I’1l be here
dialog: that long. I have school tomorrow,
dialog: SO...
text: Monica and Smitty exchange knowing glances.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: You’1l have to discuss that with Doctor
dialog: Minerva. Now, very important... do you
dialog: have any sharp objects on you? Pocket
dialog: knife? Keys?
text: Craig hands her his keys.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Good. We’ll need your cell phone and
dialog: belt, too. And your shoe laces.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Shoe laces?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: We can’t take any chances.
text: Craig hands over his phone and watches as Monica seals it
text: inside a plastic bag with his keys and shoelaces.
scene_heading: INT. THREE NORTH - EAST CORRIDOR
text: Smitty leads Craig (minus shoelaces) down the hall. They
text: pass several other PATIENTS, including a TWEAKED-OUT MAN
text: wearing an oversized Backstreet Boys t-shirt. He makes a
text: ZAPPING noise in Craig’s direction.
text: Smitty spots a woman in a professional skirt suit
text: approaching. She is DR. EDEN MINERVA (late 40s), the staff
dialog: psychiatrist.
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: Hey, Dr. Minerva...
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: Hey Smitty.
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: This is our newest patient, Craig
dialog: Gilner.
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: Hi Craig. How are you?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Um... just, like... you know...
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: You just get settled in. We’1ll talk
dialog: later, okay? Nice to meet you, Craig.
text: Smitty and Craig continue down the hall, where a patient,
text: JIMMY, smiles to Craig. He has one tooth.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Don’t worry, it’ll come to ya.
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: Good morning, Jimmy.
text: Craig nervously steps past Jimmy.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: What was that about?
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: Jimmy’s schizophrenic.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Is there a place here for people more
dialog: like me?
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: We have all kinds of patients here.
dialog: (calling 0.S.)
dialog: Bobby, my man!
text: Camera TRACKS IN on BOBBY-- the same guy who sat next to
text: Craig in the E.R. As he glides down the hall in SLOW-MO
text: Craig gets a better look at him. No longer wearing doctors’
text: scrubs, Bobby sports a well-worn grey wool sweater.
text: set eyes and rough edges betray a hard-lived past.
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: How ‘bout a tour for our new friend,
dialog: Craig, here?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Sure thing, babe.
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: Bobby’11 show you around while we fix
dialog: up your room. See you guys in a jiff.
text: Smitty splits and Craig follows Bobby.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What’s a jiff?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: A jiff?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: This guy, Smitty, is always like, “Do
dialog: this in a jiff, that in a jiff.”
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I think it just means, like, a short
dialog: period of time.
text: Bobby doesn’t seem to care about Craig’s answer.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: So, is this like a mental ward?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Not a ward, a hospital...
text: They turn a corner out of sight.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM/REC ROOM
text: Bobby leads Craig into a large multi-purpose room, where ten
text: or so PATIENTS are scattered about.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: We spend a lot of time in here. Right
dialog: there you got your dining room
text: situation; rec room area is over there.
dialog: They got a record player, but
dialog: everything's scratched.
text: Craig notices a ping-pong table by the windows.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Folks play table tennis sometimes. Did
dialog: they tell you about the points?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: For ping-pong?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Some people call it ping-pong, but I
dialog: think that trivializes the sport.
text: Craig nods.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: But I’m talking about the other points.
dialog: You need’m for privileges, like hanging
text: in the rec room, trips to the gift
dialog: shop, shit like that.
text: Craig makes eye contact with a white-bearded guy, ROGER, who
text: appears to stare straight through Craig into another
dialog: dimension.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Hey, man, if you’re really interested,
dialog: you can join them.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Join them? Uh, no, I’m cool, thanks.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Cool Craig. Copy that. Let’s move.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY- OUTSIDE THE SHOWER ROOM
text: Bobby points out a sliding latch on the door.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Okay, this is the shower. It doesn’t
dialog: have a lock, see? So when you’re
dialog: inside, you put this to occupied.
text: Bobby slides the latch back and forth, alternately revealing
scene_heading: VACANT and OCCUPIED.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I get it.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Sure, babe, but nobody else does, so
dialog: they’1l walk right in while you’re
dialog: scrubbin’ your nuts.
text: Craig cracks a smile, follows Bobby down the hall.
scene_heading: INT. NORTH CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
text: Bobby and Craig emerge around the corner.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
text: There’s one in the other hall too, but
dialog: I wouldn’t use it. It bothers Solomon.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Who’s Solomon?
text: No answer. They approach a pay phone near a bench.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: This is where you call people-- if you
dialog: got people. Or they can call you too.
text: Bobby gestures to the TV room behind a glass window.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: TV room is here.
scene_heading: INT. TV ROOM
text: Craig notices a teenage girl (16), wearing an Iggy Pop t-
text: shirt, seated at a table in the corner. She is NOELLE. She
text: glances up from her notebook, revealing several scars from
text: cuts on her face. Craig stares at her for a beat too long.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: (alarmed)
dialog: Oh, my God! Are you okay?
text: Craig quickly checks himself, but can’t find anything wrong.
text: He looks back to Noelle, who shoots him a subtle grin and
text: gets back to her notebook.
text: Bobby cracks up, leads Craig away.
scene_heading: INT. NORTH CORRIDOR
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Who was that?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Noelle. One of the teens. Did they
dialog: tell you about the renovations?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: How old are you?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Sixteen.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Jesus, I thought you was older. You
dialog: look too stressed for sixteen, man.
dialog: You should try to relax, maybe get a
dialog: girlfriend, or sump’m.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I’m working on it.
text: Bobby shoots Craig a crooked smile.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: So what do you do here, exactly?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Same thing you do.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: You're a patient? What were you doing
dialog: in the emergency room this morning?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: The ER has the best coffee.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: They just let you out?
text: Bobby smiles, puts his finger to his lips, makes a shushing
dialog: sound.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: What are you in for?
text: Bobby hesitates, and Craig senses the inappropriateness of
dialog: the question.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Uh... Sorry.
text: Bobby stares at Craig, sizes him up.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Bet your room’s ready. Let’s find
dialog: smitty.
scene_heading: INT. THREE NORTH PATIENT’S ROOM - DAY
text: The light flicks on to reveal a man burrowed under bed covers
text: in the corner.
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: Muqtada, it’s almost lunch! Wake up,
dialog: you have a new roommate.
text: MUQTADA, a gray-bearded Egyptian man, doesn’t move.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Hey.
dialog: No response.
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: (quietly, to Craig)
dialog: Don’t take it personal. He doesn’t
dialog: talk much and he’s never left the
dialog: room... Okay, guys, lunch in five.
text: Smitty exits, and Craig sits at the edge of his bed.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: What do they have for lunch?
text: Muqtada grumbles something incomprehensible.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I’m sorry?
text: Muqtada takes the blanket and puts it over his head. Craig
text: surveys the room. This isn’t quite what he had in mind when
dialog: he asked for help.
text: After an uncomfortable beat, he goes to the door.
speaker_heading: MUQTADA
dialog: Please, turn out light.
text: Craig obliges, leaves the room.
scene_heading: INT. THREE NORTH - EAST CORRIDOR
text: Craig accosts Dr. Minerva, who is now doing rounds with a
text: staff of INTERNS.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Dr. Minerva. Look, I’m, uh...
dialog: (faking casual)
dialog: I’m feeling much better now. I was
dialog: feeling bad this morning, but I think
dialog: I’m okay now. So, um, you know, I’d
dialog: like to go home. If that’s cool.
text: Dr. Minerva leafs through papers on her clipboard, finds
text: Craig's form.
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: It says here you’re suicidal and asked
dialog: to be admitted.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I thought you guys would be able to do
dialog: something quick. Like give me some
dialog: medication to make me feel better. I
dialog: didn't think I’d be... committed. I
dialog: really don’t think I belong here.
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: A lot of patients feel that way at
dialog: first. Just give it a little time.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: How little?
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: Five days.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Five days?
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: Definitely not more than thirty. We’l1l
dialog: have an evaluation to see if you're
dialog: ready to leave Thursday.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: But I can’t be here until Thursday!
dialog: I’‘1ll miss school. My friends will find
dialog: out where I am!
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: It’s nothing to be ashamed of, Craig.
dialog: Depression is a medical illness. If
dialog: you were diabetic would you be
dialog: embarrassed by that?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Well, can I at least talk to my mom
dialog: about this before--
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: Of course, Craig. I just spoke with
dialog: her myself, and she’s very anxious to
dialog: see you.
text: Dr. Minerva nods and smiles to someone behind Craig, then
text: drifts away.
speaker_heading: LYNN (0.S.)
dialog: Craig!
text: Craig turns to find his mom running at him followed by George
text: and Alyssa. She nearly tackles him with a hug, and we FREEZE-
speaker_heading: CRAIG (V.0.)
dialog: Don’t blame my parents for how messed
dialog: up I am. Okay, so my dad works too
dialog: much...
text: ANGLE ON George, frozen in time, messaging on his Blackberry.
speaker_heading: CRAIG (V.0.)
dialog: And my mom’s a little out of touch.
text: ANGLE ON Lynn, her face oddly contorted as she hugs Craig.
speaker_heading: CRAIG (V.0.)
dialog: And my sister’s some kind of child
dialog: genius.
text: ANGLE ON Alyssa staring straight ahead without emotion.
speaker_heading: CRAIG (V.0.)
dialog: But it’s not like I was never hugged as
dialog: a child or anything. In fact, they’ve
dialog: been pretty supportive through all
dialog: this. They’re always on the lookout
dialog: for new ways to fix me.
dialog: The following sequence presents the various ways they’ve
text: tried to fix him in the past. Craig maintains the same
text: deadpan expression throughout...
scene_heading: INT. CRAIG'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: A CHINESE ACUPUNCTURIST applies needles to Craig’s back,
text: while his mom looks on.
scene_heading: INT. CRAIG'S BEDROOM - ANOTHER DAY
text: Craig and his dad attempt to do sit-ups on some kind of
text: enormous rubber work-out balls. Craig falls off.
scene_heading: INT. CRAIG'S BEDROOM - ANOTHER DAY
text: Craig practices bikram yoga with his mom in 105 degree heat.
text: He’s drenched in sweat, but not quite feeling the vibe.
scene_heading: INT. CRAIG’S BEDROOM - ANOTHER DAY
text: On a ping-pong table that barely fits inside his small
text: bedroom, Craig serves to his dad, who slams the ball back at

speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Oh, really? Because I was kind of

speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: We talked to the doctor and they need
dialog: to keep you here for a few days. For
dialog: observation. I think it’s a good idea.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: But I don’t think you understand. Some

speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: CRAIG

speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: They told me AT LEAST five.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Well, we thought it was best to leave

speaker_heading: BECCA

speaker_heading: JENNIFER

speaker_heading: NOELLE

speaker_heading: CRAIG

speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: You don’t have to act so surprised, but
dialog: yes, yes I had a lotta women. And, no,

speaker_heading: HUMBLE
dialog: That’s it?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: That’s it. But it don’t hurt if you

speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Don’t mess with the kid’s head; he’s

speaker_heading: HUMBLE
dialog: Why you so screwed up, kid?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Um...
speaker_heading: BOBBY

speaker_heading: HUMBLE

dialog: Bobby, it’s okay if you want to keep
dialog: your feelings private, but you should
dialog: know it’s perfectly normal to be
dialog: nervous about your interview tomorrow.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I’m not nervous about the interview.
speaker_heading: HUMBLE
dialog: Then what is it, Bob?
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
text: Maybe he’s hungry.
speaker_heading: HUMBLE
text: He doesn’t look hungry.
speaker_heading: BECCA
text: He looks tired.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Did you sleep last night?
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: He didn’t eat today.
speaker_heading: HUMBLE
dialog: Yes, he did.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Did you see him eat?
speaker_heading: HUMBLE
dialog: I’m pretty sure he ate.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I didn’t see him eat.
speaker_heading: BECCA
dialog: I get anxious when I’m tired.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Okay, listen!
text: Everybody turns to Bobby.
dialog: I’m not hungry. I’m not tired. It’s
dialog: this damn sweater. My interview is
dialog: tomorrow and it’s all I have to wear.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (low to Minerva)
dialog: I told you it was the interview.
speaker_heading: HUMBLE
dialog: It’s a nice sweater, Bob.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
text: No. It isn’t. It smells like an old
text: woman’s armpit in July.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: But it looks good on you.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah, it looks about as good on me as
dialog: your hair on you.
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: Bobby, no insults, please.
text: Suddenly self-conscious, Johnny runs his hand over his head.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I can loan you a shirt.
text: Noelle and the group turn to Craig.
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: What was that, Craig?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I‘1l call my mom, have her bring one of
dialog: my dad’s shirts. It’s no problem. I
text: live like two blocks away.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No thanks.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Bobby! Take the shirt.
speaker_heading: HUMBLE
dialog: Yeah, he’s tryin’ to help, Bob.
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: It’s a very nice offer, Craig. Bobby,
dialog: why are you reluctant to accept it?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Look, I don’t need any handouts.
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: It’s not exactly a handout, Bobby.
dialog: He’d just be loaning it to you.
dialog: There’s nothing wrong with accepting
text: help from each other.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Okay, fine, will you leave me alone if
dialog: I take the shirt?
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: Do you want the shirt, Bobby?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah, I want the shirt.
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: Craig?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Do you mind if it has yellow armpit
dialog: stains?
text: Bobby stares at Craig.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Sorry, dumb joke.
text: Noelle SNORTS out a laugh.
scene_heading: INT. THREE NORTH - NORTH CORRIDOR - LATER THAT DAY
text: Craig waits for the community phone, which Bobby is using.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (flustered)
dialog: Okay, but look, look, look. I want to
dialog: see her. Yes, I’m her father, don’t
dialog: you think I have... No? I have a
dialog: place... I will have a place...
dialog: Thursday... You don’t have to believe
dialog: me, but it’s true... It is true. I’m
dialog: not-- Look, just bring her. Please. I
dialog: don’t ask you for anything. I just
dialog: want to see my kid...
text: After watching Bobby for a beat, Craig feels something brush
text: by him, turns to see Noelle disappear around the corner. He
text: looks down to find a folded piece of paper at his feet.

speaker_heading: B54
speaker_heading: C54
speaker_heading: D54
text: Craig glances up from the note. Bobby is now gone and the
dialog: phone is free.
text: Craig enters his number into the voice mail system, A54
text: wherein we SPLIT-SCREEN with Nia. She’s on her cell IN THE
speaker_heading: BATHTUB.
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: Hey, Craig, it’s me, um...
speaker_heading: The image FREEZES--
speaker_heading: CRAIG (V.0.)
dialog: Here's the thing... she’s probably not
dialog: in the tub right now, but whenever I
dialog: talk to Nia, this is how I picture her.
dialog: It’s kinda sick, I know.
text: The image resumes action.
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: You sounded kinda weird earlier, so I
dialog: just wanted to make sure you were doing
dialog: all right. Okay, that’s it. I’m with
dialog: Aaron. He’s being a total dick. Bye.
text: Craig hits another button, wherein Craig's science B54
text: teacher, MR. REYNOLDS replaces Nia. Wearing protective eye-
text: goggles, he fills a smoking beaker with blue liquid.
scene_heading: MR. REYNOLDS
dialog: Hello, Mr. Gilner, this is your science
dialog: teacher, Mr. Reynolds. We really need
dialog: to talk about your missing lab
text: assignments. Five of them.
text: Craig hits the button again, wherein Aaron replaces C54
text: Mr. Reynolds. He’s in the bathtub with Nia.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Yo Craig, I'm staying at Nia’s tonight.
dialog: I need you to cover for me if my dad
dialog: calls. Holla back, son!
text: Craig hangs up, notices an old, academic-type lady waiting
text: for the phone nearby. She is “THE PROFESSOR.” He quickly
dialog: dials...
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Hey, Nia. What's up?
text: We INTERCUT between Craig and Nia in her bedroom. D54
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: Just finishing my Gates Summer app.
dialog: I'll freak if I don't get in.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: What's up with you?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Uh, I’ve just been feeling kinda, you
dialog: know...
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: Yeah, I’ve noticed... Is that why you
dialog: weren’t in school today?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Yeah... Like I’ve been feeling pretty
dialog: shitty, so... I stayed home.
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: I get like that sometimes, too.
dialog: Depressed or whatever. Do you take
dialog: anything for it?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: You know...
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Um...
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: Look, I’ve never told anybody this.
dialog: Not even Aaron. So you have to promise
dialog: not to tell him. But if it makes you
dialog: feel any better... I’m on Prozac.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: Yeah, for like over a year now.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I had no idea.
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: I know. It’s a little embarrassing.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: (summoning his courage)
dialog: I take Zoloft.
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: Shut up!
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: We are so screwed up!
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Like partners in mental illness.
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: The illest.
text: As they both laugh, a Hasidic Jewish guy,
text: down the hall toward Craig. His hospital
text: big for him, so he has to hold them up at
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: I’m Solomon.
text: Craig cups the receiver, tries to quietly
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: SOLOMON, dashes
dialog: pants are way too
dialog: all times.
dialog: shush Solomon.
dialog: I would ask you to please keep it down.
dialog: I am trying to rest.
text: Solomon races away, struggling to hold up
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: Craig? Who was that?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Um...
text: his pants.
text: The Professor approaches, taps Craig’s shoulder with her cane.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Excuse me, will you be much longer?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: One second, please.
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: Is everything okay?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Yeah, I’m just...
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: Are you like in a crack den or
dialog: something?
text: Jimmy strolls by, repeating...
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: It'll come to ya! Don’t worry, it
dialog: always come to ya!
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: Where are you?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I gotta go, Nia. Bye.
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: Craig?
text: Craig hangs up, turns to the Professor.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: All yours.
text: He exits frame and the Professor eyes him suspiciously before
text: picking up the receiver and examining it.
scene_heading: INT. THREE NORTH - WAITING AREA - DAY
text: Craig approaches little Alyssa and Lynn, who is holding his
text: dad’s shirt. They hug.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Thanks, mom.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Your dad's at the office dealing with a
dialog: client crisis, but he’ll be by
dialog: tomorrow.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Client crisis?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Have you made any friends yet?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Um, yeah, I guess.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: (looking past Craig)
dialog: Are you friends with the tranny?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Not really.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Tranny?
text: Lynn cocks her head to see Jennifer checking out at the
text: registration desk down the hall. She’s wearing a coat and
text: carrying a small suitcase.
text: Jimmy, lingering nearby, calls out at full volume.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Transvestite!
text: Jennifer turns in their direction, yells down the hall.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Schizo!
text: Alyssa and Lynn stare ahead, uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Did you talk to my school? I really
dialog: don’t want them to know I’m in a place
dialog: like this. It could really damage my
dialog: future.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: We just told them you were in the
dialog: hospital. Nothing specific.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Good. The last thing I need is for
dialog: people to find out I’ve been
dialog: institutionalized. I’m talking
dialog: cataclysmic disaster the proportions of
dialog: which have no limits.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Okay, Craig. Got it.
scene_heading: INT. BOBBY’S ROOM
text: Craig leans into the room, looks around. Nobody there. He
text: carefully lays out the shirt on Bobby’s bed, notices a photo
text: of a young girl at his bedside. As he examines it closer...
speaker_heading: BOBBY (0.S.)
dialog: Hey, what’s goin’ on, babe?
text: Bobby walks in from the hallway.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Oh, sorry. I was just bringing you the
dialog: shirt.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (re: the photo)
dialog: She’s cute, right?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Yeah. Is she yours?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (nods )
dialog: Veronica. Like the Elvis Costello
dialog: song.
text: Craig stares at Bobby, clearly not aware of the song.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: How old is she?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Eight and three-quarters. That’s what
dialog: she says.
text: Craig smiles.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Well, good luck on your interview.
dialog: What’s it for, if you don’t mind me
dialog: asking?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: It’s for a group home. I basically
dialog: need a place to live when they kick me
dialog: outta here on Thursday.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Kick you out?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Insurance only covers a certain number
dialog: of days here, so come Thursday, I’m
dialog: gone. Whether I got a place to sleep
dialog: or not.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Wow. I guess you’re under a lot of
dialog: pressure, then.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I mean, it’s not like a summer school
dialog: application, but yeah, I guess...
text: Craig smiles.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Let me know if you need somebody to
dialog: practice with, or something.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Like a practice interview. So you’re
dialog: better prepared.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Yeah. Wanta try?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah, okay. Now?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Yeah, sure.
dialog: (as interviewer)
dialog: Okay, um, have a seat.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Wait, hold on.
text: Bobby grabs the new shirt, turns his back to Craig, and
text: buttons it up. He spins around, ready to go.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Okay, let’s do it.
text: They sit on opposite beds, facing each other.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Okay, let’s see... Why do you think
dialog: you're qualified to live in this group
dialog: home?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Well... I guess because I’1l be
dialog: homeless if you don’t accept me.
text: Craig stares at Bobby, not sure where to go from here.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Okay, good. I think you’re ready.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Really? I didn’t sound too desperate?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: No, it was very sincere... But maybe
dialog: you could try to focus on the positive
dialog: things you would get from the
dialog: experience rather than, you know...
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: The negative.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Exactly. Like what do you think you
dialog: can bring to the home? Something
dialog: special only you can offer.
text: Bobby thinks hard.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: It can be anything. Maybe you have a
dialog: great attitude?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: You always clean up after yourself?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Not really.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: You know what? I think maybe sometimes
dialog: in these situations it’s okay to bend
dialog: the truth a little.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I wouldn't want to raise anyone's
text: expectations and then disappoint them.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: That’s it! You’re pragmatic! Right
dialog: there. That’s what you tell them.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Yeah. I think you’1l do great.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Thanks, babe. You up for a match of
dialog: table tennis?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Um, I’m actually pretty terrible at it.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Relax babe. It’s just for fun.
scene_heading: INT. REC ROOM - MINUTES LATER
text: Bobby holds the ball, addressing Craig on the opposite side.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: We play a lot around here, but the
dialog: problem is most people are too zonked
text: out on their meds to compete.
text: Bobby serves to Craig’s partner, Roger, but the ball just
text: bounces past him. After a beat, Roger swings for it. Craig
text: can’t help but laugh.
scene_heading: INT. THREE NORTH - NORTH CORRIDOR - EVENING
text: Craig sits down on the hallway bench across from the rec
text: room. Looks to the wall clock, which reads 6:58.
text: Nearby, Johnny talks on the telephone.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: No, but-- I never said those things.
dialog: She’s a liar... Please, baby. Baby,
dialog: baby, please, listen, listen....
text: Johnny notices Craig nearby, pauses for dramatic effect.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: ...I love you. You know, I love you...
dialog: That’s right. Sure. Don’t worry about
dialog: it. Of course, I forgive you, baby.
text: Johnny gives Craig a thumbs up and a smile. Craig looks on,
dialog: awed by his mastery of women, when...
text: .--Noelle approaches. Craig plays it cool, as she takes a
text: seat next to him.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: You came.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Yeah. I mean, like, I had other plans,
dialog: but I cancelled them.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Good. I thought I mighta scared you
dialog: off yesterday.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Oh, yeah, celebrity suicide. Kinda
dialog: weird.
text: Craig notices several old scars on Noelle’s forearm, peaking
text: out of her bunched up sleeve. Seeing this, Noelle subtly
text: pulls her sleeves over her palms.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Okay, check it out... We’re gonna play
text: a different game now.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: I ask you a question and you ask me a
dialog: question.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Do we answer them?
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: It’s up to you, but no matter what, you
dialog: have to finish with a question. Here
dialog: we go... You ready?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: I said finish with a question. Are you
dialog: stupid?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Uh, no... Are you?
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: There you go. Do you think I’m gross
dialog: looking?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: No, you look awesome.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: What’s your question?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Why'd you invite me here?
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: I thought it was nice that you loaned
dialog: Bobby your shirt. Don’t you think this
dialog: is a good way to get to know someone?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Sure. Have you played this before?
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Not in here. Are you a virgin?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: So... How long have you been here?
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Oooh, nice transition, Craig. Twenty-
dialog: one days. Who brought you here?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I checked myself in, I guess. Kinda by
dialog: accident. The suicide hotline said to
dialog: come. Why are you here so long?
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: They think I might cut myself again.
dialog: Why'd you call the suicide hotline?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I guess because I didn’t actually want
dialog: to kill myself... even though I kind of
dialog: did. Does that make sense?
text: Noelle nods.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: So, why did you kind of want to kill
dialog: yourself?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Depression... stress. Have you ever
dialog: heard of the Franklin Gates University--
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: --Scholastic Summer Semester? Yes. So
dialog: you messed up the application or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: No, I mean, I haven’t even started yet.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Finish with a question. Isn’t it due
dialog: on Friday?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Geez. Do you have to remind me?
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Sorry. So are you some kind of brain
dialog: or something?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I work hard, but I’m not that smart. I
dialog: get Bs. How about you?
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: I don’t care too much about school.
dialog: The teachers think I have a problem
dialog: with authority. Where do you go?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Executive Pre-Professional. You?
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Delfin. You’re not some kind of school
dialog: uniform perv, are you?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: You guys wear uniforms?
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: See, I knew it!
dialog: (flinching)
dialog: Is there a bug on my face?
text: Craig examines her face, finds a loose eyelash near her eye.
text: He holds it up for her to see.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Make a wish.
text: Noelle thinks for a beat, blows it away.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Is the game over yet?
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Sure.
text: Craig leans back, takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: What do we do now?
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Are you still playing?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: No... are you?
text: They both laugh. Noelle jumps to her feet.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: I‘1l race you to arts and crafts.
text: Noelle takes off down the hall at full speed. Craig watches
text: her for a second, then gives chase. As they pass Smitty...
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: Hey, no running, please!
scene_heading: INT. REC ROOM - MINUTES LATER
text: JOANIE, the recreation director, addresses the class.
speaker_heading: JOANIE
dialog: This is free period arts recreational
dialog: therapy for you latecomers.
text: The room full of PATIENTS turn their heads toward Craig and
text: Noelle, just now taking their seats in the back.
text: Bobby cranes his neck, whispers over his shoulder to Craig:
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Cool Craig. Still workin’ on it?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: It’s not what you think.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Call me crazy, but I think you guys
dialog: were probably out there playing the
dialog: question game.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Oh, then I guess it is what you think.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Thought so.
text: Joanie strolls up to Craig, introduces herself.
speaker_heading: JOANIE
dialog: I’m Joanie, the recreation director.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Craig.
speaker_heading: JOANIE
text: Materials are on the table, Craig.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Oh, that’s okay. I don’t really draw.
speaker_heading: JOANIE
dialog: Sure you do. It doesn’t have to be
dialog: representative. It can be abstract.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: That’s okay, I’1l just--
text: Joanie turns to the class.
speaker_heading: JOANIE
dialog: Everyone? Our new guest, Craig, has
dialog: what we call an artistic block. He
dialog: doesn’t know what to draw.
speaker_heading: HUMBLE
dialog: How about beavers?
speaker_heading: JOANIE
dialog: Humble, we do not draw the sort of
dialog: beavers you’re talking about.
speaker_heading: HUMBLE
dialog: Oh really?
text: Humble holds up his drawing of an actual beaver.
speaker_heading: JOANIE
dialog: That’s a very nice drawing, Humble.
text: Roger, from Saturday’s ping-pong match, calls out in general:
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Rolling pin!
speaker_heading: JOANIE
dialog: What was that, Roger? That’s very
dialog: good. What did you say?
dialog: But Roger clams up, won’t repeat it.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: (to Noelle)
dialog: This is weird.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: She won’t get off your back until you
dialog: draw something. Anything. I bet you
dialog: have some crazy stuff in that messed up
dialog: little mind of yours.
text: We ZOOM IN on Craig’s eyes, and enter his brain, which is an
text: elaborate maze of winding rivers and roads. We travel
text: through Craig’s animated mind village, until...
text: .+.we emerge out of a fireplace into...
scene_heading: INT. CRAIG’S LIVING ROOM - FLASHBACK
text: Craig's Mom, LYNN, and Dad, GEORGE, watch Bill Clinton’s

scene_heading: SUPER: BROOKLYN, 1999
text: INSIDE THE FORT. FIVE-YEAR-OLD Craig struggles to trace a
text: map of Manhattan. Frustrated, he CRUMPLES the paper.
speaker_heading: LITTLE CRAIG
dialog: Shit!
text: OUTSIDE THE FORT. Lynn and George exchange glances.
text: BACK INSIDE. Lynn peaks her head in to find 16-YEAR-OLD
text: CRAIG, in too-small jammies, looking pissed off.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Craig, honey, what's the matter?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I can't do it. Five years old and I’m
dialog: already a failure.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: What can’t you do?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I can’t even trace Manhattan on tracing
dialog: paper. Tracing paper! Are you
dialog: kidding?
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Craig, you can’t just trace freehand
dialog: and expect it to be perfect.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: You're five years old.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: That’s no excuse. Mozart composed
dialog: three major symphonies by the time he
dialog: was five.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (0.S.)
dialog: He’s right, ya know.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Craig, listen, I have an idea. Instead
dialog: of trying to trace maps of Manhattan,
dialog: why don’t you make your own maps... of
dialog: imaginary places?
text: FIVE-YEAR-OLD CRAIG is back. He looks up to his mom as we
dialog: PUSH IN to CU. What a great idea!
speaker_heading: CRAIG (V.0.)
dialog: That was the closest I'd ever come to
text: an epiphany.
text: A60 The camera enters Craig’s drawing, swerving through A60
text: streets and around corners in his imaginary city, until...
text: B60 ..+.we PULL OUT, above the drawing. Craig’s hand B60
text: enters frame, putting the finishing touches on his new
dialog: creation.
text: WE ARE BACK IN THREE NORTH AT PRESENT TIME.
speaker_heading: JOANIE
text: Looks like somebody got unblocked.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR

speaker_heading: HUMBLE

speaker_heading: BECCA
dialog: It’s so pretty.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Not bad. Looks like a brain.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Yeah... It’s a brain map.
text: Craig turns to Noelle, but she’s gone. However, she’s left
text: an impressive drawing of an orchid with a short note: NICE

speaker_heading: CRAIG

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: My girl gave it to me. What’s it like

speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: How do you know where I am?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: C’mon Craig, we go to the same school.

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Don’t be a girl. You know if I was in

dialog: give me shit.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: It’s not a ward; it’s a hospital.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: What's the difference?

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Ask Nia what?
speaker_heading: NIA

speaker_heading: CRAIG

speaker_heading: AARON

scene_heading: INT. EPPHS CLASSROOM - DAY

speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: Huh... seems here someone neglected to

dialog: Who is it that doesn’t want to study at

scene_heading: INT. TV ROOM
text: A WOMAN SCREAMS at Bobby. His daughter, VERONICA, who we
text: recognize from the photo, watches in silence, while Roger
text: observes nearby. Johnny lingers just outside the room.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: What’s the matter with you?!
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Please lower your voice.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: How can you let your child see you like
dialog: this? What kind of father are you?
text: Bobby stares at his daughter across the table. She can’t
text: look him in the eyes.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I swear it’d be better for her if you
dialog: were dead. But you can’t even get that
dialog: right.
text: Smitty hurries into the room with Solomon following after.
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: Excuse me, Miss, you’re going to have

speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Waste of my time.
text: The woman grabs the girl by the hand and leads her out.
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: You okay, Bobby?
text: Bobby nods, forces a smile.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah... sorry about the noise, Sol.
text: As Bobby exits the room, Craig tries to avoid eye contact,
text: but Bobby puts on another smile.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (to Craig)
dialog: My accountant... Check a wrong box and
dialog: the bitch goes nuts.
text: Craig chuckles, awkward. As Bobby continues down the hall,
text: Craig approaches Johnny.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: What was that about?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
text: His ex. They make each other a little

text: Craig looks off.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Um, yeah, that’s right. Don’t stress
dialog: about it.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: There’s a guy in here. Bobby. He's
dialog: the one who borrowed your shirt. He
dialog: has an interview today. For a place to
dialog: live. He has a kid and if he doesn’t
dialog: get in, they could be homeless.
text: George and Lynn exchange uneasy looks.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Makes the Gates application seem pretty
dialog: insignificant...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, I’m sure you won’t be homeless if
dialog: you don’t get in, but that doesn’t mean
dialog: it’s not important.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: George.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Don’t you have a client in crisis

text: His attention drifts to the door when Bobby enters, wearing
text: the borrowed shirt on his head like a turban. He looks
text: totally dejected.
text: Craig watches as Bobby tumbles onto the couch and SCREAMS
text: into a pillow at full volume. He thrashes around on the
text: couch like a child having a temper tantrum.
text: After a few beats of this, Bobby rolls over onto his back,
text: makes eye contact with Craig. Hold, as Bobby’s breathing
text: steadies. Nobody moves.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I blew it.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: What happened?
text: Once again, Bobby screams at full volume, but this time he

scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: How did it make you feel? Seeing Bobby
dialog: like that.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I was scared... Not that he was going

dialog: someone lose it like that. It reminded
dialog: me of how I feel sometimes.
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: How’s that?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Like I’m on the verge of just blowing
dialog: up. All the stress, pressure, anxiety
text: bubbling up inside of me. But I’ve
dialog: never been able to, you know, let it

scene_heading: DR. MINERVA

speaker_heading: CRAIG (V.0.)
dialog: Then everything changed.

speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Girls, grades, parents, two wars,

scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: Craig, there’s a saying that goes

speaker_heading: A78
speaker_heading: B78

speaker_heading: JENNA

dialog: friends, and like... okay, this is
dialog: really embarrassing, but I heard about
dialog: all this stuff you went through, and I
dialog: kind of go through that stuff too. We

dialog: always thought you were just weird. I
dialog: didn’t realize you were, like,
dialog: depressed. Anyway, I just think we
dialog: should hang out, or whatever.
text: Craig hangs up, shakes his head in disbelief, as Bobby 78
text: approaches. He drapes the borrowed shirt over Craig’s head.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Thanks.
text: Craig removes the shirt, but Bobby continues down the hall.
text: He’s licking an ice cream cone. Craig rushes up to his side.
text: As they walk, other patients trickle out of their rooms and

speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Sorry you didn’t get into the home.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No sweat, babe. I actually don’t find

speaker_heading: NOELLE

speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Yeah, I know, what’s with these points?
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Nobody could possibly be keeping track
dialog: of them...
speaker_heading: SMITTY (0.S.)
dialog: That’s three points off for doubting

text: Craig smiles, whispers to Noelle.
speaker_heading: CRAIG

speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (smiling)

scene_heading: INT. PROFESSOR’S OFFICE - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. WILLIAMSBURG STREET - NIGHT

speaker_heading: BOBBY (V.0.)
dialog: Solomon was part of this cult of

speaker_heading: ACIDHEAD
dialog: (in Yiddish with

speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What about me?

speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Um... Your daughter. Veronica. When

speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I don’t know. I think maybe she’s

speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: C'mon, man...
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: For real. I mean, I’m not exactly a

text: Bobby nods, trying hard to convince himself.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Okay, so I know it’s none of my

speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Get lost.
text: Craig stares at Bobby for a tense beat, then looks down at

text: buckets.
text: After a brief silence, the room erupts in joyous applause, as
dialog: the patients and staff celebrate their awesome musical
dialog: presentation, even if it didn’t exactly happen the way we saw

text: We INTERCUT with Craig on the community phone. A86
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: You’re all anybody talks about anymore.
dialog: Like the whole school is obsessed with
dialog: you. But you may want to consider
dialog: getting a new look when you get out.
dialog: Like your cell phone is so Y2K.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Oh yeah, it’s kinda--
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: --Don’t worry, we'll find you something
dialog: cool, Craig.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Cool Craig.
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Oh, somebody here calls me that. “Cool

speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: Is that somebody a girl?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Oh, no.
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: Well, are there any cute girls there?
text: Craig thinks about how to respond.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Not really. Like a mental hospital
dialog: probably isn’t the best spot to hook
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: Speak for yourself. I’m dying to see
dialog: this place. Can I come visit?
speaker_heading: CRAIG

speaker_heading: CRAIG

speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Sometimes it’s good to get out of
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: If you know how to get out, why don't
dialog: you just leave?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Because it's crazier out there than it

speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I know what you mean.

speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Don’t play dumb. The energy is like...

speaker_heading: BOBBY

speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Ask her out?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah, you know. Out.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I like her, but I think I'd be too
text: nervous to ask her out.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What’re you nervous about?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Rejection.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You can’t live in fear, babe. You’1l
dialog: end up like Muqtada. Or worse, like
dialog: me.
text: Craig stares at Bobby, sympathetic.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: This is the part where you say, “No,
dialog: Bobby, you're life isn’t that bad.”
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Oh, sorry, I--
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Relax, babe.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I just--
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Point is you can’t worry about

speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Practice what?
speaker_heading: BOBBY

speaker_heading: BOBBY

speaker_heading: CRAIG

speaker_heading: BOBBY

speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Oh. Okay. Well... maybe we could go

speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You don’t seem so sure about it.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: No. I’m sure. Let’s go together.

speaker_heading: BOBBY

speaker_heading: CRAIG

speaker_heading: BOBBY

text: Craig nods.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You ask her what SHE likes...
speaker_heading: CRAIG

speaker_heading: BOBBY

text: Craig shoots, scores.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Good shot. It’s your lucky day, babe.

speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: How'd you end up here?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You don’t give up, do you? I’m here on
dialog: vacation.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Seriously.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I am serious. Some people go to the
dialog: Hamptons. I come here. People serve
dialog: me food. I get to rest, sleep, even
dialog: get a little high sometimes.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: That’s not what I heard about you.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What’d you hear?
dialog: The mood
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: You thought aliens stole your

speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What? Who told you that?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Relax, babe...
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (catching on)
dialog: Funny guy.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Actually, I heard your accountant say
dialog: you tried to kill yourself.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: This may come as a shock to you, Cool
dialog: Craig, but that wasn’t my accountant.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Gee, really?
speaker_heading: BOBBY

speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I thought about doing that, but
dialog: couldn't make it to the bridge; just
dialog: came straight here.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What stopped you?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: My parents, I think. And my sister.
dialog: Knowing how bad it would mess them up.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I don’t get you, Craig. Young. Smart.
dialog: Talented. A family loves you. I don’t
dialog: get it. What I wouldn’t give to be
dialog: you. Just for a day. I would do so
dialog: much. Just to feel like... you know...
dialog: there was a future worth living for.
dialog: Like out there was actually a better
dialog: life than in here. I would do so much.
dialog: Just live. Like it meant something...

speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: What’s going on?
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Look.
text: She gestures into the room, where Mugtada is out of bed, and
text: slowly approaching the door.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Hey, Muqtada, coming out for a walk?
text: Muqtada stops.
speaker_heading: BECCA
dialog: Shhh. You're disturbing his progress.
speaker_heading: MUQTADA
dialog: (still inside the room)
dialog: What is there to do?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Um, lots of stuff. You like to draw?
text: Muqtada shakes his head.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Ping-pong?
speaker_heading: MUQTADA
dialog: Ping... What?
speaker_heading: BECCA
dialog: How about music?
speaker_heading: MUQTADA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Great, okay--
speaker_heading: MUQTADA
dialog: --Only Egypt music.

speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Excuse me if you please I am trying to

speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Hey, Sol, have you met Muqtada?
text: Solomon reaches across the door threshold and shakes hands
dialog: with Muqtada.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: If you could please keep it down.
text: Solomon stalks off down the hall.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
text: He has sensitive hearing.
speaker_heading: MUQTADA
dialog: This I think is enough for one day.
text: Craig watches Muqtada go back to bed, climb under the covers.
scene_heading: INT. TV ROOM - DAY
text: Craig draws a series of brain maps, while his Gates

text: After a few moments, Craig hears a familiar voice.
speaker_heading: NIA (0.S.)
dialog: Hey Craig.
text: Craig's attention jerks to the door, where Nia strolls in.
text: His mood suddenly shifts from peaceful to anxious. He self-
text: consciously covers his art.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Hey... this is a surprise.
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: Aaron and I broke up.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Oh... I’m sorry.
text: Nia sits down next to him. She’s wearing a little beige
text: camouflage skirt, and Craig is suddenly hypnotized by her
text: thighs, which we slowly ZOOM IN on.
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: Are you okay?
text: Craig shifts uncomfortably in his seat, trying to conceal his
dialog: boner.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Oh, yeah... Um, sorry.
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: You must be really loaded.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Yeah. I’ma little zonked.
text: She puts her hand on his knee. He looks down at his lap.
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: You know, I've been thinking non-stop
dialog: about you since we talked Monday.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Oh, I’ve been thinking about you, too.
text: Jimmy walks by, shoots Craig a big smile.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I woke up and my bed was on fire!
text: Nia looks at him, makes a face.
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: What’s wrong with that guy?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: He’s schizophrenic.
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: Weird... Anyway...
dialog: (laying on the flirt)
dialog: It’s like you told me all this stuff
dialog: about you and you're really... I don’t
dialog: know... mature. Not like everyone else
dialog: with their stupid little problems.
dialog: You're like, really screwed up.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I’m a mess.
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: But in a good way. In the way that
dialog: gives you experience.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: So you and Aaron broke up?
text: Nia nods, biting her lip, and we FREEZE on her irresistible
dialog: expression.
speaker_heading: CRAIG (V.0.)
dialog: Okay, so I know I should be thinking
dialog: about Noelle and how I’m supposed to be
dialog: meeting her in twenty minutes...
text: ECUs ON various parts of Nia’s face: eyes, ears, lips...
speaker_heading: CRAIG (V.0.)
dialog: But when you’ve got a really gorgeous
dialog: girl in front of you, and you’ve been
text: obsessing over her for two years, and
text: she’s biting her lip and talking low-
dialog: and you’re hard- what are you gonna do?
text: Back to Craig as the frame resumes action.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: You wanta see my room?
scene_heading: INT. CRAIG’S THREE NORTH BEDROOM
text: Craig leads Nia into his room, where by some miracle, Muqtada
text: seems to be gone. He places his artwork on the nightstand,
text: covers it with the blank Gates application.
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: You haven't finished that yet?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: What? Oh...
text: But before he can respond, Nia advances toward him. A brief
text: pause. They look each other over and then go at it like
text: teenagers, falling back onto Muqtada’s bed. Nia straddles
text: over Craig.
text: As they kiss, Craig reaches up Nia’s shirt. She moans.
text: Craig awkwardly moves his hand from one breast to the other.
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: Me and Aaron never did anything like
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: CRAIG (V.0.)
dialog: Don’t mention Aaron... Lalalalalalala.
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: This was totally on my checklist.
text: Aaron suddenly appears, lying in bed next to Craig and Nia,
text: swirling a snifter of Cognac. He wears a smoking jacket.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Are you seriously squeezing my
dialog: girlfriend's tit? Go easy, bro.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: (closing his eyes)
dialog: Lalalalalalalalala.....
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: What are you doing?
text: A toilet FLUSHES off-screen.
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: Is there someone in here?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I’m gonna be sick.
speaker_heading: MUQTADA (0.S.)
dialog: Sex!
text: Craig and Nia jerk their heads toward the front door, where
text: Muqtada is standing by the bathroom.
speaker_heading: MUQTADA
dialog: Sex in my bed!
text: BLAH! Craig vomits on the floor.
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: That is disgusting.
text: Nia pops out of bed, buttoning her shirt.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: MUQTADA
dialog: Children make sex in my bed!
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: Craig, who is this?
speaker_heading: MUQTADA
dialog: You terrible girl corrupt my friend!
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: This is my roommate, Muqtada.
speaker_heading: MUQTADA
dialog: Don’t talk to her! She try and make
dialog: sex in my bed!
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: Easy, Mookie, nobody was having sex.
text: Craig breathes and sweats heavily.
speaker_heading: MUQTADA
dialog: Woman is temptress! I know. Get out!
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: What’s wrong with you?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: He’s going through a hard time.
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: No, YOU! What’s wrong with you?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I’m also going through a hard time.
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: Get some sleep, Craig. I’11 call you
dialog: tomorrow.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Nia wait!
text: Craig tries to stop Nia, but gets tangled up with Muqtada.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Nia!
scene_heading: INT. THREE NORTH - EAST CORRIDOR
text: Craig rushes out of the room, sees Nia at the opposite end.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Wait, Nia!
dialog: (desperate)
dialog: I love you!
text: Nia looks back to Craig.
speaker_heading: NIA
dialog: Just get better, Craig.
text: At this point, Craig notices Noelle standing nearby, a pencil
text: sketch in her hand. His words echo in his head as he sees
text: how upset she looks.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: No, I mean--
text: Nia continues down the hall as Noelle crumples her sketch,
text: flings it at Craig, then takes off in the opposite direction.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Wait...
text: But they both keep going. Craig slumps to the floor, back
text: against the wall. After a beat, he grabs Noelle’s discarded
text: sketch, unfolds it.
text: INSERT: A beautifully detailed self-portrait of Noelle in
text: front of a mirror, titled “Under Pressure”.
text: Hold on Craig, moved by the sketch.
scene_heading: INT. HALL- OUTSIDE NOELLE’S ROOM - MINUTES LATER
text: Craig KNOCKS. And KNOCKS.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Noelle... Noelle, please... I love
dialog: your portrait. It’s amazing. I’m
dialog: sorry if I messed up. I wish you’d
dialog: open the door... You okay in there?
text: A piece of paper slides out from under the door. Craig picks
dialog: it up.
text: INSERT: a drawing of a penis-man with Craig’s name on it.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Oh... this is pretty cool too... So,
dialog: our meeting tonight... Is it fair to
dialog: assume that’s not happening?
dialog: No answer.
scene_heading: INT. CRAIG'S THREE NORTH BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER
text: Muqtada greets Craig.
speaker_heading: MUQTADA
dialog: Sorry, Craig. Are you okay?
text: Craig hands Muqtada the penis drawing.
speaker_heading: MUQTADA
dialog: Oh...

speaker_heading: CRAIG

speaker_heading: BOBBY

speaker_heading: CRAIG

speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I was wrong. It’s not the first time.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: (without emotion)
dialog: That’s great.
text: A beat, as Bobby looks Craig over.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: We missed you at breakfast, babe.
dialog: Smitty said your evaluation’s at six.
dialog: You ready?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: What do you think?
text: Craig rolls over, moans.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Is this about the whole Nia/Noelle
dialog: fiasco?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: How do you know about that?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Solomon. He has very sensitive
dialog: hearing. And FYI, don’t ever listen to
dialog: Johnny's girl advice. No sophisticated
dialog: woman would ever fall for that crap.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: It’s not just women. I can’t do
dialog: anything right... My life’s a mess.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No, my life is a mess... Mugtada’s life
dialog: is a mess. No offense, babe.
speaker_heading: MUQTADA
dialog: All good, papa.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Ordinarily I wouldn’t be in here
dialog: playing big brother Bob with you, but I
dialog: happen to like you, Craig. You remind

speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: BOBBY (cont'd)
dialog: I was much better looking, of course.
dialog: And I never had problems with women--
speaker_heading: MUQTADA
dialog: Get back on track, man.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: The point is, you’re sixteen years old.
dialog: Someday you won’t be. And in twenty
dialog: years, if you’re celebrating your
dialog: daughter’s eighth birthday in a place
dialog: like this, I swear to god Muqtada and I
dialog: are going to kick your ass... He not

text: Bobby heads for exit, but stops at the door.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Oh, and by the way-- I came in here to
dialog: tell you I’m not gonna be homeless
dialog: tomorrow. Just sayin’...
text: Craig stares at the door for a beat after Bobby leaves, still
dialog: processing it all.
speaker_heading: MUQTADA

text: tentatively, but Noelle remains stone-faced.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Thanks for coming.
dialog: No response.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: So, I just wanted to say, I’m really
dialog: sorry about yesterday. That girl you
dialog: saw me with... she was my best friend’s
dialog: girlfriend. I’ve been obsessed with
dialog: her forever--
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: --And you’re in love with her?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Of course not. But you think she’s

speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Um, I don’t think--
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: --and now you’re going to do the same
dialog: thing to me.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: No, I wasn’t.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: You weren't?
text: Noelle stares at him, waiting for what’s next. Craig thinks

text: After a confused beat, Noelle turns to go, but Craig grabs
text: her arm.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Okay, it’s true that I think you’re
dialog: hot. And I do want to say the right
dialog: thing, but only because I really like
dialog: you. I like that you don’t hide your
dialog: problems like everyone else. That you
dialog: wear them right there on your face...
dialog: And I feel like I don’t have to hide
dialog: mine when I’m with you.
text: Noelle manages a subtle smile. Encouraged, Craig continues.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I’ve been thinking a lot, and I
dialog: realized, you know, that, well... if
dialog: you’re not busy being born, then you’re
dialog: busy dying... and I think we could both
dialog: benefit from being born... again. Not
dialog: born again, but, you know?
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Gee, thanks for the wisdom, Bob.

dialog: Yeah, and about a billion other people.
dialog: It’s alright, Ma.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Bob Dylan. It’s the song you just
dialog: quoted.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: What? No.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Oh.
text: Noelle laughs. Craig smiles too.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Anyway, my point is... I wanta play
dialog: doctor with you.
text: She cocks her head, intrigued. Craig SNAPS his fingers,
text: smiles.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: What are you doing?
text: He SNAPS again, looks down the hall.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Where is he?
text: After a beat, a commotion erupts from the opposite end of the
text: hall, as Bobby streaks naked through the corridor, howling
text: like a mad man. The nurses leave their station to help
dialog: contain him.
text: Noelle cracks up, as Craig ducks into the utility closet,
text: snatches a pair of scrubs. They run off, sneaking through
dialog: the emergency exit.
text: Bobby notices Craig and Noelle escape, then stops running.
text: He smiles, as the nurses lead him away.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - ANOTHER FLOOR
text: Craig and Noelle (disguised as doctors) emerge from the
text: stairwell, blending into the crowd of doctors and patients.
scene_heading: INT. EMERGENCY ROOM
text: Craig and Noelle stroll past EMERGENCY PATIENTS. When they
text: see a SECURITY GUARD approaching from the opposite direction,
text: they quickly attend to the nearest patient, an old CHINESE
text: MAN. Craig rubs his head.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Does this hurt?
text: Noelle massages his feet.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: How about this?
text: The guard passes without suspicion, so Craig and Noelle take
text: off, leaving the Chinese man very confused.
scene_heading: INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR
text: Craig and Noelle jog down the hall, turn a corner to find...
text: ...-Dr. Minerva and her posse of interns coming towards them.
text: Craig and Noelle put on the brakes and scramble in the other
dialog: direction.
scene_heading: INT. INNER STAIRWELL
text: They race up the stairs, find an exit door, and emerge out
dialog: onto...
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL ROOFTOP
text: ..-where the setting sun casts a fiery red glow on the
text: Brooklyn rooftops. They take a beat to admire the Manhattan
text: skyline and Brooklyn Bridge below.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: This is amazing.
text: Craig looks at Noelle, reaches out, and touches her face.
text: She doesn’t move.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: You're not a cut fetishist, are you?
text: Craig removes his hand.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: What? No.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Good. Those guys are so creepy.
text: Craig smiles and they look out in silence.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: How come you never asked me why?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Why what?
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Why I did it.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I guess I figured you’d tell me when
dialog: you wanted me to know.
text: Noelle smiles, nods.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Thanks.
text: After a beat, Craig summons his courage.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Um... do you like music?
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Um, yeah. Do you like breathing?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Oh, right. Dumb question.
text: Sensing his discomfort, Noelle lightens up.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: I like Radiohead, Pixies, T Rex... What
dialog: else...
text: Craig nods. They sit in awkward silence, until...
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Have you seen them live?
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: I’ve seen Radiohead and the Pixies.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Cool... So... Um...
speaker_heading: NOELLE
text: Vampire Weekend's playing a show at the
dialog: end of the month.
text: Noelle pauses, giving him another chance. Craig just nods.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: You wanta go?
text: Craig smiles, an enormous weight has been lifted.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Yes! I would. With you?
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: No, with Smitty. Yes with me.
text: They both continue to smile and look out over the sunset,
text: until Noelle leans over, kisses Craig on the cheek, and we
dialog: FREEZE mid-kiss--
speaker_heading: CRAIG (V.0.)
dialog: Sorry guys... This is about to get
dialog: pretty sappy, so I’m just gonna give
dialog: you the highlights.
text: As Craig speaks in VO, we see various postcard-like stills
text: presented as a slide-show presentation.
speaker_heading: CRAIG (V.0.)
dialog: This is me sharing the realization that
dialog: I don’t actually want to be a CEO,
dialog: lawyer, or President.
text: CLICK to the next slide of Noelle, mid-cackle.
speaker_heading: CLICK to
speaker_heading: CLICK to
speaker_heading: CLICK to
speaker_heading: CLICK to
speaker_heading: CLICK to
speaker_heading: CLICK to
dialog: out over
speaker_heading: CRAIG (V.0.)
text: This is Noelle, laughing at the idea
dialog: that I once wanted to be President.
text: Noelle giving the world the finger.
speaker_heading: CRAIG (V.0.)
dialog: Here, Noelle suggests I “screw” the
dialog: Gates Summer application if it makes me
dialog: so unhappy.
text: next slide of Craig, smiling.
speaker_heading: CRAIG (V.0.)
dialog: This is me liking that idea.
text: Craig, no longer smiling.
speaker_heading: CRAIG (V.0.)
dialog: This is me thinking about how to tell
dialog: my dad.
text: Noelle, blushing.
speaker_heading: CRAIG (V.0.)
dialog: This is after I tell Noelle how
dialog: wonderful and beautiful she is.
text: Craig and Noelle kissing.
speaker_heading: CRAIG (V.0.)
dialog: Oops. How'd that get in there?
text: Noelle’s head on Craig’s shoulder, as they both look
text: the sunset. Postcard text appears on screen:
text: GREETINGS FROM ARGENON HOSPITAL.
scene_heading: INT. DR. MINERVA’S OFFICE
text: Back in normal attire, Craig sits across from Dr. Minerva.
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: How are you feeling?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I was having kind of a bad day. I
dialog: missed dinner and breakfast.
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I think I was probably just feeling
text: scared about leaving.
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: What scares you about leaving?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: There are a lot more things to stress
text: about on the outside.
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: Are you still having suicidal thoughts?
text: Craig shakes his head, no.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: It’s like... there are so many people,
dialog: not just in this hospital, but in the
dialog: whole world, ya know, who are
dialog: struggling so hard to live. And it
dialog: seems like, self-indulgent, for me not
dialog: to appreciate what I have.
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Well, there’s my family, my home...
dialog: and my friends... This girl. You know
dialog: Noelle?
text: Dr. Minerva raises her eyebrows.
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: Noelle? She’s the spunky one.
text: Craig blushes slightly. Did she just call his girlfriend
dialog: “spunky”?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Oh, and this...
text: Craig reaches into his pocket, unfolds one of his brain maps.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I always thought art was just bourgeois
dialog: decadence, but...
text: He hands the drawing to Dr. Minerva who looks it over.
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: It’s really wonderful, Craig.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Thanks. I did about twenty of them.
dialog: It’s something I really enjoy.
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: What do you enjoy about it?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: It’s fun. And it takes my mind off the
dialog: stuff that stresses me out.
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: Is this something you plan to continue
dialog: when you leave?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Yeah, maybe, but my Dad might freak.
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: Have you told him how you feel?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Not yet.
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: But you will.
text: Craig nods.
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I don’t know. As soon as I see him, I
dialog: guess.
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: And if he freaks?
text: Craig thinks it over, smiles.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Better him than me.
text: Dr. Minerva laughs.
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: That’s going to be the challenge... You
dialog: ready?
text: Craig nods.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I think so. How am I doing? With the
dialog: evaluation.
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: Oh. Well, Craig... We've only just
dialog: begun. The evaluation consists of
dialog: three parts. There’s still the
dialog: multiple choice section and a personal
dialog: essay explaining why we should let you
dialog: go...
text: Craig stares at Dr. Minerva in shock.
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: What? Doctors can’t make jokes too?
text: Craig exhales in relief.
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: You can leave first thing in the
dialog: morning...
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Thank you.
scene_heading: DR. MINERVA
dialog: You should stop by and say hi sometime.
dialog: You know, we have a volunteer program
dialog: with the local high schools. You could
dialog: help others who are going through the
dialog: same thing.
text: Craig thinks it over, smiles and nods.
scene_heading: INT. NURSES’ STATION - NIGHT
text: Craig approaches Smitty, carrying the doctors’ scrubs.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Tonight’s my last night, Smitty.
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: Congratulations. We’1ll miss you, Craig.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: And Bobby’s too. You think we can have
dialog: a pizza party?
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: Sure, if you can get the money.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: How many pizzas do you think we need?
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: Well, we've got thirty patients and
dialog: five staff, but that’s including
dialog: Muqtada and the anorexics, so... seven
dialog: pies should do.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: (handing over the scrubs)
dialog: Cool. Oh, I found these down over
dialog: there somewhere.
text: Smitty examines the scrubs, watches Craig go.
scene_heading: INT. NORTH CORRIDOR COMMUNITY PHONE
text: Craig speaks into it.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Yeah, seven large pies. All kinds...
dialog: Just tell them to send the delivery guy
text: to the third floor, Three North.
dialog: Thanks, Dad. I’‘11 see you and mom
dialog: tomorrow.
text: Craig hangs up, looks down the hall, where...
text: ..-Mugtada is peeking out their bedroom door. Craig waves,
text: but Muqtada just disappears back inside.
text: Craig thinks for a beat, then picks up the phone again.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Hey, man... I could really use a favor.
scene_heading: INT. THREE NORTH - WAITING AREA - NIGHT
text: With a completed stack of art beside him, Craig puts the
text: finishing touches on a new brain map.
text: Craig looks up as the security guard buzzes open the Three
text: North entrance doors, and George enters with six large
dialog: pizzas.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Hey dad, I wasn’t expecting you in
dialog: person.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I left work early. Thought it was more
dialog: important to be here.
text: Craig nods.
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: (approaching)
dialog: Mr. Gilner, thank you so much! Three
dialog: North loves you tonight...
dialog: (to Craig)
dialog: See ya back there in a jiff?
text: Smitty takes the pizzas from George, heads toward the dining
dialog: hall.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (ve: brain maps)
dialog: Whatcha got there?
text: Craig hands George the stack of brain maps. George looks
text: through them. After a beat, he smiles.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You did these? Very nice.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Thanks. I’ve been doing a lot of art
dialog: in here, and it’s, um, actually... it’s
dialog: something I’d like to continue.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh. That’s good.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Like, maybe, take a class this summer.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What about the Gates program?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: It’s not for me.
text: Solomon runs by them, holding up his pants.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Craig! Have you heard about the pizza
dialog: tonight?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Yeah, I’1l be there in a minute, Sol.
text: George takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Art's a wonderful hobby, but why don’t
dialog: you hold off on any big decisions until
dialog: you’ve gotten home, had some time to
dialog: clear your head?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: What do you think I’ve been doing here
dialog: all week? I’ve thought a lot about it--
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I’m just saying, let’s not close off
dialog: your options. This could be very
dialog: important for your future.
text: Craig looks at George for a beat, disappointed.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: What about now? I’m sixteen years old.
dialog: Can’t I start worrying like an adult
dialog: when I become one?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: When I was your age--
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Dad! I know you’re just trying to
dialog: help, but you really stress me out
dialog: sometimes. And that’s part of the
dialog: reason I’m here.
text: George takes this in. After a beat.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: But after I leave tomorrow, I don’t
dialog: ever want to have to come back.
text: George nods, understanding the weight of this.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Thanks for getting here and getting
dialog: help.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Do you wanna come grab a slice with me?
dialog: Meet some people?
scene_heading: INT. REC ROOM - MINUTES LATER
text: Craig and George step into the room, where the patients chow
text: down on pizza. Craig spots Noelle, leads George to her.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Noelle, this is my dad. George.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Hi George. So what are you in for?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: She’s kidding, dad.
text: George smiles and they shake hands, as Johnny steps by.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Hey, Johnny, meet my Dad.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Yo, thanks for the pies, Mr. G.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No problem... Johnny.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: (to Johnny)
dialog: Hey, have you seen Bobby?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Not since lunch.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (looking off-screen)
dialog: Oh, is that...
text: Johnny and Craig follow George’s eyeline to the ping-pong
text: table across the room.
scene_heading: INT. REC ROOM - A LITTLE LATER
text: Craig and Johnny play doubles ping-pong vs. George and
text: Noelle. His sleeves rolled, George plays like he’s known
dialog: everybody for years.
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: Hey Craig, you have another visitor.
scene_heading: INT. THREE NORTH - WAITING AREA
text: Craig comes out to find Aaron texting on his phone. When he
text: sees Craig, he hands him a flat brown paper bag.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I found it. I must have lent out the
dialog: first two volumes. But here's the
dialog: third.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I so appreciate this.
dialog: No problem..
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: - Look, man, I’m sorry I
dialog: was a bitch to you.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I’m sorry I tried to make out with your
dialog: girlfriend.
text: Aaron and Craig nod at each other for an awkward beat.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: How are things with Nia?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: We're gonna try to work through it.
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: You know, I might hide it pretty well,
dialog: but I get that depression stuff too,
dialog: sometimes.
dialog: Yeah?
text: Aaron nods.
dialog: Don’t kill
dialog: I won't.
dialog: Seriously.
dialog: Thanks.
text: Craig holds out his
text: it into a hug.
text: Aaron heads for the
speaker_heading: CRAIG
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: yourself, okay?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
speaker_heading: AARON
speaker_heading: CRAIG
text: hand for Aaron to slap, but Aaron turns
text: exit, but pauses one last time.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Did you really try to make out with
dialog: Nia?
text: Craig smiles and shrugs.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: (with a smile)
dialog: Dick.
text: Aaron exits and Craig heads back toward the party, but stops
dialog: when--
speaker_heading: NURES MONICA
dialog: Craig... You left your drawings here
dialog: earlier.
text: Monica hands the stack to Craig, who looks closely at the one
text: on top: a custom drawn brain map that says “Bobby” at the
dialog: bottom.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Thanks Monica.
scene_heading: INT. BOBBY’S ROOM
text: Craig peeks inside the room to find Bobby staring at the
text: floor in the corner.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Pizza's getting cold. What’s up?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Feeling pretty tired, think I’m gonna
dialog: skip the pizza tonight. Just packing
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: So, vacation’s over...
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yup. Back to work.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: You got a job?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Nope.
text: Beat. Craig shifts.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: You know, I used your Dylan line on
dialog: Noelle.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: How'd it go?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Good. We’re gonna hang out soon. See
text: some music.
text: Bobby smiles. Craig steps in, hands him a brain map.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Here. It’s you.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yikes. It’s a mess in there.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: It’s not such a mess. It’s just
dialog: undergoing renovations.
text: Bobby smiles.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I wrote my number on the back... let’s
dialog: get together sometime... play some
dialog: table tennis.
text: Bobby thinks for a long beat, knowing this won’t happen.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Cool... So I’1l see you at breakfast
dialog: tomorrow.
text: Bobby nods. Craig starts to leave when...
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Good luck, Craig.Not that you’1l need
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Thanks. You too, babe.
text: They both smile and Craig exits.
scene_heading: INT. REC ROOM - MINUTES LATER
text: Craig enters to find everyone chowing down on pizzas and
text: rocking out to Smitty’s funk records.
text: He smiles to himself, noticing George, now teamed-up with the
text: Professor, continuing to dominate other patients at the ping-
dialog: pong table.
text: Craig approaches Smitty and hands him the paper bag that
dialog: Aaron brought.
text: Smitty removes an album from the bag: EGYPTIAN MASTERS:
text: VOLUME 3. Smitty glances to Craig, and shakes his head.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Trust me.
text: Smitty makes a face, but goes to the record player anyway.
text: The music cuts out mid-song, and some of the patients begin
text: to grumble.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Just wait...
text: The Egyptian Masters album soars into play.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Is this a joke?
speaker_heading: HUMBLE
dialog: Hey, I like this. Yeah!
text: Humble moves to the music.
speaker_heading: BECCA
dialog: Look!
text: Becca points to the rec room entrance, where...
text: ..-Mugtada is swaying to the rhythm, and tapping his feet.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Hey, Muqtada, join the party!
text: Everyone gets down, and dances to the Egyptian Masters with
text: Muqtada at the helm.
text: Near the rec room entrance, Bobby emerges in the doorway,
text: observes for a quiet beat. He watches as...
text: ...Craig heads over to Noelle in the corner. She smiles to
text: Craig, wiggles her hips to the unusual music. They laugh,
text: and Craig joins her in a little dance.
text: Bobby smiles to himself and slowly backs out of the room.
scene_heading: TITLE OVER BLACK: “FRIDAY”
scene_heading: INT. THREE NORTH - EAST CORRIDOR - DAY
text: From the opposite end, Craig advances through the corridor
text: with his duffel bag and a stack of brain maps. He passes...
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Good luck, buddy.
speaker_heading: HUMBLE
dialog: You should really stay longer; you
dialog: might lose it on the outside.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I‘1l take my chances.
text: Jimmy strolls by in the other direction.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: It’1l come to ya!
text: Craig continues, passing patients and staff, saying his
dialog: goodbyes.
speaker_heading: CRAIG (V.0.)
dialog: Okay, I know you’re thinking, “What is
dialog: this? Kid spends a few days in the
dialog: hospital and all his problems are
dialog: cured?” But I’m not. I know I’m not.
dialog: I feel how easily I could fall back
dialog: into it, lie down and not eat, look at
dialog: my homework and freak out, look at Nia
dialog: and be jealous...
text: Smitty approaches, gives Craig his cell phone, keys, and
text: shoelaces.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Thanks, Smitty. Have you seen Bobby?
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: He already left. Early this morning.
text: At first disappointed, Craig forms a slight smile.
speaker_heading: CRAIG (V.0.)
dialog: But the difference between today and
dialog: last Saturday is that giving up just
dialog: isn’t an option anymore.
text: Craig sees Noelle, his face brightens.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: How do you feel?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I feel like I can handle it.
speaker_heading: LYNN (0.S.)
dialog: Craig?
text: They turn toward Lynn and George in the waiting area.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Wanta meet my mom?
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: You really move fast, don’t you?
text: Craig’s parents approach.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Hey mom, this is Noelle.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: A pleasure to meet you.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: You too.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hey Noelle.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Hey George. Did you have fun last
dialog: night?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I haven't partied like that since 1999.
text: Craig rolls his eyes. Noelle smiles.
speaker_heading: NOELLE
dialog: Well, I’1l let you go. Nice to meet
dialog: you all.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: See you next week.
text: Noelle smiles and struts off.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (to George)
dialog: What exactly went on here last night?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Sorry, honey, what happens in Three
text: North stays in Three North.
text: Lynn elbows George.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Guys, can you go home without me and
dialog: I’‘1l meet you back there in a few
dialog: minutes?
dialog: Alaa
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Why? Are you okay?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I'm fine. I just want to ride my bike
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Sure. We'll take your stuff. But
dialog: hurry up; Alyssa baked you cookies.
text: Lynn kisses Craig on the forehead.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: See you in a few minutes.
text: Lynn and George walk towards the elevator. Craig watches
text: them for a beat, then glances back for one last look at Three
dialog: North, sees...
text: ..-Mugtada, out of his room again, chatting with Solomon.
scene_heading: EXT. ARGENON HOSPITAL - DAY
text: Craig steps out into the brisk spring air with the other
text: PEDESTRIANS, COMMUTERS, and HOSPITAL LOITERERS. He goes to
text: the bike rack, bends down and swirls the number rings to his
dialog: combination.
speaker_heading: CRAIG (V.0.)
dialog: I know something’s changing in me. It
dialog: might not be dramatic, but it’s real.
dialog: And for the first time in a while, I
dialog: can look forward to things I want to do
dialog: in my life...
text: Craig smiles into the camera.
text: The following rapid-fire sequence takes us through Alaa
text: wildly stylized images that correspond with Craig’s stream-of-
text: consciousness voice over...
speaker_heading: CRAIG (V.0.)
dialog: Bike. Eat. Drink. Talk. Ride the
dialog: subway. Read. Read maps. Make maps.
dialog: Make art. Have a party. Hug my mom.
dialog: Kiss my dad. Kiss my little sister.
dialog: Make out with Noelle. Make out with her
dialog: more. Take her on a picnic. See a movie
dialog: with her. See a movie with Aaron. Heck,
dialog: see a movie with Nia. Tell people my
dialog: story. Volunteer at Three North. Help
dialog: people like Bobby. Like Mugtada. Like
dialog: me. Draw more. Draw a person.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: CRAIG (V.O.) (cont'd)
dialog: Draw a naked person. Draw Noelle naked.
dialog: Run. Travel. Swim. Skip. I know it’s

text: Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Live.
text: BACK TO CRAIG ON THE STREET
text: He’s biking full speed. We TRACK with him for several beats,
