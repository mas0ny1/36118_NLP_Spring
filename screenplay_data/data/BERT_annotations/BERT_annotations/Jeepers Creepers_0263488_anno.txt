scene_heading: EXT. LONELY COUNTRY ROAD. DAY.
text: An empty ribbon of asphalt. Winding through an endless
text: stretch of meadows and farmlands. For a long moment, silence.
text: Then, a distant speck. A car moving toward us.
text: A SOUND APPROACHING WITH IT NOW. A RADIO BLARING AND TWO
text: RAISED VOICES SINGING WITH IT.
text: TRISHA JAMES is a beautiful girl of twenty. Hair blowing in
text: the breeze of the open passenger window. She sings out,
text: banging the side of the car with her hand. Keeping the beat
text: of the boisterous rock song.
text: She sings with younger brother DARRY. Nineteen. Attractive
text: like his sister. Lighter hair. Softer looking. Striking eyes.
text: Voice raised as they speed along. Trying to swallow up the
dialog: road as quickly as possible.
text: The backseat has a couple of suitcases and a large basket
text: wrapped in a garbage bag. The song comes to an end as Darry
text: flies through an abandoned intersection.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: That was a stop sign.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: You're kidding, right?
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: In your car I'd be kidding.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: You think we're actually gonna
dialog: run into anyone else on this
dialog: road? Relax!
dialog: (turns the radio louder,
dialog: shouts over it)
dialog: Enjoy the countryside!
text: The ANGRY MUSIC WAILING and the car blasting down the
text: tranquil road. We watch as it heads for what seems like
dialog: infinity.
scene_heading: EXT. LONELY COUNTRY ROAD. DAY. SOME TIME LATER.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Okay, here comes...
text: Trish and Darry slowing down now. Coming up on a
text: camper/trailer. Brother and sister stare at the license
dialog: plate:
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 2
speaker_heading: DARRY (cont'd)
dialog: (reads it loudly)
dialog: "Six A Forever!"
dialog: (grins)
dialog: That's mine! That's five to
text: five. Tied up.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: What does it mean?
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: "Six A Forever" what does it
dialog: mean?
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: ‘Cause it says "Sexy Forever",
dialog: stupid, that's mine. That's
dialog: five to four.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Since when did you start ace-
dialog: ing me at this game?
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Since you were ten. It
dialog: involves English and reading.
text: Darry guns the engine. Goes into the oncoming lane to pass
dialog: the camper/trailer.
speaker_heading: TRISH (cont'd)
dialog: Come on, Darry.
text: They pass the cab of the truck. An OLD MAN of sixty behind
text: the wheel. His WIFE next to him. He glares down at Trish and
text: Darry as they pass him.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Sexy forever huh?
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: You know that is you in forty
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Note to self: Die young.
dialog: (checks his rearview)
dialog: Any place but here on this
text: unbelievably endless road.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 3
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: You wanna be sucking in
text: exhaust fumes on the
dialog: Interstate?
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: No I love stopping at train
dialog: tracks every ten minutes.
text: No further comment from big sister. She's suddenly some place
dialog: else.
speaker_heading: DARRY (cont'd)
dialog: You know there's usually a
dialog: reason when you like the long
dialog: way home.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Gee like, maybe I like the
dialog: country?
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: (mocking sincerity)
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Just drive, brat.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: I'm only thinking the same
dialog: thing mom and dad are gonna be
dialog: thinking: how come you're
dialog: driving home for Spring break
dialog: with baby brother?
text: Not heading off somewhere with
dialog: "Mr .Poly-Sci-Track-Team-Guy"?
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: And I'11 tell you what I'd
dialog: tell them: none of your
dialog: Goddamned business-
text: WOOOONNNNKKKKKK! !!!! A DARK VAN HAS SUDDENLY LURCHED BEHIND
text: THEM BLARING ITS HORN.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: (swerves a little)
dialog: Jesus!
text: The van is tailgating them at an alarming velocity. Rattling
text: and shimmying it is so old and distressed.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 4
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Darry!
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: What's this guy trying to do?!
text: He tries to find the driver in the rearview. The Van's
text: windshield is heavily tinted.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Just get out of his way!
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: He's nuts!
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: (emphatically)
dialog: Get out of his way, Darry!
text: Darry swerves into the oncoming lane and the van tears
text: forward. Blasting toward the distant horizon.
text: Both brother and sister watch breathless. Catching its
text: rusting and personalized license plate:
speaker_heading: TRISH (cont'd)
dialog: Jesus!
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: (back in the right lane)
dialog: Shit!
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: What the Hell is his problem?
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: My first guess: inbreeding!
text: He has shouted this last word out the window toward the
text: distant van.
speaker_heading: DARRY (cont'd)
dialog: Get a load of that thing?
dialog: Vehicle of choice for five out
dialog: of ten serial killers.
text: Brother and sister still trying to catch their breath as the
text: van disappears over a distant rise.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: God you know what I just
dialog: thought of, right?
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS
speaker_heading: DARRY
text: Kenny and Darla.
dialog: (off Trish's nod)
dialog: They died about a hundred
dialog: miles from here.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: It was the same highway.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: This highway runs the length
dialog: of the State.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: You think it really happened?
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: That they had to go looking
dialog: for her head?
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: No that they never found her.
dialog: Or him. They only found the
dialog: car.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: No, they never found her head.
dialog: They found the car but they
text: couldn't find him or her head.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Look at me...
dialog: (holds out her hand)
dialog: I'm still shaking.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: You don't think every
dialog: generation has their
dialog: cautionary tale of drinking
dialog: and driving on Prom Night?
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: I always heard it was real.
dialog: That they were Class of '80.
dialog: After I heard that story, I
dialog: used to think this was the
dialog: highway I_ would die on.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Quite the cheery thinker,
dialog: today. What did "Poly-sci guy
dialog: do to you anyway?
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 6
text: She isn't listening. Thoughts elsewhere again.
speaker_heading: DARRY (cont'd)
dialog: “Beating you"
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: That was the license plate on
scene_heading: the van: B-E-A-T-N-G-U".
dialog: (turns to her)
dialog: “Beating you", that's five to
dialog: five. That ties us up.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: You can't call it now.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: My ass...
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: You have to call it when you
dialog: see it!
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: I was in shock!
text: THE JANGLING BELLS OF A RAILROAD CROSSING AHEAD.
speaker_heading: DARRY (cont'd)
dialog: You know I don't remember
dialog: there being so many rules to
dialog: this game.
text: Trish and Darry slowing as the bells ring and the bars lower.
speaker_heading: DARRY (cont'd)
dialog: ‘Course when there was, you
dialog: were the one making ‘em.
dialog: Little Miss Junior Nazi with
dialog: the Barbie Doll and the Easy
dialog: Bake Oven...
text: Darry looks down the tracks. Sees the small cargo train
text: approaching. Revs the engine.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Don't you dare.
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: My car.
text: Trish sniffs. Smells something. Looks in the backseat. The
text: big thing covered in a trash bag. She lifts the plastic: a
text: full laundry basket.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 7
speaker_heading: TRISH (cont'd)
dialog: You are a class act, you know
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Hey you live off campus.
dialog: (she just stares at him)
dialog: You ever try and do laundry in
dialog: a dorm? What they don't steal
dialog: they dye pink for you. I've
dialog: got twelve pair of rosey-pink
dialog: jockey shorts.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Maybe they know something
dialog: about you, you don't.
text: She takes the Deodorizer hanging off the rearview mirror and
text: stuffs it in the bag.
speaker_heading: TRISH (cont'd)
dialog: Hi mom, haven't seen you
dialog: forever, here's my dirty
dialog: shorts.
text: The train is upon them now. He shouts over the din.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Its for her, not me. I have to
dialog: bring home laundry. I don't,
dialog: she gets depressed. Like she
dialog: thinks I don't need her
dialog: anymore or something.
text: Trish's look says she isn't buying it. The SHORT TRAIN ROARS
text: PAST. Leaves the car waiting for bells to stop and the bars
dialog: to rise.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: You talk to her lately?
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: To tell her I'd be home for
dialog: break.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: She sound like anything was
dialog: going on?
text: Darry throws her a look.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: (impatient)
dialog: Did you listen to her voice?
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 8
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Specify please.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: I think maybe something's
dialog: wrong.
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: I don't think they're telling
dialog: us.
dialog: (off his continued look)
dialog: Like you would notice anything
dialog: past the point of your own
dialog: selfish little existence.
text: The bars go up and the car flies over the tracks. Continues
text: its trek down the two-lane.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: If mom and dad were gonna get
dialog: a divorce don't you think
dialog: they'd have done it by now?
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: No I think they would've
dialog: waited till we were both grown
text: and off at school.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Whatever.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: She's not happy. Not even a
dialog: little bit. Not like she used
dialog: to be.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Who is?
dialog: (spots something)
dialog: Hey...
text: They are driving past an old abandoned church set back from
dialog: the road.
speaker_heading: DARRY (cont'd)
dialog: You see it?
text: Her sister peers past him. In the church's side yard, the old
text: van is parked. The one that almost ran them off the road.
speaker_heading: DARRY (cont'd)
dialog: It's "Beating You".
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: What's he doing?
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 9
text: But what they both see now is something much more ominous:
text: A tall, dark figure dropping something large and oblong down
text: an old drainage pipe in the back of the church.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: What the Hell is that...
text: The oblong object is gone in an instant. Swallowed up by the
text: large mouth of the old protruding pipe.
text: The kid's view blocked now by the church.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Don't slow down!
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: You think he saw us?
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: What the Hell was he doing?
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: He dumped something down that
dialog: pipe.
speaker_heading: TRISH
text: Wrapped in a sheet.
speaker_heading: DARRY
text: Wrapped and roped in a sheet.
speaker_heading: TRISH
text: Wrapped and roped in a sheet
text: with red stains on it.
text: Both of them study the rearview mirror now.
speaker_heading: TRISH (cont'd)
dialog: Vehicle of choice for five out
dialog: of ten what?
text: Darry guns the engine.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: I don't think he saw us.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Don't get us killed.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: You see him?
text: Both watch the old church get smaller in their view.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 10
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Nope.
text: Someone appears high on the old roof. Standing next to the
text: sagging steeple.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: What the-
text: Appears so suddenly it could almost be the Figure had leapt
dialog: up there.
text: Darry stares at this, perplexed.
speaker_heading: DARRY (cont'd)
dialog: You see that?
text: She hasn't. Just the distant figure on the roof, looking
text: after them. Some kind of long coat flapping in the wind like
text: a cape.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Just get us out of here Darry!
text: The figure drops from view as quickly as he appeared.
text: A glance between brother and sister and Darry increases speed.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Grab my cell phone!
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: In the gym bag!
text: Trish starts rummaging. Finds the cell phone. Flips it open.
text: Powers it up. Staring back at the church.
text: THE PHONE GIVES OUT A LOW BATTERY ALERT.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: The point of having a portable
dialog: phone idiot, is so that it
dialog: works when you need it.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: I have a power cable for it!
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: (stuffs the phone back in
dialog: the bag)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 11
speaker_heading: TRISH (cont'd)
dialog: And I have a cigarette lighter
dialog: that doesn't work!
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: I told you we shoulda’ taken
dialog: my car!
text: Trish pales. Staring out the back.
text: In the distance the dark van is now leaving the old church
text: and taking the road again.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Oh Jesus...
text: Heading toward them.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: (in the rearview)
dialog: You gotta be kidding me...
text: THEY CAN HEAR THE VAN'S DISTANT ENGINE BEING GUNNED....
text: Darry floors it, the little car ripping down the highway as
text: the old van swoops after it -looking like a dark bird of
dialog: prey.
text: Darry staring down at the speedometer. He's up to ninety and
text: the little car is starting to shake.
text: Darry checks the rearview mirror. The van still gaining.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: What the Hell's he got in that
dialog: thing? He's got it suped up or
dialog: something-
text: The car speeds down the two lane trying desperately to keep distance,
text: but the van continues to gain -SCREAMING TOWARD THEM.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Darry!!! He's right on our
dialog: ass!!!
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: I can see him!
text: The van is only a few yards from them now. Darry's foot
text: slamming the pedal to the metal.
text: He and she staring back at the van's tinted windshield.
text: Glints in the sun. No driver can be seen.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 12
speaker_heading: DARRY (cont'd)
dialog: Hang on-
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Darry-
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: I'm gonna try something.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Darry don't kill us...
text: He is staring up ahead at a gravel road that shoots sharply
text: off the highway.
text: Just as the van lurches up to their rear bumper -its dark
text: face and grill filling the rear and sideview mirrors.
speaker_heading: TRISH (cont'd)
dialog: Darry what're you doing?
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Jesus Christ-
text: BAM! THE VAN SLAMS THE BACK OF THE CAR.
text: At its top speed, the car shimmies and shakes. Darry weaves
text: in and out of the oncoming lane several times before
text: regaining control.
speaker_heading: DARRY (cont'd)
dialog: I don't believe this-
text: WOOOONNNNKKKKKK! !!!! THE HORN FROM THE VAN BLARES -but it is
text: a sound they have never heard come from an auto before.
text: This could almost be the deep, guttural sound of a wailing
dialog: beast.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: What the Hell does he want?!
dialog: (screaming out the back)
dialog: Are you out of your fucking
dialog: mind?!!!
text: WHAM! The van hits the back of the sedan again.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Christ!
text: Darry almost in tears. Trying desperately to control the car
text: as it crosses the oncoming lane and roughly lurches onto the
dialog: dirt shoulder.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 13
text: The sedan shakes violently as Darry tries to get it back onto
dialog: asphalt again.
text: His sister screams -a big ditch dead ahead. Darry grapples
text: the wheel and as the sedan spits up dirt, he swings the car
text: back onto asphalt again.
text: The van tails them across the oncoming lane and back across
dialog: the highway.
text: WOOOONNNKKKKK! !! THE STRANGE, BRUTAL HORN WAILS AGAIN.
text: Darry is almost up to the gravel road that shoots off the two
dialog: lane.
speaker_heading: DARRY (cont'd)
dialog: Hang on!
text: Trish just stares at her brother. The boy is shaken. Eyes
text: full of fear. She looks back at the van. It is charging ahead
text: at them again.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: What the fuck is the matter
dialog: with you?!!!!
text: WHAMM!!! Struck again from behind -Darry really loses
text: control. Tries to swing onto the gravel roadway -but leaves
text: the two lane at a terrifying speed, unable to negotiate the
text: sharp turn.
text: Blasting through a wooden fence and into an open field.
text: Darry slams on his brakes as they rocket into tall grass.
text: The windshield is whipped with grass as the car's brakes lock
text: up and the vehicle continues to fly forward.
text: A cloud of birds flutters out of the deep grass in front of
text: them as inside the car, brother and sister are tossed around
text: like ragdolls.
text: Trish trying desperately to fasten her seatbelt. Darry just
text: leaning into that brake.
speaker_heading: TRISH (cont'd)
dialog: Goddammitt!!!
text: The car swings around and stops. Jostling to a halt in some
text: even taller grass and bringing a sudden and eerie silence.
text: Only the breathing of brother and sister can be heard inside
dialog: the car.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 14
text: That and the sound of the van's engine pounding away in the
dialog: distance.
text: Out Trish's dirtied window, she can see the highway through
text: the grass. She and Darry stare out.
text: The old van is not even slowing. Continuing at its terrifying
text: speed down the two lane.
text: Brother and sister staring after it. Breathless as it
text: disappears in the distance.
text: They look at each other. Both seem to be intact. Without a
text: word, Darry opens the car door. In some kind of shock. Takes
text: a step out.
text: ANOTHER GAGGLE OF BIRDS SUDDENLY FLAPPING THEIR WINGS.
text: Blasting out from deep grass beyond Darry. Scares the shit
text: out of him.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: You fuckers!
text: Picks up a rock. Throws it at their ascending cloud. Needs to
text: take out his anger and frustration. Picks up another one.
text: Looks over at his sister.
text: Trish is standing now, staring out at the highway. The van
dialog: long gone.
speaker_heading: DARRY (cont'd)
dialog: Still like the country?
text: She turns and looks at him.
speaker_heading: DARRY (cont'd)
dialog: The next time Poly-Sci guy
dialog: pisses you off I'm gonna kick
dialog: his fucking ass!
text: Trish just looks at the car, surrounded by the tall grass.
scene_heading: EXT. GRAVEL ROAD. DAY. MINUTES LATER.
text: Dirtied and scraped, the small car emerges slowly from the
text: tall grass. Trish behind the wheel now. Darry looking out the
text: passenger window.
text: They back out of the field. Through the opening in the wooden
text: fence that they made going in. Roll the car onto the gravel
dialog: drive.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 15
text: Pointed again toward the highway, Trish guns the engine but
text: doesn't move. Looks to her brother.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Sounds alright, I guess.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Like either of us would know.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: (defending his manhood)
dialog: I know a little.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: When your car makes a strange
dialog: noise you just buy a new tape
dialog: Darry, that's what you told
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Told you? I learned it from
dialog: you!
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Asshole.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Bitch.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Mama's boy.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Daddy's whore.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Dick Licker.
speaker_heading: DARRY
text: Ball sniffer.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Ass kisser.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Butt picker.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Hah! Repeat! Ass and butt! You
dialog: lose.
text: Looks over at Trish and smiles. She too. They need a smile
dialog: about now.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 16
text: Trish rolls to the end of the gravel drive. Stops at the
text: highway. Looks both ways. Darry's hand on the wheel suddenly.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: I'm thinking past the point of
dialog: my own selfish little
dialog: existence now, okay?
dialog: What if that really was a
dialog: person he dumped down that
dialog: pipe? What if it was someone
dialog: still alive?
text: Trish just stares at her brother.
speaker_heading: DARRY (cont'd)
dialog: Someone who needs help but
dialog: doesn't get it. Or doesn't get
text: it ‘till it's too late.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: We can get help just as fast
dialog: by getting to a phone-
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: You know how far we are from
dialog: the nearest pay phone?
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Is this your idea of an
dialog: adventure or something? 'Cause
dialog: this is why girls are smarter,
dialog: okay?
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Hey we almost got killed! You
dialog: don't wanna even find out
dialog: why?!
dialog: She isn't wanting or liking this.
speaker_heading: DARRY (cont'd)
dialog: We look in the pipe. That's
dialog: all we do.
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: We look in the pipe and if
dialog: there's nothing there or
dialog: nothing we can do, we just
dialog: drive on home and call the
dialog: cops.
text: Trish stares unwilling.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 17
speaker_heading: DARRY (cont'd)
dialog: You know I'm right.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Bullshit I do!
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Look me straight in the eye
dialog: and tell me I'm not right.
text: She won't look at him. He knows he has her now.
speaker_heading: DARRY (cont'd)
dialog: Come on, right in the eye.
text: She turns and glares at him as she throws the car in gear.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: I'm not getting out of the
dialog: car.
text: Darry smiles. Trish heads out onto the highway. Back toward
dialog: the old church.
scene_heading: EXT. OLD CHURCH. LATE DAY. MINUTES LATER.
text: The car stops on the empty two-lane just before the old
text: church. Darry and Trish regard it. Check the rearview too.
text: Empty road. Empty church yard.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Every bone in my body is
dialog: telling me not to do this.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Where would men be if they
dialog: spent their lives listening to
dialog: women's bodies?
text: She gives him a look. Rolls into the drive. The old church is
dialog: sagging and gray and has not been a place of worship in many
dialog: years.
text: They drive around the side. Both staring up at the old
text: steeple. And the THREE BLACK CROWS perched on the cross where
text: one arm has rotted off.
text: The back of the place is covered in soil. No parking lot.
text: Just moist dirt and leaves. Mulch. And ahead, through the
text: windshield, the large drain pipe sticking out of the ground.
text: Trish drives slowly toward it. Stops a few yards away. Looks
text: at her brother. Suddenly Darry doesn't look so brave either.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 18
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: I'm just gonna look.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: You look like you're gonna
dialog: puke.
text: Darry opens the car door. Gets out. Looks out to the highway.
text: Then the surrounding woods in back of the church. No one.
text: Moves toward the old pipe when the sound of his sister turns
dialog: his head.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Let's do this and do it fast.
text: They approach the pipe warily. It is corrugated metal and
text: sticks out of the ground about three feet. Angled into the
text: ground, its jagged metal mouth is about three feet wide.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Drainage pipe or something?
text: Trish and Darry stare down the dark tunnel. A breeze comes
text: out of it. And a terrible stench...
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Oh my God...
text: She covers her mouth and stares at her brother.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: That breeze has to come from
dialog: somewhere.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Somewhere rank.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Doesn't look like a sewer
dialog: pipe.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Come on Darry! We can't see
dialog: anything down there!
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: (nods to the car)
dialog: You gotta flashlight?
text: She throws him a cold look. Moves back to the car. Darry
text: stares down into the pitch.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 19
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Hello?
text: Listens to his echo.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Anybody down there?
text: Again his voice rebounding. Looks back toward the car when
text: the smallest of sounds drifts up the pipe.
text: Darry whirls back to it. Stares in. SOMEWHERE DOWN IN THE
scene_heading: DARK, A MURMUR. A SOFT, MUFFLED, HUMAN SOUND.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Hello?
dialog: (to Trish)
dialog: Hurry up!
text: Trish brings the flashlight. Darry grabs it out of her hand.
text: Shines it down the long length of metal.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Hello?!
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: There's someone down there!
dialog: I just heard them!
dialog: (again into the dark)
dialog: Hello?!
text: The light reveals dark earth at the bottom of the pipe. Some
text: twenty-five feet down.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: You're hearing things.
text: Darry tests the strength of the pipe. It is anchored solidly
text: in the ground.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Darry, don't even think about
dialog: it.
text: He hoists himself up into the mouth.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: I told you I heard someone!
text: Crouched inside the pipe, he stares down. Holds the
text: flashlight with one hand and the lip of the tube with the
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: You know the part in scary
dialog: movies where somebody does
dialog: something really stupid and
dialog: everybody hates them for it?
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: This is it!
text: A small, scuffling sound from below.
text: Trish hears this. Darry stares down the tunnel,
text: darkness with the flashlight. Looks back at her.
dialog: expression asks her Did you hear that?!
text: Now worming his way further into the opening of
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: No Darry!
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Let me slide down-
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Goddamnitt
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Just let me get a little way
dialog: in-
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: You're not going down there!
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: I'm not! Just hold my feet.
dialog: 20
dialog: raking the
dialog: His
dialog: the tunnel.
text: As he lays down inside the tube, flashlight extended, Trish
text: grabs her brother's ankles.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Anybody down there?
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: God when was the last time you
dialog: washed any socks?
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: I see something!
text: He strains to look back at her. Trish too scared to comment.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: (shouts down again)
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 21
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: I'm counting to ten Darry.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Something's moving down
dialog: there...
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Then I am letting go and going
dialog: back to my car-
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Quiet!
dialog: (peers forward)
dialog: I just saw it again. Something
dialog: is definitely moving down here-
text: Moving alright -directly into Darry's flashlight beam. TWO
text: TERRIFIED RATS -darting directly at him.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Abbhhh!!!!!
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Darry!!!!!
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Rats!!!!
text: The rodents run right up over his shoulders. He screams.
text: Thrashes. They scurry onto his back. Rushing up...
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: (trying to keep hold of his
dialog: kicking feet)
dialog: It's what?!
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: It's rats!!!!
text: But he doesn't need to tell her. The rats run right at her
dialog: now! One down each of Darry's legs!
text: Trish screams -releasing her brother's still thrashing feet.
text: It's a tie who screams louder: Trisha stumbling back as the
text: rats leap to the ground -or brother Darry as he slides all
text: the way down the large pipe.
text: A GREAT THUD BELOW. Trish charges toward the pipe as the
text: rodents scurry into the leaves.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Darry!?
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 22
text: Her voice echoes into darkness as she stares down.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Darry?!
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Owww! Fell right on my head.
scene_heading: INT. SUBTERRANEAN ROOM. CHURCH. LATE DAY. SAME TIME.
text: Darry rubs his neck. Winces in the dark. Rust and dust
text: trickle down from the pipe. He sits in the dim pool of
text: daylight from above. Squints up into it.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Why'd you let go?!
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: How the Hell're you gonna get
dialog: out of there, idiot!
text: Darry stands slowly. Looks up the drain pipe.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: I can climb out, relax your
dialog: crack.
text: He bends and gropes for the flashlight outside the circle of
text: light. Finds it. Switches it on.
text: The first thing the light hits, is the edge of something
text: wrapped in a bloody sheet.
text: Darry stops. This is what they saw being dumped down the
dialog: tube.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Darry?
text: Brother doesn't answer. Takes a terrified step toward it.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Do it then, climb out please.
text: There can be no question it is a body. Blood stains on the
text: head and midsection. Sheet around it. Tied with rope at the
text: neck and ankles.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Say not so, sis.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 23
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: h (peering down)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: (to himself now)
dialog: Say not so...
text: He bends to it. Studies the head as he pales.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Hello?
text: Feels like an idiot talking to it. But does anyway.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Did I hear you down here?
text: No response. Swallows. Has no choice but to touch it. Gently
text: on the arm. Pushes it. Testing it.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Darry what in the Holy Hell
dialog: are you doing down there?!
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: I found our body.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: You found what?
text: Darry still staring at. Paling.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: I found the body.
text: Darry starts to get up. Grabbed! By a hand!
text: DARRY WAILS. Lurches away from it, stumbling back. The body
text: is moving under its bloody sheet. Twitching. Trying to
dialog: breathe.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Oh God!
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Darry?
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Oh God!!!
text: Darry dashes toward it. Crashes to his knees. Starts tearing
text: at the sheet around its head.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 24
text: The sheet being sucked in and out around the mouth now. It is
text: gasping for air.
text: Darry trying to tear the sheet. To get a grip on it. The body
text: thrashes.
text: Finally -RIPPPPPPP!!!!!! The sheet tears away and Darry
text: stares down in shock.
text: It is A YOUNG MAN. About his age. Deathly gray. Mouth open in
text: mute agony. Eyes wide. Blinking up at him.
text: Darry can only stare in terror. He doesn't know what to do.
text: Frantically grabs the sheet. Tears it the rest of the way
text: down the body -stopping abruptly.
text: The young man's bare body has an incision of ugly black
text: stitches --all the way from the navel to the neck.
text: Darry thinks he might be sick. Looks up into those wide eyes.
dialog: What in God's name did someone do to you?
text: Both boys stare at each other helplessly.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Darry?
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: (can whisper back)
dialog: Trish...
text: The boy's dry, blue lips are opening. The Adam's apple bobs
text: as he tries to swallow. Darry crazy with fear, leans down.
text: His ear at the boy's lips as they part again.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: What?
text: A whispered word comes out of his mouth. Choked. Raspy.
dialog: Unintelligible.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: What did you say?
text: But no more sound comes. Nor breathing. Darry staring wide-
text: eyed. Almost catatonic. Backs off him. Slowly.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: I am up here all Goddamned
dialog: alone little brother! Now get
dialog: your ass up here, it is
dialog: getting dark!
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 25
text: Her angry voice echoes down. Darry moves to the puddle of
text: light and looks up at her.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Is she dead?
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: He.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Come on, before that guy comes
dialog: back!
text: Darry nods. Goes to hoist a foot up into the tube but stops.
text: His flashlight has swept over something else outside the aura
dialog: of daylight.
text: He throws the light along the damp earth, past the lifeless
text: body of the boy and over to...
text: Two more bloody, sheet-wrapped bodies. Piled on top of each
dialog: other.
text: Darry in shock... Stares numbly at them. Swallows. Starts to shake
dialog: his head 'no'. Cannot accept this. Will not accept this.
text: Darry charging now, back toward the pool of daylight.
scene_heading: EXT. OLD CHURCH. LATE DAY. SAME TIME.
text: Above, Trish sees him hoist himself into the tube and start a
text: furious, frightened climb toward daylight.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Darry?
text: A climb so violent the pipe rocks and shimmies. Rivulets of
text: soot and rust trickling down the metal surface.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: What's the matter...
text: But little brother isn't answering. Just clamoring
dialog: desperately to get back up top and away from this place
dialog: forever...
text: Halfway up he slips. THE PIPE GROANS as he tries to get new
dialog: footing.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Be careful!
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 26
text: He looks up at her. His face is dirty and his eyes wide with
text: child-like horror.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: This whole thing is moving...
text: He catches his breath, still staring up at her.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Say something Darry, you're
dialog: scaring the shit out of me!
text: Darry starts up again. His sister reaching down toward him:
text: Slow crane up: moving above the pipe and above the church.
text: High enough to look down the lonely two-lane:
text: And see a van headed toward them in the distance...
text: Darry reaches up for his sister's hand as the PIPE SHRIEKS
text: AGAIN. More soot dislodging. Running past him.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Shhh!!!
text: She hears THE APPROACHING ENGINE. Looks down at little brother.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Someone's coming...
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: Someone's coming!!!
text: In a new panic he grabs Trish's hand. With a concerted effort
text: big sis pulls little brother up to the mouth of the pipe.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: (trying to look behind her)
dialog: Hurry!!!!
text: WRRANNKKKKK! !!! The pipe makes A NEW, SHRILLER KIND OF
text: SOUND... and Darry can feel the entire thing shift.
text: Really clutching his sister's hand now. Grabs the lip of the
text: pipe with the other. But a piece of its jagged, torn metal
text: stabs into his palm.
text: He yells. Retracts his hand violently. Loses his footing.
text: Slides out of Trish's grip. Down he goes again. Thrashing all
dialog: the way.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Darry!
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 27
text: Gets his footing halfway down. Examines the gash in his hand
text: when PING! PING! Just beneath his sneakers, the rusty welds
dialog: holding the lengths of the pipe together -snap!
text: Darry in the middle of the tube. Staring up at his sister
text: with wide eyes. AS A LOW, ACHING METAL GROAN BEGINS, BUILDING
text: QUICKLY....
text: Darry scrambling up toward the mouth as he realizes what is
text: about to happen.
text: Almost to the top when the bottom half of the massive tube
text: falls away. Darry sliding down again with the great jolt.
text: Both he and the pipe plummeting down into the darkness in a
text: great cacophony of sound and dust.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Darrrrry!
text: Tries to see through the cloud of dust that shoots up out of
text: the tube AS THE SOUND OF THE APPROACHING VAN GETS LOUDER.
text: She whirls toward the highway. Dashes toward her car. Huddles
text: in front of it. Peers around the left front wheel. Her heart
dialog: racing.
text: The van comes into view...
text: But not a dark van. This is another, newer van. And it
text: continues down the two-lane without ever stopping.
scene_heading: INT. SUBTERRANEAN ROOM. CHURCH. DUSK. MOMENTS LATER.
text: Darry sitting on the ground against the fallen half of the
text: pipe staring at the gash in his hand. Stares up with Trish's
dialog: voice.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: It wasn't him.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: You know you really suck!
dialog: (stands, holding his arm)
dialog: In the moment of truth you
dialog: really don't know how to hang
dialog: on do you? You just suck-
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: You were the one who wanted to
dialog: come back here and have a
dialog: little adventure!
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS
dialog: 28
text: Darry is staring over at the bodies. The two still in sheets.
text: He stares up at his sister again.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Well I hope there's another
dialog: way outta there.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: _ (angry)
dialog: Well it's a church basement so
dialog: I'm guessing the church!
text: The sagging old church. Especially forboding as she regards it.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: You don't think I'm going in
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: You have to stay out front and
dialog: watch for people.
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: You see anyone? Flag ‘em down!
dialog: Tell ‘em to get the cops out
dialog: here right away!
dialog: Trish liking this less and less.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: I'm gonna find a way up.
text: He starts to move off but calls her again.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Trish?
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: You see that van coming, you
dialog: get back to this pipe and
dialog: holler down as loud as you
dialog: can.
text: Now she couldn't like the whole idea less. Darry staring at
dialog: those bodies again.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: I gotta find the flashlight.
text: Trish hurries to the car. Keeping an eye on the old highway.
text: She gets in. Starts the engine.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 29
scene_heading: INT. SUBTERRANEAN ROOM. LATE DAY. SAME TIME.
text: Darry takes the flashlight out from under the fallen length
text: of pipe. Tries it. It still works.
text: Letting his light lead him, he moves forward..
text: Ahead: the other two bodies. Piled together. These
dialog: bloodstains are darker. Browner. How long have they been down
dialog: here?
text: Darry draws in a breath. The smell is getting putrid.
text: In the same moment his light ascends. There are words over
text: his head. An epitaph, spelled out in bones:
dialog: WHERE THERE'S A HELL THERE'S A
speaker_heading: WAY
dialog: Darry really gets a chill now. Doesn't want to wonder if
text: those are human bones. Arranged as they are, on a high arch
text: that leads into a larger, darker subterranean room.
text: Where a hand is sticking out of the wall.
text: His light falls over it. The skin on its splayed fingers
text: looks petrified. Is this a human hand?
text: No question: The rest of the body is part of the wall.
text: Skin leathered with age. Like beef jerky. Teeth infected with
text: termites... Head back, mouth open in a scream long gone
text: silent. A body in a wall.
text: But more light reveals more horror. A WALL of bodies.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Oh no... oh God...
text: Darry steps forward, knees shaking. The vast room ahead, is
text: walled with dozens of these mounted corpses.
dialog: Men and women of all ages. Body after body.
text: Stitched together in a hideous tapestry. Large stitches.
text: Identical to those just uncovered beneath that bloody sheet.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 30
text: Darry swings the light to the other side of the chamber.
text: Another grotesque mural of the dead, extending deep into the
dialog: darkness ahead...
dialog: God how many bodies are down here?
text: Darry moves forward -drawn by his own need to prove none of
dialog: this can possibly be real!
text: Some bodies are turned away. Skeletal heads looking back over
text: their shoulders -petrified backsides showing more stitches.
text: Several are as armless as the Venus DeMilo. Some missing
text: other limbs. Heads. Feet. Genitals.
text: Darry's growing repulsion moves him faster -how big is this
dialog: room? Feels like a football field...
text: Deeper along the hideous walls, Darry turns abruptly. Two
text: withered corpses in the tapestry.
text: On the finger of one: a large ring. An old Varsity ring. His
text: beam reflecting off its dusty jeweled surface. Darry stares
text: at it with unquestionable recognition.
text: Looks slowly to the corpse beside it. A girl? Once? Her
text: incision is all around her neck. As if her head had been
text: severed and then sewn back on.
scene_heading: EXT. OLD CHURCH. DUSK. SAME TIME.
text: Trish parked at the corner of the old church. Keeping an eye
text: on both directions of the empty two lane. Watching the long
text: shadows as the sun drops.
text: Feels something creeping over her. Looks up.
text: The sun is dropping behind the steeple of the church, the
text: shadow of the tower slowly falling on her.
text: She sits anxious in its growing darkness.
scene_heading: INT. SUBTERRANEAN ROOM. CHURCH. DUSK. SAME TIME.
text: The same below: Darry staring back at the distant archway and
text: the dying sunlight.
text: Looks ahead at the cavern of the dead. The ambient light
dialog: fading away over all those twisted faces... this place is
dialog: getting really dark.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 31
text: Darry takes a breath and moves forward quickly. Not quite
dialog: running. The darkness won't allow this. But walking as
dialog: quickly as he ever has...
text: The deeper he gets, the fresher the bodies.
text: They no longer have the withered faces and skins like apple
text: dolls. They have been a part of the walls for less time.
text: Darry moves faster. Almost running.
text: Grimacing faces of the dead, gaping mouths of mute agony
text: shouting him on.
text: Now practically sprinting through this corridor of death.
text: Tries to keep his eyes straight ahead. Doesn't want to look
dialog: at them. Tries not to...
text: Steals a look to one side. Looks back and WHAMMM!!!! Runs
text: directly into someone reaching out for him!
text: Darry has fallen and screams. Backs up on all fours. Stops.
text: The figure reaching out is just another corpse on a new wall
text: in front of him. He has finally arrived at the end of this
dialog: horrible room.
text: Between this corpse and another, Darry can see hinges.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: You're fucking kidding me...
text: This withered corpse, with his outstretched hand is a door.
dialog: He looks at the hand. The handle? This is what I have to pull
dialog: to get out of here?
text: He swallows, draws a breath and reaches out. Avoids the
text: leathery fingers and takes the forearm. Gets his grip.
text: Pulls! The door doesn't move! Darry can't believe what he's
text: doing. Gets a tighter grip and pulls again! Hard!
dialog: This door hasn't been opened in years.
text: Reaches out again -when the corpses' head turns toward
dialog: him.... with its empty eyes and gaping mouth!
text: Darry leaps away. Staring terrified.
text: But the head has only been jarred loose. It falls now, right
text: off the neck. Hangs by a leathery strand of flesh.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 32
text: This is enough! Darry reaches out. Yanks with all his might
text: on the forearm of the headless man and in a terrible frenzy
text: dislodges the door.
text: It comes off its hinges and topples toward Darry -corpse and
dialog: all.
text: The door is heavy and it hits hard -but not as hard as Darry
text: hits the ground.
text: The corpse falling on top of him -the head still attached by
text: some brittle tendon, nuzzles into his shoulder.
text: Darry doesn't have time to scream -he throws the door off him
text: and scrambles forward, through the dark open doorway and up
text: some dusty steps beyond.
text: Climbing and screaming. Screaming and climbing. And climbing
dialog: some more...
scene_heading: EXT. OLD CHURCH. NIGHT. MOMENTS LATER.
text: Down the highway, two headlights appear.
text: Trish instantly afraid. Stares down at them. Could this be
dialog: him?
text: Trish looks at the church. Where the Hell is he?
text: The headlights closer now. The vehicle is big. The van?
text: She is suddenly unreasonable with panic. Doesn't know what to
text: do. --The lights of the oncoming vehicle starting to show on
text: her face.
text: She ducks. Below the dashboard. Can hear THE ENGINE. HEAVY
text: LIKE THE VAN. Lights spilling across the dash now. She
text: reaches up from below. Turns the key.
text: The engine won't turn over.
text: Lights really bright now. Almost upon her. Turns the key
dialog: again. Goddamn thing won't start!
text: Trish's eyes starting to well. Light filling the interior of
text: the car. The engine finally sparks. She is ready.
text: But the lights are passing now. And she peeks over the dash
text: at nothing but an old pick up continuing on down the highway.
text: Trish sits up- SCREAMS!!! SOMEONE AT HER WINDOW. STARING IN.
text: DARK FACE. WIDE EYES ETCHED IN THE DYING LIGHT OF THE PASSING
speaker_heading: TRUCK.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 33
text: Darry. Almost comatose, staring in at her.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Goddammit Darry!!!!
text: He just stares.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: You asshole!
dialog: Sees that something is very wrong. Little brother just
text: staring back.
scene_heading: EXT. LONELY COUNTRY ROAD. NIGHT. MINUTES LATER.
text: Trish drives in silence. The highway rushing past them. Keeps
text: throwing looks at her brother. Still as a statue. Face dirty.
text: Bloody hand wrapped in a piece of torn T shirt. Eyes staring
dialog: ahead.
text: Oncoming headlights now. Both brother and sister study them.
text: Another truck. It rushes past.
text: A sign up ahead:
dialog: @
dialog: ®
text: She watches it fly by. Looks to him again.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Would you please just say
dialog: something?!
dialog: (no response)
dialog: I mean it Darry, you're
dialog: scaring the shit out of me!
text: His voice as subdued as she has ever heard it.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: I saw ‘em, Trish. Kenny and
dialog: Darla. Class of '80.
text: She just stares.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: They were down there, both of
dialog: them.
text: (holds up a hand, not
dialog: looking at her)
dialog: I saw his ring. He was still
text: wearing his Varsity ring.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 34
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: You said that happened a
dialog: hundred miles from here-
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: I said I saw ‘em!
dialog: (angry silence)
dialog: All dead and dried up down
dialog: there with a whole bunch of
dialog: others, okay!?
text: She more frightened by his state than by his words.
speaker_heading: DARRY (cont'd)
dialog: Don't tell me you don't
dialog: believe me, alright?!
text: (points a rabid finger at
dialog: her)
dialog: Don't make me tell you
dialog: everything I saw down there
dialog: ‘cause you don't wanna hear
dialog: it, okay?!
text: Her brother's eyes fill with angry tears. Then goes silent
text: again. Drops his head against the window.
text: Trish looks at the fuel indicator. Only a quarter of a tank
dialog: left.
speaker_heading: DARRY (cont'd)
dialog: She did lose her head.
text: Looks over at her brother. Staring out the window into the
text: passing night.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Darla lost her head just like
dialog: they said.
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: And you know what he did,
dialog: Trish? You know what he did
dialog: for her? He sewed it back on.
text: Darry lets out a little laugh. Is he going crazy?
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Sewed it right back on.
scene_heading: EXT. TRENTDALE. NIGHT. TEN MINUTES LATER.
text: Trish's sedan rambles off the two-lane and toward a small
text: cluster of buildings under the starry night sky. Past a
text: weathered and aging sign that reads:
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 35
speaker_heading: Welcome to TRENTDALE PR
dialog: 
text: Brother and sister look to each other. Neither wants to stop.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: We have to or we're not gonna
dialog: make it home.
text: She continues on toward the only lights. Combination
text: Restaurant and Gas Station. The tall sign stretching into the
text: stars announces plainly:
text: Trish pulls in. Rolls under the hot white neon over the gas
text: pumps. Looks over at little brother.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: You gonna make a phone call?
text: Darry just nods. Opens the car door.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Throw some water on yourself.
dialog: You look like you just crawled
text: out of a sewer.
text: Darry moves with fatigue toward the restaurant. Several cars
text: and big trucks parked around it.
text: Trish moves to the pump. There is a pad lock on it. She grabs
text: it. Yanks on it. Turns to her brother.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Darry?
dialog: (off his look)
text: Pumps are locked.
text: She watches him turn and move inside.
scene_heading: INT. DELROY'S FOOD AND GAS. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
text: Darry steps in. Darker than he expected. Stares ahead. Etched
text: in the light of a cigarette machine.
dialog: He must look pretty bad because those who do catch a glimpse
dialog: of him, take another one quickly.
text: Like the PLUMP WAITRESS eye-balling him. She is fifty-
text: something. Name tag reads BEVERLY.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 36
speaker_heading: WAITRESS BEVERLY
dialog: Restrooms are for paying
dialog: customers, kiddo.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Could we get some gas, please?
text: The woman looks out the window, sees Trish leaning against
dialog: the car.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: (a well worn rhyme)
dialog: Pump's locked at eight
dialog: o'clock.
text: Darry has no energy to argue. Looks out at his sister.
speaker_heading: DARRY
text: Lights are still on.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: (calls back to the kitchen)
dialog: Arnie, you got the pump lights
dialog: on again!
text: Trish suddenly plunged into darkness. Waitress Beverly looks
text: back to Darry as if that settled everything.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: We really need some gas.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS BEVERLY
dialog: You look like you need a
dialog: little more than gas, kiddo.
scene_heading: EXT. DELROY'S FOOD AND GAS. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
text: Trish is fit to be tied. Storms toward the diner. Cursing
text: under her breath. Is almost to the front doors when out on
text: the two lane comes the sound of a familiar engine.
text: This is the sound of the van. There can be no question.
text: She spots it instantly. Sailing down the highway. Speeding
text: past Trentdale. Knows it must be headed back to the old
dialog: church.
scene_heading: INT. DELROY'S FOOD AND GAS. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
text: Trish bursts in. Patrons staring at her. TWO TRUCKERS
text: especially. They don't make eyes at her, but she knows the
text: look. Beverly pouring coffee for them.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 37
speaker_heading: WAITRESS BEVERLY
text: Pumps locked at eight o'clock-
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: This is an emergency!
text: Her raised tone turns more than a few heads.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: I need you to please call the
dialog: police.
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: Right now. Please get them
dialog: here right away.
text: Waitress Beverly stares at her now.
speaker_heading: TRISH

speaker_heading: TRISH

speaker_heading: DARRY

speaker_heading: TRISH

speaker_heading: DARRY

speaker_heading: TRISH

speaker_heading: DARRY

dialog: You bet me five dollars I

dialog: (she looks up at him)
dialog: You remember. ‘Cause I

speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: I am so scared, Darry. He is

text: beautiful in the golden glow of the machine.
dialog: “Where’d you get those eyes?”
text: The song goes instrumental. He looks back at Trish. The

speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 47
speaker_heading: TROOPER GIDEON

dialog: I told you the facts: this guy
text: drives a black van and it
dialog: nearly killed us!
text: We saw him throw a body down a
text: pipe, that dumps into a cellar
dialog: under the old church!
dialog: I saw the body! He was a guy
dialog: my age and he was still alive,
dialog: except that he'd been split
text: from his neck to his navel and
text: then sewn back up again!
dialog: Now this guy must have a
dialog: hundred, maybe two hundred

dialog: seen ‘em!
speaker_heading: MANAGER

speaker_heading: TROOPER GIDEON
dialog: No one's saying you're lying,

speaker_heading: DARRY

speaker_heading: TROOPER GIDEON

text: The Troopers join them now. Watching as brother and sister
text: move quickly toward the car.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS BEVERLY
dialog: Someone saw him from the
dialog: window.

speaker_heading: WAITRESS BEVERLY

speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 49
speaker_heading: TRISH

speaker_heading: WAITRESS BEVERLY
dialog: Well he already ran off!
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: A man?
speaker_heading: WAITRESS BEVERLY
dialog: More like a pervert.
dialog: (off their puzzled looks)

text: watching. He was outside the

text: Darry and Trish staring at her.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS BEVERLY
text: Holding big handfuls of it
text: under his nose. Looked like he
dialog: was liking it too.
text: Darry at the car now. Shirts, socks, shorts all spilled out

speaker_heading: TROOPER WESTON
dialog: Ran off which way?
text: Beverly looks back at the patrons at the window. Hollers to
dialog: one of the Truckers.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS BEVERLY
dialog: Which way he run off, Billy?
text: A Trucker at the window points out. Beyond the pumps. Down
text: the empty and shadowy street.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: It was him.

dialog: He had time to get to the

speaker_heading: TROOPER GIDEON
dialog: Alright, we don't need anymore
dialog: excitement than we already

speaker_heading: DARRY

speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Hey, you interested in a hand
dialog: print?
text: Trish and the Troopers move quickly toward him.
text: Gideon squats with Darry at the open car door. Look at the
text: surface of the car handle. It is smudged with some kind of
text: fine gray powder.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: You can dust it, right? Get a
dialog: print?
speaker_heading: TROOPER GIDEON
dialog: Looks like somebody already
dialog: did.
text: He looks up at his partner. A breeze comes up and the "print"
text: starts to blow away.

text: some of it as it blows into the wind.
text: A_SLOW CRANE UP: As we rise slowly.

text: WHAM!!! The large, razor sharp blade of a battle axe breaks
text: through the roof of the police car --right in front of his
dialog: face.
scene_heading: INT. TRISH'S CAR. COUNTRY HIGHWAY. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
text: The kids still listening to the loud song. Behind them, the
text: patrol car swerves erratically. Something dark still riding
text: on top of it.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: They're gonna be in Concert in
dialog: August, downtown!
scene_heading: EXT. TROOPER CAR. COUNTRY HIGHWAY. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
text: Trooper Gideon's head is yanked up through a hole ripped in
text: the roof of the car.
text: The Figure that grips him, rears back with the same razor-
text: sharp battle axe. Almost Medieval-looking.
text: And in one neat swoop -swings it at the Trooper's head.
scene_heading: INT. TRISH'S CAR. COUNTRY HIGHWAY. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
text: Angle behind brother and sister: ROCK SONG BLARING AS
text: -something big hits the roof of the car. Hard and fast. Flies
text: down the windshield and off the hood.
text: Trish slams on the brakes. Both of them clutching the
text: dashboard. The car swings to a halt in the middle of the two-
dialog: lane.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: What was that?
text: Brother sticks his head out the window. Stares into the night
text: sky. Sis looking behind them.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 57
text: The Trooper vehicle angled across the two lane. It too has
text: made a hurried stop. No movement inside. Dark and silent.
text: Silhouetted in the moonlight.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: What the Hell?
text: Brother and sister look at each other. Darry's head again out
dialog: the window.
speaker_heading: DARRY (cont'd)
dialog: Hey!
text: Darry's voice echoes into the night.
speaker_heading: DARRY (cont'd)
dialog: You okay in there?
text: Darry gets out. Trish follows.
speaker_heading: DARRY (cont'd)
dialog: Stay here.
dialog: Trish looks at him. No way!
text: Darry takes a tentative step toward the moonlit vehicle.
text: Wishes he could see more.
text: Trish seeing the dents on the roof of her car where the
text: object hit. Dents with a spatter pattern. Blood.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Darry...
text: Looks back at her. She holds up three fingers smudged with
dialog: blood.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: (screams at the car)
dialog: Hey!
text: The car's police lights flash on. Startles Darry and Trish.
text: Both squinting into them.
speaker_heading: DARRY (cont'd)
text: Get back in the car.
dialog: (turns to Trish)
dialog: Get back in the car!
text: Someone is staring out behind the wheel of that car.
text: Peering at them, through the angry flashes of red and blue...
text: through a windshield spattered with blood...
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 58
speaker_heading: DARRY (cont'd)
dialog: Trish, get in the car!
text: Trish paling. Turning to do this. Caught by the sight of
dialog: something else.
text: Down the road -just past the police car. A roundish thing in
text: the middle of the highway -silhouetted in moonlight.
text: Trooper Gideon's head. Staring out at her with dead eyes.
dialog: This is what hit them and rolled off the hood!
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Darry...
text: Darry trying to make out the face in the flaring lights. The
text: eyes. So white.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Trish...
text: The patrol car's door swings open and both of them whirl
text: around. Back toward their own vehicle. Leaping in.
text: Trish behind the wheel. Grapples for the stick shift in a
text: blind panic. Darry just as fast into the passenger seat.
text: Slams the door.
text: A tall, powerful silhouette rises out of the patrol car.
text: Turning instantly away from them.
speaker_heading: DARRY (cont'd)
dialog: Whoa, did you see that?
text: As it turns -its face glints for a moment in the moonlight.
dialog: The eyes. So white because they are just that and nothing
dialog: else.
dialog: No pupils or irises. A trick of the moonlight?
text: Trish staring. The car hasn't moved. Her hand still on the
dialog: stickshift.
text: The figure walks away from them with a chillingly casual
text: gait. His black coat flapping cape-like. And in the glare of
text: the flashing red and blue, walks back toward Gideon's head.
text: Whistling. Whistling a tune the kids have heard in the diner:
dialog: Jeepers, Creepers, where'd you get those Peepers?
text: Brother and sister transfixed. Watching as with a single
text: hand, the Figure reaches down and lifts Gideon's head by the
text: hair. Holds it then, in both hands. Looking at it.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 59
text: Holds it high. Level with its own eyes. Draws it closer. So
text: close he could be kissing it.
speaker_heading: DARRY (cont'd)
dialog: (a whisper)
dialog: I'm not seeing this.
text: The Figure turns the grizzly thing around now. Does the same
text: with the back of the head.
text: And both kids realize what he is doing. Smelling it...
speaker_heading: DARRY (cont'd)
dialog: What the Hell are we looking
dialog: at, Trish?
text: More horrid disbelief as the figure drop kicks the head -
text: sending it high in the sky and off into the tall grass of the
text: nearby field.
speaker_heading: DARRY (cont'd)
dialog: Let's get the Hell outta
dialog: here...
text: The Figure turns now. Staring back at them.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Go.
text: Trish guns the engine and the car screams back down the
dialog: highway.
text: The dark figure watches this from afar. Still as a statue.
scene_heading: INT. TRISH'S CAR. COUNTRY HIGHWAY. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: What is this guy?
text: Sees her brother staring out the rear.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: What is this guy, Trish?
dialog: What'd he do to those cops?
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Don't know and don't wanna.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: And why didn't he do it to us?
dialog: You see the way he looked at
dialog: us?
dialog: (looks back at her)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 60
speaker_heading: DARRY (cont'd)
dialog: Like he's playing with us.
dialog: Like running us off the road
dialog: was just some kind of game.
scene_heading: EXT. LONELY COUNTRY ROAD. NIGHT.
text: Back at the scene of the crime, the empty patrol car, engine
text: running, rolls slowly off the highway and into a field.
text: The dark Figure watches only for a moment -moving away while
text: the car still travels pilotless deeper into the field.
text: Before it even settles, WE CAN THE HEAR THE RUMBLE OF THE
text: DARK VAN'S ENGINE. We leave the patrol car for a glimpse at
dialog: the highway when-
text: WOOSHHH!!! The dark van rips past us down the moonlit two
dialog: lane.
scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER STRETCH OF COUNTRY ROAD. NIGHT. MINUTES LATER.
text: Both Trish and Darry see it at the same time. A farmhouse.
text: Down a gravel drive off the road. Lights on in the windows.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: There's a phone!
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: You sure you wanna stop?!
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: I wanna get to anyone who can
dialog: help us!
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: What's the next town?
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: I don't know and I'm not gonna
dialog: wait to find out.
text: Trish takes the gravel drive. Jostles down the lane.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Look we just ask to use the
dialog: phone, okay? We don't freak
dialog: these people out.
text: The house comes into more detail. Old and sagging. But its
text: warmly lit windows like a beacon. Of safety. Sanity.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 61
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: We don't wanna scare 'em. We
dialog: just wanna call for help.
text: Headlights etching the overgrown garden that is the front
text: yard. An ancient pick-up to one side. In the center of the
text: overgrowth, a sagging thing scarcely presuming to be a
dialog: scarecrow.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Too spooky.
text: Trish looks at him. He's serious.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Too spooky. Let's just get the
dialog: Hell outta here.
text: At the outskirts of the yard, a plastic sunflower ticks away
text: in a night breeze as the car comes to a halt.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: It's pretty run down. Hope
dialog: they have a phone.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: I hope they have a gun.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: I hope they don't.
text: She opens the door. Gets out. Darry too. Their first look is
text: to the highway. Empty. For as far as the eye can see.
text: KER-CLINK! THE DISTINCT SOUND OF A RIFLE BEING COCKED turns
text: the kids quickly toward the house.
speaker_heading: CAT LADY
dialog: Who are you?
text: A WOMAN'S RASPY VOICE. From a silhouette behind the screen
text: door. A blue-black rifle barrel glinting in its hands.
speaker_heading: CAT LADY
dialog: I said who are you?
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Patricia James. This is my
dialog: brother Darry.
speaker_heading: CAT LADY
dialog: What 'cha want?
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 62
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: A telephone?
speaker_heading: CAT LADY
dialog: Ain't got one.
text: The kids look at each other. A whispered aside:
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: You know it's not too late to
dialog: keep driving and not stop
dialog: ‘till we see people.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: What do you think she is?
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Crazy?
speaker_heading: CAT LADY
dialog: Whatcha' need it for?
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Someone's been killed. A
text: police officer. Down the road.
text: The screen door opens now and THE CAT LADY steps out. A
text: strange looking woman of fifty or so. Very intense around the
dialog: eyes.
text: MEOWWW...
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: We just came from there-
text: Sounds of cats at her feet. She pushes a couple
text: back inside the screen with a foot. A foot wearing a fuzzy
text: pink slipper.
text: Darry staring down at the felines. Remembers instantly the
dialog: strange phone call at the diner. Did you see the cats yet?
dialog: The Woman
dialog: gun still
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: It's a ways back. You can't
dialog: see it from here.
text: levels her eyes at the two. Judging them. Her shot
text: clenched tightly.
speaker_heading: CAT LADY
dialog: All right one call.
dialog: (off their looks)
dialog: But be quick, my babies they
dialog: don't like strangers.
text: Trisha just stares at the old woman. She has children?
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 63
text: Trish climbs the porch steps. Sees Darry still staring down
text: at the cats inside the door.
text: Trisha doesn't understand. Makes a face that tells him to
text: hurry up! He starts forward. Cat Lady opens the screen for
text: them -again holding one feline inside with a fuzzy slipper.
speaker_heading: CAT LADY
dialog: Careful. I don't let ‘em out
dialog: after dark.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: How many cats do you have?
speaker_heading: CAT LADY
dialog: More than a couple, I'm
dialog: afraid.
scene_heading: INT. CAT LADY'S HOUSE. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
text: Trish and Darry halt instantly as they step inside:
text: The living room is covered with cats. All kinds. All shapes.
text: All sizes. There must be forty of them in the living room
dialog: alone.
speaker_heading: CAT LADY
dialog: Phone's there by the love
dialog: seat.
text: The Cat Lady shuts the front door and steps past them. Stows
text: the rifle in a closet.
text: Trish covers her nose with a hand. Makes a face at Darry. The
dialog: smell is terrible.
speaker_heading: CAT LADY
dialog: Policeman killed you say?
text: Darry still caught in an uneasy trance. That phone call. Did
dialog: you see the cats yet?
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Let's get out of here.
text: Trish looks at him like he's crazy. The Cat Lady turns to
text: them now. Trish lowers her hands from her nose.
speaker_heading: CAT LADY
dialog: People think they can drive
dialog: like maniacs ‘round here. Cops
dialog: too, damned fools.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 64
speaker_heading: CAT LADY (cont'd)
dialog: Just a bunch of punk kids with
dialog: badges and guns if you ask me.
text: Trish moves to the phone. It too surrounded by felines.
text: Scatters a few as she reaches down and lifts the receiver.
speaker_heading: CAT LADY
dialog: Who is that making a call on
dialog: your telephone, hmm? Who is
dialog: that?
text: She is asking the one cat that remains. Sniffing Trisha as
text: she dials.
speaker_heading: CAT LADY
dialog: That's the thing about cats.
dialog: (off Darry's look)
dialog: Can whiff a bad egg a mile
dialog: away. Can't they Tomfoolery?
text: Darry realizes she is referring to the cat that now rubs
text: itself against his legs.
speaker_heading: CAT LADY
dialog: Oh he likes you. Lookee that.
dialog: He wants you to pick him up.
text: Darry nods. Tries to press out a polite smile.
speaker_heading: CAT LADY
dialog: Don't be afraid.
text: Darry bends. Pets the cat's head.
speaker_heading: CAT LADY
dialog: Go on! Big boy like you's not
dialog: afraid of a little pussy is
dialog: he?
dialog: He regards her. Did she just say that? Must mean something
text: else. He lifts the cat into his arms. Pets its head.
speaker_heading: CAT LADY
dialog: There you go.
dialog: (steps away)
dialog: Big thing like you can't go
dialog: through his life being afraid
text: of a sweet little pussy.
text: She winks at him this time -lecherously. Darry swallows. She
dialog: means what she means.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 65
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Yes, Patrica James. We just
dialog: left Trentdale with a police
dialog: escort.
speaker_heading: PHONE VOICE
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: Are you calling the Trentdale
dialog: County sheriff's department?
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: I thought I was.
speaker_heading: CAT LADY
dialog: Trentdale's the next County
dialog: over. You're in Poho County
dialog: now, you crossed the County
dialog: line.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Look I don't know exactly
dialog: where the house is I'm calling
dialog: from-
text: She looks to the Cat Lady to tell her the address, but she is
text: shaking her head adamantly.
speaker_heading: CAT LADY
dialog: Don't bring the cops out here!
dialog: They try and bust my ass every
dialog: year with their zoning crap!
dialog: (to Darry)
dialog: Try and tell people how many
dialog: cats a person can have!
speaker_heading: PHONE VOICE
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: You said you needed to report
dialog: an emergency?
text: But the VOICE IS SUDDENLY SWALLOWED BY ANGRY STATIC ON THE
text: LINE. Trish holds the phone away from her ear.
text: Cat Lady and Darry watching. She clicks the clicker. Puts the
text: phone back to her ear. Nothing.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Your phone just went dead.
text: She is looking at her brother and thinking the worse.
text: The Cat Lady marches over to hear for herself. Puts the phone
text: to her ear as the lights go out all over the house.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 66
text: Darry, Trish, the Cat Lady and her many fuzzy minions
text: suddenly plunged into darkness.
text: Darry rushing to the window -the cat still in his arms.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
text: Out in the overgrown garden, the plastic sunflower again
text: clicks to a stop in the silent, moonlit yard.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: There's nobody out there.
text: Then every cat in the place lifts its head in unison.
text: Forty pairs of cat's eyes staring toward the front windows.
text: Trish and Darry watching this. As growing from every corner
text: of the room, are the wicked hisses of frightened cats
dialog: everywhere.
text: The cat in Darry's arms freaks -clawing and thrashing to free
dialog: itself.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Ouch!!!
text: He winces in pain as THE ANIMAL YOWLS and hits the floor
text: running. Cat Lady rushing to the front window. Trish and
text: Darry with her.
text: The overgrown yard is dark with inky shadows. Her distressed
text: scarecrow standing in the middle of it.
text: MORE CATS HISSING. Fur standing on end. Fangs bared. Whatever
dialog: is out there, these animals do not like it.
speaker_heading: CAT LADY
dialog: I'll be Goddamned!
text: The Cat Lady storming back to the closet for her rifle. The
text: kids looking after her.
speaker_heading: CAT LADY
dialog: That's not my scarecrow.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 67
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
text: Shot rolling slowly toward: The inky silhouette of the
dialog: scarecrow. It is larger than we remember it. And better
text: dressed. In a long black coat...
text: The Figure stands before the old hay-stuffed thing-creating a
text: single silhouette.
text: Cutting a tall, dark shadow against the starry night sky. One
text: with eyes we can barely discern.
dialog: Eyes that might not belong to any human thing...
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
text: The cats are going berserk. Two of them topple the phone
text: table. Others run in confused circles around the couch.
text: Several scramble over the base of the floor lamp. Send it on
text: its side with a loud crash. Still others are scaling the
text: drapes --clawing their way toward the ceiling...
text: The Cat Lady watches puzzled by her felines.
speaker_heading: CAT LADY
dialog: Who the Hell is that?
text: Cocks the rifle loudly and throws open the front door. Levels
text: the rifle at the scarecrow.
speaker_heading: CAT LADY
dialog: You gotta ‘bout ten seconds to
dialog: get your ass outta my yard!
text: The Scarecrow/Figure stands. Continues to stare in at them.
text: Silhouetted in the moonlight.
speaker_heading: CAT LADY
dialog: Don't think I'm gonna tell you
dialog: twice.
text: It's voice. Strange. A raspy whisper.
speaker_heading: THE CREATURE
dialog: My children.
text: Trish and Darry exchange glances.
speaker_heading: CAT LADY
dialog: What?
text: A chilling whisper in the night:
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 68
speaker_heading: THE CREATURE
dialog: I've come for my children.
text: Trish and Darry frozen by these words. The old woman turns to
dialog: look at them.
text: When the Figure bolts toward the house!
text: Cat Lady whirls about. Fires. KA-BLAM!!!
text: THE SCARECROW DISINTEGRATES. RIPPING INTO SHADOWY BITS THAT
scene_heading: EXPLODE IN EVERY DIRECTION. SOMETHING LARGER RIPPING SKYWARD
text: AT THE MOMENT OF IMPACT.
text: The Figure is gone. Vanished into thin air. Unless...
text: Cat Lady, Darry and Trish crowd the doorway trying to see
text: out. Darry's gaze caught by something high.
text: Catches a terrifying glimpse of it scrambling up the front of
text: the house. Like some horrible caped insect. As if gravity
dialog: simply did not exist.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: What in the Holy-
text: His cutting whispers turns the women to him. Stares at them
dialog: in shock.
text: KER-KRASH!!!! A WINDOW BREAKS SOMEWHERE UPSTAIRS. All three
text: whirl around. Staring up at the ceiling.
text: Then cats are dropping past the front windows. Dropping down
text: into the yard. From the second story? They land on their
text: feet. Scurrying off into the night....
text: Trish and Darry look at each other with mounting panic...The
dialog: Cat Lady looks to brother and sis. What the Hell did you
dialog: bring into my house?
text: AS SUDDENLY A FRIGHTENED AND VOCAL TORRENT OF CATS RUSH IN
text: GREAT PANIC DOWN THE STAIRS!
text: WITH THE SOUND FROM ABOVE, OF ONE CAT CLEARLY ATTACKING -the
text: Cat lady storms toward the stairs brandishing her rifle.
speaker_heading: CAT LADY
dialog: Get away from my babies you
dialog: sons-of-a-bitches!
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Don't!
text: Darry charges for her. Grabs the old woman.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 69
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Don't go up there!
speaker_heading: CAT LADY
dialog: Goddammit!!!
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Leave now!! With us!
speaker_heading: CAT LADY
dialog: Goddammit!!!
dialog: (screaming up the stairs)
dialog: Don't you hurt my babies-
text: She catches Darry in the groin with a nasty kick. HE YELPS.
text: Crumples as she charges up the steps.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Darry!!!
text: Sis hurries to him. Starts dragging him toward the front
dialog: door. She just wants out. Wants to go!
speaker_heading: CAT LADY
dialog: I'1l blow your Goddamned head
dialog: off-
text: But at the top of the stairs, the Cat Lady is suddenly
dialog: wrenched off her feet!
text: The kids watch as her fuzzy pink slippers disappear from
text: view. Straight up.
text: THEY HEAR HER GASP ONLY ONCE. NOW A CHOKED, GARGLING SOUND.
text: The kids staring up at the top step where here feet vanished.
text: The cats are in absolute frenzy. Some baring fangs in the
text: direction of the stairs, others climbing the old drapes of
text: the place in a frantic panic to get out. To get away.
text: Trish dashing back toward the front door with injured Darry.
text: Halted by the sight of those slippers -slipping now, slowly
text: back into view on the top step.
text: Something just out of sight at the top of the stairs is
text: holding her there. Feet dangling. One slipper falls off.
text: Darry approaches in horror. Wants to see up those stairs.
dialog: Wants to see just what the Hell this thing is...
text: At the foot of the stairs he looks up. Can see her body
text: hanging there, lifeless -held in the iron grip of the long
text: coated Figure --pulling the old woman into him as if she were
text: a doll.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 70
text: And sniffing. Sniffing her. The same way he did the officer's
text: decapitated head.
text: Darry throws a look to his sister: at the door, hand on the
text: knob -frozen by her brother's paling expression.
text: Darry looks back: the Figure takes another long inhale and
text: then peers around the dangling old woman. Out of the shadows
text: and down the stairs --directly at him.
text: For the first time Darry sees its face clearly:
text: Though the features are human. The glaring blind whites of
text: the eyes -where pupils should be- give a much more terrifying
dialog: impression.
dialog: Not of something human but of something else.
text: Something dark and powerful that only wears the guise of
dialog: human. ...Something utterly horrible and without conscience.
text: It stares at him a chilling moment longer. Again its raspy
text: voice whispering from its lips.
speaker_heading: THE CREATURE
dialog: She doesn't smell too good,
dialog: Darry.
text: Darry bolts. He is to the door so fast he turns the knob
text: before his sister can.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
text: Trish and Darry blasting outside. A flurry of fleeing cats
text: also pour down the porch steps with them, spilling into the
text: front yard. The kids scramble to their car.
text: Trish flies behind the wheel and turns the key. Engine not
dialog: turning over.
text: Darry's eyes scanning the dark face of the farmhouse. MORE
scene_heading: COMMOTION INSIDE. CATS SCREAMING.
text: Trish with the key. Grinding the ignition. It starts.
text: KA-TASSSHHHH!!!! THE LARGE UPSTAIRS WINDOW EXPLODES OUT IN A
text: POWERFUL SHOWER OF GLASS AND WOOD.
text: The Creature leaps into the night.
text: Darry and Trish watching it. Some kind of nightmare streaking
text: across the white of the half moon and then dropping down.
text: Down into the yard.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 71
text: Impossibly it lands on its feet. Crouched low to the ground.
text: Like some horrible beast ready to pounce.
text: Putting its sites -those horrible blank eyes- on the kids.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Go! Go! Go!
text: The car squeals out of the yard, down the gravel drive and
text: back toward the highway.
text: Darry watching as the Creature sprints across the yard.
text: Disappears in the darkness as the farmhouse gets smaller and
dialog: smaller...
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: You see his face?
text: Trish grapples the wheel. Taking the dark highway as fast as
dialog: she is able.
scene_heading: INT. TRISH'S CAR. COUNTRY HIGHWAY. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Come on Trish, you see his

text: A sign flashes by:
scene_heading: RATLROAD CROSSING 1/2 Mile
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: I know you saw it Goddamn it-
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: (matching his tone)
dialog: One freaky thing at a time,
dialog: alright?!
text: Silence. Both staring ahead now. Darry whispering his new
dialog: mantra.
speaker_heading: DARRY
text: He was wearing a mask.
dialog: (looks to her)
dialog: Trish?
dialog: (off her look)
text: He was wearing a mask.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 72
speaker_heading: DARRY

speaker_heading: TRISH
text: He was wearing a mask.
text: WOOOONNNNKKKKKK! !!!! THE HORRIBLE HORN BLARES BEHIND THEM.
text: The van is close -its headlights blasting the interior of the

speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: What is this guy trying to
dialog: do?!!
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Darry!
text: Trish has her own problem: up ahead The railroad crossing

speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Just do it!!!
text: THE TRAIN HORN BLARES ITS FINAL WARNING.
text: Trish slams the pedal to the metal and takes her sedan
text: blasting through the barrier arms.
text: It lurches across the track as the train roars at them like
text: an iron beast.
text: They fly over the tracks. The train just nicking their rear
text: bumper. Sends them spinning.
text: Brother and sister collectively trying to grab the wheel.
text: Spinning out of control while the train cuts them off from
dialog: the van.

text: close to the tracks and the train.
text: On the other side, the sedan stops spinning. Trish trying get her

speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Let go of the wheel!
text: Darry looks behind him. Nothing but the train CLANKING
text: NOISILY over the tracks.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: We gotta move!
text: Trish grabs the gearshift but it won't budge. Darry sees this.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Something's wrong.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 74
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Don't say that.
text: CLANK! CLANK! CLANK! The train's cars fly by -their only

speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: The gears are sticking-
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: (jaw tightening)
dialog: Unstick ‘em, Trish!
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: What do you want me to do?!
text: Trish and Darry both grapple the stick shift. Can't wrestle

speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Goddammit! !
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: You're gonna break it!
text: Not seeing, as we do, something black shooting into the sky
text: from the other side of the train.
text: BA-WAMMMM! !!! SOMETHING HITS THE TRUNK OF THE CAR. HITS IT
text: HARD. ROCKING IT VIOLENTLY.
text: Bro and sis stare out the back: The Creature is crouched
text: there -staring in at them with those horrible eyes.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: He jumped over the train,
dialog: Trish...
text: Trish grinding that stickshift -trying with all her might..
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: He jumped over the train,
dialog: Trish!
text: C1UNK! The car's transmission falls into gear and Trish guns
dialog: the engine.
text: The car lurches ahead --jolting the Creature. It clutches the
text: sides of the car as she speeds forward.
text: Darry in a stunned, numbed kind of shock.
text: Trish dips onto the shoulder of the road. Trying to make the
text: ride rough. Swings across both lanes. Weaving erratically.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 75
text: Trying desperately to lose the thing on the trunk.
text: Trish slams on the brakes. The car swings sideways violently.
text: Finally flinging it into the air.
text: The kids watch as he flails into space. Coat flapping around
text: him -like a giant bat who has suddenly lost its equilibrium.
text: Hitting the asphalt hard and rolling and skidding. Things
text: falling out of his coat as he does.
text: The battle axe CLANGING noisily on the ground and another
text: insidious looking knife, bouncing on the asphalt with a
text: couple of others --like the Creature, coming to an abrupt and
text: violent halt.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: What the Hell are those?
text: Trish just staring at the motionless heap of black under the
dialog: moonlight.
text: The train's final car moves down the tracks behind them.
text: Revealing the dark van just beyond the flashing railroad
dialog: lights.
text: Brother and sister staring ahead at the lifeless heap. THE
text: SOUND OF THE TRAIN FADES IN THE DISTANCE AND THE BELLS AT THE
scene_heading: TRAIN CROSSING CEASE.
text: Silence now. Only the sound of their breathing in the car
text: until Darry's whisper.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Hit him.
text: She looks at her little brother.
speaker_heading: DARRY
text: Hit him, Trish.
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: Hard.
text: She looks out the windshield. That lifeless mass sprawled on
dialog: the highway.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Do it!
text: She opens her mouth to respond -when the Creature's head
text: rises. It is staring at them. Those blind, ugly eyes burning
text: out toward them.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 76
text: Trish slams the pedal to the metal. Corrects the position of
text: the car and rockets forward with as much speed as she can
dialog: build.
text: The Creature's face caught in the glare of the headlights as
text: WHAM! Trish slams into it hard.
text: The car's wheels pummel it savagely. Both kids grimacing with
text: THE TERRIBLE SOUNDS OF CRACKING AND CRUNCHING BENEATH THEIR
dialog: TIRES....
text: Trish stops now. Looks back at her handiwork.
text: The cape has flapped over the Creature's head and its
text: lifeless figure, complete with tire tracks, lays a little
text: flatter on the two-lane.
text: Brother and sister exchange glances.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: You think he's dead?
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: They never are.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Right.
text: Trish throws the car in reverse and speeds back at the

text: KER-POP! A sickeningly distinct sound as the tires roll over
text: its legs this time.
text: Trish comes to a halt behind it. Staring ahead into the high
dialog: beams: there can be no mistaking this thing is flattened!
text: On the asphalt, at the end of one coat sleeve, a hand lay
text: crushed. Tire treads over it. Even bones crushed and flaking
dialog: like Greek pastry.
text: Blowing away now. The whole hand blowing away. Dust in the
dialog: wind.
dialog: 
text: In fact, LOTS of powder is blowing out from under that black
dialog: coat...
text: The kids watch in awe: Have they crushed this thing to dust?
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Let's get outta here.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 77
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: I don't know how much farther

speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Far enough.

text: A long bulletin board of missing persons. An ocean of faces.

speaker_heading: TRISH

speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 78
speaker_heading: DARRY

speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT

dialog: If you were talking to his

speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT

speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT
dialog: She helped us on a missing

speaker_heading: JEZELLE

speaker_heading: JEZELLE
dialog: And you go do something

dialog: (off their look)
dialog: That dust they got off your

text: Darry and Trish listen to her.
speaker_heading: JEZELLE
dialog: That didn’t come in a dream. I

speaker_heading: JEZELLE

dialog: cats-
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: You called. At the diner, that

speaker_heading: JEZELLE
dialog: I saw those bodies just like

speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 81
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: JEZELLE
dialog: Dreamed it.
dialog: (waits for a response)
dialog: I dream a lot of things.

speaker_heading: JEZELLE
dialog: Those bodies down there. You

speaker_heading: JEZELLE

speaker_heading: JEZELLE

speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: (standing, pointedly)
dialog: I’m gonna be sick. Darry would
dialog: you come and help me throw up,
dialog: please?
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Look this thing has had

dialog: didn't.
text: This makes Jezelle even more uncomfortable. What she now has

speaker_heading: JEZELLE
dialog: (swallows, her eyes
dialog: dampening)
dialog: It's very particular. Only

speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: What?

speaker_heading: OFFICER MCCURRY
dialog: I said heads up, gentlemen.
dialog: Show me some skin.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 86

dialog: ..-A WET SOUND.
text: McCurry follows it. Moves quickly past several more cells.
text: THE SOUND HAS GONE FROM SLURPING TO CRUNCHING....
text: He is at the end of hall now. Approaching the last and
text: darkest cell. The flashlight falling over something McCurry
dialog: cannot believe:
text: The bars to this cell have been bent outward and apart.
text: McCurry fumbles with his free hand to get his service pistol
text: out of his holster. Takes another step:
text: The man in the cell freezes when the beam of light hits him.
text: Dressed in a long black coat. Squatting over something on the
dialog: floor.
dialog: McCurry looks down:
text: The body of AN INMATE lies in a pool of dark blood. At the
text: end of his right leg -the foot has been chewed completely
dialog: off...
text: McCurry in shock.
text: The Figure, ignoring the Officer's presence now, returns to

dialog: motions.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 87

text: His hand gone. A bloody stump adding more crimson to the
dialog: floor.
text: McCurry cocks his pistol. The sound is loud and causes the
text: Figure to turn. Slowly. Until he is staring up at McCurry
text: past the gun barrel.
text: McCurry paralyzed: The Creature's white eyes glaring up at
text: him. Its mouth and chin a bloody mess...
text: McCurry should have fired by now. Too perplexed and horrified
text: at what he is staring at...
text: THWAMM!!! It moves so fast, McCurry only feels the bars of
text: the cell slamming into his face -and service pistol flying
text: out of his hand with the impact.
text: He has been grappled, in a blurring moment of speed, through
text: the bars of the cell by the Creature's one good hand.
text: The other hand: non-existent. Just an empty sleeve as he
text: holds Officer McCurry against those bars.
text: Nose to nose. Surveying the Officer. Those malevolent white
text: eyes staring into him.
text: THE SOUND OF TRICKLING. SOMETHING TRICKLING ONTO THE GROUND.
text: Both cop and Creature look down at the Creature's empty
text: sleeve. A grayish powder trickles out of it.
text: And with it, a new hand. Drops down from inside the sleeve
text: and splays its fingers. Replacing the one pummelled into dust
text: by the tire of Trish's car.
text: The Creature takes McCurry's head in both hands now. Leans
text: in. Close. Closer...
text: And sniffs. Sniffs him. Leans in now. Inhales him. Savoring
text: his scent. -To the Officer's horror and surprise.
scene_heading: LEVELS THOSE MALEVOLENT EYES AT HIM NOW --AND ROARS, THE

text: Pandemonium in the dark. Officers racing toward the end of
dialog: the lobby.
speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT
dialog: (to Trish and Darry)
dialog: Stay here!
text: He runs back down the hall -past Jezelle staring at them.
speaker_heading: JEZELLE
dialog: We gotta get you outta here.
text: She moves fast for a big woman. Heading down the dark
text: corridor. Away from the lobby.
speaker_heading: JEZELLE
dialog: Come on I said!
text: They move with her. Darry taking a final look back at the
text: lobby where Officers now hug the walls. Staring down a
text: corridor that ends in the rear stairwell.
text: The Sergeant stares with the others at the dark stairwell.
text: Illuminated by a single dollop of light from one of the
dialog: emergency overheads.
text: Four cops flank the walls before it. Weapons drawn. The
text: Sergeant hisses an urgent whisper into his walkie.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 92
speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT
dialog: Somebody talk to me down
dialog: there!
speaker_heading: OFFICER ONE

dialog: We have one inmate and an

speaker_heading: OFFICER ONE
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: Ramirez too, he’s hurt bad.
dialog: Son-of-a-bitch tried to take a
dialog: bite out of him!
speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT
dialog: What?!
text: A shadow falling over the stairwell. Someone headed up the
dialog: stairs.
text: MORE GUN SHOTS. Flashes from below etching the shadow which
text: suddenly flickers up the wall and out of view.
text: Officers staring puzzled. Where did this guy go?
speaker_heading: OFFICER ONE
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: This guy is wearing something
dialog: ‘cause we cannot take him
dialog: down! Copy? We cannot take him
dialog: down!
text: They can hear something moving. Getting closer. Guns aimed
dialog: down those dark stairs.
text: One of the Officers, DANE, looks to the Sergeant. Gets a nod.
text: Dane moves forward. Hugging the wall. Very close to the
dialog: stairwell now.
text: Jumps aside the doorway. Braves a look down. Nothing on the
text: stairs. Hears something in the stillness...
text: A sniffing sound. Somewhere in the dark. They can all hear
text: it. Puzzled by it.
text: Down the stairs? Officer Dane looks back at the Sergeant. Not
text: seeing what everyone else does behind him:
text: THE CREATURE’S HEAD DROPPING INTO VIEW FROM ABOVE.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 93
text: Hanging upside down just inside the stairwell doorway! The
dialog: officers swing their guns to this horrible visage when -
dialog: PLOSSHH! ! !
scene_heading: OFFICER DANE’S FACE ERUPTS IN SHOCK! SPRAYED SUDDENLY WITH
text: CRIMSON. HIS CHEST HAS THE CREATURE’S HAND STICKING OUT OF
dialog: IT.
text: HE HAS PUNCHED RIGHT THROUGH IT! In the Creature's horrible
text: hand -THE OFFICER'S STILL-PUMPING HEART!
text: The Creature swings back up out of view. Taking his bloody
text: parcel with him. The men staring ahead in shock.
text: Dane just stares wide-eyed with the hole in his chest.
text: SLURPING AND GARGLING SOUNDS as the unseen Creature ingests
dialog: what onlookers don't want to believe he could be.
text: The heartless Officer tries to say something now but can't
text: manage it. Falls back and tumbles down the stairs.
text: The Desk Sergeant and his men are the color of chalk as they
text: regard each other in the terrible, silent shadows of the dark
dialog: hall....
text: KER-OOSSSHHHHH! !!!! The ceiling over the doorway erupts.
text: Plaster and dust flying everywhere as the Creature blasts
text: through the wall and onto his feet before the startled
text: onlookers.
text: He is instantly moving. Stepping forward in long powerful
text: strides through the dust and the confusion --directly at the
text: Officers and their guns.
text: Everyone opens fire -bullets ripping through the Creature.
text: ONE OFFICER SCREAMS BEHIND HIM -HIS BODY RIDDLED WITH THE
scene_heading: SAME BULLETS --FLYING RIGHT THROUGH THE CREATURE AND INTO
speaker_heading: HIM.
text: The men watch in horror as the Officer flails back and
text: crashes to the floor.
text: The Creature reaches out. Yanks another off his feet.
text: Twitches and convulses as the grip cuts off his air.
text: The Creature still moving. With his other hand, grips the
text: Officer by the groin. Holds him out now. A human shield as he
text: strides down the dark corridor watching the other Officers
text: retreat in shock and confusion.
text: Two Officers behind him, running at him. One has his pistol
text: leveled. The other screaming at him not to shoot.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 94
speaker_heading: OFFICER TWO
dialog: No!!!
text: Charges ahead himself. A flying tackle at the Creature’s
text: back. But it is like hitting a mountain. He hits hard and
text: hangs on -grappling the Creature around the neck.
text: The Creature still moving. Not even slowed. One man hanging
text: on his back and one he still holds in front of him.
dialog: Others retreating. Scared. What the Hell is this thing?!
speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT
dialog: Goddammit !!!
text: The Sergeant remains in the middle of the hall -his revolver
text: aimed at the approaching nightmare.
text: The Officer on the Creature’s back starts to pistol whip him.
text: Desperately trying to stop him. But in a swift and vicious
text: move, it swings around -slamming its back into the nearest
dialog: wall.
text: Slamming it hard. The Officer with it. The plaster on the
text: wall cracks with the impact.
text: The Officer's eyes go wide as he spits blood. He collapses on
text: the floor in a heap as the Creature continues on. His human
text: shield staring at him -eyes bulging. Air still cut off.
speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT
dialog: Goddammit stop!!! You stop
dialog: right fucking there!!!
text: The Creature raises his human shield over his head. Before
text: the men can fire at his exposed chest --hurls the Officer at
dialog: them.
text: But this is no ordinary throw -the man is rocketing down the
text: corridor as if propelled out of a catapult.
text: Men are diving out of his way. One taken out completely.
text: Tumbling down the corridor with him and smashing into a glass
dialog: trophy case.
text: IT CRASHES NOISILY TO THE GROUND ON TOP OF THEM. GLASS AND
text: TROPHIES GOING EVERYWHERE.
scene_heading: INT. POHO SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT BACK HALL. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
text: Trish, Darry and Jezelle hurrying through the darkness. Can
text: hear the chaos in the distance. Come upon a large rear door
text: with a safety bar and an alarm.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 95
text: Darry tries it. Won’t open. Tries it again viciously. Whirls
dialog: to Jezelle.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: This is your way out?!
speaker_heading: JEZELLE
dialog: The doors must lock
text: automatically in a power out.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: You didn’t know that?!
speaker_heading: JEZELLE
dialog: Well I'm sorry honey but I
dialog: can't dream everything now can
dialog: I?
text: Eyes and ears on alert: the distant commotion is suddenly
text: still. Deathly still.
speaker_heading: JEZELLE
dialog: We have to get upstairs!
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: We have to get out!
speaker_heading: JEZELLE
dialog: There’s no other way out down
dialog: here except the front.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: How are we gonna get out from
dialog: upstairs!?
text: Darry sees it first: At the far end of the hall. A familiar
text: silhouette. Still. Impassive.
speaker_heading: JEZELLE
text: Upstairs.
text: Trish and Darry dash up the stairs and The Creature takes off
text: toward them like a rocket.
text: Sprints so fast his coat billows in his wake, like dark wings.
text: Jezelle just kneels. No chance she could make it up those
text: stairs fast enough. Instead, bows her head in prayer as the
text: Creature races toward her.
speaker_heading: JEZELLE
dialog: Our Father who art in Heaven,
dialog: hallowed be Thy name...
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 96
text: The Creature is so close she can feel his wind... can feel it
text: blasting past her.
text: Her moment of doom has passed quickly. She turns and sees the
text: Creature racing up the stairs at top speed.
scene_heading: INT. SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT SECOND STORY. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
text: Trish and Darry running for their lives. Where to they don’t
text: know. The corridors are dark and maze-like.
text: Stopping finally. Confused whether to keep moving or find a
dialog: place and hide.
text: They don’t have to think long. The Creature roars into view
text: ahead of them and they start a nightmare flight back into the
dialog: maze.
text: The Creature pursues with incredible speed. The kids
text: practically falling around corners they are running so fast.
text: Behind them like some Dark Avenger, the Creature soars.
text: Gaining. Always gaining.
text: Rounds another corner and halts: The kids gone. Several doors
text: they could've slipped into. He chooses one.
text: The Creature in the doorway. This is an interrogation room.
text: Dark and empty. Caught by its own reflection in the large
text: mirror on the wall.
text: A two-way mirror. On the other side, Trish and Darry,
text: watching breathless. Terrified as the Creature surveys the
text: mirror and steps toward it.
text: The kids silent. Holding each other. The terrible visage of
text: the Thing pressed against the glass now. Does it sense
dialog: something behind it?
text: Those white eyes staring in. As if they could see through it.
text: And then its tongue comes out. Long. Licks the glass from low
text: to high in some horrible, pre-culinary gesture.
text: Trish and Darry watching with repulsion. Then relief. Having
text: left a snail trail on the mirror, the Creature is turning
text: away. Turning away from the mirror and-
text: KER-TASSSSHHH! !!! The plexi-window explodes as the Creature
text: crashes through it. Trish and Darry scrambling back in a
text: blind panic and a shower of glass.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 97
text: The Creature in the center of the room. Poised like an
text: animal, ready to pounce.
text: Trish and Darry can barely move. Paralyzed with fear as the
text: Thing steps closer. Backs them to the wall. Brother and
dialog: sister, side by side.
text: Those hideous milky eyes glare at Trish. Burning into her.
text: Watches as he inches closer.
text: Darry starts to move. Pinned against the wall instantly by
text: the Creature's iron grip. Pinned there watching as the
text: Creature moves even closer to his sister.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: (barely a whisper)
dialog: Darry...
text: Nose to nose now they are so close. She can feel the horrid
text: stench of his cannibal breath. Its horrible, raspy whisper
dialog: now:
speaker_heading: THE CREATURE
dialog: Sister, sister...
text: Watches in terror as it gets so close she thinks it might
dialog: kiss her...
text: But it sniffs her instead.
text: Short little sniffs at first. Darry and Trish watching this
dialog: in horror.
text: Then sniffs long and deep as Trish stares full of fear, into
dialog: those horrible eyes.
text: Eyes that close as another deep inhale commences. They open
text: again -abruptly. Stares at her a moment longer and tosses her
dialog: aside.
text: The Creature instantly on Darry. Nose to nose. A big deep
text: inhale as little brother watches. Tries to find his sister,
text: somewhere on the floor. His whisper like a child's.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Please let me smell bad...
dialog: Please let me smell bad,
dialog: Trish...
text: Another long inhale. This time, the Creature’s head drops
dialog: back.
text: Darry can see the nostrils. Flaring. Fluttering. Nostrils
dialog: don’t flutter.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 98
text: They do it again. As if the scent they were sampling, sent
text: his nostrils into uncontrollable twitching....
dialog: There can be no doubt, as the Creature levels those eyes at
dialog: Darry -that it has found what it wants. Something about or
text: inside him it finds irresistible...
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Its gonna eat me Trish....
dialog: This motherfucker’s gonna eat
dialog: me....
text: CLINK CLANK! RIFLES BEING COCKED. BIG ONES.
text: The Creature halts but doesn’t turn. The shattered window to
text: the other room is filled with FOUR OFFICERS IN RIOT GEAR. The
dialog: Sergeant their leader.
speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT
text: Step away from the kid.
text: The Creature still doesn’t move. Stares at Darry.
speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT
dialog: (cont‘d)
dialog: Darius? Just step this way
dialog: with your sister.
text: Darry stares at the Creature for a long moment. Then slowly,
text: inches down the wall. The Creature watching him.
text: Once out from under him, Darry scrambles to Trish and they
text: fly out the door into the hall. The Creature turns toward
text: them, but all rifles raise.
text: The Creature slowly raises his head -eyes glaring at them
text: from an angry furrowed brow that seems to say Who in the
dialog: fuck do you think you are?
text: The Creature roars toward them and the guns blaze.
scene_heading: INT. POHO SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT STAIRWELL. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
text: AS THE SOUNDS OF A WAR RAGE OVERHEAD, Trish and Darry
text: scramble down a stairwell that empties into the dark lobby.
text: Halted by the bodies scattered everywhere. Like a massacre.
text: ONE BODY sticking half out a plexi-glass window he was thrown
dialog: through.
text: A BODY at the corner of the Sergeant’s desk is just a torso.
dialog: His bottom half no where to be seen...
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 99
text: Trish and Darry blast forward. Sprinting through the
text: atrocities and toward the entrance. The glass doors -also
text: shattered by AN OFFICER'S BODY hanging half in and out.
text: They step over him and out to the parking lot.
scene_heading: EXT. POHO COUNTY SHERIFF'S BLDG. EXT. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
text: Trish and Darry searching frantically for their car. They see
text: Jezelle’s Winnebago. But not a sign of their own vehicle. No
dialog: way to drive out of here.
text: Except for the Creature’s black van still idling in the
text: corner of the lot.
text: MORE GUNSHOT BLASTS and flashes from the second story.
text: To Darry, the choice is simple. He is sprinting toward the
dialog: van.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: No!
text: Little brother sprints to the driver door and throws it open.
text: A STENCH SO FOUL meets him that he has to grimace. Thinks
dialog: twice about this now.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: I am not doing this Darry!
text: KA-TASSSHHHH! !!!! TWO OFFICERS COME CRASHING OUT A SECOND
scene_heading: STORY WINDOW.
speaker_heading: DARRY (cont'd)
dialog: Trisha! !!!!
text: Before their bodies can even hit the ground, Darry braves the
text: stench. Leaps up into the driver’s seat. Reaches
text: instinctively for the ignition. No key. The van is running
text: without a key in the ignition.
text: Clutches the gear shift. Sticky. Looks at his palm. Sticky,
text: congealed, crimson goo.
text: Its like a thin film over everything.
text: The passenger door flies open. Trish reaching out for
text: brother’s hand. Halting with the stench. Staring at him.
text: He just gives her arm a good yank and she is up and flying
text: into the seat. The van rattling with her weight. And sounding
dialog: like a windchime?
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 100
text: They look behind them and see why: the van walls are lined
text: with an incredible and grizzly array of spears, axes and
dialog: knives.
text: All hanging from mounted hooks -THE WEAPONS CLANKING AND
text: TINKLING TOGETHER WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THE VAN.
text: Blades all stained by an eternity of atrocities.
text: The Creature appears now. On the roof of the building. Darry
text: staring in horror at him from the van window. Even at this
text: distance, caught in his terrifying, demon-blind glare.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: What the Hell are you waiting
dialog: for?!
text: Darry grapples the sticky gear shift again -tries to get it
text: in first. THE GEARS GRIND -SHRIEKING AS IF THEY WERE SOULS
scene_heading: BEING TORTURED.
text: The Creature vaults forward. Leaping impossibly off the roof
text: of the building and onto the roof of Jezelle’s Winnebago.
text: Landing on his feet. Glaring at Darry. Starting across the
dialog: parking lot.
text: Not on the ground. He has leapt into the air and is leaping
text: from police car roof to police car roof with each stride.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Hang on!
text: Damned gears. They grind away.
text: Trish staring back -the Creature leaping from car to car like
text: some nightmare gymnast. Its tattered coat flapping like dark,
text: distressed wings.
text: Darry finally forces the gearshift forward. Doesn’t know if
dialog: he’s in first or not. Guns it.
text: It lurches roughly and stops. Must be in second.
text: The Creature hits one final car top and vaults into space-
text: directly at them.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Darry!!!
text: The van lurches forward again. Moving now but not fast.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 101
text: KE--RONKKK!!! The Creature smacks into the side of the van.
text: His face rearing up into Darry’s window. Staring in. Darry
text: terrified. Still trying to get up speed.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Give me something!!
text: Trish out of her seat. The van lurching again. Throws her
text: into the back. Tries to keep her balance. SPEARS AND BATTLE
text: AXES CLANGING ALL AROUND HER.
text: The Creature rakes his claw-like fingers across the glass in
text: a circular motion. Slicing into it with A HORRIBLE SHRIEKING
speaker_heading: SOUND!
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Get me something! !!!
text: The Creature rears his hand back -ready to strike the circle
text: he has scored in the glass...
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Trish-
text: Something smacks into the palm of Darry's hand. He doesn’t
text: even take time to see what it is. Just swings it at the
dialog: window hard.
text: KER-TASSHHH!!!! He hits the Creature directly in the face
text: with a small combination hatchet/hammer.
text: Glass flying out everywhere as the Creature drops off the
text: van. Crashing to earth as Darry speeds away.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Yesss!ii!ii!!
text: Trish watching. Wants to smile too. Shout with joy like her
dialog: brother.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: (shouting into the
dialog: rearview)
dialog: Motherfucker! !!!!
text: But instead Trish stares out the back windows of the van.
text: Watching the dazed Creature raising his head. Staring after
text: them as they get further and further away.
text: Darry guns the engine. The van is really moving now. Roaring
text: away from the Sheriff's building and down the empty two lane.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 102
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Darry...
text: A warning from sis. Brother checks out the rearview: the
text: distant Creature is on his feet now. And running.
text: Running toward them.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: (his smile more manic now)
dialog: He’s kidding right?
text: In his rearview: the Creature sprinting after them. Sprinting
dialog: like Hell.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: He’s not getting smaller...
text: He is actually gaining on them. His legs a blur of darkness
text: he is coming so fast.
text: Darry checking the speedometer: the van is doing 120 miles an
text: hour. And the Creature is gaining on him.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: You mother.....
text: Darry’s foot flattening the gas pedal. To the floorboards.
text: The old van shakes and quakes at this velocity. THE SPEARS
text: AND AXES CLANKING NOISILY.
text: Then another impossible nightmare: the sprinting Creature,
text: without slowing down- throws himself forward like an acrobat
dialog: doing a running tumble--
text: But when he completes his flip -landing on his feet again- he
text: uses the momentum to push off. And in an affront to gravity
text: everywhere: rockets himself up into the night sky.
text: Up and gone. Out of view. Brother and sister both saw it.
dialog: Look to each other.
text: WHOMP!!! SOMETHING HITS THE ROOF OF THE VAN HARD. AFFECTS
text: THE VAN’S TRAJECTORY. IT WEAVES ACROSS THE ROAD. DARRY TRYING
text: TO WIN BACK CONTROL.
text: KA-RANKK!!!! The Creature's battle axe punches a hole in the
text: top of the van, right in front of Darry’s face.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Trish!!!
text: She scrambles for one of the spears. Grabs a shorter one.
text: Thrusts it straight up. Over her brother's head.
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 103
text: THWAAMMPPPP!!! Pierces the roof and puncture’s the
text: creature’s head. Directly above the eyes!
text: The Creature loses his grip on the van, slides back and off,
text: falling onto the road again.
text: Darry watching in the rearview.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Yes!!!
text: Hits the asphalt hard. The spear dislodges as it rolls over
text: and over down the two lane.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Yessss!!!
text: Rolls and rolls and suddenly leaps up, lands on his feet and
dialog: keeps on coming!
text: Darry’s enthusiasm gone. Just watches breathless as this
text: inhuman thing comes at them again!
text: The Creature has never moved faster. So fast powder is coming
text: off his skin, a skin being eaten away by the actual wind
dialog: shear at this velocity.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Yeah! Burn your ass up you son-
dialog: of-a-bitch!
text: He is like a comet now -a rocket of dust blasting down the
text: highway toward the van.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Watch it...
text: Trish scrambling for another weapon.
text: THE CREATURE’S VELOCITY IS MAKING ITS OWN HISSING SOUND...
text: Brother and sister listening to it grow LOUDER AND LOUDER.
text: Trish with an angry looking battle axe at the ready. Sees the
text: SCREAMING dust storm is almost upon them.
text: KA-POOOMMM!!!! The back doors blast inward as the Creature
text: explodes into the van.
text: Trish thrown ahead against the dash. Darry losing control
text: again. The van hits the shoulder of the road hard!
text: Inside the Creature advances. Trish lurching forward with an
text: axe at the ready for him. She swings it:
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 104
text: THWOCK!!! HIS HEAD IS NEATLY SLICED OFF. Leaves a small puff
text: of dust at his neck as it rolls right out the back of the van
text: and down the highway.
text: The Creature’s headless body staggering back. Trish staring
text: at it. Charges ahead with the same weapon and hurls it!
text: Direct hit! Knocks the torso back out the doors.
text: It hits the asphalt hard and goes rolling and rolling in
text: sporadic puffs of dust...
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Yes!!!
text: The van roars ahead. In the distance. A TRAIN WHISTLE. Darry
text: listening to it. Looks at his sister.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Where is he?!
text: Trish takes no time to stare out the windows again.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: He’s dead! He doesn’t have a
dialog: head!!!
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: He’s not!
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Darry! He doesn’t have a
dialog: fucking head!!
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: He’s not!
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: How’s he supposed to eat any
dialog: thing without a head?!!!
text: Brother and sister staring breathless at each other. Darry’s
text: words are calm now. Almost whispered.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: He’s not gonna stop.
dialog: (emphatically)
dialog: He is never gonna stop,
dialog: Trish!!!
text: The Railway crossing ahead. The CLANKING SOUND of the WARNING
text: BELLS and the Automatic arms.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Get out!
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 105
dialog: She can’t believe he said this.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: I mean it, get out!
dialog: (off her incredulous look)
dialog: There’s grass over there!
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: He’s dead!
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: He’s not! We both know he’s
dialog: not!
text: THE TRAIN HORN BLASTS NOW. A warning it is almost to the
dialog: crossing.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Do it!!
text: WHOMP!!!! SOMETHING AGAIN HITS THE ROOF HARD. THEY BOTH LOOK
dialog: TO EACH OTHER!
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: TRISH! !!!
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: What the Hell’re you gonna
dialog: do?!
text: KA-RANNKKK!!!! Down comes the Creature’s hand again, making a
text: larger hole in the roof of the van, grappling for Darry’s
dialog: head.
text: It finds him. Holds on tight. Darry screaming. Trish races
dialog: forward.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Look out!!!
text: She swings the axe again! THWOMP!!! The hand grappling her
text: brother is severed. It falls to the ground and she kicks it
text: out the back of the van.
text: It hits hard in a cloud of dust...
text: Up top: the armless, headless Creature reaches down again
text: with his one remaining arm...
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Goddammit Trish, I’m not doing
dialog: this for nothing-
speaker_heading: JEEPERS CREEPERS 106
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: You're not doing anything
dialog: without me!
text: She takes another long sharp spear and thrusts it through the
text: roof of the van.
text: Up top: the spear-head pierces the Creature’s headless torso,
text: pinning it to the top of the van.
text: This makes him more angry. His remaining arm reaching down
text: for Darry -grapples with new violence for his head. Finds it.
text: Darry trying to wrench it off him. It starts to pull him
dialog: upward.
text: Trish runs forward with her axe but little brother surprises
text: her. Grabs her arm and pulls her onto his lap.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Darry!
text: Forces the axe out of her hand. Kicks open his door. Looks
text: terrified as he flashes a last look at her.
speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: Bye sis-
text: Throws his sister out of the van. She screams as she hits
text: soft grass and rolls and rolls.
text: The train is upon them. WARNING BELLS DEAFENING. LIGHTS
text: FLASHING.
text: And Darry clutching the arm of the Creature as tight as he
text: can. The creature lifting him -up out of his seat.
text: Darry fighting it. Bracing himself with his hands against the

speaker_heading: DARRY
dialog: You got me?! You got me you son-of-
