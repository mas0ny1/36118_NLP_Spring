dialog: should ask ourselves the one most
dialog: important question: What is the
dialog: purpose of these years, the purpose
dialog: for all this demanding work,
dialog: the purpose for the sacrifices
dialog: made those who love us? Were
dialog: there NOT a purpose, then all of
dialog: these past years of struggle, of
dialog: fierce competition and of uncom-
dialog: promising ambition would be mean-
dialog: ingless. But, of course, there
dialog: is a purpose and I must tell it
dialog: to you. I ask you to remember
dialog: this purpose always and I pledge
dialog: that I shall endeavor to carry it
dialog: with me forever.

speaker_heading: SNAPPED OFF.
speaker_heading: MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
dialog: What's the matter?

speaker_heading: MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
dialog: The guests are all downstairs,

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Look, Dad - could you explain to
dialog: them that I have to be alone for
dialog: a while?
speaker_heading: MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
dialog: These are all our good friends,
dialog: Ben. Most of them have known you
dialog: since - well - practically since
dialog: you were born.
text: Ben has not moved. Now the bed on which he is lying moves
text: as though someone has sat down upon it next to him.
speaker_heading: MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
dialog: What is it, Ben?
text: The CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL BACK SLOWLY.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I'm just -
speaker_heading: MR. BRADDOCK

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Well -
speaker_heading: MR. BRADDOCK
dialog: About what?
dialog: Ben
dialog: I guess - about my future.
speaker_heading: MR. BRADDOCK
dialog: What about it?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I don't know. I want it to be -
speaker_heading: MR. BRADDOCK
dialog: To be what?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Different.
text: As Ben says this, the door to the bedroom opens and
text: MRS. BRADDOCK looks in.
speaker_heading: MRS. BRADDOCK
dialog: Is anything wrong?
speaker_heading: MR. BRADDOCK
dialog: No! No - we're just on our way

speaker_heading: MR. CARLSON

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: MR. CARLSON
dialog: The girls. The chicks. The -
dialog: the teeny boppers.
speaker_heading: MRS. CARLSON
dialog: I think Ben has gotten beyond
dialog: the teeny bopper stage - haven't
dialog: you, Ben?
text: Mrs. Carlson gives Ben a broad wink. Ben tries to smile
dialog: and return the wink politely.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
text: They reach the hall at the bottom of the stairs.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Excuse me - I think I'd just
dialog: like to check something on
dialog: the car for a minute -

text: steps into the house and grabs Ben's hand.
speaker_heading: MR. LOOMIS
dialog: Here's the track star himself.
dialog: How are you, track star?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Just fine, Mr. Loomis.

dialog: award.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Helpingham.
speaker_heading: MR. LOOMIS
dialog: Helpingham! Right! Now you
dialog: wait right here.
text: Mr. Loomis turns and goes into the dining room. Ben

speaker_heading: LADY 1
dialog: Ben - we're all so proud of
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: LADY 2
dialog: Proud, proud, proud, proud,
dialog: proud.
speaker_heading: LADY 3
dialog: What are you going to do now?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I was going to go upstairs for a
dialog: minute -
speaker_heading: LADY 3
dialog: No - I meant with your future.
speaker_heading: LADY 2
dialog: With your life.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Well - that's a little hard to say -

speaker_heading: MR. MCQUIRE
dialog: Ben - I just want to say one word to
dialog: you - just one word -
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: MR. MCQUIRE
dialog: Are you listening?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Yes I am.
speaker_heading: MR. MCQUIRE
dialog: (gravely)
dialog: Plastics.
text: They look at each other for a moment.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Exactly how do you mean?
speaker_heading: MR. MCQUIRE
dialog: There is a great future in plastics.
dialog: Think about it. Will you think
dialog: about it?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Yes, I will.
speaker_heading: MR. MCQUIRE
dialog: Okay. Enough said. That's a deal.

speaker_heading: WOMAN #1

scene_heading: 31	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - NIGHT
dialog: We can see through the windows of the house, Ben making his

text: They stand for a moment, loocking at each other.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: How are you, Benjamin?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Fine, thank you. The bathroom is
text: down at the end of the hall.
text: Mrs. Robinson moves into the room and sits on the edge
dialog: of the bed.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Look, Mrs. Robinson, I don't
dialog: mean to be rude but -
text: Mrs. Robinson takes a cigarette from her purse and
dialog: lights it.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Is there an ashtray in here?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Oh - I forgot. The track star
dialog: doesn't smoke.
text: She blows out the match and puts it down carefully on
text: the bedspread. Ben picks up a wastebasket, walks over
text: to the bed, picks up the match and puts it in the
dialog: wastebasket.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Is it a girl?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Is what a girl?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Whatever it is you're upset
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Oh - no. I'm just sort of
dialog: disturbed about things.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: In general.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: That's right.

dialog: something.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Will you take me home?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: My husband took the car. Will
dialog: you drive me home?
text: Ben reaches into his pocket and hands Mrs. Robinson
dialog: a set of car keys.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Here - you take it.
text: Mrs. Robinson looks at him.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Do you know how to work a
dialog: foreign shift?
text: Mrs. Robinson shakes her head.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You don't?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: No.
dialog: (there is a pause)
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Let's go.

text: and opens the door.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Will you come in, please?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: I want you to come in till I get
dialog: the lights on.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Because I don't feel safe until
dialog: I get the lights on.
text: They move to the door. She takes out her key and opens
dialog: the door.
scene_heading: 36	INT. ROBINSON HALL AND SUNROOM - NIGHT
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Would you mind walking ahead of
dialog: me to the sun porch. I feel
dialog: funny about coming into a dark
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: But it's light in there now.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Please.
text: Ben turns and walks down the hall. They enter sunroom.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: What do you drink? Bourbon?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Look - I drove you home. I was
dialog: glad to do it. But I have some
dialog: things on my mind. Can you
dialog: understand that?
dialog: She nods.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: All right then.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: What do you drink?
text: He looks at her.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Benjamin - I'm sorry to be this
dialog: way, but I don't want to be
dialog: alone in this house.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Please wait till my husband
dialog: gets home.
speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: I don't know.
text: She pours herself a drink.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Drink?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No.
text: She hands him a drink. There is a pause.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Are you always this much afraid
dialog: of being alone?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Well, why can't you just lock
dialog: the doors and go to bed?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: I'm very nuerotic.
text: She turns on the phonograph. SOUND of PHONOGRAPH.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: May I ask you a question?
text: Ben looks at her.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: What do you think of me?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: You've known me nearly all of
dialog: your life. You must have
dialog: formed some opinion.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Well - I've always thought
dialog: that you were a very - nice -
dialog: person.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Did you know I was an alcoholic?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Did you know that?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Look - I think I should be
dialog: going -
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Sit down, Benjamin.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Mrs. Robinson - if you don't
dialog: mind my saying so - this
dialog: conversation is getting a
dialog: little strange. Now I'm sure
dialog: that Mr. Robinson will be here
dialog: any minute and -
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: My husband will be back quite
dialog: late.
text: They look at each other. Ben is half standing.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: He should be gone for several
dialog: hours.
text: She takes a step toward him. He puts his hand up and
text: retreats around the other side of the chair.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Oh my God.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Pardon?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -
dialog: I mean you didn't expect -
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I mean - you didn't really
dialog: think that I would do something
dialog: like that.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Well I don't know.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson,
dialog: here we are, you've got me into
dialog: your house. You give me a
dialog: drink. You put on music, now
dialog: you start opening up your
dialog: personal life to me and tell
dialog: me your husband won't be home
dialog: for hours.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Mrs. Robinson - you are trying
dialog: to seduce me.
text: There is a pause. She looks at him.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (weaker)
dialog: Aren't you?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Why no. I hadn't thought of it.
dialog: I feel rather flattered that
dialog: you -
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive
dialog: me for what I just said?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: It's all right.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: It's not all right, it's the
dialog: worst thing I've ever said
dialog: to anyone.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Sit down.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Please forgive me. Because I
dialog: like you. I don't think of you
dialog: that way. But I'm mixed up.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: All right. Now finish your drink.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick
dialog: that I said that to you.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: We'll forget it right now.
dialog: Finish your drink.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What is wrong with me?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Have you ever seen Elaine's
dialog: portrait?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Her portrait?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: We had it done last Christmas.
dialog: Would you like to see it?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Very much.
dialog: We move with Mrs. Robinson and Ben out of the sunroom,
text: into the hall, up the stairs and along the hall to
text: the doorway to Elaine's room.
scene_heading: 37	INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Ben moves into the room and looks up at the portrait.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Elaine certainly is an
dialog: attractive girl, isn't she?
text: In the b.g. Mrs. Robinson watches him.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (looking at the
dialog: portrait)
dialog: I don't remember her as having
dialog: brown eyes.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Benjamin?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Will you unzip my dress?
text: He steps back.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: I think I'll go to bed.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Oh. Well, goodnight.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Won't you unzip my dress?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: If you still think I'm trying
dialog: to seduce you -
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No, I don't. But I just feel
dialog: a little funny.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Benjamin - you've known me all
dialog: your life.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I know that. But I'm -
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Come on.
text: She turns her back.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: It's hard for me to reach.
text: Ben reaches forward and pulls the zipper down.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Right.
text: Ben walks toward the door.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: What are you so scared of?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Then why do you keep running
dialog: away?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Because you're going to bed. I
dialog: don't think I should be up here.
text: Mrs. Robinson lets her dress fall to the floor.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Haven't you ever seen anybody
dialog: in a slip before?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Yes, I have -
text: He looks up at the portrait of Elaine.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: But I just - Look - what if Mr.
dialog: Robinson walked in right now?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: What if he did?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Well, it would look pretty
dialog: funny, wouldn't it?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Don't you think he trusts us
dialog: together?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Of course he does. But he
dialog: might get the wrong idea.
dialog: Anyone might.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: I don't see why. I'm twice as
dialog: old as you are. How could
dialog: anyone think -
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: But they would! Don't you see?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Benjamin - I'm not trying to
dialog: seduce you. I wish you'd -
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I know that. But please, Mrs.
dialog: Robinson. This is difficult
dialog: for me.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Why is it?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Because I am confused about
dialog: things. I can't tell what
dialog: I'm imagining. I can't tell
dialog: what's real. I can't -
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Would you like me to seduce you?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Is that what you're trying to
dialog: tell me?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I'm going home now. I apologize
dialog: for what I said. I hope you can
dialog: forget it. But I'm going home

dialog: apparatus in it.
text: SOUND: the rythmic PUMPING of air, obliterating the
dialog: SOUND of the people around the pool who seem to be
text: applauding and chattering noiselessly.
text: We MOVE out of the door and toward the pool. Mr. Braddock
text: is running back and forth, clapping his hands and
text: delivering his now soundless pitch.
text: We MOVE DOWN the steps and into the shallow end of the
text: pool. Mr. Braddock is moving along the side of the pool,

text: joins Mr. Arnold at the far end of the pool. They both
dialog: begin to motion us toward them.
dialog: We get to the deep end of the pool. Mr. Braddock signals

text: under. He has a big smile.
dialog: We SURFACE again and PAN AROUND for a last look. The

dialog: of Mrs. Arnold and Mrs. Braddock, watching and smiling;
text: the neighbors on each side of the house, looking over their

text: and says something to the CLERK behind the desk.
text: The clerk points across the lobby and says something to
dialog: him. There are the SOUNDS of an orchestra PLAYING some-

speaker_heading: BEN

dialog: possibly --
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Are you afraid of me?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No - but look - maybe we could

speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Benjamin, is this your first time?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Is this - what?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: It is, isn't it? It is your

speaker_heading: BEN

dialog: You walk right out the door.
dialog: She nods.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What do you say to him?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: He's asleep.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Always?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Benjamin, this isn't a very
dialog: interesting topic.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Please. Now tell me. How do
dialog: you know he won't wake up
dialog: sometime and follow you.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Because he takes sleeping pills.
dialog: He takes three sleeping pills
dialog: every night at ten o'clock.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: But what about the noise from
dialog: the car. What if -
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: The driveway's on my side of
dialog: the house.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: We're talking.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: We're talking, Mrs. Robinson.
dialog: We're talking.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Calm down, Benjamin.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Now let's keep going here.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Can I undress and talk at the
dialog: same time?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Now. You say the driveway's on
dialog: your side of the house. So I
dialog: guess you don't sleep in the
dialog: same room.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: We don't.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: So you don't - I mean I don't
dialog: like to seem like I'm prying
dialog: but I guess you don't sleep
dialog: together or anything.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: No we don't.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Well how long has this been going
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: (looking at the
dialog: ceiling for a moment)
dialog: About five years.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Oh no. Are you kidding me?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You have not slept with your
dialog: husband for five years?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Now and then. He geats drunk a
dialog: few times a year.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: How many times a year.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on
dialog: his birthday.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Man, is this interesting.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Is it?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: So you don't love him. You
dialog: wouldn't say you -
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: We've talked enough, Benjamin.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Wait a minute. So you wouldn't
dialog: say you loved him.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Not exactly.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: But you don't hate him.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: No, Benjamin. I don't hate him.
dialog: Unhook my blouse.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (unhooking her blouse)
dialog: Well how do you feel about him,
dialog: then?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: I don't.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Well that's kind of a bad
dialog: situation then, isn't it?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Is it?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I mean it doesn't sound like it
dialog: could be much worse. If you
dialog: hated him at least you'd hate
dialog: him.
text: She nods and takes off her blouse.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Well you loved him once, I
dialog: assume. When you first knew
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: I never did, Benjamin. Now
dialog: let's -
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Well, wait a minute. You married
dialog: him.
dialog: She nods.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Why did you do that?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: (taking off her
dialog: stockings)
dialog: See if you can guess.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Well I can't.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Think real hard, Benjamin.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I can't see why you did, unless
dialog: ...you didn't have to marry him
dialog: or anything, did you?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Don't tell Elaine.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Oh no. You had to marry him
dialog: because you got pregnant?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Are you shocked?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Well I never thought of you and
dialog: Mr. Robinson as the kind of
dialog: people who...
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: All right. Now let's get to bed.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
dialog: So how did it happen?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I mean do you feel like telling
dialog: me what were the circumstances?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Not particularly.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Was he a law student at the time?
dialog: She nods.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: And you were a student also.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: At college.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What was your major?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Why are you asking me all this?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson.
dialog: Now what was your major subject
dialog: at college?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Art.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Art?
dialog: She nods.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: But I thought you - I guess you
dialog: kind of lost interest in it over
dialog: the years then.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Kind of.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Well how did it happen?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: How do you think.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I mean did he take you up to
dialog: his room with him? Did you go
dialog: to a hotel?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Benjamin, what does it possibly
dialog: matter?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I'm curious.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: We'd go to his car.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Oh no. In the car you did it?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: I don't think we were the first.
text: Ben thinks for a moment.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What kind of car was it?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Do you remember the make of the
dialog: car?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Oh my God.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Really. I want to know.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: It was a Ford, Benjamin.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (jumping up)
dialog: A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a
dialog: Ford! That's great!
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: That's enough.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: So old Elaine Robinson got started
dialog: in a Ford.
dialog: There is a pause.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Don't talk about Elaine.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Don't talk about Elaine?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Because I don't want you to.
text: She walks to the bed.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Well why don't you?
text: She pulls the bedspread down. Ben begins to remove his
dialog: jacket.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I wish you'd tell me.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: There's nothing to tell.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Well why is she a big taboo
dialog: subject all of a sudden?
text: Mrs. Robinson uncovers one of the pillows.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Well - I guess I'll have to ask
dialog: her out on a date and find out
dialog: what's --
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Benjamin, don't you ever take
dialog: that girl out.
text: Ben looks at her.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Do you understand that?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Well look. I have no intention
dialog: of taking her out.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I was just kidding around.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: But why shouldn't I?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: I have my reasons.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Then let's hear them.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Let's hear your reasons, Mrs.
dialog: Robinson. Because I think I
dialog: know what they are.
text: She pulls the covers down.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I'm not good enough for her to
dialog: associate with, am I? I'm not
dialog: good enough to even talk about
dialog: her, am I?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Let's drop it.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: We're not dropping it. Now
dialog: that's the reason, isn't it?
dialog: I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't
dialog: I? I'm not fit to -
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Benjamin?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I'm good enough for you but I'm
dialog: too slimy to associate with
dialog: your daughter. That's it, isn't
dialog: it? ISN'T IT?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You go to hell. You go straight
dialog: to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you
dialog: think I'm proud of myself? Do
dialog: you think I'm proud of this?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: I wouldn't know.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Well, I'm not.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: You're not.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No sir. I am not proud that I
dialog: spend my time with a broken-
dialog: down alcoholic!
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: And if you think I come here
dialog: for any reason besides pure
dialog: boredom, then you're all wrong.
dialog: She nods.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Because - Mrs. Robinson this
dialog: is the sickest, most perverted
dialog: thing that ever happened to
dialog: me. And you do what you want
dialog: but I'm getting the hell out.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Are you?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You're goddamn right I am.
text: He starts putting on his shirt. She sits on the edge of
text: the bed and watches him.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: That's how you feel about me.
dialog: He nods.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: That I'm a sick and disgusting
dialog: person.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Now don't start this.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Don't start acting hurt.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Don't you expect me to be a
dialog: little hurt?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Mrs. Robinson, you stand there
dialog: and tell me I'm not good enough
dialog: for your daughter.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Did I say that?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Of course you did.
text: She shakes her head.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Benjamin, I want to apologize
dialog: to you if that's the impression
dialog: you got.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Well two minutes ago you told
dialog: me I wasn't good enough for
dialog: your daughter. Now you say
dialog: you're sorry I got that
dialog: impression.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: I didn't mean it. I don't think
dialog: you'd be right for each other.
dialog: But I would never say you
dialog: weren't as good a person as
dialog: she is.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You wouldn't.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Of course I wouldn't.
text: Mrs. Robinson walks to the closet.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Well it's pretty obvious you
dialog: don't want me around any more.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Well look - I was kind of upset
dialog: there. I'm sorry I said those
dialog: things.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: If that's how you feel -
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: But it's not.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: (smiling at him)
dialog: That's all right. I think I
dialog: can understand why I'm disgusting
dialog: to you.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Oh no. Look - I like you. I
dialog: wouldn't keep coming here if
dialog: I didn't like you.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: But if it's sickening for you -
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: It's not! I enjoy it! I look
dialog: forward to it. It's the one
dialog: thing I have to look forward
dialog: to.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: You don't have to say that.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Well I wouldn't. I would never
dialog: say it if it wasn't true.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: May I stay then?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Yes. Please. I want you to.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Well don't thank me, because I
dialog: want you to.
text: There is a long pause.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: But you won't ever take out
dialog: Elaine, will you? I want you
dialog: to promise me that.
text: There is another long pause.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Look. Why the hell did you
dialog: bring this up. It never
dialog: occured to me to take her out.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Then give me your word you won't.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: This is absurd.
speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON
dialog: Promise me, Benjamin.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: All right, for christ's sake.
dialog: I promise I will never take

speaker_heading: MRS. ROBINSON

text: in their bathing suits, are in the pool, paddling around
dialog: Ben. During the entire conversation they continue to
text: swim around and around the raft, trying to talk and keep
text: their heads above the surface.
speaker_heading: MRS. BRADDOCK
dialog: It's pretty embarrassing. I
dialog: really don't know what to tell
dialog: Mr. Robinson. It's ackward
dialog: and strained for me every time
dialog: he suggests that you call up
dialog: Elaine.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Next time he suggests it,
dialog: I'll tell him I have no
dialog: intention of ever calling
dialog: her up in my life.
speaker_heading: MR. BRADDOCK
dialog: I guess she's not good enough
dialog: for you, is that it?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Look - Elaine Robinson and I
dialog: do not get along.
speaker_heading: MR. BRADDOCK
dialog: How do you know? You haven't
dialog: seen her since high school. I
dialog: guess your evenings, whatever
dialog: you do with them, are just too
dialog: valuable.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: That has nothing to do with it -
speaker_heading: MR. BRADDOCK
dialog: I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson
dialog: that you're just too busy every
dialog: evening - doing God knows what -
speaker_heading: MRS. BRADDOCK
dialog: Don't go on like this. Now if
dialog: Benjamin absolutely refuses to
dialog: take her out -
speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: MRS. BRADDOCK

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Then what?
speaker_heading: ELAINE

speaker_heading: ELAINE

speaker_heading: BEN
