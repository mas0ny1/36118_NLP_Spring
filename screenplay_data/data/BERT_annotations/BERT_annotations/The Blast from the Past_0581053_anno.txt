speaker_heading: FADE IN:
speaker_heading: SCENE 1 OMITTED
scene_heading: EXT. SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - NIGHT
text: OPEN on a MOVING WIDE SHOT of a mountain range with the
text: distant lights of the San Fernando Valley behind it.
text: BEGIN CREDITS as a NAVY JET drops down into the picture.
text: PUSH IN on the jet's exhaust flame. Have the words "THE
text: BLAST" come out of the flame. Then there is a SLIGHT
text: EXPLOSION and the flame intensifies. The words "FROM THE
text: PAST" jump out of the exhaust as the jet momentarily
dialog: shakes.
scene_heading: INT. JET
text: The PILOT feels the jet shake. But he looks at his
text: indicators and everything appears to be normal. He
text: relaxes.
scene_heading: EXT. JET
text: We begin with a WIDER REAR SHOT of the jet and allow the
text: plane to move away. Then SUPER: "LOS ANGELES, 1962"
text: before continuing the main titles. A popular recording
dialog: from that period has been playing throughout.
scene_heading: EXT. CALVIN'S WORK SHOP - NIGHT
text: Start on a CU of the HAM RADIO ANTENNA, WIND GAUGE and
text: THERMOMETER attached to the roof of Calvin's shop. (We
text: can hear military air traffic chatter on Calvin's
text: Hallicrafter radio.) Then move down to the window where
text: we see CALVIN Webber tinkering with a gadget at his work
text: bench. Calvin's very pregnant wife HELEN appears. The
text: music becomes source.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: For Pete's sake, Calvin! We've got
dialog: guests!
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Sorry, honey! I just got to fooling
dialog: with this darn rheostat.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Well, put it down and come in!
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: You bet, hon!
text: They exit the workshop for the house. Calvin has left
text: the ham radio on.
speaker_heading: NAVY PILOT (ON
speaker_heading: RADIO)
text: Tower, Wolf One is five miles from the
text: overhead.
speaker_heading: TOWER (ON RADIO)
dialog: Wolf One, Tower. Report the numbers.
dialog: You're number one for the overhead.
speaker_heading: NAVY PILOT (ON
speaker_heading: RADIO)
dialog: Wolf one.
scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT OF JET - SAME TIME
text: The YOUNG PILOT looks down at the flashing red light on
text: his control panel. He speaks into the oxygen mask that
text: hangs loosely from his helmet.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: TOWER (OC)
dialog: Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you
dialog: declaring an emergency?
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Stand by. One.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM
text: DAVE, BETTY, BOB, and RUTH (30's) pass around the buffet
text: table. Another period song is playing on the phonograph.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Just remember: don't mention the
dialog: communists!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Calvin's a great guy, but he's a
dialog: little, you know...
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Nutty.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: What's his wife like?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Oh, you know, housewife.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Likes to cook. Pregnant.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Normal, then.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Well, I wouldn't go that far.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Helen!
text: Helen has entered from the kitchen with more food. She
dialog: favors June Allison.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Hi, Betty! Dave!
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Just look at you!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Any day now!
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: This is my sister and her husband.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Oh, hi! Welcome!
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
text: Calvin is using a cocktail shaker to very carefully make
text: Rob Roys for the crowd at the bar. It's like watching a
text: chemist at work. Calvin's a pipe-smoker.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: So anyhow this duck says to the clerk,
dialog: "I'd like to buy this lip balm." And
dialog: the clerk says, "Will that be cash or
dialog: a check?" And the duck says, "Just
dialog: put it on my bill!"
text: Polite laughter follows, but the guy out of Calvin's
text: sight-line rolls his eyes.
scene_heading: ANGLE - DAVE AND BOB
text: with drinks. Helen is in the b.g., rushing around, over-
dialog: serving everyone.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: He was the golden-boy professor at Cal
text: Tech. But then he starts inventing
dialog: things.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What kind of things?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You got me. Some kind of special
dialog: synthetic rubber. And some kind of
dialog: automated machine. Anyhow, suddenly
dialog: he gets rich. I mean rich! And quits
dialog: teaching.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - CALVIN
text: as his guests sample their Rob Roys.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: How's that?
speaker_heading: GUEST
dialog: Just what the doctor ordered!
text: Calvin gives the man his patented thumbs-up sign.
scene_heading: ANGLE - BETTY AND RUTH
text: over by the patio doors. We can see Calvin's shop through
dialog: the window.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: With all his money they could have
dialog: moved to Beverly Hills, but they
dialog: decided to stay in the Valley. Calvin
text: spends all his time tinkering out
dialog: there in his workshop. If you ask me
dialog: it's all very strange.
speaker_heading: WOMAN GUEST #1
dialog: (chiming in)
text: He dug a huge hole out there for a
dialog: swimming pool. Then he decided he
dialog: didn't want it and filled the thing
dialog: in. And what's that big, high fence
dialog: for?
text: The women look at Calvin.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - CALVIN
text: with guests (one is called Harold) at the bar.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: There currently exists a type of neon
dialog: light that lasts five years. But you
dialog: won't see it on the market. Same is
dialog: true of batteries. I could take your
dialog: simple yacht battery and rig it to
dialog: last a decade, easily.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Well, what the heck kind of a
dialog: marketing system can't get great new
dialog: products like that out to the public?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: (intense)
dialog: A veeeery good one, Harold. Free
dialog: market capitalism may not be a perfect
dialog: order, but it's the best we've got, or
dialog: will ever have. And why? Three
dialog: reasons!
dialog: Poor Harold.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME
text: Most of the guests are women, gabbing and helping Helen
text: out as she removes a pot roast from the oven and busily
text: jumps around the kitchen.
speaker_heading: WOMAN GUEST #2
dialog: Say, Helen? What does Calvin think
dialog: about this trouble down in Cuba?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (rolling her eyes)
dialog: Oh, please don't bring that up!
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT, MOMENTS LATER
text: A late guest named RON hurries up the walkway and into
dialog: the house.
speaker_heading: SCENE 8 OMITTED
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - A SECOND LATER
text: Calvin is with another guest.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I'd say my baseball card collection is
dialog: as complete as any one I've ever seen.
text: Ron pushes his way through the crowd.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Calvin! Hey, Calvin!
dialog: (pointing over his shoulder)
text: Kennedy's going toe-to-toe with
dialog: Khrushchev on the television!
text: Calvin immediately heads for the family room. Others
dialog: follow.
scene_heading: INT. FAMILY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Everyone is huddled around the JFK TV press conference.
text: There seems to be a lot of smokers. Helen appears
text: shortly, wearing a hot pad mitten on each hand.
speaker_heading: JFK
dialog: ...this sudden, clandestine decision
dialog: to station strategic weapons for the
dialog: first time outside of Soviet soil, is
text: a deliberately provocative and
dialog: unjustified change in the status quo
dialog: which cannot be accepted by this
dialog: country.
text: Calvin cuts a knowing look at Helen who dutifully returns
dialog: it.
scene_heading: EXT. JET - NIGHT
text: The plane swoops over the Valley and we see the
text: spectacular lights of L.A. sprawl. There is a TRAIL OF
text: SPARKS coming from the jet's engine.
scene_heading: INT. JET COCKPIT
text: The plane is shaking terribly and the pilot is having a
dialog: very hard time controlling it.
speaker_heading: TOWER
dialog: Wolf One -- say intentions.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: I've got secondaries of an engine fire
dialog: and I'll need to find a clear area to
dialog: eject.
speaker_heading: TOWER
dialog: Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to
dialog: the ocean?
scene_heading: EXT. JET
text: The trembling plane circles to the west.
scene_heading: INT. FAMILY ROOM
dialog: Return to TV.
speaker_heading: JFK
dialog: ...we will not prematurely or
dialog: unnecessarily risk the cost of
dialog: worldwide nuclear war, in which even
dialog: the fruits of victory would be ashes
dialog: in our mouth. But neither will we
dialog: shrink from the risk at any time it
dialog: must be faced.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT/ EXT. HOUSE, MOMENTS LATER
text: To Helen's embarrassment, Calvin is ushering all the
text: guests to the front door. Helen is passing out hats and
text: purses. She and Calvin speak simultaneously - somewhere
text: in the middle we cut outside.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I'm sorry everyone, but given this
dialog: extraordinary turn of events, I think
dialog: it's prudent that we cut the evening
dialog: short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will
dialog: resolve itself, but in the
dialog: meantime...I'd suggest taking a
dialog: prayerful watch-and-wait stance!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: We'll do this again! Maybe next week.
dialog: Here's your hat. Could I wrap
dialog: something up for you? Did you have a
dialog: coat?
text: Helen can barely get a "good night" out before Calvin
text: shuts the door.
scene_heading: ANGLE - DAVE AND BOB
text: Following their wives out.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (sotto to Bob)
dialog: What'd I tell ya?!
text: Bob whistles softly. Calvin's a nut all right.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT DOOR
text: Calvin turns to Helen, a grave expression on his face.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: It's time.
speaker_heading: HELEN
text: (misinterpreting, holding her
dialog: stomach)
dialog: Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time
dialog: yet. I still have--
text: He points down.
speaker_heading: HELEN (cont'd)
dialog: Oh, that time! You know Calvin, I'm
dialog: not sure I'm really ready for this.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: On the contrary, I think we're the
dialog: only ones who are.
text: He leads her out of shot.
speaker_heading: HELEN (OC)
dialog: Calvin I'm sure everything's going to
dialog: be all right. I just know it is!
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER
text: Calvin and Helen leave the house; cross the patio; and
text: hurry to the shop. Back in the house, the record player
dialog: has been left on: "How Much Is That Doggie In The
text: Window...?" Helen is carrying the pot roast which is
text: wrapped in foil.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Well, I'm certainly not going to let
dialog: the pot roast go to waste. Could you
dialog: just put that seat cover back on that
dialog: lawn chair?
dialog: He does.
speaker_heading: HELEN (cont'd)
dialog: Shouldn't we at least turn off the
dialog: phonograph?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
text: It shuts off automatically.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Did you rig it to do that? You're so
dialog: clever.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: No. They all do.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I never know anymore.
text: The SOUND OF THE TRAINER JET makes a low pass over
text: Calvin's house. Calvin sticks his head out the door and
text: looks up.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I bet that's a fighter jet on his way
dialog: to Key West! Good luck, amigo!
scene_heading: INT. WORKSHOP
text: They enter. The place is full of tools and gadgets--
text: mostly construction equipment. The ham radio is still on.
speaker_heading: TOWER
dialog: An emergency has been declared. I
dialog: repeat, an emergency has been
dialog: declared.
text: Calvin and Helen speak over the Tower who is telling
text: other aircraft in the vicinity to clear the area.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: You hear that?!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Yes.
text: Calvin unplugs the radio and quickly wraps the cord.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: We can listen to the rest downstairs!
text: He pushes aside a table that is hiding a hatch in the
text: floor and unlocks it by turning the hatch's wheel. Then
text: he opens the hatch and reaches inside to turn on a light.
text: Red submarine light shines up from below. All the while
text: he and Helen are chatting:
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Calvin, I wish you would have at least
dialog: let me do the dishes. It's not going
dialog: to be that easy getting all that dried-
dialog: on food off my nice plates.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I just hope those plates aren't
text: radioactive by tomorrow morning.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Cheese is particularly troublesome.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that
dialog: Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Yeah, yeah. Okay. Give me the roast
dialog: and watch your step. I'll come back
dialog: for the radio.
text: She steps into the hatch and onto a ladder.
scene_heading: INT. JET - NIGHT
text: The young pilot is bouncing around the now smokey
dialog: cockpit.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Tower, say again!!
speaker_heading: TOWER
dialog: The SAR HELO is airborne with you in
dialog: sight.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: I'm marking the 180 radial for five
text: and ejecting.
speaker_heading: TOWER
dialog: Roger, Wolf One.
text: The pilot rights the plane; points the joy stick; and
text: reaches for the ejection handles between his legs.
scene_heading: EXT. JET
text: The pilot ejects.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY COCKPIT
text: This is the pilot's POV (were there a pilot.) We see the
text: coastline and we notice that the plane is making a... U-
text: turn, away from the water and back towards the Valley.
scene_heading: EXT. JET
text: Streaking back to the Valley with a dramatic tail of
text: sparks.
scene_heading: EXT. THE PARACHUTING PILOT
text: He notices that his plane is headed directly at him. It
text: misses him by a matter of yards.
scene_heading: INT. LADDER - CONTINUOUS
text: Taking the liberty of a CUTAWAY SECTION, we follow them
text: down the ladder which is inside a corrugated metal tube.
text: On either side of the tube we see layers of dirt.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: How long will we have to stay down
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I don't know. For this thing to blow
dialog: over, it could take days.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Days??
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Rather safe than sorry. That's my
dialog: motto!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: But, what if I go into labor? That
dialog: could happen any time.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I've read up on it. I'll deliver the
dialog: baby myself if I have to.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Now you listen to me Calvin Webber,
dialog: when this baby comes, you're going to
dialog: be out in the waiting
dialog: room smoking yourself to death with
dialog: all the other fathers.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: Yes, dear!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: As long as we've got that straight.
scene_heading: EXT. JET - SAME TIME
text: It COMPLETES ITS TURN and STREAKS SKYWARD at a 90 degree
text: angle to the ground... until it SPUTTERS and the ENGINES
text: STOP. Then, after a Road Runner-like beat or two, it
text: begins to FALL DIRECTLY BACK TO EARTH, tail first.
scene_heading: INT. SMALL ANTEROOM - SAME TIME
text: The Webbers step off a metal ladder and face a vault-like
text: chrome hatchway. Calvin opens the six-inch thick door by
text: pushing another switch on his small box. Helen takes the
dialog: roast.
scene_heading: EXT. JET - NIGHT
text: With only the sound of wind, the jet continues to fall as
text: the lights of the Valley rush up to meet it.
scene_heading: INT. SHELTER - CONTINUOUS
text: They step into a darkened room.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: (with arms spread)
dialog: Home sweet home!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: To you maybe.
text: Calvin flicks a wall switch and we HEAR A SERIES OF
text: LIGHTS COMING ON. The echoes of the sounds suggest a
text: large, cavernous space. All we can see is the cinder
text: block wall behind them and the hatch door, which Calvin
text: begins to shut by putting his body into it.
text: Just then there is a TREMENDOUS DOUBLE EXPLOSION FROM
text: ABOVE which knocks them to the floor. (Note: Helen hangs
text: on to the roast, trying her best not to drop it.) The
scene_heading: LADDER, CORRUGATED TUBE, ROOF, AND LOTS OR DIRT AND ROCK
text: BEGIN TO CRASH DOWN INTO THE ANTEROOM. Calvin struggles
text: to his feet and gets the vault door shut just in the nick
dialog: of time.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What was that?!
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Are you all right?!
text: Hanging on to the roast she nods vigorously, trying to be
dialog: brave.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Yes, I think so.
text: Calvin hurries to a bright RED METAL BOX on the wall.
text: Next to the box is a LARGE THERMOMETER OR GAUGE that's
text: labeled "Radiation Count." There are OTHER GAUGES that
dialog: are dropping to zero.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Oh, no! It's happened! Look at that
dialog: heat!! All my surface indicators are
dialog: knocked out! Oh, my Lord...it's
dialog: actually happened!!
scene_heading: INTER CUT - CU OF BOX AND THERMOMETER
text: The box has a dial on it, next to which is a large lever.
text: A foreboding sign reads HATCHWAY TIME LOCKS, USE EXTREME
text: CAUTION. Calvin pulls the lever.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: The chrome and steel EXIT HATCHWAY AUTOMATICALLY LOCKS
dialog: with great noise, precision and...finality. There is the
text: SOUND OF A REAR DOOR doing the same thing.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What's that noise?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: The locks.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: The locks?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: To keep us from trying to leave. After
dialog: an atomic blast there's a radiation
dialog: half-life that lasts thirty five
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Thirty -five years!
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Then after that it's safe.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: It's safe.
text: She continues to stare at him.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: To go up.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: To go up.
text: She continues to stare at him.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: (confidently)
dialog: Hey, honey. Don't you worry. We're
dialog: going to be just fine.
text: Helen bursts into tears.
scene_heading: EXT WEBBER PATIO - DAY
text: Two police detectives, LEVY and ATKINSON, exit the house.
text: Uniformed workers carefully carry small pieces of the jet
text: from the crash site. The detectives lead us to what's
text: left of Calvin's shop. It's mostly a charred crater.
speaker_heading: LEVY
dialog: According to Caltech, this Webber guy
dialog: was a bonafide genius and a borderline
dialog: nutcase.
speaker_heading: ATKINSON
dialog: Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have
dialog: been out here when the plane hit.
speaker_heading: LEVY
dialog: Unless we get a postcard or somethin',
dialog: that's my guess.
speaker_heading: ATKINSON
dialog: What about relatives?
speaker_heading: LEVY
dialog: All back East.
speaker_heading: ATKINSON
dialog: The neighbors over there said the guy
dialog: spent day and night out here. She'd
dialog: bring him sandwiches and hot Dr.
dialog: Pepper.
speaker_heading: LEVY
dialog: He drank it hot?
speaker_heading: ATKINSON
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LEVY
dialog: Good god.
speaker_heading: ATKINSON
dialog: Yeah.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - SAME TIME (12 HOURS AFTER BLAST)
text: Helen awakes alone and still dressed. She sits up and
text: trys the phone on the night table. It is dead. She hangs
text: up and exits.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM/PATIO
text: Calvin is making sandwiches from the pot roast. Two empty
text: Doctor Pepper bottles sit next to the stove where Calvin
text: is heating the soda. He sees Helen enter the livingroom.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Hi, honey! Feeling better?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: We have to be strong, sweetheart. If
dialog: not for ourselves, for the child.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: All our friends...
text: He enters with her sandwich and a cup of Dr. Pepper.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
text: Burnt to a crisp.
dialog: (indicating sandwiches)
dialog: I've given you the most well-done cut.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I'm not hungry.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (leaving)
dialog: No, Calvin, you're favorite.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Really?
text: She walks out onto the patio. She rubs her arms as if
dialog: cold.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: A bit chilly? Shouldn't be.
dialog: Temperature's a nice 73 degrees.
text: He follows her out to the patio.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Maybe I've just got the creeps.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: How could you?! This is just like
dialog: home!
text: A reverse angle shows for the first time the rest of the
dialog: fallout shelter -- which looks very different from
text: "home". Perhaps she starts to cry again.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: No. No! Calvin, this is different!
dialog: Believe me!
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Would you like a tranquilizer?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: You have tranquilizers?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I told you! I've got everything!
text: Helen groans in pain.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Oh, no.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Uh, oh. Now it's time.
speaker_heading: CALVIN

speaker_heading: SCENE 29E OMITTED
scene_heading: INT. VERY WIDE OF THE SHELTER - HOURS LATER
text: We can only hear Adam's entrance into the world. There is
text: Helen's pain, followed by Adam's cry, followed by

speaker_heading: CALVIN (OC)
dialog: The first child to be born on earth
dialog: after the annihilation!!
scene_heading: INT. SHELTER - DAYS LATER

scene_heading: INT. SHELTER, FISH FARM - CONTINUOUS
text: Calvin checks the switch he uses to control the lights.

text: hurries away.(Music continues)
scene_heading: INT. SHELTER, MASTER BEDROOM
text: Calvin enters and smiles with great affection at his
text: family: Helen and a NEWBORN SON cradled next to her in
dialog: bed.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Is there a problem?
speaker_heading: HELEN
text: No, Calvin. Babies cry.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I've noticed.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What shall we call him?
text: Calvin shrugs.
speaker_heading: HELEN (cont'd)
dialog: Well, I was thinking...in light of the
dialog: situation...that we should call him
dialog: Adam. That's not sacrilegious is it?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: No. I think it's just right.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: And I was wondering...if...if I could
dialog: have a...
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: If I...you know...
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: What? Whatever you want, Helen!
text: She points upwards.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I want a bedroom ceiling.
text: They both look up. Then he tells her.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: You've got it!
text: Calvin happily gives her his patented thumbs-up sign.
scene_heading: A MONTAGE: 1) CALVIN , IN A LARGE SUPPLY ROOM, PICKS OUT
text: THE PLYWOOD HE'LL NEED FOR THE CEILINGS. ( 60'S HAPPY,
text: BUSY SCORE COVERS ALL THIS.)
scene_heading: 2) HELEN, CARRIES LITTLE ADAM (THREE DAYS OLD) ONTO THE

speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (arriving)
dialog: We looked all over for you. What are
dialog: you doing back here?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Oh, I was just examining this rear
text: hatchway.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: No reason.
dialog: (then, off her look)
dialog: Well, it's pretty clear that the front
text: entrance caved in when the bomb went
dialog: off. So, you know, when the time is
dialog: up, we'll have to return to the
dialog: surface using, you know, this back
dialog: entrance. Which is very nice because

speaker_heading: CALVIN

text: A sober beat, then:
speaker_heading: CALVIN (cont'd)
dialog: You wanted to see me?
text: Helen nods vigorously.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Watch this!
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: What?
text: She sets Adam (one year old) down on his wobbly little
text: legs, steadying him at the shoulders.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Go to Daddy, Adam. Go to Daddy.
text: And Adam takes his first step. And then another! And
dialog: another! It's a joyous event.
text: CAMERA LEAVES THEM AND TRAVELS UPWARD THROUGH THE CEILING

speaker_heading: WORKMAN #1
dialog: What do you make of this?
speaker_heading: BOSS
dialog: Damn if I know.
speaker_heading: WORKMAN #2
dialog: I bet it's some kinda septic tank.
speaker_heading: WORKMAN #1
dialog: I've never seen a septic tank that
dialog: looked like that.
speaker_heading: BOSS
dialog: Well, don't fool with it. If it is a
dialog: septic tank, I sure as hell don't want
dialog: to open it. We'll just lay the

speaker_heading: WORKMAN #1

speaker_heading: REALTOR

speaker_heading: WOMAN BUYER
dialog: Is that where the plane crashed?
text: She points out to a LEVEL LAWN where the shop used to be.

speaker_heading: REALTOR

speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Not bad for a three and a half year
dialog: old! I'd like to see the public school
dialog: system match that! I don't care how
dialog: terrific it is!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like
dialog: his father. But you know, Calvin,
dialog: maybe he's a little...young for
dialog: school.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Nonsense. People have no idea what the
dialog: human mind is capable of. Look at us!
text: Helen ponders that statement.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (pointing to the book's art
dialog: work)
dialog: Look, Daddy. Alice went down a hole,

text: Calvin smiles and messes up Adam's hair.
speaker_heading: ADAM (cont'd)
dialog: Will I ever get to go up on top?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Yes, you certainly will. And you'll
dialog: find a nice girl and rebuild America.
dialog: Just the way it used to be.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be
dialog: making promises that perhaps can't be
dialog: kept.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I believe there will be other
dialog: survivors. In fact, I'm guessing
text: there's life on the surface, even now.
dialog: It's not life worth living perhaps,
dialog: but believe me, something's moving

scene_heading: INT. SHELTER, CLASSROOM - DAY (65-66)

scene_heading: EXT. MALT SHOP - DAY (1970-71)

scene_heading: INT. MALT SHOP - SAME TIME
text: The clean-cut kids have been replaced by FLOWER CHILDREN.
text: Mom hasn't put a lot back into the decor, but she has
text: made concessions to the fashions of the time. The jukebox
text: plays something appropriate. Mom and the Jerk are five
dialog: years older.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: I can't tell the boys from the girls

speaker_heading: SODA JERK

scene_heading: INT. SHELTER - MINUTES LATER

scene_heading: INT. MALT SHOP - DAY (1975-76)

speaker_heading: SODA JERK
dialog: (after studying her for some

speaker_heading: MOM

speaker_heading: SODA JERK
dialog: Oh, man. I'm like not sure I like
dialog: that.
scene_heading: INT. SHELTER, CLASSROOM (1975-76)
text: The room looks like Ricky Nelson's class. There are twin
text: pictures of Ike and JFK on the wall. Adam is eleven.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: This is what money looks like. It
dialog: comes like this, in coin, or like this
dialog: in paper. Or you can have an
dialog: "investment." These are stock
dialog: "certificates" that we bought in your
dialog: name. Of course, they're worthless
dialog: now, but at one time they were quite
dialog: valuable.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: They're pretty. Can I have them?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Sure. Now, let's move on to our French

scene_heading: INT. SHUFFLEBOARD COURT - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: CALVIN

speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Hi.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Calvin hands Adam a cigar box. Adam opens it to see

speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: These are wonderful.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: It's my entire baseball collection.
dialog: It's yours now.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: What's baseball?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: It's a game, son. I can explain it
text: pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Like a painting?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: No, son. A pitcher.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Like one of Mom's?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Uh, no. There's a man who throws the

speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: The nocturnal flying mammal?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: (slightly pissed)
dialog: No. Sit down.
dialog: They do.
scene_heading: INT. SHELTER - NIGHT
text: Start close on flashing roller skates. Then cut wider to

scene_heading: EXT. MALT SHOP - DAY (1991)
speaker_heading: SUPER: 1991

speaker_heading: SUPER: 1995

dialog: Calvin are now in their 60's.)
speaker_heading: CALVIN (OC)
text: No, no! The runner on second goes to
dialog: third! He's out there!
speaker_heading: ADAM (OC)
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: CALVIN (OC)

dialog: a force!
speaker_heading: ADAM (OC)

speaker_heading: CALVIN (OC)

speaker_heading: HELEN

speaker_heading: CALVIN (cont'd)
dialog: Yes, dear?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Get the presents and do the lights.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: You bet.
text: Calvin leaves while Helen lights the candles. The whole

text: wrapped in whatever is available.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Helen and Calvin enter singing Happy Birthday. We see the
text: ADULT ADAM for the first time in silhouette. His handsome
text: face is revealed to us when the cake is placed before
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Blow out the candles!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Make a wish!
text: He does both. His parents clap. Helen takes one of the
text: presents from Calvin and gives it to Adam. He unwraps it.
text: It's a green coat.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Oh, boy! A jacket!
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Your mom made that all by herself.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: No kidding!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: No kidding.
dialog: (aside, to Calvin)
dialog: Who else would have done it?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: And I made these!
text: He gives Adam the second present. Adam tears off the
text: paper to find a pair of roller-skates that Calvin has
text: redesigned. The new skates look kind of like
text: rollerblades.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Your roller-skates! I redesigned them!
dialog: I think this new design will work even
dialog: better!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: These are really swell! I mean swell!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What did you wish for, Adam?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: If he tells, it won't come true!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We
dialog: never believed that in my family!
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Well, we did in my family!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I wished I could meet a girl.

speaker_heading: HELEN

speaker_heading: ADAM

speaker_heading: CALVIN

speaker_heading: HELEN

speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Well, we'll be going up in two years.

speaker_heading: ADAM

speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Yeah. Let's dig in!

speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Elbows, Son.
speaker_heading: ADAM

speaker_heading: CALVIN

speaker_heading: HELEN

speaker_heading: CALVIN

speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: In the generator room again?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Oh, yes. It just fascinates me how

speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I know exactly what you mean!

dialog: Hey, honey?

speaker_heading: SCENE 67 OMITTED
scene_heading: CLOSE ON THE RED METAL BOX

text: ANOTHER ANGLE shows us the mechanism on the FRONT

speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE

speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: So...we just open this door and go up?

text: nothing but earth and rock pour into the room.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Um...is that supposed to happen?
text: His parents take a beat then race off like maniacs

speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Hey, where are we going?! Is
dialog: everything all right?!
scene_heading: INT. BACK HATCHWAY - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: CALVIN

speaker_heading: HELEN

scene_heading: INT. ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: ADAM

speaker_heading: CALVIN

speaker_heading: HELEN

speaker_heading: CALVIN

dialog: Please excuse her French.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Shit is a French word?
speaker_heading: HELEN

speaker_heading: CALVIN

scene_heading: INT. MALT SHOP - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: SODA JERK
dialog: ...all of these things...Alcoholics

speaker_heading: OTHER BUM

speaker_heading: SODA JERK

dialog: Well...I have lifted my eyes skyward a

dialog: not seen anything coming from up there
dialog: except a goddamn airplane -- that I

dialog: Earthquake! Another earthquake!
speaker_heading: SODA JERK
dialog: Let her come! Let's get this over
dialog: with! And please, if there is a God,
dialog: let it be worse in Bel Air!!
text: The Other Bum staggers to his feet and SPLITS for a back
text: window. Soda Jerk is fearless. Until finally the
text: HYDRAULIC DOORS of the back entrance SPLIT THE FLOOR with
text: an eerie, struggling whine and LARGE CHUNKS OF CEMENT GO
text: FLYING. Then up comes RED SUBMARINE LIGHT followed by
text: Calvin in his BIG YELLOW SUIT with Geiger counter
text: ticking.
speaker_heading: SODA JERK
dialog: Oh, God! Oh, God!! Oh,God, save me!!
dialog: For I have seen the light!!
text: Calvin raises his hand and yells through his mask.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I come in peace!!
text: The Soda Jerk FAINTS. Calvin, sounding like a deep sea
text: diver and having to walk like Frankenstein, goes over to
text: the Soda Jerk and studies his face in the light of his
text: flashlight. He is horrified by what he sees.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: My, gosh...
text: Calvin looks around the room and heads for the back. He
text: moves his Geiger counter around and gets a quiet (safe)
text: reading. Then he removes a KITCHEN MATCH from a plastic
text: container and strikes it against the wall. The MATCH
text: BURNS, so Calvin takes off his hood and visor and
text: breathes the air. It stinks in there.
scene_heading: EXT. MALT SHOP - MOMENTS LATER, RAINING
text: Calvin (out of the head gear and top of the suit) slowly
text: pushes the door open and steps out. He's surprised to
text: find an empty BODY SHOP behind the Malt Shop, where the

speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Where is my backyard?
text: He points his flashlight around and heads for the ALLEY
text: to his left.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY - A MOMENT LATER, RAINING
text: DERELICT CARS left over from the Body Shop sit against a
text: fence. Calvin marvels at the cars, even in their present
text: condition. In a TIGHTER SHOT he studies the chrome-
text: plated word "Toyota." A HOMELESS MAN arrives to search
text: through the garbage. Calvin hurries back towards the
dialog: avenue.
speaker_heading: SCENE 76 OMITTED
scene_heading: EXT. MALT SHOP - TEN MINUTES LATER, RAIN
text: Calvin emerges from the alley that separates the Malt
text: Shop from another storefront (perhaps now a rundown Thai
dialog: restaurant.)
speaker_heading: CLOSER ON HIM
text: watching the cars fly by on the wet avenue. Suddenly, a
text: cross-dressing STREET WALKER steps up to him with a
dialog: cigarette.
speaker_heading: STREET WALKER
dialog: You got a light, honey?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: What?! A light! Yes, I've got a
dialog: light!
speaker_heading: STREET WALKER
dialog: Good.
text: Fumbling, he finally gets her little cigar lighted with
text: one of his kitchen matches.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: So...you...survived the blast, did
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: STREET WALKER
dialog: The blast? Honey, I have survived a
dialog: host of things. Like the song says: "A
dialog: country boy can survive!"
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Yes, yes, the song. So tell me...has
dialog: it been...hell up here?
speaker_heading: STREET WALKER
dialog: "Hell up here?" Honey, it's been hell
dialog: up here, down there and over yonder!
dialog: Hell everywhere.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Yes, I can tell that just looking
dialog: around.
dialog: (then)
dialog: "Boy?" Did you say you were a
dialog: "country boy?"
speaker_heading: STREET WALKER
dialog: Cute Little Old Man, if you want a
dialog: boy, I can be a boy. And if you want
dialog: a girl, I can be a girl. I can be
dialog: anything you want me to be!
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: STREET WALKER
dialog: Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the
dialog: remarkably low price of only $200!
dialog: And if you act now, I might even throw
text: in some free lawn furniture.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: (stumbling away from her)
dialog: No, I can't. I'm sorry! I have to
dialog: go! I have to...
text: He breaks into a trot, heading up the street past a seedy
dialog: BAR (used to be the convenience store) just as a
text: hopelessly DRUNK HAG of a woman is shoved out and told to
text: stay out. Calvin watches as the woman stumbles to the
text: curb where she TOSSES her cookies. TWO LOW RIDERS HOP BY
text: full of TAUNTING YOUNG HISPANIC GANG MEMBERS, one of whom
text: BRANDISHES A PISTOL and, just for fun, points it at
text: Calvin. When Calvin sees the pistol he ducks into the
text: ADULT BOOKSTORE. The young gang member pulls the trigger
dialog: and we (not Calvin) see that the realistic-looking pistol
dialog: is really a water gun.
scene_heading: INT. ADULT BOOK AND VIDEO STORE
text: Calvin races in and, gathering himself, addresses the
text: PAKISTANI MAN behind the counter.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Hello! How are you this evening?!
dialog: Mind if I, you know, browse around?!
text: The clerk just watches him.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Thank-Q very much!
text: Then Calvin turns and has his first look at the
dialog: material...and he GRABS HIS HEART and SCREAMS and FALLS
text: back KNOCKING OVER a whole ROW OF VIDEOS AND MAGAZINES.
scene_heading: INT. SHELTER, KITCHEN - AN HOUR LATER
text: Calvin sits at the breakfast table, still breathing hard
text: and holding his chest. His family looks on with great
text: concern. The anti-radiation suit and gear is piled in
dialog: the corner.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I'm going to give it to you straight.
dialog: There's no point in beating around the
text: bush. There were survivors.
dialog: Apparently,
dialog: the fallout has created....a
dialog: subspecies of mutants.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Mutants?!
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out
dialog: of garbage cans. Others are...cover
dialog: your ears, Son, and hum. I mean that
dialog: literally and I mean right now!
text: ADAM covers his ears and hums.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Others are...multi-sexual. It
dialog: seems...they can be both masculine and
dialog: feminine...simultaneously.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I don't believe it!
text: Helen copes by moving around the kitchen doing things
dialog: that don't need to be done.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Believe it. He tried to sell me his
text: body, Helen.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: They offer lawn furniture as a come
dialog: on!
text: She slumps, then resumes her needless activity. Calvin
text: takes Adam's arm and the son drops his hands and stops
dialog: humming.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: They've done a lot of re-building but
dialog: society, at least as we knew it, has
text: utterly collapsed. People throw up in
text: the streets. Others point guns.
dialog: There's something terribly wrong with
dialog: the automobiles and...and I...I can't
dialog: tell you the rest. I just can't.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So,
dialog: what do we do now?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: We stay down here.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: We do?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Excuse me.
text: She hurries into the living room.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Helen let's out a silent scream, then hurries back into
dialog: the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: For how long? We've just about run
dialog: out of everything!
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: We'll make do. I'm of the opinion
dialog: that these mutants will eventually
dialog: kill each other off and then--
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (rising)
dialog: No, Calvin. We're not going to make
dialog: do. Not me! Not Adam. We're going
dialog: up no matter what! We deserve it.
dialog: Even if it's terrible!
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Well, I am the head of this household--
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I want him to at least see the sky!
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: --and we will--
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: And the ocean! A mountain range!
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: --do as I say!
text: Breathing heavily, Calvin suddenly clutches at his chest
text: in great pain and collapses.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Dad!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Oh, no! Oh, my goodness! Let's get
text: him into the bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - HOURS LATER
text: Adam paces. Then Helen comes out. Behind her, we can
text: see Calvin sleeping in his bed. She heads for the living
text: room. He follows.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: He seems to be doing all right now. I
dialog: don't know if he's had a heart attack
dialog: or just... a horrifying experience.
dialog: But we need supplies and I've got to
dialog: stay with him.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I'll go up.
text: They go through the living room and cross to the patio.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I'm afraid you've got to.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I'll be all right.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (patting his cheek)
dialog: You're my brave boy.
text: Helen hands him a pencil and pad. Adam follows her to the
dialog: fish farm.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Just act normal. If anybody asks,
dialog: simply say you're from out-of-town,
dialog: and that you're in town on business.
dialog: Write that down.
dialog: He does.
speaker_heading: HELEN (cont'd)
dialog: I'm going to give you a shopping list
dialog: and some money. We need just enough
dialog: things to get us through the next year
dialog: or two. And you'll find most of these
dialog: items at what used to be called a
dialog: grocery store or a hardware store.
dialog: Write that down.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
text: At the fish tank, Helen pulls up a slim chain that is
text: attached to a water-tight aluminum box which she quickly
text: opens. The box contains $6,000 in wrapped one hundred
text: dollar bills. Helen takes half of it.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I don't know how far you'll have to
dialog: travel to find supplies, but if you
dialog: can't get home by nightfall, I want
dialog: you to look for something called a
dialog: Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a
dialog: hotel. There might still be one
dialog: standing.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Let's get you packed.
text: She heads back for the house. He follows.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (indicating money)
dialog: I just hope this is still good up
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Mom?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I was thinking that, uh...you know,
dialog: while I was up there and all...that
dialog: maybe I could, you know...try to meet
dialog: a girl. I've, been thinking about
dialog: that a little...just these
dialog: last...fifteen years or so.
text: They have stopped by the garden.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if
dialog: you could find a girl. One who's not a
dialog: mutant...and hopefully comes from
dialog: Pasadena. Nothing against Valley
dialog: girls,
dialog: but in my day anyhow, the girls from
dialog: Pasadena, I don't know...always just
dialog: seemed a little nicer.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
text: They hug.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Oh, there's also a thing called a
dialog: liquor store. Write that down.
scene_heading: INT. ADAM'S ROOM - AN HOUR LATER
text: He is packing. He looks at his cigar box and opens it. He
dialog: studies the contents: The Cards, stock certificates, and
text: an old photo of his parents. He decides to pack the box.
text: Helen enters with a long shopping list.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Here's the shopping list and $3,000
dialog: which should take care of everything.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Your father has a few final words for
dialog: you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw
dialog: for you - he loves you so much. We
dialog: both do.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Heck, I know that mom! You're my
dialog: parents.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Adam sets down his suitcase and goes to his father's bed.
text: He sits. At the door, Helen dries her eyes with her
text: apron. Calvin indicates that he wants to whisper to
text: Adam, who drops his ear close to his father's lips.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Yes, father?! Yes?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: ...the pipe tobacco.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Yes, sir. Is that all?
text: Calvin nods. Adam rises and starts for the door. But
text: Calvin remembers something and beckons him back to speak
text: weakly into his son's ear.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Also...stay out of the "Adult
dialog: Bookstore."
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Adult Bookstore. Why?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I promise. Is that all?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: One more thing. If you find a healthy
dialog: young woman, bring her back with you.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I'll try.
text: And then Calvin closes his eyes and sleeps.
scene_heading: INT. MALT SHOP - SAME DAY
text: The Soda Jerk has turned the rear exit into a religious
text: shrine. He's put flowers and candles and costume jewelry
text: and religious icons (from all the Majors) on top of and
text: around the broken cement. Currently he's on his knees,
text: rocking back and forth as he prays.
text: And,lo! There came a rumbling even as from the very
text: bowels of the earth and a great light showed forth
text: followed by gates of armor which opened and shut and
text: delivered up the vision of a young man whose countenance
text: caused the Soda Jerk to be struck dumb and to fall on his
text: face and to weep in fear. And, Adam, taking pity on the
text: man, put down his suitcase, and went to him, saying:
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Are you all right?
speaker_heading: SODA JERK
dialog: Yes! Yes! Oh, Lord! Yes, oh, yes!
dialog: But where is the one who came last
dialog: night -- all in yellow?!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: All in yellow? Oh! That was my
dialog: father!
speaker_heading: SODA JERK
dialog: Ooooohhhh!! Of course! The father!
dialog: Forgive me!! Can you forgive me for
dialog: my wasted life?! Everything has been
dialog: so awful!!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (comforting him)
dialog: I know it has been terrible. But it
dialog: wasn't your fault. And now all the
text: decay is over with and things are
dialog: going to get better. You understand?
speaker_heading: SODA JERK
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I've got to go, now.
speaker_heading: SODA JERK
dialog: Of course you do. I'll stay here and
dialog: pray.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (picking up his suitcase)
dialog: That's always a good idea! Would you
dialog: like some money? I have a great deal
dialog: of it.
speaker_heading: SODA JERK
dialog: No. I don't need money anymore -- I
dialog: see that now.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: How do I leave here?
speaker_heading: SODA JERK
dialog: The front door is open. Will you be
dialog: back?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I promise.
text: Adam turns and leaves. The Soda Jerk falls to his knees
text: and shakes all over.
scene_heading: EXT. MALT SHOP - CONTINUOUS
text: Adam steps out onto the sidewalk and sunlight falls on
text: him much brighter than anything he has ever seen. He
text: looks at it on the arm of his coat and then, slowly, he
text: looks up at the sky.
scene_heading: INTERCUT - LOVELY CLOUDS AND BLUE SKY
text: And now it is Adam who is dumbstruck. BYSTANDER #1
text: appears and sees Adam looking up.
speaker_heading: BYSTANDER #1
dialog: What? What is it?!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: The sky!!!
speaker_heading: BYSTANDER #1
dialog: The sky? Where?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: Up there!!
speaker_heading: BYSTANDER #1
dialog: I don't see anything!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Just look!!
text: Adam becomes momentarily interested in a parking meter.
text: A MOTHER and her CHILD approach from the other direction.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: What is it!
speaker_heading: BYSTANDER #1
dialog: (pointing)
text: He sees something.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHILD
dialog: I see it, mommy!
speaker_heading: BYSTANDER #2
dialog: Where?!
text: Several more people are drawn over. A CONVERTIBLE goes by
text: in the foreground with passengers who are looking up.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I have never in my life seen anything
dialog: like this!!!! Nothing even comes
dialog: close!!
text: Adam continues down the sidewalk,looking up. A BLACK
text: WOMAN POSTAL WORKER passes by.
speaker_heading: POSTAL WORKER
dialog: Whatcha looking at?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
speaker_heading: POSTAL WORKER
dialog: (with attitude)
dialog: Say what?!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (offering his hand)
dialog: How do you do, ma'am.
speaker_heading: POSTAL WORKER
dialog: (leary, but taking his hand)
dialog: I do alright.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Good!
text: The Pakistani exits the Adult Bookstore.
speaker_heading: PAKISTANI
dialog: What is it?! What do you see?!
text: When Adam looks down to answer the man he sees the "Adult
dialog: Bookstore" sign.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Oh, no!
speaker_heading: PAKISTANI
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Poisonous gas!! Run for your life,
dialog: it's invisible poisonous gas!!!
text: And everyone does run away, including Adam. The avenue is
text: left totally deserted.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN NOOK - SAME DAY
text: Helen sits sipping tea, deep in thoughts of concern for
text: Adam. Behind her Calvin appears in the open window.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: You know--
text: Helen is so startled she knocks the tea all over the
dialog: place.
speaker_heading: CALVIN (cont'd)
dialog: I just wanted to say that I think he's
dialog: going to be just fine.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (holding her heart)
dialog: Thank you, Calvin. Thank you very
dialog: much.
text: Calvin leaves, then comes back.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: He's smart.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Yes, dear, I know.
speaker_heading: SCENE 85A OMITTED
scene_heading: EXT. CORNER BUS STOP - AFTERNOON, SAME DAY
text: An L.A. bus comes directly at CAMERA.
scene_heading: ANGLE - THE DRIVER
text: is startled. He reacts.
scene_heading: ANGLE - DRIVER'S FOOT
text: slamming down the brake pedal.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - ADAM
text: in profile. The braking bus stops an inch from his nose.
text: Adam smiles. (Have him head for bus door in this angle.)
scene_heading: ANGLE - THE DRIVER
text: from over Adam. He is in shock.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - A MOMENT LATER
text: Start on a MOVING STEADY CAM SHOT on Adam's POV of bus
text: passengers as he heads for a seat. The passengers look at
text: him in amazement and some fear.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - ADAM
text: going to his seat; smiling at the passengers. (He is
dialog: carrying a $100 bill.)
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Hello! Hi. Good afternoon! Howdy.
text: Adam finds a seat next to a heavily perspiring young
scene_heading: PSYCHO HEROIN ADDICT.
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE OF THEM
text: Adam shows the Psycho the $100 bill.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I tried to give the driver this but he
text: wouldn't take it. He seems angry. A
dialog: lot of people do.
text: The bus pulls out. It gets up to about twenty miles an
dialog: hour.
speaker_heading: ADAM (cont'd)
dialog: Oh, boy! Here we go! We're moving!
dialog: Wow.
scene_heading: INTERCUT: PASSENGERS
text: looking back at Adam with concern.
speaker_heading: ADAM (CONT'D)
dialog: So this is public transportation. My
dialog: Dad says that it becomes more and more
dialog: important because of pollution --
dialog: which is more and more carbon dioxide
text: and other hazardous gases in the air.
dialog: (then, confidentially)
dialog: Do you have a gun, by the way?
text: The increasingly nervous Psycho looks around, then nods
dialog: that he does.
speaker_heading: ADAM (cont'd)
dialog: Well, thanks for not waving it around.
dialog: And for not vomitting, for that
dialog: matter. Wow, we're really flying. Say,
dialog: do you know where I could find a
dialog: grocery store?
text: The psycho shakes his head.
speaker_heading: ADAM (cont'd)
dialog: I have to find that. And a hardware
text: store and a liquour store and a
dialog: standing Holiday Inn. Although, I may
dialog: not need the Holiday Inn. That's still
dialog: kind of up in the air. It depends
dialog: really on how things go.
speaker_heading: PSYCHO
dialog: (pointing)
text: There's a grocery store coming up.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Thank-Q!
dialog: (jumping up)
dialog: Driver! Please stop the bus
dialog: immediately! I have to get off!
dialog: (then an aside to the psycho)
dialog: Do you think I should get a gun?
speaker_heading: PSYCHO
dialog: I don't know...maybe.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (back to driver)
dialog: Driver! Please stop, sir!
scene_heading: INTERCUT - DRIVER IN THE REAR VIEW
dialog: He's not going to stop until he wants to stop.
scene_heading: ANGLE - OLD JEWISH COUPLE PASSENGERS.
text: who are anxious for Adam to leave.
speaker_heading: OLD JEWISH MAN
dialog: For the love of God! Let him off the
dialog: bus!! Can't you see he's meshugina!
text: Adam leans in close to the OLD MAN.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I'm sorry, what did you call me?
text: The man and his wife take that the wrong way and start to
dialog: scream.
scene_heading: ANGLE - THE DRIVER'S FOOT
text: hitting the brakes.
scene_heading: EXT.- BUS

dialog: down.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS
text: The back door opens as Adam gets up.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Thank you, driver! Good-bye, everyone!
text: Adam exits the bus. Everyone, including the Psycho,
text: heaves a huge sign of relief.
scene_heading: INT. SUPER MARKET - MINUTES LATER
text: Adam enters and (after getting over the automatic doors
text: and the check-out technology) is overwhelmed by the
text: magnificence of the postmodern California supermarket.
text: The check-out counters alone are amazing. Seeing others
text: do it, he takes a cart, placing his suitcase in it.
scene_heading: INT. BAKERY COUNTER
text: Adam passes the baked goods, paying particular attention
text: to the elaborate birthday cakes.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Is that a birthday cake?!
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Yes, it is.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Gee-ma-nee!
text: Adam leaves. The clerk turns to a fellow worker.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Bakersfield.
scene_heading: INT. AISLE
text: Adam marvels at the abundance and variety. He passes a
text: mother whose child is riding in the cart and that reminds
dialog: him of his own mom -- when she used to let him ride that
text: way. Then he is surprised to see a MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE so
text: casually dressed in public. She (overweight) is in an
text: unfortunate terrycloth halter-shorts combination. He
text: (hirsute) is in a sleeveless undershirt and baggy bathing
dialog: trunks.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: My first mutants.
scene_heading: INT. FRESH PRODUCE
text: Adam picks up one of those huge California cucumbers that
text: always amaze Easterners. He shows it to the JAPANESE-
scene_heading: AMERICAN CLERK.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Is this because of the radiation?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Nothing.
scene_heading: INT. MEAT COUNTER
text: Adam is looking at the live lobsters as a BUTCHER steps
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: BUTCHER
dialog: Help you?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Yes, please.
dialog: (consulting his Mom's list)
dialog: I'm looking for all beef patties.
speaker_heading: BUTCHER
dialog: Fresh or frozen?
text: Adam chuckles because he thinks the man is kidding.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
speaker_heading: BUTCHER
dialog: Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in
text: the three pound box.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Then I'll need, twelve into nine
dialog: hundred, seventy-five boxes. And
dialog: that's almost...five hundred dollars
dialog: just for the hamburger! And my Mom
dialog: only gave me three thousand dollars
dialog: for everything! The yacht batteries!
dialog: The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
speaker_heading: BUTCHER
dialog: You could have a meat order that big
dialog: delivered to your home.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Really?!
speaker_heading: BUTCHER
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Well, that's great then!
dialog: Terrific...except...it just occurred
dialog: to me. I don't know where I live! I'm
dialog: lost! I don't know where home is!
dialog: (then)
dialog: Would you excuse me?
speaker_heading: BUTCHER
text: Gladly.
text: Adam hurries away.
speaker_heading: SCENE 93 OMITTED
speaker_heading: SCENE 94 OMITTED
speaker_heading: A MONTAGE
text: of Adam on another bus. He looks frantically out the
text: window. We see his POV of shops and stores and people. At
text: one point he sees two women joggers which he wonders
text: about. Then he sees two men arguing violently. Gradually
text: late day turns to night and Adam becomes more and more
text: depressed. Then he sees something. He is elated. He jumps
text: up and tells the driver:
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Driver! Stop this bus immediately!
dialog: Please sir!!
scene_heading: EXT. - VENTURA BLVD - NIGHT
text: The bus stops mid-block and Adam gets off. He crosses the
text: street causing only one car to hit the brakes. On the
text: other side of the avenue we see what has gotten his
text: attention. It's an ADULT BOOKSTORE much like the last one
dialog: we saw (probably owned by the same chain.) He's happy but
text: when he looks next door he sees he's in a different
text: place. Sad and lost he turns north and starts to walk
text: until -- a billboard catches his attention. We pan up to
text: see a billboard for liposuction that features an almost
text: NUDE WOMAN. Adam is struck by the image and we spend some
text: time cutting between him and it. Then gathering himself
text: he turns and begins to walk south.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: of him as he passes a BODY PIERCING STORE and wonders
text: about that. Then he sees something that blows his mind.
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
text: of a STRAY DOG passing by. Adam reacts.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Oh my. Oh, my goodness gracious! Oh,
dialog: my...Oh. That is so great!! Man alive!
scene_heading: ANGLE - CU OF BASEBALL CARDS STORE WINDOW
text: A sign says: COMIC BOOKS & BASEBALL CARDS BOUGHT, SOLD &
speaker_heading: TRADED.
scene_heading: INT. CARD AND COMIC STORE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Adam enters with his suitcase in one hand and his cigar
text: box in the other. He steps up to the counter where the
text: owner (JERRY) sits reading the newspaper. He has a
dialog: fondness for Navajo jewelry.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: JERRY
text: (gives him a look, then goes
dialog: back to reading)
dialog: Hi.
text: A YOUNG WOMAN enters from the back of the store and goes
text: to another counter. Neither man notices.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: The name is Adam Webber and I see you
dialog: buy baseball cards and although these
dialog: are a lot older than the ones in the
dialog: window, I was hoping you still might
dialog: be interested.
text: He flips open the cigar box to reveal to Jerry riches
text: beyond his wildest dreams. Jerry actually moans and then
text: must pretend the moan was a cough.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: How--how much do you want for the
dialog: Mickey Mantle, rookie season?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I was thinking of selling all the
dialog: cards.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Really? No kidding?
text: He reaches in and looks through the cards.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: See, my problem is, all I have are
dialog: hundred dollar bills and I need
dialog: something smaller. Ones, fives, tens.
dialog: Like that.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I see what ya mean. Tell you
dialog: what...I'll give you five hundred
dialog: dollars in small bills for the whole
dialog: box.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Oh, that would be wonderful!
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Well, we're here to help!
text: A woman steps into the shot. She has come from the back
text: of the store and her back is momentarily to us.
speaker_heading: EVE (OC)
dialog: Oh, shit!
text: Adam turns to her and is immediately awe struck. We
text: reveal EVE RUSTOKOV. She tosses her lipstick into her
text: purse. Eve works in the card shop and is on her way out.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I'm workin' here, Evey-poo. Don't
dialog: screw me up.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Bon soir, mademoiselle!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Are you French?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: No.
dialog: (then, thinking fast)
dialog: I'm from out of town.
dialog: (then sensing the need for
dialog: further clarification)
dialog: I'm here on business.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Well, your business must not be sports
dialog: memorabilia, because this one Mantle
dialog: card right here--
dialog: (holds up a card)
dialog: --is worth six thousand dollars all by
dialog: its little self.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Get out of here!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: No, you get out of here.
text: She closes his cigar box and gives it to him.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Terrific...you're fired! You know
dialog: that?!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: No, ferry--excuse me, Jerry, I quit.
text: She walks back to the counter to get her coat.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Oh, no! I fired ya! Just like the hair
dialog: salon guy and the Chevy dealer! You
dialog: know why you can't keep a goddamn
dialog: job?! Because you can't keep your
dialog: goddamn mouth shut! That's why!
text: Jerry is surprised when Adam suddenly takes his arm
dialog: firmly.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Sir? I would really appreciate it if
dialog: you wouldn't take the Lord's name in
dialog: vain again.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (looking at Adam's hand)
dialog: Oh, you got a problem with that?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I have a big problem with that.
text: Eve sees a fist fight coming. She takes Adam by the arm.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to
dialog: the corner.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Yes, ma'am. But my name is Adam.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Just come on.
text: They head for the door and exit.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Hah! Adam and Eve! The perfect

text: Adam re-enters.
speaker_heading: ADAM

speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your

text: Adam walks towards the man smiling.
speaker_heading: ADAM

speaker_heading: EVE

scene_heading: EXT. CARD STORE - NIGHT
text: They exit the store.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Where are we going?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: We? I'm going home. And, judging by
dialog: that coat, I'd say you have to get
text: back to the barber college.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: No, I'm lost.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: You're lost?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Say,...did you just lose your job
dialog: because of me?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Forget it. I'm sick of working for
dialog: that dickhead.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Dickhead?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: A walking penis capable of intelligent
text: speech. A dickhead.
text: A mental picture of that causes Adam to slump against a
text: store window and drop his box of cards.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: What's wrong with you?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I just had a mental picture of...
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Here, pick these up!
text: Together they pick up the cards.
speaker_heading: EVE (cont'd)
dialog: Where are you parked?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I came on a bus.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Why doesn't that surprise me?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I don't know. Why doesn't it?
text: They rise.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Well, I guess because I'm a little
dialog: psychic...I have this thing.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Oh, that's nice.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Let me guess something. This is your
dialog: first visit to La La Land. You're
dialog: staying somewhere over in Hollywood
dialog: because, like an idiot, you thought
dialog: that would be an exciting place to
dialog: stay. Right so far?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (could be a question, could
dialog: be an answer.)
dialog: So far?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Yes, I'm right?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus
dialog: and before you know it, you're out
dialog: here in the San Fernando Valley
dialog: without a clue. Which brings us to
dialog: here. Correct again?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Again.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Where are you staying? The Holiday
dialog: Inn?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's
dialog: exactly right!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but
dialog: pretty much. That was pretty good,
dialog: wasn't it?!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: It was amazing.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a
dialog: bus for you to get on.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Do you own a car?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I'm not taking you there, Sweetie.
dialog: Rule Number One in North America: No
text: strangers in the car.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: If it will make you feel any better, I
dialog: don't have a gun.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: You don't?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Well, that changes everything. Get the
dialog: fuck away from me!! I mean it!!
text: She races around the corner. He goes after her.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I'm sorry! I said something wrong,
dialog: didn't I! Please forgive me!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Get away from me!!
text: She runs into a parking lot. He follows.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Wait! Please wait! I'll make a deal
dialog: with you! I'll give you a Rogers
dialog: Hornsby, if you'll take me to the
dialog: hotel!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Rogers Hornsby?!?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: He's all yours. I was holding him
dialog: back.
text: Adam takes a Hornsby card from his coat pocket and shows
dialog: it to her.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Rogers Hornsby's worth like four
dialog: thousand dollars!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: So what?! I've got two of him!
dialog: (removing more cards from his
dialog: pocket)
dialog: And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons.
dialog: I was holding these out, too.
text: She arrives at her car (dirty GEO) and anxiously unlocks
text: the driver's door.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: So for four thousand dollars, all I
dialog: have to do is drive you to your hotel?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: And that's it?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I don't have to take a physical in
dialog: your space ship?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Heck, no! What?!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Okay. What the hell? You got a deal.
dialog: Get in.
text: She gets in. He gets in the back seat behind her.
speaker_heading: EVE (cont'd)
dialog: The front seat!
text: He runs around to the front while Eve chats with herself.
speaker_heading: EVE (cont'd)
dialog: Why am I doing this? What in the hell
dialog: is wrong with me? That's what I'd like
dialog: to know.

speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: It's Webber. Adam Webber.
speaker_heading: EVE

speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Wait! Wait!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: What is it?!
speaker_heading: ADAM

dialog: cranked!
text: She turns Perry way up.
scene_heading: EXT. AVENUE

scene_heading: INT. CAR

speaker_heading: EVE

speaker_heading: ADAM

speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: My father is a genius.
speaker_heading: BELLBOY

speaker_heading: BELLBOY

dialog: You don't look thirty-five.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: How old do I look?
speaker_heading: BELLBOY
dialog: Twenty-five? Around there.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I guess living up here makes people
dialog: look older.
speaker_heading: BELLBOY
dialog: Up here on the fifteenth floor?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (catching himself)
dialog: Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor.
dialog: Goodnight.
speaker_heading: BELLBOY

scene_heading: INT. LOBBY

speaker_heading: ADAM

speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Okay, down boy. (holds up the baseball
dialog: card) I can't take this for driving
dialog: you home. I wish I could, but I can't.

speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Take it. damn it!
speaker_heading: ADAM

speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Okay! Damn!
text: She stops, he stops.
speaker_heading: EVE (CONT'D)
dialog: I should have taken the money and run!

speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Troy? Is he your husband? Or a
dialog: boyfriend?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (eyes to heaven)
dialog: Thank-Q!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Oh, stop that! God! Listen, I know
dialog: you like me. I can tell. But you know
dialog: what? A lot of guys like me. Not me,
dialog: exactly. It's more like the legs or
dialog: the butt or the hair. Or some
dialog: combination of the above.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I think it's the eyes.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: The eyes. Okay. An eye-man. Anyhow,
dialog: it never works out. Okay? Not that
dialog: you even need to know that! You look
dialog: like crap, by the way. What have you

speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Why doesn't it never work out?
speaker_heading: EVE

speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Why does it never work out? You

speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Why?! Who the hell knows?!
text: He follows closely. She stops.
speaker_heading: EVE (cont'd)
dialog: Okay, if you promise to leave me
dialog: alone, I'll tell you.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: ...Okay.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: It never works out because I'm into
dialog: legs and butts and hair myself!
dialog: That's why! So I wind up with guys who
dialog: are very good looking, but
dialog: even more shallow than I am, if you
dialog: can picture that.
dialog: Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go
text: find another low-paying, demeaning job
dialog: where some guy named Jerry keeps
dialog: telling me how lousy his marriage is.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Why not go to work for me?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Doing what?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Selling all my baseball cards.
dialog: And helping me buy enough food and

speaker_heading: EVE

speaker_heading: ADAM

speaker_heading: MANAGER

speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I just work for the guy.

scene_heading: EXT. HOLIDAY INN - THAT NIGHT

speaker_heading: EVE

speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: EVE

speaker_heading: ADAM

speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: It does?
speaker_heading: EVE

speaker_heading: ADAM

speaker_heading: ADAM

speaker_heading: EVE

dialog: I forgot some of my stuff.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Your stuff? Let me see that.
text: She looks in the box. Holds up a pair of old briefs.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: You came back for these?
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: Hey, they're Ralph Laurens. And who's
dialog: this interesting looking fellow?
speaker_heading: EVE
text: This is Adam. Adam, meet Cliff.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (offering hand)
dialog: How do you do?
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: I do fine, Adam. How 'bout yourself?
dialog: (eyeing Eve)
dialog: You doin' any good?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Go home, Cliff, wherever that might
dialog: be.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: Shana Gillroy's apartment. Remember
dialog: her? The model who went to Harvard?
dialog: Well, I better get going! Bye, Adam.
dialog: Nice coat!
text: Cliff smiles and bounces down the steps.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Why, thank you! Very nice to have met
dialog: you, Cliff!
dialog: (then to her)
dialog: May I ask you a question?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: He's a former boyfriend. We lived
dialog: together for about six months. And
dialog: yes, I'll admit it. I've still kind
dialog: of got a thing for him.
dialog: (entering the house)
dialog: That's what you wanted to know, isn't
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (following)
dialog: Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff
dialog: likes to wear another man's
text: underpants.
speaker_heading: EVE
speaker_heading: (OC)
dialog: What?!
scene_heading: INT. EVE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Very good music is playing. Adam listens to one speaker
text: then crosses to listen to the other. Then he goes back to
dialog: the first.
scene_heading: INT.EVE'S KITCHEN - SAME TIME
text: Eve is pouring champagne into a glass that contains two
text: sugar cubes. Next she adds several dashes of bitters.
text: TROY, HER GAY ROOMMATE, throws together a tray of
text: appetizers as dinner cooks on the stove.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Eve! This guy is un-be-liev-able!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I knew you'd like him.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Darlin', this is X-File stuff! Think
dialog: about it! The guy's got all this
dialog: easily negotiable property. He's
dialog: obviously setting something up very
text: big. Like a self-sustaining island
dialog: off the coast of South America, for
dialog: instance. Or perhaps he's the head of
dialog: a cult that's doing weird things with
dialog: poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard
dialog: worse.
text: He rushes out with the tray.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Troy enters with sushi appetizers. Adam is looking at the
dialog: ceiling.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: You have very nice ceilings.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: I do? Well, thank you! You like
dialog: ceilings?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Not particularly.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea
text: urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori"
dialog: if you prefer. I love sushi.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I love Lucy!
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: You nut!
text: Eve enters with Adam's drink and two white wines.
dialog: .
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Here you go. One champagne cocktail.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Thank-Q!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I thought only hookers drank those
dialog: things.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
text: Eve and Troy look at each other as she hands him his
dialog: wine.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Dinner in fifteen minutes. Why don't
text: we sit and chat.
dialog: They do.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: So, Adam...where on earth are you
dialog: from?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Out-of-town. That's all he'll say.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: It's a very small place. People don't
dialog: even know it's there.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: And it's called...?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Maybe Eve can guess. She's psychic.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Really? Since when?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (defensive)
dialog: Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm
dialog: Springs.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Oh, yes.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?
speaker_heading: ADAM
text: Right on the button.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home
dialog: town.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Give me your hand.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Oh, my God...
text: Adam holds out his hand and she takes it, rubbing her
text: finger slowly and gently around in his palm. For her,
text: it's psychic stuff. For him, it's spine-tingling.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Okay, let's see...I'm not promising
dialog: anything. You okay?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Um-hum.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow.
dialog: Way up North. Are we getting hot?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: You live in...Alaska. The only way in
dialog: or out of your place is by plane
dialog: and... you've definitely come down
dialog: here for food and supplies and... to
dialog: find a wife!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Wow.
text: She tosses back his hand and grabs her wine for a victory
text: gulp.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: That's right?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (to Eve)
dialog: I've never met anyone like you in my
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: She's right?!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Hey, butthead, I'm clairvoyant.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I've got goose-bumps all over me.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Why not just go to... Nome for
dialog: supplies and a wife? Isn't that
dialog: closer?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Yeah, right! That's where you'd go to
dialog: find girls! Nome. He's gay, by the
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Good for you.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask
dialog: you a few questions. When did Alaska
dialog: become a state?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: 1959.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Who use to own it?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Russia.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: When did we get it from them?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: 1867. Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2
dialog: million dollars for it. A tidy sum
dialog: then, as well as now. I'm quoting my
dialog: father, of course.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: What's the capitol?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Juneau.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Hello! It's Anchorage! Gotcha!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Sorry, that's the largest city.
text: Troy jumps up and runs out of the room.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Where's he gone?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: He's gone to check your answers on his
dialog: computer.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: He has a computer?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: In the house?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: No. We keep it in the backyard. Of
text: course, in the house. It's in there.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: May I please be excused?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Uh...yeah.
speaker_heading: TROY'S OFFICE
text: He has "Alaska" on his computer screen. Adam enters and
text: looks at the computer, which captivates him.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: This must be very new.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: It's so small.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: What are you talking about? This is
dialog: the new Mac. You a hacker?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: You don't have a computer in your
dialog: cabin?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: How do you get through those winters?
dialog: (reading screen)
dialog: Well, you're right. Juneau.
dialog: (then, covering the
dialog: screen with his hand)
dialog: What's the highest peak?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Mt. McKinley. It's also the highest
dialog: point in North America.
speaker_heading: TROY
text: (after peeking at the screen)
dialog: Okay, maybe she is psychic. Let's go
dialog: eat!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (indicating computer)
dialog: That would knock my father out.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Oh, yes.
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: It would probably kill him.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: He's a Windows guy then, huh?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Yes. He likes windows.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Well, I think Windows stink. What do
dialog: you think of that?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: ...I guess it's...just a matter of
dialog: personal taste.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: True.
text: Troy exits. Adam follows.
text: (EDITORIAL: Scenes 131, 132, and 133 should follow scene
dialog: 134 rather than precede it.)
scene_heading: INT. SHELTER, MASTER BEDROOM - SAME TIME
text: Calvin Webber is sleeping soundly. Helen stands quietly
text: at the door looking at him. She finishes off her
text: champagne cocktail and very quietly shuts the door.
scene_heading: INT. ANTEROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Helen goes into the elevator. Obviously, she's had too
dialog: much to drink.
scene_heading: INT. MALT SHOP - MOMENTS LATER
text: The floor rumbles and the metal doors open emitting the
text: red light. Soda Jerk and TEN OF HIS FOLLOWERS stand up
text: expectantly and anxiously. Helen appears--and looks at
dialog: this terribly odd assortment of people.
speaker_heading: SODA JERK
dialog: Who are you?!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (beat, then)
dialog: I'm the mother.
speaker_heading: SODA JERK
dialog: It's the mother!!
text: And they all fall down on their knees and worship her
text: with much wailing and rejoicing. Several speak in
text: tongues. Helen stares at them wide-eyed, presses the
text: button on the control box, and goes back down.
scene_heading: INT. DINING TABLE - NIGHT
text: Adam's impeccable table manners serve to highlight Eve's
text: and Troy's utter lack of same.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: But first, you have to start with the
dialog: clothes!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Exactly.
dialog: (then to Adam)
dialog: You understand that, don't you? You
dialog: have no chance of meeting a woman
dialog: dressed like that.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: All right.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (to Troy)
dialog: So, what are you seeing?
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: (looking Adam over)
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Money is no object. He's got cards up
dialog: the wazoo.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: The what?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Wazoo! Try to listen.
dialog: (then to Troy)
dialog: Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip-
dialog: hop, Euro trash?
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: You're serious, aren't you?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: What's that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: It means that your taste in men's
dialog: apparel is as bad as your taste in
dialog: men.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Well, that's blunt!
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: And I suppose you see him in some sort
dialog: of strapless thing, don't you?
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: I see "elegant."
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: That's what I'm sensing.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: The guy with the underpants!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: That's boring!
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: (indicating Adam)
dialog: Not on him.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I'm not wearing his pants.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Why not? He has great pants.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I just don't want to.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Why don't you take him and pick out
dialog: his clothes?
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Alright, I will.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (talking with her mouth full)
dialog: I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to
dialog: buy six thousand paper napkins.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: What do you think, Adam?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: About clothing?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Whatever you two want. If you've got
dialog: the time, I've got the wazoo.
text: Eve and Troy watch him eat for a beat or two.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Isn't it a little tiring to sit up
dialog: straight like that?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: What about holding your right arm up
dialog: like that all the time?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: It's fine. Just give it a try.
dialog: And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot
dialog: off the chair!
text: She does. Eve and Troy emulate Adam.

speaker_heading: SCENE 136 OMITTED
scene_heading: EXT. EVE'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Troy and Adam get out of Eve's car with a lot of
text: packages. They head for the house.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I guess a lot of those tall buildings
dialog: we saw this morning are new.
speaker_heading: TROY
text: Almost all of them.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: The recovery is very impressive.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they
dialog: rebuilt the freeway in six months.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Amazing. I'm very impressed.
scene_heading: INT. EVE'S HOUSE - SAME DAY
text: Eve is on the couch doing her toenails when Adam and Troy
text: enter. Adam is in a casually elegant outfit that looks
text: terrific. Both he and Troy are carrying lots of other
dialog: packages and garment bags. We see names like Gucci,
text: Armani and Lauren. Eve is visibly impressed by Adam's
dialog: makeover.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Well, what do you think?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I think...it...works.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Let me show you the entire trousseau!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: But first let me show her these!
text: He reaches into a bag and removes a box that contains --
text: a pair of rollerblades.
speaker_heading: ADAM (cont'd)
dialog: Eve, can I skate around your block?
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: (making it sexual)
dialog: How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around
dialog: your block?

scene_heading: EXT. VENICE BEACH - LATER, SAME DAY
text: There is a most unusual band shell location on the beach
text: that is completely covered by graffiti. Eve and Troy sit
text: at one of the many stone tables watching Adam skate all
text: over the place. He wears spandex workout pants and a T-
dialog: shirt.
text: The starting CRANE SHOT begins on the nearly deserted
dialog: commercial section of Venice Beach and then takes us to
dialog: the band shell.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - CLOSER
text: of him skating and them watching.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: He's going to kill himself.
dialog: (then, to Adam)
dialog: Go skate out on the bike path! It's
dialog: that way!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Okay!
text: He heads out of the band shell. We follow him as he
text: skates into an area that has been given over to the
text: homeless. They sit around in their sleeping bags and
text: blankets and cheer (and jeer) Adam when he passes by. He
dialog: takes them to be more mutants.
scene_heading: EXT. BIKE PATH - CONTINUOUS
text: Adam skates to it and is amazed to see two very pretty
text: girls skating in their tiny bikinis. A nearly nude body-
text: builder guy goes by on a bike. Then Adam sees the ocean.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - WAVES
text: breaking on the beach and rocks.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS
text: Adam tosses off his roller-blades and walks trance-like
text: towards the waves.
scene_heading: ANGLE - TROY AND EVE
text: appear on a dune behind him and watch.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - ADAM
text: Adam raises his arms to greet the ocean, perhaps like a
text: Plains Indian would. Then he joyously runs into the surf
text: and dives.
scene_heading: ANGLE - TROY AND EVE
dialog: watching.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: That water's freezing!
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: He's from Alaska.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - ADAM

scene_heading: ANGLE - TROY AND EVE
speaker_heading: TROY

speaker_heading: ANGLE - ADAM
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I LOVE THIS!!
dialog: Begin the record "YMCA" over this.
scene_heading: INT. EVE'S LIVING ROOM - NEXT DAY
text: Eve enters from her morning shower to find Troy and Adam
text: goofing to The Village People song. She gives Troy a
text: disapproving look.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: (defensive)
dialog: What?! He wanted to hear some
dialog: standards!
dialog: (My hip daughters tell me that "YMCA" is enjoying a huge

scene_heading: EXT. EVE'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS
text: Eve hurries to Adam who is sitting on a lawn chair in the
text: middle of the small back yard, enjoying the rain. She
text: holds the umbrella over her head.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Hey, Eve!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Have you ever heard the saying, "He
dialog: hasn't got enough sense to come in out
dialog: of the rain?"
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Yep.
dialog: (then watching the rain hit
dialog: the palm of his hand)
dialog: You know, my father -- who is a
dialog: scientist -- says that everything is a
dialog: miracle. Everything. Until recently I
dialog: wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still
dialog: want to go girl hunting tonight?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I certainly do!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Okay. But you know, this business of
dialog: finding you a wife -- it's kind of
dialog: ridiculous, don't you think?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (rising)
dialog: No it's not!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a
dialog: wife? I mean...
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Then just help me find a girlfriend!
dialog: That's all I ask.
dialog: I'll give you every single card I've
dialog: got left!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm
dialog: just somebody you can buy off! Listen,
dialog: let me tell you something--
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (taking her by the arms)
dialog: Would you do it just because you're my
dialog: friend? My very best friend.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Well...yeah. Okay.
text: He hugs her.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Thank Q, Eve!

speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Why did you park way back there?
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Miss Rustokov refuses to let total

speaker_heading: ADAM

text: Eve looks like she owns the place.
scene_heading: INT. NIGHT CLUB ANTEROOM - SAME TIME
text: As they enter Adam grabs Troy, who is leading the way.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Ladies first, Troy! That was close.
text: Adam and Troy follow Eve in. The club is NOISY AND
text: HOPPING. The house music is from the 40's. Adam, Eve and
text: Troy enter a long corridor of booths and walk forward.
dialog: Adam's got on that terrific dark suit. Women notice. Eve
text: notices them noticing.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: My goodness gracious! This place is
dialog: something!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Look unimpressed.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Bored even.
text: Adam gives it a shot and goes too bored.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Vaguely bored!
text: He gets vaguely bored but misses unimpressed by a mile.
speaker_heading: EVE
text: Unimpressed, but still interested.
text: He tries that. It's like watching a neon sign switch back
dialog: and forth: First interested, then not.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: No! Not crazy!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Do I look crazy?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Be loose.
text: He overplays that.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Just be yourself.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Always good advice.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: For him. It doesn't work for the rest

scene_heading: INT. MAIN ROOM

speaker_heading: ANGLE - BAR
text: JASON and JONATHAN wave when they see Eve and Troy

dialog: that's them!
text: They shake.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: How do you do?! It's very nice to meet
dialog: you, Jason and Jonathan!
dialog: (confidentially, to them)
dialog: My mother always told me that if you

dialog: easier to remember their names if you
dialog: use those names right away.
text: Jason and Jonathan just stare at him.
speaker_heading: TROY

speaker_heading: ADAM

speaker_heading: SOPHIE

speaker_heading: ADAM

speaker_heading: ADAM (OC)

speaker_heading: EVE (OC)
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Why?! I think she's very attractive.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Adam! She's got bitch written all
dialog: over her! You do know what "bitch"
dialog: means, don't you?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't
dialog: understand for the life of me why you
dialog: would call her that! Or why Cliff
dialog: would say that about you.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Because we're bitches! Look at her!
dialog: Look at the expression on her face!
dialog: The walk, the jewelry, the
dialog: fingernails. Please!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: How 'bout this one?
text: "This one" is a KILLER BLOND.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Are you kidding?! You wouldn't even

speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Eve?!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Well, I'm trying to educate him! It's

speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Adam, I think for you, we should go
dialog: for "sweet."
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Okay. I like that.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (swigging her drink)
dialog: Yeah, sweet. That's a nice way of
dialog: putting it.
speaker_heading: ADAM

speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Um... Eve?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: It's not so much what you say but how
dialog: you say it. Women like men who are
dialog: unpredictable.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Yes, really! Basically, they want what
dialog: they think they can't have. Same with
dialog: guys. That's why everybody is walking
dialog: around here sending off "you can't
dialog: have me" signals!
scene_heading: ANGLE OF MEN AND WOMEN
dialog: doing precisely that. Then:
dialog: BACK TO TABLE
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: That's ridiculous.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Maybe. But that's how it works.
speaker_heading: TROY
text: Ah-ha! There's " Miss Sweet." At the
dialog: hors d'oeuvres table!
scene_heading: INTERCUT - MISS SWEET
text: She's a pretty young thing with a sweet face.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Yeah. Could be. Go say hello, Romeo.
dialog: Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (very serious)
dialog: Okay. All right.
dialog: (then)
dialog: And what do I say?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Say something surprising. And funny.
dialog: Lie, if need be.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Yes! Lying is always a very effective
dialog: dating tool.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Okay. Thank you, my friends.
text: Adam rises.
speaker_heading: ADAM (cont'd)
dialog: By the way, that's a great play.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ADAM
text: Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Did you?
text: Adam nods and shoves off.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: I'm not sure I want to watch this.
text: Eve puts her hand to her head -- hating herself and still
dialog: not sure exactly why.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - ADAM
text: crossing to Miss Sweet.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Surprising and funny. Well, I know a
dialog: duck who bought some lip balm...
scene_heading: INT. HORS D'OEUVRES TABLE
text: Adam sheepishly approaches Miss Sweet, then gathers
dialog: himself:
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Hi!
speaker_heading: MISS SWEET
dialog: (not sweet)
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (beat, then)
dialog: I was wondering if you might help me.
dialog: I...I seem to have lost my
dialog: Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere
dialog: around here.
text: Miss Sweet stares at him for a beat or two, then
text: chuckles.
speaker_heading: MISS SWEET
dialog: Oh, now, that's a great one!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (big smile)
dialog: You like it?
speaker_heading: MISS SWEET
dialog: (a little clap)
dialog: Bravo!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Thank-Q!
text: They both laugh.
scene_heading: ANGLE - EVE AND TROY
text: Stunned...as they watch Adam and Miss Sweet. Another
text: pretty young woman (HEATHER) joins Adam.
scene_heading: ANGLE - ADAM AND GIRLS
text: Heather is a friend of Miss Sweet's.
speaker_heading: MISS SWEET
dialog: This is my new friend...
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I'm Adam Webber.
speaker_heading: MISS SWEET
dialog: He's really funny!
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Hi! I'm Heather!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: "Heather?" I don't believe I've ever
dialog: heard that name before.
text: There's a slight beat before both girls laugh.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Yeah, right!
speaker_heading: MISS SWEET
dialog: I told you! He's funny!
scene_heading: ANGLE - EVE AND TROY
text: More stunned. Eve finds that she very much hates watching
text: Adam having a good time with other healthy non-mutants.
scene_heading: ANGLE - ADAM AND HIS NEW FRIENDS
speaker_heading: MISS SWEET
dialog: We work on Rodeo Drive. But we're
dialog: both professional dancers.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: You dance?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I took a dance lesson everyday of my
dialog: life until a couple of days ago.
speaker_heading: MISS SWEET
dialog: You're kidding!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
speaker_heading: MISS SWEET
dialog: Your mom was a dancer?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You
dialog: would like her very much! Shall we
dialog: dance?
speaker_heading: MISS SWEET
dialog: Sure.
text: They head for the dance floor.
scene_heading: ANGLE - TROY AND EVE
dialog: watching.
scene_heading: ANGLE - THE FLOOR
text: A jitterbug song comes on and so does Adam.
text: He and Miss Sweet are a little rough on take-off, but
text: they hit smooth sailing soon enough. He's terrific at
text: picking up the new stuff she shows him.
scene_heading: ANGLE - EVE & TROY
text: They are shocked.
scene_heading: ANGLE - DANCE FLOOR
text: Heather cuts in on Miss Sweet as the other dancers stop
dialog: to watch someone who is so much better than them. The
text: three of them begin to dance together.
scene_heading: ANGLE - TROY & EVE
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: You know, he's a very, very good--
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Shut up!
scene_heading: ANGLE - DANCE FLOOR/ EVE
text: Adam dances beautifully with the two women. We CUT BACK
text: AND FORTH between them and Eve.
scene_heading: ANGLE - DANCE FLOOR
text: Adam, Miss Sweet and Heather complete their dance with
text: great aplomb. Other dancers applaud them. Someone is
text: WHISTLING LOUDLY OFF CAMERA. Adam and his dance partners
dialog: look over to:
speaker_heading: ANGLE - EVE
text: She is whistling like a guy calling his dog. Troy is
dialog: embarrassed.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Must you...
text: Eve points at Adam and beckons broadly for him to come
text: over -- a basketball coach calling her player off the
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: What in the hell is wrong with you?!!
scene_heading: ANGLE - DANCE FLOOR
speaker_heading: MISS SWEET
dialog: Is that your girl friend?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: No. Would you please excuse me?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: If you'll please come back.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I will certainly try. And thank you
dialog: both very much for the dance.
text: He leaves.
speaker_heading: MISS SWEET
dialog: When was the last time you saw manners
dialog: like that?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Yeah. It's like meeting a foreigner
dialog: or something.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - TABLE
text: as Adam comes over. The music is not so loud now.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (to Troy)
dialog: Go to the bathroom.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Right here?
dialog: (then, off her look)
dialog: Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't
dialog: sure!
text: Troy rises and exits. Adam arrives and sits down.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: You wanted to see me!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: You're not from Alaska! Where'd you
dialog: learn to dance like that?! And there
dialog: are no starving people, are there?!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Don't change the subject! I want you
dialog: to tell me the truth about yourself.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I've never lied to you. I've maybe
dialog: let you believe things that you wanted
dialog: to believe, but I've never lied.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't
dialog: you?!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: No. I admire you. I...I fell in love
dialog: with you the first time I saw you.
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: I did. I think that you are the most--
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I want to know exactly who you are and
dialog: what you're really up to!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: All right. Let me tell you the whole
dialog: thing. In 1962--
speaker_heading: CLIFF (OC)
dialog: Well, well, well. Don't we clean up
dialog: nice?
text: Cliff steps up to the table. Adam, automatically a
text: gentleman, rises and offers his hand.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Hello, Cliff, how are you this
dialog: evening?
text: Cliff barely shakes his hand.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: Not bad.
text: Then he sits in Adam's seat.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: But I do miss that green sport coat of
dialog: yours.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Thank you very much. But, Cliff,
dialog: that's my seat. And I was just--
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: (to Eve)
dialog: How 'bout a drink at the bar?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (pause, then)
dialog: Sure.
text: They rise. Cliff gestures to the chair.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: It's all yours.
text: Eve and Cliff go to the bar. Adam sits down glumly. He
text: looks across the room and catches the eye of Miss Sweet
text: who is seated at a table with Heather. A GOOD LOOKING
text: GUY is hitting on them. CUTTING BACK AND FORTH between
text: Adam and them we see Miss Sweet's smile escalate. Then
text: she nudges Heather who also looks over and smiles. Adam
text: smiles back. Finish with a CLOSER SHOT OF HIS POV of
text: Miss Sweet's hair, butt and legs.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - BAR
text: Eve and Cliff are in cozy conversation at the bar.
text: Jonathan, Jason, and Sophie are in the bg.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - Troy
text: returning from the restroom. He is surprised to see Eve
text: at the bar with Cliff. When he looks back at the dance
text: floor table, Adam is not there.
scene_heading: ANGLE - EVE AND CLIFF
dialog: Sipping wine.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: So where is your roommate, the model?
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: You know, I don't know. And looking
dialog: at you, I don't care. It's been too
dialog: long, Eve.
speaker_heading: ADAM (OC)
dialog: Please excuse this interruption.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: Oh, brother...
speaker_heading: WIDER - BAR
text: Adam steps closer, looking past Cliff at Eve.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and
dialog: please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't
dialog: Cliff just a butt with hair?
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and
dialog: hair. Well, isn't he? And shallow,
dialog: as well?
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: (the shallowest guy in the
dialog: world)
dialog: Shallow? I'm shallow?!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Go home, Adam. Go to your hotel.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
text: He gives Adam a shove.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to
dialog: defend myself.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: Do ya?
text: Cliff throws a right which Adam calmly blocks and
text: counters with a short right jab to Cliff's mouth,
text: snapping his head back. It's not a big punch, but very,
text: very quick. It makes Eve mad and astonishes Troy, Jason
dialog: and Jonathan.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Stop it, you two!
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: (slightly insecure)
dialog: I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (lowering his guard)
dialog: Yes, I agree.
text: Cliff draws back another right. Adam flicks out a quick
text: left to Cliff's cheek, again snapping his head back, but
dialog: not his body. (These aren't big movie hits.) Cliff takes
text: a beat or two then draws back his right fist again. Adam
text: pops him in the nose. Cliff drops his right arm to his
dialog: side.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Adam?!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: (increasingly insecure)
dialog: Maybe we shouldn't fight at all.
text: Fighting is pretty immature.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (lowering his guard)
dialog: It certainly is. I agree with you
dialog: completely.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: Eve? I'm leaving.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I don't blame you!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (turning to Eve)
dialog: Eve, I'm sorry.
text: Seeing an opportunity, Cliff rears back with another
text: right. Adam deftly pops him in the mouth again with a
text: short right jab.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: (deeply insecure)
dialog: Well, good night, everyone.
text: Troy, Jonathan and Jason say good night to him. Cliff
text: walks unsteadily away bleeding from the mouth and both
text: nostrils. (Hopeful that no one has noticed that he's very
dialog: subtly just gotten the crap beat out of him.)
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I'm leaving, too.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: But, Eve, I would--
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you
dialog: out--because I quit! This is
dialog: ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm
dialog: ridiculous!
text: She exits. Adam looks over at Troy who shrugs.
scene_heading: EXT. EVE'S HOUSE - MIDNIGHT
text: Troy takes out his keys as he approaches the front door.
text: But the door opens. Eve stands there in sweats. Agitated.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: He go back to the hotel?
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Uh..he might of.
scene_heading: INT. EVE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Troy enters. She slams the door.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: What's that mean?
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: We did not leave together.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Who did he leave with?
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: What's it to you?!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I'm his pimp. He left with the
dialog: dancers, didn't he?
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the
dialog: psychic pimp. You tell me.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Those sluts!
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?
text: He enters the kitchen
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN
text: She follows him: He gets something to drink.
dialog: .
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: To bed.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: To bed?
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Yeah. I'm not the one who's in love
dialog: with the guy.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: What?! Now hold on! Wait one damn
dialog: minute!
text: Troy exits into his office.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE
text: He plops down on the chair.
dialog: .
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: In the first place, I don't fall in
dialog: love with weirdos I've only known for
dialog: four or five days.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Yes, you do.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: And I don't fall in love with grown
dialog: men who collect baseball cards!!
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Uh, yes, you do.
speaker_heading: EVE
text: Or pee in their pants when they see
dialog: the ocean!
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Yes, you do!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Or have perfect table manners.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: (sitting up)
dialog: You know, I asked him about that. And
dialog: he said that good manners are a way we
dialog: have of showing other people that we
dialog: respect them. See, you'd eat like a
dialog: slob if you
dialog: were alone, but since another human
dialog: being is present, you show that person
dialog: respect by going to the trouble of
dialog: having proper manners. I didn't know
dialog: that. I thought it was a way of
dialog: appearing superior.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Know what else he told me?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (sitting on the bed)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: He thinks that I am a gentleman and
dialog: that you are a lady!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Well, consider the source. I don't
dialog: even know what a lady is.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Exactly! I thought a gentleman was
dialog: somebody who owned horses. Turns out,
dialog: the short and very simple definition
dialog: of a gentleman or a lady is: someone
dialog: who always attempts to make the people
dialog: around him or her feel as comfortable
dialog: as possible. That's it! If you don't
dialog: do that, nothing else matters. The
dialog: cars, the clothes, the houses...
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Where did he get all that information?
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: From the oddest place. His parent's
dialog: told him. I don't think I got that
dialog: memo.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: So now I suppose he's trying to make
dialog: those two dancers feel as comfortable
dialog: as possible.
speaker_heading: TROY
text: He didn't leave with them.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: TROY
text: He left with Sophie.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: What?!!
speaker_heading: TROY
text: It's true. She swept him out the door
dialog: whispering little French things into
text: his ear.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please
dialog: don't tell me that!!
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: What are you going to do? Go over to
dialog: her place and kick in the door?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: You're goddamn right I am!
text: She exits, then sticks her hand back in.
speaker_heading: EVE (cont'd)
dialog: You coming?!
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: (cringing)
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Coward!
text: She exits.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Gentleman coward, to you.
speaker_heading: SCENE 148 OMITTED
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Eve hurries out of the house leaving the front door wide
text: open. She runs down the porch steps, across the yard,
text: and to her car, which she unlocks with the usual
text: fumbling.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Come on! Come on, damn it!
scene_heading: INT. CAR
text: She jumps in and sticks the key in the ignition. Adam
text: appears at the passenger window.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Hi!
text: Eve SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER as she throws open her door and
text: jumps out into the street where she falls down, hurting
text: her knee. Adam runs around the car to help her to her
text: feet. Dogs start barking in several houses.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Eve?!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Scare me, why don't you?!!? You
dialog: stupid son of a bitch!!!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I'm really sorry!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: What in the hell are you doing here!!
dialog: You're supposed to be over on San
dialog: Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex
dialog: with that slut Sophie!!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I know...and I'm really sorry.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Well, you should be! Thanks to you,
dialog: my heart is in my neck!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Goodnight!
text: Eve marches, with a limp, back to the house.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Look! I'm limping! How attractive is
dialog: that?! What if this is for life?!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I know first aid!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Well, you had better!!
text: He chases her up the porch steps.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - THIRTY MINUTES LATER
text: Lights are low and warm. Adam is attempting to swab the
text: abrasion on Eve's knee through the tear in her old sweat
dialog: pants.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Wait a minute.
text: She reaches down and gives the knee hole a good rip,
text: revealing her leg from above the knee to the gym sock.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: There.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Thanks.
text: He takes the back of her calf in one hand and applies the
text: antiseptic to her knee with the other. It stings and she
text: flinches.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Steady. Steady. It's going to be all
dialog: right in no time.
text: He leans down and blows on the wound. CU of that. CU of
text: his hand on her calf. CU of her looking down at him,
text: watching as he blows gently on her knee.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I went to Sophie's and she was very
dialog: hospitable.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Is that what you call it?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: But it just wasn't where I wanted to
dialog: be so I left as politely as I could
dialog: and found a taxi. But I asked the
dialog: driver to drop me here instead of at
dialog: the hotel. There's a song Mister Como
dialog: sings called "On the Street Where You
dialog: Live." You know it?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Sing it to me.
speaker_heading: ADAM
text: (softly, saying it as much as
dialog: singing it)
dialog: "All at once am I--several stories
dialog: high-- knowing I'm--on the street--
dialog: where you live." It's about a young
dialog: man who is overjoyed just to be
text: standing in front of the house of the
dialog: person he loves.
text: She reaches down, and taking hold of his collar, draws
text: him to her and they kiss very romantically and at length.
dialog: Then:
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Adam...dumb question, but humor me.
dialog: Have you ever had sex before?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: No.
text: She sits up.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: How is that possible?
text: During the following speech CAMERA pushes past him and
text: lingers on her as she gradually realizes that Adam is
dialog: mental.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (sitting up)
dialog: In 1962, when the bomb was dropped on
dialog: Los Angeles, my parents were in our
dialog: fallout shelter. That's where I was
dialog: born. We
dialog: only survived because it was a huge
dialog: shelter as fallout shelters go. My
dialog: father worked on it secretly for
dialog: years. When he had to, he used
dialog: contractors, but always from out-of-
dialog: state and always for just a portion of
dialog: the job. He told them it was a secret
dialog: government experiment done through
dialog: CalTech. My Dad's not a liar, but he
dialog: felt in this case he had no choice. Of
dialog: course, it had to be a secret, because
dialog: we had just enough supplies to last
dialog: three people thirty-five years. That's
dialog: also why I have no brothers or
dialog: sisters. The air vent was the really
dialog: tricky part, but he was able to cut
dialog: into a flood control sewer. What I'd
dialog: like to do Eve, is take you down into
dialog: the fallout shelter with me. We could
dialog: live there with my Mom and Dad. My dad
dialog: said if I found a healthy girl I
dialog: should "bring her on down". And you
dialog: look plenty healthy to me.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Uh-huh. Adam?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Yes, Eve?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I want you to go back to the hotel
dialog: now. I'll call you a cab.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Of course. I shouldn't be over here
dialog: at this hour.
text: He rises. She gets up and leads him to the door.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: That's right. And I'll see you in the
dialog: morning in the lobby. Do you mind
dialog: waiting outside for the taxi?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Not at all. And Eve thank you for
dialog: tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: My pleasure.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: It was at least as good as the sky.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Really? Okay!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: And I think better than the ocean. I'm
dialog: serious!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Neat. Goodnight!
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Adam comes out glowing with happiness. He looks
text: heavenward. And does his patented thumbs up.
text: Behind him we hear Eve locking all the locks on her front
dialog: door.
scene_heading: EXT. VALLEY AVENUE - DAY
text: A REFRIGERATED U-HAUL TRUCK lurches down the street.
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK
text: Adam struggles with the gears as Troy worries about his
dialog: driving skills.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Goddamn, Adam!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Wait a minute!
text: He promptly pulls over and turns off the engine.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in
dialog: vain again, didn't I? I'm so sorry.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: No! There's an Adult Bookstore back
dialog: there! I'll be right back!
text: Adam jumps out of the truck and runs off.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Without question, the strangest man
dialog: I've ever met.
scene_heading: EXT. ADULT BOOKSTORE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Adam runs up. The bookstore looks familiar. Adam runs
text: to the next store. It's a bar. He runs to the next
text: store. It's the Malt Shop. Adam is thrilled. He tries
text: the front door and at first it does not open.
scene_heading: INT. MALT SHOP
text: The Soda Jerk is leading about twelve followers in
dialog: prayers.
speaker_heading: SODA JERK
dialog: Give us a sign! That's all we ask!
dialog: Give us some sort of sign!
text: The front door opens and Adam peers in. He sees the Soda
text: Jerk; smiles broadly at him and waves. Then he closes
dialog: the
text: door. The Soda Jerk grabs his heart and faints. His
text: followers rush to his aid.
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER
text: Adam jumps in.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Okay, Troy! Let's get those all-beef
dialog: frozen patties!
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: How 'bout we check with Eve first?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: You bet!
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: So, did you buy a movie?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: A magazine? A toy perhaps? In the
dialog: bookstore.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (concentrating on his
dialog: driving)
dialog: No, I wouldn't go in one of those
text: places with a gas mask on.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: (laughing in agreement)
dialog: I know what you mean! I usually wear
text: a big hat and dark glasses.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Does that work?
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Yeah...Seems to.
dialog: Adam would not have thought that.
scene_heading: INT. EVE'S HOUSE - AN HOUR LATER
text: Adam springs in, Troy drags in behind him (knowing the
text: deal). Eve is standing away from the door next to a kind
text: looking professional woman named Dr.Aron.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Hi, Eve!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Hi, Adam. This is, uh....
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: How do you do?
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: Very well, thank you. I'm with the
dialog: County Family Services Department. Eve
dialog: tells me you've been living in a bomb
dialog: shelter most of your life.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my
dialog: associate -- Mr. Brown.
text: BROWN appears from the kitchen. He's good-sized man who
text: dresses casually. Adam becomes uneasy.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Hello.
text: He nods politely.
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: We want you to come with us so we can
dialog: talk some more about your experiences.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Come where?
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: My office.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: For how long?
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: Well, that depends...
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I thank you very much for the
dialog: invitation, but I'm quite busy today.
dialog: Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron.
dialog: It's the best thing. The best thing
dialog: for you. I promise.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: ...All right, Eve. If you say so.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: ...I do.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (to Aron)
dialog: Could I please just go home? I was
dialog: lost, but this morning I found home
dialog: and I promise not to bother any of you
dialog: ever again.
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: Let's go talk first, Adam.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
text: The two come forward. One opens the door and one beckons
dialog: for Adam to step out.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Good-bye, Adam.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Goodbye.
text: Adam looks back at Eve, who looks away. Adam exits.
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: (to Eve)
dialog: You'll be hearing from me.
text: She shuts the door. Troy sits dejectedly.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Well what was I supposed to do?! He
dialog: wants me to live underground with him!
dialog: That's like Silence of the Lambs,
dialog: don't you think?!
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: I know...I know. You did the right
dialog: thing.
text: Eve goes to the window and watches as WE SEE ADAM BREAK
text: FROM BROWN AND RUN OFF with him chasing.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Oh, no!
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: What?!
text: She runs out. He follows.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
text: Adam races down the sidewalk. He cuts left and runs
text: between houses. Brown is not as fast.
scene_heading: EXT. EVE'S FRONT YARD
text: Eve and Troy run out to Aron who is dialing her cell
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Oh, my God!
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: He'll catch him.
dialog: (then into phone)
dialog: Hi. This is Nina Aron. I've got a run
dialog: away and I'm going to need police
dialog: assistance.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: No! Not the police! Don't call them!
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: I have to. If a complaint is made and
dialog: the person resists obser--
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: No, I can't have that! They'll come
text: with their cars and their guns and
dialog: their handcuffs--
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: Calm down, please. This man needs help
dialog: and you need protection from him.
dialog: That's obvious.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: You know, I don't think so. I'm
dialog: confused but you know, I don't think
dialog: he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd
dialog: hurt anyone.
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: And now you must let me be the judge
dialog: of that!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I was frightened and I didn't know
dialog: what to think! But you know-I believe
dialog: him. I think he just wants to go home.
dialog: Wherever the hell that is...
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: Let's all remain calm. That's the key
dialog: thing.
text: Suddenly Adam appears from the side of the house,
text: startling everyone. He tosses his hotel key to Eve.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: The key to my hotel room! I want you
dialog: to have my baseball cards!
dialog: (running to the truck)
dialog: And please be sure to pay my bill!
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: Young man, stop right there!
text: Aron looks around for Mr. Brown.
text: Adam jumps into the truck. Aron yells for him to stop.
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: Stop, right now! Get out of that
dialog: truck!
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Adam, you really shouldn't try to
dialog: drive that truck!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (starting the engine)
dialog: Bye, Troy!
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Bye, Adam!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: And thanks for always being happy!
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Gay.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (yelling to Adam)
dialog: Well, you're...certainly welcome!
text: Adam gets the truck in reverse and backs out of the
text: driveway and into a parked car.
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: Hey!!! That's my car, you son of a
dialog: bitch!!
text: Getting the truck in first, Adam has to go down the
text: sidewalk a bungalow or two before he can get back onto
text: the street. He clips two parked cars as he does. Brown
text: comes running from the side of the house. His pants are
text: torn.
speaker_heading: ARON (cont'd)
dialog: Where the hell have you been?!
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I fell down!
dialog: (to Troy and Eve)
dialog: What's the license number of that
dialog: truck?!
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: Don't ask them! They're as fucked-up
dialog: as the other guy!
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Let's all just try to remain calm.
dialog: That's the key thing.
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: How 'bout I just knock the shit out of
dialog: you?!
text: Brown has to grab her.
scene_heading: EXT. U-STORE-IT - LATER, SAME DAY
text: Eve and Troy arrive in her GEO to see that the two locker
text: doors are open and much of the stuff has been carried
text: off. Eve drops her head in disappointment.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: I guess he took what he could.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (putting her head in her
dialog: hand)
dialog: Good God...you don't think there
dialog: really is a bomb shelter, do you?
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Fallout shelter.
text: She gives him a look.
speaker_heading: TROY (cont'd)
dialog: There's a difference.
scene_heading: INT. SHELTER, PATIO - LATER, SAME DAY
text: Helen is using the hip-reduction machine while Calvin
dialog: reads, How to Win Friends and Influence People. The
text: distant sound of the hatchway being open gets their
dialog: attention. Then:
speaker_heading: ADAM (OC)
dialog: Mom?! Dad?! I'm home!
text: They jump up and race into the living room, meeting Adam
text: halfway. The parents kiss and hug their son before
text: noticing that he's got the Soda Jerk with him.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I've got almost everything we need!
dialog: And this nice man...
speaker_heading: SODA JERK
dialog: Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.
text: He promptly drops to his knees in supplication.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: ...and his church group have
dialog: volunteered to help us bring the
dialog: supplies down. But we've got to
dialog: hurry.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Are you in trouble, son?!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I think I'm being chased by a
dialog: psychiatrist.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: A psychiatrist?!
speaker_heading: SODA JERK
dialog: It happens.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: My goodness! How bad is it up there?!
speaker_heading: SODA JERK
dialog: Horrible.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: You have something on your forehead.
speaker_heading: SODA JERK
dialog: I know.
scene_heading: INT. ADAM'S HOTEL ROOM - DUSK
text: Eve and Troy look around. She opens a drawer and sees
text: how nicely folded and put away things are. Troy notices
text: "TV Guide" and the Gideon Bible sitting out with a page
text: marker in it. He opens the night table drawer and takes
text: out the cigar box.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: This it?
text: Eve nods.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: What do you want to do with it?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Give it back to him.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: And if we can't find him?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: We'll find him.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM, ADAM'S HOTEL ROOM
text: Eve enters and looks at how tidy Adam's toiletries are;
text: how the comb is just right in the brush; how the tooth
text: paste (Ipanna in a '61 tube) has been squeezed from the
text: bottom; and at how he has hung up his socks to dry. It
text: makes her very sad. She picks up the toothpaste and
text: holds it as if it were his ring.
speaker_heading: TROY (OC)
dialog: Hey, Eve? Eve?
text: He enters with stock certificates and sees that she's
text: very close to crying.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I don't know. Everything's so neat.
dialog: It's all just so...goddamn dear.
dialog: (starting to cry)
dialog: Damn!
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: See these? Found them in the box with
dialog: the cards. These are stock
dialog: certificates. IBM. AT&T. Polaroid.
text: Instead of taking the certificates, she hands him the
text: toothpaste and sits down on the bed in a funk.
speaker_heading: TROY (cont'd)
dialog: (looking at the toothpaste)
dialog: Ipana. I think I remember that brand.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Oh, here, you should read this.
dialog: "Trademark, 1961."
text: He holds out the tube and she takes it to read.
scene_heading: EXT. REAR OF MALT SHOP - SAME TIME
text: Adam, the Soda Jerk and fifteen followers hurriedly
text: unload the truck, taking provisions into the back door of
dialog: the malt shop.
scene_heading: INT. JASON'S OFFICE - SAME TIME
text: Their pal Jason is on the phone with Troy.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: Purchased in 1958 and '59? Ten
dialog: thousand shares of each? They'd be
dialog: worth millions. Hell, I don't
dialog: know...millions upon millions upon
dialog: millions! How 'bout that?
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - EARLY EVENING
text: Troy is on the phone. Eve is standing, looking at the
dialog: stock certificates.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Thanks, Jason.
text: He slams down the phone and jumps to his feet.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Millions upon millions upon millions!
dialog: The cards. The stock! The clothes!
dialog: The toothpaste! The guy was on the
dialog: level! And you blew it! A man walks
dialog: into your life who is the kindest,
dialog: most polite, honest, trustworthy,
dialog: incredibly rich guy you have ever met
dialog: in your life!! And what do you do?!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Have him committed.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Yeah! That's thinking.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: He was always so "nice"! How was I
dialog: supposed to know that's a good thing?!
dialog: "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is
dialog: "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you
dialog: that.
dialog: (beat, then)
dialog: Was it ever?
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: I don't know. I like to think so.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Well, at least I fell for him before I
dialog: found out he was rich! That's new.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Wait a minute! He said today he knew
dialog: where home was. What happened this
dialog: morning?! Where did you go?!
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: To get some frozen poultry.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Then what?
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: We came back to the house!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: You didn't stop anywhere else?!
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a
dialog: porno store.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: An adult bookstore. He was very
dialog: excited about seeing it. You think
text: home is under a dirty bookstore in the
dialog: Valley?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Come on.
text: She heads out.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Trendy address.
text: They exit.
scene_heading: EXT. ADULT BOOKSTORE - NIGHT
text: Troy and Eve approach and enter.
scene_heading: INT. ADULT BOOKSTORE - NIGHT
text: The Pakistani looks up briefly when Eve and Troy enter.
text: There are two male customers in the bg. Eve taps her foot
text: on the floor hoping to hear a hollow sound. But it is
text: solid. She and Troy move about the store tapping their
text: feet and finally jumping up and down. The Pakistani and
text: two customers become concerned.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (to Pakistani)
dialog: Have you got a basement?
speaker_heading: PAKISTANI
dialog: (indicating merchandise)
dialog: Believe me, all the really good stuff
dialog: is right here.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Is there a back entrance?
speaker_heading: PAKISTANI
dialog: Are you kidding? Of course.
text: He points to the rear of the store.
scene_heading: EXT. REAR MALT SHOP PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: The Soda Jerk drives the rental truck away leaving the
text: lot empty and the door to the Malt Shop closed. Troy and
text: Eve appear after the truck is gone.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Why would you put a fallout shelter
dialog: under a porno shop?
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: None of this stuff was here in 1962.
dialog: The Valley was mostly small homes and
dialog: fruit orchards.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Well, we've come a long way, haven't
dialog: we? I want to go home.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Yeah. Maybe he'll call.
text: They turn left to get back to the avenue.
scene_heading: INT. EVE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The phone is ringing. Then the recorder answers.
speaker_heading: TROY
text: Hi. Troy and Eve are out so leave a
dialog: message. And if you want to leave a
dialog: number don't say it fast! I hate that!
dialog: Say it slow. Thank you.
dialog: Beep,
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Uh, Eve...this is Adam. Look, I just
dialog: wanted to thank you for everything you
dialog: did for me...and I wanted to tell you
dialog: that I...uh...that I wish so many good
dialog: things for you. I wish so hard that
dialog: all of your dreams come true. Um...I,
dialog: uh...
scene_heading: EXT. AVENUE - NIGHT
text: Eve lets Troy drive. She clutches the cigar box and
text: rests her head on the seat as they pull away from the
text: curb in front of the bookstore. A low rider passes them
text: on the left. Eve sees an old hag being shoved out of the
text: bar and a homeless man slipping into the abandoned malt
text: shop and the cross-dressing STREET WALKER making eyes at
text: passing cars and Adam hanging up the pay phone he just
dialog: used.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Adam!!
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Where?!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Stop!
text: She rolls down her window.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Adam!!
speaker_heading: ANGLE - ADAM
text: Turning when he hears Eve yell his name.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - EVE
text: Running from the car. The cigar box falls to the street
text: and the contents scatter. Eve could care less. Besides,
text: Troy is there to retrieve everything.
text: In a series of cuts and slo-mo action the couple race
dialog: into each other's arms...to the pleasure of all the
dialog: lowlifes mentioned above. Now the street looks more like
text: Capra than Scorsese. She's surprised that she wants to
text: kiss him so bad. He's surprised that he gets so
dialog: aggressive.
scene_heading: INT. SHELTER, KITCHEN - LATER, SAME NIGHT
text: Helen watches Calvin work on the timing device for the
text: locks with a screwdriver.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: How long will you set it for this
dialog: time?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I thought ten years.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Well, that's...considerably shorter
dialog: than before. I was wondering, Calvin,
dialog: why set the locks at all. I mean the
dialog: radiation is gone and...
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: To keep what's up there from getting
dialog: down here! It's not the radiation I'm
dialog: worried about.
speaker_heading: ADAM (OC)
dialog: Mom? Dad?
text: They turn to see Adam walking forward with Eve.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I'd like for you to meet Miss Eve
dialog: Rustokov.
dialog: Calvin knows a Russian name when he hears one. But he
dialog: chooses not to pursue it.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (stepping forward, offering
dialog: her hand)
dialog: How do you do, Mrs. Webber? Mr.
dialog: Webber?
speaker_heading: WEBBERS
dialog: (rather dumb-struck)
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Uh-huh. I've heard so many wonderful
dialog: things about you.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Well, please excuse us! We...we
dialog: haven't entertained a guest in...um...
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Some time.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What can I offer you, Eve?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Mom? Eve and I have to go.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I can't explain it now. But I want
dialog: you to set the locks for two months.
dialog: You have more than enough of
dialog: everything. Then we'll be back to get
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: But, I don't understand.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: And, I'm asking you to trust me
dialog: without understanding why.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Well, in that case...of course, son.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: They are wonderful parents.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: We have to go.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Yes, please! You must.
speaker_heading: ADAM/EVE
dialog: Well...sure...okay.
scene_heading: INT. BAR - AN HOUR LATER
text: Calvin mixes drinks just like he did at the party in
text: 1962. Adam is with him.
scene_heading: INT. - KITCHEN
text: Helen races around, just like she did in 1962, getting
text: the roast ready. Eve. watches.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Adam said I shouldn't mention the
dialog: Communists.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Oh, yes! Please, don't mention the
dialog: Communists!
scene_heading: INT. - DINING ROOM
text: Helen hurries out of the kitchen to take her seat. The
text: others are already there.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Eve. I hope I'm not being nosey, but
dialog: are you and Adam...um...dating?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Yes, Mrs. Webber we are.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I'm also from Pasadena.
text: Helen nearly comes unglued. Calvin is pleased, too. He
text: raises his tea cup.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: A toast! To Adam and Eve!
text: The others also raise their cups and everyone clicks.
text: Then they drink.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (gagging)
dialog: What is this sh...stuff?!
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Hot Dr. Pepper! Most people don't know
dialog: how good it is heated up.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: You know, they don't, do they?
text: They begin to eat.
speaker_heading: EVE (cont'd)
dialog: What about grace?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Oh, my goodness! We almost forgot!
dialog: (then)
dialog: I like your friend, Adam.
text: They all join hands and lower their heads. Calvin leads
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: EVE (VO)
dialog: And you thought your parents were
dialog: weird.
scene_heading: EXT. BEAUTIFUL VALLEY NORTH OF LA - MORNING
text: Adam and Eve are with a REAL ESTATE BROKER. The broker
text: unlocks the gate of a chain-link fence and Adam and Eve
text: step onto the property. The broker's Lexus is in the b.g.
speaker_heading: BROKER
dialog: It's like the Garden of Eden, don't
dialog: you think?
text: Adam and Eve respond but we can't hear them under Eve's
dialog: narration.
speaker_heading: EVE (VO)
dialog: You see, that night, Adam had a choice
dialog: between me and his parents.
speaker_heading: SCENE 173 OMITTED
scene_heading: EXT. VALLEY PROPERTY - DAY
text: Adam and Eve are working with a TEAM OF ARCHITECTS AND
text: CONTRACTORS at the site of a new home. They have plans
dialog: and are discussing dimensions.
speaker_heading: EVE (VO)
dialog: It's truly amazing what you can get
dialog: done when you have unlimited funds.
dialog: Did you know you can have whole houses
dialog: built in just a matter of months. All
dialog: you have to say is this..."I don't
dialog: care what it costs." And then, of
dialog: course, you've got
dialog: to really mean it, which no one ever
dialog: does.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW HOUSE - DAY
text: It is under construction.
scene_heading: EXT. MELROSE RETRO FURNITURE STORE - DAY
text: Adam, Eve and Troy enter.
scene_heading: INT. RETRO STORE
dialog: This is great stuff from the fifties and the sixties.
text: Adam finds things very similar to what he grew up with.
dialog: There's a
dialog: lamp (or something) that's just like the lamp (or
text: something) from the Webber living room.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: That lamp is perfect!
speaker_heading: STORE OWNER
dialog: (very faggy)

speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Eve, I've got to go back! My parents
dialog: can't handle this up here. And there
dialog: was no bomb, was there?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: See! I can't tell them that! I can't
dialog: ever let them know. It makes their
dialog: life..well, frankly...
dialog: a joke. I can't let that happen. You
dialog: understand?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: We can make this work, Adam! Believe
dialog: me! I'm very good at making things
dialog: work!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: My mother's like that.
text: They kiss again.
scene_heading: INT. MALT SHOP - DAY
text: Eve and Troy are showing large color drawings to the Soda

text: with a big lighted sign that says "GIVE ME SHELTER."
text: There's valet parking and the Adult Bookstore and Bar
dialog: have been turned into a Souvenir Center (think Planet
text: Hollywood). Another drawing shows fashionable guests
text: boarding the elevator.
speaker_heading: EVE (VO)
dialog: It took a while to convince Archbishop
dialog: Milker that Adam wasn't God, and he
dialog: was pretty broken up about it, too,
dialog: until I showed him my plans for Los
dialog: Angeles' hottest and most original
dialog: night spot.
text: Other drawings show dancing on the shelter patio and
text: guided tours being shown various parts of the shelter.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: You'll be a ten percent partner and

text: ROAD and NO TRESPASSING. Troy drives the van. Eve drives
text: the Cadillac. Adam is her passenger.
speaker_heading: EVE (VO)
dialog: Our idea was to bring Adam's parents
text: up to the surface very slowly. Make
dialog: them very comfortable and then break
dialog: the bad news to them that there was no
dialog: nuclear holocaust. And if that doesn't
dialog: kill them Adam's going to tell his
dialog: father about the Internet.
scene_heading: EXT. EXACT REPLICA OF THE WEBBER HOUSE - DAY
text: The cars pull up and Adam lets his parents out. They go

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

scene_heading: INT. FAMILY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Adam demonstrates the VCR to his parents as Troy and Eve

speaker_heading: HELEN

speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ADAM

speaker_heading: EVE

text: They hug.
speaker_heading: HELEN (cont'd)

speaker_heading: CALVIN

text: Calvin points out the computer.
speaker_heading: CALVIN (cont'd)
dialog: What's that thing?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: It's kind of a combination television-

dialog: (leading Calvin out)
dialog: I'll show it to you later.
scene_heading: EXT. PATIO - AN HOUR LATER
text: Adam and Calvin exit the house. They wear baseball gloves

speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: This is great son, just great. By the
dialog: way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov,
dialog: that's not Russian, is it?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents
dialog: immigrated here.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Dad, I don't know how to tell you
dialog: this. And I was going to wait a while,
dialog: but I think...Dad,there was no bomb.
dialog: A plane crashed into our backyard. I
dialog: looked it up in old newspapers.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: (after a while)
dialog: You're sure?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed
text: without a shot being fired. The Cold
text: War is over.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: That's what everybody believes?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Yes, sir. It's true.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: What? Did the politburo just one day
dialog: say - "We give up?"
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Yes. That's kind of how it was.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Uh-huh.
text: Adam throws the ball, but Calvin makes no attempt to
dialog: catch it.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: My gosh, those Commies are brilliant!
dialog: You've got to hand it to 'em! "No, we
dialog: didn't drop any bombs! Oh yes, our
dialog: evil empire has collapsed! Poor, poor
