speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: UNDERWATER - DAY
text: Dramatically lit by sunlight filtering down from the surface.
text: A dim shape, massive, threatening, swims towards us from the
dialog: distance. Then it divides -- what was one is two, and the
text: shape becomes reality; two divers in Scuba gear swimming
text: side by side. They are wearing minimal rubber, considering
text: the cool New England waters: "Farmer John" wetsuits with cut-
text: off legs, assorted sport-diving paraphernalia, including an
text: expensive camera with a flash attachment.
text: One motions "Down there," the other signals "OK, I see it,"
text: and they dive deeper, into darker waters, where the shafts
text: of sunlight pour into the depths, broken up by seaweed and
text: floating vegetation into cathedral-like columns of
dialog: illumination.
scene_heading: SEA BOTTOM - DAY
text: The wreck of the working fisherman's boat "ORCA," formerly
text: under the command of the late Captain Quint, deceased these
dialog: four years.
text: Buried in the sand near it, still connected by rusting strands
text: of cable, the mangled remains of a shark cage, glimmering
text: with stainless steel highlights. A fitful flash of yellow
text: from under a mossy beard -- a battered barrel, similarly
dialog: tangled.
text: The divers, Bert and Ernie, appear. They're fascinated by
text: the find, and Bert, with the camera, snaps a few flash shots.
text: The rapid sequence of flashes signals the presence of a motor
text: drive camera.
scene_heading: ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW
text: Distant flashes, obscured by vegetation in the foreground.
scene_heading: SEA BOTTOM, THE ORCA
text: Ernie is exploring the abandoned cabin; doors open and shut,
text: moved by invisible currents stirred by his passage.
text: An occasional "Flash!" lights up the bottom as Bert continues
text: snapping away souvenir shots of this local landmark.
scene_heading: BERT'S POINT OF VIEW - CAMERA VIEWFINDER (PROCESS)
text: Ernie floats up out of a hatch, sees the camera, and strikes
text: a pose, clowning for the photographer's benefit. A big hand,
text: f.g., motions him up into clear water for a formal portrait.
text: He obliges. Now he floats in front of us, gently paddling
text: his flippers to maintain vertical stability. One flash.
text: Another. Then a large, dim movement in the b.g.
text: Something's out there, moving towards us.
text: Flash. It's bigger, bearing down like a train in a tunnel.
text: Flash! It's on us. Flash! Teeth? Blood? Flash! Blackness,
dialog: Death.
scene_heading: OCEAN BOTTOM, INSERT
text: The camera floats gently down and settles in the sand. A
text: dark red mist eddies by. A last weak flash.
scene_heading: MATCH DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - SUNDOWN
text: Flash! An expensive cabin cruiser, the "Diver Working" flag
text: fluttering limply in the breeze, is riding alone at anchor.
text: Flash! A distant lighthouse beacon winks at us. The boat
text: rocks in the ceaseless swell.
text: On the stern, "Elizabeth T. - Newport, R.I." A long way from
dialog: home...
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY
text: A blue-and-white police jeep is bouncing over the sand. A
text: figure in civilian clothes driving alone on some urgent
text: mission. It's Martin Brody, Chief of Police on Amity.
text: The jeep slows to a stop, and he takes a flight of stairs
text: leading to a concrete patio two at a time. A classical trumpet
text: solo is playing in the background. Brody charges through a
text: door, then abruptly slows and starts moving warily through a
text: hotel interior: The Holidome, a three-story extravaganza of
text: a motel, where some sort of formal ceremony is already in
text: progress. A banner announces: "Grand Opening Ball -- Amity
dialog: Scholarship Fund Benefit." Brody crosses under a High School
text: band, arranged dance-band style on a balcony; the trumpet
text: player, Polo, is finishing his solo, the assembled crowd
text: applauds politely. Brody is taking his place with some
text: dignitaries on the dais, as the presiding authority, Amity
text: Mayor Larry Vaughn, begins speaking.
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: Thank you, Paul Lohman, for that
dialog: eloquent solo. Now, for that point
dialog: in the ceremonies where we formally
dialog: dedicate this magnificent resort-
dialog: hotel complex, a worthwhile addition
dialog: to the recreational paradise we call
dialog: Amity.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON THE DAIS
text: Seated on folding chairs, wearing their good suits, several
dialog: of Amity's Selectmen, Real Estate Developer Len Peterson,
text: and Ellen Brody, very chic. Brody slips into the vacant chair
text: next to her. The following is conducted in urgent whispers,
text: sotto voce, while Vaughn drones on.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Where the hell were you?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Late.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I can see that. Don't you know this
dialog: is a big deal?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Couldn't help it.
dialog: Hendricks over there...
dialog: (he indicates his
dialog: deputy)
dialog: ...still has the keys
text: to the jeep in his
dialog: pocket, and I couldn't
text: find the spares.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Terrific. Act as if
dialog: you've been here all
dialog: along.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: How'm I supposed to do
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Look bored.
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: (droning along)
dialog: Holiday Inn joins the Amity
dialog: Shores development
dialog: condominium complex in a
dialog: welcome expression renewed
dialog: interest in Amity Island
dialog: as the hub of the Northeast
dialog: Recreational Vacation
dialog: Wonderland. We're happy
dialog: once again to be in the
dialog: center of things, where
dialog: the action is... We've had
dialog: our share of hard times
dialog: and long winters and the
dialog: past few years have not
dialog: been easy. But today, the
text: sun is rising on a new
text: Amity, a new island filled
dialog: with promise.
dialog: (applause)
dialog: Len Peterson's Amity Shores
dialog: Development is an exciting
dialog: addition to our island.
dialog: The Holiday Inn we stand
dialog: in is likewise a new friend
dialog: who we welcome as family.
dialog: Amity means 'friendship'
dialog: and our community extends
dialog: its friendship to all who
dialog: seek her shores in peace
dialog: and harmony.
dialog: (applause)
text: Brody settles into polite attentiveness, acknowledging a
text: wave from Hendricks, a politely bland young town cop in his
text: idea of civilian finery. Hendricks is fussing with the banner
text: on an attractive young lady in a bathing suit...
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON VAUGHN
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: ...And now, Tina Wilcox, this year's
dialog: Miss Amity, will cut the ribbon that
dialog: officially opens this luxurious new
dialog: hotel...
text: Tina (the girl in the bathing suit) escapes Hendricks'
text: attentions, and teeters on high heels towards the ribbon,
text: while Phil Fogarty, the local photographer, snaps away.
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: Tina was selected from more than 20
dialog: of this island's lovely young
dialog: ladies in the Miss Amity competition
dialog: held every spring, and she'll
dialog: represent Amity Island in the Miss
dialog: Massachusetts Competition in Worcester
dialog: next month. When she cuts this ribbon,
dialog: she will be opening our island to
dialog: growth, to development, to planned
dialog: expansion with full employment for
dialog: our thriving community.
text: ANGLE ON THE BAND
text: Paul Lohman ("Polo" to his friends) is exchanging whispers
text: with Lucy, a flute player nearby.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I don't think she's such hot stuff.
speaker_heading: POLO
dialog: When are we going out? You and me?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Not tonight.
speaker_heading: POLO
dialog: You going with Patrick?
text: Lucy nods, Polo shrugs, and turns to Jane, a girl nearby.
speaker_heading: POLO
dialog: Listen, Jane -- you want to dance as
dialog: soon as we get out of these monkey
dialog: suits?
text: She nods happily, they whisper together, while we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON DAIS
text: Martin and Ellen have been joined by their youngest son,
dialog: Sean.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Mom, Michael won't talk to me.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: (to Ellen)
dialog: Shouldn't he be at home?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Mrs. Silvera couldn't come.
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: This money tree, you may have noticed,
dialog: is made entirely of twenty-dollar
dialog: bills, donated by Len Peterson, the
dialog: builder of Amity Shores Condominiums,
dialog: as a gesture of goodwill towards the
dialog: community. $500 as a special gift to
dialog: the Amity township scholarship fund...
text: Applause from the crowd, Len takes a bow.
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: (prompting)
dialog: Go ahead, Tina.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON TINA
text: as she reaches out with the scissors. Something catches her
text: eye, and she winks at her boyfriend, Ed Marchand, smirking
text: in the crowd. He winks back, and makes "Cut it" motions with
text: his fingers.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON THE CEREMONY
text: Tina cuts the ribbon, and Tom Andrews, a local diver, pushes
text: a decorated float out into the pool; sparklers sputter,
text: balloons drop from the ceiling.
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: Thanks to Tom Andrews, of Amity Aqua-
dialog: Sports, for contributing the special
dialog: decorations. And now, the Amity High
dialog: School band. Refreshments on the
dialog: patio, everyone...
text: The band swings into "Downtown," and the crowd gets up to
text: dance, to eat, and to break into small groups to talk.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOLIDOME - LATER
text: Ellen is dragging Brody over to where Len Peterson and Larry
text: Vaughn, the mayor, are in conversation. They pass vignettes:
text: Tina and Ed, Tom Andrews and Jane, Marge, other interesting
text: Amity townspeople.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: (seeing Peterson and
dialog: Vaughn)
dialog: Do I have to talk to those two?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: My boss and your boss. Sure.
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: Hello, hello. It went well, I thought.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Very impressive ceremony. Good speech.
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: Thank you, thank you. You know my
dialog: son, don't you?
text: He beckons over their heads to Larry Vaughn, Jr., a young
text: man uncomfortable in his correct tie and blazer. They exchange
text: perfunctory greetings.
speaker_heading: PETERSON
dialog: The speech was right on the money.
dialog: (to Ellen)
dialog: Be a love and make sure the bar's
dialog: open, will you?
text: He puts his arm around her, a little too familiarly for
dialog: Brody's liking.
speaker_heading: PETERSON
dialog: (to Brody)
dialog: Fantastic lady. Don't know what I'd
dialog: do without her.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Me neither.
speaker_heading: PETERSON
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: Y'know, Brody -- for the first time
dialog: in years it's worth putting money
dialog: into this town.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: All of us thank you, okay?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Watch Sean for a minute?
text: And she hands Sean off to Brody, leaving him with an over-
text: active 10 year old, while she's gone.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Can I go swimming?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: No. Find your brother, okay?
text: Sean nods and runs off, happy to have a mission.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: ANGLE ON MICHAEL BRODY - NEAR THE BAND
text: He is talking to Brooke Peters, a mop-maned teen-ager with a
text: pleasant face.
text: Timmy Weldon, a grade behind, lurks nearby. A plumpish, curly-
text: haired buddy, Andy Nicholas, is enjoying a cup of punch.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: How old is your cousin?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
text: Seventeen. She's a senior.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I'm not crazy about blind dates.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: They're okay, if they got little
text: white canes and tin cups.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: That's awful.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: What the hell.
dialog: (to Mike)
dialog: Did your mom put all this together?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah, it's her job.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Is she responsible for the punch?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Good. It's terrible.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: My cousin will be here tomorrow.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Great.
text: Sean finds them, and bursts into their group.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Michael, Michael, Dad said to find
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Okay, you did that.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Come on, Mikey, come on...
text: He tugs at Mike's sleeve; Mike allows himself to be dragged
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Okay, okay. Got to go.
text: Andy and Brooke are left standing together, Tim moves in.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: (to Brooke)
dialog: Want to dance?
text: (she shakes her head
dialog: "no")
dialog: Okay. Later?
text: On her shrug, as she turns to Andy:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT./EXT. HOLIDOME PATIO/TERRACE - NIGHT
text: It's later; night has fallen, the band is playing its version
text: of "When I Fall in Love." Many teen-agers are dancing out on
text: the patio, some adults are dancing inside, the buffet is
text: ravaged, Timmy is watching Brooke, who's dancing with Polo.
text: Douglas Fetterman ("Doug") joins him, after asking Marge for
text: a dance and striking out.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Get a dance yet?
speaker_heading: TIMMY
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Me neither.
speaker_heading: TIMMY
dialog: Who'd you ask?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Tina Wilcox.
speaker_heading: TIMMY
dialog: You're crazy. She's Ed's girl friend.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Doesn't hurt to ask. Sometimes the
dialog: most beautiful girls are the
dialog: loneliest.
speaker_heading: TIMMY
dialog: That's a crock of shit.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I know.
text: Bob Burnside, a tall pal of Larry Vaughn Jr.'s, turns up by
dialog: their side.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Same tired old faces. You see Vaughn?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: The mayor?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Larry Vaughn Junior?
dialog: (Doug shrugs)
dialog: If you see him, tell him I got a six-
text: pack, a blanket, and the Brebner
dialog: twins.
text: He exits, on the prowl.
speaker_heading: TIMMY
dialog: No class.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: None at all.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I wonder what the Brebner twins are
dialog: doing tomorrow night.
text: ANGLE ON BRODY AND ELLEN
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Can you take a little time out from
dialog: your busy schedule to dance with the
dialog: old man?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Because they're playing our song.
text: And sure enough, they are -- the band has turned to a Fifties
text: slow-dance standard: "I Wish You Love." Peterson approaches.
speaker_heading: PETERSON
dialog: May I have this dance?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Sorry, I'm all booked up...
dialog: (taking Ellen)
dialog: Come, m'dear.
text: They slowly fox trot out onto the terrace. Both of them
text: nodding greetings to townspeople and kids -- everyone knows
dialog: the chief.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: And how. I thought you wouldn't
dialog: respect me.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: I did, I did.
text: The music and the summer moon are working their magic.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Listen -- what are you doing later?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Fooling around?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Right.
text: He dips with her; they look up and notice Sean, sound asleep
text: on a bench.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Let's get the kid home.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Home it is.
text: He crosses to the sleepy Sean and hoists him with a grunt.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: (to the kid)
dialog: You're getting a little big for this.
text: Sean murmurs sleepily and hugs his dad. Mike, dancing with
text: Marge, waves good-bye. The Brodys start to leave, passing a
text: bucket with a bottle of champagne still in it. They exchange
text: a look, nod agreement, and Brody boosts the bottle, sneaking
text: it out of the building while Ellen giggles.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. BRODY BEDROOM - DAY
text: Brody and Ellen are snuggling under the covers while early
text: morning light streams under the blinds. It's The Morning
text: After, and the clothes from the night before are scattered
text: all over the room. Brody rolls against Ellen, spoon-fashion,
text: morning-horny.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Mmmm.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: MMMmmmorning...
text: They start to move a little, then turn face to face. Outside
text: their door, the sounds of little feet; Sean padding
dialog: downstairs.
speaker_heading: BRODY
text: Sean's awake.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
text: Door's locked.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: (kissing)
dialog: Good.
text: Their bodies move under the blankets. There's a crash from
text: the kitchen. They stop for a beat. As they resume, little
text: feet return.
speaker_heading: SEAN'S VOICE
text: The milk fell out of the 'frigerator.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Put a towel down. And shh -- daddy's
dialog: sleeping.
speaker_heading: SEAN'S VOICE
dialog: Okay.
text: His feet paddle off. Brody and Ellen start to slide together,
text: passion resumes.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: C'mere...
text: Bigger feet go downstairs; Michael's up. The Brodys kiss,
text: trying to ignore the sounds of spirited discussion between
dialog: brothers over who's responsible for spilled milk. Then the
text: sound of a car pulling into the driveway, and a horn beep.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Mrs. Silvera?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Mrs. Silvera.
text: They try to kiss again, there's a door slam downstairs, and
text: talk between the boys and Mrs. Silvera. The Brodys look at
text: each other and break up laughing at the morning, and
dialog: themselves.
text: ANGLE ON THE BED
text: As Ellen and Brody, with the practice of 18 years of marriage,
text: swing back-to-back, and put their feet on the floor, each on
text: their side of the bed, still chuckling, up for the day.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Need a ride?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: As far as the office.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. AMITY STREET DAY
text: The police jeep is driving through the picturesque streets,
text: Brody behind the wheel, Ellen and Sean passengers. It slows
text: near the foot of the street, dockside, where a real estate
dialog: office marked "Amity Shores Development, Leonard Peterson,
text: Pres." sits. Peterson's big Cadillac is parked illegally at
text: the curb. It has the Amity Shores logo on its side.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Some people.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: What's daddy doing?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
text: Writing a ticket.
text: Brody is out of the car, his pad in his hand.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Hey! That's my boss!
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Better yet.
text: Peterson, in shirt-sleeves and a tie, hustles out of the
dialog: office
speaker_heading: PETERSON
dialog: Wait a minute...
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Too late, it's written.
speaker_heading: PETERSON
dialog: Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer.
dialog: (to Ellen)
dialog: Don't you have any pull with the
dialog: chief, here?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Do I have to?
speaker_heading: PETERSON
dialog: (taking the ticket)
dialog: Better get a sales kit together for
dialog: after lunch. I'm taking some prospects
dialog: out.
text: Ellen kisses Brody, and starts in for her day's work.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: See you later.
speaker_heading: PETERSON
dialog: (to Brody)
dialog: Can't we fix it up to get this made
dialog: into a green zone or something?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Len, pay the two dollars.
text: Peterson shrugs and goes inside his office. Brody's attention
text: is drawn by some noise by the dock.
scene_heading: EXT. DOCKSIDE, AMITY - DAY
text: Hendricks and an old codger, Red, are working on Amity's
text: newest bit of police equipment; a blue power launch for
text: patrolling local waters. The boat is Hendricks' personal
text: pride and joy.
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: (to Red)
dialog: Tie it off on your left. Your other
dialog: left!
text: As Red complies, Hendricks spots his boss.
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: Good morning!
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: (walking onto the
dialog: dock, Sean tagging
dialog: along)
dialog: Aren't you off-duty?
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: Till noon. This is on my own time.
dialog: (to Sean)
dialog: Hi, Shorty.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I'm not short. I'm eleven.
text: There's a hoot from a passing boat horn. Sean waves happily.
text: ANGLE ON THE BOAT
text: It has slowed to a halt in front of the police berth; it's a
text: scruffy working fisherman, back from the banks with a full
text: load. The Skipper hails Brody.
speaker_heading: SKIPPER
dialog: Yo! Chief!
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SKIPPER
dialog: You got a gold-plater drifting in
text: the main channel. Big cruiser.
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: Whereabouts?
speaker_heading: SKIPPER
text: Off the Point. No running lights,
text: just a diver's flag.
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: (aside to Brody)
dialog: Want me to run out there?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: On your own time?
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: Happy to do it.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Then check it out. I'll be in the
dialog: office.
text: Hendricks nods, and starts the engine importantly.
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: Cast off your bow line. And your
dialog: stern line. Spring line...
text: While Red grumbles, Brody and Sean are walking up to the
dialog: street.
text: Michael and some teen-agers are headed down to the dock.
text: ANGLE ON BRODY AND THE KIDS
text: It's Mike, Polo, Patrick, Lucy, Brooke, Ed and Tina.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Where to?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: No place special. Just hanging out.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Sailing?
text: Mike nods.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Watch your kid brother, huh?
text: He gets into his jeep, leaving Sean with the teen-agers.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Bye, Mr. Brody.
text: The others ad lib appropriate greetings/good-byes, as Brody
text: drives off in his jeep.
scene_heading: EXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY
text: The Kids busy themselves with their boats while Sean hovers
text: around Mike, who's not happy at baby-sitting his kid brother.
speaker_heading: POLO
dialog: Anyone want to sail to
dialog: the lighthouse?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Machs nix to me.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Anyone got a spare
dialog: mooring line? Mine's
dialog: shot.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: I've got one...
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Can I go too?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I said, 'No.'
text: Tina's in her boat, "Tina's Joy," a neat sloop. Mike is going
text: over his "Green Machine," a sleek catamaran.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: You're not going out right away, are
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: MIKE
text: Waiting for Andy.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I want you to meet my cousin.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I will, I will.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I want to go out with you. You need
dialog: a crew, don't you?
text: Before Sean can protest further, Mike spots his crew: Andy
text: Nicholas, a round-faced, frizzy-haired pal, wearing a bathing
text: suit, and carrying some scuba gear from an early-morning
text: diving class. Marge and Denise, two other divers, are with
text: him, with their gear. They ad-lib "good-byes."
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I don't need you. Andy's here.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You always go with Andy.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (to Andy)
dialog: How was dive class?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-
dialog: bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is
dialog: some weird shit on the bottom of the
dialog: ocean.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Shells and lobsters and stuff?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Mostly old garbage. Today we found a
dialog: '48 Hudson.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Do I have to play with the little
dialog: kids?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah. Go on, beat it.
text: Sean mopes away while Andy and Mike get their boat ready for
dialog: sea.
text: FOLLOW SEAN OFF THE DOCK
text: Up on the street, where a pretty girl with a sexy face and a
text: provocative post-pubescent walk is asking him directions.
text: He points down at the dock. The Girl, Jackie Peters, waves
text: at her cousin, Brooke.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Brooke! Hey!
text: One of the boats has a portable radio going. It's playing
text: some medium-hot salsa. Jackie does a couple of dance steps
text: on her way down the dock.
text: CLOSE ON ANDY AND MIKE
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Who's that? Quick -- I'm in love.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I hope that's the cousin.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Over here. I want you to meet
dialog: somebody.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Lucky. Lucky, lucky, lucky.
text: As the four teen-agers come together in a tight quartet, the
dialog: music rocks up and we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HARBOR - DAY
text: Later in the day, sailboats with bright colored sails and
text: ornately painted hulls tack back and forth. Lots of chatter
text: between boats, horseplay, splashing, and general good times.
text: It's cruising, on water.
scene_heading: EXT. HARBOR, ABOARD MIKE'S BOAT - DAY
text: with Mike, Andy, Jackie and Brooke.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: How fast does this go?
speaker_heading: ANDY
text: With the right wind, 15-20 knots.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Real fast.
text: He sheets in, heeling the boat over in the stiff breeze.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Far out!
text: Jackie screams in excitement; for a city girl, this is more
dialog: fun than a roller coaster.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON A RED CATAMARAN, "SIZZLER"
text: overtaking Mike's boat. It's piloted by Larry Vaughn, Jr.,
text: the Mayor's Son; with him is his good friend, Bob Burnside.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Coming up!
speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: HENDRICKS

speaker_heading: BRODY

speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Chief Brody? I want you to do

text: Brody is caught in the open.
scene_heading: WHITE-HAIRED MAN
dialog: Martin, you have got to demand that

speaker_heading: 2ND MAN
dialog: What about enforcing the "No Parking"

speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: In a minute, in a minute -- talk to

speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Albert keeps coming

speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: Chief...
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Hendricks. I want to go over your
dialog: reports and your Form 908.
text: They go into Brody's inner office; the uproar continues behind
text: the door, but it's calm in here.
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: I never heard of a 908.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: I just made it up. It means, "Get me
dialog: out of there."
dialog: (notices the camera)
dialog: What the hell's that?
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
text: Diver's camera. Tom Andrews brought
dialog: it up from under that abandoned

speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Abandoned? It's a little early in
dialog: the season for that.
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: Rich people. Home port is Newport,

speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as

speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: If you had a $100,000 boat there'd

text: As Brody turns to deal with the mess, we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER

text: drops into view. Then another one. Pale legs churn the water.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - DAY
text: Off Amity Beach, a bilious green lap-straked boat is bobbing
text: in the water, the engine idling. Two girls are fooling around;
text: the one in the water is Terry, the one driving the boat is
dialog: Diane.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Did you ever see a dolphin?
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: Sure. They like to play. We may see
dialog: some today.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Great!
text: She fumbles with her skis.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Whoops, almost lost one. Can't play
dialog: with the dolphins without skis...
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: Ready?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Hang on, hang on... Okay, go.
text: Diane goes to the controls, and puts the engine into gear,
text: starting forward. Terry waves "okay," Diane opens up the
text: throttle, the boat surges forward, pulling Terry upright.
text: A wake boils out from under her skis.
text: ANGLE ON THE BEACH
text: Ed and Tina are camped on a blanket, necking in the shelter
text: of the dunes. There's a portable radio, a cooler with some
text: beer, and some sandwiches -- a perfect afternoon alone. Above
text: the dune, behind them lies the ocean, where the girls' ski
text: boat can be seen, raising a big wake. Tina disengages, and
text: sits up, brushing sand out of her hair.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Take a break for a minute, okay?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Huh?
text: Tina stands, and looks out to the sea, where the boat is
text: towing Terry on the water.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Eddie, can we do that?
dialog: (no reaction)
dialog: Can we go skiing? We can use my
dialog: Uncle's boat. Eddie?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Next week.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: With you, everything's next week. I
dialog: want to go skiing soon. Tomorrow?
text: Ed grunts non-comittally. Tina takes a beer from the cooler,
text: and goes up on the dune to watch Terry and Diane. She waves
text: to them, and to someone down the beach.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH HOUSE - DAY
text: An old lady, Grace Witherspoon, is rocking on her porch,
text: also enjoying the view of young people enjoying themselves.
text: She acknowledges Tina's distant wave, and turns her attention
text: back to the skiers.
text: ANGLE ON THE SKIERS
text: having a wonderful time. Terry is good, criss-crossing the
text: wake, showing off.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON TERRY
text: rushing through the water, waving, stunting.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Faster! Faster!
text: She waves at Diane, who leans over the controls, to coax
text: more speed out of the old engine.
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER
text: following the skis effortlessly, closing in on the turbulent
dialog: wake.
text: ON THE SURFACE
text: Terry whipping along; a fin raises near her. She glances at
text: it, waves, thinking it's a porpoise.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Porpoise! Look! A dolphin!
text: The fin slides low in the water, heading towards her. She
text: puts the rope around her waist, leaving both hands free.
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER
text: Closing in on the wake, crossing it.
scene_heading: TERRY - ON THE SURFACE
text: The fin cuts across her path. Too late to maneuver, Terry
text: hits the looming gray back of the Shark. The skis bump, leave
text: the water, Terry takes a spectacular spill. The rope around
text: her waist tows her helpless through the water, gagging her,
text: preventing her from shouting. She flounders as Diane slows
dialog: the boat to see what's happened.
text: ANGLE ON THE BOAT
text: turning back to see if her friend hit a submerged log or
dialog: hurt herself.
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: Terry! You okay?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Help! Help!
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: Okay, okay, coming...
text: She still doesn't realize the gravity of the situation --
text: she hasn't seen the fin.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON TERRY
text: hysterical, pulling herself hand-over-hand up the rope, trying
dialog: to get to the boat.
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER
text: Closing in on the thrashing figure.
speaker_heading: TERRY
text: Screaming, as the Shark rises from the deep and takes her.
text: Suddenly she's gone, a swirl of pink froth marking the water
dialog: where she went under.
scene_heading: IN THE BOAT - DIANE
text: Looking around for her friend, suddenly panicky. She pulls
text: the rope hard, and tumbles backward as it comes up with
text: nothing on it -- just a cleanly bitten end.
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Terry!
text: Then the Shark appears, blood on its mouth, lunging up and
text: butting the stern, jarring the engine loose. Fuel spills
text: from a ruptured line.
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: Help! God, help!
text: She throws things at the Shark, which slides back under the
dialog: water.
scene_heading: DISTANT ANGLE ON THE BOAT - FROM THE BEACH
text: Diane can be seen flailing in the boat, very distant screams
text: floating across the water; at this range they sound like the
text: normal shrieks of teen-age girls having fun....
scene_heading: ANGLE ON THE BOAT - CLOSE
text: as the Shark hits from a fresh angle, this time taking a
text: chunk out of the boat, biting down with powerful jaws. Diane
text: hurls seat-cushions, oars, anything she can lay hands on.
text: She fumbles desperately in a compartment, produces a flare
text: pistol. She cocks it and fires point-blank at the shark.
text: CLOSE ON THE SHARK
text: The flare hits, wet fuel glistening on the water and skin of
text: the Shark explodes in a sheet of flame.
speaker_heading: DIANE
text: A last flash before the gasoline explodes.
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: No-o-o-o-o-o...!
text: A sheet of fire, she's in the middle, screaming, aflame, the
text: Shark forgotten. She falls into the water as the ruined boat
text: overturns and there's an oily explosion.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - DAY - ED AND TINA
text: Ed and Tina look up as they hear the distant "crump" of the
text: boat blowing up.
scene_heading: EXT. PORCH - DAY

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - DAY - AMITY POLICE BOAT
text: The launch is anchored at the site of the explosion, offshore.
text: Red is fishing up bits of flotsam with a boathook. Hendricks
text: is on the radio, talking to the shore.
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: I can't find anyone out here. They
dialog: must've gone to the bottom, or drifted
dialog: with the current.
text: BRODY ON SHORE
text: He's on the porch of tile Witherspoon house, using his
text: portable walkie-talkie. Mrs. Witherspoon is waiting in the

dialog: having given statements.
speaker_heading: BRODY
text: There should be bodies. Witnesses

speaker_heading: HENDRICKS (O.S.)
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: I told you -- nothing here.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Try dragging.
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS (O.S.)

dialog: dark.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Stay on it. I don't care how long it
dialog: takes.
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS (O.S.)
dialog: 10-4.
text: Brody turns to Ed and Tina, and takes out his notebook.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: We heard this noise, like a 'boomp'
dialog: out there, and when we looked, there
dialog: was just this cloud of smoke.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: That was the explosion. One minute
dialog: they were having a wonderful time,
dialog: the next, bang!
speaker_heading: BRODY
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I don't know what could've done that.
text: Brody stares out at the quiet sea -- what's lurking under
dialog: that calm surface?
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Can we go now?
text: Brody's still looking past them, towards the ocean.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Chief Brody -- can we go? Please?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Oh, yeah. Sure.
text: As he gazes at the ocean, we hear the sound of a distant

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: ABROAD THE POLICE BOAT - NIGHT

dialog: back.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: How much longer?
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: Until we find something.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: I don't care about the overtime, I'm

scene_heading: INSERT - THE WINCH CABLE
text: It goes taut with a sudden strain.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON HENDRICKS

speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: I think we got something.
text: Red moves to the winch, watching warily as it slows to a
text: near stall with the weight.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: About damn time.
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: What the hell is it?
text: There's a strain on the cable -- it's pulling the stern of
text: the boat down as it struggles with the weight.
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: Here it comes...
scene_heading: ANGLE ON THE WATER
text: lit by the harsh worklights on the deck of the launch. The
text: cable from the winch is taut, pulling something up from the
text: black depths. What? The coupling appears, then the hook, and
text: an oily cable.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Oh shit. Drop it.
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Power line.
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: Oh, great.
text: He hits the release on the winch, and the cable whines as it
text: spins out and settles back on the bottom. Red jiggles the
text: line, trying to free it up.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: It comes here from Cable Junction.
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: Untangle it and let's go -- We don't

text: The crowd edges back, giving way to Brody and Elkins.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: See? What'd I tell you?
text: ANGLE ON THE WHALE
text: Brody is holding a handkerchief to his nose as he approaches
text: the dead thing, indicating a huge open wound on the side.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Look at that!
speaker_heading: ELKINS
dialog: First things first.
text: She produces a tape measure and gives one end to Brody.
speaker_heading: ELKINS
dialog: From the tip of the snout, please.
text: Elkins is measuring the length of the creature. She calls
text: off numbers to Hendricks, who is officiously writing it all
text: down, repeating numbers as he hears them.
speaker_heading: ELKINS
dialog: Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Come on, let's check the bite radius.
speaker_heading: ELKINS
dialog: (cold)
dialog: The what?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Bite radius. You know, the size of
dialog: the mouth?
speaker_heading: ELKINS
dialog: The whale's mouth?
speaker_heading: BRODY
text: The Shark's mouth.
speaker_heading: ELKINS
dialog: What shark?
text: Brody pitches his voice low, so that the crowd won't listen.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: The shark that did this. It was a
dialog: shark, wasn't it?
speaker_heading: ELKINS
dialog: We don't know that, do we?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: But that's what we're here to find
dialog: out, right?
speaker_heading: ELKINS
dialog: You don't tell me my job, and I won't
dialog: tell you about yours, okay?
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: I can't hear you if you're going to
dialog: whisper.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Can we go now?
text: He turns to join the kids as they slip through the crowd to
text: return to their blanket, ad-libbing good-byes.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: (to Mike)
dialog: You stay here a minute.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Oh, c'mon.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: You heard me.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: We'll be over by the lighthouse.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I'll be right there. Wait up.
text: They hang around, waiting for him. Elkins has reclaimed
text: Brody's attention.
speaker_heading: ELKINS
dialog: Could be a shark. But maybe not.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Look, I know a little bit about
dialog: sharks.
speaker_heading: ELKINS
dialog: Do you?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: I know that this was probably a Great
dialog: White Shark. Car-cadon... Caradan...
text: He fumbles for the correct Latin.
speaker_heading: ELKINS
dialog: (helping out)
dialog: Carcharadon Carcharias.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: That's it.
speaker_heading: ELKINS
dialog: Okay, so that's it.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Is there one in these waters?
speaker_heading: ELKINS
dialog: What makes you think there might be?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Because this big fish has been bitten
dialog: by some other big fish...
speaker_heading: ELKINS
dialog: This is a mammal, not a fish.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Jesus, don't quibble with me. I want
dialog: to know if a Great White Shark did
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: ELKINS
dialog: Probably.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: That's it? Probably? Look, sharks
text: are attracted by blood, and thrashing
dialog: around...
speaker_heading: ELKINS
dialog: And sound.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: (this is a new one)
dialog: Sound?
speaker_heading: ELKINS
dialog: Sound. Like sonar, or radar. They
text: home in on irregular sounds, unusual
dialog: sounds, any rhythmic low-frequency
dialog: vibration.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: So there's one around here.
speaker_heading: ELKINS
dialog: Not necessarily. These wounds could've
dialog: been inflicted 30 miles out to sea,
text: or more. None of them are immediately
dialog: fatal. Currents could've carried the
text: body 10 miles further.
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: (chiming in)
dialog: We got a helluva tide this month.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Could you just keep that crowd back,
dialog: please?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (fidgeting)
dialog: Pop...
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: You stay right here. You're going in
dialog: with me.
text: ANGLE ON BRODY AND MIKE
text: As Elkins examines the whale, calling her observations to
dialog: Hendricks.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: We came out in my boat.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Andy can sail in it.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I got a date!
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: She'll understand.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: She won't.
speaker_heading: ELKINS
text: Lower jaw displaced and
dialog: lacerated by predator
text: attempt to seize the tongue.
dialog: Additional large tissue
dialog: loss in the dorsal and sub-
dialog: dorsal areas, as well as
dialog: the caudal. Oriamal bite
dialog: radius 37 inches, allowing
dialog: for salt-water erosion and
dialog: subsequent small predator
dialog: and scavenger tissue
dialog: attacks...
text: The Kids have moved a little closer to hear what's going on
text: between father and son.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: I don't want to discuss it.
text: Elkins crosses to Brody.
speaker_heading: ELKINS
dialog: It's either a Great White, or another
dialog: killer whale.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Can't you tell?
speaker_heading: ELKINS
dialog: Not when it's like this. This animal
dialog: has been ashore for 10, 12 hours,
text: and drifting for a day, at least.
dialog: Every little nibbler in the sea's
text: taken a bite.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Look -- can Great White Sharks
dialog: communicate? Send out signals, or
dialog: something? You know, take revenge,
dialog: sense an enemy...
speaker_heading: ELKINS
dialog: Don't be ridiculous -- Sharks don't
dialog: take things personally.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Dad, please...
text: Brody turns on him. This at least, is something he can do
dialog: something about.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: No more sailing. You come back with
dialog: me, and that's it.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Why me?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Because I say so.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I'll tie up at the town dock, don't
dialog: worry, man.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: See you later, Mikey...
speaker_heading: ED AND TINA
dialog: Later, bye...

speaker_heading: BRODY

speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: We're alone.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Larry, I don't know how to say this,

dialog: A real one.
text: Vaughn stares at him, then unlocks the door to his private

scene_heading: INT. VAUGHN'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Small, expensively furnished in antiques, with a few symbols
text: of Amity boosterism cluttering one wall: a photo of the beach,
text: featuring a shark tower; an architect's rendering of the new
text: Holiday Inn, some charts and graphs showing upward progress,
text: a few stills of businessmen's luncheons, plaques, awards,
dialog: etc.
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: Are you serious?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Of course. Look -- I've got some
dialog: missing persons, fatalities, evidence
dialog: of a large predator...
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: No one has seen a shark -- no fin,
dialog: no bites, nothing. Be realistic.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: I got a feeling. I have to act on it --
dialog: you can understand that, can't you?
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: Of course I can, but can't it wait?
dialog: These things cost money, and this
dialog: town doesn't have much money.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: We have to do something.
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: We have done something -- hell, we
dialog: damn near went broke putting up a
dialog: shark watch tower on the beach --
dialog: it's the only one in 2000 miles,
dialog: y'know.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: I know, I know...
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: And I stood by while you told the
dialog: people from Ramada and Marriott that
dialog: if they put up a hotel they'd need
dialog: $800,000 worth of steel net around
dialog: their beaches! In New England? We
dialog: all lost on that one.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: It's still a good idea.
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: Martin, when we build up our tax
dialog: base a little, you can have everything
dialog: you want; right now, the town's broke.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Please, Larry -- there's good reason.
dialog: Those water skiers...
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: A tragedy. But that was a boating
dialog: accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing
text: but a boating accident.
speaker_heading: BRODY
text: Two of them are still missing!
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: There's always deaths in these waters
dialog: that never turn up. Are they all
dialog: shark victims?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Maybe they are!
text: Brody's overstated his case, and he realizes it.
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: Bullshit.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Bullshit? I'll give you bullshit --
dialog: there's a dead whale out there with
dialog: bites all over it!
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: (shouting back)
dialog: What am I, an ass? When you called
dialog: me, I called Elkins, and her bosses.
dialog: Nothing she saw is proof of anything.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Someone has to do something.
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: (back in control)
dialog: Don't push it this time. If you do,
dialog: it won't turn out the way you want,
dialog: I guarantee you that.
text: The two men study each other for a long moment. Then,
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: I've got to get back to work.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. AMITY BEACH ROAD - DAY (DUSK)
text: Brody is alone in the jeep, headed for the safety of home
text: and family. He drives past the town's billboard: it's covered
text: with an architect's rendering of the Amity Holiday Inn. The
text: sign reads: "WHEN IN AMITY, ENJOY THE HOLIDAY INN."
text: Plastered across it is an added streamer: "NOW OPEN." Barely
text: visible underneath are older notices: "UNDER CONSTRUCTION,"
text: and "OPENING IN JUNE."
text: As Brody passes the sign, he impulsively swings off the main
text: road and heads down towards the beach.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - DUSK
text: Brody is on restless patrol, checking the water's edge as he
text: continues on home. As he drives along, he sees: a clambake;
text: some teen-agers in a group, necking and dancing; and a few
text: solitary surfcasters and fishermen.
text: The beach is deserted, the sun is setting, and Brody and his
text: jeep have the sand to themselves. It's then that he sees
dialog: something:
text: BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW
text: A big bow section of a ruined, burnt boat is bobbing in the
text: surf just off the beach ahead. It's a piece of the
text: waterskiers' boat; Brody heads towards it.
text: ANGLE ON THE SURF
text: As Brody slows his jeep just short of the water, and gets
text: out to look at the flotsam. His shoes get wet. He backs up
text: onto dry sand, then tries to edge closer to examine this
dialog: object.
text: It bobs up and down in the surf; Brody makes "Get in here"
text: motions. The junk resists.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Come on, give a guy a break.
text: No response. He takes off his shoes and socks, and rolls up
text: his trouser legs. A silly sight. He wades into the water
dialog: after it.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Come on. Here boy. Come to Poppa...
text: It eludes him, and he flounders after it. A big wave breaks
text: across his crotch.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Hoo! Cold!
text: He's almost there, it's just beyond his reach, he's got it,
text: he's lost it, he has it again, it's slippery...
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: (ad lib)
dialog: Come here. Come on, Sweetheart. You
dialog: bastard. A little closer... Here

scene_heading: SHOCK CUT CLOSEUP - "THE THING"
text: Brody is suddenly pinned under a soggy charred horror; the
text: gory remains of Diane, burnt beyond recognition,: flesh peeled
text: away, discolored, charred, ruined by days in salt water. He

text: the dreadful clutches of the half-human thing he's dredged
text: from the water.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON BRODY
text: Extricating himself, puking, retching, splashing water on

text: are lined up in neat array, he is filling the last of them,

scene_heading: ANGLE ON BRODY

speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: Chief?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: In here.
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS

speaker_heading: HENDRICKS

speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: What about that camera?
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: What camera?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: That one -- from the wreck. You
dialog: brought it up, did you look inside
dialog: it?
text: Hendricks' guilty look confirms he didn't.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Well, what the hell -- might be
dialog: something worth seeing. Take it
dialog: somewhere and see if there's film in
dialog: it...
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS

speaker_heading: BRODY

speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close
dialog: up, okay?

speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: (at the door)
dialog: Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long
dialog: distance call, very important. Give

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BRODY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - NIGHT

speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family
dialog: affair. Where were you?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: (getting up)

dialog: what the fuss is about.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON SEAN'S DOOR
text: It opens a few inches, he looks out at the grownups and his

speaker_heading: MIKE (O.S.)
dialog: Dad, please...
speaker_heading: BRODY (O.S.)
text: Tomorrow night. Out of the water.
text: ANGLE ON THE HALLWAY
text: Mike silently storms into his room, not-so-silently slamming

text: muffled behind the door -- an expression of teen-age
dialog: rebellion.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Not so loud!
text: The music lowers its volume. Brody turns to go into the
dialog: bedroom, to take his shoes off, to go to bed...
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: I know what you're going to say.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Do you?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: (on the bed)
dialog: In the city, it happened all the
dialog: time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop,
text: top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under
dialog: the Brooklyn local, old people die
text: alone in shitty apartments and three
text: weeks later someone calls the cops
text: because of the smell and the flies.
dialog: Call the cops. What are we, immune?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: It was bad, wasn't it.
speaker_heading: BRODY

speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Yeah. I think so.

speaker_heading: PETERSON
dialog: This is the town beach; the

speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: (to Ellen)

speaker_heading: VAUGHN

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah.

speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I'm helping.
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: You know where your dad is?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Up there.

speaker_heading: VAUGHN

speaker_heading: PETERSON

speaker_heading: VAUGHN

speaker_heading: PETERSON

speaker_heading: ON THE WATER
text: Larry Vaughn, Jr. comes skimming in close to the surf. Bob

speaker_heading: LARRY

speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: That's my dad!

scene_heading: MRS. BRYANT

speaker_heading: RENEE

dialog: watching. Nature observation. Weather
dialog: measurements, that sort of thing.
dialog: (a little desperate)
dialog: Ellen, we're running late!
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Okay. Folks, if we could get back
dialog: on, we'll show you the country club,
dialog: and stop for lunch...
text: At the mention of lunch, the prospects, all hungry, begin
text: flocking back into the van. Peterson herds them along.
speaker_heading: PETERSON
dialog: The country club has an 18-hole
dialog: course, putting greens, and twelve
dialog: tennis courts...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: BRODY IN THE TOWER
text: still scanning. His body suddenly tenses. There's something
text: out there. He mashes his binoculars to his eyes, trying to
dialog: get a better look.
speaker_heading: HIS POINT OF VIEW (PROCESS)
text: Through the binoculars, something big and black, moving under
text: the buoys and into the swimming area.
speaker_heading: BRODY AGAIN
text: He can't believe it. But looking past him, we can see it
text: with the unaided eye: a seething dark mass, moving through
text: the water towards the unprotected bathers.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Out of the water! Everyone out of
dialog: the water!
text: No one can hear him. A few little faces look up, unable to
text: catch what he's saying. He starts climbing down the ladder
text: shouting.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Get out of the water! Tell everyone
dialog: to get out! Now! Out of the water!
scene_heading: ANGLE ON PETERSON, VAUGHN, AND NICHOLS
text: reacting.
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: (recalling another
dialog: panic)
dialog: Oh, my God...
speaker_heading: PETERSON
dialog: What the hell is he doing?
speaker_heading: NICHOLS
dialog: Oh, no!
scene_heading: ELLEN, MIKE, AND SEAN
text: Looking up, startled at Brody's sudden panic.
speaker_heading: THE WATER
text: The dark mass almost on top of the swimmers, who are starting
text: to look around. Most of them are oblivious to what's happening
text: on shore.
scene_heading: FOLLOW BRODY
text: as his feet hit the sand and he starts running for the water,
text: fumbling for his gun and the speed-loader with the cyanide
text: bullets. He is bumping into people, knocking little kids
text: over, stepping on blankets and umbrellas, a madman.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Out of the water! Now! Everyone!
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
text: Running too, half-stumbling, half-believing, remembering...
speaker_heading: ELLEN
text: Moving after her husband, while Mike steadies Sean, holding
text: the impulsive kid back.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (seeing something)
dialog: Martin! No!
scene_heading: ANGLE ON BRODY AGAIN
text: The gun is out now, he's trying draw a bead on the shape in
text: the water; chest heaving, he tries to steady his shaky grip.
text: People see the gun and scream, throwing themselves flat on
text: the sand, running, some of them going into the water.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: No! Don't go in! Stay out! Stay clear!
text: He fires. Again. Bullets ricochet off the water, howling
text: towards the horizon. Real panic now. Four more shots.
text: Reloading, ejected rounds falling bright into the sand, Brody
text: on his knees, fumbling with bullets.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON A LIFEGUARD
text: standing on his platform, shocked, watching the Chief of
text: Police fumbling with his gun.
speaker_heading: LIFEGUARD
dialog: It's bluefish! It's a school of
dialog: bluefish! Chief! It's bluefish!
scene_heading: ANGLE ON THE WATER
text: It is bluefish -- a tight mass of them, churning up the water
text: in a dark, dense group. The swimmers look around, confused
text: by the shots and excitement.
speaker_heading: A SWIMMER
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: ANOTHER SWIMMER
dialog: Fish! Anyone got a net?
speaker_heading: 3RD SWIMMER
dialog: Someone get me a rod and reel!
text: Laughter defuses the tension in the water; bathers move
text: around, some getting closer to see the fish, others leaving
text: the water to join friends and families on the sand.
text: ANGLE ON THE BEACH
text: where Brody is now standing, panting, coming down as a crowd
text: collects at a safe distance around him: Ellen emerges from a
text: group that includes Vaughn, Peterson, and Nichols.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Sorry. I'm sorry. False alarm...
text: Curious crowd murmurs as they watch this lunacy. Brody
text: realizes he's fired his weapon, that spent shells litter the
text: sand at his feet.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Okay, it's all over, go on, it's
dialog: over. No trouble...
text: Ellen joins him.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: It's okay. It's over...
text: Brody drops to his knees, fumbling for the cyanide bullets
text: in his gun, trying to put things in order, scrabbling in the
text: sand for the empty shells.
text: The crowd is curious and embarrassed. Some turn away, others
text: drift back to their blankets, talking about what's just
text: happened, others stare rudely. Brody is coming apart.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: It's all right, everything's all
dialog: right...
text: Sean emerges from the crowd, and helps his daddy pick up the
text: bullets, Ellen moves to disperse the rudely curious.
speaker_heading: ELLEN (O.S.)
dialog: Let's go, everyone... Mrs. Bryant,
dialog: Len, please...
scene_heading: CLOSE ON BRODY AND SEAN
text: He sees Sean, his eyes fill with tears, and he grabs the kid
text: in a fierce hug.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. TOWN HALL - DAY
text: A hurriedly called meeting of the town's Selectmen is in
text: session: Vaughn, Peterson, and three others: Kaiser, an old
text: man still in his grocery clerk's apron; Sansom; and Nichols,
text: the woman on the beach.
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: Brody's a good man.
speaker_heading: KAISER
dialog: Nobody says he isn't.
speaker_heading: PETERSON
dialog: You should've been out there. You
dialog: should've seen him waving that gun,
text: like a maniac. There were shots fired!
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: He thought he had a good reason.
speaker_heading: MS. NICHOLS
dialog: But that's not rational behavior!
speaker_heading: PETERSON
dialog: That's what I'm saying!
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: How many people were there?
speaker_heading: MS. NICHOLS
dialog: Hundred! Literally hundreds. What
dialog: are they going to say about us?
speaker_heading: PETERSON
dialog: (to Vaughn)
dialog: Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to
dialog: make a buck like anybody else.
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: So? So?
speaker_heading: PETERSON
dialog: So it can't be done like that. The
dialog: man's a menace, plain and simple.
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: Look, what am I supposed to do? It's
dialog: done, it's over. We have to deal
dialog: with the consequences.
speaker_heading: SANSOM
dialog: That's what we're here to do.
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: All right. Let's go into my office,
dialog: where we can have a little privacy.
scene_heading: ANGLE FROM INSIDE VAUGHN'S OFFICE
text: as the selectmen troop into the cramped quarters. Vaughn
text: deliberately closes the door as they find seats around the
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: I believe we have a quorum, and
dialog: informally, I suggest we call this
dialog: meeting an executive session and
dialog: dispense with minutes...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BRODY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Brody, alone, is sitting at his desk, morosely studying a
text: little gold statuette of a pistol marksman. What's done is
text: done, and Brody is trying to figure out how to live with it.
text: The phone rings, is answered in the other room. The buzzer
text: sounds. Brody picks up his end.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Polly, no calls, please...
dialog: (she insists)
dialog: Okay, okay.
dialog: (he punches a button)
dialog: Hello... Phil? Fogarty? What
dialog: pictures... I'll be right down...
text: He slams down the phone and gets up to go, suddenly possessed
dialog: with a purpose.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DARKROOM - DAY
text: Amid the equipment, clutter and proofs, some shots of the
text: holidome opening, drying on wires. Phil Fogarty, the indignant
text: fat man and town photographer, is locking the door behind an
text: impatient Brody.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: I don't know what you did, but that
dialog: kid stopped. I haven't heard one
dialog: peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for
dialog: days. Believe me, it's a pleasure...
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: You said something about a camera.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought
dialog: in this camera, see, from underwater,
dialog: and I didn't know how to get it open,
dialog: but my brother-in-law, in Montauk,
text: he works at a hi-fi store, and they
dialog: sell cameras, so he...
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Did you get any pictures?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Well, yeah, I did, that's the funny
dialog: thing. You can't tell much from the
dialog: negatives, I was going to blow 'em
dialog: up. Here's a test I did...
text: He holds out an 8 x 10 proof, Brody snatches it from him.
scene_heading: INSERT - PHOTOGRAPH
text: Brody stares down at it. Sure enough, the ghostly outlines
text: of the Orca, underwater, a diver on the deck making a gesture
text: at the camera.
speaker_heading: BRODY (O.S.)
dialog: Oh, Jesus. That boat...
text: ANGLE ON BRODY AND PHIL
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Not bad -- that's a real fast lens,
dialog: probably 1.4. Look at the diffusion,
dialog: though...
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: What else you got?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Let's see -- you got a minute?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Okay, okay -- stand over there...
text: He gestures, Brody steps to one side of a table with some
text: big enamel pans for washing and developing prints. Phil
text: switches to a red light, and takes some printing paper,
text: putting it under the enlarger.
speaker_heading: QUICK CUTS:
text: -- Enlarger light going on.
text: -- Timer ticking, the hand turning.
dialog: -- Quick negative images: water, boat, diver, hand, boat
text: again, tantalizing fragments of the opening sequence projected
text: on the enlarger's flat base.
text: -- Hypo and Developer sloshing in a pan under Phil's hands.
text: -- Brody staring down.
speaker_heading: INSERT (PROCESS)
text: Quietly gaining contrast in a pan of developer, a print of
text: what at first looks like seaweed, then is unmistakably the
text: grinning jaws of the Great White.
scene_heading: SUBLIMINAL FLASH CUT - SHARK
text: A quick nightmare vision of Brody, alone in a sinking Orca,
text: trapped in a battered cabin interior; a Great White crashes
text: through the glass, its head huge as it lunges.
scene_heading: INSERT PHOTOGRAPH IN DEVELOPER (PROCESS)
text: The close-up detail of this otherwise blurred and unreadable
text: photo is unmistakably a detail from a very close view of the
dialog: snapping jaws of a Great White; if you hadn't seen it as a
dialog: memory, it would make no sense at all. For Brody, the meaning
dialog: is all too clear; for anyone who's never seen the monster
text: face-to-face, it's nothing.
speaker_heading: BRODY (O.S.)
dialog: (shaken)
dialog: That one there. That one...
text: Phil's hands, holding plastic tongs, gently slosh the print
text: in the bath. The shark's features are indistinguishable from
text: the surrounding detail.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT
text: Brody walks into view, and starts up the steps into the town
text: hall, already lit from within. He's carrying a large envelope.
scene_heading: INT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT
text: The Selectmen (Kaiser, Sansom, Nichols), Len Peterson, and
text: Vaughn are seated informally around the big table.
speaker_heading: PETERSON
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: Speak of the devil.
text: Brody enters, carrying the envelope with the photo.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Thank God you guys were all together.
dialog: I got something for you. Proof!
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: Martin, this is kind of an official
dialog: meeting
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Perfect. Look at this ---
text: He fumbles with the envelope.
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has
dialog: a question only you can answer.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: (preoccupied)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PETERSON
dialog: Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill
dialog: in as an interim Chief of Police in
dialog: your absence?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Temporarily? Uh... sure... The
dialog: question's out of left field. Why
dialog: are they asking?
speaker_heading: NICHOLS
dialog: So Jeff could handle things? He knows
dialog: the routine, he has the authority?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Yeah. Why?
speaker_heading: PETERSON
text: It came up during the meeting.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Look -- I just got this from Phil
text: Fogarty. It was in the camera
text: belonging to the missing divers. It
dialog: proves I was right, all along.
text: He throws the picture down in front of them. They bend over
dialog: to study it, pass it around, look at it.
speaker_heading: KAISER
dialog: Seaweed?
speaker_heading: NICHOLS
dialog: It's underwater, isn't it? That's
dialog: why it's so dark.
speaker_heading: SANSOM
dialog: I don't know -- what is it?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: It's a shark! A Great White! Jesus,
dialog: it's right there!
text: He snatches up the photo.
speaker_heading: INSERT PHOTO
text: Just as before, an ambiguous pattern of light and dark; not
text: proof of anything without Brody's inner vision.
speaker_heading: VAUGHN (O.S.)
dialog: It's nothing I can see.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON BRODY
text: waving the picture.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: What are you all, blind? It's a shark.
text: Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.
speaker_heading: PETERSON
dialog: Is that what it is?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: You're damn right that's what it is.
speaker_heading: NICHOLS
dialog: I'm sorry, I just don't see it.
dialog: Sansom and Kaiser agree, ad lib, "That's nothing..."
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: Martin, it could be anything.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: (exploding)
dialog: What the hell does it take to make
dialog: sense to you numbskulls? Jesus, it's
dialog: right there in front of you. I know
dialog: what a goddamn shark looks like,
dialog: I've been through it, don't you
dialog: understand? I've seen this sonofabitch
dialog: before!
text: The Selectmen look at each other in the face of Brody's
text: agitation. Tempers are running high.
speaker_heading: PETERSON
dialog: What have you seen before? This is
text: nothing. Seaweed. Mud. Something in
dialog: the lens.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: My ass!
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: Be reasonable, please...
speaker_heading: PETERSON
dialog: (to Vaughn)
dialog: Forget it, he won't listen.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: There is nothing to discuss.
speaker_heading: PETERSON
dialog: (blowing up)
dialog: Will you listen to this man? Will
dialog: you just listen to him?
dialog: (to Brody)
dialog: You really caused a panic on a public
dialog: beach, you shoot up the place, God
dialog: knows who could've been injured --
dialog: what if somebody decides to sue us?
dialog: That could ruin us.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Is that what it is? Dollars? Money?
dialog: I'll pay for it. Take it out of my
dialog: salary.
speaker_heading: PETERSON
dialog: You don't make enough.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Maybe I don't make as much money as
dialog: some bullshit rip-off artists around
dialog: here, but I don't work the same way.
speaker_heading: PETERSON
dialog: What's that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: It means I don't like all that grab-
dialog: ass and heavy breathing with my wife,
dialog: it means I know who's out to screw
dialog: me here, and it means that I know
dialog: something none of you know because
dialog: I've been there -- and I don't want
text: to go through that horror again.
dialog: Ever!
text: There's a long pause.
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: Martin, could you wait here for a
dialog: few minutes while we make up our
dialog: minds about something?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Go ahead, whatever it's worth.
text: The Selectmen file into Vaughn's office, leaving Brody alone
text: in the room. The last one in the door very carefully makes
text: sure it's tightly shut.
text: Brody sits alone at the table.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. VAUGHN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: They are sitting there, deliberating.
speaker_heading: PETERSON
dialog: I won't mention his personal attack
dialog: on me.
speaker_heading: NICHOLS
dialog: I've never seen him like this.
speaker_heading: PETERSON
dialog: And Hendricks is qualified, you heard
text: that from his own mouth.
speaker_heading: KAISER
dialog: We made a motion and it was already
dialog: seconded.
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: (official)
text: Very well then. It is moved and
dialog: seconded that Martin Brody be relieved
dialog: of his duties as Chief of Police,
dialog: his contract with the township be
dialog: terminated, and that Jeff Hendricks
dialog: be appointed Acting Chief in the
dialog: interim. Those in favor?
text: All the hands go up.
speaker_heading: PETERSON
dialog: Anyone opposed, or is it unanimous?
text: Vaughn's hand goes up, the sole dissent. They stare at him.
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: I'm sorry, but I respect his
text: convictions. The motion is carried.
text: He goes to the door, and opens it.
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: Martin? Could you come in please?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The police jeep pulls up and stops; although the engine's
text: shut down, Brody still sits quietly inside the car. Then his
text: hand appears at the window, and he drops an empty beer can
text: onto the lawn. Clink.
text: After a while, he drops another beer can, then another, until
text: the "clinks" tell us he's polished off a six-pack on the way
text: home. Not too steady on his feet, Brody climbs out of the
text: car and starts for the door to his house.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Ellen is working at her desk in the den. She is looking
text: towards the door, expectantly -- it's been an unusually long
text: pause between car arrival and husband arrival. Brody enters.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Hi. I closed a sale today, without
dialog: Len. That's $1200 commission, if the
text: papers go through.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: That's great.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
text: Sean's asleep.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: That's great too. Gorgeous.
text: He takes a long look at her.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: You look about 22 years old sitting
dialog: there. Like you were doing homework...
text: He goes to join her, bumping into some furniture in the dimly
text: lit room. Ellen has a beer and sandwich half-finished on her
text: desk; Brody takes a healthy swallow from the beer.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (sensitive)
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Ooohh, nothing. I just got fired,
dialog: that's all.
text: He tosses the photo sloppily on the desk.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: What'd I say?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: That you were fired.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Then that's what I meant. Fired.
dialog: Canned. Out on my fanny. The Selectmen
dialog: just made Hendricks the new Chief of
dialog: Police. Just like that.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Because of today? The beach?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: (expansively)
text: No sweat. A blessing in disguise.
dialog: Back to the city, you can go to
dialog: Bloomingdale's without waiting six
dialog: hours for the ferryboat... we're
dialog: surrounded by water here, you realize
dialog: that? Me, surrounded by water...
dialog: Ridiculous.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Stop that! We're not going any place.
dialog: You love it here. Tell me what the
dialog: hell happened!
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Showed them the photo, showed them
dialog: the goddamn Shark, big as life. They
dialog: didn't see it. Not like me. Not like
dialog: the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped
dialog: this li'l picture... He's out there,
dialog: somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot
dialog: off my big mouth, so they fired me...
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (studying the photo)
dialog: Honey, this is nothing... I don't
dialog: know what it is. What did they...
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: (going on)
dialog: ...Everybody wants the job. No one
dialog: wants the authority. Except Hendricks.
dialog: Fine. He can go out there in that
dialog: precious boat, and when he looks
text: whitey in his big mouth he can just
dialog: call me. Call me in New York... tell
dialog: him to kiss my ass...
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (seeing his pain)
dialog: They have no right to treat you like
dialog: that. You've given them everything.
dialog: For four years, you've protected
dialog: this town, the people on this
dialog: island...
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Fired me!
dialog: (at Ellen)
dialog: I'm not a hysterical man. I'm
dialog: responsible. I know what I saw...
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I know you did...
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: I try. Goddamnit, I tried... Now,
dialog: I'm tired... I can't keep fighting
dialog: it... I'm too tired... I'm... I'm...
text: Brody's slipping under; the beers and the day have finally
text: overcome him. He slumps in Ellen's arms.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: You're drunk is what you are...
text: She eases him onto the couch, tucking a comforter over his
text: inert shape.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Take it easy... Easy...
text: ANGLE ON THE STAIRWELL
text: Sean comes down the stairs, sleepy, in his pajamas.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Is dad home? I heard something...
text: He comes into the darkened den.
speaker_heading: ELLEN AND SEAN
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Shhhh. Go back upstairs. Daddy's
dialog: sleeping.
text: Sean finds the photo, and stares at it idly.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Nothing, sweetheart. Seaweed.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. NEWSSTORE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (holding a book)

speaker_heading: TIMMY
dialog: Gaff rigged? Why not a staysail

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Hey, Mike -- I saw your dad over at

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Hey, it's all bullshit. Anyone want
dialog: to play pong for money?
text: No one does. There's a bustle at the door, and some couples
text: enter from the movies: Patrick and Lucy, Ed and Tina, Polo
text: and Jackie. There are a lot of ad-lib greetings;
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: How was the show?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yech.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: It was okay.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I'd rather go the lighthouse.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Who wouldn't.
speaker_heading: POLO
dialog: Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Now? At night?
speaker_heading: POLO
dialog: Nah. Tomorrow. Early, spend the day.
dialog: My folks left two cases of beer in
dialog: the garage.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Is it still there?
speaker_heading: POLO
dialog: Nope. Got it in my boat.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: All-right.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Let's go for it.
dialog: There's a general ad-lib agreement to organize a day's sailing
dialog: picnic.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Mike, you going?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Why shouldn't I?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I thought you might still be painting
text: the restrooms at the beach.
text: Laughter from the gang.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Anyone want a coke or anything?
text: They break up into pairs and trios, some going for the soda

text: ANGLE ON JACKIE AND MIKE
speaker_heading: JACKIE

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: It'll be fun, come on!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Maybe you and Brooke could come over
dialog: to the town beach...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: No way. Everybody's going sailing.
dialog: If you don't want to take me, just
dialog: say so.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That's not it. My dad told me not to
dialog: go.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You do everything your parents tell

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Good. I'll be on the dock at eight.

text: stumbled upstairs sometime during the night. There's a noise
text: down the hall, from Mike's room. Brody stirs, but doesn't
dialog: wake up.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MIKE'S ROOM - DAY
text: Mike is holding a lamp that's almost fallen -- the noise we
text: just heard. He's almost dressed, but not quite satisfied
text: with his image in the mirror. He takes off his clean shirt,
text: and checks a more comfortable, worn shirt. A brief sniff to
dialog: make sure it's okay for another day, and he puts it on; he
text: tiptoes to the hall, where a noise stops him in his tracks.
scene_heading: INT. BRODY HALLWAY - DAY
text: Mike is frozen in his part-opened bedroom door. Sean's door
text: opens, and little Sean, also fully dressed, comes sneaking
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: You're going out.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You're going sailing.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Take me.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (louder)
dialog: I want to go with you!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Quiet! Shhh!
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (even louder)
dialog: Michael...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Okay, okay. Close your door.
text: Sean does, and happily tiptoes with exaggerated stealth to
text: Mike; the two of them start downstairs.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BRODY HOUSE
text: Michael and Sean are walking away towards the road into town.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BRODY UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY
text: Brody emerges from the bathroom, dressed in sweatshirt, and
text: cutoffs: no uniform today. He starts downstairs, stopping
text: only to look into Mike's room. It's empty.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Good morning, America...
text: A grin crosses his face -- "My son, the Don Juan..." He goes
dialog: downstairs.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BRODY KITCHEN - DAY
text: Brody enters from upstairs. He heats coffee. Ellen enters
text: dressed for work. He pours two cups.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: What're you going to do today?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Turn in the car. Clean my desk,
dialog: explain things to our sons, then
dialog: maybe get shit-faced and punch your
dialog: boss.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I'll give notice.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Don't rush into it -- we may need
dialog: the income.
text: She pours the coffee, they drink it for a moment.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Mike left early. Couldn't wait to
dialog: make out. Must be a morning man.
text: Ellen and Brody sip their coffee quietly for a few moments.
text: Mrs. Silvera arrives, carrying groceries.
scene_heading: MRS. SILVERA
dialog: Morning. Anything special today?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Sean's not up yet. You
dialog: know what he likes,
dialog: just some Fruit Loops
dialog: and milk. No candy.
speaker_heading: BRODY
text: The sink upstairs is busted.
dialog: Try some Drano, or a
dialog: plunger, maybe. Or call
dialog: your brother, the plumber,
dialog: what's his name...
scene_heading: MRS. SILVERA
dialog: Frankie. He's my cousin.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Frankie. Okay. Ask him if he needs
dialog: an apprentice.
text: Brody and Ellen are at the door.
scene_heading: MRS. SILVERA
dialog: Have a nice day.
text: They leave.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY
text: The Kids are into their boats, fitting out for a day of
text: recreational offshore sailing. Mike and Andy are readying
text: his Tornado, while Sean gets in the way. In the b.g.,
text: Hendricks can be seen puttering around on the Amity police
dialog: boat.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: If you're beached, why are we doing
dialog: this? For practice?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Then why are we futzing around the
dialog: dock? We can make a few bucks working
text: at the beach.
text: Sean knocks something over, Mike snaps at him.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Look -- if you're going to get in
dialog: the way, you can just go home.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I'm not in the way. Andy, am I in
dialog: the way?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You're always in the way.
text: Marge joins them, scooping Sean up.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: This guy giving you any trouble?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Put me down!
speaker_heading: ANDY
text: Put him down in the water.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (to Sean)
dialog: You want to go out in my boat?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Would you take him?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You've just made someone very happy.
text: Marge and Sean go over to her Lightening. Brooke and Jackie
text: come down the dock, dressed for sailing.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Mike! Are you going out?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I thought you were grounded.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I can go out if I want to.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You can?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You going to the lighthouse?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I could give you a dozen good reasons.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (to Andy)
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Is there room on your boat for all
dialog: of us?
text: Mike looks: Andy, Jackie, Brooke, himself... Timmy moves in,
text: sensing the chance of a lifetime.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Well, we're pretty crowded, and I
dialog: don't know when we're leaving...
text: Timmy makes his move.
speaker_heading: TIMMY
dialog: I've got room.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Great.
dialog: (to Andy)
dialog: That's okay -- I'll go with Timmy.
speaker_heading: TIMMY
dialog: You will?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Sure.
text: And she walks towards his boat, looking back for him to
text: follow. He's dumbstruck by his sudden good fortune.
speaker_heading: TIMMY
dialog: Fan-tas-tic!
text: He runs to join her, untying mooring lines like crazy; they're
text: together again at last for the first time. Andy is left
text: shuffling with Mike and Jackie.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I'm ready.
text: And she plops down in Mike's boat, ready to be taken.
dialog: Anywhere.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Come on, you guys.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Well, I don't know...
text: Jackie flashes him one of her pouty little smiles. Why break
dialog: one heart when you can break two? Or more?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Please come with us?
text: Mike is glaring. The message is clear, if unspoken.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: For me...?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: What the hell. For you...
text: Andy joins them. Mike casts off, while Andy helps, and Jackie
text: sits there, looking cute.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON LARRY AND BOB
text: watching what's going on.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I thought you said she was going
dialog: with us?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Let's just go sailing, okay?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (casting off)
dialog: Want to talk about it?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Want to swim home?
text: Bob gets the message and shuts up. The Sizzler fills its
text: sails, and points out of the harbor.
scene_heading: WIDE ON THE HARBOR
text: Lots of day-sailing Kids, a few bigger, adult boats, some
dialog: working fishermen and sport fishers; a typical recreational
text: boating mix. The Kids are finding the same general direction,
text: pointing out of the harbor.
speaker_heading: QUICK CUTS
dialog: -- Sails being trimmed.
text: -- Brooke and Timmy, staring into each other's eyes as he
text: sets a course straight for the lighthouse.
text: -- Larry, lifting a hull, almost losing Bob.
scene_heading: EXT. HARBOR MOUTH - DAY
text: The Kids' boats, in a loose bunch, slipping out to sea.
scene_heading: REVERSE - LOOKING OUT TO SEA
text: The dive class boat, isolated near the channel, a group of
text: Kids in wet suits and tanks assembled with three adult
text: instructors: Tom Andrews, Crosby, and Sparky.
scene_heading: EXT. DIVING BOAT - DAY
text: Andrews and his assistant instructor, Sparky, are addressing
text: the class, when Mike and Andy's "Green Machine" sails by,
dialog: close.
speaker_heading: ANDREWS
dialog: Hey! Nicholas! You're supposed to be
dialog: in class!
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Today I'm staying topside. You dive
dialog: for me!
speaker_heading: ANDREWS
dialog: I'm going for lobster.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Great! Find one for me.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: With butter, if they got any...
text: Andrews dismisses them with a good-natured wave.
speaker_heading: ANDREWS
dialog: So long, turkies.
text: He turns to his class.
speaker_heading: ANDREWS
dialog: Sparky will take you down today. If
dialog: everyone's got a buddy, we'll drop.
text: The class dutifully lines up and starts going in, while in
text: the b.g. the Kids sailboats head out to sea. Andrews' two
text: partners, Crosby and Sparky, get ready to follow the class
dialog: over.
speaker_heading: CROSBY
dialog: (to Andrews)
dialog: Let's get some dinner.
text: He goes over, Andrews following. Sparky is with the class,
text: signaling "Down;" they submerge like clumsy seals.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER
text: The class, paired up, is drifting down; Sparky offering
text: encouragement as they descend. Andrews and Crosby are already
text: disappearing, swimming away with strong kicks.
text: FOLLOWING ANDREWS AND CROSBY
text: as they go over the edge of a shelf and drop into darker,
text: deeper waters. Crosby checks his depth, his watch, looks
dialog: around...
scene_heading: HIS POINT OF VIEW
text: far above him, the class, going about their business.
text: Below him, murk, depth, and suddenly, a big lunker bass.
text: Andrews sees it, too.
scene_heading: ANGLE - ON ANDREWS
text: Assuming Crosby is following, he takes off, following the
text: big lunker. Crosby, hung up in some minor equipment problem,
text: misses seeing him go. The two men are separated. Follow
text: Andrews as he twists and turns after the bass, going deeper,
text: losing him in the rocks, suddenly rounding a boulder, and
text: meeting, almost face-to-face, horror:
text: BELOW HIM THE SHARK
text: The Great White Shark, taking the striper in a single gulp,
text: it's looking up at Andrews with one glassy doll's eye; it
text: turns to face him directly, and we see the scar; ugly, red
text: and black, charred flesh from jaw back on the right side,
text: eyes and teeth gleaming like raw bone in the massive, uncaring
dialog: face.
text: Andrews' mouth clamps violently on his mouthpiece, then goes
text: wide as he screams in fear into the water. Finning backwards,
text: he ditches his weights, gulps for air, and yanks the cord on
text: his safety vest. It balloons out, and pulls him up, surging
text: towards the surface. The mouthpiece, useless, falls away
text: from his lips.
text: Eyes closed, hose dangling, Andrews hurtles upward, holding
text: his breath in a final, fatal panic, passing a startled Crosby.
speaker_heading: THE DIVERS
text: look over at the rocketing ascent. What's wrong? Sparky
text: signals "up," and they begin to carefully follow him towards
text: the surface. Crosby's already surfacing.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: DECK OF THE DIVING BOAT - DAY
text: Andrews is on his side, bloody froth on his lips. One of the
text: class is clinging to his legs, trying to arrest his
text: convulsions. Sparky is holding his shoulders, trying to
dialog: administer mouth-to-mouth.
speaker_heading: SPARKY
dialog: Get us in! For Christ's sake, get us
dialog: in!
text: In his arms, Andrews writhes, pain knotting his limbs.
text: Behind them, in the water, the fin surfaces, and casually
text: turns towards... the ocean. The Shark is headed for the sea.
text: And for the now distant Kids in their sailboats, dotting the
text: horizon in their familiar bright colors.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - ED AND TINA'S SANDPIPER - DAY
text: They are alone. In the middle distance, the rest of the Kids'
text: sails can be seen, headed for the lighthouse in the distance.
text: The Sandpiper's sails are luffing, they're making no headway.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: You want to tack, or just leave her
dialog: pointed up like this?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (snuggling close)
dialog: Just like this.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: What about sailing?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: The tide's running. It'll take us to
dialog: the light.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: It'll take us to Budapest if you're
dialog: not careful.
text: Ed is lashing the rudder as they continue to drift with the
dialog: current.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: First things first.
text: He fumbles in a cooler chest, produces a bottle of wine.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: What about the others?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: They'll be there when we get there.
dialog: Might even have a fire started.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: What're we going to do in the mean
dialog: time?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I dunno. We'll think of something.
text: He pours the wine into the two paper cups.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: But first, a little juice...
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: And second?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (kissing her)
dialog: Mmmmmm.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: (resisting)
dialog: Wait a minute. Promise me something.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Anything. Anything.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: That you'll put down a blanket. I've
dialog: got black and blue marks all over my
dialog: butt, and my Mom's getting uptight
dialog: about them.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You got it.
text: And he fumbles for a blanket in a locker, thumping and banging
text: gear around as he rummages for it. Tina sips wine contentedly,
text: satisfied to wait.
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER
text: The Sandpiper's hull, alone above us, as the Shark rises
text: with dreadful certainty, attracted by the erratic sounds of
text: Ed's hasty search.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON TINA - WATCHING THE OCEAN
text: The terrible fin breaks the surface, about 20 yards out,
text: then dips and disappears. Then, impossibly fast, the entire
text: Sandpiper is lifted from underneath by a powerful surge, as
text: the Shark lunges up against it from below, an unseen horror.
text: Ed is knocked over the side, into the water.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON ED
text: as he breaks the surface, shaking the hair out of his eyes,
text: trying to orient himself, finding the boat. He starts to
text: swim for it, Tina extending an arm to help him climb aboard.
scene_heading: ANGLE OVER THE GUNWALE, TOWARDS ED
text: He has barely taken two strokes when a powerful force takes
text: him from below the surface, rushing him towards us through
text: the water. Tina screams. Before Ed can react to the pain, he
text: is slammed face first into the boat. His jaw breaks, blood
text: smears his nose and lip.
text: His hands grab the wooden-cap rail with a death-grip.
speaker_heading: REVERSE
text: Tina is staring down at the water, terror-stricken; Ed's
text: arms and head are f.g., as he locks onto the boat with
text: desperate hands.
speaker_heading: INSERT
text: Ed's hands on the rail, knuckles white, an iron grip. With
text: awful finality, the force pulls down, and the wood shatters
text: and splits away as Ed's hands are pulled down and under by
dialog: the awful force.
speaker_heading: TINA
text: her mouth working silently, unable to scream, staring down
text: at the blood and froth on the water, swirling in a grim eddy
text: under her, the Sandpiper rocking gently in the diminishing
dialog: swell.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - DAY - ESTABLISHING SHOT
text: On the way to the lighthouse, but away from the harbor, the
text: Kids are sailing in fairly close order: The sloops (Polo,
text: Timmy, Marge) heeled well over in the stiff breeze, the faster
text: cats (Mike, Larry, Donny, etc.) skimming around, tacking
text: more often, faster and more maneuverable.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON PATRICK AND LUCY
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Faster! Faster!
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Coming about...
text: She ducks under the boom, handling the jib sheets with easy
text: familiarity. They come about and scoot off on a new tack.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON POLO
text: Reading the wind, trimming sail expertly, competent and alone.
speaker_heading: POLO
dialog: (to a near-by boat)
dialog: Great day! I think the wind's going
dialog: to change...
text: CLOSE ON TIMMY AND BROOKE
text: He comes about, she slides into him, he holds her to steady
text: her, she snuggles into his arms. True love, at last... He's
dialog: thrilled.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON DOUG
text: In his inflatable, poking slowly along. Marge passes him,
text: Sean hooting with glee.
speaker_heading: MARGE
text: Coming up.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Slowpoke! Slowpoke! Marge is faster!
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I'm getting new sails, then watch
dialog: out. Just a question of modifying
dialog: the rigging!
scene_heading: ANGLE ON MIKE'S "GREEN MACHINE"
text: Jackie, Mike and Andy, clipping along, Larry Vaughn and Bob
text: in the Sizzler nearby. Mike lifts the hull, Jackie squeals
text: in delight.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Wheee! Faster!
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: How fast is enough?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I want to go faster!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Hang on...
text: He trims his sheets, the cat heels more, one hull flying,
text: Andy and Jackie clinging to the trampoline.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON THE SIZZLER
text: Larry is carefully adjusting his tiller, Bob senses what
dialog: he's doing.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You coming up on him?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: You bet. Hang on...
text: They gybe sharply, running up behind the green cat.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Coming up! Give way!
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Like hell! We're on the starboard
dialog: tack!
scene_heading: THE SIZZLER AND THE "GREEN MACHINE"
text: Running close to each other; very tight two-by-two.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Don't let him pass. Faster!
text: Mike and Larry silently fight for clean air, racing. Water
text: splashes over them.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: My hair's getting wet!
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: So's mine.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON MIKE'S BOAT
text: He veers onto a less dramatic tack, sparing Jackie's hair.
text: Larry and Bob speed by, yelling.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: When do we get to the lighthouse?
speaker_heading: ANDY
text: Soon, dark eyes, soon.
speaker_heading: MIKE
text: The tide's turning.
text: Andy reveals a knowledgeable side to his character.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: We're going to be fighting the
dialog: current.
dialog: (he looks up)
text: Wind's backing around a few points,
dialog: too.
text: Jackie snuggles against Mike.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I can't wait to get there.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: But of course.
text: He goes forward to trim the jib, leaving the lovebirds
text: snuggling astern. They pull away from us, and we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. AMITY WATERFRONT STREET - DAY
text: Ellen and Brody are in the jeep; he's driving her to work.
text: There's a crowd at dockside, and the town ambulance's now
text: familiar blinking red light. Brody, out of force of habit,
text: wheels the jeep towards the action, nudging through the crowd,
text: which gives way to the official blue-and-white vehicle.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Hey -- it's not your job any more.
dialog: I'm going to be late for work.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Just one minute...

speaker_heading: DOCKSIDE
text: The dive boat is moored at a clumsy angle next to the Police
text: Boat, where Hendricks has been pulling routine maintenance.
text: The Police launch is cluttered with tools and spare parts;
text: some non-essential piece of gear is stripped and laid out on
text: the deck. Hendricks is on the dive boat, kneeling next to
dialog: Andrews.
scene_heading: ABOARD THE DIVE BOAT
text: Andrews is shaking, bloody froth on his lips and chest. The
text: shaken divers are huddled together, an ambulance attendant
text: is wheeling a gurney into position. Crosby and Sparky are
text: stunned.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: What the hell happened?
speaker_heading: SPARKY
text: Embolism. Air bubbles in his blood.
dialog: Came up too damn fast. Held his
dialog: goddamn breath!
text: He is near collapse himself.
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: Easy...
speaker_heading: CROSBY
dialog: He panicked! Something scared him!
text: An Ambulance Attendant is putting a blanket around Sparky.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: It's okay. We're taking care of him.
text: The other attendant holds something out to Brody. Brody
text: examines it; a scuba mouthpiece, bitten in two, useless.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: How'd this happen?
speaker_heading: SPARKY
text: Bite reflex, like a spasm.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: Right after, the Kids went out?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: What Kids? Who went out?
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: All of them. Mike, Junior Vaughn,
dialog: Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all
dialog: that whole gang.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Mike? Our Mike?
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
text: Yep. Looked like they were headed to
dialog: the lighthouse.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: How long ago?
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
text: About an hour, maybe two.
dialog: (thinking)
dialog: Let's see -- I came on about eight...
text: Brody is gone, pushing through the crowd.
scene_heading: THE POLICE BOAT
text: Brody is casting off lines. Ellen is on the dock, watching
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: What're you doing?
speaker_heading: BRODY
text: Going out.
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: Uh, Chief -- look. You're not Chief
dialog: any more.
text: Brody keeps working, making ready for sea.
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: I can't let you take her out.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: You can't stop me.
text: Ellen is climbing aboard, taking off her heels.
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go,
dialog: then you can't go. Neither of you
dialog: can go.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I'm going.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Mike's out there.
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: But I signed for the boat. You're
dialog: not authorized any more.
text: Brody starts the engines with a roar, and slams it into
text: reverse. The boat starts out of the slip, then lunges to a
text: halt, shuddering on its still-fastened bow mooring line.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Untie that rope.
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: Please. It's my job.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I'll do it.
text: And she moves purposefully towards the boat cleat.
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: Mrs. Brody, please...
text: Brody is shifting gears, the boat is crabbing sideways as he
text: puts the helm hard over. It bumps the dock, hard.
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: You're too close. Back off.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope
dialog: there.
text: Hendricks goes to the bow, jumps aboard and frees the bow
text: line. The boat slips into reverse, the water boiling as Brody
text: guns it away from the dock.
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: Let me. Please.
text: He takes the wheel, eases off on the rudder, and comes about,
text: pointing the launch out to sea.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Hurry, please.
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: What the hell, they can't fire both
dialog: of us -- someone's got to be in
dialog: charge, right? Which way are we going?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Find the Kids. The lighthouse -- you
dialog: said something about the lighthouse.
dialog: Get us there.
scene_heading: WIDE ON THE HARBOR
text: The Amity Police Boat, Brody, Ellen and Hendricks aboard, is

speaker_heading: JACKIE

speaker_heading: LARRY

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I don't care.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I love it.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Sure you do -- you win either way.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (simply)
dialog: I'm supposed to.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: It's a bet. Once around the marker
dialog: buoy?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That's the pin -- the buoy.
text: Larry is confident -- he's got the air, but Mike suddenly
text: gybes without warning, snapping onto a new fast tack,
text: downwind. Larry and Bob are caught by surprise, and lose
text: precious moments as they fumble with their sails.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: (pulling away)
dialog: Turkeys! Eat wind!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yee-hah!
text: He pounds with glee on the canvas trampoline as their boat
text: moves ahead, a drumming sound.
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER
text: The twin hulls of a catamaran's hull, the muffled, eerie
text: sound of drumming, as the water carries the tempting "thud-
text: thud-thud" sound down to the deep.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON DOUG IN HIS INFLATABLE
text: falling behind as the boats change course for the marker
text: buoy, following Larry and Mike's lead.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Hey! Wait for the H.M.S. Invincible!
text: Brooke and Timmy sail by him, laughing; Polo with them.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Can't -- we're watching a race!
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Since when? Who's racing?
speaker_heading: TIMMY
dialog: Larry and Mike!
scene_heading: PATRICK AND LUCY
text: Pat and Lucy are trimming sail, moving faster.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Mike and Larry are racing! Loser
dialog: goes home alone!
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: If we beat them, they can both go
dialog: home stag! Single-O! Alone! Jackie
dialog: can come back in this boat!
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: What about me?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Uh. Well. Maybe you could give Polo
text: a hand going in...
speaker_heading: LUCY
text: (snapping him with a
dialog: rope)
dialog: Your ass I will. Besides, the wind's
text: turning with the tide. Sailing back
dialog: is going to be a bitch.
scene_heading: QUICK CUTS - SAILBOAT RACING MONTAGE
text: -- Ropes and sails rattling through blocks.
text: -- Sails snapping taut, filling with wind.
text: -- Catamarans heeled over, racers hanging over the water,
text: dangerously suspended in trapeze harnesses.
text: -- Skippers' faces, concentrating on boat handling.
scene_heading: AERIAL VIEW - SAILBOATS
text: It's the chopper's point of view, as the Harbor Patrol copter
text: from the Cape flies towards the Kids, following Brody's
text: previous instructions. He sees the sailboats and fly that
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: (filtered, into his
dialog: mike)
dialog: Air Patrol to Base. I have visual
dialog: contact on the Kids. Going down to
dialog: use the loud hailer...
text: LOOKING UP AT THE APPROACHING COPTER
text: It approaches the sailboats, losing altitude fast, rotor
text: blades chuffing up a storm.
text: The Pilot has his microphone to his lips, and his voice is
text: blaring down at them.
speaker_heading: PILOT (V.O.)
dialog: This is the Harbor Patrol. Return to
dialog: port immediately. Return -- to --
dialog: port -- immediately.
speaker_heading: THE BOATS
text: The Kids look at each other, some coming about awkwardly,
text: others luffing, wondering what this is all about.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: (to Mike)
dialog: Your dad must be really pissed.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: We better go back in.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: It's not going to be easy.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: We're fighting wind and current. I
dialog: though we'd be out longer, catch the
text: incoming tide.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Putz -- that won't be for hours.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I was counting on hours.
speaker_heading: CHOPPER (V.O.)
dialog: Return -- to -- port.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: We're trying, we're trying.
text: He waves acknowledgement, and puts about. The others take
text: their cue from him, and set a rough course back, but without
dialog: much success.
scene_heading: PATRICK AND LUCY
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Heading back?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Might as well.
text: ANGLE ON THE THREE SLOOPS
text: Polo, Timmy and Brooke, Marge and Sean. They see the faster
text: catamarans come about and try to beat back.
speaker_heading: POLO
text: They're turning around.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Coming about, then.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Are we going back?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Going to try. Lighthouse, everybody...
text: She puts about, the three of them start back towards the
text: lighthouse, not making much headway. Doug's inflatable is
text: the slowest, and he is now, by virtue of his position, at
text: the head of the line beating back towards the island.
speaker_heading: DOUG'S BOAT
dialog: The others in the b.g.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Make way for the Carrier Enterprise!
scene_heading: INSERT - A WEAK PATCH IN THE RUBBER
text: It whistles and visibly leaks under the strain.
speaker_heading: DOUG
text: looking down in dismay.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Make that the Titanic.
text: He rigs a little foot pump, and begins thumping away, trying
text: to breath air back into the raft.
scene_heading: INT. CHOPPER - LOOKING DOWN AT THE SAILBOATS
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Patrol One to Base. Looks like they're
text: turning back.
speaker_heading: CONTROL
dialog: All right, Patrol. Go back to work.
dialog: You've wasted enough time.
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER
text: Looking up at the scattered hulls of the sailboats, the
text: turbulence from the low-flying chopper making a vast circular

text: LOOKING UP AT THE CHOPPER
text: It wheels around, and heads back towards land.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: ABOARD THE AMITY POLICE BOAT - DAY
text: Rushing through the seas under full power. About three hundred

text: Sandpiper. Further off, a day-sailing power cruiser, sport
dialog: fishing.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Michael?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: It's not his boat.
text: Hendricks maneuvers closer, slowing the engine, reversing in
text: time to bring them alongside with a gentle bump. Ellen watches
text: apprehensively as Brody drops into the little boat.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Be careful...
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: Anything?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: (on the Sandpiper)
dialog: Nope...
dialog: (he sees something)
dialog: Hold on...
text: Brody moves around on the deck of the Sandpiper, until he
text: discovers Tina, cowering in shock; a sudden revealing of a

speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Tina!
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: (a moan)
text: N-o-o-o-o-o-o...
speaker_heading: BRODY

speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: No! It's still there!
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: What is it? What's there?
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: It's still there!
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: (to Hendricks and
dialog: Ellen)
dialog: I need a hand here...
text: Hendricks has gotten a blanket, and he steps over, putting

dialog: girl.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Tina, baby... what is it?
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Sh... Sh... Shark...
text: ANGLE ON BRODY - FOLLOWING HIM AS HE REACTS
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: I knew it. I goddamn well told them.
text: He moves abruptly, stepping up onto the police launch,
text: snapping on the radio, leaving Hendricks, Ellen and Tina on
text: the sailboat moored alongside.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Amity Launch to Harbor Patrol.
speaker_heading: PATROL COMMANDER (V.O.)
dialog: (filter)
dialog: This is Cape Patrol -- what is it,
dialog: Brody? I heard you weren't chief
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Skip that. What about those kids out
dialog: sailing?
speaker_heading: COMMANDER (V.O.)
dialog: It's all okay -- Colby got to them.
dialog: They were turning back when he left
dialog: 'em.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: He left them?
speaker_heading: COMMANDER (V.O.)
dialog: Sure. He's got work to do in Bay
dialog: Channel.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Get him the hell back there! We got
dialog: possible fatalities! Brody out...
text: His eyes wild, Brody looks over at the Sandpiper, then scans
text: the nearby waters with sudden tension.
text: BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW
text: Ellen and Hendricks comforting Tina on the Sandpiper. Nearby,
text: a big cabin cruiser casually trolling by. Brody pulls the
text: police boat's air horn, the cruiser's passengers look over,
text: Hendricks and Ellen jump at the unexpected blast.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON BRODY
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: I'm going out there.
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: Hey -- you can't do that.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: What is it? What's the matter?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Mike's out there.
text: Brody starts the launch's motor, throwing clear the mooring
text: line that ties the two boats together.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: (to Hendricks)
dialog: Get her in. Get them both in.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Martin, please!
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: Chief, be sensible...
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Where are they?
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: About 10 degrees off your starboard
text: bow, take a heading leeward of Sand
dialog: Island, and lay her north by
dialog: northeast...
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Never mind that shit. Just point.
text: Hendricks complies.
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: See where Cable Junction is? Look to
dialog: the left. The lighthouse. That's it.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Got it.
text: And he kicks the engine into gear, moving the launch away
text: and out toward the sea.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Come back! Martin!
text: He guns the engine as soon as he's clear. Hendricks gives
text: his jacket to a suddenly chilled Ellen, and hails the cabin
text: cruiser, already changing course to pick them up, sounding
text: its horn.
text: Ellen stares after the receding boat.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: My purse is on that boat.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - DAY - THE KID'S SAILBOATS
text: They are trying to beat back towards the lighthouse, fighting

dialog: motor, is making any headway.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON DOUG
text: playing at being Charles Laughton.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Mr. Christian! Mr. Christian! Pump
dialog: up this boat! And shave that silly
dialog: moustache!
text: Pumping, steering, he's floundering along.
scene_heading: UNDERWATER - MOVING TOWARDS THE SURFACE
text: The Shark has fixated on something -- one outlying shape,
text: the easily identifiable outline of Doug's inflatable, thumping
text: and putting. It homes in on the sound.
text: ANGLE ON DOUG AND THE KIDS
text: The other kids exchange banter with Doug in his raft, as he
dialog: clowns for their benefit.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: England expects every man to do his
dialog: duty... You may fire when ready,
dialog: Gridley... Damn the torpedoes, full
dialog: speed ahead...
text: Despite his pumping, the bulging patch bursts with a loud
dialog: bang.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Oh, shit.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Someone pop your balloon?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: No problem, no problem.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Want a lifesaver?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: How about a skyhook?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: You sail your boat, I'll sail mine.
text: A fin rises partially, almost invisible to most of the kids,
text: but Mike notices it, believing it to be a porpoise.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Hey, Fetterman -- You got company.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Company? The place is a mess...
text: Before anyone can react, the shape rises behind Doug, striking
text: his raft a terrible blow.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Whoops.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: THE OTHERS, WATCHING
text: Not making any headway themselves, they casually watch the
text: class clown, wondering what he's up to this time.
speaker_heading: DOUG'S BOAT
text: a distance from the rest. It shakes, then blows up as big
text: teeth grip it from below. Doug goes flying into the drink.
text: The Shark has the inflatable in his teeth, and is shaking it
text: from side to side. Doug's eyes bug out as he sees what's
text: going on. He begins treading water, backing away as fast as
text: he can, waving his arm in the air frantically -- "pick me
dialog: up, quick..."
speaker_heading: MIKE'S BOAT
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Doug's down!
text: He sails to where Doug is being carried along by the current.
text: The inflatable is a mess -- shredded rubber and dead engine;
dialog: the Shark didn't like it.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Doug! This way!
text: Doug carefully -- oh, so carefully -- strokes over to where
text: Mike and Andy can pull him abroad. Some of the others sail
text: closer to get a look.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: What was that about?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: What was that?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: So much for the rubber duck.
scene_heading: THE GROUP, DRIFTING TOGETHER
dialog: This incident hasn't yet touched them -- no one actually saw
dialog: what it was, except Doug, who's never been serious about
dialog: anything. Until now.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: A shark ate my boat.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Come on.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I'm telling you, a goddamn shark ate
dialog: my goddamn boat!
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: If he liked your boat, I got some
dialog: sneakers he'll love.
text: There's nervous laughter from all around as they examine the
text: remains of Doug's inflatable. Some of those jagged rents
dialog: could be made by teeth...
speaker_heading: KIDS
dialog: (ad lib)
dialog: ...Jeez -- what did that?... A
dialog: porpoise, maybe...Nah, killer whale...
dialog: I think he snagged it... I hate to
dialog: pop his balloon... (Etc.)
text: ANGLE ON MIKE'S BOAT
text: Doug's inflatable is draped over the tip of one hull, forward.

scene_heading: CLOSE ON MIKE
text: His head bangs on a metal fitting as the boat turns over.
speaker_heading: ON THE GROUP

speaker_heading: CONFUSION
dialog: As the following events take place:

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Raft up! Raft 'em up!

text: Doughdish towards them, tying it off as it comes close.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Tie off to your strongest point.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Anyone need an extra line?
text: Polo has Mike and Timmy aboard his boat. Timmy is looking

speaker_heading: TIMMY
dialog: Mike's bleeding!
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Can you sail?
speaker_heading: POLO
dialog: (testing his rudder)
dialog: Yeah! We'll take him in!
text: He starts to make sail back towards the lighthouse, on a

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
speaker_heading: THE RAFTED BOATS

speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Help!
text: He and Marge topple into the water.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Don't struggle!
text: Sean is bobbing in his life-vest, Marge strokes to be near
dialog: him.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON MARGE AND SEAN
text: in the water, swimming for the apparent safety of the raft.
text: Then, the fin, and the massive bulk of the killer, heaving

speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Sean!
text: She heaves him up out of the water, hurling him with
text: desperation towards the safety of the floating hull.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON SEAN
text: screaming, hands and feet scrabbling like a monkey as he

speaker_heading: THE SHARK

dialog: gone.
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER

speaker_heading: COPTER WRECKAGE
text: Huddled in the cracked plastic bubble, the Pilot is sucking

speaker_heading: MARGE
text: As the Pilot overtakes her -- a moment of horror, as she
text: thinks the Shark has found her, then relief, as the Pilot
text: motions to the bubble, and indicates "Air." She follows him.
scene_heading: MARGE AND THE PILOT
text: Scuttling like two crabs into the shelter of the broken

text: The chopper tilts, and moves, breaking up on the bottom as

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Andy! Please help! Help!
scene_heading: ON THE SURFACE - A DISTANCE AWAY
text: Copter wreckage is bubbling up from underneath, like a
text: submarine destroyed by depth charges; an oil slick, pieces
text: of broken blade, a seat cushion, then, suddenly, the Pilot,
text: and Marge, almost choked to death, their air run out. They
text: cling to a section of pontoon, panting, looking around with

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: BRODY - ALONE IN THE POLICE BOAT - DAY

speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Harbor Air, this is Brody. Air One,
dialog: come in.
text: Static, no answer. He tries a couple of times, checking the

speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Harbor Air, do you read? Over?
speaker_heading: PATROL VOICE
dialog: Brody? This is Patrol Base.
text: The familiar voice is tinged with annoyance. He's had a long

speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Where the hell is Air One?
speaker_heading: PATROL VOICE
dialog: That's what I'd like to know. Lost

speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Did he raise the Kids?
speaker_heading: PATROL VOICE
dialog: Last transmission said ten juveniles.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Yeah? Then what?
speaker_heading: PATROL VOICE
dialog: Then nothing. If you see him, tell
dialog: him to switch to an operational
dialog: frequency, or give me a status report
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Did you say Cable Junction?
speaker_heading: PATROL VOICE
dialog: That's what he said.
speaker_heading: BRODY

scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - DAY - THE RAFT
text: Sean is crying on his isolated perch, clinging to the upturned

speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Sean! Catch the rope!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: The rope! The rope!
text: The others shoot fearful glances at the waters.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: He's got to help or it won't work.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Sean, baby, please...
text: Sean is ignoring the efforts to rescue him, paralyzed by

text: Brooke and Doug trying to soothe her.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: It killed her. It ate her.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Shh. Shhh...
speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Sean! Listen! Listen to me, Sean.

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Listen to Andy, Sean.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: We're throwing a rope and you better
dialog: catch it, hear?
text: Sean nods. The other Kids are encouraged. The rope is thrown --

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: (to Bob)
dialog: Keep an eye out for that fish.
text: Bob climbs to a vantage point, watching.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Throw it.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Sean! Catch it!
text: Another miss. In his haste to help, Larry overreaches to

text: into the sea. Shrieks of fright from the others.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Larry!
text: He scrambles out, hardly wet, that's how fast he's moving.
text: Finally -- Patrick takes the crucial throw, and the rope
text: practically knocks Sean off his perch, but he clutches and
text: holds it. As Andy carefully calls instructions, Sean secures
text: the rope and the others carefully, carefully begin to pull
dialog: him in.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - ON SEAN
text: as they pull. The slippery rope is undoing itself.
speaker_heading: THE RAFT
text: With the kids reaching out hands, sticks, rope, anything to

speaker_heading: QUICK CUTS
text: -- Hands gripping rope.
text: -- The knot, pulling apart.
text: -- Anguished faces, concentrating, as Patrick, Lucy, Larry,
text: and Andy struggle to bring him in.
speaker_heading: ANDY AND SEAN
text: Success. He's pulled to safety. They lash his little hull as

speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Can we make it?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I don't know.
scene_heading: BOB'S POINT OF VIEW

speaker_heading: THE RAFT
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (to Jackie)

speaker_heading: BROOKE

dialog: Keep her warm.
dialog: (to Jackie)
dialog: Jackie? Baby?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Can someone help me rig a jury rudder?
dialog: We might steer this...
text: Andy joins him, and they try to make a sweep or a rudder out
dialog: of whatever wreckage they can use.
speaker_heading: DOUG
text: By 7:46, when the tide turns around,

speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: We're hung up here. Snagged.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Can you get us a line?

speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: We got it!
speaker_heading: PATRICK

speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Come around again!
scene_heading: ANGLE ON BRODY'S BOAT

speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Dad! Help!
text: Brody starts to pull the raft again, when:
speaker_heading: THE SHARK

text: snapping it.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON BRODY'S BOAT
text: Brody recoils in horror as the beast rushes past, he spins

scene_heading: INSIDE THE BOAT
text: as it tips up on the rocks. Brody falls, equipment and loose

scene_heading: INSERT - THE RADIO

speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Can you get a line to me?
scene_heading: ABOARD THE RAFT

scene_heading: CABLE JUNCTION - THE RAFT
text: Brady catches the Kids' line. He heaves on it with all his

text: into the water. The raft doesn't budge.
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER
text: the mast bends under the strain, but holds the raft stuck

scene_heading: CABLE JUNCTION - BRODY AND THE KIDS

text: The Kids haul their line, trying to bring the steel cable to
dialog: them.
text: The shark rams their raft, impatient now. Screams and
text: scrambling as they let go their line and try to avoid the

speaker_heading: THE KIDS
speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: BRODY

dialog: Pull!
speaker_heading: THE RAFT
text: bursts apart from the center as the Shark lunges up through

speaker_heading: BRODY

scene_heading: BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - SEAN
text: Alone on the raft, Brooke and Jackie helpless nearby, the

scene_heading: ANGLE ON LUCY AND BOB

speaker_heading: LUCY

speaker_heading: CABLE JUNCTION
text: Silhouetted against the evening sky. Automatic timers are

scene_heading: ANGLE ON ANDY

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Where are you? Chief!
text: His light pokes and sweeps through the gloom.
text: BRODY IN THE WATER
text: He hears the horrendous sounds of wood and metal breaking,

speaker_heading: THE SHARK

speaker_heading: BRODY

speaker_heading: THE SHARK

speaker_heading: BRODY
text: Possessed, yelling at the top of his lungs.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Come and get me! Come and get me!
speaker_heading: THE SHARK
text: Attacking. Missing Brody, who hauls himself up out of the
text: way in life-or-death spasm. The great jaws close, fastening
text: onto the thick cable. Shaking it. The cable resists for a
text: moment, then splits, layers or insulation and armor crack
text: open, the jaws clamp harder -- 20,000 tons of pressure --
text: then the live copper core is reached. Zap!
speaker_heading: THE SHARK
text: dying. Leaping and convulsing as hundreds of thousands of

speaker_heading: BRODY
text: watching, cowering on the rubber raft to which he fell when
