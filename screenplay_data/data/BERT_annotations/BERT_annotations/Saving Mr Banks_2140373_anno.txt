speaker_heading: OVER BLACK:
text: MUSIC - string violins treat us to a familiar song opening
text: and then a voice - male.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS (V.O.)
speaker_heading: (SINGING)
dialog: Winds in the East
dialog: Mist coming in--
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: A whoosh of wind spins us around in a blue sky, spinning,
text: spinning until we slow to a stop and find ourselves amongst
text: white fluffy clouds. A shadow (oddly shaped like an umbrella)
text: dances amongst the nimbus.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS (V.O.)
dialog: --Like something is brewing,
dialog: about to begin--
text: The shadow's direction becomes purposeful - taking us down
text: through the clouds, whipping us on the wind towards a small
text: town in the distance.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS (V.O.)
dialog: --Can't put me finger on what lies
scene_heading: IN STORE--
text: Downwards and downwards until it skittishly circles a large,
text: bustling park and then swoops us into the lavish gardens.
text: There, a ten-year-old girl plays in the lush grass; she puts
text: the finishing touches to a miniature version of the large
text: park she sits in - benches made from twigs, trees from
text: flowers, picnic cups from acorns - and gives a satisfied nod.
text: She wraps her arms tightly around her chest, lifts her face
text: to the sky, a half-smile threatening to break across her
dialog: concentrated face. This is the young P.L. TRAVERS (whom we
dialog: will also know as GINTY.)
speaker_heading: TRAVERS (V.O.)
dialog: --But I feel what's to happen, all
scene_heading: HAPPENED BEFORE--
text: Her little brow is furrowed with imagination and then, all of
text: a sudden, the smile breaks free as something in her mind
text: becomes real.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SHAWFIELD ST - PAMELA'S OFFICE - LONDON - MORNING (1961)
text: P.L. TRAVERS sits in her rocking chair (in the same position
text: as above) arms clasped tightly around her body, face to the
text: sky. Older, beautiful; striking blue eyes aid her air of
text: stiff and steely determination.
text: Her office is a canvas of a life well travelled. Buddha
text: smiles from every corner, framed poetry and letters adorn the
text: walls alongside pictures of Pamela throughout the years with
dialog: men we will not come to know and everywhere, china hens sit
text: on shelves, their wings clasped to their chests, brooding.
text: Despite the multitude of objects, the room is peaceful,
dialog: white.
text: Downstairs the doorbell rings.
text: Pamela closes her eyes, breathes.
text: It rings again, Pamela shakes her head, tuts. She stands up,
text: smooths down her skirt with flat palms. Breathes.
scene_heading: INT. SHAWFIELD ST - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - MORNING
text: Pamela opens the front door and squints as a flood of
text: sunlight and cherry blossom petals float over the threshold.
text: DIARMUID RUSSELL (45) - bright, youthful - waits to be asked
text: inside. Pamela is not pleased to see him.
speaker_heading: DIARMUID
dialog: Mrs Travers.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PAMELA'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING
text: Pamela and Diarmuid sit in silence. Diarmuid looks at her,
text: she looks out of the window.
speaker_heading: DIARMUID PAMELA
dialog: You're ready to--? Like pink clouds on sticks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIARMUID
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: PAMELA
text: The cherry blossoms
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I was trying to think of what they--
text: Diarmuid looks at his watch.
speaker_heading: DIARMUID
dialog: The car should be here, may I use--
speaker_heading: (THE PHONE)
speaker_heading: PAMELA
speaker_heading: (OVER)
dialog: I cancelled it.
speaker_heading: DIARMUID
dialog: You--?
speaker_heading: (PANICKED)
dialog: What? Pamela!
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Mrs Travers.
speaker_heading: DIARMUID
dialog: Mrs Travers, please, why--
dialog: (sugaring his tone)
dialog: Why would you cancel the car?
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: I shan't be going.
text: Diarmuid buries his face in his hands.
speaker_heading: DIARMUID
dialog: We've been through this--
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: I've changed my mind.
speaker_heading: DIARMUID
dialog: You can't.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: With all due respect Mr Russell I
dialog: am on very good terms with my own
text: faculty and exceedingly confident
dialog: in its decision making
dialog: capabilities.
text: Diarmuid's shoulders visibly sag, he lets out a long
text: frustrated breath.
speaker_heading: DIARMUID
dialog: You made an agreement. Do you
dialog: understand? A verbal agreement.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Why in the world are you speaking
dialog: to me as if I am a neonate?
speaker_heading: DIARMUID
speaker_heading: HE'LL--
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: He'll what? Sue? He is most welcome
dialog: to every penny I don't have.
speaker_heading: DIARMUID
speaker_heading: LOOK--
speaker_heading: (HE SIGHS)
dialog: --I've represented you for a long
dialog: time. I like to think of you as a
speaker_heading: FRIEND--
text: Pamela snorts.
speaker_heading: DIARMUID (CONT'D)
dialog: I like to think of it, believe me I
dialog: know it's not reciprocated.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I would never suggest you do
dialog: something that would cause you
dialog: anguish but there's no more money
dialog: Pamela-- Mrs Travers. Simply no
dialog: more. Sales have dried up, no more
dialog: royalties. You refuse to write
dialog: further books so--
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Do you understand? I'm frightened
dialog: that you don't understand what that
dialog: means.
text: Pamela looks out of the window, the cherry blossom her focus.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: I know what he's going to do to her-
dialog: - she'll be cavorting and
text: twinkling! Careening towards a
text: happy ending like a kamikaze--
speaker_heading: DIARMUID
dialog: --We've been trying to do this deal
dialog: for twenty years! He's agreed to
dialog: both your stipulations. No
dialog: animation, script approval-- I--
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Use her to pay my bills? If I
dialog: believed in a hell I'd be sitting
dialog: in its waiting room--
speaker_heading: DIARMUID
speaker_heading: (OVER)
dialog: --script approval! He's never
dialog: granted anything like that before!
dialog: I don't know what else to--
text: He looks around.
speaker_heading: DIARMUID (CONT'D)
dialog: Where is Polly?
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: I fired her.
text: Diarmuid shakes his head, sighs.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: It's just as well. It seems I can't
dialog: afford her anymore anyway!
text: Pamela looks to the ceiling, breathes.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (MOMENTARILY SOFT)
dialog: You don't know how much she means
dialog: to me.
speaker_heading: DIARMUID
dialog: Polly?
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Of course not Polly!
text: Pamela huffs, digs her heel into the rug.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: (it's a filthy word)
dialog: Los Angeles.
speaker_heading: DIARMUID
dialog: You have only to go there and work
dialog: for two weeks. Collaborate. That's
dialog: it. You haven't signed the rights
dialog: over, yet.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Yet!
speaker_heading: DIARMUID
dialog: You must make it work Mrs Travers--
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Oh I must, must I?
speaker_heading: DIARMUID
dialog: You need the money. I don't want
dialog: you to see you-- (broke).
speaker_heading: PAMELA
speaker_heading: (OVER)
dialog: Stop saying money! It's a filthy,
dialog: disgusting word!
speaker_heading: DIARMUID
dialog: I am picking up the telephone Mrs
speaker_heading: TRAVERS--
text: Diarmuid gets up.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: I have final say?
speaker_heading: DIARMUID
dialog: You do.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
speaker_heading: (TO HERSELF)
dialog: I have final say.
speaker_heading: (TO DIARMUID)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: And if I don't like what they are
dialog: doing to her?
speaker_heading: DIARMUID
dialog: You don't sign the papers. He
dialog: cannot make the film unless you
dialog: grant the rights.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: It's an exploratory trip--
text: Pamela looks at the cherry blossom again, a piece floats away
text: from the tree and sticks to her living room window.
speaker_heading: DIARMUID (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you say?
speaker_heading: PAMELA
speaker_heading: (TO HERSELF)
dialog: I want to keep my house.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MARYBOROUGH PARK - DAY
text: A large hand taps Ginty on the shoulder, she looks up and
text: smiles. TRAVERS GOFF (35) is handsome and rugged, a wild
text: poetic look, like Ted Hughes or Dylan Thomas.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS
dialog: Excuse me ma'am, have you seen my
dialog: daughter? I was quite sure I had
dialog: left her around here somewhere!
text: Ginty giggles.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS (CONT'D)
dialog: Her name is Helen, no, Shirley, erm-

dialog: Could it be Prunella?
speaker_heading: GINTY
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: TRAVERS
dialog: Pamela?
speaker_heading: GINTY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS
dialog: You're right still doesn't sound
dialog: quite-- I'm sure I have a special
dialog: name for her--
speaker_heading: GINTY
dialog: Ginty!
speaker_heading: TRAVERS
dialog: Why, thank you ma'am! Ginty it is
dialog: of course!
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Now, have you seen her?
speaker_heading: GINTY
dialog: It's me!
text: Travers puts his nose right up to hers, peering into her
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS
dialog: Gosh! So it is! Well, thank
dialog: goodness for that! I was positive I
dialog: was going to be beheaded for losing
dialog: Her Highness The Royal Princess
dialog: Ginty Mc Featherfluffy!
speaker_heading: GINTY
dialog: You can't lose me!
speaker_heading: TRAVERS
dialog: Never. I promise. I will never lose
dialog: you!
text: He swings her up onto his shoulders and gallops off through
text: the park, neighing like a horse.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS (CONT'D)
dialog: Hurry now! We mustn't be late! The
dialog: adventure is about to begin!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PLANE - DAY
text: Pamela is hot and bothered trying to wrestle a bulging carpet
text: bag into an overhead locker.
scene_heading: FLIGHT ATTENDANT
dialog: Can I help you?
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: I'm perfectly capable thank you.
text: The flight attendant tries to help anyway.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: They've used all the space; so
dialog: greedy.
text: She glares at the people around her.
scene_heading: FLIGHT ATTENDANT
dialog: I'll take it Madam. I can put it
dialog: up here -
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: I don't want it up there. I want it
dialog: here, in the corresponding holding
dialog: area for my assigned seat!
scene_heading: FLIGHT ATTENDANT
text: The flight's closing in just a few
dialog: moments Ma'am. I'll have to take
dialog: it.
text: Pamela narrows her eyes at the attendant as if to say `I dare
text: you.' A woman, with an infant, stands up.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
speaker_heading: (TO ATTENDANT)
dialog: You can put my bag up front
dialog: instead.
text: The flight attendant smiles thankfully and replaces the
text: woman's bag with Pamela's.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
speaker_heading: (TO WOMAN)
dialog: Will the child be a nuisance? It's
text: an eleven hour flight.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
speaker_heading: (TAKEN ABACK)
dialog: Er-- no, I--
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Jolly good.
text: Pamela gives her a watery smile and takes the seat next to
text: the window, she looks out at the tarmac.
text: She closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, opens her eyes
text: again and tucks her feet tidily together. She folds her hands
text: neatly into her lap and looks straight ahead.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO HERSELF)
dialog: I hope we crash.
text: The passenger across the aisle hears her, horrified!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GOFF RESIDENCE - MARYBOROUGH - DAY (1906)
text: BIDDY (3) and MARGARET - the girls mother, delicate, weak -
text: stand outside of their lavish red-bricked home. Suitcases
text: bulge at their feet. Margaret breathes a sigh of relief as
text: she sees Travers hurrying towards them, he swings Ginty from
text: his shoulders and plops her on the ground.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: The carriage?
speaker_heading: TRAVERS
dialog: Who needs a carriage my love? A
dialog: stroll is a gift!
dialog: (beat, excited)
dialog: Everybody ready?
scene_heading: GINTY &amp; BIDDY
dialog: Yes. Yep!
text: Margaret takes her youngest child MOYA (1) from the nanny.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS
dialog: Come along my team! We mustn't miss
dialog: the train.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (to her staff)
dialog: Thank you so much. For everything.
speaker_heading: GINTY
speaker_heading: (TO NANNY)
dialog: See you soon Katie Nanna!
text: She picks up her own case; Katie Nanna turns away,
text: heartbroken.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS
dialog: Walking bus!
text: The family get into line, one behind the other, Travers in
dialog: the lead.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't forget Andrew!
text: Ginty takes Andrew's leash, her own case and somehow helps
dialog: her sister too.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS (CONT'D)
dialog: Ready? And off we go!
text: Passersby tut and shake their heads at the noisy display as
text: Travers and the girls march down the street.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS (CONT'D)
dialog: Left, right, left, right! Coming
dialog: through!
text: Margaret stays for a beat, longingly taking in and storing a
text: picture of the home she leaves behind.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN MARYBOROUGH - DAY
text: The procession continues into the bustling downtown.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY
text: It's hectic as tickets are purchased and a CLERK marks a
text: chalkboard with destinations and mileage. Ginty stops, looks
dialog: at the list. The last city is--
speaker_heading: GINTY
speaker_heading: ALLORA--
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
text: The Great Western Queensland train chugs its way Westward
text: from the verdant green of Maryborough toward the brown cake
dialog: of Allora.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ANGLE ON MARYBOROUGH - DAY
text: As it disappears. Ginty stands on the last train platform,
text: watching her home, her past, fade into the distance.
text: Ginty's face speaks resignation as it, and the train, recede
text: as billowing white smoke and dust fill the frame.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PLANE - DAY
text: Pamela jolts in her seat, her eyes flit open. She's disturbed
text: by her dreams, she flicks her hand in front of her face as if
text: somehow batting the memories away. She sighs loudly and digs
text: her heel into the carpet of the plane.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LAX - ARRIVALS - DAY
text: A bleary eyed Pamela carries her two bags into the arrivals
text: area. She's immediately hit by dazzling sunlight and a sea of
text: signs bearing the names of various passengers and companies:
text: she scans Paramount, Warner Brothers, MGM, finally falling
text: upon her own name - P.L. Travers - underneath "Walt Disney
dialog: Presents".
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Oh does he indeed?
text: She approaches the uniformed driver (RALPH - Mickey Mouse on
text: his lapel) who bursts into a beaming smile.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Travers? P.L. Travers?
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Mrs.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Welcome, Mrs P.L. Travers! Welcome
dialog: to the City of Angels.
text: Pamela sneers. He grabs her bags.
speaker_heading: RALPH (CONT'D)
dialog: Let me take those.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: I'm perfectly capable of-- Oh,
dialog: nevermind.
text: Ralph ushers Pamela through the doors--
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LAX - DAY
text: --and into the sunlight.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Sun came out to say hello just to
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Don't be preposterous.
text: Pamela sniffs the air.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: It smells. Like--
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Jasmine.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: --chlorine and sweat.
text: Ralph chuckles.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: It's dreadful.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LIMOSINE - DAY
text: The shiny black, tinted windowed limo cruises up La Cienega
text: Blvd, passing all kinds of monstrous architecture and garish
text: billboard advertising.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIMOSINE - DAY
text: Pamela is diminutive on the back seat of the sprawling car.
text: She eyes the champagne on ice, the flutes clinking in the in-
dialog: car bar.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
speaker_heading: (TO HERSELF)
dialog: Absurd.
text: Ralph looks at her in the rearview.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: You okay back there Mrs P.L.
dialog: Travers?
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: It's not Mrs P.L. It's just Mrs--
dialog: Oh, it's so hot.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: No problemo! We got a brand new air
dialog: conditioning system, Missus; cool
dialog: you right down in no time. Just
dialog: about make you feel like you're in
dialog: good old Engerland again! Things
dialog: they can put in cars these days--
text: (he shakes his head in
speaker_heading: AMAZEMENT)
dialog: Gosh almighty.
text: Pamela presses her fingers to her temples. She looks around,
text: finds a button, pushes it and the screen rises between
text: passenger and driver miraculously relieving her of Ralph's
dialog: natter.
speaker_heading: RALPH (CONT'D)
dialog: (happy as a clam)
dialog: No problemo.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY
text: With its pink facade and flag flying turrets the hotel
text: resembles a candy castle simmering under a midday sun.
text: The limo glides into the forecourt.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY
text: A porter opens the door to Pamela's suite and places her
text: belongings on a luggage stand in the hallway.
speaker_heading: PORTER
dialog: Would you like me to unpack for you
dialog: ma'am?
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Unpack?
speaker_heading: PORTER
dialog: To take your items from their cases
dialog: and hang them in the wardrobe
dialog: ma'am.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Young man, if it is your wish to
dialog: handle ladies garments I suggest
dialog: you take employment in a
dialog: launderette.
text: The porter has no idea what to say, he hovers at the door.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes?
text: His eyes flick to his empty palm and back to Pamela. She
text: closes the door on him.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: Odd.
text: She turns and for the first time takes in--
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my.
text: --The LUDICROUS suite she has been assigned; it is opulent
dialog: beyond imagine but it's classy decor has been rather
text: diminished by the array of Disney gifts splattered across
text: every surface of the room.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh no, no, no.
dialog: Disney Flowers, Disney champagne, Disney exotic fruit
text: baskets, Disney chocolates, Disney posters, cuddly Donald,
text: Pluto and Minnie toys and - taking up the entire bed - the
text: BIGGEST stuffed Mickey Mouse imaginable. Imagine it. Nope.
speaker_heading: BIGGER!
text: Pamela cannot contain her horror. She stares at it in disgust
text: for a moment, and then her eyes fall upon three pears in the
text: fruit basket. She stops still for a second before rushing
text: over and picking them out. She turns them over in her hands
text: before an enormous wave of panic washes over her.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: (muttering to the pears)
dialog: This won't do.
text: She throws open the balcony doors for fresh air and is
text: greeted with dry arid heat, dust, dazzling sunlight--
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - DAY
text: --Arid heat, dazzling sunlight. Travers, Margaret and the
text: children climb stand in a line at the top of a pathway. From
text: their perspective all there is to see is a cloud of swirling
text: red dust; it obscures and then gradually reveals her new
text: home. The surrounding land yellow and burnt - unlike the lush
text: greens of Maryborough. The house is ramshackle and meagre.
text: A swayback white nag wanders near a solitary tree and a few
text: skinny chickens strut about the porch.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS
dialog: A palace! Complete with mighty
text: steed.
speaker_heading: GINTY
dialog: And chickens.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: OH--
text: Travers puts an arm around her shoulder.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS
dialog: We'll build beautiful memories here
dialog: my angel.
text: Margaret offers him a trusting smile.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yes.
text: Travers takes Ginty and Biddy's hands and they run towards
text: their new home. The chickens scatter.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS
dialog: (in the distance)
dialog: --in this house you get to share a
dialog: bedroom!
text: Margaret looks at the surrounding area, there's simply
text: nothing but barren land and red dust for miles.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - POOL - DAY
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER
text: SPLOSH! A green bomb disturbs the tranquil surface and then
dialog: another SPLOSH!
text: We rise through the water to see Pamela on her balcony
text: throwing the pears, one by one, into the swimmer-free
dialog: swimming pool.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - SUITE - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Good riddance.
text: She breathes a sigh of relief and closes the balcony doors.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO HERSELF)
dialog: Well, first things first.
text: She gathers up the Disney paraphernalia and shoves it all in
text: a closet.
text: She picks up her bags and goes through to the bedroom where
text: the BIGGEST stuffed Mickey Mouse imaginable takes up the
dialog: entire bed. Imagine it. Nope. BIGGER!
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: Good Lord.
text: Pamela drops her bags, grabs Mickey and places him on the
text: floor, facing the wall.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO MICKEY)
dialog: And you can stay there until you
dialog: learn the art of subtlety.
text: Pamela opens her carpetbag and begins to unpack. She takes
text: from it a bottle of pills, which she places on her night
text: stand, followed by another bottle and another and another.
text: The potions keep coming, as do creams and books and make-up,
text: the bag is endless. Things, things and more things come
text: streaming out of it and once the night stand is full she uses
text: windowsills and any other available surface for her miniature
text: Buddhas. Finally she takes out an impossibly large framed
text: picture of herself. She holds it up, admires it, takes down
text: an existing painting and replaces it with her own image.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: There.
text: Pamela is restless, she looks around the room, stands in
text: front of a full length mirror, admiring herself. She turns
text: her face slightly to catch it at its best angle. She leans
text: forward and explores the contours of her face, surprisingly
text: unlined for a woman of her years. She smiles, full of vanity.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (SATISFIED)
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (answering an imaginary
speaker_heading: QUESTION)
dialog: Well, no, I don't suppose I do
dialog: mind.
text: She laughs, but Pamela finds joy difficult so it comes out as
text: an ugly snort.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, really! Flatterer!
dialog: (then scolding herself)
dialog: Silly girl.
text: She turns her attention away from the mirror and picks up a
text: remote control staring at it with bemusement. She points it
text: at the television hitting random buttons until suddenly the
text: TV bursts into life.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh!
text: She clicks again, the TV goes off, again and it's on. A
text: housewife advertises dish soap with glee, as if dish soap is
dialog: the greatest thing ever invented.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: Soap for the brains.
text: She changes the channel and stares blankly at a man on a
text: black and white screen. It takes a moment before she realizes
text: that staring back at her is the charming, moustached, kindly
text: face of WALTER ELIAS DISNEY (58) on The Wonderful World of
text: Disney Show. Pamela raises an eyebrow--
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, well-- There you are.
speaker_heading: CU: TV SCREEN
text: Walt is ringing a little bell but no sound comes out.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Don't worry! There's nothing wrong
dialog: with your television set. This is a
dialog: pixie bell, the sound is much too
text: high for human ears.
text: Tinkerbell flies into shot.
speaker_heading: WALT (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh there you are Tink!
text: She covers Walt in fairy dust.
speaker_heading: WALT (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: Hey! Get that stuff off of me!
speaker_heading: (TO AUDIENCE)
dialog: You know, a little sprinkling of
dialog: fairy dust can make you fly!
text: Pamela can't help but be drawn in for a tiny moment and then
text: just as quickly, narrows her mistrusting eyes at Walt and
text: switches him off.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Off! That's how we deal with you.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL
text: A tray of untouched dinner sits outside the door.
scene_heading: INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - NIGHT
text: Pamela lies in bed awake, staring at the ceiling, she shakes
text: her head - trying to free it of whatever is trapped in there.
text: The moonlight casts a shadow of Mickey on the wall beside her
dialog: bed.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - MORNING
text: Pamela waits under the hotel awning, dressed immaculately,
text: not a hair out of place. The limo pulls up to the curb and
text: Pamela groans as she sees Ralph jovially jump out of the car
text: and rush round to open the passenger door.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Good morning Mrs!
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: It's not Mrs, it's-- Oh, why do I
dialog: bother? We're just not going to get
dialog: it right are we?
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Hm?
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Will it be the same driver every
dialog: day?
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: (oblivious to her tone)
dialog: Yes ma'am! I'm all yours.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Sun came out again!
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: You say it like you're surprised.
dialog: Like the sun is particular about
dialog: whom it appears for. It seems you

speaker_heading: PAMELA

speaker_heading: RALPH)
dialog: I would so much rather be
dialog: accountable for the rain.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Oh, that's sad.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Sad is entirely the wrong emotion.
dialog: I shan't bother explaining why;
speaker_heading: IT'LL SIMPLY
dialog: (she makes gesture for
text: flying over his head)
dialog: Zip!
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Okey dokey.
speaker_heading: PAMELA

text: THREE MEN in suits wave at the limo as it drives through the

dialog: very twee forecourt.
scene_heading: They are: DON DAGRADI (45) and the SHERMAN BROTHERS, ROBERT
text: (34), he leans on an old worn cane and RICHARD (31), who has
text: a bright, sunny, almost cartoon-ish face.
text: Don opens the car door for Pamela and puts out a hand to help
text: her from the vehicle but she pushes it away.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Pamela! Good morning!
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: It is so discomfiting to hear a
dialog: perfect stranger use my first name.
dialog: Mrs Travers. Please.
text: The Sherman's look at each other. Uh oh.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: I do apologize, Mrs Travers.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I am Don DaGradi, the script

speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Co-script-writer. I shall certainly

speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Gradi. Wonderful! I welcome it.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: If indeed we ever sign off on a

text: Bob and Dick flash each other a look. What the fu ?
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Uh. Okay, so this is the rest of
dialog: your team, Dick and Bob Sherman!
dialog: Music and lyrics.
speaker_heading: (TO SHERMANS)
dialog: Boys, this is the one and only Mrs
dialog: P.L. Travers, creator of our
dialog: beloved Mary.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Poppins.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Who else?
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Mary Poppins. Never ever just Mary.
dialog: (to Dick and Bob)
dialog: A pleasure to meet you, though I
dialog: fear we shan't be acquainted for
dialog: too long.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: These books simply do not lend
text: themselves to chirping and
dialog: prancing. No. Certainly not a
dialog: musical. Now, where is Mister
dialog: Disney? I'd very much like to get
dialog: this started and finished as
text: briskly as is humanly possible.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Don?
speaker_heading: DICK PAMELA
dialog: Not a music--? If you'll point me in his
dialog: direction?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Uh-- erm. Ha! We had planned a
dialog: little tour of the studio for you
speaker_heading: MRS TRAVERS--
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: No thank you.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: --Wanted to show the place off.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: No one likes a show off.
text: Pamela takes herself off in the direction of a building.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Mrs Trav-- it's a long way to--
text: Don hurries behind her, Bob looks like he is about to murder
text: the woman and Dick is finding the whole thing incredibly
dialog: amusing.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY
text: The Shermans, Don and Pamela are riding through the studios
text: on a golf buggy.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: I am perfectly capable of walking.
text: A couple of Disney characters (Donald and Goofy) bounce up to
text: the golf cart, waving brightly. Goofy opens his arms to
text: Pamela for a hug and she recoils in horror.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: Shoo! Go away!
text: The characters stop bouncing and Di Gradi gives them a nod
dialog: meaning `beat it'.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
text: Ghastly.
text: Bob and Dick Sherman are in shock.
scene_heading: INT. DISNEY - EXTERIOR OFFICE - DAY
text: Don leads Pamela into the plushly appointed outer office,
text: where DOLLY - a young, perky secretary - smiles brightly at
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: DON
speaker_heading: (TO DOLLY)
dialog: Could you let--
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: (over, to Dolly)
dialog: Would you let Mister Disney know I
dialog: have arrived please?
text: Dolly loses her smile at the terse tone, nods curtly and
text: picks up the phone.
speaker_heading: DOLLY
dialog: (whispering into phone)
dialog: She's here!
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: A word of advice Mrs Travers, if I
dialog: may.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: You may. Whether I heed it or not
dialog: will be another matter entirely.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Wow. Uhm. It's just that he can't
dialog: stand being called Mr Disney. We
dialog: are all on a first name basis here.
speaker_heading: (TO DOLLY)
dialog: Dolly! Is he--?
text: We hear a man's cough before a beaming Walt Disney, in the
text: flesh, appears at the end of the corridor, his arms
text: outstretched.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Well, there ya are at last!
text: Pamela gets up, smooths down her skirt, and makes her way
text: serenely towards the man, who rushes down the corridor to
dialog: greet her.
speaker_heading: WALT (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my dear gal!
text: Pamela is open mouthed.
speaker_heading: WALT (CONT'D)
dialog: You can't imagine how excited I am
dialog: to finally meet you!
dialog: Pamela doesn't know what to do with this amount of
text: enthusiasm. She extends a formal hand before he manages to
text: get her in an embrace.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Oh!
text: He squeezes her tight and then lets go. Pamela struggles to
dialog: compose herself, she hasn't been that close to a man in
dialog: decades!
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: Hum-- ah. It's an honour, Mister
dialog: Disney.
text: Disney winces.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Walt, you gotta call me Walt, ya
dialog: know. `Mister Disney' was my old
dialog: man.
text: There's a hint of something mournful in the way he says `old
dialog: man.'
speaker_heading: WALT (CONT'D)
dialog: Come here! Come here!
text: He links his arm through hers, much to her chagrin, and leads
text: her into his interior office past an imposing floor to
text: ceiling cabinet bursting with Academy Awards.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DISNEY - INTERIOR OFFICE - DAY
text: He smiles at TOMMIE - who mans the second desk.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Tommie, say hi to the one and only
dialog: P L Travers!
speaker_heading: TOMMIE
dialog: Hi there! It's so nice to--
text: But Pamela has already been whisked through to Disney's
dialog: personal office.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DISNEY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Disney's office is tastefully furnished and filled with
text: pictures of his daughters and wife. Framed posters of his
text: films provide splashes of color to the cream walls.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Have a seat, sit down.
text: He gestures to a comfy couch in the corner but Pamela takes a
text: seat in front of Walt's desk instead, glancing at the sign
text: above it: We Can Make Them Live. Walt perches on the edge of
text: the desk, close to her, gazing at her.
speaker_heading: WALT (CONT'D)
dialog: Ya know, I can't believe it. P.L.
dialog: Travers, right here, in my office,
dialog: after all these years-- almost
dialog: twenty of `em.
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: Twenty. Long. Years.
text: Pamela narrows her eyes.
speaker_heading: WALT (CONT'D)
dialog: Wish ya coulda' seen me then Pam!
dialog: As lean as a whippet I was! A race
dialog: horse!
text: Interestingly, she doesn't pull him up on using her first
dialog: name and shortening it too!
speaker_heading: WALT (CONT'D)
dialog: But now, here you are. Look at you!
dialog: I could eat you up!
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: That wouldn't be appropriate.
text: He turns a photo of his daughters - Diane and Sharon - to
dialog: face Pamela.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: When Diane here was seven years old
dialog: I-- can I get you a drink? Coffee?
dialog: Soda?
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: A pot of tea would be most welc--
speaker_heading: WALT
speaker_heading: (OVER)
dialog: She was seven years old and I was
text: walking past her bedroom and there
text: she was on her bed reading to
dialog: Sharon, and well, they were just
dialog: giggling their little socks off!
text: (he picks up the phone,
dialog: presses a button)
dialog: Tommie, pot of tea please dear--
dialog: You're a doll.
dialog: (he puts the phone down)
dialog: She's a doll. Anyways I asked them
dialog: "Girls, what's so funny?" And Diane
dialog: said to me, "Mary Poppins daddy!"
dialog: Well, I had no idea what a Mary
dialog: Poppins was! And then she gave me
dialog: your book. And by gosh!
text: He stands up and throws his arms in the air to emphasise his
dialog: point.
speaker_heading: WALT (CONT'D)
dialog: My imagination was caught on fire!
dialog: And I mean ON FIRE! And those
dialog: embers have burned ever since-- as
dialog: you know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAMELA WALT
dialog: I do. Twenty years!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAMELA WALT
dialog: Yes. Twenty. So you keep I've been asking, asking,
scene_heading: SAYING-- ASKING--
dialog: 
text: Pamela stops talking and waits for Disney to calm down.
speaker_heading: WALT (CONT'D)
dialog: I got old asking.
text: He sits back down on his desk.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: What a charming story.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: About my getting old?
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: About your daughters.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Yeah I suppose it is.
text: (he looks at the picture)
dialog: They're both women now. Gosh! Can
dialog: you believe it?
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Children grow up.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Now Pam, a man can't break a
dialog: promise to his kids. No matter how
dialog: long it takes to keep. No matter
dialog: how long! You might've kept me
dialog: dangling all this time but now we
dialog: gotcha!
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Gotcha indeed! Mister Disney, if
dialog: you have dangled then it is at the
dialog: end of a rope you have fashioned
dialog: for yourself.
speaker_heading: WALT
speaker_heading: PAMELA--
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: I was quite clear when you
dialog: approached me the first time that
dialog: she wasn't for sale and clear again
dialog: when you approached me a year later
dialog: and clear again when you approached
dialog: me every annum for the subsequent
dialog: 18 years. Honestly, I feel
text: corralled, ensnared--
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Pam, Pam, the last thing I want is
dialog: to make you feel--
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: My name, if you please, is MRS
dialog: Travers.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: You see, I promised them. That's a
dialog: fact. You got kids?
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: NOT--
speaker_heading: WALT
speaker_heading: (OVER)
dialog: I have never, I swear, never broken
dialog: a promise to either one of my
dialog: Disney girls.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Well, that's very honourable of you
speaker_heading: BUT--
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: That's what being a daddy is all
dialog: about right?
speaker_heading: PAMELA
speaker_heading: (DEEP BREATH)
dialog: Is it?
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: This movie isn't just going to make
dialog: my kids happy. It's going to make
dialog: ALL kids happy! You see my guys are
dialog: gonna do things with it that are,
dialog: well, are revolutionary.
text: He's up again.
speaker_heading: WALT (CONT'D)
dialog: REVOLUTIONARY,Pam!
speaker_heading: PAMELA
speaker_heading: OH DEAR--
text: Pamela rubs her temples as she watches him fly about the
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: WALT
text: Mary Poppins will literally fly off
dialog: the pages of your books!
text: The door opens and Tommie comes in with the tea, Walt
text: gestures for her to bring it to him.
speaker_heading: WALT (CONT'D)
dialog: Now imagine! This magical woman who
dialog: has only lived in your head, you'll
dialog: be able to meet her, speak to her,
dialog: hear her sing.
text: Tommie places the tray on Walt's desk and leaves the room.
text: Walt picks up the tea pot.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Yes, this singing, I am glad you've
dialog: come to that.
dialog: (addressing his tea
speaker_heading: MAKING)
dialog: Milk first!
text: Walt puts the pot down immediately like a scolded child and
text: picks up the milk jug, he pours.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: That's right. Now the tea--
text: He picks up the pot again and pours the tea.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
text: And a spoonful of sugar.
text: He stirs.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: You don't mean for this film to be
dialog: a musical?
speaker_heading: WALT
speaker_heading: (TAKEN ABACK)
dialog: I absolutely do!
text: He presents her with the cup.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: No.
text: She takes a sip, he waits anxiously to see if his tea is any
dialog: good.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: Not bad. No, Mister Disney, Mary
text: Poppins does not sing.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Oh yes she does!
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: In your books!
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Those aren't songs! They're
text: recitations. She is not a giddy
dialog: woman, she does not jig! Singing is
dialog: frivolous and wholly unnecessary
dialog: for a governess, an educatress. No.
dialog: It would just ruin it.
text: Walt is baffled. He takes a sip of tea, it's disgusting, he
text: spits it back into his cup surreptitiously, then coughs
text: loudly. Pamela's jaw drops.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: I won't have her turned into one of
dialog: your silly cartoons.
text: Walt takes a sharp breath on `silly' and then plasters the
text: smile back on.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Tell ya what. You just listen to
dialog: what my Sherman boys have come up
dialog: with and if they don't knock your
dialog: socks off then I'm the King of
dialog: England.
text: Pamela rolls her eyes.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: If you're the King of England then
dialog: you shan't exist and knowing the
dialog: little of you I do; I shouldn't
dialog: think you would like that very
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Bet you would.
text: She smirks, as does he.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I do quite like Greensleeves.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Greensleeves huh?
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Come to think of it. That's a song
dialog: I wouldn't object to.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Greensleeves.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Yes.
text: He's not sure if she's playing with him.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Pam, I want you to know that the
dialog: last thing I would do, the very
dialog: last thing, is tarnish a story I
dialog: have cherished.
text: He moves closer to her, takes her hand, she needs it for her
dialog: teacup, it's awkward.
speaker_heading: WALT (CONT'D)
dialog: (gazing into her eyes)
text: The pages are worn down to tissue,
dialog: dog eared and falling out. I have
text: poured over them gripped,
dialog: tormented. Because I love Mary
dialog: Poppins, you got to share her with
dialog: me.
text: Pamela is torn between finding Disney captivating and totally
text: barking.
speaker_heading: WALT (CONT'D)
dialog: A course nothing happens without
dialog: your say so. Absolutely Nothing.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Quite right.
text: She extricates her hand.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: It's all in the rights agreement.
dialog: As approved by your agent, Dermot.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Diarmuid.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Darmitt.
text: Disney hands the rights agreement and a pen to her, Pamela
text: takes it without looking and folds it up.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: (waving the agreement)
text: A live action film. No animation.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Live action.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: I'd like that on tape.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Hm?
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Your promise-- and all the
dialog: discussions we have here-- on tape.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Tape you say.
text: She pops the rights document in her bag. Walt's joviality,
text: his bright demeanour, vanishes in a split second.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Ah there you are.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Mary Poppins and the Banks's,
dialog: they're family to me.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: I understand. I do.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Well then!
text: She stands up and smooths down her skirt.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: Shall we begin?
text: He holds out his hand for her to shake.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Let's make something wonderful.
text: She leaves his hand hanging in mid air.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Let's see if that's at all
dialog: possible.
text: Pamela gets up, smooths down her skirt, snorts at a picture
text: of Disney in a silly hat astride a model train and
text: purposefully strides out of the room, a smile across her face
dialog: that Disney does not see.

speaker_heading: TRAVERS

dialog: with every type of snack and beverage imaginable from bagels

speaker_heading: BOB
speaker_heading: (SEETHING)
dialog: That is a very expensive piano.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: And these are beautiful blooms
dialog: butchered for our visual and nasal
dialog: enjoyment when we could have just

dialog: happily minding their own business

text: Everybody waits.
text: Pamela flicks her eyes at the tape recorder which Don duly

speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)

scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - NEAR GOFF HOUSE - DAY
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON:
text: A tiny park, about half a metre square - it has grass, tiny
text: trees made from flowers, a small hole filled with water for a
text: pond, park benches made with twigs and miniature wooden
text: clothes-peg people. Ginty puts the finishing touches to the
text: bandstand and sits back, staring in wonder.
text: The moment is broken with the sound of hooves as her father
text: appears, atop his horse.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS
dialog: Ahhh, there's my girl.
text: The horse moves up to her.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS (CONT'D)
dialog: That's it Albert. Give Ginty a
dialog: smooch. There's a good boy, give
text: her a little smooch.
text: The velvety muzzle of the horse "smooches" Ginty's neck and
text: ear as Travers climbs down from the nag.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS (CONT'D)
dialog: Poor old Albert; he's your secret
dialog: uncle you know? But a miserable,
text: horrid witch turned him into a nag.
speaker_heading: GINTY
dialog: Why did she do that?!
speaker_heading: TRAVERS
dialog: Because she hated the sound of his
dialog: laugh.
speaker_heading: GINTY
dialog: Poor Uncle Albert! How can we fix
dialog: him?
speaker_heading: TRAVERS
dialog: We have to teach the witch how to
dialog: be happy again.
speaker_heading: GINTY
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: TRAVERS
dialog: I'm not quite sure darling.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Your mother's been calling you for
dialog: a good hour. I shouldn't go if I
dialog: were you, she's after little slaves
dialog: for housework!
speaker_heading: (RECITING YEATS)
dialog: Ah, I must scrub and bake and sweep
text: Till stars are beginning to blink
speaker_heading: AND PEEP;
dialog: And the young lie long and dream in
speaker_heading: THEIR BED
dialog: Of the matching of ribbons for

text: Travers sighs, let's the words ring in his ears, touches the
text: end of daughter's nose.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you want to know what it feels
dialog: like to fly Ginty?
text: She nods. He hauls himself onto Albert, leans down and swings
text: Ginty up so she is facing him.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS (CONT'D)
dialog: You trust me?
text: She nods and wraps her arms around him looking backwards over
text: his shoulder.
text: He grips her firmly around the waist and she spreads her
dialog: arms.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS (CONT'D)
dialog: Gee up, Albert. Yah!
text: Travers kicks the horse into a trot, then into a canter, he

speaker_heading: TRAVERS (CONT'D)
dialog: Yah!
text: Ginty squeals with delight.

scene_heading: INT. LIMOSINE - MORNING

text: Nobody walks.
speaker_heading: RALPH
speaker_heading: (SADLY)
dialog: Leisurely stroll's a gift.

scene_heading: EXT. LAUREL CANYON - MORNING

speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Beautiful ain't it?
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: (refusing him the
speaker_heading: SATISFACTION)
dialog: If you like that sort of thing.
speaker_heading: RALPH

scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - ALLORA - DAY

scene_heading: INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY
text: Don DaGradi and the Shermans are escorting Pamela along a row
text: of storyboard illustrations for the film. Dolly trundles
text: along behind, carrying a tray with a cup of tea on it which
text: Pamela occasionally picks up and takes a sip from.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: We do find it helps to have a
dialog: visual. It's fun!
text: She stops in front of a sketch of the Banks house.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: No, no, no. Goodness no.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: PAMELA
text: The Banks house doesn't look like
dialog: that! My house is a terraced house
text: with a pink door, white bricked
text: with a crack in the gable. The
text: window frames are lead-lined and
text: the flower boxes grow pink
dialog: nasturtiums to go with the pink
speaker_heading: DOOR AND--
dialog: (gesturing to the tape
speaker_heading: RECORDER)
dialog: Did we get that?
dialog: (to herself, slightly
speaker_heading: HYSTERICAL)
dialog: Oh dear, it's all a big mistake.
dialog: It's all wrong.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: It's all wrong?
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: It's too grand! The Banks family -
dialog: they're normal, everyday sort of
dialog: people. This isn't normal. It isn't
dialog: everyday! They're not aristocrats!
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Interesting.
text: Don allows a tiny smile. She is right. Pamela lingers over a
text: picture of the parrot head umbrella, a split second of
text: something like recognition on her face and then she simply
text: moves on.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
speaker_heading: (TO HERSELF)
dialog: Okay.
text: She stops again in front of a sketch of Mrs Banks wearing a
dialog: suffragette ribbon.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (SIGHING)
dialog: Do I even have to say it?
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Um-- yeah?
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Why in the world have you made Mrs

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I wonder if Emmeline P would agree
dialog: with that adjective--
speaker_heading: PAMELA
text: Quite possibly, looking back.
dialog: Dick mouths `oh my god!'
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: It does seem strange that Mrs Banks
dialog: allows her children to spend all of
dialog: their time with the nanny when she
dialog: has no job to speak of--
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Are you calling Mrs Banks
dialog: neglectful?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: No! Of course not! We just felt
dialog: that if she had a job it would go
dialog: some way to explaining--
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Being a mother is a job. A very
dialog: difficult job and one that not
dialog: everybody is up to, that not
dialog: everybody should have taken on in
dialog: the first place!
text: The boys see that Pamela is talking about something
text: meaningful to her and they begin to soften for a brief
dialog: moment, until--
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: I will NOT have her called Cynthia!
dialog: Absolutely not. It feels unlucky.
text: Dick makes a curly wurly cuckoo sign at Bob.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: No it should be something warm, a
dialog: bit sexy.
text: They all nearly choke at the word `sexy' coming out of her
dialog: mouth.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: How about Mavis?
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Sybil?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Prudence?
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Gwendolyn?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Great.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Winifred!
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: I could go with Winifred.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Yes, that's because it's very good.
text: She comes to the next sketch and stops abruptly in front of
text: it, a split second of utter confusion crosses her face.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: This isn't Mr Banks?
text: She turns to face Don and the boys.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: This isn't him.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Ahm, yeah, that's him--
speaker_heading: PAMELA
text: He has a set of moustaches!
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: In the books he--
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: I told the illustrator I didn't
dialog: like the facial hair but she chose
dialog: to ignore me. This is MY film and
dialog: this time around I shall have MY
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: DOLLY
dialog: (clearing her throat)
dialog: Mrs Travers, it was a specific
dialog: request, from Walt.
text: Pamela doesn't acknowledge that Dolly has spoken; Dolly
text: flushes.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: (to the boys)
dialog: Why?
text: Everyone shrugs, they don't know why.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: He didn't, he doesn't, Mr Banks is
dialog: clean shaven!
text: Bob buries his face in his hands and let's out a long, loud,
text: unashamed moan.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Does it mattterrrrrrr?!
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Bob, Bob, Bob--
text: Pamela stares at Bob.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: You can wait outside!
text: She points at the door, ordering him out with her finger. Bob
text: is literally stunned. Dick stifles a laugh.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: I shan't say it again Robert.
text: Bob storms out of the room (as fast as his limp and cane will
text: allow him) slamming the door and from behind it we hear:
speaker_heading: BOB (O.S.)
dialog: KILL ME! KILL ME NOW!
speaker_heading: PAMELA
speaker_heading: (TO DICK)
dialog: What is wrong with his leg?
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: He got shot.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Hardly surprising.

scene_heading: INT. BAR/LOBBY - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - LATE AFTERNOON

text: when the doors finally slide open.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GOFF HOUSE - WASHROOM - ALLORA - MORNING
text: Travers faces his reflection in the mirror as Ginty looks on

speaker_heading: GINTY
dialog: Why do you do that?
speaker_heading: TRAVERS
dialog: For you my dear!
text: (he flicks the blade in
dialog: the air like a swordsman)
dialog: Swish! Which kind of kisses do you
dialog: prefer Gintamina? Swoosh! Scratchy
dialog: ones or silky ones?
speaker_heading: GINTY
speaker_heading: (THINKS)
dialog: Silky ones.
dialog: A man must shave for to spare his

scene_heading: INT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - SUITE - MORNING

speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: Swoosh.
scene_heading: INT. DISNEY STUDIOS - CORRIDOR - DAY

dialog: infernal thing is!
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: It's something to say when you
dialog: don't know what to say!
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Well I always know what to say.
text: The slamming of a piano lid. Dolly pushes the door open with

speaker_heading: DOLLY

speaker_heading: DISNEY
dialog: Ya? What kind of ideas?
speaker_heading: DOLLY
dialog: About how she, uh, sees things.
speaker_heading: DISNEY
dialog: And just how does she `see' things?
text: Dolly sighs and pulls out a note pad.
speaker_heading: DOLLY
speaker_heading: (READING)
dialog: The name Cynthia has been changed
dialog: to Winifred.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Okay that'll work.
speaker_heading: DOLLY
dialog: She won't approve Dick Van Dyke.
text: Walt laughs, Dolly allows herself a little giggle too.
speaker_heading: DOLLY (CONT'D)
dialog: The sketches of the Banks house
dialog: make it look too opulent, there
dialog: must be no hint of romance between
dialog: Mary Poppins and Bert, she wants to
dialog: know why Mr Banks has been given a
dialog: moustache, the--
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: I asked for that.
speaker_heading: DOLLY
dialog: Yes. They did tell her but she
dialog: wants to know why.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Because I asked for it.
speaker_heading: DOLLY
dialog: Right. Of course. Uh-- the tape
dialog: measure Mary Poppins uses to record
text: Jane and Micheal's height must be a
dialog: roll tape, not a ruler, we must add
dialog: gravi-- gravitas, she says.
speaker_heading: DISNEY
dialog: Gahd! Anything else?
speaker_heading: DOLLY
dialog: She only wants green vegetables and
dialog: broth, I don't know what that is
dialog: but she wants it in the room from
dialog: now on and oh! She doesn't want the
text: colour red in the film-- at all.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY
text: Dick, Don and Pamela sit around the meeting table. Bob hovers
text: by the door in a right humph. Disney prefers to stand,
text: grazing occasionally from a bowl of candy.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: I've simply gone off the colour.
text: Their mouths are agape.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: You did say I was to have final say
dialog: did you not?
speaker_heading: DISNEY
dialog: We can't make the film without the

speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: DISNEY
text: There's buses and mail boxes and

dialog: YOU'RE--
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: I understand your predicament Mr
dialog: Disney, I do. I just-- hm-- I don't
dialog: know what it is, I'm just suddenly
dialog: very anti-red. I shan't be wearing
dialog: it ever again.
text: Disney comes and sits on the table in front of Pam and locks
text: eyes with her.
speaker_heading: DISNEY
dialog: Is this a test Pam? Are you
dialog: requiring proof of how badly I
dialog: wanna make you happy so that we can
dialog: create this beautiful thing
dialog: together?
text: Pamela averts her eyes for a split second, embarrassed about
dialog: `creating something beautiful' with Walt, but quickly
text: recovers and eyeballs him right back.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: I took you at your word Mr Disney
dialog: and it seems my first stipulation
dialog: has been denied. There will be many
dialog: more, so-- perhaps we should just
dialog: call it quits and I should hand you
dialog: back these?
text: She takes the rights agreement out of her bag and offers it
dialog: to him.
text: Disney smiles at Pamela.
speaker_heading: DISNEY
dialog: Alright. No red in the film.
text: Pamela glances at the tape recorder.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Walt?
dialog: Don and the Shermans can't believe he has given in! Disney
text: strides out of the room.
scene_heading: INT. DISNEY STUDIOS - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
text: Disney marches down the corridor away from the rehearsal
text: room. He stops, turns, goes back to the door, puts his hand
text: on the handle, stops himself and moves on.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Dick, Don and Bob are left astounded. They look at one
dialog: another.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: He doesn't have the rights--
text: All three turn their heads to turn to her.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Quite.
text: Pamela smiles a broad satisfied smile at the boys, smooths

speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, If you're insisting upon this

dialog: for my film then I suggest I hear

speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Thank you. Tea is a balm for the

text: But the barman has already moved on to another patron.
text: Time moves swiftly, the teapot is drained, the customers come

scene_heading: TRAVERS GOFF - BANK MANAGER

scene_heading: INT. TRAVERS OFFICE - DAY

text: The clerk laughs nervously.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS (CONT'D)

dialog: their calving, or they don't drop
dialog: dead on schedule when he wants a

speaker_heading: (HE SIGHS)
dialog: It's a chimera you know? The world,
dialog: the bank, you and I, Mr Randolph-
dialog: whackety-whack-Belhatchett. All an
dialog: illusion.

speaker_heading: PAMELA
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: I loathe this place, Mr Russell.
dialog: How can a place so sunny be so
dialog: cold?
dialog: We don't hear what Diarmuid says.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: I meant heartless. I'm afraid a
dialog: jumper wouldn't suffice. It's
dialog: bringing up these-- it's so hot and
dialog: stuffy I feel like I am being
dialog: attacked. These odd dreams, like my
text: subconscious is after me. Punishing
dialog: me for entertaining the idea that I
dialog: might hand her over. I am at war
dialog: with myself Mr Russell.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: The script is ghastly, exactly as I
speaker_heading: EXPECTED--
speaker_heading: (BEAT)

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Very well. Good morning and
dialog: goodnight.
text: She hangs up the phone, and continues sitting upright. Wide

text: Pamela checks through her multitude of pill bottles for

text: herself out of bed, pacing the room, counting steps.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: Serves me right. Money, money,
dialog: money. Bit me on the bot.
text: Her eyes stray to the big Mickey Mouse. She drags it onto the

text: the stuffed toy for comfort.
scene_heading: INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - MORNING
text: The room is decidedly more lively, with sketches of the cast

text: the requisite abundance of brightly coloured food now
dialog: accompanied by some healthier options - vegetables and a

text: Bob and Dick are at the piano. Don sits in the corner,

speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: It's gotta be like a slogan!
speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: DICK

speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: DICK

speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: WALT

speaker_heading: PAMELA

scene_heading: INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - MORNING
text: Dick is playing about with a verse.
speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: DICK &amp; BOB

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Wait! WAIT! She always does what's
dialog: unexpected.
text: She goes UP the bannisters.
text: Dick is confused.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: So go up.
text: Dick plays a high note.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Try B.
text: He takes a pencil from behind his ear and marks Dick's sheet

speaker_heading: DICK &amp; BOB
dialog: (singing `down' in an up
speaker_heading: KEY)
text: Just a spoonful of sugar helps the

speaker_heading: DON (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO WALT)
dialog: I want you to hear this.
dialog: (to the boys)
dialog: Play him what you got.
text: Walt takes a seat beside the piano. Pamela folds her arms
text: across her chest defiantly.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: It's just a chorus--
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Tell us what you think.
dialog: He knows dum dum
dialog: Will help dum dum dum duuuum!

speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: PAMELA
speaker_heading: (UNHAPPY)

speaker_heading: DON
dialog: It's ironic.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Is it?
speaker_heading: WALT

text: Pamela rolls her eyes.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
speaker_heading: (SARCASTIC)
dialog: Bravo.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: I won't be able to stop singing
dialog: that for weeks!
speaker_heading: PAMELA
text: It seems enormously patronising to
dialog: me. The very sort of annoying tune
dialog: you would have playing in your
dialog: themed park I daresay. All giddy
dialog: and carefree, encouraging children
dialog: to face the world unarmed. All they
dialog: need is a spoon and some sugar and
dialog: a brain full of fluff and they're
text: equipped with life's tools.
dialog: Wonderful!
text: Dick is completely deflated.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: What's your point Pam?
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: MRS Travers! My point is that,
dialog: unlike yourself, Mary Poppins is
dialog: the very enemy of sentiment and
dialog: whimsy. She is truthful, she
dialog: doesn't sugar coat the darkness in
dialog: the world that these children will
text: eventually come to know. She
text: prepares them for it, she deals in
dialog: honesty. One must clean one's room;
dialog: it won't magically do it itself!
text: She waves the script in the air.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: This whole script is flim flam!
dialog: Where is its reality? Where is its
dialog: heart, where is the gravitas?
text: She opens a window and flings the script out.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: No weight Mister Disney! See?
text: Dick, Don and Bob look out of the window as the pages flutter
text: downwards and spread themselves over the Disney lot.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: No whimsy or sentiment says the
text: woman who sends a flying nanny with
text: a talking umbrella to save the
dialog: children.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: You think Mary Poppins is saving

text: Pamela sighs, shakes her head.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: What a lovely surprise! Did you

speaker_heading: TRAVERS
dialog: I couldn't stop thinking about my

text: into the ground.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Oh!
speaker_heading: TRAVERS
dialog: I'll wash them again my love!
text: Margaret look at the dirty sheets and shrugs.
text: The kids run after their father squealing and giggling as the
text: poor little hen runs for its life. Even the dog joins in,
text: Margaret goes to retrieve the discarded jacket and sees a
text: whisky bottle protruding from the inside pocket, she slips it
text: back inside - out of sight, out of mind.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS (CONT'D)
dialog: Go Sergeant Ginty! Fell the beast!
text: Ginty dives on the hapless bird, who pecks her soundly and

speaker_heading: WALT

text: Travers walks up the path to their home, trailing his suit
text: jacket over his shoulder, his shirt and tie loosened. His

text: He looks up to see Pamela sitting on the front step and

text: There's a smattering of applause, Travers is encouraged,
text: Margaret and Ginty look relieved, even hopeful.
text: But then Travers momentarily looks lost, a slight breeze tugs
text: the speech notes from his hand and they float down in front
dialog: of the dais.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS
dialog: Uhmm. Thank you kindly. Thanking
dialog: you. Now-- what, what am I doing
dialog: next? Oh! It's a marvellous idea to
dialog: encourage children to open
dialog: accounts. My daughter, the Princess
dialog: Ginty-- she's-- uh.
dialog: (looks at Ginty)
dialog: How old are you? Come up here.
dialog: Ginty - what? Me?
text: Ginty glances to her mother and then, on trembling legs,
text: makes her way forward and up the stairs onto the dais.
text: Margaret watches, growing uneasy.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS (CONT'D)
dialog: Ginty has a bank account-- and
dialog: that's good. Give her a drink!
text: The audience is shocked.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (MUMBLING)

speaker_heading: TRAVERS (CONT'D)

dialog: must-- relieve myself.
text: Gasps from the audience.
dialog: Margaret - dying.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS (CONT'D)
dialog: Give us your shoulder, Ginty, will
dialog: you? I'm busting. There's a good
dialog: girl.
text: Father and daughter walk towards the edge of the stage,
text: Travers leaning on Ginty's shoulder. The shameful glare of
text: Allora burning into them.
speaker_heading: DON (O.S.)
dialog: When fall the banks of England,
dialog: England falls!
text: Travers somehow loses his footing before reaching the steps
text: and topples off the stage. There's an audible, horrible snap
text: as he lands in an undignified pile. But, despite his ugly
text: injury, Travers cannot stop laughing.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: The boys are laughing, congratulating one another.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: I love it!
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: You think Walt's gonna like it?
text: Pamela takes a last look at the Mr Banks picture and spins
text: around viciously.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Why did you have to make him so
dialog: cruel?
text: The boys jubilance is halted immediately.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: He was not a monster!
speaker_heading: DON

speaker_heading: DICK BOB

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: And do those children write you

speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Mine like to make folded paper--
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: (cutting him off)
dialog: And would you tear up those gifts?
dialog: In front of them?!
text: Silence. They know where this is going.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: It's a dreadful thing to do! I
dialog: don't understand! Why must father
dialog: tear up the advertisement his
dialog: children have written and throw it
dialog: in the fireplace!? Why won't he
dialog: mend their kite? Why have you made
dialog: him so unspeakably awful?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: For all the world to see, in
dialog: glorious technicolor? You claim to
dialog: make them live-- if that happens
dialog: can't he? Can't they at least live
dialog: well?
text: Pamela chokes back a sudden rush of distress.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: I can't bear it.
speaker_heading: (SOFTLY)
scene_heading: PLEASE DON'T--
text: The boys are shocked at the level of upset.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: Please don't-- I'll feel like I let
dialog: him down again--
text: She leaves the room, head hung.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TRAVERS BEDROOM - GOFF HOUSE - DAY
text: Travers is in bed, his leg elevated and set with plaster. He
text: is shaking badly with DT's, his mood is poisonous.
text: Ginty sits on the edge of the bed as the DOCTOR packs up his
dialog: bag.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS
dialog: I don't suppose there's any more
dialog: you can give me for the pain?
text: The doctor shakes his head at Travers wanton greed for more.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: (leaving the room)
dialog: When will enough be enough Travers?
speaker_heading: GINTY
dialog: I've brought you something father.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS
dialog: Be a darling Ginty my old pal! Help
dialog: father out won't you?
text: Ginty is wary.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS (CONT'D)
dialog: In my washroom-- there's a bottle
dialog: of medicine that father needs--
speaker_heading: GINTY
dialog: Mother took it away.
text: Travers slams his fist on the bed, scaring Ginty.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS
dialog: Godammit!
text: Nervous, hopeful, Ginty withdraws a folded sheet of paper
text: from her pocket.
speaker_heading: GINTY
dialog: I wrote a poem for you. It - it
dialog: won first prize, at school.
text: Travers takes the page, tries to hold it steady in his
text: shaking hand.
speaker_heading: GINTY (CONT'D)
dialog: Would you like me to read it to
dialog: you?
text: The agony as Ginty watches the shaking hand. Finally, the
text: humiliation is too much for Travers. He scans the page
text: rapidly and lowers his hand.
speaker_heading: TRAVERS
dialog: It's hardly Yeats, is it?
text: Ginty is devastated. But more than this there's a hardening
text: in her small face, a sense of disillusionment that so far
text: she's held in check. Here are the first signs of the Pamela
dialog: to come.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY
text: Pamela rushes from the rehearsal room, down the corridor, her
text: face twisted, desperately trying to maintain composure. Don
text: rushes out after her.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Mrs Travers!
text: He stops, recognizing she doesn't need to be followed.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - GOFF HOUSE - DAY
text: Ginty rummages through kitchen cabinets, drawers, the trash
text: but doesn't find what she's looking for.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY
text: Pamela rushes past Minnie Mouse and Daisy Duck, through the
text: lot, past Ralph - who's taking his lunch at the cafeteria -
text: and towards a patch of green, a communal lawn at the back of
text: a soundstage.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GOFF HOUSE - DAY
text: Ginty fights the smell of the warm rubbish in the midday sun
text: as she ransacks the outdoor trash cans, finally finding what
text: it is she's looking for.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GRASS AREA - DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY
text: Pamela flops down onto the ground, digging her fingers into
text: the dirt and lawn.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TRAVERS BEDROOM - GOFF HOUSE - DAY
text: Ginty creeps into her father's room, he sleeps fitfully, and
text: presses the half-full bottle into his hand. Covering both
text: hand and bottle with his bed covers before leaving the room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GRASS AREA - DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY
text: Pamela picks a daisy, finds a stray twig and arranges them in
dialog: the grass.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Mrs?
text: Pamela looks up, her eyes are red rimmed but she's not
text: crying.
speaker_heading: RALPH (CONT'D)
dialog: I, uh, brought you a tea.
text: He hands her the tea in a takeaway cup.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: It's blasphemy to drink tea from a
text: paper cup.
text: Ralph, shifts nervously from foot to foot. He's not quite
dialog: sure what to say to her or why he brought the tea.
text: Pamela puts the tea down and continues to fiddle with bits
text: and pieces of twig and bloom that she's plucking from the
text: area around her.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Everything okay Ma'am? Would you
dialog: like me to drive you home?
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: All the way to England? Yes,
dialog: please.
text: Ralph lowers himself onto his haunches.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: You got family back there Mrs?
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: You're an impertinent man you know?
dialog: You ask an awful lot of questions
dialog: that have no relevance to you being
dialog: able to carry out your duties.
speaker_heading: RALPH
speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: I know! I do, do that. Yes!
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: And you have no barometer.
text: Ralph is confused.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: Let us say that I haven't family
dialog: who'd notice whether I was halfway
dialog: across the world or sitting in my
dialog: living room.
text: She pulls a thread from the hem of her skirt, ties two twigs
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: RALPH
speaker_heading: MA'AM; I--
text: Ralph sees that she has a little collection of things, he
text: looks around for some more. Pamela takes a stick and digs a
text: small line through the grass then hands it to him.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Make a little furrow, there.
text: Ralph dutifully does as he's told, looking over his shoulder
dialog: for fear of being caught digging holes in Disney soil.
text: Ralph pokes the ground, thinking.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: I gotta kid.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Well, most people do.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Jane-- she's got all kinds of
dialog: troubles.
text: Pamela raises an eyebrow.
speaker_heading: RALPH (CONT'D)
dialog: Handicapped you know? Myelitis--
dialog: transverse.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: She's in a wheelchair see? That's
dialog: why I concern myself with the
dialog: weather-- sunny day she can sit out
dialog: in the garden. Rainy day I have to
text: leave her cooped up inside.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Worry `bout the future, but then I
dialog: stop cuz you can't do that. Only
dialog: today.
text: Pamela takes the plastic lid off the paper cup and pokes
text: holes in it.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Now look.
text: She takes the lid, twigs now sticking out of the poked holes
text: and places it in the centre of what we now see is one of
text: Pamela's tiny parks, she gently rest a leaf on the twig
text: struts forming a roof.
speaker_heading: PAMELA (CONT'D)
dialog: It's a band stand.
text: She takes the cup of tea and gently pours the steaming liquid
text: into Ralph's trench, which runs all the way around the park.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: A river!
speaker_heading: PAMELA
speaker_heading: (CORRECTING HIM)
dialog: Lake.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Lake.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Hey! I wish I could take her there!
text: He points at the miniature park.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Wouldn't that be nice?
scene_heading: INT. GINTY BIDDY &amp; MOYA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Ginty, Biddy and Moya sleep soundly, Ginty clutching the poem
text: to her chest.
text: The door creeps open and Margaret stands in the shadows
text: looking at her children, tears stream down her face but she
text: seems calm, something has crossed over in her eyes. There's
dialog: just nothing there--
speaker_heading: MARGARET
speaker_heading: (WHISPERING)
dialog: I know you gave it to him.
dialog: (squeezing Ginty's hand)
text: All the hope is in the bottom of
dialog: that bottle, Helen.
speaker_heading: GINTY
dialog: Mother?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I want you to take care of the
dialog: children.
text: Ginty is groggy, she doesn't understand.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT'D)
dialog: Watch over them.
text: Ginty sits up.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT'D)
dialog: I know you love your father more.
dialog: But one day you'll understand.
speaker_heading: GINTY
dialog: What?
text: Margaret leaves the room and Ginty is straight out of bed
text: following her. Behind, in the room, Moya has awoken and is
text: crying.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - NIGHT
text: Ginty runs out onto the porch where she sees her mother in
text: her white nightdress striding purposefully through the garden
text: like some ethereal ghost.
speaker_heading: GINTY
dialog: Mother!
text: She runs out into the yard but stops as she hears Biddy.
speaker_heading: BIDDY (O.S.)
dialog: Ginty!
text: Ginty turns back to the house and then back towards her
text: mother but Margaret has disappeared into the darkness.
speaker_heading: GINTY
speaker_heading: (CALLING)
dialog: Mother! Mother!
text: The baby is screaming now.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GINTY BIDDY &amp; MOYA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Ginty wrenches the eiderdown off the bed and wraps Biddy in

speaker_heading: BIDDY
dialog: Where's ma?
speaker_heading: GINTY
dialog: Once upon a time there were three
text: little girls alone in a house.
dialog: They were frightened of the big
text: wide world just outside the door.
text: She takes them through the hallway, stopping momentarily
text: outside the door to her fathers bedroom. It is slightly ajar
text: and he looks incredibly frail and delirious.
speaker_heading: GINTY (CONT'D)
dialog: They were so afraid.
text: She moves forward, her eyes flit to the front door, expecting
text: her mother to be standing there any minute but there is
dialog: nothing.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CREEK - NIGHT
text: The mud-stained hem of Margaret's nightdress sweeps along the
text: ground, as her feet move towards, and then into, the water of
text: the creek. One step, two, three, the water coming up over her
text: ankles, soaking the nightgown.
speaker_heading: GINTY (V.O.)
dialog: But the stars were guarding them,
dialog: they glittered as they spoke "We
dialog: shall send a guide to show them the
dialog: way to the magical ladder which
dialog: will bring them all the way up to
speaker_heading: SEE US"
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LIVING ROOM - GOFF HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Biddy and Moya are calming as Ginty places the girls in front
text: of the fireplace.
speaker_heading: GINTY
dialog: And who do you think those
dialog: sparkling messengers sent? Who was
dialog: it that came flying through the
text: starry, starry sky to carry us up
dialog: to see them?
text: Ginty wraps Moya in a blanket and puts her in Biddy's arms.
speaker_heading: BIDDY
dialog: An elf?
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PORCH - GOFF HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Ginty begins to untie Albert from the fence still speaking to
text: the girls through the window.
speaker_heading: GINTY
dialog: Their old Uncle Albert of course!
dialog: (beat, to Biddy)
dialog: Stay right here, be good--
text: Ginty climbs atop the horse.
speaker_heading: BIDDY
dialog: Are you going to the sky?
speaker_heading: GINTY
dialog: I'm going to find the end of the
dialog: story so I can bring it back for
dialog: you!
speaker_heading: BIDDY
dialog: Is it happy?
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PADDOCK - NIGHT
text: Ginty rides fast, desperately searching the darkness for her
text: mother and turning back frequently to check that the lamp
text: still burns on the porch.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CREEK - NIGHT
text: Margaret is up to her neck in the freezing water of the
text: creek. Shivering cold. She wills herself forward into the
text: water. She wants to sink down and simply float away.
text: From behind her comes the clip clopping of hooves. Margaret
text: turns her head and there, atop the horse, is Ginty.
text: Margaret begins to weep.
text: Ginty jumps down from the horse and rushes to her mother,
text: wading into the water to grab hold of her.
text: Ginty bobs up and down in front of her mother in the deep
dialog: water.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Sometimes a person we love, through
dialog: no fault of his own, can't see past
text: the end of his nose.
speaker_heading: GINTY
dialog: It's time to go home, ma.
text: She reaches out her hand--

scene_heading: INT. SUITE - EVENING
text: Pamela looks through a stack of books intently, jotting

speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: I heard things didn't go so well

speaker_heading: PAMELA

speaker_heading: WALT

speaker_heading: PAMELA

text: turns his face away.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Oh come on! When does anybody get
dialog: to go to Disneyland with Walt
dialog: Disney himself?!
speaker_heading: PAMELA

scene_heading: INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

scene_heading: INT. GOFF HOUSE - TRAVERS BEDROOM - ALLORA - MORNING
text: Ginty sits beside her father, he is restless and sweating in

speaker_heading: MARGARET (O.S.)
dialog: Oh my!
text: And then a new voice, clear as a crystal bell.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELLIE (O.S.)

scene_heading: INT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - MORNING
text: A parrot headed umbrella hangs from the back of a chair.
text: An enormous carpetbag - similar to the one Pamela carries -

text: upright, imposing and matronly is AUNT ELLIE herself. Hair
text: scraped back, hands neatly perched inside her apron pocket -
text: a very different version but Mary Poppins all the same.

speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Is it all like this?
text: Pamela pops a headache pill.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Yup! Isn't it wonderful?

dialog: family.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)

text: He clambers onto his own horse, gestures to the ride
dialog: controller and off they go!
text: Pamela gently bobs up and down, Walt waves to her and she

speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Well begun, is half done!

speaker_heading: PAMELA

speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Pamela? I don't understand why this
dialog: is so hard for you. Please, make me
speaker_heading: UNDERSTAND--
speaker_heading: PAMELA

speaker_heading: GINTY
dialog: I dropped the pears.

speaker_heading: WALT
speaker_heading: (SURPRISED)
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Oh well, when in Rome!

speaker_heading: PAMELA

speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: No, I've come because you misjudge

speaker_heading: PAMELA

speaker_heading: WALT

speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: WALT (CONT'D)
dialog: You think I've built an empire and
dialog: that I want to use your Mary
dialog: Poppins as just another brick in my

speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: And don't you?
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: If that was all it was would I have
text: pursued an cranky, stubborn dame
dialog: like you for twenty years? I'd've
dialog: have saved myself an ulcer!
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: No, you expected me to disappoint
dialog: you and so you made sure I did. You
dialog: see, I think life disappoints you,
dialog: Mrs Travers. I think it's done
dialog: that a lot. Maybe Mary Poppins is
dialog: the only person in your life who
dialog: hasn't.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Mary Poppins isn't real.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Oh, no, that's not true. She's real
dialog: as can be to my daughter's and to
dialog: thousands of other children--
dialog: adults too. She's been there as a
dialog: nighttime comfort to a heck of a
dialog: lot of people.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Well, Where is she when I need her?
text: Hm? I open the door to Mary Poppins
dialog: and who should be standing there
dialog: but Walt Disney!
text: He laughs.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Mrs Travers, I am so sorry. I hoped
dialog: this would be a magical experience
dialog: for you, for all of us. But I let
dialog: you down-- and in doing so, I've
dialog: broken a twenty year old promise to
dialog: my girls.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I've been wracking my brains,
dialog: trying to figure out why this has
dialog: been so hard for you and I--
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: You see, I have my own Mr Banks.
dialog: Mine had a moustache.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Ah! Not true then that Disney
dialog: created man in his own image?
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: But it is true that you created
dialog: yourself in someone else's yes?
text: She doesn't answer. Walt takes mouthful of laced tea and
text: coughs a little.
speaker_heading: WALT (CONT'D)
dialog: Ever been to Kansas City, Mrs
dialog: Travers? Do you know Missouri at
dialog: all?
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Can't say I do and as I have no
dialog: plans to ever set foot on American
dialog: soil again I'm afraid I never will.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: It's mighty cold there in the
text: winters. Bitter.
text: Walt stops talking, catches himself, looks away and then
text: gives in. His enthusiasm completely disappears and he's
text: suddenly as ragged and as weary as Pamela.
speaker_heading: WALT (CONT'D)
dialog: (it pours out)
dialog: My dad, Elias Disney, he owned a
dialog: newspaper delivery route there.
text: Thousand papers. Twice daily.
dialog: Morning and evening edition. Elias,
dialog: he was a tough businessman. A save-
dialog: a-penny anywhere you can type of
dialog: fella so he wouldn't employ any
dialog: delivery boys, he just used me and
dialog: my big brother Roy. I was eight
dialog: then-- eight years old.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Like I said, those winters were
dialog: harsh and old Elias didn't believe
dialog: in new shoes until the old ones
dialog: were worn right through so--
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Honestly, Mrs Travers, the snow
dialog: would be up to here--
text: He gestures to his knees.
speaker_heading: WALT (CONT'D)
dialog: You'd push through it like wading
dialog: through molasses.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: WALT (CONT'D)
dialog: And the cold and the wet would be
text: seeping through the shoes and the
text: skin would be raw and peeling from
dialog: our faces-- and sometimes I'd find
dialog: myself sunk down in the snow,
dialog: waking up, cuz I must've passed out
dialog: for a moment-- I dunno. Then
text: school, too cold to figure out an
text: equation. And back into the snow so
dialog: by the time we got home it'd be
dialog: just getting dark, and every part
dialog: of you would sting like crazy as it
text: slowly came back to life in the
dialog: warmth. My mother would feed us
dialog: dinner and then it'd be time to go
text: out again for the evening edition.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Best be quick Walt, best be quick
dialog: or poppa's gonna show you the

text: Walt smiles at Pamela, sips his tea.
speaker_heading: WALT (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, I don't tell you all this to
dialog: make you sad Mrs Travers, I don't.
dialog: I love my life - it's a miracle.
dialog: And I loved my daddy, boy I loved
dialog: him. But, there isn't a day goes by
dialog: where I don't think of that little
text: boy in the snow and old Elias with
dialog: his fist and strap and I'm just so
dialog: tired-- I'm tired of remembering it
dialog: that way. Aren't you tired Mrs
dialog: Travers? We all have our tales but
dialog: don't you want to find a way to
dialog: finish the story? Let it all go and
dialog: have a life that isn't dictated by
dialog: a past?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)

speaker_heading: PAMELA

speaker_heading: WALT

speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: I don't need to forgive my father.

speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: No, you need to forgive Helen Goff.

speaker_heading: WALT (CONT'D)
dialog: Give her to me, Mrs Travers. Trust
dialog: me with your precious Mary Poppins.
dialog: I won't disappoint you. I swear
dialog: that every time a person goes into
dialog: a movie house - from Leicester to
dialog: St Louis, they will see George
dialog: Banks being saved. They will love
dialog: him and his kids, they will weep
dialog: for his cares, and wring their
dialog: hands when he loses his job. And
dialog: when he flies that kite, oh! They
dialog: will rejoice, they will sing. In
dialog: every movie house, all over the
dialog: world, in the eyes and the hearts
dialog: of my kids, and other kids and
dialog: their mothers and fathers for
dialog: generations to come, George Banks
dialog: will be honoured. George Banks will
dialog: be redeemed. George Banks and all
dialog: he stands for will be saved.
dialog: Maybe not in life, but in
dialog: imagination. Because that's what we
dialog: storytellers do. We restore order
dialog: with imagination. We instill hope
dialog: again and again and again. Trust
dialog: me, Mrs Travers. Let me prove it to
dialog: you. I give you my word.

dialog: in America.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Had a feeling a certain friend of

scene_heading: EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER - HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT
dialog: It's spectacular! Disney's biggest Hollywood opening. Bulbs

text: carpet. Ushers are dressed as English bobbies. Reporters
text: stand on podiums in colourful suits, Penguins dance their
text: hearts out in front of the theater. Pearly Kings and Queens
text: play for the onlookers. Crowds and crowds of fans scream
text: every time a bulb flashes, waving their autograph books and
text: posters in the air. Every Disney character imaginable bounces
text: up and down the lines of well-wishers, hugging them, dancing
text: for them, signing their booklets. Hollywood Blvd is

dialog: party you could ever go to.

scene_heading: INT. LIMO - NIGHT
text: Ralph takes the car slowly through the crowds. Onlookers

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER - HOLLYWOOD -NIGHT
text: The limo stops at the edge of the carpet and Ralph jumps out.
text: He rushes round to Pamela's side and helps her from the car.
text: Immediately a round of flashes go off and Pamela puts her arm
text: up to shield her eyes. It's too much.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: (in her ear)
dialog: This is your night. None of this
dialog: would be possible without you.
text: She brings her arm down, straightens her dress and breaks
text: into a smile, making her way down the carpet to frantic
text: whispers amongst the press and autograph hunters of: "Who is
text: that?" "Is that anyone?" Pamela spots Walt, Dick Van Dyke and
text: Julie Andrews being interviewed together up ahead.
text: Mickey Mouse bounces down the carpet and slows-- he and
text: Pamela lock eyes for a brief moment. He holds out his gloved
text: hand, she takes it and together they watch as a huge toy
text: train chugs to a halt on the blvd and hundreds upon hundreds
text: of coloured balloons fly out of it's roof and into the air.

scene_heading: INT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
text: The auditorium is jam packed. Pamela is seated in front of
text: Walt Disney. Don, the Shermans and their families are in the
text: same row as her - Bob Sherman next to her. The lights begin
text: to dim. The overture begins--
text: We stay close on Pamela as the sounds of the overture fade
text: and the melody of a single tin whistle playing one of Travers
text: old melody's rings in her ears.
text: We hear snippets of the film in the background but we remain
dialog: with Pamela.
text: She looks around at the faces in the audience - laughing,
text: humming, sad, happy, joyous.
text: Intercut with images from Pamela's childhood and the voices
dialog: of Bert and Jane -
text: Ellie's parrot head umbrella--
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: You know, begging your pardon, but
dialog: the one my heart goes out to is
dialog: your father.
dialog: The carousel horses at the Allora fair--
speaker_heading: BERT (CONT'D)
text: There he is in that cold, heartless
text: bank day after day, hemmed in by
text: mounds of cold, heartless
dialog: money.
text: The tuppence and rolling pears--
speaker_heading: BERT (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't like to see any living

text: Uncle Albert with Ginty on his back, carrying her river
dialog: soaked mother back to the house--
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Father in a cage?
text: Ginty pressing the final bottle into her father's hand--
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: They makes cages in all sizes and
dialog: shapes, you know.
text: The image of the dead Travers in his bloodstained bed--
speaker_heading: BERT (CONT'D)
dialog: Bank-shaped some of 'em, carpets
dialog: and all.

speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: I shall stay until the wind
dialog: changes.
text: And then an image from the film:
text: George Banks walks away from us down the misty tree-lined
text: London street, on his way to be fired from the bank.
text: Walt Disney watches with quiet satisfaction.
text: Pamela however has tears coursing down her face. Her
text: shoulders heave as she tries desperately not to sob out loud
text: but people are noticing, looking at her.
text: Disney leans forward, placing a hand on her shoulder. She
text: reaches up and grips it tightly, unable to speak.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: It's all right, Mrs Travers. It's
dialog: alright. Mr Banks is going to be
dialog: all right. I promise.
text: Pamela nods in gratitude, but cannot contain her sobs. It's
text: all pouring from her now, in one immense catharsis.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: No, no. It's just that-- I can't, I
dialog: can't abide cartoons!
text: We stay on her face as we bring up the final song of the
text: film: Let's Go Fly A Kite. The audience around her are
text: smiling, laughing, singing along. Pamela, the tears, silent
text: now, still pouring down her cheeks as she slowly begins to
text: mouth along with the lyrics.
text: And in her head one final image appears.
text: Travers gaze falls upon Ginty, outside his bedroom window,
text: sweeping. Their eyes meet for a brief moment, an unspoken
text: understanding of what is to come, before his close with
text: tiredness.
