text: He totters out on his ivory cane motioning to BOBBY to
text: follow him. Much chatter.
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: Don’t forget to remind me, Reggie-
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I’ll set the alarm.
text: As REGGIE sets his watch, OCTAVIA starts to sing. Her voice
text: is remarkably strong but at one point, she forgets the
text: words, and substitutes “Dee-dee-dee-dee.” She stops,
text: embarrassed. The other singers remain respectful.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - MORNING
text: The residents are eating their breakfasts. Some are being
text: served coffee. DWAYNE doles out pills to various RESIDENTS.
text: SHERYL, sits next to OCTAVIA. Two Polish waitresses, MARTA

speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: Wait, wait!
dialog: (takes another two
text: mouthfuls then pushes
dialog: the bowl towards them)
dialog: Thank you.
text: EVA and MARTA, unphased, continue chatting in Polish and move
text: on to other tables, passing ANNE LANGLEY and then GEORGE,
text: Chorus. GEORGE is observing an argument going on at a table
text: next to a window where REGGIE and CISSY are sitting, her
text: earphones by her side. At the only other table by the window
text: sits CEDRIC, LETITIA, and BOBBY. CISSY glances out the
dialog: window.
text: It’s the chorus vs. the soloists. HARRY is standing
text: between REGGIE and an empty chair (WILF’S). HARRY makes
text: a few attempts to move the chair to seat himself, but
text: REGGIE holds firmly with one hand and one leg, as he
dialog: continues to do The Telegraph crossword. The following
dialog: argument should be overlapped -
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (from the other table)
dialog: You can’t save seats, Reg!
text: REGGIE ignores GEORGE, holding fast to the chair with one leg
text: and one hand while he continues to do the crossword.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (trying to pull the
dialog: seat)
dialog: You soloists come in and just sing
text: a few arias. We sing the entire
dialog: bloody opera.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (pulls back)
dialog: You may be on stage the entire
dialog: time, but you're not actually
dialog: singing, you're just standing
text: in the back.
text: HARRY begins to argue back and REGGIE overrides him.
speaker_heading: REGGIE (CONT’D)
dialog: (indicates people at
dialog: his table)
dialog: Why now, Harry? We’ve been
dialog: sitting at this table for as
dialog: long as I’ve been here.
text: WILF has entered the dining room, supported by his cane,
text: waving to others as he goes toward his table.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Exactly my point! If this
dialog: place shuts down in six months,
dialog: which it bloody well could -
dialog: (he looks at others
dialog: in the room)
dialog: I want to be able to look back
dialog: and remember I had a fucking
dialog: window seat!
text: As WILF reaches the table, a few cheers from GEORGE and
text: other chorus residents seated at their tables.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: Excuse me.
text: He moves the empty chair over and sits in it with difficulty,
text: holding his cane. HARRY goes back to his table, sits, starts
dialog: to take his pills.
speaker_heading: ANNE LANGLEY
dialog: I could have had a window seat, but
dialog: I much prefer to sit by myself.
text: CISSY, a bit unnerved, puts her earphones on.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You can’t deny it, Wilf,
dialog: soloists would be nothing
dialog: without us.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: If I hear that again, Harry, I
dialog: may stick a fork up your
dialog: jacksy.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (sitting next to
speaker_heading: HARRY )
dialog: He’s right, Wilf.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: Anybody got a fork?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You know he is-
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: Make that two forks.

speaker_heading: WILF (CONT'D)
dialog: Merci, Angelique. Have you done

speaker_heading: ANGELIQUE

speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: I love your fringe in front.
text: REGGIE looks up from his paper.
speaker_heading: ANGELIQUE
dialog: Extra slice fried bread this

dialog: - apricot Jam.
text: REGGIE lowers his paper and looks steelily at ANGELIQUE.
speaker_heading: ANGELIQUE (CONT'D)
dialog: Dr. Cogan she say too much of
dialog: the sugar is bad for you, but I
dialog: know you like very much. Same
dialog: for Madame Langley.
text: With a wink, she nods in the direction of ANNE LANGLEY,
text: who sits at a nearby table eating delicately.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: You’re an angel, Angelique. C’est
dialog: magnifique. Vous fancy a rumpy-
dialog: pumpy cette soiree, Angelique?
speaker_heading: ANGELIQUE
dialog: Qu’est que c’est “rumpy pumpy”?
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: Angelique, are we getting married
dialog: or not? I need your answer.
speaker_heading: ANGELIQUE
dialog: (used to it)
dialog: Bon appetit!
text: She goes. REGGIE lowers his paper, stares at her.
text: CISSY looks out of the window. CEDRIC, at the next table,
text: leans over and taps her. She removes her earphones and looks
speaker_heading: at CEDRIC.
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: Ready.
speaker_heading: CEDRIC
dialog: Cissy, remember, the emergency
text: meeting is at twelve noon.
dialog: Precisely.
text: CISSY nods, turns back, puts earphones on.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (turns to CEDRIC)
dialog: Cedric, it’s breakfast time.
text: CEDRIC motions towards CISSY’s back. He rotates his finger
text: indicating CISSY is unbalanced.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: Cedric! Chill! Hullo or
dialog: bonjour, look —
text: He points to the window. DR. COGAN is speaking urgently
text: to TADEK, as they walk past the window. TADEK carries a

speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Wilf, please.
text: Concerned that it will offend CISSY, REGGIE looks at

text: WILF’S story.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: That man could fart at will -
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Please, I’m eating my
dialog: breakfast.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: I’m not making this up Reg.
dialog: - he would get down on the

speaker_heading: REGGIE

text: CISSY sees NOBBY in the garden. WILF notices CISSY watching
speaker_heading: NOBBY.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: - and when he exhaled, it came out
dialog: as a crepitation. That’s what he
dialog: called it. What a gentleman! His

speaker_heading: WILF

speaker_heading: WILF (CONT’D)
dialog: May I tell you, Cissy, in all

speaker_heading: WILF (CONT’D)
speaker_heading: (to REGGIE)

dialog: puzzle)
dialog: You left a word out.
dialog: (states the clue - and he

text: CISSY, takes his glasses
dialog: off)
dialog: When I first saw her, God knows how
dialog: long ago, I thought she was the
dialog: most beautiful, sexiest thing I'd
dialog: ever clapped eyes on.
text: The alarm on REGGIE’S wristwatch sounds. He is about to tap
text: CISSY on the arm but WILF stops him with a look.
speaker_heading: WILF (CONT'D)
dialog: Cissy, let Reg and me have our
dialog: way with you now. Go on, bea

dialog: How about it?
speaker_heading: CISSY

speaker_heading: CISSY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: WILF

speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: Why did you interrupt me? Can’t

speaker_heading: WILF

speaker_heading: CISSY

speaker_heading: (to WILF)

speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: And thank you Reggie. I’m so

speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: Why Karachi?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Her father was Indian army.
speaker_heading: WILF

speaker_heading: REGGIE (CONT’D)

text: WILF tries vainly to get up.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: I wish they’d reissue us instead.

speaker_heading: WILF (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: - fucking apricot jam, that’s what
dialog: you had.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: (looks at CD again)
dialog: Everyone said the quartet had never
dialog: been better sung. My picture in the
dialog: Daily Mail with the caption: “Wilfred

speaker_heading: CEDRIC
dialog: (to the table)
dialog: ..-When this came out last week we

dialog: As of today, pledges from our

speaker_heading: CEDRIC (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: Bette Davis! She was the one who

speaker_heading: CEDRIC

speaker_heading: DR. COGAN
dialog: That's Sir Thomas Beecham. One of
dialog: Britain’s great conductors. The

speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: I know who Sir Thomas Beecham
dialog: was, thank you. He inherited a

text: frighteningly apt.
dialog: 25
speaker_heading: DR. COGAN
dialog: (patiently)
text: It is not a nursing home. It is

dialog: home.
text: DR. COGAN opens the second door to the MAIN HALL and
text: JEAN limps through it. They pause at the flowers.
speaker_heading: DR. COGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: These are to welcome you. I'll

speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: Yes, but what I would love to

speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (aiming)
dialog: I always wanted to sing Wagner.
dialog: Tristan. Just once. But it

speaker_heading: (DR. COGAN listens

speaker_heading: JEAN

speaker_heading: SCHOOL PUPIL

speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: That’s opera! Originally people just
dialog: like yourselves went to see Opera. But
dialog: then the rich came along and made it
dialog: something that it’s not. So what is it
dialog: then? Someone said, ‘Opera is when a
text: guy is stabbed in the back and while
dialog: he’s bleeding, he sings.'
dialog: (some school children
dialog: laugh; )
dialog: Rap is when a guy gets stabbed
text: in the back and while he’s
text: bleeding, he talks -
text: rhythmically and emotionally,
dialog: but because rap is spoken the
text: emotion is held in check. It’s
dialog: on one note.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 45
speaker_heading: REGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: ‘Why should we listen to some
dialog: old fart, giving us shit about
dialog: his art.’ In Opera, however, we
dialog: sing our feelings to the rise
text: and fall of the music. The song
dialog: sets our emotions free. OPERA
text: THEN, IS AN OUTPOURING OF ALL
text: THE EMOTIONS THAT ALL OF US
dialog: CARRY INSIDE. And...it’s

dialog: I’m seventy-nine. What’s your excuse?
dialog: When I was your age, I had the highest

text: THE SCHOOL CHILDREN laugh and applaud.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: What you’ve witnessed is the strength
text: and athleticism of an Opera singer.
dialog: The people who live here have the
dialog: superhuman effort it takes to deliver
dialog: the goods, to breathe, yes, to hold a
dialog: note —
dialog: (gestures to OCTAVIA)
dialog: - like the one Octavia just sang -

text: REGGIE smiles. He’s been talking about aging.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: .--and in that way, we’re not
dialog: the same. I’m not like you,
dialog: Wilf. I positively liked
dialog: getting old. Physical decay
dialog: has seemed natural and
dialog: inescapable. I think I can say
dialog: I've welcomed the inevitable
dialog: cheerfully. I’ve made the
dialog: transition from opera star to
text: old fart with aplomb
dialog: (beat)
text: Then Jean arrives...
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: I remember thinking when you
dialog: two got married...she was much
dialog: more ambitious than you-
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Of course she was. She was
dialog: more ambitious than all of us.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: -if I know anything about it.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: What can you know about it?
dialog: 50
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: I was your best man, Reggie.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Yes, and then you were married to
dialog: the same woman for thirty

dialog: fashioned but did she know how
dialog: often you were unfaithful to her?
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: You say some very harsh things,

dialog: unsteady. )
dialog: I think I’1l have myself a

dialog: (looks around for the
dialog: right tree, a little
dialog: tipsy)
dialog: You're right, Reg. I hate
dialog: growing old. Hate every bloody
dialog: moment of it. If it's not your
dialog: prostate, it's piles. And then
text: it's peeing five times a night.
dialog: If you’re lucky.
text: WILF steps off the Summer House and stumbles to a nearby

speaker_heading: WILF (CONT’D)
text: (shouts as he is
dialog: peeing)
dialog: You may want to avert your gaze,

text: standing at the edge, wanting to flee.
speaker_heading: WILF (CONT'D)
dialog: Easy, Reg, easy-

speaker_heading: CISSY

dialog: Didn't I say so? Didn't I say

speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Reggie, don’t I get a kiss?
dialog: (he keeps his back to
dialog: her)
dialog: Reg?
dialog: (takes a step closer)
dialog: I apologise for hurting you.
dialog: Please be kind to me. We were

dialog: I've rehearsed saying that for
dialog: the past week.
text: Brief silence. He registers what she’s saying, looks

speaker_heading: REGGIE

speaker_heading: WILF’S VOICE
dialog: I think he’s trying to tell us

speaker_heading: WILF

text: JEAN looks round and doesn’t see REGGIE.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Where’s Reg?
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: (looks down the path)
text: There he is.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (starts down the
dialog: path, calls out)
dialog: Reg! Why does he treat me like
dialog: this? It's not fair. As if I
dialog: haven't suffered enough.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: (calling out to her)
dialog: NSP, Jean, NSP.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (turns her head)
dialog: And what, for God's sake, does
dialog: that mean?
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: It’s one of our rules. In fact,

dialog: Pity.
text: She turns and walks towards REGGIE.
scene_heading: EXT. PATH WITH A VIEW - LATE AFTERNOON
text: REGGIE walking.
scene_heading: EXT. PATH WITH A VIEW - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Walking towards the Church, carrying their instruments, a
text: procession of the string quartet, BILL, lst violin, REGINA,
text: 2nd violin, FRED, viola, and LEO, cello. We can’t make out
text: the words, but there seems to be a disagreement between
text: them. SIMON and ANGELIQUE carry music stands.
text: JEAN making her way down the path, looking this way and
dialog: that. The sound of the first movement, Allegro con spirito,
text: of Haydn’s 'Sunrise' Quartet begins as she passes.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODLAND, NEAR CHURCH - LATE AFTERNOON
text: The music faintly behind her, JEAN pauses, peers about. At
text: the end of the path, is a church. JEAN takes a few steps
text: towards it, looks more closely and sees the door is ajar.
dialog: 54
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - LATE AFTERNOON
text: She looks inside, goes in, looking about. At the other end,
text: she sees REGGIE silhouetted behind a lattice screen.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Reggie? May I join you?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (vehement )
dialog: No, you may not.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: I've walked miles to find you,
dialog: Reggie.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Just leave me in peace, Jean -
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: I just want to -
text: She starts to advance.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: For Christ's sake, just leave me
dialog: in peace! Leave! Leave!
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: Reggie!
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I said leave!
text: Emotional, about to leave, doesn’t. She sits at the edge of
text: a pew. From afar, the strains of the Haydn quartet.
text: REGGIE finally walks over to her, stands a short distance
text: away. After a long pause, he relents, and hands her a
text: spotless white handkerchief. She dabs at her eyes and nose.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (smelling the
dialog: handkerchief)
dialog: Pino Silvestre. I didn't know
dialog: you could still buy it.
text: (dabs her nose, then
text: aware of him gazing at
dialog: her)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I can't ever remember you crying.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: I didn’t know you’d become
dialog: religious.
dialog: 55
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I haven't. I was simply trying to
dialog: avoid you.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (handkerchief to her nose)
dialog: My mother taught me never to let
dialog: others see I was hurt.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Your mother knew all about hiding her
dialog: feelings. It was easy for her. She
dialog: didn't have any.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Don't be unkind about her.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I liked your father. When he heard
dialog: that you'd left me, he telephoned and
dialog: said, ‘Sorry, old chap, but count your
dialog: blessings. I'm still married to her
dialog: mother.’
text: REGGIE moves towards the door. Brief pause.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: I apologise for hurting you.
dialog: Please be kind to me. We were
dialog: different people then. There.
dialog: I've been rehearsing saying that
dialog: for the past week.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (close to the door)
dialog: You've said it before. You're
dialog: repeating yourself.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (thinks )
dialog: Oh God.
dialog: (brief silence)
dialog: Why do we have to grow old?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Because that’s what people do.
text: A brief silence.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: What I did was unforgiveable -
dialog: but I was young and foolish.

dialog: to the door)
dialog: Reggie, we have to come to some
dialog: arrangement.
speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: JEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: We can't keep avoiding each other
dialog: or, worse, bickering like
dialog: children every time we meet -
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (at door, interrupting)
dialog: Jean, I don't want to talk about
dialog: it. I don’t want to re-live
dialog: ancient history. You're here. I'm
dialog: here. Trapped. That's all there
dialog: is to it.
text: Silence but for the distant music.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: What are we going to do?
text: He broods for a moment. Then:
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: There’s always the cliché button.
dialog: The one that says, 'Grin and bear
dialog: it.'
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: How about trying the one that
dialog: says ‘forgive and forget' - ?
text: (REGGIE shakes his head;
dialog: she again smells the
dialog: handkerchief)
text: The same cologne. The smell takes
dialog: me back.
dialog: (looks away)
dialog: It takes me back to you, Reg -
text: Though trying not to, REGGIE looks at her.

dialog: 57
speaker_heading: CEDRIC
dialog: I’ve changed my mind. I don’t think

speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What do you mean, it’s not

speaker_heading: CEDRIC
dialog: Exactly what I say.
text: GEORGE and HARRY start to leave, GEORGE turns -—
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Sorry, Cedric. I just want to be
dialog: clear on one thing. You once said
dialog: you sang the title roll in Julius
dialog: Caesar at Covent Garden.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: We can’t find any record of it.
speaker_heading: CEDRIC
dialog: (flustered)
dialog: I didn't say I sang Giulio CH-
dialog: sare, I said I was considered for
dialog: it.
text: A giggle or two from eavesdropping residents seated in the
dialog: music room.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Right. Well you’ve considered us
dialog: and, unlike you, we’re singing it.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah, we’re singing it.

speaker_heading: CEDRIC
dialog: Have you asked Reggie to sing La

speaker_heading: CISSY

speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: -+.- No, I was only married twice after

dialog: 61
speaker_heading: JEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: He was a business man who mixed

dialog: was that.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You never married ... again?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: No, I didn’t want to anymore.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: When I signed on to do Romeo and

speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: And when I played Aida, did you

speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JEAN

dialog: I have - financial problems. All
dialog: I have now are my clothes and
dialog: jewelry.
speaker_heading: (nothing from REGGIE)
dialog: - and I didn’t confide in anyone
dialog: because I just didn’t want any
dialog: fuss. Quite frankly, I was
dialog: embarrassed. You know what the
dialog: media are like. They were always
dialog: beastly to me and if they learned
dialog: I'd ended up here, they'd gloat.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (a little acid)
dialog: Really? I’m surprised the media
dialog: still has any interest in you.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Oh, do piss off, Reggie, there’s
dialog: a dear. As a matter of fact, and
dialog: this will obviously surprise you

dialog: The other night, I was Sir

speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (they walk, zings back)
dialog: What do you do when you’re not

speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: If I need to tire myself, I think

speaker_heading: REGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Bitch!
dialog: (JEAN is alarmed)
dialog: See her? See her, there she goes,
dialog: Angelique, see her? See her?
dialog: (not shouting, but loud)
dialog: Bitch, cow, sodding frog!
text: oblivious, some distance off, wanders on through
text: in and out of dappled light, towards the glade.
speaker_heading: REGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: She won't give me marmalade at

dialog: jam.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: You hate apricot jam.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: But Wilf loves it, she does it
dialog: deliberately.
dialog: (a little louder)
dialog: Bitch! Cow! Skinny-arse French
dialog: twat!
dialog: (without pause turns
text: back to JEAN as if
dialog: nothing has interrupted
dialog: him)
dialog: Art is my chief preoccupation,
dialog: Jean, its meaning, its
dialog: significance, its ability to
dialog: educate and enthrall, to inspire
dialog: and civilise.
text: REGGIE takes a book from his jacket pocket.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (ironic)
dialog: So you do a lot of reading.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Yes, I do a lot of reading. You
dialog: might want to look at this.
text: He turns to a page. She takes the book and begins to read.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: “Works of art are of an infinite
dialog: loneliness and nothing can reach them
dialog: so little as criticism. Only love can
text: grasp them and keep hold of them and
dialog: be just to them.”
text: She looks up at him. Pauses, and shares with him something
dialog: quite private -
dialog: 64
speaker_heading: JEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: It was after I had passed my peak -
dialog: that the pressure became huge. And I
dialog: was so aware of criticism and the
dialog: importance of getting a good
dialog: review...the next thing has to be as
dialog: good or better and of course it can’t
dialog: be, so in the end you get very
dialog: nervous.
text: They are closer than they have been since they met. Very
dialog: close.
text: Suddenly, they hear a noise. JEAN and REGGIE look
text: around. Behind a hedge they see a startled ANGELIQUE and
text: SIMON quickly gathering up a blanket. They both stand,

speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: Where is this going, Cedric?
speaker_heading: CEDRIC
dialog: I'll cut to the chase. I have a
dialog: brilliant suggestion. Since the
dialog: four of you are here together
dialog: again, I put it to you, that you
dialog: should perform - at - the - gala -
dialog: (dramatic pauses)
dialog: - the quartet from Rigoletto.
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: (gasps) |
dialog: That’s amazing. I’ve been listening
dialog: to us, Rig -
speaker_heading: CEDRIC
dialog: (cuts her off)
dialog: Think of the publicity, The Times,
dialog: The Telegraph, Opera Today. We have
dialog: four of the finest singers in
dialog: English operatic history. We’d more
dialog: than sell out.
dialog: 65
dialog: Silence. Then:
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: (quietly to REGGIE)
dialog: We all know the bloody thing, we
dialog: won't have to rehearse that much.
speaker_heading: CISSY
text: But Jean won’t sing in the gala.
speaker_heading: CEDRIC
dialog: Oh, but you must change her mind.
dialog: She’s a huge draw. It would be as
dialog: if Maria Callas were making a come-
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I’m not sure I want to sing with
dialog: Jean again.
speaker_heading: CEDRIC
dialog: (looks at others)
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: They were married, but it didn’t -
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: No- Cissy, leave it out. No, I
dialog: don’t want to.
speaker_heading: CEDRIC
speaker_heading: (studies REGGIE)
dialog: Well, it’s a shame. I can’t count
dialog: the number of galas you have graced
dialog: over the years with your
dialog: incomparable voice, and I mean that
dialog: sincerely. I don’t think you
dialog: realize it Reggie, but people still
dialog: talk about your ‘Celeste Aida’ four
dialog: years ago. Your ‘Ave Maria’ two
dialog: years ago.
speaker_heading: (REGGIE beginning to
dialog: weaken)
dialog: I know you don’t think much of me,
dialog: Reggie, that’s fine, but for what
dialog: it’s worth, when I heard you sing
dialog: your ‘Nessun Dorma’ at the gala
dialog: last year, all I thought was ‘Eat
dialog: your heart out, Pavarotti!’
speaker_heading: (REGGIE weakening more)
dialog: With this one concert, we could
dialog: raise enough money to get us
dialog: through and attract much needed new
dialog: benefactors. You would help save
dialog: Beecham House, Reginald.
dialog: (meaningfully)

dialog: Well, I must leave. At any rate, I

speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: (trying to be off-hand)
dialog: It’s one gala, Reg. You could do
dialog: it. You could persuade Jean. I know

speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (looks at WILF, says
dialog: wryly)
dialog: Well, money has always driven art.
text: He takes out his notebook and pen.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: One gala. It’s our life.
speaker_heading: REGGIE

speaker_heading: WILF

speaker_heading: WILF

speaker_heading: DR. COGAN
dialog: What’s the second favour?
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: Guess.
speaker_heading: DR. COGAN

dialog: Lucy.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: Yes, for starters.
speaker_heading: DR. COGAN
dialog: I'm not sure I want those in my

speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: Try it and see.
dialog: 69
speaker_heading: DR. COGAN
dialog: Why do you persist in flirting
dialog: with me?
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: Because you're a cracker, Lucy.
dialog: Not a bird, not a girl, not a
dialog: bimbo, but a rare species, a
dialog: real woman.
speaker_heading: DR. COGAN
dialog: (starts to rise)
dialog: I'm flattered, but I have
dialog: professional ethics to uphold.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: Throw caution to the winds,
dialog: Lucy. If we were to - how shall
dialog: I put it? - make magnificent
dialog: music together, I would never
dialog: report you -
speaker_heading: DR. COGAN
dialog: (ushering him to the door)
dialog: That is reassuring, Wilf.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: (rising)
dialog: Think about it, Lucy.
speaker_heading: DR. COGAN
dialog: No, Wilf.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: A weekend in London?

dialog: (to WILF, sotto voce)
text: She looks - fairly all rightish.
text: As JEAN walks to the top of the stairs.
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: You look lovely, Jean -
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: You give new meaning to the word
dialog: ‘chic’. You agree, Reg?
text: REGGIE forces a smile.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Thank you. This is so - so very
dialog: kind of you.
dialog: 71
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: It’s the least we can do.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: The very least.
text: JEAN, at the top of the stairs, pauses, looks down as REGGIE
text: reads her mind. He bounds up the stairs and offers his arm.
scene_heading: EXT. BEECHAM HOUSE - NIGHT
text: They all get into the van - it leaves.
scene_heading: INT. THE SWAN - BAR AREA - NIGHT
text: LARS, 40's, Danish male, leads JEAN, REGGIE, WILF and
text: CISSY through the dining area, crowded with patrons. The
text: quartet seems out of place, dressed in the fashion of
dialog: the 70's.
text: As LARS leads them to their table.
speaker_heading: LARS
dialog: This way, Mr. Bond. We have
dialog: your table ready and a bottle
text: of the house red and a bottle
dialog: of the house white, just as you
dialog: asked.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: Thank you, Lars. Quick as you
dialog: can.
text: The four walk out of shot to the booth.
scene_heading: INT. THE SWAN —- DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: WILF, tipsy, finishes a bottle by topping up their
text: glasses as they are about to finish their main courses.
text: A WAITER puts more bottles on the table, takes the empty
text: ones, and leaves.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: A toast! To you, Jean. From all
dialog: of us. Welcome.
text: They clink glasses to JEAN - she looks at them warmly.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: You have to make eye contact when
dialog: you clink or else it’s bad luck.
dialog: 72
text: They re-clink their glasses, making eye contact.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: Cheers!
text: While they finish their main course:
speaker_heading: CISSY
text: (staring at JEAN, a
dialog: bit in her cups)
dialog: Jean, do you listen to your old
dialog: recordings?
text: Before JEAN can answer.
speaker_heading: CISSY (CONT'D)
dialog: I listen to us a lot. As a matter
dialog: of fact, they wanted Reggie to sing
dialog: La donna @ mobile for the Gala. But
dialog: now, Jean, it's so exciting they
dialog: want us —
text: WILF puts a restraining hand on CISSY'S arm.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (jumping in)
dialog: “La donna @ mobile qual plumo
dialog: al vento.” Women are as fickle
text: as a feather in the wind.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (she eats and drinks,
dialog: ignoring the
dialog: inference)
dialog: I fell in love with you when I
dialog: first heard you sing that.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (he sips wine)
dialog: That’s why I never sang it
dialog: again. I took twelve curtain
dialog: calls.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: You took nine, I took twelve.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Who’s counting?
text: JEAN eyes him, eating and drinking. WILF refills her
text: glass, but JEAN remains stone cold sober. The others do
dialog: not.
dialog: 73
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: The other night, at the opera
dialog: house, as Sir George's guest I
text: received a standing ovation.
dialog: Wasn't that something?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Now you're doing it again.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (rather tiddly)
dialog: Repeating yourself. But what's it
dialog: matter? In opera, we repeat
dialog: ourselves all the time, repeat,
dialog: repeat, repeat ourselves-—
dialog: (WILF joins in)
dialog: -ourselves, ourselves,
dialog: (in Italian)
dialog: - ci ripetiamo, ci ripetiamo,
dialog: continuamente -
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: You’re both drunk.
text: REGGIE nods yes.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: Si, perché no. E Adesso...
dialog: (A toast to the quartet in
dialog: Italian)
dialog: Un brindisi al quartetto
text: Everyone raising their glasses.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (as they are toasting)
dialog: What quartet?
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: Cheers!
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: Cedric wants us to sing at Verdi's
dialog: Birthday Gala -
dialog: (put his hand out to JEAN)
dialog: - wait for it, wait for it -
text: Pregnant pause. WILF nods to REGGIE. Then:
speaker_heading: REGGIE & WILF
dialog: (in Italian)
dialog: - il quartetto dal Rigoletto.
dialog: 74
text: They smile crookedly. Expressionless, JEAN looks shocked.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: (tipsy)
dialog: That means the quartet from
dialog: Rigoletto.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: What a damn fool idea.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: It’s a great honour, Jean.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: A great honour?
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: She said a great honour! She
dialog: agreed! She’s legless!
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: No, I’m not legless. I haven’t
dialog: agreed to anything. And don't talk
dialog: about me as if I'm not here.
dialog: (she looks at all of them)
dialog: This is why you asked me to dinner.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: No, we asked you because -
text: He breaks off.
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: - because we love you.
text: They avert her gaze.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Let me ask you something? When did you
dialog: last sing? This morning in the bath?
dialog: In the shower? Has anyone heard you
dialog: recently? Have you any idea of the
dialog: noise you now make? Do you really want
dialog: to be a laughing stock? Why didn’t
dialog: you have the guts to just tell me what
dialog: you wanted? How shameful of you to try
dialog: to trick me. You’re pathetic.
text: JEAN rises and walks out.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: Whoops.
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: Does that mean yes?
dialog: 75
scene_heading: EXT. THE SWAN - NIGHT
text: JEAN marches from the pub. NOBBY exits the van and
text: stands by the car door.
speaker_heading: NOBBY
dialog: D'you have a good time?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: No. Open the door.
scene_heading: INT. THE SWAN - NIGHT
text: After a moment, WILF, REGGIE and CISSY begin to walk unsteadily
text: through the restaurant. WILF tries to pick a flower from a vase
text: and ends up toppling the vase, spilling the water.
speaker_heading: led WILF
dialog: (walking away)
dialog: I think I spilled,
text: WILF goes to leave, CISSY is ahead. They pass a television in
text: the bar. CISSY continues on but something catches WILF and
text: REGGIE'S eyes and they stop: A RAP GROUP singing but there is,
dialog: of course, no sound.
speaker_heading: WILF (CONT’D)
dialog: What d'you think they're singing, Reg?
dialog: After a moment:
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Il quartetto da Rigoletto.
text: Angle from the back of WILF and REGGIE - we see WILF is
text: gesturing, imitating the rap group.
scene_heading: EXT. THE SWAN - NIGHT
text: JEAN stares through the van window as WILF and REGGIE start
text: to stagger out of the restaurant.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: (raps in an English
dialog: accent)
dialog: .-.and I’m gonna live to be a
dialog: hundred, And I can tell you why,
dialog: (measures up with his arm)
dialog: ‘Cos I can still get it up - oh so
dialog: high!
speaker_heading: REGGIE
text: (gestures with his arm,
dialog: but much lower)
text: He can still get it up - but not so
dialog: high.
dialog: 1 eed
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Yo, yo, oh so high.
dialog: 76
speaker_heading: NOBBY
dialog: (calling from the van)
dialog: Sorry to interrupt Gents, but Miss
dialog: Horton would like to go back.
text: The van’s engine starts.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Yo, yo, yo, not so high.
text: WILF, REGGIE and CISSY stagger to the people carrier and
dialog: get in.
scene_heading: INT. PEOPLE CARRIER (TRAVELLING) - NIGHT
text: JEAN sits on the right side, staring out of the window.
text: On the left side, REGGIE is staring out of his window,
text: trying to stay awake. WILF and CISSY are asleep.
scene_heading: INT. JEAN'S ROOM - NIGHT - RAIN
text: 33 RPM record coming out of sleeve and onto a turntable.
text: Close up of the needle hitting the record.
text: JEAN is silhouetted, sitting, listening, following almost
text: soundlessly to her aria from Madama Butterfly, “Un Bel Di
dialog: Vedremo.”
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - NEXT DAY BREAKFAST, MORNING
text: JEAN enters the dining room in her dressing gown and
text: walks up to the table.
dialog: 77
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Why didn’t you just come out with it -
dialog: instead of this charade of taking me
dialog: to dinner. Why didn’t you just say,
dialog: you wanted us, average age hundred and
text: ninety-eight, singing the quarter from
dialog: Rigoletto? An honour? It’s not an
dialog: honour? It’s not an honour, it’s
dialog: insanity. What you did was
dialog: disgusting. All of you!
dialog: (turning on REGGIE)
dialog: I’m going to say something very
dialog: rude to you - Fuck you, fuck you
dialog: Reginald Paget.
text: JEAN turns and walks out.
text: As CISSY, REGGIE and WILF try to adjust, aware of people
text: in the dining room staring. One of them looks out the
text: window and sees paramedics wheeling a gurney carrying
text: OLLY, with DR. COGAN following. She has words with the
text: paramedics and then turns. She walks towards the dining
text: room and enters.
speaker_heading: DR. COGAN
dialog: I just want to say that it
dialog: seems Olly isn’t well...it’s
dialog: his recurring condition. But he
dialog: will be checked and he’s going
dialog: to be fine.
text: People in the room look at each other. Focus on WILF,
text: REGGIE and CISSY, who starts to put her earphones on.
text: As DR. COGAN leaves we hear -
speaker_heading: HARRY’S VOICE
dialog: Tell me, what are you doing in
dialog: London?
speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE
dialog: London? I’m here looking for work.
speaker_heading: HARRY’S VOICE
dialog: Work?
speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE
dialog: Work.
speaker_heading: HARRY’S VOICE
dialog: In London? Heh Heh.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Just a leetle bit!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (posh)
dialog: Hey Mister, with everything in
dialog: life, I just would like to ask you
dialog: one question.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Why you silly so-and-so. With all
dialog: your dough.
text: GEORGE and HARRY continue to sing Flanagan & Allen’s - “Are
text: You Havin’ Any Fun” with TONY ROSE on Trumpet and DAVE on
dialog: piano.
text: Through the window, we see -
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN - DAY
text: CISSY, NOBBY and SIMON picking flowers. CISSY walks away
text: with a large bundle of flowers.
scene_heading: INT. JEAN'S ROOM - DAY
text: Close up of JEAN’s face.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Go away! Go away!
text: CISSY, standing in the open doorway, holding flowers.
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: It's me, Jean. Cissy.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: I said go away!
text: CISSY insists, holding the flowers. She comes a few steps
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: But I’ve brought you a present,
dialog: these are beautiful Iceberg
dialog: roses.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Get out!
dialog: 79
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: Nobby has never allowed them to
dialog: be picked before.
dialog: (smiling, hopeful)
dialog: You see, I just want to talk to
dialog: you about the Quartet, it’s such
dialog: a good -
text: JEAN, out of her chair, grabs some of the flowers from
speaker_heading: CISSY.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Get out! Leave me alone you
dialog: stupid cow!
scene_heading: INT. MAIN HALL LANDING - DAY
text: CISSY, stunned, turns to run out the door as JEAN throws
text: flowers at her. Covering her ears and eyes closed, she
text: collides with a STAFF PERSON carrying a tray of glasses.
text: She falls down near the railing. Alarmed faces from below
text: look up. The remaining flowers float down to the ground.
scene_heading: INT. SANITORIUM - NIGHT
text: A dimly lit room. Empty beds except for one that has
text: screens partially concealing the patient. SHERYL, the
text: nurse, in attendance.
text: CIsSsy, in bed, subdued, but smiling bravely. REGGIE and
text: WILF sit either side.
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: I don't know why everyone is
dialog: making such a fuss. I'm sure
dialog: she didn't mean it.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Jean always means it.
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: Does she? Oh, dear. It's so
dialog: hard always trying to see the
dialog: good in people. Maybe she’s
text: just depressed.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Do you feel up to telling us
dialog: what happened?
text: SHERYL comes to her bedside and takes her pulse.
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: (groggy )
dialog: She threw something at me.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: What did she throw?
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: I think the heat is getting to
dialog: her. I really do think she'll
dialog: find it cooler in Simla.
text: WILF, REGGIE and SHERYL exchange looks.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Very likely.
text: DR. COGAN enters.
speaker_heading: DR. COGAN
dialog: I hope you haven't let them
dialog: stay too long, Sheryl-
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: No, Dr. Cogan -
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (aside, to DR. COGAN)
dialog: She'll be all right, will she?
speaker_heading: DR. COGAN
dialog: Yes, of course. Just a little
dialog: shocked, that's all. We'll keep
dialog: her overnight.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: You'll be fine in the morning
dialog: won't you, my darling?
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: Thank you, Sheryl.
speaker_heading: (to WILF)
dialog: Such a dear girl. Beautifully
dialog: endowed, don't you think?
text: WILF smiles. DR. COGAN gestures REGGIE and WILF to
text: leave. She beckons SHERYL to the table near the door and
text: looks at her notes.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: (indicates an empty
dialog: bed, quietly)
dialog: I say, Lucy, I see you have an
dialog: empty bed. You wouldn't like to
dialog: keep me in overnight, would
dialog: you? I feel a headache coming
dialog: on.
dialog: 81
speaker_heading: DR. COGAN
dialog: She needs her sleep. Come back
dialog: tomorrow.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: (as he’s leaving)
dialog: It’s a shame to let it go to
dialog: waste.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN HALL LANDING - NIGHT
text: REGGIE and WILF walk down the corridor towards the
dialog: stairs.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: Remember Barber of Seville in
dialog: the sixties at Covent Garden.
dialog: Who was that big mezzo-soprano
dialog: who was doing it with that
text: little tenor in the bathtub.
dialog: She got suctioned in. What was
dialog: her name?
dialog: (no answer from
speaker_heading: REGGIE)
dialog: In London, remember? The little
dialog: guy couldn’t get her out.
text: REGGIE still doesn’t answer, but smiles. They reach the
text: top of the stairs.
speaker_heading: WILF (CONT’D)
dialog: She was Italian. Remember? The
dialog: tenor had to dial 999.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (reluctantly)
dialog: Beatrice Botticelli.
text: At that moment they see JEAN'S head come into view
text: slowly as she’s ascending the stairs.
speaker_heading: JEAN
text: (as she reaches the top
dialog: of the stairs)
dialog: How is she?
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: She'll be fine.
text: (She walks past them;
dialog: they start down the
dialog: stairs)
dialog: You're right, Beatrice
dialog: Botticelli.
dialog: (slowly going out of
dialog: view)
dialog: They say her high notes were
dialog: never the same.
dialog: 82
scene_heading: INT. SANITORIUM - NIGHT
text: SHERYL is at the foot of CISSY'S bed, reading notes.
speaker_heading: JEAN enters.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Sorry, Miss Horton, she's
dialog: sleeping.
text: JEAN hesitates.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Will you be sure she knows I
dialog: came to see her?
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Yes, of course.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: I‘1l come back in the morning.
text: JEAN turns to go. From behind the screen:
speaker_heading: A VOICE
dialog: Jean? Is that you?
text: JEAN is taken aback.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Who’s that?
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Mr. White.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (amazed)
dialog: Frank White? May I see him?
scene_heading: BEHIND THE SCREENS
text: FRANK WHITE, a once dazzlingly handsome man, in his late
text: 70's, and somewhat frail, lies in bed as JEAN comes
text: round the screens.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I thought I recognised your
dialog: voice.
dialog: (a smile)
dialog: As who could not?
dialog: Just one of my spells. Nothing
dialog: serious. But I won't be taking
text: part in the gala.
text: (he gazes fondly at
dialog: her)
dialog: You're still very lovely, Jean.
dialog: 83
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: I had no idea you were here. I
dialog: would have visited you.
dialog: (lovingly)
dialog: Dear, dear Frank.
dialog: (sits beside the bed)
dialog: How are you?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Thank you.
text: (she takes his hand;
dialog: they smile.)
dialog: What a fling we had.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Yes, what a fling, indeed.
text: Short but giddy.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: And that luxurious hotel.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: I don't remember the hotel. I
dialog: remember you rushing off and
dialog: not seeing you for days on end.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yes, but you never guessed.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Never guessed what?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You remember Enrico Cardinale?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: The baritone? Of course I
dialog: remember him. I had a fling
text: with him, too.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: So did I. At the same time as I
dialog: was having you.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: No! Did you, Frank?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I certainly did.
dialog: (they laugh then look
text: lovingly at each
dialog: other)
dialog: And you've been up to your
dialog: usual tricks.
dialog: (nods to CISSY in the
dialog: other room)
dialog: I heard it all from Cissy.
dialog: 84
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: I don't know what came over me.
dialog: I'm very ashamed but I'm so
dialog: unhappy here and -
text: Her voice trails off.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Poor Cissy. She does so want to
dialog: perform the quartet.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Not possible.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (studies her)
dialog: A word of advice. Take part. If
dialog: you can't sing at the gala, do
text: conjuring tricks. The only
dialog: alternative is to be the guest
text: of honour at the crematorium.
text: His words touch and trouble her.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN - MORNING - RAIN
text: NOBBY comes out of a store holding an umbrella and packages.
text: Wrapping paper is sticking out of one of the packages.
dialog: Overlap Barber of Seville.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN HALL/MAIN HALL LANDING - MORNING
text: NOBBY continues past the Common Room. In the background,
text: REGGIE, WILF, BOBBY and CISSY rehearsing BARBER OF
text: SEVILLE. He continues to JEAN’S room and knocks. She
text: answers, takes the packages, thanks him, gives him a
dialog: note and some money. She says a few words to him that we
text: don’t hear, as she closes the door.
scene_heading: INT. COMMON ROOM - MORNING
text: BOBBY, WILF and REGGIE are following a score. On TV is
dialog: The Barber of Seville which they are, at times,
text: watching. CISSY is sitting behind them.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Are you sure about this,
dialog: Wilfred?
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: It’s the only trio we can think of,
dialog: Bobby. The three of us did the
dialog: Barber of Seville a dozen times.
dialog: 85
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: It’s your decision. Now, let’s
dialog: see-
dialog: (scanning the score)
dialog: You'll each need at least six
dialog: sessions -
dialog: Panic:
speaker_heading: REGGIE & WILF
dialog: Six?
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: We don’t have the time -
text: They look up to see NOBBY come into the room. He hands the
text: note to REGGIE as he whispers something.
scene_heading: INT. JEAN'S ROOM - MORNING - RAIN
text: JEAN is seated rather regally. WILF, REGGIE and CISSY are
text: standing just inside the door, before her. They exchange
text: silent looks.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Please sit.
text: CISSY looks for a chair, vainly, and then sits on the edge
text: of the bed. WILF, seeing no chair, up-ends a low wastepaper-
text: bin and sits on it as REGGIE goes around the bed and sits
text: in the chair by the dresser.
text: They sit.
speaker_heading: JEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (gestures)
dialog: Wilf, you can sit on the bed.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: I'm fine. I eat all my meals
text: sitting on wastepaper-bins.
dialog: 86
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (ignores his comment)
dialog: First of all - again, I want to
dialog: apologise to you, Cissy. What I
dialog: did was appalling. And to you,
dialog: Wilf.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: I don’t remember you throwing
dialog: anything at me.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Please don’t make fun of me. And
dialog: to you, Reggie.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I think it is I who should
dialog: apologise to you, Jean.
text: Their eyes meet. Finally she rises, goes to a side table,
text: on top of which there are some poorly wrapped gifts.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: I have gifts for you.
text: She picks them up hands one to CISSY, one to WILF and walks
text: around the bed and gives the third to REGGIE. She returns
text: to her regal chair and sits.
speaker_heading: JEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Well. Open them.
text: CISSY tears open her package. WILF hold his badly wrapped
text: gift out by one or two fingers.
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: A CD of our Rigoletto! How
dialog: lovely.
text: WILF smiles ironically.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: I know you already have copies,
dialog: but I've signed those. So that
dialog: makes them rather valuable.
text: WILF resists a comment.
speaker_heading: JEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I also wrapped them myself.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: I was thinking you did.
text: JEAN ignores WILF, looks at REGGIE who has just opened his
text: gift, a jar of lime marmalade and looks up at JEAN. He is
text: moved. Their eyes meet.
dialog: 87
text: From somewhere, the sound of a violin playing Massenet’s
text: Meditation from Thais, to the accompaniment of a harp.
text: There is an awkward silence.
speaker_heading: WILF (CONT'D)
dialog: (looks at others)
dialog: Is that it?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Yes.
text: WILF rises awkwardly from his perch and moves to the door.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: (at door)
dialog: Thanks for the signed CD. Do you
dialog: mind if we put them on eBay?
text: Another awkward pause. WILF and REGGIE exchange shared looks.
text: CISSY, still seated on the bed, looks in her purse.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (rises)
dialog: Thank you for coming.
text: CISSY, rises, confused, takes out earphones attempts to
text: untangle them.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: C’mon Cissy.
text: CISSY goes toward WILF. REGGIE stands by his chair.
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: (still untangling
dialog: earphones )
dialog: Have you changed your mind about
dialog: the gala?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (emphatic)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: (a slow burn)
dialog: Of course you haven’t. Why should
dialog: you? It’s only to celebrate and
dialog: honour the birthday of one of the
dialog: greatest composers for the human
dialog: voice who has ever lived.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: You must understand that I was
dialog: somebody once -
dialog: 88
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: (still untangling)
dialog: I thought I was somebody now -
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: But to be honest, I shone the
text: brightest in the firmament.
text: WILF murmurs a Gaelic curse. JEAN realizes she’s gone too
dialog: far.
speaker_heading: JEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I cannot insult the memory of who
dialog: I once was.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: (explodes )
dialog: “The memory?” What do you mean “the
dialog: memory?” Whose “memory?” Your fans?
dialog: They’re dead. They’re all dead!
dialog: Either that or they’re living here
dialog: and soon will be.
text: REGGIE holds a hand out to stop WILF.
speaker_heading: WILF (CONT'D)
dialog: For Christ sake Jean, all you've
dialog: ever done is to rely on external
dialog: affirmation. And look what it cost
dialog: you. Just fucking do it!
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: What you refuse to understand is
dialog: that I’m a different person today.
speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: No, you’re not. Nor are we. We've
dialog: aged, that’s all. And it happened
dialog: so fast, we didn’t have time to
dialog: change. In spirit, I’m the same
dialog: lovely lad I always was. I just
dialog: happen to be trapped in a cage made
dialog: of rusty iron bars, with, thank the
dialog: lord, an undiminished level of
dialog: testosterone.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: I simply can’t.
dialog: (all eyes on her; barely
dialog: audible)
dialog: My gift deserted me.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: It deserted us, too, Jean. It’s

speaker_heading: (looks at REGGIE)
dialog: Yes. Shit happens.
speaker_heading: CISSY

speaker_heading: JEAN

text: All smile.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Let go, Jean, let go. There’s no

dialog: enjoy it. We’re artists aren’t we?
dialog: And we're meant to celebrate life.
dialog: What else were we doing for all
dialog: those years?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Oh Christ, Reggie. Are you telling
dialog: me to go out and smell the roses?
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: Oh - the roses are long gone. But
text: the chrysanthemums are
dialog: extraordinary.
text: It breaks the tension.
speaker_heading: CISSY (CONT'D)
dialog: Please, Jean. If you say yes,
dialog: Cedric will give us the star spot
text: instead of Anne Langley.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (suddenly alert)
dialog: Anne Langley? Here at Beecham
dialog: house? I thought they’d committed
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: She wanted to sing Violetta. She
dialog: was a very fine Violetta.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Oh please, Cissy, Violetta is
dialog: supposed to be dying of
dialog: tuberculosis. Anne Langley looked
text: as if she was singing Falstaff
dialog: and she sounded like a cat hang
dialog: gliding.
speaker_heading: CISSY
text: Well, she’s singing Tosca now.
dialog: We would have the Finale, Jean!

speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Tosca?
speaker_heading: CISSY

speaker_heading: JEAN

speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (amused and surprised)
dialog: Not you, too, Cissy? What a busy
dialog: boy he must have been.
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: Yes and very potent.
text: They smile at each other. CISSY is doing up the hooks on the

speaker_heading: CISSY (CONT'D)
dialog: How long were you married to
dialog: Reggie?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Not for very long.
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: How long?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Exactly nine hours.
text: CISSY finishes JEAN’S hooks and starts to put on her own
dialog: dress.
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: Nine hours. How long did you know
dialog: each other?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Before we were married, we had
dialog: been, how shall I put it,
dialog: passionate, if you know what I
dialog: mean?
dialog: 102
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: (wistfully)
dialog: Oh, I do, I do.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: After about a year, he got down on
dialog: his knees and asked me to marry
dialog: him. He was very old-fashioned, you
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: He still is.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Yes, he is. So I agreed and a
dialog: date was fixed. But then we had to
dialog: change it because I got a job at La
dialog: Scala. And there I met- I met -
text: She hesitates.
text: Gilbert and Sullivan enter the Common Room, exhilarated.
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: Go on, go on, I’m breathless, who
dialog: was it?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: No names, no arias. It was
dialog: nothing serious- just- just one
text: night - with an Italian tenor.
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: Just one night?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Two. They never take no for an
dialog: answer. Anyway, Reggie and I were
dialog: eventually married at three o’clock
dialog: on a Sunday afternoon in May. My
dialog: father gave us a suite at the Savoy
dialog: Hotel. We were to spend the night
dialog: there and then go to Paris the next
dialog: morning for our honeymoon. We had a
text: champagne supper. Scrambled eggs,
text: toast and lime marmalade. And then
dialog: I blurted it out. I told him I'd
dialog: been unfaithful when I sang at La
dialog: Scala.
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: You didn’t!
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: I did.
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: Why? Why did you tell him?
dialog: 103
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: I don’t know. I just did. I felt
dialog: the need to be honest.
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: That’s always a mistake.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Reggie demanded to know why I
dialog: didn’t cancel the wedding. He was
dialog: very angry...
text: She breaks off.
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: And he walked out.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: No, he ran.
speaker_heading: CISSY
text: But he was heartbroken, Jean, by
dialog: your confession, because you'd been
dialog: unfaithful -
text: After a moment, JEAN nods, wearily, resigned.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Yes, yes, I know that now. I was
text: young and impetuous and driven.
dialog: (beat - lost in thought)
dialog: I was afraid of us. I had my
dialog: career.
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: That’s why you cheated?
dialog: 104
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: No. That's why I told him.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And that was the mistake of my
text: life. And now it’s too late.
speaker_heading: CISSY
dialog: You still have your future.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: I don’t think there’s a lot of it -

scene_heading: INT. COMMON ROOM - DAY
text: GEORGE, HARRY, TONY and DAVE finish “Underneath the

speaker_heading: SIMON

dialog: getting near?
speaker_heading: REGGIE

speaker_heading: WILF
dialog: I’m not sure I can either. But
