scene_heading: MED. SHOT DOOR OF A HOUSE
text: A cheap residential district. The house has no architectural
text: character; it is not certain where we are. Near the entrance
text: door is a garbage can, full.
text: A dog is nibbling at some of the garbage. We hear whistling,
text: footsteps. A garbage man comes into the picture. He shoos
text: the dog away. Without pause in whistling, he lifts the
text: garbage can and, followed by camera, goes to the end of the
text: block, which is only a few steps. Now we discover we are in
text: Venice. In the background is a major canal and a typical
text: bridge--romantic background. Gondolas are passing. In the
text: foreground at the sidewalk is the garbage gondola, piled
text: high with garbage. The man dumps his load, leaves the empty
text: can on the sidewalk, gets in the gondola, and paddles away
text: with the grace of a gondolier. Now, in a beautiful tenor
text: voice which is quite a contrast to the garbage, he starts
text: singing a passionate Italian love song.
dialog: 
scene_heading: LONG SHOT A GONDOLA
text: Two tourists. Husband and wife. They are in a sentimental
text: embrace. In back is the gondolier. Camera follows gondola
text: a few seconds, coming closer.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANOTHER GONDOLA
text: Camera shoots down. Gondola is covered by a typical little
text: canopy, so that gondolier cannot see the passengers. Camera
text: cuts canopy on one side so that we don't see, at first, who
text: is paddling. In the gondola seat is a woman in evening gown,
text: lots of jewels. She lies in the arms of the gondolier. They
text: kiss. Camera moves up and discovers who is paddling the
text: boat. It is the husband of the lady who is having such a
text: good time with the gondolier. Husband is in tuxedo and
text: straw hat, smoking a long cigar. He is enjoying it like a
text: child with a new toy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUSBAND
dialog: Darling!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WIFE'S VOICE
dialog: Yes, sweetheart.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUSBAND
dialog: What a canal!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDEWALK
text: in front of the hotel. Camera shoots down from the hotel on
text: the sidewalk, including part of sidewalk and canal. The
text: water reflects the electric-lighted name of the hotel. At
text: sidewalk is moored a gondola in which are four people. A
text: man climbs out, starts to sing, the others in the gondola
text: playing accompaniment. We hear a romantic Italian song,
text: irresistible. The four look up to the hotel windows,
dialog: expecting coins.
dialog: 
scene_heading: HOTEL ROOM INT.
text: photographed against the open window. In the background is
text: the canal. Through the window we hear the street singers.
text: Near the window is a table where five men are in a poker
text: game, not listening to the music. We hear, over the music,
text: the rattling of the chips. After a few moments the noise of
text: the chips stops and the singing comes through more clearly.
text: Casually one of the men, cards in hand, walks to the window,
text: closes it, and returns to game.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANOTHER HOTEL ROOM CLOSE SHOT
text: at open window. A woman is on a chair by a small table,
text: telephoning.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Uh-huh ... Uh-huh ...
dialog: 
text: During the scene we hear the same street singers. The woman,
text: annoyed by the singing, closes the window.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANOTHER HOTEL ROOM
text: Shooting over the bed toward an open window. Same singers
text: are heard. On the bed, in the foreground, is a woman lying
text: in her chemise and crying. In the background, sitting on
text: the arm of a chair which is by the open window, is an
text: elegantly dressed man. Evening clothes, overcoat, hat,
text: walking stick. Annoyed by the crying and by the outside
text: music, he gets up and slams the window shut with a bang.
dialog: 
scene_heading: FRANÇOIS'S HOTEL ROOM MED. SHOT
text: In the background is an open window with French doors
text: leading to a little balcony. This room is on the other
text: side of the hotel, looking out on a side canal. Close
text: outside the window we see trees. The same music is still
text: audible, but much fainter. Near the window is a desk. The
text: drawer is open and all the papers are scattered on the
text: floor. At the other side of the window is a trunk, open,
text: all the drawers out and the contents thrown around. Room
text: looks as if it has been rifled. For a little while we hear
text: nothing but the faint music. Then we hear the door buzzer.
text: There is no reaction. The buzzer rings again. Suddenly from
text: behind the camera, a man comes into the picture. He is in a
text: tuxedo. His back is to the camera, so we cannot identify
text: him. He goes quickly to the window, jumps from balcony to a
text: tree, and, climbing down, disappears. Buzzer rings again.
text: Camera goes toward the tree to a very big close-up of a
text: little branch. We see, on this little branch, a false
text: moustache. We hear the man reach ground and receding
text: footsteps as he hurries away. Again we hear, a little
text: fainter, the buzzer.
dialog: 
scene_heading: [EXT.HOTEL MED. SHOT
text: On wall in moonlight. We see shadow of tree and of man as
text: he reaches the ground. In silhouetted shadow, we see him
text: take off moustache and sideburns and toss them out of the
dialog: picture.
dialog: 
scene_heading: FRANÇOIS'S HOTEL ROOM MED. SHOT
text: toward window, low. Camera draws back and comes to a close
text: shot on the feet of a man outstretched on the floor behind
text: the camera. Buzzer is heard again, loud.]
dialog: 
scene_heading: HOTEL CORRIDOR CLOSE SHOT
text: at room door. We see the numbers 253, 5, 7, 9. At the door
text: are two Italian dames, obviously disreputable. One is
text: pushing the buzzer. They speak in Italian, but their
dialog: emphasis and pantomime make the following clear to English-
dialog: speaking audiences: Girl No. 1 brought Girl No. 2 to see the
text: gentleman of room 253. Girl No. 1 rings again. Girl No. 2
text: complains to Girl No. 1 that she should have known better
dialog: than to have brought her here and wasted her time. Girl
text: No. 1 apologizes and indicates her watch as if to say, "The
dialog: appointment was definite. I can't understand it." She rings
text: again--viciously this time.
dialog: 
scene_heading: LONG SHOT FRANÇOIS'S HOTEL ROOM
text: Sprawled on the floor, his head resting on a chair,
text: François is motionless. We see that a crime has been
text: committed. François is an elegant man, about thirty-five, a
text: conceited bon vivant. He is in a tuxedo. We hear the
text: buzzer, insistent.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CORRIDOR CLOSE SHOT
text: at door Girl No. 1 presses buzzer angrily. Girl No. 2
text: accuses her loudly. Girl No. 1 answers just as loud. Girl
text: No. 1 now bangs on the door, shouting insults to occupant
text: of the room. Girl No. 2 joins her.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT HOTEL CORRIDOR
text: at door across the hall from room 253. It is numbered 254.
text: We hear the voices of the angry Italian girls. The door
text: opens, and an old gentleman, white beard, dressing gown
text: over evening clothes, steps out. He politely but firmly
text: asks, in Italian, for silence.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT DOOR ROOM 253
text: The girls turn quickly toward the man. No. 2 says she can
dialog: talk as much as she wants to.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP OLD GENTLEMAN
text: He states emphatically that he won't stand for this.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP GIRL NO. 1
text: She looks over the old gentleman and makes a nasty personal
dialog: remark.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP OLD GENTLEMAN
text: He loses his temper and insults the girls venomously.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT TWO GIRLS
text: They are at the height of their fury. No. 2 walks out
text: quickly toward the old gentleman.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT DOOR ROOM 254
text: Old gentleman is in the open doorway. Girl approaches. The
text: two stand toe-to-toe trading verbal punches. The old man,
text: disgusted, retreats. He is about to close door, but girl,
text: still vociferous, follows him into his room and closes door
text: behind her.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT GIRL NO. 1
text: Still in front of 253. In the sudden silence, she looks
text: amazed toward 254. No. 2 has disappeared!
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT DOOR ROOM 254
text: Door opens quickly. No. 2 sticks her head out and, with a
text: characteristic jerk, says in Italian, "Come in." She
text: disappears, door slightly ajar.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT GIRL NO. 1
text: at 253 She goes to 254, enters, closes the door. The camera
text: swings fast to opposite side of corridor and stops at 253.
text: We hear telephone ringing inside.
dialog: 
scene_heading: FRANÇOIS'S HOTEL ROOM
text: Shooting from outside of the window into the room. In the
text: foreground is the window frame. We see François on the
text: floor. Phone is ringing. François awakes, tries to struggle
text: to his feet. But, still under the influence of dope, he
text: falls. As he falls he drags with him, from nearby little
text: table, a tray with glasses, making a loud noise.
text: (The window frame in the following moving shot across
text: windows outside will be done with a miniature hotel
dialog: building.)
text: Camera swings swiftly along the hotel front, around the
text: corner of the hotel, and up to the third floor. It stops at
text: a little balcony. Behind the balcony, leaning against one
text: of two open French doors, stands Gaston, in a tuxedo,
text: smoking a cigarette, looking romantically into the night.
text: We see, in the room, a waiter setting a dinner table for
text: two. The waiter arranges some flowers; then he comes
text: forward, offering Gaston the menu. Gaston does not respond.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: (breaking into Gaston's reverie)
dialog: Yes, sir?
dialog: (Gaston still looks into the
dialog: night.)
dialog: What shall we start with, Baron?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (coming to)
dialog: Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.
dialog: (Half to himself.)
dialog: Beginnings are always difficult.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Yes, Baron.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (directly to the waiter,
dialog: presenting a problem)
dialog: If Casanova suddenly ... turned out
dialog: to be Romeo ... having supper with
dialog: Juliet--who might become Cleopatra
dialog: ... How would you start?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: (in a professional and
dialog: prosaic tone)
dialog: I would start with cocktails.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!
text: Suddenly Gaston sees something on the canal.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MED. SHOT GONDOLA
text: In gondola, Lily, in evening dress, looks up at Gaston and
text: waves graciously.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BALCONY CLOSE SHOT
text: Gaston and waiter. Gaston bows--the bow of a gentleman to a
text: lady of degree--and waves back. This is the woman he is
dialog: waiting for.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (still looking at Lily)
text: It must be the most marvelous supper.
dialog: We may not eat it, but it must be
dialog: marvelous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Yes, Baron.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (turning)
dialog: And, waiter--you see that moon?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Yes, Baron.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: I want to see that moon in the
dialog: champagne.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Yes, Baron.
dialog: (Writing; very businesslike.)
text: Moon in champagne.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (groping for words)
dialog: I want to see--
text: (An ecstatic sigh escapes him.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: (continuing to write)
dialog: Yes, Baron.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: And as for you, waiter--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: (eagerly; expecting a tip)
dialog: Yes, Baron?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: I don't want to see you at all!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: No, Baron!
dialog: (With a little bow, waiter
text: starts to leave. Suddenly he
text: sees something on the back of
text: Gaston's jacket. Gaston looks
text: at him, puzzled. Waiter
text: reaches over, lifts a leaf
text: that is clinging to the coat,
text: and holds it up.)
dialog: I beg your pardon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (takes the leaf calmly)
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 
text: Waiter goes. We hear the door shut. Gaston is thoughtful a
text: brief moment. Then idly he tosses the leaf over the balcony
text: rail into the night.
scene_heading: TELEPHONE ROOM OF HOTEL CLOSE SHOT
text: of an operator. In the background we see two other
text: operators. We hear the girls answering in Italian. Our
text: operator is delivering a lengthy message. While she is
text: talking she looks up to the switchboard because she sees:
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT SWITCHBOARD
text: at No. 253. The light is flashing on and off very quickly.
text: We hear the operator's voice, still busy with the message
text: she is delivering. Now she plugs in on 253.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP OPERATOR
speaker_heading: OPERATOR
dialog: Si, signore.
dialog: (We see by her expression
text: that the man in room 253 is
dialog: reporting the robbery;
dialog: excitedly.)
dialog: Yes, sir! Right away!
dialog: 
text: She disconnects 253 and plugs in on the manager. She tells
text: the manager, in Italian, what has happened.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT GLASS DOOR
dialog: In Italian, English, French, and German: Manager. Door
text: opens and manager hurries out.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BIG CLOSE-UP OPERATOR
text: talking very fast in Italian, reporting the robbery to
text: someone else.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT A DOOR
text: opens, and another man, apparently a detective, comes out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAIRCASE
text: Another hotel attendant is running up.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BIG CLOSE-UP TWO MAIDS
text: talking excitedly in Italian, apparently discussing the
dialog: robbery.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANOTHER PART OF CORRIDOR
text: Camera shoots down over the back of a waiter. He holds high
text: over his shoulder a tray on which are several empty dishes.
text: A little bellboy is standing beside the waiter, looking up
text: and explaining in Italian excitedly what has happened.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAIRCASE
text: TWO maids on opposite landings. Steward comes up stairs and
text: tells them of robbery.
dialog: 
scene_heading: TELEPHONE ROOM
text: Another operator talking excitedly.
speaker_heading: CORRIDOR
text: A hotel official dashes along. We hear many voices talking
text: at the same time. Camera pans with him up to room 253 where
text: he stops. Door is open. Half in room, half in corridor, are
text: hotel attendants, detectives, the manager. With excited
text: gestures, they are discussing the situation in Italian.
text: Their voices become increasingly loud.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: to room 254. It opens quickly. Girl No. 2 appears, hair
text: slightly disarranged. She looks annoyed and shouts in
dialog: Italian for them to keep quiet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: of room 253. The men stop talking, look quickly over toward
dialog: the girl.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT GIRL NO. 2
text: Indignantly and crudely, she wants the noise to cease. She
text: closes the door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MED. SHOT AT ROOM 253
text: The men, talking quietly, go into the room and close the
dialog: door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: GASTON'S HOTEL ROOM MED. SHOT
text: at door, inside. Gaston opens it, and Lily enters quickly.
text: Gaston closes the door, looks at Lily questioningly. She is
text: excited and out of breath.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Oh, my gracious--he almost saw me.
speaker_heading: GASTON
text: (the crook in him worried
dialog: for a second)
dialog: Who?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (almost hysterical)
dialog: The Marquis de la Tours. He was in
dialog: the lobby. But I don't think he saw
dialog: me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank
dialog: heaven! ... But when I came up here,
dialog: right out in the hall there was
dialog: King Boris of Alconia!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: The tennis player?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: The tennis player. He saw me. He
dialog: bowed. What could I do? I nodded.
dialog: (Summing up in panic.)
dialog: Baron, I shouldn't have come!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
text: (goes to her, takes her hand;
dialog: with great feeling)
dialog: But you came. And you must forget
dialog: everything--
text: (Lily looks at him,
dialog: a little afraid)
dialog: except that you are here, Countess.
text: Gaston helps her off with her wrap, puts it on a chair.
text: Lily nervously walks out of the picture.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE SHOT AT WINDOW
text: shooting from inside. Lily comes in, stops at a chair, sits
text: nervously, stands, moves to window, and looks off from
text: balcony. Gaston comes in. He touches her hand. She turns to
dialog: him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
text: Out there in the moonlight
dialog: everything seemed so perfect, so
dialog: simple--but now--but now--
dialog: 
text: Gaston, thinking her mood is changing to a love mood, is
text: about to embrace her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (in a frightened tone)
dialog: Do you know King Boris?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: No--no.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (with a little smile)
dialog: I would like to.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (agitatedly)
dialog: You'd better not. He's really very
dialog: dull. But anyhow, when the king
dialog: tells the marquis he saw me, the
dialog: marquis will tell the marchesa. And
dialog: the marchesa is the best friend of
dialog: the Duchess of Chambro. And she
dialog: will phone the Princess de Costa.
dialog: The princess doesn't like me--but I
dialog: don't care!
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Why should you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (as if arguing)
dialog: But she talks a lot. And before
dialog: this night is over, all Venice will
dialog: know it. And tomorrow it will be
dialog: Grand Canal gossip! ... Oh!
dialog: 
text: Exhausted, she moves away, drops into an armchair. Gaston
text: goes to her, sits on the arm of the chair, leans over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (tenderly)
dialog: Don't stop. Keep right on
dialog: complaining. It's beautiful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
text: (looks at him for a
dialog: moment, quietly; then)
dialog: You know, when I first saw you, I
dialog: thought you were an American.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (flattered)
dialog: Thank you!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (With great delight)
dialog: Someone from another world--so
dialog: entirely different. One gets so
dialog: tired of one's own class--princes
dialog: and counts and dukes and kings--ah!
dialog: And everybody talking shop--always
dialog: trying to sell jewelry ... And then
dialog: I heard your name and found you
dialog: were just one of us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Disappointed?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (leaning back with lure)
dialog: No--proud. Very proud!
dialog: 
text: Gaston takes her in his arms and kisses her. She returns
text: his embrace. We hear the phone ringing. The embrace breaks,
text: and both look startled. Gaston obviously is nervous because
dialog: he is a crook. We don't know why Lily is nervous. Gaston
text: goes quickly toward the phone.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT LITTLE TELEPHONE TABLE
text: Gaston enters, picks up the phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Hello ... The countess?
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP LILY
text: She is still in the chair. Frightened, she rises quickly.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT GASTON
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
text: Just a moment.
dialog: (Hands over the receiver.)
dialog: The Duchess of Chambro.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT LILY
text: at the window. She is perplexed for a moment. Then she
text: hurries out toward the phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: at the phone. Lily enters. She makes a gesture as if to
dialog: say, "You see? They know already!"
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Hello, Your Grace. Yes, Your Grace.
dialog: How did you know I was here? Oh,
dialog: the marquis--
text: (She gestures to Gaston as if
dialog: to say, "Didn't I tell you?")
dialog: Yes, Your Grace. I see.
dialog: (Gaston walks out
dialog: of the picture.)
dialog: Dinner tomorrow--at your palace. Oh,
dialog: I'd be delighted. King Boris will
dialog: call for me ...
text: (She makes a gesture of
dialog: annoyance to Gaston.)
dialog: 
scene_heading: SECOND-CLASS HOTEL ROOM
text: It is very much in disorder. On the night table is a phone.
text: The woman who speaks is frowsy, fat, common. She is
text: apparently Lily's companion, maid, and intimate friend.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (voice guarded and low)
dialog: Listen, Lily. When you come home,
dialog: slip up the back way. I can't talk
dialog: now, but do what I tell you.
dialog: (In a loud voice.)
dialog: And listen, Lily. You know what
dialog: that darn dog of yours did--?
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT LILY
text: at the phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: So, he really did! How charming!
dialog: Well, my compliments to the duke.
dialog: Goodbye.
text: (She hangs up, faces Gaston,
text: makes a desperate gesture.)
dialog: There you are. The scandal is on!
dialog: 
scene_heading: MED. SHOT GASTON
text: standing by the dinner table, thoughtful. He looks over to
dialog: Lily.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT LILY
text: She has sunk into a sofa.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (half-despairingly)
dialog: Oh!
dialog: (She puts her head
dialog: in her hands.)
dialog: 
scene_heading: MED. SHOT GASTON
text: looks sadly at the table, realizing that the dinner he had
text: pictured so charmingly may be spoiled. He goes to Lily.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MED. SHOT LILY
text: in the chair, still holding head in hands. Gaston enters,
text: touches her hair lightly, controls himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Countess, I'm sorry.
dialog: (With great feeling.)
dialog: If you think it's best for you to
dialog: go--well--
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP LILY
text: She looks up at Gaston, amazed.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP GASTON
text: He looks at Lily with great tenderness.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT LILY
text: She looks tenderly at Gaston. She rises, camera rising with
text: her to include both Gaston and herself. She touches his
text: arm. She is moved and confused. Her real feeling starts to
text: break through at this manifestation of chivalry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (in a tremulous voice)
dialog: I think that's very nice--yes, very
dialog: nice.
text: (They look at each other
dialog: a few seconds.)
dialog: I think--I think we should have a
dialog: cocktail.
dialog: 
text: Gaston is delighted. He kisses her hand, goes quickly to
text: the dinner table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: at the dinner table. Gaston walks in, picks up the cocktail
text: shaker. He shakes it, smiles happily at Lily.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MED. SHOT FRANÇOIS'S HOTEL ROOM
text: François has recovered his memory. His hair is still
text: disarranged, eyes still glazed. For a few moments, he is
text: incoherent, then he gradually becomes almost normal.
text: Grouped near him are five Italian hotel officials, a
text: detective, and the manager. They are gesturing excitedly,
text: all talking at the same time. The dialogue is fragmentary,
text: ad lib, Italian. The manager, who speaks English, turns to
dialog: François.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: (indicating the detective)
dialog: The representative of the police
dialog: wants to know how much money you
dialog: had, M'sieu Filiba.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANÇOIS
dialog: I had exactly twenty thousand lire.
dialog: I had just cashed a traveler's
dialog: check and put it in my wallet.
dialog: 
text: Manager turns to the others and translates. They go into a
text: huddle and talk excited Italian.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: (to François)
dialog: Why did you let this man in, M'sieu
dialog: Filiba?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANÇOIS
dialog: Well, he knocked at the door. You
dialog: see, I was expecting two--uh--two
dialog: business associates.
dialog: 
text: Manager turns again to our Italian friends and again we see
dialog: the same excitement.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: (again to François)
dialog: And then what happened, M'sieu
dialog: Filiba?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANÇOIS
dialog: I said, "Come in." And there he was.
text: A fine-looking man with a moustache
dialog: and long sideburns. He said, "Good
dialog: evening. I'm the doctor." I said,
dialog: "Doctor?" He said, "Yes, the doctor.
dialog: I came to see about your tonsils."
dialog: 
text: Manager turns back, translating. It creates a sensation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: (to François)
dialog: The representative of the police
dialog: wants to know if there is anything
dialog: wrong with your tonsils.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANÇOIS
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: (to group)
dialog: Niente!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANÇOIS
dialog: That's just what I tried to tell
dialog: him. Well, one word led to another.
dialog: He really was a very charming
dialog: fellow. So we talked for about ten
dialog: minutes.
dialog: 
text: Manager translates. Again excitement.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: (to François)
dialog: What did you talk about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANÇOIS
dialog: About tonsils.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: (to the group)
dialog: Tonsili!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANÇOIS
dialog: So I said to myself, "All right, if
dialog: he wants to look at them, let him
dialog: look at them. No harm in that." And
dialog: then he said, "Say ah." And then I
dialog: said, "Ah." And that's all I
dialog: remember ... And when I woke up, I
dialog: still had my tonsils, but my
text: pocketbook was gone.
dialog:

text: his head.
text: (He tries to kiss Lily.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (holding him off gently)
dialog: Please.
dialog: (Very sincerely.)
dialog: When I came here it was for a
dialog: little adventure--a little game
dialog: which you play tonight and forget
dialog: tomorrow. But something has changed
dialog: me--and it isn't the champagne.
dialog: (Gaston, also with sincerity,
dialog: takes her hand.)
dialog: The whole thing is new to me. Very
dialog: new. I've got a confession to make
dialog: to you.
dialog: (After a slight pause.)
dialog: Baron, you are a crook.
dialog: (Gaston's expression
dialog: doesn't change.)
dialog: You robbed the gentleman in two
dialog: fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.
dialog: (Still Gaston's expression
dialog: doesn't change. After a

dialog: May I have the salt?

text: (There is a short silence as

dialog: Countess, believe me, before you
dialog: left this room I would have told
dialog: you everything ... And let me say
dialog: this with love in my heart--
dialog: Countess, you are a thief.
dialog: (Lily drops her
dialog: knife and fork.)
text: The wallet of the gentleman in two
dialog: fifty-three, five, seven, and nine
dialog: is in your possession. I knew it

dialog: (With great charm.)
dialog: In fact, you tickled me.
text: (Moving closer to her.)
dialog: But your embrace was so sweet ...
text: (He caresses her hand

dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT TABLE
text: Gaston goes to her, takes her hand, and draws her to her

dialog: I like you, Baron.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (fervently)
dialog: I'm crazy about you.
text: (He reaches in his side
text: pocket, takes out a diamond
dialog: brooch which Lily wore when
dialog: she came in.)
dialog: By the way, your pin.
text: Lily is flabbergasted. She looks down to her bosom. Indeed,
text: the pin is missing. She accepts the pin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (With a little
dialog: smile of shame)
dialog: Thank you, Baron.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Not at all, Countess ... There's
dialog: one very good stone in it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (as she fastens the pin)
dialog: What time is it?
dialog: 
text: Gaston reaches for his watch, discovers it is missing. He
text: gives Lily a look of admiration and astonishment. Lily

text: hands it to him. He takes it with a bow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: It was five minutes slow, but I
dialog: regulated it for you.
text: They bow to each other like two Chinese mandarins.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (tenderly)
dialog: I hope you don't mind if I keep
dialog: your garter.
text: Lily almost leaps out of her chair. She raises her skirt;
text: her hand searches for the garter. It is missing. Gaston
text: takes the garter out of his breast pocket, shows it to her,
text: kisses it, puts it back, and buttons his coat. Lily is
text: delighted. This is the highest compliment ever paid to her.
text: She slides into his lap, embraces him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Darling!

scene_heading: CORRIDOR MED. SHOT OPERA HOUSE
text: toward the sumptuous down-staircase. We see, in corridor,
text: at opposite sides of staircase, doors to ladies' and men's
text: restrooms. Door to the ladies' restroom is in foreground. A
text: gentleman is pacing up and down. Door opens; a lady comes
text: quickly to the gentleman. They exchange a few words, which
text: we don't hear. (Music of opera comes in dimly) Gentleman
text: reaches in pocket, gives her a coin. Lady goes back quickly.
text: As she is about to enter restroom Mariette comes out,
text: excited, rushes past gentleman down corridor and out of
dialog: picture.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE'S BOX
text: Major sits alone. The music comes in full volume. Mariette
text: enters, looks at her chair, at railing, at Major. During
text: the following, both search around in the box.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: My bag!
speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: Your bag?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (impatiently)
dialog: Yes, my bag!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: Didn't you take it with you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: Apparently not. Don't you know
dialog: where it is?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: No--I'm sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: But you saw it here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: Yes, I saw it--but--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: Well, where is it?
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP CONDUCTOR
text: disturbed by the agitated sounds, looks up at Mariette's
text: box, sternly reproving.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOX
text: Mariette and Major are standing, searching.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: It couldn't have walked out by
dialog: itself!
text: Major inadvertently tips over a chair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALLERY
text: Two typical music lovers. One is bent forward, eyes fixed
text: on the stage. The other leans back, eyes closed in ecstasy.
text: First man, suddenly annoyed by sounds from the box, says,
text: "Psst!" Second man suddenly wakes up, looks angrily at
text: first man, says, "Shh!" The two glare at each other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORRIDOR
text: outside Mariette's box. (Music continues, slightly muffled.)
text: Door opens. Mariette and Major come out, shut door. Major is
text: carrying hat and coat. They are still searching, looking
text: everywhere. Camera moves with them as they go down the
text: corridor. Mariette goes into ladies' room. Major
text: automatically follows her; door closes behind them. An
text: instant later, Major scurries out. Followed by camera, he
text: hurries away, embarrassed, stops, turns.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: at door to ladies' restroom. The maid, a middle-aged woman,
text: looks grimly at Major.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP MAJOR
text: He doesn't know what to say or how to act. At this moment
text: the music stops. We hear the bursting final applause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORRIDOR
text: Doors to first balcony open, and many people hurry out. We
text: still hear applause.
dialog: 
scene_heading: STAIRWAY AND CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BOXES
text: On either side, a door to a restroom. At top of stairway
text: stands Major. People emerging from boxes. Mariette comes
text: out of ladies' room, goes to Major. We see by her gestures
text: she hasn't found her bag. More people pass from behind
text: camera. Mariette and Major are caught in the crowd and
dialog: disappear.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: STAIRWAY SAME CAMERA ANGLE
text: Last patrons leaving down the stairs. They disappear;
text: corridor and staircase are empty. Door of men's room opens;

text: stairs and starts down.

scene_heading: JEWELRY STORE
text: (Not the one where Mariette bought her bag.) Shooting from

text: window appears Major. He looks, sour and depressed, at the
text: window display. Camera moves with him as he enters shop and
text: goes to counter. Camera pulls back, and now we discover
text: François at the counter. Both look straight ahead; they
text: don't see each other yet. Clerk enters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (to Major)
dialog: Yes, m'sieu?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: I would like to have--

speaker_heading: FRANÇOIS
dialog: (cheerfully)
dialog: Good morning, Major.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: Good morning.
dialog: (Stuttering; to clerk.)
dialog: I'd-I'd-I'd like to look at some
dialog: cuff links.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Very well, m'sieu.
text: Clerk goes. Major ignores François. François smiles,
dialog: ironical.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANÇOIS
dialog: (with feigned innocence)
dialog: Nice day, Major.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: (grunts)
dialog: Umm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANÇOIS
dialog: You're looking fine, Major.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: (turning)
dialog: Now see here, my good man. I've had
dialog: just about enough of your insulting
dialog: remarks!
dialog:

text: Sign reads Paris-Astor Hotel. Camera pans down. In entrance

dialog: with a minimum of energy.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT COUCH IN CHEAP HOTEL ROOM
text: Lily, in negligee, lying on couch, face covered by newspaper
text: she is reading while she has breakfast, which is on a little
text: table beside her. The dishes are clean but cheap looking.
text: Lily lowers the paper and looks slyly up. She sees:
dialog: 
scene_heading: OTHER SIDE OF ROOM CLOSE SHOT
text: Gaston, in dressing gown, sitting in armchair, reading a
dialog: newspaper.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT LILY
text: She watches Gaston, looks down to table, back at Gaston.
dialog: She wants to put something over without being seen--
dialog: something important. Now, quick, she decides to do it, come
text: what may. She picks up a French roll--still watching him--
text: dunks it in the coffee, takes a hurried bite, and
text: disappears again behind paper.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP GASTON
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (looking up from the paper)
dialog: I don't agree with this review at
dialog: all. I thought Martini's singing
dialog: was adequate, but to call him a
dialog: great singer--ridiculous!
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP LILY
text: Still reading her paper.

dialog: (with tenderness)
dialog: and made it into a lamp for my night
dialog: table?
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP GASTON

dialog: 
scene_heading: MED. SHOT LILY
text: Gaston sits close to her, caresses her hair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: I remember the lamp, I remember the
dialog: night table, and I remember the
dialog: night.
dialog: (They kiss.)
dialog: Everything will be all right again.
text: (As he gets up; with a
dialog: valiant little smile.)
dialog: Prosperity is just around the corner!
text: He goes out of the picture. Lily smiles after him with total
dialog: confidence.

scene_heading: CLOSE-UP GASTON'S CHAIR
text: Gaston returns, sits, picks up paper, resumes reading.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP LILY

text: She leaps to her feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Gaston!
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP GASTON
text: He looks up.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP LILY
text: Paper in hand, followed by camera, she goes to the bureau,
text: opens a drawer, and takes out Mariette's handbag. She looks
text: at the bag, rereads the item in the paper, looks back again.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT GASTON
text: Puzzled, he gets up.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT LILY
text: Followed by camera, she hastens to Gaston, hands him the
text: paper, points to the item.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Read this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INSERT
text: A large classified ad with headline: Handbag Lost--Twenty
text: Thousand Francs Reward. Before we can read the rest, camera
text: moves close to the headline. Under the insert, we hear:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY'S VOICE
dialog: The description fits. That's our
dialog: bag!
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT LILY AND GASTON
text: Gaston has finished reading.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Twenty thousand francs ... If we
dialog: sold it we'd get--
text: (He takes the bag from
text: Lily, examines it like
dialog: an expert.)
dialog: Well, it's worth forty thousand at
dialog: the most. She paid probably sixty
dialog: thousand. When we sell it ... I'd
dialog: say five thousand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Darling, then let's be honest and
dialog: return it to the lady.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: And take the twenty thousand francs ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (with sudden emotion)
dialog: Sweetheart, what day is today?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: The fourteenth of May.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And
dialog: the day after tomorrow--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (not knowing what he wants)
dialog: The six--
dialog: 
text: She catches Gaston's eye. Her face lights up. Very tenderly
text: she embraces him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: We'll go to Venice, to the same hotel!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (romantically)
dialog: We'll take the Royal Suite!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Two fifty-three, five--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Seven and nine!
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: And we'll celebrate the second

dialog: married!
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Darling!
text: They kiss. After they have held the embrace a few moments,

speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Come in.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT DOOR

dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT ELDERLY WOMAN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: You wouldn't have any use for it?
dialog: (Mariette hesitates.)
dialog: You see, I have another bag, and I

dialog: like to buy it ...
dialog: 
text: Mariette sees tears in the woman's eyes.
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (reaching into drawer

dialog: 
text: Mariette hands her the money.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (overwhelmed)
dialog: Oh, thank you, madame!

speaker_heading: MARIETTE

speaker_heading: LONG SHOT HALL

dialog: 
scene_heading: LIVING ROOM MED. SHOT

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT TELEPHONE
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE

speaker_heading: BUTLER

dialog: I must ask you
speaker_heading: BOLSHEVIK
dialog: (brushing butler aside)
dialog: And as Trotsky said--

scene_heading: MED. SHOT MARIETTE AND BOLSHEVIK

speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT DOOR
text: Butler, recuperated and full of dignity, opens door to the

dialog: but failing to find it;
dialog: twice as loud.)
dialog: Phooey!
text: Butler shoves him out, follows, shuts door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT

speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (looking after the

speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: Where did you--
dialog: 
text: She discovers that Gaston is no longer standing beside her.
text: She looks around.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE SHOT ANOTHER PART OF THE ROOM

dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT MARIETTE
text: She goes toward Gaston.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT GASTON

speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (happily)
dialog: Where did you find it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: You know the main staircase in the
dialog: opera?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Then you go to the left. There's a
dialog: landing.
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (eagerly)
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Then you go into the foyer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: And as you leave the foyer, there is
text: a little niche.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: I know that niche.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: And in that niche, there is a
dialog: statue of Venus.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: I remember.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (irrelevantly)
dialog: You like that statue?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (nonplussed)
dialog: Not particularly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Neither do I.
dialog: (Without any transition.)
dialog: That's where I found it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (naively, not suspicious)
dialog: I don't know how I could have lost
dialog: it there. I was nowhere near that
dialog: niche.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are
dialog: you sure this is your bag?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (a little nettled)
dialog: Of course it is! Are you doubting
dialog: me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (polite but precise)
dialog: Not in the least, madame. But you
dialog: see, it's a very expensive bag--one
dialog: has to be careful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
text: (half-annoyed, half-laughing,
dialog: and a little conceited)
dialog: Well--I am Madame Colet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (urbanely)
dialog: And I am M'sieu Laval--if you will
dialog: allow me to introduce myself.
dialog: 
text: Mariette is perplexed. Their relationship has somehow been

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (With a little laugh;
dialog: extending her hand)
dialog: Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: The pleasure is mine, madame.
dialog: 
text: He bends over and kisses her hand. Camera goes quickly to a

scene_heading: STREET IN PARIS

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (With the air of an honest

dialog: One purse--
dialog: (shaking it)

dialog: (opening it)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: But really, m'sieu, this isn't
dialog: necessary.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Please, Madame Colet, I believe in
dialog: doing things correctly. Shall we
dialog: continue?
text: (He empties the bag.)
text: Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter,

dialog: yes, this letter from Major--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Oh! You didn't read it!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Naturally I did.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: Oh!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: You needn't be embarrassed, madame.
dialog: A lady as charming as you would, and
dialog: should, get love letters.
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (embarrassed and flattered)
dialog: M'sieu Laval!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: But one suggestion, madame.
dialog: (Shaking his head.)
dialog: Not the major.
text: (Mariette looks startled,
dialog: as if to say, "How did
dialog: you know?")
dialog: I don't mind his grammatical
dialog: mistakes. I'll overlook his bad
text: punctuation. But the letter has no
dialog: mystery--no bouquet--no ...
dialog: (Changing the subject,
dialog: taking a lipstick out
dialog: of bag.)
dialog: And one lipstick ...
dialog: (Reading markings on
dialog: bottom; disapproving.)
dialog: Scarlet number four.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: What's wrong now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: With your skin, I prefer crimson.
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (now on a vital theme)

speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: That's what you need!

speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: No, no, no!
text: (She sits on couch.
text: He sits beside her.)
dialog: I disagree with you completely! I
dialog: tried it once--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: What shade of powder do you use?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: Peaches and cream.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: That's too dark.
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (fighting for her life)
dialog: Do you realize I have light eyes?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: But, Madame Colet, that's a matter
dialog: of eye shadow. I can straighten that
text: out in two seconds.
text: We hear a knock on the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (annoyed at interruption)
dialog: Come in!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE-UP DOOR
text: Butler comes in, shuts door quickly behind him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTLER
dialog: (With a sour expression)
dialog: The major.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT GASTON AND MARIETTE
text: On couch. She makes a gesture of exasperation. So does
text: Gaston. They look at each other helplessly. Then Gaston
text: takes charge. He rises and goes toward butler.
dialog: 
scene_heading: HALL MED. SHOT
text: at living room door. Major stands waiting. Door opens;
text: butler comes out, followed briskly by Gaston.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (before Major can speak)
dialog: I'm sorry, m'sieu, but Madame had
dialog: better not see anyone.
dialog: 
text: Major stares blankly. He never saw Gaston before.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: You see, the bag has just been
dialog: found, and the reaction of relief
dialog: from her former excitement and
dialog: strain is just a little too much
dialog: for her. It's not very serious, but
dialog: just the same we'd better not take
dialog: any chances.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: (assuming Gaston
dialog: is a physician)
dialog: Just as you say, Doctor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Thank you, Major.
dialog: (Goes back toward
dialog: living room.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: Good day, Doctor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Good day, Major.
dialog: 
text: The camera goes with Major toward entrance door. Major
text: looks crestfallen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STREET
text: in front of Mariette's house. François, followed by camera,
text: goes to the door, rings bell. Door is opened by butler, and
text: Major comes out, butler remaining in doorway. Major and
text: François stare at each other. Major looks pointedly at
text: François's package. Then Major turns to butler.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: Jacques, has the bag been found?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTLER
dialog: Yes, Major.
dialog: 
text: Major turns with bright smile to François, who looks glum
text: and glances instinctively at his package.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: Is Madame feeling well?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTLER
dialog: No, Major.
text: Major is still looking at the unhappy François and having
dialog: the time of life.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: Is Madame seeing anybody this
dialog: afternoon, this evening, or even
dialog: tomorrow?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTLER
dialog: No, Major.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: You may shut the door, Jacques.
text: Butler closes door. François, miserable, turns away from
dialog: Major.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: Well. that leaves you holding the
dialog: bag. Goodbye!
text: Major lifts his hat, goes out of picture to right. François
text: looks after him angrily, then goes out of picture to left.
dialog: 
scene_heading: LIVING ROOM COUCH CLOSE SHOT
text: Gaston and Mariette. There is a moment of silence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (rising)
dialog: Well, I think I'd better be going.
dialog: Goodbye, Madame Colet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (rising)
dialog: Goodbye, M'sieu La-- Oh, yes ...
dialog: This is a rather delicate matter and
dialog: I don't want to ... You see, if you
dialog: read my advertisement carefully, you
dialog: must have noticed that there was ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: In other words, madame, it
dialog: embarrasses you to offer me the
dialog: twenty thousand francs reward.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll
dialog: take it. I need the money. I wish I
dialog: were in a position to ignore the
dialog: whole matter. But you know, madame,
dialog: the stock market, bank crash ... To
dialog: make a long story short--a member
dialog: of the nouveaux poor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
text: (looks at him sympathetically)
dialog: Then I'm glad I lost the bag! I'll
dialog: write you the check immediately.
text: (Followed by camera, she goes.)
dialog: 
scene_heading: HALL MED. SHOT
text: at staircase. Coming from living room, Mariette goes up the
text: stairs, followed by camera. At first landing, as Mariette
dialog: reaches door--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON'S VOICE
dialog: Madame Colet!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (turning)
dialog: Yes, M'sieu Laval?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON BELOW
text: Shooting down from her angle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Do you know my first name?
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT MARIETTE
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: No. What is it? Tell me.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT GASTON
text: Followed by camera, he runs up stairs. At the landing, he
text: goes close to her.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (whispering ardently)
dialog: Gaston!
text: She looks at him with a confused smile.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (Still ardently)
dialog: And do you know what I'd like to
dialog: have you do with that check?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (softly, curious)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (passionate)
dialog: Make it out to cash!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: As you like.
text: (She opens door and
text: he follows her.)
dialog: 
scene_heading: LONG SHOT PRIVATE OFFICE OF FORMER SECRETARY, WITH GLIMPSE
scene_heading: INTO ADJOINING ELEGANT BEDROOM
text: In foreground at desk, is Mariette. In bedroom background,
text: Gaston is seen examining a painting on the wall with the air
text: of a connoisseur. Camera moves to close-up of Mariette. She
text: is opening and shutting drawers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: Now, where can that checkbook be?
dialog: Oh, dear me, dear me! She must have
dialog: left it somewhere. It's always the
dialog: same--when you're looking for
dialog: something, you can't find it.
text: (She continues mumbling
text: and slamming drawers.)
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT GASTON
text: at the wall, still admiring the painting. Now he draws
text: painting slightly away from wall and glances behind as if
text: looking for a safe. He allows painting to drop back into
text: place. Followed by camera, he goes on looking around. He
text: stops before window, looks out, studying possible entrances
text: and exits.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT MARIETTE
text: at desk, still searching.
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: I can't find that checkbook. I
dialog: should have discharged her six
dialog: months ago! I really don't know
dialog: what to do. Where can I look now?
dialog: (Turning to Gaston.)
dialog: M'sieu Laval, I'm very sorry, but--
text: She tops short. Gaston is not there. She sees:
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOOR TO FORMER SECRETARY'S BEDROOM
text: It is open.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT MARIETTE
text: Followed by camera, she goes to bedroom.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BEDROOM MED. SHOT
text: at open door. Mariette enters, stops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT BED
text: Gaston is studying bed with the eye of a connoisseur.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT MARIETTE
text: in doorway. She looks mystified. She moves toward him
dialog: lightly because:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT BED
text: Gaston apparently doesn't know she is in the room. He is
text: still studying bed with scholarly concentration. Mariette
text: enters, stops beside him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (with respect for the bed)
dialog: Eighteenth century.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (getting it; impressed)
dialog: Yes!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Early eighteenth century. I should
dialog: say around--seventeen thirty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: Right!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (examining headboard)
dialog: Beautiful specimen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: It is beautiful. But I got a little
dialog: tired of sleeping in antiques, so I
dialog: gave it to my secretary.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (specially interested as
dialog: he learns this is not
dialog: Mariette's room)
dialog: Oh?
dialog: (He wants to hear more.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: This used to be my secretary's room.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (with affected nonchalance)
dialog: I see.
dialog: (Going very close to
text: headboard, touching woodwork
dialog: with expert hand.)
dialog: She must have been very happy here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (with a smile)
dialog: Too happy. That's why I discharged
dialog: her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
text: (his eye caught by carving
dialog: on one of the posts)
dialog: Isn't that wonderful!
text: (He turns to Mariette.)
dialog: You see, madame--
text: (He stops, noticing
dialog: something on the wall.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: In the wall is a safe. Camera moves to close-up of safe.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT MARIETTE AND GASTON
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (inspired)
dialog: Let me tell you something, madame,
dialog: as a man who has had all kinds of
dialog: secretaries ... I wonder if she put
dialog: that checkbook in the safe!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: I hardly think so. But let's look.
dialog: (She goes toward safe.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT SAFE
text: Mariette enters, starts turning knob, lips moving silently
text: as she articulates numbers to herself. The camera pans her
text: out and stops before Gaston who is now close behind her,
text: concentrating on the combination.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT MARIETTE'S HAND
text: turning knob back and forth.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT GASTON'S HAND
text: It is instinctively turning an imaginary knob, following
dialog: Mariette's pattern.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT MARIETTE AND GASTON
text: Mariette opens safe. Gaston takes a swift good look into
text: safe, but acts casual in case Mariette turns around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
text: (rummaging with her hand)
dialog: No, no. No, it's not here.
dialog: (Suddenly.)
dialog: Oh! What do you think of that?
dialog: (She brings out two crisp
dialog: packages of bank notes.)
dialog: A hundred thousand francs!
dialog: (With a half-smile.)
dialog: You know, I didn't have the
dialog: slightest idea--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (severely)
dialog: But, madame, you keep a hundred
dialog: thousand francs--in your safe--at
dialog: home?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (worried)
dialog: You think that's too much?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (emphatically)
dialog: No! Not enough!
dialog: (With the air of a banker.)
dialog: In times like these, when everything
dialog: is uncertain, every conservative
dialog: person should have a substantial
dialog: part of his fortune within arm's
dialog: reach.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (nodding with the gravity
text: of a woman accepting her
dialog: banker's advice)
dialog: That sounds sensible.
text: (She goes out of the picture,
dialog: thinking it over.)
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT LITTLE SETTEE
text: Mariette enters, sits.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: Very sensible!
dialog: 
text: Gaston enters, sits beside her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (sternly; an uncle)
dialog: Madame Colet, I think you deserve a
dialog: scolding. First, you lose your bag--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (gaily)
dialog: Then I mislay my checkbook--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Then you use the wrong lipstick--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (almost laughing)
dialog: And how I handle my money!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: It's disgraceful!
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (with a flirtatious look)
dialog: Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is
dialog: wrong?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I
dialog: were your father--
dialog: (with a smile)
dialog: which, fortunately, I am not--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (coquettish)
dialog: Ye-es?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: And you made any attempt to handle
dialog: your own business affairs, I would
dialog: give you a good spanking--in a
dialog: business way, of course.
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (complete change of
dialog: expression; businesslike)
dialog: What would you do if you were my
dialog: secretary?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: The same thing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: You're hired!
speaker_heading: FADE OUT

speaker_heading: SEQUENCE E
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FADE IN
scene_heading: BOARD OF DIRECTORS ROOM
text: Camera moves along the table in close shots of members of

dialog: rises.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: Speaking for the board of directors

dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP GASTON
text: in a different suit. He begins to calculate with his

speaker_heading: GASTON

speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Frankly, madame, I'm too tired.

speaker_heading: UPPER STAIRCASE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: Don't you want to come down and

dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT GASTON
text: in doorway.

speaker_heading: GASTON

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT SECRETARY

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT GASTON

dialog: --the other half, contrary to
dialog: custom, shall be delivered in cash
text: into Madame's personal custody.
text: (Followed by camera, he
text: goes to Lily and takes
dialog: her in his arms.)
dialog: Darling, that means that on the

dialog: hundred and fifty thousand francs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (ecstatically)
dialog: And her jewelry is worth a fortune!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: No jewelry! Hands off jewelry! If
dialog: we're broke--all right. I might
text: pick up a million-franc necklace.
dialog: But in times like these when we're
dialog: doing a cash business--why take a
dialog: chance on jewelry?
dialog: 
text: Lily gets up, goes to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (the way a wife talks

dialog: I know you're awfully busy, and I
dialog: don't like to trouble you. But she
dialog: has one little necklace--you know,
dialog: that one with the seed pearls? It's
dialog: so quiet and simple. It would go
text: just beautifully with my neck.
text: Gaston takes her in his arms, moved. They kiss. There is a

speaker_heading: LILY

dialog: You see, Mother is dead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (pouring her own coffee;

scene_heading: CLOSE-UP LILY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: You see--

dialog: Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: About what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (almost in a whisper)
dialog: Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (with a poisonous

speaker_heading: MARIETTE

speaker_heading: LILY

speaker_heading: MARIETTE

speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Nervous?

dialog: Um-hum. He smokes too much!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: No, he works too much.
dialog: (Lily nods with
dialog: great relief.)
text: He's chained to his desk. Too much

speaker_heading: LILY

speaker_heading: MARIETTE

dialog: Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child!
dialog: That's ridiculous. You go home as
dialog: usual--five o'clock every day. Now

speaker_heading: LILY

speaker_heading: LILY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY

speaker_heading: GASTON

dialog: Eight hundred and fifty thousand

speaker_heading: LILY

dialog: Darling, remember you're Gaston

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON'S VOICE
dialog: What is it, madame?
speaker_heading: MARIETTE'S VOICE

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT WINDOW
text: Open window frames a view of garden. Foreground is dark.
text: Above trees, a church steeple with a clock large enough so

scene_heading: HALL UPPER END OF STAIRS
text: Close shot of hall clock near Mariette's bedroom door. Hands
text: indicate the hour of two, and deep tones strike the hour.

text: evening dress, looking toward office door, eyes languorous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (reluctantly)

speaker_heading: GASTON

dialog: Good night, Madame Colet.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MED. SHOT HALL
text: At one end, at her open bedroom door, is Mariette. At other

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (since nothing happens; sadly)
dialog: Good night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (also sad)
dialog: Good night.
dialog: 
text: Mariette goes into her room, closes door. Gaston stands a
text: moment in his doorway, undecided. Then, with a decisive air,
text: he goes halfway toward Mariette's door. He stops abruptly at
text: the one light, a lamp on the wall. He turns it out. Then he
text: goes back to his office-bedroom slowly. Camera moves closer
text: to him and up to his door. He goes in, shuts door, and we
text: hear the lock click from inside. Camera pans quickly to
text: Mariette's door. We hear similar click.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SEQUENCE G
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FADE IN
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
text: A large window, consisting of four or five framed units,
text: fronts on a terraced garden in which a small informal party
text: is underway.
text: Close shot of the first frame, showing part of garden and
text: terrace. Windows are shut; we cannot hear what is going on.
text: Beyond window, on terrace: a group of society people,
text: teacups, butler serving cakes from tray. Mariette comes from
text: garden to join group, a cordial hostess As she moves her eye
text: is caught elsewhere.
dialog: 
text: CAMERA PANS QUICKLY to the last window frame, following her
text: glance, and stops before Gaston and two very attractive
text: young ladies who seem delighted at what he is saying.
text: Mariette comes quickly into the picture and, pretending she
text: wants to introduce him to someone else, takes Gaston from
text: his dangerous companions.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERA MOVES
text: back along window with them. As soon as the two young ladies
text: are out of the picture, Mariette brings Gaston intimately
text: close toward window and camera. (Assumption is that living
text: room is empty and no one can see them from behind camera.)
text: Charmingly and with a twinkle in her eye, she reprimands
text: him, in a guarded whisper, about flirting. He answers and
text: apparently says something that makes her laugh, disarming
text: her. With a sudden return to party manner, she moves with
text: him along the framed windows. Camera goes with them as she
text: introduces him to a few little groups. By this time, they
text: are back in the first window frame, and now they move out
dialog: of picture.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERA CONTINUES
text: past window and discloses inside corner of living room. In
text: a chair, sitting stiffly as if in a waiting room, is M.
text: Giron, the chairman of the board, briefcase on knees,
text: flower in buttonhole. He seems in a bad mood--apparently
text: the financial cut hasn't agreed with him. We hear a door
dialog: opening.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTLER'S VOICE
dialog: M'sieu Giron, Madame will be with
dialog: you presently.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: Very well, Jacques.
dialog: 
text: We hear door closing. Giron, irritated, gets up and,
text: followed by camera, goes toward the window.
dialog: 
scene_heading: TERRACE CLOSE SHOT
text: at window shooting into living room. Giron comes toward
text: window and looks into garden. His face gets stern and angry
text: as he sees:
dialog: 
scene_heading: GARDEN CLOSE SHOT
text: Giron's view, of Gaston and the major, animatedly conversing.
dialog: Camera angle must be so that Gaston is more prominent, thus
text: giving impression that Giron's attention is focused on
dialog: Gaston.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: No, no, my dear Major. There's a
dialog: limit to what you can do with
dialog: infantry. If have you the proper
dialog: artillery backing, I would say--
dialog: maybe.
dialog: 
scene_heading: TERRACE CLOSE SHOT
text: toward window. Behind window stands Giron, muttering
text: imprecations under his breath.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT MAJOR AND GASTON
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: No, no, no! I disagree with you
dialog: absolutely. That's the trouble with
dialog: you artillery men.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Now just a minute, Major--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: No, Captain, I tell you--
text: Mariette comes into the picture.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: Now, Major, you mustn't monopolize
dialog: M'sieu Laval.
dialog: (To Gaston.)
dialog: Please!
dialog: (She leads Gaston away,
text: camera with them. They
text: stop before another group.
dialog: She introduces Gaston.)
dialog: May I present M'sieu Laval? Madame
dialog: Chotard, Madame Leconte, Madame
dialog: Poncelet.
dialog: (Camera moves with them
dialog: to a lady and a gentleman.)
dialog: Madame Rudaux, M'sieu Legrand--
dialog: M'sieu Laval.
dialog: (They move to François
dialog: and a lady.)
dialog: M'sieu Laval--Madame Boucher. M'sieu
dialog: Filiba.
dialog: (François bows, not
dialog: recognizing Gaston.
text: Camera moves along
dialog: with them to others.)
dialog: M'sieu Laval--Madame Jeantaud,
dialog: M'sieu Gentil.
dialog: 
text: Gaston, his back to camera, bows politely; then suddenly--
text: a second "take"--he looks over his shoulder toward François.
text: It is apparent he has recognized François. Mariette moves
dialog: Gaston along.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE SHOT FRANÇOIS AND LADY
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: That's that M'sieu Laval.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANÇOIS
dialog: Laval? Who is M'sieu Laval?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: I don't know. She says he's her
dialog: secretary.
dialog: 
text: François turns and looks searchingly at Gaston, who has
text: paused with Mariette at another group.
speaker_heading: FRANÇOIS
dialog: Oh? ... So!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: And he says he is her secretary. Maybe
dialog: I'm wrong--maybe he is her secretary.
text: (She laughs cynically.)
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT GASTON
text: Mariette has apparently left the last group, and he remains.
text: The others, at the moment, are busy with tea and cakes; no
text: one talks. Gaston, back to camera, steals another look over
text: his shoulder at François.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT FRANÇOIS
text: from Gaston's viewpoint. He is staring at this new and
text: dubious figure in Mariette's life--Gaston.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT GASTON
text: with the group. He sees that François is staring at him,
text: becomes a little uncomfortable. With sudden decision, he
text: turns to the group.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Excuse me, please.
text: Followed by camera, he steps over to François. Camera stops
text: in a close shot on Gaston, François, and lady. Gaston bows
text: to lady, faces François.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Pardon me, m'sieu, but I have the
dialog: feeling we have met somewhere
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: FRANÇOIS
dialog: (snobbish, polite)
dialog: I'm sorry, but I don't seem to
dialog: recall the occasion. No, I'm
dialog: afraid ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (courteously)
dialog: Well--then it must be my mistake.
dialog: (Bowing.)
dialog: I beg your pardon.
text: He smiles, ignoring the snub, as François stands with
text: frozen superiority. Gaston goes. François looks after him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANÇOIS
dialog: (to the lady)
dialog: That man never met me, and he knows
dialog: it. Trying to make social
dialog: connections!
dialog: 
scene_heading: LIVING ROOM MARIETTE AND GIRON
text: On a table is a pile of business papers and an empty
text: briefcase. Giron has fountain pen in his hand, ready to
dialog: turn it over to Mariette for signature.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
text: (With a despairing
dialog: little laugh)
dialog: But my dear M'sieu Giron, I'm
dialog: having a tea party. Must I be
dialog: bothered with all these papers now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: I'm sorry, madame, but there are
dialog: still certain matters which I think
dialog: you should attend to yourself. And
dialog: I, personally, would not care to
dialog: refer them to--to--
dialog: (He hesitates.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: To M'sieu Laval?
dialog: 
text: Giron doesn't answer. There is a pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: (With dignity)
dialog: Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the
dialog: confidence of your family for more
dialog: than forty years.
dialog: (With great feeling.)
dialog: I was a school friend of your
dialog: husband's ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
text: (looking at his white hair,
dialog: which tells the whole story
dialog: of her marriage; grimly)
dialog: I know!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: Madame, let me ask you: Who is
dialog: M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he
dialog: come from? What is he?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (crisply)
dialog: He is my secretary! I hope that
dialog: answers all your questions, M'sieu
dialog: Giron.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: You know what Paris is saying
dialog: about the Countess Falconier and

dialog: know I never met that man, and yet--
dialog: (Looking in Gaston's
dialog: direction.)
dialog: Laval, Laval ... You know, if I
dialog: like a man, I remember him. And if
dialog: I don't like a man, I never forget
dialog: him. In a nutshell, madame, it's
dialog: little things like that that drive
dialog: me crazy! Excuse me!
text: (He gets up and walks
dialog: out of the picture.)

dialog: Yes, M'sieu Filiba?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANÇOIS
dialog: You see--
text: (He stops to look Gaston
dialog: over from all angles,

text: Shaking his head and
dialog: smiling.)
dialog: No, no! And yet--
text: (He looks at Gaston
dialog: intently again.)
dialog: Did I--did--now where could we have--
text: They are interrupted by entrance of butler.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTLER
dialog: (to Gaston)
dialog: Pardon me, m'sieu. Madame Colet
dialog: would like to see you in the
dialog: living room.
speaker_heading: GASTON
text: At once, Jacques.
dialog: (To François.)
dialog: We'll continue later.
dialog: 
text: He goes. François now has jealousy added to his confused
text: suspicion. As he glares after Gaston the major enters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: Now see here, my good man, let's
dialog: face the facts. I'm having a dinner
dialog: party, and one man turned me down
text: at the last minute.
dialog: (Very cutting.)
dialog: Have you a dinner jacket?
dialog: (François stiffens.)
dialog: 
scene_heading: MED. SHOT LIVING ROOM
text: Giron and Mariette. The situation is tense. Gaston enters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (With a bow)
dialog: Madame.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: Will you be good enough to run
dialog: through these papers with M'sieu
dialog: Giron?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: I'll be delighted.
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (to Giron, sharply)
dialog: And so will M'sieu Giron.
text: Giron bows. Mariette turns.
dialog: 
scene_heading: LIVING ROOM DOOR
text: Mariette goes out.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT GIRON AND GASTON
text: For a moment the men eye each other. Gaston smiles, but
text: Giron maintains a frigid face. Gaston calmly takes the
text: papers, sits, and starts to go over the figures.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: M'sieu Laval, there are several
dialog: things I've wanted to ask you for
dialog: quite a while. I understand you are
dialog: from Marseilles.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (pretending to be absorbed
dialog: in the figures; absently)
dialog: Um-hum ...
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: (persistently)
dialog: You must be related to the Lavals
dialog: of Marseilles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (With pretense of being
dialog: mildly distracted)
text: Just a second.
text: He goes over the papers even more thoroughly, turns several
text: pages, then turns back, apparently comparing items,
text: muttering figures to himself.
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: I hope you find the figures correct.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (pointedly)
dialog: I hope so, too.
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: (with indignation)
dialog: M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the
dialog: confidence of this family--
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (not looking up)
dialog: For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: (change of tone;
dialog: very deliberately)
dialog: And I have known the Lavals of
dialog: Marseilles for more than thirty
dialog: years.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT GASTON
text: Deaf to Giron, concentrating on figures, he turns absently
text: to the window and suddenly comes awake, for he sees:
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT WINDOW
text: Gaston's viewpoint. Outside window, on terrace, stands
text: François. He is staring at Gaston as if to say, "Where did
dialog: I see him?"
dialog: 
scene_heading: BIG CLOSE-UP GASTON
text: He smiles cordially at François.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT FRANÇOIS
text: through window. He begins to smile, then shakes head as if
text: saying, "No, that's not the fellow." He goes out of the
dialog: picture.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT GASTON AND GIRON
text: Gaston still smiling toward window. Now he turns back to the
text: papers and begins muttering more figures.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: (in a cutting voice)
dialog: M'sieu Laval, you seem to be
dialog: avoiding my questions.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: And you, M'sieu Giron, seem to be
dialog: disturbing my examination of this
dialog: report.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are
dialog: you insinuating? I have enjoyed the
dialog: confidence of this family for more
dialog: than forty years. How long have you
dialog: enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three
dialog: weeks, I believe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (coolly)
dialog: Two weeks and three days.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: (nastily)
dialog: Um-hum!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (very softly)
dialog: Are you insinuating anything, M'sieu
dialog: Giron?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: (With equal softness
text: and a sudden smile)
dialog: No, not at all!
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (beaming)
dialog: Well, that's fine. Then you are not
dialog: insinuating that I am avoiding
dialog: questions. And I am not insinuating
dialog: that you won't let me examine this
dialog: report.
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: (continuing the friendly
dialog: note; with an innocent
dialog: chuckle)
dialog: I was only asking if you are related
dialog: to the Lavals of Marseilles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (even more friendly)
dialog: And I was only asking you if you
dialog: would let me examine your report
text: without interruption.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: (like a man about to
dialog: make a new friend)
dialog: I don't see why any man should get
text: excited when he is asked about his
dialog: hometown.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: And I don't see any reason for any
dialog: man getting nervous when somebody
text: checks over the figures of his
dialog: report.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: (sudden change; enraged)
dialog: Are you insinuating that this is
dialog: not an honest report?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (With vigor)
dialog: I am only insinuating that you are
dialog: nervous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: (furious)

speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (With deadly sincerity)
dialog: I don't know, M'sieu Giron!
dialog: 
text: Outraged, Giron picks up the batch of papers, shakes it in
text: Gaston's face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: Are you trying to say that there
dialog: is anything in these figures to

dialog: 
text: Gaston pauses, and we see his suspicion has become a
dialog: certainty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (with a quiet smile)
dialog: No, not at all.
dialog: 
text: With quick, casual movement, Gaston takes the report from
text: Giron's hand, drops it in desk, locks desk, and puts key in
text: his pocket. Giron is speechless, frightened to his heels.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (getting up; amiably)
dialog: We'll keep these papers here.
dialog: (Taking Giron by the arm,
text: he leads him toward door.
text: Camera follows them from

dialog: And tomorrow morning I'll drop in at

dialog: about the Lavals of Marseilles.
dialog: (Giron looks back over

scene_heading: GARDEN CLOSE SHOT

speaker_heading: MARIETTE

text: of Mariette. It is after dinner. We hear voices and music.
text: Her thoughts are with Gaston. She sips from a champagne
text: glass. Medium close-up to include her chair and a small
text: table. She puts glass on the table and, oblivious to other
text: guests, leans back dreamily, anticipating a night of love,
text: eyes closed.
text: Camera pans to a couch not too near Mariette. François and
text: the major, smoking cigars. Camera moves to close-up. They
text: are watching Mariette. They exchange a look of understanding.
text: They have become friends, realizing that neither has a
dialog: chance with Mariette.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: (intimately)
dialog: No doubt about it--it's that
dialog: secretary.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANÇOIS
dialog: Funny, the kind of men women fall
dialog: for.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: No color, no sparkle--but
dialog: dependable.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANÇOIS
dialog: The type they marry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: You know, I'm not the marrying type.
dialog: I like to take my fun and leave it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANÇOIS
dialog: (inspecting the
dialog: major; friendly)
dialog: Nice suit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: Like it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANÇOIS
dialog: Smart. London, eh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR
text: Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
speaker_heading: FRANÇOIS
dialog: I thought so.
text: Both men lean back. A moment of silence.
speaker_heading: FRANÇOIS
dialog: (patronizingly)
dialog: He's really not a bad fellow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: Just dull.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANÇOIS
dialog: Insignificant ... He's a secretary,
dialog: always was a secretary, always will
dialog: be.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: (with a smile)
dialog: Funny--the first time I saw him I
dialog: thought he was a doctor!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANÇOIS
dialog: (sitting up suddenly)
dialog: Doc--!
dialog: 
text: François looks stricken. Major, worried, thinks François has
text: a heart attack. François gets up; Major gets up. François
text: stares into space, then unseeingly at Major. Major becomes
text: alarmed. François sits. Major sits with him. With sudden
text: decision, François snaps his fingers, stands up. Major also
text: stands up. François, followed by camera, goes straight to
text: Mariette. Major, in a daze, follows. Mariette is still
text: dreaming. François taps her on the shoulder. She looks up.
text: His expression frightens her. François, waving his hand,
text: tries to talk. The words don't come. Finally one escapes
dialog: him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANÇOIS
dialog: Tonsils!
dialog: (Major and Mariette think
dialog: the man has gone insane.)
dialog: Positively tonsils!
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: VERY CLOSE SHOT GASTON'S BEDROOM WINDOW
text: from outside. Behind the glass, Gaston's hand drumming on
text: the pane nervously. Camera pulls back, and we see Gaston
text: looking into the night, waiting restlessly. Suddenly he
text: turns around sharply toward the door. Apparently someone
text: has knocked at the office door. Camera swings over to the
text: next window, and we recognize the office, which adjoins
text: Gaston's bedroom. Through office window we see butler, who
text: has knocked on bedroom door, waiting. Bedroom door opens,
text: and Gaston emerges It is apparent that butler delivers a
text: message. Camera moves down one floor and stops in a close
text: shot of living room window from outside. Behind the glass
text: stands Giron. He also drums nervously on the pane.
dialog: 
scene_heading: LIVING ROOM CLOSE SHOT
text: at door to the corridor. Door opens. Gaston enters.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT GIRON

speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (impatiently)
dialog: I'm very sorry, but this is no time,
dialog: M'sieu Giron--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: (emphatically)
dialog: I've got to see you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: But not now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: Right now! It's very important,
dialog: M'sieu Laval.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: It may be important to you, M'sieu
dialog: Giron--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: No, to you--M'sieu Monescu.
dialog: 
text: Pause, as they face each other.
speaker_heading: GASTON

text: François. All are excited.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAJOR AND FRANÇOIS
dialog: But, Mariette, please... Now
dialog: listen--it's true ...
dialog: 
text: Followed by camera, they approach car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: It's absolutely ridiculous! I don't
dialog: believe it!
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAJOR AND FRANÇOIS
dialog: But, Mariette--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: I'm awfully tired anyhow. So please
dialog: leave me alone. Good night!
text: (She steps into car.
text: Chauffeur shuts car door
dialog: and goes out of picture
text: to driver's seat. François
text: and Major linger awkwardly.
text: Door opens and Mariette
dialog: leans out.)
dialog: I had a very lovely time!
dialog: (Door doses.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LONG SHOT
text: Shooting toward the car from opposite side. View of house
text: and Major and François is covered by car. Car pulls away. We
text: see Major and François moving toward house, chummy,
text: animatedly talking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANÇOIS
dialog: So I said to myself, "All right, if
dialog: he wants to look at them, let him
dialog: look at them. No harm in that." And
dialog: then he said, "Say ah!" And that's
dialog: all I remember ...
dialog: 
text: They disappear into house.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MARIETTE'S LIVING ROOM MED. SHOT
text: Gaston and Giron at door to hall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: (thinking he is the winner)
dialog: So ... You will pack your things at
dialog: once!
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (with deceptive humility)
dialog: Yes, m'sieu.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: And you will be out by tomorrow
dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Very well, m'sieu.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: Otherwise I'll call the police
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Yes, m'sieu.
dialog: (Giron is about to leave.)
dialog: M'sieu Giron!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: What is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (opening a new subject)
dialog: You have enjoyed the confidence of
dialog: this family for more than forty
dialog: years. You must be a man of about--
text: about sixty-five.
dialog: (Giron looks puzzled
dialog: and uneasy.)
dialog: Let's see--
dialog: (Gaston counts on
dialog: his fingers.)
dialog: You will be exactly eighty-seven
dialog: when you come out of prison.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: (outraged)
dialog: What do you mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: You say I am a crook.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: I know it!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (amiably curious)
dialog: Then why didn't you call the police?
dialog: Why don't you call the police?
dialog: (Conversationally.)
dialog: I'll tell you why--you crook, you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: (trembling with indignation)
dialog: M'sieu ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (helpfully)
dialog: Monescu.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: M'sieu Monescu!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (with a smile)
dialog: Just call me Gaston.

dialog: François told the truth.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MED. SHOT ENTRANCE DOOR
text: to Mariette's house. It opens, and Giron emerges, full of
text: dignity and indignation. Gaston, in the doorway, is a
text: smiling host.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (calling after him)
dialog: Good night, Adolph!
dialog: 
text: Giron stops in his tracks as Gaston shuts door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAIRWAY
text: Gaston hastens up. He reaches landing and is about to enter
text: his office, when outer doorbell rings. Exasperated, he
text: hastens down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALL CLOSE SHOT
text: at entrance door. Gaston opens. There stands Giron, furious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRON
dialog: Don't you dare to call me Adolph!

dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAIRWAY
text: Gaston starts up.
dialog: 
text: UPPER LANDING is about to enter office, thinks a moment,
text: then goes toward Mariette's bedroom door.
dialog: 
text: LONG SHOT HER BEDROOM INT.
text: It is dark. Door opens. Gaston enters, shuts door, turns on
text: wall switch, flooding room with light. He moves to a night
text: table by the bed, on which is a small lamp, turns on the
text: lamp, then goes back to wall switch and turns off main
text: lights. Room is now in soft shadow, with only the small
text: light. He turns to window, sees that shade is not down, goes
text: toward the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: of same window from outside. Gaston appears, is just about
text: to pull down shade when he glances toward his own bedroom in
text: other wing of house. He sees:
dialog: 
scene_heading: CAMERA PANS QUICKLY
text: to other wing of house and stops outside Gaston's bedroom
text: window. Behind window stands Lily looking across at him. The
text: situation is clear; she knows the worst. She looks
text: menacingly calm.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MARIETTE'S BEDROOM WINDOW
text: from outside. Gaston is in trouble and he knows it. He goes
text: quickly toward door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: GASTON'S BEDROOM WINDOW
text: from outside. Lily, having seen Gaston leave Mariette's room,
text: pauses, makes up her mind, then draws the curtains closed.
dialog: 
scene_heading: GASTON'S BEDROOM INSIDE CLOSE SHOT
text: at door. It opens. Gaston rushes in, looks toward window,
text: doesn't see Lily, turns, and sees:
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT LILY
text: at the wall safe. She has one hand on the dial and is facing
text: Gaston defiantly.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT GASTON
text: Followed by camera, he goes to Lily.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Are you insane? You've to get out
dialog: of here at once! She may come back
dialog: any minute.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (grimly)
dialog: What time is your rendezvous?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (frantic)
dialog: Now, Lily--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Yes, M'sieu Colet?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (staggered; recovering;
dialog: desperate)
dialog: You have to get out of here!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: That's what I'm here for--to get
dialog: out! I want to get away from here,
dialog: from you--as fast as I can and as
dialog: far as a hundred thousand francs
dialog: will take me.
dialog: (She returns to the
dialog: safe, hand on dial.)
dialog: Sixty-five, ninety-four--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Don't you realize--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
text: Thirty-five to the left--sixty-
dialog: three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for
dialog: another man if he were the biggest
dialog: crook on earth ... Seventy-six,
dialog: eighty-four, fifty-five--
dialog: (Suddenly facing
dialog: him; bitterly.)
dialog: What has she got that I haven't got?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Lily, you must listen to me.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: But, Lily--
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Don't you dare lie to me!
dialog: (Ironically.)
dialog: I know you love me.
dialog: (Pause. He is helpless.)
dialog: Well, why don't you say something?
dialog: Come on--be brilliant. Talk yourself
dialog: out of it--bluff yourself in!
dialog: (Gaston makes an
dialog: effort to speak.)
dialog: Shut up, you liar, you!
text: (She turns back to safe,
text: opens it, looks inside.)
dialog: That's what I want!
dialog: (Taking out the stacks
dialog: of bank notes.)
dialog: This is real! Money! Cash!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STREET
text: in front of Mariette's house. Her car comes, stops.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MED. SHOT HALL
text: Gaston's door. Lily comes out, very excited, closing door
text: behind her. Followed by camera, she runs down steps, across
text: hall, toward entrance door. Doorbell rings. She stops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTLER'S PANTRY
text: Butler in a chair, half-asleep. Bell rings again. He gets up
text: and goes out.
dialog: 
scene_heading: HALL MED. SHOT
text: at entrance door. Lily has disappeared. Butler comes, opens
text: door. Mariette enters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTLER
dialog: Good evening, madame.
dialog: 
text: Sweeping past him, followed by camera, Mariette goes up
text: stairs. She pauses at her bedroom door. Changing her mind,
text: she goes to Gaston's door. She knocks.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MED. SHOT MARIETTE'S BEDROOM DOOR
text: from hall. Gaston opens the door. He sees Mariette, smiles,
text: and opens her door very wide, welcoming her to her own room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT MARIETTE
text: at Gaston's door to his office-and-bedroom suite. She smiles
text: at him enigmatically. Instead of responding, she opens his
text: door and goes in, leaving door open. As she goes she gives
text: him another smile, as if to say, "This is where it's going
dialog: to be."
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT GASTON
text: puzzled, but not worried. He closes her door and goes toward
text: his own door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON'S BEDROOM
text: Mariette stands in the center of the room. Gaston enters,
text: closes door, goes toward her. Camera moves to close shot of
text: both. She embraces him--they kiss. Then, languorously, she
text: takes off her wrap. He helps her. She drops wrap on bed.
text: Then she reaches for her necklace with the seductive air of
text: a woman about to disrobe. She takes off the necklace, the
text: jeweled pin on her bosom, then her bracelets and rings.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
text: (as he watches her;
dialog: a lover, but careful)
text: When a lady takes her jewels off in
dialog: a gentleman's room, where does she
dialog: put them?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (gallantly)
text: On the night table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (provocatively)
dialog: But I don't want to be a lady.
text: She kisses him lightly and moves out of the picture, the
text: jewels in her hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT SAFE
text: Mariette enters with the intention of opening the safe.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP GASTON
text: He is startled. He goes quickly toward her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT SAFE
text: Mariette is about to turn the dial. Gaston enters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (helpfully)
dialog: May I?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (again with that
dialog: smile; playful)
dialog: Ah, let me have a little fun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (playing the game; graciously)
dialog: Please!
dialog: (He moves away.)
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT ARMCHAIR
text: Gaston enters, sits on the arm of the chair, and leans back,

speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (beginning to dial)
dialog: Now let me see--sixty-five, ninety-four--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Thirty-three--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: No--thirty-five!
dialog: (She laughs.)
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP GASTON
text: He laughs, too. They are apparently having a jolly time.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP MARIETTE
text: She continues to dial.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: Thirty-five ...
dialog: (Very casually.)
dialog: You know, François--M'sieu Filiba--
dialog: thinks you're a very remarkable man.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP GASTON
text: For one swift instant his face tells us that now he knows

speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (with pretended innocence)
dialog: Yes, Gaston?
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT MARIETTE AND GASTON
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: What would you say if you found
dialog: your safe had been robbed?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: I wouldn't say anything--I would
dialog: act.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Call the police?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
text: Instantly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (as if to say,
dialog: "It's a good idea")
dialog: Um-hum ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (lightly)
dialog: But why talk about robbery on a
dialog: night like this?
text: She pauses--is it ironically? He is not quite sure. He
text: takes a last chance.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (ardently)
dialog: You look beautiful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (Turning back
dialog: coolly to safe.)
dialog: Seventy-six, eighty--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (rising; the game
dialog: is over)
dialog: Mariette!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: Yes, Gaston?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: You have been robbed--for years. And
dialog: not a hundred thousand francs, but
dialog: millions. And you know who did it?
dialog: Adolph.
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: Adolph?
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Adolph J. Giron.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (laughing at him)
dialog: And you expect me to believe that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Naturally not. But I expect the
dialog: police to believe it.
dialog: (He goes out to
dialog: night table.)
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT NIGHT TABLE
text: Gaston enters, picks up telephone.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT MARIETTE

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT TELEPHONE
text: Mariette enters, takes receiver out of Gaston's hand, sets
dialog: it back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: No!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Why not? He's a thief--he's a
dialog: criminal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: I don't believe it!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Then why are you afraid to let me
dialog: prove it?
dialog: 
text: Mariette turns away. She is beginning to suspect there might
dialog: be truth in what he says.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (ironically)
dialog: It would be a terrible scandal,
dialog: wouldn't it?
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (to herself)
dialog: Giron...!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Yes, Giron! Chairman of the board of
dialog: Colet and Company. Honorary
text: president of the Orphans' Asylum.
dialog: Adolph J. Giron--distinguished
dialog: citizen! ... Well, shall I call the
dialog: police?
dialog: (Mariette's silence
dialog: eloquently says no.)
dialog: I see! You have to be in the social
dialog: register to keep out of jail. But
text: when a man starts at the bottom and
text: works his way up--a self-made crook
dialog: --then you say, "Call the police!
dialog: Put him behind bars! Lock him up!"
text: (He glares at her
text: indignantly, then
dialog: goes to the safe.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT SAFE
text: Gaston enters, gives the dial one turn, and safe opens. The

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT MARIETTE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: I don't seem to have my calling

dialog: permit me to introduce myself
dialog: informally--Gaston Monescu. I
dialog: assure you in my own circles I am
dialog: very well known.
dialog: 
text: Mariette looks at him sadly for a moment. She gets up,
text: restraining tears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: You wanted a hundred thousand
dialog: francs, and I thought you wanted
dialog: me.
text: Gaston is deeply moved. Mariette turns, moves sadly toward
dialog: window.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT WINDOW
text: Curtains are now open. We see the church steeple--the same
text: one we saw romantically before. Mariette enters and leans
text: her head against the window, her back to the camera. The
text: church clock strikes eleven.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT GASTON
text: He is crushed. Followed by camera, he goes to her, stops at
dialog: her side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: I came here to rob you--but
dialog: unfortunately I fell in love with
dialog: you.
dialog: (No reaction.)
dialog: Mariette!
dialog: 
text: She turns, looks at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: Why did you take the money?
dialog: 
text: Gaston is speechless; the truth is too complicated.
text: Despairing, she goes. He stands looking after her. We hear
text: her steps as she crosses the room; then we hear the door
text: shut. He turns to the window. Suddenly he stares toward
text: Mariette's bedroom window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: Mariette's bedroom window from outside. Behind the window

scene_heading: MARIETTE'S BEDROOM CLOSE SHOT
text: at door to corridor, from inside. Mariette enters. Suddenly
text: she turns, and she too is dumbfounded, because she sees:
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT WINDOW
text: from Mariette's viewpoint. Lily is still looking out at
text: Gaston, her back to Mariette. She hears the door close,
text: turns, sees Mariette, takes in the situation at a glance,
text: and goes, proudly direct, toward her.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT MARIETTE
text: Lily enters. They face each other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Madame, the only thing that seems
dialog: to stand between you and romance is
dialog: a hundred thousand francs. Well, he
dialog: didn't take it.
dialog: (She brings the bank
text: notes out of her jacket.)
dialog: I took it--all by myself. Now you
dialog: can have your romance!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (scornfully)
dialog: I think you'd better go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Ever had a romance with a crook?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: I beg your pardon!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Let me give you a little advice.
dialog: When you embrace him, be sure to put
dialog: on your gloves. It would be too bad
dialog: if your fingerprints were found ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever
dialog: your name is--I thank you for your
dialog: advice, but I must ask you to go.
dialog: You've got your money--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (violently)
dialog: I don't want your money!
dialog: 
scene_heading: MED. SHOT ALL THREE

speaker_heading: LILY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (freeing herself)
dialog: Leave me alone! You were willing to
dialog: sacrifice a hundred thousand francs
dialog: for her.
text: (She turns to Mariette,
dialog: sizes her up.)
dialog: Well--
dialog: (she has a sudden idea)
dialog: she's worth it!
dialog: [(To Mariette.)

text: He dashes to door, goes out, closes door. Behind the door we
text: hear their excited voices. Mariette goes a step closer to the
text: door. She is in a state confused suspense. Suddenly the
text: voices cease. We hear, muffled, a woman's footsteps running
text: down the stairs. Then, following, a man's footsteps. Then
text: silence. Now, Mariette, followed by camera, goes to the bed
text: and sinks into it heartbroken: she will never see Gaston
dialog: again.

dialog: Goodbye.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: Divine ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning,
dialog: if you should wake out of your

text: maid with a breakfast tray, stands
text: a policeman with a warrant--then
dialog: you'll be glad you're alone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: But it could have been glorious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GASTON

dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP MARIETTE

speaker_heading: MARIETTE

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT GASTON

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT MARIETTE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIETTE
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello ... Yes ... What? ... Yes ...
dialog: No, no. Thank you very much, but
text: the handbag has been found
dialog: (sadly and with
dialog: another meaning)
dialog: exactly two weeks and three days
dialog: ago.
dialog: (She hangs up.)

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TAXICAB MOVING AT NIGHT ALONG PARIS STREETS
text: Close shot of Gaston and Lily. There is a strained silence
text: between them. Gaston smiles toward her. He is trying to
text: make up, but she sits frozen. He smiles again, anticipating
text: the surprise he has in store for her. He reaches for the
text: pearls in his pocket. A look of dismay crosses his face--
dialog: the pearls are not there! He looks in all his pockets, can't
text: find them. Suddenly, with suspicion, he looks sidelong at
text: Lily. She responds to his look with a triumphant smile. From
text: her bosom she brings forth the string of pearls and holds it
text: up. He is amazed, can't figure it out. She reaches behind and
text: brings forth a handbag, which we recognize as the one
text: originally stolen from Mariette, and she drops the pearls
text: into the bag. Gaston is now smiling with admiration, yet he
text: looks sly. As Lily drops in the pearls she glances into the
text: bag. Her expression changes. Something is missing. She looks
text: suspiciously toward Gaston. Nonchalantly, he draws, from his
text: inside breast pocket, the precious bank notes, and slips them
text: too into the bag. They smile at each other. Together forever,
text: they embrace and kiss.
