scene_heading: INT. RITCHIE’S APARTMENT/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Rain trickles down the window. A flash of lightning lights
text: the room. The couch is folded out into a bed. A BEAUTIFUL,
text: NAKED BLONDE is stretched out across it, asleep.
text: RITCHIE BOLAND, late 30’s, not the biggest guy around, but
text: rock-solid, stands in the small kitchen a few feet away.
text: His face is stuck in a permanent frown.
text: He takes sips of his coffee and admires her from the
dialog: counter.
text: The sheets barely cover her moonlit curves.
text: He walks over and tucks her in.
scene_heading: EXT. DARK ALLEY - NIGHT
text: It’s pouring rain. Ritchie’s car squeezes between the
text: buildings. Its headlights can barely make it through the
dialog: downpour.
scene_heading: INT. RITCHIE’S CAR - TRAVELING
dialog: Ritchie drives.
text: SAMMY “TWO-BALLS”, late 30’s, sits in the passenger seat.
text: His skeletal features draped in shadow.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Look at this shit. What we do
dialog: for money, eh Ritchie?
text: Ritchie's eyes go to the rearview mirror.
scene_heading: EXT. DARK ALLEY
dialog: They stop.
scene_heading: INT. RITCHIE’S CAR
text: Ritchie kills the engine. Sammy looks out at the rain.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Check it out.
scene_heading: EXT. DARK ALLEY
text: Ritchie gets out. The rain is relentless. He’s soaked
dialog: instantly.
text: The lightning helps him inspect his surroundings. The
text: buildings have their backs to him. He looks up at the fire
text: escapes... nothing.
scene_heading: INT. RITCHIE’S CAR
text: Ritchie drops into his seat. He shakes off the cold rain.
text: Some of it lands on Sammy.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Jesus!
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Sorry, Sammy.
text: Sammy pats the drops away. Ritchie blows into his freezing
text: hands and buries them into his wet pockets.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: This motherfucker better be on
dialog: time. We’re gonna drown out
dialog: here.
scene_heading: EXT. DARK ALLEY
text: The rain pummels the car.
scene_heading: INT. RITCHIE’S CAR
text: Water streams down the windows as they wait. Ritchie shakes
text: to keep warm, his hands still in his pockets. Sammy stares
text: into the dark storm.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
text: The vultures are circling,
dialog: Ritchie.
text: Ritchie looks at him.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
text: Some asshole cop is trying to
text: push me into a corner.
text: He turns to Ritchie.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Heard he’s tossing deals to my
text: people, waiting for a bite.
text: Ritchie doesn’t break eye contact. THUNDER breaks the
dialog: silence.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Did he talk to you?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: No?
text: Sammy’s hand comes up from his side holding a gun.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Should I ask again?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: You’‘1ll get the same answer.
text: Sammy studies Ritchie’s face.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: If I find out you so much as
dialog: waved to that prick, Ritchie...
dialog: I’m gonna turn your pretty,
dialog: little blonde girlfriend into a
dialog: redhead, I swear to God.
text: Ritchie’s eyes turn cold.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: And you? I’m gonna hang you by a
text: power line like an old pair of
dialog: sneakers. I’ve done worse for
dialog: less.
text: Ritchie is a statue.
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: You think I’m scared of you?
dialog: (long, uncomfortable
dialog: beat)
dialog: Look me in the eye, Ritchie...
dialog: Look me in the eye and tell me
dialog: you’re not --
text: BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! Smoke and broken glass everywhere.
text: Sammy crashes back into his seat. The rain comes through
text: the broken window and washes over him. His eyes still
text: locked on Ritchie.
text: The nose of Ritchie’s .45 sticks out of a smoking hole in
text: his jacket.
scene_heading: EXT. DARK ALLEY
text: Ritchie drags Sammy’s body out into the rain. He hurries
text: back to his car and drives away... LIGHTNING... Sammy’s
text: dead eyes stare up at the darkness... THUNDER.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL/WAITING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Ritchie wakes up in a hard chair and a cold sweat. He
text: straightens himself out.
text: The JANITOR is mopping the floor near the coffee machine.
text: A NURSE approaches. Ritchie gets to his feet.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Still fighting?
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Yes, still fighting.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Would you like to see him?
text: He takes a long look down the hall...
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET/RITCHIE’S CAR - NIGHT
text: Ritchie’s arm hangs out the window. A cigarette smolders
text: between his fingers.
text: He throws a glance at the empty passenger seat. THE WINDOW
dialog: Is INTACT.
text: He looks out at the convenience store across the street.
scene_heading: INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT
text: Ritchie winces at the bright fluorescents as he enters.
text: The CLERK watches him as he makes his way to the fridges.
text: He pulls the door open and grabs a large can of beer.
text: He drops the giant can on the counter and reaches into his
dialog: pockets.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Smokes... cheap ones.
text: Ritchie spots a cute teddy bear on display nearby. He grabs
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: This, too.
text: The clerk slides the pack of smokes across the counter and
text: punches up the total. Ritchie pulls out a few crumpled
dialog: bills.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Thirteen fifty.
text: Ritchie counts the wrinkled paper in his hands. He reaches
text: into his pockets for some more... nothing. He looks up at
text: the clerk’s expressionless face.
scene_heading: EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT
text: Ritchie walks out with only the smokes in his hands. He
text: tosses the wrapper away and tucks the pack into his jacket.
text: He looks up at the building right next to the store.
text: He heads for the entrance.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING/HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Faded wallpaper lines the hall. Ritchie approaches the door
text: at the end of it.
text: He brings his ear to the flaking wood. He hears GIGGLING
text: coming from inside.
text: He knocks.
scene_heading: INT. TOMMY’S APARTMENT
text: The place is a mess.
text: TOMMY, a strung-out junky, leaves his equally strung-out
text: GIRLFRIEND on the couch and heads for the door. He trips on
text: a few obstacles on his way there.
text: She takes a hit off her pipe.
text: He looks through the peephole.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: HALLWAY
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Open the door, Tommy.
speaker_heading: APARTMENT
speaker_heading: GIRLFRIEND
dialog: (exhaling)
dialog: Who is it, baby?
text: Tommy motions to her to keep quiet.
speaker_heading: HALLWAY
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Open up or it’s coming down.
speaker_heading: APARTMENT
speaker_heading: GIRLFRIEND
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Who the fuck is it?
text: Tommy puts his finger to his lips to shut her up.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: (to the door)
dialog: Okay! Okay! Hold on!
text: He points to the coffee table. It’s covered in dirty
text: dishes, beer bottles, napkins... She tries to figure out
text: what he’s pointing at and then realizes it’s the knife
text: resting on the half-eaten pizza.
text: She rushes the knife over to him and disappears into the
dialog: bedroom.
text: Tommy holds the knife behind his sweaty back. He turns the
text: deadbolt.
text: Ritchie walks in and takes in the scene...
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Where’s the girl?
speaker_heading: GIRLFRIEND (O.S.)
dialog: I’m calling the fucking cops!
text: Ritchie throws Tommy a heavy look.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Get out here, baby!
text: She emerges from the bedroom, tweaking and shaking.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Do you know why I’m here?
text: They decide to try their luck.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: No.
text: Ritchie takes a deep breath and looks them both over...
text: HE RAMS HIS HEAD INTO TOMMY’S NOSE and sends him crashing
text: to the floor like a sack of shit.
text: The knife flies across the room. The girl rushes to it. She
text: picks it up and points it at Ritchie.
text: Tommy thrashes around on the floor, clutching his bleeding
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: (to Tommy)
dialog: Where is it?
speaker_heading: GIRLFRIEND
dialog: Leave us alone!
text: Ritchie makes his way to the girl.
text: The tip of the blade scrapes the lapels of his leather
text: jacket. He studies her ragged features...
text: Tears run down her cheeks.
text: IN A FLASH, his hand sweeps in and grabs her wrist.
text: She puts up a pretty good fight before letting the knife
text: drop. He kicks it away. She’s really shaking now.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Sit down.
text: She drops into the couch, defeated.
text: He notices some cash on the table. He grabs it.
text: He makes his way back to Tommy.
text: Blood pours from Tommy’s nose. He tries to wipe it from his
text: mouth and eyes, but it’s everywhere.
text: Ritchie looks through Tommy’s pockets, but comes up short.
text: He gives the girl a look before turning Tommy over onto his
dialog: belly.
text: Ritchie drops his knee onto the back of Tommy’s neck and
text: pins him to the floor.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: I’m not asking again, Tommy.
text: With one hand on Tommy’s wrist, the other grabs hold of his
text: elbow. Ritchie puts on the pressure...
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: The bowl! It’s in the fucking
dialog: bowl!
text: Ritchie looks up at the girl. She jumps to her feet and
text: scurries to the bathroom.
text: Ritchie watches her as she lifts the lid off the tank and
text: pulls out a baggy with little vials in it.
text: She hurries back and tosses it at him.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Is that all of it?
text: Tommy is face down in a puddle of blood and spit.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Yeah! That’s all of it! Now get
dialog: off me!
text: Ritchie looks up at the girl. She stands in anticipation.
text: He looks back down at the mess on the floor and without
text: further hesitation... HE PULLS TOMMY’S ELBOW BACK WITH A
text: VIOLENT JERK and dislocates the guy’s shoulder.
text: Tommy screams and flops around on the floor. His arm
text: dangles from its socket. His girlfriend rushes to him in
text: horror as he thrashes hysterically.
text: Ritchie picks up the baggy and walks out.
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT
text: Ritchie enters. The clerk greets him with no expression.
text: Ritchie grabs the teddy bear from the display, slaps the
text: money he swiped on the counter, and splits.
scene_heading: EXT. RITCHIE’S APARTMENT BUILDING/SIDEWALK - NIGHT
text: The street is packed with crumbling buildings and parked
text: cars. POLICE SIRENS fade in the distance.
text: Ritchie stands in the cool night. He takes smoke from his
text: cigarette deep into his lungs.
text: Approaching headlights blast his features.
text: A car stops in front of him.
text: He flicks his cigarette into the darkness.
text: The window rolls down to reveal
text: NIKKI JERGENS, late 20’s, a little rough around the edges,
text: but hot as hell. Her smile shines through her long, dark
text: bangs.
scene_heading: INT. NIKKI’S CAR
text: Ritchie drops into the passenger seat.
text: Nikki reaches up and turns on the light. He reaches up and
text: turns it off.
text: He fingers his inside pocket and produces the baggy with
text: the vials. He hands it off to her and she slaps a small
text: stack of bills into his waiting hand.
text: Nikki unscrews one of the vials and spills a little bit of
text: its contents onto her wrist. She snorts it back fast and
text: hard while Ritchie counts his money.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Shit!
text: She shuts her eyes tight and rubs her nose.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Take it easy.
text: He gets back out into the cool night.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: What are you doing for lunch
dialog: tomorrow?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Meet me at the diner. My treat.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: What’s the occasion?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Job offer. Freelance. Great
dialog: opportunity.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: For you or for me?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: (big smile)
dialog: For us.
text: He gives her a nod and walks off.
speaker_heading: NIKKI (0.S.)
dialog: Hey!
text: He turns.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: It was good seeing you again.
text: He continues on his way. She watches him for a beat before
text: taking another hit of the white powder.
scene_heading: INT. RITCHIE’S APARTMENT BUILDING/HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Ritchie notices someone standing by his door.
text: MIKE MOONY, early 60’s, decked out in a stained wife-beater
text: and shorts, greets Ritchie with a fake smile.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Mike.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You’re a hard guy to catch. Your
dialog: schedule’s all over the place.
text: Ritchie unlocks the door.
text: Mike loses the smile and gets in closer.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Three months you owe me,
dialog: Ritchie... I need at least one
dialog: or you’re out on your ass.
text: Ritchie stares him down. Mike backs away.
text: He reaches into his pocket and pulls out his new wad. He
text: takes the top twenty from the bundle and slaps the rest
text: into Mike’s sweaty palm.
text: Mike smiles at the size of it. Giant yellow teeth take up
text: most of his face.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Was that so hard?
text: Ritchie leaves him in the hall.
scene_heading: INT. RITCHIE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Ritchie tosses his keys onto the short kitchen counter by
text: the door.
text: A lamp lights up the place. The teddy bear sits up against
text: a pillow on the folded out couch.
text: A few frames on a nearby table show PICTURES OF HIM AND
text: THAT BEAUTIFUL BLONDE FROZEN IN GOOD TIMES.
text: He throws his jacket across the room. It lands on an
text: already full chair, next to a WOODEN CRIB.
text: He drops onto the bed, picks up the bear and gives it a
dialog: little squeeze.
dialog: 13.
scene_heading: INT. RITCHIE’S CAR - DAY - TRAVELING
text: Ritchie drives in silence. Large, expensive houses pass him
dialog: by.
scene_heading: EXT. BOBBY GOLDEN’S HOUSE - DAY
text: Ritchie pulls up to the sprawling estate.
text: He’s already smoking as he gets out of his car.
text: CHUCK, a mountain of black muscle, greets him at the front
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Man, put that out.
text: Ritchie takes one last drag and flicks it away.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Nigga, did I tell you to toss
dialog: that shit onto my boy’s lawn?
text: Ritchie thinks about it.
text: He reluctantly makes his way across the lawn.
text: He reaches down, picks up the butt, and holds it up to
dialog: satisfy Chuck.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: You better wrap that shit ina
dialog: Kleenex and put it in your
dialog: pocket.
text: Ritchie enters the house.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: I better not find it floating in
text: one of the toilets again,
dialog: either!
scene_heading: EXT. BOBBY GOLDEN’S HOUSE/POOLSIDE
text: Ritchie steps through the patio doors and into a backyard
text: oasis. He shoves the cigarette butt into a nearby plant.
dialog: 14.
text: A MAN is doing laps in the pool.
text: TALIA, early 20’s, brown and glistening, barely covered in
text: a white bikini, is laying flat on her belly, taking in the
dialog: sun.
text: Her mirrored sunglasses catch his reflection as he
text: approaches.
text: He waves his hand in front of her face to no reaction.
text: He gives her the finger.
speaker_heading: TALIA
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: That’s not nice.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: What lap is he on?
speaker_heading: TALIA
dialog: I stopped counting.
text: Ritchie takes a seat on the deck chair beside her.
speaker_heading: TALIA
dialog: Can you put some lotion on my
dialog: back?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: I don’t want to get my hands
dialog: dirty.
speaker_heading: TALIA
dialog: That’s too bad.
text: BOBBY GOLDEN pulls himself out of the pool. He’s pushing
text: 50, but not going quietly. His fat gold chain glows against
text: his dark skin. He pulls on a robe.
text: He joins them with a huge smile.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Ritchie!
text: Ritchie stands up and goes in for the wet hug.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You want something to drink?
text: Bobby leans in.
text: He gives her a
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: How about a coffee?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Coffee? It’s like a hundred
dialog: degrees out here. How about
dialog: something with ice? Something
dialog: from a bottle?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I don’t think she knows how to
dialog: make coffee, man.
speaker_heading: TALIA
dialog: I could make coffee.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Then go make some coffee!
text: slap on the ass that gets her to her feet.
text: She struts away.
dialog: They watch her
dialog: doors.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: And put something on for
dialog: chrissake! We’ve got company!
text: shake and bake all the way through the patio
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: So how’s it going? How’s your
dialog: boy? He still hanging in there?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Well, I suggest you do the same.
dialog: At least you’re keeping busy.
dialog: Heard you helped Nikki settle a
dialog: little problem.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Yeah. She called in a favor.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Favor, huh? She’s a freaky
dialog: fruit, that one. I can show you
text: a picture of her from three
dialog: years ago that’1l empty your
text: balls in three seconds flat.
text: Bobby reaches for a DVD case that’s been sitting on the
text: patio table next to him.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: My dad used to tell me: “Your
dialog: cock and your signature... watch
dialog: where you put ‘em’.
text: He tosses it to Ritchie.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: That should take your mind off
dialog: things.
text: Ritchie examines the box. A buxom beauty graces the cover -
text: giant tits pushing out of a prison jumpsuit - “The Hard
text: Cell” in fat pink letters across the bottom.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (O.S.)
dialog: You like porno?
text: Ritchie tosses the box back onto the table.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You need to go see a guy for me.
dialog: I dropped some dough into one of
dialog: his productions and all I’ve
dialog: seen so far is that box. He’s
dialog: not returning my calls. I need
dialog: you to give him a message for
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: You want me to... talk to him?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah, talk. Bring me my money.
text: The address is on the box.
text: Bobby gets up and throws off the robe.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You gonna wait for that coffee?
dialog: I’m telling you, it’s gonna be a
dialog: while.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Nah, I’m gonna get going.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I’1l see you later.
text: Bobby gets back in the water.
text: Talia meets up with Ritchie.
speaker_heading: TALIA
dialog: Good news: the water’s boiling!
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Rain check?
speaker_heading: TALIA
dialog: Seriously? You don’t know what
dialog: you're missing.
text: He walks away.
speaker_heading: TALIA
dialog: Hey! Can I ask you something?
dialog: Between you and me? Do you like
dialog: it? You know... hurting people?
text: Ritchie gets in close and serious.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Some people need to get hurt.
scene_heading: INT. DINER - DAY
text: The place tries hard to look like an old-fashioned diner,
text: but in the bright daylight, it just looks old. A few
text: customers are enjoying their lunches as Ritchie walks in.
text: He eyes the booths and spots Nikki.
text: He joins her.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Hey, you made it.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: I never pass up a free lunch.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: That’s good because that’s
dialog: exactly what I need to talk to
dialog: you about.
text: The WAITRESS shows up.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Coffee?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Please.
text: She smiles and pours.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Always with the coffee.
text: He takes a long sip.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: A friend of mine is gonna join
dialog: us. She’s got a situation that
dialog: you need to hear about. I’1l be
dialog: back.
text: She slides out of the booth.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: (wink)
dialog: Gotta go powder my nose.
text: He sits back and takes in the view outside.
text: A car SCREECHES across the lot and brakes hard into a spot.
text: GWEN DUROVA, late 20’s, platinum blonde and leggy, jumps
text: out of the driver’s side and rushes into the diner.
text: Ritchie watches her. Her movements are quick and erratic.
text: She stomps to the booth and jumps in.
dialog: 19.
text: He takes another long sip.
speaker_heading: GWEN
dialog: Where’s Nikki?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Little girls’ room.
speaker_heading: GWEN
dialog: She fill you in?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: GWEN
dialog: Great.
text: The WAITRESS shows up smiling again.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Coffee?
speaker_heading: GWEN
dialog: Fuck off.
text: Her smile fades. She scrams.
text: Gwen looks like she’s been up for a couple of days. Ritchie
text: sips his coffee and watches her.
text: Gwen’s eyes widen as Nikki returns and slides in next to
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: (big smile)
dialog: Hey!
text: Nikki grabs her hands.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: You alright?
text: Gwen throws her a shaky nod.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Ritchie, this is Gwen. This is
dialog: our free lunch.
text: Ritchie continues to sip his coffee.
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: (to Gwen)
dialog: Go ahead.
text: Gwen gathers herself before starting.
speaker_heading: GWEN
dialog: My husband keeps a gym bag full
dialog: of money in our closet. I’ve
dialog: never counted it, but there must
dialog: be about fifty grand in there,
dialog: easy. You and Nikki are welcome
dialog: to all of it.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: How's that?
speaker_heading: GWEN
dialog: My husband is a cocksucker. He’s
dialog: a very successful, very
dialog: wealthy... cocksucker. And I
dialog: don’t want him breathing
dialog: anymore.
text: Ritchie throws Nikki a cool stare.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Right. Well, good luck with
dialog: that.
text: He jumps out of the booth and heads for the exit.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: (to Gwen)
dialog: I‘1l handle this. Don’t worry.
text: She catches up with him.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Hey! What’re you doing?
text: Ice cold stare right at her.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Outside.
text: He throws the door open and storms out.
text: Nikki looks over at Gwen before following.
dialog: 21.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT/RITCHIE’S CAR
text: Ritchie drops into the driver’s seat. Nikki gets in next to
dialog: him.
scene_heading: INT. RITCHIE’S CAR
text: He watches Gwen through the window. She tries to stay calm,
text: but looks more and more out of place.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: I can’t help her.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: We’re talking some serious money
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: We’re talking murdering some
dialog: poor bastard in cold blood.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: If it’s any consolation, the
dialog: guy’s an asshole.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: It’s not.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: This is a fucking retirement
dialog: fund, man. We’re gonna be set
dialog: for a long time.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: We get caught: we get put away
dialog: for a long time.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: I don’t understand what the
dialog: problem is. Whatever it is that
dialog: you do and whatever it is that I
dialog: need you to do, are like the
dialog: same fucking thing.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: You’re right, you don’t
dialog: understand.
dialog: 22.
text: Nikki notices Gwen shift around in her seat, eyeballing
text: them hard through the window.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Listen, she’s gonna bail. 1/11
dialog: fucking do it without you. I
dialog: don’t need to share.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: You’re not gonna do anything.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Yeah, I will. You don’t know how
dialog: bad things are.
text: Her face finally loses its smile. Ritchie takes a good long
text: look at her. He turns back to the nervous wreck inside.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Who is she?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
text: An old friend.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: How old?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: She’s cool, okay?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Who’s the husband?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Some accountant or something.
dialog: Does it make a difference?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Yeah, it makes a difference.
dialog: Fifty grand - that’s a lot of
dialog: money - someone’s gonna miss
dialog: that. Successful accountant -
dialog: someone’s gonna miss him, too.
dialog: Something like this needs
dialog: planning, research, time --
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: No time. She wants it done
dialog: today.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Today? You’re out of your mind.
dialog: Anything happens to this guy
dialog: today, how hard is it gonna be
dialog: for someone to remember all of
dialog: us chit-chatting over here?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Are you gonna help me or not?
text: He waits for her smile to come back. It doesn’t.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Tell her I can make it look like
dialog: a robbery; put the prick in the
dialog: hospital for a while. But I’m
dialog: not killing anybody, and
dialog: definitely not today.

speaker_heading: RITCHIE

dialog: Calm her down. We'll find
dialog: another way.
text: Her smile slowly creeps back.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: I’‘1l1 see what she says.
text: He watches her. She makes her way inside and back to the
dialog: booth.
text: Gwen listens to every word. Nikki’s lips stop moving.
text: Gwen mouths something to her. Nikki turns to the window and
text: slowly shakes her head.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Shit.

dialog: desk across from
text: TRENT ROTHSTEIN, mid 40’s, balding, greasy, wearing an
text: expensive suit and a cheap mustache.
text: The office is small and dank. The far wall is covered in

text: couch. Beneath the collage: the couch.
text: She chews gum as he looks through some papers and makes a
dialog: few notes.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Rosie Cheeks?

speaker_heading: TRENT

speaker_heading: HEATHER

text: He looks up and smiles.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: That’s a good answer.
text: She returns the smile.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: It says here that you’ve done
dialog: some modeling. What are we
dialog: talking, Internet?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Uh-huh.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: (back to his notes)
dialog: Have you done anything like this
dialog: before?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: You mean, “Make movies”?
text: Trent stops writing. He looks up at her again, this time
text: without the smile.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Films... yes.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Not really.
text: He looks her over carefully...
speaker_heading: TRENT

speaker_heading: HEATHER

speaker_heading: TRENT

speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I don’t have a boyfriend.
dialog: 26.
text: The smile is back.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: That’s another good answer.
text: He makes a final note in his papers and sits back with the

dialog: more.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Any questions before we get
dialog: started?
text: She shifts in her seat.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Um... well... I have Herpes.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: (still smiling)
dialog: Okay?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I was told that you don’t care
dialog: about that stuff.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: I wouldn’t say that I don’t
dialog: care. I do, however, manage to
dialog: work around “that stuff”. Hey,
dialog: we all gotta eat, right?
text: She looks more at ease.
text: He reaches into his desk and pulls out a small digital
dialog: camera.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Heather, I’d like to take some
dialog: pictures now, if that’s alright
dialog: with you. See what kind of
dialog: treasures you got hiding
dialog: underneath all of that awful
dialog: clothing.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Sure.
text: He gets to his feet. He motions to her to do the same.
dialog: 27.
text: She unzips her sweatshirt. Her skin-tight t-shirt struggles
text: to hold down her giant breasts.
text: Trent fumbles with his camera.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Everything?
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Please.
text: She sits on the couch and unlaces her sneakers.

speaker_heading: BETTY (V.0O.)
dialog: (over speaker, filtered)
dialog: Mr. Rothstein? There’s a

speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: BETTY (V.O.)
dialog: (over speaker, filtered)
dialog: He says he’s an associate of

speaker_heading: TRENT

speaker_heading: BETTY (V.O.)
dialog: (over speaker, filtered)
dialog: Um...
text: Trent looks up, annoyed.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: You have me on speaker again,

speaker_heading: BETTY

speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Big enough for what?
speaker_heading: BETTY

speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Stall him.
speaker_heading: BETTY
text: He’s already on his way.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Great!

speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Heather, we’re gonna have to
dialog: reschedule, but so far, I love
dialog: what I’m seeing.
text: He pushes her clothes into her chest and leads her to the
dialog: door.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Betty will give you everything
dialog: you need on your way out -
dialog: paperwork, release forms,
dialog: standard shit. We’ll call you.
text: He pushes her into the hallway just as Ritchie shows up. He
text: escorts him in with a forced smile.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Hey, give me one second. Have a
dialog: seat.
text: Trent sits at his desk and straightens himself out a bit.
text: He puts his notes into one neat pile.
text: Ritchie takes a seat in front of him.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Great girl. Big... big future.
dialog: So... what can I do for you?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: (deadpan)
dialog: Bobby wants his money.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Really? Well, you can tell Bobby
dialog: the film’s in post. He’s gonna
dialog: have to wait like everybody
dialog: else.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: I’m not his secretary.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: I don’t know what else to tell
dialog: you.
text: Ritchie eyes him for a moment.
text: He takes in the scene. He notices the wall across the room
text: with the dirty collage and the dirtier couch.
text: He turns his attention back to Trent.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: I’m leaving here with a fistful
dialog: of your money or a fistful of
dialog: your teeth. I’1ll give you a
dialog: minute to decide which one you’d
dialog: like to part with today.
text: Trent’s face goes cold.
text: He casually reaches into his drawer. He pulls out a gun.
text: He lays it on the desk.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: You know what that is? It’s
dialog: goodbye.
text: The two men are in a standoff.
text: Ritchie glances between the piece on the desk and Trent’s
dialog: smug face...
text: A VIOLENT KICK TO THE DESK sends the whole fucking thing
text: flying into Trent’s ribs. He’s thrown backwards onto the
dialog: floor.
text: Ritchie leaps over the desk and lands hard on top of him.
text: Trent gasps for air under the weight.
text: His collar disappears into Ritchie’s clenching fists as
text: he’s lifted off the floor. Trent tries to bat Ritchie’s
text: hands away, but they don’t budge. His shirt starts to choke
dialog: him out.
speaker_heading: PETE (0.S.)
dialog: Let him go.
text: Ritchie loosens his grip. Trent drops to the floor.
text: PETE SOMMERSED, early 50’s, a gorilla dressed like a man,
text: hogs the doorway.
text: Ritchie gets to his feet. Trent crawls away.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: I thought I smelled dogshit.
text: Trent makes it to the couch. Pete crosses the scene.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: I think the fucker broke a rib!
text: Pete picks up Trent’s gun from the floor and examines it.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: It’s a prop.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I know.
text: He pulls back his jacket and reveals a holstered .38; a
text: detective badge hangs off his belt.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: This one isn’t.
text: He lifts the chair and straightens it out.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I need you to sit down, Ritchie.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: You know this guy?
text: Pete takes a seat behind the desk.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Sit down.
text: Ritchie sits. Pete plays with the prop gun.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: It’s been a long time.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Seems like yesterday to me.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You still holding that grudge,
dialog: huh? I did you a favor, man. If
dialog: I hadn't stepped in, you’d be up
dialog: to your larynx in prison cock
dialog: right now.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: What do you want, Pete?
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Actually, believe it or not, I
dialog: might have some more work for
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: What’re you doing?
text: Pete raises his finger and shuts Trent up - eyes still on
dialog: Ritchie.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: I paid my debt.
text: Pete finds that funny.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Debt? You’re never done owing
dialog: the devil, Ritchie.
text: A BUZZING comes from Ritchie’s jacket. He pulls his phone
text: out just enough: “Nikki cell” flashes on the screen. He
text: quickly presses a button and silences it.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: I didn’t come here for a job.
dialog: Call an ambulance. Your friend
text: doesn’t look too good.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You come work for me again and
dialog: you'll be hitting the big
dialog: time... or at least the bigger
dialog: time.
text: BUZZING again. Nikki again. He ignores it again.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: I never worked for you. Get it
dialog: straight.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Call it what you want.
text: BUZZING again. Ritchie shuts it off.
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: I’m here for Bobby’s money. If
dialog: you don’t have it, I’11l be back
dialog: tomorrow. If you don’t have it
dialog: then, I’1l be back the next day,
dialog: and the next. And I can’t
dialog: guarantee how many bodily
dialog: functions your friend over there
dialog: will still have control of until
dialog: I get it.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Bobby, huh?
text: Pete takes a second before turning around to Trent.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Give him the money.
text: Trent massages his chest. His shirt is still wrinkled from
text: the tussle.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: It’s in whatever's left of my
dialog: desk.
text: Pete struggles with the drawer. He opens it and pulls out a
text: fat envelope. He tosses it to Ritchie.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: See? We can all be friends.
text: Ritchie grabs the envelope. He opens it and runs his thumb
text: across the bills inside.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: There’s a hell of a lot more
dialog: where that came from. You’re
dialog: wasting your time running fetch
dialog: missions for Bobby. Think about
dialog: it. My door is always open.
text: Ritchie puts the envelope away He takes one last look
text: around and is out the door.
text: Pete’s face turns to stone.

speaker_heading: BOBBY

text: Bobby turns the TV off.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: I need the work, Bobby, but I
dialog: don’t need the bullshit.
speaker_heading: BOBBY

dialog: talk about?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: He tried to recruit me.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Work.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Work? Come here.

speaker_heading: BOBBY

speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Why would you send me there?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Hey, money’s money, right? I
dialog: don’t send you on jobs for fun.
dialog: I already apologized now get

dialog: line forming behind you. At
dialog: least you got something out of
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: You shouldn’t have sent me
dialog: there, Bobby.
text: Bobby tenses up.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Don’t tell me what I should or
dialog: shouldn’t do. Take a step back
dialog: and realize where your place is,
dialog: Ritchie. You’re lucky I’m not
dialog: making you pick up my dry
dialog: cleaning at this point. We go
dialog: way back, but that doesn’t mean
dialog: we have to go any further.
text: Ritchie looks around. He pulls out the fat envelope from
text: his jacket and drops it on the table.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: I know my place, Bobby. You
dialog: don’t need to remind me. But if
dialog: you put me in a situation like
dialog: that again, I’m coming back here
text: and redecorating.
text: Chuck stands up.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: We’re done, Ritchie. No more
dialog: handouts. Walk away or crawl,
dialog: it’s up to you.

text: He doesn’t get through that door
dialog: again.
scene_heading: INT. RITCHIE’S BUILDING/HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: TWO BIG GUYS are on their way down the hall as Ritchie

text: FRANKY wears a shiny green tracksuit and

text: on Ritchie. The two men disappear into his apartment.
text: Ritchie ignores them.
dialog: 37.
scene_heading: INT. RITCHIE’S APARTMENT
text: The place is dark. Ritchie tosses his keys on the counter
text: and heads for the bathroom.
speaker_heading: BATHROOM
text: He turns on the light. The mirror is fogged up. He runs a
text: finger across it. He hurries out.
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
text: The light from the bathroom reveals Nikki sitting on the
text: floor near the window. Her hair is wet. Her hands are
text: shaking. He approaches with caution.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: What are you doing here, Nikki?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Regrouping.
text: He gets closer. Her eyes are somewhere else.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: I fucked up.
text: He lifts her chin up.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: You need to tell me what
dialog: happened.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: I need a priest.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: What did you do?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: I did like you said. I tried to

speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: How?

text: Gwen lets out a DEEP MOAN.

scene_heading: INT. GWEN’S HOUSE/BEDROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: A large duffel bag drops at Nikki’s bare feet.
text: Gwen rummages through her closet. She sets off an avalanche
text: of shoeboxes. She grabs the one she wants.
text: She approaches Nikki. Their noses are red, their eyes,
text: watery and alive.
text: Gwen hands her the box. Nikki holds it as Gwen lifts the
text: lid. She reaches in and pulls out a revolver.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: GWEN
dialog: Look. It’s all here. See?

speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Holy shit.
speaker_heading: GWEN
dialog: Take it.

speaker_heading: GWEN
dialog: I‘1l call him. Right now, I’11
dialog: call him and I’11 tell him to
dialog: come home. I’1l say we’ve been
dialog: robbed. I’11 get him here.
dialog: Please do it. Please.
text: Nikki struggles with the situation. She says nothing. She

speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Listen, Gwen. I --
text: BANG! The gun goes off and sends Gwen's brains flying

text: Her face is covered in blood; her hands still gripping the
text: revolver; her eyes wide open.
scene_heading: INT. GWEN’S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Nikki dials her phone. Brains and blood are caked on her

speaker_heading: NIKKI

text: picks up her shoes and gets the fuck out of there.
dialog: 41.
scene_heading: EXT. GWEN’S HOUSE - DAY
text: Nikki walks out barefoot into the quiet street. She takes
text: quick, nervous steps to her car. She gets in and peels out.
scene_heading: INT. RITCHIE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT (PRESENT DAY)
text: Ritchie is speechless. Nikki sits, rubbing her hands.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Did anybody see you?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: I don’t think so. But the gun
dialog: made a lot of noise.
text: Ritchie paces. He peeks out at the street from the cracks
text: in the curtains.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: There’s something else.
text: Nikki reaches into the darkness beside her and pulls out
text: the duffel bag. She slides it over to Ritchie.

speaker_heading: NIKKI (0.S.)
dialog: There’s a lot more than fifty

speaker_heading: RITCHIE

text: the screen.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Where’s your phone?
dialog: 42.
text: Nikki rushes to her feet. She throws open her jacket.

speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Oh, fuck!
text: Ritchie’s face tenses. The BUZZING doesn’t stop.
speaker_heading: NIKKI

dialog: You saw?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You did good by calling me

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You said you found her like

speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: I did not know she was so

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I’m gonna clean this up for you,

speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: Anything you want.
speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: What are you saying?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You don’t squeak. You got

speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: DIMITRI

speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: Is there any way we can keep

text: He watches Nikki make neat little stacks of hundreds on the
text: living room floor. One last bill is placed on one last
dialog: pile.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Two-fifty... even.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Two-fifty.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: What do you wanna do?
text: Smoke spews from his lips.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: You think the cop knows about
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: I don’t know what he knows. I
dialog: know what he wants.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: What does he want?
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Blood.
text: The machine BEEPS; the coffee’s ready. He turns to the
text: waiting mugs.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: How do you take it?
dialog: CLICK! CLICK!
text: He turns. Nikki has a gun in her hand.
text: She makes her way to him. He keeps his eyes on the gun.
text: She sets it down on the counter.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: I was gonna do it, Ritchie. I
dialog: was gonna blow him away for
dialog: her... for that pile of paper
dialog: over there.
text: Her gaze drifts towards the little money village on the
text: living room floor.
text: He reaches out slowly and takes the gun. He flicks the
text: safety on and slides it away from her.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Why can’t we just run?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Do you know who this guy is?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Some dirty cop?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: That’s a fucking understatement.
text: She gets back to the stacks. He sips and watches her as she
text: gets on the floor.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Do you remember the guy I used
dialog: to run with? Sammy “Two Balls”?
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Do you know what happened to
dialog: him?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: He was shot. Drug deal gone
dialog: sideways, right?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: This “dirty cop”... He busted
text: Sammy one day with half a key in
text: his pants, but instead of
text: booking him, he tried to make a
dialog: deal... Sammy didn’t make deals
dialog: with cops.
text: Nikki runs her hands through the stacks.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: So he shot him?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: No. He wanted to make an example
dialog: out of him... He had a dozen
dialog: dealers just like Sammy in his
dialog: pocket. Not to mention cookers,
dialog: junkies, gangbangers, psychos
dialog: and half of the downtown police
dialog: department. He had a reputation
dialog: to protect.
text: The cash covers the floor now.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
text: He makes a call one day and
dialog: sends Sammy a message that not
text: only makes it to his ear, but
text: right through his fucking skull.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Where were you?
text: Ritchie struggles with the answer.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: I delivered it.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: (looks up)
dialog: No shit?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: He caught me with blood on my
text: hands about a month earlier.
dialog: Figured we can “help each other
dialog: out”.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: How much blood?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Enough to put me away for a long
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: So, let’s make a deal, then.
dialog: Either that or we kill him.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: I thought of that. Dirty or not,
dialog: though, he’s still a cop. That’s
dialog: a hard kill.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: What do you wanna do, then?
text: Ritchie looks at the thick carpet of money at her feet.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Got any blow left?
scene_heading: INT. RITCHIE’S APARTMENT BUILDING/MIKE’S DOOR - NIGHT
text: MRS. DELUCA, decked out in curlers and a bathrobe, shows up
text: and knocks. There’s some COMMOTION coming from inside.
text: The door opens and Mike greets her with a big yellow smile.
text: She looks inside and sees Franky and Rocco sitting at a
text: table in the middle of the room. It’s covered in beer
text: bottles and stacks of poker chips.
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Mrs. DeLuca, how are you?
scene_heading: MRS. DELUCA
dialog: How am I? That jerk in 3C is
dialog: smoking again. My kids are
text: trying to do their homework, but
dialog: instead they’re getting lung
dialog: cancer!
text: Mike throws a glance down the hall.
scene_heading: INT. RITCHIE’S DOOR
text: Mike knocks. Mrs. DeLuca watches from a distance.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Open up, Ritchie!
text: He turns to Mrs. DeLuca and gives her a nod.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Ritchie! If you don’t open this
dialog: goddamn door, I’m gonna call the
dialog: cops and they can --
text: The door opens a crack. Ritchie’s eyes are wild - cigarette
text: dangling from his lips.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Fuck off.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Fuck off? This is a non-smoking
dialog: building, you understand? People
dialog: are trying to live here... Put
dialog: it out or get out.
text: Ritchie shuts the door. Mike looks over at Mrs. DeLuca. She
text: shakes her head.
text: He gathers himself and bangs on the door again.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Ritchie! If you don’t put that
dialog: shit out, I’m gonna come in
dialog: there and put it out for you, I
dialog: swear to Christ!
dialog: 50.
text: The door opens fast and wide. Mike jumps back.
text: Ritchie steps out and holds up a thin stack of cash.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Fuck. Off.
text: Mike cautiously approaches and takes it from him.
text: He takes a quick peek inside and sees Nikki sitting in the
text: pile of money, doing a line of coke off her wrist.
text: Ritchie gets back inside and shuts the door.
text: Mike stands for a beat, thinking.
text: He heads back to his apartment. He counts the bills as he
text: walks by Mrs. DeLuca.
scene_heading: MRS. DELUCA
dialog: That's it?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Go home, Mrs. DeLuca.
text: He shuts the door behind him.
scene_heading: INT. RITCHIE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Ritchie grabs the gun from the counter and makes his way to
text: the couch. He picks up the duffel bag.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Come on. We gotta go.
text: He tosses the gun into the bag and begins filling it with
text: handfuls of money from the floor. She watches him.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: How many people have you killed?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: what?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: He found you with blood on your
text: hands. Counting Sammy, that’s at
dialog: least two, right?
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: I wouldn’t say they were people.
dialog: Ten years ago, you catch me with
dialog: a smoking gun, I surrender, no
dialog: problem. What did I know? But...
dialog: after five years inside... your
dialog: perspective changes a bit. You
dialog: tend not to wanna go for the
dialog: repeat. After that, the choice
dialog: between smoking some lowlife and
dialog: doing hard time again isn’t a
dialog: choice at all.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: I’ve never killed anyone before.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: It was an accident. Don’t
dialog: torture yourself.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: What am I supposed to do?
text: He avoids the question. Continues to fill the bag.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Do you believe in God, Ritchie?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: (filling the bag)
dialog: What's the difference?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: It changes things.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Oh, yeah?
speaker_heading: NIIKI
dialog: Yeah. We’re either a bunch of
dialog: meat and bones, or there’s a
dialog: soul swimming around in here
dialog: somewhere.
text: His eyes go to the teddy bear on the kitchen counter.
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: If he’s just make-believe, we
dialog: have nothing to worry about, but
dialog: if he’s out there... we’re in
dialog: deep shit.
text: He’s done filling the bag.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: I wouldn’t worry too much about
dialog: God.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Look around... he ain’t here.
text: There’s a KNOCK at the door. They look at each other.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Maybe that’s him.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Get your stuff.
text: Ritchie goes to answer it...
text: THE DOOR IS KICKED IN, smashing him over the face. He’s
text: sent flying across the room.
text: Nikki jumps to her feet.
text: Franky and Rocco enter the apartment followed by Mike. He
text: Manages to get the rattled door closed behind him. She
text: grabs the duffel bag.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: What do you retards want?
text: Mike paces behind his two large friends. Ritchie tries to
text: catch his breath.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: My sister has a boy with Down
dialog: Syndrome. Great kid. That term
dialog: cuts like a knife every time I
dialog: hear it.
dialog: 53.
text: Mike looks around.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: We’re gonna take all that dough
dialog: I saw you rolling around in
dialog: earlier, plus whatever’s left of
dialog: that shit you were putting up
dialog: your nose.
text: Mike sizes her up.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: And while we’re at it, I think
dialog: we'll have that dirty mouth of
dialog: yours wrapped around our cocks
dialog: later, too. Your boyfriend,
dialog: here, can watch.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: He’s not my boyfriend.
text: Franky licks his lips. Nikki reaches into the bag.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I think I‘1l have Franky knock
dialog: your teeth out first, though...
dialog: you look like a biter.
text: Ritchie spits out some blood.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Take your boys and go, Mike.
dialog: That’s all the warning you’re
dialog: gonna get.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Are you serious?
text: Ritchie stumbles to his feet.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I’m not giving you a warning,
dialog: Ritchie. I’m making you a
dialog: promise - a promise that these
dialog: men will do terrible things to
dialog: you and your girl tonight if you
dialog: don’t step aside.
dialog: 54.
text: Ritchie’s shoulders and neck let out a couple of awful
text: cracks as he straightens out.
text: He looks over at Nikki. She has her hand deeper in the bag.
text: Their eyes meet.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: (to Mike)
dialog: This isn’t a fair fight.
text: Nikki’s hand is elbow deep in the duffel bag.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: You should go get a couple more
dialog: guys.
dialog: Everyone is frozen...
text: Mike laughs.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Fuck him up, boys.
text: Franky winds up a powerful right that slices through the
text: air. Ritchie ducks out of the way and lands a knee hard
text: into his ribs. His elbow follows fast and shatters Franky’s
dialog: jaw.
text: Franky’s body slumps to the carpet, revealing Rocco coming
dialog: right for them.
text: He lunges at Ritchie and is stopped in his tracks by a big
text: boot to the balls. A ferocious right to Rocco’s face sends
text: blood and spit flying onto Mike’s wife-beater.
text: He’s knocked out instantly and crashes to the floor at
text: Mike’s feet.
text: A yellow smile appears on Mike’s sweaty face.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Bygones?
scene_heading: INT. RITCHIE’S APARTMENT BUILDING/HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Mrs. DeLuca mumbles to herself as she storms towards
text: Ritchie’s door.
dialog: 55.
text: MIKE COMES CRASHING THROUGH IT and hits the wall hard. He
text: doesn’t get up. Mrs. DeLuca screams.
text: Nikki and Ritchie step through the shattered doorway and
text: disappear down the hall.
scene_heading: INT. RITCHIE’S CAR - NIGHT
text: They jump in. Ritchie puts the key in, but doesn’t turn it.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: What are you waiting for?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: We have to make a stop.
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL/PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Ritchie’s car pulls into a spot.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Wait here.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Sure. I’1l watch the bag.
text: He doesn’t smile back.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL/HALLWAY
text: Ritchie walks with the duffel in his hands. Nikki catches
text: up with him.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: You know, technically, that’s my
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: When this is over, you’1ll get
dialog: your cut.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: My cut? You steered clear
dialog: remember? I’m the one who got
dialog: the fucking brain facial.
dialog: 56.
text: He looks around trying to find his way. She stops him
text: before he turns down another hallway.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Hey! Seriously, we split the
dialog: money now. We go our separate
dialog: ways. Fuck deals. Fuck the cop.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: He’s gonna find you.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Let him. He has my cell phone.
dialog: So what?
text: The nurse spots Ritchie and approaches.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: This guy goes into people’s
text: closets, pulls out all their
text: skeletons and dangles them over
dialog: their heads every chance he
dialog: gets. I’ve seen your closet. You
dialog: don’t want him in there.
text: She quiets down.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Mr. Boland?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Can I see him now?
text: She throws a probing look at Nikki.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: I‘1l see what I can do.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL/NURSERY
text: Ritchie washes his hands. A sign next to the sink tells him
dialog: how to do it properly.
text: Above his head is a shelf labeled “CLEAN”. It’s covered in
text: folded hospital gowns. He puts one on over his clothes.
text: He follows the nurse to a lone incubator near the back
dialog: window.
dialog: 57.
text: The nurse steps aside with a smile and reveals a tiny body
text: inside - blindfolded, attached to a mess of wires and
text: tubes, little chest breathing heavily.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: It’s alright.
text: Ritchie pulls the teddy bear out and rests it on the
text: plastic box.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Take your time.
text: He examines the helpless little guy in the box.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL/WAITING ROOM
text: Nikki sits with the duffel bag in her lap.
text: The nurse goes to the nearby coffee machine and drops some
text: change in its slot. She pushes some buttons and waits for
text: the machine to do its thing. She glances at Nikki while she
dialog: waits.
text: Nikki can see into the nursery down the hall. She watches
text: Ritchie with a frown.
speaker_heading: NURSE (0.S.)
dialog: Going through something like
dialog: this alone must be impossible.
dialog: You must be a good friend.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: (cold)
dialog: I’m not his friend.
text: THE MACHINE FUCKS UP AND COFFEE SPILLS EVERYWHERE. The
text: nurse jumps and tries to control the mess.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Shit!
scene_heading: INT. RITCHIE’S CAR - NIGHT - TRAVELING
text: Ritchie is focused on the road. Nikki throws glances at him
text: through the silence.
dialog: 58.
scene_heading: EXT. “PINK MONKEY STUDIOS” /STREET - NIGHT
text: Ritchie’s car comes to a stop.
scene_heading: INT. RITCHIE’S CAR
text: He kills the engine.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: You ready?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Well, get ready.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: When were you gonna tell me?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Tell you what?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: About, whatever that was back
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: I wasn’t.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Just like that? What we had -
dialog: that doesn’t entitle me to some
dialog: answers?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: That was a million years ago and
dialog: no, it doesn’t. Let’s go.
scene_heading: EXT. RITCHIE’S CAR
text: He jumps out. She stays put.
text: He comes around to her side. She stares out the windshield
text: without even blinking.
dialog: 59.
text: He looks around... The street lamps sparkle in the wet
dialog: pavement.
text: He lights a cigarette, takes a deep drag and drops his head
dialog: in defeat.
dialog: He knocks
dialog: She rolls
text: on her window.
text: it down; her eyes still focused on the street.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: There was a girl... Things got
text: serious, but then quickly turned
dialog: to shit, so she bailed. Showed
text: up six months later with a sob
text: story and a baby-bump.
text: She finally turns to face him.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: How do you know it’s yours?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: I don’t.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Where is she?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
text: A blast from her past saw her
text: crossing the street one day and
dialog: decided to run her over with his
dialog: camry.
text: A car speeds by and interrupts him.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: They managed to save the kid,
dialog: but he won’t wake up... They
dialog: tell me I’m wasting my time and
dialog: money - that I should pull the
dialog: plug and move on. His
dialog: heartbeat’s stronger than mine
dialog: and they’re telling me to shut
text: it down like it’s nothing.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: What are you holding on to? That
dialog: kid doesn’t belong here.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Like you said... we’re more than
dialog: just meat, right?
text: He flicks his cigarette into the street.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: You think buying a teddy bear is
dialog: gonna absolve you of all your
dialog: sins, Ritchie? Wake up. You’re
dialog: not a father. You don’t bring
dialog: people into this world, you take
dialog: them out. Let’s take this money
dialog: and get the hell out of here.
text: He walks away.
scene_heading: EXT. “PINK MONKET STUDIOS” /ENTRANCE
text: She jumps out and catches up to him at the door.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: What do you think this guy is
dialog: gonna ask us to do? Paint his
dialog: house? We take the money and
dialog: run... right now.
text: Ritchie pushes the door bell.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: We need to end this right. Pete
dialog: is one loose end you don't want
text: dangling in the wind.
text: The door BUZZES open. Ritchie enters. She hesitates before
dialog: following.
scene_heading: INT. “PINK MONKEY STUDIOS”/TRENT’S OFFICE
text: Pete sits in Trent’s chair with Nikki’s phone in his hands.
text: He looks through its contents.
text: Trent is occupied with Heather on the couch. He whispers
text: bullshit into her ear and she fakes a few giggles. She’s
text: practically bursting out of a skin-tight dress.
text: Ritchie and Nikki walk through the door. Pete stands up.
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (to Nikki)
text: We meet at last. The pictures on
dialog: this phone do not do you
dialog: justice.
text: He reaches out his hand.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Peter Sommersed... Detective
text: Peter Sommersed.
text: Her eyes go to Ritchie. Pete takes back his meaty paw.
text: They sit down. He continues browsing through her phone.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: There are a lot of pictures in
dialog: here. Some of them, I have to
dialog: confess, I already jerked-off
dialog: to, but a few others... I’m just
dialog: not that into.
text: He flips the cell over so they can see a picture of a
text: bloodied Gwen on the screen. He shuffles blindly to more
text: shots of her from different angles.
text: Nikki’s face goes white.
speaker_heading: PETE (0.S.)
dialog: I’m no Ansel Adams, but --
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: What do you want, Pete?
text: He puts the phone down.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I live in the shade, Ritchie, as
dialog: you know. I pull the strings on
dialog: dozens of puppet shows, but that
dialog: doesn’t mean I’m not a serious
dialog: businessman. This... studio...
dialog: is one of the good ones. We make
dialog: quality movies here.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Films.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Films... The talent, as you can
dialog: see, is top notch.
text: Ritchie looks over at Heather.
speaker_heading: PETE
text: Cash and pussy go in and out of
dialog: here like fucking clockwork.
dialog: Most of it lands right into our
dialog: laps, too, but a lot of it...
text: doesn’t quite make the trip.
text: He leans in closer.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (To Nikki)
dialog: Can you give us a minute, honey?
dialog: Maybe ten?
text: Nikki looks around.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Where do you want me to go?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Trent! Why don’t you give this
dialog: young lady the tour?
text: Trent drops Heather in a flash and gets to his feet.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: of course!
text: He straightens his tie and pats down his hair as he struts
text: to the desk. He gives her his hand.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: (to Pete)
dialog: I don’t want the tour. I wanna
dialog: know what I need to do to get
dialog: out of this shit.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (deadpan)
dialog: You need to take the tour.
text: Nikki looks at Ritchie. He nods.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Whatever.
text: She walks out. Trent follows.
text: Pete turns around to Heather who is still on the couch.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You, too, sweetheart.
text: Heather jumps up and jiggles all the way out the door. Pete
text: gets back to business.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: In order for this machine to
dialog: keep working, we have to deal
dialog: with certain silent partners;
dialog: backers that provide various,
dialog: necessary services that keep the
text: whole thing moving smoothly.
dialog: These guys... they partnered up
dialog: with a local financier and made
dialog: him their official talent scout.
dialog: The guy’s a fucking scumbag.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: That’s funny.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: He takes all the best girls and
dialog: leaves us with scraps. So
dialog: instead of getting a decent
dialog: stable set up, we’re left
text: scrounging the bottom of the
dialog: pile every time. Make-up and
dialog: lighting can only do so much.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Seems like a no-brainer. Your
dialog: reach should go way past this
dialog: type of shit.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Believe it or not, it doesn’t.
text: He leans back again, hesitating for once.
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: PETE
text: The backers are in the Russian
dialog: mob.
text: Ritchie’s face goes cold.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: And, like I said, they’re head-
dialog: over-heels for this jerk-off, so
text: he’s not budging.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Russians?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I don’t want this to go down
dialog: like a regular hit. I need it to
dialog: be done different.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Different? How long is it gonna
dialog: take for the Russians to find
dialog: out who fucked up their new BFF?
text: Ritchie pulls out his pack of smokes and lights up.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: This morning, I show up and
dialog: there you are, like a fucking
dialog: sign, so I asked... You said
dialog: “no”. Now... you’re here...
text: He holds up the phone.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: And here... So, I’m asking
dialog: again. Same deal as last time.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Asking, huh?
text: Ritchie lets out a cloud from his lungs.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: What do you mean by “different”?
text: Pete leans in closer.
dialog: 65.
scene_heading: EXT. MANSION - NIGHT
text: A monster of a house is perched on the edge of a cliff.
speaker_heading: PETE (V.O.)
dialog: He throws a party every Friday
dialog: night.
text: The driveway wraps around the front. Expensive cars are
text: everywhere. A PAIR OF LONG LEGS pops out of one of them.
speaker_heading: PETE (V.O.)
text: He invites new talent to his
dialog: house every week for some fucked
dialog: up meet ‘n’ greet. Invite only.
scene_heading: INT. MANSION/REC ROOM - NIGHT
text: The long legs are escorted through the party - about a
text: dozen half-naked men and women, drinking, dancing,
dialog: snorting, fucking, you name it.
scene_heading: INT. MANSION/BEDROOM
speaker_heading: PETE (V.O.)
dialog: He likes to handpick his stock,
dialog: so he makes sure to be there
dialog: every time.
text: A FIGURE sits in the shadows, waiting. He takes a sip of
text: his drink as the legs stop in front of him. The shoes come
text: off and the dress drops to the floor.
scene_heading: INT. “PINK MONKEY STUDIOS”/TRENT’S OFFICE
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Trent’s bringing Heather
dialog: tonight... plus two.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Tonight? I need at least two
dialog: weeks for a job like this, and
text: with the Russians sniffing
dialog: around, two weeks if you’re
dialog: lucky.
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I don’t have two weeks. You
dialog: don’t have two weeks. There’s
dialog: nothing to plan here. I’m
dialog: telling you how I need this to
dialog: go down. You should be taking
dialog: fucking notes.
text: Ritchie leans back and sucks back some more smoke.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Russians aren’t gonna have a
dialog: hard time getting to that guest
dialog: list.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Everyone there’s gonna be zonked
dialog: out of their asses. Get him
dialog: alone. Make it look like an
dialog: overdose.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Overdose? Give me the address.
dialog: I‘1l wait until the party’s
dialog: over, get him alone, pop him in
dialog: his sleep.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: If there’s even one fucking clue
dialog: left behind that this was a hit,
dialog: the Ruskies will scour the earth
dialog: for our asses. This way, they’11
dialog: chalk it up to poor judgment.

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: He’s a pill-popper. He’s gonna
dialog: think it’s his birthday.
text: Ritchie grabs the bottle and examines it.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You gotta look like you’re there
dialog: to fuck and take names. Wipe
dialog: that frown off your face and get
dialog: into character.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: You’re not giving me much time
dialog: to prepare. Overdose? Tell me to
dialog: turn this guy into hamburger
dialog: meat and I won’t bat an eye, but
dialog: this... I’m not exactly dressed
dialog: for the part, either.
speaker_heading: TRENT (0.S.)
dialog: You can grab something from
dialog: wardrobe.
text: Ritchie turns around. Trent stands with the girls by his
text: side. Nikki is decked out in a slinky little number and in
text: full makeup.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: There’s one more thing you need
dialog: to know.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: His name... it’s Bobby Golden.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Bobby?
text: Ritchie looks at Nikki. She throws him a pissed “I told you
dialog: so” look.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: He’s not your friend, Ritchie.
dialog: He’s not worth this second
dialog: thought. What did he tell you
dialog: about me? Did he come clean? My
dialog: guess is “no”. We’ve been down
dialog: this road before. You’re torn
dialog: up, I get it, it sucks, but
dialog: there’s no time to discuss this
dialog: any further.
dialog: (gets up)
dialog: You leave in an hour.
text: Pete walks out. Trent and Heather take off right after.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: That's it?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: I’m thinking.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Not one of your strong suits.
text: Ritchie dials his phone and paces.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Come on, Bobby. Pick up.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: What’s the plan?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
text: He’s not answering.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: This is it... we take the back
dialog: door out of here.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: We play along; we go to Bobby's;
dialog: I‘1l figure something out.
text: His eyes lock onto hers.
scene_heading: INT. “PINK MONKEY STUDIOS”/LOBBY - NIGHT
text: Pete leans up against the front desk. Trent horses around
text: with Heather near the door. Ritchie shows up wearing a
text: cheesy, shiny gray suit. Somehow, he makes it work. Nikki
text: follows close behind.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: (to Pete)
dialog: We’re done after this. No more
dialog: deals.
text: Pete holds up Nikki’s phone with a dead Gwen still up on
text: the screen.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You’1l get it back when it’s
dialog: over.
dialog: 69.
text: He puts the phone in his pocket.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: As for future business together,
dialog: well... that’s up to you, isn’t
dialog: it?
text: He gives Ritchie a dirty smile.
speaker_heading: TRENT (0.S.)
dialog: Let’s go!
text: Ritchie heads for the door where everyone is waiting.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Hey!
text: They all turn. Pete approaches. He reaches into Ritchie's
text: pants and pulls out his gun.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: My way, remember?
text: Pete slides the gun into his own pants and walks away.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: (to Ritchie)
dialog: You drive.
text: He tosses Ritchie the keys.
scene_heading: EXT. TRENT’S MERCEDES - NIGHT - TRAVELING

speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: (to Ritchie)
dialog: Hey! I heard about you and
dialog: Sammy.
dialog: 70.
text: Ritchie eyes him in the rearview mirror.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: If that’s how you treat your
dialog: friends, I’d hate to see what
dialog: you do to your enemies.
text: Ritchie’s eyes are locked onto Trent. Trent drops the
dialog: smile.
scene_heading: EXT. BOBBY GOLDEN’S HOUSE/DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
text: The Benz makes its way around. It passes a couple of parked
dialog: cars.
speaker_heading: TRENT (V.O.)
dialog: Looks like we’re early.
text: They stop and get out. Ritchie looks up at the house.
scene_heading: EXT. BOBBY GOLDEN’S HOUSE/ENTRANCE
text: The door opens and IOSIF, a boulder of a man with no neck
text: and no personality, blocks the way.
text: Ritchie and Nikki exchange worried glances.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Iosif. You look fetching
dialog: tonight. Let me guess... new
dialog: chin?
text: Iosif stares them all down. He motions to Trent to raise
text: his arms. Trent obliges and Iosif proceeds to pat him down.
text: He gives Ritchie the same gesture. Ritchie lifts his arms.
text: Iosif finds the small pill bottle.
text: Ritchie doesn’t break eye contact.
text: Iosif pockets them. He looks over at Nikki and Heather.
text: Their dresses cling to their bodies like plastic wrap. He
text: smiles and steps aside.
dialog: 71.
scene_heading: INT. ENTRANCE HALL
text: Iosif leads them across the empty hall.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Where’s the party, Slim?
scene_heading: INT. REC ROOM
text: They turn the corner and enter. They stop in their tracks.
text: Bobby is hunched over on the couch; face down on the coffee
text: table. Blood pools under his face.
text: Talia is sprawled across a nearby couch. Dead.
text: Chuck lies motionless a few yards away. Also dead.
text: Dimitri sits on the couch beside Bobby, smoking a cigar.
text: Alexei stands close by as Iosif mans the exit.
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
text: The party is over.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: What the fuck is this, Dimitri?
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: You came here to do same thing,
dialog: yes? I save you trouble.
text: Trent fumbles.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: We came here to party. New
dialog: girls, new guy, see?
text: Heather is becoming an expert with the fake smiles. Dimitri
dialog: likes what he sees.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: (to Ritchie)
dialog: That’s Gwen’s husband. The
dialog: cocksucker.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Pete set us up.
dialog: 72.
text: Dimitri gives Iosif a nod. Iosif steps forward and drives a
text: fist into Ritchie’s back, sending him to his knees.
text: He grabs Nikki and drags her to Dimitri.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: (fighting)
dialog: Get off me!
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Hey! Hey! Take it easy, Dimitri!
text: Dimitri examines Nikki’s face.
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: Where is my money?
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: (butting in)
dialog: What money?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: I don’t have it.
text: Ritchie gets to his feet.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: I have the bag.
text: All eyes on Ritchie.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Listen, Dimitri, whatever’s
dialog: going on, it looks like you have
dialog: everything under control here.
dialog: So, we're just gonna get outta
dialog: your hair and go party some
dialog: place else, alright?
text: Trent and Heather turn and get a face full of Iosif.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Tell Frankenstein to go easy on
dialog: the girl and I’11 tell you where
dialog: it is.
text: Dimitri gives Iosif another nod.
text: Iosif rushes over and knocks Ritchie out cold.
dialog: 73.
scene_heading: INT. IOSIF’S CAR/TRUNK - NIGHT
text: MUFFLED RUSSIAN RAP MUSIC fills the darkness.
text: Ritchie wakes up. His wrists are tied. He manages to get to
text: his phone. He turns it on to a “no signal” screen. The
text: light illuminates the tight space.
text: Bobby’s body is crammed in next to him, wrapped in plastic.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Hey!
text: He kicks and screams until the music stops.
text: The trunk opens. Alexei blocks the moonlight. He pulls
text: Ritchie out. His phone goes flying in the struggle.
scene_heading: EXT. CABIN/BACKYARD - NIGHT
text: They’re in the middle of nowhere. Darkness surrounds them.
text: A small cabin sits in the distance; the lights are on
text: inside. AN OLD WOODEN SHED sits a few yards away from it.
text: Alexei drags Ritchie by the car. Iosif sits on the hood.
text: Headlights illuminate the ground.
text: They pass Talia and Chuck, also wrapped in plastic, dead in
dialog: the dirt.
text: A bit closer and Ritchie sees Nikki, chest deep in a hole,
text: shoveling.
text: Alexei throws him to the ground. She’s excited to see him.
text: Makeup and sweat run down her face. She drops her shovel
text: and claws at the edge of the hole to get closer.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: We’re fucked, Ritchie. We’re so
dialog: fucked.
speaker_heading: IOSIF (0.S.)
dialog: (thick Russian accent)
dialog: Where is money?
text: Ritchie gives Nikki a reassuring nod and gets to his feet.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: One last time... Let her go.
text: A DEAFENING GUNSHOT rings out through the night air.
text: Nikki collapses into a pile of dead weight and disappears.
text: Ritchie’s eyes go wild. He drops to his knees and reaches
text: into the darkness after her, but only comes up with
text: fistfuls of dirt.
text: Dimitri emerges with a gun in his hand. Trent right behind
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: A shame. She was very good
dialog: digger.
text: Ritchie turns quick, his eyes burning with rage. The goons
dialog: stand by ready for anything.
text: Dimitri hands Alexei the gun and he holsters it.
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: (to Trent)
dialog: Talk.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Yeah, okay.
text: Trent circles around to Ritchie. He keeps his distance.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Listen, Ritchie... these guys
dialog: are not negotiating. I know what
dialog: they’re saying sounds a lot like
dialog: questions but they’re really not
dialog: asking. Just tell them where the
dialog: money is.
text: Heavy breathing comes from Ritchie but not one move.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: They’re gonna put you in that
dialog: hole with her. Is that what you
dialog: want?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Where’s Pete?
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: TRENT
text: He’s on his way.
text: Alexei and Iosif drag Talia and Chuck to the hole. They
dialog: toss them in.
text: Trent throws Dimitri a look before getting in a bit closer.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: (quiet)
dialog: Pete said you have a kid in the
dialog: hospital.
text: Ritchie’s eyes go to Trent.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Do you want these guys to go see
dialog: him? Because if I tell them,
dialog: that’s exactly what they’1l do.
dialog: They’11 go bring your boy back
dialog: here and put him right there in
dialog: that hole, too.
text: Ritchie looks at Trent hard.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: I’m waiting for Pete.
text: Trent gives up and heads back to Dimitri.
speaker_heading: TRENT
text: He’s waiting for Pete.
text: Dimitri gives Alexei a nod. They drag Ritchie to the nearby
text: shed. They toss him in like a rag doll and bolt the door
text: behind them.
text: The men walk to the cabin. Iosif stops and turns his car
dialog: off.
scene_heading: INT. SHED - NIGHT
text: Ritchie sits up and tries to make out his surroundings. The
text: shed is empty except for some buckets, a few empty crates
text: and a beat-up bicycle.
text: He bites at his restraints but the rope doesn’t give.
dialog: 76.
scene_heading: INT. CABIN/KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: The kitchen looks like it hasn’t been touched since the
dialog: seventies.
text: The men take their seats at the table. Trent tries to
dialog: comfort Heather.
text: Alexei turns on a small radio and RUSSIAN RAP fills the
text: room. Iosif takes Heather from the hand and leads her to
dialog: the table.
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: You dance, yes?
text: She throws a concerned look at Trent and he throws her back
text: a reassuring nod. She climbs up onto the table.
speaker_heading: SHED
text: Light comes shining through the shed’s wood planks. Ritchie
text: gets to his feet. He looks through the cracks.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE’S POV
text: A car approaches. It stops. The door swings open. Pete
text: steps out. He walks to the cabin.
scene_heading: INT. CABIN/KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Heather is giving the men a pretty good show.
text: Pete enters. Trent jumps up.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Pete! What the fuck, man?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Sit down.
text: Trent sits down. Heather stops dancing. Alexei turns down
dialog: the radio.
dialog: Heather starts
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (to Dimitri)
dialog: Tell me I didn’t come all the
dialog: way to this shithole for a
dialog: fucking bachelor party.
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: (eyes on Heather)
dialog: I make call to bosses. They are
text: upset, but not surprised.
dialog: (to Heather)
dialog: Please, continue.
text: shaking her stuff again.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: So we're good?
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: No, not good.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What do you mean? I give you the
dialog: assholes that blew your wife’s
dialog: head off and you take care of
dialog: Bobby. We’re all good.
text: Alexei turns the music up again.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: (to Pete)
text: Dimitri noticed a big “bag ‘o’
text: cash” missing from his closet.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: How big?
speaker_heading: TRENT
text: Two hundred and fifty Gs.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Where are they?
speaker_heading: TRENT
text: The girl’s in the hole.
dialog: Ritchie’s in the shed?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Where’s the shed?
dialog: 78.
scene_heading: INT. SHED - NIGHT
text: The door swings open. Pete stands in the doorway with
text: Dimitri’s goons behind him. Ritchie sits in the corner.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Get him up!
text: He storms out as they storm in.
scene_heading: EXT. CABIN/BACKYARD - NIGHT
text: Ritchie is dragged back to the hole.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Leave us.
text: The goons go to the car. Ritchie can barely stand.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I need that money, Ritchie.
text: Ritchie looks him in the eyes.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: I need a cigarette.
text: Pete watches him carefully.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (to the goons)
dialog: Hey! Do either of you meatheads
dialog: smoke? “Sigareta”?
text: Alexei approaches.
text: He pulls out his pack and hands Pete a cigarette. Ritchie
text: notices Alexei’s gun, holstered inside his jacket.
text: Pete puts the cigarette in Ritchie’s mouth. Alexei lights
dialog: it.
text: He lights one for himself as he walks back to the car.
text: Ritchie takes a huge drag. His bound hands come up and take
text: the cigarette from his lips. His wrists are badly bruised.
text: He brings them back down into the darkness and empties his
text: lungs into the mountain air.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: (RE: the hole)
dialog: They killed her for nothing.
speaker_heading: PETE
text: She shot his wife.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: It was an accident.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Is that what you think? I think
dialog: she wasn’t ready for that much
dialog: blood. I think she got scared.
dialog: Didn’t wanna go through it
dialog: alone... looked for a friend.
text: Ritchie is locked on the hole.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: It’s in my car.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Your car?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
text: In the trunk.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Are you lying to me?
text: Ritchie takes another massive drag.
text: Pete studies his face.
text: He takes off toward the cabin.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (to the goons)
dialog: Put him back.
text: Iosif grabs Ritchie and pushes him back into the shed.
scene_heading: INT. SHED - NIGHT
text: The door shuts behind him and the lock snaps shut.
text: Ritchie presses his face to the cracks.
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE”S POV
text: Pete motions to Iosif to get into his car. He mumbles
text: something to Alexei who heads back inside.
text: Pete gets into his car and drives off with Iosif.
text: BACK IN THE SHED
text: Ritchie quickly turns around and produces the cigarette. He
text: holds it near his ropes and tries to get a burn going. He
text: takes a few drags to keep the tip lit and goes to work on
dialog: the fibers.
scene_heading: INT. CABIN/KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Heather is down to her bra and panties.
text: Alexei approaches and whispers into Dimitri’s ear. Trent
text: looks on with a nervous gaze.
text: Dimitri stands up and takes Heather’s hand.
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: Come. We go now.
text: Trent moves in as Dimitri helps Heather off the table.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Go where, exactly?
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: To bedroom... for the sex.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: The sex? Dimitri, that’s my
dialog: girl. You can’t just --
text: Alexei blocks his way.
text: Dimitri and Heather disappear into the bedroom. The door
text: closes behind them.
text: Trent slumps back into his chair.
dialog: 81.
scene_heading: INT. SHED - NIGHT
text: The cigarette’s down to a roach. Sweat pours down Ritchie’s
dialog: face.
text: A few fibers begin to give. Slowly, one strand pops apart
dialog: and that’s all it takes. Ritchie uses all his strength and
text: tears himself free.
text: He rubs his wrists and goes for the bicycle.
scene_heading: INT. CABIN/KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: MOANING comes from the bedroom. Trent exchanges looks with
dialog: Alexei.
text: Alexei reaches over and turns up the RUSSIAN RAP.
scene_heading: EXT. SHED - NIGHT
text: The door is kicked into a cloud of splinters. Ritchie walks
text: out with the bicycle’s chain wrapped tight around his fist.
scene_heading: INT. CABIN/KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: There’s a KNOCK at the door. Alexei gives Trent a pat on
text: the back as he goes to it. He opens the door and...
text: RITCHIE’S CHAINED FIST LANDS ON ALEXEI’S CHEEK LIKE A
text: WRECKING BALL. His face is split open. He’s sent flying
text: across the tiny kitchen. He crashes onto the table and
text: doesn’t get up.
text: Trent is already on his feet as Ritchie enters - bloodied
text: and panting like a wild animal.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Ritchie! Thank God! We gotta get
dialog: out of here!
text: Ritchie drives his metal-clad fist deep into Trent’s skull.
text: He’s sent crashing through the bedroom door revealing
text: Heather on the bed masturbating, and Dimitri sitting ina
text: nearby chair with his pants around his ankles.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: BEDROOM
text: Ritchie stomps in.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: (to Dimitri)
dialog: Don’t get up.
text: With one swing, Dimitri is sent to the floor; blood
text: spatters all over Heather.
text: Ritchie picks him up and puts him back into his chair.
text: Heather is hysterical.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: (to Heather)
dialog: Out.
text: Heather gets the hell out of there.
text: She hops over Trent. He crawl away after her.
text: Ritchie undoes the chain from his bloody fist.
text: Dimitri’s face is torn open. He barely clings to
dialog: consciousness.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: It’s not your money anymore.
dialog: Call your bosses. Straighten it
dialog: out. We don’t see each other
dialog: again, yes?
text: Dimitri turns his bloody head to look at him.
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: You are dead man. Your family...
dialog: your friends... it is not
dialog: cliché, it is promise.
text: Ritchie looks tired and disappointed. He hurries to the
dialog: kitchen.
speaker_heading: KITCHEN
text: Ritchie goes to Alexei. He pulls out the gun from inside
text: his jacket. He makes sure it’s loaded.
dialog: 83.
text: Trent is half way across the kitchen now.
text: Ritchie puts one round into the radio and shuts it up.
speaker_heading: BEDROOM
text: Ritchie jams the gun into Dimitri’s gaping cheek. Dimitri
text: SHRIEKS .
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: We’re done, yes?
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: Fuck... you.
text: Ritchie looks him in the eyes. Blood pours from his face
text: and all over the gun. Ritchie hesitates, but finally PULLS
scene_heading: THE TRIGGER.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN
text: Trent is inches from the exit.
text: Ritchie stops to put a bullet in Alexei’s head. He walks
text: across the torn up kitchen and gets to Trent.
text: Trent’s face is barely holding together as he scratches at
text: the doorstep.
text: Ritchie pushes his head to the floor with the tip of his
text: gun. One shot paints the welcome mat red.
scene_heading: EXT. CABIN/BACKYARD - NIGHT
text: Ritchie approaches the hole. He goes to Iosif’s car and
text: turns the headlights on.
text: He looks down at the hole but sees only darkness.
text: He drops to his knees and reaches down into it. He grabs at
text: anything for a while before finally finding something.
text: He steadies himself, and with one hard pull, he drags Nikki
text: out of the hole.
text: He wipes the hair and dirt from her face; she’s still
text: beautiful, even in death.
dialog: 84.
scene_heading: INT. IOSIF’S CAR
text: Ritchie carefully props Nikki up in the back seat. He gets
text: in the front.
text: He looks at her through the rearview mirror. She almost
text: looks like she’s sleeping.
text: Ritchie turns the key and the engine roars to life.
scene_heading: INT. CABIN/KITCHEN
text: THE CAR CRASHES THROUGH THE DOOR and stalls in the middle
text: of the kitchen.
text: Ritchie stumbles out and goes to Alexei. He looks through
text: his pockets and comes up with his lighter.
text: He grabs Heather’s discarded dress and heads to the back of
dialog: the car.
text: He unscrews the gas tank and shoves the dress deep into the
dialog: hole.
text: He takes one last look at Nikki.
text: He flicks the lighter and lights it up.
scene_heading: INT. TRENT’S MERCEDES
text: Ritchie drops into the driver’s seat and starts up the
text: engine. The car takes off like a rocket.
scene_heading: EXT. CABIN
text: The whole place goes up in A HUGE FIREBALL.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT
text: The Mercedes cuts through the dark countryside. The tires
text: scream with every curve.
dialog: 85.
scene_heading: INT. TRENT’S MERCEDES - NIGHT - TRAVELING
text: Ritchie looks up ahead and sees Heather in his headlights.
text: Her bare skin glows as he approaches. She stumbles out of
text: the way and disappears in his rearview.
scene_heading: INT. PETE’S CAR - NIGHT - TRAVELING
text: Pete and Iosif cruise in silence.
text: Suddenly, light shines through Pete’s mirror and into his
text: eyes. He squints at the approaching headlights.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Look at this prick.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT
text: RITCHIE PLOWS TRENT’S MERCEDES INTO PETE’S CAR. It swerves
text: off the road and straight into a tree.
text: The Mercedes grinds to a stop.
text: Ritchie gets out. He holds his gun tight as he approaches
text: the wreck. Smoke and fluids spew out of the demolished car.
text: There’s broken glass and pieces of engine everywhere.
text: Iosif lays face down a few feet from the mess. Ritchie
text: quickly fires a shot into him as he passes.
text: He slowly approaches the driver’s side. Pete’s face is
text: glued to the steering wheel.
text: He pulls him back against the seat and searches through his
dialog: pockets...
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (groggy)
dialog: Ritchie?
text: Ritchie ignores him and keeps searching. Pete’s face is
text: covered in blood. Ritchie finds his gun and shoves it into
text: the back of his pants. He continues searching Pete’s
dialog: pockets.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Ritchie?
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: (searching)
dialog: You got blood in your eyes,
dialog: asshole.
text: Ritchie comes up with nothing.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You gotta get me out of here,
dialog: Ritchie... I don’t feel right.
text: Ritchie watches him struggle.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: I’1l help you, Pete... but you
dialog: have to do something for me
dialog: first. You know the drill.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Anything you want... name it.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: When you see the Devil...
text: Ritchie points the gun at Pete’s forehead. Pete can’t see
text: it through the blood.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: ...tell him we're even.
text: BANG! He tosses the gun and walks off.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT
text: The road is hard on Heather’s bare feet. She staggers down
text: the dark road with nothing but her earrings on.
text: A light comes up from the horizon. A car quickly
text: approaches. She tries desperately to flag it down, but the
text: beat-up Mercedes speeds by her again.
text: Her arms drop to her sides. The car disappears.
scene_heading: EXT. TRENT’S MERCEDES - NIGHT - TRAVELING
text: The bumper dangles from a thread. Only one headlight
text: illuminates the road.
dialog: 87.
scene_heading: EXT. CABIN - NIGHT
text: The flames continue to engulf the building.
text: Ritchie pulls up. He gets out and hurries towards the
dialog: blaze.
text: He searches the ground where the car was parked. The flames
text: pick up something shiny a few feet away - his phone.
text: He picks it up and heads back to the mangled Mercedes.
text: He takes one last look at the raging fire.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT
text: Heather shuffles across the middle of the road like a naked
dialog: zombie.
text: A lonely headlight appears in the distance and gets closer.
text: She doesn’t even bother to look this time.
text: The Mercedes comes to a stop behind her. She turns and sees
text: Ritchie at the wheel.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
text: The Mercedes struggles past empty streets.
scene_heading: EXT. “PINK MONKEY STUDIOS” /PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Ritchie barely manages to park it before the engine dies. A
text: sign hangs over the spot that reads: “TRENT ROTHSTEIN -
speaker_heading: PRODUCER” .
scene_heading: INT. TRENT’S MERCEDES
text: Ritchie pulls the keys from the ignition and hands them to
text: Heather. She has his suit jacket draped over her shoulders.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: One of those should get you into
dialog: the office. You can get some
dialog: clothes, get cleaned up.
text: Ritchie leaves her in the jalopy.
dialog: 88.
scene_heading: EXT. “PINK MONKEY STUDIOS” /STREET - NIGHT
text: Ritchie’s car is right where he left it.
text: He pops open the trunk and takes out the duffel bag. He
text: opens it up and pulls out Nikki’s gun. He pulls his from
text: his pants and shoves it in the bag.
scene_heading: INT. RITCHIE’S CAR
text: He tosses in the bag and gets behind the wheel. His phone

speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Are you alright?
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Peachee.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL/NURSERY - NIGHT
text: Ritchie scrubs his hands vigorously. Blood and dirt circle
text: the drain. He washes his face and neck and gets as much of
text: the night off of him as he can.
text: He grabs some clean scrubs. He puts them on and turns to
text: find two NIGHTSHIFT NURSES staring at him. He picks up his
text: bag and walks past rows of incubators and finally gets to
dialog: his boy.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: (whispering)

text: The little guy opens his eyes and looks up at him.

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL/OFFICE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: GRISWALT
dialog: You going on a trip?
text: Ritchie looks over at Officer Lee by the door.
speaker_heading: GRISWALT
dialog: Do you know where Detective

text: He pulls out Nikki’s phone and sets it down on the desk.
text: Ritchie focuses on it.
speaker_heading: GRISWALT
dialog: He said you might show up here
dialog: if things went south at the
dialog: cabin. Told me to hold you down
dialog: until he showed up. But he’s not
text: answering his phone.
text: He has Ritchie’s attention now.
speaker_heading: GRISWALT
dialog: Detective Sommersed was involved
dialog: in a multitude of illegal

speaker_heading: GRISWALT

text: Griswalt joins Lee at the door.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: What about the Russians?
speaker_heading: GRISWALT
dialog: Last I heard the place is still
dialog: burning. They’re not gonna find
text: anything out there but ashes.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: You’re just gonna let me walk?
text: Griswalt casually approaches with a smile.
speaker_heading: GRISWALT
dialog: Time can bury a lot of things,
dialog: Ritchie. But some things... you
dialog: gotta bury yourself.
text: They exit.
text: Ritchie looks down at Nikki’s phone. The screen flashes
text: “battery low”. He drops it in the trash. He grabs his bag
text: and heads down the hall.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL/HALLWAY
text: For the first time, a smile appears on Ritchie’s face. His
text: strides get more confident as he heads back to the nursery.
text: Suddenly, A LOUD VOICE BLARES OVER THE PA SYSTEM.
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (over PA, filtered)
dialog: Code Pink! Code Pink!
text: Ritchie’s smile is history.
text: Nurses and orderlies rush past him down the hall. They
text: burst through the nursery’s entrance.
text: A BEAUTIFUL ANGELIC VOICE pierces through the chaos and
text: drowns out all the sound - A CHOIR SINGER belts out a
text: haunting hymn as Ritchie approaches the nursery’s open
dialog: doorway.
text: The medical staff struggles to resuscitate his boy.
text: THE VOICE HITS ITS HIGHEST NOTE as the heart monitor flat-
dialog: lines.

scene_heading: INT. DOWNTOWN CHURCH - DAY
text: A cavernous altar, lit up only by candles.
text: A CHOIR is in the middle of a practice.
text: The angelic voice continues to engulf all the world’s
text: sound. It belongs to A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL at the front of
dialog: the group.
text: A few parishioners are spread out in the pews.
text: Ritchie sits way in the back row. His trademark frown
text: planted firmly back on his face; his hand on the duffel bag
text: beside him.
text: He’s motionless, lost in thought, watching, but not
dialog: focused.
text: A priest emerges from a confessional and greets one of the
dialog: parishioners.
text: The girl’s voice fights to get into Ritchie’s heart, but
text: suddenly gives up. Silence. Ritchie snaps out of his
dialog: trance.
text: He looks down at the bag and slowly takes away his hand.
dialog: 93.
text: He gets up.
text: The priest spots him.
text: Ritchie walks out. The duffel stays behind. The priest
text: approaches.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN CHURCH/STEPS
text: Ritchie stands in the cool morning air. He lights a
text: cigarette and takes the smoke deep into his lungs.
text: POLICE SIRENS in the distance. CAR HORNS and the YELLS of
text: drivers in the throws of road-rage mix with jumbled MUSIC
text: and a ton of INDISCERNIBLE CITY NOISE.
text: Ritchie takes it all in. The chaos speaks to him.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Shit.
text: He flicks his cigarette away.
scene_heading: INT. DOWNTOWN CHURCH
text: The priest has the duffel open. His eyes wide at the sight
text: of the cash inside.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: Praise the lord.
text: A hand reaches in and quickly cuts his moment short.
text: The priest jumps back as Ritchie takes the bag. He even
text: fights to let go for a second; joy replaced with shock.
speaker_heading: RITCHIE
dialog: Sorry, father. Forgot my bag.
text: Ritchie exits and leaves the priest standing there,
text: speechless.
dialog: 94.
scene_heading: EXT. RITCHIE’S CAR
text: Ritchie tosses the bag into his car before dropping into
text: the driver’s seat. He starts it up fast and peels out even
dialog: faster.
text: He disappears into the chaos.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: THE END
