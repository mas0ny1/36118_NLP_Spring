text: she sees nothing, and then sees the snout of a small animal
text: poking out from behind a cabinet. It stops moving at the
text: sound of Carol’s footsteps. Carol stares in shock, unable to
text: speak. The animal then comes out from the cabinet and

speaker_heading: CAROL

speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You seemed...
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: What? Are you saying you thought I
dialog: was dead?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: No, not that. Sorry.
text: Lloyd begins unloading his gear by the pool, trying to avoid
dialog: the conversation.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Because I’m an old person and I had
dialog: my eyes closed.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I was just making sure you were
dialog: okay.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: No, I’m not okay. I’m terrible.

dialog: Who are you? It was always another

text: Lloyd has already moved to the edge of the pool and begun

speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Richie, uh, moved on. He had a

speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Okay, clean away, new guy.
text: She begins to open the door to go back inside, then hesitates
text: and shuts it. Lloyd puts his headphones on and begins

speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (distracted)

speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Do you see anything?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I... do not.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Keep looking. Check behind the
dialog: curtains.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Sorry, I didn’t see it. Maybe it’s
dialog: gone.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Oh god. He’s probably going to
dialog: reappear the second you leave.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Maybe you should call, like, an
dialog: exterminator?
text: Carol gives him a look and cautiously enters the house.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I can’t imagine where it came from.
dialog: I haven’t even seen a mouse in
dialog: years. I think my dog must've kept
dialog: them away. But a rat... it was
text: black. Like a bad omen.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: So where’s the dog?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (blankly)
dialog: I had to put him down today.
speaker_heading: LLOYD

text: just giving him a little tug.
text: Carol and Rona laugh. Georgina is shocked.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: GEORGINA
dialog: The language, Sally!
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: What language?
speaker_heading: GEORGINA
dialog: (shivering)
dialog: “Tug.”
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: How is that language? I said “tug.”
dialog: I didn’t say she was “jerking him
dialog: off.” Jeez...
speaker_heading: GEORGINA
dialog: I don’t like that kinda talk.
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: You're so sensitive, Georgie.
speaker_heading: GEORGINA
dialog: I'd just rather not hear about
text: Jerry Davis’ habits in the pool.
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: That pool. It’s disgusting. Too
text: many people are in that pool.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I love that pool.
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: God knows what’s in that pool.
speaker_heading: CAROL
text: It doesn't seem particularly clean.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Like your pool’s a day spa.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I have it cleaned once a week.
speaker_heading: GEORGINA
dialog: Carol, when are you gonna move in
dialog: here? A lady just passed on two
dialog: cottages over. God rest her soul.
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: That reminds me - they have new
dialog: brochures. I want you to see the
dialog: new brochures, Carol.
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I don’t want to see the new
dialog: brochures. I already saw the old
dialog: brochures.
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: I‘1l bring some by this week.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Yeah, Carol. You’re missing out on
dialog: all the action.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I’m very happy with my house, thank
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: But that pool, Carol.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: What about my pool?
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: You're all alone there! You could
dialog: slip and fall and no one would be
dialog: around to help you. You could drown
dialog: in that pool.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Well, at least it’d be clean.
text: The girls laugh. Some card playing.
speaker_heading: GEORGINA
dialog: Carol, how's Hazel been feeling
dialog: lately?
text: Carol looks at her.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Hazel... He, uh...
text: (looks at Rona, then looks
dialog: down at her cards)
dialog: I had to put Hazel down.
text: All at once GEORGINA and SALLY put their cards down and utter
dialog: hushed apologies, “Oh, Carol,” “For Christ’s sake, why didn’t
dialog: you tell us,” etc.
speaker_heading: GEORGINA
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: A couple days ago.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: That’s terrible, Carol.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (to Rona)
dialog: Don’t act so surprised.
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Don’t play dumb, Rona. Kath told me
dialog: you told her. How'd you find out
dialog: anyway?
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: Mike told me.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: The guy with the dog? Your
dialog: neighbor?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (to Rona)
dialog: Well, aren’t you just cozy with
dialog: everyone?
text: Rona is hurt by this. Sally sees it and jumps in.
speaker_heading: SALLY
text: She's just upset, Rona.
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: Of course she is. We all loved
dialog: Hazel, Carol.
speaker_heading: GEORGINA
dialog: (to Carol)
dialog: How are you holding up?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I'm fine. I’m sorry, Ro.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: To hell with the card game. We
dialog: should get good and drunk tonight.
dialog: (standing)
dialog: I’m getting another. And I got some
dialog: of that medical marijuana...
speaker_heading: GEORGINA
dialog: (to Carol)
dialog: What are you going to do?
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: GEORGINA
dialog: I don’t know... are you getting
dialog: another dog?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: She's in mourning, Georgina. You
dialog: can’t just get a new dog right
dialog: after. It’s not like her car died.
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: I couldn't get another dog after my
dialog: last one passed. It’s just too hard
dialog: to replace them.
speaker_heading: GEORGINA
dialog: I just know you loved that boy so
dialog: much.
text: Carol doesn’t respond. The ladies look at each other.
speaker_heading: GEORGINA (CONT’D)
dialog: We should do something. We should
dialog: have a memorial or something. I can
dialog: talk to my pastor.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Or maybe we can treat you to a nice
text: dinner out someplace.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Look... there’s nothing left to do.
dialog: He had a good life. Even the cancer
dialog: didn’t bother him. So I don’t let
dialog: it bother me either. I’m fine.
dialog: Really. I’m gonna play some golf,
dialog: do our bridge game on Wednesdays,
dialog: try to live a bit longer, and God
dialog: willing I don’t get the big A...
dialog: (shrugs )
dialog: ...and maybe someday I’1l get
text: another dog.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Just a dog?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Don’t start with that.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: What?
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: CAROL
text: The dating talk. The second husband
dialog: talk. You couldn’t pay me.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: But they do pay you. When they
dialog: die.
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: Not always.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: And who's saying husband?
speaker_heading: GEORGINA
dialog: Maybe you could date somebody.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Maybe I could stick a fork in my
dialog: eye.
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: (to Georgina)
dialog: Like you've dated since Gary
dialog: passed.
speaker_heading: GEORGINA
dialog: Once you’ve had the best, who cares
dialog: about the rest.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Yeah, Rona. Not once you’ve had the
dialog: best you go out and get another one
text: and then another one and another
dialog: one...
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: I’ve only been married three times!
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Yeah, only three.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I’m with Georgina. I’m not
dialog: interested and that’s that.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Jeez, Carol, come on. Don’t you
dialog: ever think about it? Just somebody
dialog: to go out with once in a while...
dialog: What about Mike?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: What about him?
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: He’s cute. Seems like a nice guy.
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: I don’t know. Isn’t Mike a
dialog: little...old?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I’m not... I’m not interested in
dialog: anyone right now...
speaker_heading: GEORGINA
dialog: You're in that big house. All
dialog: alone. We worry about you.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I’m fine.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Guys ask about you all the time,
dialog: Carol. You’re a beautiful woman! I
dialog: can hook you up. I know everyone
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Like it’s that simple. If it were
dialog: that simple...
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: What? You mean you gotta put out?
speaker_heading: GEORGINA
dialog: (shivering again)
text: Like with Jerry in the pool.
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: That’s not what she means.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I just mean I don’t like my life
text: all complicated. Hazel’s gone, but
dialog: I like my life the way it is. It’s
dialog: easy. I know where everything is.
text: Carol looks at everyone. Everyone is looking at her.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: Never mind. Are we playing cards,
dialog: girls? Let’s play some cards.
scene_heading: 54 INT. CAROL'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING 54

scene_heading: EXT. RETIREMENT COMMUNITY GOLF COURSE - DAY 55
text: CLOSE ON: a ball on a tee. A club hits the ball.
text: Carol watches her shot as it drives down the fairway. She
text: clearly knows what she’s doing with a golf club.
text: Sally is watching as well.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: What a shot, Carol! Wow.
scene_heading: EXT. RETIREMENT COMMUNITY GOLF COURSE - DAY 56
text: Sally puts and misses. Carol stands on the green nearby.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: (after missing shot)
dialog: Let’s just have the maximum shot
dialog: count be ten, for Christ’s sake.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: The shot count is however many
dialog: strokes it took you to get the ball
text: in the hole.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: (walking to her ball)
dialog: Golf talk is so sexual-sounding
dialog: isn’t it? Balls, holes, strokes...
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Just count up your shots, Sally.
dialog: And be honest.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: What is this, the PGA?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Yeah, the senior-senior tour.
text: Sally laughs and puts again. She sinks the put.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: That means I scored a thirteen on
dialog: this one...
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Oh fine. Max score can be ten.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: That’s my girl.

speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: You want a drink?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: It’s early. And I'm driving.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I didn’t hear a no.
text: A WAITRESS approaches.
speaker_heading: SALLY (CONT'D)
text: A Bud and a glass of chardonnay for

dialog: drinks
text: As Sally orders, Carol looks out the window to see the CIGAR
text: MAN from the vitamin store talking to a few gentlemen at a
text: table on the patio. He still has an unlit cigar in his mouth
text: and seems to be in charge of the conversation.
text: After the Waitress leaves Sally turns around and spots what
text: Carol is looking at.
speaker_heading: SALLY (CONT'D)
text: He’s handsome.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: That guy.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Which one?
text: The Cigar Man laughs and has a sip of his whiskey.
text: looks at Carol as if to say, “You know which one.”
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: I've seen him before. He talked to
dialog: me at the store the other day.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Really? He talked to you.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Yeah...
dialog: Sally
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: What did he say?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Something about I’m just fine the
dialog: way I am...
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Are you kidding me?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I don’t remember.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Oh my god. He’s sexy, Carol. He
dialog: must be new. I can find out.
text: Sally stands to head over and Carol stops her, making her sit
text: back down.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Don’t go over there.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Look at you, like a nervous
dialog: schoolgirl. What are you afraid of?
text: Carol just makes a disapproving face.
speaker_heading: SALLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Why don’t you come with me tomorrow
dialog: night to this speed dating thing -
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I’m not doing that.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: C’mon, Carol. They do it right
dialog: inside the clubhouse. It’1l be good
dialog: for you. It’s fun.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I’ll bet.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: You meet some fellas, you talk a
dialog: little. It’s not even dating.
dialog: It’s just socializing. It’s no big
dialog: deal.
dialog: (pointing to the Cigar
dialog: Man)
dialog: Maybe he’1l be there.

scene_heading: EXT. CAROL’S HOUSE - POOL - DAY 58
text: Carol has a glass of wine by her pool. It’s clear that she’s
text: had a few since her date with Sally. She notices something at

dialog: face.
scene_heading: INT. CAROL'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 59
text: Carol is on the phone.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Okay.... Thank you.
scene_heading: EXT. CAROL’S HOUSE - POOL - DAY 60
text: The cleaning device is back in the pool, roving around.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Like new.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Thank you. What was the problem?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Um... They tend not to work so well
text: when they come unplugged.
text: Carol shakes her head, knowing how silly the problem was.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Ah...
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You mind if I use your bathroom?
scene_heading: INT. CAROL'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 61
text: Lloyd comes out of the bathroom and sees Carol's pictures. He
text: focuses on the one of her in a folk band. He looks more
text: closely to see a YOUNG CAROL with a HANDSOME MAN in a black
text: and white photo from the sixties. They have instruments in
dialog: their hands.
speaker_heading: CAROL (0.S.)
dialog: Long time ago.
dialog: 29.
text: Lloyd looks up to see Carol staring at the photo with him.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Oh, sorry.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: It’s fine.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You were a musician?
text: Carol nods her head.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I was in a folk duo. That was in
dialog: New York, a million years ago. We
dialog: used to play in the Village. I
dialog: sang.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: That your husband?
text: CLOSE ON: The photo and the handsome man with his arm around
text: Young Carol. Their pose and look of contentment suggest that
dialog: they are together.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: No. That’s John.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: My husband came later. Bill.
dialog: Carol indicates another photo, the one we saw earlier of
text: Carol and an older man, their arms around each other,
text: smiling.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I used to be in a band...
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Oh?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I sang, too. If you can call it
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Where were you in a band?
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Austin. I just moved back here,
dialog: SO...
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: What brought you back?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I grew up in the Valley. Austin
dialog: didn’t work out.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (knowingly)
dialog: I’m sure you're better off without
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Right now it feels like it’s the
dialog: other way around.
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: You're pretty smart for an old
dialog: lady.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You have family here?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Yeah. I’m staying with my mom.
text: Carol looks at him as if reassessing him while trying not to
text: appear to be doing so. He’s a little old to be living back at
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT’D)
text: Temporarily.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Friends?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Not really. Not anymore, no.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You want a drink? I was about to
dialog: open a bottle of wine. Well,
text: another bottle.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I’m still on the clock.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Oh come on. My dog just died.
dialog: Pretend to have a drink with me.

scene_heading: INT. CAROL’S HOUSE - DINING AREA - DAY 62
text: Carol pops open a bottle and begins pouring Lloyd a glass.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You want just a little or you want
dialog: the full treatment?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Fill ‘er up.
text: She does the same for herself and lifts her glass.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Cheers, Lloyd.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Cheers.
text: They touch glasses and have a sip. Lloyd shakes his head,
text: enjoying the wine.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: This is really good.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I think so, too. So what kind of
dialog: music do you sing?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: The closest I get to singing
dialog: anymore is karaoke night at the
dialog: bar.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Huh.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: But lately I’ve been writing some
dialog: songs.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: So you’re a songwriter?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: No... but I studied poetry in
dialog: college. This is sort of the same
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You mean you went to school to
dialog: write poetry?
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Yeah. B.F.A.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Bet your parents loved you for
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Yeah. Hence the pool guy getup.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: No one’s hiring poets, huh?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Not currently. Not for like the
dialog: past ten years.
text: Lloyd smiles. There’s an awkward silence.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: But someday I’1l have a lot of good
dialog: poems about... pools.
text: Carol laughs.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I bet you will.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: But it seems like - I mean, you
dialog: were in a real group.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: For a bit, yeah. That gentleman in
text: the picture played guitar.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: The one who’s not your husband.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Right. John.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: John was pretty handsome.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: He certainly had a way about him...
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You divorced, or?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: My husband? He died.
dialog: 63
dialog: 33.
text: They each have another sip of wine.
scene_heading: EXT. CAROL’S HOUSE - POOL - EVENING 63
text: Time has passed and another bottle has been opened. Carol and
text: Lloyd are both a bit tipsy. They share a big laugh.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Well, I guess they set it up so you
dialog: meet a new person every few minutes
dialog: or something. It sounds awful.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Well, it’s an experience, right?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: It might be fun. Why not?
text: Carol thinks it over and has another sip of wine.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (to herself, tipsy)
dialog: Yeah, why not...
text: Lloyd smiles at Carol.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (checking his phone)
dialog: I gotta run. Got to meet my mom for
dialog: dinner.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Oh sure. Sorry I kept you.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Are you kidding? I had a great
dialog: time. You’re a good drinking buddy.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You're sweet to say that.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (going to gather his gear)
dialog: I’m not just saying it.
text: Carol smiles while Lloyd goes to gather his gear. As he’s
text: getting it together he looks back at Carol.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, what happened to that rat?
dialog: 64
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: It... left. I think. The guy says
dialog: it was an “isolated incident.”
dialog: Whatever that means.
text: Lloyd nods. There is some silence between them.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You know, do you wanna... hang out
dialog: some time?
text: Carol looks at Lloyd.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: Not like that. I mean...
text: Lloyd gestures helplessly.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: Like this. But not here. I mean
dialog: we should go out.
text: Carol raises her eyebrows.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: Not... not... go out. I just mean,
dialog: if you're interested, maybe we
dialog: could go do karaoke or something?
dialog: I’d love to see you get up there
dialog: and knock ‘em dead.
text: Carol laughs.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: We'll see.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Okay. Cool.
text: Lloyd heads out. Carol sits for a beat and then finishes her
text: wine by the pool.
scene_heading: INT. RETIREMENT COMMUNITY - LOBBY - DAY 64
text: CLOSE ON: A paper flyer that says “Speed Dating - This Way”
text: with an arrow. Carol and Sally enter the common room.
text: Several women are sitting on one side of a long table with
text: pitchers of iced tea and drink glasses filled. A few other
text: women are standing up and talking. The other side of the
text: table is empty.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: There are no men here.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: They’1l be here. Trust me.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I can’t believe I agreed to this.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Hey, you called me.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I was drunk. My decision-making
dialog: skills were at an extreme low.
text: The woman who runs the speed dating is LESLIE HANSEN (60s).
text: Leslie taps a spoon on a glass.
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: Welcome everyone. Welcome. Let’s
dialog: settle in.
text: The few women still standing find their seats. Carol and
text: Sally end up seated remotely from each other. As Leslie
text: talks we see the women watching her and listening, but Carol
text: is watching the other women, looking around nervously. Carol
text: seems to already regret her decision.
speaker_heading: LESLIE (CONT'D)
text: I see some familiar faces, some new
dialog: faces... this is going to be really
dialog: fun.
dialog: (points)
text: The “boys” are waiting in the next
dialog: room, and in a just a minute we'll
dialog: open the door and they’re going to
dialog: come in... and we'll begin.
text: Carol leans back and looks to Sally, who is down the table.
text: Sally leans back to look at her.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (to Sally)
dialog: They’re gonna unleash them on us
dialog: like the bulls in Pamplona?
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: Each “date” is five minutes long,
text: and then we shift down the table to
text: the next date. When I tap the spoon
dialog: (taps spoon on glass)
dialog: - that’s your thirty-second warning
dialog: that it’s time for the men to shift
text: to the next chair.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: LESLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s when you want to start
dialog: thinking about exchanging
dialog: information, if that’s something
dialog: you want to do. Okay? Are we ready?
text: No one answers. The women just look around.
speaker_heading: LESLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh come on! We can’t do better than
dialog: that? Are you ready?
text: A few audible “Yeah’s” and “Yes’s” are heard. A woman picks
text: up her iced tea and sips it.
speaker_heading: LESLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s more like it!
text: The door is opened and a dozen older men come streaming out
text: into the room and sit down at the table across from the
text: ladies. The Cigar Man is not among them. Carol gives Sally a
dialog: look that says “shoot me now.”
speaker_heading: LESLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (taps spoon on glass)
dialog: Let the dating begin!
text: The table instantly becomes a sea of chatter as the men begin
text: talking to the ladies.
text: OLD GUY 1, a bald man with a rim of white hair and a sweet
text: face, is seated across from Carol. His name tag says “Carl.”
speaker_heading: OLD GUY 1
dialog: Hello. Carol, huh? That’s funny.
text: Carol looks puzzled.
speaker_heading: OLD GUY 1 (CONT'D)
dialog: Carol, Carl.
text: Carol notices his name tag.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Ah.
speaker_heading: OLD GUY 1
dialog: Your first time here?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: OLD GUY 1
dialog: Same. I’ve had some girlfriends,
dialog: but I’m looking for someone, you
dialog: know, special. To go to the
dialog: movies, have a nice dinner out?
dialog: That’s a dime a dozen. But someone
dialog: who's there for you all the time,
dialog: to go on walks every day, you know,
text: a companion.
text: Carol nods. Awkward silence.
speaker_heading: OLD GUY 1 (CONT’D)
dialog: So what kind of interests do you
dialog: have?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (leaning forward)
dialog: Interests?
speaker_heading: OLD GUY 1
dialog: Yeah. Like...
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Like what do I like to do?
speaker_heading: OLD GUY 1
dialog: Yeah.
text: Carol has to think about this for a moment.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You mean by myself, or with other
dialog: people?
speaker_heading: OLD GUY 1
dialog: Either one.
text: Carol looks bewildered. She pours herself some iced tea.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: How about you tell me about your
dialog: interests.
text: Old Guy 1 looks confused. Carol grabs her glass of iced tea.
speaker_heading: OLD GUY 1
dialog: I guess my interest right now is
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I think I’m...
dialog: 65
dialog: 38.
text: Leslie taps her spoon on glass. Carol flinches, looking
text: towards her.
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: Thirty seconds! Prepare to shift!
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Jesus Christ.
text: Old Guy 1 looks expectantly at Carol and Carol ignores him
text: until the woman taps the spoon on her glass again. Old Guy 1
text: smiles and nods goodbye and stands, as do the rest of the
text: men, and shifts to the next chair.
text: OLD GUY 2 sits down.
speaker_heading: OLD GUY 2
dialog: I’m gonna cut to the chase here.
dialog: Is that okay?
text: Carol looks at him, suddenly interested. This guy is
dialog: intriguing.
speaker_heading: OLD GUY 2 (CONT’D)
dialog: Sex is still very important to me.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: OLD GUY 2
dialog: And if we were to go out I'd like
dialog: to get right to it, if you know
dialog: what I mean. We don’t have much
dialog: time left - no offense.

text: Carol as they speed date.
speaker_heading: BEGIN MONTAGE:
speaker_heading: OLD GUY 3
dialog: I just moved here from Florida.
dialog: It’s so cold here. The nights! So
dialog: frigid. No one told me you have to
dialog: carry a sweater around with you at
dialog: all times in California. Nothing
dialog: like the postcard!
speaker_heading: OLD GUY 4
dialog: The most important thing is that
dialog: you're around all of the time.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 66
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: OLD GUY 4 (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m not looking to spend the rest
dialog: of my life away from a beautiful
dialog: woman like you. I want to be around
dialog: you. All of the time.
speaker_heading: OLD GUY 3
dialog: And it’s too cold indoors. This AC
dialog: is out of control, like what,
dialog: they're trying to refrigerate us?
dialog: I’m telling you, you have to carry
dialog: a sweater with you wherever you go.
speaker_heading: OLD GUY 5
text: Barry Manilow is coming to town and
dialog: who doesn’t love Barry Manilow.
speaker_heading: OLD GUY 2
dialog: The other stuff is important too,
dialog: but sex is the most important. At
dialog: our age - what do we have to lose?
dialog: What am I afraid of, herpes? So I
dialog: have herpes for a few years and
dialog: then what, I’m dead anyway. I mean,
dialog: I don’t have herpes, but I don’t
dialog: care if you do. Let’s have some
dialog: fun, huh?
speaker_heading: OLD GUY 4
dialog: If I’m with you, I want you around
dialog: me. The last woman I dated - she
dialog: was never around. She was always
dialog: going to some bridge club or a
dialog: movie, coffee with friends. I can’t
dialog: have that. Is that so much to ask?
text: Leslie taps her spoon on a glass.

speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: That wasn’t so bad, right?
text: Carol stops walking.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Not so bad? I live a long healthy
dialog: life for this? What the hell was I
dialog: doing in there?
dialog: 67
dialog: 40.
text: Some other speed daters are leaving the building and cast
text: looks at them.
speaker_heading: SALLY

speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Did you talk to the herpes guy?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: One of them had herpes?
speaker_heading: CAROL

text: Carol puts the groceries in the trunk of her car. A car

speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You!
speaker_heading: CIGAR MAN
dialog: Me?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: CIGAR MAN

dialog: What’s your name?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CIGAR MAN
dialog: Your name is Yes?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Yes, I'll have lunch with you.
speaker_heading: CIGAR MAN
dialog: Just like that?
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: How else would you like it to be?
text: The Cigar Man looks at her as if thinking the question over
text: seriously. A car behind him honks its horn.
speaker_heading: CIGAR MAN
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (shrugs )
dialog: Now.
speaker_heading: CIGAR MAN
dialog: Now?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I’m hungry.
speaker_heading: CIGAR MAN
dialog: Won’t your groceries spoil? Just
dialog: give me your number. I’11 call you
dialog: and ask you out properly.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You're on your way to a date right
dialog: now. Is that it?
text: The HORN honks again.
speaker_heading: CIGAR MAN
dialog: Just give me your number.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You don’t have a pen and paper.
speaker_heading: CIGAR MAN
dialog: Well, we seem to be in a real bind
dialog: here... I’1l remember your number.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Oh yeah? Your brain still that
dialog: sharp, huh?
speaker_heading: CIGAR MAN
dialog: Try me.
text: Carol looks around and then back at the Cigar Man. The car
text: behind Cigar Man HONKS again.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: 347-6558.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: CIGAR MAN
dialog: Got it. Is that your cell phone?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I don’t have a cell phone.
speaker_heading: CIGAR MAN
dialog: No? Okay, I’1ll call you... But who
dialog: am I calling?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Carol.
speaker_heading: CIGAR MAN
dialog: Carol. It’s Bill.
text: Bill drives off. She stands in the parking lot watching him

speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: LLOYD (0.S.)
dialog: Sorry, I’m thinking. I’m just
dialog: making sure I don’t have anything -
dialog: is this like a date?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: It’s whatever. Does it matter?
speaker_heading: LLOYD (0.S.)
dialog: I guess not.
speaker_heading: CAROL

dialog: 44,
text: There are mostly men in the bar, drinking alone. The Karaoke
text: hasn't started yet but a GUY is finishing setting up the
dialog: equipment.
text: Lloyd and Carol sit at the bar.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Have you been here before?
text: Lloyd shakes his head with a nervous smile.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: What can I get you?
text: Lloyd gestures at Carol as if to let her order first.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I'll have whatever you’re having.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Two Modelos.
text: Carol looks over to the guy getting the mic set up. The beers
text: arrive and Carol lifts the bottle.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Cheers.
text: Lloyd clinks bottles with her. Lloyd does not appear to be
text: at ease and Carol seems to pick up on this.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: This is good. I needed this.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Rough day at the office?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Not exactly that.
text: There is an awkward silence between them.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Guess we got here a little early.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Yeah. Shouldn’t this be happy hour?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Eh... Nowadays people don’t go out
dialog: until late.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: What time?
dialog: 74
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: 10, ll..
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Even on a weeknights?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Don’t people have jobs?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Not so much anymore...
text: Lloyd and Carol have a swig of beer.
scene_heading: INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT 74
text: A GUY sings a karaoke song. Lloyd and Carol are still at the
text: bar leafing through the notebook of karaoke songs. The
text: Bartender comes over with an APPLE MARTINI for Carol.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: There you go.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Thank you.
text: Carol has a sip.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, this is good.
dialog: (to Lloyd)
dialog: This is good.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (to bartender)
dialog: What did you make me?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: It’s uh... an apple-tini.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Apple-tini. I’m gonna write that
dialog: down.
text: Carol writes down “Apple-tini” on a coaster and puts it in
text: her purse. Carol goes back to the karaoke notebook. She nods

dialog: 75
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: I think I got one.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Yeah? Which one?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Not telling.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Yeah. I think I can do this one.
dialog: Now you.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I know which one.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Already?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I always do the same tune.
scene_heading: INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT 75
text: Lloyd is in the middle of his song. He’s singing “I Think
text: We’re Alone Now” by Tiffany. He sings passably well,
text: performing the song goofily as if he has done it many times
text: before. Carol watches with a smile.
text: Scattered applause when he’s finished. The place is filling
text: up. He goes back to Carol at the bar.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: That was good.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: Looks like that ten o’clock crowd
text: is starting to filter in.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Yeah. You ready? Did you put your
dialog: name down?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Yeah...
dialog: 76
dialog: 47.
scene_heading: INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT 76
text: Carol approaches the stage, picks up the microphone. She
text: looks tentative at first but lifts the microphone and begins
text: to sing. The song is “Cry Me A River” by Diana Krall.
text: Her voice wavers over the first few lines of the song, but by
text: the first chorus she is killing it, and much of the chatter
text: in the bar has quieted - people are locking into it. By the
text: last chorus, random people are whooping and clapping before
text: she’s even finished. When she’s finished, whistles and
text: cheers and generous clapping.
text: She returns to the bar. Lloyd is looking at her with new
dialog: appreciation.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Jesus, that gave me goosebumps.
dialog: That was great.
text: Bartender sets another APPLE MARTINI on the bar.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
text: On the house.
text: Carol picks up the drink and has a big sip. Her hand is
text: trembling.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Look at me. I’m shaking.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: You can sing, lady.
dialog: (to Lloyd)
dialog: This your mom?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I wish.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Can we go?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Already?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I gotta quit while I’m ahead here,
dialog: I think.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You are definitely ahead.
dialog: 77
dialog: 78
dialog: 48.
scene_heading: INT. LLOYD'S CAR (EXT. CAROL’S HOUSE) - NIGHT 77
text: Carol and Lloyd are parked in front of Carol’s place. “Let's
text: Be Still” by The Head and The Heart is playing quietly on
text: Lloyd’s car stereo.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Thank you for a lovely evening.
text: Carol sits for a moment, then starts to get out of the car.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: So how come you quit singing?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I don’t remember why. I woke up one
dialog: day and I wasn’t singing anymore.
dialog: Thanks again, Lloyd.
text: Lloyd nods.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: You want some coffee?
text: Lloyd makes a face, hesitant.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: No, really, I’m making coffee.
dialog: Don’t be an asshole.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Okay.
scene_heading: INT. CAROL'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 78
text: Lloyd and Carol drink coffee out of big, colorful, breakfasty-
text: looking mugs, Carol sitting on the couch and Lloyd in an easy
dialog: chair.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I don’t even listen to music
text: anymore. Just in the car, maybe.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I don’t know. I still have all my
dialog: old records right in there.
text: Carol nods in the direction of a media cabinet.
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: I can’t remember the last time I
dialog: put one on.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Let’s fucking put one on right now.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Be my guest.
text: Lloyd sets down his coffee and goes to the media cabinet and
text: opens the doors. The cabinet is filled with LP records. In
text: the middle is an old hi-fi with a turntable. Carol watches
text: him move his index finger along the spines of the records.
text: He pulls out a record and turns on the hi-fi.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: This is a beautiful turntable.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: It was Bill’s. He was very picky
dialog: about stereo equipment.
text: Lloyd drops the needle on a Billie Holiday record. “They
text: Can't Take That Away From Me” begins playing. Lloyd listens
text: to the song for a bit. Carol watches him thoughtfully.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: What kind of plans do you have,
dialog: Lloyd?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I’m not in a plan-making place.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: More like I’m just trying to sock
dialog: some money away for now.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You gotta be careful with that. It
dialog: might be all you end up doing.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Fine by me. I’ve been trying to
dialog: figure out how to do it all my
dialog: life. Hasn’t exactly worked out so
dialog: far. Is that what you did?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Something like that.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (heading back to where
dialog: Carol is)
dialog: So how’d you earn your money?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I was a teacher. What they used to
dialog: call a schoolteacher.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: What’d you teach?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I taught all the classes nobody
dialog: else wanted to teach. Like Health.
dialog: And Typing.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: And you saved up money and retired
dialog: on that?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: No. On Bill’s life insurance. I
dialog: retired early when he died.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: So he died young.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: It was an accident... a plane
dialog: crash. It was a big news story for
dialog: a long time after. A lot of people
text: died. He was on a business trip.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: When was that?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Twenty years ago this spring. You
dialog: can Google it. Was one of the big
dialog: ones.
text: Lloyd is quiet for a moment, listening closely to the song.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: See, now hearing that makes me want
dialog: to live in the moment. Screw the
dialog: job.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Can’t have it both ways, huh?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I guess.
dialog: 51.
text: Carol sips her coffee.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You don't get it because you're
dialog: young. You're looking forward to
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I sure don’t feel like I’m looking
dialog: forward to anything.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: A break-up can do that to you.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Well... that happened, but I guess
dialog: really I came back because of my
dialog: mother. She’s got some health
dialog: issues... nothing serious, but I’m
dialog: here taking care of her. I’m not
dialog: even sure she likes having me
dialog: around. My dad died a few years
dialog: ago and I’m just... trying to be
dialog: responsible. Trying to do the right
dialog: thing. My other siblings are...
dialog: busy, I guess. With kids and real
dialog: jobs and hectic schedules and
dialog: travel plans.
text: Carol looks at Lloyd for a beat. Then:
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You are doing the right thing,
dialog: Lloyd. That’s a noble thing you're
dialog: doing.
text: Lloyd shakes his head.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: Just know that no matter what you
dialog: do, everything's gonna run together
dialog: by the time you're 50.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Yeah. Just - time goes by quicker.
dialog: I don’t know, maybe if my daughter
dialog: had gotten married, if I had some
dialog: grandchildren... maybe that
dialog: would've slowed things down here
dialog: and there.
dialog: 52.
text: Carol sips her coffee again and makes a face.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: People talk about living in the
dialog: moment, like it’s some kind of
dialog: goal. But what does that even mean?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I think it just means don’t let
dialog: yourself be weighed down by what
dialog: you think you should be doing,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: That's just... impossible. There’s
dialog: no such thing as that.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Sure there is. You didn’t feel it
dialog: when you were singing?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Feel what?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Like you were only doing that
dialog: thing. You stop being aware of
dialog: everything else. Like everything
dialog: wrong with your life just
dialog: disappears.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: But people can spend their whole
dialog: lives doing that, waiting for that
dialog: feeling, trying to find that
dialog: feeling over and over again...
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: And in the end, everybody gets it.
dialog: We wait our whole lives for
dialog: something and we get it. And you
dialog: know what it is?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Happiness?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: It’s death.
dialog: 79
dialog: 80
dialog: 81
dialog: 53.
text: Lloyd sips his coffee and nods, looking very serious. Carol
text: nods back at him, also looking serious, then bursts out
text: laughing.

text: Carol walks into the living room, where Lloyd is asleep on
dialog: the couch.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Rise and shine.
text: Lloyd opens his eyes. He looks befuddled.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: You fell asleep and I didn’t know
dialog: what to do. So I just left you
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: That Billie probably lulled me
dialog: down.
text: Carol doesn’t say anything. Lloyd rubs his eyes and sits up.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I’1l make you some coffee but then
dialog: you should go. I... I have to get
dialog: on with my day here.
text: Lloyd looks at her, then looks away.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Okay...
text: Carol awkwardly smiles at him and goes into the kitchen.
text: Lloyd looks around and starts to gather his things to head
dialog: out.
scene_heading: EXT. CAROL’S HOUSE - STREET - MORNING 81
text: Rona pulls in front of Carol’s house, behind Lloyd’s car. She
text: gets out, suspicious of the vehicle. As she does Lloyd come
text: barreling out of the house, heading for his car. He sees Rona
text: looking at him as he does. He stops in his tracks, unsure of
dialog: what to do.
dialog: 82
dialog: 83
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: RONA

speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Hey. What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: I brought the new brochures. They

speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (waving her in)
dialog: Ah. Right. You want some tea?

scene_heading: INT. CAROL'S HOUSE - KITCHEN —- MORNING 83
text: The brochures sit on the counter as Carol pours some coffee.
text: Rona sits at the counter waiting. Carol brings the coffee.
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: Thanks.
text: Rona curls her hands around the cup.
speaker_heading: RONA (CONT'D)
dialog: So... who was that guy?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: What guy?
speaker_heading: RONA
text: The young guy with the bed head
dialog: that just pulled out of your
dialog: driveway.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You’re such a snoop.
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: I am not a snoop. I come over here
dialog: and I see some guy leaving your
dialog: house at eight in the morning. I’m
dialog: wondering what’s going on, is all.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You know what, it’s none of your
dialog: business, Ro.
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: Okay, I know what’s going on here.
dialog: Are you some kind of cougar?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: A what?
text: Rona laughs.
speaker_heading: RONA
text: A cougar.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: What the hell is that supposed to
dialog: mean?
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: I know what you’re up to. You’re a
dialog: cougar and I’m proud of you.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Get out of here with that.
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: Just don’t let him videotape it,
dialog: it’ll be all over the internet.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You would know.
text: Rona laughs again, but underneath it her mood is growing
dialog: serious.
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: You were always the one the guys
dialog: wanted. Still are, I guess.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Ro - stop with that. Why are you
dialog: talking like that?
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: That's just life. Just the way it’s
dialog: always been. You get the guy.
dialog: You're just sneaky about it.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (looking away)
dialog: I can think of one guy I didn’t
dialog: get.
text: Rona looks hurt. This hasn’t been brought up in years.
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: You were happily married for twenty-
dialog: some years and you still think
dialog: about this?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Every day.
text: Rona shakes her head and stands up.
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: I should go.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: No, Ro. It’s...
speaker_heading: RONA

speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Look, forget it. I’1l see you for

speaker_heading: BILL

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Usually, yeah. Good way to get to

speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You ever gonna light that thing?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I used to, all the time. Trying to

speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Oh yeah?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Yeah. And someone once told me I
dialog: have an...oral fixation. So...

speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You do this for all the girls?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I don’t do this for anyone. You're
dialog: the first one out on my boat.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Would I lie?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I have no idea. I’m being very

speaker_heading: CAROL

speaker_heading: BILL

dialog: got no one to leave it to. My plan
dialog: is to spend it all before I go.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: And how's that going so far?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: So far so good. People retire with
dialog: all their money and they don’t know
dialog: what to do with themselves. They
text: just sit. They watch TV. They golf.
text: They go out and eat cheap dinners.
dialog: They go to the movies. Casinos. I
dialog: didn’t want to end up like that.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: So what are you doing living with

speaker_heading: BILL

scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT 112
text: The ladies walk with their grocery cart down the street.
text: Sally is pushing the cart, Georgina is eating handfuls of

text: chewing on a piece of beef jerky. Carol is chugging from a
text: bottle of water.
speaker_heading: GEORGINA
dialog: (pointing at the jerky)
dialog: You can eat that? How can you eat
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: It’s good for your gums.
text: As they walk a POLICE CAR pulls up to them and stops. The

text: out of his car and approaches them.
speaker_heading: OFFICER KAY
dialog: Ladies.
text: The girls stop and squint against the light and try to act
dialog: straight.
speaker_heading: OFFICER KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s going on here?
text: The girls look at each other. No one wants to be the one to
text: talk. They are still a few degrees away from realizing that
dialog: they've stolen the shopping cart.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: GEORGINA
dialog: We've been shopping.
speaker_heading: OFFICER KAY
dialog: I can see that. But what are you
dialog: doing in the street?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: There’s no sidewalk. How’re we
dialog: supposed to get home?
speaker_heading: GEORGINA
dialog: The neighborhood is not pedestrian-
text: friendly, officer.
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: You can’t arrest us, for walking.
dialog: Can you...?
speaker_heading: OFFICER KAY
dialog: People usually drive to the grocery
dialog: store.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Well, we’ve had a few -
speaker_heading: OFFICER KAY
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: - so we walked -
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: - like good, responsible citizens.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Senior citizens.
speaker_heading: OFFICER KAY
dialog: Any of you ladies ever heard of a
dialog: designated driver?
speaker_heading: GEORGINA
text: (reaching into the box of
dialog: Fruity Pebbles)
dialog: We didn’t plan that far ahead.
speaker_heading: OFFICER KAY
text: (staring at Georgina for a
dialog: long beat)
dialog: Uh-huh. What about this shopping
dialog: cart?
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: GEORGINA
dialog: What about it?
speaker_heading: OFFICER KAY
dialog: You plan on returning that? Because
dialog: technically that’s theft. And then
dialog: we've got public intoxication...
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: Do we look like thieves to you?
speaker_heading: OFFICER KAY
dialog: (humorlessly)
dialog: A thief doesn’t have a specific
dialog: look, ma‘am. A thief is just a
dialog: person who takes something that
dialog: doesn’t belong to them.
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: Well, uh...
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (jumping in)
dialog: We borrowed it. Alphonse said it
dialog: was okay.
speaker_heading: OFFICER KAY
dialog: Who’s Alphonse?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: He’s the manager.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: Yeah. Alphonse!
speaker_heading: GEORGINA
dialog: We're just a bunch of old ladies.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: We’re too old and feeble to carry
dialog: all these groceries home. You
dialog: understand.
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: And we're turning off just a block
dialog: up the road, officer. We’re in the
dialog: Royal Oaks Retirement Village.
speaker_heading: OFFICER KAY
dialog: Uh-huh.
dialog: 113
dialog: 80.
text: Officer Kay looks them over.
speaker_heading: OFFICER KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Well... just be safe and stay out
text: of the middle of the road now.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Yes, officer.
text: Officer Kay gets back in his cruiser and drives off. The
text: girls react like teenagers to the whole situation - laughing
text: and high-fiving.
speaker_heading: RONA
dialog: “Alphonse”? Who’s Alphonse?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I don’t know. I just made it up.
text: They walk off down the street joshing and cracking jokes to
dialog: each other.
scene_heading: EXT. SALLY’S HOUSE - BACK PORCH - NIGHT 113

speaker_heading: SALLY

speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Yeah? To which things?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You're just stoned.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: No, that’s all worn off. I just
dialog: feel out of touch, you know? Like I
dialog: don’t know what’s going on with you
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: That's because nothing’s going on
dialog: with me.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I wouldn’t know.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Oh, come on Sally. What are you
dialog: saying?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Like... I feel like you don’t want
dialog: to admit how you’re feeling. You
dialog: just - you don’t share.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: When did I ever share?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I’m just saying - nobody knows how
dialog: you're really doing.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I would tell you if I knew myself.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: You would?
text: They are quiet for a moment, staring out into the night air.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I guess in the back of my mind I’m
dialog: starting to be convinced that I’m
dialog: an utter failure.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: What? How?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Maybe in many ways.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: What on Earth would have convinced
dialog: you of that?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I feel like I’ve... missed my mark.
dialog: I’ve left behind my true self.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Left it behind when?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Maybe about forty years ago.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: There’s no such thing as your true
dialog: self.
dialog: 114
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: That’s a bunch of New Age mumbo-
dialog: jumbo. If everybody were their true
dialog: selves... what a world of assholes
dialog: we'd be living in. We’d all be
dialog: picking food out of our teeth and
text: making kissy lips at each other
dialog: like orangutans.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: This is the end, Sally. We’re at
dialog: the end. And if I were to go right
dialog: now —
dialog: (snaps her fingers)
dialog: - like that, what’s left of me? I
dialog: mean, Bill’s been gone twenty
dialog: years. And he’s just gone. I
dialog: think of him all the time, but
dialog: besides that, some snapshots,
dialog: that’s all that’s left of him. And
dialog: when I’m gone - okay, then Kath is
dialog: still thinking of us. And when she
dialog: goes, we’re both gone. We’re all
dialog: gone. It’s like we never existed.
text: Sally looks at her, stupefied.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Carol, I - I just was worried about
dialog: you, with Hazel gone, whether you
dialog: were lonely. Jesus, I didn’t -
text: Carol closes her eyes very slowly, then opens them.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: He was a dog, what more can I say?
dialog: I walked him every day -
text: Carol chokes up on “day” and breaks down crying. Sally puts
text: her hand on her shoulder and rubs her back, comforting her.

speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: What are we doing? Are we doing

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Because I’m out of practice with

dialog: it’s just like riding a bike
dialog: because I can’t ride a bike to save
dialog: my life.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: It’s just like swinging a golf

speaker_heading: CAROL

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: That means you’re not speaking

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I’m just testing the waters.
speaker_heading: CAROL
