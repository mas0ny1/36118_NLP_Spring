dialog: love, this caring, this sharing of
dialog: life, it's a sentence and my heart
dialog: has been condemned. It doesn't

dialog: shunned me in life and in love.
dialog: Unanswered phone calls... Unnoticed

dialog: enough. Just once, just one fucking

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR
dialog: Your only condemnation is self-
dialog: pity. You have people that care all
