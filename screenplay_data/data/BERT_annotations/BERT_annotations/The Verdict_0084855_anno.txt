speaker_heading: GALVIN

speaker_heading: GALVIN

dialog: but we all know where the money's
dialog: going to... I have an interest in
dialog: the Hospital; and I don't want those
text: bozos working in the same shop as

dialog: 'em. Now: how many others did they
dialog: kill?

dialog: that she must do in the community
dialog: has to maintain the position that

speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: ...nothing, of course, can begin to

dialog: we can. We must do all that we can.
text: He gestures to the Young Priest, who crosses the room,
text: extracts a sheet from a file folder, and places it before
text: Galvin, who is sitting as if in a dream. The Bishop waits a

speaker_heading: GALVIN

speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: We thought it was just.
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: You thought it was just.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: Because it struck me how neatly

speaker_heading: BISHOP

speaker_heading: GALVIN

speaker_heading: GALVIN

speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: What is the truth?
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: That that poor girl put her trust in

dialog: 12th." He underlines it heavily.
speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: Our court date is January twelfth.
dialog: You're all acquainted with this case.

dialog: months. We have the attorney for the
dialog: Plaintiff, Frank Galvin -- and I
dialog: trust you are all familiar with his

speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: I think I will.
text: Galvin motions "another round" to the bartender.
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: Jimmy!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That's why the court exists. The

dialog: justice, eh? But to give them a chance
dialog: at justice.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: And are they going to get it?
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: They might. Yes. That's the point...
dialog: is that they might... you see, the
dialog: jury wants to believe. They're all
dialog: cynics, sure, because they want to
dialog: believe. I have to go in there
dialog: tomorrow to find twelve people to
dialog: hear this case. I'm going to see a
dialog: hundred people and pick twelve. And
dialog: every one of them it's written on
dialog: their face, 'This is a sham. There
dialog: is no justice...' but in their heart
dialog: they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Maybe what?
speaker_heading: GALVIN

speaker_heading: JUDGE

scene_heading: ANGLE - P.O.V. GALVIN

scene_heading: ANGLE - THE JUDGE, CONCANNON, GALVIN
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Now, have you boys tried to resolve

speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: This is a complicated case, your
dialog: Honor...
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me
dialog: tell you something. If we find it so
dialog: complex, how in the hell you think
dialog: you're going to make a jury understand
dialog: it?
dialog: (smiles at Galvin)
dialog: See my point? Let's talk a minute.
dialog: Frank: what will you and your client
dialog: take right now this very minute to
dialog: walk out of here and let this damn
dialog: thing drop?
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: My client can't walk, your Honor.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: I know full well she can't, Frank.
dialog: You see the Padre on your way out
dialog: and he'll punch your ticket. You
dialog: follow me? I'm trying to help you.
speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the
dialog: Archdiocese have offered plaintiff
dialog: two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Huh!
speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: My doctors didn't want a settlement
dialog: at any price. They wanted this cleared
dialog: up in court. They want their
dialog: vindication. I agree with them. But
dialog: for today the offer stands. Before
dialog: we begin the publicity of a trial.
dialog: For today only.
dialog: (beat)

speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: We are going to try the case.

dialog: (beat; turns to Galvin)
dialog: Frank: I don't think I'm talking out
dialog: of school, but I just heard someone
dialog: offer you two hundred grand... and
dialog: that's a lot of money... and if I
dialog: may say, you haven't got the best of
dialog: records.
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: ...things change.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: ...that's true. Sometimes they change,
dialog: sometimes they don't. Now, I remember
dialog: back to when you were disbarred...
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the
dialog: pro...
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: And it seems to me, a fella's trying
dialog: to come back, he'd take this
dialog: settlement, and get a record for
dialog: himself.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I myself would take it and run like
dialog: a thief.
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: I'm sure you would.
text: The Judge turns, unbelieving that Galvin has patronized and
text: insulted him. He controls himself.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Hm.
dialog: (beat; checking book)
dialog: We have the date set? Next Thursday.
dialog: Good.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: See you boys in court.

speaker_heading: DR. TOWLER
dialog: I was her doctor.
speaker_heading: CONCANNON

speaker_heading: DR. TOWLER
dialog: We went to Code Blue...
speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: 'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
speaker_heading: DR. TOWLER
dialog: It's a common medical expression,

speaker_heading: DR. TOWLER

speaker_heading: CONCANNON

speaker_heading: DR. TOWLER

speaker_heading: CONCANNON

speaker_heading: DR. TOWLER
dialog: Well, we...

speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: It's a terrible thing to sit in
dialog: judgment. So much rides on it. I
dialog: know that you've thought, 'How can I
dialog: be pure. How can I be impartial
dialog: without being cold. How can I be
dialog: merciful and still be just?' And I
dialog: know that most of you have said some
dialog: sort of prayer this morning to be
dialog: helped. To judge correctly. We have
dialog: the reputation of two men. Two well
dialog: respected doctors and a renowned
dialog: hospital before us. And with those
dialog: two respected men we have my client,

speaker_heading: ALITO

speaker_heading: YOUNG LAWYER

speaker_heading: ALITO
dialog: What did he find?
speaker_heading: YOUNG LAWYER
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: ALITO
dialog: How good's your intelligence?
speaker_heading: YOUNG LAWYER
dialog: Very good.
speaker_heading: ALITO

speaker_heading: YOUNG LAWYER

speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows,
dialog: you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.
dialog: Is that correct?
speaker_heading: DR. THOMPSON
dialog: That is correct. I was engaged to
dialog: render an opinion.
speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: Engaged to render an opinion. For a
dialog: price. Is that correct? You're being
dialog: paid to be here today?
speaker_heading: DR. THOMPSON
dialog: Just as you are, Sir...
speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: Are you board-certified in
dialog: anesthesiology, Doctor?
speaker_heading: DR. THOMPSON
dialog: No, I am not. It's quite common in
dialog: New York State...
speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: ...I'm sure it is, but this is

speaker_heading: DR. THOMPSON
dialog: No.

speaker_heading: DR. THOMPSON
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CONCANNON

speaker_heading: DR. THOMPSON
dialog: I'm just an M.D.
speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
speaker_heading: DR. THOMPSON
dialog: I know of him.
speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: How is that?
speaker_heading: DR. THOMPSON
dialog: Through, through his book.
speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: What book is that?
speaker_heading: DR. THOMPSON

speaker_heading: CONCANNON

speaker_heading: DR. THOMPSON
dialog: I am seventy-four years old.
speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of

speaker_heading: DR. THOMPSON
dialog: I'm on the staff of...
speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you

dialog: you're available for that? When you're
dialog: paid to be there?
speaker_heading: DR. THOMPSON
dialog: Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong...
dialog: as in this case, I am available. I
dialog: am seventy-four years old, I am not

speaker_heading: DR. THOMPSON
dialog: I have been practicing medicine for

dialog: injustice has been done.
speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: Do you, indeed. I'll bet you do.

speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: (in undertone, to

dialog: All right. Mr. Galvin, you want to
dialog: continue now, or we can resume with
dialog: Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: (rising)
dialog: Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue.
dialog: Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah
dialog: Ann Kaye last night at The Northern
dialog: Chronic Care Facility?
speaker_heading: DR. THOMPSON
dialog: I did.
speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: Objection.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Sustained. Yes. The witness will
dialog: confine his testimony to review of
dialog: the hospital records.
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: (patronizing)
dialog: I believe that's the law... is it
dialog: not, Mr. Galvin...?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: Dr. Thompson. From your review of
dialog: the hospital records of May twelfth
dialog: nineteen seventy-six.
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: In your opinion, what happened to
dialog: Deborah Ann Kaye?
speaker_heading: DR. THOMPSON
dialog: Cardiac arrest. During delivery her
text: heart stopped. When the heart stops
dialog: the brain's deprived of oxygen. You
dialog: get brain damage. That is why she's
dialog: in the state she's in today.
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: Now, Dr. Towler's testified that
dialog: they restored the heartbeat within
dialog: three or four minutes. In your opinion
dialog: is his estimate correct?
speaker_heading: DR. THOMPSON
dialog: It's my opinion it took him much
dialog: longer. Nine... ten minutes. There's
dialog: too much brain damage.
text: The Judge leans over.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: (to Dr. Thompson)
dialog: Are you saying that a failure to
dialog: restore the heartbeat within nine
dialog: minutes in itself constitutes bad
dialog: medical practice?
speaker_heading: DR. THOMPSON
dialog: Well...
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: Your Honor!
text: He has shouted unconsciously; the whole Courtroom turns to
text: look at him.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Yes, Mr. Galvin?
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: If I may be permitted to question my
dialog: own witness in my own way...
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: I'd just like to get to the point,
dialog: Mr. Galvin. Let's not waste these
dialog: people's time. Answer the question,
dialog: Mr. Witness. Please. Would a nine
dialog: minute lapse in restoring the
dialog: heartbeat in and of itself be
dialog: negligence?
speaker_heading: DR. THOMPSON
dialog: I... in that small context I would
dialog: have... I would have to say 'no.'
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Then you're saying there's no
dialog: negligence, based on my question?
speaker_heading: DR. THOMPSON
dialog: I... given the limits of your
dialog: question, that's correct.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: The Doctors were not negligent.
speaker_heading: DR. THOMPSON
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I... um...
dialog: The Judge shrugs, meaning, "Well then what in the hell are
dialog: we doing here?"
speaker_heading: ANGLE

speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Thank you.

speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: I'm not through with the witness,
dialog: your Honor. With all due respect if
dialog: you are going to try my case for me
dialog: I would appreciate it if you wouldn't
dialog: lose it.
text: The Judge stands, furious.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Thank you. I think that's enough for
dialog: this morning. I'll see the Plaintiff's

speaker_heading: JUDGE

dialog: you're on your way out... They should
dialog: have kicked you out on that
dialog: Lillibridge case. Now this is it
dialog: today.
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: I'm an attorney on trial before the
dialog: bar. Representing my client. My
dialog: client, do you understand? You open
dialog: your mouth and you're losing my case
dialog: for me.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Listen to me, fella...
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: No, no, you listen to me. All I wanted
dialog: in this case is an even shake. You
dialog: rushed me into court in five days...
dialog: my star witness disappears, I can't
dialog: get a continuance, and I don't give
dialog: a damn. I'm going up there and I'm
dialog: going to try it. Let the Jury decide.
dialog: They told me Sweeney he's a hard-
dialog: ass, he's a defendant's judge. I
dialog: don't care. I said, the hell with
dialog: it. The hell with it. I'll take my
dialog: chances he'll be fair.
text: Galvin is pacing. Beat.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: (conciliatory)
dialog: Galvin, look, many years ago...
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: And don't give me this shit, 'I was
dialog: a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who
dialog: you were. You couldn't hack it as a
dialog: lawyer. You were Bag Man for the
dialog: Boys and you still are. I know who
dialog: you are.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: (beat; barely
dialog: controlling anger)
dialog: Are you done?
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: Damn right I'm done. I'm going to
dialog: ask for a mistrial and I'm going to
dialog: request that you disqualify yourself
dialog: from sitting on this case. I'm going
dialog: to take a transcript to the State
dialog: and ask that they impeach your ass.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: You aren't going to get a mistrial,
dialog: boy. We're going back this afternoon,
dialog: we're going to try this case to an

speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: Your Honor...! Your Honor...
speaker_heading: TOWLER
dialog: Brain damage could have been... it
dialog: didn't necessarily take nine minutes,

speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that

dialog: for two minutes...?
speaker_heading: TOWLER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: (contemptuous)
dialog: Huh. And why is that?
speaker_heading: TOWLER
dialog: Because she was anemic.

text: Dead, resigned. He closes the phone book. He reaches in a
text: pack of cigarettes on the desk. It is empty. He roots in the

text: He stands by Laura and looks down at her, he looks at Mickey.
text: He has let them down. He goes to a cabinet under the lawbooks
text: and takes out a bottle of whiskey and a water glass. He walks
text: into the anteroom. Sighs, sits on the couch near the door.
text: Glances at the several letters that have just fallen through
text: the slot. He pours a half-tumbler full of whiskey, and drains
text: it. He refills the tumbler. He absently picks up the mail

text: official-looking piece.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - P.O.V.

speaker_heading: GALVIN

speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: What are you doing in New York...?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...

text: Half full of spectators.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: Galvin gets up from Plaintiff's table, takes up a large book

speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: Dr. Towler; page 406,
dialog: 'Contraindications to general
dialog: anesthetic. Ideally a patient should
dialog: refrain from taking nourishment up
dialog: to nine hours prior to induction of
dialog: general anesthetic.' Does that sound
dialog: familiar?
speaker_heading: DR. TOWLER
dialog: Yes. I wrote it.
text: Galvin shows the book.
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: 'Practice and Methodology in
dialog: Anaesthesia.' General textbook on
dialog: the subject. Is that correct?
speaker_heading: DR. TOWLER
dialog: I. Yes. It is.
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: And you wrote that...
speaker_heading: DR. TOWLER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: (reading)
dialog: ...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken
dialog: nourishment within one hour prior to
dialog: inducement, general anesthetic should
dialog: be avoided at all costs because of
dialog: the grave risk the patient will
dialog: aspirate food particles into his
dialog: mask.' Is that what happened to
dialog: Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into
dialog: her mask?
speaker_heading: DR. TOWLER
text: She threw up in her mask, yes. But
dialog: she hadn't eaten one hour prior to
dialog: admission.
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: If she had eaten, say one hour prior
dialog: to admission, the inducement of a
dialog: general anesthetic... the type you
dialog: gave her... would have been
dialog: negligent...?
speaker_heading: DR. TOWLER
dialog: Negligent. Yes... it would have been
dialog: criminal. But that was not the case.
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: Thank you.
text: Galvin signals he is done. The Judge signals Dr. Towler to

speaker_heading: JUDGE

speaker_heading: BAILIFF

speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: Kathy at the back of the court, coming down the aisle. As

speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: Galvin surveys the courtroom, Kathy crosses in front of him,

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: She said she had a full meal one

speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: One hour.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: And did you write the numeral 'one'

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I did.
speaker_heading: GALVIN
text: A single hour.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Yes.
text: Galvin walks away from the witness box. He looks at the jury.
text: He turns to look at the spectators. His thoughts are a million
text: miles away. Unconsciously he straightens his tie.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: Galvin in front of the dead-still courtroom. He breaks his

speaker_heading: GALVIN

speaker_heading: KATHY

speaker_heading: CONCANNON

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I wouldn't do it.
speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: You would not...?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: In fact, you've just taken an oath
dialog: that you would not commit perjury.
dialog: You've just sworn to that. Isn't
dialog: that right?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: Just now...
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: ...sworn before God you would tell
dialog: the truth?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: Now. I'd like to ask you something:
dialog: four years ago, when you were working
dialog: as a nurse, are you aware that Drs.
dialog: Towler and Marx based their treatment
dialog: of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart
dialog: that you signed...?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I...
speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: And wasn't that an oath...? These
dialog: are your initials here: K.C. When
dialog: you signed this chart you took an
dialog: oath. No less important than that
dialog: which you took today.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Isn't that right?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Isn't that right...?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I... yes.
speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: Then, please, which is correct? You've
dialog: sworn today the patient ate one hour
dialog: ago. Four years ago you swore she
dialog: ate nine hours ago? Which is the
dialog: lie. When were you lying?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I...
speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: You know these doctors could have
dialog: settled out of court. They wanted a
dialog: trial. They wanted to clear their
dialog: names.
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: Objection!
speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: And you would come here, and on a
dialog: slip of memory four years ago, you'd
dialog: ruin their lives.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: They lied.
speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: 'They lied.' Indeed! When did they
dialog: lie? And do you know what a lie is?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I do. Yes.
speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: (holding chart)
dialog: You swore on this form that the
dialog: patient ate nine hours ago.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: That's not my handwriting.
speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: You've just said you signed it.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But
dialog: I, I didn't write that figure.
speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: You didn't write that figure. And
dialog: how is it that you remember that so
dialog: clearly after four years?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: (taking a paper out
dialog: of her purse)
dialog: Because I kept a copy. I have it
dialog: right here.

speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Please proceed.
text: Concannon motions to Billy, the young lawyer, who nods in
text: response and starts whispering instructions to his colleagues
text: at the Defense table, who start leafing through their

speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: ...what in the world would induce
dialog: you to make a photocopy of some
dialog: obscure record and hold it four years?
dialog: This is a... why? Why would you do
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I thought I would need it.
speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: And why, please tell us, would you
dialog: think that?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: After, after the operation, when
dialog: that poor girl, she went in a coma.
dialog: Dr. Towler called me in. He told me
dialog: he had five difficult deliveries in
dialog: a row and he was tired, and he never
text: looked at the admittance form.

dialog: And he told me to change the form.
dialog: He told me to change the one to a
dialog: nine.

dialog: Or else, or else, he said...

text: Defense table, who is gathering notes from his colleagues,
text: who have been researching during Kathy's speech.
text: Concannon walks over to the table and is quickly "talked
dialog: through" the notes by Billy.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Mr. Concannon.
dialog: Concannon cuts Billy short, meaning, "Yes, I understand, I'm
text: far ahead of you," he takes the notes and returns to the
dialog: bench.
speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: Thank you, your Honor. We object to
dialog: the copy of the admissions form as
text: incompetent and essentially hearsay
dialog: evidence and cite McGee versus State
dialog: of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216
dialog: through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The
dialog: admission of a duplicate document in
dialog: preference to an existing original
dialog: must presuppose the possibility of
dialog: alteration and so must be disallowed.'
dialog: And, your Honor, having given the
dialog: Plaintiff the leeway we would like
dialog: your ruling on this issue now: we
dialog: object to the admission of the Xerox
dialog: form.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: ...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
text: The Judge nods, meaning, "I am considering..."
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: The Judge. He is making some notations on a page in front of
text: him. He nods to himself, he has reached a decision. He looks
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: The document is disallowed, the jury
dialog: will be advised not to consider the
dialog: testimony of Kathy Costello regarding
text: the Xerox form.
dialog: (explains to them)
dialog: It's unsubstantiated and we can't
dialog: accept a copy in preference to the
dialog: original...
speaker_heading: CONCANNON
dialog: Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms.
text: Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a
dialog: 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve
dialog: to rebut direct testimony. As her
dialog: only evidentiary rebuttal was the
dialog: admitting form, which has been
dialog: disallowed I request that her entire
dialog: testimony be disallowed and the jury
dialog: advised that they must totally
text: disregard her appearance here.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: I'm going to uphold that.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: Galvin getting to his feet.
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: I object, your Honor...
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Overruled...
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: Exception!
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Noted. Thank you.
dialog: (to Jury)
dialog: Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.
dialog: Her sole rebuttal was the document,
dialog: which has been disallowed...
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: Galvin, silent, fuming, sitting at the table.
speaker_heading: JUDGE (V.O.)
dialog: Her entire testimony must be stricken
dialog: from the record. You shouldn't have
dialog: heard it, but you did. Now, that was
dialog: my mistake... and you must strike it
dialog: from your minds, give it no weight.
text: Galvin takes a sheet of legal paper and starts writing on
dialog: it.

speaker_heading: ALITO
dialog: Legally it's over. Concannon was
dialog: brilliant.
speaker_heading: BROPHY
dialog: Tell me about Kaitlin Costello.
speaker_heading: ALITO
dialog: There's nothing to tell. It's been
text: stricken from the record.
speaker_heading: BROPHY
dialog: I know. Did you believe her?
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - JUDGE HOYLE'S P.O.V. - FULL COURTROOM - DAY

speaker_heading: ANGLE
speaker_heading: JUDGE SWEENEY
dialog: Mr. Galvin...?
speaker_heading: ANGLE - GALVIN
text: In front of the full jury box. Beat.
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: You know, so much of the time we're
dialog: lost. We say, 'Please, God, tell us
dialog: what is right. Tell us what's true.
dialog: There is no justice. The rich win,
dialog: the poor are powerless...' We become
text: tired of hearing people lie. After a
dialog: time we become dead. A little dead.
dialog: We start thinking of ourselves as
dialog: victims.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: And we become victims.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: And we become weak... and doubt
dialog: ourselves, and doubt our
dialog: institutions... and doubt our
dialog: beliefs... we say for example, 'The
dialog: law is a sham... there is no law...
dialog: I was a fool for having believed
dialog: there was.'
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But today you are the law. You are
dialog: the law... And not some book and not
dialog: the lawyers, or the marble statues
dialog: and the trappings of the court...
dialog: all that they are is symbols.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Of our desire to be just...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: All that they are, in effect, is a
dialog: prayer...
dialog: (beat)
text: ...a fervent, and a frightened prayer.
speaker_heading: GALVIN
dialog: In my religion we say, 'Act as if
dialog: you had faith, and faith will be
dialog: given to you.'
dialog: (beat)
dialog: If... If we would have faith in
dialog: justice, we must only believe in
dialog: ourselves.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And act with justice.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And I believe that there is justice
dialog: in our hearts.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Thank you.

text: The Jury Box. The Jurors seated, the FOREMAN standing.
speaker_heading: FOREMAN
dialog: Your Honor, we have agreed to hold
dialog: for the Plaintiff... but on the size
dialog: of the award, are we bound...
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: You are not bound by anything, other
dialog: than your good judgment, based on
dialog: the evidence.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: Galvin, totally defeated. Nods his head sadly, as if
text: commiserating philosophically, with himself. Mickey looks at
text: him in grief, with sympathy.
speaker_heading: FOREMAN (V.O.)
dialog: Are we permitted to award an amount
dialog: greater than the amount the Plaintiff
dialog: asked for?
text: Galvin slowly raises his head, turns and looks at the Jury,
text: Mickey begins to smile.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Yes. You are.

scene_heading: INT. FINAL COURTHOUSE BACK CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Galvin and Mickey standing near a back staircase, cleaning
text: equipment is lying all around. A large, battered garbage

speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (to Galvin)
dialog: The jury might be out for awhile.
dialog: (beat; tentatively)
dialog: You want to run across the street
dialog: and get a drink?
text: Beat. Galvin puts his arm around Mickey's shoulder. They
text: push through the Exit Door, turning up their collars to the
text: cold. Galvin hesitates a moment as Mickey goes through the
text: door. Beat. He looks back longingly.
scene_heading: ANGLE - GALVIN'S P.O.V.

speaker_heading: ANGLE
