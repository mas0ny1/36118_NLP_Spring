text: Dave's best/only friend OSCAR looks up from his Game Boy.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Close your eyes.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: (through absurd braces)
dialog: You're not gonna kish me, are you?
text: Dave shoots him a look. Oscar sighs, closes his eyes. So
dialog: does Dave and so does --
text: BECKY (10), a brunette beauty sitting just in front of them.
text: The coolest girl in class, she hardly knows Dave exists.
text: KA-CHUNG! The bus hits a grate -- Dave's cue. He counts
text: under his breath, knows the precise number until:
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: .--okay...and...open your eyes!
text: Dave and Becky open their eyes at the exact instant that the
text: dark tunnel gives way to the majestic, gleaming spires of --
text: NEW YORK CITY -- The most magical city in the world!
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: (back to his Game Boy)
dialog: Thatsh shome pretty lame magic.
speaker_heading: BECKY (0.S.)

scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY

dialog: heroic in Rockefeller Center...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MUSEUM OF MODERN ART - DAY
text: Becky stands in silhouette in front of Chagall's "Aleko and
text: Zemphira by Moonlight." A boy and girl levitate together in
text: the nighttime sky -- a child's dream brought to magical life.
text: A second silhouette steps into frame: Dave.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: I love the way they float up like
dialog: that. I come here a lot with my
dialog: parents. I like all of the
dialog: paintings, but I love this one
dialog: the most...
text: Dave looks at her, falling truly, madly, deeply in love --
text: and feeling the sudden urge to tell her.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Becky...
text: Becky turns to look at him. Dave trails off, too scared to
dialog: tell.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: +..never mind.
text: The rest of the class floods into the room. As Becky joins
text: her FRIENDS, Dave knows he blew it.
scene_heading: EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE - DAY
text: Dave's class gathers around their teacher, MS. ALGAR, in front
text: of the famed WASHINGTON SQUARE ARCH.
speaker_heading: MS. ALGAR
dialog: -..this park served as a burial
dialog: ground in the early 1800's. To
dialog: this day over 20,000 bodies rest
text: beneath Washington Square...
text: A creeped-out Dave stares at his feet as Ms. Algar points out
text: a desolate-looking ELM TREE.
speaker_heading: MS. ALGAR
dialog: +-.and this is Hangman's Elm, at
dialog: 300 years, the oldest tree in
dialog: Manhattan. Traitors were hanged
dialog: here during the Revolutionary War...
text: A CREAKING in the withered branches. Just the wind.
text: MOMENTS LATER -- Dave watches Becky from afar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: How do I tell her how amazing she
dialog: is...?
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Playah, everybody knowsh that. Buy
text: her shomething exshpensive.
text: Dave digs his money out of his pockets. Three bucks.
text: Make that TWO BUCKS as a sudden GUST OF WIND blows a DOLLAR
dialog: BILL out of his hand!
text: The bill hits the ground. Dave leans over to grab it when a
text: BIKE MESSENGER runs over it. The bill sticks to the tire.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Hey, stop!
text: The bike keeps going. Dave runs after the bike, out onto
text: Third Street, where the bill falls off the tire...
text: And gets snatched up by a FRENCH POODLE!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Ma'am, your dog! Stop!!
text: But the JOGGING WOMAN can't hear over her headphones.
text: Dave chases the dog down a brick lane lined with eclectic
text: shops. The dog spits out the bill and keeps going.
text: Dave pulls up, breathing hard. He leans over to pick up the
text: bill, then straightens up to find himself looking at --
dialog: THE RING...
text: ++san unusual ring on display in a shop window. The band is
text: silver, an ancient design; the "gem" is a gray stone that's
text: been carved into a long, intricate DRAGON.
text: Dave notices the shop's sign: "ARCANA CABANA - ANTIQUITIES,
scene_heading: OBSCURITIES, UNUSUAL GIFTS - BALTHAZAR BLAKE, PROPRIETOR."
text: The street has gone eerily quiet. Dave feels an urge to go
text: back the way he came, but drawn by the promise of "Unusual
text: Gifts," he walks into the store, going past --
text: THE CAR -- parked at the curb, a gleaming monster in black
text: and chrome: The 1930 BENTLEY SPEED 6 CORSICA...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ARCANA CABANA -— CONTINUOUS
text: Turns out "unusual" is an understatement. The shop is narrow
text: but deep, and packed with all manner of strange objects:
scene_heading: An EGYPTIAN MUMMY CASE...weird EXPRESSIONISTIC PAINTINGS...
text: CALIGARI-ESQUE FURNITURE...a yellow-eyed STUFFED OWL that
text: casts weird, animated shadows on the wall...
text: Dave FEELS SOMEONE WATCHING HIM, whirls around to see --
text: A_MACABRE URN. Two feet tall, it looks hand-painted by
scene_heading: Hieronymus Bosch: TORMENTED SOULS and terrifying MONSTER MEN
text: writhe in agony in a nightmare landscape...
text: Dave is about to touch the urn's ornate lid when --
text: A HAND snatches his wrist! Dave GASPS, looks up to see...
text: BALTHAZAR BLAKE (40) knows how to make an entrance. Tall and
text: grim, eyes ringed in black, he wears a long black coat adorned
text: with cryptic ALCHEMICAL SYMBOLS. A goth-rock Lord Byron...
dialog: And as Byron himself was once described, Balthazar gives every
dialog: impression of being "mad, bad and dangerous to know."
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: (off the urn)
dialog: You break that one and we both buy
dialog: it.
dialog: (releases Dave's hand)
dialog: Looking for something in particular?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (freaked)
dialog: Just a gift...for someone special.
text: Balthazar cocks an eyebrow. He steps behind a display case
text: and picks up a blood-colored, heart-shaped GLASS JAR.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: This jar held the hearts of Antony
dialog: and Cleopatra for a thousand
dialog: years...until they turned to dust.
text: Dave smiles awkwardly, unsure how to respond.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: What, a jar stuffed with the
dialog: disembodied hearts of history's
dialog: greatest lovers not romantic enough
dialog: for you? Gee, I'm sorry, I'm fresh
dialog: out of promise rings!
dialog: |
dialog: |
dialog: |
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: It's not that. It's just...
dialog: (nervous; deflecting)
dialog: Hey, that's a cool ring!
text: BALTHAZAR'S RING -- is indeed cool, and very unusual: a
text: luminous GREEN DIAMOND set in an intricate Gothic setting.
text: Is it a trick of the light or does the ring fleetingly GLOW?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: The way it catches the light...
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: (knowingly)
dialog: Yeah...look at that.
text: Balthazar looks up, stares intently at Dave, appraising him.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: I do have another ring...
text: Balthazar goes to the front window and grabs the unusual
text: DRAGON RING we saw earlier. He holds out the ring to Dave.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Go ahead...try it on.
text: Dave stares at the ring, feels its strange pull...then sees
text: Balthazar standing over him, staring like a madman.
text: Dave gasps, steps back -- right into a GLASS CISTERN that
text: CRASHES to the floor! Water and glass go flying. Dave looks
text: up in horror as Balthazar advances.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Was -- was that valuable?
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
text: The last drops of water from the
dialog: Lost City of Atlantis? Gee, what
dialog: do you think, Dave?!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: How'd you know my name is --
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Show me your hands.
text: Dave stammers, confused.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Show me your hands!
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
text: Dave panics, shuts his eyes and holds out his hands, fearing
text: the worst. He feels something, opens his eyes to see...
text: A WOODEN MOP -- lies across his hands. Balthazar heads for
text: the stairs at the back of the shop.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: I want the floor shined, the
text: shelves dusted and the windows
text: spotless. The cobwebs stay.
text: Dave bolts for the door but the DEADBOLT has been locked with
text: a key. He BANGS on the door in vain.
text: ON THE STAIRS -- Balthazar drops a KEY in his pocket.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: I'll be in my study.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You can't keep me here! My class
dialog: will be looking for me!
text: The door to Balthazar's study SLAMS SHUT.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Please let them be looking for me.
text: Dave looks around the shop, tries hard to breathe. He is so
dialog: screwed.
text: MOMENTS LATER -~ Dave mops the floor, keeping an eye on every
text: shadow and dark corner, of which there are many.
text: He sees some OLD PHOTOS taped to the wall behind a display
text: case. He leans the mop against a shelf and walks over to the
text: display. The DRAGON RING sits at the end of the case as Dave
dialog: leans in to see --
text: THE PHOTOGRAPHS -- are of a raven-haired YOUNG WOMAN, alluring
text: and mysterious. The last photo shows the woman standing in
text: this very shop, joined by an OLD MAN. .
text: Suddenly Dave looks down at the case, sees --
text: THE RING -- is in a different place. Closer to Dave.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Weren't you just over there?
text: Dave stares at the ring, simultaneously repelled and
text: attracted to it. He looks both ways, then picks up the ring.
text: AN ENGRAVING is etched along the gleaming band:
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: "Take me up..."
text: Dave turns the ring over. On the other side it says:
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: "Cast me away..."
text: The ring is sitting in the palm of his hand when --
text: THE DRAGON'S CLAWS AND TAIL -- coil and tighten around his
text: finger! Dave SHOUTS with surprise, grows frantic as he pulls
dialog: harder and harder --
text: THE RING IS HAPPY WHERE IT Is.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Come on! Come on!!!
text: Dave shakes his hand violently, then looks over to see --
text: THE MOP -- is moving back and forth in perfect sync!
text: Dave GASPS, freezes. The mop stops bolt upright.
text: Dave moves his hand to the left. The mop SWISHES across the
text: floor to the left. He moves his hand to the right -- again,
text: THE MOP FOLLOWS.
text: The world as Dave knows it has just changed. He's barely
dialog: begun to process this when --
text: A SUDDEN KNOCKING SOUND -- spins him around. Persistent and
text: getting louder, it's coming from the back of the shop...
text: A MAHOGANY BOX -- sits on an antique table. The box looks
text: ancient, as does the PADLOCK that secures its lid.
text: THE KNOCKING is coming from inside the box. Dave stares at
text: the box, wary but somehow enthralled. As he lifts his hand to
dialog: touch the box --
text: KLINNK! The padlock POPS OPEN. Eyes wide with wonder, Dave
text: opens the box...
text: A STRANGE NESTING DOLL -- sits inside. What appears to be a
text: SORCERER of some kind is painted on the outermost doll, in a
text: style that evokes a medieval stained glass. Creepy...
text: +.-and entrancing. Dave picks up the doll, curious what the
text: next doll must look like. He doesn't notice as --
text: THE EYES -- on the DRAGON RING begin to glow.
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
text: Dave turns the top of the doll, which SNAPS into place. Then
text: he pulls the top from the bottom and --
text: VOOOSSHHH!!! A TONGUE OF CRIMSON FLAME explodes out of the
text: doll and up to the ceiling. A FIGURE levitates in the
text: bilious smoke. And as the smoke clears...
speaker_heading: DARK FIGURE
dialog: Finally, finally...
text: MAXIM HORVATH (40) floats there, an evil sorcerer of the
text: deadliest rank, and a crazy-eyed motherf**ker.
speaker_heading: MAXIM HORVATH
dialog: «..FREEDOM, BABY!!!
text: Dave SCREAMS, music to Horvath's ears. The eyes on his SKULL
text: RING begin to GLOW RED, when suddenly --
text: WHOOM!!! A SPHERE of highly-ionized, electro-magnetically
dialog: compressed matter -- what a physicist would recognize as
text: PLASMA, the fourth state of matter -- SLAMS into Horvath and
text: sends him flying.
dialog: ‘As we'll learn, we've just seen what Stephen Hawking would
text: call a PLASMOID -- and Balthazar Blake, a PLASMA BOLT.
text: Dave turns to see Balthazar on the stairs, his hands splayed
text: out, his RING glowing.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Bad news? You just freed Maxim
dialog: Horvath, one of the deadliest -
dialog: sorcerers in history...
text: Dave stares in shock as Balthazar vaults the rail and grabs a
text: large, ancient tome off the shelf -- THE ENCANTUS.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Good news? Only a sorcerer could
dialog: open that doll. In other words --
text: Balthazar hands the book to Dave, who buckles under its
text: weight. Balthazar grins.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: -- I just found my new apprentice.
text: Dave stares in horror, unable to imagine worse news than that.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: (off the Encantus)
dialog: Your homework. Learn it.
dialog: 9.
text: WHAM!!! AN INVISIBLE FORCE ripples through the air, knocks
text: Balthazar into the wall, cratering it. A CONCUSSION BLAST.
speaker_heading: MAXIM HORVATH
dialog: Sorry, Blake. Kid's taking an
dialog: incomplete on this one.
text: Horvath comes at Dave, who drops the book. Suddenly Horvath's
text: eyes light up -- the NESTING DOLL lies in his path. [AN EVIL
text: CHINESE SORCERER is depicted on the next outermost doll.]
text: Horvath sees it. Balthazar sees him see it.
speaker_heading: ’
speaker_heading: MAXIM HORVATH
dialog: The Grimhold!
text: Balthazar and Horvath leap through the air. Balthazar gets
text: there first, spins out of the way as Horvath SMASHES into a
text: display. Balthazar hands the doll to a terrified Dave.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Whatever you do, keep this
dialog: safe...NOW GET OUT OF HERE!!!
text: A FAST AND FURIOUS BRAWL erupts in the shop -- and Dave is
text: caught in the middle! As he ducks for cover we catch FLEETING
text: GLIMPSES of PLASMA BOLTS and ANTIQUES large and small flying
text: across the room. Dave is panicked.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: This isn't happening...
text: Dave blindly, reflexively throws his RING HAND out --
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: GO AWAY!!!
text: THOOM! A SPHERE OF LIGHT rocks the shop, sends Dave flying
text: into the wall.
text: When Dave finally opens his eyes, he's standing --
scene_heading: EXT. ARCANA CABANA - CONTINUOUS
text: Dave GASPS, drops the NESTING DOLL to the sidewalk.
speaker_heading: MS. ALGAR (0.S.)
dialog: Young man, where have you been?!
text: Dave turns to see Ms. Algar and his class standing there. He
text: looks back at the shop, trembling. Ms. Algar decides to have
text: a look, but as she heads for the door --
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Nott!
text: Dave nearly tackles her. He is SCREAMING, out-of-his-mind
text: scared, unsettling the class but especially Becky.
speaker_heading: MS. ALGAR
dialog: Dave, what's the matter with you?!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You don't know what's in there!!!
text: Ms. Algar brushes him aside, grabs the doorknob and pulls it
dialog: open, TO REVEAL --
text: The shop is still and silent and exactly as Dave found it.
text: Dave can't believe it. His classmates look at him as if he
text: were nuts. Suddenly he sees something on a shelf --
text: THE LIDDED URN -- that Balthazar warned him about, now with
text: two new souls depicted on its painted hellscape -- BALTHAZAR
text: AND HORVATH.
text: Dave gasps, turns and runs. As Becky and the others watch
text: him take off down the street...
text: THE NESTING DOLL -- is snatched up by a HOMELESS MAN, who
text: smiles as he tucks it in his ratty coat.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS
text: POLICE SIRENS echo as Dave huddles against a wall, pulls on
dialog: the ring as hard as he can --
text: IT COMES OFF! Dave runs, tosses the ring in a DUMPSTER.
scene_heading: QUICK-CUT MONTAGE:
text: - Dave runs up the steps to his modest Brooklyn house...

dialog: 
dialog: 11.
scene_heading: INT. DAVE'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Dave sleeps fitfully, opens his eyes to see --
text: THE RING -- is lying on his pillow, whole again. The DRAGON'S

text: Dave stares at the ring with fear and foreboding, as we —-
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DAVE'S ROOM - MORNING
text: Dave sleeps with a pillow over his head. ARCADE FIRE'S "WAKE
text: UP" suddenly blares on the alarm as Dave groggily tosses the
dialog: pillow aside, TO REVEAL --
text: 20-YEAR OLD DAVE. He sighs, hits the alarm. . Another day.
text: QUICK CUTS -- Dave throws on a faded t-shirt, black hoodie,

text: actually inconspicuously handsome.
text: ON HIS WALLS -- NIKOLA TESLA and ALBERT EINSTEIN take their
text: place alongside GOLDFRAPP, THE RACONTEURS, BUDDY HOLLY.

text: Dave cradles the phone as he: fishes a chunk of pop-tart from
text: a glass of strawberry Quik.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Of course I'm eating healthy, Mom.

text: STORM FRONT is converging on New York.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN (MOVING) - DAY
text: Dave scribbles PHYSICS EQUATIONS in a notebook, his backpack
text: sitting on his lap. The car has few RIDERS.
text: A STREET THUG -- suddenly appears in the aisle, lifts his

speaker_heading: STREET THUG
dialog: All right, listen up! Gimme your
dialog: cash and you won't get hurt!
dialog: 12.
text: The thug moves up the aisle, grabbing cash from shaken RIDERS.
text: The ELDERLY LADY next to Dave is terrified. So is Dave.
speaker_heading: STREET THUG
dialog: Gimme the ring, grandma!
text: The elderly lady gives up her wedding ring as Dave digs in his
text: pockets, pulls out a few bills -- AND THE DRAGON RING. His
text: surprise lasts about a half-second.
speaker_heading: STREET THUG
dialog: Hand it over!
text: Dave looks up, sees the thug eyeing his ring.
speaker_heading: . DAVE
dialog: Oh, believe me, you don't want to --

text: DAVE'S RING -- flies out of the thug's hand. WE ROLL WITH
text: THE RING, all the way down the platform, until it finally
text: comes to a stop.....
dialog: 13.
text: Right between Dave's feet. He picks up the ring, sighs as he
text: drops it in his pocket. The elderly lady's ring has landed

speaker_heading: . DAVE
dialog: You have a wonderful day.

text: A GORGEOUS GIRL (20) comes running out, getting drenched.
text: She runs under Dave's umbrella, catching him off guard.
speaker_heading: DAVE

scene_heading: INT. CITY IMPOUND — DAY

speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: Okay, folks, next up...this junk.
text: THE ARTIFACTS FROM BALTHAZAR'S SHOP -- are arrayed on long

speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER

speaker_heading: RICH WOMAN
dialog: That would make a lovely planter
dialog: for the foyer.
text: The husband rolls his eyes, buries his head in the paper.
scene_heading: INT. COLLEGE RADIO STATION - DAY
text: Becky and Dave sit in the small, dark D.J. BOOTH of WNYU, its
text: walls covered with eclectic album covers from JOHN COLTRANE to

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I can't believe you're Dr. Vinyl.
dialog: I listen to you all the time...
text: Dave trails off as he sees Becky with her eyes closed,
text: listening in a state of near rapture. Dave looks on, falling
dialog: in love with her all over again...
text: Becky opens her eyes, watches the L.P. spinning, smiles at the
text: walls of music that surround her.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: If somebody told me I had an hour
dialog: left to live, this is how I'd want
dialog: to spend it, right here.
text: Suddenly the MUSIC GOES DEAD and the LIGHTS GO OUT.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: Only I'd pay the power bill.
text: The lights flicker, come back on. Still no audio. Becky's
text: producer, the too-cool ANDRE (24), pokes his head in.
speaker_heading: ANDRE
dialog: Something's up with the antenna and
text: the engineer's out sick.
text: Becky slumps in her chair. Doing this show is her world.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Where's he keep his equipment?
scene_heading: INT. TRANSMITTER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh, sorry. It's a device that

speaker_heading: MAXIM HORVATH
dialog: Boo.
speaker_heading: DAVE
speaker_heading: YAAAABAAAAI! IL

speaker_heading: MAXIM HORVATH

speaker_heading: DAVE

speaker_heading: DAVE

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: See?!
speaker_heading: HORVATH
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: That is unfortunate.

text: out. Dave SCREAMS...
text: ---and catches a TINY, CUDDLY KITTEN in his arms. The kitten

text: Now on the roof, Horvath looks up in shock --
text: WHAM! A STEEL WING slams into him, sends him flying.
dialog: On
dialog: 24.
text: Dave cowers as the giant eagle lands almost right on top of
dialog: him. And just when things couldn't get any scarier...
text: BALTHAZAR BLAKE -- pokes his head out from atop the eagle.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: How's it goin'?
text: Dave SCREAMS. Balthazar sees Horvath leap into the air,
text: cocking his ring hand back to throw a spell. Balthazar
text: quickly throws his hand up and --
text: A TEMPORAL DISPLACEMENT SPELL -- wraps around Horvath, a
text: cocoon in which TIME ITSELF SLOWS TO A CRAWL. Horvath arcs

text: Dave turns to see Balthazar glaring down at him.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Where's the doll?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Please don't hurt me!
text: Balthazar shakes his head. Horvath's ring hand is coming

speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: All right, get on the eagle.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: But I --
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Get on the eagle, Dave!
speaker_heading: DAVE

speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh god.

dialog: 
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. FLYING OVER NEW YORK - NIGHT
text: It's 3 a.m. on the OLD CLOCK TOWER BUILDING as the eagle
text: soars over the fog-enshrouded city, a hundred sparkling

text: The eagle circles the CHRYSLER BUILDING, touches down on its
text: former perch. As Balthazar and Dave climb off onto the

text: A gleam in the great bird's eye, then once again it's a
scene_heading: LIFELESS GARGOYLE.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: A man named Denethor Maltwood first
dialog: brought this eagle to life in 1928.
dialog: It's helped more than one sorcerer

dialog: (off Dave's awe)
dialog: This city is full of magic, if you
dialog: know where to look. .
text: Dave looks out on the lights of New York as if seeing the
text: city for the first time.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Horvath must've put a tracking spell
dialog: on you, that day in my shop.
text: Balthazar splays his hands, his GREEN DIAMOND RING taking on
text: a strange glow. Balthazar sees Dave staring at his ring.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
text: A sorcerer's ring is a conduit for
text: his magic, but it also possesses a
dialog: magic of its own. Getting a hold
dialog: of your ring would make Horvath
dialog: that much stronger.
text: A SHIMMERING AURA washes over Dave, then disappears.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Cloaking spell. It'll throw him
dialog: off our trail.
text: Dave shakes his head, can't believe this is happening...again.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Look, I know you were shocked to

dialog: 
text: Balthazar sends a CONCUSSION BLAST flying in on Dave --

text: Balthazar can't believe it.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Are you kidding me?! What have you
dialog: been doing for the last ten years?!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (trying to breathe)
dialog: +--I'm okay...
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Didn't you read the book I gave you?!
text: Dave gets to his feet, shakes his head.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I left it in the shop.
dialog: (off Balthazar's glare)
dialog: You know, in the confusion.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Oh, absolutely, Dave! I'm sure the
dialog: situation was very confusing!!!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Well, I don't think sarcasm is
dialog: really called for! I was ten years
dialog: old, I was freaking out! I'm
dialog: still freaking out! Maybe it would
dialog: help if you told me WHAT THE HELL
dialog: IS GOING ON!!!
dialog: 
text: Balthazar shakes his head, reaches into his coat.
dialog: bets.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Pay attention, there will be a quiz
dialog: later.
dialog: (off Dave's look)
dialog: No, seriously, there will be.
text: Balthazar throws a handful of BLUE DUST that ignites the air
text: with a VOOSHHH!
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: There are two kinds of sorcerers
dialog: in the world. You and I are
dialog: Merlineans. We can trace our
dialog: lineage from sorcerer to apprentice,
dialog: all the way back to Merlin
dialog: Ambrosius...
text: The ignited dust lingers in the air like a nebula, assumes
text: the shape of MERLIN, ancient and wise in a druidic robe.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Then there's the Morganians...
text: A flick of RED DUST sparks another explosion -- and a spectral
text: image of the treacherously beautiful MORGANA LE FAY.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
text: +-.their line runs back to Morgana
dialog: le Fay, an evil sorceress who was
dialog: King Arthur's half-sister and
text: Merlin's arch-enemy.
speaker_heading: : DAVE
dialog: But -- that stuff's just a myth.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: You just rode into town on a
dialog: gargoyle, Dave. Think it's time to
dialog: put the ol' skepticism in check?
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Now, every sorcerer has a duty to
dialog: pass his knowledge on to his
dialog: apprentice before he dies. Our pal
dialog: Horvath back there was apprenticed
dialog: to my old Master, a Merlinean by the
dialog: name of Aurelius Flood.
text: A SEPULCHRAL IMAGE flits across the facade of the Chrysler
text: tower -- AURELIUS FLOOD is an old man in a Victorian overcoat.
dialog: We've seen that face before: the photos in Balthazar's shop.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
text: But Horvath turned traitor, joined
text: a group of Morganians who wiped out
dialog: almost every living Merlinean.
dialog: They killed Aurelius while trying
dialog: to steal an artifact of unspeakable
dialog: power: the Grimhold.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: That nesting doll...but what's
dialog: inside?
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: An evil so powerful, it's all
dialog: Horvath needs to kill the last two
text: Merlineans on the face of the Earth.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (re: the two of them)
dialog: You mean...?
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: For eons we kept the Morganians in
dialog: check. Now it's just you and me --
dialog: and if we don't find that doll
text: before Horvath does, a world where
dialog: the vilest kind of sorcery has free
dialog: reign over mankind. Unfortunately,
dialog: your training's gonna be kind of an
dialog: on-the-job deal --
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Whoa, whoa, "training?" Look, I've
dialog: got a life. I'm trying to graduate!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: "Graduate?" Excuse. me, did you
dialog: hear a word I just said?!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I'm not a sorcerer, okay?!
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Maxim Horvath thinks you are. And
dialog: I'm sorry, Dave, but that's ail that
text: matters. I'm looking at a dead man.
text: Dave swallows hard.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: So, you have two choices. You can
dialog: go back to your life and have the
dialog: highest GPA in the morgue.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR (CONT'D)
dialog: Or you can let me teach you how not

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: This is crazy. . You see that,

text: Balthazar shakes his head, smiles.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Good luck.
text: Balthazar turns, starts to walk off.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Wait!
dialog: (Balthazar turns)
dialog: It's just...I'm scared.
text: Balthazar looks Dave in the eye, offers his hand.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Then you just might be good at
dialog: this.
text: Dave is pale as he raises his hand to shakes Balthazar's.

speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: She missed me.
speaker_heading: YOUNG COP
dialog: How...how'd that thing...?

speaker_heading: YOUNG COP

speaker_heading: DAVE

dialog: My god...what happened here?
text: A POTTERY BARN -- stands where the Arcana Cabana once did.
text: YOUNG MOTHERS go in and out pushing strollers.
text: Balthazar looks down from the sign to see Dave at the store
text: window, smiling and pointing at a POTPOURRI SAMPLER.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Say goodbye to your musty smell!
text: Balthazar stalks over, glaring.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Are you through re-decorating,
dialog: Dave? ‘Cause if you are, we should
dialog: prob'ly --
speaker_heading: BECKY (0.S.)
dialog: Dave?
dialog: 34.
text: Dave and Balthazar turn around to see Becky standing there,
text: on her way to class, looking surprised.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: Wow, I don't see you for ten years
dialog: and then it's twice in two days.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (nervous grin)
dialog: Some coincidence, huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: If you believe in such things.
text: Balthazar puts his arm around Dave, loudly CLEARS HIS THROAT.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh, uh, Becky, this is, uhhh...
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Uncle Balthazar! Nice to meet you,
dialog: Becky. I'm just in town visiting
dialog: my faaaavorite nephew.
text: Balthazar grins, gives Dave's shoulder an extra-hard squeeze.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: Cool. Where are you from?
text: Beat. Balthazar stares at Becky in all his satanic glory.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Wichita.
text: Becky smiles, nods, unsure what to make of that. Finally --
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: So, thanks again for bailing me out
dialog: last night.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Hey, no problem...
dialog: (watching Becky)
dialog: Say, if you're not busy sometime --
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Actually, Dave, we're busy all week.
dialog: (off Dave's glare)
dialog: Remember? Uncle Maxim is in town?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh, yeah...Uncle Maxim.
dialog: (smiles at Becky)
dialog: Never mind.
dialog: 35.
text: Becky smiles. What a couple of oddballs.
speaker_heading: ‘BECKY
dialog: Okay, well, see you around, Dave.
dialog: Nice meeting you, Balthazar.
text: Balthazar gives a little wave as Becky walks off. Dave
text: sighs, watching Becky go, as Balthazar realizes:
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: She was the one. That day in the
dialog: shop, "a gift for someone special."
dialog: And you've never had the guts to
dialog: tell her.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yeah, well, bad things happened the
dialog: last time I tried.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: So you turned your back on love and
dialog: sorcery, and buried yourself in
dialog: those books of yours.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I'm still alive, aren't I?
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Yep.
text: Balthazar heads for the Bentley, leans in to Dave:
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
text: And still alone.
text: Dave stands there for a beat, thinking about what Balthazar
text: said. Dave makes a decision, gets in the car.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I know a place we can train.
scene_heading: EXT. NYU - OLD SCIENCE BUILDING - DAY
text: A building made obsolete by the new science building next
text: door. Dave leads Balthazar down some steps to a subterranean
dialog: entrance.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: So why do they let you use this
dialog: storage area for your project?
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: It's not so much "let" as "require."
dialog: My project's kind of dangerous.
dialog: Actually, it's really dangerous.
scene_heading: INT. OLD SCIENCE BUILDING —- CORRIDOR ~- CONTINUOUS
text: Dave leads Balthazar down a decrepit hallway, unlocks a door
text: marked "NYU PHYSICAL SCIENCES DEPT."
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Balthazar walks in, looks around, smiles.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: It's perfect.
text: ' THE UNDERGROUND ROOM -- is big, 150' x 75', with a high
text: ceiling and a row of opaque windows along the tops of the
dialog: walls to let in light.
scene_heading: ALL MANNER OF EQUIPMENT -- is here: ANTENNAS, TRANSFORMERS,
scene_heading: PHOTO-ELECTRIC DIODES, and most curious of all --
text: TWO STEEL COLUMNS -- set 20 feet apart, each topped by an odd-
text: looking DISC. As we'll find out later, these are TESLA COILS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: My project's on --
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Transducers.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Yeah...how'd you know?
text: Balthazar turns around, smiles.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Lucky guess.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Balthazar digs through his various pockets.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: First we need a spellbook. Since
dialog: you lost the one I gave you, we'll
dialog: have to use mine. Ah, here it is.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 37.
text: From his coat Balthazar pulls a TINY BOOK, not much bigger
text: than a matchbook. Dave grins.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Uhbh...I seem to remember it being
dialog: a little bigger.
text: Balthazar starts to UNFOLD THE BOOK. He keeps unfolding it as
text: Dave looks on with more and more surprise, until finally...
dialog: 
text: THUNNK! Balthazar drops a MASSIVE TOME on a table: THE
scene_heading: ENCANTUS. (Below the title in Gothic text: "POCKET EDITION.")
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: The Encantus is your textbook --
dialog: not just the art and science of
dialog: sorcery, but its history, too. A
dialog: history that's still being written.
text: Balthazar turns to the last page, a picture of Balthazar and
text: Horvath doing battle on Dave's roof.
text: Dave stares at himself, amazed. Balthazar flips back a few
text: pages, to a rendering of THE GRIMHOLD.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Time for your first lesson.
text: Balthazar steps to the OPEN FLOORSPACE in the middle of the
text: room. He raises his hands, throws them violently down --
text: VOOOOSHHH! Dave jumps back as a PHOSPHORESCENT FLAME shoots
text: up from the concrete floor, then dwindles, TO REVEAL...
text: A_LARGE CIRCLE -- 30' in diameter, has been scorched into the
text: floor. The circle is adorned with ALCHEMICAL SYMBOLS and
text: divided into SEVEN AREAS in an arcane geometric pattern. We
dialog: can tell we're looking at something ancient.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: This is a Merlin's Circle, the
dialog: crucible in which hundreds of
dialog: sorcerers have been made -- and
text: hundreds more broken. An
dialog: apprentice might spend ten years
dialog: training in this circle. You're
dialog: gonna do it in a week.
dialog: (steps into the circle)
dialog: You step into this circle, you
dialog: leave everything else outside --
dialog: everything you know, everything
dialog: you've seen, everything you are.
dialog: And once you enter...there's no
dialog: going back.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 38.
text: Balthazar lets that solemn thought hang there.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: So I should prob'ly pee now, then.
text: Beat. Balthazar glares at Dave.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I can hold it.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: The circle has seven domains, each
dialog: corresponding to one of the seven
dialog: arts a sorcerer is called upon to
dialog: master. There's the Alchemy of
dialog: the Mind...
text: Dave gasps as Balthazar's lips stop moving but his voice
text: continues in Dave's head:
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR (TELEPATHIC)
dialog: ++.the domain of telepathy, second
dialog: sight and psychic attack. The
dialog: Alchemy of the Elements...
text: Balthazar steps into the next domain and a TONGUE OF FIRE
text: ignites on his palm.. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING makes Dave flinch.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: +--here you'll learn to manipulate
text: fire and water, wind and earth.
dialog: (steps one over)
dialog: The Alchemy of Motion is one of my
dialog: favorites. Levitation, telekinesis,
dialog: compressing air molecules to create
dialog: a concussion effect...
text: Balthazar LEVITATES a foot off the ground, throws a rippling
text: CONCUSSION BLAST to knock a heavy GENERATOR off a table.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: The Alchemy of Transformation...
text: Dave stares wide-eyed as Balthazar suddenly MORPHS INTO DAVE.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: «--pretty self-explanatory.
text: Balthazar reverts to form, steps into the next domain.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: The last two are the most difficult
dialog: to learn, and the most powerful.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: Aree
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR (CONT'D)
dialog: The Alchemy of Spacetime is little
dialog: understood. Astral projection,
dialog: temporal displacement...
text: Balthazar takes some change from his pocket, throws it up in
text: the air. The coins start to fall in SLOW MOTION.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: It took me 10 years to learn how to
dialog: cast a "speed bump" like the one I
dialog: put on Horvath. It's said that only
dialog: Merlin himself ever fully mastered
dialog: this domain.
text: THE COINS -- hit the floor at full speed.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR .
dialog: Last is the Alchemy of Matter, and
dialog: the famous law of physics holds
dialog: true: it can be neither created nor
text: destroyed. A sorcerer just happens
dialog: to know where the loopholes are.
text: Balthazar holds out his palm and a SWIRL OF WHITE-HOT
text: ELECTRONS appears over his hand.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: If, for instance, I accelerate
dialog: these oxygen atoms, then let a few
text: electrons spin off...
text: As a few ELECTRONS escape orbit, the SWIRL COHERES into a
scene_heading: DENSE SPHERE OF HYPER-CHARGED MATTER -- A_PLASMA BOLT.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (staring in awe)
dialog: Plasma...the fourth state of
dialog: matter.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: And the sorcerer's weapon of choice.
text: Balthazar throws the PLASMA BOLT at the GENERATOR that his
text: concussion blast already toppled over. The bolt ANNIHILATES
text: the machine into so many shards of metal.
text: Dave is blown away, then realizes:
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You forgot the one in the middle.
text: Balthazar turns to the domain in the center of the circle.
text: An almost imperceptible flash of regret in his eyes, then:
dialog: 
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: The Alchemy of the Heart is the
dialog: domain of emotions, love.
dialog: (dismissive)
dialog: We won't be sending Horvath any
dialog: valentines. Now, here's how we're
dialog: gonna find that doll.
scene_heading: INT. HORVATH'S PENTHOUSE - DAY
text: Horvath stands at the end of a long table stacked with
text: ALCHEMICAL TEXTS. His ENCANTUS is open to a medieval
text: rendering of the GRIMHOLD. He touches the GRIMHOLD, and as
text: his eyes roll back in his head, we —-
scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND TRAINING ROOM - DAY
text: Balthazar stands over a table with the Encantus open.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: It's called sympathetic magic. By
dialog: manipulating this image of the
dialog: Grimhold, we exert magic on the
text: doll itself, retracing where it's
dialog: been since that day in my shop.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: And how do we do that?
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: (isn't it obvious?)
dialog: We just covered this. Spacetime,
text: Dave. Astral projection.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: “Astral projection?" What, like
dialog: our bodies stay here but our minds
dialog: go flying off somewhere?
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: That's completely impossible under
dialog: the laws of physics.
text: Balthazar grabs Dave's CELLPHONE off the table.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: This device converts the sound
dialog: waves created by your voice into
text: electromagnetic radio signals.
dialog: You tell me: physics or magic?
dialog: 
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: fu Thank you, I know how a cellphone
dialog: K works. It's a transducer and it's
dialog: totally within the laws of physics.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Everything we do is within the laws
dialog: of physics. You just don't know
dialog: all the laws yet.
dialog: (holds up his ring)
dialog: This is a transducer, Dave. It
dialog: converts the mental energy in the
text: sorcerer's mind into kinetic energy
dialog: in the physical world. First you
dialog: think it, then you do it.
text: As Dave looks at his ring in a whole new light...
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: You've spent your whole life
dialog: running from the magic you saw ten
dialog: years ago. Well guess what?
dialog: You're still doing this stuff. You
text: just got bumped into the slow lane.
text: Balthazar puts his hand on the picture of the GRIMHOLD.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
text: Time to get back in the fast lane.
text: Dave shakes his head, hesitates...
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Michelangelo said he never sculpted;
dialog: all he did was free the figure
dialog: buried deep inside the marble. You
dialog: have a sorcerer buried in you, Dave.
dialog: Let's let him out.
text: Dave slowly lifts his hand, puts it on the Encantus. As we
text: TRACK IN SLOWLY on his face...
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Remember, mental energy into
dialog: physical. Close your eyes and
dialog: remove every other thought from
dialog: your mind. There is only the
dialog: doll...and when you can see it in
dialog: your mind...open your eyes.
text: DAVE'S EYES -- pop open, and BOOM!
text: A TIME AND SPACE -- bend around the edges of the frame as we go
text: & zooming through a highly-stylized SPIRIT WORLD...
dialog: 
dialog: 42.
text: This is ASTRAL PROJECTION. The physical bodies of Balthazar
text: and Dave remain standing in the room as their ASTRAL BODIES
text: fly through SPACETIME.
text: - We see Dave drop the Grimhold outside the Arcana Cabana...
text: - The HOMELESS MAN picks up the doll...
text: - He sells it to a THRIFT SHOP OWNER, who sells it to a MAN,
text: who gives it to his SISTER as a birthday present...
text: - CRASH! The SISTER dies in a car wreck, the DOLL goes back
text: to her heartbroken BROTHER, who sells it to --
text: - AN OLD CHINESE WOMAN, in an herbalist's shop. As the
text: Chinese woman finally places the GRIMHOLD on a shelf, we —-
scene_heading: SMASH BACK TO:
text: Dave GASPS, pulls his hand off the book.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (out of breath)
dialog: Whoa...
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: (grins)
dialog: Physics.
scene_heading: EXT. CHINATOWN - SHOP - SUNSET
dialog: The herbalist's shop we just saw in the Astral Projection.
text: In front of the shop, a boisterous CHINESE FESTIVAL is
text: underway. FIRECRACKERS POP in the street, food carts are set
text: up on the sidewalk, Chinese MUSIC fills the air.
scene_heading: INT. SHOP - CONTINUOUS
text: The OLD CHINESE WOMAN we saw in the Astral Projection turns
text: around as the shop door opens.
speaker_heading: OLD CHINESE WOMAN
dialog: Can I help you?
text: MAXIM HORVATH -- walks up to the counter, smiles.
speaker_heading: MAXIM HORVATH
dialog: I certainly hope so.
dialog: 43.
scene_heading: EXT. CHINATOWN STREET - NIGHT
text: A 50-foot long PAPER DRAGON snakes down the street as
text: Balthazar and Dave arrive at the shop. The door is locked.
text: A sign hangs in the window: "BACK IN 10 MINUTES."
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: We'll have to wait.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I thought the fate of the world is
dialog: at stake. Can't you just use your
dialog: powers to --
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Commit breaking and entering?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No -- well, not exactly. Justa
text: little spell on the doorknob, just
dialog: a little...you_know.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: No, Dave, I don't know. Please
dialog: tell me.
dialog: (Dave goes mum)
dialog: There are limits on our powers,
dialog: okay? Some limits are physical: we
dialog: can't raise people from the dead.
dialog: We can't stop time. We can't fly.
dialog: Other limits we place on ourselves.
dialog: The Morganians will use their magic
dialog: for any selfish thing and let right
dialog: or wrong be damned. But we're
dialog: Merlineans. We respect our powers
dialog: and we respect our calling to use
dialog: them only for good. Got it?
text: Dave nods.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Good. Now come on, I haven't eaten
dialog: since the Clinton Administration.
text: MOMENTS LATER -- Dave and Balthazar lean against a building,
text: eating from take-out cartons.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: So is sorcery science, or magic?
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Yes. And when you can see those two
dialog: worlds are actually one and the
dialog: same, then you'll be a sorcerer.
dialog: 44,
text: Balthazar reaches into his carton for a BRIGHT RED PEPPER.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Try this. It's delicious.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Are you insane?
speaker_heading: : BALTHAZAR
dialog: It's not hot. Seriously, you don't
dialog: know what you're missing.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: That thing'1ll eat through my
dialog: intestines.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: I'm telling you, these aren't hot!
dialog: (then)
dialog: Aurelius had a saying: "Life shrinks
dialog: or expands in proportion to one's
dialog: courage." Well, let me tell you,
dialog: from where I'm standing, you've got
dialog: yourself a little shrinkage problem.
text: Dave looks down.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Too scared to tell Becky how you
dialog: feel --
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Okay, drop it.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: -- too scared to believe in
dialog: something you can't reduce to an
dialog: equation. Look, I can teach you
dialog: every spell there is to know, but if
dialog: you don't find some intestinal
dialog: fortitude pretty quick, Maxim
dialog: Horvath is gonna eat us for lunch.
text: Dave thinks about this. Balthazar's words have an effect.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: "Life shrinks...?"
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: "Life shrinks or expands in
dialog: proportion to one's courage."
dialog: (holds up the pepper)
dialog: So how about it?
dialog: 
dialog: 45.
text: Dave smiles, grabs the pepper and shoves the whole thing in
text: his mouth. The reaction is instantaneous:
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: AAAAAAGGHHH!I IE! !
text: Balthazar points at Dave, starts cracking up.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: I can't believe you ate that!!!
text: Dave doubles over, spits it out. Balthazar gathers himself.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Wow, that was insane...
text: Balthazar starts to walk off when Dave spins him around,
text: throws his best punch. Balthazar catches it, smiles.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Now that's more like it.
text: Balthazar walks off. Dave realizes he's just been tested,
dialog: and passed.
scene_heading: EXT. HERBALIST'S SHOP - NIGHT
text: Balthazar and Dave return to the shop to find the sign still
text: in the window and the door still locked.
text: Balthazar sighs, looks left and right...then whips out a thin
text: steel JIMMY and deftly breaks the lock. The door pops open.
text: Dave turns to Balthazar in shock.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What happened to "we only use our
dialog: powers for good?!"
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Did I use my powers?
scene_heading: INT. SHOP - CONTINUOUS
text: There's no one at the counter. Balthazar and Dave separate
text: and slowly make their way through the cluttered shop. Dave
text: explores the back of the shop, Balthazar the front, when --
speaker_heading: OLD CHINESE WOMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Did I leave that door unlocked
dialog: again?
text: Balthazar turns, smiles at the proprietor.
speaker_heading: OLD CHINESE WOMAN
dialog: ++-I was just having my tea. Can I
dialog: help you find something?
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: I'm looking for a nesting doll,
dialog: very unusual, with a Chinese
text: sorcerer on the outside.
scene_heading: . OLD CHINESE WOMAN
dialog: Ah, yes, the broken doll.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Broken?
speaker_heading: OLD CHINESE WOMAN
dialog: You pull and you pull and you can't
dialog: get it open.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: (relieved smile)
dialog: That's a good thing, ma'am.
speaker_heading: OLD CHINESE WOMAN
dialog: Wouldn't you know, I just sold that
dialog: piece an hour ago.
text: As the alarm registers on Balthazar's face...
dialog: 46.
text: AT THE BACK OF THE SHOP -- Dave has wandered to a part of the
text: shop not visible from the front. A BEADED CURTAIN obscures
text: our view into an adjoining room.
text: Dave hears a MUFFLED SOUND coming from the room.
text: aside the beaded curtain, and GASPS...
dialog: Dave pulls
text: THE OLD CHINESE WOMAN -- is suspended against the ceiling by
text: an invisible FORCE OF GRAVITY.
text: AT THE FRONT OF THE STORE --—
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: - .+.my height, about as crazy-
dialog: looking as me, maybe a little more?
speaker_heading: OLD CHINESE WOMAN
dialog: Yes, that's the man I sold it to.
dialog: Perhaps I can interest you in
dialog: something else...this ring perhaps?
text: A SKULL RING -- is on the woman's hand, red eyes
text: glowing.
dialog: 
dialog: 47.
text: Balthazar starts to move -- too late! The old woman conjures
text: a GIANT MYSTICAL CHAIN that wraps around Balthazar, lifts him
text: off his feet...SQUEEZES.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Aaghh!!!
speaker_heading: OLD CHINESE WOMAN
dialog: Oh, Blake, you are pathetic. Is
dialog: this what you were looking for?
text: The old woman produces the GRIMHOLD from her cloak. A
text: spectacular CHINESE SORCERER is depicted on the doll.
text: Balthazar strains to get free. No air in his lungs, he can't
text: even speak. The old woman shakes her head, disappointed.
speaker_heading: OLD CHINESE WOMAN
dialog: Hmm, something's not right. This
dialog: should be more -- I don't know,
dialog: painful for you.
dialog: (eyes light up)
dialog: I know!
text: Before our eyes the old woman TRANSFORMS into Balthazar's old
text: Master, wracked by pain and misery.
speaker_heading: AURELIUS FLOOD
dialog: You failed us, Balthazar. You
dialog: weren't strong enough...
text: Balthazar struggles but it's no use. Suddenly the figure
text: before him TRANSFORMS again...
text: -+-into the RAVEN-HAIRED BEAUTY we last saw in the old photos
text: in Balthazar's shop. She is gorgeous in a white dress, tears
text: streaming down her face.
scene_heading: RAVEN-HAIRED BEAUTY
dialog: Why, my love? Why didn't you save
dialog: me...?
text: Balthazar SCREAMS without voice as the MYSTICAL CHAIN
text: tightens around him. Balthazar is fading...
text: WHAM! The raven-haired beauty gets belted, falls out of
scene_heading: frame TO REVEAL -—
text: DAVE -- holding a bronze Buddha statue, looking surprised.
text: The mystical chain dissipates. Balthazar falls to his knees.
text: MAXIM HORVATH -- looks up at Dave, a cut on his brow.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: MAXIM HORVATH
dialog: Why you pathetic...little...
text: Horvath splays his hands in a spell-casting motion and --
text: THE GRIMHOLD -- starts to vibrate in mid-air, emitting « a
text: SPHERE OF PULSATING ENERGY.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Not!!
text: A BLINDING LIGHT -- seeps through the seam of the outermost
text: doll, swallowing the room. And when it fades...
text: SUN LOK -- stands there, a 7-foot tall sorcerer whose GLOWING
text: WHITE EYES have no pupils. A spectacular CHINESE DRAGON lurks
text: on his shimmering robe. ~ .
text: Horvath scoops up the Grimhold. (An ANCIENT EGYPTIAN SORCERER
text: is now depicted on the outermost doll.)
speaker_heading: MAXIM HORVATH
dialog: You've met Sun Lok, haven't you,
dialog: Blake? Oh, right, you're the one
dialog: who put him in the Grimhold in the
dialog: first place!
text: Sun Lok GROWLS menacingly.
speaker_heading: MAXIM HORVATH
dialog: Awk-waaaard.
scene_heading: EXT. SHOP - CONTINUOUS
text: CRAAAASHH!!! Balthazar and Dave go flying through the store
text: window onto the sidewalk.
text: The street is lined with SPECTATORS, most of them distracted
text: by the PAPER DRAGON that's winding its way up the street.
text: SUN LOK -- steps out of the store, sees the paper dragon.
text: His RING, a Chinese alchemical symbol, begins to glow...
text: Horvath sees what Sun Lok is doing, smiles.
text: UNDER THE PAPER DRAGON -- Twenty MEN shuffle along. The last
text: one, holding the tail, falls to one knee.
speaker_heading: CHINESE MAN
dialog: This thing's getting heavy...
text: The man looks up as bright red paper morphs into SHIMMERING
text: RED SCALES. The man SCREAMS. .
dialog: 
dialog: 49.
text: WHUMMP!!! All along the line, men dive out of the way as the
dialog: paper dragon transforms into --
text: A REAL, LIVE CHINESE DRAGON! A ripple of confusion runs
dialog: through the crowd. Is this part of the show?
text: BALTHAZAR AND DAVE -- get to their feet. With a wave of his
text: hand Sun Lok sends the dragon flying after them.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Move!
dialog: 
text: Balthazar and Dave take off running as the dragon flies in
text: behind them! In front of them --
text: A LAMP POST -- suddenly teeters, falls...
text: WHAM! The lamp post lands in the street, blocking their
text: escape. Horvath grins from the sidewalk, his ring glowing.
text: THE DRAGON -- skips across the facades of buildings, shooting
text: FIREBALLS from its jaws. The crowd SCREAMS, scatters in all
dialog: directions.
text: WHOOOM! Balthazar and Dave go flying as a fiery blast rocks
text: the pavement just a few feet away.
text: A second FIREBALL detonates a PARKED CAR. The horrified
text: OWNER looks on from several yards away.
speaker_heading: MAXIM HORVATH
dialog: I'm sure you're well covered.
dialog: (whips out his card)
dialog: But just in case.
text: DOWN THE STREET -~- The dragon on Sun Lok's robe flits across
text: his body as he steers the LIVING DRAGON with his ring.
text: Horvath looks on, smiles. He grabs a bag of POPCORN from a
text: terrified, fleeing KID, pops a couple of pieces in his mouth.
text: Balthazar and Dave stand in the street as the dragon makes a
text: big, arcing turn in the sky, and starts to come around.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: It's all you.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What?! No, don't do this!
text: The dragon SHRIEKS, flying in low and fast, 250 yards away.
dialog: 
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Sympathetic magic, Dave. I believe
dialog: we covered it?
text: Balthazar grabs Dave's chin, points it toward Sun Lok. Dave

speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR

dialog: Clear your mind.
text: THE DRAGON -- zeroes in on them, flames trailing from its maw.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Clear my mind?! Are you KIDDING?!
text: Desperate, Dave closes his eyes, concentrates. They have 10

text: Dave opens his eyes, throws his hand toward Sun Lok.
speaker_heading: DAVE
speaker_heading: FIRE!
text: Sun Lok SCREAMS as the dragon on his robe IGNITES!
text: FLYING OVERHEAD -- The dragon's tail erupts in flames! The

text: ON THE STREET -- Sun Lok panics, tries to pat the flames out.
text: Horvath drops his popcorn.
text: The flames spread across Sun Lok's robe. Horvath sees a FIRE

dialog: RIPS OFF the hydrant and --
text: FOOOSSHHH!!! A JET OF WATER shoots out, extinguishing the
text: flames on Sun Lok's robe.
speaker_heading: MAXIM HORVATH
dialog: I can see I'm going to have to do

text: Horvath and Sun Lok hear a sudden WHOOSH, look up to see --

text: The huge dragon is only 10 feet above them, and spiralling
dialog: down in flames --
text: KA-BOOM!!! A fiery EXPLOSION rocks the street. Sun Lok is

text: side of a FedEx truck.
text: THE GRIMHOLD ~-- flies out of his hand, tumbles across the
text: pavement where it finally comes to a stop...right in front of
dialog: Balthazar and Dave.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I did it...I did it!
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Calm down.
text: Balthazar picks up the doll as Horvath gets to his feet some

text: A DOZEN POLICE CARS -- come screaming around the corner, with
text: several NEWS TRUCKS just behind them.
text: Balthazar and Horvath exchange a stare, then a nod. They
dialog: both know this isn't over.
text: Horvath step back into an alley, VANISHES INTO THE SHADOWS...
text: Dave sighs, relieved as the police cars approach.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR (0.S.)
dialog: How do I- look?
text: Dave turns, shocked to see BALTHAZAR AS A NEW YORK COP, down
text: to the last detail of the NYPD uniform.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: I'll do the talking, Officer Dave.
text: Dave looks down. He's in a cop uniform, too.
text: The cars screech to a halt. Suddenly COPS are everywhere,

dialog: S'okay, fellas, situation's under

text: A POLICE CAPTAIN runs up to Officers Balthazar and Dave.
speaker_heading: POLICE CAPTAIN

speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Fireworks accident. They were

speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Pipe down, rookie!

dialog: See for yourself, Cap.

speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR

dialog: 
text: Balthazar plunks the GRIMHOLD down on the hood.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Alcatraz.
dialog: (off Dave's surprise)
text: A prison for evil sorcerers. Every
dialog: layer holds a different Morganian,
dialog: each one worse than the one before.
dialog: And in the innermost doll -- the
dialog: spirit of Morgana le Fay, trapped
dialog: there by Merlin himself after her
text: physical body was destroyed.
text: A SPECTRAL IMAGE of MORGANA LE FAY -- is reflected in the
text: car's windshield. A savage, staggeringly powerful creature.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: If Morgana gets out, we're dead.
text: The sun will set on the Merlinean

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: But we have the doll.
dialog:

speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: For now. But as long as Horvath's

speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR

speaker_heading: DAVE

speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Make sure you ask Horvath for five

text: across the floor.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Come on, that was a low-rez bolt.
dialog: You think Horvath's gonna take it
dialog: that easy on you?
text: Balthazar throws another BOLT. Dave just gets his shield up
dialog: to half-ass block it.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Better.
scene_heading: MERLIN'S CIRCLE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Dave levitates a foot off the ground over and over again.

speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR

text: OUTSIDE THE OLD SCIENCE BUILDING — DAY
text: Balthazar walks around the Bentley, meticulously wiping

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Look, I've missed three classes
dialog: this week. One more and I fail my
dialog: physics lab -- not good for a

text: Balthazar says nothing, keeps wiping the hood.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Come on, the Grimhold's safe,
text: Horvath hasn't shown his face in

dialog: gotta have a life!
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR

scene_heading: INT. PHYSICS LAB - DAY
text: Class is in progress as Dave sneaks in the back door and

speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: Dude, where've you been the last

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Sorry, it's...complicated.
text: PROFESSOR HELLMAN (50) approaches, his superiority complex
text: oozing out from behind the glasses at the end of his nose.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR HELLMAN
dialog: Glad you decided to join us, Dave.
dialog: You're up, Mr. Chin.
scene_heading: MOMENTS LATER -- A LARGE RECTANGULAR PAN sits on a platform at
text: the front of the room. Ken hoists a heavy black CERAMIC DISC
text: into the pan as Dave and the others look on.
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: I place the metallic oxide plate
dialog: into the pan...
text: Ken grabs a LARGE CANNISTER marked "LN2."
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: +-.then pour liquid nitrogen over
dialog: the plate.
text: FOOSH!!! The smoking frozen liquid is poured into the pan
text: and almost immediately hits a HIGH BOIL.
speaker_heading: KEN.
text: The frozen liquid boils as it
text: absorbs heat from the plate. When
text: the boiling stops, the plate has
dialog: hit the superconducting critical
dialog: temperature.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR HELLMAN
dialog: Which is?
text: Ken swallows hard, can't remember.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: 91 Kelvin.
dialog: 
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR HELLMAN
dialog: (reels on Dave)
dialog: Thank you, Ken!
text: The boiling has stopped. The plate sits in the smoking pan.
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: A moment ago the plate had no
dialog: magnetic properties. But now that
dialog: it's acquired superconductor status,
dialog: I can take this magnetic disc...
text: Ken hoists a HEAVY METAL DISC that's the size of a discus but
text: 6" thick. He holds it over the plate.
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: ---and a magnetic field will cause
text: the disc to hover, simultaneously
text: repelled and attracted by the super-
dialog: conductor -- a phenomenon known as
dialog: magnetic levitation.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR HELLMAN
dialog: Unless, of course, your math is
dialog: sloppy and you've made the mass of
dialog: the disc too great. Then it'll
text: drop like a stone.
text: Hellman pompously holds up Ken's proof sheet.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR HELLMAN
dialog: Don't bother, Mr. Chin. The
dialog: magnetic field won't be strong
dialog: enough to overcome gravity.
text: Dave catches Ken's eye, nods for him to let go of the disc.
text: Ken shakes his head, embarrassed enough already.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR HELLMAN
dialog: You remember gravity, don't you?
dialog: It's what some of us quaintly refer
dialog: to as a physical law.
text: The students LAUGH. Dave nods at Ken again, insistent.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR HELLMAN
dialog: As it turns out, Mr. Chin, they're
dialog: called "laws" for a reason -~
text: Ken lets go of the disc. Hellman GASPS, TO REVEAL -—-

speaker_heading: PROFESSOR HELLMAN
dialog: I...it...but...

speaker_heading: MAXIM HORVATH
dialog: Idiot.
text: Horvath shakes his hand, causing the DREAMSCAPE to ripple

speaker_heading: MAXIM HORVATH
dialog: Not all of the tracks we leave

text: Dave walks in, looks around.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Balthazar? Hello?
text: Dave sees a note on the wall: "SHOPPING FOR YOUR LAST MEAL -

text: After two days of sorcerer training the room is a shambles:
text: SCIENTIFIC EQUIPMENT is strewn about the SCORCH-MARKED FLOOR;
text: Balthazar's TAKE OUT CARTONS are everywhere.
dialog: 62.
text: Dave looks at the clock; it's already 6:50. There's not

text: MOMENTS LATER -- The unforgettable DUM-DE-DUM theme of "The

text: Dave smiles, looking confident. Too confident.
text: Suddenly the MOP veers off course, nearly hits Dave before it
text: crashes into a shelf, toppling BEAKERS.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Hey...hey, stop!
text: THE MOP -~ stops abruptly, prompting a grin from Dave...
text: A grin that quickly fades as the MOP flips over and
text: TRANSFORMS: splintered wooden arms, notched eyes, cloth
text: tendrils writhing like Medusa.
text: Dave takes a step back --
text: TOO LATE! The mop flies through the air like a javelin,
text: IMPALES ITSELF in the plaster wall just inches from his head.
text: That nearly killed him. Dave thinks fast, pulls the mop out
text: of the wall and SNAPS it over his knee, tossing the halves in
dialog: separate directions.
text: THE VACUUM CLEANER -- makes a sharp turn, clips Dave's ankle.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Owwwl!l!
text: Dave goes down -- luckily, because if he'd been standing,

dialog: 
dialog:

text: The room is a CHAOTIC SWIRL OF SORCERY as Dave has let the

text: the shelves like mad, sentient MOLOTOV COCKTAILS.
text: BOOM!!! Dave dives for cover, hits the floor hard. When he

speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: Dave?, Is everything --

speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: Oh my god...

text: ACROSS THE ROOM -- For some reason Becky isn't being attacked.
text: She eyes Dave and THE RING, starts walking toward him when she

text: Dave is on his knees, flailing as the MOP DEMONS pummel him

dialog: difficult one. I'11 get started on
dialog: it...you greet our friends.
text: Menmet-Ra nods.
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT
text: We CRANE DOWN -- CLEOPATRA'S NEEDLE, a massive obelisk pocked
text: with EGYPTIAN GLYPHS. We're in a dark, isolated grove of
text: trees, far from any path or sidewalk.
text: Balthazar and Dave sprint past the obelisk toward the looming
text: shadow of the Sherry-Netherland and Horvath's tower.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: I'll take Horvath, you go for the
dialog: doll. Hopefully he hasn't freed
dialog: the next Morganian yet...
text: BEHIND THEM -- One of the GLYPHS steps free from the obelisk,
text: lands on its feet with a WHUMP. Balthazar and Dave stop in
text: their tracks, turn slowly around to see...
text: MENMET-RA -- massive and deadly.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: ++-0r not.
speaker_heading: MENMET-RA
dialog: (re: Dave)
dialog: I'll give you one chance to save
dialog: his life. Give me Merlin's ring.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (turns to Balthazar)
dialog: What's he talking about?
text: But Balthazar's eyes are locked on Menmet-Ra.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: You know I can't do that.
text: Menmet-Ra nods. As he raises his hands toward the obelisk,
text: the COBRA'S EYES glow on his ring and --
text: TWO LARGE ANKHS -- come flying out of the side of the
text: obelisk, where a moment ago they were mere glyphs.
text: Menmet-Ra catches one ANKH in each hand, holding them by the
text: loop that sits atop each cross. He bangs the ankhs together
text: and a layer of sediment falls away, TO REVEAL --
text: TWO GLEAMING, RAZOR-SHARP BLADES. The ankhs have been
text: transformed into deadly handheld weapons.
text: Dave gulps. Balthazar nods, raises his hand...
text: A LONG OBJECT -~ blasts free from the obelisk, flies into
text: Balthazar's hand. He bangs the object on the ground, knocks
dialog: off 3,000 years of sediment, TO REVEAL --
text: A GLEAMING PHARAOH'S STAFF. Balthazar grips the staff with
text: both hands, takes a combat position.
dialog: This is gonna be good.
scene_heading: INT. HORVATH'S PENTHOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS
text: THE GRIMHOLD -- glows white-hot as Horvath bombards it with
text: MYSTICAL ENERGY. A TONGUE OF FIRE subsumes the doll as a
text: FIGURE takes shape in the light. Hulking. Monstrous. HUGE.
scene_heading: EXT. CLEOPATRA'S NEEDLE - SIMULTANEOUS
text: Menmet-Ra LEAPS INTO THE AIR, swinging the ANKH SWORDS with
dialog: murderous ferocity -- not at Balthazar, at Dave!
text: Balthazar jumps in front of Dave just in time, somehow gets
text: the staff up to block a FURIOUS ATTACK OF BLADES.
text: A_JAW-DROPPING FIGHT. SORCERY meets MARTIAL ARTS as
text: Balthazar and Menmet-Ra mix PLASMA BOLTS with scissor kicks,
text: ANTI-GRAVITY SPELLS with good ol' fashioned roundhouse
text: punches. And through it all, one thing is clear: :
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (just ducks a blade)
dialog: WHOA!!!
dialog: =
dialog: 
dialog: 69.
text: Dave is the target. Balthazar fights bravely but Menmet-Ra
text: doesn't tire. A savage blow SHATTERS Balthazar's staff, a
text: brutal BACKHAND sends him sailing.
text: Menmet-Ra turns around to face Dave --
text: And gets nailed by a CONCUSSION BLAST. Menmet-Ra staggers
text: back as Dave comes at him with the bravest face he can muster.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Come on...come on!!!
text: Dave throws a PLASMA BOLT but Menmet-Ra throws up an ANKH
text: SWORD, blocking Dave's bolt and sending it back at him.
text: WHAM! Dave flies into the base of Cleopatra's Needle and
text: crumples. He looks up to see Menmet-Ra standing over him,
text: MOONLIGHT GLEAMING along the edge of his blade.
speaker_heading: MENMET-RA
dialog: So you are the Prime Merlinean.
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: Pathetic.
text: Dave has no idea what he's talking about; he just knows he's
text: about to die.
text: TEN YARDS AWAY -- Balthazar looks up, sees what's about to
text: happen. He spots the PHARAOH'S STAFF,.sharp and jagged where
dialog: it broke.
text: Balthazar raises his hand and the staff flies into his grip.
text: He rears back, THROWS --
text: Dave SCREAMS as Menmet-Ra swings the ANKH down at his arm --
text: SHUNNKK! Dave continues to SCREAM. It takes him a good two
text: seconds to realize his arm is intact --
text: And the business end of the PHARAOH'S STAFF is sticking
text: through Menmet-Ra's chest.
text: Menmet-Ra looks down at the staff in disbelief...then falls
dialog: over dead, TO REVEAL --
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: We've got to go.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: But what about the Grimhold?!
text: Balthazar looks off toward the Sherry-Netherland, sees an
text: EERIE WHITE LIGHT glowing in the penthouse window.
dialog: 
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: We've got to go, now!
text: Balthazar grabs Dave and they run off, as we TILT DOWN TO...
text: MENMET-RA'S BODY -- turns to dust, starts to blow away in the
dialog: breeze.
text: MOMENTS LATER -- TWO BOOTS step into frame, TO REVEAL --
speaker_heading: HORVATH
dialog: (getting aggravated)
dialog: We've got one more comrade to free
dialog: before Morgana. We'll just have to
dialog: get the ring ourselves.
text: We hear a low, guttural GROWL. Behind Horvath a HULKING
text: WINGED FIGURE looms in the shadows.
scene_heading: INT. BENTLEY (DRIVING) - NIGHT
text: Balthazar speeds the Bentley downtown. Dave stares at him.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Why'd he call me the Prime
dialog: Merlinean?
text: Balthazar grips the wheel, says nothing.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: WHY?!
text: Balthazar looks at Dave, sees he won't take no for an
text: answer. Balthazar veers off the Westside Highway.
scene_heading: EXT. MANHATTAN WATERFRONT - DAWN
text: Dave and Balthazar stand beside the Bentley as the lights of
text: New Jersey glisten across the Hudson.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: I told you how every sorcerer has
dialog: an apprentice. True enough.. But
dialog: not all apprentices are created
dialog: equal. Once a generation an
dialog: apprentice comes along, the Prime
dialog: Merlinean, who can wear the most
dialog: powerful ring on Earth -- the ring
dialog: once worn by Merlin himself.
scene_heading: FLASH CUT TO:
dialog: 71.
text: ENGLAND, A THOUSAND YEARS AGO...
text: A GLEAMING BLADE is embedded in a craggy STONE. LIGHTNING
text: FLASHES reveal a dozen KNIGHTS staring in shock as TWO HANDS
text: slowly pull the SWORD from the STONE...
text: The hands belong to a BOY, not much younger than Dave. And
text: looking over the entire scene -- MERLIN.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR (V.O.)
text: The ring's band is forged from the
text: blade of Arthur's sword, Excalibur.
text: Its dragon is carved from the stone
text: from which the sword was pulled.
text: The boy looks at the ENGRAVING on the sword: "TAKE ME UP."
text: He flips the sword over: "CAST ME AWAY." ‘
scene_heading: SMASH BACK TO:
text: Dave stares in awe at the same inscription on his ring.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Your ring is quite literally the
dialog: sword and the stone. And for a
dialog: thousand years it stayed in the
dialog: Merlinean line.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (dawns on him)
dialog: Until Horvath turned traitor...
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: He was my generation's Prime
dialog: Merlinean. Aurelius died keeping
text: the ring out of his hands,
dialog: entrusting it to me until the next
dialog: Prime Merlinean could be found.
dialog: For years I searched...
scene_heading: FLASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: BALTHAZAR'S SHOP...
text: QUICK CUTS -- KIDS of all shapes and sizes stand in the shop,
text: trying on the ring. For the CHUBBY KIDS, the ring shrinks
text: down; for the SKINNY KIDS, it gets bigger.
text: THE RING DOESN'T FIT ANY OF THEM.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR (V.0.)
dialog: Until one day...
dialog: 72.
text: YOUNG DAVE walks into the shop, that day 10 years ago.
scene_heading: SMASH BACK TO:
text: Dave tries to absorb his place in this crazy, epic story.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: You alone have the power to lock
text: Horvath back in the Grimhold. And
dialog: that's not all. The doll that
dialog: holds Morgana can only be opened
dialog: with your ring. That's why they
dialog: they'll keep coming after you.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Until they kill me...
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Or you kill them. We've got one
dialog: more shot at getting them back in
dialog: that doll -- tonight. After that
dialog: they'll be too powerful.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Let me see if I have this straight.
dialog: I'm a "Prime Merlinean," the only
dialog: one in the world with the power to
dialog: keep Morgana in the Grimhold --
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Or if she's released, to put her
dialog: back in. Now I know this is more
dialog: than you signed on for --
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Uh, yeah!
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: -- but if Horvath frees Morgana from
dialog: that doll tonight, it's seriously
dialog: bad news for this city and everyone
dialog: in it. And I mean everyone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (his fear rising)
dialog: Becky...
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: We've got to be willing to lose
dialog: everything, Dave. And by
dialog: "everything," I mean --
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I know what you mean.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: So...you're ready for this?
text: Dave looks out on the lights of his childhood across the
dialog: Hudson.
text: MUSIC UP as the morning sun begins to rise over
text: New York: the faint strains of "Magic" -- Becky's song.
text: Dave turns to Balthazar.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Whatever it takes.
text: Balthazar smiles, nods. Then --
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Horvath has two more Morganians to
text: free before he gets to the last
dialog: doll. I have a feeling he's sprung
text: one of them already.
dialog: (darkly)
dialog: These are the bad guys, Dave.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What. were Sun Lok and Menmet-Ra?
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: The wannabes. The good news: each
dialog: doll is tougher to crack than the
dialog: one before. It'll take Horvath
dialog: hours to get the last one out, and
dialog: that gives us time. You go back,
dialog: grab the Encantus. I'll meet you
dialog: back here in an hour.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What are you gonna do?
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: There's someone I need to see.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You're not gonna tell me who?
dialog: What, you don't trust me?
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: You want to know how much I trust
dialog: you?
text: Balthazar can't believe he's about to do this. He holds out
text: his CAR KEYS, drops them in Dave's hand.
text: Dave grins, turns and heads for the Bentley.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: That smile's making me nervous,
dialog: Dave!
text: MOMENTS LATER -- THROOOOM!!! Dave revs the car, looking more
dialog: determined than ever.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: I've got someone to see, too.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY
text: We SWOOP down from the sky and GLIDE through traffic, then
text: veer onto the sidewalk and through a wrought-iron gate, into --
text: A GRAVEYARD ~-- nestled in the shadow of tall office towers.
text: An unexpected island of tranquil solemnity.
text: We GLIDE through the graves, many of which are centuries old,
text: finally arriving at...
text: A MARBLE HEADSTONE -- where BALTHAZAR is crouched down. ‘Two
text: GRAVESTONE CAMEOS are pictured on the stone: one is of
scene_heading: AURELIUS FLOOD...
text: The other is VERONICA. Balthazar touches his hand to her
text: oval-shaped photograph, holds it there.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Forgive me for what I have to do.
text: Balthazar rises, turns and walks off. Only now do we see the
dialog: inscriptions on the headstone:
scene_heading: AURELIUS FLOOD VERONICA FLOOD
dialog: 1925 - 1994 1967 -
text: Curiously, no end date for Veronica.
scene_heading: EXT. VINTAGE RECORD STORE - DAY
text: Dave runs up to "VINYL FEVER," an eclectic record shop, and
text: peers in the window to see Becky inside. Dave starts to go
text: in when he sees -- she's with Andre. Dave takes a breath.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Life shrinks or expands in
dialog: proportion to one's courage.
dialog: 75.
scene_heading: INT. VINYL FEVER - CONTINUOUS
text: Becky is going through the crates when she sees Dave.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Your roommate thought you'd be
dialog: here. Are you busy?
speaker_heading: ANDRE
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
text: Dave feels Andre's stare, presses on.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ‘Cause if you're not, there's
dialog: something I want to show you.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: What about your "family emergency?"
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Family --? Oh, yeah, it's all
dialog: taken care of.
text: Becky isn't buying this, or Dave, at the moment.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: Maybe some other time.
text: Becky moves on to the next crate. Dave goes after her.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Remember what you said in the radio
dialog: station, how if someone told you
dialog: you had an hour left to live, this
dialog: is how you'd want to spend it?
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: What does that have to do with --
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Well, this is how I'd want to spend
dialog: mine. Please, Becky, I said I'd
dialog: make it up to you, and.I will...1I
dialog: just need you to come with me.
text: * Becky stares at Dave; she can't help but be stirred by his
text: passion. She turns to Andre, who shakes his head, turns
text: around and walks out.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: (turns to Dave)
dialog: This better be good.
dialog: 76.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND TRAINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Dave leads Becky into the room, which is still a wreck.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: So this is where the magic happens.
dialog: Dave smiles: ‘You have no idea.’
text: Dave hurries over to the TESLA COILS we've seen mostly in b.g.
text: He wheels the 7-foot tall coils to an open space in the room,
text: spaces them about 20' feet apart.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: What are those things?
speaker_heading: DAVE
text: Tesla coils. Tesla was a physicist.
dialog: He was way ahead of his time.
text: Dave turns out the lights, leaving only the glow of a laptop
text: screen at the table where he's standing.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You're gonna wanna stand back.
text: Becky grins: 'Sounds ominous.' She backs away from the coils,
text: stands next to Dave. Dave smiles.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Enjoy the show.
text: Dave hits a key on the laptop, and -—-
text: HUGE BOLTS OF ELECTRICITY -- leap between the coils! These
text: aren't puny sparks but long tendrils of high-voltage plasma
text: that somehow, impossibly, CRACKLE WITH MUSIC: Bach's Toccata
text: and Fugue melds seamlessly into the theme to "Sanford & Son."
text: Becky laughs, SHOUTS with surprise at the incredible light
text: and music show. These coils are loud.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: Where are the speakers?!
speaker_heading: DAVE
text: There are none! The coils fire at
dialog: such a high frequency, the sparks
text: create sound waves as they move
dialog: through the air! .
text: Suddenly the tune changes again -- into BECKY'S SONG. Becky
text: shakes her head in amazement, turns to Dave, smiles.
dialog: 
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: It's "Magic."
text: Dave looks at Becky, her gorgeous smile, and he realizes:
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yeah...it is.
text: As Dave turns back to the lightshow, it's Becky's turn to
text: look at him. There's something about this guy. Something
dialog: special.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND TRAINING ROOM —- MOMENTS LATER
text: The lights are back on. As Dave talks to Becky there's a
text: newfound courage in his. eyes.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Becky, there's something I've been
dialog: wanting to tell you...
scene_heading: INT. OLD SCIENCE BLDG. — CORRIDOR —- CONTINUOUS
text: Balthazar storms through the double doors.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: What part of "see you in an hour"
dialog: wasn't clear?
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND TRAINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ++.something I've been feeling
dialog: since that day when we were kids.
text: OUT IN THE CORRIDOR -- Balthazar pulls up, tenses as he
text: listens. in. He hates himself for what he has to do next.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Becky, I think you're --
dialog: Balthazar WHISPERS something and --
scene_heading: BACK IN THE ROOM --
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: -- a total fraud.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: (smiles, thrown off)
dialog: Gee, thanks, Dave.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I'm serious! Sure, you act all
dialog: nice as long as I'm doing you a
dialog: favor, getting your little radio
dialog: show back on the air --
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: That's not true!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: -- but come on, I'm just a dork,
dialog: right? The guy with the big "D" on
dialog: his chest?!
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: That is not what I think of you!
dialog: Okay, maybe a little, at first.
dialog: But there's something about you, I
dialog: don't know what it is, but...it's
dialog: special.
text: IN THE CORRIDOR -- Balthazar feels terrible but doesn't stop:
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Why don't you just --
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: -- leave, okay?! Just go!
text: Becky stands there, hurt and in shock.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: It's not hard, Becky. You put one
text: foot in front of the other.
text: IN THE CORRIDOR -- Balthazar hides in shadow as Becky runs
text: out of the room, down the corridor and out the double-doors.
text: BACK IN THE ROOM -- Dave is still fired up when all at once
text: he becomes aware of everything he just said.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh, no...Becky, wait!!!
text: Dave starts to run after her. Balthazar blocks the door.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: It's better this way. Don't ask me
dialog: how I know. I just do.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You...you did that! Why?!
dialog: (steps back)
dialog: Don't come near me!!!
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Here you are, acting like you're my
dialog: friend --
dialog: you're a liar! What else have you
dialog: been lying to me about?!
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Dave --
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: WHAT ELSE?!
text: Dave sees the ENCANTUS on the table. He waves his hand and
text: the book FLIPS OPEN, the pages turning until we see --
text: The "LIVES OF THE SORCERERS," the entry for VERONICA FLOOD.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Sympathetic magic. I believe we
dialog: covered it?
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Dave, don't...STOP!
text: As Balthazar lunges, Dave throws his hand up and Balthazar
text: slows to 1/20th speed! SPEED BUMP.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Took you ten years to learn that,
dialog: huh?!
dialog: (points at himself)
dialog: Prime Merlinean!
text: Dave puts his hand on the book, closes his eyes and --
text: BOOM!!! Light and time bend around us in ASTRAL PROJECTION.
text: Dave is suddenly there in the --
text: ARCANA CABANA -- much as we remember it, only there's a sign
text: behind the counter: "AURELIUS FLOOD, PROPRIETOR."
text: AURELIUS FLOOD and VERONICA stand side-by-side, staring with
dialog: grave determination as --
text: BALTHAZAR -- blocks the door, stares menacingly at Aurelius
text: and Veronica. PLASMA BOLTS form around his clenched fists.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Time for you to go, old man.
text: Aurelius shakes his head, smiles.
speaker_heading: AURELIUS FLOOD
dialog: When will you Morganians ever learn?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 80.
text: WHAT??!! Dave stares in shock as --
text: Balthazar throws a PLASMA BOLT and Aurelius and Veronica take
text: to the air, conjuring BOLTS of their own. As a full-on
text: SORCERER BATTLE erupts in the shop, we --
scene_heading: SMASH BACK TO:
text: Dave rips his trembling hand from the page.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh my god...it was all a lie...
dialog: (turns to Balthazar)
dialog: Who are you?!
text: Balthazar struggles against the SUPER SLO-MO that's ensnared
dialog: him. It takes everything he's got to --
text: TEAR HIMSELF FREE! Balthazar hits the ground at full speed,
text: rolls behind a lab console to dodge the --
text: SALVO OF PLASMA BOLTS -- that Dave is throwing at him.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: WHO ARE YOU??!!
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Dave, stop! --
text: Dave isn't hearing him. Balthazar ducks for cover, touches
text: his hand to the floor and -- .
text: THE FLOOR AT DAVE'S FEET -- suddenly LIQUEFIES, turning into
text: a POOL OF WATER that Dave plunges into.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Whoa!
text: UNDERWATER -- Dave flails up toward the light when he sees
text: his WATCH MORPHING on his wrist, transforming into --
text: A STEEL SHACKLE. And at the other end of the chain:
text: A CINDERBLOCK! Dave's eyes go wide as the last bubbles of
text: air jettison from his lungs and he is dragged down toward a
text: blackness seemingly without end.
text: As Dave reaches up toward the fading light -- A HAND SNATCHES
speaker_heading: HIS WRIST.
text: Balthazar hoists Dave out of the water, throws him to the
text: floor against a lab console.
dialog: 
dialog: 81.
text: Dave COUGHS violently, catches his breath, looks up at
text: Balthazar standing over him.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I want. The truth.
dialog: Despite what just happened, there's not an ounce of concession
text: in Dave's eyes. But the truth is something Balthazar seems
text: unwilling or unable to go near.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: "Life shrinks or expands,"
dialog: remember? Well, from where I'm
dialog: standing, you've got yourself a
dialog: little shrinkage problem.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: You're sitting, you little jerk.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I need to hear it. You need to say”
dialog: it. So what happened?
text: Finally Balthazar exhales, and after years of keeping this
text: pent up inside...
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: I was a Morganian, trained in the
dialog: Dark Arts from the time I was a
dialog: boy. Fifteen years ago Horvath
dialog: sent me on a mission: to steal the
text: Grimhold...and kill Aurelius Flood.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (nods)
dialog: The battle I saw in the Encantus.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: (smiles at the memory)
dialog: Only you didn't see how it ended.
scene_heading: FLASH CUT TO:
text: THE ARCANA CABANA...
text: QUICK CUTS -- The shop is demolished. Aurelius's shoulder is
text: bleeding as he and Veronica stand over a battered, semi-
text: conscious Balthazar.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR (V.O.)
dialog: Let's just say Aurelius and Veronica
dialog: put a serious beat-down on yours
dialog: truly. They could've killed me...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 82.
text: - Balthazar lies in bed, his wrists bound to the bedposts as
text: Aurelius and Veronica bring him some breakfast.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR (V.0O.)
dialog: -.-instead they took me in, nursed
dialog: me back to health.
text: - Time has passed. Aurelius talks to Balthazar late into the
text: night, the shop illuminated by FLICKERING CANDLES.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR (V.O.)
dialog: They taught me there's no such thing
dialog: as good magic or bad. The magic
dialog: is neutral -- it's what's in a
dialog: sorcerer's heart that matters. And
dialog: when my heart began to change...
text: - Balthazar and Veronica stand behind the display case,
text: talking, smiling -- falling deeply in love.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR (V.O.)
dialog: .--let's just say my old pals
dialog: weren't so thrilled.
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
text: A REMOTE COUNTRYSIDE...
dialog: 
text: FAST, BLURRY IMPRESSIONS -- A BATTLE takes place in a driving
text: rainstorm. Balthazar, Aurelius and Veronica face off against
text: Horvath, Sun Lok, Menmet-Ra, and others who remain obscure.
text: LIGHTNING flashes as Horvath and Aurelius clash.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR (V.O.)
text: In the heat of the battle, Horvath
dialog: managed to get Merlin's ring from
text: Aurelius. For the first time in a
dialog: thousand years...
text: THE INNERMOST DOLL —-- flies open and an unforgettable sight
text: emerges -- the MONSTROUS SPECTRAL SPIRIT of Morgana le Fay!
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR (V.O.)
dialog: ---Morgana's spirit was free.
text: MORGANA'S SPIRIT expands rapidly in size and energy. Veronica
text: SCREAMS as she is caught up in this maelstrom.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR (V.O.)
dialog: I've got to hand it to Aurelius.
dialog: He moved fast, before she got too
dialog: powerful...
dialog: 
dialog: 83.
text: Aurelius lifts his hand and the DRAGON RING leaps off
text: Horvath's hand and onto Aurelius's. A wave of the old man's
text: hand rips the Grimhold open, unleashing --
text: A VORTEX OF ENERGY that encircles Morgana and the Morganians.
text: With a final surge of magic that will kill him --
text: AURELIUS THRUSTS THEM INTO THE GRIMHOLD!
text: MOMENTS LATER -- Balthazar kneels beside the dying Aurelius,
text: who places MERLIN'S RING in Balthazar's hand.
speaker_heading: DAVE (V.0.)
dialog: And Veronica...?
scene_heading: SMASH BACK TO:
text: Balthazar looks up, still feeling the pain of that moment.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: I lost her.
text: Dave can see how devastated Balthazar still is.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: As sorcerers we're supposed to lead
dialog: solitary lives, to put sorcery
dialog: before love, self -- everything. I
dialog: tried to have both, love and

dialog: carried since the day I lost her.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (realizes)
dialog: You were trying to spare me from
dialog: that, by driving Becky away.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Why is the Alchemy of the Heart in
dialog: the center of the circle?
text: Balthazar says nothing.
speaker_heading: DAVE
speaker_heading: WHY.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: For the same reason your powers
dialog: appeared on the day you fell for
dialog: Becky. Love is the most powerful
dialog: source of a sorcerer's magic. If
dialog: he can tap it, he can't be stopped,
dialog: but if he tries...he just might
dialog: lose the love of his life.
dialog: 
dialog: 84.
text: Dave thinks about this, turns to Balthazar.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Or he might win her.
text: Their eyes meet. Perhaps each man has now taught something,
dialog: and each one learned, but a glimmer of hope -- for what, we
text: can't be sure -- shines in Balthazar's eyes. He nods.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Let's go find your girl.
scene_heading: INT. MUSEUM OF MODERN ART - DAY
text: Becky walks through the museum, a 1930's Modernist structure
text: of glass and steel. She stops to gaze at a painting...
text: THE CHAGALL from their childhood. A boy and girl levitate
text: magically together in the nighttime sky.
scene_heading: FLASH CUT TO:
text: YOUNG BECKY and DAVE stand before the painting.
speaker_heading: YOUNG DAVE
dialog: Becky...
text: She turns to him, hoping he feels the way she. does.
speaker_heading: YOUNG DAVE
dialog: ++-never mind.
scene_heading: SMASH BACK TO:
text: Becky gazes at the painting, shakes her head and walks out.
text: MOMENTS LATER -- Becky meanders through a sculpture gallery
text: when a VOICE comes over the P.A.
scene_heading: P.A. ANNOUNCER
dialog: Your attention, please. The museum
dialog: will be closing in fifteen minutes.
text: Suddenly a PRETTY GIRL (12) runs up to Becky, looking anxious
text: if not terrified. Her clothes give her away as a tourist.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Can you help me? I lost my dad!
dialog: He was right next to me then all of
dialog: a sudden I couldn't find him!
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: Okay, don't worry...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 85.
text: Becky looks for a guard but there are none around. The girl
text: is on the verge of tears.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: I'm gonna help you, okay? We'll
text: find him together.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Oh, thank you!
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: He's prob'ly going crazy looking
dialog: for you. Where was the last place
dialog: you saw him?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: This way...
text: The girl leads Becky out of the gallery and down a corridor.
text: She takes Becky's hand, flashes a relieved smile.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: My name's Abbie. I'm from
dialog: Massachusetts.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: Don't worry, Abbie. We'll find him.
scene_heading: INT. MUSEUM - DAY
text: Dave leads Balthazar through the museum.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: How do you know she'll be here? Did
dialog: you put a tracking spell on her?
text: Dave arrives at THE CHAGALL. He gazes at the painting,
text: smiles at the memory.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Something like that.
text: Dave scans the room, looking left and right. At the far end
text: of the museum he sees Becky just as she and Abbie duck around
text: a corner and disappear.
text: Balthazar smiles at Dave: 'Go get her.' But as Dave runs
text: off, Balthazar spins around -- SENSES SOMETHING.
scene_heading: INT. MUSEUM - UTILITY CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
text: The drone of MACHINERY and the exposed conduit on the walls
dialog: gives us the sense that this is a utility corridor.
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: Are you sure it was this way?
speaker_heading: ABBIE
dialog: Yeah, he was just up here!
text: Abbie pulls Becky around the corner, right into --
text: A VISION FROM HELL.
text: CHERNABOG -- towers over Becky, a hulking, 15-foot tall demon
text: with glowing eyes, devil's horns and massive bat wings.
text: Becky gasps, too terrified to move, to speak.
speaker_heading: ABBIE
dialog: We found him!
text: Becky turns to see Abbie, smiling demonically as her clothes
text: transform from jeans and a t-shirt into a 17th century BLACK
scene_heading: PURITAN DRESS and HEAD SCARF, TO REVEAL --
dialog: The last Morganian and the Original Creepy As Hell Little
scene_heading: Girl -- ABIGAIL WILLIAMS.
text: Becky's scream dies in her lungs as Chernabog snatches her up
text: by the throat, pulls her up to his GLOWING DEMONIC EYES.
scene_heading: INT. MUSEUM - MAIN CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
text: Dave runs around the corner into the UTILITY CORRIDOR, then
text: around the next corner where Becky was just a moment ago.
text: At the end of the hall a STEEL DOOR swings the last couple of
text: inches, and SHUTS. Where the heck is she going?
scene_heading: INT. MUSEUM - CONTINUOUS
text: Balthazar doesn't like what he's sensing. He runs into the
text: UTILITY CORRIDOR -- no sign of Dave. He sees the STEEL DOOR,
dialog: bolts for it and runs into --
scene_heading: INT. MECHANICAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: A CONCUSSION BLAST nails Balthazar, sends him skidding across
text: the floor into a massive BOILER -- out cold.
text: The MECHANICAL ROOM beneath the museum is a 70-year-old cavern
text: of PUMPS, PIPING, BOILERS, GENERATORS and HVAC EQUIPMENT.
dialog: 
dialog: 87.
text: Dave is in agony on the concrete floor, having met the same
text: welcome a moment before. He looks up, sees Maxim..
speaker_heading: MAXIM HORVATH
dialog: Boy, did you guys take the bait.
text: +.-then Abigail, and finally Chernabog, holding the terrified
text: Becky in his clutches.
text: Dave stares in shock. He's seen some weird sh*t in the last
text: 72 hours, but nothing like Chernabog.
speaker_heading: MAXIM HORVATH
dialog: You're wondering how we got here...
text: Horvath nods toward a shadowy corner and an ancient, out-of-
text: service ELEVATOR, its art deco doors draped with cobwebs.
speaker_heading: MAXIM HORVATH
text: A portal, installed .in the thirties
dialog: by your Master's Master's Master.
dialog: It can be used to travel across the
dialog: dimensions, or within them.
dialog: ‘ (off Chernabog)
dialog: Cabs just won't stop for him.
text: Chernabog utters a low, monstrous GROWL.
speaker_heading: MAXIM HORVATH
dialog: Say hello to Chernabog, Conjurer
dialog: of Souls...and this is Abigail
dialog: Williams.
text: Abigail smiles rather sweetly. Dave sees Balthazar starting
text: to come to. Dave gets to his feet, trying to buy some time.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: She's the last sorcerer before
dialog: Morgana? I thought each one of you
dialog: was supposed to be tougher than the
dialog: one before.
text: Abigail's smile morphs into.a chilling scowl.
speaker_heading: MAXIM HORVATH
dialog: Oh, boy. Prob'ly shouldn't have
dialog: said that.
text: Abigail starts walking toward Dave. Dave takes a step back.
speaker_heading: MAXIM HORVATH
dialog: You know the Salem Witch Trials?
dialog: Well, Abigail here is the little
dialog: devil who started it all...
dialog: 
dialog: 88.
text: Dave stares in horror as ABIGAIL'S MOUTH opens at a grotesque
dialog: 90 degree angle and --
text: A SWARM OF BATS comes flying out!
text: Dave SCREAMS as the bats swarm him, pummelling him. He falls
text: to his knees, conjures a FIREBALL to try and scatter them --
text: But the fireball MORPHS INTO a giant HELLFIRE BAT that
text: dive-bombs Dave, sends him scrambling for cover!
text: Chernabog grins, his massive hand splayed out. Horvath
text: shakes his head at Dave.
scene_heading: MAXIM. HORVATH
dialog: I wouldn't play with fire,
dialog: scarecrow.
dialog: (off Chernabog)
dialog: Not with that guy in the room.
text: Horvath nods and the SWARM OF BATS and the HELLFIRE BAT
text: disappear. Dave falls to the ground on his back, opens his
text: eyes to see Horvath standing over him.
speaker_heading: MAXIM HORVATH
dialog: You have something that belongs to
dialog: me.
text: THE DRAGON RING -- almost seems to recoil as Horvath reaches
text: down to pluck it from Dave's finger. But Horvath is a Prime
text: Merlinean. The dragon has no choice as Horvath takes the
text: ring and SLIPS IT ON HIS FINGER.
text: ACROSS THE ROOM -- Balthazar struggles to his knees.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: No...
text: Horvath grins, reaches into his coat and pulls out --
text: THE INNERMOST DOLL. MORGANA LE FAY stares out at us, a
text: chilling medieval rendering of the dark sorceress.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: NO!!!!
text: Balthazar lunges at Horvath, but Horvath -- his power
text: magnified by Merlin's ring -- throws out his hand and sends
text: Balthazar flying into the wall, pinning him there.
speaker_heading: HORVATH
dialog: Relax, Blake. Enjoy the show.
dialog: 
dialog: 89.
scene_heading: INT. MECHANICAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: THE MORGANA NESTING DOLL -- hovers in mid-air, held aloft by
text: tendrils of DARK ENERGY that Horvath has conjured. Abigail
text: and Chernabog look on.
text: Balthazar is pinned against the wall; Dave and Becky are left
text: to stand together. Things look bleak.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Becky, those things I said
dialog: before...that wasn't me.
text: But Becky is beyond terrified.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: What've you gotten me into?
text: Dave looks to Balthazar. He was right about mixing sorcery
dialog: and love.
text: THE NESTING DOLL -- starts to GROW, and buckle outward, now
text: resembling a giant egg -- or more accurately an EGG SAC,
text: because its outer shell is no longer hard but malleable...
text: AND THERE'S SOMETHING INSIDE -- TRYING TO GET OUT.
text: THE EGG SAC -- bends in places, stretches out in the shape of
text: a hand, a head. We are witnessing a sickening birth. Dave
text: and Becky cringe as a RIPPING SOUND gives way to --
text: A FEMALE HUMANOID FIGURE -- tears its way out of the doll,
text: rises up and straightens...
text: We TILT UP the woman's body as the SLIMY MUCK that covers her
text: flesh rearranges itself on her skin, morphing into a purple-
text: black dress that hugs her every curve, TO REVEAL --
dialog: MORGANA LE FAY is the wickedest woman in the world, and the
text: most seductive. A wanton smile crosses her lips as we TILT
text: UP to her face to reveal the most shocking thing of all. By
dialog: all appearances --
text: THIS WOMAN IS VERONICA FLOOD.
text: Dave gasps, in shock. Balthazar shakes with emotion. Horvath
text: smiles at his Queen.
speaker_heading: MAXIM HORVATH
dialog: Morgana, you're free...
text: Morgana smiles, draws her lips close to Horvath's -- and
text: BITCH-SLAPS HIM. Blood trickles from Horvath's lip.
dialog: 
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: MORGANA LE FAY
dialog: It took you long enough.
text: Horvath wipes his lip: God, she's hot. Chernabog bows his
text: head to Morgana. Abigail curtsies.
speaker_heading: MORGANA LE FAY
dialog: (off Dave and Becky)
dialog: And these?
speaker_heading: MAXIM HORVATH
dialog: She's a citizen. He's the Prime
dialog: Merlinean, if you can believe it.
text: Morgana takes Dave's chin, examining him. Shakes her head.
speaker_heading: MORGANA LE FAY
dialog: They don't make them like they used
dialog: to.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (in shock)
dialog: You're Veronica Flood...you died.
text: Morgana smiles darkly.
speaker_heading: MORGANA LE FAY
dialog: My dear young man...
text: Morgana draws her lips seductively close to his.
speaker_heading: MORGANA LE FAY
dialog: .«-.do I feel dead to you?
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: STOP!!!
text: Morgana turns, sees Balthazar for the first time, realizes:
speaker_heading: MORGANA LE FAY
dialog: You haven't told him, have you?
dialog: (smiles at Dave)
dialog: You're gonna love this. Fifteen
dialog: years ago, after centuries trapped
dialog: in Merlin's damn little cage, I was
dialog: freed. But my spirit can't exist
dialog: in the open for long -- it needs a
dialog: host.
text: Dave looks to the devastated Balthazar as the truth becomes
text: crushingly clear. Morgana gazes admiringly at her body.
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: MORGANA LE FAY
dialog: I hardly got to enjoy this little
dialog: filly before Aurelius put me back
dialog: in the Grimhold. I can't wait to
dialog: take her for a ride.
text: Balthazar quakes with rage. Morgana smiles.
speaker_heading: MORGANA LE FAY
dialog: I bet that was fun...the love of
dialog: your life sitting just a few feet
text: away, right there on the shelf.
dialog: And the only thing standing between
dialog: you and her...is them.
text: CHERNABOG, HORVATH, ABIGAIL -- stare demonically as Morgana
text: waves her hand and sends the shaken Balthazar sliding down
text: the wall to his feet.
speaker_heading: MORGANA LE FAY
dialog: And your job -- no, your sworn
dialog: duty -- is to make sure you never
dialog: see her. again...
dialog: (smiles) ©
dialog: You've just got to love life's
text: little twists and turns.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Veronica...it's me. }
text: For a moment there is a glimmer in Morgana's eyes -- of
text: recognition and humanity. Then the moment is gone.
text: Morgana nods to Horvath: ‘Kill them.' Horvath powers up for
dialog: a spell when --
text: VOOSH! AN INK-BLACK CLOUD douses everyone in midnight.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Runt!!
text: Dave feels Balthazar hoist him by the shirt and pull him as
text: fast as he can toward the elevator.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Wait! I don't have Becky!
text: Morgana throws a BLAST OF WIND that dissipates the cloud.
speaker_heading: MORGANA LE FAY
dialog: Nice try.
text: It takes just seconds. Morgana throws an ALL-CONSUMING
text: FIREBALL at Balthazar and Dave...
dialog: om,
dialog: 92.
text: Dave looks back, sees Becky SCREAM as Chernabog snatches her
text: in his arms...
text: Horvath gasps as MERLIN'S RING uncoils and the DRAGON LEAPS
dialog: from his finger...
text: Balthazar pulls Dave into the elevator and dives for the
text: antiquated UP/DOWN LEVER...
text: THE FIREBALL -- flies in on Balthazar and Dave...
text: THE DRAGON RING -- leaps across the floor in two big bounds,
text: jumps into the elevator and onto Dave's finger, and then --
text: The fireball EXPLODES into the elevator shaft, incinerating
dialog: everything in it!
text: As the flames subside, the Morganians stand at what used to
text: be the elevator door. Dave and Balthazar are --
speaker_heading: MAXIM HORVATH
text: Gone. And so is Merlin's ring.
speaker_heading: MORGANA LE FAY
dialog: It doesn't matter. Its work is
dialog: done.
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL WILLIAMS
dialog: What should we do with this one?
text: Morgana smiles as Becky struggles in Chernabog's arms.
speaker_heading: MORGANA LE FAY
dialog: I'm sure I'll think of something.
scene_heading: INT. ANTIQUE ELEVATOR —- SPACETIME
text: Balthazar and Dave grip the walls as the elevator zooms

dialog: Hang on!!!
text: KA-BOOM! The elevator comes to a jarring stop as Dave and
text: Balthazar go flying out the door through some TREE BRANCHES,
dialog: landing in the mud in a --
text: DENSE THICKET OF MANGROVES...
text: They look around, gather their senses. We seem to have
text: landed in a PREHISTORIC COASTAL JUNGLE. An eerie RED LIGHT
text: suffuses everything as Dave follows Balthazar toward the
text: source of the light.

dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: DAVE

speaker_heading: MORGANA LE FAY
dialog: You want to play, is that it?

dialog: Go have some fun.

text: and muskets, their skulls grinning murderously in the
text: moonlight. The Wraiths have cut off Dave from the Grimhold.
text: Dave and Becky step back, in awe of these horrors.
speaker_heading: MORGANA LE FAY
dialog: Ah, the proud Merlinean line.
dialog: Names like Ambrosius...Maltwood...
dialog: Garcia de Ayala...Dave.
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: How the mighty have fallen. Merlin
dialog: would've thanked me. for what I'm
text: about to do.
text: But as she raises her hand --
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR (0.S.)
dialog: Or he would've mopped up the floor
dialog: with you...
text: Morgana turns toward the voice.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: ++-again.
text: BALTHAZAR -- steps forward, flanked by the CHRYSLER EAGLE and
text: the massively muscled ROCKEFELLER ATLAS, as epically heroic as
dialog: the day Dave first saw him.
text: Dave and Becky smile. Surprisingly, so does Morgana.
speaker_heading: MORGANA LE FAY
dialog: Now this is how we used to do it.
text: Morgana throws a PLASMA BOLT, and it's on: a clash as physical
dialog: as it is magical, with our heroes having to simultaneously
text: battle the MORGANIANS and the WRAITHS.
text: QUICK CUTS -- Balthazar dodges Horvath's LIGHTNING BOLTS,
text: seizes a WRAITH'S SWORD and fights like a man possessed...
text: MORGANA -- summons a CYCLONE down from the skies, sends it
text: careening toward Dave...
text: DAVE -- throws out his hands, then rips them apart, tearing
text: Morgana's CYCLONE into a dozen MINI-CYCLONES, each of which
text: flies into a WRAITH, blasting it to smithereens.
text: BECKY -- sees the GRIMHOLD on the ground and runs for it.
text: Suddenly Becky falls -- trapped in QUICKSAND! Abigail closes
dialog: in for the kill.
text: Dave sees Becky in trouble, runs to help her.
speaker_heading: MORGANA LE FAY
dialog: Fool.
text: Morgana sends a CONCUSSION BLAST rippling through the air --
text: ATLAS -- jumps in front of Dave, absorbing the impact.
text: Atlas punches Morgana with a massive STEEL FIST. Her head
text: barely turns. She backhands Atlas, sends him flying.
text: ABIGAIL -- sees Dave on his way to help Becky. She opens
text: her mouth at a horrific angle, only this time she
dialog: projectile-vomits --
text: A SWARM OF ANGRY WASPS!
dialog: 
dialog: 101.
text: But the CHRYSLER EAGLE flies in, sends the wasps scattering.
text: Abigail has no time to get out of the way as --
text: WHAM!!! The eagle clips her with its wing -- KNOCKS HER
speaker_heading: UNCONSCIOUS.
text: BECKY -- is about to be pulled under the quicksand when Dave
text: lifts her out with an ANTI-GRAVITY SPELL. He levitates into
text: the air to catch her and for a heartbeat they hang there like
text: the boy and girl in the Chagall painting.
text: Dave sets the two of them down, looks into Becky's eyes.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Becky, I --
text: But Horvath touches his hand to the ground, sends a RIPPLING
text: SHOCKWAVE that uproots Dave and sends him slamming into a
text: lamp post.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Unnfffi!!
text: As ATLAS and the CHRYSLER EAGLE wade into the slashing
text: WRAITHS, and Balthazar faces off against Morgana, Horvath
text: casts a withering assault of sorcery at Dave...
text: A FIREBALL nearly incinerates him. A CONCUSSION BLAST sends
dialog: him flying into --
text: WHAM!!! -- an aluminum TOOL SHED. Dave plows through the
text: shed and keeps going, landing hard on his back.
text: Horvath walks toward him, picks up a shovel. In Horvath's
text: hands the shovel MORPHS INTO an EXECUTIONER'S AXE.
speaker_heading: MAXIM HORVATH
dialog: There's no magic or science that
dialog: can save you now, apprentice.
text: Horvath stands over Dave, brings the axe back.
text: Dave looks over, sees Becky looking sorrowfully at him. Then
text: unexpectedly, he smiles.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I love you.
text: AN UNTAPPED POWER lights in Dave's eyes. Becky smiles
text: through her tears as Dave looks up at Horvath.
speaker_heading: DAVE
text: Objects in motion stay in motion...
dialog: 
dialog: 102.
text: Horvath pauses with the axe --
speaker_heading: HORVATH
dialog: Boy, what are you talking about?
text: WHOOSH! Horvath looks up as --
text: A ROCK the size of a basketball nails him in the chest and
text: sends him flying -- WHAM! -- into a TREE TRUNK.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: -+-unless acted upon by an opposing
dialog: force.
text: Horvath is in serious pain as he gets up, sees Dave walking
text: toward him. Dave looks transformed, as if a veil has been
text: lifted, and science and magic are one within him.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Newton's first law. Number two?
text: The acceleration of an object is
dialog: directly proportional to the net
dialog: force acting on it. For example:
text: Dave throws a massive PLASMA BOLT that SLAMS into Horvath,
text: drops him like a stone.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: And my personal favorite, number
dialog: three: for every action...
text: Dave hoists Horvath in the grip of an INVISIBLE GRAVITY and
text: flings him -~ WHAM! -- into the base of a CIVIL WAR MONUMENT,
text: spider-webbing the marble.
text: Horvath staggers, teeters like a punch-drunk boxer.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ...there's an equal and opposite
dialog: reaction.
text: WHUMP! Horvath lands hard, out cold. Dave stands
text: triumphantly over him, a sorcerer now.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Physics.
text: MEANWHILE...
text: Balthazar and Morgana wage FIERCE SORCERER WARFARE, mixing
text: spells culled from all Seven Alchemies -- a Master Class.
dialog: 
dialog: en,
dialog: 103.
dialog: Fighting Morgana is all the more difficult because for every
text: PLASMA BOLT he sends slamming into Morgana, Balthazar knows
text: it's Veronica's body he's harming.
text: But that doesn't stop him. Morgana goes down, winces in
text: pain. For a moment Balthazar forgets who he's dealing with.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Veronica, you don't want to do this.
text: A moment is all it takes. Morgana throws out her hand,
text: BASHES Balthazar with an invisible force -- then brings her
text: hand down, SMASHING him to the ground.
speaker_heading: MORGANA LE FAY
dialog: It's Morgana. And I so do.
text: Balthazar lies face-down in the dirt, in agony. As Morgana
text: approaches for the kill, Balthazar rolls over, TO REVEAL -—-—
text: THE GRIMHOLD -- is in his hands, transformed to show ALL THE
text: MORGANIANS on the outermost doll.
speaker_heading: MORGANA LE FAY
dialog: Nice try...but you're not the Prime
dialog: Merlinean.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: No...he is.
text: They move in perfect sync. Balthazar throws. the Grimhold
text: into the air; Dave lifts his hand, freezes it in place.
text: The DRAGON'S EYES glow on Dave's ring as he turns his
text: outstretched hand to the side -- and the doll TWISTS OPEN!
speaker_heading: MORGANA LE FAY
speaker_heading: NOLL!
text: A BLINDING LIGHT -- shines in the seam of the doll, swells
text: into a VORTEX OF LIGHT.
text: Morgana digs her fingers into the ground, fighting the awesome
text: suction that pulls her toward the light.
text: ABIGAIL -- SCREAMS as she tumbles through the air, gets
text: sucked into the vortex.
text: HORVATH -- resists for as long as he can, until he, too,
text: vanishes into the light.
text: Becky ducks as the unconscious CHERNABOG comes flying through
text: the air into the vortex.
speaker_heading: Om
dialog: 104.
text: MORGANA -- can't hold on! She slips, flies through the air --
text: A HAND -- shoots out, catches her hand. BALTHAZAR'S!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No!!! What are you doing?!
text: Balthazar holds onto Morgana with all the strength he has
dialog: left.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Balthazar, let her go!
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: Not this time...not this time!!!
text: THE GRIMHOLD VORTEX -- increases in power, its outer edge now
text: just a few feet from Balthazar and Morgana.
text: Balthazar's eyes meet Morgana's -- but they're not Morgana's,
dialog: they're Veronica's! And then --
text: A MONSTROUS SPECTRAL CREATURE -- part woman, part demon, is
text: wrenched free of Veronica's body. THE REAL MORGANA LE FAY!
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: (human again)
dialog: Balthazar!
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Hang on!!!
text: THE SPECTRAL MORGANA SCREAMS, a hideous, defiant SHRIEK...
text: TOO LATE! The evil spirit is sucked into the VORTEX as a
text: MASSIVE BOOM OF THUNDER echoes across New York. And when the
text: echo fades...
text: THE SEALED GRIMHOLD -- sits in a smoking, smoldering crater.
text: THE WRAITHS -- are suddenly drawn up into the air, away from
text: their battle with Atlas and the Chrysler Eagle, growing more
dialog: spectral every second.
scene_heading: EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE - NIGHT
text: As if called by the toll of an unseen bell, the Wraiths
text: descend from the low clouds, returning beneath the pavement
dialog: to the sleep of their graves...

text: Dawn's first light appears in the sky. Balthazar looks up,

speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Veronica...Veronica!
text: Veronica eyes flutter open. Balthazar holds his breath.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Where's father...?
text: Balthazar shudders with emotion, begins to weep. Veronica
text: pulls him close, holds him tight and doesn't let go.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: It's okay, my love. It's okay...
text: Dave and Becky look on, deeply moved. Behind them are ATLAS
text: and the CHRYSLER EAGLE. Dave and Becky share a smile of
text: amazement as the statues nod, then disappear into the mist...

text: POLICE CARS flood into the park across the 65TH STREET
text: TRANSVERSE, as we CRANE DOWN TO...
text: A CENTRAL PARK HORSE CARRIAGE -- trots out of the park. Dave
text: holds the reins, Becky is beside him. They smile.
text: Balthazar and Veronica are in the back. Veronica wears

text: The REPORTER stands in Rockefeller Center. Dave sees ATLAS

text: AT THE FRONT OF THE STORE -- Balthazar tries to close a sale.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: ...seriously, what says Valentine's
text: Day like human hearts stuffed in a

text: THE CUSTOMER -- smiles awkwardly, turns and walks out.
speaker_heading: BALTHAZAR
dialog: Fine! Go with the Godiva!
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: We need to seriously think about
dialog: your product line.
text: Becky is stacking items on shelves. Balthazar sighs as
