text: After a few introductory credits, we pull back to reveal the
text: source of this kaleidoscopic backdrop: A SINGLE, STRIPED
text: TULIP, planted in a long row of other tulips. A HAND reaches
text: in and pulls the tulip from the ground. We then cut to:
text: A BASKET of tulips, carried by hand to a truck, where it 1A
text: is loaded with hundreds of other baskets. The door of the
dialog: truck is SHUT and we cut to:
text: The door of the truck OPENING to reveal that the tulips 1B
text: are now boxed and crated. A forklift moves the crates onto a
text: wagon, which is driven by a MANNED CART across the biggest
text: warehouse on the planet, the Bloenen Markt (CHECK THIS--

text: were following disappear into a maze of synchronized
dialog: activity.
text: The cart arrives in the AUCTION ROOM, which is 1c
text: constructed like an ampitheater: the buyers sit in a steeply
text: raked semi-circle, facing two giant, clock-shaped scoreboards
text: that display the bids on the flowers being viewed. The
text: striped tulips fetch a very high price.
text: The carts of striped tulips are delivered to an automated 1D
text: sorting apparatus of enormous size and complexity. They end
text: up on a truck heading for the airport.
text: The tulips are loaded onto a plane. During the transatlantic
text: flight, they sit nestled in the cargo hold.
text: The tulips are unloaded from the plane, driven across an 1F
text: airport tarmac and loaded onto another plane.
text: The tulips are unloaded from the plane and loaded onto a 1G

speaker_heading: RUSTY

speaker_heading: SAUL

speaker_heading: RUSTY

speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: LIVINGSTON
dialog: And he only had a crew of six.
speaker_heading: RUSTY

scene_heading: INT. BARGE HULL 57
text: FIND Frank and Livingston inside manning a series of
text: industrial water pumps. They’re grimy and covered in sweat.
text: Rain drips through the deck above them.
speaker_heading: LIVINGSTON
dialog: So, Basher approached me about
text: being on a crew.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: LIVINGSTON
dialog: Yesterday.
text: Frank thinks about that.
text: Yen pops his head out from a small tube and says something in
dialog: Chinese.
text: Frank shrugs...doesn’t understand. Yen tries again.... This
text: time he enunciates very clearly and talks very loudly (like
dialog: Americans do when foreigners don’t understand English).
text: Frank nods, starts turning the handle of the water pump in
text: the opposite direction. Yen climbs down out of the tube.
text: Then he climbs back up the tube. He picks up a jack in the
text: corner. Climbs back in the tube.
scene_heading: INT. UNDER VANDERSPEIGLE’S HOUSE - NIGHT 58
text: We FOLLOW him as he climbs through the tube and emerges
text: underneath Vanderspeigle’s house, inside its foundation.
text: The thirty pylons extend from the base of the house into the
text: into the swamp it sits atop of. There is little space
text: between the swamp level and the house. Runoff from the rain

text: FIND the Malloys, thirty feet away, using a fancy underwater

speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: There’s no reason for him not to.
dialog: He would go to the cops.
speaker_heading: TURK
dialog: Okay, so he goes to the cops.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
text: Then they arrest Dominique.
speaker_heading: TURK.
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Then we have no story.
speaker_heading: TURK
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: LINUS
text: She steals the money from Mr.

speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Counterfeiting? Me?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I have to tell you, it’s not

speaker_heading: BASHER
dialog: It is cheating.
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: There’s no subtlety to it.
speaker_heading: BASHER
dialog: It’s kind of embarrassing.
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: No one I know...
speaker_heading: BASHER
dialog: I can’t imagine anything like that.
text: A long beat. Then each of them reach into their jackets and

speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: Let’s discuss, briefly and to
dialog: begin, with the category of
dialog: "thieves", as distinguished from
dialog: the larger category of what might
dialog: be termed “hardened” criminals.
dialog: The highest level, “master
dialog: thieves,” if you will, is a very
dialog: small world. Between six and ten
text: high-level crews are operating in
dialog: Europe at any given time.
dialog: Worldwide, no more than twenty. The

dialog: insufferable.
text: The Higher-Ups look at each other; what did she just say?
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: Their egos demand constant praise,
dialog: and they embellish their exploits
dialog: to anyone who will listen. They
dialog: tell their own stories endlessly,
dialog: provided of course, they are
text: talking to a fellow thief or an
dialog: intimate.
text: Many in the audience are now looking to each other, wondering
dialog: if this is appropriate.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: Those who interact with them on a
dialog: personal level are relegated to
dialog: positions of total servitude, with
dialog: no chance for growth or freedom.
dialog: Their lives are treated as
dialog: secondary. Many of them suffer from
dialog: depression. It’s a crime for which
dialog: there is no law, and yet causes
dialog: untold damage.
text: One of the Higher-Ups convinces the other to say something,

speaker_heading: ISABEL

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (calls to her)
dialog: We considered that, but the mark
dialog: swears that nobody in the world
dialog: knew the code except him. He
dialog: programmed the last seven steps of
dialog: the system himself. He set it and

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (calling to Isabel in the
dialog: bedroom)
dialog: Actually, I don’t know about that.
text: Isabel re-enters the office.
speaker_heading: PAUL (cont'd)
dialog: Unless he had a habit of typing in
dialog: the code like this--
text: He stands to the side of the panel and reaches over to type
text: in the numbers. It’s an obviously unnatural position. Then
text: he moves in front of the panel and types in the code as one
dialog: normally would.
speaker_heading: PAUL (cont'd)
dialog: --then his body would block the
text: view from across the canal.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: That’s why they probably set up
dialog: over there--
text: She points out an adjacent window on another wall.
speaker_heading: ISABEL (cont'd)
dialog: --And used the mirror.
text: She points at a small mirror on the opposite wall. The
text: detective bends down so his eye is at the level of the
text: keypad, then he looks in the mirror. He can see directly
text: across the canal into another house.
speaker_heading: ISABEL (cont'd)
dialog: I’m guessing they’d need a fifteen

scene_heading: BACK TO SCENE -- THE CRIME SCENE 71
text: The lead detective watches Isabel intently.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What is it?

dialog: When Europol calls we don’t jump up
