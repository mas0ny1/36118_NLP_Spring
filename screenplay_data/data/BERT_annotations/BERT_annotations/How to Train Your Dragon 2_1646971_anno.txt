scene_heading: EXT. OPEN SEA - DAY
dialog: 
text: Hiccup and Toothless BLUR PAST, leaving a wake that leads...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BERK - DAY
scene_heading: (Sequence 0200 - New Berk)
text: To the island village of Berk, festively adorned with flags
text: and banners. Major new additions alter its familiar skyline.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (V.O.)
dialog: This... is Berk. The best kept
dialog: secret this side of, well,
dialog: anywhere. Granted, it may not look
dialog: like much, but this wet heap of
dialog: rock packs more than a few
dialog: surprises.
text: ON A CLUSTER OF SHEEP, hiding nervously between buildings as
text: shadows of passing dragons race by. The group moves as one,
text: receding into a shadowy alley, pushing one sheep out into the
text: light. It's suddenly snatched and carried into the air!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP (V.O.)
dialog: Life here is amazing, just not for
dialog: the faint of heart. See, where most
dialog: folks enjoy hobbies like whittling
dialog: or needlepoint, we Berkians prefer
dialog: a little something we like to call--
text: WHOOSH, WHOOSH, WHOOSH! A wash of VIBRANT COLORS blurs by.
text: DRAGONS BARREL PAST at a dizzying speed. Their RIDERS SWIPE,
text: KICK, and ROLL into one another while they WEAVE neck in neck
text: between the houses, docks, and revamped structures of Berk.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (V.O.)
scene_heading: DRAGON RACING!
text: It's like an aerial version of the Monte Carlo race.
text: Spectators ROAR from wooden bleachers, fastened to cliff
text: faces and perched over the sea.
dialog: 
text: FISHLEGS, now 20 and even larger, rides his gronkle, MEATLUG,
text: who carries the sheep in her claws, until...
dialog: 
text: SNOTLOUT, also 20, but every bit as juvenile, and his
text: Monstrous Nightmare, HOOKFANG, steal the sheep from them.
scene_heading: HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNOTLOUT
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry, Fishlegs! Did you
dialog: want that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FISHLEGS
dialog: Snotlout! That's mine!
text: Snotlout FALLS BACK toward RUFFNUT and TUFFNUT, who lag on
text: their two-headed Zippleback, BARF &amp; BELCH.
speaker_heading: SNOTLOUT
dialog: Here ya go, babe.
text: With a chivalrous grin, Snotlout tosses the sheep to Ruffnut.
text: She SNATCHES it with a sneer and a GRUMBLE.
speaker_heading: SNOTLOUT (CONT'D)
dialog: Did I tell you that you look
dialog: amazing today? `Cause you do.
speaker_heading: RUFFNUT
dialog: Come on, Barf. It's starting to
dialog: stink around here.
text: Barf starts to peel off, spewing gas. Tuffnut mocks Snotlout
text: with a mugging grin.
speaker_heading: TUFFNUT
dialog: Nope. Still hates you. Let's blow
dialog: this place, Belch!
text: Belch ignites the gas, sparking a flashy explosion, and
text: leaving Snotlout behind in the smoke.
text: As they rush past the main bleachers, Ruffnut DROPS her sheep
text: into one of five baskets suspended over a chasm at the lap
text: crossing. Each backboard bears an image of its corresponding
text: dragon. The Barf/Belch basket filled to the brim with sheep.
text: Presiding over the game, STOICK turns to the frenzied crowd.
speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: That's nine for the Twins, Astrid
text: lags with three, Fishlegs and
dialog: Snotlout trail with NONE!
text: Stoick eyes an empty basket at the far end, its backboard
text: painted with an image of Toothless.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STOICK (CONT'D)
dialog: And Hiccup is... nowhere to be
dialog: found. Hmmm.
scene_heading: HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 3.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: Scared him off with the big talk,
dialog: didn't ya, Stoick?
text: WHACK! Snotlout, still smoldering from the blast, gets
text: CLIPPED from behind. ASTRID, rolls in, astride STORMFLY --
text: spirited and competitive as ever, and beautiful despite
dialog: herself.
speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: What are you doing, Snotlout?!
dialog: They're going to win now!
speaker_heading: SNOTLOUT
dialog: She's my princess! Whatever she
dialog: wants, she gets.
speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: Ruffnut?! Didn't she try to bury
dialog: you alive?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNOTLOUT
dialog: Only for a few hours!
text: BACK TO THE RACERS, as they peel away, pouring on the speed.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (V.O.)
dialog: Dragons used to be a bit of a
dialog: problem here. But that was five
dialog: years ago. Now they've all moved
dialog: in. And, really, why wouldn't they?
text: The racers chase each other through a sprawling hangar and
text: into a vast cave, teeming with colorfully painted dragon
text: stables. They exit through the far side and circle back
text: through the village, blasting past many of its dragon-
dialog: friendly additions.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (V.O.)
dialog: We have custom stables... all-you-
dialog: can-eat feeding stations... a full
dialog: service dragon wash...
dialog: 
text: In the village, a baby Gronkle sneezes, accidentally setting
text: one of the Viking houses aflame.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (V.O.)
dialog: Even top-of-the-line fire
dialog: prevention, if I do say so myself.
text: Astrid rolls her eyes, peels away from the other dragon
text: racers, and yanks open a spout on the overhead network of
text: aqueducts, dousing the flames with a surge of water.
scene_heading: HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: BACK TO STOICK, amused as he watches the racers round the
text: island, searching for sheep. He turns to Gobber and nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: It's time, Gobber.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: Righty-ho!
dialog: (aloud, to the crowd)
dialog: Last lap!
text: A HORN sounds. The racers all turn to each other, excited.
speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: The black sheep! Come on, Stormfly!
dialog: We can still win this thing!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUFFNUT
dialog: Come on, Barf!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUFFNUT
dialog: Let's go!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FISHLEGS
dialog: Go, Meatlug!
text: GOBBER loads the BLACK SHEEP onto a catapult.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: This is your big moment. Have a
dialog: nice flight!
dialog: 
text: He pulls the trigger, LAUNCHING the black sheep into the air.
text: Astrid spots it and steers Stormfly into a steep climb toward
dialog: it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: Up, up, up!
text: In a flash, Fishlegs and Meatlug blur past, NABBING the
dialog: sheep.
speaker_heading: ASTRID (CONT'D)
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: FISHLEGS
dialog: Good job, Meatlug!
text: Fishlegs tosses his captured prize to Ruffnut.
speaker_heading: FISHLEGS (CONT'D)
dialog: Here you go, darling. Mine's worth
dialog: ten!
scene_heading: HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUFFNUT
dialog: Yeah! The Black Sheep!
text: Snotlout sighs, frustrated.
speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: You guys are fighting for Ruffnut?!
speaker_heading: RUFFNUT
dialog: I'm totally winning!
dialog: 
text: Fishlegs hovers up nest to Ruffnut with a starry-eyed smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FISHLEGS
dialog: We're winning together!
text: She RAMS BARF into Meatlug, sending Fishlegs into an
text: uncontrolled SPIN. He SLAMS into Snotlout, sending their
text: dragons TUMBLING head over tail. The crowd goes wild.
speaker_heading: RUFFNUT
dialog: No one can stop me now!
speaker_heading: TUFFNUT
dialog: Except for me. We're attached,
dialog: genius!
dialog: 
text: He GRABS at the sheep. Ruffnut fights back, inciting a tug-of-
dialog: war.
speaker_heading: TUFFNUT (CONT'D)
dialog: Quit trying to steal all my glory!
text: And while they're distracted, Astrid steers Stormfly toward
text: them, CLOSING IN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: Get `em, Astrid!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUFFNUT RUFFNUT
dialog: It's MY glory! No sheep, no You're always ruining
dialog: glory! EVERYTHING!
text: Astrid leaps off of Stormfly, runs up Belch's spindly neck,
text: and PLUCKS the black sheep from the Twins' hands.
speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: Gotcha!
dialog: 
text: She tumbles through the air onto Stormfly, sticking a perfect
text: landing, black sheep in hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUFFNUT
dialog: Astrid!
scene_heading: HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: BACK TO STOICK, beside himself. The crowd ROARS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: Well played! Hahaha!
dialog: (gloating, to the crowd)
dialog: That's my future daughter-in-law!
text: BACK TO ASTRID ON STORMFLY
text: eyeing the fast-approaching FINISH LINE, unaware as...
text: FISHLEGS suddenly RAMS Meatlug into Stormfly, sending Astrid
text: off-course. She recovers and sees Snotlout flying headlong
text: toward her, war hammer cocked, aiming at Astrid.
speaker_heading: SNOTLOUT
dialog: Uh, excuse me.
speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: Stormfly!
text: Snotlout HURLS his hammer. Astrid ducks and rolls Stormfly
text: out of the way. The hammer catches Fishlegs in the face with
text: a CLANG. The crowd collectively winces.
dialog: 
text: Astrid and Stormfly recover from their roll, loop over the
text: water, and they BLAST past the finish line, DUNKING the black
dialog: sheep into their basket!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: That's thirteen! Astrid takes the
dialog: game!
text: The crowd COMES UNHINGED. Astrid flies over the crowd,
text: basking in her victory.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (V.O.)
dialog: Yep. Berk is pretty much perfect.
dialog: All of my hard work has paid off.
dialog: And it's a good thing, too, because
text: with Vikings on the backs of
dialog: dragons, the world just got a whole
dialog: lot bigger.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OPEN SKY/ISLAND COASTLINE - DAY
scene_heading: (Scene 0300 - AWOL Part One)
text: A boundless sky. Vast. Clear. Crisp. And from it, a BLACK
text: SPECK rockets across the horizon. The image of unbridled
dialog: freedom.
scene_heading: HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Tucked into his riding position, HICCUP appears to be part of
text: TOOTHLESS. They dip, roll and dive, over a sea teeming with
text: Thunderdrums, pulling off daring maneuvers with honed
text: refinement, making them seem effortless.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Yeah!
text: They jackknife, heading skyward, rolling and tumbling through
text: the ethereal cloud-scapes and joining high-flying Timberjacks
text: as they soar in formation.
text: Hiccup is bound head-to-toe in a snug, aerodynamic flight
text: suit -- an asymmetrical, functional design of leather and
text: articulated plates. It has an air of Viking bike leather.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you think, bud? Wanna give
dialog: this another shot?
dialog: 
text: Toothless grumbles in protest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Toothless! It'll be fine.
text: With a click of a lever, he LOCKS the pedals in the flared
text: tail position. Hiccup then unhooks himself from the saddle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Ready?
text: Toothless SNORTS unenthusiastically.
text: Suddenly, Hiccup SLIDES OFF of Toothless, peeling away from
text: him like a skydiver from a plane, YELLING as he plummets.
dialog: 
text: Toothless dives after him. They spiral through the air, face-
text: to-face. Toothless is having fun, despite himself.
text: Hiccup slips his forearms through a pair of tucked leather
text: flaps... and YANKS, unfurling SHEETS OF LEATHER as he extends
text: his arms. They catch the wind, SNAPPING OPEN like WINGS...
text: and sending him GLIDING -- out of control, at first, then
text: stabilizing. The turbulence buffets his flight suit heavily.
dialog: But he's flying!
text: Toothless unfolds his wings, too, catching up with Hiccup.
text: The freedom is palpable. Hiccup and Toothless are, for the
text: moment, the same. Feeling the same rush of adrenaline.
dialog: Independently together.
text: They PLUNGE past cloud formations, splitting apart then
text: crossing paths again.
scene_heading: HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 8.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Impressive as it is, Hiccup is gliding at a steep angle.
text: Toothless launches fireballs ahead of Hiccup, boosting him
text: higher with the expanding heat bursts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: This is amazing!
text: A cloud layer washes past, exposing a towering ROCK
text: FORMATION, dead ahead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: No longer amazing! Toothless!
text: Hiccup tries to steer himself away, to no avail.
text: Toothless POURS ON THE SPEED, trying to catch Hiccup as he
text: HURTLES toward collision. His locked tail makes maneuvering
text: difficult. He's UNABLE TO PULL UP at a steep enough angle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, no!
text: At the last second, Toothless BLASTS the jagged rocks just
text: ahead of Hiccup, then WRAPS Hiccup in his wings as they fly
text: through it. The obliterated peak rains down around them.
text: Toothless emerges through the cloud of debris and HURTLES
text: into the trees of a neighboring peak. They tumble down the
text: uneven terrain, coming to rest on a small plateau.
text: Hiccup emerges from the cocoon of Toothless' wings. He
text: switches his prosthetic riding foot to his walking foot and
text: stows his leather wings.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: That really came out of nowhere.
text: The blown up sea stack collapses.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: We gotta work on your solo gliding
dialog: there, bud. That locked-up tail
dialog: makes for some pretty sloppy rescue
dialog: maneuvers, eh?
text: Hiccup reels in his dorsal fin and removes his helmet,
text: revealing a 20 year old Hiccup framed by wild hair, complete
text: with a Viking braid.
text: He walks to the edge of the cliff, taking in the NEW LAND
text: stretching off into the horizon, its tall cliffs and sea-
text: stacks adorned with swaying gold birch trees basking in the
text: dappled afternoon sunlight.
scene_heading: HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 9.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Looks like we found another one,
dialog: bud.
text: Toothless FUSSES and SNORTS, not amused, shaking off dust and
text: pebbles like a wet dog.
text: Hiccup flinches as a pebble WHACKS him on the back of the
text: head. He looks back to Toothless, who averts his eyes.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, what? Do you want an apology?
dialog: Is that why you're pouting, big
dialog: baby boo? Well... try this on!
text: Hiccup TACKLES Toothless and tries to put him in a headlock.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Ya feeling it yet? Huh? Picking up
dialog: on all my heartfelt remorse?
text: Toothless simply stands on his hind legs, lifting Hiccup off
text: of his flailing feet and dangling him over the cliff's edge.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, come on. You wouldn't hurt a
scene_heading: ONE-LEGGED--
dialog: 
text: Hiccup looks down, seeing the precipitous drop below.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: You're right! You're right! You
dialog: win! You win!
text: WHAM! Toothless flips him over, pinning him to the ground.
text: Hiccup squirms, throwing mock punches. Toothless playfully
text: retaliates with feline taps to Hiccup's head.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: He's down! And it's ugly! Dragons
dialog: and Vikings, enemies again, locked
dialog: in combat to the bitter -- URFFF!
text: Toothless rests his head on Hiccup -- SQUEEZING THE AIR out
text: of him. Toothless then suddenly starts grooming Hiccup,
text: lapping at his face and covering him in slobber.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Gaaaaagh!
dialog: 
text: Hiccup fights to get free, finally springing to his feet and
text: shaking off the viscous saliva.
scene_heading: HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 10.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: You KNOW that doesn't wash out.
dialog: 
text: Toothless LAUGHS, pleased with himself.
dialog: 
text: Shifting his attention back to the new land stretched out
text: before them, Hiccup reaches beneath his chest plate and
text: produces a leather-bound book.
dialog: 
text: He unfurls it to reveal an EXPLORERS MAP, modified with added
text: strips in every direction to accommodate their ever-expanding
text: world. Drawings indicate new lands, new tribes, and many new
dialog: dragons.
text: Hiccup peels a fresh strip of paper from a hidden fold in his
text: flight suit and holds it out for Toothless to lick.
text: Hiccup affixes the moistened strip to the map's outer edge,
text: then whittles a pencil and consults a compass affixed to his
dialog: forearm.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: So what should we name it?
text: Toothless GURGLES as he gnaws under his wing, preoccupied.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: "Itchy Armpit" it is.
text: Hiccup carefully draws the new island's outline.
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Whaddya reckon, bud? Think we might
dialog: find a few Timberjacks in those
dialog: woods? The odd Whispering Death or
dialog: two in the rocks? Who knows...
dialog: maybe we'll finally track down
dialog: another Night Fury.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Wouldn't that be something?
speaker_heading: (BURDENED)
dialog: So, whaddya say? Just keep going?
text: Toothless' ear plates suddenly SHOOT UP. He ROARS, and his
text: call is answered by a familiar SCREECH. Hiccup turns to
dialog: see...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SEA STACK/ISLAND COASTLINE - DAY
scene_heading: (Scene 0325 - AWOL Part Two)
dialog: 
text: ASTRID rising into view, astride Stormfly. Stormfly grabs
text: talon-fulls of rock to slow her landing.
scene_heading: HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 11.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: `Afternoon m'lady. Where have you
dialog: been?
dialog: 
text: Astrid dismounts and throws back her fur hood as Toothless
text: rushes up to greet them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: Winning races. What else? The real
dialog: question is... where have YOU been?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Avoiding my dad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: Oh, no. What happened now?
dialog: 
text: Astrid sits beside Hiccup, inspecting his latest addition to
text: the map. Behind them, Toothless greets Stormfly, inciting a
dialog: play fight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Oh, you're gonna love this. I wake
text: up. The sun's shining. Terrible
text: Terrors are singing on the rooftop.
text: I saunter down to breakfast,
dialog: thinking all is right with the
dialog: world, and I get...
dialog: 
text: He gets to his feet and puffs out his chest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (APING STOICK)
dialog: ... Son, we need to talk.
dialog: 
text: Astrid smiles and adopts Hiccup's sloppy slouch.
speaker_heading: ASTRID
speaker_heading: (APING HICCUP)
dialog: Not now, Dad. I've got a whole day
text: of goofing off to get started.
dialog: 
text: Hiccup breaks character, grimacing at her impression of him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Okay, first of all, I don't sound
dialog: like that. What is this character?
dialog: And second... what is that thing
dialog: you're doing with my shoulders?
dialog: 
text: Astrid laughs, jostling her shoulders in an awkward way.
scene_heading: HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 12.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
text: A truly flattering impersonation.
dialog: Anyway, he goes...
dialog: (resuming Stoick's brogue)
dialog: You're the pride of Berk, son, and
dialog: I couldn't be prouder...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: (continuing her impression
speaker_heading: OF HICCUP)
dialog: Aw, thanks, Dad. I'm pretty
dialog: impressed with myself, too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: WHEN have I ever done that with my
dialog: hands?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: You just did.
dialog: 
text: She laughs, playfully.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Okay... just...
text: (holding her arms, mock-
speaker_heading: STERN)
dialog: Hold still. It's very serious.
dialog: 
text: She giggles, trying to hold a straight face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: (resuming Stoick's brogue)
dialog: You're all grown up, and since no
dialog: chief could ask for a better
dialog: successor, I've decided--
dialog: 
text: Astrid straightens, her face brightening.
speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: --TO MAKE YOU CHIEF! Oh, my gods!
dialog: 
text: She jumps to her feet, beaming...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ASTRID (CONT'D)
dialog: Hiccup, that's amazing!
dialog: 
text: And socks Hiccup in congratulations, deliberately hitting the
text: dorsal fin release button and triggering it to pop up. She
text: laughs as Hiccup reels it back in, self-consciously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: You're gonna wear out the spring
dialog: coil. The calibration is very
dialog: sensitive!
scene_heading: HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 13.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: They're suddenly BOWLED OVER by Toothless and Stormfly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah, so... this is what I'm
dialog: dealing with.
dialog: 
text: Astrid helps him up and dusts him off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ASTRID
speaker_heading: (EXCITED)
dialog: What did you tell him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: I didn't. By the time he turned
dialog: around, I was gone.
dialog: 
text: Astrid picks up the map, folding it as she paces around him,
dialog: processing it all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: Well, it's a lot of responsibility.
dialog: The map will have to wait for sure,
dialog: and I'll need to fly Toothless,
dialog: since you'll be too busy...
dialog: 
text: She pauses, wincing in sympathy. She turns to Hiccup. He nods
text: knowingly, taking the map from her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: It's not me, Astrid. All those
dialog: speeches, and planning, and running
dialog: the village... that's his thing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: I think you're missing the point. I
dialog: mean, chief. What an honor. I'd be
dialog: pretty excited.
text: Hiccup shakes his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: I'm not like you. You know exactly
dialog: who you are. You always have.
dialog: But...
dialog: 
text: He shuffles to the cliff's edge, gazing out at the new land.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm still looking. I know that I'm
dialog: not my father... and I never met my
dialog: mother... so, what does that make
dialog: me?
scene_heading: HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 14.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He sits at the edge, looking burdened, restless. Astrid
text: approaches and settles beside him, joining him in looking out
text: at the distant horizon. She weaves another braid into his
text: hair as she speaks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ASTRID
dialog: What you're searching for... isn't
dialog: out there, Hiccup.
dialog: 
text: She places a hand on his chest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ASTRID (CONT'D)
dialog: It's in here.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Maybe you just don't see it yet.
dialog: 
text: She kisses his cheek, but gets a mouthful of Toothless'
text: slobber. She grimaces, wiping it off.
dialog: 
text: Distracted, Hiccup eyes the horizon keenly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Maybe. But, y'know... there is
dialog: something out there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ASTRID
speaker_heading: (EXASPERATED)
dialog: Hiccup...
dialog: 
text: He turns her face to the horizon. A distant smoke plume rises
text: from a misty valley.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LAPLAND WOODS/TRAPPER'S FORT - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
dialog: (Scene 0400 - Shot Down!)
text: Hiccup and Toothless fly over the fjord, winding deep through
text: undulating crimson and gold forests.
dialog: 
text: Astrid and Stormfly catch up as the autumn colors suddenly
text: give way to charred timbers. They fly deeper, through ash and
text: wafting smoke. Ahead, in a sheltered harbor, an explosion of
text: ice stands as an eerie marker of what used to be a TRAPPER'S
speaker_heading: FORT.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Stay close.
dialog: 
text: They fly through the suspended remains of the buildings,
text: splintered, and frozen in mid-destruction.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: What happened here?
scene_heading: HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 15.
dialog:

speaker_heading: ERET (CONT'D)
dialog: Tie those legs up!

dialog: 
text: The warrior watches keenly from the shadows.
dialog: 
text: Several aggressive dragons close in behind Hiccup. Hearing

dialog: 
text: He then reaches through the smoke, offering his open hand.

dialog: 
text: Hiccup and Toothless follow Valka and Cloudjumper over a

dialog: 
text: Hiccup peers over his shoulder to see that a thick flock of

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Hey, I thought we were going to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VALKA
dialog: (with a mischievous grin)
dialog: Oh, we are.
dialog: 
text: She directs his gaze below, where in the choppy water of the
text: fjord, a group of Seashocker dragons are corralling a dense
text: shoal of fish near the surface.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, the Bewilderbeast rises from deep below, scooping
text: the fish up in its vast mouth as its tusks break the surface.
text: It breaches just below Hiccup and Toothless, giving them a
text: fright before spitting the fish into the air and crashing
text: back down into the sea.
dialog: 
text: Valka laughs at Hiccup's surprise as the hungry dragons race

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: And from Dragon Island, I found
dialog: this archipelago...
dialog: 
text: He looks up to see that Valka is no longer next to him, but

dialog: explored.

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WINDSWEPT CLIFF - LATER
dialog: 
text: Valka and Hiccup rise on their dragons, carried skyward by a
text: strong coastal wind that thrusts vertical up shoreline cliff.
dialog: 
text: One by one, dragons leap from the cliff and catch the strong
text: updraft, popping their wings open like kites. They ride the
text: wind and orbit around each other in a colorful, mesmeric
text: dance. It's clearly a form of dragon play.
dialog: 
text: Hiccup, lifted off of his saddle by the force of the wind,
text: laughs giddily as he watches Valka walk across Cloudjumper's
text: wing and onto several others, dragon-hopping from one to
text: another, until she gracefully crosses Toothless from wing tip
text: to wing tip. She then drops out of sight, reappearing a
text: moment later standing atop Cloudjumper. Hiccup is in utter
text: awe of her.
dialog: 
text: Valka breathes in the frigid air. Lets it out blissfully.

speaker_heading: VALKA
dialog: This is what it is to be a dragon,
dialog: Hiccup.
dialog: 
text: Hiccup LOCKS the pedals in the flared tail position and
text: unbuckles himself. Valka watches, curious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: It's all well and good to call
dialog: yourself a dragon.
dialog: 
text: Hiccup RUNS OFF of Toothless, pulling his stowed wings.

dialog: But can you fly?

dialog: 
text: Valka GASPS, astonished. She flies her dragon alongside him,

dialog: 
text: ... Hiccup SOARS, riding the wild air currents like an eagle,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh no. Toothless!
dialog: 
text: But, with his tail locked, Toothless can't make the tight

dialog: 
text: Realizing that they're in trouble, Valka and Cloudjumper pour
text: on the speed. All four of them collide just as they reach the

dialog: snow.
dialog: 
text: They all TOPPLE head over tail to a messy landing on the wind-
text: swept ridge and pop up LAUGHING.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Man! Almost! We just about had it
dialog: that time!
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VALKA
dialog: Incredible.
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Well, not bad yourself.

dialog: And where was I?
speaker_heading: (REMORSEFUL)

text: crack, split and extend, forming a pronounced, aerodynamic
text: `V' down the length of his back and tail.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VALKA (CONT'D)
dialog: Now you can make those tight turns.
dialog: 
text: Toothless shudders, as if experiencing a much-needed
text: chiropractic adjustment. He bounds over to Hiccup, giddily
text: retracting and splaying his dorsal blades like a kid with a
dialog: new toy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Did YOU know about this?
dialog: 
text: Valka smiles, delighting in their mutual amazement.

speaker_heading: VALKA (CONT'D)
dialog: And I'll show them all to you.
dialog: We'll unlock every mystery, find

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: That sounds... amazing.

speaker_heading: VALKA (CONT'D)
dialog: Now come on, we should be getting

dialog: 
text: Hookfang HISSES a warning, but Drago approaches, undaunted.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: As the blast ends, Drago drops the cloak, closing in and
text: holding a cold stare. Hookfang lets out a ferocious ROAR.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Hookfang stirs, his aggression fading in the face of Drago's

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAGO
dialog: The alpha! Now we have a fight!
dialog: 
text: Valka blasts overhead on Cloudjumper, commanding swarms of
text: dragons to swoop down and attack Drago's army. A swarm of
text: Zipplebacks set themselves aflame and roll like fiery wagon
text: wheels through the battlefield, scattering soldiers and
text: destroying war machines.
dialog: 
text: One of them gets CAUGHT under a Dragon Swatter, but Hiccup
text: and Toothless double-back for a rescue.
dialog:

dialog: There! Come on, Toothless! Show

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Thatta boy!
dialog: 
text: BACK TO VALKA, on Cloudjumper as they pry Drago's armored

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAGO
dialog: I've waited a long time for this!
dialog: 
text: Drago cocks his bull hook, ready to strike, but Valka

dialog: Then it's a good thing I brought a

dialog: 
text: He turns to the flagship and YELLS savagely, whirling his

dialog: 
text: The heavy chains are released. The underwater creature, now
text: freed, breaks the surface in an epic cascade of seawater. It
text: rises toward the shoreline, revealing itself to be...
dialog: 
text: A SECOND BEWILDERBEAST -- bigger, meaner, and covered in
text: scars that indicate years of training and abuse. The chains
text: fall away from iron cuffs fastened to its massive tusks.

speaker_heading: DRAGO

speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: It takes more than a little fire to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOBBER
dialog: Stoick!
dialog: 
text: Stoick catches it and lands a direct hit on Drago.
dialog: 
text: But, with a devastating SWIPE, DRAGO's Bewilderbeast takes

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VALKA
dialog: No!

speaker_heading: STOICK
dialog: No!
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: STOICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Hold on!

dialog: Dragons are kind, amazing creatures

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAGO (CONT'D)
dialog: You see, I know what it is to live

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAGO

speaker_heading: STOICK

speaker_heading: (PANICKED)

dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Drago points to Toothless. The Bewilderbeast stares and

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: Toothless? You okay, bud? What's
dialog: going on?
dialog: 
text: Toothless fights the command, shaking his head in protest.
text: The Bewilderbeast insists, with a mesmerizing glare and a
text: low, throaty grumble... until Toothless finally succumbs to
text: its control. He raises his head, his stare vacant and
text: robotic, as his pupils turn to slits.
dialog: 
text: Drago then points to Hiccup. The Bewilderbeast responds,
text: HISSING again at Toothless.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAGO
dialog: Witness true strength. The strength

dialog: 
text: Toothless opens his yawning mouth. Gas seeps from his throat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: DAD! NO!

dialog: 
text: Stoick leaps in front of it, shoving Hiccup out of the way

text: the ice with great impact.
dialog: 
text: ON VALKA, hearing the blast, horrified.
dialog: 
text: Drago glances back, seeing Stoick laying lifeless in the
text: aftermath, pleased by the sudden turn of events. He shuffles
text: off, satisfied.
dialog: 
text: Stunned, Hiccup comes to and sees Stoick in the rubble. He
text: rushes past the still-entranced Toothless, straining to
text: scatter the ice boulders on top of Stoick's body.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Dad!
dialog: 
text: Valka arrives, winded and aghast.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VALKA
dialog: Stoick...

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: No... you...
dialog: 
text: Gobber, Astrid, Eret, and the Gang arrive, slack-jawed.
dialog: 
text: Satisfied, the Bewilderbeast turns away, releasing Toothless

speaker_heading: VALKA
dialog: It's not his fault. You know that.
dialog:

dialog: What?
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Suddenly, a SHEEP appears in its sight, rising and falling

dialog: 
text: It looks down to see Eret catching the falling sheep and

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAGO
dialog: No!
dialog:

speaker_heading: HICCUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah! We did it!
dialog: 
text: They arc through the sky and LAND a few paces from Drago,

dialog: 
text: Battered and weary, Drago reaches for his bullhook. Hiccup
text: extends and fires up his Dragon Blade, hurling it like a

dialog:

dialog: Oh, no!
scene_heading: HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 92.
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: No! No...

dialog: 
text: A BLAST thunders from inside the ice, SHATTERING it.
text: Toothless emerges from the debris, revealing Hiccup curled

dialog: 
text: Toothless is steaming, his black skin glowing blue with rage,
text: his split dorsal blades searing with blue heat, a glow
text: emanating from his flared nostrils.
dialog: 
text: He turns back to Hiccup, to check if he's unharmed, then

text: ferociously.
dialog: 
text: The Bewilderbeast bellows back at this affront. Toothless
text: unleashes a salvo of plasma into the Bewilderbeast's face,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HICCUP
dialog: He's challenging the alpha!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VALKA
dialog: To protect you.

dialog: 
text: The alpha thrashes his tusks through the ice, trying to smash
text: Toothless, but he deftly spring from spire to spire,

dialog: 
text: In the midst of the mayhem, the horde of commandeered dragons
text: -- both Berk's and Valka's -- break free from the control to
text: witness Toothless' retaliation.
dialog: 
text: Toothless lands protectively by Hiccup and Valka, commanding

dialog: 
text: He hammers the Bewilderbeast, spurring it into a charge.

text: charge. Suddenly, Skullcrusher fires. Followed by another,
dialog: and another.
dialog: 
text: Hiccup looks around, amazed to see the flock of dragons

dialog: 
text: Drago is forced to hide from the fiery barrage by taking

speaker_heading: DRAGO (CONT'D)
dialog: FIGHT! BLAST THEM!
dialog: 
text: His prosthetic arm is blasted clean off by one of his own

dialog: 
text: The Bewilderbeast rears back to cover them all in ice, but
text: Toothless lets loose a powerful shot. The Bewilderbeast's

dialog: 
text: As the smoke clears, one of its massive TUSKS FALLS to the

dialog: 
text: As the smoke clears, Hiccup and Toothless see nothing but

dialog: 
text: Toothless hops down from the spire, cooling off, as people

dialog: 
text: All of the dragons -- Berk's, Valka's, even Drago's -- land
