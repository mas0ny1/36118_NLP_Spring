scene_heading: 1 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - DAY. 1
text: Winter. Silence on the forest floor. Snow falling. Then the
text: sound of breathing. The soft footfall of a person running.
text: HANNA, fourteen years old, long hair, eyes like blue ice,
text: glides through the trees, a bow strapped to her shoulder. She
text: is dressed in animal skins and fur shoes. She blends almost
text: completely into the landscape of trees and snow.
text: She stops dead. Her breath visible in the freezing air.
text: Suddenly alert, she has spotted her prey. A REINDEER nuzzling
text: the snow, trying to unearth a patch of grass to eat. Its head
text: pops up - danger. Too late. The sudden swoosh and the snap of
text: an arrow piercing its skin.
text: The deer flops to the ground with a thud. It whines, its feet
text: dig at the earth. Its mouth gnaws at the icy air. Steam
text: pouring from its nostrils.
text: HANNA approaches, removes a fur glove. She bends to her
dialog: knees.
text: She reaches out and gently pets the animals frightened face.
text: She runs her hand down along its neck, in towards the wound.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I just missed your heart.
text: She stands and pulls out an old pistol from her waist
text: holster.
text: She fires two shots directly at CAMERA.
scene_heading: CUT TO TITLE: HANNA
scene_heading: 2 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - LATER. 2
text: A knife enters the deer near its anus.
speaker_heading: HANNA
speaker_heading: (WHISPER)
dialog: Remove the penis and scrotum, make
text: a deep, circular cut around the
dialog: rectum.
text: HANNA pulls the knife up towards the brisket.
speaker_heading: HANNA (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (WHISPER)
text: Cut from the rear to the brisket.
text: She works calmly without expression.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
scene_heading: 3 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - LATER 3
text: The deer lies on it's side.
text: HANNA breaths hard. She reaches deep into the body cavity
text: and pulls out intestine, stomach, liver.
text: She freezes, sensing danger.
text: Her hand deep inside the animal. She listens. She looks out
text: into the still forest. No sound.
text: ERIK, mid forties, a mammoth with leathery face, stands
text: behind her like a ghost.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: You're dead. Right now. I've
dialog: killed you.
text: HANNA spins spraying deer-blood on to the snow and brings
text: her fist right to ERIK's face. He blocks and thumps an open
text: palm on to HANNA's shoulder sending her sprawling into the
dialog: snow.
text: She leaps to her feet, as ERIK aims a kick at her head. She
text: dodges, punches below his knee cap, and goes for her
text: pistol. ERIK slaps the hand away.
speaker_heading: ERIK (CONT'D)
dialog: Use your hands!
text: She goes for the gun again and again he stops her.
text: He moves in tight, pulling the gun from its holster and
text: tossing it deep into the forest.
text: HANNA clips ERIK'S temple sending him to the ground.
text: She wraps her arms around his neck preparing to snap...
dialog: ... but she can't.
text: He throws her over his shoulder into a pile of snow.
text: ERIK stands and wipes the snow from his pants. His face shows
text: a touch of frustration.
text: He plods into the forest.
speaker_heading: ERIK (CONT'D)
dialog: Drag it back yourself.
text: HANNA drags herself to the deer's side. She stares at its
text: dead face.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
scene_heading: 4 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - LATER 4
text: HANNA clears the kill site. Wipes the last dots of blood on
text: to a stick. No sign she was ever there.
scene_heading: 5 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - EVENING 5
text: HANNA drags the 200 lb deer on a makeshift sled. She lifts
text: her knees high and moves at a steady pace.
text: Hidden among the trees, a little way off, ERIK is watching
dialog: her.
scene_heading: 6 EXT. LOG CABIN. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - EVENING 6
text: A log cabin built around an ancient tree surrounded by the
text: thick forest. HANNA is standing in the snow, stripping the
text: deer with a knife. It's a tough job but she does it no fuss.
scene_heading: 7 INT. LOG CABIN - EVENING 7
dialog: Almost everything ERIK and HANNA own they've made themselves
text: using what can be found in the forest. What few possessions
dialog: that have been brought in from the outside world are old and
dialog: worn.
text: HANNA is making a fire using a bow drill. The friction of the
text: drill produces an ember which HANNA carefully transfers to
text: some dried leaves.
scene_heading: 8 INT. LOG CABIN - LATER 8
text: HANNA and ERIK sit either side of a small fire, still dressed
dialog: in furs.
text: HANNA swirls a spoon around in a dish of stew. ERIK takes a
text: mouthful, watches HANNA not eating.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: What's wrong? Are you hurt?
text: She keeps swirling her spoon.
speaker_heading: ERIK (CONT'D)
dialog: You were half asleep.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I'll do better next time.

dialog: Did you really want me to snap your
dialog: neck?
text: He looks at her - drops the quiz.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: How much did you pull off the deer?
speaker_heading: HANNA
text: A hundred and twenty with scraps.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: About 200 pounds in total?
text: HANNA nods.
speaker_heading: ERIK (CONT'D)
dialog: That explains it.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: How you beat me. You're getting
dialog: strong.
text: HANNA almost blushes.
text: ERIK stands to put his bowl away.

scene_heading: 9 INT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - NIGHT 9
text: HANNA is in bed under fur covers listening while ERIK reads
text: to her from an old encyclopedia.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: The Great Blue Whale is the largest
dialog: animal to have ever existed. A blue
text: whale's tongue weighs over two and
text: a half tons and its mouth is large
dialog: enough to hold 90 tons of food and
dialog: water.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: How much is that?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: It's bigger than the cabin. Its
dialog: heart weighs thirteen
dialog: hundred pounds and a male has seven
text: gallons of testicles.
text: HANNA smirks.
speaker_heading: ERIK (CONT'D)
text: The Blue Whale's "music" can be
text: heard for over 500 miles.
text: He shuts the book.
speaker_heading: ERIK (CONT'D)
dialog: Time for sleep.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Good night.
text: He stands by her bed looking down at her.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Did you forget something?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: No.
text: ERIK takes HANNA'S gun out of his pocket and puts it on the
text: table next to her bed.
speaker_heading: HANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Good night.
text: He walks to the door. HANNA stops him with a question.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: What's music like?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: It's difficult to explain.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Try.
text: He opens the encyclopedia again, leafs through the pages and
dialog: reads.
speaker_heading: ERIK
speaker_heading: (READING)
text: âMusic. A combination of sounds
dialog: with a view to beauty of form and
dialog: expression of emotion'.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: But how does it feel?
text: Erik is not equipped to answer such esoteric questions.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Good. It feels good. It's, uh,
dialog: nice.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Tell me properly. Can you play
dialog: music?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Your mother could. She used to sing
dialog: very well.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I'd like to hear it for myself.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: You will soon enough.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: How soon?
text: Erik looks away from her questioning eyes.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: When you're ready.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I'm ready. I'm ready already.
text: They look at each other- he weighs it up.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Just go to sleep now. I'll see you
text: in the morning.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
text: Hanna covers herself in an animal skin as ERIK pulls a wattle
text: screen across her bed, strokes her hair gently for a moment
text: and leaves the room.
text: HANNA reaches under her bed and takes out an old battered
text: photograph, taken 15 years ago, of a YOUNG WOMAN with eyes
text: like hers - her MOTHER, JOANNA ZADEK.
scene_heading: 10 EXT. LOG CABIN - MORNING 10
text: The morning sunlight slants through the forest.
text: ERIK is walking through the trees. He stops, raises his
text: pistol at a tree trunk some distance away and fires.
text: The tree breaks apart.
scene_heading: 11 INT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - MORNING 11
text: HANNA wakes with the sound of the GUNSHOT. She is still
text: holding her mothers photgraph.
text: HANNA pushes the photograph under her mattress and climbs out
dialog: of bed.
scene_heading: 12 EXT. LOG CABIN. SHOOTING RANGE - MORNING 12
text: Another GUNSHOT breaks a tree apart.
text: Hanna fires. Another tree breaks apart. She rolls and
dialog: fires.
text: She rolls and fires. She reloads. And fires.
text: ERIK watching.
scene_heading: 13 EXT. LOG CABIN - DAY 13
text: HANNA attacks ERIK. Hand. Knee. Elbow. Fist. He defends
dialog: easily.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Again.
text: They reset. She repeats the motion. Hand. Knee. Elbow. Fist.
speaker_heading: ERIK (CONT'D)
dialog: Again.
text: Hand. Knee. Elbow. Fist. She's getting faster. Her strikes
dialog: are solid.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
scene_heading: 14 EXT. LOG CABIN - DAY 14
text: A medium size log nailed along two pillars of the cabin
text: acts as a chin-up bar.
text: Erik and Hanna do chin-ups. Both are fit. Neither will give
text: up. ERIK observing HANNA's power. Both have the sense that
text: he is judging her. HANNA's face fiercely determined.
scene_heading: 15 EXT. LOG CABIN - DAY 15
text: ERIK and HANNA sit with their backs to a tree in the huge
text: forest as they breathlessly recover from the exhaustion of
text: the exercise. HANNA speaks fast, reciting.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I live in Leipzig. German city.
dialog: Population 0.7 Million people. We
dialog: live at Number 7 Weissingerplatz. I
dialog: go to school at the Klaus Kohle
dialog: Gymnasium and my best friends are
dialog: Rudi Gunter and Clara Schliess. I
dialog: like literature and sport, in
dialog: particular tennis and athletics. I
dialog: have a dog called Trudi.
scene_heading: 16 EXT. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - DAY 16
text: HANNA is running, racing ERIK. Fierce determination, almost
text: anger in her eyes. They reach the river and dive in.
scene_heading: 17 EXT. RIVER - DAY. 17
text: HANNA and ERIK are swimming hard against the current of the
text: fast-flowing river, working at full pelt just to stay still.
text: They swim and swim, their muscles busting, their lungs
dialog: bursting.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Don't give up! Don't give up!
text: HANNA's arms flails as she fights against the stream and she
text: screams in pain. She is grabbed under by the undertow and is
text: pulled downwards. For a second she is underwater and in
text: darkness but ERIK's hand pulls her back up and she breaks the
text: surface with a gasp of relief.
scene_heading: 18 EXT. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST. RIVER BANK. 18
text: On the bank, HANNA climbs out. ERIK approaches her but
text: moodily, even angrily, she pushes him away.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I didn't need your help.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
text: Her face sullen, she walks away into the forest. He stares
dialog: after her.
scene_heading: 19 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT 19
text: Outside, ERIK stands alone, thinking. An OWL swoops down to
text: catch a mouse then flies back up into the tree tops.
scene_heading: 20 INT. CABIN. HANNA'S ROOM - NIGHT. 20
text: HANNA is asleep.
text: ERIK enters the room.
text: ERIK approaches the bed, and solemnly takes out a pistol and
text: aims it at HANNA. He is tense with expectation.
text: Suddenly HANNA bursts from her covers, smashes the pistol
text: from ERIK's hand and smashes him down on to the bed. She
text: grabs the pistol and points it at his face. She is alert,
text: eyes intense, face proud. She speaks quietly.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I'm ready now.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Maybe.
text: ERIK relaxes. It's a false beat.
text: He lunges again at her, really violently. He seems to be
text: really trying to hurt her.
text: But HANNA has reached under her mattress and there is a flint
text: knife - in an instant it is at ERIK's neck. She pricks his
text: neck slightly. It bleeds just slightly. Stillness and
text: silence. HANNA breathless, angry.
speaker_heading: ERIK (CONT'D)
dialog: You didn't tell me you had a knife.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: You told me to think for myself.
dialog: Isn't that what you want?
text: She is angry for the first time. ERIK does not answer. Just
text: stares at her.
speaker_heading: HANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: I want to see things. I can't stay
dialog: here forever.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: 21 EXT. LOG CABIN - NIGHT 21
text: ERIK takes long lunging strides straight out from the cabin.
text: He counts his paces.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: One, two, three, four...
scene_heading: 22 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - DAY 22
text: ERIK and HANNA are racing through the forest.
text: Over this we continue to hear ERIK counting his paces from
text: the previous scene.
speaker_heading: ERIK (V.O.)
dialog: ...five, six, seven, eight...
scene_heading: 23 EXT. LOG CABIN - NIGHT 23
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: ...nine, ten.
text: After 10 paces, ERIK makes a 90 degree turn and enters the
text: tree line. The snow and mud crunch under his boots.
text: We continue to inter-cut the following with more close-ups of
text: HANNA training: climbing, fighting, chin-ups, shooting. All
text: the while we continue to hear ERIK counting out his paces.
text: After 40 paces, with the cabin light distant, ERIK falls to
text: his knees. He unsheathes a large knife and jams it into the
text: frozen earth.
scene_heading: 24 EXT. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - MORNING 24
text: HANNA comes out of the cabin, rubbing her eyes and yawning,
text: eating a hunk of cold meat.
text: She looks up to see a snow fox staring at her from the tree
text: line. She crouches and holds out what's left of her
dialog: breakfast.
text: The fox approaches gingerly, delicately.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Hello little foxy... foxy loxy...
dialog: come on... come and share my
dialog: breakfast.
text: The fox comes to her and nervously accepts the scrap,
text: withdrawing a few feet to eat it. HANNA shuffles forward
text: carefully and gently pats the snow fox - it is only a cub.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
text: As the fox eats it makes low grunting noises which HANNA
text: expertly mimics - causing the fox to look up, puzzled - they
dialog: seem to have a genuine connection - as if they've done this
dialog: before.
text: Suddenly the snow fox freezes, pricks up its ears, looks up,
text: HANNA looks up too.
text: An aeroplane is approaching overhead. The fox darts back into
text: the undergrowth as the roar of the plane reverberates through
dialog: the forest.
text: HANNA jumps to her feet and with incredible speed and
text: dexterity climbs to the very top of a near by tree. The plane
text: roars over her head and disappears over the snowy wilderness,
text: oblivious to HANNA'S tiny presence.
text: It's only now that we see the full extent of HANNA'S
dialog: isolation.
scene_heading: 25 INT. CABIN - MORNING. 25
text: HANNA enters breathless with excitement. ERIK sits pensively
text: with his back to the door.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Did you see it? Wasn't it
dialog: beautiful, like thunder. I had to
dialog: stick my fingers in my ears it was
dialog: so loud. Did you hear it?
text: She stops, sensing ERIK'S mood.
speaker_heading: HANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: What's wrong?
text: Sitting in front of ERIK is a metal case, caked with frozen
text: dirt. ERIK pops open the case. Inside a tangle of technology.
text: HANNA looks at the case, mesmerized.
speaker_heading: HANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: What does it do?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: It tells Marissa Wiegler where we
dialog: are.
text: He looks at her, a hint of a challenge.
speaker_heading: ERIK (CONT'D)
dialog: When you want to leave here all you
dialog: have to do is flip that switch.
text: She approaches the box and places a single finger on the
text: small red switch.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: ERIK (CONT'D)
dialog: But once it's done, there'll be no
dialog: going back. She'll never give up
dialog: until you're dead, or she is. You
dialog: understand? I wont be there to hold
dialog: your hand. So be sure. Be sure it's
dialog: what you really want.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: You're not scaring me.
text: He looks at her disbelievingly.
text: She shakes her head in protest, but simultaneously moves away
text: from the switch.
text: He softens towards her.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: It's here. There's no rush. Take
dialog: your time.
text: HANNA turns her back on the box, but can't help taking
text: another look at it over her shoulder.
scene_heading: 26 INT. CABIN. HANNA'S ROOM - NIGHT 26
text: HANNA is under the covers again while ERIK reads more from
dialog: the encyclopedia.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Laika, a mongrel dog from the
dialog: streets of Moscow, was the first
dialog: animal to orbit the Earth. She was
text: launched into outer space on the
dialog: third of November, 1957.
dialog: Scientists believed humans would be
dialog: unable to survive conditions of
dialog: outer space, so flights by animals
dialog: were viewed as an experimental
dialog: precursor to human missions. Her
dialog: rocket was not designed to be
dialog: retrievable, and Laika had always
dialog: been intended to die.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: That's sad.
text: ERIK awkwardly turns the page to change subject.
speaker_heading: ERIK
text: When a star collapses the supernova
dialog: explosion is 10 billion times
text: brighter than other stars.
text: HANNA shuts her eyes and tries to imagine how bright that
dialog: might be.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
scene_heading: 27 INT. LOG CABIN - MORNING 27
text: ERIK straps the bow to his chest and grabs a quiver of bolts.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Will you hunt with me?
text: Hanna is sweeping the ground.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: If you want.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: It's up to you.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Me?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Yes.
text: HANNA eyes the box sitting open, it's waiting for her.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I'll stay.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Fine.
text: ERIK leaves abruptly.
text: HANNA continues to sweep the ground, her movements bring her
text: closer to the metal box. She stops sweeping and looks at the
text: box. She turns and walks out of the cabin.
scene_heading: 28 EXT. LOG CABIN - CONTINUOUS 28
text: HANNA comes out of the cabin and sits down on a tree trunk.
text: She sees the snow fox cub but says nothing. It comes over and
text: noses around the cabin, but HANNA'S mind is elsewhere.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: (whispering to herself)
dialog: Marissa Wiegler.
scene_heading: 29 INT. LOG CABIN - CONTINUOUS 29
text: CLOSE ON - the metal box, the switch catches the light from
text: the door as HANNA enters to confront it. The room is still
dialog: and quiet.
text: HANNA approaches the metal box and slowly reaches out her
dialog: hand.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: HANNA
speaker_heading: (WHISPER)
dialog: Come and find me.
text: CLOSE ON - She flips the switch, a little red light begins to
dialog: flash.
text: An ALARM CLOCK begins to ring as we cut to -
scene_heading: 30 INT. MARISSA'S APARTMENT. VIRGINIA. USA - EARLY MORNING 30
text: CLOSE ON - a bedside alarm clock ringing loudly.
text: MARISSA WIEGLER, a handsome woman in her mid-40's with red
text: hair, reaches over and slams the alarm clock off.
text: She's alone in her bed. She always is. She has no children.
dialog: She's made choices in her life and lives without looking
dialog: back.
text: She walks into her ensuite bathroom and looks at herself in
text: the mirror. She collects her toothbrush and bares her teeth
text: in a snarl as she brushes them. Her gums bleed a little.
scene_heading: 31 INT. LOG CABIN - EVENING 31
text: HANNA tends to boiling pots. She's cooking a feast. ERIK
text: enters. He stamps his feet shedding ice at the door.
text: He walks by the box and sees the little red light flickering
text: on. HANNA sees this and sees him smile, but she knows he's
dialog: sad.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: You were lucky to grab that deer.
dialog: There was nothing out there today.
text: ERIK looks over at the meal HANNA is preparing.
speaker_heading: ERIK (CONT'D)
dialog: Smells good.
text: He wraps an arm around her shoulder. They don't hug much and
text: it shows. HANNA is almost defensive and tense. And then the
text: hug is over.
scene_heading: 32 EXT. CIA HQ LANGLEY VIRGINIA - DAY 32
text: MARISSA, wearing a sharp business suit, drives a black Acura
text: into her designated spot in the CIA HQ's car park.

speaker_heading: TECH ONE
dialog: Ma'am. We've had a signal reported
dialog: by Interpol. We think it's Eric
dialog: Heller.
text: An unusual expression of shock on MARISSA'S face.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: Well I'll be.
speaker_heading: TECH ONE
dialog: It seems he's in Sweden. Jokkmokk.
text: 40 miles out.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: What the fuck is he doing there?
speaker_heading: TECH ONE
text: Living in the middle of nowhere,
text: like the frigging Una Bomber.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: The son of a bitch. Sweden?
dialog: Sweden?!
text: The PA hands her a coffee and she hands him some files.
speaker_heading: TECH ONE
dialog: Apparently he turned on his
dialog: locator.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: He's not an idiot.
speaker_heading: TECH ONE
dialog: I know... I mean I believe so. But
dialog: that's what happened.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: After 14 years in Jokkmokk, maybe
dialog: he'd rather go to prison.
scene_heading: 33 INT. LOG CABIN - NIGHT 33
text: ERIK is leaning over a pail of water, cutting his beard off
text: with a knife.
speaker_heading: MARISSA (V.O.)
dialog: Eric Heller. From the Czech
dialog: Republic. I recruited him in 1991
dialog: when they were all joining the
dialog: Velvet Revolution and sticking it
dialog: to the commies
text: ERIK, now clean shaven, opens a wooden case in the corner of
text: the room and takes out an old folded three piece suit and
dialog: rolled shirt.
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: MARISSA (V.O.)
dialog: He couldn't wait to kiss some

scene_heading: 34 INT. VIDEO CONFERENCE ROOM, LANGLEY. 34
text: MARISSA sits in a video conference room surrounded by worried
text: looking faces, with her are her close advisors WALT and BOB.
text: She's also speaking into a microphone on the table in front
dialog: of her.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: Trouble was he had his own way of
dialog: doing things. Kinda paranoid.
text: WALT fires up a computer screen and logs on. He uses an
text: access code. This takes him to a new file. He enters the
text: tracking device number. A name comes up. ERIK HELLER.
text: He clicks on a link. HELLER's face pops on to the screen.
speaker_heading: MARISSA (CONT'D)
dialog: Not a team player. Not a âjoiner.â
dialog: He became increasingly isolated and
text: disturbed. Kept mouthing off about
dialog: classified programmes.
text: WALT clicks on a link to a newspaper article which comes on
text: to the screen: The headline: POLICE HUNT FOR MURDER SUSPECT.
text: A picture of Heller in the article and a smashed car on a
text: rural road. The two men stare at his face.
speaker_heading: MARISSA (CONT'D)
dialog: I kept warning and he kept getting
dialog: worse. In the summer of 1995 he
dialog: took his girlfriend, Johanna Zadek,
dialog: on a trip to the Baltic coast and
text: blew her head off.
text: WALT hits a new link: A still of the same young woman as the

text: HANNA is sweating, exhausted, blinking in the darkness,

text: The gradient has got steeper and she starts to slide
text: backwards on the smooth metal surface. She digs her fingers
text: into the rivets joining the plates of stainless steel, trying
dialog: to get a purchase.
text: She summons the last of her strength and reaches a crest. She
text: rests a moment, then hauls herself over the crest and
text: immediately starts sliding... she tumbles, gathering pace,
text: falling down a long chute into the blackness. She has no idea
text: where she is or what's happening, but she's covering a lot of
dialog: ground.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 31.
text: She hits the bottom with a crunch and cries out.
text: When she opens her eyes she sees more tunnel - and at the end
text: light. She crawls quickly towards it and stops at a kind of
text: manhole cover with a sprung lever - she wrenches the lever
text: and pushes against it. After a little effort the cover gives
text: way and light floods in, blinding her.
text: HANNA recovers and tentatively pokes her head out into:
scene_heading: 81 EXT. MOROCCO/DESERT. CONT. 81
text: BLAZING SUN - HANNA's pale face appears, eyes crinkled shut.
text: Wider - HANNA emerges from a hole in the ground in the middle
text: of a sandblasted desert and slams the cover closed. Total
text: silence now, except for the whistle of the wind on sand. It
text: takes her eyes a moment to adjust to the blinding light.
text: Blearily she looks out across this alien environment.
text: After a moment her ears prick up. She turns just in time to
text: see a column of Military Jeeps rise over a sand dune in the
text: distance behind her. The jeeps are crawling straight towards
text: her, ominously shimmering in the desert heat. She quickly
text: ducks back down into her rabbit hole and waits.
scene_heading: 82 EXT. MOROCCAN DESERT 82
text: In the middle of the desert the soldiers convene, looking for
text: HANNA. A military truck is stationery. Nothing around for

scene_heading: 83 EXT. MOROCCAN DESERT. DAY. 83
text: The truck moves off a short distance and stops again.
text: Meanwhile a large convoy of Military Vehicles passes right
text: over HANNA. When it has past she sees the first vehicle
text: crawling to a halt right near the hole - just yards away.
text: One of the MILITARY PERSONNEL in the jeep gets out and goes
text: over to the hole, lifts the lid, inspects the darkness.

speaker_heading: MILITARY VOICE

speaker_heading: BANKS.
dialog: I'm at a perimeter opening at the
dialog: far east wing. Something's not

text: He doesn't notice but the lid is open now and the air-

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: As the Jeep moves off we see HANNA is clinging to the axle,
text: hanging upside down underneath. Her face is pressed to the
text: oily metal, her back just an inch from the desert floor
text: flashing beneath her.
text: The jeeps now take a track along the edge of a steep dune.
text: HANNA takes her chance and lets go of her grip. She clenches
text: her eyes shut as the jeep passes over her. As soon as the
text: jeeps clears she rolls herself over the edge of the dune.
text: HANNA rolls down the sand dune at speed until finally she

scene_heading: 84 INT. MARISSA'S APARTMENT. VIRGINIA. USA - NIGHT 84
text: MARISSA moves between her wardrobe and a suitcase packing
text: clothes, underwear, another power suit.
text: Fully packed she goes to the back of the wardrobe and pulls
text: aside some dresses to reveal a hidden safe. She keys in the
text: security code, the safe door opens and from the back of the

text: MARISSA looks at the files title in large blunt letters:

scene_heading: 85 EXT. FOREST ROAD - FLASHBACK 85
text: FLASHBACK to 1995.
text: A much younger MARISSA watching a very fast-moving car on a
text: deserted forest road. She takes from her pocket a small
text: detonating device and as the car approaches a bend, presses
dialog: it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 33.
text: There is a small explosion and the car swerves off the road
text: and smashes headlong into a post. The horn starts to blare.
text: MARISSA approaches the car. The road is empty. MARISSA looks
text: through binoculars at the car.
text: She sees a woman, on the passenger side, head thrust forward.
text: JOHANNA ZADEK. Blood everywhere. MARISSA shoots her in the
text: head just to be sure. But the driver's seat is empty. MARISSA
text: stops dead.
text: Then the back door opens on the other side. A man, a younger
text: ERIK HELLER crawls out. He is holding a two year old child in
text: his hands. The child's coat is covered in blood.
text: MARISSA stares at the shocked child and takes the rifle to
text: her eye to shoot again. As she does, ERIK senses her movement
text: and throws himself to the ground.
text: Through the rifle viewfinder we see just a glimpse of ERIK
text: and the red glare of the coat covered in blood, ERIK HELLER
text: grabbing the child and sprinting for the forest,
text: MARISSA taking aim at HELLER, and then firing as HELLER dives
text: into the forest.
scene_heading: 86 INT. MARISSA'S APARTMENT. VIRGINIA. USA - NIGHT 86
scene_heading: PRESENT DAY.
text: MARISSA puts on a pair of rubber kitchen gloves and sets fire

dialog: mop.
scene_heading: 87 EXT. MOROCCAN DESERT - LATER 87
text: The sun has dipped a little now, the shadows of the dunes are
text: longer, but the heat is still intense.
text: HANNA's throat is parched by the dry heat, her pale eyes
text: scorched by the angry sun. She walks purposefully but with a
text: growing awareness of her tiny scale in this seemingly endless
dialog: sea of sand. She has no conception of this landscape, no idea
dialog: where she might be.
speaker_heading: HANNA
speaker_heading: (MUTTERING)

text: HANNA climbs a steep dune, eyes down, feet pounding. A shadow
text: falls across her path and she looks up to see the shape of a
text: GIRL standing at the top of the dune silhouetted by the sun.
text: HANNA's hand goes to the concealed gun.
text: The GIRL stares at HANNA. They must be about the same age
text: but there the resemblance ends. HANNA, dusty, bloodied and
text: bruised in military top, trousers and boots stares at this
text: perfect image of western adolescence. Dressed head to toe
text: in pink and drinking a can of coke, no concession to where
dialog: she is whatsoever. This is SOPHIE LYALL.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Hello.
text: HANNA stares at her, then abruptly turns to walk in opposite
text: direction until she sees another convoy of US military trucks
text: in the distance.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE (CONT'D)
dialog: All right?
text: HANNA turns back. Looks at SOPHIE. Like a wary animal.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't you speak English?
text: HANNA is unsure how to speak to this strange person.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE (CONT'D)
dialog: That can't be helped. You look
dialog: terrible.
text: At that moment SOPHIE'S brother, MILES, eight years old,
text: rises over the dune and stands by SOPHIE'S side. In his hand
text: is a stills camera, not digital, film. MILES stares at HANNA
text: while talking to SOPHIE.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Who's she?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I don't know. I just found her.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What's her name?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE

speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I also have a dog called Trudi.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: We had a dog called Vincent, but he

speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I'm Sophie and this is my brother,

text: From over the dune comes the voice of SOPHIE and MILES'S
text: mother, RACHEL LYALL.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (O.S.)
dialog: Come on, Sophie! We'll miss the
dialog: light.
text: MILES raises his camera to his eye and snaps a picture of
speaker_heading: HANNA.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Bye.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: See you.
text: SOPHIE takes one more puzzled look at HANNA, then turns and
text: disappears over the sand dune.
text: HANNA rises to the top of the dune. SOPHIE turns back to
speaker_heading: HANNA.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you need a lift somewhere?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: No. I prefer to walk.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE

speaker_heading: MARISSA

speaker_heading: LEWIS

speaker_heading: MARISSA

speaker_heading: LEWIS (O.O.V)

speaker_heading: AIR STEWARD

speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: I'm in conference.
speaker_heading: AIR STEWARD
dialog: All the same -
speaker_heading: MARISSA

scene_heading: 89 EXT. DESERT/OASIS TOWN - DUSK 89
text: HANNA walking along the side of a tarmac desert road,
text: approaching a dusty oasis town.
text: HANNA enters the outskirts, teaming with scooters, trucks,
text: taxis, mules and goats. The impact knocks HANNA backwards,
text: assailed by the smells of dried fruit, meat tagines, couscous
text: cooking at market stalls, fresh fish and meat, still bloody
text: and twitching, hanging in the sun for the flies. She listens
text: to the babble of Arabic, her ears, nose and eyes sensitive to
text: every conversation and twitch of life. It all overpoweringly
text: exotic and visceral to her.
text: An old broken-backed woman inches her way to market. HANNA
text: stares at her in astonishment. Her wrinkled skin.
text: She eyes the abundance of animals - animals she's never seen
text: before in her life: Chickens. Goats. A camel, which Hanna
text: finds bizarre and hilarious.
scene_heading: 90 INT. CENTRE OF TOWN/NIGHT MARKET - EVENING 90
text: HANNA finds a stall with simple cotton clothing. She chooses
text: some cheap clothes and unseen goes around the back of the
text: stall. She changes out of her ragged old clothes into her new
dialog: clothes.
text: HANNA sees MILES running through the crowds carrying a bag of
dialog: cherries.
text: She follows him a little way, onto a busy street with hotels
dialog: and cheap jewellery stores.
text: He runs up the steps and enters a small mid-range hotel.
text: HANNA looks up at the hotel, then enters.
scene_heading: 91 INT. MOROCCAN HOTEL RECEPTION - EVENING 91
text: HANNA stands at the reception desk. A kindly looking HOTEL

speaker_heading: HANNA.
speaker_heading: HOTEL OWNER
dialog: Where's your family?
dialog:

speaker_heading: HANNA

speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Morocco. Capital city Rabat. Places

dialog: Religion Islam. Language Arabic
dialog: (in Arabic w/ English
speaker_heading: SUBTITLES)

scene_heading: 92 INT. MOROCCAN HOTEL BEDROOM - EVENING 92

speaker_heading: HOTEL OWNER
dialog: It's the best we've got.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Thank you.

speaker_heading: HANNA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: HOTEL OWNER
dialog: Of course. All mod cons.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: It's electricity?
text: The HOTEL OWNER looks at HANNA askance.
speaker_heading: HOTEL OWNER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I know a little bit about
dialog: electricity. They say Edison
dialog: discovered it, or was it Franklin?
speaker_heading: HOTEL OWNER
dialog: Some American, I'm sure.
text: He picks up an electric kettle.
speaker_heading: HOTEL OWNER (CONT'D)
dialog: Electric kettle for the English -
dialog: they like to make their own tea.
text: He switches it on, Hanna stares as it heats up noisily.
text: He goes to a small wall mounted TV, switches it on for her, a
text: fuzzy, terrible picture of an Arabic TV show. HANNA is
text: fascinated, doesn't take her eyes off the TV as she sits on
text: the edge of the bed.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: HOTEL OWNER
dialog: It's the best we can do.
text: She stares at the picture, bemused.
speaker_heading: HOTEL OWNER (CONT'D)
dialog: Where do you come from?
text: Distracted, HANNA is caught off guard.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: The forest.
text: The HOTEL OWNER smiles, himself a little puzzled by this
text: strange encounter, and leaves.
text: She just sits there staring at the TV as it's volume seems to
dialog: increase.
text: Meanwhile the electric kettle begins to boil. Steam pours
text: from its spout and the whole contraption starts to rattle
dialog: violently.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 40.
text: HANNA gets up and approaches the kettle very warily. She
text: tries the light switch in an attempt to stop the kettle, but
text: it keeps boiling and making its strange rattle. HANNA tries
text: another switch, the ceiling fan begins to turn, confusing
text: HANNA even more.
text: On the TV the news shows footage of war in the Middle East,
text: the sound of gunfire.
text: The ceiling fan is at its top speed, it's blades cut the air
text: like a helicopter.
text: A telephone beside the bed starts to ring.
text: Combined the noises rise to a terrifying crescendo.
text: HANNA backs away towards the bathroom. She stumbles and falls
text: through the bathroom door straight into the shower,
text: inadvertently turning the taps on. Water pours down on her.
text: HANNA springs up and turns to face the stream of water as if
text: it were an attacker. She runs back into the bedroom.
text: In the bedroom the kettle is still having a violent tantrum,
text: the TV is still screaming, the fan still cutting, the phone
text: still shouting.
text: HANNA pulls at the exit door, but doesn't know to turn the
text: handle. She panics. Smashes at the door. Eventually she falls
text: through the door and into the corridor.
scene_heading: 93 INT. MOROCCAN HOTEL CORRIDOR - EVENING 93
text: Silence as HANNA sits on the corridor floor catching her

speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Did you walk here?
speaker_heading: MILES

speaker_heading: LEWIS (O.S.)
dialog: The Swedish borders are sealed. I

speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: I don't want any bad news Lewis.
dialog: Neither of us can afford a fuck up.
text: MARISSA hangs up. She enters a converted car park which is
text: now a lap dancing bar. It's early in the day and the patrons
text: are as scarce as the clothes on the dancers.
text: At the far end of the room is the reason Marissa is there,
text: MICHAEL ISAACS. Mid fifties. Rumpled suit, bleary, unshaven
text: and drinking a scotch.
text: ISAACS smiles coldly at MARISSA.
speaker_heading: ISAACS
dialog: I didn't think they let women in
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: They let them in, they just don't
dialog: let them get dressed.

speaker_heading: MARISSA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MARISSA

speaker_heading: ISAACS

speaker_heading: MARISSA

speaker_heading: MARISSA (CONT'D)
text: Erik Heller's still alive.
text: ISAACS glances up from his drink.
speaker_heading: ISAACS
dialog: You don't say.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: There's more.
text: MARISSA passes him a newspaper. He opens it. Hidden inside is

speaker_heading: ISAACS (IRONIC)
dialog: Wow. All grown up.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: He did a good job.
speaker_heading: ISAACS
dialog: Did she turn out like you hoped?
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: She just tried to kill me.
speaker_heading: ISAACS
dialog: Isn't it always the way?
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: The fuck does that mean?
speaker_heading: ISAACS
dialog: You bring them into this world,
dialog: teach them how to kill and maim...
dialog: and then they turn against you.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: I didn't teach her.
speaker_heading: ISAACS
dialog: No, it's better than that. You bred

text: MARISSA turns to the BARMAN and signals for a round of the
dialog: scotches, âTwo of these...â
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: Here's the problem: She thinks we

text: He smiles wryly.
speaker_heading: ISAACS
dialog: Just get her sectioned or
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: Sure, just as soon as she's done
dialog: breaking peoples necks. You get her
dialog: sectioned, if you can catch her.
text: The drinks arrive, MARISSA drinks.
speaker_heading: MARISSA (CONT'D)
dialog: Right now she's in Morocco but
dialog: she'll be trying to get out of the
dialog: country. Find her and bring her to
dialog: me. Quietly.
speaker_heading: ISAACS
dialog: I'll need funds.
text: MARISSA slides an envelope of bills across the table.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: Don't spend it all on candy.
text: She glances meaningfully at the STRIPPERS, who have been

text: ISAACS watches closely every car that approaches the ferry
text: from behind his dark glasses.
text: He sees the FAMILY have joined a cue of vehicles and are
text: having their papers checked. Then they're waved on board. He
text: scrutinises them but has no reason to suspect anything.
scene_heading: 106 INT. FERRY CAR DECK. - DAY 106
text: Cars are parking, their headlights on in the dark hull, horns
text: blowing, FERRY GUARDS directing people to parking spaces -
text: it's chaos.
text: SEB parks the van with some difficulty, complaining all the
dialog: while.
speaker_heading: SEB
dialog: Typical. Get me back to the
dialog: European Union.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Don't be rude.
dialog: They get out, taking with them anything they might need -
text: knapsacks, computer games, suit cases.
text: They head off towards the stairs up to the decks, passing
text: ISAACS on their way.
text: ISAACS searches between the cars and trucks.
text: He passes the back of the FAMILY'S van as the camera pushes

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 49.
scene_heading: 107 INT. VAN/FERRY CAR DECK - DAY 107
text: Inside, the van is as the family left it, but the bench seats
text: around the breakfast table are disturbed. One has been opened
text: out, the lid taken off, the mattress strewn on the floor -
text: inside is a big storage space where HANNA has evidently
text: hidden... The crowbar has been discarded there.
text: HANNA is trying to get out. She tries the back door but its
dialog: locked.
text: She climbs over the seats and climbs into the front cabin,
text: the driver's seat. She finds a lock on the door and unlocks.
text: She climbs out.
scene_heading: 108 EXT. LOWER FERRY DECK - DAY 108
text: HANNA walks out on deck and sees the sea, the sight of it
text: takes her breath away. She walks to the railings and looks
text: over the edge. Then up at the seagulls following the boat.
text: A little way off the FAMILY are sitting eating ice-creams.
text: SOPHIE lies out on a bench sunning herself.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What has got into you? Oh my God,
dialog: look over there.
text: They all look where she is pointing - at HANNA.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: It's her.
speaker_heading: SEB
dialog: You think she... you don't think
dialog: she... Rachel, the sunroof?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You think we should say something?
speaker_heading: SEB
dialog: What's there to say?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Maybe she's in trouble.
speaker_heading: SEB
dialog: Maybe she's a hooker. Or a
dialog: terrorist. There's a lot of them in
dialog: Germany.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Hookers or terrorists?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I'll go over.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: SEB
dialog: Rachel, walk away. I'm insisting

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: SOPHIE and RACHEL approach HANNA and move to positions either

speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: All right?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Did you know that 71 percent of the
dialog: earths surface is covered in water?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: My father thinks you're a stowaway.
dialog: He thinks you broke our sunroof
dialog: too, which puts you in deep shit.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Sophie just - I'll handle this.
speaker_heading: (TO HANNA)
dialog: Where's your father?
dialog: No reply.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I really think it might help if you
dialog: told us the, you know, the truth
dialog: and all that. Have you run away
dialog: from somewhere?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I'm worried about you.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: She said she's fine.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You have to understand this really
dialog: is a problem for us.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: You know what? Why don't I stay
dialog: here with her and you go off and be
dialog: with dad? He's looking kind of
dialog: tense.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: RACHEL rejoins SEB and MILES.
speaker_heading: SEB
dialog: Has she even got a passport?!
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I don't think I handled that very
dialog: well.
speaker_heading: SEB
dialog: How do you know she's not some kind
dialog: of illegal immigrant?
scene_heading: 109 EXT. UPPER FERRY DECK - CONTINUOUS 109
text: ISAACS searches the upper deck. Through the bar on the other
text: side of the ferry he sees one of his men searching the
text: opposite deck.
text: A CHILD knocks into ISAACS and the few photocopied
text: photographs he has of HANNA fall from his pocket and are
text: blown along the deck.
text: ISAACS scrambles to pick-up the photocopies.
scene_heading: 110 EXT. LOWER FERRY DECK - CONTINUOUS 110
text: HANNA and SOPHIE are still standing at the railings. SOPHIE
text: offers HANNA some of her ice-cream.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Would you like some?
text: HANNA looks curiously at the ice-cream.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Please.
text: She tries it.
speaker_heading: HANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: It tastes like music.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: You're so weird, aren't you? Did
dialog: you have a fight with your dad or
dialog: something?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Was it bad?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: No. I won.
text: HANNA studies the sea.
speaker_heading: HANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: Can you help me get home?
text: At that moment one of ISAACS photocopied pictures of HANNA
text: rolls across the deck and catches on the railings.
text: HANNA looks down at it, recognizes herself and quickly
text: pockets it. She looks across the deck, too many people, she
dialog: shouldn't have let herself be so exposed.
speaker_heading: HANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: You could do me a make-over if you
dialog: like?
scene_heading: 111 INT. VAN. FERRY CAR DECK - DAY 111
text: MILES is sitting in the driver's seat, pretending to drive
text: the stationary van.
text: Through the windscreen, RACHEL and SEB can be seen having a
text: heated discussion.
text: In the back, HANNA is changing into some of SOPHIE'S clothes.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: You're pretty. You know that?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Am I?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Of course you are. You've got
dialog: pretty eyes and you're tall. I
dialog: always wanted to be tall. If I were
dialog: a man I might fancy you.
text: She laughs. HANNA responds seriously.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I'm not a man.
text: SOPHIE laughs even more.
text: The door swings open and SEB is standing there with RACHEL,
text: nervous but determined.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: SEB
dialog: Okay, here's the deal. We're going
dialog: to find a way to get you home just
dialog: as soon as we get off this crate.
dialog: But since you don't have a passport
dialog: with you right now, we're just
dialog: going to have to be a bit gorilla.
dialog: Okay?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: We passionately believe it's the
dialog: right thing to do.
text: They don't look sure at all, but SOPHIE puts her arm round
text: HANNA and HANNA returns the gesture, everybody slightly
dialog: embarrassed.
scene_heading: 112 EXT. FERRY PORT ALGECIRAS - DAY 112
text: The FERRY is docked, the huge doors are open and cars are

dialog: checked.
scene_heading: 113 INT. VAN. FERRY CAR DECK. - DAY 113
text: Cars are revving up, manoeuvring and getting ready to
text: disembark.
text: RACHEL is at the drivers wheel while SEB is in the back
text: stripping the cushions from the bench seats to prepare a
dialog: place for HANNA to hide.
text: HANNA waits, breath bated, her arm round SOPHIE's shoulders.
text: On the far side she sees ISAACS enter the deck. She watches
text: him carefully and decides he must be looking for her. She
text: ducks down a little further.
text: RACHEL, looking nervous, turns to HANNA.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You okay honey?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Yes yes I'm ready!
text: ISAACS is getting closer, walking between the cars. The ferry
text: gates are open and the noise subsides.
text: SEB discovers the crowbar, examines it.
speaker_heading: SEB
dialog: Oh Jesus.
text: HANNA grabs it and sticks it back in the box, helps SEB fling
text: cushions aside and gets into the compartment.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 54.
text: SEB grits his teeth.
speaker_heading: SEB (CONT'D)
dialog: Here goes nothing.
text: He shuts the bench seat over HANNA and replaces the cushions
text: just as ISAACS passes the van, sniffing around.
text: SEB gets out of the back and walks around to the front. He
text: passes ISAACS on his way round.
speaker_heading: SEB (CONT'D)
dialog: Excuse me. Sir?
text: ISAACS gets out of the way and SEB gets into the front
text: passenger's seat. RACHEL starts the engine, checks her
dialog: mirrors.
text: SEB eyes ISAACS with some paranoia - although he has no idea
dialog: who he is.
scene_heading: INSIDE HANNA'S HIDE OUT -
text: HANNA lies quietly, her eyes glistening in the dark. She
text: listens, hearing the van disembarking the ferry.
scene_heading: 114 EXT. DANISH COASTLINE - DAY 114
text: Dark rain pours down on to a beach on the Danish coast.
text: A figure struggles to land. Then, like a monster from the
text: deep, ERIK emerges out of the surf. His lungs bursting with
text: the exertion. Water dripping from his body.
text: He collapses for a while then stumbles up the beach. He
text: approaches the beach car park.
text: A POLICE CAR swings into the car park.
text: ERIK tries to run, but it's too late. The POLICE CAR is on
dialog: him.
text: He stops and turns towards the police car.
text: TWO POLICEMEN get out of the car and approach ERIK. He
text: watches them very carefully.
scene_heading: 115 EXT. MOTORWAY/SOUTHERN SPAIN - DAY 115
text: The FAMILY'S van speeds along the E-15 up from the Bay of

scene_heading: 116 INT. VAN - DAY 116

dialog: landscape.
text: Hills are emerging and the land is turning green in the gold
text: evening light.
text: HANNA watches RACHEL unscrew the cap of a water bottle and
text: brings it to SEB'S mouth while he drives. SEB laughs as a
text: little water spills down his front.
text: SOPHIE is listening to an iPOD. HANNA looks at her. SOPHIE
text: takes one earphone out of her own ear and puts it in HANNA's.
scene_heading: 117 INT. MARITIME SECURITY/OFFICE - DAY 117
text: ISAACS shows fake ID to the ferry's frowning SECURITY

scene_heading: 118 INT. MARITIME SECURITY/OFFICE - LATER 118
text: ISAACS is studying CC TV footage of the ferry. He views a

text: boarding the van.
scene_heading: 119 INT. VAN - DAY 119
text: HANNA rests her head on SOPHIE'S shoulder and relaxes for the

text: She starts to nod off... she falls asleep on SOPHIE's
dialog: shoulder.
scene_heading: 120 EXT. DANISH COASTLINE - DAY 120
text: MARISSA walks along the desolate patch of coastline. She
text: approaches a Crime Scene. Dogs, markings on the ground. Two
text: DANISH POLICEMEN lie inert on the pebbles, their throats
text: freshly sliced.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: The Danish authorities are taking
dialog: this very seriously. They've
dialog: doubled the number of officers on
dialog: the ground. We've sent up spotter

speaker_heading: LEWIS (CONT'D)
dialog: They're appealing for witnesses
dialog: through the local media...
text: MARISSA nods and looks out at the roiling grey sea. The
text: reality of ERIK'S determination unnerving her.
speaker_heading: LEWIS (CONT'D)
dialog: You think he really swam it?
text: MARISSA knows he did. She calls over her shoulder as she
text: walks away.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: Keep me posted.
scene_heading: 121 EXT. SPANISH CAMPSITE - DAY 121
text: The campsite is heaving with humanity, thousands of EUROPEAN
text: CAMPERS who have turned the site into what amounts to a
text: shanty town - a small city with its own shops, drainage,
dialog: borders and rules. Families come here from cities across
dialog: Europe and bring their whole lives with them.
text: The LYALL FAMILY van is squeezed in between a GERMAN family
text: walking around in skimpy swimming costumes - and a serious

speaker_heading: RACHEL

speaker_heading: SOPHIE

text: Through the window she can see SOPHIE talking to TWO TEENAGE

scene_heading: 123 EXT. SPANISH CAMPSITE. OFFICE/SHOP. 123

scene_heading: 124 EXT. WOODS NEAR CAMPSITE - DAY 124
text: RACHEL and HANNA are walking in the woods together. Above

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I just feel connected when I'm in
text: the countryside. The city stifles
dialog: me... emotionally, creatively.
text: HANNA'S attention is elsewhere, she's spotted something in
text: the undergrowth.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyway, I was very young when I...
dialog: Seb and I.... He was so impressive.
text: HANNA suddenly runs into the woods.

speaker_heading: HANNA

speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Though quite frankly I don't need
dialog: more digits than I've got right
text: now. Loads. Loads and loads.
text: HANNA watches herself in the mirror. Mascara, eye liner. She
text: licks the lipstick, puzzled. Almost a woman, but it doesn't
dialog: look right on her.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: It's like paint.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Don't lick it off.
text: SOPHIE finishes HANNA's face, looks at her in the mirror.

dialog: You're gorgeous.
scene_heading: 127 EXT. CAMPSITE. NIGHT. 127
text: SOPHIE and HANNA sneak through the campsite together and move

speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I can't walk in this.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: You look hot.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Where are we going?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Shhhhh!

speaker_heading: HANNA

scene_heading: 128 EXT. RAVE AT ROMAN AMPHITHEATRE. NIGHT. 128

text: SOPHIE and HANNA stand at the top of the amphitheatre looking
text: down on the thrilling spectacle, soaking up the bass, the
text: abstract sounds, the sheer volume, the pulsing lights and

text: Many of the crowd seem to be wearing fancy dress. HANNA
text: stares at a girl dressed as a red ladybird.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The girls approach a bar and SOPHIE goes to order. She's

speaker_heading: SOPHIE

dialog: 
dialog: 60.

speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Water only. No booze.
text: Meanwhile HANNA spots FELICIANO, the handsome SPANISH BOY

text: SOPHIE comes back with two bottles of water and hands one to
speaker_heading: HANNA.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: What do they call this music?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Banging.
text: HANNA stares at the dancers, people losing themselves in it -

text: HANNA smiles awkwardly, tries to copy SOPHIE.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: ISAACS enters the rave followed by two of his HENCHMEN. They
text: split up and start to survey the crowd.
text: Over in a secluded corner ISAACS sees a drug deal taking
dialog: place.
text: ISAACS sidles over to the DEALER and his PUNTER. The PUNTER,
text: thinking ISAACS is probably a cop, makes a hasty getaway.
speaker_heading: ISAACS
dialog: What you got?
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: (in Spanish w/ English
speaker_heading: SUBTITLES)
dialog: Nothing man. That guys just a
dialog: friend.
text: ISAACS frisks the DEALER, nothing. He turns the DEALER
text: against the wall and checks his socks where he finds a stash
text: of tiny baggies each containing a gram or two of white
dialog: powder.
text: ISAACS samples the powder and pockets the lot.
speaker_heading: DEALER (CONT'D)
dialog: (in Spanish w/ English
speaker_heading: SUBTITLES)
dialog: Hey, you're not police. What the

speaker_heading: ISAACS
dialog: Ssh.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Back near the bar HANNA and SOPHIE are approached by a couple
text: of scrawny SPANISH BOYS in day-glow tops.
speaker_heading: SPANISH BOY
dialog: (in Spanish w/ English
speaker_heading: SUBTITLES)
dialog: Where are you from?
text: The girls just look at each other.
speaker_heading: SPANISH BOY (CONT'D)
dialog: English? American? You like to
dialog: party?
text: They watch, puzzled, as SOPHIE smiles disinterestedly and
text: leads HANNA away.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Will you teach me to do dancing?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: It's easy.
text: HANNA and SOPHIE walk onto the dance floor and begin to
dialog: dance.
text: HANNA starts by dancing like a five year-old, swinging her
text: arms jerkily and lifting her feet as if walking through a
text: field. But soon her movements become more sophisticated and
dialog: expressive.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: ISAACS is searching through the crowd. He eyes the bodies
text: around him greedily.
text: He takes another dab of the white powder and rubs it into his
dialog: gums.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Back on the dance floor, HANNA and SOPHIE are dancing.
text: FELICIANO approaches through the crowd followed by a FRIEND.
text: THEY start to circle HANNA and SOPHIE, dancing, insinuating
dialog: their way in.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE (CONT'D)
dialog: He's after you.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: How can you tell?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Duh, look at the way he's looking
dialog: at you. He's gorgeous.
text: FELICIANO'S FRIEND approaches SOPHIE, he's not bad looking
dialog: either.
speaker_heading: FELICIANO'S FRIEND
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Sophie.
speaker_heading: FELICIANO'S FRIEND
dialog: Have you come here before?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: All the time.
speaker_heading: FELICIANO'S FRIEND
dialog: Really? You dance well.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: So do you.
text: HANNA and FELICIANO hold eye contact.
text: The music rises and now they're lit only by the intermittent
text: flashes of a strobe light.
text: HANNA and FELICIANO begin to dance around each other, their
text: movements caught in still flashes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: From some distance away ISAACS spots HANNA. He smiles and
text: starts to move through the crowds towards her.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: SOPHIE and the FRIEND are kissing. HANNA sees this and
dialog: laughs.
text: The crowd is jumping.
text: HANNA feels FELICIANO'S hand take hers, she flinches a
text: moment, then lets him draw her towards him. Their eyes still
dialog: locked.
text: ISAACS is getting closer, his eyes flashing eerily in the
text: strobe lighting.
text: HANNA and FELICIANO are in a world of their own.
text: His fingers trace the lines of her arms, shoulders and neck.
text: He draws her face towards his.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Are we going to kiss now?
speaker_heading: FELICIANO
dialog: Would you like to?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Kissing requires a total of thirty-
text: four facial muscles.
text: Their lips are almost touching.
speaker_heading: HANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: The most important muscle involved
dialog: is the orbicularis oris muscle,
dialog: which is used to pucker the lips -
text: He kisses her.
text: HANNA closes her eyes.
text: ISAACS moves in.
text: FELICIANO becomes more ardent, puts his arms around her
text: waist, she doesn't like it. He tries to open her mouth with
dialog: his.
text: HANNA snaps.
text: In a few swift moves, HANNA pulls FELICIANO round and throws
text: him to the ground. She falls to his side and, with one knee
text: on his back, she holds his head, about to snap his neck.
text: SOPHIE turns and sees them on the ground. A few of the
text: closest DANCERS also stop dancing and stare.
text: ISAACS backs off, watching from a safe distance.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Hanna! Holy crap...
speaker_heading: FELICIANO
dialog: Please, don't hurt me.
speaker_heading: (TO SOPHIE)
dialog: Please, tell your friend...
text: HANNA looks up at SOPHIE. Now that she has FELICIANO on the
text: ground she doesn't know what to do with him.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Should I let him go?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: As opposed to what? Yes, you should
dialog: let him go.
text: HANNA leans in to whisper into FELICIANO'S ear.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I'm going to go now.
speaker_heading: FELICIANO
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: It was nice.
text: And she's gone, pulling SOPHIE away through the crowd.
text: ISAACS jumps into action. But he's lost sight of the girls
text: among the mass of dancing bodies.
text: HANNA and SOPHIE move quickly through the crowds towards the
dialog: exit.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Oh, my God, Hanna. I thought you
dialog: were going to kill him. Where d'you
dialog: learn to do that?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: My father taught me.
text: They escape through a hole in the perimeter fence.

text: An immaculately tidy lounge in a small apartment on the
text: ground floor of a run down East Berlin housing project.
text: A well-dressed woman in her 60's, KATRIN, is sitting alone
text: listening to music on an old casette machine.
text: The door buzzer rings. KATRIN gets up slowly and approaches
dialog: the door.
speaker_heading: KATRIN
dialog: Who is it?
text: No reply. KATRIN puts the safety chain across the door and
text: opens it a small amount.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: Hello Katrin.
text: KATRIN slams the door shut in fright and double locks it.
text: Fear racing through her veins, she rushes her way through the

text: KATRIN races to the kitchen door and bolts it.

text: Thinking the apartment is secure, she tries to catch her

text: presence in the room.
text: She turns to face the intruder... MARISSA standing, waiting
dialog: patiently.
speaker_heading: KATRIN
dialog: You look different in pictures.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: Well here I am in the flesh.
text: KATRIN'S mouth twitches with all the imagined conversations
dialog: she's had with MARISSA.
speaker_heading: MARISSA (CONT'D)
dialog: Has Erik Heller contacted you?
speaker_heading: KATRIN
text: Erik's dead.
text: MARISSA sits calmly in an old arm chair.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: Huh, if only.
speaker_heading: KATRIN
dialog: If he's alive why would he contact
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: That depends on whether you believe
dialog: he's innocent, or not.
speaker_heading: KATRIN
dialog: I'm an old woman with a broken
speaker_heading: HEART -
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: - What's in the past, stays in the
dialog: past, right?
speaker_heading: KATRIN
dialog: Something like that.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: So why all the years of snooping
dialog: around and sticking your nose in?
speaker_heading: KATRIN
dialog: You'd understand if you had kids.
text: She turns her back on MARISSA.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: Kid's, they fuck you up, don't

speaker_heading: HANNA

speaker_heading: SOPHIE

speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Leipzig, I live in Leipzig -
text: SOPHIE looses her patience.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: If we're going to be friends you
dialog: have to be honest with me. Them's
dialog: the rules.
text: HANNA is taken aback.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Are we friends?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE

speaker_heading: HANNA

speaker_heading: SOPHIE

speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Yes... Actually, no, I don't.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: There are people that want to harm

speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: And they wont stop.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: So for your own safety...
text: HANNA looks into SOPHIE'S eyes.
speaker_heading: HANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: Can we still be friends?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I don't know. I mean, I don't

speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: That's just it. Neither do I.
text: She reaches into her bag. Brings out the DNA report. Shows it
text: to Sophie. They read. Interfering Sequence. Abnormal.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I think it's about me. DNA is kind
dialog: of how we're made I think. I mean
dialog: who we are.
text: They look at it.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: What will you do?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I'm going to Berlin. I have to meet

speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: As in âGrimm's Fairytalesâ?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: That's right.
text: SOPHIE sighs at HANNA.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: If you say so.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Did I say the wrong thing again?
text: SOPHIE looks at HANNA, sees she's vulnerable. She takes a
text: bracelet off her own wrist. Gives it to her.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Keep this. To remember me.
text: HANNA takes it, puts it on. Moved. Looks at SOPHIE.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE (CONT'D)
dialog: It's a friendship bracelet.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Thank you.
text: HANNA stares at the ceiling, looks over at SOPHIE who's
text: starting to sleep. HANNA reaches out and touches her hair.
text: Beside them, separated by a thin piece of fabric, we see that
text: MILES has woken and has been listening in the darkness.
scene_heading: 132 INT. KATRIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 132
text: MARISSA is searching the apartment. She's thorough and fast.
text: She rips cushions and throws books from their shelves. Her
text: actions become progressively more frantic, relishing the
text: destruction. She finds more and more photograph's of JOANNA.
text: The photographs seem to have a driving effect on her.
text: She walks down the hall and opens a door onto a small spare
text: bedroom that had been turned into home office. Every
text: available wall space is covered in newspaper clippings and
text: photographs relating JOANNA'S murder.
text: On the floor MARISSA finds a box of old casette tapes. She
text: stops to inspect one of the tapes. A label reads: âJoanna no.

text: They speak in Danish with English subtitles.
speaker_heading: ERIK (SIGHS, EXHAUSTED)
dialog: I need a room.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST

speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST

speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST

speaker_heading: ERIK reads: âMission accomplishedâ
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST

dialog: Everybody is being asked to keep an
dialog: eye out.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: For what exactly?
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: I don't know.

text: He sees the van, recognises it. He sees the kids in the back.
text: Bingo. He runs to a black BMW where two of his HENCHMEN are
text: waiting for him.
speaker_heading: ISAACS
dialog: Wake up. It's them.
text: He jumps in the passenger seat whilst the driver revs the

scene_heading: 138 EXT. VESTERBROGADE STATION/COPENHAGEN. DAY. 138
text: A commuter train pulls into the vast station. Amongst the

text: looks furtively around, and tries to blend in with the crowd.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 71.
text: POV - from a walkway above the station - someone is watching
text: HELLER as he tries to conceal himself within the throng. A
text: DANISH AGENT, hidden on a metal walkway above the platform.
text: On the platform HELLER walks amongst the commuters, past the
text: ticket collectors, past another DANISH AGENT posing as a
text: commuter - he stops and lingers by him, noting something not
dialog: right.
text: He moves off and enters a small bar.
text: The second AGENT immediately follows and from the walkway,
text: the other rushes downstairs to give chase too.
text: HELLER walks through the bar into the toilets, finds a FIRE
text: EXIT and walks out through it.
scene_heading: 139 EXT. GOODS YARD/VESTERBROGADE STATION - DAY 139
text: HELLER finds himself in a goods yard adjoining the train
text: station. He walks through the goods yard, then suddenly, and
text: apparently for no reason, stops dead, then throws himself
text: behind a skip of empty bottles.
text: As he does two new men, AMERICAN SPECIAL OPS, run round the
text: corner into the goods yard.
text: From the fire exit, the DANISH AGENTS EMERGE and after
text: signalling to each other, head off to the perimeter.
text: The various agents scour the yard. The SPECIAL OPS get closer
text: to HELLER's hiding place. HELLER suddenly emerges from his
text: hiding place and sticks an elbow in the face of one, a knee
text: in the groin of another.
text: There's a brief exchange of blows.
text: One of the SPECIAL OPS draws his hand gun.
text: HELLER produces a knife out of nowhere and launches at the
text: man, cutting him on the hand, making him drop his gun.
text: He stabs the other in the eye and the man falls to the ground
text: squealing.
text: HELLER leans in and takes from the man's pocket his
speaker_heading: CELLPHONE.
text: HELLER makes a run for it. One of the SPECIAL OPS lets off a
text: shot, the bullet clipping HELLER in the leg.
text: He falters but limps off behind the towering containers.

dialog: without food. Imagine that, nine
dialog: months.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Why do you know so much about
dialog: fleas?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I read it in my Encyclopaedia.
text: HANNA is looking in the side view mirror. She sees ISAACS BMW
text: and frowns, she's seen it before.
speaker_heading: HANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: Also, they can jump around 200
dialog: times their own body length, which
dialog: makes them the best jumpers of all
dialog: known animals except for the
dialog: froghopper. Now they can really
dialog: jump.
text: RACHEL makes a turn and HANNA checks the side view mirror
text: again. Yes, the BMW is still there. HANNA becomes anxious.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Everything all right?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I think so.
text: But HANNA'S face betrays her concern.
speaker_heading: JOANNA (V.O.)

speaker_heading: JOANNA (V.O.)
dialog: An American program. It's very

speaker_heading: JOHANNA (V.O.)
dialog: ...I'm not sure if it's true that

speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Frau Wiegler, this is reception. I

speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Well, here we are.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: How did you know I was here?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I killed one of your men. Got his

speaker_heading: MARISSA (O.S.)
dialog: No, I just grew up. The world's

speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: You got kids?
scene_heading: 144 INT. HOTEL SUITE. COPENHAGEN - CONTINUOUS 144
text: MARISSA stops, taken aback by the question.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: No, I made choices.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Hanna's practically yours, you
dialog: know?
text: This goes straight to an ache that's been building in
speaker_heading: MARISSA.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: Not interested.
dialog: But she is.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: She's true and good and funny.
dialog: Yeah, she's funny. She's special.
dialog: You should see her.
speaker_heading: MARISSA

speaker_heading: JOANNA (V.O.)

text: HANNA checks the side view mirror again and sees ISAACS BMW.
text: She's knows that whoever is driving that car is after her.
text: She looks back and sees SEB, SOPHIE and MILES all comfortably

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Why won't that car pass? He has his

text: SOPHIE wakes up in the back.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Are we stopped? I need to pee.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Well, I don't want you going too
dialog: far right now.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I think you should stay where you

text: HANNA doesn't take her eyes off the mirror. She can see the

dialog: the first move.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Hanna, what's going on. Seb wake

speaker_heading: HANNA

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Hanna!
text: RACHEL sees ISAACS and one of the HENCHMEN chase after HANNA.

scene_heading: 148 EXT. CONTAINER PARK - NIGHT 148
text: HANNA sprints across hard tarmac heading for the relative
dialog: safety of the container park.
text: ISAACS and his HENCHMAN follow at speed.
text: HANNA enters a dark gully between two enormous containers.
text: ISAACS slips around the other side to block her off. He
text: signals to the HENCHMAN to loop around and flank HANNA.
text: HANNA moves quietly between the containers, turning this way
dialog: and that.
text: ISAACS voice comes echoing through the maze.
speaker_heading: ISAACS (O.S.)
dialog: Don't be a silly girl, Hanna. You

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

text: HANNA pulls herself up the side of the containers and
text: scrambles on top of them and runs, jumping between the

text: The HENCHMAN appears having climbed up too.
text: A chase ensues. HANNA, followed by the HENCHMAN climbing up
text: higher, now four containers high.
dialog: ISAACS follow below.
text: HANNA jumps an enormous gap between two containers and right
text: over the head of ISAACS.
text: HANNA slips and tumbles but catches the edge of one of the
text: containers on her way down. She hangs there a moment, then
text: pushes herself off the side of the container and manages to
text: land on a lower container on the other side.
text: HANNA running across the tops of the containers sees the
text: HENCHMAN appear at the far edge. She grabs a discarded wrench
text: and throws it at the man, catching him in the side of the
text: head - a perfect aim - and he tumbles to the ground.
text: She descends the containers with nimble leaps and comes to
dialog: the ground.
text: She's running now through a maze of tight alleys between the
text: containers. She stops at a âT' junction, unsure which way to
text: go. Suddenly ISAACS appears at the end of one alley, HENCHMAN
text: ONE at the end of another, and HENCHMAN TWO at the end of the
dialog: third.
text: She's trapped.
speaker_heading: ISAACS (CONT'D)
dialog: Just take it easy.
text: HANNA makes her decision and runs straight at ISAACS.
text: He stretches out his arms in an attempt to catch her.
text: She hits him like a bowling ball hitting the last pin and he
text: crashes to the ground.
text: She rolls and springs to her feet.
text: The HENCHMEN follow but HANNA is too quick.
scene_heading: 149 EXT. SCRAP METAL YARD/CANAL - NIGHT 149

dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: He knows you.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: MARISSA now in RACHEL'S cell.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: We gave her a ride because we

speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: But you knew she didn't have a

speaker_heading: ENTRY -

scene_heading: 157 EXT. ABANDONNED AMUSEMENT PARK - DAY 157
text: HANNA walks beside a wire mesh fence that separates her from
text: an abandoned amusement park. Behind her is an enormous steel
text: works from which great industrial plumes of steam rise.
text: HANNA climbs under the fence and walks through this surreal
text: playground long since reclaimed by nature. There are huge
text: fibreglass dinosaurs toppled over with heads missing and
text: abandoned dinosaur legs. Rising above the park, surrounded by
text: a muddy moat, is the big wheel now standing at a vertiginous
text: angle. In front of the big wheel is the WILHELM GRIMM HOUSE.
text: The house is a Grimm Brothers fairytale theme âFun House'.
text: It's windows long since shuttered, vines growing through its
dialog: roof.
text: HANNA stands in front of the house in deep anticipation. She
text: walks up the small steps that lead to the front door and
text: knocks. She waits, heart sinking at the thought of there
text: being no-one home. Then, ever so slightly the door opens and
text: peering out at her is a man with the sad face of an out of
dialog: work clown.
speaker_heading: KNEPFLER
dialog: Excuse me young lady?

dialog: her.
speaker_heading: KNEPFLER
dialog: So you are Hanna.

speaker_heading: KNEPFLER (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: KNEPFLER (CONT'D)
dialog: My real name is Knepfler. Herr

speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: What happened to it?
speaker_heading: KNEPFLER
dialog: No car park. You need a car park
dialog: these days, otherwise people wont

dialog: over it...
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: It's beautiful.
speaker_heading: KNEPFLER
dialog: I like it too. Erik used to come

speaker_heading: KNEPFLER (CONT'D)
dialog: Would you like an egg? They're
dialog: fresh.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Please.
text: HANNA takes an egg, breaks it and swallows it raw.
text: KNEPFLER smiles. He gives her a buff envelope. She looks
text: inside - some money, a passport, ID cards.
speaker_heading: KNEPFLER
dialog: You'll need a fresh photograph.
dialog: Don't get it wet.
text: HANNA looks at the passport with a new name - ANNA-MARIE
text: ELKAN. She takes a deep breath, not really comprehending.
speaker_heading: HANNA

speaker_heading: KNEPFLER
dialog: ID. Identity. It tells people who

speaker_heading: KNEPFLER (O.O.V)
dialog: Listen to me, listen. There is no

speaker_heading: MARISSA

speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: KNEPFLER

text: The green shoes come close and HANNA feels the mattress
text: compress as MARISSA sits on the bed. She looks at the shoes
text: as she hears her call.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: Lewis. It's Marissa.
text: HANNA hears the name. The name of the woman she thought she
text: had killed. Her face pale in shock and fear.
speaker_heading: MARISSA (CONT'D)
dialog: You got anything? He's coming here.
dialog: I can smell it. Double the men.
dialog: But, Lewis, I want to talk to him.
text: HANNA hears MARISSA hang. Another pair of shoes enter the

speaker_heading: ISAACS
dialog: His name's Klaus Knepfler. He used
dialog: to send Heller's things from Berlin
dialog: before the Communists were kicked
dialog: out of Prague.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: How much does he know about the
dialog: programme?
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: ISAACS
dialog: Everything. He knew Johanna.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: What does he know about the child?
speaker_heading: ISAACS
dialog: He also thinks Erik's the father.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: Well that's good.
speaker_heading: ISAACS
dialog: Everybody thinks Erik's her father.
dialog: Erik probably thinks he's her
dialog: father.
text: They snigger. HANNA's eyes widen in shock. She can barely
dialog: control her breath.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: Crazy bastard. You got a fix on him
dialog: yet?
speaker_heading: ISAACS
dialog: Let's see what else Knepfler has to
dialog: offer.
text: He leaves her. MARISSA suddenly senses something. Did she
text: hear an intake of breath? She turns and quickly looks under
text: the bed. No one there. Her imagination maybe.
text: MARISSA stands and we see the shoes walk away to the door.
text: They reach the door. HANNA, clinging to the bedsprings in mid-
text: air, not breathing. The green shoes leave. HANNA breathes.
text: Hurriedly she climbs out from under the bed and goes to a
dialog: window.
scene_heading: 165 EXT. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - DAY 165
text: HANNA lands having jumped from the window.
text: She looks around quickly. Then, out of sight from the cars at

scene_heading: 166 EXT. BERLIN STREET - DAY 166
text: HANNA walking fast, in total shock and confusion. Who is she?
text: She walks head down, determined not to be seen. Not knowing

scene_heading: 167 INT. INTERNET CAFE. BERLIN - DAY 167

speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: How much?
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: 3 Euros for half an hour.

speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: How does it work?
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: You've never used the internet?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: No.

text: dinosaur as he sees two CIA AGENTS sitting in a car outside
dialog: the house.
text: HELLER watches for a moment or two.
text: Then, keeping low, he makes a painful run towards the house.
text: HELLER throws himself against the back wall of the kitchen.
text: He breathes heavily for a moment, clutching his wounded leg.
text: He turns and rises to look through the kitchen window.
text: Inside he sees KNEPFLER, stripped to the waist his body
text: bloodied, hanging upside down from a meat hook. He's
text: obviously dead.
dialog: 
dialog:

scene_heading: 169 INT. INTERNET CAFE. BERLIN - DAY 169

dialog: uterus during pregnancy.â
text: HANNA stands in shock. She reads again. âIntervention to the
dialog: mother's uterusâ
text: HANNA deletes the page. Sits in shock. Then writes in her
text: mother's name. JOHANNA ZADEK.
text: Immediately the article about JOHANNA's death comes up. HANNA
text: stares at it. She reads it. No mention of a child. There is
text: an address for Johanna Zadek. She came from the Heizinger
text: Buildings area in the suburbs of East Berlin. HANNA writes it
text: down. Gets up and leaves.
scene_heading: 170 INT. TAXI. EAST BERLIN SUBURB - DAY 170
text: HANNA sits in the back of a taxi as it takes her into a grim

text: She approaches the entrance and looks on all the buzzers.
text: Sees a name scrawled on one - Number 14. Zadek.
text: She presses the buzzer. Waits. No answer.
text: A GANG OF KURDISH YOUTHS come out the block and HANNA catches
text: the door and enters.
scene_heading: 173 INT. HALL. KATRIN ZADEK'S APARTMENT BLOCK - DAY 173
text: HANNA knocks at the door of number 14, waits, knocks again,

speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: (In German w/ English
speaker_heading: SUBTITLES)

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 93.
text: HANNA quickly moves to the door, tries to force it. She looks

dialog: glass.
scene_heading: 175 INT. KATRIN ZADEK'S APARTMENT - DAY 175
text: HANNA climbs through the broken glass into the kitchen. The
text: air is thick with the buzz of Bluebottle flies.
text: HANNA sees the photograph of JOANNA. With some trepidation
text: she moves round the kitchen table and sees the body of KATRIN
text: ZADEK. The back of KATRIN'S head is blown clean away. The
text: flies have laid their eggs in the bloody mess of her brain
text: that spreads across the cheap lino floor.
text: HANNA steps back and gags.
text: She backs out of the kitchen and into the hall. Turns and
text: goes through into the lounge.
text: The lounge has been over thrown. Cushions ripped, shelving
text: pulled down. HANNA stares at the destruction wrought by
text: MARISSA'S hunt for information.
text: HANNA turns, walks back down the hall and passes a door to a
text: tiny second bedroom. She stops and enters.
text: The room had been turned into a home office, there are
text: newspaper clippings relating to JOANNA'S MURDER and
text: photographs of JOANNA herself covering every available wall
text: space. A testament to KATRIN'S unremitting search for the
dialog: truth behind her daughters murder.
text: HANNA begins to search the room for clues. Anything that will

text: Then suddenly she hears a quiet familiar voice.
speaker_heading: ERIK (V.O.)

speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: What's wrong with me?

speaker_heading: ERIK

speaker_heading: ERIK (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ERIK

text: HANNA looks up, stares at him. It's her he's talking about.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: How did you know about it?
text: ERIK's stares right at her.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I worked for it.
text: She stares at him. He hands her a piece of paper from his

speaker_heading: ERIK (CONT'D)
dialog: This is what you were looking for.
text: HANNA reads. It is an invitation to Johanna Zadek to
dialog: participate in the Galinka project. A projected date of
text: arrival at the Galinka Centre. A date - 23rd February 1995.
dialog: An agreed fee to be paid to Johanna. Five hundred American
dialog: dollars. An agreement to give up the child and have no legal

speaker_heading: ERIK (CONT'D)
dialog: I recruited your mother at an

speaker_heading: ERIK (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ERIK (CONT'D)
dialog: Hanna listen to me.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Keep away from me.
text: ERIK approaches her. With real conviction.
speaker_heading: ERIK

speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: You mean I'm a killer?
speaker_heading: ERIK

speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Don't touch me.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: We have a new identity for you. A

text: her back but then HANNA grabs a sharp letter opener.
speaker_heading: ERIK (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't.
text: She attacks, ERIK pushes her to one side, grabs her. A fight
text: in the apartment. Chaos, photos of Johanna crashing, lamps
text: and bookshelves falling. HANNA murderous, ERIK just defending
text: himself, not willing to hurt her. But then she overpowers
text: him, has a knife to his throat.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Let me go.
text: He releases her. She goes to the door.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I tried to prepare you for what
dialog: your life would be.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: You didn't prepare me for this.
text: And her look is so full of pain that in that moment ERIK
text: knows he has done a terrible wrong. She starts to leave down
text: the fire escape. ERIK calls after her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Hanna wait.
text: He looks out to watch her go. It's then ERIK sees the cars
text: coming across the estate scrubland.
text: ERIK turns in panic. And dashes back into the apartment, runs
text: through the destroyed living room, and out through the front
dialog: door.
dialog: 176 176
speaker_heading: DAY
text: ERIK comes out of the main entrance and runs into full view
text: of the cars, deliberately distracting them from HANNA.
scene_heading: 177 INT. MARISSA'S CAR. CONT. 177
text: MARISSA's car is a about to turn the corner and bump straight
text: into HANNA when suddenly...
text: MARISSA sees ERIK leaving the front of the apartment block.
text: She speaks to ISAACS.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: That's him.
text: And the car swerves to follow him. Thus moving unknowingly
text: away from the slight figure of HANNA. HANNA can see the cars
text: in full chase of Erik Heller. He has distracted them.
scene_heading: 178 EXT. STREET. EAST BERLIN. 178
text: HELLER sprints fast across the wasteland. Incredible
text: athleticism. He dives down a side alley, losing his pursuers
text: for a second. Takes out a gun, looking for Marissa. Looking
dialog: to finish it off.
text: Just as he has done this ISAACS' HENCHMAN approach from the
text: end of the street. HELLER fires in their direction, starts to
text: run down an alley. He vaults a dividing wall, scratching
text: himself on barbed wire. He sprints round a corner and sees a
text: doorway ahead of him. He walks towards the doorway.
speaker_heading: MARISSA (O.C.)
dialog: Drop it.
text: MARISSA steps out of the doorway, her gun trained on him.
text: There are men at the end of the alleyway. No escape. HELLER
text: drops his gun.
text: Silence between them. He turns to look her in the eye.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: So go ahead.
text: She stares at him. Wants to make this as painful as she can
dialog: for him.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: You know I'll find her.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Don't under estimate what you
dialog: created.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: What we created, together.
scene_heading: 179 EXT. ESTATE BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS 179

scene_heading: 180 EXT. STREET. EAST BERLIN - CONTINUOUS 180

speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: Truth is I was always very fond of

scene_heading: 181 EXT. ESTATE BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS 181
text: CLOSE ON - HANNA continuing to walk away.
text: She hears a single gun shot. Stops dead. Knows what it means.
text: An intense conflict of emotions inside her. Her breathing
text: stops for a moment, her world seems to go silent.
text: Then a car flies by on the main road, almost running her
text: over, and she is woken. She sees a bus stop ahead. On auto-
text: pilot she runs to it, a bus coming, she beckons. It stops and
text: she is on board.
scene_heading: 182 EXT. WASTELAND. EAST BERLIN. 182
text: MARISSA stands over the dead body of ERIK HELLER.
speaker_heading: MARISSA

scene_heading: 183 INT. BUS, EAST BERLIN. 183
text: HANNA on the bus. Shaking from the shock of his death,
text: bloodied slightly from the fight. The other passengers stare
text: at her as she forces back the tears. HANNA reaches in her
text: pocket for a handkerchief, but only pulls out the letter Erik
text: showed her. The Galinka letter. She sees the address.
dialog: Galinka, Ostrovska district, Poland.
text: HANNA makes a decision. She is going back to where she was
text: born. She must find out who she is.
scene_heading: 184 INT. ESTATE BUILDING. KATRIN ZADEK'S FLAT. 184
text: MARISSA enters the apartment. And looks at the chaos. ISAACS

speaker_heading: ISAACS
dialog: They had a fight.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: She must know the truth.
speaker_heading: ISAACS
dialog: Where do you think she's gone?
speaker_heading: MARISSA

text: MARISSA turns to ISAACS.
speaker_heading: MARISSA (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm closing the CIA operation down.
dialog: Heller is dead, that's all that
dialog: matters to them. This we do alone.
scene_heading: 185 INT. POLISH TRAIN. 185
text: HANNA's head rests on the backrest of a train-seat as the
text: train crawls through the Polish/German border. Exhausted,
text: many nights without sleep. Hungry but unable to eat. Needing
dialog: resolution.
text: In the same carriage a Polish woman sleeps alongside her
text: child of two, also sleeping. HANNA looks at the child. The
dialog: peace of the innocent.
scene_heading: 186 EXT. POLISH TRAIN STATION. NIGHT. 186
text: The train entering a Polish train station. The town is called
text: Ostrovska. Freezing cold. The town is in the North of Poland

speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I am looking for a train to

speaker_heading: GUARD

speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Where can I stay?
text: He points. HANNA sees the hotel.
scene_heading: 187 INT. POLISH HOTEL. BEDROOM. NIGHT. 187
text: HANNA enters the tiny, dank hotel room. She looks at the
text: filthy carpet, the grey ceiling. She turns on the tiny TV.
text: Cartoons. Tom and Jerry type stuff. But she doesn't laugh.
text: She flicks channel. Then stands dead still. She is looking at
text: ERIK HELLER's dead body on the ground. The report depicts him
text: as a dangerous criminal. HANNA stares at the image. The death
text: of the man she spent her life with. Lost forever. HANNA's
text: face oddly still in the TV flicker. Then she flicks it off.
text: Leaves the room.
scene_heading: 188 INT. POLISH HOTEL. FOYER/BAR - NIGHT. 188
text: HANNA, exhausted, sleepless and starving, comes down the
text: shabby hotel stairs and enters the hotel bar. Grim. Empty
text: room, old carpet, bad smell, dated pop music. Three hard-
text: drinking men stare at her, making her uncomfortable as she
text: goes to the bar. A forty-five year old BUSINESSMAN stands
text: there, drinking.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Do you have a sandwich?
speaker_heading: BARMAN
text: Kitchen is closed.
text: The BUSINESSMAN speaks in German.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: Get her something. Poor girl's
dialog: hungry.
text: The barman disappears. HANNA looks round, waits.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm from Leipzig.
text: HANNA flinches at the name. Leipzig.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: The same.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: Business?
text: He looks at her body. HANNA senses it. Her sandwich arrives.
text: It's grim. She leaves it, walks out.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I am tired. I need to sleep.
text: She leaves the bar. HANNA walks back up the stairs.
text: BUSINESSMAN follows.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: Hello?
text: She walks along the corridor, gets to her room. BUSINESSMAN
text: follows.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I was just making nice
dialog: conversation. Yes?
text: As she enters her room, he puts his foot in the door.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's talk. Maybe we can do
dialog: business.
text: HANNA kicks his foot out of the door. Hard.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You don't like talk, huh?
text: He barges into the room and grabs her. Tries to push her on
text: to the bed. He is strong. His words and tone contrasting
text: violently with his actions.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Be nice. Be a nice little dolly.
text: HANNA is thrust on to the bed, but suddenly turns him over
text: her head and smashes him against a cupboard. BUSINESSMAN
text: grabs her hair and throws her on the bed.
text: But now HANNA snaps. She starts to roar. It's like an animal,
text: like nothing we have seen before. She rips at his face, grabs
text: a glass, smashes it and cuts his face with it. Pure animal
text: rage. BUSINESSMAN starts to scream, blood pouring from his
text: eyes. He collapses on the floor. She kicks him, punches him,
text: repeatedly in a grief-fuelled rage until she is spent of her
text: primal fury and falls, panting, to the floor.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 102.
text: When she looks up she sees his mangled bloody body lying next
text: to her. Not quite dead.
text: HANNA suddenly recoils in horror. Shocked by the viciousness
dialog: of her actions.
text: Tears begins to run down her cheeks as HANNA grabs the man's
text: wallet, and leaves the room.
scene_heading: 189 EXT. POLISH STREET - NIGHT 189
text: Shaking in shock, HANNAH walks out of the hotel and down the
text: street, in a daze, no idea where she is going. She starts to
text: run, faster and faster, just running to run out of herself.
text: Finally she stops and is sick. She looks up. A taxi's yellow
text: light blinks in the darkness. She looks at the businessman's
text: wallet to see how much money is in there. She approaches the
dialog: taxi.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I have this much. Can you take me
dialog: to Galinka?
scene_heading: 190 EXT. POLISH HILL ROAD - NIGHT 190
text: HANNA is in the taxi as it travels a lonely Polish forest
text: road through undulating snow-covered hills. Cold dawn is
text: arriving. Grey skies lightening through the windscreen. Tall
text: snowy pines tower above the car. No one else on the road,
text: just a horse drawn cart guiding cows to pasture. It is as if
text: from a different age. Quiet, solitary. HANNA checks the
text: paper in her pocket. Still there. Blood on her hands from the
text: businessman. A cut in her arm. Carefully, secretly, she wipes
dialog: it clean.
text: Suddenly the taxi stops.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: This is as far as the money gets
dialog: you.
text: HANNA looks out. Middle of nowhere.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: How much further?
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Twelve miles.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Please.
text: But no smile from him, nothing. HANNA gets out. Starts to
text: walk as the taxi turns and drives back the way it came.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 103.
text: She is alone in the forest, freezing, shattered, hungry. Just
text: about dawn. Cold as hell.
text: She hears a car approach. Tries to hail it but it flies past
text: fast. Blows icy air in her face.
text: She continues in the freezing cold - sees the road ahead.
text: It's hilly, winding, she isn't going to make it. Too tired.
text: Too shattered.
text: Time passes. Still she walks. Dead on her feet. Gathering
dialog: every ounce of energy.
text: Then the sounds of another car. But it too just flies by,
text: ignoring her waves and cries.
text: HANNA almost collapses in frustration. But carries on.
text: Carries on walking.
text: Time passes. Freezing cold. HANNA alone on the road. Can she
dialog: make it?
text: Then another car. HANNA turns, waves, cries out. And, almost
text: magically, the car slows and stops. The window winds down.
speaker_heading: HANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm going to Galinka. Can you help
dialog: me?
text: A woman's voice, German, in German.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (V.O.)
dialog: Yes I can take you there.
text: And as HANNA gets in, she looks at the comforting, smiling
text: face of MARISSA WIEGLER.
scene_heading: 191 INT. CAR. POLAND. ROAD TO GALINKA - NIGHT 191
text: MARISSA starts to drive, HANNA sits in the front with her.
text: HANNA has no idea who she is.
text: MARISSA speaks in perfect German. Calm, soft, comforting.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: It's a very dull place Galinka. Why
dialog: would you want to go there?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I was born there. But I've never
dialog: really seen it. Why are you going?
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: I have some business to sort out.
text: She looks at her and smiles a sunny, uncomplicated smile.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: MARISSA (CONT'D)
dialog: It's very lucky we ran into each
dialog: other, don't you think?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: You've hurt your arm.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: It's okay.
text: MARISSA hands her some tissue. HANNA bandages the arm.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: I'm Astrid.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: You're not German. Are you
dialog: American?
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: That's right. I lived there for
dialog: many years. I travel a lot.
text: MARISSA smiles at her kindly. HANNA feels safe for the first
text: time in ages. She feels the tears come.
speaker_heading: MARISSA (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh dear, what's wrong with you?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: It's okay. Are you in trouble?
text: HANNA nods. She fights the tears.
text: MARISSA gently holds her hand as she drives. HANNA weeping.
speaker_heading: MARISSA (CONT'D)
dialog: What sort of trouble?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: (though her tears)
dialog: I don't know what to do. Nothing is
dialog: what I thought it would be. It's...
dialog: ugly and cruel and I don't know
dialog: where to go, or... I'm stupid. I
dialog: don't know what I expected...
text: MARISSA secretly, genuinely affected by this. Fights the
text: emotion that has surprised her. Human warmth.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: Sometimes I feel the same way.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 105.
text: HANNA eyes her, surprised to hear this from a grown up woman.
text: MARISSA puts on some music. Gentle. Bach maybe.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I like music.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: Sleep why don't you? You look very
dialog: tired. It will take half an hour on
dialog: this road.
text: HANNA nods. She begins to drift off, so long since she has
text: slept. Her eyes fall shut and her head rests against the
text: window. She is asleep. Vulnerable.
scene_heading: 192 EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAWN 192
text: Soft dawn light as MARISSA drives on a narrow rural road.
scene_heading: 193 INT. CAR - DAWN 193
text: MARISSA looks at the sleeping HANNA. MARISSA represses her
text: gathering emotion. HANNA suddenly looking so young as she
text: sleeps the sleep of the innocent. The rush of emotion shocks
text: her - she is watching HANNA, not the road - and she veers
text: off, nearly crashing the car, narrowly avoiding a tree. She
text: puts her foot sharply on the brake. She's wearing the same
text: GREEN SHOES as she wore at Wilhelm's House.
text: HANNA is jolted awake.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Where are we?
text: MARISSA calms herself instantly.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
text: Nearly there.
text: HANNA doesn't see MARISSA'S SHOES.
scene_heading: 194 EXT. GALINKA 194
text: MARISSA's car slows as it enters a tiny deserted hamlet.
speaker_heading: MARISSA (V.O.)
dialog: This is it.
scene_heading: 195 INT. MARISSA'S CAR. 195
text: HANNA looks around. There is not much to Galinka. She is
dialog: confused.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: It's so small.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: Yes. Just a few cottages. And the
dialog: old bunker.
text: HANNA chooses not to ask any more questions.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Thank you for the ride. You're very
dialog: kind.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: I wish there was more I could do
dialog: for you.
text: MARISSA looks kindly at HANNA who is confused by the
text: intimacy. MARISSA reaches into the glove compartment and
text: retrieves a torch which she hands to HANNA.
speaker_heading: MARISSA (CONT'D)
dialog: Here, take this.
text: HANNA switches the torch on and off, thinking.
speaker_heading: MARISSA (CONT'D)
dialog: I hope you find what you're looking
dialog: for.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Thank you.
text: She gets out and shuts the door behind her.
scene_heading: 196 EXT. GALINKA. CONT. 196
text: HANNA looks around at the grey desolation, rural poverty, the
text: ends of the earth. In the car MARISSA stares at her, then
text: drives off.
text: HANNA walks through the trees along a track. Overgrown, not
dialog: used for many years.
text: She reaches a hidden entrance off the track. By the entrance
text: there is an old battered sign. GALINKA. HANNA looks at the
text: old iron gate. Rusted, locked. It has not been opened in a
dialog: long time.
text: She stares at the sign, tries the gate - yes, locked. Then
text: she climbs the gate. She nearly tears her clothes on the
text: spikes at the top of the gate, then leaps over and,
text: exhausted, four days without real sleep, begins to walk up
text: the narrow tree-lined driveway.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 107.
scene_heading: 197 EXT. GALINKA BUNKER - CONTINUOUS 197
text: HANNA approaches the gaping mouth of an underground bunker.
text: She stops, looks down at the torch in her hand, switches it
text: on and walks into the darkness.
scene_heading: 198 INT. TUNNELS. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 198
text: With only the torch light to see by HANNA treads warily
text: deeper into the tunnels as, behind her, the small aperture of
text: daylight recedes slowly to nothing.
text: The tunnels seem to stretch on for miles ahead of her.
text: HANNA reaches a junction where four tunnels meet. She shines
text: her torch down each tunnel, trying to decide which way to go.
text: She stops when she sees, a little way down one of the
text: tunnels, a child's forgotten shoe.
text: HANNA steps forward and shines her torch down at the tiny red
text: shoe, its buckle rusted.
text: She walks on into the dark.
text: HANNA finds a door which she pushes at. The door is stiff,
text: but HANNA uses her full weight and soon she's made enough of
text: a gap to squeeze through.
scene_heading: 199 INT. NURSERY. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 199
text: At first HANNA has difficulty making out where she is, but
text: dotted here and there are parts of an old nursery. The walls
text: are painted with a blue sky, clouds and the figures of
text: children holding hands.
text: She begins to remember as, from a distant place, she hears
text: the sound of children laughing. She shines her torch in the
text: direction of the laughter and catches a glimpse of a child,
text: dressed in a party frock and hat, playing hide and seek. She
text: shines her torch the other way, and there's another, then a
text: third and a fourth. For a moment the room seems to be filled
text: with laughing children.
text: Then, in an instant, they're gone again and silence returns.
text: HANNA, lit only be the reflected light of her torch, knows
dialog: she has been here before.
text: She walks on through the tunnels.
scene_heading: 200 INT. DORMITORY. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 200
text: HANNA enters a long hall which was once the children's
dialog: dormitory.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 108.
text: At one end is a steep pile of metal bed frames.
text: From a distant place in her memory HANNA begins to hear the
text: sound of children singing.
speaker_heading: CHILDREN
dialog: Happy Birthday to you,
dialog: Happy Birthday to you...
text: From the far end of the dormitory come a procession of
text: CHILDREN, the first of whom is carrying a large birthday cake
text: lit with birthday candles. The children's faces glow eerily
text: in the candle light. They're looking at HANNA and walking
text: straight towards her as they sing.
speaker_heading: CHILDREN (CONT'D)
dialog: Happy Biirrrrthday, dear...
text: The CHILDREN arrive at HANNA lifting the cake towards her.
speaker_heading: CHILDREN (CONT'D)
dialog: ... Hanna.
dialog: Happy Birthday to you!
text: HANNA leans forward, takes a deep breath and blows. The
text: children disappear with the flames of the candles.
text: The sound of a woman's approaching footsteps echo through the
dialog: tunnel.
text: HANNA swings her torch beam in the direction of the
text: footsteps. She freezes as she sees a pair of GREEN SHOES
text: walking towards her. The same shoes as in Wilhelm's house.
scene_heading: MARISSA WIEGLER.
text: HANNA raises her torch beam to see the face of the woman from
dialog: the car.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: You're Marissa Wiegler.
text: HANNA starts to shake.
text: MARISSA has her gun pointing at HANNA but her expression is
text: the same sunny, uncomplicated smile as earlier. Dead silence.
text: HANNA breathing fast. MARISSA speaks in English.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: Don't worry sweetie. I don't want
dialog: to hurt you.
text: MARISSA'S tone has turned into a twisted interpretation of
dialog: maternal care.
text: HANNA does not move. Like a wild animal cornered.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: MARISSA (CONT'D)
dialog: I could have killed you already
dialog: when you were asleep in the car.
text: HANNA'S still shaking.
text: HANNA now sees ISAACS and his HENCHMEN, three of them, all
text: with hunting rifles. All ready to shoot her should she attack
text: or run. They are some distance away, not coming any closer.
speaker_heading: MARISSA (CONT'D)
dialog: Did Erik tell you about this place?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Where are the other children?
text: She looks at MARISSA, who waits, then answers quietly.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
text: Sleeping. They're all sleeping.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I don't believe you.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: I can protect you, Hanna. Make sure
dialog: you walk out of here and keep
dialog: walking. Grow up and grow old in
dialog: safety and security. No one need
dialog: know a thing. But you have to trust
dialog: me. You can't talk about this with
dialog: anyone. It's what we call
dialog: âclassified.â If you tell anyone,
dialog: it'll be dangerous for both of us.
text: HANNA looks at her, remembering what ERIK told her, trying
dialog: hard not to succumb.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: You killed my mother.
speaker_heading: MARISSA
dialog: You're mother didn't want you,
dialog: sweetie. I saved you.
text: HANNA just stares, not believing her.
speaker_heading: MARISSA (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm the only person left who
dialog: understands who you are. The only
dialog: one who cares.
text: MARISSA holds out a hand to HANNA, for HANNA to take, a
dialog: motherly gesture...
speaker_heading: MARISSA (CONT'D)
dialog: I practically am your mother.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 110.
text: HANNA'S stomach turns in horror. She switches off her torch
text: and runs into the shadows.
text: ISAACS raises his gun fires.
scene_heading: 201 INT. TUNNELS. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 201
text: HANNA running through the darkness. Behind her ISAACS and the
text: HENCHMEN come after her. ISAACS carries a large heavy torch,
text: as does one of the HENCHMEN. The other HENCHMEN all have
text: night vision on their rifles.
text: HANNA crouches down, she sniffs the air, can smell them
dialog: coming.
text: A HENCHMAN treads carefully down the tunnel. We see his point
text: of view through his night vision sight, just the dark tunnel
text: stretching on.
text: Like a ghost HANNA'S face appears up close, her eyes a pearly
dialog: white.
text: She slams the gun back in the HENCHMAN'S face.
text: Still in night vision we see the fight, quick and hard. The
text: flash of a single bullet illuminates his death.
text: Silence once more.
text: HANNA now has the first HENCHMAN'S rifle.
text: From around the corner into the next tunnel she hears the
text: sound of feet on dirt. She presses herself against the
text: tunnel, waits listening, hears the feet again and in one
text: movement raises the rifle and spins round the corner.
text: Through her night vision sight she sees a deer, scared eyes
text: staring back at her.
text: She releases her grip on the trigger and the deer scampers
text: into the darkness.
scene_heading: 202 INT. LABORATORY. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 202
text: HANNA comes into the old laboratory. Through her night vision
text: sights we see the white tiles and smashed equipment.
text: She senses someone coming after her and ducks behind a lab
dialog: bench.
text: A HENCHMAN enters the lab carrying a hand gun and a small
text: torch. His footsteps make a crunching sound as he steps
text: through the broken glass that litters the floor.
text: HANNA rises from her hiding place and stands straight into
text: the torch light.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 111.
text: She fires but is off target and only catches the HENCHMAN'S
dialog: left arm.
text: He drops his torch which slides across the floor.
text: HANNA comes round the lab bench to where the HENCHMAN should
text: be lying but he's gone. There's a trail of blood which she
text: follows to a metal cabinet.
text: She stops at the cabinet and fires three shots into its
text: flimsy doors.
text: The dead HENCHMAN slides out from the cabinet.
text: HANNA takes the dead man's hand gun and goes to retrieve the
dialog: torch.
