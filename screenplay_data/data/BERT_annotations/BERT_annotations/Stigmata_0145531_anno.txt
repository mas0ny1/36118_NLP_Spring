scene_heading: EXT.BELO QUINTO -- NIGHT
scene_heading: SET IN: BELO QUINTO -- SOUTHEAST BRAZIL
text: The sun is setting low over the long, curving river beside the church
text: in Belo Quinto. Nearby, in the dark, we see an old Priest kneeling,
text: transcribing some hidden document. He whispers the words in hushed
text: tones as he transcribes them. Call him FATHER PABLO ALAMEIDA.
text: He gently takes a break and prays with his rosary, and presses it
text: against his forehead, closing his eyes. We see his wrists are
dialog: bandaged....
text: As his prayers echo, distorted, we...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH -- BELO QUINTO -- DAY
text: A large mob of devout religious natives, some carrying crucifixes, some
text: crying. As we move into the crowd we see numerous people carrying a
text: HUGE, LIFELIKE SIZE of the crucifixion. They chant eerily.
text: We move swiftly through the crowd until we pick up pace with FATHER
text: ANDREW KIERNAN, late thirties, dark, attractive, as he moves in and
text: around the mob in a light windbreaker and a hand-held camera. He
text: furrows his brow...
text: We see deformed, invalids move through the crowd praying to Jesus, some
text: beckoning, kneeling, almost delirious.
text: We RISE into the air as Father Kiernan makes his way into the
dialog: church.....
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH -- DAY
text: Kiernan walks in and sees another large mass, not quite as large,
text: gathered around a COFFIN in the middle of the church. He moves through
text: the crowd up to a young priest.
text: They speak in hushed tones, in Spanish.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: (Subtitled)
dialog: Are you the investigator?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: (Subtitled)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: (Subtitled; sighing)
dialog: Thank God you've come.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: (Subtitled; looking around)
dialog: Who's in charge?
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: (Subtitled)
dialog: Father Alameida was...
text: He motions to the casket......
text: SWIFT PAN over the casket of the eerie-looking, deceased corpse of
text: FATHER ALAMEIDA. We recognize him from opening shots, his eyes closed,
text: his bandaged arms crossed over his chest. He is holding a black and
text: white photo, his Bible, and his ROSARY.
scene_heading: WWHOOOOOOSSSSH.
text: As Father Kiernan looks on, all the candles around him begin to THUMP
text: out, a strong wind blowing in. It's immensely religious, all the
text: members of the church knowingly CROSS themselves, chanting under their
dialog: breaths.
text: Father Kiernan turns and sees the main tourist attraction: Standing
text: only a matter of feet away from the casket of Alameida, a striking
text: white, arms in the air desperately, is the statue of the VIRGIN OF
text: GUADALUPE. Expressionless face, blank, albino eyes, standing before the
dialog: church like its savior. Only one thing is strange and eerie.....ITS
text: EYES ARE CRYING TEARS OF BLOOD, dripping down the cheeks and dripping
text: onto its dress. Suddenly DOVES SCATTER, feathers flying. Kiernan sets
text: down a recorder.
speaker_heading: MAN (O.S.)
dialog: (Subtitled)
dialog: Look! How much proof do you need?
text: FLASH! Kiernan is holding the camera up, SNAPS a photo.
text: A few mourners cross themselves, mindful of what he is doing, shaking
dialog: their heads.
text: The young Priest watches in confusion as Father Kiernan moves to the
text: statue and takes out a knife, presses it against the indentations of
text: the statue's base, checking for fraud. It's solid stone.
text: CLOSE UP: A Q-Tip dips into a puddle of the WET BLOOD. He places it in
text: a small container for later examination.
text: The young Priest steps up beside Kiernan.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: (Subtitled)
dialog: Has the statue been removed from the church for any reason?
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: (Subtitled)
dialog: No. The people of the village loved Father Alameida. The statue only
dialog: started crying on the day Father Alameida died -- the day the doves
dialog: came back.
speaker_heading: MOURNER (O.S.)
dialog: (Subtitled)
dialog: Those tears of the Mother are the blood of Christ.
text: Kiernan turns and looks into the masses. Then turns as a WIND sweeps
text: through the church again, blowing the hood of his windbreaker up
text: against the back of his head. He turns and sees.....MORE CANDLES THUMP
speaker_heading: OUT AS ONE.
text: WHOOOOSSSH! A flock of DOVES spring up out of nowhere behind the statue
text: of the Virgin, flying in all directions into the air. Kiernan watches
dialog: in surprise.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: (Subtitled)
dialog: I suggest you clear the church. I have to crate the statue up.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: (Subtitled)
dialog: Crate it up?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: (Subtitled)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: (Subtitled)
dialog: No, no. Father Alameida would never have allowed it....
text: Kiernan glances back up at the statue. SNAPS photos. Tears continue to
text: drip down the angelic cheeks of the statue.
text: The corpse of Father Alameida rests in his casket, looking haunted....
text: ........A young peasant boy races up swiftly and GRASPS the rosary,
text: scoops it into the palm of his little hand and races out....
scene_heading: EXT. MARKETPLACE -- BELO QUINTO -- DAY
text: An American woman in her forties in shopping. The young boy with the
text: rosary comes up behind her, taps her. She turns and smiles.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: (Subtitled)
dialog: Ma'am? This is Father Alameida's own rosary.
text: The woman is in awe. She smiles. She likes it.
text: A nearby seller shakes his fist at the boy.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (Subtitled)
dialog: Lady, you really shouldn't buy that.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (Subtitled)
dialog: No, I like it. How much?
text: It's a swift exchange. She hands him the money and he throws the rosary
text: into her hands, races off. The seller shakes his fist after the boy...
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (Subtitled)
dialog: You shouldn't do that! You're stealing from the dead!!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: close up of father kiernan in the church
text: staring at something with a haunted look....
speaker_heading: FATHER ALAMEIDA
text: rests in his coffin, but something's been shifted. A force. Suddenly
text: the shot is beginning to CLOUD with thick, dilluted BLOOD. It begins to
text: cover the shot and eventually envelopes us as we....

scene_heading: OUR FILM'S TITLE:
speaker_heading: STIGMATA
dialog: main titles begin
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: various hyper inserts of skyscrapers to a rapid techno beat ---
text: rapid descent onto an apartment building exit. a woman walks out,
text: blonde, early twenties, FRANKIE paige. She smokes a cigarette.
text: in front of her as she strolls down the street full of pedestrians...
text: with her as she hands over a beer bottle to a thankful bum. she moves
dialog: on.....
text: with her as she is cutting someone's hair in a salon entitled Othe
text: cut'. She laughs in conversation and turns to see:
text: her friend, donna chadway, african-american, FRANKIE's age, also
text: cutting hair, laughing with her.
text: with FRANKIE now as she is in front of mirror, applying makeup and
text: clothes. hyper inserts on pictures of holy crosses, saints, praying
dialog: lords, etc.
text: we sweep toward FRANKIE as main titles continue and she leans forward,
text: taking one last look at herself in the mirror. she is beautiful.
text: she steps away from the mirror and we cut to:
scene_heading: INT. CLUB -- NIGHT
text: Strobe lights dart back and forth as we approach the wall-to-wall mob
dialog: of dancers and drinkers.
text: Quick-cut motions as Frankie and Donna move with their friends to a
text: table and, laughing, sit down, smoking cigarettes and chugging down
dialog: drinks.
text: Frankie's boyfriend, Steve, twenties, buff, leans forward and attempts
text: to speak to Frankie among the CHAOS.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Frankie, sweetheart. Hey, Frankie, let's get out of here. I got work in
dialog: the morning. I'm trashed.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: (Leaning forward)
dialog: You too tired to go home with me??
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Hey, I might be tired but I'm not dead.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: a door opens and the figures of FRANKIE and STEVEN walk into the
text: doorway, sloppy drunk, collapsing against the side of the doorway,
text: laughing all the time. they move into the apartment building...
dialog: .......into the elevator....
text: .....FRANKIE rises into shot and slips off her clothes, revealing her
text: bra underneath. she and STEVEN begin to make love.
text: as they make love, hyper insters on the pictures and paintings of holy
text: lords, praying saints, crucifixions, etc.
text: the last credits roll as we move above the now sleeping figures of
text: FRANKIE and STEVEN. she is deep asleep, her eyes and expression
dialog: angelic, content.
dialog: main titles end.
speaker_heading: FADE DOWN
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. FRANKIE'S APARTMENT -- MORNING
text: A thick silence in the air. We see the lone sleeping figure of Frankie.
text: close up: her lips part gently as she slowly begins to stir.
text: we roam through her apartment and then zoom toward her bed as --
text: --- the phone rings.
text: She is startled awake, then looks around for any sign of Steven: None.
dialog: Of course.
text: She grabs the phone on the bed table and lies back in bed.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Hi mom.
speaker_heading: MOTHER'S VOICE
dialog: How do you do that? How did you know it was me??
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Of course it's you. You're the most persistant ring I know...
speaker_heading: MOTHER'S VOICE
dialog: I just wanted to say hi while I'm near a phone...
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Where are you anyway?
speaker_heading: MOTHER'S VOICE
dialog: Belo Quinto, near Reo. It's beautiful -
text: BBZZZ. A call on the other line.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Mom, hang on. I'm getting another call.
text: She reaches over and clicks to the other line.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: STEVEN'S VOICE
dialog: Bout time. Where you been, baby?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: (Exasperated)
dialog: Ha ha. I hate it when you do that. You could have at least said good-
dialog: bye.
speaker_heading: STEVEN'S VOICE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: WHY??? (Stunned)
dialog: Forget it. Look, I got my mom on the other line. Long distance. I'll
dialog: see you tonight.
speaker_heading: STEVEN'S VOICE
dialog: Alright, see ya later.
text: She clicks back over.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MOTHER'S VOICE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Hi, I'm back. So how do you like Reo?
speaker_heading: MOTHER'S VOICE
dialog: Well, it was great. Did you get my package?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Yeah, I got it yesterday.
speaker_heading: MOTHER'S VOICE
dialog: What did you think? Did you like it? Did you open it yet?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Hang on. I'm gonna switch phones.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER
text: We see the feet of Frankie wearing large sandles as she makes her way,
text: whistling, to the table where the package reading FRANKIE PAIGE sits.
text: She picks it up, speaks into the phone.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: I'm opening it right now..
text: She opens it at a table. Is unamused at a few little trinkets. Finally
text: she comes across the rosary. Holds it up and then just as soon, she
text: drops it back onto the table.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: A necklace...Oh cool.
speaker_heading: MOTHER'S VOICE
dialog: Well, actually, it's not a necklace. It's a rosary.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Where'd you get it?
speaker_heading: MOTHER'S VOICE
dialog: A little village called Belo Quinto.
text: Frankie reaches into her MICROWAVE and removes a heated cup of coffee.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: I didn't even know you went there..
speaker_heading: MOTHER'S VOICE
dialog: I took a little side trip. What do you think of the presents? Do you
dialog: love them? I'm so glad I got a chance to talk to you. But I'm going on
dialog: my cruise and I won't get to talk to you for a month.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Have fun. I love you.
speaker_heading: MOTHER'S VOICE
dialog: I love you, sweety.
text: CLICK. Frankie hangs up and moves back to the table with the rosary,
text: glances down and sees the minute details of the cross. Christ stretched
text: across with the nails driven through the palms and feet.
text: She lifts the cup of coffee to her lips and then backs away. Whoa. She
text: begins to gag. She covers her mouth, as if sickened by a stench. She
text: sets down the cup and races out of the room --
scene_heading: EXT. COFFEE JOINT -- DAY
text: Frankie moves up to the outside bar with Donna.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: (Ordering)Can I get two Lottais. Low fat.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: No. Just one, you know, I'm ok.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Let me get a bacon and egg sandwich too. To go.
text: The waiter nods and moves off. Donna turns to Frankie.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: What's up? You're not eating today?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: I threw up this morning at the smell of tea.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: (A beat)
dialog: You late?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Like a week.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: A week?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: I don't know. A few days. I felt weird.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: You're so dramatic. I think you're just psyching yourself out.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: No, I felt like my heart wanted to go live in my stomach.....
text: She looks at Donna with a wide smile. They laugh.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: No, really, what if I'm bringing a person into this world?
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: OWhat if'?? You got options.
text: Donna bites into a bagel at a side basket and the waiter brings up her
text: lattai. They continue to jive each other as they leave.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: You know what? I don't wanna talk about it. It's making me cranky.
dialog: Let's get our asses to work cause we are late.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: You're always late. There's nothing new.
scene_heading: EXT. ROME -- THE VATICAN -- DAY
text: A wide PAN over the striking image of the Vatican.
scene_heading: EXT. ROME -- STREET -- DAY
text: Father Kiernan moves down the street. Nearby a FLOCK of BIRDS spread in
text: a million directions. He moves on....
text: ......passes THREE PROSTITUTES, who notice him and approach him,
text: flashing some thigh and ass.
speaker_heading: PROSTITUTE
dialog: (Subtitled)
dialog: Have some fun! Ciao, Bello. Are you looking for a good time?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: (Subtitled)
dialog: That's very kind of you. But no, thank you.
speaker_heading: PROSTITUTE
dialog: (Subtitled; in Spanish)
dialog: Come on! Be a man!
text: Father Kiernan pauses and turns around to them, bares his Priest
text: collar. The prostitutes HOWL with laughter.
speaker_heading: PROSTITUTE
dialog: (Subtitled)
dialog: No problem! We'll give you the Vatican discount!
text: He smiles widely and moves on....
text: .......INTO the traffic in front of the VATICAN.
scene_heading: SET IN: VATICAN CITY
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CARDINAL HOUSEMAN'S CHAMBERS -- DAY
text: Dull light, thick carpets. A dim environment. Father Kiernan emerges
text: into the room, walkes up to the desk of CARDINAL HOUSEMAN, who sits
text: behind it. Late fifties, eyes piercing, graying hair. A bold CROSS
text: necklace hangs from his neck. A devout Catholic.
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: Father Kiernan! Welcome back.
text: Kiernan smiles and sits down in front of Cardinal Houseman's desk.
text: Father Dario stands nearby, watching everything in silence.
text: Cardinal Houseman opens a file to reveal BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOS OF THE
text: BLEEDING STATUE OF GUADALUPE.
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: These are interesting. What's the trick?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: To be honest, I don't know.
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: They probably made a fortune out of this. And what...is this?
text: He holds up a photo of the statue. The colors are different, almost
dialog: reversed.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
text: Those are infra-red photographs of tears. The statue is stone,
dialog: therefore room temperature. And the tears show up as white because,
dialog: well, because they're warm....
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: (Dismissively)
dialog: Warm tears...
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Yes. Uh, my lab reports and analysis confirm that the tears from the
dialog: statue are not only warm but, human.
text: Cardinal Houseman glances up at him.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: I know what you're thinking. But with all due respect Daniel, this
text: isn't a fake. It's a free-standing mass of solid stone, and there is no
dialog: scientific explanation.
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: Andrew, it's my understanding you were sent to Brazil to investigate
text: the appearance of a virgin Mary on the side of a building.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Yes, well, while I was in San Paelo I heard of this statue so I decided
dialog: to go and investigate..
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: And...?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: And what?
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: The face of the Virgin Mary on the building?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
text: It's an oxidation stain. Caused by rain water running down untreated
text: side walls. Causes an optical illusion of a veiled woman...
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: Good. We'll consider the matter closed then. Father Dario has your next
dialog: assignment.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: I was hoping you'd send me back to, uh....to Belo Quinto.
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Because I need to do some more tests on the statue.
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: (A beat)
dialog: You're telling me you left the statue in Belo Quinto?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Yes. I was going to bring it back, obviously, but when I saw the effect
dialog: it had on the people, it's amazing. It's almost like it's become a
dialog: cornerstone of their faith.
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: (Exasperated)
text: Andrew, cornerstone of their faith is the Church. Not a crying statue.
dialog: When you're in the field you're a representative of the Catholic
dialog: church. And the congregation of the Causes of the Saints.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Yes, I'm very well aware of that. But I'm also a scientist and I
dialog: observe the facts. And the facts are that this statue has tears of
dialog: blood.
text: Cardinal Houseman rises and paces around the room.
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: In that case, you know the policy. The statue is brought back to the
dialog: Vatican and we conduct expert tests. Geologists, engineers, medical
dialog: examiners. We've examined 50 to 60 crying statues in the last twelve
dialog: months. Not a single one of them has turned out...
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Yes, I'm very well aware of that. But I just wanted you to know that in
dialog: my OPINION, I THINK, that this is different.
text: Cardinal Houseman moves to a huge map on the wall and stares with his
text: hands behind his back.
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: I'm not going to allow you to go back to Brazil. We'll get a geologist
dialog: down there and if he sees fit we'll get the statue sent back for
dialog: further tests. Brother Dario, get me all the information you can on
dialog: this church in Belo Quinto, would you? Thank you, Andrew.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Thank you.
text: Seated, Father Kiernan looks unwillingly defeated. He rises and leaves
text: in a funk.
speaker_heading: DARIO
dialog: I have never seen him this way before.
text: Cardinal Houseman moves to the desk and sits down.
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: Andrew's problem is he can't decide whether he's a scientist or a
dialog: priest.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET -- PENNSYLVANIA -- NIGHT
text: Donna's car zooms to the side of the street, in front of the apartment.
speaker_heading: DONNA'S VOICE
dialog: Frankie, come on. You are gonna drive yourself crazy. If you're worried
dialog: about being pregnant why don't we go to the store right now and get a
dialog: test.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE'S VOICE
dialog: No. Let's give it a couple days.
text: The car stops and Frankie steps out.
speaker_heading: DONNA'S VOICE
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Stop mothering me. Yes. I'm fine.
speaker_heading: DONNA'S VOICE
dialog: Alright girlfriend. I'll call you later.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Ok. Bye. Drive safe...
text: She SLAMS the door and Donna drives off.
text: ABOVE and DESCENDING on Frankie as she walks into her apartment
dialog: building....
scene_heading: INT. FRANKIE'S APARTMENT -- BATHROOM -- NIGHT
text: She is in the bathtub, candles all around. She stares off, deep in
text: troubled thought.
text: She reaches over and grabs an apple. BITES into it and sets it back
text: down. Stares off.
text: She dozes and lets herself sink down into the calm, soothing water. Her
text: face slowly sinks....
text: .......Her image BLURS and splits in TWO, the water slightly trembling
dialog: with a force...
text: A PAN underwater of her BODY.....
text: CLOSE UP: HER BELLY BUTTON as her hand appears and gently touches it...
speaker_heading: DONNA (V.O.)
dialog: Late?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE (V.O.)
dialog: Like a week.
speaker_heading: DONNA (V.O.)
dialog: You're always late. There's nothing new.
text: CLOSE UP: Her face as her hair drifts out around her and she is
dialog: relaxed....
speaker_heading: FRANKIE (V.O.)
dialog: What if I'm bringing a person into this world?
speaker_heading: DONNA (V.O.)
dialog: Frankie, you got options.
text: She sinks down into the water....
text: ......WWHHOOOSSSHH!!! A powerful noise makes her JOLT out of the water
dialog: with a start:
text: a dove flies across the small bathroom, gracefully landing above her,
text: looking down at her....
text: Frankie sits up in the tub, confused and startled. She continues to
text: stare at the dove, who stares back and then FLITTERS off.....A single
text: feather falls into the water in front of Frankie. She furrows her brow
text: and picks it up, examines it....
dialog: BANG!
text: A stronger and more malevolent force KNOCKS her back into the water
text: with a throttled YELP!
text: BLURRED, FRANTIC images of Frankie struggling --
text: --- her foot SMASHES into the faucet of the tub, sending it SMASHING to
text: the floor, water SPRAYING out of the open tube.
text: Frankie continues to flail against the unseen force...
text: image of a nail being driven through a wrist
speaker_heading: CA-CHANG!
text: Frankie winces, SCREAMS!
text: another image of the nail being driven through another wrist with a
dialog: metallic ca-chank!
text: Frankie winces again, her screams muffled by the water. We notice drops
text: of BLOOD spill out and cloud into the water.
text: image of a nail being driven deeper into flesh --
dialog: CA-CHANK! CHANK!
text: Finally Frankie sits up in the tub, her wrists held out in front of
text: her: A gash in each wrist, bloodied. Gore drips down her arms. She is
text: too horrified even to scream.
dialog: smash cut to:
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT
text: As the ambulance drives wildly through the drizzle and traffic --
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL -- NIGHT
text: Frankie is wheeled in on a gurney by a mob of doctors, frantically
text: racing to an ER room.
text: Frankie is lying on the gurney, blood covering her clothes. Her eyes
text: stare unflinching above her, she's numb to everything. In shock.
text: We hear Donna trying to get in to see Frankie. A doctor restrains her.
speaker_heading: DONNA'S VOICE
dialog: Somebody needs to tell me what's going on. Frankie, can you hear me?
dialog: I'm right here with you. I don't understand why there's so much
dialog: blood...
text: The doctors try frantically to PUMP some life into Frankie. Her vital
text: signs are wild, THUMP-THUMPING to different degrees.
text: Suddenly Frankie Paige sits BOLT UPRIGHT and lets out a WAILED SCREAM
text: that echoes through the ER room.
text: DONNA turns.
text: Doctors and nurses turn.
text: Frankie stops and then goes limp again, FALLS back down onto the
text: support of the gurney.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: ....blood pressure are back to normal...
text: Frankie's vital signs are calm. She blinks, as if something has passed;
dialog: left her.
text: She sits up, startled, hand out in defense. Dr. Reston, thirties,
text: pretty, consoles her.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: RESTON
dialog: I'm Dr. Reston. Do you know what your name is?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: (Looking around)
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: RESTON
dialog: You're in the emergency room. You were found unconscious in your
dialog: apartment. Do you remember anything?
text: Dr. Reston reaches forward and takes the bandage off of one of
text: Frankie's wrists. Blood FLOWS out way too easily, gushing all over
text: everything. Frankie just stares curiously.
speaker_heading: RESTON
dialog: Oh Jesus.
dialog: (Calling)
dialog: Can I get some help over here? We have a very deep laceration here! Oh
dialog: my God, it's gone right through.
text: Frankie just watches her blood flow out.
text: Nearby, Donna is restrained by a doctor.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: You can't go in there.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Please, Doctor. I just want to know what's...going on...with her...
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Please have a seat. Thank you.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ER ROOM -- LATER
text: Frankie's wrists are bandaged and she is sitting up in bed. Dr. Reston
text: is sitting beside her, deeply engrossed in studying the wounds.
speaker_heading: RESTON
text: These are puncture wounds, Frankie. Caused by the entry of a sharp
dialog: object. Are you in any pain?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: No. That's weird, isn't it?
speaker_heading: RESTON
dialog: (re the wound)
dialog: Wow, will you look at that? It only bleeds when I touch it.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Then maybe you should not touch it.
speaker_heading: RESTON
dialog: (Astounded)
text: These wounds are identical; same size, same shape. She missed the main
text: artery by less than a centimeter.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: You keep saying Oshe', but I didn't do this.
text: Dr. Reston smiles and says cheerily, almost as if to a mental patient,
speaker_heading: RESTON
dialog: What's happening in your life, Frankie? You have a lot of stress at
dialog: work?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: (Rye)
dialog: I cut hair.
speaker_heading: RESTON
dialog: Any trouble with a significant other?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Ye-es.
speaker_heading: RESTON
dialog: And that is?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: (A beat)
dialog: I'm not very significant. Look, how long is this gonna take? I wanna go
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: RESTON
dialog: Oh, I think you should stay here for at least twenty four hours. We
dialog: need to get a handle on this.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: (Sharp)
dialog: There's nothing to get a handle on.
speaker_heading: RESTON
dialog: Frankie, I'm not gonna kid you. With wounds like this it's pretty
text: obvious that they were self-inflicted.
text: A stunned beat. Frankie looks at her.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: You think I did this??
text: Dr. Reston gives her a look. Yes.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: It would never happen. I love being me. Ask anyone.
scene_heading: INT. FRANKIE'S APARTMENT -- BATHROOM -- NIGHT
text: It's a mess. Objects toppled over, the floor flooded with bloodied
text: water. We move to the tub that is now FILLED TO THE BRIM with water.
text: Frankie watches helplessly, tears coming to her eyes.
speaker_heading: DONNA'S VOICE
dialog: Frankie, turn the light off, honey, and come to bed.
text: Frankie turns to DONNA who is in the bedroom. Frankie stands in the
text: open doorway.
text: Finally she turns off the light and moves to the bedroom.
dialog: in the bedroom
text: Frankie curls under the covers, next to DONNA. They lie in silence.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Do you smell flowers in here or something?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Like Jasmine or Hyacinth or something....
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: (Shaking her head)
dialog: I don't smell anything....
text: A beat. They lie in silence. Donna looks at her, concerned.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Mmmm, do you need anything?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Good-night.
text: Frankie rolls over on her side.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Good-night.
text: WATER continues to drip down onto the table beside the bed. Drip. Drip.
text: Splashes in a tiny puddle. Suddenly one of the drops REVERSES in a
text: swift, blink-of-the-eye moment. Frankie doesn't notice.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: INT. VATICAN -- OFFICES -- SUNSET

text: steps in. They nod in greeting.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: (Subtitled)
dialog: Hello. I'm here to see Brother Delmonico.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: (Subtitled)
dialog: You've got to sign in.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: (Subtitled)
dialog: I'll only be five minutes.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: (Subtitled)
dialog: Everyone has to sign in.
text: Kiernan signs the book on the desk and moves on...
text: .....into the main offices full of desks, lamps, books. A large wooden
text: staircase behind the floor full of desks, leading to another level.
text: Kiernan walks up to a nearby desk and greets the elderly priest who is
text: sitting before a volume of pages. Call him BROTHER DELMONICO, late
text: sixties, graying, naturally friendly.
speaker_heading: BROTHER DELMONICO
dialog: (Heavy accent)
dialog: Welcome back, Andrew.
text: He stands, shaking Kiernan's hand.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: BROTHER DELMONICO'S VOICE
dialog: God is good...
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: Brother Delmonico is seated and Father Kiernan moves around to the side
text: of the desk as they speak.
speaker_heading: BROTHER DELMONICO
dialog: So how was Belo Quinto?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: How do you know about Belo Quinto? I was sent to San Pailo...
speaker_heading: BROTHER DELMONICO
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: God lives here, remember. We know everything.
text: Kiernan chuckles.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Yes, I forgot.
speaker_heading: BROTHER DELMONICO
dialog: How are you doing, Andrew?
text: Kiernan shakes his head, closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: I don't know, I don't know......I travel around the world investigating
dialog: miracles, and then I disprove them. The real miracle is that anyone
dialog: believes anything. I don't know what I'm doing, to tell you the truth.
speaker_heading: BROTHER DELMONICO
dialog: None of us know what we are doing.
text: Kiernan's eyes drift down to the volume of pages before Brother
text: Delmonico. He is curious.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: So what are you working on?
speaker_heading: BROTHER DELMONICO
dialog: I've no idea.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: How can you translate something if you've no idea?
text: He closes the book as Kiernan strolls around the desk.
speaker_heading: BROTHER DELMONICO
dialog: I'm a linguist, Andrew. I translate words, not their relevance. But
dialog: this one is a second century gospel.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: How many is that you're up to?
speaker_heading: BROTHER DELMONICO
dialog: I helped translate about fifteen. That only leaves twenty still to go.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: So there are what, thirty-five gospels?
speaker_heading: BROTHER DELMONICO
dialog: Everyone had a different experience of Jesus. So they all wrote
dialog: different stories. See, all the gospels, they are, interpretations.
dialog: Memories, dreams, reflections.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: And there's no one gospel in Jesus' actual words?
speaker_heading: BROTHER DELMONICO
text: We are all blind men in a cave. Looking for a candle that was lit two
dialog: thousand years ago.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: So what's in the text?
speaker_heading: BROTHER DELMONICO
dialog: I was only given every third page.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BROTHER DELMONICO
dialog: The most sensitive documents are always divided into threes among us.
dialog: One third to the Dominicans, one third to the Fransiscans, and one
dialog: third to us Jesuits. The truth of any document is only known to...a
dialog: very powerful few.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: That's typical of this place, isn't it?
speaker_heading: BROTHER DELMONICO
dialog: We live in a highly competitive world, Andrew. The church is no
dialog: exception.
text: Thoughtful, Kiernan moves to a nearby door which is blocked off and
text: locked tight with a HEAVY METAL LOCK. Kiernan reaches up and holds it,
text: then lets it go, BANGING against the metal. It CLANGS and ECHOES
text: through the vast rooms.
text: Nearby, the guard looks up.
text: At the locked door, Kiernan stares off. Behind him, Brother Delmonico
dialog: watches.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN

speaker_heading: RESTON (V.O.)
text: These wounds are identical, same size, same shape. She missed the main

speaker_heading: FRANKIE (V.O.)
dialog: You think I did this....?
scene_heading: INT. THE CUT -- DAY
text: The barber shop where Frankie and Donna cut hair, give people earrings

text: In the b.g. Bjork's OAll Is Full of Love' remix is on.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: So, Jenn, tell us about your date.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: It was with a tax lawyer.

speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Hey Frankie.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Hey guys.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: How you feeling?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Fine.
text: She smiles and walks to her section of the room. Donna approaches her.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Really ok? Or just ok?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: I'm fine. So how's my day lookin'?
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: (r.e. a woman nearby)
dialog: I started your first client. And you're booked solid until seven.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Thanks.
text: They share a smile. Donna goes back to her work.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: (To woman)
dialog: Wanna come over here? Ok, well, go back to Jen and dish the dirt.
text: Frankie gathers her things. She begins to cut the woman's hair.
text: Jennifer continues talking about her date from last night. Frankie
dialog: isn't paying attention....
text: She is distracted by a noise. Looks up. Stops cutting hair. Sees
text: nothing and reluctantly continues cutting hair....
text: Again she hears something and abruplty STOPS, stepping away and looking
text: out the window. Turns to Donna, who frowns at her. You ok?
text: She nods. But she's not. Something is bothering her. Finally she walks
text: to the window and looks out. Sees it:
text: Standing on the curb across the busy street, cloaked in a bright blue
text: raincoat, a woman is staring at Frankie, and she is holding a wrapped
text: up baby in her outstretched hands.
text: At the window, looking out, Frankie frowns....
text: OUTSIDE, the woman continues to stare at Frankie. TEARS roll down her
text: cheeks quickly.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET -- DAY
text: The woman holds the baby out toward the blurring rush of traffic --
text: AT THE CUT, Frankie sees what she is going to do. SCREAMS.
text: The woman holds the baby, and drops it.
text: AT THE WINDOW, Frankie's scream is muffled by the glass. She POUNDS
text: against the glass, SCREAMING.
text: We see the baby DROP onto the concrete in between the chaos of traffic!
text: The door to THE CUT opens and Frankie RACES out, screaming, charging
dialog: into traffic.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Shit....
text: Horns blare as cars SCREECH to a stop and just avoid hitting her. She
text: races across the street to the woman whose face is covered by the
text: bright blue hood of the raincoat.
text: At THE CUT, Donna races out after Frankie, completely confused.
text: Frankie approaches the side of the road where the baby was dropped and
text: searches frantically. NO BABY. She does find the red blanket it was
text: wrapped up in. Picks it up, sobbing, hopeless.
text: The woman stands on the curb, expressionless, unmoving. People walking
text: by seem to only notice Frankie and they stare.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: (To nobody in particular)
dialog: Stop! There's a baby!!! There's a baby!
text: Donna rushes up behind her and grabs her into an embrace. Frankie sobs
text: into her arms.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Frankie! What are you doing?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
text: There was a lady. She dropped her baby....I saw her. She dropped the
dialog: baby...I swear! I swear.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: No. There's no lady and there's no baby...
text: Frankie helplessly collapses into Donna's arms again and SOBS. As

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SUBWAY TRACKS -- NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN -- NIGHT

speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: You alright?
text: Frankie forces a nod.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: We'll be home in a minute....
text: Donna sits back in silence. A long moment passes.
text: Frankie leans forward and scans the surrounding subway box. A few
text: pedestrians sit around her. Two nuns and a priest sit nearby, engaged
text: in a conversation.
text: Frankie thinks a beat, then sits back. Silent. We can hear the sounds
text: of the subway on the tracks outside.
text: Donna glances at Frankie, who looks back. They look off. Frankie leans
text: forward again and this time focuses on the priest sitting a few people
text: down from her, talking with the nuns. We cannot hear what he is saying.
text: A beat. Frankie thinks. Abruptly she STANDS and walks over to the
dialog: priest...
speaker_heading: DONNA'S VOICE
dialog: (Worried)
dialog: Frankie??
text: Frankie ignores Donna and approaches the priest.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Hey you.
text: The priest looks up.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: Are you speaking to me?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Are you Andrew Kiernan?
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: Andrew Kiernan? No. My name's Father Derning. May I help you?
text: A beat. She gives him a rude look.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: No one can help me now. I'm fucked.
text: With that she turns swiftly to the nuns seated across from Father
text: Derning. Reaches forward and GRABS a SILVER CROSS NECKLACE off of one
text: of the nuns and THROWS it down the aisle, letting it skitter to the
text: grimey floor of the train.
text: All chaos breaks loose.
text: The lights FLICKER on and off in a blur of confusion and NOISE as the
text: subway JERKS to the right and left, sending people SCATTERING to the
text: floor in fright.
text: Frankie SLIDES down the middle of the train, reaching out for anything
text: to stop her. She grabs a nearby rail and tries to get to her feet. The
text: train LURCHES to the right and left again, sending people all around
text: again. Frankie quickly reaches out with her other hand to the railing
text: across from the other one, now she is stretched across the train,
dialog: holding on desperately --
text: LASHING MARKS echoe through the air. Frankie SHRIEKS.
text: image of whip marks across flesh; FRANKIE's back
text: Frankie SCREAMS and sobs.
text: MORE LASHING MARKS sound through the air and she winces, loses her
text: handle on one of the railings and grunts, faltering....
text: image of more whip marks across flesh as more whipping sounds break
text: out. one after another.
text: Frankie is sobbing desperately from pain. Something is badly damaging
dialog: her back....
text: MORE lashing sounds....Her eyes roll back in her head...
text: image of the subway train racing through the track
text: BACK to Frankie, in the subway train.....She has lost the energy to sob
text: now. She can only let out a moan....
text: more lashing marks sound out
text: She drops to the floor in a heap of blood and pain. Sobs desperately,
text: reaching for something to grab onto in the middle of the chaos.
text: Finally the train slows and it's over. People get to their feet, but
text: Frankie remains in the middle of the train, on the floor, reaching out
text: aimlessly for something or someone to help her.
text: Donna races to Frankie, not believing her eyes: Frankie's back is
text: covered in blood and whip marks.
speaker_heading: DONNA

speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Well, am I psychotic or dying, or both?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: Well, none of the above. Actually, I think that you're quite rational.
dialog: And despite the wounds you've suffered you're in very good health.
dialog: There is another possibility that is of concern..Epilepsy.
text: A shocked beat.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Epilepsy?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: We've run some preliminary tests. All things considered, I think it
dialog: might explain a lot.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: But that's impossible. How can you just wake up one day and have that?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Well, you can't. You've described blood trauma to the head. Disturbing
dialog: hallucinations. You're hearing voices. These could all indicate
dialog: epilepsy.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: So what do we do now?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: We're going to insert some electrodes into the upper neo cortex...
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Wait a minute, wait....You want to put wires inside my head?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Frankie, we're going to do whatever we can to find out what causes

speaker_heading: DONNA

speaker_heading: FATHER DERNING

speaker_heading: DONNA

speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: I was hoping you'd changed your mind about sending me to Belo Quinto.
speaker_heading: FATHER DARIO
dialog: We have no record of a church in Bell Cinto....
text: A beat. Kiernan stops and looks at him.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: What? That's impossible. There must be some mistake.
speaker_heading: FATHER DARIO
dialog: No mistake, Father. I've checked into it myself. If there is a church
dialog: in Belo Quinto, it is not one of ours.
text: Cardinal Houseman moves over to them.
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: We have no record of a priest assigned to that village, either. (re the
dialog: television)
dialog: This was sent to us from Father Derning in Pittsburgh. From the train
text: security camera.
text: Kiernan moves to the television, squints.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: What, uh, what are we supposed to be looking for?
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: Watch.
text: on the video screen
text: we see the image of the LURCHING subway and in the middle of the shot,

speaker_heading: KIERNAN

dialog: Obviously it is some sort of attack. Maybe posession?

speaker_heading: KIERNAN

speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN

speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: How important is this, really, Daniel?
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: We don't know yet.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Then why are you sending me?
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
text: Because of this clipping from the Pittsburgh Globe.
text: Cardinal Houseman slides over a copy of a newspaper article. Kiernan
text: picks it up and reads. The bold headline reads: FREAK SUBWAY ATTACK.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Well, the publicity is unfortunate, but I'm sure by the time I get
dialog: there it will be completely blown over.
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN

speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: ....a goddamned Church!
text: A CHIME as the door opens. They look up:

text: She looks at the priest.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Do you have an appointment?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: No...I don't.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Well, would you like a haircut, or a manicure, or maybe you'd like to
dialog: have your nipple pierced?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: Or maybe if we just start with a trim, could go from there?
text: Frankie smiles and takes his coat, hangs it up.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Have a seat.
text: He follows her to the chair and sits down. She grabs a cover and drapes
text: it over him.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Alright, I'm gonna put this cape on so you don't get your scratchy
dialog: neck...
text: She covers his neck.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN

speaker_heading: KIERNAN

speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Claudia's University of Cosmotology. See, I'm acredited.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Oh. OCool'.
text: She continues to trim his hair.

speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Am I going crazy, or is Frankie hitting on a priest?
text: Frankie trims his hair.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: What do I call you? I feel kind of weird calling a guy I could date
dialog: OFather'....

speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: I mean.....I couldn't date you, but, you know...
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: No, you just made my day, actually. Thank you. You can call me Andrew.
dialog: Andrew Kiernan. That's my name.

speaker_heading: DONNA

dialog: Coffee, honey?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: No thanks.
text: Waitress walks off. Kiernan and Frankie discuss.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: So, what brings you to Pennsylvania?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Well, Father Derning asked us to come and speak to you, Ms. Paige.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: OUs'? What's us, I thought you were a priest?
dialog: andrew
dialog: I am a priest, but I'm also an investigator. I work for a division of
dialog: the Vatican called the Congregation of the Causes of the Saints.
text: He reveals a small tape recorder and sets it on the table between them.
scene_heading: CLICKS RECORD.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Do you mind if I switch this on?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: No, go ahead.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: What's your full name?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: (Leaning forward)
dialog: Frankie Paige.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Ok......Your age?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Twenty-three.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Ok, which church do you attend?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: I don't attend church.
text: A beat. He looks up at her.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: You ARE Catholic?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: No. I don't go to church because I don't believe in God....
text: A beat. Kiernan nods.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Well, that's really it for me. That's all I need to know, Ms. Paige.
text: He begins to pack up. Takes the recorder away. Frankie's confused.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: That's it?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Afraid so. See, stigmatics are deeply religious people.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: And there's no exceptions?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Well why do they get stigmata?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
text: When Christ died on the cross, he died with five wounds. (Holds out
dialog: photo of crucifixion)
text: His back was scorched by whips. There were gashes on his forehead from
text: the crown of thorns. There were nails driven through his hands and
text: feet. Finally, a spear, driven through his side.
text: Frankie listens, and we move to her hands and wrists, which she keeps
text: hidden below the table, mindful of as he describes the wounds that she
dialog: herself possess.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Throughout history, only deeply devoted people have been....afflicted
dialog: of these wounds.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: There really is no satisfactory scientific explanation. All stigmatics
dialog: are haunted by such intense spiritual pain. In some ways it effects
text: them physically. They're assaulted by their own visions of evil. And
text: they manifest this battle in their bodies. The church regards it as a
dialog: gift. A gift from God.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: A gift? (Laughs)
dialog: Can I give it back?
text: Kiernan barely smiles. Frankie grows serious. Looks down at her wounds.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: (Softly)
dialog: Listen, Father, could I show you these and...you tell me what you
dialog: think?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Yes. Yes, of course.
text: She holds out her bandaged wrists to him.
text: Gently he reaches over and lifts up the bandages one by one, looking at
text: the blood underneath and the stitched wounds.
text: Finally he sighs and looks away. Frankie now turns her wrists OVER to
text: reveal yet another set of blood stains. The wound goes through the
text: wrist bone.
text: He turns back to her: sees it. He is absolutely stunned. A beat. He
text: reaches over again and gently lifts up the bandages. Sees the blood and
text: stitched wounds. He is speechless.
text: He looks up to Frankie, who stares back with pleading eyes.
text: They are interrupted by the Waitress who comes back with another pot of
dialog: coffee.
dialog: waitress
dialog: Coffee honey?
text: Frankie sighs and looks off. The waitress leaves and they are left
text: alone. Father Kiernan is still stunned.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Well, what do you think?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Doesn't really matter what I think, Ms. Paige.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: What's that mean?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: It means officially this is not a case for the church. To say that a
text: self-confessed Athiest exhibits the wounds of Christ is a contradiction
dialog: of terms.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Look, you know what...here..
text: Exasperated, Frankie reaches into her purse and throws a crumpled piece
text: of paper across the table to him.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Read that.
dialog: Kiernan does.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: I found that on my kitchen table the other morning. Now I don't know
dialog: what that says. But that handwriting is mine.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: It's Italian. It says OSplit a piece of wood and I am there. Lift a
dialog: stone and you will find me.'
text: He looks up at her and smiles.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: It's beautiful.
text: She takes the paper and crumples it angrily.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: This isn't beautiful. This is a warning! It means that no matter what I
dialog: do, no matter where I go, I can't escape this!
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Ms. Paige, I would really like to help you --
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: (Standing up)
dialog: You know what? This is not going anywhere. You don't know what this is.
dialog: You can't give me any kind of answer. Coffee's on me.
text: She throws some crumpled bills onto the table and rushes out. Kiernan
text: sits, sighing.
text: A few moments later he looks out the window and sees FRANKIE walking
text: down the street in the downpour, and she turns and looks back at him
text: with a glare.
scene_heading: INT. FRANKIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
text: DRIP. DRIP. Water plops out of the ceiling into numerous bowls that are
text: filled to the brim with rainwater.
text: Sitting among masses of lit candles and books, Frankie leafs through
text: books labeled: EPILEPSY, THE STUDY OF STIGMATA, ETC.
text: We see numerous pictures of Christ with the crown of thorns, whip
text: marks, nails through his palms and feet.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN (V.O.)
dialog: There really is no satisfactory scientific explanation. Stigmatics are
dialog: deeply religious people.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR (V.O.)
dialog: We're going to do whatever we can to find out what causes this..But all
dialog: things considered, I think it might explain a lot.
text: Frankie continues to flip through books with painful, haunting photos.
text: A tear rolls down her cheek.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN (V.O.)
dialog: Throughout history only people who believe in God have been afflicted.
text: The nearer they come to God, the more open they are to the torment of
text: their demons. The church regards it as a gift. A gift from God.
text: We see on one page the definition of stigmata. She quickly turns the
dialog: page.
text: She stops and slams a book shut.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CLUB -- NIGHT
text: Frantic strobe lights again POUND to an equally POUNDING beat. Dancers
text: on the stage lead the show as mobs of people dance with abandon and get
text: hammered at the bar.
text: Donna, Jennifer and another friend CLINK! in a toast.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER/DONNA
dialog: Here's to Friday night!
text: Donna looks up as she sees FRANKIE walk in among the crowd and go to a
text: table, alone.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Frankie!
text: Jennifer turns to Donna.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Don't worry about it. Just order another drink. I'll be right back.
dialog: I'll go check it out.
text: Donna moves to the table that Frankie is standing by nervously, smoking
text: a cigarette. She smiles.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Hey girlfriend...
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: What's up? Thought you were staying home to get some rest?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Have you seen Steven?
text: They sit down among the loudness and CHAOTIC STROBE LIGHTS.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Man, forget about Steven. What's up with that Priest?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Believe me, he's all business. (Ordering)
dialog: Hey, could we get two doubles?
text: A waiter pours them a couple rounds of drinks.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: You know what's scarier than not believing in God?
text: A beat. Donna just watches her.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Believing in him. I mean, really believing in him. It's a fucking
dialog: terrifying thought.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: It's Friday night. I think you're taking things a little too seriously.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Cause if there is a God, he hates me. He's ruining my life.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Come on, Frankie. It's gonne be alright, man, relax...
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: (Suddenly sharp)
dialog: You don't get it do you?
text: Donna stares.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: I have fucking holes through my wrists! I have slashes across my back!!
text: Donna continues to stare.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: If it isn't God doing this to me, than who is!?
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: (A beat)
dialog: I think you're losing it, man.
text: Frankie sets her drink down and stands, walking away.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: where are you going?
speaker_heading: CA-CHANK!
text: A piercing, blinding pain in Frankie's forehead. Her hands go
text: desperately to her face and she covers her eyes, FALTERING.
speaker_heading: DONNA (O.S.)
dialog: FRANKIE!!!
text: A couple bloodied gashes rip open on her forehead!
text: Stunned, she stands and presses a finger against the wetness. Looks at
dialog: it: BLOOD.
speaker_heading: CA-CHANK!
text: HYPER INSERT AN IMAGE OF THORNS POKING INTO FLESH
text: Frankie screams and DROPS to the floor. Donna stands in shock.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: FRANKIE!! Frankie...!
dialog: ca-chank ca-chank!
text: IMAGE OF THORNS INTO FLESH -- WE SEE FRANKIE'S HEAD WEARING A CROWN OF
text: THORNS, REACHING OUT DESPERATELY TOWARDS US
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: Frankie is on the floor, not wearing a crown of thorns, but feeling its
text: pain. Blood seeps down her forehead as she SCREAMS and SHRIEKS in pain,
text: stumbles out of the club as onlookers either make fun or just stare in
dialog: horror.
speaker_heading: DONNA
text: DON'T JUST FUCKING STAND THERE! SOMEBODY CALL AN AMBULANCE!
text: She rushes out of the club after Frankie. Nearby, Steven is at the bar,
text: looks behind him.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Damn..
scene_heading: EXT. CLUB -- NIGHT
text: The door opens and a bleeding Frankie races out into the rain, into
text: crowds of people and pushes her way out INTO THE STREET --
text: It's all a blur of traffic and HORNS BLARING as she races out into the
text: maze of cars, dodging some and CRYING OUT! Blood oozes down her head.
text: Donna races out, looking around frantically.
text: IN THE STREET Frankie HOPS up onto the hood of a car, then slides off
text: the other side, racing through the street in a daze of pain.
text: She stands still and whips her head back and forth, her face covered in
text: wet blood and rain. Her hair matted against her head. She groans and
dialog: sobs.
text: Donna finally gathers the nerve to race out into the street and
text: searches around. HORNS continue to blare.
text: Donna looks around: Frankie is nowhere to be found.
scene_heading: EXT. FRANKIE'S APARTMENT COMPLEX -- NIGHT
text: Father Kiernan moves to the door and BUZZES the name PAIGE. Waits. No
dialog: answer.
text: Something catches his eye. He looks up --
text: Frankie is moving down the street toward him. She stops when she sees
text: him. He notices the blood dripping down her face. Frowns.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Ms. Paige??
text: She gasps and cries, her hand goes to her head and she immediately
text: turns and races down the street, away from him. He quickly follows --
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Ms. Paige!!
scene_heading: EXT. BACK ALLEY -- NIGHT
text: Kiernan races through the grime and muck of a back alley, following
text: Frankie, who is nowhere to be found. He finally reaches the clearing in
text: the alley and stops, looking all around.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Ms. Paige? MS. PAIGE!!
text: Nearby, we see the trembling Frankie hiding behind a flight of metal
text: stairs, her face covered in wet gore, shivering against the cold.
text: With Kiernan, looking around.
text: His voice echoes. Nearby, a flock of BIRDS scatter out of nowhere into
dialog: a million different directions.
text: WWWHOOOOOSSH! A pipe BURSTS nearby and sends clouds of SMOKE shooting
text: out into the air. Father Kiernan is startled.
text: A wind starts and blows newspapers and various garbage EVERYWHERE, all
dialog: around Father Kiernan.
text: He looks up as nearby a window SHATTERS and glass SHOOTS into a million
text: pieces. He dodges it and moves deeper into the alley --
text: Frankie stands and races away.
text: Kiernan continues looking around...
text: close on a glass bottle as it is smashed --
text: Nearby Donna stops, turns.
text: Kierna stops when he sees her.
text: Frankie is only yards away, sitting hunched on the hood of a car,
text: digging into the metal.
text: Father Kiernan furrows his brow and moves closer to see what she is
dialog: doing.
text: ABOVE Frankie now, we see what she is doing: With a chunk of a broken
text: bottle, she is writing a message into the metal. It's in foreign
text: letters. We hear the scrape of metal against metal.
text: We also hear Frankie's voice, speaking what she is writing. But it's in
text: ANOTHER LANGUAGE. We do not understand her.
text: Among the wind and rain, Kiernan moves closer. Cautious.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Ms. Paige?
text: Silence. She stops and looks at him. Stands on the hood and we realize
text: her eyes are a striking ORANGE, her expression changed, almost demonic.
text: It looks like a standoff. They stare at each other, neither saying a
text: word. Finally, Frankie returns to her work, digging into the metal of
dialog: the car.
speaker_heading: WWHOOOOSSH!
text: A pipe bursts again and more SMOKE is sent out into the air.
text: Kiernan moves closer, holds out a hand. We see the tape recorder from
text: earlier: He presses RECORD.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Ms. Paige.....?
text: She stands and SCREAMS angrily, pointing at him sharply with the broken
dialog: bottle, furious --
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Aalla shatteeen man beesha!!
text: He stares at her, stunned.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Aalla shatteeen man beesha!!
text: She sighs heavily, exhausted.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Frankie!!???
text: Kiernan turns and we see Donna rushing up to them, also exhausted.
text: Standing on the car, Frankie DROPS the broken bottle and collapses onto
text: the hood of the car, sobbing. Kiernan and Donna move to her, and help
text: her off the car, escorting her away. Donna is overcome with concern, as
dialog: is Father Kiernan.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH -- NIGHT
text: We see the CROSS at the top of the building, standing out against the
text: night sky. We PAN DOWN to see the entrance, and Father Kiernan
text: approaching the concrete flight of steps, carrying an unconscious
dialog: Frankie...
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH -- FATHER DERNING'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Father Derning stands to the side as Kiernan adjusts Frankie under the
text: covers, getting her comfortable. She stirs. Wakens.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Welcome back.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Where am I?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: You're in Father Derning's church.
text: Donna walks in and goes over to Frankie, sitting down beside her.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Hey...
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: (Aside to Donna)
dialog: I think she should get some rest.
text: Kiernan leaves with Father Derning. Alone, Donna reaches over and
text: softly strokes Frankie's hair out of her face. She smiles gently.
text: We see the red scars across Frankie's forehead, now cleaned up. Frankie
text: looks up at Donna, half asleep.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: (Softly)
dialog: You alright? You look like shit.
text: She smiles.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Smells like...flowers.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: You got some stuff all in your hair...
text: She reaches over and picks out some scraps of something, smiling at a
text: now sleeping Frankie.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH -- FATHER DERNING'S QUARTERS -- NIGHT
text: Father Kiernan plays back the recording from earlier:
speaker_heading: FRANKIE'S VOICE
dialog: Aalla shatteeen man beesha!!
text: He clicks REWIND and picks up the phone. DIALS. Waits.
scene_heading: INT. ROME -- VATICAN OFFICES -- NIGHT
text: Brother Delmonico is alone in the darkened offices. His figure
text: illuminated by the lone lamp on his desk. The phone rings. He picks it
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: BROTHER DELMONICO
dialog: Pronto.
speaker_heading: INTERCUT
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Johnny? Como esta.
speaker_heading: BROTHER DELMONICO
dialog: Andrew, how are you?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Johnny, listen, could you help me with a translation?
speaker_heading: BROTHER DELMONICO
dialog: Do you have it there?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Y-yes, I have it here.
speaker_heading: BROTHER DELMONICO
dialog: Play it to me.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: I'll play it for you now.
text: He clicks PLAY and holds the recorder up to the phone:
speaker_heading: FRANKIE'S VOICE
dialog: Aalla shatteeen man beesha!!
text: Brother Delmonico listens intently. Thinks.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: What is it? Is it gibberish?
speaker_heading: BROTHER DELMONICO
text: No, no. It's not gibberish at all. Andrew, who's speaking these words?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH -- MORNING
text: With Frankie as she walks into the church, wrapped in a huge blanket.
text: She moves down the aisle, toward a huge CRUCIFIX at the head of the
dialog: altar.
text: She stares up at the crucifix:
text: We see a lifelike replica of JESUS, nailed to the cross. NAILS through
text: his PALMS and FEET. Blood drips down his forehead from the crown of
text: thorns.
text: Observing it, Frankie frowns.
text: Father Kiernan walks into the church, moves to her.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Good morning, Ms. Paige. You're up early.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Hey, I think you made a mistake.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: I can't have stigmata. Jesus was crucified through the palms of his
dialog: hand, not his wrists. Look at my wounds, they're through the wrists.
dialog: So, you're wrong.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Actually, scientists have discovered that in Roman times people were
text: crucified through the wrists, not the palms. There's no way the hands
dialog: could have supported the weight of the body. So they did crucify them
text: through the wrists.
text: Frankie's fascinated.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Wait, wait. You're telling me that every painting, every statue of
dialog: Christ, and every single crucifix in the whole world is wrong?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: (Shaking his head)
dialog: No. Just....inacurate. They are all impressions of the truth. Icons are
dialog: meant to be inspirational.
text: Frankie moves away, toward the exit of the church. Kiernan stops her.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Ms. Paige, there's something else you should know. The words you keep
dialog: repeating that you thought were nonsense. Well it's not.
text: She stops and watches him. Waits for what's to come.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: It's actually a very specific language.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: It's a form of Aramaic that hasn't been used for 1900 years. It's a
dialog: dialect that was used in Galalei around the time of Jesus.
text: Frankie looks at him. Shit.
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX -- ROOF -- NIGHT
text: A quiet night. We find Frankie sitting in solitude on the roof, her
text: legs dangling over the side, her hands cradling her face. She is
text: contemplating something.
text: Her hair blows around her as she looks down at the traffic below.
text: She takes out a small crumpled piece of paper and rereads it.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE (VO)
dialog: Split a piece of wood and I am there. Lift a stone and you will find
dialog: me.
text: She looks off and thinks. Places the paper back inside a pocket and
text: then slowly gets to her feet. Hops across the edge of the roof, and
text: then disappears out of shot....
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ROOM
text: Andrew Kiernan sits, deep in pensive thought.
scene_heading: INT. THE CUT -- MORNING
text: Donna dials a number on the phone. Waits. Looks concerned.
text: Jennifer comes up, concern in her eyes as well.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Did you get through?
speaker_heading: DONNA
text: No. Her machine didn't even pick up.
text: Jennifer nods and walks off. Donna sighs, concerned.
scene_heading: EXT. FRANKIE'S APARTMENT COMPLEX -- MORNING
text: Father Kiernan moves to the buzzer and hits the nameplate PAIGE.
text: He waits. Nothing.
text: The door to the apartment complex opens and a young woman steps out. He
dialog: slides inside....
scene_heading: INT. FRANKIE'S APARTMENT -- MORNING
text: A knock at the door. KNOCK KNOCK. Silence. The door opens and Father
text: Kiernan enters. Looks around for any sign of Frankie. She's nowhere.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Ms. Paige???
text: He walks through the apartment and into the bedroom/living room.....
dialog: in the bedroom/living room
text: he looks and sees Frankie standing by a far wall, her back to him. She
text: is writing in deep concentration on a large, striking blue wall. Black
text: lettering all across the wall. We recognize it from when Frankie was
text: grinding the same letters into the hood of the car.
text: Kiernan moves into the center of the room, watching Frankie.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Ms. Paige???
text: She doesn't acknowledge him, but keeps writing. Working like a woman
dialog: possessed.....
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Frankie? Frankie?
text: Kiernan takes out his hand-held camera and holds it up to the sight.
text: FLASH! He snaps a picture. At the wall, Frankie flinches, pauses, then
text: resumes writing.
dialog: FLASH! FLASH!
text: This obviously disturbs Frankie. She pauses and turns halfway to
text: Kiernan, but then turns back to her mission.
text: We notice something is different about her. Her hair is frizzled, her
text: face a sickly pale. Her skin on her hands and face are WRINKLED, like
text: an old woman. Her eyes rolled back into her head. A gutteral groan
text: rolls out of her mouth as she scribbles the foreign words.
text: Moving closer, Kiernan holds the camera up and FLASHES! another photo.
text: Lowers the camera and watches Frankie with the same haunted look he
text: watched the corpse of FATHER ALAMEIDA....
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Who are you?
text: A long beat. Frankie struggles to turn around and look at him. We
text: notice for the first time the full effect of Frankie's state. Her eyes
text: are in the back of her head, her entire face pale and wrinkled, her
dialog: lips cracked.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE/ALAMEIDA'S VOICE
dialog: (Subtitled)
dialog: The messenger is not important.
text: We are shocked. The voice is not Frankie's. It is a deep, heavily-
text: accented man's voice. Father Alameida's....
text: With that she turns back to her writing, scribbling the letters over
dialog: and over.
text: Kiernan moves to her and FLASHES more pictures. She flinches after each
text: FLASH, but resumes writing.
dialog: FLASH! FLASH! FLASH!
text: She stops, drops the marker and swiftly turns on her heels, stares
text: across the room at a spooked Father Kiernan. Her eyes rolled in the
text: back of her head. Her head bobbing weakly, a gutteral groan coming out
dialog: of her mouth....
text: ......She slowly begins to walk toward Father Kiernan. As she does so,
text: we notice she has a LIMP, as if it's an effort to move her legs. She is
text: also HUNCHED over, grunting with each painful step.
text: Father Kiernan doesn't flinch as she moves toward him, and then past
dialog: him.....
text: .......over to her bed where she drops down onto the covers and sprawls
dialog: out.....
text: Kiernan watches as water DRIP DRIPS down from the ceiling onto her
text: face, cleansing her wounds.
text: Her hands go to her face as the water drips down her fragile skin, over
dialog: her wounds....
text: ......and she is back to normal vitality. She gasps, her own voice
text: coming out of her now.
text: Kiernan watches as she opens her eyes.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: I feel like my heart is breaking. Why am I so sad??
text: She sobs desperately. Then slowly she sits up, looks around.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: It smells like flowers in here....like Jasmine or rose or
dialog: something....Can you smell that?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Yes I can.
text: She stands and walks to the center of the room. Looks up and sees the
text: wall full of writing. She is puzzled.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Who wrote that?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: You did.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: I wrote that?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Yes.
text: They both stand and gaze at the wall. Frankie is truly puzzled. She
dialog: doesn't remember any of it.
scene_heading: EXT. ROME -- VATICAN -- DAY
text: We move over religious statues and we find Cardinal Houseman and Father
text: Dario walking along a cement path in the background.
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: Have you heard from Father Andrew?
speaker_heading: DARIO
dialog: No, your Eminence.
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: What are these?
speaker_heading: DARIO
dialog: These are newspaper clippings from our office in New York. The first
text: one is from Pennsylvania. The others are from New York and Washington.
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: These are even more damaging. This one mentions the stigmata. He
text: doesn't seem to be confusing the situation.
speaker_heading: DARIO
dialog: Shall I call him home?
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: Have him conclude his investigation immediately. Present his report to
dialog: me in New York at the end of next week.
text: Dario nods and walks off. Cardinal Houseman shakes some hands.
scene_heading: INT. FRANKIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY
text: Frankie sits by the window, in awe as a couple doves fly onto her hand
text: and eat out of her palm.
text: Nearby, Kiernan has his camera set up on a tripod, FLASHING photo after
text: photo of the writing on the blue wall. He pauses and turns to her.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Frankie, would you please come over here and have a look at this?
text: She doesn't answer. She stares at the doves, captivated by their
dialog: essence.
dialog: FLASH! FLASH!
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: I just can't believe that none of this means anything to you...Frankie?
dialog: Frankie. Frankie. Can you please...can you please look at this?
dialog: FLASH! FLASH!
text: The noise and FLASH bother the doves and they flitter away, leaving an
text: annoyed Frankie. She sighs and turns to Kiernan, glaring at him.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Sometimes subjects contain fragments or images that can be transmitted
dialog: subconsciously -
text: Frankie moves to her bed and picks up a coat.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: This subject doesn't contain Ofragments of images'. You don't get it,
dialog: do you Father Kiernan? I don't know what the hell that means!
text: She thrusts her hands toward the blue wall.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: (r.e. the bandaged wrists)
dialog: I don't know what the hell this means. I just want my life back, OK!?
text: She storms out. Kiernan sighs.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

dialog: up.
scene_heading: EXT. FLOWER SHOP -- DAY
text: A wide variety of flowers arranged in rows. Frankie moves around them,

speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Ms. Paige, I'm sorry...
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: Don't OMs. Paige' me just because you messed up. I'm not gonna let you
text: off the hook.
text: She holds up a flower for him to smell. He does. Smiles.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Ok. But I...I AM sorry.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: You know, for a priest you're pretty relentless.
text: He nods.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Yeah, I guess I stopped being a priest and slipped back into being a
dialog: scientist. It's a habit.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Hey, what kind of a scientist is a priest, anyway?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: You don't want to know...

speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: You were an organic chemist?? Ok, did you walk around with those
text: glasses with the scotch tape around the sides and pocket protectors?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: I did, actually. (Laughs)
dialog: Anyway, one day I just decided I was gonna become a priest.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Well, why?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: The holes.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: The holes?
text: Frankie listens as she unwraps a fresh pack of cigarettes and lights
dialog: one up.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: The holes in the theories.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: What theories?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: The world is six billion years old, right? There's been life on this
dialog: planet for three billion years, but for three billion years before that
text: there was nothing. No life. Just a bunch of elements swirling around.
text: Frankie watches him.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: And then one day, for no apparent reason whatsoever, all these elements
text: came together in perfect harmony. And there was suddenly LIFE. Living
dialog: things. Like lilac and...hedgehogs..
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Beer, and cheesecake.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: Beer and cheesecake. Did you know that monks invented alcohol?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Yeah, everybody knows that. (Laughs)
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: You knew that? Well, anyways, to get back to the holes, there
dialog: really...there really isn't any explanation. And I figured that there
dialog: was something more than, well, more important than organic chemistry
dialog: going on. And I figured that it was God. And that God was responsible
dialog: for all this life.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: I really can't get a line on you.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: First of all, I can't understand a man who's never, you know...
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Never made love to a woman?
text: She nods. He can't help but smile.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Well this may come as a great surprise to you, but, I wasn't born a
dialog: priest.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: But you didn't like it?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: What's not to like?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: But you don't miss it?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Of course I miss it. I mean I'm human. I struggle with it. But I've
dialog: made a choice. Basically, what I've done is I've exchanged one set of
dialog: complications for another...
text: A beat. Frankie understands what he means and smiles. They continue to
text: carry on the conversation as we watch them. Kiernan smiles at something
text: said, and Frankie reaches over and grabs his ear playfully. An intimate

speaker_heading: CA-CHANK!
text: Frankie SHRIEKS and falters out of her chair at the pain, falling to

dialog: ca-chank! chank!
text: Another image of a nail being driven through a foot.
text: Frankie grasps onto the side of the table to try and get up, but the
text: pain is immense. Blood seeps through both socks on her feet. It spews
text: to the ground.
text: Kiernan stands and rushes to help her --
text: She stumbles up and over to a patch of flowers when suddenly --
text: she relives all the wounds: image of nail being driven through a wrist,
text: another wrist. image of slash marks across her back. image of crown of
text: thorns in her head --
text: Frankie FALLS back into the patch of flowers, eyes going in the back of
text: her head, numb with blinding pain.
dialog: ca-chank! chank!
text: Blood spews around her, and a weak groan rises out of her mouth.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FRANKIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
text: She lies on her bed, watching in pain as Kiernan dabs a wet cloth on

text: feet, round and deep.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: So this is the fourth?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: When I met you, didn't you say there were five wounds? Well this is the
dialog: fourth. What's the fifth?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
text: A spear.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: ....The one that killed him.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Don't worry, Frankie. No stigmatic has ever received the full five
dialog: wounds.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
text: (As he dabs at her feet)
dialog: Have you ever met another person who had stigmata?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: I did make a pilgrimage to a small village in the mountains of Southern
dialog: Italy. There I met a priest called Padre Pio. He first received the
dialog: wounds when he was 23 years of age. The same age as St. Francis of
dialog: Assisi.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Who was St. Francis of Assisi?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: St. Francis was the first person to receive the stigmata. In the 13th
text: century. He was a wild young man who suddenly changed his ways after he
text: had a vision of being crucified alongside Christ. When he woke up, his
dialog: hands and feet were...were bleeding.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: This priest, were his wounds as bad as mine?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Padre Pio? Sometimes he lost a pint of blood a day. And he suffered
text: terrible demonic attacks.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: A priest?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: All stigmatics suffer the most intense spiritual conflicts.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Well, what happened to him? How many wounds did he receive?
text: A long beat. Kiernan sighs.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: He....lived to old age.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: How many wounds did he receive?
text: Another long beat. He looks up at her.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Two.
text: Frankie looks at him closely.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: I'm dying aren't I? This thing is killing me.
text: He doesn't know what to say. She turns away and attempts to sleep.

text: Kiernan on the phone.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN

speaker_heading: INTERCUT

speaker_heading: KIERNAN

speaker_heading: BROTHER DELMONICO
dialog: We discovered a document that looked like it was a completely new

speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Well what's the significance of that?
speaker_heading: BROTHER DELMONICO
dialog: I was one of the three translators of the gospel. It was written

dialog: be Jesus' actual words...
text: He turns and sees Father Dario at the top of the stairs, studying
text: Delmonico with suspicion.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN'S VOICE
dialog: What is it?

speaker_heading: BROTHER DELMONICO
dialog: Pronto.....(speaks in Italian)
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Johnny??
text: Brother Delmonico clicks some buttons, getting rid of the

speaker_heading: KIERNAN'S VOICE
dialog: Johnny, what's going on? Are you there? Johnny?
text: Brother Delmonico hangs up on Kiernan and clicks out of the files.
text: Stands and leaves.
text: He walks up the stairs, passes Father Dario and nods, walking quickly
text: past. Dario stares after him and then looks down at Brother Delmonico's
text: glowing monitor. Moves to it..
text: .....He clicks a few buttons and suddenly the PHOTO OF FRANKIE'S WALL
text: comes up again.

speaker_heading: FATHER DERNING

text: ON THE PHOTO we see what looks like a picture frame to the side of the
text: wall. An elderly man's face visible.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: No. It's a mirror.
speaker_heading: FATHER DERNING
dialog: Well, who else was in the room?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN

speaker_heading: FATHER DERNING
dialog: I thought you said it was just you two.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: (Checking photo)
dialog: 16-A. Do you have the negatives?

speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: (Holding out wrists)

speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: That's great. Really good. You'll be able to get those stitches out

speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: (Unfocused)
dialog: It's good....
text: His hand slides down her cheek and her lips catch it, kissing his palm.

text: Together they walk into the bedroom/living room, and Kiernan is stunned
text: at what he sees:
text: Frankie has covered the blue wall at the far end of the room in red
text: paint, smeared all across the message.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Why did you paint over the wall?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Well, I got bored and I got sick of looking at that thing...

speaker_heading: KIERNAN

speaker_heading: FRANKIE/ALAMEIDA'S VOICE
dialog: Like touching a woman would kill you! Women are joining the...

speaker_heading: FRANKIE/ALAMEIDA'S VOICE
dialog: So that's why you became a priest...
text: Kneels over, picks him up, HURLS him into a mirror, sending GLASS

speaker_heading: FRANKIE/ALAMEIDA'S VOICE
dialog: It has nothing to do with your convenient little stories!!

text: close up: a drawer as FRANKIE opens it and grabs a sharp knife --

speaker_heading: FRANKIE/ALAMEIDA'S VOICE
dialog: Blood of Christ!

dialog: (Sighing)Look, all I know is, the girl is fighting for her life. If she
dialog: receives another wound she is going to die unless we help her.
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: I'm taking over this case. Go back to Father Derning's, get some rest-
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: (Firm)
dialog: I'm not leaving her alone!
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: You're not leaving her alone. You're leaving her in the care of the
dialog: Sisters..
dialog: Kiernan has had it.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Look. You sent me here. I didn't want to come. You told me to deal with
dialog: her. That's what I'm doing!
text: He stands and storms out of the room, Cardinal Houseman following.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: She's in no condition to take on you or the church...
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: This is not about a girl taking on me, or taking on the church --
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH -- OFFICES -- NIGHT
text: They move through the desks up to the staircase.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Why are you so concerned about those photographs? Why is that more
dialog: important than a girl bleeding to death?
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: Andrew, what's happened to you? Where's your loyalty?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Don't you lecture me about loyalty, Daniel!
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: The only reason you've been tolerated by the Congregation for so long
dialog: is because you were a good scientist. Because of your objectivity. But
dialog: you've lost that. The last thing I expected to see when I walked into
dialog: that girl's apartment was the two of you lying on a bed together --
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Oh come on -!
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: Look, I know you think you're helping her, but you're not. If anything,
dialog: she's getting worse. Andrew, you're in no state to help anyone right
dialog: now. You're exhausted. Look at you. Go to Father Derning's. Get some
dialog: rest. We'll talk about it tomorrow.
text: A beat. They move further up the stairs.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Why are you so concerned about those photographs?
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: Father Delmonico showed them to us. He seemed to think they were
dialog: important.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: What do they mean?
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: We've no idea. But we're working on it.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Does it have anything to do with the gospel commission?
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: We don't know. Good-night Andrew.
text: He sighs and pauses. Then he steps to the door and leaves.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET -- NIGHT
text: We see Father Kiernan's car move PAST camera, under the pouring
dialog: rain....
scene_heading: EXT. FATHER DERNING'S CHURCH -- NIGHT
text: The bold cross against the night sky. Father Kiernan moves to the
text: entrance and walks inside....
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH -- NIGHT
text: The lonely figure of Father Kiernan sitting in a pew, with his back to
text: us. Suddenly Marion Petrocelli appears in the pew, watching Kiernan.
speaker_heading: PETROCELLI
dialog: Andrew Kiernan?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: I'm Kiernan.
speaker_heading: PETROCELLI
dialog: I want to see Alameida?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: (Sighing)
dialog: I don't know any Alameida.
text: Petrocelli moves to Kiernan's side and sits down.
speaker_heading: PETROCELLI
dialog: Delmonico faxed me this copy of his document.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: (Looking at the fax)
dialog: The girl wrote this. I saw her do it. What is this?
speaker_heading: PETROCELLI
dialog: It's maybe the most significant Christian relic ever found.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: PETROCELLI
text: It's an Aramaic scroll from the 1st century, discovered near the cave
dialog: of the dead sea scrolls outside Jeruselum. Alameida and I concluded
dialog: that it is a gospel of Jesus Christ. In his own words: Aramaic. There
dialog: are some from the Vatican who believe that this document could destroy
dialog: the authority of the modern church.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: PETROCELLI
text: It was Jesus' words to his disciples on the night of his Last Supper.
text: His instructions to them on how to continue his church after his death.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Why would that be so threatening?
speaker_heading: PETROCELLI
dialog: When we gave our initial conclusion to the gospel commission, Houseman
dialog: ordered us to stop our work immediately. Alameida refused. He stole the
dialog: document and disappeared. Houseman excommunicated us in our absense.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: You have no idea where he is?
speaker_heading: PETROCELLI
text: He doesn't want to be caught until he finishes the translation.
text: He reveals the photo of himself, Father Pabloe Alameida, and Father
dialog: Derning.
speaker_heading: PETROCELLI
dialog: That's Delmonico, me and Alameida. We were all translating the new
dialog: gospel together.
text: Kiernan looks at it. Points to Alameida.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: I've seen this man. Three weeks ago. In Brazil.
speaker_heading: PETROCELLI
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
text: He's dead.
text: Petrocelli looks at him.
speaker_heading: PETROCELLI
dialog: How do you know this?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Because I saw him in his coffin in the church in Belo Quinto. I'm
dialog: sorry.
text: Petrocelli sighs and looks off. Hopeless.
speaker_heading: PETROCELLI
text: Then it is all over. It's gone forever.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Why was your work stopped? What was so threatening about this gospel?
text: Kiernan is confused. Petrocelli stands and walks down the aisle.
speaker_heading: PETROCELLI
dialog: Look around, Father. What do you see?
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: I see a church.
speaker_heading: PETROCELLI
dialog: (Shrugs)
dialog: It's a building. The true church of Jesus Christ is so much more. Not
dialog: in buildings made of wood and stone. I love Jesus. I don't need an
dialog: institution between him and me. You see, just God.
text: Up at the altar, on the large wall looming in front of the rest of the
text: church, is a gold replica of the cross and Jesus, surrounded by his
text: disciples. Nails through palms, feet. Crown of thorns. Spear through
dialog: his side.
speaker_heading: PETROCELLI
dialog: No priest, no churches. The first words in Jesus' goispel are: "The
dialog: kingdom of God is inside you. And all around you. Not in buildings made
dialog: from wood and stone. Split a piece of wood and I am there. Lift a
dialog: stone...
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: (Picking up)
dialog: ...And you will find me.
speaker_heading: PETROCELLI
dialog: Yes, brother.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: (r.e. Alameida's photo)
dialog: Why is Father Alameida wearing gloves?
speaker_heading: PETROCELLI
text: Alameida was a tormented man. A holy man. A very holy man. He wore the
text: gloves to cover the marks of the stigmata.
text: Petrocelli moves back and sits down beside Kiernan. Runs a hand through
text: his hair. Kiernan stares off.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: She has the stigmata. That's why...She's just his messenger....
speaker_heading: PETROCELLI
dialog: Houseman will never let this Gospel get out.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH -- ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Cardinal Houseman kneels before a small crucifix, praying. Father Dario
text: prepares holy water in a tiny bowl.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH -- FRANKIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Frankie is holding Alameida's rosary against her chest as she sleeps.
text: Suddenly hands appear and lift up hers, taking away the rosary. This
text: stirs her and she awakens, sits up.
text: The two nuns surround her, and Cardinal Houseman steps up to the bed
text: with the Bible, followed by Father Dario who holds out the bowl of holy
text: water. Frankie stares around her, confused.
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: Lord, do not remember our sins. Or those of our forefathers...
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Where's Andrew?
text: Cardinal Houseman begins to recite from the Bible.
speaker_heading: DARIO
dialog: Do not punish us for our offenses..
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: Lead us not into temptation...
text: We realize they are performing an exorcism on Frankie! She sits up,
dialog: frightened.
text: Cardinal Houseman continues to recite.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET -- NIGHT
text: Kiernan drives past camera, speeding toward the church with
dialog: determination.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH -- FRANKIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: As Cardinal Houseman recites, Frankie's body begins to convulse as she
text: is held down by the nuns. Groans and grunts escape her lips as she
text: writhes under the covers.
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: By the power of Christ I command you, come out of her body now and for
dialog: always...
text: She writhes and groans...
speaker_heading: FRANKIE/ALAMEIDA'S VOICE
dialog: You are blind men! Your eyes are open, but you see nothing!
text: She writhes and thrashes as the nuns attempt to hold her down. Father
text: Dario echoes the recitation as Cardinal Houseman continues.
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: Give her heavenly protection--
text: Frankie SITS UP and stares at the ceiling, SCREAMS, a gale of powerful
dialog: voices.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE/ALAMEIDA'S VOICE
dialog: BEHOLD! Your devil dripping with blood!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET -- NIGHT
text: Kiernan SPEEDS around sharp corners and races down the street.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH -- FRANKIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: The exorcism continues. Frankie lashes out and writhes and thrashes.
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: Embrace me, my child. I am the church!
speaker_heading: FRANKIE/ALAMEIDA'S VOICE
dialog: You are the true enemy of the church, Houseman!
text: Suddenly Cardinal Houseman rushes forward to Frankie.
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: OUT! Get out!
text: The nuns quickly do as they are told. Father Dario walks to the door,
text: lingers, watches Cardinal Houseman.
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: Get out!!
text: Father Dario races out.
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: Save this woman, Lord, and let the enemy have no victory over her!
text: Now alone with Frankie/Alameida, Cardinal Houseman reaches for her and
text: GRABS HER BY THE NECK, and proceeds to suffocate her.
text: Frankie fights for her life, grunting as he squeezes her neck, a wild
text: flare in his eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH -- NIGHT
text: Kiernan's car races up and he parks it, races inside.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH -- FRANKIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Cardinal Houseman continues to strangle Frankie...
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: You will not destroy my church.
text: She groans for air...
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH -- NIGHT
text: He flies through the rooms, up the flight of stairs.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Frankie!! Frankie!
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT
text: Father Kiernan flies down the hallway, calling out for Frankie. He
text: approaches her door and is stopped by Father Dario. He quickly THROWS
text: Father Dario out of the way and opens the door, racing inside --
scene_heading: INT. FRANKIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: He sees Cardinal Houseman bent over Frankie, strangling her. He races
text: to the bed.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: What are you doing!? Get away from her!
text: He grabs Cardinal Houseman and throws him off of Frankie, using all the
text: strength he can. He turns to Frankie and makes sure she's alright. She
text: is gasping for air.
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: Andrew, get away from her! You don't know what's going on!
text: Now he turns to Cardinal Houseman and grabs him, shoving him out of the
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: You lied to me! You tried to silence her. You lied to me --!
text: He throws him out of the room --
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE FRANKIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Father Dario watches helplessly as Kiernan shoves Cardinal Houseman
text: against the wall.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: You tried to kill her! I know everything. I know why you closed down
dialog: the gospel commission. I know why you had Petrocelli and Alameida
dialog: excommunicated. I know all those lies you've been telling for years!
dialog: There is no way you'll get away with what you did to her!
speaker_heading: CARDINAL HOUSEMAN
dialog: I will not let you destroy the church.
text: He throws Cardinal Houseman against another wall.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: I promise you. You've spent your last days in the Church.
text: Cardinal Houseman is defeated. Kiernan lets him out of his grip and
text: turns back to Frankie's room, walking in.
scene_heading: INT. FRANKIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: A bright, raging fire in the firing place. Suddenly it SHOOTS out to
text: blankets in the room and spreads like wildfire, over a statue of the
dialog: Virgin Mary.
text: In bed, Frankie suddenly sits up, her head leaned back, her mouth open,
text: fresh blood trickling down her face.
text: Kiernan walks into the room cautiously, sees the fire, then looks at
dialog: Frankie. Pauses.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Are you Pablo Alameida?
text: WWHOOOSSH! The blankets around the bed erupt in spots of fire, uniting
text: into one cloud of fierce flames, surrounding the calm figure of
text: Frankie, who now sits staring at Father Kiernan as he moves closer. He
text: reaches out his hand.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Give me your wisdom. Let me be your messenger.
text: WWHOOOOSSHH! Fire continues to spread. Now the entire room is engulfed
text: in angry flames.
text: Through the fire, we see Frankie's serene face staring at Father
text: Kiernan. When she speaks her voice echoes.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE/KIERNAN'S VOICE
dialog: The messenger believes. The messenger has faith. You have only doubt.
text: Kiernan moves closer to the bed.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Jesus said OThe Kingdom of God is inside you. And all around you. Not
text: in mansions of wood and stone. Split a piece of wood and I am there.
text: FIRE FLARES around her...
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: ...Lift a stone, and you will find me.
speaker_heading: CA-CHANK!
text: Frankie SCREAMS as she feels the pain of nails --
text: slashing marks break out into the air, blood shooting
text: Frankie falls back onto the bed, groaning from pain.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Father Alameida, I call upon you to release this woman. Give her grace
dialog: and let her not come into the ways of harm.
dialog: ca-chank!
text: Crown of thorns being beaten into her flesh. Blood pours down her face
text: as she SCREAMS desperately.
dialog: ca-chank! chank! slash! ca-chank!
text: She relives every wound, wincing and stiffening at the pain on her
text: wrists, feet, back, and forehead.
text: hyper insert father alameida's face, staring at us through the haze of
text: fire, alive.
text: hyper insert image of the weeping statue of the virgin of guadalupe.
text: the tears of blood down her face
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: God bless your soul, Father Alameida. And go in peace.
text: Crying out, Frankie falls back onto the bed.
text: The pain is gone. The fire remains thriving as Kiernan steps up to the
text: bed and gently takes the weak Frankie in his arms, carries her out of
dialog: bed.....
text: .....As they make their way to the doorway, the flames envelope them
text: but they walk through the brightness, unharmed.
text: Slowly the fire begins to weaken and gradually all pulls back toward
text: the fireplace. We see the flames disappear from the Virgin Mary statue.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH -- COURTYARD -- SUNRISE
text: Father Kiernan walks into the courtyard and up to a bench, cradling the
text: wrapped-up Frankie, who sleeps in his arms.
text: The morning sun is bright and the breeze soothing over Frankie's face.
text: Kiernan sits down on the bench and watches Frankie.
text: She stirs and her eyes open. She watches him. Looks weak. She groans.
speaker_heading: KIERNAN
dialog: Stay with me...
text: She reaches out weakly with her hand and touches his mouth with her
text: fingers lovingly. Leans forward and kisses his lips. He gives in and
text: they share a long kiss. A beat. She pulls away --
text: --- and out of his arms, walking across the grass. Suddenly a DOVE
text: descends the air and lands on her hand. She stands with the DOVE,
text: gently stroking it. Smiles and turns back to KIERNAN, who remains
text: seated on the bench. He watches and smiles.
text: The dove flies out of Frankie's hand and she watches as it disappears
text: back up into the air...
text: ...We ascend the air with the dove, the figures of Frankie and Kiernan
dialog: becoming smaller and smaller...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BELO QUINTO -- CHURCH -- DAY
text: We see the modest, small church. Empty.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH -- DAY
text: We see again the striking statue of the crying Virgin of Guadalupe. The
text: blood remains dripping down her face.
text: We see Father Kiernan move down the aisle toward the altar. The rest of
text: the church is empty besides a cleaning lady.
text: He walks up to the statue and gazes at it. Turns and moves to the floor
text: beside the statue. Kneels down. Reveals a KNIFE and begins to dig at
dialog: the floor...
text: ....Unearths a loose floorboard, removes it, and we see SCROLLS on
text: PAPYRUS in the earth.
text: He takes them out and unravels them. We see the same lettering on the
text: scrolls as in Frankie's apartment.
text: He also finds the small book Father Alameida wrote the translations in.
text: He opens it, reads it as:
speaker_heading: FRANKIE (VO)
dialog: Jesus said, 'The kingdom of God is inside you and all around you....
speaker_heading: PETROCELLI (VO)
dialog: ....Not in mansions made from wood and stone. Split a piece of wood and

speaker_heading: FADE DOWN
text: In 1945 a scroll was discovered in nag hamadi, which is described as

dialog: This scroll, the gospel of st. thomas, has been claimed by scholars
