speaker_heading: AT THE GATE

scene_heading: EXT. MIAMI AIRPORT, CURBSIDE -- DAY

speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: Where to?
text: Welles keeps watching, sees the limo pull away and pass.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Follow that limousine. Don't get
dialog: too close, don't let it get too far
dialog: away. Just keep with it.
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: You kidding?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Nope.
text: The cab set in motion. Welles takes out cigarettes,
text: lighting one, takes out a small NOTEPAD and makes notations.
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: Uh, listen... you're not supposed to
dialog: be smoking in here. I'm sorry,
dialog: that's company policy...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: How about this... every cigarette I
dialog: smoke, I give you five dollars?
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: Okay... okay, yeah, that'd be good...

text: with TELEPHOTO LENS: whir, CLICK, whir, CLICK, whir, CLICK...
text: Welles lowers the camera, letting out a yawn.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPLANE, COACH -- NIGHT
text: The familiar DRONE of flight. Welles is shoehorned into his

text: An OLDER WOMAN arrives in the aisle. Welles picks up his
text: tray, closes his tray table, unbuckling his seatbelt,
text: struggling to get up... finally successful, balancing his
text: tray, letting the woman in to the window seat.
speaker_heading: OLDER WOMAN

text: and pretty, holding one hand on a BABY STROLLER beside her.
text: Welles comes to her, embracing her, appreciating her.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Welcome home.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Do you know how much I missed you?
text: They kiss, but Amy pulls away, sniffs him.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What's this... have you been
dialog: smoking... ?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Smoking? I'm not smoking.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Your clothing reeks of it.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: You know, Amy, I've been sitting
dialog: around in bars and everywhere
dialog: following this guy... I mean, is
dialog: this what I get first thing? Before
dialog: you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'm not accusing you...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Okay, I believe you.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: We've been all through that. I've
dialog: been on my best behavior.
text: Welles bends to the stroller, picks up his infant daughter,
text: CINDY, and hoists her in the air, overjoyed.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Hello, pumpkin-head, did you miss
dialog: me? I sure missed you...
text: He kisses the happy child, holding her in one arm.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Let's get my bags and get the hell
dialog: out of here.
text: Welles pulls Amy close and kisses her again, leads the way.
text: Amy follows, pushing the stroller.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: How's the detective business?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Business was fine. I'll tell you
dialog: what, you couldn't pay me enough to
dialog: live down there.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You better not be smoking, that's
dialog: all I can say.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Honey, I'm not, please...
text: Amy takes Welles hand, smiling at him.
scene_heading: INT. WELLES' HOUSE, BEDROOM -- NIGHT
text: Welles and Amy make love in the darkness. Standard,
text: missionary position sex, little passion. They slow to a
text: finish, uneventfully, holding each other. Their breathing
text: quiets. Their daughter CINDY can be HEARD CRYING elsewhere.
text: Welles kisses his wife again, rolls off of her and sits on
text: the edge of the bed. Amy covers herself.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I love you.
text: He looks towards her in the dark. He gets up, gets a towel
text: from the bathroom and wraps it around him.
scene_heading: INT. WELLES' HOUSE, BABY'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Cindy's crying. Welles enters, goes to lean into the crib.
speaker_heading: WELLES

dialog: PHOTOS show the Young Republican and Gaudy Woman in Miami:
text: leaving the Art Deco hotel, the Discotheque, a restaurant...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Your son-in-law dealt with the dry
dialog: cleaning franchise during the day,
dialog: saw that woman every night.
dialog: (clears his throat)
dialog: The specifics are in the report, and
dialog: information about the woman. It's
dialog: unpleasant, I know. I apologize...
speaker_heading: POLITICIAN
dialog: None too discreet, is he?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: No, sir, he is not.
speaker_heading: POLITICIAN
dialog: He's an imbecile. I tried to warn
dialog: my daughter, but what can you do?
text: The politician shakes his head in disgust. Welles rises.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: The um... you'll find my invoice in
dialog: the envelope. If that's all...
speaker_heading: POLITICIAN
dialog: Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Certainly, Senator. If I can ever
dialog: be of further assistance.
text: Welles leaves, glances back, shuts the door.
scene_heading: EXT. HARRISBURG STREETS -- DAY
text: Welles drives his plain Ford past the CAPITAL BUILDING.
scene_heading: EXT. HARRISBURG, BRIDGE -- DAY
text: Welles' car crosses the Susquehanna, leaving the city.
scene_heading: EXT. WELLES' HOUSE, BACKYARD -- DAY
text: Sunny day. Welles wears tan khakis, T-shirt and fishing
text: cap, mowing his lawn with his ROARING lawnmower. Welles'
text: yard is modest, surrounding his modest split level suburban
text: one in a neighborhood of similar homes and similar yards.
text: Welles turns the lawnmower, stopping to mop his brow. One
text: of his neighbors is repainting a back porch. The neighbor
text: waves. Welles waves, resumes mowing.
scene_heading: INT. BOWLING ALLEY -- NIGHT
text: MUSIC'S LOUD. League Night. Every lane full. Welles is
text: with his team in BOWLING SHIRTS. Welles hoists his ball,
text: preparing to bowl. He takes three steps, releases...
text: Down the lane, PINS SCATTER. One pin remains standing.
text: Welles balls up his fists and curses, walks back towards his
text: rowdy, mocking teammates. He shouts back at them, laughing,
text: grabbing his beer and drinking, waiting at the ball return.
scene_heading: INT. WELLES' HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT
text: Dinner. Welles and Amy eat at the kitchen table with Cindy
text: in a high chair. Amy feeds Cindy between bites. Welles is
text: still in his league shirt.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You think you'll have time for the
dialog: water heater this weekend?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Sure. I'll call the guy.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You're not using the same guy who
dialog: tried to fix it?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I'm not using him again for
dialog: anything. He was worthless.
dialog: (eating)
dialog: You have bridge here Saturday?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Betty's out of town so we're playing
dialog: next week.
text: Welles nods, eating. He watches Amy feed Cindy. The PHONE
text: starts RINGING. Welles goes to answer it.
speaker_heading: WELLES
speaker_heading: (into PHONE)
dialog: Hello. Yes... could you hold on a
dialog: minute...?
text: Welles hands the phone to Amy, pats Cindy's head as he heads
text: downstairs, through the LIVING ROOM...
scene_heading: INT. WELLES' HOUSE, OFFICE -- NIGHT
text: Welles enters his well kept OFFICE, turns on a light at the
text: desk. The room is filled with FILE CABINETS and shelves of
text: BOOKS, hundreds of PHONE BOOKS and a COPY MACHINE. Welles
text: picks up the phone and cups the receiver.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (shouts upstairs)
dialog: Okay, I've got it.
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello... sorry, I was switching
dialog: phones. It's a pleasure to make
dialog: your acquaintance, Mrs. Christian.
dialog: (listens)
dialog: Yes. Yes, I understand... tomorrow
dialog: evening should be fine...
text: Welles listens, clears space on his desk, taking notes.
scene_heading: EXT. CHRISTIAN COMPOUND -- DUSK
text: A huge OLD WORLD MANSION is situated at the center of acres

text: Welles follows a BUTLER down a long hall.
scene_heading: INT. CHRISTIAN HOUSE, LIBRARY -- NIGHT
text: The butler shows Welles in, shuts the door.
text: Towering SHELVES of BOOKS are serviced by ladders. Far
text: across the room, an old, sad woman, MRS. CHRISTIAN, sits
text: waiting with a tall, thin, sinister ghoul of a LAWYER.
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN
dialog: Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I try to be.
text: Welles crosses towards them. It takes a while.
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN
dialog: I appreciate your coming on such
dialog: short notice.
text: Mrs. Christian holds out her hand and Welles takes it.
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN
dialog: This is Mister Longdale, my late
dialog: husband's attorney.
text: Welles shakes Longdale's limp hand, looking him over.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Uh huh, pleasure.
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN
dialog: Apparently Mr. Longdale has
dialog: something he feels he simply must
dialog: say before you and I speak.
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: Yes, I do have something to say. I
dialog: insisted on being here as soon as I
dialog: heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I'm listening.
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: As Mr. Christian's attorney and one
dialog: of the executors of his estate, it
dialog: concerns me that a meeting of this
dialog: sort should take place without my
dialog: being asked to attend.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Of what sort?
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: You are a private investigator?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: Well, whatever reasons Mrs.
dialog: Christian has for engaging the
dialog: services of a private investigator,
dialog: I should certainly be a party to.
dialog: But, since she feels differently, I
dialog: can only go on the record as having
dialog: expressed my adamant disapproval.
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN
dialog: Yes, how theatrical. So you've gone
dialog: on the record, and now perhaps you
dialog: should just be gone.
text: Longdale's irritated, but has no choice. He walks away.
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN
dialog: Have a pleasant evening.
dialog: (to Welles)
dialog: Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Thank you.
text: Mrs. Christian begins pouring tea from the service on a
text: table. Welles watches Longdale exit.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: He's odd.
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN
dialog: He's a lawyer.
dialog: (offers tea)
dialog: Please, sit, here...
text: Welles accepts a dainty tea cup and saucer, taking a seat.
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN
dialog: I've spoken to friends of mine and
dialog: my husband's, in Harrisburg, in
dialog: Lancaster and Hershey. Asking about
dialog: you. I must say you have friends in
dialog: influential places.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I've been privileged to provide
dialog: services for people I admire.
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN
dialog: You are highly recommended. Praised
dialog: for your discretion... your strict
dialog: adherence to confidentiality.
text: Welles nods, sipping tea.
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN
dialog: As you know, my husband passed away
dialog: recently. Two weeks ago now.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: My condolences.
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN
dialog: His passing has left me with...
text: something of a dilemma. A terrible,
text: terrible dilemma.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I'll do whatever I can to help.
text: Mrs. Christian studies Welles.
scene_heading: INT. CHRISTIAN HOUSE, MR CHRISTIAN'S OFFICE -- NIGHT
text: Mrs. Christian and Welles enter. This office has been lived
text: in for a lifetime. Giant DESK. AMERICAN FLAG. Walls
text: covered in old b+w PHOTOGRAPHS and ACHIEVEMENTS. A large,
text: baked enamel sign nailed up, "CHRISTIAN STEEL."
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN
text: His inner sanctum.
text: Welles looks up at the OIL PAINTING over the fireplace: MR.
text: CHRISTIAN, a powerful, old man, posed with a dark, teeming,
text: industrial landscape behind him.
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN
dialog: Not many people have been inside
dialog: this room.
text: Welles examines PHOTOS of Mr. Christian visiting various
text: STEEL PLANTS, COAL MINES and ground-breaking ceremonies,
text: shaking hands with WORKMEN, with POLITICIANS.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Pittsburgh?
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN
dialog: Mostly. That's where he started his
dialog: empire building.
dialog: (looks up at portrait)
dialog: He was a good man. Notorious as an
dialog: eccentric, but that was something he
dialog: cultivated. He wanted to be
dialog: legendary.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: He succeeded.
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN
dialog: We were married forty-five years.
dialog: Hard even for me to imagine. We had
dialog: our troubles. There were plenty of
dialog: places for him to be other than
dialog: here, but he was always loyal to me,
dialog: and I to him. I loved him deeply.
text: Welles waits.
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN
dialog: Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I wear a gun when I can tell a
dialog: client expects me to. Other than
dialog: that, there's never any reason.
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN
dialog: Just curious.
text: Mrs. Christian crosses to take down a PICTURE, revealing a
text: WALL SAFE. The safe is ajar, burnt and scarred, broken into.
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN
dialog: My husband was the only one with the
dialog: combination to this safe. I knew
dialog: about it, but as far as I was
dialog: concerned it was none of my
dialog: business. Not till now, that is.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: You hired someone to open it. I'll
dialog: bet the lawyer loved that.
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN
dialog: There was nothing he could do. My
dialog: husband left everything to me.
dialog: (looks at safe)
dialog: I prevented anyone from seeing the
dialog: contents. I felt these were my
dialog: husband's private things. I
dialog: didn't... I didn't realize...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Do you want to tell me what you
dialog: found?
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN
dialog: Cash, stock certificates, and this...
text: She takes something from her pocket, puts it on the desk: a
text: plastic bag containing a short 8MM FILM on a plastic reel.
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN
dialog: It's a film... of a girl being
dialog: murdered.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I'm afraid I don't...
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN
text: This is a movie showing a girl being
text: murdered. She's sitting on a bed,
text: and a man rapes her... and he begins
dialog: to cut her with a knife...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I only watched what I could.
text: Welles picks up the film, looks at it.
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN
dialog: I didn't know what to think. I
dialog: can't tell you how horrible it's
dialog: been, to know this belonged to my
dialog: husband. To know that he watched
dialog: this... this atrocity. But, I can't
dialog: go to the police...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Mrs. Christian... please, will you
dialog: sit down a moment?
dialog: (leads her to a chair)
dialog: I want you to listen carefully.
dialog: What you're talking about is a
dialog: "snuff film." But, from what I
dialog: know, snuff films are a kind of...
dialog: urban myth. Like, red light
dialog: district folklore. There's no such
dialog: thing, I can assure you.
text: Mrs. Christian shakes her head.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Please, believe me. This is
text: probably a stag film. Simulated
dialog: rape. Hard to stomach, and it might
dialog: seem real, but there are ways of
dialog: making it look realistic... fake
dialog: blood and special effects...
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: If you were to study it you'd see
dialog: the camera cutting away... you'd see
dialog: the tricks they can play...
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN
dialog: I'm telling you it's not that.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I'm sure it is.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: It's probably something your husband
dialog: was given as a bad joke. More than
dialog: likely he never even watched it.
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN
dialog: Will you watch it and see for
dialog: yourself?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Of course. But, I'm certain it's
dialog: nothing to worry about.
scene_heading: INT. CHRISTIAN HOUSE, DINING ROOM -- NIGHT
text: An 8MM PROJECTOR faces a wall. Welles looks back to Mrs.
text: Christian in the doorway. Mrs. Christian leaves, shuts the
text: door. Darkness. Welles turns on the projector and sits.
text: The PROJECTOR CLATTERS, shooting bright images...
text: ON THE WALL: FLASH FRAMES, over exposure, then... the grainy
text: FILM is HAND HELD, constantly in motion, showing a skinny
text: GIRL, 16 or 17, in a negligee, sitting on a bed in a
text: nondescript room with little furniture. Looks like a hotel
text: room. We only ever see three walls. The once beautiful
text: girl looks worn, drugged, dark circles under her eyes,
text: staring blankly. The CAMERA'S tungsten SPOTLIGHT casts
text: long, shifting shadows as the camera moves, but the girl
text: still stares oblivious. The bed is wrapped in PLASTIC and
text: DUCT TAPE. The floor is covered by PLASTIC SHEETING...
text: Welles watches, crossing his arms, already uncomfortable.
text: ON THE WALL: a door opens behind the girl, looks like a
text: bathroom, and a MASKED MAN enters.
text: The Masked Man wears a garish, Mexican WRESTLING MASK with
text: eye holes and a mouth. The mask covers his entire head.
text: He's naked except for red shorts, his body scrawny, oiled,
text: pale. The man goes to stand in front of the girl. He seems
text: to be saying something to her, but the film is silent and
text: the ONLY SOUND is the PROJECTOR'S LOUD sprocket hole
text: CLATTER. It's all one long take. The CAMERA MOVES to favor
dialog: the girl...
text: Welles sits straight in his chair, wary.
text: ON THE WALL: Masked Man raises his open hand and SLAPS the
text: girl, knocking her back on the bed...
text: Welles grimaces.
text: ON THE WALL: Masked Man pulls the girl back to a seated
text: position. The girl's like a rag doll, face reddened, eyes
text: closed, but she remains upright. Masked Man uses his thumbs
text: to open her unseeing eyes. He touches her mouth with his
text: fingers, presses his lips to hers. Then, Masked Man backs
text: away, leaving frame, till the CAMERA MOVES to find Masked
text: Man standing at a table with THREE large BOWIE KNIFES laid
text: out. Masked Man runs his fingers over the blades...
text: Welles rises slowly, still watching.
text: ON THE WALL: Masked Man selects a huge Bowie knife and moves
text: back towards the girl...
text: Welles crosses his arms tight, disbelieving, fearful.
text: WE WILL NEVER SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IN THE FILM, but Welles
text: does. In the flickering, reflected light, Welles backs
text: involuntarily away from the horrible images, holding his
text: fist to his mouth, breathing hard.
text: Welles keeps backing away, till he's backed against a wall.
text: The PROJECTOR'S CLATTERING. Welles is sickened, sweating,
text: still watching, till he finally shuts his eyes.
scene_heading: INT. CHRISTIAN HOUSE, ADJOINING ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Silence. Mrs. Christian sits waiting, troubled.
text: The door to the dining room opens and Welles enters from the
text: dark, visibly shaken. Mrs. Christian watches him, her
dialog: sorrow now shared.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: You... you need to go to the police.
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN
dialog: I told you I can't, not yet.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: You don't have any other choice.
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN
dialog: (stands, shakes her head)
dialog: No. For me to live with the ruin of
dialog: my husband's name, I need know that
dialog: whoever did this will be punished.
dialog: If you can find them, I will take
dialog: their names to the police. I'll say
dialog: my husband confessed on his death
dialog: bed. I'll say I didn't have courage
dialog: to come forward at first...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: It won't work like that.
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN
dialog: Any evidence you collect can be
dialog: given to the police later,
dialog: anonymously. I've thought about it
dialog: and there's no other way. If you
dialog: can't find them... if the only thing
dialog: that comes from this film is that
dialog: this is all my husband will be
dialog: remembered for, well I can't let
dialog: that happen. I'm telling you I
dialog: won't. If there's no chance that
dialog: poor girl's memory can be served,
dialog: then I'll just have to spend my last
text: days trying to forget her.
text: Welles sits, rests his head in his hands.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I deal in divorce cases. Corporate
dialog: investigations...
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN
dialog: You've found missing persons before.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Nothing remotely like this.
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN
dialog: I know what I'm asking. Your
dialog: compensation will be appropriate to
dialog: the risk. You'll need cash to buy
dialog: information, and I'll provide it.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You saw what he did to her.
text: Welles stands, torn apart and uncertain, looks back to the
text: dining room where the projector sits idle.

scene_heading: INT. WELLES' HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT
text: Welles twists the lock box dial's combination, opens the box
text: to reveal his GUN, HOLSTER and CLEANING SUPPLIES. Welles
text: takes out the gun, cleaning it. Amy watches.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: This is the mortgage. This is
dialog: Cindy's college money.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I understand.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Sometimes you can't know what I'm
dialog: doing. It's better that way.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: It's a missing persons case... a
dialog: long shot. I'll give it two months,
dialog: two months at most, then I'll be
dialog: back. We'll take a vacation.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Why the gun?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I'm not gonna need it. I won't even
dialog: wear it. It's a precaution.
dialog: (cleaning gun)
dialog: Don't worry about me.
scene_heading: INT. WELLES' HOUSE, OFFICE -- NIGHT
text: Welles looks through one file cabinet. He pulls out a FILE.

text: Welles puts in a magnifying EYEPIECE, leaning close...

text: RED BULB in the light socket. Welles threads the 8MM FILM
text: into his enlarger, still in white gloves.
text: He flicks the enlarger on, projecting a sideways IMAGE down
text: onto the enlarger's baseboard, FOCUSING... it's the girl
text: sitting on the bed, early in the snuff film.
text: Welles makes an adjustment to the enlarger's lens; framing
text: tighter on the girl's face, REFOCUSING.
scene_heading: INT. WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Welles comes out of the makeshift darkroom, holding a PHOTO
text: of the girl. He props the photo up on a dresser, stands
text: looking at it. Sad girl, staring forward.
text: Welles goes to pick up his CELLULAR PHONE, dials.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello, honey, it's me.
dialog: (listens)
dialog: I'm fine, how are you?
text: Welles listens. He turns to look at the girl's photo.

text: IN ONE CUBICLE, Welles opens his billfold, shows his
text: identification: a laminated "LICENSED INVESTIGATOR,
text: Commonwealth of Pennsylvania", with WELLES' PHOTO...
text: The DIRECTOR of the center, a tired looking official in
text: bifocals, studies the card. Welles sits.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Call me Tom.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Alright, Tom.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: What I'd like, very simply, is
dialog: access to your archive. And, now I
dialog: understand this isn't something you
dialog: normally do for private citizens...
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: There are reasons for the way we do
dialog: things here.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Absolutely. Of course I'll abide by
dialog: whatever decision you make, but I'd
dialog: appreciate if you'll hear me out...
text: The director sits back in his chair.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Few days ago, I was contacted by a
dialog: couple living in Philadelphia, a
dialog: doctor and his wife. What happened
dialog: was they picked up a young girl
text: hitchhiking off 81, which heads into
dialog: Philadelphia, started up a
dialog: conversation with this girl, she
dialog: looked homeless, seemed about
dialog: eighteen maybe. They convinced her
dialog: to let them buy her a meal in the
dialog: city. Nice kid, mature, didn't have
dialog: much to say, but they got a sense
dialog: she's a runaway, so all through
text: dinner the doctor's working on her,
text: trying to convince her that at the
dialog: very least she should pick up a
dialog: telephone. Not surprisingly, she
dialog: ate her food, excused herself...
dialog: (snaps fingers)
dialog: That's the last they saw her. The
dialog: reason they came to me for help, the
dialog: reason I'm coming to you, is we had
dialog: a friend of mine in the department
dialog: work up a sketch...
text: (shows the POLICE ARTIST
dialog: SKETCH he photocopied)
dialog: They want to see if I can I.D. this
dialog: girl, somehow pass along a message
dialog: to let the parents know the kid's
text: alive, doing alright.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or
speaker_heading: N.C.M.E.C.?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I figured you share information.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: We do.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: For whatever reasons I thought you
dialog: might be more receptive.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Why don't they come to me?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: This doctor and wife, they're nice
dialog: people, but they don't want to get
dialog: too involved. They're not trying to
dialog: have the parents come looking for
dialog: the girl either.
dialog: You and I both know sometimes, not
dialog: often, but sometimes there's real
dialog: reasons why a kid'll run.
dialog: Molestation, whatever. Besides
dialog: that, the girl's probably eighteen,
dialog: so she's legal.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: I'm not so sure about this.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: They're putting themselves in place
dialog: of this kid's parents and thinking
dialog: they'd want to hear their girl's
dialog: okay, even if that's all they hear.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: I can give you my card, if your
dialog: clients want to call me...
text: Welles accepts a CARD, disappointed.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: They were pretty clear they didn't
dialog: want this coming back on them.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Well, that's all I can do. Sorry.
text: Welles looks at the director, stands, hangs his head.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Who knows... maybe she's already
dialog: given her parents a call, right?
text: Welles leaves.
scene_heading: EXT. OFFICE BUILDING, MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE -- DAY
text: Welles comes out the front doors, pissed.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Fuck.
text: He tears the card in half and drops it as he heads for his
text: car. After a moment, the director comes out after him...
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Excuse me... Tom, hold on...
text: Welles looks back, walks back, glances down...
text: makes sure he stands on the torn card, hiding it underfoot.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Listen, maybe I can help after all.
dialog: Why don't you come on back in...
dialog: we'll see what we can do.
scene_heading: INT. MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY
text: Director leads Welles into this RESEARCH ROOM, a small

speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: This is it. It's not much.
dialog: (points at computers)
dialog: We've got less than five percent on
dialog: computer and we lose that funding in
dialog: December. I'll have someone show it
dialog: to you anyway. Other than that, I'm
dialog: afraid it's the wet thumb method.
text: Welles looks to the many, many file drawers.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Files are mostly by state and year
dialog: of disappearance. We try to keep
text: the children and adults separate.
dialog: No eating or smoking in here, but
text: there's a coffee machine in the hall.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Any good?
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: It's horrible, but it'll be your
dialog: best friend after a few days. I
dialog: hope you realize what kind of long
dialog: shot you're chasing after.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: You're gonna be seeing a lot of me.
dialog: You're sure you don't mind?
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: It's good what you're doing.
text: The director puts out his hand. Welles looks, shakes.
scene_heading: INT. MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE
text: ON A COMPUTER SCREEN: files open and close -- PICTURE after

scene_heading: INT. CLEVELAND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- DAY -- MONTAGE

scene_heading: INT. WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE
text: Welles has the 8MM FILM threaded through the projector. He
text: turns the CLATTERING projector on and sits, watching.
text: ON THE WALL: FLASH FRAMES, then... the skinny GIRL in a
text: negligee, sitting on the bed. The CAMERA'S SPOTLIGHT casts
text: long shadows. The girl stares, oblivious...
text: ON THE WALL: a door opens behind the girl, looks like a
text: bathroom, and the MASKED MAN enters, wearing the ghastly
text: WRESTLING MASK. The man goes to stand in front of the
text: girl. He seems to be saying something. The FILM halts.
text: Welles sits forward, hand on the projector. He's seen
text: something. He PLAYS the FILM in REVERSE...
text: ON THE WALL: the Masked Man walks backwards, away from the
text: girl, backwards into the bathroom, door shutting...
text: Welles stops the projector, not taking his eyes from the
text: image. He ADVANCES the film FRAME BY FRAME...
text: FRAME BY FRAME... as the bathroom door opens, and the Masked
text: Man enters... FRAME BY FRAME... as the Masked Man moves
text: forward... door closing behind him... STOP...
text: FREEZE FRAME: a THIRD MAN is reflected in the bathroom
text: mirror. Grainy and blurred, but he's in the room with the
text: girl, standing there, captured in the mirror in this one
text: brief instant just before the bathroom door closes.
text: Welles walks to take a closer look, studying the almost
text: ethereal image of the Third Man.

dialog: Hello, Mrs. Christian? Tom Welles.
dialog: Here's where we stand. I checked
dialog: the film stock and it's called Supra-

dialog: stock discontinued it in '92...
dialog: (listens)
dialog: Yeah, about five or six years ago.
dialog: Anyway, do what you can to dig up

scene_heading: INT. MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE
text: Welles is back at the computer, alone, drinking coffee.
text: ON THE COMPUTER: endless PHOTOS of MISSING CHILDREN.
scene_heading: The PHONE CALL CONTINUES in VOICE OVER:
speaker_heading: WELLES (V.O., cont)
dialog: Nobody really uses eight millimeter
dialog: film anymore, so we can assume there
dialog: are reasons our guys did. First,
dialog: they could develop it themselves if
dialog: they had any sort of expertise.
dialog: Obviously, this isn't the kind of
dialog: movie you can just drop off at the
dialog: one-hour photo...
scene_heading: INT. WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE
text: Welles just stands, staring at the PHOTO of the GIRL.
speaker_heading: WELLES (V.O., cont)
dialog: Second, the film that went through
dialog: the camera is what we've got.
dialog: There's no negative. Unlike video,
dialog: it wasn't meant to be duplicated.
dialog: No reason for them to risk having
dialog: more than one copy of their murder
dialog: floating around...
scene_heading: INT. CLEVELAND BAR -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE
text: Local bar. Welles sits drinking with the archive's
text: director, talking, smiling at something the director said.
speaker_heading: WELLES (V.O., cont)
dialog: There don't seen to be many
text: fingerprints on the film itself, but
dialog: I'm going to have to be careful to
dialog: leave them intact...
scene_heading: INT. MISSING PERSON ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE
text: Welles is tired, unshaven. He's moved on to the physical
text: files, at one table, looking through HUNDREDS of MISSING
text: PERSON BULLETINS. Secretaries tend to other files.
speaker_heading: WELLES (V.O., cont)
dialog: It's okay for yours and your
dialog: husbands fingerprints to be on the
dialog: film, but you'll have to use me as
dialog: a middleman if you go to the police.
dialog: That way I don't have to explain why
dialog: my prints are on it...
scene_heading: INT. WELLES' ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE
text: Welles sits with the PROJECTOR ON, watching the film again.
speaker_heading: WELLES (V.O., cont)
dialog: There were three men. Two are
text: obvious; the man in the mask and the
dialog: man running the camera, but I caught
text: a glimpse of a third man in a
dialog: mirror. It's nothing that can be
dialog: used for identification, but he was
dialog: there, watching...
text: ON THE WALL: Masked Man touches the girl's mouth, presses
text: his lips to hers. Masked Man backs away, leaving frame,
text: till the CAMERA MOVES to find Masked Man standing at a table
text: with THREE large BOWIE KNIFES laid out...
text: Welles notices something, puts the projector on FREEZE FRAME.
speaker_heading: WELLES (V.O., cont)
dialog: So, there were three. They would
dialog: have kept it small, wouldn't have
dialog: let anyone in on it they didn't have
dialog: to. That's all for now... except,
dialog: I feel I should tell you... with
dialog: this looking like it happened at
dialog: least five or six years ago...
text: Welles walks to the frozen IMAGE on the wall. It shows the
text: Masked Man's hands in frame, fingering the blades.
speaker_heading: WELLES (V.O., cont)
dialog: Well, it's not very likely we'll
dialog: ever find out who this girl was.
dialog: (listens)
dialog: I will, I'll keep trying. Goodbye.
text: V.O. PHONE CALL ends with the SOUND of the PHONE HANGING UP.
text: ON THE WALL: there's a DARK SPOT on Masked Man's hand, on
text: the arch between his index finger and thumb. Grainy and
text: hard to make out, but looks like a small TATTOO.
scene_heading: INT. WELLES ROOM, BATHROOM -- NIGHT -- END MONTAGE
text: Welles has the 8MM FILM threaded into his photo enlarger,
text: projecting the IMAGE we just saw down onto the baseboard.
text: He re-frames, CLOSER ON the masked Man's hand, REFOCUSING...
text: the black spot is a little clearer, looks like a small STAR
text: tattoo on the back of Masked Man's hand.
scene_heading: INT. MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY
text: Welles sits hunched over the card catalog, still unshaven,
text: drinking coffee, flipping through smaller PICTURES of
text: MISSING CHILDREN in one drawer, one by one by one...
text: Welles rolls his neck. He looks to see the archive's
text: director in the doorway. The director nods, leaving.
text: Welles gets back to it, stooped over the catalog.
scene_heading: FADE TO BLACK:
scene_heading: TITLE CARD: three weeks later
scene_heading: EXT. OFFICE BUILDING, MISSING PERSON ARCHIVE -- DAY
text: In the lot, Welles gets wearily from his car, smoking. He
text: tosses the cigarette, gets a Thermos off the front seat.
scene_heading: INT. MISSING PERSON ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY
text: Welles pulls out a card catalog drawer labeled "North
text: Carolina 1992," flipping through picture cards. The FACES
text: of TEENAGERS: a happy BOY with blue eyes... a red headed
text: GIRL with freckles... a ruddy faced BOY... a pretty GIRL
text: with a ribbon in her hair... a black GIRL in a pink dress...
text: a blonde haired BOY with curly hair...
text: Welles furrows his brow.
text: He backtracks to the pretty GIRL with the ribbon in her hair.
text: Welles sits straight. He reaches into his pocket, hands
text: shaking a little, takes out and unfolds the PHOTO he printed
text: of the girl from the snuff film. It's her.
text: Welles compares the two pictures. She's prettier in the
text: card catalog photo, but it's her.
text: Welles can't believe it, looks around. Secretaries at other
text: files don't even know he's there. Welles pulls out his
text: notepad, scribbling down INFORMATION off the card...
dialog: Writing the girl's name: "Mary Anne Matthews."

text: A tree-lined street of poor, boxy homes. Welles' car parks
text: in front of one HOUSE with a neglected lawn.
speaker_heading: IN THE CAR
text: Welles, clean shaven, picks a CLIPBOARD with a file folder
text: and his legal pad on it, thumbs pages. He drums his
text: fingers, opens the glove compartment, pulls out the car's
text: registration, other papers and "Jiffy-Lube" service reports,
text: uses them to pad the file.
text: Welles takes a BOTTLE of COLOGNE from his pocket. He
text: considers it, opens the bottle, applies cologne to his neck.
scene_heading: EXT. MATHEWS HOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- DAY
text: Welles knocks, clipboard in hand. A sad, middle-aged woman
text: answers, MRS. MATHEWS, looking through the screen door.
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: Yes... ?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's
dialog: Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed
dialog: investigator...
text: Welles holds up his identification only long enough for Mrs.
text: Mathews to see it looks official.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I've been hired as an independent
dialog: contractor by the U.S. Resource
dialog: Center for Missing Persons as part
dialog: of an internal audit. If you have
dialog: any time over the next few days, I'd
dialog: like to make an appointment to ask
dialog: some questions about the
dialog: disappearance of your daughter.
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: I don't understand, who are... ?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I'm sorry, let me explain, the
dialog: R.C.M.P. is a support organization
dialog: and archive, not unlike the Center
dialog: for Missing and Exploited Children
dialog: in Washington. I'm sure you've
dialog: dealt with them before?
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: Yes, but...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: These volunteer organizations are
dialog: sort of interconnected, functioning
text: hand in hand with law enforcement.
dialog: The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review
dialog: their investigations...
dialog: (holds up clipboard)
dialog: ... fact-check their records, see if
dialog: there's anything they missed,
dialog: anything they should be doing
dialog: different. I'm here for a few days,
dialog: before I head back up to Virginia.
dialog: These reports go to the Justice
dialog: Department eventually. I spoke to
dialog: your F.B.I. contact a few days ago,
dialog: uh...
text: Welles pretends to look for the name on a Jiffy Lube page...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: What was the name... ? I've got it
dialog: here somewhere...
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: Neil... Neil Cole.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (pretends he found it)
dialog: Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call
dialog: and let you know to expect me. He
dialog: didn't call?
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (looking on legal pad)
dialog: Well, I'm following up on your
dialog: daughter, Mary, height; five four,
dialog: weight; hundred ten pounds, brown
dialog: eyes, blonde hair. Born April 24,
dialog: 1976. Missing June 11th, 1992. A
dialog: runaway, that's how she's listed.
dialog: Is this information correct... ?
text: Mrs. Mathews stares, nods.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I'm sorry, I know this isn't easy.
dialog: Is there a more convenient time... ?
dialog: (looks at watch)
dialog: Can I buy you lunch, would that be
dialog: alright?
text: Mrs. Mathews looks him up and down.
scene_heading: EXT. DAIRY QUEEN RESTAURANT -- DAY
text: Welles and Mrs. Mathews eat at a PICNIC TABLE on the patio.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: It's very important you don't let
dialog: this raise your expectations. It's
dialog: not going to effect any ongoing
dialog: efforts. All I'm saying is, please
dialog: know, I'm not here to create any
dialog: false hope.
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: They hired you. You're like, a
dialog: private detective?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: That's exactly what I am.
text: Mrs. Mathews chews, staring off into the distance.
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: I didn't think there were private
text: detectives anymore, except on TV.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: You probably expect me to be wearing
text: a trench coat and a hat. Drinking
dialog: whiskey, chasing women and getting
text: beaten up by guys with broken noses.
dialog: Want to know what it's really like?
text: It's sitting in a car and staring at
dialog: a hotel window for three days
text: straight, pissing in a plastic
dialog: bottle, pardon me, because some guy
text: thinks his wife's cheating on him.
dialog: Glamorous, huh? And the guy who
dialog: hired you, he has a hair-lip,
dialog: dandruff and crooked teeth, and you
dialog: could have told him the minute you
dialog: laid eyes on him his wife's
dialog: cheating, and you don't blame her.
text: Mrs. Mathews smiles.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: It's refreshing to actually sit down
dialog: and meet someone face to face,
dialog: someone nice like you.
text: Welles smiles. Mrs. Mathews takes out a cigarette. Welles
text: lights her, joins her in smoking, refers to his clipboard.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: So, she didn't leave a note? She
dialog: never gave any indication where she
dialog: might go, before she left?
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: She just seemed... depressed... ?
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: She didn't seem herself. For months
dialog: there never was any way to get her
dialog: to talk about it. One night we went
dialog: to bed... the next morning she was
text: gone. She took some clothes.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: What was she running from?
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: If there's anything you feel
dialog: uncomfortable talking about, tell
dialog: me, but I have to ask. Your
dialog: husband... he committed suicide?
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: September 4th, 1993. About a year
dialog: after Mary disappeared.
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: We were divorced by then. Things
dialog: fell apart... he was living with a
dialog: friend...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Why do you think he did it?
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: It got to be too much for him.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: You have to forgive me, but in these
dialog: circumstances... with your
dialog: daughter...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Were there any indications of... any
dialog: sort of abuse?
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: There wasn't anything like that.
dialog: The police and the FBI people asked,
dialog: but there wasn't anything happened
dialog: like that, never. My husband... his
dialog: heart broke when Mary left...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I didn't mean to...
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: You try going through what we did.
dialog: Bob couldn't take it, that's all.
dialog: Christ, there's times when it still
dialog: seems like I can't either.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I had to ask. I apologize.
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: No one knows what it's like. You
dialog: can't even imagine how much it hurts.
text: Welles is miserable. A few CUSTOMERS walk past, looking at
text: Mrs. Mathews. She tries not to notice then noticing.
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: People remember me from the news.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Can you drive me back now?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Of course.
scene_heading: INT. MATHEWS HOUSE, MARY'S ROOM -- DAY
text: Mrs. Mathews enters. Welles follows.
text: This was the girl's room, exactly as she left it -- POSTERS
text: of ACTORS on the wall, many STUFFED ANIMALS on the pink
text: sheets of the carefully made bed. Perfectly preserved.
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: This is her room.
text: Welles looks around, uncomfortable.
text: Shelves have PICTURES of MARY with female friends, a
text: collection of CERAMIC FIGURINES of CLOWNS and ANIMALS.
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
text: The police made a wreck of it, but
dialog: I put it back exactly how it was.
dialog: Just how she likes it.
text: Welles takes a few steps into the room, looks down at a DESK
text: where there are SIX brightly wrapped GIFTS.
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: Those are for her birthday. One for
dialog: every year she's missed. They'll be
text: waiting for her when she comes back.
text: Welles is nearly overwhelmed by sadness, struggling to hide
text: it. He backs to the door, looks at his watch...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I... I shouldn't take anymore of
dialog: your time. Maybe we can finish
dialog: tomorrow. I'll call tomorrow...
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: Okay.
scene_heading: EXT. MATHEWS HOUSE -- DAY
text: Welles escapes to his car, climbing in. He starts it up...
speaker_heading: IN THE CAR
text: Welles drives, tears welling up in his eyes. He has to pull
text: over and park, wiping his tears, fighting for composure.
scene_heading: INT. WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Welles has unpacked. He's on the bed, on his CELLULAR...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: You should be able to take a shower
dialog: and still have hot water left, honey.
dialog: (listens)
dialog: Call him back and tell him I said
dialog: so. The goddamn thing's still under
dialog: warranty.
dialog: (listens)
dialog: I'm okay. It's hard here. It's
dialog: hard.
dialog: (listens)
dialog: I've got a lead I have to follow
dialog: through. To be honest, I don't
dialog: think I'm going to get very far.
dialog: I miss you. I love you.
scene_heading: INT. MATHEWS HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MORNING
text: Welles sits at the kitchen table. Mrs. Mathews makes
text: coffee. The home's decor is cheap and flowery.
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: We weren't religious. We never
dialog: forced religion down her throat,
dialog: like I've seen some parents do to
dialog: their kids. We never made her go to
dialog: church. But, after Mary was gone,
dialog: that's when I got religious.
text: Mrs. Mathews brings two cups of coffee, sits.
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: Doesn't make much sense, does it?
dialog: When everything's happy, when life's
dialog: fine and you have every reason to
dialog: believe there's a God, you don't
dialog: bother. Then, something horrible
dialog: happens... that's when you start
dialog: praying all the time. That's when
dialog: you start going to church.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: We're all like that.
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: Are you religious?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: You should be.
text: Mrs. Mathews drinks coffee, stares into the cup.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I've got what I need for my report.
dialog: There is... there is one thing that
dialog: bothers me though.
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: It's not really my place, but it's
dialog: not easy for me to set aside the
dialog: private detective part of me either.
dialog: See, I know a little about missing
dialog: persons. When kids run, they almost
dialog: always leave a note. It's guilt.
dialog: They want to say goodbye.
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
text: There wasn't one. The police looked.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Do you think the police did a good
dialog: job?
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: I don't know. I think so.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: It is possible... and I know this
dialog: isn't something you want to hear.
dialog: Your daughter may have tried to hide
dialog: a note where she thought you would
dialog: eventually find it, but where she
dialog: knew your husband would never find
dialog: it. She might have wanted to tell
dialog: you something...
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: No. You don't have any reason to
dialog: think that...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: If the police focused their search
text: in her room, her belongings, well
dialog: that'd be only natural, but they may
dialog: have been looking in the wrong place.
text: Mrs. Mathews is getting upset.
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: How... how can you say that to me...?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Will you let me look?
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: My husband never laid a hand on her.
dialog: She would have told me... she would
dialog: have told me...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: You're probably right, and I
dialog: probably won't find anything.
dialog: I don't have a right to ask this,
dialog: and you can kick me out of your
dialog: house if you want, but this is my
dialog: profession and there's a part of me
dialog: that can't let it go. Police are
dialog: just as human as you or I. They
dialog: could have missed something. They
dialog: probably didn't.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Wouldn't you rather know?
text: Mrs. Mathews thinks about it, tortured, shakes her head sadly.
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: Go ahead and look if you want. I
dialog: don't care what you do.
text: Mrs. Mathews gets up and walks out of the room.
scene_heading: INT. MATHEWS HOUSE -- SEARCH MONTAGE -- DAY
text: -In MRS. MATHEWS' BEDROOM, Welles looks through DRESSER
text: drawers, methodically, replacing everything as it was...

text: BOOKS off SHELVES, fanning the pages, shaking them out...
text: -In a BATHROOM, Welles examines the contents of a MEDICINE
text: CABINET, examining old prescription bottles... opens
text: CABINETS under the sink...
text: -In the LIVING ROOM, Mrs. Mathews sits slumped in a chair,
text: staring at a soap opera on TELEVISION, a BOTTLE of scotch

text: -In the KITCHEN, Welles stands on a chair, searches high
text: CABINETS... looks through low CABINETS, on his knees, pulls
text: out pots and pans... fans the pages of COOK BOOKS...
text: -Welles stands in the doorway of MARY'S ROOM, just stares.
text: He takes a few steps back into the HALLWAY, looks up at the
text: ceiling. There's an ATTIC DOOR there. Welles reaches to
text: the door's handle, opens it, unfolds the portable stairs...
text: -In the small ATTIC, Welles uses a penlight FLASHLIGHT,
text: crouched under the low ceiling, looking through dusty BOXES
text: of PHOTOGRAPHS; old photos of a wedding, of grandparents...
text: Welles moves to pull back dusty sheets, finds a large
text: WICKER BASKET and broken BICYCLE underneath...
text: Welles opens the basket, takes out BLANKETS and QUILTS
text: in mothballs. He finds a wide VELVET BOX, takes it out,
text: opens its hinged lid to reveal a set of good SILVERWARE.
text: He touches the tarnished silverware, lifts out the top tray.
text: Underneath, resting on top of more silverware, is a DIARY.
text: Welles opens the DIARY, finds written: "Mary Anne Mathews."
text: Welles turns pages. The DIARY'S about half-full of
text: feminine, cursive handwriting. After the last written
text: page, a PAGE has been TORN OUT. Welles fingers the ragged
text: edge, flips through the blank pages till he comes to the
text: very last page, a GOODBYE NOTE. Welles sits and reads...
speaker_heading: MARY'S VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: (emotionless monotone)
dialog: "Dear mom. If you're reading this,
dialog: it means I called you from
dialog: Hollywood, California and told you
dialog: where to find my diary. I don't
dialog: think I'll be able to tell you this
dialog: when I talk to you, so I'm writing
dialog: it down here. You know I haven't
dialog: been happy for a long, long time.
dialog: For a long time now dad's been doing
dialog: things I couldn't tell you. He's
dialog: been touching me and it's getting
dialog: worse. I can't stay anymore. I
dialog: know you and I haven't always gotten
dialog: along sometimes, but please don't
dialog: blame yourself. There isn't
dialog: anything you can do. I'm going to
dialog: make a whole new life in California.
dialog: Maybe someday you'll see me on TV or

text: She's numb from her drink, watching a GAME SHOW, smoking.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Do you ever consider... do you
dialog: realize that Mary may never come
dialog: back?
text: Mrs. Mathews looks to Welles, looks back at the TV.
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: I think about it everyday. But,
dialog: every time the phone rings... every
dialog: single time, I still think it's her.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: It's been six years.
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: What am I supposed to do? Forget
dialog: her? Time heals all wounds, right?
dialog: (misery building)
dialog: She's all I think about, and I've
dialog: learned to live with that. But, you
dialog: want the truth... the real truth?
dialog: If I had a choice... if I had to
dialog: choose, between her being out there,
dialog: living a good life and being happy,
dialog: and me not knowing; never finding
dialog: out what happened to her...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: ... or her being dead and me
dialog: knowing...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'd choose to know.
text: Mrs. Mathews stares into the TV, wipes tears.

text: CUSTOMERS, again all wary males, follow proper porn-shop
dialog: etiquette; look at the porn, not your fellow shopper.
text: There are "PEEP SHOW" booths in the back. A MAN looks

text: Behind the register, Max takes a look to make sure the other
text: clerk is busy, takes the cap of his Highlighter pen and
text: highlights a section in the book he's reading.
text: Welles notes this. He goes to the substantial MAGAZINE
text: RACK, picks up a porn tabloid, pages through it. He selects
text: sex MAGAZINES and NEWSPAPERS, choosing about twenty-five.
text: Welles takes this pile up to Max, gets out his wallet. Max

dialog: don't have one.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I'll risk it.
text: Max shoves everything into a bag and hands it over.
speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: What are you reading?
text: Max holds up the book, "ANAL SECRETARY."
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Once you pick it up you can't put it
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Catchy title. What are you really
dialog: reading?
dialog: (off Max's look)
dialog: Hard to believe that book's got any
dialog: parts worth highlighting.
text: Max takes a glance at the other clerk, opens the pages of

speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Truman Capote.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I tear off the cover and paste this

dialog: You know how it is.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself
dialog: in front of your fellow perverts.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (smiles, shrugs)
dialog: Might get drummed out of the

dialog: would I be?

speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: What's your name, if you don't mind
dialog: me asking?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Max.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Well, here's the deal, Max. This
dialog: thing I'm on right now has something
dialog: to do with underground pornography.
dialog: Stuff that's sold under the counter,
dialog: illegally...
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: There's not much illegal.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Well, whatever there is, whoever's
dialog: dealing, however it's done, I want
dialog: to know. I want a good look, so if
dialog: you've got that kind of connection,
dialog: great. If not, speak now.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You're not a cop, are you? If I ask
dialog: and you are, you have to tell me.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I'm not a cop.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You're a private eye. Like Shaft.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Not quite.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: From Pennsylvania. P.I. from PA.
dialog: What are you doing out here?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Well, there's the thing; you're not
dialog: gonna know anything about what I'm
dialog: doing, but you can make some money.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: How much?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: How much do you make now?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Four hundred a week, off the books.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Okay, let's pretend I live in the
dialog: same fantasy world where you make
dialog: four hundred a week in that dump.
dialog: I'll give you six hundred for a few
dialog: days.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Sounds good, pops.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Here's my number if you need it...
dialog: (writes on scrap paper)
dialog: When can you start?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: See you then. Oh, and, don't call

text: Welles walks away.
scene_heading: INT. WELLES ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Welles sleeps, despite the stead SOUND of TRAFFIC racing by
text: his window. The PHONE RINGS, waking him. Welles looks at
text: the clock radio, 2:23am, reaches to answer the phone...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: ... Hello... ?
speaker_heading: MAX (V.O.)
dialog: (from phone)
dialog: Wake up, pops. Your education
text: begins tonight.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN -- NIGHT
text: Against the backdrop of downtown LA's bright skyscrapers,
text: Welles' rental car heads into the lower bowels of the city,
text: smaller, older, darker buildings...
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN STREETS -- NIGHT
text: The only people on the street are HOMELESS and SHADY
text: CHARACTERS. Welles' car makes its way to a big deserted
text: PARKING LOT. There are a few cars parked in one corner.
text: Welles parks near the other cars and gets out. Max stands
text: against a chain link fence. Welles goes to meet him.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Come on.
text: Max leads the way, across the lot, towards dark alleyways.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT
text: Max and Welles move through this filth strewn alley between
text: decaying brink buildings. They cone to a STAIRWELL leading
text: down to pitch dark...
scene_heading: INT. OLD BUILDING -- NIGHT
text: Max enters through a crooked door, heads into a narrow,
text: labyrinth hallway lit by bare bulbs. Welles follows.
text: They come to another STAIRWAY leading down. At the bottom,
text: a thick-necked GOON stands guarding double doors.
speaker_heading: GOON
dialog: Are you a law enforcement agent or
dialog: in any way affiliated with law
dialog: enforcement?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Fuck you, Larry.
text: Max heads to the double doors, waits for Welles.
speaker_heading: GOON
dialog: (to Welles)
dialog: Are you a law enforcement... ?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: No.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT
text: Max and Welles enter through the double doors, into a kind
text: of small, underground porn flea market. It's incredibly
text: quiet. About fifteen CARD TABLES are set up in rows. The
text: MEN behind the tables and the thirty or so "CUSTOMERS"
dialog: looking through the merchandise make those in the previous
text: porn shops look like high society.
text: These are MIDDLE-AGED MEN, most balding, some with pot
text: bellies, in shorts and tube socks, in sweatpants and Members
text: Only jackets: plain men, but with a look of desperation in
text: their eyes, glancing around nervously, greasy and afraid.
speaker_heading: ONE DEALER
dialog: We're shutting down in fifteen
text: minutes. Fifteen minutes.
text: Welles makes his way to the tables, wary. One table is
text: covered in dirty cardboard boxes, filled with HUNDREDS of
text: PHOTOS of young children, mostly boys, naked. Each photo is
text: wrapped in plastic, censored by masking tape.
text: Welles swallows back disgust.
text: The next table is piled high with used pornographic
text: MAGAZINES. There are baggies with COLORFUL PILLS laid out.
text: X-rated Polaroids wrapped in rubberbands.
text: Max follows behind, unaffected, smokes a cigarette.
text: Another table offers VIDEO TAPES with no identifying marks
text: other than hand written labels with numbers written out,
dialog: "two," "sixteen," "five." And many bootleg VIDEOS with
text: grainy, homemade labels showing WOMEN in extreme BONDAGE.
text: Welles watches out the corner of his eye as the PLUMP MAN
text: beside him pays for a thick stack of kiddie porn pictures.
text: Welles waits till the man moves on, addresses the angry
text: looking DEALER who's counting money.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (points to numbered videos)
dialog: What are these?
speaker_heading: ANGRY DEALER
text: Mixed hard bondage. Rape films.
dialog: Sick shit. Buy five, get one free.
text: Welles looks around, wipes sweat off his top lip.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Anything harder?
speaker_heading: ANGRY DEALER
dialog: There's nothing harder.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Snuff?
speaker_heading: ANGRY DEALER
dialog: What you see is what I got, mister.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: You know where I can get it? I have
dialog: a lot of money to spend.
speaker_heading: ANGRY DEALER
dialog: There ain't no such thing as snuff.
dialog: Why don't you fuck off?
text: The dealer sits and keeps counting cash.
text: Welles moves on Beyond the tables there's a CURTAINED
text: DOORWAY. Welles walks to it, enters...
scene_heading: INSIDE THE CURTAIN
text: Folding chairs face a SCREEN. A PROJECTOR shows a silent
text: movie; a BUXOM WOMAN in nurses uniform prepares an enema bag
text: and tube. A hairy, overweight MAN lays face down on an
text: examination table, naked, arms tied behind his back.
text: In the darkness, a MAN shifts in his chair, grunting,
text: obviously masturbating. A few chairs away, a man is bent
text: over, moving his head in the lap of SOMEONE in a BLONDE WIG.
text: A LARGE MAN approaches Welles from the dark.
speaker_heading: LARGE MAN
dialog: You have to pay to come in here.
text: Welles backs away, shuts the curtain.
scene_heading: INT. ALL-NIGHT COFFEE SHOP -- NIGHT
text: Not many people in the place. Welles drinks coffee. Max
text: eats a huge breakfast.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You've got Penthouse, Playboy,
dialog: Hustler, etc. Nobody even considers
dialog: them pornography anymore. Then,
dialog: there's mainstream hardcore. Triple
dialog: X. The difference is penetration.
dialog: That's hardcore. That whole
dialog: industry's up in the valley.
dialog: Writers, directors, porn stars.
dialog: They're celebrities, or they think
dialog: they are. They pump out 150 videos
dialog: a week. A week. They've even got
dialog: a porno Academy Awards. America
dialog: loves pornography. Anybody tells
dialog: you they never use pornography,
dialog: they're lying. Somebody's buying
dialog: those videos. Somebody's out there
dialog: spending 900 million dollars a year
dialog: on phone sex. Know what else? It's
dialog: only gonna get worse. More and more
dialog: you'll see perverse hardcore coming
dialog: into the mainstream, because that's
dialog: evolution. Desensitization. Oh my
dialog: God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his
dialog: hips, how offensive! Nowadays,
text: Mtv's showing girls dancing around
text: in thong bikinis with their asses
dialog: hanging out. Know what I mean? For
dialog: the porn-addict, big tits aren't big
dialog: enough after a while. They have to
dialog: be the biggest tits ever. Some porn
text: chicks are putting in breast
dialog: implants bigger than your head,
dialog: literally. Soon, Playboy is gonna be
dialog: Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler,
dialog: Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore
dialog: films'll be medical films.
dialog: People'll be jerking off to women
text: laying around with open wounds.
text: There's nowhere else for it to go.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Interesting theory.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What you saw tonight, we're not
dialog: talking about a video some dentist
dialog: takes home over the weekend. We're
dialog: talking about stuff where people get
dialog: hurt. Specialty product.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Child pornography.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: There's two kinds of specialty
dialog: product; legal and illegal. Foot
dialog: fetish, shit films, watersports,
dialog: bondage, spanking, fisting, she-
dialog: males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond
dialog: hardcore, but legal. This is the
dialog: kind of hardcore where one guy's
text: going to look at it and throw up,
text: another guy looks at it and falls in
dialog: love. Now, with some of the S+M and
text: bondage films, they straddle the
dialog: line. How are you supposed to tell
dialog: if the person tied up with the ball
text: gag in their mouth is a consenting
dialog: or not? Step over that line, you're
dialog: into kiddie porn. Rape films, but
dialog: there aren't many. I've never seen
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Snuff films.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I heard you asking. That guy wasn't
dialog: yanking you around. There's no such
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: What other ways are there to get
dialog: illegal films? Who do you see?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: First of all, basement sales like
dialog: tonight aren't gonna last much
dialog: longer. It's too risky, one, and
dialog: two, everything's going on the
dialog: internet. Anyone with a computer
dialog: and enough patience can find
dialog: anything he wants. It's heaven for
dialog: those degenerate chicken-hawks.
dialog: They're swapping pictures back and
dialog: forth as fast as their modems can
dialog: zap 'em. But, there's still some
dialog: weird shit under the counter where
dialog: I work sometimes. No one knows where
dialog: it comes from. That's local
dialog: underground, where information
dialog: spreads by word of mouth. Those are
dialog: zombies, hardcore junkies. Their
text: hands are permanently pruned. They
dialog: go out in the sun they don't burn,
dialog: they blister. Other than that, all
dialog: I know about is the mail.
text: Classified ads in the paper with
text: hidden codes. Secret couriers.
dialog: Credit card orders to dummy
dialog: corporations. Interstate wire
text: transfers. Revolving P.O. boxes.
dialog: But, if you're asking me who do you
dialog: go to to get illegal shit... who
dialog: knows? That's the whole point --
text: the seller stays as far away from
dialog: the buyer as possible, and vice
dialog: versa, and cops can't trace the
dialog: deal. There's ways to do it so
dialog: nobody knows who anybody is.
text: Welles watches Max eat.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: How old are you?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Twenty-five.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Where are your parents?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I don't know, where are yours?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I don't mean any offense... but what
dialog: are you doing mixed up in all this?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I'm not mixed up in anything,
dialog: hayseed. What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: You just strike me as smart enough
dialog: to be doing something else.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah, I'm a real genius. What
dialog: choices have I got? Fuck, just
dialog: because I know about stuff like
dialog: tonight doesn't mean I deal it. I
dialog: work a job. It beats pumping gas,
dialog: beats making hamburgers.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: You're telling me it doesn't get to
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You can't sit there all day watching
dialog: the parade of losers that comes into
dialog: that place without going numb. So
dialog: what?
dialog: Am I gonna go off and be a race car
dialog: driver? Go to Harvard? Run for
dialog: President? What about you, pops?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: What about me?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I see a ring on your finger. You
dialog: have any kids?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: A daughter.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: So, you have a wife and kid waiting
dialog: for you in Pennsylvania... what are
dialog: you doing mixed up in all this?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Good question.
scene_heading: EXT. ALL NIGHT COFFEE SHOP -- NIGHT
text: Max and Welles comes out to the sidewalk, talking.
text: ACROSS THE STREET
text: INSIDE A PARKED CAR, through the windshield, SOMEONE watches
text: Max and Welles say goodnight. Max walks to a waiting taxi.
text: It's the sinister lawyer watching, LONGDALE, the late Mr.
text: Christian's attorney, watching Welles go to his rental car.
scene_heading: INT. WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE
text: Welles is seated, PROJECTOR RUNNING, watching the 8MM film.
text: The last of the film makes its way through, threading out.
text: The take-up reel spins, the film's tail flapping...
text: Welles stares at the blank white square of light projected
text: onto the wall. CELLULAR PHONE is HEARD RINGING...
text: Welles finally looks to the projector, turns it off. The
text: PHONE'S RINGING. Welles goes to sit on the bed, looking at
text: the cellular phone on the bedside table. RINGING...
text: Welles lets it RING. RINGING... RINGING... till it finally
text: stops. Welles lays back on the bed and shuts his eyes.
scene_heading: INT. CHRISTIAN HOUSE, MR CHRISTIAN'S OFFICE -- DAY
text: Mrs. Christian is behind the desk, surrounded by BOXES of

speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN

dialog: My husband had five cash accounts he

scene_heading: INT. MR CHRISTIAN'S OFFICE -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN

scene_heading: INT. PHONE BOOTH -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: WELLES

dialog: You're joking.
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
dialog: (from phone)
dialog: To the penny. Exactly one million

speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
dialog: Hello... ?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I'm here.
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
dialog: Do you think the film could have
dialog: cost that much?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: For a human life... murder on film,
dialog: no statute of limitations. Who
dialog: knows? It sure could have. I'd
dialog: like you to overnight me a copy of
dialog: those checks, then put them in a
dialog: safe deposit box.
speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Send it to me through the post
dialog: office like we arranged. No return
dialog: address. You dug this up all by

speaker_heading: MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)

scene_heading: EXT. MISSION YOUTH HOSTEL -- DAY

text: Welles stands with an elderly, black NUN in plain clothing.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Her name was Mary Anne Mathews.
text: Welles hands the woman the PICTURE of MARY. The woman puts

speaker_heading: NUN

speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: You... you do? You're sure?
dialog: Please, Sister, will you take

dialog: Yes. I remember her.
scene_heading: INT. MISSION YOUTH HOSTEL, STORAGE AREA -- DAY
text: In a basement corner, Welles watches as the nun uses keys to
text: open the door of a chain-link STORAGE CAGE. The cage is
text: full of junk, BOXES, LAMPS, stacks of CHAIRS.
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: She lived here for only about a
dialog: month, if I recall correctly. She
dialog: didn't return one night. She never
dialog: came back. I didn't know what to
dialog: think...
text: The nun enters the cage, pushes old BOXES out of her way,
text: looks up a cob-web covered METAL SHELVES.
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: Do you know what happened to her?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I'm trying to find out. She was a

speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: (pointing on shelf)
dialog: Can you get that down for me?
text: Welles climbs the ladder, points at boxes...
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: No, the next shelf... there...

text: He climbs down the ladder with it.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: Those are her belongings.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Her belongings?
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: That's her suitcase. I had

speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Whatever possessed you to keep this
dialog: all this time?
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: She was the kindest, sweetest girl
dialog: you'd ever want to meet. Oh, I
dialog: adored her. I supposed I always
dialog: hoped she'd be back. After a time,
dialog: all I could do was pray she had
dialog: moved on to better things. Can you

dialog: you think it's appropriate?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I'll do what I can.
scene_heading: INT. WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Welles puts Mary's SUITCASE on the bed, opens it. He takes

text: examines them, frowning, puts them aside.
text: He takes out yellowed NEWSPAPER; Help Wanted CLASSIFIEDS,
dialog: "July 2, 1992." Several job possibilities circled, others
text: crossed out. He finds baggie containing a few old JOINTS.
text: All that's left are more items of CLOTHING, a TOOTHBRUSH and
text: an ADDRESS BOOK. Welles examines the address book, finds a
text: folded piece of paper in the blank pages, unfolds it... it's
text: the TORN DIARY PAGE, a POEM written in Mary's hand...
speaker_heading: MARY'S VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: (as Welles reads)
dialog: "Star light, star bright, First star
dialog: I've seen tonight, Wish I may, wish
dialog: I might, Have this wish I wish
dialog: tonight."
text: Welles goes to a drawer, takes out the photocopy of Mary's
text: DIARY. He turns to the ragged edge of the torn page, puts

text: Welles stands looking at the poem. He turns the page over,
dialog: finds written, in cursive:
dialog: Models Wanted 213-555-6643
scene_heading: EXT. PHONE BOOTH -- DAY

scene_heading: EXT. WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY

scene_heading: INT. ADJACENT OFFICE, 9TH FLOOR -- DAY

scene_heading: INT. ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY
text: WELLES' P.O.V., THROUGH BINOCULARS: watching the window of

text: Welles rises. He looks to the wall where THREE PHOTOGRAPHS
text: culled from the snuff film are pinned up; the picture of

scene_heading: INT. WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, 8TH FLOOR HALL -- NIGHT
text: Welles comes quietly out from the stairwell, wears gloves.
text: He moves down the hall to the door of "Celebrity Films Inc."
text: He kneels, begins using LOCK-PICKING TOOLS on the door.
scene_heading: INT. CELEBRITY FILMS OFFICE -- NIGHT
text: Welles enters, shuts the door and locks it. He takes out
text: his penlight. There are POSTERS for cheap PORN FILMS on the
text: wall that we couldn't see through binoculars. Titles like
text: "Sex Doctor," "Deep Ass," and "Penal Colony."
text: There a two FILE CABINETS. Welles pulls a few drawers,
text: finds them locked. VIDEO CASSETTES are everywhere, on the
text: cabinets, on shelves, piled high on the floor.
text: Welles goes to Eddie's desk, looking in drawers. One drawer
text: is full of X-RATED MAGAZINES. Another's stuffed with
dialog: paperwork, call sheets, contracts.
text: Welles picks up Eddie's phone, unscrews the earpiece. He
text: takes the small, round LISTENING DEVICE from his pocket,
text: peels off backing to expose adhesive. He attaches the
text: listening device inside the phone, puts it back together.
text: Welles moves towards the door, sweeps the room with the
text: penlight. He stops at the file cabinets, takes his lock-
text: picking tools out, begins working on one file's lock.
text: He turns the lock, opens a file drawer. Empty. He opens
text: another. Inside: piles of CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.
text: Welles clenches his jaw.

speaker_heading: EDDIE (V.O.)
dialog: Maybe there's something wrong with
dialog: the scumbag customers coming into
dialog: your place, ever think of that?
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: The only thing wrong is the cheap,

speaker_heading: EDDIE (V.O.)

speaker_heading: EDDIE (V.O.)
dialog: Fuck you!
text: THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie slams down the phone. He CANNOT
text: BE HEARD any longer. He's cursing, shuffling paperwork.
text: Welles takes off headphones, picks up his cellular phone.
text: He drinks soda, opens the phone, dials, nervous, then looks
text: back through the binoculars. He waits, clears his throat.
text: The PHONE'S RINGING... RINGING...
text: On the floor, the REELS of the tape recorder are TURNING...
text: THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie answers the phone...
speaker_heading: EDDIE (V.O.)

speaker_heading: WELLES (V.O.)
dialog: You killed that girl and you put it
dialog: on film. You and your pals, you're
dialog: fucked. You fucked up real good.
text: Welles hits disconnect, still looking through binoculars.
text: THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie's slow to hang up the phone. He
text: stands, looking down at the phone, frozen. Finally, he runs
text: his hands through his hair, looks around the room, sits back
text: down. He gets out his bottle and pours himself a drink.
text: Welles watches through binoculars, puts headphones back on.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Come on, Eddie...
text: THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie sits motionless.
speaker_heading: WELLES (O.S.)

speaker_heading: EDDIE (V.O.)

dialog: ago, some motherfucker called...
dialog: says he knows about the loop.
speaker_heading: DINO (V.O.)

speaker_heading: EDDIE (V.O.)

speaker_heading: DINO (V.O.)
dialog: Bullshit.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (V.O.)
dialog: I'm telling you...
speaker_heading: DINO (V.O.)
dialog: Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's
dialog: impossible. Why are you bothering
dialog: me with this... ?
speaker_heading: EDDIE (V.O.)
dialog: Because somebody just fucking called
dialog: me and fucking laid it out!
speaker_heading: DINO (V.O.)
dialog: There's nothing there, you brain-
dialog: dead cunt. Think about it. There's
dialog: absolutely no way in this world to
dialog: connect us to anything. I want you
dialog: to hang the phone up, and if you
dialog: call me about this again I'm going
dialog: to send a friend of mine out there
dialog: and have him crack you open with a

speaker_heading: EDDIE (V.O.)
dialog: Dino...
speaker_heading: DINO (V.O)
dialog: Nobody knows anything.
text: THROUGH BINOCULARS: as DINO is HEARD HANGING UP, Eddie
text: reacts, picks up his phone and throws it across the office.
text: Welles sits back, trying to accept the realization that he's
text: found them. He looks to the PHOTO of the Third Man.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: That is you, isn't it, Eddie?
text: Welles goes to the RECORDER, turns on the TONE DECODER. Its

speaker_heading: WELLES VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: (from recorder)
dialog: ... and your pals, you're fucked...
text: Hits FAST FORWARD... hits PLAY, watching the TONE DECODER.
text: From the RECORDER, the SOUND of EDDIE DIALING a NUMBER on
text: his touch tone phone... and as EACH TONE is HEARD, a
text: corresponding NUMBER appears on the DECODER'S LED readout:
dialog: ...1 212 555 9906...
text: The recorder continues, REPLAYING the CONVERSATION between

text: down on a table: "Haines Criss-Cross Directory."
text: Welles sits, takes out his notepad, referring to the phone
text: number written: "(212) 555-9906." He opens the reference
dialog: book, searching pages...
text: Thousands of TELEPHONE NUMBERS are LISTED in SEQUENCE, each
text: with an address. Welles runs his finger down the page.
scene_heading: EXT. SOHO STREETS -- DAY
text: PEDESTRIANS everywhere. Streets are clogged with DELIVERY
text: TRUCKS loading and unloading. Cars horns blow. Welles
text: walks to an old, WAREHOUSE BUILDING shoulder to shoulder
text: with other buildings, labeled "1204" in burnished steel.
text: Welles climbs the stairs, examines the buzzers.
text: The top button's labeled "Greystone Imports," the bottom
text: button reads "Lang Interior Design, by appt." The middle
text: button is labeled only by a drawing of a BLACK WIDOW SPIDER.
text: Welles looks up at the building.
scene_heading: EXT. 1204 WAREHOUSE, SOHO -- LATER DAY
text: The sun is low. Less activity on the street. Welles leans
text: against a car down the street, smoking a cigarette.
text: TWO WOMEN walk this way, both in spiked high heels, dressed
text: in cheap, short, formfitting skirts, both carrying duffel
text: bags. They start up the stairs of 1204...
text: Welles throws his cigarette, walks to follow.
text: The women hit the center button. A BUZZER sounds as they
text: head inside. Welles hurries up the stairs, catching the
text: door before it closes.
scene_heading: INT. 1204 WAREHOUSE, ELEVATOR -- DAY
text: Welles follows the women into a decrepit ELEVATOR. One
text: woman hits "2." Welles hits "3," steps back in the corner.
text: Elevator doors creak closed. The two women are heavily made
text: up, pretty, but worn, eyes dull.
text: Welles looks down at the leg of one woman, noticing bruises
text: through her fishnet stockings, poorly covered by make-up.
text: Elevator doors open on the SECOND FLOOR. The two women get
text: out and walk down a grey hallway, towards DOUBLE DOORS
text: painted black. Welles stops the elevator door from closing.
text: The women push the INTERCOM at the black doors. Another
text: dull BUZZ is HEARD as the women enter. The low rumble of
text: HEAVY METAL MUSIC is HEARD, SILENCED as doors swing shut.
text: Welles lets the elevator close.
scene_heading: EXT. 1204 WAREHOUSE -- DAY
text: The elevator opens on the FIRST FLOOR. Welles gets out,
text: instead of leaving the way he came, heads towards the
text: rear... FOLLOW him down a hallway, past a SERVICE ELEVATOR...
scene_heading: EXT. 1204 WAREHOUSE -- DAY
text: Welles comes out BACK DOORS into an sunless alleyway with
text: fire escapes above. There's a TRASH DUMPSTER, overflowing.
text: Rats scatter upon Welles, arrival.
text: Welles looks to make sure he's alone. He starts tearing
text: open GARBAGE BAGS. Flies swarm. One bag's filled with
text: empty food containers and old newspapers.
text: Welles tears open another bag, finds burnt out FLORESCENT
text: LIGHTBULBS, digs out a handful of empty PHOTO PAPER
text: PACKAGES, bottles of DEVELOPING CHEMICALS. He pulls out a
dialog: few MAGAZINES; Time, Newsweek, etc...
text: The magazines are cut up, falling apart, with pictures
text: chopped out from many pages. Welles examines ADDRESS LABELS:

scene_heading: INT. MOTEL, MAX'S ROOM -- NIGHT

speaker_heading: WELLES

dialog: got for me?
text: Max opens his suitcase, takes out THREE VIDEO TAPES.
text: He hands them to Welles. The boxes are covered in jumbled
text: PHOTO COLLAGES: American flag, S+M men and women, a skull,
text: mannequins, a scorpion, cut-outs of arms, legs and eyeballs.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Dino Velvet.
scene_heading: INT. WELLES' MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Welles is lit by the flicker from the TELEVISION SCREEN. WE
text: SEE NOTHING. We HEAR the rhythmic MUFFLED MOANS of a WOMAN
text: from the TV, can't tell if it's pleasure or pain.
text: Max is asleep in the bed, PIZZA BOX near his feet.
text: Welles drinks beer, gets up and ejects the CASSETTE from a
text: VCR, tosses it aside, tired. He picks another Dino Velvet
text: TAPE, puts it in, sits.
text: ON TV: GOTHIC ROCK is HEARD over old, scratchy IMAGES: of
text: Klansmen around a burning cross... Dracula menacing a
text: sleeping woman... a man in a Devil costume dancing...
text: Welles opens another beer.
text: ON TV: a WOMAN is tied up, arms in the air, hanging from the
text: ceiling, gagged and blindfolded, in a dungeon lit by
text: candelabras. Then, glimpsed IMAGES: worms writhing in
text: slime... gargoyles... a guillotine falling. Then, the bound
text: woman, struggling. A MASKED MAN in a leather jacket enters.
text: He wears a LEATHER MASK with zipper eyes and mouth...
text: This focuses Welles' attention.
text: ON TV: the Masked Man circles the captured woman...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Max... wake up...

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Wha... ?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (points at TV)
dialog: Who is this, in the mask? Who is he?
text: Max tries to see, eyes barely open.
speaker_heading: MAX
text: He's one of the lunatics Dino uses.
dialog: He's in a bunch of these.
text: Welles watches. On the TV, Masked Man takes off his jacket
text: shirtless, reveals an impossibly muscled body. Huge arms,
text: thick chest, oiled, dotted in pimples.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Why? He have something to do with
dialog: whatever you're into?
text: Still watching the behemoth on TV, Welles is less sure.
text: ON TV: the bulging Masked Man flexes, ripped.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: No... it's nothing... that's not him.
text: Welles rubs his eyes, sits back. Max sits up, watching.
text: ON TV: Masked Man pulls the bound woman's head back by her
text: hair, licks her face with his thick tongue...
text: CLOSE ON: Masked Man grips the woman's head, still licking.
text: He pulls down the woman's blindfold...
text: Welles sits forward, realizing, horrified...
text: Welles goes to the VCR, hits PAUSE. The IMAGE on TV
text: FREEZES. Welles goes back, FRAME by FRAME...
text: ... to the CLOSE UP where Masked Man grips the woman's face.
text: FREEZE FRAME. On Masked Man's hand: a TATTOO, on the arch
text: between his forefinger and thumb, same as the scrawny Masked
text: Man in the snuff film. A PENTAGRAM TATTOO.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Who is he?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I told you, he's one of Dino
dialog: Velvet's stock players...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Who is he, his name?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Nobody knows his name. That's his
dialog: thing. He always wears a mask. You
dialog: never see his face. He calls
dialog: himself "Machine," that's what they
dialog: call him. Machine.
text: Welles hits PLAY. On TV, Masked Man runs his hands up and
text: down the woman's body. The woman's eyes are filled with
text: fear. Welles sits, unnerved, watching.
speaker_heading: MAX
text: They say he's half brain-dead from
text: all the steroids he's using.
text: Max rolls over, trying to get back to sleep.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: He's a brutal motherfucker, man. He
dialog: loves what he does for a living.
scene_heading: INT. WELLES' MOTEL ROOM -- DAY
text: Welles enters, carries an OVERNIGHT PACKAGE and his LOCK
text: BOX. At the desk, he tears open the package, opens the
text: MANILA ENVELOPE inside; finds FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS in
text: thousand dollar bills, wrapped in plastic and masking tape.
text: Welles takes the lock box to the bed and works the
text: combination, opens it. He takes out the holster, stands
text: looking down at the gun. He puts the holster on.
scene_heading: EXT. 1204 WAREHOUSE -- DAY
text: Welles' Ford waits with turn signal on. A car pulls out of

scene_heading: INT. WELLES' CAR -- DAY

speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: You don't need to be here.

scene_heading: INT. 1204 WAREHOUSE, SECOND FLOOR -- DAY
text: Welles and Max get off the elevator, moving down the grey

dialog: Who is it?
text: Welles waits, presses the button again.
scene_heading: INT. DINO VELVET STUDIO -- DAY
text: The doors BUZZ and Welles and Max warily enter this large,
text: dark, converted warehouse. Square pillars shoot from floor
text: to ceiling. Shafts of light cut down from high windows.
text: A large THUG in a pinstripe suit crosses from a far DESK.
speaker_heading: THUG
dialog: You're in the wrong place.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: We're looking for Mr. Velvet.
speaker_heading: THUG
dialog: He's not here.
text: Welles looks around, at piles of PROPS; a huge faux-stone
text: ANGEL and GARGOYLES, elaborate CANDELABRAS, a huge BIRDCAGE,
text: massive WOODEN CROSS, NAZI FLAGS.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Why don't you tell him we're here to
dialog: give him a large sum of money. If
dialog: he's not interested, we'll go.
speaker_heading: THUG

speaker_heading: DINO VELVET'S VOICE (V.O.)
speaker_heading: (from SPEAKERS)
dialog: Show them in, Milo.
text: Welles and Max look up. There are SPEAKERS mounted high up
text: on the pillars, and SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS looking down.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: You heard the boss, Milo.
text: The disgruntled thug starts back across the studio towards
text: a distant DOOR. Welles and Max follow...
text: They notice an elaborate set built in one corner, a TORTURE
text: CHAMBER, complete with RACK and IRON MAIDEN.
scene_heading: INT. DINO VELVET'S OFFICE -- DAY
text: Thug opens the door and lets Welles and Max in.
text: The office is huge, windowless walls covered in thousands of
text: PICTURES from every conceivable source, torn and cut, pinned
text: up to form an indecipherable collage. A tall LADDER leans
text: against one wall, near three TELEVISIONS.
text: DINO VELVET rises behind his desk, a small, bird-like man,
text: wearing a black suit and bad hairpiece.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: Come in. Make yourself comfortable.
text: Welles shakes Dino's hand. Max looks up at the walls.
text: IMAGES; porn pictures, news photos, world leaders, autopsy
text: photos, armies and insects, the naked and the dead.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: It's an honor to meet you. Thank
dialog: you for seeing us.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: What can I do for you today?
text: Welles sits. Shelves behind Dino's desk are piled high with
text: VIDEO CASSETTES, old MOVIE CAMERAS, big REELS of 16mm FILM.
text: VIDEOS and MAGAZINES are stacked everywhere.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I'd like to commission a work. I'm
dialog: a great admirer of yours.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: Flattering. And, who's your
dialog: colorful little chum?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: A fellow investor.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: Hmm.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You're the only one still shooting
text: film and transferring it to video.
dialog: Nobody appreciates that kind of
dialog: integrity anymore... the grain, the
dialog: gritty look you get.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: Well, I'm glad you appreciate it.
dialog: (to Welles)
dialog: What would you say is your favorite
dialog: piece?
text: Welles considers. Max glances over, looks back to the walls.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I know if I had to pick, it'd be
dialog: "Choke," or "Devil."
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: "Devil" frightened me as much as it
dialog: excited me, but I'd be hard pressed
dialog: to choose a favorite.
text: Dino grins, showing yellowed teeth.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: You said something about money.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Yes. What we're looking for is
dialog: rather specific.
text: Welles takes out an ENVELOPE, puts it on the desk.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: That's five thousand dollars.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: Is it?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Five thousand now, five thousand on
dialog: delivery.
dialog: Two women, one white and one black,
dialog: as long as they have large breasts.
dialog: Hard bondage, or course. Other than
dialog: that, trusting your artistic
dialog: interpretation, I have only two
dialog: stipulations.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: And they are?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I want to watch you work.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: I'll consider it.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: And the other performer... it has to
dialog: be that monster you use... the man

speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: Machine.
speaker_heading: WELLES

dialog: He might be interested... but it
dialog: would mean another five thousand.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: We can do that.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: Well, well, I'll have to put my
dialog: thinking-cap on about all this.
dialog: You'll leave the money as a deposit?
dialog: (off Welles' nod)
dialog: Very good.
text: Dino stands, picks up a still CAMERA off his desk and comes
text: to look at Welles, studying him.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: You have a beautiful face... the way
dialog: the light hits it. I'd like to take
dialog: your picture. You don't mind?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I'd rather you didn't.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: What's the problem?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I'm camera shy.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: You trust me to keep your money, but
dialog: not to take your picture?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Those are two different kinds of
dialog: trust.
dialog: (stands)
dialog: Thank you for your time. I hope we
dialog: can do business.
text: Welles leaves. Max goes with him. Dino watches them leave.
scene_heading: EXT. MANHATTAN STREET -- NIGHT
text: HORNS BLARE. TWO CARS have collided head-on. A large CROWD
text: gathers. One windshield's shattered, blood spattered. The
text: driver is slumped over the wheel, gushing blood.
text: On a nearby street corner, Welles in on a PAY PHONE.
text: HEAVY METAL can be HEARD filtered through the receiver.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: So, what do you say?
scene_heading: INT. DINO VELVET'S OFFICE -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS
text: Dino's stands in the middle of his office, naked, his back
text: to us, 8MM camera in hand, on the phone. A NAKED WOMAN
text: dances for Dino. A Heavy Metal MUSIC VIDEO plays on a TV.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: I'll do this for you. Fifteen
dialog: thousand dollars.
speaker_heading: WELLES (V.O.)
dialog: (from phone)
dialog: Machine's in?
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: He's in. It will be his pleasure.
scene_heading: INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET (V.O.)
dialog: (from phone)
dialog: Be at 366 Hoyt Avenue, three

text: Welles digs out his notepad, writing.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Where's that?
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET (V.O.)
dialog: Brooklyn. Don't be late.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL COURTYARD, POOL -- NIGHT
text: HORNS and TRAFFIC are HEARD. Max and Welles sit in lawn
text: chairs at the tiny pool. Welles smokes. Max drinks beer.
text: They watch an ELDERLY WOMAN in a one piece bathing suit
text: climb from the pool and walk to the diving board, diving in.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What's next?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I'm trying to figure that out
dialog: myself. I have to see Machine
text: without his mask.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Still don't want to tell me what
dialog: you're doing?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Nope.
text: The old woman climbs out and heads back to the diving board.
text: Welles takes out a thick ENVELOPE, hands it to Max.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: This is for you.
text: Max doesn't understand, opens the envelope, finds about
text: fifteen thousand dollars in the envelope.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: It's money. People use it to
dialog: purchase goods and services.
text: Max looks at it again, can't believe it.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Look... that's awful generous and
dialog: everything...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: It's not my money. The woman I got
dialog: it from is never going to give it a
dialog: second thought. Let's not make a
dialog: big deal out of this, okay?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Go be a race car driver. Go run for
dialog: President. Whatever.
text: Welles puts his cigarette out, stands.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I'll see you around.
text: Welles walks away, heading to his room. Max watches him go,
text: doesn't know what to say, looks in the envelope.
text: The old woman climbs out and heads back to the diving board.
scene_heading: EXT. BROOKLYN STREETS -- DAY
text: A deserted, war zone neighborhood of abandoned, graffittied
text: buildings. A few burnt out cars on the street. Welles
text: drives through, watchful.
text: Welles drives past a huge TWO-STORY WAREHOUSE, does a u-turn.
text: He parks the car.
scene_heading: INT. WELLES' CAR -- DAY
text: Welles checks his gun, returns it to his holster.
scene_heading: EXT. BROOKLYN WAREHOUSE -- DAY
text: Welles climbs crumbling concrete stairs, looking all
text: directions, crossing a LOADING DOCK towards a DOOR...
scene_heading: INT. BROOKLYN WAREHOUSE -- DAY
text: Welles enters slowly, trying to get his eyes to adjust to
text: the darkness. A vast, empty space looms before him.
text: In the middle of the warehouse, Dino Velvet stands, in a
text: powder blue suit, holding an archery BOW and ARROW.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: There you are. Come join us.
text: There's a wrought IRON BED not far from Dino. MACHINE is
text: seated on the mattress, a huge man, wearing a leather S+M
text: harness and the same WRESTLING MASK as in the snuff film.
text: Welles gathers his courage, walks towards them.
text: Dino pulls back on the bow, aiming away across the
text: warehouse. He stands by a TABLE with a QUIVER of ARROWS
text: propped up. He shoots an arrow toward a large TARGET...
text: Strikes the target dead center, BULL'S-EYE. As Welles gets
text: closer, he notices several things ...
text: ... a 16MM CAMERA mounted on a TRIPOD, facing the bed, along
dialog: with several movie LIGHTS
text: ... several BOWIE KNIFES are laid out on the table, beside
text: a pair of HANDCUFFS...
text: ... Machine is watching him as he approaches...
text: Welles stops, not far from Dino and Machine, but keeping his
text: distance. Dino's still firing arrows at the target.
text: Machine's still staring at Welles.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (to Machine)
dialog: Hello.
text: Machine just stares at him with bloodshot eyes.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: You brought the money?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (takes out envelope)
dialog: Right here.
text: Dino lets fly another arrow... another bull's-eye, then
text: turns to look at Welles with a smile.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: Excellent.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Where are the women?
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: They should be here any minute.
text: Welles comes forward slowly, places the envelope on the
text: table, beside Bowie knifes. He's sweating.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (of the knifes)
dialog: What are these for?
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: Hmm? Oh, the knifes? They're just
dialog: props. Nice, aren't they?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Sure.
text: Dino walks across towards the target.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: Machine and I were just talking
dialog: about knifes. The beauty of
dialog: knifes...
text: Dino pulls arrows from the target.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: He was saying how fascinated he is
dialog: by their simple ability to be sharp.
dialog: The ability of a piece of metal to
dialog: be so thin that it is almost
dialog: nothing...
text: Dino walks back to the table, replaces the arrows in the
text: quiver, cueing another arrow in is bow.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: So close to nothingness that it cuts
dialog: with minimum effort, because it's so
text: non-intrusive. Flesh is fooled. It
text: blooms open as the blade widens, but
dialog: by then it's too late, because the
dialog: knife's already doing its pure,
dialog: simple damage.
text: Dino shoots another arrow to the target.
text: A CLATTER attracts Welles attention. Far across the
text: warehouse, a DELIVERY DOOR rolls upwards. A CAR with tinted
text: windows drives in...
text: The MAN who opened the door, silhouetted in sunlight, stays
text: behind to close the door as the car pulls forward...
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: Ah, ours guests have arrived.
text: Machine stands. He is a giant.
text: Welles takes a few steps back, wary, sweating hard now.
text: The car parks across the warehouse, not far from the target.
text: Dino puts another arrow in his bow, pulls it taunt, aims at
text: the target... turns, aims the arrow at Welles.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: Mister Welles... would you be so
dialog: kind as to remove any firearms from
dialog: your person?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: What are you... ?
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: Take out your gun!
text: Welles brings his hand towards his holster...
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: Slowly. Let me see it.
text: Welles takes out his gun, looks across the warehouse...
text: The SILHOUETTED MAN is walking this way. Can't tell who he
text: is yet. Machine heads the direction of the parked car.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
text: Empty the gun onto the table, very
dialog: carefully.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Look, I don't know what this...
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: Shut up, cunt! Do exactly as I say,
dialog: or I'll put this arrow through your
dialog: throat.
text: Welles obeys, helpless, dumps the bullets out on the table.
text: The SILHOUETTED MAN'S getting closer. It's Eddie Poole.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Is that him?
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: (to Welles)
dialog: Put the gun down, take the
dialog: handcuffs. Handcuff yourself to the
dialog: bed.
text: Welles obeys, walks to the bed.
text: Welles attaches one cuff to the bed's iron rail, fastens the
text: other cuff around his wrist. Dino puts down the bow and arrow.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: (still to Welles)
dialog: Didn't know what to make of you at
dialog: first, and you certainly had Eddie
dialog: on pins and needles. But, lo and
dialog: behold, from out of the blue came an
dialog: old business acquaintance to explain
dialog: everything...
text: Welles looks across to the car...
text: The sinister lawyer, Longdale, gets out from behind the
text: wheel and hands the keys to Machine, walks this way...
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: This is the fucker? Motherfucker,
dialog: doesn't look like anything...
text: Eddie walks around the bed, studies Welles. Welles watches
text: him. Eddie goes to stand behind Welles, rushes forward...
text: PUNCHES Welles in the side of the head.
text: Welles goes down, clutching his face.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Doesn't look like shit.
text: Eddie pulls Welles to his feet, throws him against the bed,
text: frisking him from head to toe.
text: Longdale comes to stand beside Dino, nervous, taking out a
text: tiny HANDGUN and pointing it at Welles. Welles looks up,
text: holding his head, afraid, sits on the bed.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: (to Welles)
dialog: You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I remember him.
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: Let's get this over with.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: Fine idea.
text: Dino comes to sit on the bed beside Welles.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: You're going to go get the film you
dialog: received from Mrs. Christian, bring
dialog: it here and put it in my hand. And
dialog: to save time, so we make this as
dialog: efficient as possible, there's an
dialog: incentive...
text: Dino puts his fingers in his mouth, lets out a sharp WHISTLE.
text: Across the warehouse, Machine uses the car keys to open the
text: trunk of the car, pulls SOMEONE out...
text: It's Max, beaten bloody, bound, face swollen, gagged, hardly
text: conscious. Machine throws him to the floor.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: No...
text: Welles tries to go towards Max, yanked back by the
text: handcuffs, pulls the bed a few inches, but it's heavy.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: Friend of yours?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Look, he's got nothing to do with
dialog: this... let him go...
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: Can you guess what I'm going to say
dialog: next?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: He doesn't know anything... he's got
dialog: nothing to do with this...
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: Bring the film, or we kill him.
text: Sorrow and rage rises up in Welles, but there's no choice.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I'll get it. It's in a safe deposit
dialog: box, in the city...
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: How cooperative. Longdale will keep
dialog: you company.
text: Dino takes out HANDCUFF KEYS, throws them to Longdale.
text: Longdale approaches Welles carefully, unlocking him.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: Don't let Longdale's questionable
dialog: choice of weapon give you any ideas.
dialog: If his fey little gun puts enough
dialog: little holes in you, you'll be just
dialog: as dead... and so will Max.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Move it, dirtbag... !
text: Eddie comes to SHOVE Welles. Welles stumbles to the
text: ground, gets to his feet. Welles walks, takes one last
text: glance back towards Max. Longdale follows.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: (watching them go)
dialog: Do hurry.
scene_heading: EXT. MANHATTAN STREETS -- DAY
text: Welles' car moves in the slow flow of traffic into mid-town.
scene_heading: INT. WELLES' CAR -- CONTINUOUS
text: Welles is at the wheel. Longdale is in the passenger seat,
text: gun held in his lap.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: You were the middleman, am I right?
dialog: Old man Christian wasn't about to go
text: shopping for a snuff film himself.
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: Wouldn't exactly have been possible
dialog: for a man of his stature.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: So, he sent you, gave you the money,
dialog: his errand-boy. And if you refused,
dialog: it wasn't like you could tell anyone
dialog: your pervert boss just asked you to
dialog: get him a snuff film. That's the
dialog: beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: That's trust. Mr. Christian trusted
dialog: me implicitly.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Must have paid you a lot, for you to
dialog: risk everything. Would've had to
dialog: have cut yourself a real nice piece
dialog: of money.
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: I was well compensated.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: That's why you got scared when Mrs.
dialog: Christian hired me. You knew about
dialog: the film, figured it had to be in
dialog: that safe. How'd you find me?
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: Never mind how I found you.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Followed me... must have freaked out
dialog: when you saw me closing in on your
dialog: buddies...
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: They're no friends of mine.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Except, you're willing commit murder
dialog: with them.
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: None of this would be happening if
dialog: you would have left it alone. If
dialog: you weren't digging up a girl who
dialog: died six years ago. A girl no one
dialog: even remembers.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Mary Anne Mathews, that was her
text: name. Her mom remembers her.
text: Welles looks at Longdale.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: You found these smut dealers and
dialog: asked to buy a snuff film, right?
dialog: Wanted them to find you one. Well,
dialog: they didn't find you one, Longdale,
dialog: they went out and made you one...
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you
dialog: paid money to have her murdered.
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: Shut your mouth and drive!
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Did it get him off, huh, watching
dialog: them cut her up? Tell me, because
dialog: I really want to understand. Did he
dialog: jerk off to it? You watch it with
text: him, sit there giving him a handjob
dialog: while you both watched... ?
text: Longdale jams the gun against Welles' side.
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: You're making me very angry.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Just tell me. Tell me some more of
dialog: the secrets you and Christian
dialog: shared. What kind of degenerate
dialog: pervert was he really? What the
dialog: fuck did he want with a snuff film?
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: You're asking me why?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I'm asking.
text: Longdale sits back, wipes sweat from his face.
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: A man like Mr. Christian, a great
dialog: man... all his money, all his
dialog: power... a man who attained
dialog: everything there was to attain...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Why did he buy a film of some poor,
dialog: lost girl getting butchered?
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: Isn't it incredibly obvious?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Enlighten me.
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: Because he could. He did it because
dialog: he could.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: What other reason were you looking
dialog: for?
text: Welles tightens his grip on the wheel, numbed.
scene_heading: EXT. CHASE MANHATTAN BANK -- DAY
text: Welles double parks, puts his hazard lights on.
scene_heading: INT. WELLES' CAR -- CONTINUOUS
text: Longdale sits forward, looks to the bank.
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: You've got four minutes till I call
dialog: Mr. Velvet and let him know there's
dialog: a problem.
text: Longdale takes a CELLULAR PHONE from his pocket, shows it.
text: Welles climbs out, heading to the bank...
scene_heading: INT. BANK, SAFE DEPOSIT VAULT -- DAY
text: Welles and the SAFE DEPOSIT MANAGER enter. They go to put
text: their KEYS in one drawer, unlocking it a pulling it out.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: May I show you to a booth...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: No, I've got it.
text: Welles pulls the drawer open, takes the 8MM film out and
text: hands the empty drawer to the manager, exiting.
scene_heading: INT. BANK -- DAY
text: Welles comes out from the SAFE DEPOSIT VAULT, pocketing the
text: film, crossing towards the entrance, looking around...
text: ... at other CUSTOMERS waiting on line...
text: ... at a GUARD with a GUN at his side...
text: Welles detours, toward one of the LOAN DESKS. The BANK
text: EMPLOYEE behind the desk is occupied, on the phone.
text: As Welles moves past the desk, he grabs a PAIR of SCISSORS
text: from a pencil holder and palms it, heading to the door...
scene_heading: INT. WELLES' CAR -- DAY
text: Welles gets behind the wheel. Longdale looks at his watch.
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: You almost went over your limit.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Fuck you.
text: Welles puts the car in gear and drives.
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: Give me the film.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: You'll get it when we get there.
text: Longdale puts the gun to the side of Welles' head.
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: Give me the film.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Go ahead, shoot me. Then try
dialog: driving to Brooklyn with my brains
text: all over the windshield.
text: Welles keeps driving. Longdale sits back, stewing.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE -- DAY
text: The door is kicked open. Welles enters, takes the 8MM FILM
text: out and holds it in his hand. Longdale follows.
text: As Welles moves forward, his face goes slack...
text: Machine is seated on the bed, Eddie and Dino stand smoking
text: cigarettes, and further on, Max is tied to the target,
text: slumped over, three arrows in his chest. Dead.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: No!!
text: Welles runs towards Max, crying out, tears in his eyes...
text: Machine rises, goes to intercept Welles, grabbing him.
text: Welles tries to break free, but Machine lifts Welles up and
text: throws him brutally to the ground.
text: Welles scrambles to get up...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: You fuckers!
text: Eddie comes to KICK Welles in the face.
text: Welles is sent sprawling, blood gushing from his nose. He
text: lays there, stunned, weeping.
text: Eddie pries the 8MM FILM from Welles' hand, tosses it...
text: Dino catches the film.
text: Machine comes to drag Welles towards the bed.
text: Dino unspools the film, holding it up to examine it.
text: Machine handcuffs Welles to the metal bedframe. Welles
text: falls to his knees, holding his face.
text: Eddie PUNCHES Welles in the head.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You're a dead man.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: Leave him alone.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Fuck off.
text: Eddie PUNCHES Welles in the kidney. Welles tries to protect
text: himself. Eddie raises his fist to punch again, but Machine
text: catches Eddie's fist, throws Eddie back...
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What the fuck... !
speaker_heading: DINO
dialog: I promised him to Machine.
text: Eddie looks up at Machine, who towers over him.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: ... sorry...
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: First things first. You might want
dialog: to watch this, Mr. Welles...
text: Welles looks up through tears...
text: Dino drops the 8MM FILM on the floor, takes a small bottle
text: of lighter fluid from his pocket. Longdale comes to watch.
text: Welles watches helpless, agonizing...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Don't... please...
text: Dino drops the film to the floor, sprays it with fluid,
text: takes out matches, light one, drops it...
text: The 8MM FILM goes up in flame...
text: Welles watches, quaking, hysterical, trying to pull himself
text: towards the flame, dragging the bed...
text: The film is destroyed by flame...
text: Welles gives up, presses his face to the floor, eyes shut.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
text: And so it ends. It's as if she
dialog: never existed.
text: Welles falls back, gasping, wiping blood and tears and
text: spittle from his face, getting slowly, to his feet.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: Don't blame yourself. You were in
dialog: way over your head.
text: He looks to Max's corpse, to the smoldering film...
text: Swallowing back his fear, panic and rage...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Motherfuckers. Small time,
dialog: motherfuckers... ! Tell me
dialog: something...
text: Welles spits blood, hangs onto the bed for support.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I know why you did it, Dino,
dialog: Eddie... but, why'd the lawyer do
dialog: it? Must have been a helluva lot of
dialog: money, right? One fuckload of
dialog: money...
text: Welles sits on the bed, eyes burning with fury.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: So, what are you all still doing
dialog: small time, huh? What are you still
dialog: doing in the sewer, Eddie?!
dialog: Christian gave Longdale a million
dialog: dollars to find him a snuff film.
dialog: How much did you ever see... ?
text: Eddie and Dino look to Longdale.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What's he talking about?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: One million dollars, Dino. How much
dialog: did he tell you he had...
text: Longdale's getting very nervous.
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: He's lying.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Look at him. You think he played it
dialog: square? How much did he give you,
dialog: how much did he keep for himself?
text: Eddie walks towards Longdale...
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What the fuck's he talking about?
text: Longdale takes out his gun, aims it at Machine, Dino and
dialog: Eddie, scared...
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: Stay away from me.
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: What's going on, Longdale? Did this
dialog: happen?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You sell us short, you fuck?
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: Stay back! You have a gun, Eddie,
dialog: show it to me. Now!
text: Eddie slowly takes out his gun, seething.
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: Put it on the ground, kick it here...
text: Eddie puts the gun down, kicks it...
text: Longdale picks it up, throws it far away.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You fucking lawyer...
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: Move back! All of you... move!
text: Machine, Dino and Eddie stand between Longdale and the car
text: with tinted windows parked across the warehouse...
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: What were you thinking?
text: Welles watches as Machine, Dino and Eddie back slowly away
text: from Longdale. Longdale's gun hand is shaky...
text: Welles tries to drag himself towards the table where his gun
text: and bullets are, dragging the bed, inch by inch...
text: Longdale back away, trying to angle around the menacing trio
dialog: so he can get to the car...
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: Back off! Everything's been taken
dialog: care of, and I'm leaving now...
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: You're not going anywhere if you
dialog: fucked us, lawyer.
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: I'm leaving.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You got the guts, tough guy? Gonna
dialog: kill us all, is that it?
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: You betrayed us.
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: Stay where you are!
text: Machine edges forward, holding his hands in the air.
text: Longdale brandishes the gun...
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: Keep back!
text: Machine, Eddie and Dino are held at bay...
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: You're not gonna live through this.
text: Welles still tries to get to the table, wrist bleeding in
text: the cuff, bed screeching across the floor...
text: Machine, hands up, slowly reaches behind his shoulder,
text: touches the handle of a huge KNIFE sheathed to his back.
speaker_heading: LONGDALE
dialog: Our business is done, I'm leaving,
dialog: no one's going to stop me...
text: Longdale glances towards the car, seems like he's about to
text: make a run for it. Dino Velvet takes a step forward...
speaker_heading: DINO VELVET
dialog: Fuck you!
text: Machine unsheathes the KNIFE and THROWS...
text: THUNK! The knife imbeds to the hilt in Longdale's chest and
text: Longdale's gun FIRES...
text: Dino Velvet flies backwards, shot in the face!
text: Dino hits the ground, screaming, writhing, hands to his
text: face, blood pouring out between his fingers.
text: Longdale falls back onto his ass, sitting there, eyes bugged
text: out in surprise. He looks down at the knife in his chest.
text: Machine lets out a SCREAM, runs to Dino...
text: Machine falls to his knees and grips Dino, tries to hold
text: him. Dino's screaming, squirming frantically...
text: Longdale sits looking down at the knife in his chest, looks
text: up, and gallons of blood pour from his mouth...
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Fuck.
text: Eddie comes to look down at the Longdale. Longdale falls
text: back, dead, blood still flowing from his maw.
text: Welles drags the heavy bed, getting closer to the table...
text: Eddie spins, looks across to see Welles struggling...
text: Dino breaks free from Machine, runs blindly, still holding
text: his gushing face, falls, tries to get back up...
text: Eddie runs towards Welles.
text: Dino stumbles forwards, writhing, then suddenly lays still.
text: Machine rises, looking at Dino. Tears come out from
text: Machine's eyes and roll down his mask.
text: One last gasp and shudder from Dino's body; death rattle.
text: Welles pulls the bed, practically pulling his arm from the
text: socket, desperately clawing towards the table...
text: The table is mere feet away...
text: Eddie arrives, KICK Welles in the ribs...

speaker_heading: MACHINE
dialog: He's mine!
text: Machine strides over the Longdale's corpse, puts his foot on
text: Longdale's chest, yanks out the knife...
dialog: Machine starts this way...
text: Eddie backs from Welles. Welles looks up, trying to shake
text: off unconsciousness, sees Machine coming...
text: Welles bows down, on his knees, as if to accept his fate...
text: Reaching his free hand into his suit pocket...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: No, no, no... please, don't kill
dialog: me... please... !
text: Machine arrives, knife in hand, lifts Welles' head back by

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Do him good.
text: Welles rises suddenly, arm shooting forward, STABBING
text: SCISSORS deep in Machine stomach...
text: Machine ROARS, falling back, pitching forward...
text: Machine's knife clatters to the ground.
text: Eddie's eyes go wide.
text: Machine hits the floor, clutching his guts.

text: Eddie moves forward, furious...
text: Welles grabs Machine's knife, wielding it, holding Eddie off.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Back off, Eddie...
text: Welles drags the now lightened bed frame towards the table.
text: Eddie's sorely tempted, but keeps away.
text: Eddie turns, looks across the warehouse...
text: There's his gun, lying there, far away.
text: Eddie runs for the gun.
text: Welles pulls himself to the table, reaches for the gun,
text: knocks the table over. He's got the gun, but...
text: Bullets hit the floor as the table falls.
text: Welles struggles to open his gun with his sole free hand,
text: gets it open, holds it between his knees...
text: Welles grabs a bullet...
text: Eddie's running toward his gun, gasping for air...
text: Machine's on his knees, pulling the scissors out with
dialog: trembling hands...
text: Welles puts the bullet in the gun, flips it shut, rises,
text: taking aim across the warehouse...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Stop Eddie!
dialog: Eddie's running...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (pulls back the hammer)
dialog: I swear to Christ I'll shoot you in
dialog: the back... !

text: Machine stays on his knees, holding his bleeding stomach.
text: Welles points his gun at Machine.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Come back, or I put a hole in him.
text: Eddie's looking at his gun, so close, so far away.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: You might make it to your gun, but
dialog: not before I shoot Machine. And if
dialog: I have to shoot him because of you,
dialog: and I don't kill him, right after he
dialog: kills me, he's gonna kill you.
text: Eddie turns, starts walking back...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (to Machine)
dialog: Take off the mask.
text: Machine shakes his head.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Take it off!
speaker_heading: MACHINE
dialog: You got one bullet.
text: Welles looks to see Eddie heading back, keeps the gun on
text: Machine, backs away, dragging the bed frame, looks to the
text: DOOR behind him...
speaker_heading: MACHINE
dialog: The only choice you have now, is
dialog: which one of us kills you.
text: Welles backs away, drags the bedframe. Eddie's getting
text: close. Welles points the gun at Eddie. Eddie slows.
text: Welles points the gun at Machine, points the gun at Eddie.
text: Welles puts the gun to the chain of his handcuffs, FIRES...
text: breaks the handcuff chain.
text: Welles bolts to the door...
speaker_heading: MACHINE
dialog: Get the gun!
text: Eddie runs back towards his gun.

speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: You don't understand...
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: No, I don't, because you're not

speaker_heading: WELLES

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: She died in her sleep three days

speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I just talked to her.
text: Cindy's crying. Welles sits into a chair, trying to
text: understand this, his mind racing. He hangs up the phone.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: How could you not know?
text: Misery pulls down the corners of Welles' mouth. He tries to
text: find words, but none come. He sits forward and hides his

scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM -- LATER NIGHT
text: Cindy sleeps, encircled by pillows and blankets on the bed.

text: ELEVATOR doors open and Welles gets off. He moves down the
text: hall, around a corner, heading to "Celebrity Films."
text: Welles tries the door knob, finds it locked. He looks

text: translucent glass of the door...
scene_heading: INT. CELEBRITY FILMS OFFICE -- DAY
text: Welles pushes broken glass out of the way, reaches in to
text: open the door. The office has been cleaned out, trash on
text: the floor, desk drawers hanging open and empty, shelves
text: empty, posters gone...
text: Welles grabs one of the file cabinets, pulls it open, finds
text: it empty, pulls it all the way out and throws it.
scene_heading: INT. 8TH FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY
text: People peer out from other offices, worried. Welles exits
text: Eddie's office, ignoring them, goes around the corner,

text: Welles enters slow, pockets the tools, takes out his gun.

text: is predictably a trash heap, strewn with VIDEOS, MAGAZINES,
text: dirty DISHES and fast food remnants. Welles moves on...
scene_heading: INT. EDDIE'S BEDROOM -- DAY
text: Eddie's throwing clothing into a suitcase, hurried. Welles
text: comes into the doorway, taking aim, edging forward.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Hello, Eddie.
text: Eddie spins, startled.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Put your hands on your head.
text: Eddie looks out of the corner of his eye... to his GUN.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Put your hands behind your head,
dialog: lock your finger together, get down
dialog: on your knees.
text: Eddie does as commanded, gets to his knees. Welles moves
text: towards him, very nervous, white-knuckling the gun.
text: He KICKS Eddie in the stomach, doubles him over.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I owe you a few.
text: Welles KICKS again.
scene_heading: INT. EDDIE'S KITCHEN -- DAY
text: Welles enters the filthy kitchen, carrying Eddie's gun. At
text: the sink, Welles pops the gun's clip. He pushes the bullets
text: out into his palm, one by one.
text: He dumps the bullets into the GARBAGE DISPOSAL, drops the
text: clip in, turns it on. The DISPOSAL makes a terrible
text: GRINDING NOISE, straining, till it finally goes dead.
scene_heading: INT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY
text: Welles goes to the picture window and closes the curtains.
text: He turns on a lamp, goes back towards the bedroom. After a
text: moment, he returns, dragging Eddie on the floor...
text: Eddie's bleeding out his nose, hands DUCT-TAPED together
text: behind his back, legs bound at the ankle, dragged by a belt
text: around his neck, choking...
text: Welles drops the belt, undoes it from Eddie's neck. Eddie
text: gasps for air. Welles pulls him up, puts him on the couch.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Don't go anywhere.
text: Welles heads for the stairs...
scene_heading: EXT. EDDIE'S GARAGE -- DAY
text: Welles goes to Eddie car, tries the door, it's unlocked...
speaker_heading: IN THE CAR
text: Welles takes the thick THOMAS GUIDE map book off the dash.
scene_heading: INT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY
text: Welles returns. Eddie's on the floor, wriggling. Welles
text: drops the Thomas Guide on the coffee table, picks Eddie up,
text: throws him back onto the couch.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I'm gonna kill you.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Don't bore me with that bullshit.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: How'd you find me here?
text: Welles PUNCHES Eddie in the ear.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Don't ask questions.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Fuck you!
text: Welles PUNCHES Eddie in the same ear. Eddie's hurting.
text: Welles rubs his aching knuckles.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Starting to recognize a pattern?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Who is Machine?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I don't know...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I want his name.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I told you, I don't know.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I will never get tired of hurting
dialog: you, Eddie, so you might want to
dialog: change your attitude.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What the fuck am I gonna protect
dialog: that freak for? He was Dino's boy,
text: not mine. He shows up with his mask
text: on, leaves with his mask on. Nobody
dialog: knows.
text: Welles kicks junk off a chair, sits, takes out his gun.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Okay, we'll come back to that. So,
dialog: six years ago a guy contacts you,
dialog: through the classifieds, over the
dialog: phone, however he does it. It's
text: Longdale, looking for a snuff film.
dialog: And you, entrepreneur that you are,
dialog: tell him you can hook him up.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Told him you could get him a snuff
dialog: film.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: How much did he pay you?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Thirty thousand each, that fucking
dialog: cocksucker.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: That's all? Thirty each. That's
dialog: all it took for you to murder her?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: It was a lot of fucking money.
text: Welles stands and paces, despairing. He picks up a LAMP and
text: throws it, SHATTERS a MIRROR, keeps pacing...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: So... you brought Dino in, and he
dialog: brought Machine. And, one day, a
dialog: girl walked into your office because
dialog: you had an ad in the paper for
dialog: models. And she never walked out.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Something like that.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: What did you do, knock her out,
dialog: shoot her up... ?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What the fuck do you want from me?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I want to know. I want to know
dialog: exactly what you did to her!
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Fuck you then, you want to know? I
dialog: talked her up, told her how
dialog: beautiful she was, told her she was
dialog: gonna be a star. I told her I was
dialog: gonna get her a screen test, and
dialog: while I'm doing that, I got her a
text: soda and dropped a mickey. When it
dialog: was dark enough, I rang Dino and
dialog: told him it was go time, I put her
dialog: in the trunk of my car and we went
dialog: and we fucking did it. That's what
dialog: happened. She's dead. She's been
dialog: dead a long fucking time. Nobody
dialog: fucking cares!
text: Welles puts down his gun, picks up the Thomas Guide, holding
text: it in both hands, SWINGS -- SLAMS Eddie across the face...
text: Eddie's stunned, lips bleeding. He faces forward.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You wanted to know, now you know.
text: Welles SWINGS the Thomas Guide -- POUNDS Eddie's face again.
text: Welles drops the Thomas Guide in a chair, picks up his gun,
text: leaves the room...
scene_heading: INT. EDDIE'S KITCHEN -- DAY
text: Welles enters, starts looking through DRAWERS, searching.
text: He finds SILVERWARE, selects a serrated STEAK KNIFE...
scene_heading: INT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY
text: Welles returns, goes to grasp Eddie by the shirt collar,
text: drags him to the floor, face down. Welles stands on Eddie's
text: neck, uses the knife to cut the duct tape on Eddie's hands.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: That's right, motherfucker, cut me
dialog: loose. Be a man.
text: Welles tosses the knife, gun trained on Eddie, picks up the
text: Thomas Guide and throws it at Eddie...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Show me!
text: Eddie, hands now free, pushes himself to a seated position,
text: looks at the Thomas Guide.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Show me where you did it, on the
dialog: map, exactly where you did it.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Because we're going there.
scene_heading: EXT. 134 FREEWAY -- DAY

scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN HIGHWAY -- DAY
text: Welles' car travels a winding HIGHWAY that serpentines up
text: into the scenic, forested SAN BERNADINO MOUNTAINS.
scene_heading: EXT. BIG BEAR -- DUSK
text: The sun is low. Big Bear Lake is vast, surrounded by
text: wilderness on all sides. Welles' car follows a TWO-LANE
text: ROADWAY that runs along the lake's southern shore.
text: Welles' car passes sporadic SUMMER HOMES and CABINS.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERTED ROADWAY -- NIGHT
text: Heavy forests border close to the road. Welles' car travels
text: alone, headlights on, slowing as it comes to an overgrown
text: gravel DRIVEWAY with a rusty CHAIN strung across it.
speaker_heading: IN THE CAR
text: Welles leans forward to look up at an old SIGN of broken
text: neon and peeled paint: "Big Bear Motor Lodge."
text: Welles pulls forward, puts the car in reverse...
text: ON THE ROADWAY
text: Welles' car backs up, angling, till the rear bumper comes
text: against the chain, BACKING... till the CHAIN SNAPS.
text: Welles' car pulls forward across the empty roadway, turns
text: around... accelerates down the overgrown driveway...
scene_heading: EXT. BIG BEAR MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT
text: Welles' car comes down the driveway, into a small LOT.
speaker_heading: IN THE CAR
text: THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: headlights reveal what's left of the
text: abandoned MOTOR LODGE, a REGISTRATION OFFICE at the center
text: with attached wings of rooms on both sides.
text: The LEFT WING of rooms is a fire ravaged, burnt-out
text: skeleton. What remains of the OFFICE and RIGHT WING is
text: boarded over, falling apart. No window has gone unbroken.
speaker_heading: IN THE LOT
text: Welles turns out headlights and parks.
text: He gets out, walks to look up the driveway. A CAR is HEARD.
text: HEADLIGHTS can be seen a good distance away through the
text: forest as the CAR PASSES.
text: Welles goes to his car, unlocks the trunk and opens it.
text: Eddie's lying in there, arms and legs bound, gagged.
scene_heading: INT. MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- NIGHT
text: The door is shoved inward, hanging crooked by one hinge.
text: Eddie enters first, hands still bound behind him. Welles
text: pushes Eddie forward, gun out.
text: Welles turns on his penlight FLASHLIGHT, shining it into the
text: room. There dead leaves all over the floor. The room's
text: empty except for a CHAIR lying on its side.
text: Welles sweeps the room with the inadequate light. This is
text: where Mary Anne Mathews died, vaguely recognizable from the
text: snuff film, without the furniture.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What are we doing here?
text: Welles goes to the bathroom door, keeping the gun trained on
text: Eddie, pushes the bathroom door open with his foot...
text: The bathroom's cracked MIRROR reflects the penlight and
text: Welles' palely lit face.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: That night... you didn't have to be
dialog: in the room, but you were.
dialog: (looks to Eddie)
dialog: Why? Why did you watch?
text: Eddie goes to the chair, tips it upright with his foot, sits.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I don't know. I felt like it. I
dialog: never saw anyone get done before.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: You enjoy it?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Made me sick, but what did I care?
dialog: What did I care if some hump wants
dialog: to beat off to that. It was just
dialog: something I was doing for money.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Tell me what happened.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What do you want to know? You saw
dialog: it, you saw the loop...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Nobody saw you bring her in?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: There wasn't nobody around. This
dialog: place was a shit-hole. I backed up
dialog: the car to the door and we carried
text: her in, like groceries. Dino made
dialog: her eat a bunch of pills, we laid
dialog: out the plastic, put film in the
text: camera and Machine went to work.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: What did you do with her body?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: Took it out the bathroom window.
text: Buried it in the woods.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Show me.
scene_heading: EXT. BIG BEAR MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT
text: Eddie and Welles come around the corner of the abandoned
text: motel, Eddie leading the way, Welles following with gun and

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What are you thinking you're gonna
dialog: do... ?
text: Welles shoves Eddie ahead.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Keep moving.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Where do you think you're taking
dialog: this, huh? Gonna be a big hero,
dialog: avenge that little girl's death?
dialog: Gonna make everything right with the
dialog: world? How you gonna do that... ?
speaker_heading: FURTHER ON
text: Welles and Eddie come over a hill, deeper into the forest...
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You can't go to the cops. All you
dialog: can do is cut me loose and walk
dialog: away, because you got nothing...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Stop talking.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You got absolute zero.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Show me where you buried her.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I don't know...
dialog: (nods to forest)
dialog: ... out there somewhere.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Where? Show me where.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I fucking don't know. What do you
dialog: think... we weren't burying
dialog: treasure. We didn't pace it out so
dialog: we could come back and get it. We
dialog: dug a hole and we put her in it.
dialog: Your guess is as good as mine.
text: Welles walks ahead of Eddie, distraught, shining his
text: flashlight ahead across the indecipherable forest floor.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You'll never find her. Nobody ever
dialog: will, and even if they did, it
dialog: doesn't mean nothing. Bring in the
dialog: cops, bring in the F.B.I., fuck 'em
dialog: all. Without the film, it never
dialog: happened. Don't you get it? It's
dialog: over. You can't do anything.
text: Welles turns, aims his gun at Eddie, furious.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I can kill you. I can leave you out
dialog: here, just like you left her.
text: Eddie's not backing down.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Do it.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Don't think I won't.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Do it! Put me out of my misery so
dialog: I don't have to listen to you
dialog: whining anymore. You think it's so
dialog: easy?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Easy enough for you.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I never killed anyone.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: That's right, you just stood there
dialog: and watched, because you "felt like
dialog: it." Almost makes you worse.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What do you want? You want me to
text: fall to my knees and start crying
dialog: like a baby... ?
text: Eddie walks towards Welles. Welles backs away...
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Where you going? You're the one
dialog: with the gun. Aren't I defenseless
dialog: enough? Come on...
text: Eddie comes ahead, defiant, the gun inches from his face.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Go ahead and kill me. Kill me with
dialog: that gun, your gun, right,
dialog: registered in your name? Dig the
dialog: hole yourself, with your bare hands,
dialog: bury the body with your bullets in
dialog: it. Fucking do it!
text: Welles step forward, presses the gun against Eddie's
text: forehead, pulls back the hammer...
text: Eddie just stares back at Welles with hatred in his eyes.
text: Welles is terrified, unsure... trying to muster the courage
text: to do it... gun hand trembling... finger on the trigger...
scene_heading: INT. MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Eddie's thrown face down to the floor. Welles comes to sit
text: on Eddie's back, facing Eddie's feet, holsters his gun,
text: takes out duct tape and grabs Eddie's feet, wrapping them...
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You pussy.
text: Welles keeps going around Eddie's ankles with the duct tape,
text: till Eddie's securely bound.
text: He rips the tape roll free and gets up, walking out...
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Fucking pussy!
scene_heading: EXT. MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT
text: Welles pulls the door closed behind him, walks to his car.
speaker_heading: IN THE CAR
text: Welles opens the passenger door and sits, shaken, at his
text: wit's end. He opens the glove compartment, finds
text: cigarettes, digs one out and lights it.
text: He looks back to the motel room.
text: He looks down to the glove compartment, at his CELLULAR
text: PHONE. After a moment, Welles picks up the phone, looks at
text: it in his hand.
speaker_heading: IN THE LOT
text: Welles gets out of the car, gets up on the hood, lays back,
text: staring at the sky. He closes his eyes, smokes.
text: Welles opens the phone, looks at the illuminated numbers.
text: He digs in his suit jacket pocket, takes out his notepad,
text: pages through, studies one page.
text: Welles sits up. He gathers himself, throws his cigarette,
text: dials a number, puts the cellular to his ear, afraid...
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
dialog: (from phone)
dialog: Hello... ?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Mrs. Mathews? It's Thomas. Do you
dialog: remember, I was there a few weeks
dialog: ago... asking about your daughter...
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
dialog: (from phone)
dialog: I remember. You just left...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: I have to tell you something. It
dialog: won't be easy for you to hear. It's
dialog: about your daughter... Mary Anne...
dialog: (struggling)
dialog: When I... when I was there with you,
dialog: her diary, in your attic, in
dialog: silverware. If you read it, you'll
dialog: know what I'm telling you is true...
text: Welles climbs off the car, paces, aching with misery...
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
dialog: What are you talking about... ?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: She went to California, to Los
dialog: Angeles... she wanted to start over.
dialog: She wanted to be an actress...
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
dialog: What... ?
text: Tears comes to Welles' eyes. It's the hardest thing he's
dialog: ever had to do in his entire life.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead.
text: She's dead.
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: Who is this... ?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: Someone... some men, they took your
dialog: daughter and they drugged her, and
dialog: they took her to a motel room...
dialog: they did terrible things to her...
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: They brought her into the room...
text: one man, he put a knife to her
dialog: throat and he raped her...
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: He raped her and...and...and he
dialog: murdered her...he cut her up with
dialog: knifes...
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
dialog: No... no... no...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: They killed her, and they took her
text: out in the forest somewhere and they
dialog: buried her...
speaker_heading: MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
dialog: Why... why are you doing this to
dialog: me... ?
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm
dialog: sorry. It happened a month after
dialog: she ran away. She's been dead all
dialog: this time...
text: MRS MATHEWS is HEARD SCREAMING, letting out a CHOCKING SOB.
text: Welles falls back against the car, holds his head, weeping...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: I'm sorry, I'm so sorry... there
dialog: wasn't anything anyone could do...
text: Welles pushes disconnect, lowers the phone, drops it to the
text: ground, utterly drained. He puts his forearm over his eyes,
text: gasping, sucking air...
text: He looks to the motel room, tamping down his sorrow, willing
dialog: it to fuel his rage...
text: He takes out his gun, hands unsteady, determined, opens the
text: gun and pours the bullets out. He closes the gun and walks
text: towards the motel room...
scene_heading: INT. MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
text: Welles SHOVES the door aside. The door's hinge breaks and
text: the door falls...
text: Eddie sits propped up against one wall, turns to look...
text: The door SLAMS to the floor.
text: Welles moves forward, enraged, closing on Eddie, raising his
text: arm with the gun grasped by the butt...
text: Eddie's eyes go wide with fear...
text: Welles SWINGS the gun down at Eddie's head...
scene_heading: EXT. MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS
text: The only SOUNDS come from the NIGHT FOREST. CRICKETS and
text: distant BIRDS. We can't see anything but the TOTAL DARKNESS
text: through the open door of the room. A CAR is HEARD, getting
text: LOUDER as it passes, FAINTER as it gets further away.
text: Finally, Welles comes to the doorway, in shock, steadying
text: himself against the door frame, shirt and suit spattered
text: red. His gun hand and gun are soaked with dripping blood.
text: Welles looks back into the room, backing away. He turns and
text: goes to his car...
speaker_heading: IN THE CAR
text: Welles climbs in the driver's side, shoves his bloody gun
text: into his holster, tries to wipe blood from his hand onto his
text: shirt, revolted. He starts the car.
scene_heading: INT. EDDIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Welles enters and crosses through...
scene_heading: INT. EDDIE'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT
text: Welles goes to the kitchen sink, turns on the water, starts
text: scrubbing his bloody hands, using dishwashing liquid,
text: scrubbing his hands desperately under running water.
scene_heading: EXT. EDDIE'S GARAGE -- NIGHT
text: Welles comes out of the house, goes to open the rear door of
text: Eddie's car, looking through BOXES of Eddie's belongings...
scene_heading: INT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Welles comes up the stairs with a BOX, dumps the contents
text: onto the living room floor: it's CHILD PORNOGRAPHY, Eddie's
text: collection from the office, HUNDREDS of PHOTOS...
scene_heading: INT. EDDIE'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT
text: Welles pulls open Eddie's cabinets, searching. He finds
text: POTS and PANS, choosing a few of the largest...
scene_heading: EXT. EDDIE'S GARAGE -- NIGHT
text: Welles uses a cut piece of GARDEN HOSE, siphoning GAS out
text: from Eddie's car, filling several kitchen POTS...
scene_heading: INT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Welles comes up the stairs, carries POTS of gasoline, dumps
text: the gasoline onto the pile of PHOTOGRAPHS...
scene_heading: INT. EDDIE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
text: Welles dumps gasoline over Eddie's bed...
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Welles stands at the pile of gasoline soaked photos, taking
text: out a MATCHBOOK, lighting one, lighting the whole book...
scene_heading: EXT. EDDIE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
text: Welles walks down the dark hill, heading to his car. He
text: gets in, starts the car and drives downhill, leaving the
text: headlights off. BEHIND, the windows of Eddie's ramshackle
text: HOUSE grow bright as FIRE SPREADS and CURTAINS BURN.
scene_heading: INT. LOS ANGELES AIRPORT -- NIGHT
text: Welles stares ahead, in fresh shirt and suit, waiting at a
scene_heading: CHECK-IN COUNTER.
text: The female AIRLINE AGENT behind the counter types in her
text: COMPUTER, stamps his ticket.
text: Welles shifts his gaze, something catches his eye...
text: Beside a stapler on the counter, a PAIR of SCISSORS.
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: There you are, Mr. Welles, confirmed
text: through to Kennedy. Gate 32B.
text: Welles stares, fixated on the SCISSORS.
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: Mr. Welles?
text: Welles looks to the agent holding up the ticket.
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: Gate 32B.
text: Welles accepts the ticket.
scene_heading: EXT. MANHATTAN MOTEL -- NIGHT
text: The Empire State Building in the distance says NYC, and a
text: CAMERA PAN DOWN says another seedy MOTEL...
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Welles sits at a small desk, looking through a PHONE BOOK,
text: white pages, finds... "HOSPITALS."
text: Welles picks up the PHONE, chooses a number, dials it...
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello, can you connect me with the
dialog: duty nurse?
dialog: (waits)
dialog: Hello, this is Lieutenant Anderson
dialog: down here in the Thirteenth
dialog: Precinct. I've got a helluva
dialog: problem I was hoping you could give
dialog: me a hand with. We had a stabbing
dialog: incident a couple of days ago, and
text: it looks like the supposed victim
dialog: gave us a false name and address.
dialog: Can you tell me if you had an adult
dialog: male with an abdominal wound in you
dialog: ER in the last forty-eight hours?
dialog: (listens)
dialog: You'd remember this guy; a body-
dialog: builder, real big guy, five foot
text: eleven, with acne all over his chest
dialog: and back...
dialog: (listens)
dialog: Alright, thanks for your help.
text: Welles hangs up, uses a pen to cross out a number in the
text: phone book, starts dialing the next number.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM -- LATER NIGHT
text: Welles lies on the bed, on the phone, rubbing his eyes.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (into phone)
text: ... guy sticks out like a sore
dialog: thumb. Five foot ten or eleven,
dialog: body-builder, bad acne...
dialog: (listen)
dialog: Okay, thanks anyway.
text: Welles gets up, hangs up, brings the phone back to the desk.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM -- MORNING
text: The PHONE BOOK'S open on the desk with nearly a hundred
text: hospital phone numbers crossed out.
speaker_heading: WELLES (O.S.)
dialog: ... abdominal wound. You'd know him
dialog: if you saw him...
text: Light cuts into the room from between the curtains. Welles
text: paces, carrying the phone with him, weary.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: He's a body-builder, stands just
dialog: under six feet...
text: Welles stops in his track, listening, suddenly attentive.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: That's right... covered in acne.
dialog: That's him, that's the guy. Listen,
dialog: we, uh... we think he filed a bogus
dialog: report on this stabbing, gave us a
dialog: false name and address...
dialog: (listens)
dialog: Yes, I'll hold.
text: Welles goes to the desk, takes out his notepad. He starts
text: feeling his pockets for his pen, can't find it, telephone
text: book, searching, looks under the desk...
text: Welles ducks under the desk to grab the pen off the floor.
speaker_heading: WELLES
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Yes... yes.
dialog: (sits, writing in pad)
dialog: Christopher Higgins. Thirty-
dialog: fifteen, Thirty Fifth Street.
dialog: Where? Astoria, Queens.
text: Welles is scribbling all this down in his notepad.
scene_heading: EXT. QUEENS STREET -- DAY
text: A relatively quiet residential street. HOMES are small, two
text: story affairs, close together, each very much like its
text: neighbor, some with tiny yards fenced in by brick walls.
text: Welles' Ford comes slowly down the street. CHILDREN in
text: school uniforms are heading off for the day in groups.
dialog: Welles parallel parks.
speaker_heading: IN THE CAR
text: Welles turns off the engine.
text: He's watching a HOUSE on the other side of the street. The
text: house is brick on the bottom, aluminum siding on top,
text: quaint, with brick staircase from the front door down to a
text: GARAGE underneath, plastic PINK FLAMINGOS on the small lawn.
text: Cars pass in the street. Welles watches school children
text: pass on the near sidewalk. He slumps down a little in his
text: seat, adjusting the rearview mirror, adjusting his side
text: mirror, rolling up the window.
text: Welles takes a cautionary look around, takes out his gun,
text: pours bullets out and pockets them. He picks up a PAPER BAG
text: off the passenger seat and opens it.
text: He takes out a long, thin metal FILE, pulling off the shrink
text: wrap packaging, feels the file with his thumb.
text: Keeping his open gun low under the steering wheel, Welles
text: slides the file into the barrel, scraping gently all along
text: the gun's inner barrel.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. WELLES' CAR -- LATER DAY
text: Welles sits smoking a cigarette, watching the quaint house.
text: He looks in his side mirror...
text: There's a large CAR coming down the block with its turn
text: signal on. Welles slumps a little lower.
text: The car passes, slowing. The GARAGE DOOR of the quaint
text: house begins to open.
dialog: Welles watches...
text: Can't really see the driver of the car except for the back
text: of his head, but he's huge. It's a good bet it's Machine.
text: Beside him in the passenger seat is a GREY HAIRED OLD WOMAN.
text: The car pulls into the darkness of the quaint house's
text: garage. After a moment, the OLD WOMAN comes from the
text: garage, walks with a cane, wears glasses. She goes to the
text: sidewalk, checks her MAILBOX, finds it empty.
text: Welles watches.
text: The old woman goes back to the garage. She goes inside.
text: The garage door closes behind her.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. WELLES' CAR -- NIGHT
text: Welles still watches the house. There's a light on in one
text: of the second floor windows, curtains closed.
text: Welles yawns, shaking his head, trying to stay awake.
text: At the quaint house, a light comes on in the front picture
text: window. Looks like a living room or dining room. The old
text: woman comes to sit at a table.
text: Welles takes binoculars off the front seat...
scene_heading: THROUGH BINOCULARS
text: The old woman says something to someone we cannot see.
text: She's at the dinner table, with a place setting in front of
text: her. After a moment, someone joins her...
dialog: It's Machine, you can tell by his bulk, by his huge
text: forearms. The lacy curtains of the window block part of our
text: view, so we never see his face.
speaker_heading: IN THE CAR
text: Welles lowers the binoculars, still watching.
text: Through the window across the street, Machine can be seen
text: putting a plate of food in front of the old woman. The old
text: woman smiles up at him, says something.
text: Machine goes to light two candles on the table with matches,
text: then goes back to stand beside the old woman.
text: Machine is seen from behind, bends to give the old woman a
text: kiss on the cheek, then leaves the room. The old woman
text: starts to eat.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. WELLES' CAR -- DAY
text: Dawn light is just breaking. Welles has fallen asleep,
text: slumped low behind the wheel, snoring lightly.
text: Welles awakens with a start, looking around, confused. He
text: calms, rubbing his eyes, wiping sweat from his features.
text: ACROSS THE STREET
text: The quaint house's garage door begins to rise.
speaker_heading: IN THE CAR
text: Welles sees this, keeps low, watching...
text: The big car backs out into the street. The old woman's
text: behind the wheel, wearing a hat, driving away, alone.
text: Welles watches the car head away in the rear view mirror.
text: ON THE STREET
text: Welles gets out of his car, shuts the door quietly behind
text: him. He starts walking towards the quaint house, looks all
text: directions, making sure no one's around.
text: Ahead, the garage door begins to close.
text: Welles picks up the pace, trying not to look too
text: conspicuous. The garage door's halfway down...
text: Welles runs towards the garage, has to dive and roll to get
text: there, but he makes it under the door just as it closes.
speaker_heading: ABOVE
text: In ONE WINDOW of the quaint house, an eyeball is peering out
text: from lacy curtains, then moves away and curtains fall shut.
scene_heading: INT. QUAINT HOUSE, GARAGE -- DAY
text: Welles gets up, takes out his gun, brushing off.
text: The garage is dark, full of BOXES and JUNK. Welles moves
text: towards the door to the house.
scene_heading: INT. QUAINT HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY
text: Machine, in T-shirt and jeans, seen only from behind, comes
text: to a DRESSER and opens a bottom drawer. His huge hands push
text: clothing aside, digging deep to the bottom of the drawer,
text: taking out the WRESTLING MASK.
text: Machine stands straight, pulling the mask down over his head.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT -- DAY
text: Welles enters from the garage, gun up. The dank basement is
text: small. A PILE of LAUNDRY lies on the floor near a WASHING
speaker_heading: MACHINE.
text: SHEETS hang off several CLOTHES LINES strung across two
text: metal poles. Welles leads with his gun...
text: He moves around the sheets, looking behind them. There's a
text: WOODEN STAIRCASE leading upstairs. Welles starts up,
text: treading lightly, trying not to make a sound...
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN -- DAY
text: Welles slowly opens the door to the kitchen, pointing his
text: gun. No one here. The decor is feminine, neat and tidy.
text: It's grandma's house, and it shows, with gaudy PRINT
text: WALLPAPER everywhere, every shelf displaying HUMMEL
scene_heading: FIGURINES or COLLECTORS PLATES. Very Home Shopping Network.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM/LIVING ROOM -- DAY
text: Welles slowly opens the swinging door, entering from the
text: kitchen, sweeping the room with his gun. No sign of
text: Machine. The whole house is dead quiet.
text: He passes the dining room TABLE where he watched the old
text: woman eat last night... passes fake PAINTINGS on the walls,
text: of waterfalls and sunset mountain landscapes... moves into
dialog: the living room area...
text: Yellow shag CARPET. A pink SOFA is covered in clear
text: plastic, facing an old TELEVISION in faux-wooden cabinet.
text: Welles heads for a staircase leading to the second floor.
text: Welles creeps up the stairs...
scene_heading: INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY
text: Welles comes up from the stairs, arrives at a closed DOOR.
text: He opens the door. It's a linen closet, with TOWELS and
text: SHEETS on shelves, and a shelf of MEDICINE.
text: Welles shuts the door and moves on. There are TWO DOORS
text: ahead, both closed. Welles takes the one to the right...
scene_heading: INT. MACHINE'S BEDROOM -- DAY
text: Welles pushes the door in, enters warily. There's a
text: constant SCRATCHING HEARD. The room is like a child's,
text: except the BED is huge. Shelves are full of BOARDGAMES and
text: COMIC BOOKS. A DANZIG POSTER on the wall. There's a RECORD
text: PLAYER with LP RECORDS beside it. A record turns on the
text: turntable, the needle caught at the center, SCRATCHING...
text: Welles eases his way over to the closet... reaching...
text: Pulls it open, steps back, gun up. Nothing. Just clothing.
scene_heading: INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY
text: Welles crosses, opens the door across the hall, enters...
text: DOWN THE HALL, very slowly, Machine's head rises on the
text: stairs, in the garish wrestling mask, peering.
scene_heading: INT. GRANDMA'S ROOM -- DAY
text: Welles stays near the door, looks around. There's a fuzzy
text: sky-blue COMFORTER on the bed, fuzzy blue SLIPPERS nearby.
text: Lots of bottles of MEDICINE on the bedside table.
text: Welles lowers his gun, takes a step back, into the hall...
scene_heading: INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY
dialog: Welles turns...
text: Machine charges down the hall, screaming with rage, BOWIE
dialog: KNIFE raised to kill...
text: Welles brings his gun up, but Machine's upon him, stabbing...
text: Welles catches Machine's hand, stops the knife. Machine
text: grips Welles' gun hand, shoving him back...
text: Welles is SLAMMED against the wall, grappling, gun hand
text: pinned. Welles GUN GOES OFF, once... twice...
text: BLOWING HOLES in the ceiling. Machine's grunts, pushing the
text: knife forward... closer to Welles, face... closer...
text: Welles struggles, overpowered. The tip of the horrible
text: knife is inches away...
text: Welles bends his knees, crouching, trying to gain distance
dialog: from the blade...
text: Machine pulls Welles gun hand lower, brings it against the
text: swinging LAUNDRY CHUTE DOOR built into the wall, begins
text: twisting Welles' hand back, trying to pry the gun loose...
text: Welles looks out the corner of his eyes to his gun...
text: Welles turns his gun hand, slowing struggling to aim the gun
text: towards the knife, but it's awful close to his face...
text: The knife's shaking, less than an inch from Welles' cheek...
text: Welles shuts his eyes and turns his head, letting out a CRY,
dialog: FIRES his gun...
text: The bullet BLASTS Machine's knife, knocks it away!
text: Machine recoils for a millisecond, but brings his now free
text: hand to Welles' throat, choking him. Welles' face reddens,
text: bleeding from bullet fragments...
text: Welles tries to pry Machine's fingers from his throat.
text: Machine works on Welles' gun hand with violent, renewed
text: effort -- SLAMS Welles' hand against the laundry chute...
text: SLAMS it... SLAMS it... till Welles DROPS the GUN...
text: The gun can be HEARD CLATTERING down the chute.
text: Machine brings his hand to join the other around Welles'
dialog: throat. Welles can't break the grip...
text: Welles PUNCHES Machine's face, till blood runs out from the
text: mask's nose hole, but it's having no effect...
text: Welles brings his KNEE UP HARD -- into Machine's stomach!
text: Machine falls to his knees with a ROAR, holds his already
text: wounded stomach, bleeding through his shirt...
text: Welles falls, clutching his throat, gasping. He struggles
text: to his feet, leaps past, headlong towards the stairs...
text: Machine rises, charging after...
scene_heading: ON THE STAIRCASE
text: Welles is TACKLED from behind...
text: Welles and Machine TUMBLE down the stairs, SMASHING the
text: wooden railing, toppling a BOOKSHELF... LANDING HARD...
text: Welles PUNCHES and KICKS, breaking free, running across the
text: living room. Machine rises to give chase...
text: Welles grabs a dining room CHAIR and THROWS it...
text: Machine knocks the chair aside, keeps coming. Welles grips
text: another chair, uses it to hold Machine off...
text: Machine grips the chair by the legs. Welles SHOVES forward,
text: pushes Machine back, letting go...
text: Welles dives under the dining table, crawling on his hands
text: and knees, scrambling...
text: Machine throws the chair, runs, leaps...
text: Machine lands on the table, crawls to the far edge, GRABBING
text: down with his meaty fists as Welles moves forward...
text: Under the table, Welles jerks back, avoiding, then rises,
text: extending his knees, PUSHING upwards from underneath...
text: Welles FLIPS the table, throwing Machine to the floor...
text: Welles charges towards the kitchen door, falls, gets up...
text: Machine gets to his feet...
scene_heading: IN THE KITCHEN
text: Welles SHOVES through the swinging door...
text: Machine BURSTS through, catching Welles, TACKLING him...
text: Welles hits the floor with Machine on top. Machine begins
text: to rein PUNCHES down on Welles, head and back...
text: Welles tries to cover up, taking a real beating...
text: Machine rises, gripping Welles, LIFTING him, THROWS him...
text: Welles SMASHES into shelves of knick-knacks over the kitchen
text: sink, SHATTERING a WINDOW, landing on the sink and counter.
text: Machine comes to grip Welles again, drags him across the
text: counter, KNOCKING EVERYTHING to the floor...
text: Machine SWINGS Welles, releases him...
text: Welles SLAMS the refrigerator and slumps to the ground,
text: tries to stay conscious, trying weakly to get back up...
text: Machine comes to Welles, gets on his knees...
text: Machine wraps his arm around Welles' neck from behind, gets
text: him in a CHOKE HOLD, tightens his grip, cutting off Welles
text: airway with his forearm...
text: Welles tries to break Machine's impossible grip with one
text: hand, begins searching the floor with his other hand...
dialog: frantically feeling for anything he can use...
text: Welles' face is blood red...
text: Welles' hand grasps desperately... finds a FORK, grips it...
text: Welles SWINGS the fork back, STABS it into Machine's thigh!
text: Machine SCREAMS, releases Welles and falls back, reaching
dialog: around to the fork...
text: Welles gets to his knees, sucking air, turns to look...
text: Machine crawls away, pulls the fork out with trembling
text: fingers. Beyond him, there's the BASEMENT DOOR.
text: Welles gets to his feet, looking...
text: He grabs a FRYING PAN off the counter, gripping it in both
text: hands and moving towards Machine...
text: Machine's getting up...
text: Welles BASHES Machine in the face with an upward swing of
dialog: the frying pan...
text: Machine is sent backpedaling, CRASHING into the oven!
text: Welles drops the pan, leaps over Machine, to the door...
text: IN THE BASEMENT
text: Welles comes down the stairs, falls when he gets to the

text: Welles climbs onto Machine from behind, takes clothing line
text: in hand, starts wrapping the cord around Machine's throat...
text: Welles pulls back on the clothes line, pulling it tight...

text: pulling the clothes line with all his might...
