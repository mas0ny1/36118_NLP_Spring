speaker_heading: 3/9/99
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY 1
text: A tense surgery in progress. Meters flicker, instruments
text: flash in the bright overhead light. In the midst of it all
text: stands DR. DAVID RAVELL, 35. The master of his domain.
text: Ravell leans forward so a NURSE can mop the sweat from his
text: brow as he completes a last, delicate procedure. His co
text: workers sigh collectively with relief.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (to Asst. Surgeon)
dialog: Close her up, will you?
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY 2
text: Dr. Ravell comes out of surgery, clearly exhausted. Without
text: his surgical mask he is ruggedly handsome. TWO NURSES
text: follow, attending him like a fighter fresh from the ring:
text: CHLOE, 25, Raven-haired and striking, and JASMINE, 24, an
text: exotic mix of African-American and Asian.
text: BLAKE DANIELS, 58, the silver-haired Chief Surgeon, rushes up
text: the corridor. On his heels is DR. LONNIE WALSH, 33. Lonnie
text: is also conspicuously handsome, but he'll always be second to
dialog: David. In everything.
text: The look on Blake's face stops David in his tracks.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: There's been a train crash near Santa
text: Barbara. They're flying an aortal trauma
dialog: here now. How can I ask you this,
dialog: David...
text: David rubs his eyes. Thinks about it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I can do it, Blake.
text: His bravery isn't lost on the two nurses, although Chloe
text: exchanges a quick, covert glance with Lonnie.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Is he crazy, Jasmine? He's been on his
text: feet for fourteen hours.
speaker_heading: JASMINE
dialog: Chloe, it's been this way since Leslie
text: died. Losing himself in his work, poor
dialog: thing...
speaker_heading: YOUNGER MAN'S
speaker_heading: VOICE
speaker_heading: (O.S.)
dialog: I'll give you something to lose
dialog: yourself in...
speaker_heading: OLDER MAN'S VOICE
speaker_heading: (O.S.)
dialog: Excuse me, miss?
text: PULL BACK TO REVEAL: WE ARE LOOKING AT A TELEVISION SCREEN
text: BEHIND THE COUNTER OF A SMALL-TOWN DINER.
scene_heading: INSERT: FAIR OAKS, KANSAS
scene_heading: INT. TIP TOP DINER - DAY 3
text: Quaint, Midwestern eatery. Knick-knacks and photos abound.
text: The booths and counter are packed with LOCALS. A family
text: dining section off in one corner.
text: TWO GUYS sitting at the counter in team jackets. The older
text: of the two holds up his empty coffee cup. But his WAITRESS,
text: standing a couple seats down from him, doesn't move. She's
text: completely absorbed in watching the soap opera that plays on
text: two battered, fuzzy TV sets.
text: BETTY SIZEMORE, 30, has a wholesome attractiveness that
text: competes with a bit too much makeup and a cheesy white
text: waitress uniform. TWO OTHER WAITRESSES attend to customers
text: behind her.
text: The younger of the two guys is involved in the soap opera.
text: But the older one, still wants coffee. He gestures toward
dialog: Betty.
speaker_heading: OLDER MAN
dialog: Miss?
text: Betty leans forward, grabs the coffee pot and moves in front
text: of him. Without taking her eyes from the TV, she pours the
text: java, which somehow lands in his cup without spilling a drop.
speaker_heading: OLDER MAN
dialog: (cont'd)
dialog: very impressive. That is very...
dialog: (turning to others)
dialog: Did anybody see that?
text: The LOCAL GUYS around him don't even bother to look up. Of
text: course, they've seen it before. Betty smiles.
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: OLDER MAN
dialog: (cont'd)
dialog: Thank you. Could I bother you for a
dialog: little more...?
text: Before he can even finish, Betty is topping him off with
dialog: milk.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Skim, right?
dialog: (tears open an Equal)
dialog: And half a pack, if I remember correct...
text: The older gentleman's mouth works a bit but nothing comes
text: out. He is flabbergasted by her attention to detail. She
text: looks at the younger man, who is still following the show and
text: gobbling down a huge bacon burger.
speaker_heading: BETTY (cont'd)
dialog: You know, you're never too young to start
dialog: on a lean meat substitute...
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: You wanna try some turkey bacon on that?
speaker_heading: YOUNGER MAN
dialog: You want a tip when I'm through?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: It's your body...
text: Betty turns back to change pots. The older man watches her
text: intently as the younger of the two mumbles to himself.
speaker_heading: YOUNGER MAN
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: That's right, so why don't you get up off
dialog: it...
speaker_heading: OLDER MAN
dialog: Wesley...
dialog: (to Betty)
dialog: I've told him the same thing. Thanks for
dialog: the suggestion.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: No problem.
text: Betty flashes the men a winning smile and moves off, one eye
text: always on the TV as she approaches two local types.
text: SHERIFF ELDEN BALLARD, 32, a short, tightly wound little man,
text: sitting at his own booth. Ballard is spit and polish all the
text: way: creases in his shirt, a glossy shine on his shoes.
text: Badge proudly displayed. He sits with
text: ROY OSTREY, 31, a gangly, bookish local reporter. Betty
text: drops five ketchup packets and four mayonnaise packets on the
text: table for him. Another smile.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar,
dialog: but sweet. I liked your editorial this
dialog: morning...
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Oh, appreciate it. I was trying to, ahh,
dialog: give a sense of history to...
speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Yeah, it was great. Really put the whole
dialog: idea of "church bake sales" in
dialog: perspective...
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: You know, Elden, some people actually
dialog: read more than just the Classifieds...
speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: Why don't you go back to doing something
dialog: you're good at... like that Lonelyhearts
dialog: column?
dialog: (chuckles to himself)
dialog: I'll take a refill there, Betty...
text: His cup is full before he can even finish the sentence.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?
speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the
dialog: world safe.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I meant your food.
speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I thought you said the eggs weren't...
speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: It's fine. Mind your own meal...
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: You should get the order you want.
speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: And you should keep your nose out of
text: another man's omelette...
dialog: (to Betty)
dialog: It's no big deal, Betty.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: There's yolks in there, huh? It's no
dialog: prob'... gotta keep you on track.
text: Betty grabs Ballard's plate without another word, gives him a
text: reassuring rub on the shoulders and moves off. He smiles
text: appreciatively after her, then turns on Roy.
speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: Why you always gotta embarrass me? I
dialog: been eating lunch with you since grade
dialog: school and you always gotta embarrass me!
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: They're just eggs, Elden, how
dialog: embarrassing can eggs be?
speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: plenty
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: Mind your own business. You just said
dialog: that shit so you could look at her a
dialog: little longer, anyway...
text: Still carrying Ballard's plate, she returns to the counter.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Come on, guys, I told you it's egg whites
dialog: only for the Sheriff...
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I put him in that 'zone' thing.
speaker_heading: COOK #1
dialog: Well, it better be a pretty good size
dialog: zone if he's in it...
text: Betty and the cooks share a quick laugh. They move to change
text: his order while Betty glances up at the TV.
dialog: 6.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - RETURN TO TV SCREEN 4
text: Lonnie catches up to Blake in the corridor.
speaker_heading: LONNIE
dialog: Blake, I can handle that transplant!
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: We need someone with the right kind of
dialog: experience, Lonnie.
speaker_heading: LONNIE
text: Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why
dialog: don't you observe?
speaker_heading: LONNIE
dialog: I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh
text: out of medical school, Blake.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: No, you're not. You're a good doctor,
dialog: Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell.
dialog: I've made my decision. Now, if you'll
dialog: excuse me
text: Blake exits. The camera moves in to hold on a CLOSEUP of
text: Lonnie's face as he simmers in anger. Music soars.
scene_heading: INT. TIP TOP DINER - DAY 5
text: Plates of food are piling up on the shelf in front of the
text: COOKS. One of them turns the TV off by remote.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Hey! We were watching that!
speaker_heading: COOK #1
dialog: The other girls've got orders up... we're
dialog: not one 'a them goddamn Nelson families,
dialog: y'know.
text: Betty snatches up several plates to help out. Ballard's food
text: appears with A CLATTER of porcelain.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: It's "Nielson"...
speaker_heading: COOK #1
dialog: Yeah, well, we ain't one ‘a them,
dialog: neither.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Go on now...
speaker_heading: DARLENE
dialog: When you gonna get those things fixed,
dialog: anyhow?
speaker_heading: COOK #1
dialog: When you all quit watching ‘em for a
dialog: living...
text: Frustrated, Betty delivers several plates and drops them at
text: tables where the people know her by name. She moves off
text: toward FOUR LOCAL GUYS in a booth jangling their empty cups.
text: Betty weaves her way over to them and pours refills. When a
text: hand strays around to touch her ass, she pushes it away with
text: her foot and keeps right on pouring. Absently, Betty takes a
text: look around the restaurant. The other waitresses are gone
text: and no one is behind the grill. Alarmed, she pushes through
text: the double doors into the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. TIP TOP DINER - KITCHEN - SAME TIME 6
text: THREE WAITRESSES, along with the DISHWASHER and TWO COOKS are
text: standing in a row waiting for her.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: alright, I get it, no more TV.
dialog: Sorry.
text: No one moves, then DARLENE leads them in a huge SURPRISE!
text: They produce a life-size cardboard cut-out of Dr. David
text: Ravell, who looks dashing in his green hospital scrubs.
text: Betty backs up in disbelief.
speaker_heading: BETTY (cont'd)
dialog: Oh my gosh, this is so embarrassing!
dialog: Where did you ever find this?
speaker_heading: DARLENE
dialog: On the goddamn internet, where else?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: You're joking...
speaker_heading: WAITRESS #1
dialog: nope, got him at "T.V. Hunks with
dialog: Sweet Little Asses.Com."
speaker_heading: WAITRESS #2
dialog: Seventy-five dollars...
speaker_heading: COOK #1
dialog: Seventy-eight fifty.
dialog: (everyone looks at him)
dialog: Well, I paid for the damn thing, I oughta
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS #2
dialog: C'mon, Betty! Pose with him!
text: Betty laughs and puts her arm around the cardboard man. A
text: flash photo is taken. A cupcake with a single candle is
text: placed in her hands.
speaker_heading: DARLENE
dialog: One candle... uh-oh, you're getting up
dialog: there! Doesn't David like 'em young?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I'm over the hill, what can I say?
text: Darlene gives Betty an envelope with cash showing.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS #1
dialog: A little something for those nursing
dialog: classes you've been wanting to take...
speaker_heading: DARLENE
dialog: but keep putting off thanks to a
dialog: certain husband we won't mention...
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Oh, guys, you didn't have to do that!
speaker_heading: DARLENE
dialog: So how you gonna celebrate? Del takin'
dialog: you into Wichita for a big fancy dinner?
text: The others laugh; they know better. So does Betty.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Yeah, Dairy Queen, maybe... Oh, I should
dialog: probably call him. Thanks, you guys...
speaker_heading: COOK #1
dialog: Alright, alright, come on... I'm not
dialog: running no bed & breakfast, we got
dialog: customers. Let's go...
text: Smiling, Betty grabs a wall phone as the others mingle about.
scene_heading: INT. SIZEMORE MOTORS - DEL'S OFFICE - DAY 7
text: The trailer/office of a small-time car dealership. As the
text: PHONE RINGS, the CAMERA PANS across pictures of DEL SIZEMORE,
text: 35, dressed as Napoleon, Caesar and Abe Lincoln, arms raised
text: in a high-energy sales pitch.
text: The PHONE RINGS again. We see a framed certificate of
dialog: achievement from General Motors, dated 1986.
text: After the THIRD RING an ANSWERING MACHINE clicks on. It's
dialog: loud.
scene_heading: ANSWERING MACHINE
dialog: (Del's voice)
dialog: Hello there! You've reached Sizemore
dialog: Motors, home of the best selection of
dialog: used General Motors cars in the Big
dialog: Springs - Fair Oaks area. We can't come
dialog: to the phone right now 'cause we're out
dialog: making a sale, so leave us a message;
dialog: better yet, come on down and steal one 'a
dialog: these beauties right out from under us!
dialog: Coffee's always on!
speaker_heading: BETTY (V.0.)
dialog: Hi Del, it's me. I guess you're busy.
scene_heading: INT. SIZEMORE MOTORS - TRAILER/OFFICE - DAY 8
text: Del's very busy. He's on the rented sofa in the trailer's
text: lounge, screwing his secretary, JOYCE. But as he rocks the
text: couch, he's listening to Betty's message.
speaker_heading: BETTY (V.0.)
dialog: I know you want the Oldsmobile back
dialog: tonight, so... I was wondering if I could
text: take one of the new Buicks.
text: Del pulls out and lurches across the room. He reaches for
text: the desk phone but misses, spilling down onto the carpet. He
text: gathers himself and his pants up in disgust, pawing around
text: the desktop until he finds the phone.
speaker_heading: BETTY (V.0.)
speaker_heading: (CONT'D)
dialog: So, call me when you--
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second
dialog: there, baby. Why do you need one of the
dialog: new Buicks?
speaker_heading: BETTY (V.0.)
dialog: Oh, you're there. You sound out of
dialog: breath.
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: I ran back in to get the phone.
dialog: 10.
text: The answering machine is on, so their VOICES are BOOMING. The
text: phone cord is stretched across the trailer as he tries to get
text: back to Joyce. He motions for her to join him but she
text: remains where she is, fuming.
speaker_heading: BETTY (V.0.)
dialog: I don't need one, but it's kind of a
dialog: special night, and--
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: What's so special about it?
text: LONG PAUSE. Joyce looks at Del, incredulous. Then pissed off.
text: He signals to hold on.
speaker_heading: BETTY (V.0.)
dialog: Sue Ann's taking me out and I thought it
dialog: might be fun to go in a nice car...
text: Joyce wriggles to a sitting position and begins to pull up
text: her panties. Del shoots her a look that says 'I'm not
text: finished yet!' They pantomime frantically back and forth
text: until Joyce throws him the finger and SLAMS out the door.
speaker_heading: BETTY (V.0)
speaker_heading: (CONT'D)
dialog: What was that?
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: Nothing... it's, ahh, busy here. Look,
dialog: you don't need a LeSabre to go out with
dialog: Sue Ann. Take the blue Corsica. I'll
dialog: see you when I get home.
text: He throws the phone onto the cradle, then bangs on a window
text: to get Joyce's attention as she fires up a smoke.
speaker_heading: DEL (CONT'D)
dialog: (through the pane)
dialog: Shit! Joyce, open the damn gate, will
dialog: you?!
text: As Del zips up his pants Joyce trudges across the lot to
text: bring in the "Closed For Lunch" sign and open the gate. Del
text: silently studies the much nicer car lot next door for a
text: moment. He takes in the banners, the signs, etc.
speaker_heading: DEL (cont'd)
dialog: that's what we need, some goddamn
dialog: flags.
dialog: 11.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE/TRAILER - LATER 9
text: Betty enters the office. Joyce is on the phone. She looks
text: up, irritated, and says something under her breath to the
dialog: caller.
speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: Uhh, no, we haven't picked a date yet...
dialog: well, once he dumps her we will.
dialog: (to Betty)
dialog: He's out pricing banners... I don't
dialog: expect him back.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: "Banners?"
speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: You know, flags and shit... he said "for
dialog: a livelier look" or something.
text: Betty nods and swaps her car keys for a set Joyce gives her.
speaker_heading: JOYCE (cont'd)
dialog: "S too bad about the LeSabres... they're
dialog: a really sweet ride.
text: As Joyce prattles on, Betty notices the Buick LeSabre keys on
text: a rack behind her. She sidles around Joyce, deftly removes a
text: set from the hook and drops them in her purse. She smiles
text: and starts to wave goodbye as Joyce puts her call on hold.
dialog: 10
speaker_heading: JOYCE (cont'd)
dialog: Need something else?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: No, I was just... How you doing?
speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: Great. Good. Content...
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Oh. How come?
speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: How's things at the Tip Top?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: They're fine... you miss it?
speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: You must be joking.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Hmm.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: So, Del get that car he sold you up and
dialog: running yet?
speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running,
dialog: alright...
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: ‘Kay, good. Bye, then...
speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: Uh-huh.
dialog: (back to phone)
dialog: Anyway, I'm thinking Easter, 'cause I
dialog: just fucking love pastels.
text: She whispers, then laughs loudly as Betty leaves.
scene_heading: EXT. SIZEMORE MOTORS - DAY 10
text: The cardboard doctor is standing next to Betty's Olds. She
text: thinks about leaving him, but picks him up and tosses him
text: into a blue Corsica. He lands with his face against the
text: passenger window.
dialog: 11
dialog: 12
dialog: 13
dialog: 14
text: She stands for a moment by the Corsica, dangling the LeSabre
text: keys before her eyes. Suddenly, she jumps inside the
text: Chevrolet and slams the door.
scene_heading: EXT. SIZEMORE MOTORS/TRAILER PARK - DAY 11
text: The blue Corsica leaves the parking lot and pulls onto the
text: street. The car makes an abrupt turn into a trailer park
text: directly behind the car lot and glides to a halt behind a row
text: of battered airstreams.
text: Betty gets outs of the Chevy and looks back: the handsome
text: face of Doctor David Ravell is staring at her from the car.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Oh, Christ, what am I gonna do with you?
text: She goes back to pick him up, then starts off.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAILER PARK - SAME TIME 12
text: A row of cheap trailers on both sides of a crumbling
text: driveway. Betty appears with her cardboard man tucked under
text: one arm and then disappears behind a pickup truck.
dialog: 13.
scene_heading: EXT. SIZEMORE MOTORS - SAME TIME 13
text: She tosses the cardboard "David" over a concrete slab wall,
text: climbs over herself and walks straight to the LeSabres. Her
text: key opens the last one - maroon. She puts the doctor on the
text: passenger seat, gets in the car and inhales the new car
dialog: smell.
text: Joyce can be seen inside the trailer, still talking on the
text: phone. She misses the whole scene as she works on her nails.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: We deserve this.
scene_heading: INT. LESABRE - DRIVING - DAY 14
text: Betty has the car at 75 m.p.h., on the rural Kansas roads,
text: wheat fields for miles on both sides of her. The RADIO is
text: blasting Bonnie Raitt and she's singing along.
text: She sees her speed and punches the accelerator ... 80 m.p.h.
dialog: 15
dialog: 16
text: 85 ... 90 m.p.h. She turns the radio up louder.
text: When she approaches a sign saying "You are leaving Kansas"
text: Betty suddenly becomes self-conscious. She eases up on the
text: gas ... slows down ... does a U-turn and heads back toward
text: Fair Oaks. She glances wistfully in her rear view mirror at
text: the billboard that quickly fades into the distance.
scene_heading: EXT. BETTY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - LATER 15
text: Betty enters a modest residential neighborhood and pulls into
text: a driveway. She parks in a detached garage and looks over at
text: the cardboard David. There's no way he's going in the house.
text: She puts him in the trunk and closes the garage door.
scene_heading: EXT. SUE ANN'S HOUSE - SAME TIME 16
text: She walks several houses down. On her way to the door we
text: hear a DOG BARKING, CHILDREN and GENERAL COMMOTION from
text: inside. SUE ANN ROGERS answers Betty's knock. Her hair is
text: matted with sweat as she struggles with CHILDREN, ages 4, 3
text: and 6 months. Suddenly, Sue Ann is hit by an errant rubber
dialog: ball.
speaker_heading: SUE ANN
dialog: Hey, darling... oww! Sorry, got my own
dialog: little Gulf War going on here.
text: Betty takes the baby as Sue Ann pulls a videotape from a
dialog: shelf. It's all one move; they do this every day.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Did you watch it yet?
speaker_heading: SUE ANN
dialog: Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was
dialog: any better looking it'd be a crime 'a
dialog: some sort...
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight.
dialog: We're going to the Starlite in style!
speaker_heading: SUE ANN
dialog: Oh, Betty--
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up
dialog: your eyes a bit it looks just like a
dialog: Jaguar...
speaker_heading: SUE ANN
dialog: Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call
dialog: you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge
dialog: meeting. There's no way I can get a
dialog: sitter this fast.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: No... what about your sister?
speaker_heading: SUE ANN
dialog: I can't ask her again-- Nathan, stop it!
dialog: Jesse, don't take that, hit back!-- I
dialog: feel terrible, hon.
text: After a beat
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: It's all right.
speaker_heading: SUE ANN
dialog: You sure? Maybe next week we could...
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Uh-huh. No, we'll do it later. 'S only
dialog: a birthday, right? I'll have another one
dialog: next year...
text: Betty forces a smile, kisses the baby and hands it back to
text: Sue Ann, who hands her the videotape.
speaker_heading: SUE ANN
dialog: Aahbh...
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: So what color is it?
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SUE ANN
dialog: The LeSabre!
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Maroon.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I stole it.
speaker_heading: SUE ANN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: He wasn't going to let us use it, so I
dialog: just took it.
dialog: 17
speaker_heading: SUE ANN
dialog: Oh, I wish we could just get in it and
dialog: drive, and drive, and drive!
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Yeah, me too.
speaker_heading: SUE ANN
dialog: Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I gotta go make dinner.
text: Betty throws her a look as Sue Ann closes the door. Betty
text: turns around, frustrated. She starts yanking her apron off
text: as she crosses the street.
scene_heading: INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DAY 17
text: A low-end ranch. A worn-out sofa and loveseat form an 'L'
text: that dominates the living room. Romance novels line a small
text: bookcase. SIX CANARIES in cages chatter away in the kitchen.
text: Del sits at the dining room table, agitated. He is presently
text: attacking a pork chop, baked beans and a loaf of Wonderbread.
text: All we hear is A FORK CLICKING and BIRDS CHIRPING. Betty
text: stands at the breakfast counter, barefoot, still in her
text: uniform and quietly eating a salad.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Sure you don't want any salad?
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: No, I do not want any goddamn... what was
dialog: all that shit on the phone about the new
dialog: Buicks?
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me
dialog: out tonight, but...
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S
dialog: got air and leather...
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: All right, then. Actually, I'm glad
dialog: you're going out. I got something going
dialog: on tonight. Some serious clients, with
dialog: real potential.
text: Del BELCHES, smiles, then CLUCKS at the birds nearby.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: like the water purifiers?
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Or the vitamins? Or the...?
text: Del almost comes out of his chair, pointing his finger at
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they
dialog: changed the law, and you know it!
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some
dialog: dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress,
dialog: what do you got?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I got you, Del...
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: well, then you ain't got much.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Oh, I know.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: So, who're these clients?
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: Couple 'a guys in from outta town. They
dialog: want to see the new LeSabres.
text: Betty hides her reaction.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: DEL (cont'd)
dialog: And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around

dialog: Just knock it off, ‘kay? Anyhow, they're

speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: They're new to us...
text: Truce for a moment. Del plucks a copy of Soap Opera Guide
dialog: 18
text: from Betty's purse while absently taking a bite from Betty's
text: cupcake. He narrowly misses the candle.
speaker_heading: DEL (cont'd)
dialog: Jesus... you know these actors are mainly
dialog: models, which are mainly fags. They've
dialog: done studies. The rest're assholes. But
dialog: you know what bugs me most about these
dialog: soaps?
text: She silently mimics him as he says...
speaker_heading: DEL (cont'd)
dialog: It's people with no lives watching other
dialog: people's fake lives.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Yeah, I guess there's nothing like
dialog: watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: That is a skill!
text: Del lurches to his feet and crosses to the bird cages as the
text: canaries CHIRP and SING EXCITEDLY at his approach.
speaker_heading: DEL (cont'd)
dialog: Daddy's here, babies... daddy's here.
dialog: (to Betty)
dialog: Be back later... clean up.
text: He exits. She collects his dirty dishes, puts them in the
text: sink and starts to wash them. Then she stops.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: What the hell am I doing?
text: She drops the dishes with a clatter, pours herself a glass of
text: wine, lights the candle on her deflowered cupcake and opens
text: the one card on the table.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON
dialog: 18.
text: a traditional greeting from her grandparents. Red hearts and
text: lace. A color photo of them enclosed.
text: Betty smiles at this. After moment, she quietly sings a
text: quick refrain of "Happy Birthday" to herself.

speaker_heading: LONNIE

speaker_heading: CHLOE

scene_heading: INT. WOODED ROADSIDE - NIGHT (ON TV SCREEN) 20
text: Chloe's magnificent legs are folded into the seat of David's
text: 560 SL. She struggles with her seatbelt, so he helps her.
text: She makes sure their hands touch.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Thanks for pulling over, David... I can't
dialog: go that fast without taking a breather.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Sorry... it's nice to see what this
dialog: little beauty can do, though. I guess,
dialog: somehow, all that speed helps me forget
dialog: the past...
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: I'm sure it does...
dialog: (touching the seats)
dialog: Mmm, leather. How far do they recline?
text: David smiles, a little uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: CHLOE (cont'd)
dialog: Listen, David, I know I've said it
dialog: 21
dialog: 22
dialog: before, but I want to tell you again how
dialog: sorry I am about your wife.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: It must make you scared to get close to
dialog: someone again.
text: She puts her hand over his on the gear shift. A moment.
text: Finally, he has to move her fingers to start the car.
speaker_heading: CHLOE (cont'd)
dialog: Let's not go... not yet.
text: BETTY sits on an old couch in the den and watches, eyes glued

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Damn!
text: She hits PAUSE and crosses to look out.
scene_heading: EXT. BETTY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 21
text: Del gets out of a black Lincoln Town Car, followed by CHARLIE
text: and WESLEY - the guys in the team jackets from the diner.
text: Charlie is 63 years old. He wears a dress shirt, slacks and
text: docksiders. The suburban father look.
text: Wesley is 28. He's in jeans, T-shirt and white Reeboks. Clean
dialog: cut; the kid who used to mow your parents’ lawn.
text: Betty quickly snaps out the light and closes the door until
text: it is open only a crack.
scene_heading: INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 22
text: Del swaggers into the house. The two men follow politely.
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: you can have the best damn running
dialog: backs in the world, somebody's still
dialog: gotta block for ‘em.
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You're a hundred percent right. They
dialog: rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...
text: Del stops and looks around, deflated by the mess.
text: The den is only a short flight of steps from the living room
text: and the kitchen. Betty has a clean view of both from where
text: she sits on the couch.
scene_heading: 23 INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DEN - NIGHT 23
text: She hears Del come in, but doesn't take her eyes off the TV
dialog: screen.
speaker_heading: DEL (0.S.)
dialog: My apologies, gentlemen. I asked my wife
dialog: to straighten this shit up before she
dialog: went out.
scene_heading: 23A INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 23A
text: Del crosses to an old stereo and puts on an LP. He smiles as
text: the music overtakes the room. Charlie and Wesley stand
text: nearby, appreciating the quaintness of the surroundings.
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: Now, what can I get you gentlemen to
dialog: drink?
text: Del crosses to the cupboard. Charlie and Wesley stand
text: leisurely in the living room.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Bourbon, little water, thank you.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Beer, please.
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: You got it.
text: Wesley looks at a wedding portrait of Del and Betty.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Hey... you got a fine one right here!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Wesley...
dialog: (to Del)
dialog: Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I
dialog: seen her before?
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh, yes, with the coffee...
speaker_heading: DEL
text: Yep, Betty pours a pretty mean cup.
text: Del reaches into the fridge and produces a Miller for Wesley,
text: then mixes two drinks and walks into the dining room and
text: Charlie and Wesley follow to the table and sit down.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I like this. I like doing business in
dialog: the home. It's cozy...
dialog: (noticing the card and cupcake)
dialog: Who's birthday?
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: Ahh... my wife's.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: What'd you get her?
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: Huh? Oh, umm, a car.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: So, to a successful transaction...
text: They raise their glasses and drink. Del tosses back his
text: drink in one gulp.
scene_heading: 24 INT. DAVID'S CAR - WOODED ROADSIDE - (ON TV SCREEN) 24
text: Chloe is on top of David, kissing him on the mouth as he
text: resists. He finally has to push her away forcibly, and we
text: hear a TEARING SOUND. Chloe's blouse has been ripped.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm sorry, Chloe.
text: She starts to cry. David reaches out to comfort her.
speaker_heading: DAVID (cont'd)
dialog: It's not that I don't find you
dialog: attractive. I'm just not ready...
text: David looks up to find her lips on his. In spite of himself,
text: he gives in to the warmth of her kiss and responds hungrily.
text: Betty is mesmerized.
dialog: 22.
scene_heading: 25 INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT 25
text: The men have retired into the dining room, sitting or
text: standing around a worn wooded table. Charlie and Wesley are
text: just finishing their drinks.
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: All right gentlemen, let's get down to
dialog: it. I need to know if you're for real.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: If we're for real?
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: You don't exactly look like drug dealers.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Isn't that the point?
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw
dialog: around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston
dialog: and Vegas who are ready to snap this
dialog: stuff up.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: We appreciate that. But you just poured
dialog: me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your
text: hospitality for a few minutes.
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: Fine. You got five...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It's a nice place you got here. Real
dialog: comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair
dialog: Oaks. You like it here?
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Are you kidding me? What's to like?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Seems like a nice place.
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: It is, if you like idiots...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: It's a small town, man. I never should
dialog: have left Omaha. People here think
dialog: 23.
dialog: small. They act small. They're a bunch
dialog: of dumb fucks.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: You better believe it.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Could you give us an example?
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: Of what?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm asking you for an example of one of
dialog: these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: I don't follow...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: (warily)
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I didn't think so. So, give me an
dialog: example of a stupid person doing a stupid
dialog: thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped
dialog: to recognize it.
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: Are we gonna do business here, or not?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Relax, we brought the cash.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm just curious. Can't you give me an
dialog: example?
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: All right ... lemme see ... okay, new
dialog: Burger King opens up. These assholes get
text: excited and start lining up. Like it's
text: some five star restaurant. The place is
dialog: mobbed. Right?
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hmmmm. "Five Stars," huh?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Is that stupid, Wesley?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: No, that's ignorant. They just don't
dialog: know any better.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That's what I thought.
dialog: (to Del)
dialog: You better give me another example.
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: This is bullshit, can we get down to
dialog: business here, please?
text: Off a look from Charlie, Wesley produces a pistol and gently
text: nudges the barrel into Del's ear.
speaker_heading: DEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus Christ!
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: He's waiting...
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: "Tnjuns?"
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You did not just say "Injuns," Del.
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're
dialog: always drunk and doing stupid things.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: DEL
text: Driving their cars into trees... puking
dialog: on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Let's see... around here that would be
dialog: Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not
dialog: mistaken.
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: I... I don't know...
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Well, my idea of stupid is very different
dialog: from yours.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: So here's how this is gonna work. Would
dialog: you take your socks off, please?
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: My socks?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: You heard the man.
text: Del slowly takes his shoes and socks off. He's sweating,
text: trembling.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm gonna talk to you and when I'm
dialog: finished, you can answer. But I don't
dialog: like being interrupted. Now roll them
dialog: into a ball...
dialog: Del does it.
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: and put them in your mouth.
text: At a sharp look from Charlie, Del obediently stuffs the socks
text: into his mouth and starts to cry. Wesley produces a roll of
text: duct tape and fastens Del's hands to the back of his chair.
scene_heading: 26 INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DEN - NIGHT 26
text: Betty is glued to the TV, oblivious to the men. Chloe and
text: David are still talking in his car. She continues to cry.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (v.0.)
dialog: You're wonderful, Chloe, you are... But I
dialog: just know there's something special out
dialog: there for me.
scene_heading: 27 INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT 27
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Now I'm gonna tell you what stupid is.
dialog: Stupid is taking something that doesn't
dialog: belong to you. Right Wesley?
dialog: 26.
dialog: Del nods;
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Stupid is trying to sell it to other
dialog: people who are, by their very nature,
dialog: untrustworthy.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: That is so right.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Stupid is calling people in Kansas City
dialog: who are affiliated with the rightful
dialog: owners of the thing you stole, and trying
dialog: to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Now, that's really stupid.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So you see, we have totally different
dialog: ideas of what's stupid and what's not.
dialog: Don't we?
text: crying, sweating.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (cont'd)
dialog: Good. Now we're getting somewhere. You
dialog: agree that you were stupid?
text: Del nods again. Wesley collects Charlie's glass and mixes
text: him another drink. He gets a beer for himself and stands
text: behind Del. Charlie sips his drink slowly, savoring it.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (cont'd)
dialog: You know, a hundred and fifty years ago
dialog: you'd have been scalped for that remark
dialog: about Native Americans. Right here where
dialog: your house is - you'd have been scalped.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Hell of a way to die.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It wasn't always fatal, Wesley. We could
dialog: scalp Del right now, and he'd be plenty
dialog: alive to tell us how it feels.
text: Del's eyes get huge.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: It's pretty simple, too.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: 27.
dialog: 28
dialog: First you take a knife and just draw a
text: mark right across the hairline.
text: Wesley produces a long knife and traces a line across the
text: very top of Del's forehead. Trickles of blood wind their way
text: down his brow. Del is MOANING and PANTING through his socks.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (cont'd)
dialog: Hold still, Del, we're just talking
dialog: here...
dialog: (pointing to a spot)
dialog: Then you grab a big handful of hair and
dialog: pull as you cut. It's amazing how easily
text: the scalp comes off.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: A mark, huh?
text: Wesley takes a jab at Del's forehead with his knife, leaving
text: a small cut.
text: Del starts twitching, rocking back and forth as Wesley grabs
text: a fistful of his hair.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (cont'd)
dialog: Shut the fuck up! I bleed more than that
dialog: when I shave...
text: Del stops moving. He breathes furiously through his nostrils.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Now. I want to know the particulars of
dialog: your stupid act: how you got what
dialog: doesn't belong to you, who helped you get
dialog: it, and of course, where it is now.
text: Charlie pulls the socks out of Del's mouth. Del splutters,
text: gasping for air.
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: It's in the Buick! I swear to God it's
dialog: all there!
scene_heading: INT. BLAKE DANIELS' OFFICE - DAY (ON TV SCREEN) 28
text: David enters. Blake nods to him grimly.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You wanted to see me, Blake?
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: I wish I could say I had good news.
dialog: (off David's look)
dialog: David, I'll get right to the point.
dialog: 29
dialog: Chloe Jensen has filed charges of sexual
dialog: 28.
dialog: assault against you.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: You can continue to practice at L.A.
dialog: County, but I'm afraid I have to revoke
dialog: your privileges here at Loma Vista until
dialog: this is resolved.
text: HOLD on David's shocked expression ... MUSIC UP AS
speaker_heading: DEL (0.S.)
dialog: PLEASE DON'T KILL ME!!!
text: Betty's not sure what Del said, but the panic in his voice
text: got through. She hits PAUSE and takes a look.
scene_heading: INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT 29
text: Del is facing her, tiny rivulets of blood running into his
text: terrified eyes. Wesley stands at his shoulder, still holding
text: a handful of his hair, still poised with the knife.
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: I got it from a truck driver named Duane
dialog: Cooley, out of Amarillo. He brings my
dialog: cars down from Detroit. But I haven't
dialog: touched it, I swear to you... Please!
dialog: Please! Please!
text: Annoyed, Charlie stuffs the socks back in Del's mouth.
text: Betty stares. Her gaze shifts from Del to Wesley, drawn by
text: Wesley's demonic expression.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Consider yourself lucky. Luckier than
dialog: those 'Injuns' you have such contempt
dialog: for.
text: Wesley stares at the top of Del's head. Betty stares at
text: Wesley. Charlie walks into the kitchen for another drink.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (cont'd)
dialog: I'll tell you, if anyone got a raw deal
dialog: it's the American Indian. This country
dialog: has a black mark on its soul for what was
dialog: done to them.
text: Wesley's nostrils flare. Betty leans forward.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (cont'd)
dialog: I'm all for them owning casinos, getting
dialog: 30
dialog: 31
dialog: rich off the white man's greed. It's a
dialog: beautiful piece of irony, isn't it,
dialog: Wesley?
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: IT SURE IS!!
text: And with a long SCREAM, Wesley rips Del's scalp from his
text: head. It makes a sickening sound like fabric tearing. For a
text: long moment, there is only silence. An eerie silence.
text: Suddenly, Del SCREAMS into his socks and thrashes in his
text: seat, blood pouring down his head on all sides.
text: Somehow, he manages to get to his feet, the chair still taped
text: to him, and begins smashing into whatever is near. Blood
text: flies and curios shatter as Del thunders through the room. A
dialog: dying bull, only messier. It's quite a show.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: JESUS CHRIST!!!
text: Wesley steps back, staring at the dripping scalp in his hand,
text: as if wondering how it got there. Betty is transfixed,
text: horrified.
text: Charlie re-enters. The two men look at each other over Del's
text: MUFFLED SCREAMS as he plows headlong into wooden paneling, a
text: china cabinet, and finally, back toward them near the
text: breakfast counter. Del bashes blindly into it.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (cont'd)
dialog: (to Wesley)
dialog: What the fuck is the matter with you?!
text: Wesley is practically foaming at the mouth, still rushing on
text: what he did. Charlie draws a silenced pistol and mercifully
text: SHOOTS Del through the head. The big man stops suddenly,
text: blinks once or twice, topples over.
scene_heading: INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DEN - NIGHT 30
text: Betty points her remote at the dining room and clicks it, as
text: if trying to make the image disappear. Finally, she gives
text: up, slowly turning away from the carnage and aims at the TV.
text: "A Reason to Love" pauses on the face of David Ravell and
text: Betty sits in absolute silence.
scene_heading: INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT 31
dialog: 32
dialog: 33
text: Charlie quickly begins to hide their tracks, producing a
text: plastic baggie and collecting the beer cans and his own
dialog: glass.
text: He also wipes down the fridge as Wesley watches.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Are you out of your mind? You scalped
dialog: him!
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: You told me how to do it!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That was to get him to talk!
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Get rid of that thing, will you?
text: Wesley crosses to the garbage can, steps on the lever. He
text: looks at the scalp one more time before dropping it in.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: This is great - just great! Now we don't
dialog: know where the goddamn stuff is.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: He told us it's in the Buick.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: We don't know which Buick, do we?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Well, why'd you shoot him?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I had to shoot him! It was the only
dialog: decent thing to do.
text: They exit the house.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (0.S.) (cont'd)
dialog: This is very unprofessional, Wesley.
scene_heading: INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DEN - NIGHT 32
text: Betty is still in the family room, staring at the TV. She
dialog: pushes
text: ‘play' again and David Ravell begins to speak.
scene_heading: EXT. SUE ANN'S HOUSE - STREET - LATER 33
text: Sue Ann comes out of her house, balancing a homemade cake in
text: front of her. The candles give off an unearthly glow as she

text: picks her way up the Sizemore's gravel drive.
scene_heading: INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DEN - SAME TIME 34

speaker_heading: DEPUTY
dialog: Hang on there, Roy. Nobody comes in.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Elden called me. He wants to, ahh, make
dialog: a statement for the paper...
text: The deputy nods him through and Roy moves off toward the

scene_heading: INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - SEWING ROOM - SAME TIME 36
text: Betty is packing an overnight bag on her bed when Roy enters
text: and quietly closes the door behind him. She is working with
text: a purpose, almost like a different person from the woman we

speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I'm great, good, content.
dialog: (stopping)
dialog: What happened to your arm, Roy?
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Make sure it's elevated...
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: You want me to make you a sling? It's no

speaker_heading: BETTY (cont'd)
dialog: What're you doing here, Roy?
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Well, I was worried about you and I
dialog: wanted to make sure you were alright...
dialog: and I guess I was sort of hoping I could

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing.

speaker_heading: ROY

speaker_heading: BETTY

speaker_heading: ROY

speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: She knows who killed Del. Elden, she
dialog: said it was a woman.
speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: It wasn't a woman.
speaker_heading: ROY

speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: You think a woman did that?!
text: Roy runs into the kitchen, covering his mouth.
scene_heading: INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 39
text: Ballard and his cronies delight in watching Roy struggle with

speaker_heading: BALLARD
text: Kinda’ looks like a burnt out roman
dialog: candle, don't he?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Del must've sold a lemon to the wrong

speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: So, you think you're gonna find his scalp

speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: They no longer live in tepees, Mr.

speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Did you send anyone out there?
speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: You bet I did. I got a squad car on the

speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Bad idea
speaker_heading: BALLARD

speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: I still don't understand how you knew Del
dialog: was telling the truth.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: I saw his soul Wesley. He was face to

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Never abandon you instincts.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: I didn't. You gave me a look!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What 'look'?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: That one look you got! I thought you
dialog: were done, so I took him out...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing
dialog: him whine. And you didn't take him out,
dialog: you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked,
dialog: did I tell you that?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian
dialog: story?
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What the hell does that mean? If I'd
dialog: told a Ty Cobb story would you have

text: Wesley is stung. Charlie slams the last trunk in disgust.
text: The rest remain where they are; open.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (cont'd)
dialog: It's not here. Let's go.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: You just gonna leave these cars sitting

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Why not, it'll confuse ‘em... gotta do
dialog: something, now that you fucked it up.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: I wanted to make a statement.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Let me tell you something. In our
dialog: business you can't put food on the table
dialog: if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who
dialog: get the calls are good - not flashy, just
dialog: good. They get in, they get out. Nobody
dialog: knows a goddamn thing. Understand?
text: Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and
dialog: you know they're dead.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: that's a good motto.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Sort of...but he ignored them.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: And how did that make you feel, Betty?

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I felt all cold inside. And angry.
text: Ballard looks both ways to make sure he won't be overheard.
speaker_heading: BALLARD

speaker_heading: ROY

speaker_heading: BALLARD

speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: Junior year!
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Anyway, so what?
speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: So? ... Suppose Betty found out about
dialog: them?
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: You said a woman couldn't have done it.
speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: A woman can write a check.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: So you're saying Betty Sizemore - our
dialog: Betty Sizemore--who you were in swing
dialog: choir with--has now hired somebody to
text: scalp her husband in her own kitchen
dialog: while she watched? You're amazing.
speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: 'S just a theory...just 'cause I'm

text: The doctor comes out of the holding room.
speaker_heading: BALLARD (cont'd)
dialog: How is she?
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
text: She's in a kind of shock. I see all the
text: signs of a post-traumatic reaction with
text: possible dissociative symptoms.
speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: Could I have that in American?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: It's a type of altered state...it allows

dialog: functioning.
speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: So she did witness it?
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: That's it! YOU'RE GONE!

speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Oww, the arm, the arm!
speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: You just don't know when to quit, Roy!
dialog: You were jealous of me when I got hall

speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: One question, Doctor, please! (outside

speaker_heading: BALLARD

text: behind him, leaning in to listen. Ballard doesn't see him.
speaker_heading: BALLARD (cont'd)
dialog: Sorry you had to see that. You were
dialog: saying?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: I was saying that it seems probable that
dialog: she witnessed the murder, but her memory
dialog: of it is gone, at least for the time
dialog: being. I also think you ought to have her

dialog: stay with someone tonight.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: No... Friends from the diner maybe?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Well, you should find out. She keeps

speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: So you got Asian women?
speaker_heading: DUANE
dialog: (Southern accent)
dialog: Sure, I got Asian. Got black, white, any

dialog: fat chicks and animals too, if you want
dialog: ‘em. They're extra...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck
dialog: running into you, Duane. I thought I was
dialog: 42.
dialog: gonna have to take Wesley out and hose
dialog: him down. All he talks about is those
dialog: Japanese gals.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: I like ‘em small. When you're inside a
dialog: little Asian chick, it's like your dick
text: is the axle that holds her body together.
speaker_heading: DUANE
dialog: That's nicely put. You outta get
dialog: yourself to Thailand...
text: They reach Duane's truck, an empty car-carrier with Michigan

scene_heading: INT. DUANE'S TRUCK - DAY 51
text: Two Confederate flags criss-cross over Duane's CB unit. On
text: the dashboard is a Rebel flag pin, a bumper sticker that says
text: "The South Will Rise Again" and a dozen country music tapes.
text: Duane gets in the sleeper cab, where stacks of porno tapes
text: and magazines reach the ceiling. Wesley takes the driver's
text: seat, Charlie, the passenger seat.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
speaker_heading: DUANE
dialog: Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's

speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: We can live with that.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
text: Duane passes two videos to Wesley.

dialog: (laughs)
dialog: They're Korean, so they're pretty hot.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You know, it's interesting. The South

speaker_heading: DUANE
dialog: Huh?
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
speaker_heading: DUANE

text: A telltale piece of Confederate red fabric hangs out of his
text: mouth. There is a purplish bruise on his forehead. He's
text: quiet, but glowering at his captors.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: So, at a rest stop outside Logansport
dialog: you noticed that two guys were slipping
dialog: something extra in one of your cars, and
dialog: you decided to see what it was. Then you
dialog: figured you'd take this valuable
dialog: commodity and go into business yourself,
dialog: even though it didn't belong to you. But
dialog: you needed a crackerjack salesman to move
dialog: it, so you made the biggest mistake of
dialog: your short life and chose Del. Sound
dialog: right so far?
text: Duane nods.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (cont'd)
dialog: Del's dead, by the way. I sent him to
dialog: the Great Beyond.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Actually, I scalped him, and then you
dialog: killed him.
text: Duane narrows his eyes in disbelief.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Now, the one thing I don't get is that we
dialog: checked all the Buicks on that lot. Four
dialog: '97 LeSabres and nothing in 'em.
text: Duane smiles mockingly.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ohhh ... There weren't four, were there?

speaker_heading: CHARLIE (cont'd)
dialog: There were five, damn it! I should have
dialog: known! ! Goddamn...
speaker_heading: (BEAT)

speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: You know you're going to die, don't you,
dialog: Duane?
dialog: (Duane nods)
dialog: And you really don't know where that
dialog: other LeSabre is, do you?
text: Duane shakes his head. Charlie sighs, resigned.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (cont'd)
text: He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Should I kill him now?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Wait. Any last words, General Lee?
dialog: 54
text: Duane nods emphatically. Wesley pulls the Confederate flags
text: out of his mouth.
speaker_heading: DUANE
dialog: Suck my dick, you Yankee piece of shit.
text: He spits in Wesley's face. Charlie has to restrain Wesley.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: God, I admire that. Ya see that, Wesley?
dialog: That's why they get all the glory.
text: Charlie climbs down from the big rig and heads across the
text: parking lot. The Town Car is parked near the adjacent motel,
text: just a few spaces away from Betty's LeSabre.
text: With a furious calm Wesley wipes his face, then takes out a
text: can of lighter fluid, sets it on the dash and looks at Duane.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: ..why'd you spit on me?
scene_heading: EXT. TRUCK STOP/MOTEL PARKING LOT - DUSK 54

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Come on, Wesley, three shots.
text: A FLASH OF ORANGE FLAME ignites inside Duane's cab. Charlie
text: sighs. Finally, THREE DULL THUDS reverberate from inside.

dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (cont'd)
dialog: What the hell was that, another
dialog: statement?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Well, no one ever spit in my face before.
dialog: Especially some cracker fuck.

text: Betty checks her monitors as the opening credits of "A Reason
text: to Love" begin to play.
text: She glances up at the doorway at the same moment and sees Dr.
text: David Ravell standing at the entrance. He checks the chart
text: on the door, smiles warmly at Betty and then moves off. Ina
text: flash, Betty is up and after him.
text: The THEME MUSIC is her private soundtrack as she checks out
text: every man in surgical scrubs, looking for David Ravell.
text: Then... She sees him. In all his glory at the end of a
dialog: 86
dialog: 87
text: corridor walking away from her. Betty gives chase. She
text: gains steadily on him, her heart racing. As they near
text: Emergency the NOISE LEVEL picks up.
text: He stops at the nurses' station. Betty closes the gap. She
text: starts to run.
speaker_heading: BETTY (CONT'D)
dialog: DAVID!!!
dialog: 68.
text: He turns to face her ... It's not David Ravell.
speaker_heading: BETTY (cont'd)
dialog: Sorry, I thought you were someone else.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Do you know Dr. David Ravell?
text: The man shakes his head. Betty keeps going, looking around:
dialog: it's incredible - the size, the activity, the intensity.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY AREA - SAME TIME 86
text: DOZENS OF PATIENTS lie on gurneys awaiting treatment in a
text: holding area. It's still more intense at the entrance:
text: VOICES talking back and forth urgently, POLICE OFFICERS,
text: CIVILIANS, DOCTORS AND NURSES converging.
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY AREA - LATE AFTERNOON 87
text: FIVE AMBULANCES unload patients at the same time. At that
text: moment a group of TWENTY JAPANESE HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATORS
text: reaches the E.R. portion of their tour.
text: A WHITE MERCEDES tears up the ramp and SCREECHES to a stop.
text: A YOUNG MAN in gang colors is pushed out, bleeding heavily.
text: A DOCTOR runs at the Mercedes to head it off, yelling
text: indignantly. The car plows right into him and takes off.
text: Another ambulance crests the ramp, lights flashing. The
text: Mercedes SLAMS into it head-on. NURSES AND DOCTORS run into
text: the parking lot. A GANGBANGER gets out of the Mercedes, dazed
text: and wobbly. He pulls a pistol. Everyone dives for cover.
text: The Mercedes driver is unconscious. The driver of the smashed
text: up ambulance is slumped over the wheel. The rear doors fly
text: open, and a young Hispanic woman, ROSA HERRERA, leaps out.
speaker_heading: ROSA
text: SOMEBODY HELP US! PLEASE, SOMEBODY!
text: Doctors and nurses work on patients and try to get to the

text: SECURITY GUARDS draw their guns and scream at him to drop it.
speaker_heading: ROSA (cont'd)
text: WHY ISN'T ANYBODY HELPING US?!!
dialog: (to gunman in Spanish)
dialog: Hey, you little shit! If I had a gun I'd
dialog: shoot you right now!
text: The loading area is jammed with panicked people. Doctors and
text: nurses creep out of the hospital on all fours, trying to stay
dialog: 69.
text: low. No one is getting to Rosa, whose frantic eyes find
text: Betty. They look right at each other.
speaker_heading: ROSA (cont'd)
dialog: What are you standing there for?!
text: Betty walks toward her calmly, indifferent to the danger as
text: Rosa pulls the gurney out of the ambulance herself. A
text: PARAMEDIC lies unconscious inside.
speaker_heading: ROSA (cont'd)
dialog: You gotta help him, he's hurt bad!!
text: On the gurney is a YOUNG MAN with a chest wound, nearly dead
text: from blood loss. A DOCTOR appears and quickly examines him
text: while keeping one eye on the gunman. He looks up at Betty.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #1
dialog: Forget it! He doesn't have a chance.
dialog: Help us over here.
text: The doctor takes off. Rosa looks at Betty, crying.
speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: Please!
text: Betty hesitates, then checks his pulse - he has none. She
text: peels back the bandages over a huge chest wound.
speaker_heading: ROSA (CONT'D)
dialog: Danny, it's gonna be all right!
text: Betty looks at Rosa again; looks around for help - there's no
text: one. She plunges her fingers into the wound.
speaker_heading: ROSA (cont'd)
dialog: (panic)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: He has no heartbeat!
speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: You're hurting him!!

speaker_heading: BETTY

speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
speaker_heading: BETTY
text: LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S
dialog: DEAD!
dialog: 70.
text: She keeps working on him. We hear a GUNSHOT, and the kid
text: with the pistol falls to the pavement. The loading area
text: immediately fills with DOCTORS, NURSES and COPS.
speaker_heading: BETTY (CONT'D)
dialog: All right, we're moving him inside! Give
dialog: me a hand!
text: Rosa is shocked into motion. Together they wheel Danny toward
text: the entrance. A DOCTOR and TWO NURSES come out to take over.
text: Betty, her white uniform now covered in blood, steps aside.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - LATER 88
text: The DOCTOR tries to calm Rosa and keep her from entering the

speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: Is he gonna live?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: He's got a chance. Thanks to what that

speaker_heading: CHIEF NURSE

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: May I have my key, please?
text: She puts the bag on the counter, revealing that the front of

dialog: Right?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE

text: A WOMAN with greasy blonde hair and skinny legs shown off by

speaker_heading: CHIEF NURSE
dialog: What you did yesterday was reckless at

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NURSE

dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (cont'd)
dialog: Perfect match on the description.
speaker_heading: ON CHARLIE
text: Lying across the front seat taping the reassembled photo of

dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (0.S.)
speaker_heading: (CONT'D)
dialog: Sounds like she's with the buyer Del
dialog: lined up.
text: Charlie pulls himself up on the door and looks down.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: How'd they describe her?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Not so fast! Slower... 'blonde, thin',
dialog: yes... Did they say she had style? A
dialog: kind of grace or anything?
text: Wesley rolls his eyes, then goes straight to the levers
text: controlling the hydraulic jack.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: (to mechanic)
dialog: How do I get this fucking thing down?
speaker_heading: MECHANIC

speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: Probably the same thing my mom would do
dialog: if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
dialog: So how's it going with your new roomie?
dialog: What's her name?
speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out.
dialog: We spent all weekend looking for her
dialog: 85.
dialog: doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy
dialog: leave no trace of himself?
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
dialog: So tell her to settle for the old one in
dialog: Orange County.
speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of
dialog: ideas.
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
dialog: Maybe we're suing him for malpractice.
dialog: What's his name again?
speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: David Ravell.
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
dialog: God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell,
dialog: Ravell... where's he out of?
speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: I'm not sure now. She said he used to be
dialog: over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
dialog: Loma Vista?
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: You mean like the guy on "A Reason to
dialog: Love?"
scene_heading: INT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - LATER 104
text: Rosa enters, tosses her purse on the table and goes straight
text: to the VCR. Written in magic marker on a video is "A Reason
dialog: to Love, Apr. 23." The tape Sue Ann gave to Betty.
text: She pops it in and turns it on. The OPENING TITLES start
text: The characters appear ... one is an impossibly handsome man

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL PHARMACY - LATER STILL 105

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: What? Where was he?!
speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: ON TELEVISION! !
dialog: (off Betty's puzzled look)
dialog: Cut the shit, will you!
text: A BEAT. Rosa SLAMS the videotape down on the counter.
speaker_heading: ROSA (CONT'D)
dialog: Either you're making a fool out of me
dialog: because you get off on it, or you got
dialog: serious problems. Which one is it?!
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I have no idea what you're talking about.
speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Shhh! I heard you the first time.
speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: (suddenly calm)
dialog: I spent my weekend looking for someone
dialog: who does - not - exist. I should have
dialog: been here at the hospital with my
dialog: brother, but I was with you.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: If you didn't want to do it, you should
dialog: have said so! Is this about gas money?
speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!!
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: You have a thing for an actor on a stupid
dialog: white soap opera, and we searched all
dialog: over town for his character! Not the
dialog: actor - whose name is George, by the way.
dialog: His character!
text: Rosa stands over Betty, fuming.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Are you having a nervous breakdown?
text: Rosa SCREAMS and smacks her hand on the glass as Betty
text: watches. SEVERAL PEOPLE in a nearby lounge look up. Rosa
text: stares at them until they look away.
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: BETTY (cont'd)
dialog: Why'd you help me in the first place?
speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask

dialog: THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: HE IS REAL!!
text: Betty tries to return to her work but Rosa confronts her

speaker_heading: 106A

speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: You need help, Betty! Even if this is
dialog: your idea of a joke, you need SERIOUS
dialog: HELP! !
dialog: (walking away - to herself)
dialog: Necesitas un mdico! Pront simo!
speaker_heading: ON BETTY
text: fuming in her humiliation. After a moment, Rosa reappears at

speaker_heading: ROSA (cont'd)
dialog: I'm not going back on our arrangement. My

speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: You're wastin' your time, Roy.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Look Joyce, I need your key to the files,

dialog: 88.
text: Roy works on opening a side window.
speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead,

speaker_heading: ROY

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who

dialog: be breaking in here...
text: drains from Joyce's face.
speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: ROY (0.S.)
dialog: The driver was killed. I think there's a

speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: (starting to cry)
dialog: No, about... Are you talking about Duane
dialog: Cooley?
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: ROY (0.S.)

speaker_heading: BALLARD

speaker_heading: BALLARD

speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Well, do something, then, damnit!
speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: You watch your mouth when you're in a

dialog: I see what's going on? Del, now this
dialog: Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with
dialog: Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some
dialog: episode off the X-Files... 's just a
dialog: crime of passion, plain and simple.
dialog: Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral
dialog: rampage, that's what is going on here.
text: A moment of silence as they drive.
speaker_heading: ROY

speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that

scene_heading: 108 INT. BETTY'S BEDROOM - LATER 108
text: Betty's lying on her bed reading "Modern Nurse". The L.A.

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a
text: tiny break.
speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: This is crazy. I come home, you go to
dialog: your room. You go in the kitchen, I go
dialog: to my room. It's stupid.
text: Betty nods in agreement.
speaker_heading: ROSA (cont'd)
dialog: So what do you say? Can we be friends?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: . okay.
text: Rosa smiles and starts looking at the tickets in her hand.
speaker_heading: BETTY (cont'd)
dialog: What are those for?
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money
dialog: goes to a good cause, but I don't have

speaker_heading: ROSA

scene_heading: INT. LINCOLN TOWN CAR - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON 109
text: The car is covered in dust and mud from the road. It's worse
text: inside: food wrappers, empty bottles, pieces of clothing,
text: filthy windows. They've been living in it.
text: Wesley's driving now. Charlie's almost unrecognizable: a six
text: day beard, uncombed greasy hair, bloodshot eyes, rumpled
text: clothes and an exhausted, faraway look. The photo of Betty
text: faces him, taped to the glove box. He is reading from the
text: diary, which he clutches like the Bible.
text: They roar along a desert highway, passing a sign that says
text: "Grand Canyon, This Exit. 74 Miles." Charlie looks up,
text: marking his place.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: We should go.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: We don't have time to look at a hole in
dialog: the ground. We can make Vegas in four
dialog: hours. This one's got to be her.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It's a very moving experience, trust me.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: No
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the
dialog: World.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: No... be dark before we get there. You
dialog: wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What difference does it make? She wasn't
dialog: in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We
dialog: 92.
dialog: went to every goddamn place Del mentioned
dialog: and no Betty. So what the hell makes you
dialog: think she's in Vegas? You think she's
text: waiting for us with tassles on her
dialog: titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: I said, 'No.' N-O.
text: Charlie turns to a passage and reads aloud.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: “When I grow up I'm going to become a
dialog: nurse or a veterinarian. I always want
dialog: to help people and value all life, be it
dialog: animal, plant or mineral..."
dialog: (to Wesley)
dialog: Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl
dialog: to you?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Do you hear yourself right now...? Like
dialog: a fucking madman...
text: Wesley drives on stoically. The Exit comes and goes.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Every American should see the Grand
dialog: Canyon. Are you an American?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Yes, I am and we're not going. Act
dialog: professional.
text: Charlie stares at him, hate rising from just below the
text: surface. He draws a nickel-plated pistol and points it at
text: Wesley's head. Wesley looks at it and keeps on driving.
text: Charlie knows this isn't the way to handle it. He lowers the
dialog: pistol.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: If you don't take the next turn for the
dialog: canyon, I'm blowing my goddamn brains all
dialog: over this car.
text: He puts the pistol in his mouth and cocks it. Wesley looks
text: over, not so sure this time.
text: LONG SHOT of the black Town Car as the turn signal comes on,
text: and it eases onto a lonely dirt road. Their headlights pick

text: chrome, hitting Betty in the eye. She freezes, and Rosa bumps
text: into her.
speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: Sorry.
text: Betty stares at the car, unable to remember what it should
text: mean. Then a MAN in a tuxedo gets out. Betty moves on.
scene_heading: INT. BEVERLY HILTON - LOBBY - EVENING 111
text: A sign on an easel reads "Save the Children." Betty and Rosa
text: present their tickets at the door to a ballroom.

text: scattering of flashbulbs. Rosa scans the crowd.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Looking for someone?
speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: You never know who you'll see.
text: Rosa keeps looking. Finally, GEORGE McCORD - the actor who
text: plays DAVID RAVELL - enters.
text: He comes in with LYLA BRANCH, late 40's, and TWO OTHER MEN.
text: Several women approach George, some starry-eyed, for quick,
text: polite greetings. He's doing his job of being a soap star.
text: Rosa waits for an opening, then puts her hands on Betty's
text: shoulders and points her at George.
speaker_heading: ROSA (cont'd)
dialog: Look who's here!
text: Betty's jaw drops. She freezes.
speaker_heading: ROSA (cont'd)
dialog: What are you waiting for? ‘Talk to him!
dialog: You came fifteen hundred miles for this.
text: Rosa prods her, then Betty makes her way unsteadily toward
text: George. When she's a few feet away he looks up.
text: He can't help but notice her - she's beautiful. She's also
text: looking right into his eyes. The conversation stops as he
text: does a double take in Betty's direction.
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Do I know you from...?
text: His friends watch as George studies her face.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: ..0f course you do.
dialog: (hurt)
dialog: You don't remember me?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I take it I should. I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: We were engaged.
speaker_heading: LYLA
dialog: Oh good, another one...
text: George's friends look at each other. A few heads turn.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: But I'm the one who's sorry. Letting you
dialog: go was the biggest mistake of my life.
dialog: (to his friends)
dialog: We were thirteen days away from getting
dialog: married and ... I just got scared. It's a
dialog: mistake I've had to live with for six
dialog: years. But it's behind me now...
dialog: (to George)
dialog: And I hope you can put it behind you.
dialog: I've missed you... David.
text: George sighs with relief. His friends smile. The tension
text: evaporates. They can handle a fanatical fan.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: That's very kind of you.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: The day I left you I just drove and
dialog: drove. I drove all day and all that
dialog: night, and I didn't go anywhere. I just
dialog: kept driving. I stopped at a little
dialog: country church, and the pastor let me in,
dialog: and I sat--
speaker_heading: LYLA
dialog: in the very first pew, where we would
dialog: have sat on our wedding day.
dialog: 95.
text: Betty looks at her. So does George.
speaker_heading: LYLA (cont'd)
dialog: I can't believe I remembered that,
dialog: although I suppose I should. I wrote
dialog: it...
dialog: (to Betty)
dialog: But that was seven years ago, and you're
dialog: quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I
dialog: think. Or frightened. What's your
dialog: name?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you
dialog: wrote it?
speaker_heading: LYLA
dialog: I'm Lyla Branch. I'm the Producer.
text: They shake hands. ACROSS THE ROOM Rosa watches expectantly.
speaker_heading: LYLA (cont'd)
dialog: Alright, I admit it, you had me there.
dialog: You're better than most of them,
dialog: anyway...do you have a headshot?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No, wait...what happened next, Betty?
speaker_heading: LYLA
dialog: Are you sure you want to encourage this?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: No, you're right, let's have some fun.
dialog: So, what did happened next, "Betty"?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Well, David moved out here and started
dialog: his residency. Then he met Leslie--
speaker_heading: LYLA
dialog: No, no, no. We know all that. What
dialog: happened with you?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I married a car salesman.
text: The friends laugh. Rosa watches, confused. So is Betty.
speaker_heading: FRIEND #1
dialog: You were dumped for a car salesman,
dialog: George!
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Why are you calling him George?
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: FRIEND #2
dialog: Yeah - David - tell us about this car
dialog: salesman.
dialog: George likes the challenge. This party isn't so boring after
dialog: all.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, you mean Fred.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: No, Del.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman.
dialog: Of cars. He could talk anyone into
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: You knew Del?!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the
dialog: time, but Del and I go way back. We went
dialog: to school together. In fact, he saved my
text: life. Two more minutes in that icy water
dialog: and I would have drowned. But Del jumped
text: in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch
dialog: eventually, but I still owe him one.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: He never told me anything about...that's
dialog: unbelievable!
speaker_heading: LYLA
dialog: Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I can't tell you how much it hurts me to
dialog: hear that you married him.
text: His friends snicker. Rosa stares. Betty is oblivious to
dialog: everything but George.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I'm so sorry. Life makes us do awful
dialog: things sometimes.
text: She's ready to cry. Which only inspires him all the more.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I tried to tell myself it was for the
dialog: best, that there was a reason behind it.
dialog: But... Del?
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: There was no plan! I was just young and
dialog: stupid and scared!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You never gave us a chance...
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I know that. I can't tell you how many
dialog: times I've said that to myself in those
dialog: exact words.
text: Betty wipes her tears away as they flow freely now. George
text: doesn't like seeing her cry; he tries to say something but
text: his friends interrupt.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hey, don't... come on, I was just...
dialog: you're not really crying, are you?... I
dialog: was just playing along...
speaker_heading: FRIEND #1
dialog: Now, look what you've done, George.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Why do they keep calling you George?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I don't know. Why do you keep calling me
dialog: George?
speaker_heading: LYLA
dialog: Listen - David - It's getting late.
text: George hesitates; Lyla sees it.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (to Betty)
dialog: Right, uhh...I feel terrible about this,
dialog: we have a prior engagement at another
dialog: party.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: But... I'd be honored if you'd come.
speaker_heading: LYLA
dialog: Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure
dialog: you got a lot of catching up to do...
text: Rosa watches, stunned, as Betty waves to her as she leaves
text: arm-in-arm with the man of her dreams.

speaker_heading: ON CHARLIE
text: walking toward the rail. As he nears her, they kiss.

text: The image of Betty shudders, then blurs, then fades away
text: entirely. Charlie rubs at his eyes tiredly, then slowly
text: trudges back toward the car.
text: Charlie returns and gets into the car. Silence. Wesley
text: stares at him.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: you have a good time? You make a
dialog: little wish?
text: Silence from Charlie.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (cont'd)
dialog: Well, guess what? I found Betty... where

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Where? Where is she?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: I'm not telling.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: I'm not telling 'til you straighten up.

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Huh. I had no idea our little lot was so
dialog: popular...
speaker_heading: FRIEND #1
dialog: I never bought a car from Del. But I
dialog: loved him. In my own way.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I guess we all did. (to Betty) You know,
dialog: I didn't marry Leslie because I loved

speaker_heading: ERIC

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

dialog: Betty would go to.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She

dialog: pees, doesn't she?!...
text: Wesley tears the photo of Betty from the glove box.

speaker_heading: WESLEY

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: We're looking for this young lady.
text: He slides the photo of Betty across the bar. Ellen's gaze
text: drops to the picture for a second, and Charlie sees what he

text: Wesley shows Ellen his badge as Merle checks out the photo.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I haven't seen her.
speaker_heading: MERLE
dialog: Sure you have! That's

text: Charlie takes the photo and puts it back in his pocket.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I never saw that woman before, and

dialog: And don't try to tell me you're cops. I
dialog: 102.
dialog: was married to a cop for nine years, and
dialog: you're not cops. Now get out of here.
text: Wesley steps behind Merle, takes a handful of his hair and
text: SLAMS his head into the popcorn machine on the bar. Merle
text: staggers away, stunned. Wesley removes the tin popcorn scoop
text: from a nearby hook.
text: Ellen reaches for something under the bar, but Charlie's
text: faster. He pins her arm with one hand.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You haven't been very forthcoming with
dialog: us.
text: They watch Wesley follow Merle at a slow walk around the pool
text: table, CLOBBERING him over the head about every five steps
text: with the popcorn scoop.
text: Merle wobbles with every shot, but won't go down. They begin
text: a torturous second lap around the table, punctuated by the
text: CLANG of the scoop against Merle's head.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What's your name, dear?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Ellen.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What happened when you were twelve?
speaker_heading: BETTY

speaker_heading: BETTY

speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I know. It's up to us.
text: Betty leans over and kisses George - so deeply that he's too

speaker_heading: BETTY (cont'd)

speaker_heading: BETTY
text: To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
speaker_heading: ROSA

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Yes. I'd never been in a place like that

speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: I have, lots of times. My mother used to

text: up and starts for her bedroom. She stops.
speaker_heading: ROSA (cont'd)
dialog: This isn't fair, you know. Do you always

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: No, almost never.
speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: But, you're in love with someone who

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, no, Betty came here strictly for

text: The other actors take their positions. Lyla watches from
text: behind the cameras as David readies himself. Chloe enters the
text: set with Kleenex tucked into the neck of her costume.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: (to Betty)
dialog: Hi. I hear you're great. Good luck...
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: What are you doing here? David...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Your lines'll are in the script, but you
dialog: can ad lib.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Ad lib?
dialog: 118.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: In fact, I want you to ad lib, that's the
dialog: magic I'm after. I wanna give a whole
dialog: new feel to the show.
text: She's sliding toward a complete meltdown.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Slate it!
text: George steps back behind the cameras. Betty's still frozen
text: to her spot, overwhelmed.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Just do what you've been doing. Watch
dialog: the scene and on your cue take off from
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: 5-4-3-2...
text: Chloe and Blake run through their lines lifelessly, then stop
text: when they get to Betty's cue. Their faces loom around her
text: menacingly. Staring. The lights are impossibly bright.
text: People begin to shuffle and stare at one another. Lyla clears
text: her throat as George bounds on stage, still smiling.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Betty?
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Are you all right?
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: (to Chloe)
dialog: I think you stepped on my first line...
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: I was talking to her.
dialog: (to Betty)
dialog: Do you need anything...?
text: She's freezing up. George approaches her.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Betty, I thought this would be the best
dialog: way. You know, throw you into it...
speaker_heading: LYLA
dialog: What the hell's going on?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: If you need a minute, that's okay. But I
dialog: thought you'd want to--
dialog: 119.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: David, I don't... Can we talk privately
dialog: for a second?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Stop calling me David. We're on set, for
dialog: Christ's sake, you don't have to call me
dialog: David here.
text: As he pulls away Betty grabs his arm.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Why are you doing this to me?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this
dialog: what you wanted?
text: Lyla approaches.
speaker_heading: LYLA
dialog: Is there a problem, George?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No! No problem, there is no...
dialog: (to Betty, sotto)
dialog: What is the problem? Just do that...
dialog: thing... you do! Come on! You drove me
dialog: nuts with this for three days, now do it!
text: George steps back behind the cameras as if nothing's wrong.
text: Betty still hasn't moved. She's shaking with fear.
text: and crew members find it hard to look at her.
speaker_heading: LYLA
dialog: All right, everybody! That's ten
dialog: minutes!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No! Let me try this!
speaker_heading: JASMINE
dialog: (storming off)
dialog: This is bullshit!
speaker_heading: LYLA
dialog: Forget it, George. It was a gamble,
dialog: didn't work. Nice try.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN
text: DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
speaker_heading: LYLA
dialog: I SAID FORGET IT!
text: George throws down his script and rushes up to Betty,
text: reaches out to him. He brushes her hands away.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, I don't know what you had in mind,
dialog: but I hope you're happy. I put myself on
dialog: the line for you, my reputation, and
dialog: you're making me look like an idiot.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: What do you mean? What did I do to
dialog: you...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Who put you up to this? Did my ex-wife
dialog: ask you to...?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: David, please--
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: STOP CALLING ME THAT! MY NAME IS NOT
text: DAVID, AND IF YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW THE
text: DIFFERENCE, YOU'RE MORE FUCKED UP THAN I
dialog: THOUGHT YOU WERE!
dialog: The cast
dialog: 120.
dialog: who
text: Betty begins to cry.
speaker_heading: STAGEHAND
dialog: Leave her alone, George!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: SHUT THE FUCK UP!! You're a fucking grip,
dialog: go grip something!!!
dialog: (to Betty)
dialog: And you're not an actress, you're nothing
dialog: but a soap opera groupie, aren't you?
dialog: YOU HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO! DO YOU??
dialog: Well, why don't you get a fucking life,
dialog: and stop ruining mine!
dialog: 
text: Betty stands dead still as George continues to berate her.
text: ALL SOUND slowly starts to drop out, then comes back abruptly
text: with a RUSH. Suddenly a light snaps on for her and she
text: stares at him.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I'm sorry...0h my gosh, are you George
dialog: McCord?!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: ...What? What did you call me?
dialog: 121.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: George...McCord. You're my favorite actor
dialog: on...
speaker_heading: LYLA
dialog: She called you 'George,' George.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: ...did I win some contest?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David,
dialog: but she thinks I am! You heard her...
dialog: (looking around the group)
dialog: Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she
dialog: is!
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Why are you screaming at me? I mean,
dialog: what am I... why am I here? I don't...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You're doing this now? After all the..
dialog: are you sick? Are you going to kill me
dialog: now?
dialog: 132
dialog: 133
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I
dialog: caused you all any trouble... I just, I
dialog: don't know how I...
dialog: (to George)
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: George watches Betty walk off the set. The cast and crew try
text: to pretend this scene didn't happen, except for Lyla, who
text: burns a hole into George's back. Their eyes meet.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: OMIT 132
scene_heading: INT. TV STUDIOS / RECEPTION AREA - DAY 133
text: George McCord, wearing sunglasses and still angry, strides
text: into the lobby. Charlie and Wesley stand quickly and take
text: out their badges as he approaches.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What can I do for you, gentlemen?
dialog: 122.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying
dialog: to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a
dialog: Ms. Betty...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Deranged. That would be the right word.
text: Wesley takes out the photo of Betty.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (cont'd)
dialog: That won't be necessary. She's staying
dialog: with a Rosa something... Hernandez,
dialog: Herrera. I know it's an 'H' sound... in
dialog: Silverlake.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Thanks so much. You must get bothered by
dialog: this kind of thing a lot.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: More than you know. Is there anything
dialog: else?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, that should be more than--
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Good.
text: George turns to leave.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Actually, there is one more thing.
text: George stops. Wesley is suddenly shy, hesitant.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (cont'd)
dialog: It's just... well... I watch the show
dialog: too, and you being Dr. Ravell and all, I
dialog: thought you could maybe get Jasmine to
dialog: come out here.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You thought wrong.
text: George pulls away. Wesley grabs his sleeve.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: It's just for an autograph. It's not for
dialog: me...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It never is.
dialog: 123.
text: George wrenches free of Wesley's grip and takes off.
text: Wesley is furious. He catches George in two strides, spins
text: him around and SLAPS him across the face. George's glasses
text: go skittering across the floor. PEOPLE stare.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: You need to learn some manners, friend...
dialog: reach out to your goddamn fan base a
dialog: little more.
text: Charlie pulls Wesley away. George is frozen to the spot,
text: humiliated, a pink handprint emerging on his cheek.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (cont'd)
dialog: and I saw your movie-of-the-week. It
dialog: sucked dick!
scene_heading: 134 EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - DAY 134
text: Betty walks aimlessly along a busy street. She moves without
text: direction, in a daze until a glint of bright light hits her,
text: causing her to turn. She is staring at a black Lincoln
text: sitting in a car lot, sunlight dancing off its chrome. She
text: shudders involuntarily at it. Suddenly, she hears a familiar
dialog: voice.
speaker_heading: DEL (0.S.)
dialog: What the hell are you doing here?
text: It's Del. He's in a pastel version of his usual shirt,
dialog: slacks, and tie.
speaker_heading: DEL (cont'd)
dialog: Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd
dialog: you come here for?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I came for love...
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: You're not on that soap opera thing
dialog: again, are you? 'Cause you know what
dialog: that is?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: It's people with no lives watching other
dialog: people's fake lives.
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: That's right. So, if you know it, why
dialog: are you in trouble?
dialog: 124.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: You sure don't. Who do you think you are
dialog: coming to Hollywood, anyway? You should
dialog: remember where you came from. And who you
dialog: really are.
text: Del looks up at the sun for a moment, shading his eye from
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: DEL (cont'd)
dialog: I gotta run. Got some serious clients to
dialog: meet, with real potential.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Goddamn, it's hot!
text: He wipes the sweat from his brow. Betty looks at his
text: handkerchief and sees that it's soaked in blood. Then back
text: at his face, now obscured by blood pouring down from his
dialog: head.
text: She stares, horrified, and in that moment Del becomes... a
dialog: 135
text: MAN, staring back at her as he wipes the sweat from his brow.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Who are you talking to? Are you crazy?
text: Betty backs away and melts into the flow of PEDESTRIANS.
scene_heading: INT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - LATER 135
text: Rosa comes home from work and tosses her purse and jacket on
text: the chair. No Betty in her room.
speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: Bet-ty!? Did the pizza guy show up yet?
text: She emerges from Rosa's bedroom with toiletries and moves to
text: an open suitcase in her room. She barely acknowledges Rosa.
speaker_heading: ROSA (cont'd)
dialog: Are you all right?
dialog: (no answer)
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: He dumped you, didn't he? I KNEW IT WHEN
dialog: I MET HIM!! He's a loser, like the rest
dialog: of them. Mother-fucker!
text: Rosa now notices Betty packing.
dialog: 125.
speaker_heading: ROSA (cont'd)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I'm going back to... I need to... I don't
dialog: know.
text: Rosa tries to stop Betty for a moment to talk. Betty grabs a
text: pile of Rosa's clothes and heads for her room.
speaker_heading: BETTY (cont'd)
dialog: this is your sweater, right?
speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I have to leave now.
text: She tries to put Betty's suitcase away.
speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: What? No, I'm not gonna let you just run
dialog: out of here... You need to talk about
dialog: what's going on...
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't
dialog: know the half of it. My husband was,
dialog: ahh...
speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: Your husband?!
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Yes, I had a husband and he was killed
dialog: two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right
dialog: there...
text: Rosa stops.
speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: Jesus!... What are you saying?
text: They stare at each other for a beat.
speaker_heading: ROSA (cont'd)
dialog: What?! That you had something to do with
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I don't know. I'm just starting to
dialog: remember it now. I don't...
dialog: 126.
speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: Yeah, but your running away isn't going
dialog: to help you with all this...
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw
dialog: it, I think I watched the whole thing
dialog: happen... Oh my God...
speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: Okay, okay, look, ummm... Let's just talk
dialog: a little first and you'll feel better, I
dialog: promise.
dialog: 
text: The doorbell rings.
speaker_heading: ROSA (cont'd)
dialog: That's our pizza... You can't go yet.
scene_heading: 136 EXT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - DAY 136
dialog: 137
text: Charlie watches Betty undress from a nearby fire escape. He
text: stares at the object of his desperate search with relief and
dialog: some fascination.
text: Betty's movements are unhurried, mindless. Charlie stares,
text: mesmerized, until she steps into the shower.
scene_heading: EXT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - STREET - SAME TIME 137
text: Wesley gently nudges open the trunk to Betty's LeSabre. The
text: cardboard cut-out of David Ravell pops out at him.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Whoa! What the fuck're you doing here?
text: He breaks it over his knee and throws it in the gutter, then
text: quickly removes the wing nut holding the spare tire. He
text: removes the tire, then raises the panel on the floor of the
text: trunk as Charlie joins him.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (cont'd)
text: It's all here. It hasn't been touched.
text: The bottom of the trunk is lined with brown paper-wrapped
text: bricks of cocaine. Charlie stares at it, shaking his head.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (cont'd)
dialog: You were right. Del wasn't lying.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Well, you were right about what that
dialog: bartender said.
dialog: 127.
text: Wesley looks at him. He appreciates the compliment.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: But you were right first. You gotta
dialog: follow your instincts.
text: Charlie takes a long look at Wesley and smiles proudly.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What do your instincts tell you to do
dialog: now, kid?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit
dialog: and get the rest of our money.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: We could do that. I could be on my way
dialog: to Florida, and you could go to Thailand
dialog: 138
dialog: and fuck your brains out.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: ...but that's not what we're gonna do, is
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No... if we don't finish this job, how
dialog: are we gonna look at ourselves in the
dialog: mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's
dialog: the last one. My instinct says I gotta
dialog: see this through with her, and if there's
dialog: one thing I've tried to teach you here--
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: It's to follow my instincts. And my
dialog: instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, I said to follow 'my' instincts.
dialog: Now, we go up there and conclude our
dialog: business. Case closed.
text: Charlie walks off. Wesley closes the trunk up and prepares
text: to follow him.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: oh, that's fucking democratic.
scene_heading: INT. ROSA'S APARTMENT / HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 138
text: At the sound of the BUZZER Rosa goes to the door. She looks
text: through the peephole and sees Charlie holding up a badge.
dialog: 128.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm Detective Jefferson--
speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: Oh... Did Betty call you?
text: Charlie nods. Rosa opens the door, and he enters with
dialog: Wesley.
speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: She's got problems, but she's no killer.
dialog: I hope you guys can straighten this
dialog: out...
text: Charlie and Wesley exchange a puzzled look.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: We'll do what we can. Where is she?
speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: Bet-ty!
dialog: (to the men)
dialog: Please, go easy on her. She's had a
dialog: really rough day.
text: Betty appears. She recognizes the men instantly and freezes.
text: Charlie's eyes wander over her... slowly. Wesley notices.
speaker_heading: ROSA (cont'd)
dialog: These guys are here to help you, Betty.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
text: Wesley produces a pistol, sitting Rosa forcibly on the sofa
text: and tapes her mouth and hands. Charlie walks over to Betty.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: We meet again.
text: He moves closer to her... almost whispers. Wesley steps in
text: and quickly tapes her hands. Charlie stops him.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (cont'd)
dialog: Not her mouth...
dialog: (to Betty)
dialog: I've spent many long hours in a car with
dialog: your face staring back at me. I've seen
text: it painted on the horizon.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: (to Charlie)
dialog: What's wrong with you?
dialog: 129.
text: A KNOCK at the door ruins Charlie's moment.
speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: That's our pizza.
text: Wesley hustles Rosa out of the room.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Get rid of them. You understand?
text: Betty nods, scared, and looks through the peephole. She
text: stares with disbelief at ROY OSTREY. He KNOCKS again. She
text: opens the door a crack.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Roy! What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: You're in serious danger!
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Ahh, look, right now's not very...
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I woulda' been here sooner, but Ballard
dialog: put me in jail. He still thinks you had
text: Del scalped.
speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: I never said that! Open the door, Betty.
text: BALLARD shoves Roy aside; Charlie's getting edgy
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Sheriff, I don't...
speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some
dialog: questions for you about...
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Have you checked the trunk of that car
dialog: you're driving, Betty? I think there
dialog: might be...
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: It's not really a good time, guys...
speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: Don't give me that. I've come two
dialog: thousand miles for this!
dialog: 130.
text: Charlie has been listening quietly on the other side of the
text: door and finally snaps.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Two thousand miles? That's nothing!
text: He flings the door open, sticks a pistol in Ballard's face
text: and yanks them both inside.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (cont'd)
dialog: Hah! You probably flew! I've crossed
dialog: the river Styx looking for her, pal! I
dialog: travelled the fucking country to be here!
text: Charlie slams the door and frisks them, taking a gun and
text: handcuffs from Ballard. Wesley returns with Rosa.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (cont'd)
dialog: (to Betty)
dialog: Who are these idiots?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And
dialog: this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to
dialog: Fair Oaks High together...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh, this is wonderful...
text: Wesley takes over. He sits Rosa down on the sofa, then
text: pushes Betty down next to her and beckons to Roy.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Come here.
text: He breaks Roy's nose with his pistol. Roy crumples to the
text: floor, holding his face. Betty starts to scream, but Charlie
text: puts his hand over her mouth.
text: Wesley tapes Roy's hands together, then beckons to Ballard.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (cont'd)
dialog: Your turn.
text: Ballard drops to his knees in a prayer-like position near the
dialog: aquarium.
speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: I got two kids and a dog...
text: Wesley grabs his shirtfront and slams him to the floor, then
text: with a foot on his neck, he loops Ballard's arms around one
text: leg of the steel aquarium stand and handcuffs him.
dialog: 131.
text: Charlie does nothing but stare at Betty, his eyes locked with
text: hers. Wesley sees it.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Act professional, remember?
text: Charlie pulls her to her feet.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (cont'd)
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Charlie leads Betty out of the room.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (cont'd)
dialog: No way! This is not professional!
dialog: 139
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - SAME TIME 139
dialog: Silence.
text: Then Charlie takes out a knife and cuts the tape
text: from Betty's wrists, touching her hair. Gently. He leaves
text: her standing in the corner while he sits on the edge of the
dialog: bed.
dialog: She does.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I s'pose you did that so I could take
dialog: my sweater off or something.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, just stand there... lemme look at you
dialog: a minute.
text: Charlie stares intently at her.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (cont'd)
dialog: Do you know who I am?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I... I know what you are.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Do you know why I'm here?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I've got a pretty good idea. You're here
dialog: to kill me, so kill me. You want me to
dialog: be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who
dialog: you are, or why you two killed my
dialog: husband...
text: Charlie studies her, then sets his gun down on the bed.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You really... didn't have anything to do
dialog: with what Del was doing, did you?
dialog: 132.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I have no idea what he was mixed up in...
dialog: it was always something.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So you weren't involved with him in his
dialog: pathetic attempt to diversify?
dialog: (off her blank look)
dialog: Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against
dialog: drugs.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Damn, life is strange. I had you figured
dialog: for this cold-blooded, calculating bitch--
dialog: Not that I didn't admire you for it.
text: Charlie slowly folds his knife and pockets it.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: well, if you're not going to slit my
dialog: throat, why'd you come up here?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: to see you.
scene_heading: 140 INT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME 140
text: Wesley stands over Ballard, about to tape his mouth. Rosa and
text: Roy are sitting in chairs opposite them, their mouths and
text: wrists already taped.
speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: You killed that bartender in Arizona and
dialog: the trucker in Texas, didn't you?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: How did you find Betty?
speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: I just put it all together. I knew David,
text: Lonnie and Chloe were from that show.
text: Roy starts freaking out, trying to talk through the tape.
speaker_heading: BALLARD (cont'd)
dialog: Betty thinks they're real people. It
dialog: sounded crazy, but it was worth a shot.
dialog: Roy is apoplectic...
dialog: 133.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: What do you want?!
text: Wesley tears his tape off.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: That's a lie! I figured it out! I've
dialog: been trying to tell this dumbass--
speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: --small-time, pissant, Barney Fife--
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up, both of you,
dialog: before I kill you!
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I'm the one who watched the show...I
dialog: was...
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Did Chloe crack?
speaker_heading: ROY
text: Totally. She came apart like a house of
dialog: cards. They dropped the charges...
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: She's a lesbian.
text: Wesley immediately pulls his gun and points it at Roy's head.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: You lie, motherfucker...
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I swear to God!
text: Rosa STAMPS her feet, drawing Wesley's attention. She tries
text: to talk through the duct tape; gestures for him to come to
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: What?! You scream, you die.
text: He yanks the tape off. Rosa winces.
speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: I have a tape of today's show.
dialog: 134.
scene_heading: 141 INT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME TIME 141
text: Betty is sitting on the bed. Charlie leans against the wall,
text: facing her. He has trouble starting this.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I never meet people like you. I'ma
dialog: garbageman of the human conditon. I deal
dialog: with trash, mostly, people willing to
dialog: trade any part of themselves for a few
dialog: more minutes of their rotten lives. But
dialog: you... you're different.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I am?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Sure. You could probably have any thing
dialog: you wanted... somebody as beautiful and
dialog: stylish as yourself, and you don't even
dialog: realize it.
text: Betty looks curiously over at Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (cont'd)
dialog: I'm appreciably older than you, but my
dialog: health is good. I take care of myself,
dialog: and I got some money socked away. You'd
dialog: never have to work agin, that's for sure.
dialog: I'd treat you like a queen.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Umm, I don't think that...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Wait. Let me get this out.
dialog: (clears his throat)
dialog: I like the symphony, walks in the rain,
dialog: sunsets, animals and children. I read
dialog: passionately, and I like to discuss
dialog: things. I'm basically conservative, but
dialog: flexible. I've been involved in the
dialog: death of thirty-two people, but I can
dialog: live with that because the world is
text: lighter by thirty-two pieces of shit,
dialog: excuse my language.
speaker_heading: BETTY

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: You probably feel I'm flattering myself
dialog: to see us together.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I don't feel that, no. I just....I'm not
dialog: really who you think I am.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No one is, honey. Here, listen to
dialog: this... "I£ who I am and who I hope to
dialog: be should meet one day, I know they will
dialog: be friends." Now that's beautiful.
text: Betty is stunned.
speaker_heading: BETTY

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (he pulls out the diary)
dialog: I know. I borrowed it from your
dialog: grandparents because I... I... it doesn't
dialog: matter. Don't worry, they're fine...
dialog: (he gives the diary back)
dialog: Look, I used to feel that same way, said
dialog: practically those same words, sitting at
text: night in a foxhole in Korea...
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I've chased you across the country,
dialog: Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot
dialog: more alike than you'd think.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I thought you were a garbageman of
dialog: humanity, or something.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that
dialog: behind me now...
scene_heading: INT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME 142
text: Wesley is engrossed in watching "A Reason to Love." Behind
text: him, Ballard quietly walks his feet up the wall until he's
text: completely upside down. He rubs one foot against the other
text: until one pantleg is above his cowboy boot. Rosa and Roy
dialog: watch.
text: He finally lifts the boot off. It falls soundlessly onto his
text: chest. A small pistol is revealed, holstered above his ankle.
text: He works the holster open using the edge of the fishtank.
dialog: 136.
text: Roy and Rosa COUGH LOUDLY at the same time to cover the
text: noise. Wesley glares at them.
text: Ballard gets the pistol free. But it falls into the fishtank.
text: The air goes out of Roy's sails. Ballard has fucked up again.
text: On screen, Chloe and Jasmine kiss and embrace. Wesley reacts
text: as if he was slapped.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: goddamn!
text: Wesley immediately runs the sequence back to view it again.
text: Ballard KICKS the wall of the fishtank with his cowboy boot.
text: Roy and Rosa cover the sound again with COUGHING. Wesley
text: pauses the T.V. and looks around.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (cont'd)
dialog: What's your problem?
text: Ballard KICKS at the tank again. But he can't break the
text: glass. Roy can't take it any more. He launches himself at the
text: tank, grabs it by the rim and pulls it down on top of
text: himself. A torrent of water, fish, plants and gravel pours
text: down upon him.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (cont'd)
dialog: You stupid piece of fuck!
text: He leaps at Roy and starts kicking him savagely. Rosa throws
text: herself onto Wesley's back, knocking him to the floor.
text: Ballard paws through the muck, scattering fish and gravel
text: everywhere. He spots a glint of metal in the sand.
text: Wesley struggles out from under Rosa. Just as he gets free,
text: Ballard FIRES, hitting him TWICE into his chest. Wesley
text: stares in disbelief at the blood rushing out of him. Then at
text: Ballard, as if trying to link the two.
text: He slumps to the floor and opens his mouth to scream
speaker_heading: WESLEY (cont'd)
scene_heading: D-A-A-A-D-D-D-Y-Y-!!!!
text: Charlie opens the bedroom door.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Wesley??!
text: Charlie sees Wesley turn to him as Ballard FIRES again.
text: Wesley's face explodes. The flying lead drives Charlie back
text: to the bedroom.
text: Crawling through the muck, Roy notices a fish flopping
text: helplessly on the carpet inches from his face.
dialog: 137.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Those're Japanese koi!
speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: 143-144
dialog: Yes! How'd you know that?
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: You gotta get 'em in water right away!
speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: We're in a shootout, Roy! Shut up about
dialog: the damn fish!
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: YOU shut up!
dialog: (to Rosa)
dialog: They're beautiful, but get them some
dialog: water.
text: He gently hands her the fish, then picks up Wesley's nearby
text: gun. Rosa nods; she's amazed that he knew what it was. She
text: looks at Roy in a slightly different way before crawling away

text: Charlie FIRES back from the doorway.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh, Christ, they shot my boy!
text: Enraged, he empties his pistol at the living room. Ballard

speaker_heading: CHARLIE (cont'd)
dialog: (reloading)
dialog: How the hell did this happen? I'm in a
dialog: goddamn shoot-out! Wesley? What the
dialog: fuck happened out there?!
text: He opens the door, and a bullet slams into the doorjamb near
text: his head. He ducks back in.
text: Charlie sags against the wall, looking toward Betty.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (cont'd)
dialog: That's my son! My son is dead!
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I'm sorry.
dialog: 138.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE
speaker_heading: HERE!
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON
dialog: YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN
scene_heading: BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE
dialog: UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!
text: Charlie fights back his grief.
speaker_heading: BETTY (cont'd)
dialog: What do you want from me?
text: Charlie can't handle the moment. He breaks for the door,
text: and BLASTS away. This time he's nicked in the shoulder. He
text: stumbles back, losing his balance. His gun falls and slides
text: right into Betty's hand. Equally surprised they stare at one
dialog: another.
text: Charlie slumps over in his defeat as Betty holds a shaky
text: pistol on him.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh shit...
scene_heading: INT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME 146
text: Rosa crawls to a flower vase and dumps a second koi into the

speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: (checks his gun)
dialog: We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll
dialog: cover you.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I'm not going out there! Let's wait for

speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: You gotta go, we're pinned down!
speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: So why can't we just sneak outside? Huh?
speaker_heading: BALLARD

dialog: You wanna see if he has more shells, go

speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: No, no, no... you don't know shit about

speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I've got the working gun, Elden, me! You

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: BETTY

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered

speaker_heading: BETTY

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Ahh, it's too late, anyway. It's too
dialog: late.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Listen, I could shoot my way out, maybe
dialog: take one of them with me... If you'd

dialog: 140.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I'd rather not...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in
dialog: some stinking prison. No way. I've got
dialog: some professional pride. And I don't
dialog: want anybody else to get the credit for
dialog: taking me out.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: ..what're you saying?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: When a Roman general knew a battle was
text: lost, he'd throw himself on his sword.
text: Charlie fumbles in his pocket, then pulls out the photo of
text: Betty with the cardboard David Ravell.
dialog: Charlie's
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (cont'd)
dialog: Did... did you really come here because
dialog: you love this guy?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor.
dialog: I think.
text: sinks slowly to the floor.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So all this...really was because of that
dialog: soap opera? My son is dead because you
dialog: came out here to be with that doctor? A
dialog: fake doctor?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I wouldn't have put it quite that way,
dialog: but...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Wesley didn't even want to come up here.
dialog: He warned me, but I insisted...
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
speaker_heading: BETTY

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

dialog: 141.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: You don't need that doctor. You don't
dialog: need that actor. You don't need any man.
dialog: It's not the forties, honey. You don't
dialog: need anybody. You've got yourself... and
dialog: that's more than most people can say.
text: Charlie reaches out slowly and takes the gun from Betty. She

dialog: This story is beyond belief, which is

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I don't think she can do it. You saw

speaker_heading: LYLA
dialog: You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in

dialog: 142.
text: with the idea of killing David Ravell off
text: in a boating accident.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: That's not a bad idea. How many episodes

speaker_heading: GEORGE (cont'd)

speaker_heading: BETTY
