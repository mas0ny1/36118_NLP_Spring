dialog: Rebecca Miller
text: Based on a story by Karen Rinaldi
scene_heading: EXT. GREENWICH VILLAGE STREET - DAY 1
text: MAGGIE: We see the back of her blonde head. It’s a beautiful
text: winter day. Now we see her from across the street. We see her
text: feet making determined strides. This is a young woman who
dialog: knows where she is going.
text: Wide shot: A blind man is tentatively making ready to cross
dialog: the street.
text: Among the handful of pedestrians about to cross, Maggie is
text: the only one to notice, and helps the man across.
scene_heading: EXT. PRODUCE MARKET - DAY 2
text: TONY, Maggie’s best friend, looks a little like Art Garfunkel
text: as a young man: fluffy hair, glasses, dressed in a suit
text: jacket and baggy chinos. He’s pushing a stroller with a
text: reading, fluffy-haired, bespectacled four year old boy in it,
text: wearing a t-shirt with “IMAGINE THERE’S NO FRACKING” written
text: on the front. This boy is too big to be in a stroller, and
text: too young to be reading. Maggie rushes to them.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Sorry! Sorry I’m late... Hi! Hi
dialog: Max!
text: She snuffles the little boy’s neck.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: You still have one little corner of
dialog: baby smell. Right (sniff) there.
text: Max giggles and pushes her away so he can get back to his
text: reading. Maggie straightens up.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ach, I need a baby!
text: She bites her fist.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You need a baby? You’re such an
text: impatient little fuss-budget.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I just don’t see why I should wait.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: For a father, perhaps?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: 2
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Let’s face it. I’ve never been in a
dialog: serious relationship that lasted
dialog: longer than six months.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (paying)
dialog: We were together for two years.
dialog: They walk.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: In college. And we made each other
text: miserable for the rest of the time.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I admit it. We were miserable. But
dialog: we were also happy.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Yeah.
text: They reach a stand of homemade jams. Tony picks one up.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Just so you know. I have little
text: sperm tucked away in a facility
dialog: uptown, if you’re in a pinch.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: What?! Why? I thought Felicia
dialog: didn’t want any more kids.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Felicia does not want any more
dialog: kids. I froze it in case I ever
dialog: meet anybody nice.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: No, you didn’t.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I didn’t. But I might, you know,
dialog: save it, like ‘mad money’-style?
text: Maggie has something to tell Tony, and she wants to get it
text: over with fast.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: (rushing this part)
dialog: Do you remember Guy Childers, from
dialog: college?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2) 2
text: A moment as Tony searches for the name in his mind.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Wasn’t he the Guy...he’s a pickle
dialog: salesman?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: He’s a pickle entrepreneur. And--
dialog: he’s agreed to make a donation, so
dialog: I can inseminate myself.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: But he has no sense of personal
dialog: space!
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: So what? He was a math major.
dialog: Anyway, I’m not marrying him, I’m
text: borrowing his genes.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: But not his personality I hope. Guy
dialog: Childers...?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: (shrugs )
dialog: Everybody has something a little
dialog: wrong with them. You think
dialog: everybody's honest who fills out
dialog: those questionnaires at the sperm
dialog: bank?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I can’t believe you've been cooking
dialog: this up all this time and you
dialog: didn’t even tell me.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I knew that you’d yell at me.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I’m not yelling at you! Isn’t this
dialog: sort of thing for women who are
dialog: like forty-nine and desperate?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I don’t want it to be a last
dialog: resort, I want it to be a choice.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3) 2
speaker_heading: MAGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Because I’m ready be a mother, and
dialog: I don’t believe I’1l find a man who
dialog: I can stay in love with-- or who
dialog: can stay in love with me-- for more
dialog: than six months. I’m just facing
dialog: the truth about myself.
text: Tony is morose at this news, but he accepts it.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: So when’s the insemination? Are we
dialog: gonna have a party?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: In four months.
text: As they walk away from camera:
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Do I have bad breath?
text: He breaths into the air near her mouth. She sniffs.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: No. Do I?
text: She breathes into his mouth.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: No.
text: And they walk off. Good friends; unusual friends...

text: and clogs.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: I started production in my
dialog: apartment three years ago. Now I
dialog: have twelve employees, and I just
dialog: got an order from Whole Foods. If

speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You skate?
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Every Sunday. I grew up on the ice.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Oh right. You were on the ice
dialog: hockey team.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I used to skate a lot when I was
dialog: little.
text: A moment of awkwardness.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: So, regarding our plan. Here... is

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: (scanning the results)
dialog: That’s great.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh! I have for you:
text: Maggie takes an empty plastic specimen jar out of her purse.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Ah.
text: He takes it and looks into it, as if for an answer.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You need to keep it warm, when
dialog: you...so just put it next to your
dialog: body underneath your shirt...and
dialog: you can come right over.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Okay...
text: Guy places the jar on the desk. They look at it together.
speaker_heading: GUY (CONT'D)
dialog: So when do you want to do this?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: March...twenty third?
text: Guy thinks about his schedule. No conflicts come to mind.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I just want to build up some more
dialog: savings.
text: Guy pulls out a stool for Maggie solicitously, in
text: anticipation, perhaps, of her pregnancy.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: That’s smart.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I have insurance and everything.
dialog: So, I guess the question is, how
dialog: much involvement do you want? I was
dialog: going to suggest none, but I’m open
dialog: to negotiation.
text: A beat as Guy digests this.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: A3
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: None is...so cool. It kind of takes
dialog: the pressure off, doesn’t it?
text: He takes a seat and leans back against the refrigerator,
text: beside a large circulating fan.
speaker_heading: GUY (CONT'D)
dialog: I can just relax, and build my
dialog: empire.

speaker_heading: BEVERLY

speaker_heading: BEVERLY

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Oh well my name is Johanna Hardin,

dialog: the check it’s Johanna Margaret
dialog: Hardin. So maybe there was a mix-
dialog: up.
text: Beverly is on the computer. She looks a little put out. She

speaker_heading: BEVERLY

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: MAGGIE

speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: He’s one of the bad-boys of Ficto-

speaker_heading: MAGGIE

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE

dialog: He’s trying to remember saying that.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: What is ficto-critical
dialog: anthropology, anyway?

speaker_heading: GEORGETTE

speaker_heading: KLIEGLER
dialog: Maybe the way we--
speaker_heading: JOHN

dialog: going to happen on a schedule. This
dialog: was a genuine populist uprising.
speaker_heading: KLIEGLER
dialog: Yes! Because-—
speaker_heading: GEORGETTE
dialog: Absolutely. But to return to the
dialog: use of masks in politics. I am more
dialog: interested in the possibility of
dialog: anonymity and group affiliation --
dialog: the “I am Spartacus” maneuver --
dialog: which has been the primary tactical
dialog: explanation of the use of masks

speaker_heading: JOHN

text: Glowing with idiosyncratic appeal. Backing up, Maggie stares
text: at him in surprise, then thoughtfulness, then affection. She
text: backs up till she hits the barrier of the rink. She can’t
text: back up anymore. Move closer and closer to her watching Guy,
text: until she is in a huge close up, on the very edge of her next
dialog: move.
