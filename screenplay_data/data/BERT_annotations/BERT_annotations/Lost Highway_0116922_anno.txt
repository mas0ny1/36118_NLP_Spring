scene_heading: INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
text: in the blackness, a man, FRED, is sitting on a bed smoking a
text: cigarette. we see his back, but with each glow of the
text: cigarette ash, we see his face reflected in a mirror on the
text: wall across from him. In the darkness, there starts the
text: sound of a motor which draws curtains back across a large
text: picture window just off screen. As the curtain moves, hard-edged
text: light begins crawling across the room, and we see
text: everything clearly. Fred is wearing a robe and pajamas, it's
text: early morning.
text: CLOSE UP ON FRED'S FACE IN THE MIRROR - Blank expression -
text: face somewhat obscured or distorted by smoke from the
dialog: cigarette.
text: CLOSE UP 0N FRED'S ACTUAL FACE - Unshaven, haggard look, eyes
text: seem empty, glazed over. Fred is 32 years old, with dark
dialog: hair.
text: THE DOORBELL RINGS. Fred looks up, startled by the noise.
text: He looks at the digital clock: 5:30 a.m.
text: FRED STANDS, goes to an INTERCOM on the wall next to the
text: mirror. He pushes a button.
text: A VOICE comes over the intercom.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
speaker_heading: INTERCOM
text: Dick Laurent is dead.
text: Fred leaves the bedroom and goes through the house. He is on

text: old, dark hair, dressed smartly, a drink in her hand.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: You don't mind that I'm not coming
dialog: tonight?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: What are you going to do?
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: I thought I'd stay home and read.
text: Fred looks her over, she's sexy without trying.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Read?... Read what, Renee?
text: Renee sits down on a couch and sips her drink. Fred comes
text: over to her, kisses her on the neck, which makes her laugh.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: It's nice to know I can still make you
dialog: laugh.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: I like to laugh, Fred.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: That's why I married you.
speaker_heading: RENEE

scene_heading: EXT. THE MADISON HOUSE - DOORSTEPS - DAY
text: Renee in a bathrobe, opens the front door to collect the
text: mail. She sees a plain, clean, manila envelope lying on the

text: CLOSE UP ON THE ENVELOPE - No stamp, no writing, blank. She
text: takes the mail from the box, and goes back into the house.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Renee opens the manila envelope. She's noticeably nervous
text: when she sees a videotape inside. She stares at it.
text: Fred enters, also wearing a bathrobe. He sees Renee staring
text: at the videotape - before she hears him enter. When she does
text: hear him, her eyes jerk away from the tape.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: RENEE
text: A videotape.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Who's it from?
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: I don't know... There's no return address
dialog: on the envelope... In fact, there's no
text: address on it.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Does it say anything on the tape?
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: (looking it over)
dialog: No, nothing.
text: Fred walks over and picks up the tape.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Well, let's see what's on it.
text: Fred takes the tape to the VCR. He inserts it into the
text: machine, and turns it on. Fred goes toward the couch.
speaker_heading: FRED (CON'T)
dialog: (to Renee)
dialog: Come on.
text: They sit on the couch in front of the television.
text: The TV monitor: We begin on the TV, then the videotape fills
text: the entire frame. The videotape shows the front of THE
text: MADISON HOUSE, the camera panning slowly over it. The
text: picture is accompanied by an eerie DRONING SOUND. After the
text: camera pans back to the front door, the tape image turns to snow.
text: Fred and Renee stare at the snow for a few moments. Renee
text: looks relieved.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: It must be from a real estate agent.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Maybe.
text: We see a WIDE SHOT encompassing Fred, Renee, and the snowy

speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY
text: Renee is seated at the dining room table - coffee cup and
text: grapefruit in front of her. She is wearing glasses, reading
text: a book. Fred enters, and sees Renee, who does not look up or
text: acknowledge him. Fred goes into the kitchen, which is just
text: off the dining room. He comes back into the dining room with
text: a cup of coffee, and sits down with it opposite Renee. He
text: lights up a cigarette, sips his coffee, and looks at her.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Good book, huh?
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: (she looks up)
dialog: Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Same one you were reading the other
dialog: night?
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: What night?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: When you didn't come to the club.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: I called, you know.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: Called? When?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: From the club. You didn't answer.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep
dialog: when you got home, wasn't I?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: You were asleep when I got home, yes.
text: Renee goes back to her book. Fred sips his coffee and
text: smokes.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: (without looking up)
dialog: I told you you could wake me up if you
dialog: wanted to.
text: Renee looks up at him now, takes off her glasses, and stares
text: at him.
text: CLOSE UP OF FRED'S FACE - a disturbed expression.
text: Renee seems about to say something more, but stops, puts her
text: glasses back on and resumes reading.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Fred is in bed waiting for Renee. He hears noises from the
text: bathroom - bottles clinking, drawers opening and closing.
text: Renee comes out wearing a robe, which she sheds just before
text: getting into bed. Naked under the covers, she switches out
text: her bedside lamp. The only light in the room comes from the
text: outside, through the windows. Fred moves closer to Renee,
text: puts his lips to her cheek, a hand on her breast. She does
text: not respond. Fred pulls Renee to him, and kisses her
text: passionately. Renee accedes to his demands, but does not
text: participate willingly. He makes love to her voraciously, but
text: her lack of passion disturbs him. Fred can't stop, however,
text: and when he comes she acts consolingly, stroking him
text: maternally while he calms down. He climbs off of her and
text: retreats to his side of the bed.
text: CLOSE UP ON FRED'S EYES - which express his horror and
dialog: humiliation.
text: They lie there in the dark silence for a while.
text: Fred turns back toward Renee in the darkness.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: I had a dream about you last night...
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: You were in the house... calling my

speaker_heading: FRED'S DREAM
text: Fred is walking slowly across the living room.
text: Fred's POV: moving - searching.
text: Fred stops and listens.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: (tentatively - distant and off
dialog: screen)
dialog: Fred? Fred, where are you?
text: The camera turns slowly back toward the hallway, and as it
text: drifts it RISES UP following along the hall and turning
text: slowly into the bedroom. Renee is lying below in the bed.
speaker_heading: FRED V.0.
dialog: Then there you were... lying in bed...
dialog: but it wasn't you... It looked like
dialog: you... but it wasn't.
text: The camera suddenly dives violently at Renee - into a TIGHT
text: CLOSE UP. Her face registers TOTAL FEAR.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Fred is lying in bed with Renee, who is now backlit by her
text: bedside lamp. Fred looks at her shadowed face, but it's not
text: Renee's face. It's a face Fred has never seen before. Fred
text: quickly turns and switches on his bedside lamp, and looks
text: quickly back at Renee, whose face is now her own.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: Fred, are you all right?
text: Fred reaches out a hand and tenderly touches her face. Renee
text: covers his hand with her own, and closes her eyes.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. THE MADISON HOUSE - DAY
text: Renee finds another envelope on the doorstep. She opens it,
text: pulls out a videotape. A large dog is BARKING incessantly
text: somewhere in the neighborhood. Renee looks around to see if
text: she can see the dog.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE MADIS0N HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Renee brings the videotape upstairs with the rest of the
text: mail. She is a bit puzzled and unsettled. She puts the tape
text: down on a table. She stares at it. Fred comes in.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: You're up early.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: That dog woke me. I lay there for a
text: while, then decided to get up.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Who the hell owns that dog?
text: Fred notices the tape and manila envelope on the table.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: What's that? Another tape?
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: Yes, I just found it on the step.
text: Fred picks it up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Don't you want to watch it?
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: I guess so.
text: Fred goes to the VCR and inserts the tape. He turns the
text: television on. He is about to start the tape - he looks up
text: for Renee. She's hanging back.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Well, do you wanna watch it?
text: Again, Renee seems to be nervous about what could be on the
text: tape, but she hides this from Fred and walks toward the
dialog: couch.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: Yeah.
text: Renee sits on the couch. Fred starts the VCR and joins her.
text: As before, we first see it on the TV, then the videotape
text: fills the frame. This tape shows the front of the house, as
text: before, then shows the INTERIOR of Fred and Renee's house -
text: AT NIGHT.
text: The eerie DRONING SOUND goes throughout.
text: The camera glides at a very high angle near the ceilings
text: looking down as it travels along a hallway and turns into
text: their bedroom, where we see Fred and Renee sleeping. The
text: tape image then goes to snow.
text: Fred and Renee stare at the snowy TV picture. After a few
text: moments of silence, Renee gets up and switches off the set.
text: She is visibly shaken, trembling. She stares fearfully at
text: Fred who seems less disturbed.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: We've got to call the police.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: All right.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Renee is on the telephone. Fred is pacing, smoking, behind
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: ...yes, I've been on hold for ten
dialog: minutes... I can't... All right, thanks.
text: Renee looks around anxiously. Fred gives her his cigarette,
text: which she puffs on. He lights another and continues pacing.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: Hello, yes... Good... My name is Renee
dialog: Madison... My husband is Fred Madison,
dialog: the jazz musician... we	live at 442
dialog: Hollis Street... Right... 442 Hollis...
dialog: near the observatory... Someone's been in
dialog: the house... at night... while we were
dialog: sleeping... I know because they sent,
dialog: dropped off a videotape... two
dialog: videotapes... to show us... That's
dialog: right... Yes... it... the second one...
text: shows us asleep... Someone broke in and
dialog: taped us while we slept!... Isn't that
dialog: enough?... Okay, sure... We will... 442
dialog: Hollis... Yes, we'll be here.
text: Renee hangs up.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: RENEE
text: Two detectives are coming out.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Two men in suits - the Detectives, ED and AL, are seated on
text: the couch, watching the last part of the second videotape.
text: The screen goes to snow and stays that way for several
text: moments, until Fred shuts it off.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: That's it.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Let's have a look at the hallway outside
dialog: the bedroom.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY
text: All four of them go to the hallway, where Ed and Al look
text: around, especially up toward the ceiling.
speaker_heading: AL
dialog: Very strange.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: What is?
speaker_heading: AL
text: The angle. The high angle shot on the
dialog: tape.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: How'd the camera get so high like that?
speaker_heading: AL
text: And smooth... Almost no movement - back
dialog: and forth, I mean.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Like you'd get if it was hand held.
speaker_heading: AL
dialog: Right ... This just glided along.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
text: The Detectives enter the bedroom. Fred and Renee follow.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: This is the bedroom.
text: The Detectives look around without touching anything.
speaker_heading: AL
dialog: Do you always sleep here?... In this
dialog: room?... Both of you?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: This is our bedroom.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: There's no other bedroom?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: No... There is, I mean, I use it as a
text: practice room... it's soundproofed.
speaker_heading: AL
dialog: You're a musician?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Yes, I thought my wife ...
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What's your axe?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: Tone deaf.
speaker_heading: AL
dialog: (to Renee)
dialog: Do you own a video camera?
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: No. Fred hates them.
text: The Detectives both look at Fred.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: I like to remember things my own way.
speaker_heading: AL
dialog: What do you mean by that?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: How I remember them. Not necessarily the
dialog: way they happened.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Do you have an alarm system?
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: Yes, actually we do... but we haven't
dialog: been using it.
speaker_heading: AL
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: It kept going off for some reason. False
text: alarms.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Might be a good time to try using it
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: AL
dialog: Anybody else have a key to the house.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: AL
dialog: Maid? Relative?
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: No, one of us is always here to let the
text: maid in. Nobody else has a key.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (to Al)
dialog: Let's check the doors and windows... See

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: As best we can.
speaker_heading: AL
dialog: If anything else happens, you'll call us.

speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: We will.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Thanks, guys.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: It's what we do.
text: Ed and Al get into the car and drive off. Renee and Fred

speaker_heading: VIDEOTAPE.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LUNA LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: Fred is on the bandstand, sweating, and honking his

text: swept away in the madness of the moment.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LUNA LOUNGE - SAME
text: At the back, near the side door, Renee can be seen with TWO
text: MEN, only one of whose faces we see. The trio are going out

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - STAIRWELL / LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Fred is standing in the living room looking in the direction
text: of the stairwell. We HEAR someone's steps coming up the
text: stairs. It's Renee, who eventually comes into view. She is
text: holding another manila envelope. She arrives at the top
dialog: step.
text: She and Fred lock eyes.
text: Fred takes the envelope, opens it, and pulls out a third
text: videotape. without saying anything, Fred takes the tape to
text: the VCR. He inserts it very carefully, slowly. He hits
text: play, turns on the television and he and Renee sit down on
text: the couch together and begin to watch with great
text: apprehension.
text: Again we begin with a WIDE SHOT and then the TV monitor fills
text: the screen: We see the interior of the house at night. The
text: camera glides looking down from a high angle along the
text: hallway and into the bedroom, where Fred and Renee are
dialog: sleeping.
text: Again, the DRONING SOUND plays throughout.
text: in the bedroom where Fred and Renee are seen sleeping,
text: SUDDENLY, Fred, on the tape, slowly awakens as the camera
text: holds on him. He rises and turns unnaturally in the bed, as
text: if drawn up by his awareness of some strange presence in the
text: room. He comes to a sitting position, his head straining
text: upwards, looking in the direction of the camera. At this
text: point, the videotape image turns to snow.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

text: Renee is very upset, crying.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: What the hell is going on?!
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: (equally horrified -
dialog: frightened)
dialog: I wish I knew.
text: Fred reaches over and tentatively takes Renee's hand in his.
text: She trembles, allows him to touch her, but otherwise does not
text: respond. Suddenly, she jumps with fright.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: What was that?!!!
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: On the tape! There was something else on
dialog: the tape.
text: Fred gets up and rewinds it, passing an image.
speaker_heading: RENEE (CON'T)
dialog: There! Play it!
text: Fred runs the tape forward.
text: We see snow - then a half-second long MEDIUM SHOT of Fred on
text: his knees near the bedroom wall on Renee's side of the bed.
text: He is looking directly at the camera - his face a ghastly
text: grimace, contorted. His eyes are WIDE WITH HORROR.
text: Fred runs it back again and FREEZES the tape there on his
text: tormented image. This image fills the screen. He and Renee
text: stare at it.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: The Detectives, with Fred and Renee are seated on chairs and

speaker_heading: AL
dialog: You don't remember being awakened? It
dialog: looks like you were aware of someone.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Or something.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: No, I don't remember anything. it looks
dialog: like I... but... I don't remember.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: Why would anyone do something like this?
speaker_heading: AL
dialog: Has anyone made any threats to either of
dialog: you recently?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Or not so recently?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: No, not to me.
text: Al, Ed and Fred all look at Renee.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: I...	no. No. No threats.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: We'll take the tapes with us, if that's
dialog: all right with you?
text: Ed looks at Fred, then Renee, both of whom nod their
dialog: agreement.
speaker_heading: AL
dialog: We'll see that the patrol of the house is
dialog: doubled.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: I don't know if I want to stay here. I
dialog: don't feel safe.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Where would you feel safe?
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: I don't know. maybe a hotel.
text: Ed and Al are watching this exchange between Fred and Renee
text: with keen interest.
text: There is a strained silence between them.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Did you use the alarm system since we
dialog: were here last?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: The first night ... Not the last two.
speaker_heading: AL
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of
dialog: acting paranoid.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: Acting paranoid?!!! Someone is in our
dialog: house while we're sleeping, filming us,
dialog: and you don't want to act paranoid?!!! I
dialog: thought you set the alarm!
text: Fred gets up, lights a cigarette, paces.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: I'll make sure the alarm is set from now
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: But that doesn't solve the problem. Who
dialog: is doing this? And why?
text: Ed and Al rise from their chairs. Ed picks up the envelopes.
speaker_heading: AL
dialog: We'll find out, Mrs. Madison.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: A swinging party is in progress at Andy's house - the man
text: whose face we saw at the Luna Lounge with Renee. ANDY, 37
text: years old, a slick guy, is seen moving through the crowd,
text: making small talk, kissing and being kissed. The PEOPLE here
text: are wannabe players, the men mostly shady, gold-chain-
text: wearing, slightly unsavory types; the women dressed
text: provocatively, big hair and skin-tight dresses. Through
text: sliding glass doors we see nude and semi-nude people
text: cavorting in a swimming pool. Everyone has a drink in his or
text: her hand. Renee finishes her drinkt and hands the empty
text: glass to Fred who walks away with it. Andy grabs Renee, and
text: dances with her. They laugh and talk. Renee appears to be a
text: bit intoxicated.
text: Fred, who appears less than thrilled with the carryings on,
text: makes his way to the open bar where he orders two drinks.
text: When the drinks arrive he drains one of them completely, then
text: sets the empty glass down on the bar. Then he swallows the
text: other drink, too, and sets down the glass.
text: A MYSTERY MAN, tall, well-dressed and groomed, older than
text: Fred, approaches him.
speaker_heading: MYSTERY MAN
dialog: We've met before, haven't we?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: I don't think so. Where was it that you

speaker_heading: MYSTERY MAN

speaker_heading: MYSTERY MAN
dialog: Ask me.

speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: How did you get into my house?
speaker_heading: PHONE VOICE OF
speaker_heading: MYSTERY MAN

speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Who are you?
text: The man laughs - identical laughs - both over the phone and in person.
speaker_heading: PHONE VOICE OF
speaker_heading: MYSTERY MAN
dialog: Give me my phone back.

text: Fred hears the line go dead, and he slowly passes the phone
text: back to the Mystery Man who takes it, folds it, and puts it in his pocket.
speaker_heading: MYSTERY MAN
dialog: It's been a pleasure talking to you.
text: The man walks away from Fred. Renee appears and comes up to Fred.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: I thought you were getting me a drink?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Just a minute.
text: He takes Renee by the arm and goes over to the host of the

speaker_heading: GUESTS.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Andy, who is that guy?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: (looking at the Mystery Man)

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Yes, I believe so.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: (remembering something)

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: FRED

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: FRED

text: BLOOD is splattered over the floor, bed, walls. The camera

text: her on the tape, ON HIS KNEES, A HORRIFIED, UNBELIEVING
text: EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE. On the tape, Fred turns away from
text: Renee - his hands raised, dripping blood - her blood. His
text: movements are almost mechanical, constricted, as he strains

text: Pete attacks the other man who is turning toward him ready

text: crack. He talks quietly to someone Alice can't see, then he
text: turns, opens the door and gestures for Alice to go through.
text: Alice puts out her cigarette - her hand is shaking.
text: She walks over past the Slickster and enters a much larger
text: room. There are about FIFTEEN MEN in the room - all leaning
text: comfortably at different points on the walls. There is only
text: one chair in the room - Mr. Eddy is sitting in it.
text: No one says anything to her, but one man nods his head and
text: from this nod, Alice feels she should walk to the center of
text: the room. She does, and she instinctively turns to the man
text: sitting in the chair.
text: They all just stare at her silently. She looks around
text: nervously - her eyes return to Mr. Eddy's.
text: Suddenly, a man steps quickly up to her - draws a pistol and
text: cocks it against her head.
text: Alice goes weak in the knees. Her eyes fill with fear.
text: The men continue to stare.
text: Mr. Eddy gives Alice a small gesture as if to say "well?".
text: Somehow she knows what they want, even though they haven't
dialog: asked for it with words.
text: Alice starts to undress - slowly - in as sexy a way as she
dialog: knows how.
text: The men just stare without expression.
text: When she is completely naked, Mr. Eddy gestures her over to
text: him. Soon she is on her knees in front of him - making
dialog: herself available for whatever he wants.

text: INSIDE PETE'S MIND the SOUNDS are even LOUDER.
text: Bill comes out of the house. Claire is behind him waiting on

text: Sheila beats Pete and trips him to the ground. She is

speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: SHEILA

speaker_heading: BILL

speaker_heading: SHEILA

speaker_heading: CLAIRE

speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: CLAIRE

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Who is this?
speaker_heading: MR. EDDY
dialog: You know who it is.
text: Bill and Claire have stopped in the living room - watching

text: away, but they leave slowly and reluctantly.
speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: MR. EDDY

speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: MR. EDDY

speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: We've met before, haven't we?
text: Pete freezes. His mind is scrambling.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I don't think so. Where was it that you
dialog: think we've met?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: At your house. Don't you remember?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: No. No, I don't.
speaker_heading: VOICE

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What?
text: Pete can hear Mr. Eddy laugh in the background.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You heard me... We thought we'd come over
dialog: and tell you about it.
text: Pete is getting pale with fear.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What's goin' on?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Great question!! In the east ... the far
dialog: east... when a person is sentenced to
dialog: death... they're sent to a place where
dialog: they can't escape... never knowing when
text: an executioner will step up behind them
text: and fire a bullet into the back of their
dialog: head... it could be days... weeks... or
dialog: even years after the death sentence has
dialog: been pronounced... This uncertainty adds
dialog: an exquisite element of torture to the
dialog: situation, don't you think? It's been a
dialog: pleasure talking to you.
text: Pete can hear the phone being passed again.
speaker_heading: MR. EDDY
dialog: Pete... I just wanted to jump on and tell
dialog: you I'm really glad you're doin' okay.
text: The phone goes dead and Pete sits - fearfully pondering his
text: fate. He hears a NOISE and turns.
text: Down at the far end of the hall he sees his parents staring
text: at him.
text: CLOSE UP ON PARENTS staring in the direction of the living

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DEEP DELL PLACE - NIGHT
text: We see a street sign saying "Deep Dell Place". Pete walks up
text: the street looking at numbers.
text: He finds 2224 Deep Dell Place - Andy's House.
text: He stares at the house from the sidewalk.
text: Lights are on upstairs and down. The hot wind moves big
text: shadows of trees over the front of the house.
text: Pete looks at his watch. It reads: 11:05 p.m.
text: He walks down the driveway, crosses through some bushes and
text: comes to a fence separating the front yard from the back.
text: He stops and listens. He pulls himself up and over the
text: fence, but crashes on something on the other side.
text: He freezes - listening. He hears the wind blowing through
text: the trees, and distant music from inside - a slow jazz piece.
text: He hears echoing sounds of love making.
text: He makes his way around back - goes up the stairs and tries
text: the back door. It opens.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Pete sneaks through the kitchen and comes into the living
text: room. Pete stops short and stares. A movie projector is
text: running in the living room. A porno film is being projected
text: on a huge screen at the far end. Alice is in the porno film.
text: A man is fucking her from behind - with LOUD SLAPPING SOUNDS
text: of flesh banging flesh. Her face is in the foreground. Her
text: eyes look out directly at Pete. She is loving every minute
text: of it. Inside Pete, jealousy starts to rage out of control.
text: He looks around. He sees clothes scattered about. He picks
text: up a girl's sweater and smells it. He looks up the stairs.
text: Feet appear at the top of the stairs. They start down.
text: Pete runs for the bar.
text: Along the way, he grabs a heavy, bronze figurine of a well-
text: stacked woman off a rectangular glass-topped coffee table,
text: and ducks behind the bar.
text: He can hear Andy approaching. He can hear Andy gather two
text: glasses. He can hear Alice being fucked harder in the porno
text: film. He clenches his teeth with rage.
text: Suddenly, Andy moves right in front of him. They see each
text: other. Andy's eyes widen - Pete leaps up, and thwacks the
text: bronze figurine down on the top of Andy's head. Andy falls.
text: The breasts of the figurine have made two bloody holes in his
dialog: forehead.
text: Pete turns.
text: Alice is coming quickly down the stairway - naked, except for
text: a pair of panties. Lipstick is smeared around her mouth.
text: She is carrying a half-filled pillowcase. Her porno film is
text: playing on the wall
text: behind her.
text: These images jump and spin in Pete's mind. He moves
text: unsteadily toward her.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: You got him.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (still holding the figurine)
dialog: Alice, I...
text: Pete starts to tremble. He drops the figurine. He tries to
dialog: embrace her.
text: There is a crashing noise behind him.
text: Pete turns and sees Andy staggering, blood streaming from the
text: wound in his head, THEN CHARGING FULL SPEED AT PETE.
text: Andy hits him hard, and Pete goes down. When Pete hits the
text: ground, he pushes Andy up and throws out his arms. This, and
text: Andy's momentum, catapult Andy into the corner of the
text: rectangular glass-topped coffee table. There is a sound like a
text: hammer going through a bucket of eggs as the glass corner
text: embeds about eight inches into Andy's forehead.
text: CLOSE UP OF ANDY'S HEAD - impaled on the sharp corner of the
text: table, his chest area suspended, his legs and stomach
text: touching the floor.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: (amazement - no feeling)
dialog: Wow!
text: Pete pulls himself off the floor.
text: Pete moves close to Alice, they drift to the glass coffee
text: table, staring for a few moments at Andy's dead body.
text: While Pete stares, unbelieving, at Andy - Alice hurriedly
text: picks up her sweater and puts it on. On the sofa next to it
text: lay Andy's trousers. She goes through the pockets, finds a
text: roll of cash bound by a rubber band. Alice hands the roll to
dialog: Pete.
speaker_heading: ALICE (CON'T)
dialog: Put this in your pocket.
text: Alice kneels next to Andy's body and quickly removes his
text: Rolex wristwatch, a couple of rings and the gold chain
text: dangling from his neck. These items she puts inside the
text: empty pillowcase.
text: Alice finds the rest of her clothes scattered about the
text: living room and puts them on. Pete watches her, trembling,
text: unable to say anything.
text: She comes back to Pete, who starts breathing irregularly,
text: hyperventilating.
speaker_heading: ALICE (CON'T)
dialog: You all right?
speaker_heading: PETE,
dialog: We killed him.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: You killed him.
speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: ALICE

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Alice...
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: (pushing back)
dialog: We gotta get the stuff and get out of
dialog: here.
text: Alice starts off across the living room with the pillowcase.
text: Pete opens his eyes, he sees Alice move as a blur. He looks
text: around the room, which spins in and out of focus. His eyes
text: land on, a PHOTOGRAPH in a frame on the wall. This photo
text: troubles him. Pete squints, then points to the photograph.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Is that you? Are both of them you?
text: CLOSE UP OF THE PHOTOGRAPH - Four people appear in the frame:
text: Andy, Renee, Alice and Mr. Eddy.
text: Alice stops and comes back. She looks at the photo, walks
text: closer to it, and points at herself.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: That's me.
text: She turns to Pete. Pete is staring at the photograph - at
text: Alice and Renee in the photograph. His nose is bleeding
text: profusely.
speaker_heading: ALICE (CON'T)
dialog: Pete?...
text: Pete starts to reel - blood from his nose soaking his shirt.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Where's the bathroom?
speaker_heading: ALICE
text: Up the stairs - down the hall.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - NIGHT
text: Pete staggers toward the bathroom at the rear right of the
text: hallway. THE HALLWAY SUDDENLY BECOMES HAZY, DIFFERENT AND
text: LONGER THAN IT APPEARED TO BE.
text: Pete wanders down this "changed" hall. On his left, he
text: identifies a door with the number 25 on it. He pauses for a
text: moment in front of it, then goes on until, on his right, he
text: comes to a door with the number 26 on it. He enters through
dialog: this door.
text: Inside is a WOMAN in front of a mirror with a MAN. Her arms
text: are resting on a shelf under the mirror as the man takes her
text: from behind. The man's face is blank, featureless, and is
text: buried in the woman's back - we can't see it.
text: Pete now sees that the woman is an extremely whorish version
text: of Alice - she's looking at Pete's reflection in the mirror.
text: He's looking at her reflection in the mirror. Pete's head is
text: pounding.
speaker_heading: WOMAN/ALICE
dialog: (to Pete)
dialog: Did you want to talk to me?
text: Pete rubs his head - the pain is severe.
speaker_heading: WOMAN/ALICE
speaker_heading: (CON'T)
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Did you want to ask me "why"?
text: Pete staggers out of the room.
text: He closes the door. The hallway has "changed" back to Andy's

text: Pete walks, unsteadily, back down the hall - faltering. He
text: starts down the stairs.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Pete comes downstairs to the living room and sees Alice at

dialog: jewelry.
text: She has a PISTOL in her hand.
text: Alice turns when she hears Pete and they study each other's
text: face as Pete makes his way to her. His head is still
text: throbbing with pain. His focus goes from her face to the gun
text: - which is pointing right at him - back to her. Alice
text: smiles.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Don't you trust me, Pete?...
text: She laughs and hands him the pistol.
speaker_heading: ALICE (CON'T)

dialog: house.
text: Pete's POV: He watches Alice ring the doorbell. She waits

dialog: the wind.
text: A HOUSEBOY opens the door. Alice says something to him -
text: Pete cannot bear anything that is said, even though his
text: driver's side window is down. All he can hear is the hot
text: wind blowing.
text: The Houseboy moves out to where he can see Pete, waiting in

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ANDY'S CAR - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: We'll have to wait.
text: The hot wind continues to blow.
text: Alice and Pete walk back down to the car.
text: The HEADLIGHTS are on and Alice reaches in through the window
text: and switches on the RADIO. She can't get anything in but
text: static, with bits and pieces of old tunes fading in and out.
text: She hits the "seek" button. The radio starts to search.
text: Pete is standing in the glare of the headlights watching her.
text: Alice walks slowly to him.
text: The camera captures this from a back seat perspective - then
text: drifts toward them.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Why me, Alice? Why choose me?
text: The radio sticks on a particular tune - a tune filled with
text: longing. Alice begins to dance. She takes Pete's hand and
text: pulls him close to her.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: So we can be together... You still want
dialog: to be with me, don't you Pete?
text: Alice gives Pete that wild smile.
speaker_heading: ALICE (CON'T)
dialog: More than ever?
text: She kisses Pete over and over. He begins to kiss her back.
text: She starts to move him in a dance to the music in the glare
text: of the headlights, the hot wind caressing them.
text: The scene is out of a dream. Alice and Pete help each other
text: undress as they dance in and out of the light, and the wind
text: whips at their bodies.
text: They sink down on the soft ground and start making love.
text: The lights from the headlights combine with the starlight,
text: bathing them in a pristine glow.
text: The music fades and the radio begins to "seek" through static
text: for another station. The music it finds now is LOUD and
scene_heading: INTENSE.
text: Alice - her hunger appearing, now becomes carnivorous in her
text: approach to love making with Pete. She is the aggressor,
text: highly-charged - she wants more and more - taking, not
dialog: giving, insatiable.
text: The headlights flare their bodies in blinding light. They
text: become amorphous, glowing shapes burning in the light.
text: Pete is trying desperately to please her - to have her.
text: The driving music fills with cracks of piercing static. The
text: radio strains to hold the station.
text: Pete's white-hot body clings to Alice. He chokes with
dialog: emotion.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I want you... I want you...
text: With a burning smile, Alice rolls them out of the beams of

dialog: ear.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: You'll never have me.
text: Alice glides away from Pete and stands up looking down at him
dialog: from above.
text: She turns and walks, naked, to the cabin where she disappears

text: holding his head and shaking.
text: As he starts to stand - he turns into the glare of the
text: headlights and we see that it is NOT PETE - BUT FRED.
text: As Fred stands up, the car's LIGHTS DIM and the RADIO FADES.
text: Fred looks at the car. He sees some movement inside. Fred

scene_heading: VOICE FROM BEHIND
speaker_heading: FRED

speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Where's Alice?
speaker_heading: MYSTERY MAN

text: Fred freaks, scared to death. He bolts down the stairs to

text: The Mystery Man appears in the doorway of the cabin. He
text: starts toward Fred.
text: The starter motor moans as Fred twists the key frantically.
text: The smiling Mystery Man is almost at the car,
text: The engine catches. Fred revs it - throws the car in reverse

text: Still watching out the window, the camera sees Fred knock Mr.
text: Eddy/Laurent over the head with the gun butt and put him into
text: the trunk of a car. Fred slams the trunk lid and climbs into
text: the driver's side of what is obviously Mr. Eddy/Laurent's car
dialog: - the Mercedes 600 Pullman.
text: As Fred drives away, a HAND appears in our window foreground.
text: The hand moves the window curtain further to one side. The
text: camera pulls back to reveal it as the hand of the Mystery
text: Man. The Mystery Man leans fully into the frame and watches
text: Fred drive off down the Lost Highway as day breaks.

scene_heading: EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAYBREAK
text: Fred is driving along the road. Suddenly he pulls the car
text: off the road and drives over the dirt and brush to a deserted
text: spot, stops and gets out.
text: Fred opens the trunk. When he does ...
text: Suddenly, Mr. Eddy/Laurent charges up and attacks Fred -
text: knocking them both to the ground. Mr. Eddy/Laurent tries to
text: strangle Fred, but Fred's anger is too great. Fred tears
text: loose and gets Mr. Eddy/Laurent in a hold bending his head
text: back. Fred's hand reaches out behind him - feeling,
dialog: searching.
text: A KNIFE appears.
text: it comes into Fred's hand from another.
text: Fred slices Mr. Eddy/Laurent's throat, and throws him down.
text: Mr. Eddy/Laurent squirms on the ground - his hand grasped
text: around his throat - trying to hold his neck together. Blood
text: is flowing rapidly through his fingers and over the front of
text: him as be turns and opens his mouth with a gurgling sound.
text: Fred stands, facing him, his pistol out now - pointing right
text: at Mr. Eddy/Laurent's forehead.
text: CLOSE UP ON MR. EDDY/LAURENT - he lifts his head and stares
text: at Fred. Blood is rushing out of him.

dialog: (wet and jagged)
dialog: What do you guys want?
text: The camera pans around to Fred - we see that the Mystery Man
text: is standing beside Fred, and it is the Mystery Man who is
text: holding the gun, not Fred.
text: The Mystery Man reaches into his pocket and pulls out a
text: little watchman TV. He turns it on and hands it over to Mr.
text: Eddy/Laurent, who manages to take it.
text: Mr. Eddy/Laurent looks down at the small television screen.
text: Mr. Eddy/Laurent's POV: As he watches the TV screen, we move
text: in until the screen fills the frame - as with the former
text: videotapes. The full frame of the TV screen reveals -
scene_heading: INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: We see the movie screen on a wall in Andy's living room.
text: Marian, Raquel and RENEE'S images are being projected on this
text: screen, simultaneously involved in pornographic acts with two
text: men. Watching this movie in Andy's living room are several
text: people in shadows behind the light of the projector. Among
text: them we see RENEE and MR. EDDY/LAURENT standing next to ANDY.
text: Mr. Eddy/Laurent and Renee are hot - kissing - his hand is up
text: under her skirt. They are watching the porno film. They are
text: watching murky images of sex turning to violence.
text: In a CLOSE UP we see Renee and Mr. Eddy/Laurent in the
text: shadows looking out at the film, both half-smiling, stoned,
dialog: aroused.
text: The image on the Watchman changes now.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - DAYBREAK
text: On the Watchman TV screen Mr. Eddy/Laurent sees an image of
text: Fred and the Mystery Man staring at him. The Mystery Man's
dialog: image speaks.
speaker_heading: MYSTERY MAN
dialog: (on TV screen)
dialog: Now you can hand it back to me.
text: Mr. Eddy/Laurent sees the Mystery Man's image reach out a
dialog: hand.
text: Mr. Eddy/Laurent looks up. The Mystery Man has his arm
text: outstretched just as it was on the video image. Mr. Eddy/
text: Laurent hands the Watchman back, and locks eyes with the
dialog: Mystery Man.
scene_heading: MR. EDDY/LAURENT
dialog: (wet and jagged)
dialog: You and me, mister, we can really out-
dialog: ugly the sumbitches, can't we?
text: The mystery Man unloads the pistol into Mr. Eddy/Laurent, who
text: jerks and dies in the dust.
text: The Mystery Man then leans close to Fred and whispers in his
dialog: ear.
text: The camera moves in, past the Mystery Man to a CLOSE UP OF
text: FRED'S EYES as he listens.
text: The camera cuts back wide to reveal Fred holding the gun. He
text: is standing alone - there is no Mystery Man. Fred turns to
dialog: go back to the car.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY
text: Fred is behind the wheel of his car. Behind him are the
dialog: cops.
text: CLOSE UP ON FRED'S FACE - through the front windshield. The
text: shot is wide enough to reveal the cop car in hot pursuit.
text: Fred's face begins to change again, grotesquely contorting as
text: he races into the vortex. His tormented SCREAM blends with
text: the howling SIREN of the police car gaining on him.
