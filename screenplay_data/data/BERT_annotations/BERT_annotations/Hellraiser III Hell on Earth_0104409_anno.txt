scene_heading: EXT. DERELICT STREET TWILIGHT
dialog: 
text: Night is falling in a forgotten part of the city.
dialog: 
text: The street-lights are a joke - three out of four are dead.
text: Only a large moon and some cloud-streaked stars illuminate this
text: dark and derelict street.
dialog: 
text: Once the hub of an industrial area, now the buildings are
text: abandoned, the sidewalks choked with litter and debris. Stores
text: are boarded-up, windows are glassless, walls are graffitied.
dialog: 
text: At various points, several BUMS warm their hands at trash-can
dialog: fires.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON TWO BUMS
dialog: 
text: - as their eyes move, following something moving down the
text: street. Heard OFF is the sound of a smooth and powerful
dialog: engine.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON STREET
dialog: 
text: Down this boulevard of decay and despair drives an
text: incongruously expensive car - a Range Rover. A rich kid is
dialog: going shopping.
dialog: 
text: The car cruises the ruins until it pulls up outside the only
text: open store on the block.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON STORE
dialog: 
text: A dim light bulb shines within - the only indicator that the
text: store is still trading. Its windows are grimy, its door
text: defaced. Above the door - barely legible through the accrued
text: dirt of city years - a sign; CARDUCCI'S ANTIQUES AND CURIOS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON CAR
dialog: 
text: The side door opens - helped on its way by the kick of an
text: expensive leather boot - and JP MONROE steps out.
dialog: 
text: JP is 24, rich, handsome, and spoiled. His hair is slick with
text: designer-grease, his slim frame is wrapped in a $600 leather
dialog: jacket.
dialog: 
text: For a moment he surveys the store and casts contemptuous
text: glances up and down the ruined street. He shows no anxiety at
text: being in this twilight part of town. Cocooned in the
dialog: confidence of wealth, he's never felt threatened in his life.
text: Satisfied he's in the right place, he walks confidently through
text: the doorway.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CARDUCCI'S ANTIQUES NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The store itself looks like an antique - old wood panelling and
text: shelving, Victorian display cases, and faded wallpaper. It is
text: grimy, dusty, and dimly-lit - and apparently unattended.
dialog: 
text: It is packed with merchandise - shelves and aisles overflow
text: onto the floor making the place a maze to walk through.
dialog: 
text: The stock is a strange surreal mix. Discarded items from 50's
text: America (Norge fridges, toasters, Frankie Lymon albums) share
text: space with older items; framed pictures, Victorian automata,
dialog: wax dolls, and (a specialty of the store?) items of punishment;
dialog: stocks, iron boots, chastity belts, whips. Could that really
text: be an Electric Chair glimpsed in the shadowed back of the room?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON JP
dialog: 
text: He wanders through the merchandise, casting appraising glances
text: at some items. Some he even runs his hands over - grimacing at
text: the dust and grime they leave on his fingers. But his manner
text: suggests he is looking for something specific.
dialog: 
text: Near the room's center is an old hoarding from the dead days of
text: vaudeville and travelling shows. It is tall and broad and is
text: leaning against something behind it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON HOARDING
dialog: 
text: - which is colorfully and garishly decorated and full of
text: hyperbolic come-ons to long-dead punters:
dialog: 
text: YOU WILL BE AMAZED! THEY SHOULDN'T BE ALIVE! FREAKS OF NATURE!
text: AN EDUCATIONAL SHOW FOR ALL THE FAMILY PRESENTED UNDER THE
scene_heading: AUSPICES OF PROFESSOR EMMANUEL BOCKLIN, TRAGEDIAN AND
scene_heading: MENAGERIST.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON JP
dialog: 
text: - as he moves the hoarding aside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: Wow ...
dialog: 
text: REVEALED is a six-foot tall black rectangular pillar, covered
text: in beautifully detailed 3-D carvings all in the same matt-black
text: finish as the pillar itself. The pillar is extremely bizarre,
text: as if a New York avant-garde sculptor has interpreted a Totem
text: Pole for jaded modern tastes. The carvings are of dead rats,
text: copulating skeletons, filigree-patterned boxes, and faces.
dialog: 
text: One of these faces - recognizable to the audience but not to JP
text: - is the ossified visage of PINHEAD, the demon from the first
text: two HELLRAISER pictures.
dialog: 
dialog: 3
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON JP
dialog: 
text: - as he leans in to study this face, already fascinated by its
text: calm cruelty and promise of dark wisdom.
dialog: 
text: A voice OFF startles him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUM
dialog: You want it?
dialog: 
text: JP whirls round in shock. A BUM is standing close to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON BUM
dialog: 
text: He has long matted black hair and a similarly greasy beard.
text: His eyes are a piercing, excited blue. Otherwise he is
text: indistinguishable from those we saw on the street outside Â–
text: ragged, tatty clothes, features blackened with grime.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON JP
dialog: 
text: - as he glances round the store and past the bum to the door
dialog: beyond; has this character just wandered in from the street?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: Is it yours?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON BOTH
dialog: 
text: The Bum smiles, shaking his head knowingly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUM
dialog: No. Not mine. Yours.
dialog: 
text: JP nods, still a little uncertain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: How much do you want for it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUM
dialog: Whatever you think its worth.
dialog: 
text: JP digs a hand into his back pocket and pulls out a wad of
text: cash. Without counting or checking, he proffers it.
dialog: 
text: The Bum's hand flies out and siezes JP's, pressing the money
text: between their palms, making the exchange into a handclasp.
dialog: 
text: In the background, OUT OF FOCUS, is Pinhead's face on the
dialog: pillar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUM (OFF)
dialog: Enjoy ...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 4
dialog: 
text: The FOCUS switches so that the hands in foreground BLUR and
text: Pinhead's frozen face becomes SHARP, as if he is silently
dialog: watching this deal take place.
dialog: 
text: The Bum's hand moves away with the money as we

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: It's a mystery to me ...
dialog: 
scene_heading: SMASH-CUT to full-frame VIDEO IMAGE image of JOANNE
text: SUMMERSKILL, standing and looking directly into camera, as if
text: we are watching a TV broadcast. In shot behind her is a quiet
dialog: hospital Emergency Room - no patients, no staff, just beds and
dialog: intensive-care equipment.
dialog: 
text: Joanne - or JOEY, as she prefers to be called - is 23 years
text: old, an attractive and clever brunette, with a quiet sadness in
text: her eyes that she usually manages to keep almost hidden.
dialog: 
text: Dressed in the stylish but sedate garb of a TV newsperson, she
text: holds a microphone marked with the logo of her station, W-QQY.
dialog: 
text: Her direct address to the unseen TV camera continues.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Most nights this inner-city Emergency
text: Room would be a chaos of blood and panic
dialog: and grace under pressure. But tonight,
dialog: as you see, it's like Death took a
dialog: holiday. It's a mystery to me ... A
dialog: mystery how those assholes at
dialog: Assignments knew it. This is Joey
text: Summerskill for W-QQY. Emergency Room.
dialog: No story. Really, really pissed off.
dialog: 
text: Despite the nature of her last few words, Joey has ironically
text: kept up the manner and delivery of a newscaster. Now, she
text: breaks mood, looks away from the camera, and, with a dismissive
text: wave of the hand, begins to walk out of shot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Ah, break it down, Doc. It's a bust.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO WIDE
dialog: 
dialog: - to reveal that we are not watching a broadcast at all but
text: are in the ER in real time. As well as Joey, the room contains
text: her cameraman ("DOC" FISHER) and an ER NURSE.
dialog: 5
dialog: 
text: Doc - a 45 year old with a weight problem, a nicotine
text: addiction, and a cynical attitude - lowers a shoulder-mounted
text: Video camera and watches Joey walk to a water-cooler against a
text: wall. His expression is a mix of exasperation and sympathy.
dialog: 
text: The Nurse is a middle-aged woman of Asian ancestry. She has a
text: puzzled expression as she addresses Doc.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: She can talk like this on television?
dialog: She can say this thing? This assholes?
dialog: 
text: Doc replies but keeps his eyes on Joey as he crosses to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: No sweat, sweetheart. It's for the
dialog: European satellite .... Joey; rein it
dialog: in, kid. They couldn't've known.
dialog: 
text: Joey sucks angrily at water from a paper-cup and then crushes
text: and bins the cup like an act of revenge.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: I know. I know. But it's just so ...
dialog: neat, isn't it? The first gig that
dialog: isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's
dialog: taken away from me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Yeah, well like you said - it's a
dialog: mystery. But that's all it is.
dialog: Mystery. Not malice. What, you think
dialog: the station paid off every accident
dialog: victim in the city to ... ?
dialog: 
text: Doc is interrupted by the RINGING of a cell-phone he has
text: holstered at his waist. He picks it up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Speak.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CELLPHONE
dialog: Doc. 24th and Cedar. Fast. Hostage
dialog: situation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: OK. Listen - Joey's here. Shall ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CELLPHONE
dialog: No need. Martin's already there.
dialog: Hurry. You've got ambulances to beat.
dialog: 
text: The line goes dead. Doc looks at Joey. She heard it all. He
text: shrugs apologetically.
dialog: 
dialog: 6
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Better hurry, Doc. A real story. With
dialog: a real reporter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Joey .... Look, you wanna ride? I can
dialog: go by your place.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: You'd lose the money-shots. No. I'll
dialog: catch a bus. Or a cab. Don't worry
dialog: about it. Go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: OK. Be careful. And lighten up. Story
dialog: of your life could be right round the
dialog: corner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: That is the story of my life.
dialog: 
text: With a rueful smile, Joey watches Doc leave.
dialog: 
text: Joey and the Nurse exchange glances - Joey's impassive but
text: vaguely friendly, the Nurse's a little disapproving; if the
dialog: camera's gone, what the hell are YOU still doing here?
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Joey makes her solitary way along a medium-length corridor
text: that has two sets of double swing doors at either end, one set
text: giving on to the ER, the other toward an exit. Joey is heading
text: for the latter, her mood sad and defeated.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON EXIT DOORS
dialog: 
text: Suddenly - SMASH! - the doors burst open from the other side.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON CORRIDOR
dialog: 
text: The mood is suddenly fast and urgent as a gurney is wheeled
text: rapidly through the doors.
dialog: 
text: Two PARAMEDICS, both male, both about Joey's age, are pushing
text: the gurney at a run and talking rapidly to each other. They
text: completely ignore Joey and also ignore the TEENAGE GIRL who is
text: running beside the gurney.
dialog: 
text: The girl - TERRI - is 18 or 19. She is a pale-faced blonde
text: dressed as if for a Desperately-Seeking-Susan party and is
text: keeping up a stream of chatter as if rehearsing excuses.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 7
dialog: 
text: As Joey flattens herself against the corridor wall to let them
text: pass, it is neither the paramedics nor Terri that get her
text: attention. It is the BOY on the gurney.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON GURNEY/BOY
dialog: 
text: The teenage boy lies flat on his back semi-conscious, his
text: eyelids fluttering, his breathing shallow.
dialog: 
text: Horribly, shockingly, dangling from his face and body are long,
text: heavy chains that drag and rattle along the corridor floor.
text: There are at least sixteen of them and they seem firmly buried
text: in his skin.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON CORRIDOR
dialog: 
text: The DIALOGUE as the gurney is rushed to the ER doors is RAPID-
text: FIRE and OVERLAPPED, the Paramedics responding only to each
text: other and ignoring the two girls comments and questions.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: It wasn't my fault. It wasn't my fault.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC 1
dialog: 10 milligram IV Valium stat. How the
dialog: fuck did this happen ... ?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
text: It was outside. I wasn't even with him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC 2
dialog: You ever see anything like this before?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
text: He must have stolen it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: What's going on?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC 1
dialog: Yeah, sure. Five times a fucking day.
dialog: Just push!
dialog: 
text: Once the gurney has passed her, Joey runs along behind it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
text: It was off the statue. In the club.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: What happened to him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC 2
dialog: Think they'll get him back?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 8
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: It's nothing to do with me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC 1
dialog: Worst case of status I've seen. Even
dialog: money at best.
dialog: 
text: The foot of the gurney slams into the ER doors and the
text: Paramedics slide it rapidly through.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Wait! I'm a reporter! Tell me where he
dialog: was ...
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON ER THROUGH DOORS
dialog: 
text: The Nurse and a middle-aged DOCTOR are seen through the doors
text: preparing emergency equipment. The Doctor already has
text: fibrillator pads in his hands.
dialog: 
text: The Paramedics follow the gurney through and, turning rapidly,
text: push the doors closed from the inside.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON CORRIDOR
dialog: 
text: Joey and Terri are alone, excluded from the ER activity. Joey
text: turns to speak but Terri is already halfway to the other doors.
dialog: 
text: Joey runs after her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Hold on. Hold on, please. I need
dialog: talk to you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: (over her shoulder)
dialog: It's nothing to do with me. I wasn't
text: even with him.
dialog: 
text: Joey catches up with her a couple of yards short of the doors.
text: She grabs at her arm to slow her down.
dialog: 
text: Terri turns, snatching her arm away in a sudden moment of fierce
text: anger. She backs toward the doors, making gestures of
text: dismissal and denial with her hands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Look, lady! I told you! It's not my
dialog: problem! I was just there!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Where?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 9
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Under The Underground. Can I like GO
dialog: now?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Under the Underground? What's that?
dialog: Where is ...
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, the conversation is interrupted by a shatteringly
text: loud SCREAM, agonized and terrified, coming from the ER.
dialog: 
text: Both girls freeze but then their reactions are very different:
text: Joey turns instantly and runs back toward the ER. Terri
text: watches her for a beat and then heads through the other doors.
dialog: 
text: The SCREAM continues, a howling horrible sound.
dialog: 
text: Joey reaches the ER doors and throws them open. And freezes in
text: terrified shock.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. EMERGENCY ROOM NIGHT
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE DOCTOR
dialog: 
text: - is on the floor, as if flung there by some powerful force.
text: The fibrillator pads are still in his hands and his expression
text: is awe-struck and disbelieving.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE NURSE
dialog: 
text: - is cowering behind a mobile tray of surgical instruments,
text: muttering to herself and making the gesture of the cross.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE TWO PARAMEDICS
dialog: 
text: - are flattened against the far wall, terror on their faces.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON TABLE
dialog: 
text: The Boy is on the emergency table. It's him that's screaming.
text: His body is arched tight in shock, eyes and mouth wide open.
dialog: 
text: He's wired up to an ECG and the MONITOR shows a heartbeat that
dialog: should be measured on the Richter scale.
dialog: 
text: The chains - all still connected to his face and his body Â– are
text: rigid and tight, being pulled straight up into the air as if
text: tugged taut by invisible hands.
dialog: 
text: The boy's skin is stretched and pulled at those points where
text: the chains are connected to him and it seems horribly possible
text: that his flesh will burst if the pressure continues.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 10
dialog: 
text: The scene is held for a terrible frozen moment. Then suddenly
text: the chains drop, the scream stops, and the boy's body slumps.
dialog: 
text: There is a massive ELECTRICAL SURGE. The ECG flat-lines before
text: it and the other monitors go haywire, sparking and spluttering.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO WIDE
dialog: 
text: The lights in the room flicker and strobe.
dialog: 
text: The fibrillator pads arc angrily. The Doctor flings them away.
dialog: 
text: ELECTRIC ENERGY seems to run along the slumped chains and they
text: disappear as if dissolved in some impossible electric meltdown.
dialog: 
text: Lighting and machinery return to normal (ECG still flat-lining)
text: and the medical staff stare thunder-struck at the dead boy.
dialog: 
text: For the first time, the other people in the ER become aware of
text: Joey's presence in the doorway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Who's that? Get her out of here!
dialog: 
text: The Nurse heads for the doors. Joey is already backing away.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE THROUGH DOORS INTO CORRIDOR
dialog: 
text: - as Joey backs away, an expression of numbed shock on her
text: face. The doors close over, blocking her out.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON FIBRILLATOR PADS
dialog: 
text: - still arcing.

dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON JOEY
dialog: 
text: - glancing at the light from her seat.
dialog: 
scene_heading: JOEY'S POV - VARIOUS ANGLES
dialog: 
text: The bus is almost deserted. Three other passengers - A PUNK, A
text: BAG LADY, and A WINO - are spread out around the interior. All
text: seem lost in worlds of their own but their vacant alienated
text: stares highlight Joey's isolation and tension. Fear has
dialog: entered her life.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 11
dialog: 
text: The bus moves through the neon-lit loneliness of downtown
dialog: streets.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON JOEY
dialog: 
text: - her face, lit by reflected store-signs and street-lights, is
text: lost and distant, as if she is submerged in some dream-sea of
dialog: memory and sadness.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TV STATION, EDITING SUITE DAY
dialog: 
text: A wall of TV monitors, each monitor showing Joey sitting on a
text: couch with a painfully thin older woman - BRITTANY VERTUE.
dialog: 
text: Brittany's probably 50 but her face is as tight and smooth as
text: surgery can make it. She is dressed in the standard uniform of
text: the health-avatar; brightly-colored leotard over black tights.
dialog: 
text: Joey has a big paperback book - BEYOND HUNGER; THE BRITTANY
text: VERTUE GUIDE TO HOLISTIC DIETING - which she holds to camera.
text: She smiles and, turning to face Brittany, crosses her legs.
dialog: 
text: The image freezes. And replays. Joey crosses her legs again.
dialog: And again. And again.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO WIDE
dialog: 
text: Joey (in real time) is sitting in an easy chair in the editing
text: suite looking at the wall of monitors.
dialog: 
text: BRAD, a techie in his late-twenties, and DOC FISHER are in
text: swivel chairs immediately in front of the video console.
dialog: 
text: All three are drinking coffee. Doc is smoking a cigarette.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: (guardedly)
dialog: What do you mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: I mean hardly any thigh. I'm telling
dialog: you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on

speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Fuck you.

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: C'mon, Joey. I'm just trying to help
dialog: you hit a home run here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Yeah? Well, you just struck out. It
dialog: may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I
dialog: want to do it the right way. Not tight
text: skirts. Tight stories.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Right. Like last night's doozie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: I know what I saw.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: And I believe what you say. But this is
dialog: TV. No pictures, no story.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Yeah, too bad I had to go and ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: ... and cover something on Planet Earth.
dialog: See, you gotta remember, Joey; this is a
dialog: LOCAL station. As in local to this
dialog: galaxy.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: There's a story out there.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: (jumping in warningly)
dialog: Not on station time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: No. Not on station time. My story. My

dialog: 
text: Joey exits. Brad watches her leave with a half-smile on his
text: face then turns to Doc.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Lot of attitude there, Doc ...
dialog: 
text: He starts up the video tape again and, on the monitors, Joey
text: once again crosses her legs on the couch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: ... but great legs.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDER THE UNDERGROUND NIGHT
dialog: 
text: CLOSE on a screaming male face, twisted as in pain or fury.
dialog: 
text: PULL BACK rapidly to REVEAL the face belongs to the lead singer
text: of THANATOS. He is on a nightclub stage with the rest of the
text: band, all of them dressed in that shit-poor-white-trash-on-dope
text: look favored by all such rich young businessmen with guitars.
dialog: 
text: A tatty banner across the back of the stage proclaims: UNDER
text: THE UNDERGROUND PRESENTS THANATOS.
dialog: 
text: The SCREAM ends, replaced with the roaring thunder of drums and
text: guitars as Thanatos kick into some thrash-metal.
dialog: 
text: The dance-floor of the club is packed with KIDS dancing to the
text: incredibly fast, incredibly loud music.
dialog: 
dialog: Many of the kids favor the same look as the band but it's not
text: exclusive; college types are there too, along with some Â– male
text: and female - sporting the glitz-meets-sleaze look of Terri.
dialog: 
text: The club itself is of course dimly-lit and the basic decor is
dialog: black. Where it is distinguished from hundreds of others is in
text: the bizarre sculptures and pieces of artwork that hang from the
text: ceiling and walls, all in tones of black, silver and gray:
dialog: 
scene_heading: VARIOUS ANGLES ON SCULPTURES
dialog: 
text: A headless, armless torso wrapped in barbed wire.
dialog: 
text: A pair of male and female heads. Bonsai-like trees grow out of
text: every orifice - eye-sockets, nostrils, ears, and mouths.
dialog: 
dialog: 14
dialog: 
text: A human arm with the skin and flesh of its upper half peeled
text: open and pinned out to reveal inside - instead of bone and
text: sinew - an entire miniature metropolis, beautifully detailed.
dialog: 
text: A black bird cage containing a fetal skeleton.
dialog: 
scene_heading: VARIOUS ANGLES ON CLUB
dialog: 
text: Kids also crowd the bar and the tables on the outskirts of the
text: dance floor. It is a hot, sweaty, faintly aggressive
text: atmosphere - people jostling for position, shouting to be
dialog: heard, etc etc.
dialog: 
text: The camera finds Joey - incongruous by dress and demeanor Â–
text: pushing her way among the crowd.
dialog: 
text: The music is too loud and overpowering to hear Joey's voice but
text: it is clear as she moves through the confines of the club that
text: she is approaching various people and enquiring after Terri.
dialog: 
text: FOUR KIDS AT A TABLE
dialog: 
text: - shake their heads and shrug.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: A PUNK
dialog: 
text: - stares blankly and blinks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TWO BIMBOS
dialog: 
text: - giggle, purse their lips, shake their heads.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: 
text: - catches sight of a blonde figure moving across the dance
text: floor and pushes through the crowd to follow. She taps the
text: figure's arm but, as it turns, she realizes it is a man Â– some
text: 70's revivalist GLITTER-ROCKER. He looks quizzically at her.
dialog: 
text: Joey's mouth moves and this time she seems to get some
text: response. The Glitter-Rocker mouths a name.
dialog: 
text: Joey can't hear him. She hands him a business card and a pen.
dialog: 
text: He scrawls a name on the back of the card and Joey nods her
text: thanks as he moves on.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE ANGLE ON CARD
dialog:

speaker_heading: ANGLE ON BAR

text: who looks at it, nods, and puts it beneath the counter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON EXIT
dialog: 
text: - as Joey makes her way out.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON DANCE FLOOR
dialog: 
text: Camera moves into the tightly-packed throng on the dance floor,
text: making its way slowly toward the previously unseen center.
dialog: 
text: The crowd parts slightly to reveal, in the direct center of the
text: floor, the tall black pillar from the opening sequence.
dialog: 
text: The pillar is mounted on a plinth and spins as the clientele
text: dance around it. It seems very in keeping with the decor of
text: the club but even so it is a strong unsettling presence.
dialog: 
text: The pillar has been mounted upside down, so that it looks even
text: odder than our first glimpse of it. Near the bottom the
text: inverted face of Pinhead, black and frozen, can be seen.
dialog: 
text: The camera begins to spin around the pillar in contrary motion
text: to the pillar's own movement and, as it does so, draws closer
text: and closer making for a disorienting, vertiginous image.
dialog: 
text: As this happens, the raucous sound of the band Thanatos begins
text: to fade into a whirl of ECHO and to be replaced by a whirring,
dialog: spinning, sound which we only recognize fully as we
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DENSE JUNGLE DAY (JOEY'S DREAM)
dialog: 
text: The screen is filled with dense jungle foliage.
dialog: 
text: The chugging spinning sound is now identifiable as the sound of
text: Helicopter blades, one element of a SOUND MONTAGE conveying the
text: sense and feel of a Jungle War; Helicopters in flight, machine
text: gun fire, distant explosions, confused shouts and cries.
dialog: 
text: A POV camera pushes its way through the lush, humid greenery.
dialog: 
text: The camera seems to be searching for something, glancing this
text: way and that, shoving leaves and tall grass aside.
dialog: 
text: Voices begin to emerge clearly from the SOUND MASS off-screen
text: as if the unseen seeker is getting nearer to his or her goal.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER 2
dialog: (off)
dialog: Don't die, man! Don't fucking die!
dialog: 
text: The dialogue prompts a more furious effort on the part of the
text: POV camera. Pushing frantically through the obscuring foliage,
text: it finally gains a clearer view and stops, looking ahead.
dialog: 
text: In a tiny clearing, ten feet from the camera, still partially
text: obscured by the jungle, two camouflage-clad SOLDIERS lean over
text: the prone body of a third. It is unclear due to distance but
text: there is a lot of blood on the Soldier's body and uniform.
dialog: 
text: A new sound joins the SOUND MONTAGE - a persistent, rhythmic,
text: ringing sound. The other elements die away until only this is
text: left and we recognize it as the sound of a telephone as we
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM, JOEY'S APARTMENT NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Joey jerks upright in bed as the ringing continues. Confused
text: and disoriented, her eyes fly around her darkened bedroom as if
text: she's trying to understand where she is and what is happening.
dialog: 
text: Finally, she registers the phone and leans toward her bedside
text: table to pick it up.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON BEDSIDE TABLE

text: phone. Its warm green figures show the time is 2:35.

dialog: God. This better be birth, marriage, or

scene_heading: ANGLE ON JOEY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Uh-huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: Uh ... Hi! Is this ... er ... Joanne
dialog: Summerskill?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Joey. Yeah, who is this?

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: You like ... left me a card? At the
dialog: club?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Right. Right!
dialog: 
text: Joey swings out of bed to sit on the edge, much more alert now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: I want to talk to you. We met ... now,
dialog: listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at
dialog: the hospital last night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Oh yeah. Yeah. Well ... Look, I'll
dialog: make a deal with you ... My boyfriend
dialog: threw me out, right? I'll trade you.
dialog: You give me couch-space. I'll give you
dialog: talk. OK?
dialog: 
text: Joey can't resist another glance at the clock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Yeah. Sure. You mean ... tonight?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
text: (Surprised at Joey's surprise.
dialog: Bit of a culture clash here)
dialog: Of course tonight. Is that a problem?
dialog: Like, if you've got a guy there or
dialog: something ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: No. No. It's fine. Come now. I was
dialog: having bad dreams anyway.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: CLOSE on the front door of the apartment as it opens to reveal
text: Terri leaning against the doorframe.
dialog: 
text: Clad identically to how we last saw her, Terri clutches a well-
text: stuffed leather bag, containing all her worldly possessions.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Hi. How're you doing?
dialog: 
text: Not waiting for either reply or invitation, she moves forward.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO WIDE
dialog: 18
dialog: 
text: - as Terri walks past the dressing-gowned Joey and heads
text: straight for Joey's sofa and sprawls on it, laying her bag on
text: the floor beside her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: You got anything to drink?
dialog: 
text: Joey closes the door, raised eyebrows registering her slight
text: disapproval at Terri's cavalier attitude. Her voice, however,
dialog: is polite.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: I put some decaf on. Er ... make
dialog: yourself comfortable.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Right.
dialog: 
text: Joey walks past Terri and through to her kitchen, from where we
text: hear the sound of COFFEE BEING POURED.
dialog: 
text: Terri looks around at Joey's room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: VARIOUS ANGLES ON ROOM
dialog: 
text: The large and spacious room suggests that even if Joey is
text: dissatisfied with her job she's at least being paid enough to
text: make it bearable. The room is very ordered, very neat, but
text: stops short of being prissy.
dialog: 
text: A very large picture window takes up all of one wall. At the
text: moment of course the drapes are closed. Another wall is taken
text: up by a huge shelf unit packed with books, videos, and CDs.
text: Joey's obsession with "getting the whole story" seems to be
dialog: true of her personal life as well as her professional.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON TERRI
dialog: 
text: - having finished her quick examination, she calls out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: So ... what was your bad dream?
dialog: 
text: Joey re-enters, carrying two mugs of coffee.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Your dream. You said you were having a
dialog: bad dream.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Oh yeah ...
dialog: 
dialog: 19
dialog: 
text: She hands one coffee to Terri and sits opposite her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: ... well, I've been having it for years.
dialog: It's not a nightmare or anything. It's
dialog: ... well, I know what it is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: What is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Why are you so interested?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: No. No, it's OK. I ... It's my father.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: (sympathetic, knowing)
dialog: Oh, right. Did he used to ... ?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: God, no! Nothing like that. No, he
dialog: died before I was born. He died in
dialog: Vietnam. I never knew him. Never met
dialog: him. We don't even know the details. I
dialog: dream of battlefields. Of searching.
dialog: Of trying to find out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: That's great.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: No ... I mean, it's not like great about
dialog: your dad or anything. It's just I don't
dialog: dream. Never have. ... Maybe it'd help
dialog: if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ...
dialog: No, so it's always neat for me to hear
dialog: about dreams. I'm jealous. It's like
dialog: everybody has another world except me.
dialog: You know what I mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: I know what you're saying but ... Never?
dialog: You've never had a dream? No, you know,
dialog: you do. You must. What you mean is you
dialog: don't remember them.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 20
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Whatever. All I know is - this is it
dialog: for me. Just me, my bag, and a series
dialog: of shithead boyfriends. It'd be good to
dialog: see something else. Have a nighttime
dialog: life. Be somebody different.
dialog: 
text: Terri pauses, then smiles like she's just realized something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Hey ... this is great, isn't it? Just
dialog: girls talking. Like having a
dialog: conversation? Good coffee. You got a
dialog: cigarette?
dialog: 
text: Joey waits, letting herself catch up with Terri's good-natured
text: but marginally strung-out personality. She looks around the
text: room as if trying to remember where there are cigarettes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Uh ... yeah. Yeah, somewhere. Wait a
dialog: minute.
dialog: 
text: Joey crosses to the big shelf-unit and pulls out a concealed
text: pack of cigarettes, a Zippo lighter, and an ashtray from behind
text: a shelf of videos. We notice that the videos are THE WORLD AT
text: WAR, volumes 1 thru 26. She brings the smokes to Terri.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Great. Thanks. You gonna have one?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: I'm trying to quit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Oh, go on. Have one. Fuck it. You
dialog: think you're going to live forever?
dialog: 
text: She smiles and proffers the pack to Joey who shrugs, smiles,
text: and takes one. Terri picks up the Zippo and sparks it. A huge
text: FLAME leaps out of the lighter, producing an instant of terror
text: from Terri. Joey pulls the lighter back from Terri and closes
text: the lid extinguishing the flame. Terri draws a book of matches
text: from her pocket shakily attempts to light her cigarette.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Sorry. It was my father's. It's
dialog: temperamental.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: It's okay. It's just someone burned me
dialog: once.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 21
dialog: 
text: Joey takes the book of matches from Terri's hands and lights
text: both cigarettes. Terri takes a long, fearful look at the
text: burning flame and then takes a deep, calming drag of her
dialog: cigarette.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Wanna know how I look at it? Way I see
dialog: it is ... you give up, right? Three
dialog: days later, you get hit by a fucking
dialog: truck and you know - you just KNOW Â–
dialog: that your last thought as you go under
dialog: those wheels'd be "Jesus H. Christ, I
dialog: coulda smoked another three packs!"
dialog: 
text: She lays the book of matches down. Joey's eyes go to them.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON MATCHES
dialog: 
text: Black letters on the dark-grey cover: UNDER THE UNDERGROUND.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON JOEY AND TERRI
dialog: 
text: Terri's eyes flick to the match-book and her mood changes,
text: becoming subdued and a little sullen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Oh. You wanna talk about that stuff.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Yes I do. Terri, something awful
dialog: happened to that boy. I have to find
dialog: out what it was.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: But I don't know anything! Really. I
dialog: just came out of the club and the kid
dialog: was already in the street. He ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Did you know him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: No. I'd seen him in there a few times
dialog: before. He was just a punk. I'd never
dialog: like danced with him or anything.
dialog: Anyway, he was a thief. He must've
text: taken it from the statue.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Taken what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: The thing! He was lying there in the
text: street, moaning. But he pointed at it
dialog: ...
dialog: 22
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Wait a minute. He was already ...
dialog: wounded ... when you found him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Yeah! That's what I'm saying! And it
text: was lying next to him. And he pointed
dialog: at it before he passed out and ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Wait. Wait. The chains. Where did the
dialog: chains come from?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: That's what I'm trying to tell you! ...
dialog: 
text: Terri rummages in her bag, getting hold of something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: He said they came out of this.
dialog: 
text: She holds her hand out and the camera TRACKS in to meet it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON TERRI'S HAND/BOX
dialog: 
text: Resting on her palm is a black cube about 4 inches square. It
text: has the same matt-black carbonized look as the pillar and is
text: recognizable as one of the "carvings" we saw on it.
dialog: 
text: There is fine filigree pattern-work over each of its surfaces
text: and, to audiences familiar with the HELLRAISER movies, the box
text: is recognizable despite its black coating; it is the Lament
text: Configuration, the puzzle box that opens the doors to Hell.
dialog: 
text: There is a stubby shard of material protruding from one side of
text: the box - presumably where the boy from ER had broken it off
dialog: the pillar. Camera favors this jagged shard as we
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CROSS-FADE TO
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDER THE UNDERGROUND NIGHT
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON PILLAR
dialog: 
text: VERY CLOSE on its upper left section. We are looking at a hole
text: in the pillar that matches the pattern of the shard on the Box.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO WIDE
dialog: 
text: The club is empty. The dim lighting of working hours has been
text: replaced with the sickly gleam of one or two fluorescent tubes
text: and the club has that eerie not-quite-right look that all night
dialog: places have when subjected to a harsher light.
dialog: 
dialog: 23
dialog: 
text: Two WORKERS are in the final stages of clearing the night's
text: debris - emptying trash into big black plastic bags, wiping
dialog: down tables and bars etc.
dialog: 
text: Work completed, they head to the main exit.
dialog: 
text: One of them hits the light switches so that the fluorescent
text: clarity is again replaced by the more appropriate dim lighting.
text: The other shouts across the apparently deserted club.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WORKER
dialog: All done, Mr. Monroe.
dialog: 
text: They stand a second but no response comes. The first turns to
text: the second and shrugs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WORKER
dialog: (mouthing silently)
dialog: Ass hole.
dialog: 
text: His co-worker grins and they let themselves out.
dialog: 
text: A beat. Another door opens into the club and JP Monroe Â– the
text: club's owner and the man we saw buy the pillar - walks into
text: the main room of the club from his private room at the back.
dialog: 
text: JP walks out into the shadowed darkness of his small kingdom.
text: He describes a circle around the dance floor, throwing glances
text: at his odd sculptures, and finally walks into the center of the
text: room to stand before the pride of his collection, the pillar.
dialog: 
text: The pillar of course is stationary at this time, though it is
text: still mounted upside down.
dialog: 
text: JP smiles possessively at the pillar - and then registers the
text: mutilation where the Box has been ripped away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: What the ... ?
dialog: 
text: He leans in closer to stare at the hole.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, jarringly, there is a quiet but distinct SQUEAK that
text: seems to come from within the hole.
dialog: 
text: JP starts back a little, a small expression of anxiety on his
text: normally supercilious face. He glances to right and left, gets
text: a grip, and leans forward again.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON PILLAR/HOLE
dialog: 
text: - as, again, the noise comes. Is it a squeak - or is it the
text: creaking shifting of hidden machinery, hidden chains?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 24
dialog: 
text: JP's hand moves tentatively into shot, approaching the hole.
text: Slowly, slowly, it reaches wrist-deep into the blackness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON JP
dialog: 
text: VERY CLOSE on JP's face - quizzical, enquiring ... and suddenly
dialog: contorted in pain!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: Aaaaaahh!!
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON PILLAR/HOLE
dialog: 
text: - as JP's hand whips out of the hole, shaking in shock and
text: pain. A rat is hanging on to one of JP's fingers, its sharp
dialog: teeth buried in the flesh!
dialog: 
text: JP swings his arm violently through the air, dislodging the rat
text: with the force of his swing. A spray of blood is seen to come
text: from JP's wounded finger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON RAT
dialog: 
text: - as it lands heavily in a shadowed corner of the club and
text: scurries away deeper into the darkness, squeaking furiously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON JP

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP

text: VERY CLOSE. Blood seeps from the tiny teeth marks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: (off)
dialog: ... bi ...
dialog: 
text: JP's voice is cut off by a strange SIZZLING NOISE heard OFF.
dialog: 
text: JP's face moves up to look at the pillar. A look of awe and
text: shock crosses his face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON PILLAR
dialog: 
text: Some small drops of blood stand out bright red on the blackness
text: of the pillar. The sizzling noise is coming from them.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly the drops draw together magically into one large ruby
dialog: of blood - already larger than possibility would allow. Then
text: it gets wierder; the blood suddenly dissipates into six or
text: seven little rivulets that begin to run down the pillar.
dialog: 25
dialog: 
text: The streams of blood don't simply fall straight. They seem to
text: follow some pre-gouged pattern, running down the pillar tracing
text: the blackened organic contours of the carvings.
dialog: 
text: They all culminate at the point of Pinhead's chin - and then
text: separate again, running over his frozen black face along the
text: carved scar lines that make a matrix across his features.
dialog: 
text: When every canal line on the demon's face is filled neatly with
text: blood, a BLUE LIGHT seems to glow from within the pillar
text: through Pinhead's face, giving it temporarily the blue tone he
dialog: had enjoyed in (un)life.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON JP
dialog: 
text: CLOSE on his awe-struck face - bathed in reflected blue light.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON PINHEAD

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: (looking to right and pointing)
dialog: Who's that?
dialog: 
text: On the flat roof of a nearby building, a RETARDED TEENAGE BOY
text: sits motionless in an old rusty deck chair next to a small
text: Jerry-built pigeon coop. Its door is open and it is empty.
dialog: 
text: The boy is some distance from the girls but his solitude, his
text: stillness, and the empty coop beside him lend the scene an
text: atmosphere of sadness and loss.
dialog: 
text: As Joey tells his story, we INTERCUT between the POV of the
text: roof and the girls at the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: I don't know his name ... I saw the
text: whole story. A wounded bird was on his
dialog: roof. I could hear its cries from here.
dialog: He went straight to it. I couldn't've.
dialog: I'd be frozen between pity and fear.
text: But he wasn't. Its pain spoke directly
text: to him. He picked it up. Nursed it.
dialog: Fed it. And it got better. Everyday
dialog: he'd watch the pigeon. Everyday the
dialog: pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn.
dialog: Learn that there was one more thing he
dialog: had to do to make the rescue complete.
dialog: And one day, just as afternoon became
text: evening, he leaned over, opened the
dialog: cage, and walked away. Didn't look
text: back. But he heard the sound of its
dialog: wings.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: And he still sits there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Every day.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: No. He knows it won't. It was his
text: final act of love and part of him knows
text: that and part of him doesn't yet.

speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: What? I wasn't talking about ... I ...
dialog: Do you want to stay? You want to stay

dialog:

dialog: 
text: Joey crosses to the TV, picks up the Box and weighs it in her
dialog: hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: OK. OK. It's a done deal. But look Â–
dialog: you have to help me. I've got to solve
dialog: this thing. I've got to know what's

dialog: 
text: Terri follows across the room and sits on the sofa.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: But I don't know what's going on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Maybe not. But you know more than I do.
dialog: You know something about this box.
dialog: Something about a statue?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Yeah. I found it. I knew held like it
dialog: and I figured ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Woah. Wait a minute. Who? The kid?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: No. JP. My last boyfriend? He like

dialog: I was downtown looking for a ... a

dialog: Pillar. Thing. I knew he'd love it.
dialog: You've seen the club.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Would you know this store again?

speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Sure. Why?

scene_heading: EXT. DERELICT STREET DAY
dialog: 
text: Joey's Mazda 323 drives down the street.
dialog: 
text: The daylight street is still creepy but in a different way; No
text: bums, no trash-can fires, nothing. It has the feel of a ghost
text: town, as if nothing has breathed here for years.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE IN CAR
dialog: 
text: Joey, at the wheel, has a disbelieving look on her face.
dialog: 
text: Terri, smoking, flicks ash through her wound-down window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Jesus. Are you sure this is the street?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Yeah. Happening, isn't it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: What on earth were you doing down here?
dialog: 
text: An evasive silence.

speaker_heading: JOEY

speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: For somebody else, alright? Not for me.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI

dialog: 
text: Joey brings the car to a halt outside the antique store.

speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Yeah. See. I told you it was here.

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CARDUCCIÂ’S ANTIQUES DAY
dialog: 
text: Joey and Terri enter the store.
dialog: 
text: The store is different, its selection of merchandise reduced.
text: The 50's and 60's junk hardware is still there, along with some
text: of the more mundane Victoriana, but it seems more "normal" Â–
text: none of the odd items of punishment memorabilia are there.
dialog: 
text: Also, because it is daylight, the store seems merely old,
text: interesting, and musty, not creepy or odd.
dialog: 
text: There seems to be no-one in attendance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON GIRLS
dialog: 
text: - as they walk through the store.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAMA
dialog: (off)
dialog: Can I help?
dialog: 
text: The voice startles the girls and they jump around to face the
text: counter as MAMA CARDUCCI moves into view from beneath it.
dialog: 
text: Mama, an ancient and slightly eccentric Italian-American woman
text: eyes the girls with the suspicion of somebody who hasn't had a
text: customer in decades. Not aggressive, just surprised.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 32
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Yes. Thank you. We were wondering ...
dialog: Terri, show her the box.
dialog: 
text: Terri removes the box from her purse and holds it up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAMA
dialog: No. Sorry. Not interested. Not for my
dialog: customers. Have you tried ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: No. No, you don't understand. We're
dialog: not selling it. It came from here. We
dialog: want ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAMA
dialog: Everything sold as is. No guarantees.
dialog: No returns.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: No. We want ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAMA
dialog: I took back everything bought on a whim,
dialog: I'd have no business. I ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Lady, will you shut the fuck up and give
text: her a break.
dialog: 
text: A sudden silence. Both Mama and Joey stare at Terri in
dialog: surprise.
dialog: 
text: Mama looks back at Joey.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAMA
dialog: Quite a mouth. So what's the problem?
dialog: You tell me. You I like.
dialog: 
text: Joey smiles. Terri raises her eyes to heaven. Mama waits.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Thank you. This came off a ... statue?
dialog: A pillar. We wondered if you knew
dialog: anything about the piece. About where
dialog: it came from.
dialog: 
text: Mama squints at the box, as if trying to recognize it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAMA
dialog: Oh ... yeah. Yeah. That thing. Ugly.
dialog: Real ugly. I sold that?
dialog: 
text: Mama's eyes scan the store.
dialog: 
dialog: 33
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAMA
dialog: Never mind. I'm glad it's gone. Made
dialog: the store feel strange. Who'd make such
dialog: a thing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Fine. Fine. But can you tell us
dialog: anything about it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAMA
dialog: It was part of a job-lot. Some loony-
text: bin they shut down. Unclaimed stuff.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: What else came with it? Anything still
dialog: here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAMA
dialog: Sure. Just papers, photos. Stuff
dialog: nobody'd ever want.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Can we see?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAMA
dialog: You gonna buy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: I don't know. Maybe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAMA
dialog: Right at the back there. Middle
dialog: shelves. Coupla folders. Nice stuff.
dialog: I'd do you a good price.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON REAR OF STORE
dialog: 
text: Joey and Terri approach an old shelf unit along the rear wall.
dialog: 
text: A shaft of sunlight throws a square of light on the wooden
text: floor a few yards in front of the shelves.
dialog: 
text: Joey takes up a big bulging manilla folder from the shelves and
text: begins to look through it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Terri, check out the other folder.
dialog: 
text: Terri, still holding her purse and the box, looks around for
text: somewhere to put them. All the shelves are full. She lays
text: them on the floor in the square of sunlight and joins Joey at
text: the shelves, grabbing up the second folder.
dialog: 
dialog: 34
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: What am I looking for?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: God knows. Anything. Contacts. Clues.
dialog: 
text: Terri opens up the folder and begins to pace the floor as she
text: flicks through the contents.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Jesus. You're gonna pay her for this
dialog: shit? It's like fucking business papers
dialog: for God's sake!
dialog: 
text: Bored, Terri wanders off to lean against another shelf-unit.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE OVER JOEY'S SHOULDER ON FOLDER
dialog: 
text: - as she flicks through the contents.
dialog: 
text: Terri's dismissive summary seems justified. All Joey sees are
text: obscure and meaningless case-notes and paperwork. Each item is
text: letter-headed THE CHANNARD INSTITUTE.
dialog: 
text: Joey's hand reaches a large envelope. Scrawled in hand across
text: it is the phrase DR. CHANNARD - PERSONAL PAPERS. Joey draws
text: the contents out and begins to sift through them.
dialog: 
text: The first item is a dusty, black-and-white photograph of an
text: officer in English Army uniform, circa 1920. Joey blows the
text: dust from the photo.
dialog: 
scene_heading: LOW ANGLE - ON BOX
dialog: 
text: - which sits on the floor in the shaft of sunlight, the dust
text: from the photo settling next to it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON JOEY
dialog: 
text: The next photo is that of a beautiful young woman. Joey flips
text: it over. Gummed on the back is a type-written slip that says
scene_heading: COTTON, KIRSTY CASE NO. 5719.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON BOX
dialog: 
text: The sounds of the girls flicking through papers is heard OFF
text: and then FADES as something strange begins to happen.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, the dust around the box begins to move as if blown by
text: an invisible wind. It is drawn up so that it forms an
text: impossible spiral in the air. Spinning like a miniature
text: hurricane, it hovers over the box. The sunlight seems to grow
text: brighter. Is it just reflections on the metalwork designs or
text: is the box itself glowing and shining?
dialog: 
dialog: 35
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE ANGLE ON JOEY'S FACE
dialog: 
text: - as her eyes flick back and forth as she scans ...
dialog: 
text: Joey turns another item and her face registers surprise at what
dialog: she is seeing ...
dialog: 
text: The next item in the folder is a Xerox sheet, a reproduction of
text: what appears to be an ancient document.
dialog: 
text: It is a diagram, like a designer's drawing or plan. And it is
text: of the box seen from various angles.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE ANGLE ON JOEY'S FACE
dialog: 
text: - as she realizes what she is looking at.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Alright ...
dialog: 
text: Joey turns, folder in hand, to look at the box on the floor and
dialog: compare it to the diagram.
dialog: 
text: Joey gasps.
dialog: 
text: The miniature tornado of spiralling dust suddenly disappears
text: inside the apparently sealed box as if sucked down into it.
dialog: 
text: As if on cue, the shaft of sunlight disappears behind a cloud
text: as the last particle of dust disappears into the box.
dialog: 
text: Joey, mouth open in shock, lets the folder drop from her hand.
text: The sound of its splayed contents hitting the floor alerts
text: Terri, who walks back round from the other shelf unit.
dialog: 
text: Terri looks at the dropped contents and then up at Joey.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Joey ... ?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: (still staring at Box)
dialog: Help me pick 'em up, Terri. I think
dialog: the lady just made a sale.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT. EARLY EVENING
dialog: 
text: Joey is sitting behind a desk. She has a phone in one hand and
text: a pen in the other.
dialog: 
text: Spread out over the desk are various documents - the photo of
dialog: Kirsty, the diagram of the box, type-written transcripts etc -
text: and a scratch-pad on which Joey has scrawled several numbers.
dialog: 36
dialog: 
text: Joey is in mid-conversation on the phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Yeah ... yeah ... yeah ... No, it's
dialog: important that I speak to ... What? No,
dialog: don't ... (a beat) Put.
dialog: Me. On. Hold. You. Stupid. Bitch.
dialog: 
text: Joey slams the phone down.
dialog: 
text: She stares at the papers, at the scratch pad, takes a deep
text: breath, and punches out a number on the phone.
dialog: 
text: This time Joey's voice is different.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Hi. Now listen. And listen good. I'm
dialog: the Station Manager at W-QQY. For the
dialog: last half-hour you've been dicking
dialog: around with my assistant. Let me tell
dialog: you something. With or without your co-
dialog: operation we are making this expose. I
dialog: assume you're smart enough to guess
dialog: which version is going to make you look
dialog: good. Now, if you can't put one hand on
dialog: that cassette and the other on a FedEx
text: man's butt within thirty seconds then
dialog: you damn well better put me through to
dialog: somebody who can.
dialog: 
text: A pause while somebody jumps through hoops at the other end.
dialog: 
text: Joey's voice transmogrifies again; now it's a seductive,
text: persuasive purr.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Dr. Fallon? How nice of you to take my
dialog: call. I understand you're in charge of
dialog: video archive from the Channard
dialog: Institute ... ?

dialog: Another night in Under The Underground
dialog: 
dialog: Kids dance.
dialog: 
text: Customers jostle at the bar.
dialog: 
text: Couples neck in shadowed corners.
dialog: 
text: Loud Metal music blasts out from speakers next to the various
text: sculptures on the walls and ceiling.
dialog: 
dialog: 37
dialog: 
text: The center of the dance-floor is packed.
dialog: 
text: The pillar is missing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON BAR
dialog: 
text: Sitting alone at a bar stool - though surrounded by tightly-
text: packed customers - is SANDY, a very pretty teenage girl. She
text: is the same basic type as Terri; blonde, frail, young. Too
text: young, in fact, to be legally in a club like this.
dialog: 
text: Sandy stares at her empty glass - and stares at it wistfully
dialog: enough to suggest she doesn't have the money to get it
text: refilled. She is trying to keep up a cool impassive face but
text: her eyes betray her basically vulnerable character.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
dialog: 
text: Sitting at the opposite end of the bar, his eye-line confirming
text: he is looking at Sandy, is JP Monroe.
dialog: 
text: The bar-stool beside JP is occupied by a TEENAGE BOY who has
text: his back to the bar and is talking to a GROUP of his FRIENDS.
dialog: 
text: JP has a speculative, predatory look on his face. Without
text: shifting his gaze, he raises his hand and within seconds the
text: BARMAN is leaning over to hear his request.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE on Sandy as a full glass is placed in front of her. Laid
text: alongside the glass is a beautiful long-stemmed red rose.
dialog: 
text: Sandy looks surprised at the drink and then smiles in delight
text: at the rose. She raises her eyes and looks across the bar.
dialog: 
text: JP returns the smile.
dialog: 
text: He turns to the Boy beside him and murmurs something unheard.
dialog: 
text: The boy glances round, as if ready to argue with whoever is
text: speaking to him. On recognizing JP, however, he vacates the
text: seat without an argument and stands to join his friends.
dialog: 
text: JP looks back across the bar at Sandy and gestures at the empty
text: stool beside him, an attractive welcoming smile on his face.
dialog: 
text: Sandy gets up and, carrying the drink and the rose, makes her
text: way across to sit beside JP.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON JP AND SANDY
dialog: 
text: The deafening music playing in the club means that they have to
text: lean in close to hear each other speak.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: Welcome.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: You're JP Monroe, right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: Uh-huh.

speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: And this is your club. Great club. I

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Thank you for the drink. And the rose.
dialog: Wow. That's ... really nice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: It's yours. You won it. It's a prize.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: A prize? For what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: You see, everyday I have my friend John
dialog: here bring ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: The barman? I thought he was called
dialog: Rick?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: He's a barman. Whatever. Do you mind
dialog: if I continue?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: I'm sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: Everyday I have my friend Rick here
text: bring a newly-cut red rose in with him
dialog: and keep it behind the bar. And I award
dialog: it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Oh come on. There're lots of girls here
dialog: who look better than ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: Don't do that! Don't put yourself down.
dialog: If you have a quality, be proud of it...
dialog: 
text: While talking, and without taking his eyes off Sandy, JP
text: gestures at the barman and their glasses.
dialog: 
dialog: 39
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: ... Let it define you. Whatever it is.
text: Most of the roses die behind the bar.
dialog: This is the first I've given out for
dialog: nearly a month.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: No. Really?
dialog: 
text: Two full glasses join the still half-full ones on the bar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP

dialog: 
text: - except they're not there. The two bar-stools are empty.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JP'S PRIVATE ROOM NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The music OFF from the club is dull and muffled.
dialog: 
text: JP1s private room is the size - and shares the general
text: appearance of - an expensive studio apartment.
dialog: 
text: His room looks like an annex to his club - black walls, black
text: fittings, artworks of elegant cruelty - show that JP's taste
dialog: for the bizarre is not just professional.
dialog: 
text: Camera explores the room as the sound of BREATHING grows OFF.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON PILLAR
dialog: 
text: - now the right way up, it stands in a corner of the room. As
text: usual, it looks jarring and impressive but it doesn't really
text: seem out of place in JP's room.
dialog: 
text: The Breathing OFF becomes mixed with MOANS and SMALL CRIES.
dialog: 
dialog: 40
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON BED
dialog: 
text: JP and Sandy, both naked, are on the bed making love. Well,
text: maybe Sandy's making love. JP's having sex.
dialog: 
text: It is a selfish, phallocentric scene, concentrating on JP's
text: concern only for his own gratification. It may be an erotic
dialog: sight, but it's not a pretty one.
dialog: 
text: JP is on top. He has hold of both Sandy's wrists in one of his
text: hands and his body is working away rhythmically. He is half-
text: upright, looking down at her. No kissing.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE on JP's face - his eyes open, staring down at Sandy.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE on Sandy's face - her eyes closed, half in pleasure, half
dialog: in shame.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SMASH-CUT TO PILLAR
dialog: 
text: CLOSE on Pinhead's face. Suddenly, horribly, the monster's
text: eyes fly open and his frozen face stares down at the lovers. A
text: BLUE LIGHT seems to pulse from within the pillar, lending color
text: to Pinhead's face.
dialog: 
text: Pinhead continues to watch the love-making until it comes to a
dialog: climax.
dialog: 
text: As JP GROANS out his orgasm and collapses forward onto Sandy's
text: body, Pinhead's eyes close. The BLUE LIGHT disappears and the
text: pillar is just the pillar again.

speaker_heading: ANGLE ON DESK

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JOEY'S BEDROOM NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Joey enters the darkened room - and then stops a few feet from
text: the door.
dialog: 
text: Terri - lit only by the moonlight through the blinds - is lying
text: on one side of Joey's bed fast asleep. Apart from her shoes,
text: which she has kicked off, she is fully dressed.
dialog: 
text: Joey approaches the bed and watches her sleeping friend, her
text: face sympathetic, affectionate, and troubled.
dialog: 
text: Joey reaches over, takes one of the pillows from the other side
text: of the bed, and lays it at the bottom end.
dialog: 
dialog: 42
dialog: 
text: She slips off her shoes, shrugs off her jacket, and -
text: delicately, carefully - climbs on to the other side of the bed,

text: JP, on his bed in his shorts enjoying a post-coital cigarette,
text: blows smoke-rings at the ceiling and all but ignores Sandy.
dialog: 
text: Sandy has put some of her clothes back on and is wandering
text: around the room, admiring it and chattering.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: So cool ...
dialog: 
text: She approaches the pillar ... leans in close ... closer ... and
dialog: ... nothing happens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Radical.
dialog: 
text: She walks on to look at a painting on one of the walls.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON PAINTING
dialog: 
text: It's a painstakingly rendered but crudely imagined piece. The
dialog: kind of crap you'd buy in a Melrose gallery.
dialog: 
text: Perhaps it's called Biker Crucifixion. Night-time, somewhere
text: rural. A Hell's Angel, arms outstretched and stripped to the
text: waist, is tied to a tree by cruelly-tight barbed wire wrapped
text: around his body. At the foot of the tree his biker friends
text: party, drink, and fuck, Harleys parked in the distance. The
text: crucified Angel's eyes are raised to the Moon. He's smiling.
dialog: 
text: WIDER ANGLE ON SANDY AND PAINTING
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Wow. You've got great taste. This ...
dialog: well ... this really says it, you know?
dialog: It's really ... dark.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON JP
dialog: 
text: Still staring at the ceiling, JP pulls a pained face - like
dialog: he's heard this embarrassing shit a hundred times.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Don't you think?
dialog: 
dialog: 43
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
speaker_heading: Mmn-hmnn.
dialog: 
text: Sandy turns to look at JP, troubled by his unresponsiveness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Do you mind me talking about your stuff?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: Unh-unh.
dialog: 
text: A beat. Sandy stares at JP. JP stares at the ceiling.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: If it bothers you, just say so.
dialog: 
text: JP sighs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: It doesn't bother me. I'm just not
dialog: interested.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Oh. Like I'm not an interesting person.
dialog: 
text: JP blows a smoke ring at the ceiling.
dialog: 
text: Sandy walks back across the room to stand at the foot of the
dialog: bed. ( And yes, fright fans, this does put her in front of the
text: pillar - though hopefully the blossoming argument will distract
dialog: audience attention.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: But you gave me a rose ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody
dialog: else. Get dressed. Get out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: You shit. Who do you think you are?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch.
dialog: Now get the fuck out of my life.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: You ... I can't fucking believe you, you
dialog: bastard! You get me in here ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: Right. Like you were hog-tied or
dialog: something.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 44
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Look at you! You think you're some God
dialog: damn Prince or something. With your
dialog: shitty little Kingdom out there and all
dialog: this ugly shi ....
dialog: 
text: Sandy is waving her arms to illustrate her point and, halfway
text: through her last line, has turned to indicate the pillar.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly - BAM! BIG SCARE MOMENT! - two blackened arms fly out
text: from the center of the pillar and grab Sandy's gesturing arms.
dialog: 
text: The BLUE LIGHT burns from within, illuminating Pinhead's face
text: as his eyes open, filled with demonic glee and hunger.
dialog: 
text: An impossible WIND begins to whistle through the room, as if an
text: echoed glimpse of a storm in Hell.
dialog: 
text: Sandy screams in mortal terror.
dialog: 
text: JP jumps from the bed, cigarette falling to the floor. He
text: backs away to the opposite wall, face shocked, scared shitless.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: Jesus Christ!
dialog: 
text: Pinhead smiles sardonically.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: Not quite.
dialog: 
text: Pinhead's arms pull Sandy tight against the pillar and his
text: face, stifling her scream.
dialog: 
text: JP flattened against the far wall, watches in horror as Sandy,
text: held tight against the pillar, suffers a horrible death:
dialog: 
text: Sandy's life-force is sucked from her. Drawn into the pillar.
text: Into Pinhead.
dialog: 
text: It is a matter of seconds only but, in those few seconds -
dialog: 
text: Her body begins to collapse in on itself, turning grey and
text: lifeless. It is made worse by the fact that until the very end
text: Sandy keeps struggling, writhing in the grasp of the monster.
dialog: 
text: The wind keeps blowing through the room.
dialog: 
text: Finally, a dry lifeless husk, she is dropped to the floor.
dialog: 
text: The Blue Light fades from within the pillar. The wind
dialog: disappears.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 45
dialog: 
text: The pillar is again black and stationary. But its contours are
text: different, more rounded. It looks more organic, as if shifting
text: its raw material into new alignments, new configurations. The
text: pillar seems to be in a process of becoming. And the obvious
text: suggestion is that what it is becoming is Pinhead.
dialog: 
text: Pinhead's head, arms, and torso now protrude from the pillar.
text: They are not completely free and - now that the "eating" of
dialog: Sandy is concluded - seem incapable of independent movement but
text: there is plainly a lot more of him than there was before.
dialog: 
text: Even though the blue light has faded, Pinhead's face is
text: noticeably different. It is blue-tinged and more fleshy in
dialog: appearance. Capable of movement. And speech.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON JP
dialog: 
text: - who has sunk to the floor, staring at the pillar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: What ... What ... ?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: What did you see? The same as I.
dialog: Appetite sated. Desire indulged. You
dialog: saw the working of the world in
dialog: miniature.
dialog: 
text: JP shakes his head in denial. But he's already a little more
dialog: together than he was: after all, the pillar can't move and he's
text: several yards from it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: That had nothing to do with the world.
dialog: Not this one, anyway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: On the contrary. It has everything to
dialog: do with the world. And our dreams of
dialog: how it will succumb to us. You enjoyed
dialog: the girl?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: Good. So did I. And that's all ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: No! No. It's not the same ... I ...
dialog: No. What you did ... it was ... evil.
dialog: 
text: Pinhead laughs.
dialog: 46
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: How uncomfortable that word must feel on
dialog: your lips. Evil. Good. There is no
dialog: Good, Monroe. There is no Evil. There
dialog: is only the flesh and the patterns to
dialog: which we can submit it. You will help
dialog: me to ...
dialog: 
text: JP shakes his head in furious denial.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: No. No no no. No fuckin' way. I'm
dialog: gone ...
dialog: 
text: Grabbing at his jeans, JP heads out of his room. Rapidly.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREETS, OUTSIDE CLUB NEXT DAY
dialog: 
text: The sun is high. It's about noon.
dialog: 
text: Like most clubs of its type, Under The Underground's exterior
text: is far from prepossessing. It's set in an old brick warehouse
text: in a run-down section of town.
dialog: 
text: JP's Range Rover pulls up and JP gets out, carrying a long slim
text: black bag. He glances round the all-but-deserted street and
text: enters the club.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JP'S PRIVATE ROOM DAY
dialog: 
text: CLOSE on Pinhead's face; in repose, back to its statue-like
dialog: state.
dialog: 
text: The sound of the door OFF opens the monster's eyes.
dialog: 
text: JP enters, closing the door behind him.
dialog: 
text: He doesn't look at the pillar. He stays by the door and keeps
text: his eyes on the long black bag he has brought in with him.
dialog: 
text: He unzips it. His manner is that of a man who has made a
text: decision and is not about to listen to contrary argument.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: (off)
dialog: Another offering?
dialog: 
text: JP doesn't respond. He draws a double-barrelled shotgun from
text: the bag, cocks it, and loads it.
dialog: 
text: JP turns to face the pillar, drawing a bead on Pinhead.
dialog: 
text: Pinhead's expression is wearily amused.
dialog: 47
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: I'm touched ... That is the gun you used
dialog: to kill your parents?
dialog: 
text: JP visibly staggers as Pinhead lets slip this knowledge.
dialog: 
text: Pinhead smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: I understand. Their fortune was so
dialog: tempting, their affection so
dialog: conditional. What else could you do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: Fuck you!
dialog: 
text: He pulls the double trigger.
dialog: 
text: A massive BLAST resounds around the room but that's about it;
text: the 30 ott six is absorbed magically into the pillar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: Thank you. Now, shall we talk sensibly?
dialog: 
text: JP lets the useless gun fall from his hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: Don't flee from yourself. If you have a
dialog: quality, let it define you. Cultivate
dialog: it. It is you. By helping me, you will
dialog: help yourse...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: What!? What are you talking about? Why
dialog: should I help you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: Because you want to. You've always
dialog: wanted to. Look at your pictures. Look
dialog: at your sculptures. Look at those
dialog: tawdry representations and then ...
dialog: Imagine. Imagine a world of the body as
dialog: canvas. The body as clay. Your will
text: and mine as the brush and the knife.
dialog: Oh, I have such sights to show you.
dialog: 
text: It's working. JP's eyes are glittering with excited interest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: What are you?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 48
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: A dark star rising. I was bound to
dialog: another's system by a soul I once
dialog: possessed. A friend relieved me of that
dialog: inconvenience. Now I'm free. Born
dialog: again of Blood and Desire.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: Hey, that's what makes the world go
dialog: round.
dialog: 
text: Pinhead raises an amused eyebrow at JP's little joke.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: You see, we're not so dissimilar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: But how in God's name ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: God? My God was diamond and black
dialog: light. And I was his Dark Pope. All
text: that is changed. A terrible beauty is
dialog: born. With a place at my right hand for
dialog: a man of your tastes.
dialog: 
text: JP cruises the room, contemplating this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: How do we start?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
text: It has already begun.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TV STATION, EDITING SUITE NIGHT
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON MONITORS
dialog: 
text: Many screens fill the frame, all of them crackling with snow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO WIDE
dialog: 
text: Joey is alone at the control desk. She has a video tape in her
text: hand and feeds it into the master machine.
dialog: 
text: She looks up at the still-ghosting monitors and then presses a
text: few buttons on the console.
dialog: 
text: The snow is replaced by blackness on every monitor with a time
text: code ticking away at the bottom of each screen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Alright ... Let's see what we got here.
dialog: 49
dialog: 
text: The blackness on the monitors gives way to multiple images of
text: KIRSTY, the girl in the picture in the antique store.
dialog: 
text: The video image is primitive, shot with a non-professional
text: camcorder, and is a simple medium long-shot of Kirsty, dressed
text: in a simple white smock, sitting in a hospital room.
dialog: 
text: Kirsty addresses the camera directly, though occasionally looks
text: up to the side as if speaking to an unseen doctor.
dialog: 
text: INTERCUT through Kirsty's monologue between: A single monitor
text: image, the wall of monitors, and the watching and listening
dialog: Joey.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRSTY
dialog: (on video)
dialog: I don't know what the Box is. But I
dialog: know what it does. I ... (looks up
dialog: to side) I've said all this before.
text: Do you ... (blinks, nods, as if
dialog: listening. Looks back to camera) I saw
text: it open. I opened it. I saw what came
dialog: out. I don't know what else to call
text: them. Demons. Demons live in the box.
dialog: Or come through the box from somewhere
dialog: else. It's a gateway to Hell. Or the
text: South Bronx. (smiles ruefully at her
text: own joke. Looks up to side as if
text: chastised for kidding around. Nods.
dialog: Continues) I know you don't believe
dialog: me. I know what it sounds like. But
dialog: what else ... Jesus, talk to Ronson,
text: talk to the other cops. They saw the
dialog: house. They saw my ... my father ...
dialog: 
text: Kirsty breaks down into sobs.
dialog: 
scene_heading: QUICK-CUT TO JOEY
dialog: 
text: - whose expression shows distressed sympathy. She too has
dialog: lost her father.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON MONITORS
dialog: 
text: The video image breaks up into white noise and then comes back
text: in, as if the camcorder was turned off for a few moments.
dialog: 
text: When the image returns, Kirsty is smoking a cigarette to help
dialog: calm her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 50
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRSTY
dialog: (on video)
dialog: Solving the puzzle means opening the
text: box. Opening the box means opening
dialog: doors. And there are some doors you
dialog: don't want to open. And it may be
dialog: metaphorical to you, Doctor, but you
dialog: haven't had some blue-faced bastard come
dialog: at you with hooks and chains. It isn't
dialog: delusion, it isn't psychosis. It's
dialog: reality. It's reality. (Pause.
dialog: Long drag on the cigarette?) Maybe not
dialog: this reality ... but there are others.
dialog: I've seen them.
dialog: 
text: Joey's face shows horrified fascination at Kirsty's story.
text: There is a conviction in the telling which is working on Joey.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The room is dimly-lit.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON FLOOR BY TV SET
dialog: 
text: The floor is littered with video-boxes and tapes. Other tapes
text: are piled on top of the VCR. It's like somebody has been
text: viewing constantly for a week and hasn't put anything away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON SOFA AND COFFEE TABLE
dialog: 
text: Many books are lying on the sofa, the table, and the floor.
text: Some are lying open, most are closed.
dialog: 
text: Also on the coffee table are three different soft-drink cans, a
text: half- empty cup of coffee, and a very full ash-tray.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON BOOKSHELFS
dialog: 
text: Terri is standing by the bookshelfs, running her eyes and her
dialog: finger along some titles.
dialog: 
text: Now we understand the chaos in the room. Terri's home alone.
text: She's bored and trying to find something to hold her interest.
dialog: 
text: She looks away from the shelves and walks idly over to the TV.
dialog: 
text: The Box is back on top of the TV. Terri's hand hovers near the
text: on/off switch of the TV. Then it hesitates and picks up the
text: box instead. Terri holds the box and looks at it. Her face
text: becomes puzzled and she crosses the room to flick on a LIGHT.
text: She wanders back to the TV looking at the box.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 51
dialog: 
text: It looks different. Its edges are more sharply defined. The
text: shard where it was broken from the pillar is smaller, smoother.
text: The detailed metal-work has some color back and is shining.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Jeez, Joey musta polished you up some.
dialog: Sometimes I think she's wierder than me.
dialog: 
text: Terri's voice trails off as she continues to look at the box.
text: She turns it in her hands, running her fingers over its
text: filigree surfaces.
dialog: 
text: TRACK in slowly as she cups it in both hands, her eyes moving
text: from puzzlement to fascination and concentration.
dialog: 
text: She rubs her thumbs over the designs. TRACKING IN continues.
text: It's tense. Is she going to try and work the puzzle?
dialog: 
text: Suddenly .... BRRRRRRRRR ... the phone rings.
dialog: 
text: Terri jumps in shock, nearly dropping the box.
dialog: 
text: She puts the box back on top of the TV and crosses to the
text: phone. She picks it up.
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. JP'S PRIVATE ROOM NIGHT
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: Really?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Yeah really. I'm ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: No. I mean, really? Because I'm

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: You're apologizing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: Hey, it has been known. C'mon Terri,
dialog: I'm not that bad a guy. I have regrets.
dialog: I'd like to put things right. Don't
dialog: tell me you haven't thought about me.
dialog: Huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Well ... of course I have. I've
dialog: thought. I've ... Oh, JP, you were so
dialog: horrible. You really hurt me ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: I know. I know. It's bad. I'm a bad

speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: I miss you too.

speaker_heading: JP

speaker_heading: TERRI

speaker_heading: TERRI

scene_heading: INT. TV STATION, EDITING SUITE NIGHT
dialog:

dialog: 
text: As Kirsty speaks, INTERCUT between Joey and the monitors.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRSTY
dialog: (Looks to side) Again? (Shrugs. Looks
dialog: back at camera) The box. I don't know
dialog: where it came from. I don't know who
dialog: made it or why. I only know what it
dialog: does. It hurts. It hurts. (Looks off
dialog: to side as if listening.) How? (Looks
dialog: back) I don't know. It kind of opens
dialog: itself. Your fingers move. You learn.
dialog: It wants to open, that's the thing. And
dialog: it knows when you want to open it. And
text: it helps. And it opens. And then they
text: come. The Cenobites. The demons.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON WALL OF MONITORS
dialog: 
text: Multiple images of Kirsty speaking those last few lines.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, one - and only one - of the monitors suffers a WHITE
scene_heading: NOISE WIPE-OUT.
dialog: 
text: Joey glances up at the one ghosting monitor, puzzled - and then
text: freezes in shock.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON MONITORS
dialog: 
text: - as, on the one monitor, a new image suddenly appears:
dialog: 
text: A hazy, black-and-white image (very grainy, like early
text: experimental TV images) of a thirtysomething man in early
dialog: twentieth century military uniform.
dialog: 
dialog: 55
dialog: 
text: The man - ELLIOTT - stares directly out of the monitor screen
text: and, just as Kirsty finishes her last line ("The cenobites. The
text: demons."), he speaks (in an English accent).
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIOTT
dialog: (on monitor)
dialog: She's telling the truth, Joey.
dialog: 
text: Another BURST of WHITE NOISE and the image is gone.
dialog: 
text: Kirsty is back on that monitor, just like all the others.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRSTY
dialog: Look, you can have me tell this ...
dialog: 
text: Joey remains staring at the haunted monitor, numb with shock.
dialog: What the hell is going on?
dialog: 
text: Kirsty's voice plays OFF as Joey stares.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIRSTY
dialog: ... as often as you want. There's not
dialog: going to be any breakthrough. You might
dialog: think it's delusion, but it's not. I

scene_heading: INT. 24-HOUR DINER NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A late-night coffee-shop in the early hours of the morning.
dialog: Classic American Diner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VARIOUS ANGLES
dialog: 
text: Empty booths.
dialog: 
text: A quiet counter. A COP perches on a stool drinking coffee.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: Hey, babe. Thanks for coming.
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Joey enters the unlit main room. She glances across at the
text: sofa. It's unoccupied. Joey puts the light on.
dialog: 
text: She grimaces at the chaos of the room - the piles of videos and
text: books - and crosses the room to the bedroom door. She opens
text: the door and looks in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Terri, we can't bunk up every night!
dialog: People will ...
dialog: 
text: The bedroom is empty, nobody on the bed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: (off)
dialog: ... talk. ... Terri?
dialog: 
text: Joey leaves the door and walks back into the main room.
dialog: 
text: She looks around and then walks over to the phone. Something
text: has caught her eye.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE BY PHONE
dialog: 
text: A hand-scrawled note by the phone reads ENJOY MONTEREY, YOU
speaker_heading: LIAR.
dialog: 
text: JOEY registers the note.
dialog: 57
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Oh shit.
dialog: 
text: Joey shakes her head sadly. What can she do? It's the early
text: hours of the morning. She has no idea where Terri is. She
text: walks back to the bedroom and closes the door behind her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DENSE JUNGLE DAY (JOEY'S DREAM)
dialog: 
text: Thick green jungle foliage obscures the view of a POV camera.
dialog: 
text: The sounds of confused battle are heard OFF; helicopters, gun-
text: fire, distant explosions, screams of the dying and the wounded
dialog: 
text: Leaves and branches SMACK against the frame as the unseen
text: dreamer rushes confusedly through the dense forest.
dialog: 
text: The voices of the Soldiers - distant, echoed, repeated - are
text: heard over the roar of battle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER 1
dialog: (off)
dialog: He's going. He's going. He's going ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER 2
dialog: (off)
dialog: We're losing him. We're losing him.
dialog: We're losing him ...
dialog: 
text: The sound of their voices seems to prompt the POV camera to
text: more furious endeavor.
dialog: 
text: It turns rapidly left and right, forcing its way through the
text: greenery until suddenly, with one last push through foliage
text: thick enough to be a single bush, the view changes completely.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FLANDERS FIELD (WW I) DAY (JOEY'S DREAM)
dialog: 
text: The POV camera (Joey) walks out into another battlefield, one
dialog: of a different character.
dialog: 
text: It appears to be early morning. The skies are grey and
text: overcast. In the distance plumes of black smoke spiral upward
dialog: 
text: No jungle, no trees or grass. The ground is baked mud
text: disfigured with deep trenches, re-inforced by wooden slats.
dialog: 
text: The atmosphere is post-conflict; guns are silent, there are no
text: cries or sound of machinery.
dialog: 
text: Scattered around are corpses of many khaki-clad soldiers.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 58
dialog: 
text: Nothing moves. No birds sing. It is a horrible, desolate
text: image from the bloody pages of history. The fields of Flanders
dialog: in World War One.
dialog: 
text: A noise begins to be heard OFF. A low angry BUZZING.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON DEAD SOLDIER
dialog: 
text: A cloud of buzzing flies are feeding on the flesh of his poor
text: dead face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: (off)
dialog: Noooooooooo .......
dialog: 
text: The buzzing and Joey's anguished cry both CONTINUE OVER as we
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JOEY'S BEDROOM NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Joey sitting up in bed, eyes wide, still screaming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Nooooooooooo!
dialog: 
text: The cry cuts off abruptly as Joey realizes where she is.
dialog: 
text: She catches her breath and then freezes as she realizes that
text: the buzzing sound from her dream is present in her bedroom.
text: Are the flies still feeding? She glances around her room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON BEDROOM TV - JOEY'S POV
dialog: 
text: Her TV set is on. The buzzing sound comes from white noise.
dialog: 
text: Joey is puzzled and scared.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Is somebody here? Is somebody here!?
dialog: Terri ... ?
dialog: 
text: She half gets out of bed and then stops, transfixed, as the TV
text: screen's white noise is replaced by an image.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON TV
dialog: 
text: As in the editing suite, the image is grainy black-and-white.
dialog: 
text: The buzzing continues, now joined by HISSING and WHISTLING that
text: fades in and out as if unseen hands are trying to tune into an
text: impossibly distant station.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 59
dialog: 
text: Somewhere in the sound-montage we can almost hear GHOSTLY
text: VOICES whispering; "Joey, Joey, Joey ... "
dialog: 
text: On the screen, an English Officer - Elliott - is sitting cross-
text: legged on the floor of a Quonset hut.
dialog: 
text: On the floor in front of him is something at which he stares -
text: something that the image is not sharp enough to show.
dialog: 
scene_heading: WIDER ANGLE - JOEY AND TV
dialog: 
text: Fear vies with fascination in Joey's expression.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: What ... What's going on? What's
dialog: happening?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON TV
dialog: 
text: The image disappears in a burst of STATIC which in turn is
text: replaced by another image, still monochrome and grainy; A head-
text: and-shoulders of Elliott, staring directly out of the screen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIOTT
dialog: You have to help me, Joey.
dialog: 
text: A burst of STATIC and the image disappears completely. The TV
text: is obviously not turned on. The room is silent.
dialog: 
text: Joey stares at her dead TV in numbed silence.
dialog: 
text: She falls back into bed, pulling the covers protectively around
text: her, staring at the ceiling.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JP'S PRIVATE ROOM NIGHT
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACKNESS
dialog: 
text: A CLICK is heard OFF and the room is lit, REVEALING JP by the
text: door, his finger by the light-switch. He smiles into the room
text: and walks in, looking behind as Terri hesitates by the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: Come on in.
dialog: 
text: Terri moves past him.
dialog: 
text: JP locks the door with a key he draws from his pocket.
dialog: 
text: Terri registers this. JP calms her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 60
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: Not a good neighborhood. People
dialog: disappear. (a beat) Feel like home?
dialog: It's just like you left it.
dialog: 
text: Terri moves into the room, glancing around herself cautiously.
text: She registers the pillar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON PILLAR
dialog: 
text: It's plainly different from the last time Terri saw it but -
text: despite what the audience knows about it - it still seems
text: inanimate; a black frozen carving, disturbing but harmless.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Not quite. This wasn't here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: No. But, as you can see, I'm having
dialog: some work done on it. You found a real
dialog: treasure for me, Terri. I hope I can
dialog: show you how grateful I am.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it
dialog: up. Put her heart and soul into it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: A girl? Anyone I should know?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: Not now, no. I mean - now that you're
text: here, it's like she doesn't even exist,
dialog: you know what I mean?
dialog: 
text: JP has been cruising the room as they speak. Now he's standing
text: close to the pillar. Terri is still some distance from him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Yeah right. Look ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: Terri, listen. (a beat) Why don't
dialog: you come here and kiss me? I mean, it's
dialog: probably ticking away in both our minds,
dialog: right? Is it going to happen? Isn't it
dialog: going to happen? Let's get it out of
dialog: the way. See how we feel. Then we can
dialog: relax. Talk. You know.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 61
dialog: 
text: A pause - a tense one for the audience who know that JP has
text: obviously decided who Pinhead's next meal is. Terri looks at
text: JP, half suspicious, half attracted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: I don't think so. Not yet. I'm not
dialog: ready yet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: Sure. Sure. I understand. It's cool.
dialog: I mean, we've got all night.
dialog: 
text: JP smiles winningly and warmly. A nice guy. A nice smile. A
dialog: smile a girl can trust.
dialog: 
text: The pillar stands behind him, its dark inhabitant still and
text: silent, waiting for the sacrifice.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDER THE UNDERGROUND NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Series of shots (maybe all CROSS-FADED) of kids dancing and
dialog: drinking in the club to establish the passing of time - and to
text: highlight the tension of the scene in JP's room by its
dialog: proximity to this (relative) normality.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JP'S PRIVATE ROOM NIGHT (MINUTES LATER)
dialog: 
text: JP lounges against his wall, smoking, close to the pillar.
dialog: 
text: Terri is sitting on the bed. She's upset. She's been telling
dialog: JP about Joey and the phone message.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: That's terrible. What a bitch. She was
dialog: obviously just using you, Terri. Ready
dialog: to dump you the second she had what she
dialog: needed, interfering little whore.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: No. It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's
dialog: like I must have done something wrong,
dialog: you know? Freaked her out. Just fucked
dialog: up something good again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me. You
dialog: know that. It was my fault, babe, it
dialog: really was. And you know I'm sorry.
dialog: And I'm sorry to see you upset now. I
dialog: hate to see you in pain like this.
dialog: 
text: Terri looks up at him, her eyes vulnerable, on the verge of
dialog: tears. She really wants to believe that he's being a nice guy.
dialog: 62
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Really?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: Yes! God, yes. I ... I just want to
dialog: hug you. To hold you. To tell you it's
dialog: alright.
dialog: 
text: God, the bastard's good at this. Terri breaks into small sobs
text: and holds her arms out for him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: No. No, sweetheart, you come to me.
dialog: It's not fair. I come over there. You
dialog: know. We're on the bed. I just ...
dialog: 'cos you know how much you excite me.
dialog: God, just looking at you. You're so
dialog: beautiful. I come over there and I'd
dialog: just want to touch you. Feel you. Kiss
dialog: you. And that isn't what this is about.
dialog: C'mon, babe, come to daddy. Let me make
dialog: it better.
dialog: 
text: Terri wipes her eyes, gives a small shy smile and stands up.
dialog: 
text: She's walking toward JP. And the pillar.
dialog: 
text: JP puts a hand out. He smiles. Re-assuring. Loving.
dialog: 
text: Terri walks. Vulnerable. So in need of reassurance and love.
dialog: 
scene_heading: WIDER ANGLE -JP, TERRI, PILLAR
dialog: 
text: She's getting closer ... closer ... closer ...
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE ANGLE ON JP
dialog: 
text: - as he blows it. A sidelong glance at the pillar? A sudden
text: naked hunger in the smiling eyes? A single bead of sweat?
text: Some tiny little thing that takes the lid off his game.
dialog: 
text: Terri stops dead. She doesn't know what's happening but
text: suddenly this doesn't feel right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: No ... Wait a ...
dialog: 
text: EVERYTHING ERUPTS!
dialog: 
text: JP, smiling mask wiped off, leaps at Terri.
dialog: 
text: Terri flings herself backward, screaming in shock and fear.
dialog: 
text: Pinhead: suddenly animate and furious; eyes wide open, face
text: contorted in frustrated rage, black arms clawing at the air.
dialog: 63
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: Bring her to me, boy!
dialog: 
text: A furious, confused scene of tension and struggle.
dialog: 
text: JP has hold of Terri, trying to drag her to the monster.
dialog: 
text: Terri fights back, screaming her disbelief and struggling and
text: kicking against him. They are perilously close to the pillar.
dialog: 
text: Pinhead is furious - roaring, tearing at the pillar with his
text: hands as if trying to physically rip himself. free of it.
dialog: 
text: Slowly, JP's size and strength is telling; Terri is being
text: dragged nearer and nearer to the demon.
dialog: 
text: At the last possible second - when it seems it's all over, when
text: Pinhead's snatching fingers are centimeters from Terri's flesh
text: - Terri snatches up a heavy ornament from a shelf by the pillar
text: and smashes JP right across the head with it.
dialog: 
text: JP collapses semi-conscious at the foot of the pillar.
dialog: 
text: Terri throws herself back from the monster's grabbing arms.
dialog: 
text: Pinhead snarls in frustration, hands clenched in fists of rage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
dialog: 
text: Terri - safely feet away from the pillar - stands, shaking and
text: breathless, eyes wide in horror and shock as she stares at this
text: creature from nightmare.
dialog: 
text: And suddenly Pinhead changes tack; he slides from the roaring
text: beast of a moment before to his more usual persona - the glib,
dialog: articulate Black Pope of Hell.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: Wait! Why run? Where to? Do you know
dialog: where you are?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: I'm ... I'm ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: You're at the door of dreams. And you
text: can open it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: What are you talking about?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
text: There are two keys in this room. On is
dialog: in the pocket of this fool. You could
dialog: take it out without me reaching you. (a
dialog: beat) Probably. And you could use it
dialog: to let yourself back in to the world you
dialog: know. The world you've always known;
text: banal, hopeless, dreamless.
dialog: 
dialog: Pinhead, as ever, is hitting the right buttons. Terri, as we
dialog: know, has dreamed of dreaming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: And ... like ... the other?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: The other is the key to dreams. To a
text: world of black miracles and dark wonder.
dialog: Another life of unknown pleasures. It's
dialog: yours. Complete the pattern. Solve the
dialog: puzzle. Turn the key.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON TERRI
dialog: 
text: - as she looks at the monster. And smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Where is it?
dialog: 
text: Pinhead returns the smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: It's lying bleeding at your feet.
dialog: 
text: JP is on the floor, semi-conscious, bleeding from the head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: (delerious. Ad-lib)
dialog: Unhhh ... Terri ... what ... no ...
dialog: 
text: Terri edges around the pillar to grasp one of JP's limp arms.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INTERCUT CLOSE-UPS OF PINHEAD AND TERRI
dialog: 
text: - as the bond between tempter and tempted is strengthened.
dialog: 
text: Terri holds JP's arm out ...
dialog: 
text: Pinhead stretches his own arm forward ...
dialog: 
text: And JP finally - for one brief second of terrifying clarity -
text: realizes what's happening.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 65
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: No! Terri! Please! I didn't mean to..!!
dialog: 
text: Too late. Pinhead's hand closes around his wrist.
dialog: 
text: Terri leaps back out of harm's way.
dialog: 
text: Pinhead - with awesome strength - yanks JP up to his feet and
text: pulls him close. He stares into the terrified face of JP.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: I have such sights to show you.
dialog: 
text: JP is sucked dry by Pinhead.
dialog: 
text: And Terri watches, her face perversely excited by this - the
dialog: first of the dark miracles that the monster had promised.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR F/X SEQUENCE
dialog: 
text: - as the transformation of pillar into Pinhead is completed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
dialog: 
text: Pinhead, fully-fleshed and incarnate, stands in the room. At
text: his feet are the dry husk that was JP and the steaming, hissing
text: remnants of the pillar like a pool of black toxic oil.
dialog: 
text: He turns and looks at Terri. Slowly, elegantly, he walks
text: toward her.
dialog: 
text: Terri backs away across the room. But she backs off slowly,
text: sensuously, like an eager but nervous virgin bride ready for
dialog: her groom.
dialog: 
text: Camera moves in CLOSE on her glowing eyes and excited face.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: CLOSE on the Box. A cloud of dust spirals out into the room in
text: a reverse action of the dust in the antiques store.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JOEY'S BEDROOM NIGHT
dialog: 
text: CLOSE on Joey's sleeping face. REM shows beneath her eyelids
text: and she murmurs in her sleep.
dialog: 
text: Very faintly OFF is the sound of distant music.
dialog: 
text: Joey's eyes snap open and glance from side to side. She sits
text: up in bed and registers the music, which seems to have grown in
text: volume on her waking.
dialog: 66
dialog: 
text: It is strange, old-fashioned music; A palm-court string
text: orchestra playing a sentimental waltz tune reminiscent of the
dialog: 1920's or earlier.
dialog: 
text: Joey looks around the room.
dialog: 
text: There is no-one in the room.
dialog: 
text: The TV set is still dead.
dialog: 
text: But ... the bedroom door is open a crack and a very strange DIM
text: ORANGE LIGHT is creeping in from the main room. And that seems
text: to be from where the music is coming.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON JOEY
dialog: 
text: - as she gets out of bed.
dialog: 
text: She's cautious and careful, moving slowly and quietly as she
text: wraps a robe around herself and moves to the door.
dialog: 
text: The music continues to play.
dialog: 
text: She opens the door slowly and walks through.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: This room too is empty.
dialog: 
text: The music is louder and the soft warm pulse of the orange light
text: is more distinct, bathing the walls and the furniture.
dialog: 
scene_heading: VARIOUS ANGLES - JOEY'S POV
dialog: 
text: - as Joey tries to locate the source of the music and the
dialog: light;
dialog: 
text: The sofa.
dialog: 
text: The bookshelfs.
dialog: 
text: The TV - with the still and inactive Box.
dialog: 
text: The closed drapes over the big picture window.
dialog: 
dialog: Finally -
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON CLOSET DOOR
dialog: 
text: Both the music and the light seem to be centered on the closet
text: door across the room. They're both coming from behind it.
dialog: 
text: Joey approaches the closet, still tense, still careful. She
text: opens the closet door and looks in.
dialog: 67
dialog: 
text: The closet is where Joey has stored her past. But she's stored
dialog: it neatly.
dialog: 
text: Boxed and piled on shelves are old magazines, old greetings
text: cards, old photographs, old soft-toys, college diplomas,
text: clippings from small-town newspapers ("Death of a Local Hero:
dialog: Tommy Summerskill lost in Vietnam", "Joanne Summerskill Class
dialog: Valedictorian: looks to career in Media") etc etc.
dialog: 
text: Also in there, stuffed away at the top of the closet, is an old
text: radio - a big old wood-and-wire-grille valve driven beauty from
text: which the lilting music is coming.
dialog: 
text: At some stage in its life, part of its casing was smashed away
text: and the pulsing orange light is its flickering vacuum tubes.
dialog: 
text: It's an old mains-powered model and its mains cord dangles off
text: the shelf of the closet. This radio isn't plugged into
dialog: anything except the paranormal.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE on Joey; staring at this broadcast from the beyond.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: How .... ?
dialog: 
text: Joey reaches up and brings the radio down from the shelf and
text: out into the main room. She sets it down on the coffee table
text: in front of the sofa.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE
dialog: 
text: Formal, classical framing from a low angle - Joey and radio in
text: foreground, big picture window and its closed drapes in the
dialog: background.
dialog: 
text: Joey kneels up in front of the table.
dialog: 
text: She stares at the radio with the same kind of trapped
dialog: fascination with which we have seen characters in the previous
text: HELLRAISER movies stare at the Box.
dialog: 
text: Her fingers are drawn to the tuning dial as if to a puzzle.
text: She plays with the dial, moving through various "stations".
dialog: 
text: Joey's face is open with expectation as she moves through them,
text: as if she is waiting for clues. Or instructions.
dialog: 
text: The music gives way to various VOICES;
dialog: 
text: An Indian voice giving some kind of commentary. The English
text: words "BBC" and "World Service" are heard amidst the punjabi.
dialog: 
dialog: (Joey turns the dial)
dialog: 
text: A tired sad English voice;
dialog: 68
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ENGLISH VOICE
dialog: ... and the King has sent a
dialog: personal message of sympathy to the
dialog: parents of those brave men who ...
dialog: 
dialog: (Joey turns the dial)
dialog: 
text: A resonant French voice;
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRENCH VOICE
dialog: L'Oiseau chante avec ses doigts. Deux
dialog: fois.
dialog: 
dialog: (Joey turns the dial)
dialog: 
text: Another burst of music, this time more raucous and syncopated.
text: A ragtime tune from the birth of Jazz.
dialog: 
dialog: (Joey turns the dial)
dialog: 
text: Dead Air. An ominous pause. And Elliott's voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIOTT
dialog: Joey. Look out your window.
dialog: 
text: Joey shrinks back in nervous shock at this direct address.
dialog: 
text: The radio goes dead. The tubes stop glowing. The room is now
text: a dimly-lit place of shadow and suspense.
dialog: 
text: Joey glances back over her shoulder at her closed drapes and
text: then at the silent radio.
dialog: 
text: She stands up slowly and crosses to the drapes. The camera
text: rises and TRACKS in as she walks, framing those drapes like
text: curtains in a theater.
dialog: 
text: With one strong gesture, Joey sweeps the drapes open. And
dialog: gasps.
dialog: 
text: Instead of neighboring roof-tops and a view of the city, Joey
text: is looking directly into the interior of a Quonset hut.
dialog: 
text: It is the image from her TV set though full-size, full-color,
text: and apparently real.
dialog: 
text: At the far end, Elliott sits cross-legged on the floor. In
text: front of him on the floor is the puzzle box.
dialog: 
text: Elsewhere in the hut; A camp-bed on which lie a gun-belt and an
text: Officer's peaked cap. And an old-fashioned radio - the same
text: radio that is still in Joey's room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON JOEY

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Tell me ... Tell me ... Hello?
dialog: 
text: CLOSER on the elements in the hut, as we (and Joey) realize
text: that everything in there is frozen in time. There is no
text: movement, no sound.
dialog: 
text: Wonderingly (but carefully) Joey stretches her arm out before
text: her. When her arm reaches the threshold of the Quonset hut, it
text: disappears into the space once occupied by window glass.
dialog: 
text: She pulls her arm back sharply with an intake of breath. Maybe
text: she even takes a half-step backward.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: I'm seven floors up ... I'm seven floors
dialog: up! I can't ...
dialog: 
dialog: But she can.
dialog: 
text: She summons her courage, steps over the sill, and walks into
dialog: the impossible.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. QUONSET HUT
dialog: 
text: We are looking at a solid wall. Then, through the wall, Joey
text: walks into the Hut, still bewilderment by the sights around
dialog: her.
dialog: 
text: Still the image does not move. Everything is very real, very
text: present. But frozen.
dialog: 
text: Joey approaches the immobile Elliott and looks from him to the
text: box and back again.
dialog: 
text: (NB: Joey's speeches to the frozen Elliott are bravado; her
text: face and body language betray her awed nervousness at the
text: bizarre situation in which she finds herself.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Now what? I'm here. Now what? I just

text: A CREAK is heard OFF. Joey looks up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY'S POV
dialog: 
text: At the far end of the Quonset Hut, behind Elliott, a door has
text: creaked open an inch or two.
dialog: 
text: Joey looks from the door back to the frozen Elliott.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Thanks. I think.
dialog: 
text: Joey crosses to the door and opens it. She walks through.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FLANDERS FIELD DAY
dialog: 
text: Joey walks out onto the World War One battlefield of her most
text: recent dream. She stands there - an incongruous vulnerable
text: figure in her nightdress and robe - amidst the corpses, the
text: trenches, and the distant plumes of smoke.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: What's going on? Is this a dream?
dialog: 
text: She glances back at the door of the hut she has just left.
dialog: 
scene_heading: JOEY'S POV - THROUGH HUT DOOR
dialog: 
text: Within the hut, the frozen Elliott still sits.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON JOEY
dialog: 
text: - as she turns from looking into the hut and gasps, her eyes
text: wide in shock.
dialog: 
text: Standing on a hillock, framed against the grey battlefield
dialog: skies, is Elliott.
dialog: 
text: Joey walks toward him.
dialog: 
text: Elliott stands calmly and smiles at Joey.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIOTT
dialog: Joey. How kind of you to come.
dialog: 
text: A beat. Joey (and the audience) take in Elliott's impossible
text: presence, as she and he stand amidst the corpse-strewn field.
dialog: 
dialog: 71
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Wait ... wait. You ... you have to help
dialog: me. I don't understand. Am I dreaming
dialog: this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIOTT
dialog: You have to help me. You will
dialog: understand. And no, you're not
dialog: dreaming. Do you know where we are?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: It's ... I don't know. First World War,
dialog: right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIOTT
dialog: Correct. The fields of France. And
dialog: many dead flowers ... Oh. Forgive me.
dialog: My name was Spenser. Elliott Spenser.
dialog: Captain.
dialog: 
text: He extends his hand.
dialog: 
text: Joey - slowly and nervously - puts her hand out to shake his.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Joey Summerskill.
dialog: 
text: Elliott smiles understandingly as he releases her hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIOTT
dialog: Well done. Brave girl. You've probably
dialog: never shaken hands with a ghost before,
dialog: am I right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Captain Spenser. Elliott. I ... What
dialog: the Hell is going on?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIOTT
dialog: Hell is precisely what is going on,
dialog: Joey. And we have to stop it. I
dialog: because of a special obligation, you
dialog: because you're the only person who can
dialog: help. And because you know what is
dialog: right, and just, and true. Will you
dialog: walk with me a while?
dialog: 
text: He gestures with his hand and they begin to walk.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 72
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIOTT
dialog: There were days in this war, days right
text: on top of each other, when the newly
dialog: dead were numbered in the tens of
dialog: thousands. They called it the war to
dialog: end all wars. Though it didn't. You
dialog: know that. There were more wars. More
dialog: dead. Your father's war. Your dream
dialog: search for your father led you here. To
dialog: me. Joey, we need to talk.
dialog: 
text: Elliott does nothing dramatic - he doesn't clap his hands or
text: snap his fingers - but somehow, magically, he and Joey, without
text: moving or changing position are back in the Quonset hut.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. QUONSET HUT
dialog: 
text: The frozen Elliott is still sitting on the floor before the
text: box. The mobile Elliott gestures at his frozen self as he
text: speaks to the bemused Joey.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIOTT
dialog: The war pulled poetry out of some of us.
dialog: Others it affected differently. This is
dialog: me a few years later. We're in India,
dialog: by the way, and it's 1921. I was like
text: many survivors. Lost souls with nothing
text: left to believe in but gratification.
dialog: We'd seen God fail, you see. So many
dialog: dead. For us God, too, fell at
dialog: Flanders. We adjusted to the loss. And
dialog: if we mourned, we mourned in silence.
dialog: Thousands drank themselves to death.
dialog: Others went further. I went further. I
dialog: thought I was a lost soul. But, until
dialog: this frozen moment, I didn't even know
dialog: what the phrase meant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: And what is ... this frozen moment?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIOTT
dialog: The cusp of my life. What I was, what I
dialog: am, what I will be ... past, present,
dialog: future, all bound here at this timeless
dialog: moment of decision. I was an explorer
dialog: of forbidden vices and pleasures.
dialog: Opening the Box was my final act of
dialog: exploration, of discovery.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: And what did you discover?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 73
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIOTT
dialog: Something bad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: And why are you back? Why are we here?
dialog: 
text: Again, no signal from Elliott but the background changes
dialog: magically once more;
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FLANDERS FIELD DAY
dialog: 
text: Elliott is once again framed dramatically on the hillock, Joey
text: standing close.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIOTT
dialog: Because something worse is coming.
dialog: 
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: 
dialog: I opened the Box, Joey. I found the
dialog: monster within it. And it found the
dialog: monster within me. For decades I served
dialog: Hell with no memory of my former life
dialog: until a friend released me. You saw
dialog: her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Kirsty Cotton. Yes. But ... if your
dialog: soul was freed, why are you back?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIOTT
dialog: Because - monster as I was - I was bound
dialog: by Laws. The protocol of Hell. The Box
dialog: had to be opened to let me out. The
dialog: truly innocent were safe. That's no
text: longer true. The shell of the beast has
dialog: been fleshed. What I was is out there,
dialog: Joey. In your world. Unbound.
dialog: Unstoppable.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: What will he do? What does he want?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIOTT
dialog: He'll do what he does best. But he'll
dialog: do it unfettered. He wants to walk the
text: Earth forever, indulging his taste for
dialog: all the myriad subtleties of human
dialog: suffering.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: What can we do?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 74
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIOTT
dialog: I like you, Joey. You ask all the right
dialog: questions. There is something we can do
dialog: but it will require great courage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: I don't know ...
dialog: 
text: Elliott reaches out and strokes her cheek. Gently. Lovingly.
text: We see in Joey's eyes that there is a response there. A
dialog: response beyond the comradely.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIOTT
dialog: Joey, you walked through your window
dialog: from one reality to another. You're
dialog: stronger than you think.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Then tell me what to do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIOTT
text: This is his first night on Earth. He
text: wants to close the door behind him.
dialog: Like all Lieutenants, he covets command.
dialog: There's a gateway to Hell through which
dialog: he can be taken back. He has to destroy
dialog: it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: So where is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIOTT
dialog: Your apartment.
dialog: 
text: Joey gasps.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Wha .... ?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIOTT

scene_heading: INT. UNDER THE UNDERGROUND NIGHT
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON DOOR TO JP'S ROOM
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 75
dialog: 
text: The door BLASTS open explosively from within. The pieces of
text: the shattered door FLY across the dance-floor, accompanied by
text: chunks of plaster and brick from the door-surround.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VARIOUS ANGLES (QUICK CUTS)
dialog: 
text: Flying wood and masonry hit people.
dialog: 
text: One chunk SMASHES into the DJ console, bringing the music to a
text: scratching, screeching end.
dialog: 
text: Various SCREAMS are heard OFF through the ensuing silence.
dialog: 
text: In the confusion, kids scramble for the main doorway. Is it a
dialog: bomb? Is it a street-gang attack?
dialog: 
text: The Main Doorway SLAMS supernaturally shut, bolts flying into
text: place untouched by human (or inhuman) hand.
dialog: 
text: Confused and frightened faces turn back to look at the source
dialog: of the explosion.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON DOORWAY TO JP'S ROOM
dialog: 
text: Lit from behind by blinding beams of BLUE LIGHT, Pinhead
text: emerges through the doorway. Slow. Elegant. Terrifying.
dialog: 
text: Pinhead surveys the scene before him and the terrified and awe-
text: struck crowd look back at him.
dialog: 
text: For the most part, the crowd are stunned into silence but there

speaker_heading: CROWD
speaker_heading: (ad-lib)
dialog: Oh My God ...

dialog: Jesus Christ!
dialog: 
dialog: What the FUCK ... ?!
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Pinhead scans the club.
dialog: 
text: He looks at the terrified humans. The cruelly beautiful
dialog: artworks. The humans. The artworks. The humans. The
dialog: artworks.
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The view through the big picture window is entirely normal
text: again; the cityscape by night.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, Joey seems to appear behind the glass - translucent,
text: like a reflection - and comes through the window into her
text: apartment, "solidifying" as she steps in.
dialog: 
text: Her hands are at her head and she staggers forward a few steps.
text: It's as if the enormity of her trip thru realities has just hit
text: her. She falls forward onto the floor of her room, unconscious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FADE IN
dialog: 
text: - as the ringing of a phone grows in volume.
dialog: 
text: Joey raises her head, bleary-eyed, and glances round the room
text: trying to locate the source of the noise that has woken her.
dialog: 
text: She crawls the few feet to the phone and snatches at it. The
text: hand-set falls and she has to gather it up from the floor.
text: Maneuvering herself into a sitting position, she speaks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Hello?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: You wanted a story. You got it. Turn

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREETS, OUTSIDE CLUB NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The images are confusing, with the rapid pans and temporary
text: loss of focus or light that characterise raw news footage.
dialog: 
text: Doc's Camera weaves amongst a mass of uniformed people, trying
text: to catch clear pictures of-what's been happening.
dialog: 
text: Sirens howl, red emergency lights flash.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 77
dialog: 
text: It becomes clear we are looking at the aftermath of a disaster.
dialog: Or a massacre.
dialog: 
text: The club building looks like a bomb hit it. Smoke and debris
text: litter the street. So do corpses.
dialog: 
text: Some of the dead bodies are simply dead bodies. Others -
text: glimpsed fleetingly and tantalizingly as Doc is jostled and
text: bustled - seem to be mutilated decoratively. In fact they bear
dialog: hideous similarities to the artworks that used to grace the
text: club: armless torsos wrapped in barbed wire; flayed limbs with
text: machinery inside instead of muscle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOC

dialog: 
text: Then suddenly a barely-glimpsed movement very close to the side
text: and the camera swings wildly toward it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Shit! What was ...
dialog: 
text: The face of Pinhead, almost lost to the darkness of the alley,

dialog: 
text: The image disappears to darkness, over which Doc's SCREAM of

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANCHORPERSON

text: driving very fast.
dialog: 
text: She has to slam on the brakes at a red light. She pounds at

dialog: 
dialog: 80
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YOUNGER COP
dialog: ... money. What the ... ?
dialog: 
text: The Elder Cop, at the change in his partner's tone, looks up.
dialog: 
text: Standing in the center of the alley at its far end, light
text: coming from behind him so that he is unclear, is Pinhead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELDER COP
dialog: (Calm. Expecting obedience)
dialog: You, fuckoff.

speaker_heading: ELDER COP

dialog: and look at me, boy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YOUNGER COP
dialog: (still looking down alley)
dialog: Hey ...
dialog: 
text: Pinhead is moving up the alley towards the action.
dialog: 
text: Elder Cop shoves Eddie away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELDER COP
dialog: (to Eddie)
dialog: Get lost.
dialog: 
text: Eddie doesn't waste time with questions. He's gone.
dialog: 
text: The Cops straighten up and start walking to meet Pinhead.
dialog: 
text: Pinhead advances- still in the shadows, still just a black
text: shape moving forward.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELDER COP
dialog: I have the distinct impression I told
dialog: you to fuckoff. Unless I miss my guess,
dialog: you've just disobeyed an officer of the
dialog: law.
dialog: 
text: Pinhead emerges into the (dim) light in the alley.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: I am the Law.
dialog: 
text: Cops halt in shock at this awesome presence, both of them
text: instinctively drawing their guns. And both instinctively
text: beginning to back up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELDER COP
dialog: You're one butt-ugly son of a bitch and
dialog: you're about to dead meat.
dialog: 81
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: I am the son of eternal night and you
dialog: are about to discover pain has no
dialog: ending.
dialog: 
dialog: Well, that's enough of a direct threat for any officer of the
text: law. Both cops fire their guns. Once. Twice. Three times.
dialog: 
text: Pinhead keeps walking. He spits out the bullets that his body
dialog: has absorbed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YOUNGER COP
dialog: Oh shh ...
dialog: 
text: They empty their guns - useless - and then they turn and run
text: down the alley. And then stop short. There is a sudden wall
text: of impenetrable blackness in front of them as if the world
text: simply comes to a stop four yards from their feet.
dialog: 
text: The cops turn, terrified, to look back. Instinctively, they
text: spread apart - each walking near to opposite walls.
dialog: 
text: The younger cop is standing beneath a fire escape. He glances
text: up as if he might be able to jump up to safety. No. Too high.
dialog: 
text: Pinhead's head flicks upward as if in a gesture of command.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, the Fire escape ladder zooms downward with impossible
dialog: speed and force.
dialog: 
text: The Younger Cop doesn't even have time to scream. The ladder
text: smashes right through his body, impaling him.
dialog: 
text: His corpse stands there twitching and shuddering, wrapped
text: around the ladder.
dialog: 
text: Elder Cop stares in terror at his partner's fate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELDER COP
dialog: No. No. No. No. No. No.
dialog: 
text: Pinhead stands very still and speaks very calmly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: Curb your tongue.
dialog: 
text: The Elder Cop's body starts to move involuntarily. His
text: movements are jerky and spasmodic as if his mind is trying to
text: fight what his body is trying to do.
dialog: 
text: Pinhead's head moves through various positions. His face is
text: calm, showing no particular pleasure at what he is doing but
text: only a fascinated concentration as if experimenting with new-
dialog: found skills.
dialog: 
dialog: 82
dialog: 
text: The Elder Copts shaking puppet-like hands draw his handcuffs
text: from his belt.
dialog: 
text: His eyes show terror. Everything else is beyond his control.
dialog: 
text: He raises the cuffs to head level and springs one of them open.
dialog: 
text: His mouth suddenly jerks open and his tongue protrudes.
dialog: 
text: The fear in his eyes increases.
dialog: 
text: He moves the open cuff over his tongue. He's making panicked
text: moaning noises as if trying to scream.
dialog: 
text: SLAM! He drives the cuff closed right through his tongue!
dialog: 
text: And SCREAMS (as best he can).
dialog: 
text: Pinhead looks beyond the Cop to the wall of blackness and makes
text: another commanding gesture with his head.
dialog: 
text: A Chain flies from the darkness and wraps itself around the
text: other cuff.
dialog: 
text: The chain pulls taut and then suddenly retracts into the
text: darkness, hauling the Cop off his feet and dragging him along
text: the alley into the blackness.
dialog: 
text: The Cop screams and moans all the way until he is enveloped
text: into the darkness and then the sounds suddenly stop dead.

dialog: 
text: In the middle of it all is Doc. Quite dead.
dialog: 
text: The body is kneeling up, its cold hands resting on its lap and

text: some others on an altar, provide the only light.
dialog: 
text: On the very front pew a PRIEST sits, head bent low in prayer.
dialog: 
dialog: The Priest is a young man. Probably a good man. We're not
dialog: really going to have the time to find out.
dialog: 
text: A shadow seems to pass over the Priest's bowed head.
dialog: 
text: At first, it seems he hasn't noticed. Then he looks up, a
text: little puzzled. He looks to his right, his left, then shifts
text: in the pew to look back along the central aisle.
dialog: 
text: There are rows and rows of empty pews and, in the distance, the
text: Church door ... which is ajar.
dialog:

speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: (calling down aisle)
dialog: Is there anyone there? Hello?

speaker_heading: PRIEST'S POV

dialog: 
text: Pinhead in all his dark glory is standing behind the altar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: How dare you!
dialog: 
text: It gets worse. Pinhead, staring at the Priest all the while,
text: reaches his hand to the back of his head and begins to extract
text: one of the pins from his skull.
dialog: 
text: The pin is horribly long and, sickeningly, the last few inches
text: aren't metal at all but some kind of infernal worm - dark,
text: slimy, and befanged.

text: Pinhead presses the worm against his palm and it instantly
text: burrows through his flesh pulling its pin-tail behind it. He
text: repeats the operation with the other palm.
dialog: 
text: He turns his palms out to show the Priest in a blasphemous
text: parody of Christ's stigmata.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: I am the Way.
dialog: 
text: The Priest rushes up to the altar to Pinhead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: You'll burn in Hell for this!
dialog: 
text: The Priest reaches him. Pinhead's hand is on his throat
text: instantly, squeezing silence from him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: Burn? What a limited imagination.
dialog: 
text: The choking Priest kicks and struggles as Pinhead forces him to
text: his knees before him.
dialog: 
text: Pinhead towers over the Priest. He smiles.
dialog: 
text: With his free hand he gouges out a piece of his own flesh from
text: the decorative wounds on his chest. He holds the bloody piece
dialog: of meat up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: This is my body. This is my blood.
dialog: Happy are they who come to my supper.
dialog: 
text: Pinhead shoves the disgusting lump of blue and bloody flesh
text: into the Priest's aghast mouth.
dialog: 
text: Pinhead flings the priest away from him.
dialog: 
dialog: 85
dialog: 
text: The Priest lands heavily on the floor.
dialog: 
text: Pinhead walks forward, smashing the altar aside.
dialog: 
text: All the candles flicker as if an unheard wind is blowing
dialog: through the Church.
dialog: 
text: Pinhead walks up the aisle toward the semi-conscious Priest.
dialog: 
text: And all the candles go out.

scene_heading: INT/EXT JOEY'S CAR/CITY STREETS NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Joey is driving again. And this time she's not even stopping
text: at red lights. She steams across junctions, leaving cars
text: swerving and horns honking in her wake.
dialog: 
text: Something catches her eye and she throws a glance to her side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: (appalled)
dialog: Oh God ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY'S (MOVING) POV
dialog: 
text: Up a side street, atop a hill, is the Inner-city Church. It's
text: on fire.
dialog: 
text: Joey swings the car up the hill.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SMASH-CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Joey getting out of the car nearer the burning church. Off to
text: her side is a smaller building, the Church Hall.
dialog: 
text: Joey shakes her head at the desecration. She has no doubt
dialog: who's responsible.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Having fun en route, you bastard.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, a CREAKING noise from behind her.
dialog: 
text: Joey freezes in terror then slowly - very slowly - turns round.
dialog: 
scene_heading: JOEY'S POV - SHOCK REVEAL
dialog: 
text: The Priest - now mercifully dead - is crucified against the
text: side wall of the smaller building. Pinhead's nails protrude
text: from his palms and his ankles.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 86
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT CITY STREETS NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A SERIES of QUICK CUTS of Joey's car tearing through the
text: darkness heading back to her apartment.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR, JOEY'S APT. BLDG. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Joey rushes down the corridor to her apartment door, hurriedly
text: turns the lock and rushes in.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Joey closes her door and switches on the light. The mood is
text: suddenly different after the frenzied drive across town. It's
text: very still, very slow, very quiet.
dialog: 
text: Perhaps it's too quiet: Joey moves into the room slowly,
text: clutching the Box in her hands and glancing round. Her manner
text: makes the mood suddenly creepy. Is the monster already in the
dialog: house?
dialog: 
text: Very slowly, very carefully, Joey begins to move round her
text: apartment. Hardly breathing, making no sudden movements, she
text: checks her doors. The kitchen ... empty. The bedroom ...
text: empty. The bathroom ... empty.
dialog: 
text: Joey stands back in the center of her main room, facing out to
text: her big picture window. Slowly, she lets out a big breath and
text: then draws an equally slow one in. Maybe it's alright ...
dialog: maybe the monster isn't here ... maybe ...
dialog: 
text: Magically, eerily, slowly, the Box begins to rise from Joey's
text: hand. Her eyes stare in horror as it ascends through the air.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Oh shit ...
dialog: 
text: Maybe there's one place she hasn't checked. Swallowing
text: nervously, Joey tilts her head up and back, her eyes rising up
text: in their sockets.
dialog: 
text: The camera tilts low ... low ... lower ... taking in a wider
text: view of the room and its ceiling and the ascending Box ...
dialog: 
dialog: And the audience screams!
dialog: 
text: Like a spider or a lizard, Pinhead is flat against the ceiling,
text: arms stretched out for balance, his face staring down at Joey.
dialog: 
text: Joey throws her hands to her mouth and screams.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 87
dialog: 
text: Pinhead, angling down feet first, floats elegantly to the floor
text: to stand facing Joey. The Box lands in one of his outstretched
text: hands. He holds it out to show Joey ... and then suddenly
text: closes his powerful hand on it, apparently crushing it.
dialog: 
text: He flings the remnants from him and they land on Joey's floor -
text: Chunks and splinters of wood, whirring and spinning machinery
text: of gold and silver, and scores of tiny writhing worms.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: No!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: Watch.
dialog: 
dialog: Thanks to the miracles of trick photography, the remnants
text: suddenly come back together and reassemble themselves into the
text: Box which sits there intact on the floor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: The Box can't be destroyed. Like pain
dialog: or the poor, it is always with us. But
dialog: as long as I have it, no-one can open
dialog: it. Now come here and die. You have
dialog: friends in Hell waiting to greet you.
dialog: 
text: Joey begins to back across the room toward her window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: You'll have to come and get me, you ugly
dialog: bastard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: Spirited. Good. I'll enjoy making you
dialog: bleed. I'll enjoy making you enjoy it.
dialog: 
text: Pinhead starts across the room.
dialog: 
text: Joey looks at her window. It's the normal view ... with the
text: normal seven-story drop.
dialog: 
text: Pinhead closes.
dialog: 
text: She bites her lip, goes for it: in a literal and metaphorical
text: leap of faith she runs headlong at the window and jumps at it.
dialog: 
text: The window shatters.
dialog: 
text: Pinhead's arm reaches out after Joey as if to grab her and pull
dialog: her back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDELONG ANGLE
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 88
dialog: 
text: - shows his arm entering the shattered window and also shows
text: the night-time cityscape beyond the window. What it doesn't
text: show is the front of the monster's arm. That's somewhere else.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. QUONSET HUT
dialog: 
text: CLOSE on Pinhead's arm, still clutching at the air.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, a khaki-uniformed arm moves into shot and grasps
text: Pinhead's hand, arm-wrestling style.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE (WITH OPTICAL F/X)
dialog: 
text: Elliott literally pulls Pinhead through from one reality to
text: another - we see parts of the monster appearing and
text: disappearing in front of the Hut wall as if glimpsed through
text: tears in reality. It's like a tug-of-war which Elliott wins -
text: Suddenly Pinhead's there on the floor of the Quonset hut.
dialog: 
text: And his other self - Elliott - still has hold of his hand.
dialog: 
text: Pinhead throws a glance around the Hut. He recognizes it ...
text: and the frozen figure at the top end perched before the Box.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: (furious rage)
dialog: Aahhhh!!!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIOTT
dialog: Joey! Back to the wall, quickly!
dialog: 
text: Joey runs around then to the far wall - just in time because
text: now the pyrotechnics start.
dialog: 
text: Elliott tightens his grip and (with a nice series of INTERCUT
text: CLOSE-UPS of these two alternative selves) the life-forces of
text: Elliott and Pinhead begin to erupt.
dialog: 
text: ELECTRIC BLUE LIGHT begins to play over both their bodies.
text: It's apparently agonizing, both figures arching with the pain,
text: both faces grimacing.
dialog: 
text: Joey watches, wincing in sympathetic agony.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Elliott! No! What about you?! Where
dialog: will you be?!
dialog: 
text: Elliott grunts his answer through the agony.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 89
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIOTT
dialog: Back with the damned. No more hope of
dialog: heaven. But I drag this monster back
dialog: with me!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: You stupid interfering foo ... AAAAAH!
dialog: 
text: VARIOUS ANGLES ON THE THREE SELVES - PINHEAD, ELLIOTT, AND THE
speaker_heading: SEATED OFFICER
dialog: 
text: The essences of Pinhead and Elliott - drawn from their bodies
text: as sweeping, glowing, spitting arcs of BLUE LIGHT - crackle in
text: the air of the Hut like a miniature electrical storm ...
dialog: 
text: Until they suddenly lock together in one more powerful arc
text: which flies at the body of the seated Officer and disappears
text: inside him in a BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT.
dialog: 
text: And suddenly, as vision returns, there is only the seated
text: officer (and, at the far end of the room, Joey).
dialog: 
text: And, almost as suddenly, the frozen scene comes to life;
dialog: 
text: The radio near the camp bed is playing.
dialog: 
text: A bead of sweat falls down the Officer's face as he reaches
dialog: forward to pick up the Box.
dialog: 
text: The Officer, apparently completely unaware of Joey's presence,
text: begins to work the Box.
dialog: 
text: As the process works through, we INTERCUT CONSTANTLY BETWEEN
dialog: 
dialog: 1) The Officer's hands and the movements of the Box here in
dialog: the Hut in 1921.
dialog: 
text: 2) EXACTLY MATCHING movements of the Box back on the floor of
text: Joey's apartment in 1992. Moving on its own, linked across the
dialog: years to its earlier self.
dialog: 
text: 3) Joey watching the movements in the Hut.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Elliott? ... Elliott? ... You can't
dialog: hear me, can you? It's 1921. I'm not
dialog: really here ...
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, small patterns of BLUE LIGHT arc across the Box,
text: shocking the Officer who drops the Box and then stares in shock
dialog: and fascination as ...
dialog: 
text: On the floor, the box begins to open.
dialog: 
text: The Officer kneels up and leans over the Box ...
dialog: 90
dialog: 
text: And the chains fly! Shooting up from within and hooking
text: themselves cruelly into the Officer's face and chest.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON the Officer's face, howling in agony.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON Joey's face, sobbing in distress. She throws up her
text: hands to hide the unbearable sight from herself and, when she
dialog: lowers them, ...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: .. she's back in her room. Alone. Window intact. Normal view.
dialog: 
text: Joey stares around, her face a mix of sadness and relief.
dialog: 
text: The mood now is very down, post-cataclysmic, post-adventure.
dialog: 
text: Joey takes a deep slow breath and crosses the room toward the
text: kitchen door.
dialog: 
text: She crosses the floor without glancing down at it. Why should
text: she? Everything's over. But we notice, even if she doesn't,
dialog: that the Box is no longer there. But we hardly have time to
dialog: register this before ...
dialog: 
text: Joey opens the kitchen door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: (SCREAMS!!!!)
dialog: 
text: Pinhead is framed in the doorway.
dialog: 
text: Behind him, instead of her kitchen, is the black space of Hell
text: - like the Torture Rooms in HELLRAISER and HELLBOUND, it is
text: full of shadowy pillars and chains.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: Oh, no kiss of welcome after 70 years?
dialog: 
text: Joey backs away, shaking her head in shocked denial.
dialog: 
text: Pinhead moves forward, very leisurely.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: This will be so good, Joey. You loved
dialog: him, didn't you? I can feel him inside,
dialog: weeping for you. He can watch through
dialog: the centuries as we discover the things
dialog: that make you whimper.
dialog: 
text: Joey's mood breaks and she turns and rushes for her front door.
dialog: 
text: She reaches it, throws it open ... and screams.
dialog: 
dialog: 91
dialog: 
text: JP Monroe is in the doorway - but he's only just recognizable.
text: He's now a CENOBITE - blue-skinned, scarred, mutilated, and
text: decorated with metal and leather.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: You never met, did you? This was JP
dialog: Monroe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JP CENOBITE
dialog: Have you seen what they did to me? Have
dialog: you seen what they did? You interfering
dialog: little whore!
dialog: 
text: The JP Cenobite moves into the room.
dialog: 
text: Joey, now near hysteria, rushes across the room again to the
text: one remaining door - her bedroom.
dialog: 
text: She throws that one open ...
dialog: 
text: And Terri, the new FEMALE CENOBITE, walks out at her. She has
text: the open Box in her hand and several cigarette protruding from
text: different holes in her cheek and face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Terri? Oh no! NO!! TERRI!!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRI CENOBITE
dialog: Oh, go on. Have one. Fuck it. You
dialog: think you're going to live forever?
dialog: 
text: Pinhead and JP are advancing across the room toward Joey and
text: Terri. Joey only has seconds to act ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Wanna light, you bitch?!
dialog: 
text: Joey pulls her father's Zippo from her pocket and sparks it up
text: as she swings it through the air close to Terri's face.
dialog: 
text: A huge FLAME shoots out of the Zippo (as in the earlier scene)
text: and scours across Terri's face.
dialog: 
text: Terri howls in terror, throws her hands to her face ... and the
text: Box flies from her hands.
dialog: 
text: Joey catches it, spins it, closes it!
dialog: 
text: An arc of BLUE LIGHT zaps across to Terri and she's gone ...
dialog: 
text: Still in one movement, swinging on her heels, Joey twists the
dialog: box again ...
dialog: 
text: And another Arc of LIGHT zaps JP away ...
dialog: 
dialog: 92
dialog: 
text: Joey completes her turn. She's facing Pinhead. She holds the
text: Box before her like a weapon ... and she's got the monster in
dialog: her sights ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: Wait!
dialog: 
text: His hands are raised palms out. He's stopped advancing.
dialog: 
text: Joey holds the Box ready, breathing heavy, waiting ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: You can send me back. But why? I can
dialog: help you, Joey. I can give you what you
dialog: want.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: You'll never know what I want ...
dialog: 
text: (Despite what she's said, we see Joey's face register every
text: word of Pinhead's reply, every nuance, every promise ... )
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINHEAD
dialog: Respect. Power. You and I can put your
dialog: name on the World's lips, your face on
dialog: it's screens ...
dialog: 
text: Camera TRACKS closer to the Box in Joey's hands as Pinhead
text: speaks. Closer and closer until it's side fills the screen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CROSS-FADE
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MS. SUMMERSKILL'S OFFICE DAY
dialog: 
text: CLOSE on the face of the Box, still filling the screen.
dialog: 
text: SLOW PULL BACK to reveal that the Box is mounted on a plinth
text: within a glass bell-jar.
dialog: 
text: PULL BACK continues. The bell-jar stands on a tall thin wooden
dialog: sculpture stand.
dialog: 
text: PULL BACK continues. The stand is next to a large impressive
text: desk in an even larger even more impressive office.
dialog: 
dialog: And seated behind the desk is ... well, we can't really call
dialog: her Joey - she's far too impressive for that ... is Ms. Joanne
dialog: Summerskill.
dialog: 
text: Her hair is different. Her make-up is different. Her clothes
dialog: are different. Everything about this woman speaks of power and
dialog: sophistication.
