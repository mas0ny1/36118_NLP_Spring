dialog: "Life is the crummiest book I ever read." -- Bad Religion
dialog: Godspeed You Black Emperor's “Lift Your Skinny Fists Like
text: Antennas To Heaven" begins (track 1 on your cd).
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: Darkness. We hear RUSTLING and a small GROAN. Then there
text: is silence for several seconds.
text: As the trumpet comes in, the screen is suddenly filled with
text: the iridescent, turquoise blue glow of a wrist watch whose
text: face plainly reads 7:15am.
text: It suddenly begins to beep.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM ~~ MORNING
text: The lanky man under the covers reaches out from underneath
text: his modest blanket and grabs his watch. He presses one of
text: its buttons, stopping the beeping.
text: We hear a female NARRATOR speak:
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.0.)
text: This is a story about a man named
dialog: Harold Crick...
text: He places the watch back on the nightstand.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
text: ---and his wristwatch.
text: Harold's arm retracts back under the covers.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Harold Crick was a man of infinite
dialog: numbers, endless calculations and
dialog: remarkably few words.
dialog: (pause)
text: And his wristwatch said even less.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM ~- MOMENTS LATER
text: HAROLD brushes his teeth in his mint colored bathroom, the
text: door open. We see a tiny blue glow from the other room.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Every weekday, for nine years, Harold
dialog: would brush each of his 32 teeth 76
dialog: times. 38 times back and forth. 38
text: times up and down. His wristwatch
dialog: would simply look on from the
text: nightstand, quietly wishing Harold
dialog: would use a more colorful toothbrush.
scene_heading: INT. CLOSET -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Harold flips an orange necktie over itself as he looks at
text: himself getting dressed in his closet mirror, his watch now
speaker_heading: {CONTINUED)
dialog: on. His apartment is very clean and modern. We may notice
text: that his only source of time is his watch.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Every weekday, for nine years, Harold
dialog: would tie his tie in a single Windsor
dialog: knot instead of the double, thereby
dialog: saving him up to 43 seconds every
text: morning. His wristwatch thought the
text: single Windsor made his neck look
dialog: fat... but said nothing.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET CORNER -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Harold, Granny Smith apple between his teeth, hurries after
text: a departing bus while putting on his black overcoat and
text: carrying a briefcase, the cold, sleek city jutting out behind
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR .(V.O.)
dialog: Every weekday, for nine years, Harold
dialog: would run at a rate of nearly 57
dialog: steps per block for 6 blocks nearly
text: missing the 8:17 Faraday Bus. His
dialog: wristwatch would delight in the
text: feeling of the crisp wind rushing
text: over its face.
text: Harold is just able to make the bus in time.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE ~~ LATER
text: Harold races through the corridors of an expansive office
text: building, occasionally peeking his head into a cubicle or
text: reviewing the work of one of his peers.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (handing a folder to
dialog: someone. )
dialog: 1412 paragraph 8, Diane. Thanks.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR {V.O.)
dialog: And every weekday, for nine years,
dialog: Harold would complete 7.134 tax files
dialog: as a senior auditor for the Internal
dialog: Revenue Service.
speaker_heading: CO-WORKER
dialog: Harold, 89 times 1,417?
speaker_heading: HAROLD

scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE ~~ DAY
text: Harold, sitting alone at a small steel desk in the corner of
text: an industrial warehouse, eating lunch amongst very tidy stacks
dialog: of work.
speaker_heading: { CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.0.}
dialog: ...only taking a 45.7 minute lunch
text: break and 4.3 minute coffee break.
text: Timed precisely by his wristwatch,
text: He finishes his last bite just before his watch begins to
text: beep.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET -- LATER
text: Harold strolls past small urban shops uptown, their colorful
text: facades and clean windows displaying everything from women's
text: shoes to travel packages. Harold pauses momentarily as he
text: passes a window displaying various guitars.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR {(V.0.)
dialog: Beyond that, Harold lived a life of
dialog: solitude. Harold would walk home
dialog: alone...
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN -- LATER
text: Harold finishes eating a modest meal in his pale red kitchen
text: while looking through a calculator catalog.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: He would eat alone...
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM -- LATER
text: Harold crawls into bed, gently removing his wristwatch and
text: placing it on the nightstand next to him. He presses a few
text: of its buttons probably to set its alarm. With a tug of a
text: chain the yellow light next to him goes out and the room
text: returns to darkness, save for the blue glow of his watch.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: And at precisely 11:13 every night,
dialog: Harold would go to bed alone, placing
text: his wristwatch to rest on the
text: nightstand beside him.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: That was, of course, before Wednesday.
dialog: (pause.)
text: On Wednesday, Harold's wristwatch
dialog: changed everything.
text: The drums explode as we...
dialog: Blackout.
text: The credits roll and the music continues triumphantly. We
text: find ourselves inter-cutting between two scenes played mute.
text: In one scene, a young blonde-haired boy removes his hands
text: from his eyes, revealing a brand new bicycle with a bow on
text: it. His jaw drops. He looks at his dad who stares on with
text: a gleam in his eye.
text: The other scene is of a middle-aged black woman looking
text: through the employment ads in her cramped kitchen.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
text: She holds a red pen over the page hunting for a job for which
text: she's qualified. A view of the paper reveals that she has
text: circled only one ad.
text: No explanation is given for the scenes as the credits and
text: music come to an end. The following appears on screen:
dialog: "I woke the same as any other day except a voice was in my
dialog: head." -~ Soundgarden.
scene_heading: INT. NIGHTSTAND. -- MORNING
text: We return to the glow of Harold's wristwatch which reads:
text: 7:15am .
text: It promptly begins beeping.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM ~- MORNING
text: Harold is once again brushing his teeth meticulously.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: If one had asked Harold, he would
dialog: have said that Wednesday was exactly
dialog: like all the Wednesdays prior. And
dialog: he began it the same way he--
text: Harold suddenly stops as does the narration. He begins
text: looking around, obviously hearing something. He pauses and
text: listens. There's nothing there. He resumes brushing. The
text: narration resumes as well.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: and he began it the same way he always
dialog: id--
text: Harold stops again and the narration stops abruptly with
text: him. He definitely hears something. He looks at his
dialog: toothbrush,
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Hello?
text: He holds the toothbrush to his ear to listen. Nothing. He
text: shakes it. Then he holds it stiffly and shakes his head.
text: He resumes brushing and the narration immediately returns.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: He began it the same way he always
dialog: did. When others’ minds would--
text: He stops once again, now a little worried. He puts his
text: toothbrush down and looks in his shower.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Hello? Is someone here?
text: Heart racing, he looks around but finds no evidence of anyone
text: else. He slowly lifts his toothbrush to his teeth and begins
text: to carefully brush again.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: When others' minds would fantasize
dialog: about their upcoming day, or even
dialog: try to grip onto the final moments
dialog: of their dreams... Harold just counted
text: brush strokes.
text: Harold suddenly stops once more and so does the narration.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Alright. Who just said: “Harold
dialog: counted brush strokes"? --And how
dialog: do you know I'm counting brush
dialog: strokes!?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Hello?
text: He looks at his toothbrush once again. He inspects it.
text: Paranoid that somehow the toothbrush might be causing the
text: voice, Harold delicately places it on the edge of the sink
text: and walks away.
scene_heading: INT. CLOSET -- MORNING
text: Harold folds a red tie over itself as he watches himself in
text: the mirror.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: It was remarkable how the simple,
dialog: modest-~
text: Harold stops. He sighs. He looks over both shoulders. He
text: closes his eyes. He picks up his tie.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: It was remarkable how-~-
text: He stops again. He turns and begins to search his apartment
text: in the hopes of discovering where the sound is coming from.
text: He looks at his watch. He has no choice but to resume getting
text: dressed. He takes his tie in hand...
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: it was remarkable how the simple,
dialog: modest elements of Harold's life, so
dialog: often taken for granted, would become
dialog: the catalyst for an entirely new
dialog: life...
text: Harold just tries to ignore it.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET -- MORNING
text: Harold again runs down the street, this time with a pear in
text: his mouth, a red tie knotted in a single Windsor.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: This was the last dash Harold would
text: make for the 8:17 bus, the last
dialog: morning Harold would hear his breath
speaker_heading: (MORE}
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D}
text: leap from his throat, the last day
text: his stiff leather shoes would make
text: that terrible squeaking sound as
text: - they flexed against the concrete.
text: Harold stops running. He looks down at his feet and wiggles
text: them. They squeak against the concrete. He wiggles them
text: again. More squeaking. He looks up, amazed.
text: The bus quickly passes and Harold breaks out of his stupor
dialog: to run after it.
speaker_heading: . NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: ...for this was an extraordinary
dialog: day. ‘A day to be remembered for the
dialog: rest of Harold's life.
text: Harold misses the bus and throws his arms up in disgust. He
text: comes to a stop next to a short Polish Woman who also just
dialog: missed the bus.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: But of course, Harold just thought
dialog: it was a Wednesday.
text: Harold grabs the woman by the shoulders.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Did you hear that?
text: The woman just stares at him.
speaker_heading: HAROLD (CONT'D)
dialog: The, the, the... the voice. Did you
dialog: hear it?-~ “Harold just thought it
dialog: was a Wednesday..."
speaker_heading: POLISH WOMAN
dialog: Don't worry. It is Wednesday.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: No. Did you hear it: "Harold just
dialog: thought it was a Wednesday.”
speaker_heading: POLISH WOMAN
dialog: Who's Harold?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I'm Harold.
speaker_heading: POLISH WOMAN
dialog: Harold. It's okay. It is Wednesday.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: No. I... No. The voice said it was
dialog: "just a Wednesday."
speaker_heading: POLISH WOMAN
dialog: Voice is right. It's Wednesday.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I... No. I'm...{Christ.]
text: The woman looks at him for a second, then just walks to the
text: other side of the bus stop to stand.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE -~ DAY
text: Harold once again passes through the corridor of the IRS,
text: but he seems distracted, almost frazzled, stumbling past co-
text: workers as he reviews a mess of files that nearly topple out
dialog: of his ams.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Harold couldn't truly concentrate on
dialog: his work.
scene_heading: FEMALE CO-WORKER
dialog: Harold? Can you...
text: Harold nearly knocks her over but keeps going. Another co-~
text: worker approaches.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
text: He was lost. He struggled to compute
dialog: arithmetic he could normally calculate
dialog: effortlessly...
scene_heading: ANOTHER CO-WORKER
dialog: Harold. 67 times 453?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Uh...
text: He closes his eyes and tries to shake off the voice.
speaker_heading: HAROLD (CONT'D)
dialog: Uh...
scene_heading: ANOTHER CO-WORKER
dialog: Harold?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: IT...
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: When a co-worker asked the product
text: of 67 and 453, he drew a blank.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (to the voice)
dialog: I can't think while you're talking.
scene_heading: ANOTHER CO-WORKER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: What?
text: Harold realizes what he’s just said.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: HAROLD (CONT'D)
dialog: Uh... nothing. Nothing.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.0.)
dialog: ‘Harold quickly answered 30,351.
speaker_heading: HAROLD

scene_heading: ANOTHER CO-WORKER

dialog: (calling after co-
dialog: worker)
dialog: --Wait! Wait!
scene_heading: INT. ARCHIVES ~- DAY
text: It's only midday but already Harold looks ready to go home.
text: His tie is loosened, his hair is a mess, he looks tired, his
text: papers are scattered and he's just staring at the water cooler
text: in the archives room, a file open in his hand as if frozen
text: in the middle of filing.
text: A short, overweight, horribly sweaty co-worker with stains
text: on his short-sleeved button down shirt (DAVE) comes barreling
text: past Harold to the water cooler.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Dude, I've repoed 5 sports cars, two
dialog: boats and a condo and it's not even
dialog: lunch yet. I tell you... it's a
dialog: shame they don't give out an Auditor
dialog: of the Year award.
text: Harold just stares forward. Dave waits for a response.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Dude?
text: Harold slowly turns, as if waiting for the voice to start
dialog: speaking.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Dave. I'm being followed.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (locking around)
dialog: How are you being followed? You're

speaker_heading: {CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I'm...
text: Harold looks up to make sure the voice won't start.
speaker_heading: HAROLD (CONT'D)
dialog: (pause. )
text: It’s by a voice.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
text: I'm being followed by a woman's voice.
text: They just stare at each other for a moment.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: Okay. What is she saying?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
text: She's... she's narrating.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Harold. You're standing at the water
text: cooler. What is she narrating?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I... I... I had to stop filing.
dialog: Watch. Listen. Listen.
text: Harold continues to organize papers into files.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: The sound the paper made against the
text: folder had the same tone as a wave
text: scraping against sand. And when
dialog: Harold thought about it, he listened
dialog: to enough waves every day to
dialog: constitute what he imagined to be a
text: deep and endless ocean...
text: Harold stops organizing the papers. He turns to Dave.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Did you hear that?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You mean, you filing?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: No. The... the... The voice.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Nu-huh.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
text: {Oh God]... Dave it's, it's, it's...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: The frightening part is that sometimes
dialog: I do imagine a deep and endless ocean.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What ocean?
speaker_heading: HAROLD |
dialog: ‘The one made up by [me filing the

text: A SECRETARY passes by and hands Dave two folders.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: New audits! Have a good day!
text: Dave looks.at them. One folder is an inch and a half thick,
text: the other is remarkably slim.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Okay. We got a baker and a securities
dialog: trader. :
text: He looks at Harold, who stares at the files, eyes bugged,
text: mouth agape. Dave hands him the slim folder.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. LIBERTY BAKERY ~- AFTERNOON
speaker_heading: ANA
dialog: You're completely fucking kidding
dialog: me!
text: Harold stands across from ANA PASCAL, the aforementioned
text: baker: a young, attractive woman with tattoos up on her thin,
text: pale arms, her hands and face dusted with flour, slipping
text: baguettes into paper sleeves in the back kitchen.
text: The bakery is crowded with CUSTOMERS who clamor over the
text: searing PUNK ROCK that plays. The walls are covered with
dialog: propaganda calling for the release of Leonard Peltier, the
text: armament of the Zapatistas, and even a mangled, upturned
text: American flag that reads, "Boycott Starbucks." All of the
text: WORKERS look under the age of twenty-one. Most have tattoos
text: or piercings and one has a spiked, yellow mohawk. In the
text: corner, a HOMELESS man enjoys a cup of coffee and a Danish,
text: a MONGREL DOG lapping at a bowl of water at his side.
text: And oddly enough, all the bustle, propaganda and punk rock
text: is surrounded by chiffon birthday cakes, poppy-seed muffins
dialog: and the fluffiest, most delicious-looking creme puffs you've
dialog: ever seen.
speaker_heading: ANA (CONT'D)
dialog: Like, seriously fucking kidding me...
speaker_heading: HAROLD

speaker_heading: ANA

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Listen. Is there somewhere else we
dialog: can speak about this... an office or--
speaker_heading: ANA
dialog: Oh no... we're talkin’ about this
dialog: right here, thank you.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (kindly)
dialog: Okay. Now, you know you only paid
dialog: part of your taxes last year.
speaker_heading: ANA
dialog: Yes. Of course I know.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You know? I believe only 73 percent.
speaker_heading: ANA
dialog: Yes. I know. Yes.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: But-- so... you did it on purpose?
speaker_heading: ANA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: So how can you not be expecting to
dialog: get audited? You stole from the
dialog: government .
speaker_heading: ANA
dialog: I didn't steal from the government.
dialog: I just didn't... pay them entirely.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Ms. Pascal, you can't just not pay

speaker_heading: HAROLD

dialog: “you. And now, I have to go over
dialog: your past 4 years of returns to make
dialog: sure that’s all you haven't paid.
speaker_heading: ANA
dialog: Fine.
text: Ana returns to slipping baguettes into sleeves.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I mean... is there, I don't know-- a
dialog: specific reason you feel exempt from
dialog: the United States Tax Laws?
speaker_heading: ANA
dialog: No. Listen, I am a big supporter of
text: fixing potholes and erecting swingsets
dialog: and building shelters. I'm more
dialog: than happy to pay those taxes. I'm
dialog: just not a big fan of paying the
dialog: percentage the government uses for
dialog: national defense, corporate loan-
dialog: outs and campaign discretionary
dialog: funds... so I didn't pay those taxes.
dialog: I believe I sent a letter to this
dialog: effect with my return.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Would that be the letter beginning
dialog: with, "Dear Imperialist Swine?"
speaker_heading: ANA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Ms. Pascal, what you're describing
dialog: is. anarchy.
speaker_heading: ANA
dialog: Okay. Maybe.
speaker_heading: HAROLD

speaker_heading: ANA

speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.0.)

speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)

scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP OF BUILDING -- DAY
text: As "And You Will Know Us By The Trail of Dead” begins to
text: play (track 2 your cd), a woman in an oversized black shirt
text: and gray flannel pants (KAY) approaches the ledge of a
text: skyscraper. Her face is worn beyond her age, her skin has a
text: yellowish complexion and her body looks not unlike a piece
text: of paper, crumpled into a ball and then thoughtlessly
text: restored. The pants and shirt ripple around her in the wind.
text: Her face is serene as she draws a drag from a cigarette.
text: She gently steps up onto the ledge, the rest of the city
text: becoming visible underneath her.
text: Kay looks down. Across the street she notices the middle-
text: aged black woman from the earlier scene. She's dressed very
text: nicely and compares a written out address on a scrap of paper
text: to the address on the building.
text: Kay turns her head. Coming down the street is the young
text: blonde boy, pedaling his bicycle quickly down the sidewalk,

scene_heading: INT. HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICES -- MOMENTS LATER
text: The open layout allows for noise and activity spillage from

speaker_heading: CHILD

speaker_heading: HAROLD

dialog: This man was an idiot.
text: Harold looks up. Cayly speaks, but we can't hear him as the
text: Narrator continues.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.} (CONT'D)
dialog: This man used words like “wibbly-
text: wobbly” and “convo” and explained
dialog: that trees were trees. Of course
dialog: trees were trees. Harold knew trees
dialog: were trees. Who doesn't know that
text: trees are trees.
text: The camera begins to zoom in on the (concerned) face of
text: Harold's watch.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.} (CONT'D)
dialog: What Harold didn't know was why he
text: couldn't shake the smell of brownies
dialog: from his senses, why Ms. Pascal had
text: made his fingertips quiver and lips
dialog: go numb. And this man wasn't helping
dialog: to explain that at all, nor anything
dialog: at all really. Something had to
dialog: change.
text: Suddenly Harold's watch begins to BEEP. He's jolted back to
text: reality and Cayly stops talking.
text: Harold looks at his watch. The face flashes blue, almost as
dialog: if sending a warning.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Sorry... my... that's... it's not
dialog: supposed to be beeping. Sorry.
dialog: Sorry.
text: Harold quickly stops his watch. He looks at it. It looks

speaker_heading: CAYLY
dialog: Take some "me time", Harold. Maybe

dialog: TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BUS STOP -~ LATER
text: Harold stands at the bus stop next to several other COMMUTERS.
text: He looks ready to go home, crawl into bed and possibly never
text: come out. He is so worn out, he doesn't notice Ana walking
text: up the sidewalk across the street.
text: Harold's watch notices, as we reveal its (excited) face, but
text: Harold just stands there, staring reticently at the asphalt.
text: Suddenly there is a BEEPING sound. A few people look around,
dialog: even check their cell phones.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 23.
text: Harold looks at his watch; its blue face flashing as it BEEPS
text: loudly and constantly.
text: Everyone looks at Harold.
text: Ana continues up the street. The watch keeps beeping at
dialog: Harold.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Harold assumed his watch was simply
dialog: on the fritz, and never even thought
dialog: about what it was trying to tell
dialog: him.
text: Harold quickly presses a few buttons, but the watch will not
text: stop BEEPING nor flashing. Harold shakes his watch.
text: He drops his briefcase to deal with the watch, but the BEEPING
text: only gets louder. Everyone begins to stare. Ana is almost
dialog: gone.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: In fact, Harold had never once paid
text: attention to his watch, other than
dialog: to find out the time. And, honestly,
dialog: it drove his watch crazy.
text: Harold looks at the sky, shaking his head. Harold puts his
text: watch behind his back, to muffle the BEEPING.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: And on this particular Wednesday
text: evening, as Harold waited for the
text: bus, his watch suddenly stopped...
dialog: if out of nothing else but sheer
dialog: frustration.
text: But only for a brief moment, after which it immediately stops
text: BEEPING and flashes “Enter Time" Ana is gone. Harold never
dialog: saw her.
text: Harold looks at his watch. He presses a button on the side.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Uh... Does somebody happen to have
dialog: the time?
speaker_heading: COMMUTER
dialog: I've got 5:47.
text: Harold quickly resets his watch to 5:47 and saves it.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR {V.O.)
text: So Harold's watch thrust him onto
dialog: the mercy of the immitigable path of
text: fate. For as he reset the time of
dialog: his watch, little did Harold know
dialog: that this. simple, seemingly innocuous
dialog: act would ultimately result in his
dialog: death.

speaker_heading: HAROLD (CONT'D)
dialog: Why? Why my death!? Hello! Why!?
dialog: (pause)

speaker_heading: HAROLD

dialog: What?
scene_heading: PROFESSOR HILBERT
dialog: I don‘t doubt you hear a voice, but

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: What?
scene_heading: PROFESSOR HILBERT
dialog: Harold. The only way to find out
dialog: what story you're in is to determine
dialog: what stories you're not in. Odd as
dialog: it may seem, I've just ruled out

speaker_heading: ANA

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: No. Actually, I was kidnapped by

text: She laughs.
speaker_heading: HAROLD (CONT'D)
text: Really. A nomadic tribe of abacus
dialog: builders.
text: It's that same laugh. The wonderful, human, loving one from
dialog: the bus.

text: Her lips part.
text: His fingers twitch.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: ay.
text: Harold's watch looks on (anxiously).
text: The pad of paper reveals their lopsided fate: comedy 7,

speaker_heading: ANA
dialog: {ordering}
dialog: Okay. Sit down.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Listen, I should be...
speaker_heading: ANA
dialog: No. Sit down.
text: He sits on a stool across the butcher block from her. She

text: goes to the refrigerator and pulls out a bottle of milk,
text: then pours some into the glass. She brings the glass and
text: plate over to the block, places a single cookie on the plate
text: and places the plate in front of Harold.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Thank you. I...
speaker_heading: ANA
dialog: Eat the cookie.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I really--
speaker_heading: ANA
dialog: Eat the cookie.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Ms. Pascal-—
speaker_heading: ANA
dialog: (sweetly)
dialog: It was a really awful, no good day.
dialog: I know. I made sure of it. So pick
dialog: up the cookie, dip it in the goddamn
dialog: milk and eat the fucking thing.
text: She slides the plate closer to him.
text: He cautiously takes a cookie, dunks it and bites into it.
text: His eyes light up, his shoulders relax, he breathes.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Wow... that's... that's a... really
dialog: good cookie.
text: Once again she suddenly stops and looks at him. They stare

text: His fingers twitch.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: ou.
text: Harold's watch looks on (anxiously}.

speaker_heading: : HAROLD (CONT'D)
dialog: So.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: When did you decide to become a baker?
speaker_heading: ANA
dialog: Oh. In college.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Oh. Like, "cooking college?"
speaker_heading: ANA
dialog: No. I went to Harvard Law.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Oh. Oh. Geez. I-- sorry. I just
dialog: assumed... Sorry.
speaker_heading: ANA
dialog: No. It's alright. I didn't finish.
dialog: T uh... uh...
text: She brings a plate with more cookies to Harold.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Did something happen?
speaker_heading: ANA
dialog: Not really. I was... I was barely
dialog: accepted. I mean, barely. The only
dialog: reason they let me come was because
dialog: of my essay. How I was going to
dialog: make the world a better place with
dialog: my degree. And I went there
dialog: thinking... well, I went thinking
dialog: that I might make a difference and
dialog: uh... well... Harvard Law has the
dialog: smartest people in the world, people
dialog: who will one day shape the earth,
dialog: and it’s competitive and vicious and
dialog: exhausting... And I'd have to
dialog: participate in these study sessions,
dialog: classmates and I, all night long.
dialog: Sometimes for a couple days straight.
dialog: And so...
text: She trails off, staring into space again, unsure whether to
dialog: proceed,
text: Once again she suddenly stops and looks at him. They stare
text: at each other for a moment.
text: Her lips part.
speaker_heading: {CONTINUED)
dialog: Si.
text: His fingers twitch.
text: Harold's watch looks on (anxiously).
text: The pad of paper reveals their lopsided fate.

text: Gently, Harold pushes the plate of cookies across to her.
text: She looks at him, then at the plate.
text: She sits down, picks up a cookie, then continues...
speaker_heading: ANA (CONT'D)
dialog: And so I would bake-- cookies usually--
dialog: so no one would go hungry while we
dialog: worked. I'd bake all afternoon in
text: the kitchen in the dorm before a big
dialog: study session and write down what I
dialog: was doing in one of those black Mead
dialog: Journals they sell by the gross in
dialog: the Campus Bookstore, And I'd bring
dialog: my little treats to the study
dialog: groups... and people loved them.
text: Oatmeal Cookies. Peanut Butter Bars.
dialog: Chocolate Chip and Macadamia Nut
dialog: Wedges. And everyone would eat and
dialog: stay happy and study harder and do
dialog: better on the tests and more people
dialog: would come to the study groups and
dialog: the study groups got better and I
dialog: would make more snacks and try to
dialog: find better recipes and the results
dialog: would always get better and better
text: and soon it was Cheese and Apricot
text: Croissants and Mocha Bars with Almond
text: Glaze and Lemon Chiffon Cakes with
dialog: Zesty Peach icing and our study groups
dialog: were famous around all of Cambridge:
dialog: not because we had the most copious
dialog: notes, or the smartest people, but
dialog: because we had the best snacks...
text: She gets up and goes to the cookie sheet and begins to remove
text: the cookies and put them on a large paper plate. She yanks
text: a strip of plastic wrap from a tube and wraps the larger
dialog: plate of cookies.
speaker_heading: ANA (CONT'D)
dialog: And at the end of the spring term...
dialog: I had 27 study partners, eight black
dialog: Mead journals filled with recipes...
dialog: and a D average.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: So I dropped out. Simply, without
text: alarm, and without any regrets.
dialog: {pause)
dialog: I just figured, if I was gonna make
dialog: the world a better place... I'd do
dialog: it with cookies.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

text: plate. There's only one cookie left.
speaker_heading: ANA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Iouh... I did. Thank you for forcing
dialog: me to eat them.
speaker_heading: ANA
dialog: You're welcome.
text: They look at each other for a moment. Harold finds himself
text: suddenly nervous. He looks at his watch.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I should go. Thank you. Thanks
dialog: again. I mean. For the cookies.
text: She takes a moment, then she offers the larger plate.
speaker_heading: ANA
dialog: Why don't you take them?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ANA
dialog: "No?"
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: No. Really.
speaker_heading: ANA

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ANA
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (slightly hurt)
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I mean. I... I would but, uh... I
dialog: can't,
speaker_heading: ANA
dialog: You can't.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: It... See, it constitutes a gift and
dialog: we're not allowed to...
speaker_heading: ANA
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I shouldn't have even had the other
dialog: ones.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: DS.
speaker_heading: ANA
dialog: I'm not going to tell anyone.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I know. But if you did, I could--
speaker_heading: ANA

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I know, but if you did-- I could...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Tell you what, I'll purchase them...
speaker_heading: ANA
dialog: What? No. That's... no... nevermind.
dialog: Go home.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I could...
speaker_heading: ANA
dialog: No. That... that... [totally defeats

speaker_heading: HAROLD

speaker_heading: ANA

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You baked those cookies for me didn't
dialog: you?
text: Embarrassed, she simply shrugs.
speaker_heading: HAROLD (CONT'D)
dialog: You were trying to be nice to me and
dialog: I totally blew it...
text: She shrugs.
speaker_heading: HAROLD (CONT'D)
dialog: And that may very well be the last
dialog: time you try to be nice again...
text: She looks at him... and then, once more, shrugs.
text: He hangs his head. He pulls out his pad and his pen. He

speaker_heading: HAROLD (CONT'D)

scene_heading: EXT. CITY -~ NIGHT
text: Harold walks down the sidewalk, the lights of the city playing
text: against all the glass and steel.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: ‘Perhaps, to say Harold Crick did not
dialog: give enough credit to fate is similar
dialog: to saying that he did not give enough
dialog: credit to major locomotive train
dialog: accidents. As anyone else could
dialog: explain, the precision with which
dialog: fate must work in order to cause two
text: trains to exist on the same track at
dialog: the same time, in spite of all the

text: Harold has a seat at the bus stop, the homeless man and his

speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Harold's death was quickly
dialog: approaching... and he still remained
text: completely oblivious to the moment
text: when his, Carla's and the boy on the
dialog: bicycle's courses would smash into
text: each other. Here he was. Alone.
text: Ms. Pascal blocks away, walking in
text: the opposite direction.
text: Harold writes down the name "Carla".
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
text: Fate, like two careening locomotives,
dialog: would occur with or without his
dialog: participation. And the miraculous
dialog: mathematics of this remained
dialog: inconceivable for even a true
dialog: calculator such as Harold.
text: He writes down "boy on bicycle".
text: He sighs.
scene_heading: NARRATOR {(V.0.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Harold could not understand fate.
dialog: He could not understand the behavior
text: of his watch. He could not even
dialog: understand the desires of his own

scene_heading: PROFESSOR HILBERT
dialog: Well the first thing is don't get on

speaker_heading: PROFESSOR HILBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: Any idea who "Carla" and "the boy on

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I think they're other characters.
scene_heading: PROFESSOR HILBERT
dialog: Maybe. Maybe. Fantastic.
text: They begin to walk past the lockers and around a corner.
text: Past the coach's office where Hilbert takes a whistle off a
dialog: hook.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Professor Hilbert, please. I totally
dialog: failed at the comic hero thing. In
dialog: fact, I think she likes me even less.
scene_heading: PROFESSOR HILBERT
dialog: I know. It's great.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: What?
text: They walk towards a set of doors, behind which we hear water
text: and giggling.
scene_heading: PROFESSOR HILBERT
dialog: You proved something else entirely.
text: The voice seems to be dependent on
dialog: actions you take. You say the voice
dialog: arrives when you do certain things,
dialog: then stops when you don't do those
dialog: things. It may be that you yourself

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Okay.
scene_heading: PROFESSOR HILBERT

speaker_heading: HAROLD

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

scene_heading: PROFESSOR HILBERT

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Try what?
scene_heading: PROFESSOR HILBERT
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Nothing?
scene_heading: PROFESSOR HILBERT
dialog: See... some plots are moved forward
dialog: by external events or crisis... others

dialog: themselves.
text: He points to the door.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR HILBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: If I go through that door that plot
dialog: continues. The story of me through
dialog: the door. If I stay here... that

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: HAROLD

dialog: I mean-- do you still have the journal
dialog: of things the narrator says?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: PROFESSOR HILBERT
dialog: Well, it's possible, through analysis
dialog: of sentence structure and some
dialog: extensive vernacular profiling, I
dialog: could conceivably figure out who's
dialog: writing this story.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: And then what?
scene_heading: PROFESSOR HILBERT

dialog: something, or, or, or finish reading
dialog: Crime and Punishment... hell, Harold,
dialog: you could just eat nothing but
dialog: pancakes if you wanted.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: What's wrong with you? I don't want
dialog: to eat nothing but pancakes, I want

dialog: in a choice between pancakes and
dialog: living, chooses pancakes?
scene_heading: PROFESSOR HILBERT
dialog: Harold, if you'd pause to think I
dialog: believe you'd realize that that answer
dialog: is inextricably contingent upon the

speaker_heading: PROFESSOR HILBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you understand what I'm saying?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Yes. I do. But you have to
dialog: understand that this isn't a

speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.} (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
