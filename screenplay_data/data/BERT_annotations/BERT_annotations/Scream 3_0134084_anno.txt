scene_heading: DISSOLVE INTO:
scene_heading: INT. FORD EXPLORER - NIGHT
text: A new 99' Explorer sits in the midst of the gridlock. Behind the wheel is hot
text: teen heartthrob and Hollywood everybody BEN DAMON. Ben is handsome, studly, in
text: his early 20s. However, aside from being just another pretty face in the city
text: of angels he's also a cocky, arrogant prick. Ben's in the middle of a heated
text: argument on his cell with his Agent, Cathy.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (into cell)
dialog: God dammit Cathy I have no time for this crap!
dialog: I'm supposed to be at the premiere of STAB 2 right
dialog: Now, arm and arm with my girlfriend cause she's got
dialog: a bit part in that over advertised piece of shit and
dialog: I'm just going to humor her. You mena to tell me that
dialog: in all your squandering the best you can do for me is
dialog: A bit role in STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO?! Come on!
dialog: It's just another cheap slasher flick! How dare you
dialog: offer me such a role! I've done Shakespeare! I've
dialog: worked with directors like DePalma and Scorcesse and
dialog: you offer me this crap?! It's insulting. I should
dialog: fire you and go to ICM.
speaker_heading: CATHY(O.S.)
dialog: (off phone)
dialog: Ben, I will not sit around and listen to you bad
dialog: mouth me! Without me you would've never gotten as
dialog: famous as you are today. The least you can do is
dialog: show me a little god damn respect.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: You want Respect, Cathy? Here's your respect.
dialog: FUCK YOU! You're fired.
dialog: (Ben hangs up)
dialog: Unfucking believable.
text: Ben socks the steering wheel out of frustration. The horn blares

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Stab 3: Return To Woodsboro.
dialog: Pah. What's next, Friday The 13TH PART 15:
dialog: JASON DOES BROADWAY?

dialog: What's up, B.D. with the B.D.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: (off phone)
dialog: Hardly as large as I'd like it to be.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Christine?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE(O.S.)
dialog: No, Jennifer Love Hewitt.
dialog: Of course it's me, silly.
dialog: And I feel like an ass standing
dialog: in this theater lobby all by myself.
dialog: Where are you babe, the movie starts
dialog: in twenty minutes.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think
dialog: there was some big accident. It could be
dialog: a little while so I don't want you to start
dialog: freaking if I don't get there at exactly,
dialog: (checks watch)
dialog: Eight thirty.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE(O.S.)
dialog: All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally
dialog: p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (putting up faux-enthusiasm)
dialog: Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world.
dialog: I bet you did such a great job.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE(O.S.)
dialog: I did. Hon, although I got a total of
dialog: six minutes screen time, they're the
text: best six minutes of the movie.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are.
dialog: Look, my battery's dying . . .
dialog: 
text: But of course, we notice Ben's battery is fine, he's just trying to cut the
dialog: conversation short.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE(O.S.)
dialog: Alright Hon, talk to you when the lights go down.
text: Ben smiles.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Sure thing.
text: Ben hangs up. He reclines back in his seat. Camera slowly pans out the
text: windshield revealing the huge traffic pile up awaiting him. He's not going
dialog: anywhere.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON GLOVE COMPARTMENT.
text: Ben opens the glove compartment. Papers scatter out. Ben reaches for a card.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON CARD -
text: A small white business card: 1-900-WET-4-COCK
text: Ben smiles, begins to dial out when suddenly, RING RING! The cell comes to
text: life in his hand.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (startled)
dialog: Jesus.
dialog: (answers call)
dialog: Hello?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Who is this?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Who is this?
dialog: At this point we know who the caller is. It's the nightmarish
dialog: deep voice we've all come to know and hate from the first two
dialog: films. It's never sounded so evil. So sexy.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Well what number are you trying to reach?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Do I?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (peeved)
dialog: Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out.
dialog: Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: Asshole, Can't talk.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: But your voice sounds so familiar.
text: Ben smiles.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Does it now?
speaker_heading: VOICE
text: You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben
dialog: Damon.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (smiling profusely)
dialog: Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Really? You're such a talented actor.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (loves the praise)
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Now let's see you act your way out of this one.
text: The voice seems to have changed tones. It now sounds a lot harsher, angrier if
dialog: you will.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES
dialog: ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend
text: Christine is in there. She's all alone.
text: Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film
dialog: to start.
dialog: (laughs coldly)
dialog: I've got my knife.
text: *NOTE: At this point we intercut shots of the empty lobby and halls of the
text: PLAZA THEATER. A POV shot standing outside the LADIES ROOM door.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (turning pale)
dialog: Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: More of a game really.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What kind of a game?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies.
dialog: Here's how we play. I ask you a question.
dialog: You get it right, your girlfriend lives.
dialog: You answer wrong, she dies.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I swear to God if you lay a finger on her
dialog: I'll fucking kill you!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Maybe so, but right now, we play the game.
dialog: First question, Your girlfriend's counting on
dialog: you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?
text: Ben groans. He bangs his head against the steering wheel, if only he'd have
dialog: paid attention to Christine he might have known this.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Come on. Don't you know?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (hesitating)
dialog: It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character
dialog: she plays in the movie!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What?! But I did everything you said to do!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're
dialog: taking the game to a whole new level. Meet me
text: beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes.
dialog: I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Good bye Ben.
dialog: 
text: Click. The killer hangs up. Ben flips open the phone, dials 911. Ringing and
dialog: then . . .
speaker_heading: RECORDED MESSAGE
dialog: (off phone)
dialog: Due to the high volume of calls this evening,
dialog: Dispatch is temporarily shut down. If this is
dialog: not a real emergency please call another dep-
text: Ben hangs up, dials CHRISTINE's number. RINGING, then--
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You're not playing by the rules Ben.
dialog: Don't you want her to live?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want
dialog: you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out.
dialog: Do you understand?
text: IN THE B.G. we hear CHRISTINE's horrific screaming.
text: The killer hangs up. Ben looks ahead, traffic is picking up. He puts the SUV
text: into gear, peels out the nearest opening, narrowly avoiding collision. His car
text: screeches down the off ramp.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT
text: Ben comes screeching around the corner in his FORD EXPLORER. Tires smoking.
text: Sparks flying. The HOLLYWOOD sign stands like an impending pall in the
dialog: awaiting b.g.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HOLLYWOOD SIGN - NIGHT
text: The SUV comes to a screeching halt alongside the hilly, narrow road. Ben jumps
text: out of his car, cell phone in hand. He looks up at the towering sign standing
text: ahead of him, contemplates. Does he really wanna go up there? He looks into
text: his SUV, gets an idea.
speaker_heading: THE BACK --
text: --is opened. Ben reaches in looking for a weapon. AN OLD BEACH CHAIR. Not
text: gonna do the trick. A pair of old shoes. Nope. Then he finds it, a LOUISVILLE
text: SLUGGER with "ACTORS AT BAT FOR BRAIN CANCER" written across it.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Thank God I decided to do some community service.
text: Ben takes the bat, closes up the back of the SUV. He begins to walk towards
dialog: the sign when suddenly --
speaker_heading: HIS CELL RINGS.
text: Ben answers the call.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Very good. You follow directions well.
text: Now for the final part of the game.
text: Put down the bat and approach the sign,
dialog: slowly.
text: Ben makes a disgusted face, tosses the bat into the bushes. He approaches the
text: sign, keeping his eyes trained in all directions.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Where are you?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Closer than you think.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want
dialog: from me?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: To see your reaction.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Reaction to what?
text: Ben passes under the huge, pallid "H" in the sign. What seems at first like a
text: gentle raindrop, beads down Ben's forehead. He rolls back his head, his legs
text: turning to jelly, his eyes widening in horror.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: OHMYGOD! NO!
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE --
text: Has been gutted from neck to groin. She has been fastened to the cross-bar in
text: the "H" with heavy rope. Her lifeless body sways ever so gently in the
text: Southern California wind. Utterly horrified, Ben staggers into the shadows,
dialog: not seeing --
text: THE GHOST as he rises from the void, knife in hand. In one quick, brutal
text: stab, the knife is driven into Ben's spine. Ben screams as he's turned around,
text: face to face with his attacker.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: BUT I'M THE KILLER IN STAB 3!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE GHOST
dialog: You just lost the role Ben.
dialog: Consider this your parting gift.
text: AND WITH that, the GHOST drives the bloodstained knife into Ben's heart,
text: causing a vicious eruption of crimson.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: TITLE CARD. "SCREAM 3"
speaker_heading: OPEN ON:
scene_heading: EXT. TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT SET - DAY
text: GALE WEATHERS, the flashy thirty-something news anchor and author of the
text: WOODSBORO MURDERS. She sits behind a desk on the really ditzy, loud set for
text: TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT, an ET style program with a live studio audience.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Good morning Hollywood. And today
dialog: officially starts the Summer movie
dialog: season. Opening the box office this
dialog: week is Jeff Bridges and Tim Robins
dialog: in Arlington Street, Eugene Levy
dialog: and Jason Biggs in American Pastry,
dialog: and Tori Spelling and David Schwimmer
dialog: in STAB 2, based off my best selling
text: book the WINDSOR MURDERS.
text: CAMERA pans across the audience. Many of them are dressed as the GHOST. A sea
text: of white screaming faces. Very eerie and unsettling.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Well I see a lot of the audience has dressed
dialog: to the occasion. Today we have director of the
text: upcoming STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO, Roman
dialog: Bridger. Why don't we give Mr. Bridger a nice
dialog: welcome to the set of Total Entertainment.
dialog: 
text: The crowd goes wild with applause and faux-knife slashes as ROMAN BRIDGER,
text: ravishingly handsome, 29, tall and stocky, enters stage dressed in a flashy
text: white suit. He sits down on a chair beside Gale's desk, places a STAB 3 coffee
text: mug beside Gale's hand.
speaker_heading: ROMAN
dialog: Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
speaker_heading: ROMAN
dialog: (addressing audience)
dialog: Well it's a honor to be here amongst so
dialog: many fans of the genre. And I must say
dialog: that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp,
dialog: or Tori or David not returning to complete
dialog: the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is
dialog: here. Aided with my excellent cast of
dialog: newcomers I believe we're going to pull
dialog: off one of the best Stabs yet.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly
dialog: seems that way.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Honestly though,
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
speaker_heading: ROMAN
dialog: (a long pause)
dialog: Honestly, my life.
text: A eclectic hush falls over the crowd. Roman appears somewhat sinister in this
text: light. Gale gazes deeply into Roman's eyes.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Your life?
speaker_heading: ROMAN
dialog: Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with
dialog: those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like
dialog: I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick
dialog: your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to
dialog: a Tobe Hooper flick.
text: Roman smiles. The true costumed horror film buffs in the audience break into
text: applause. Gale, somewhat distracted, other what not caring what this second
text: rate director has to say, gazes at a costumed individual at the far corner of
text: the set, watching from a half-open exit door. Now it could be just her
text: imagination running away with her and her atmosphere but it almost appears as
text: if the figure is pantomiming slitting his throat with a gleaming blade.
text: A LOUD BUZZING O.S. Gale is startled out of her skin. She looks up at a sign
text: hanging over the stage. THE WORD "COMMERCIAL BREAK" is illuminated in flashing
text: red light. Gale sighs, looks back to the exit. The GHOST is gone. She turns to
dialog: Roman.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Would you excuse me for a moment?
speaker_heading: ROMAN
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Sure.
dialog: Gale bolts for --
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE - TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT SET - DAY
text: Gale races around the corner of the set, smashing right into -
text: DETECTIVE MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D. Mid-thirties. Handsome with piercing eyes. He
text: grabs Gale by her shoulders, shepherding her aside.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE KINCAID
dialog: I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to
dialog: introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.
dialog: (flashes badge)
dialog: Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon,
dialog: or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Well I interviewed Damon once for the show.
dialog: He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the
dialog: second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part
dialog: in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE KINCAID
dialog: Both of them were found brutally murdered this
text: morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy
dialog: reports having come back to me yet but the
text: bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: So is that why you're here? Is that why you're
dialog: holding me from my show, to tell me about some
dialog: brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE KINCAID
dialog: I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but
text: there's more. The killer left a note.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: A note?
text: Detective Kincaid reaches into his back pocket, pulls up a newspaper clipping
text: in a ziplock evidence bag. He holds the bag up For Gale to see.
scene_heading: EXTREMELY CLOSE on the ARTICLE . . . "MAUREEN PRESCOTT, MOTHER AND WIFE, FOUND
text: BRUTALLY RAPED AND MURDERED IN BEDROOM". A b/w photo of Sidney's mother
text: Maureen stands hauntingly before the camera.
speaker_heading: GALE(O.S.)
dialog: That's Sidney Prescott's mother.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE KINCAID(O.S.)
dialog: There's more.
text: Kincaid flips the article over. Someone has scrawled in black marker across
text: the back "SIDNEY".
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE KINCAID
dialog: I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott,
text: but she's keeping herself very well hidden.
dialog: You're my one and only hope in finding her.
dialog: Her life may be in grave danger.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being
text: sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but
dialog: I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor
text: she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other
dialog: person that might know is,
dialog: (gale hesitates),
dialog: not going to talk.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE KINCAID
dialog: And who would that be?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SUNRISE STUDIOS BACK LOT - DAY
text: A red BMW convertible speeds through the back lot. Behind the wheel is DEWEY
text: RIELLY. Former Police Officer, turned Technical advisor on the red hot set of
text: . . . STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO.
text: All around the lot are promotional banners and posters for the film. Dewey
text: parks his car outside a soundstage, exits.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. STAB 3 SET - DAY
text: A huge replication of Woodsboro in a building about the size of an airplane
dialog: hanger. In one corner we've got the Macher and Prescott homes. In another
text: corner stands the infamous Becker house where the nightmare all began. In
text: other regions are sights like the Town Square and Market, an exterior for the
text: Woodsboro Police Station, A TOP STORY news van, etc.
text: DEWEY, Enters set, bumping into his movie alter-ego --
text: TOM PRINZE, a Hollywood poster boy. Very cool. Not so debonair. A shoddy copy
text: of Dewey at best. However, the conversation between the two is friendly, and
text: they exchange greetings.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Hey Dew, did you hear?
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: No, what?
speaker_heading: TOM
text: Somebody iced Ben Damon and his girlfriend.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: That's Hollywood Tom. One day you're
dialog: making movies in the hills, the next day
dialog: you're posing for the coroner downtown on a slab.
text: Dewey's obviously gotten a lot colder since the last film. He walks past a
text: clique of STAB 3'S MAIN CAST:
dialog: There's:
text: SARAH DARLING: 30, playing a 25 year old bimbo. Very hot. Very blonde. Ample
dialog: cleavage.
text: ANGELINA TYLER: 20. Extremely nadve looking. She won her part in STAB 3
text: playing Sidney through a phone in radio contest. She's timid, with short dark
text: hair. Out of the entire cast, she is the closet to Sidney, they got.
dialog: And also the loveable
dialog: TYSON JACKSON: late 20's, African-American, all attitude.
text: The three flip through pages of the STAB 3 script, conversing freely about the
dialog: production.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with
dialog: these re-writes. It's like every five
dialog: minutes there's a new script. God, and
dialog: you just know this all because of STAB 2's
dialog: script winding up on the internet two months
dialog: after it wrapped shooting.
speaker_heading: TYSON
dialog: And still the film is Number One at the box
dialog: office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty
dialog: and Arlington Street.
speaker_heading: ANGELINA
dialog: I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.
speaker_heading: TYSON
dialog: Nah I think it's doing so damn well because
dialog: one of it's players got iced. I just hope
dialog: none of us end up dead.
speaker_heading: ANGELINA
dialog: Oh that's right. Those poor poor people.
dialog: God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
speaker_heading: TYSON
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either
dialog: but I'm really concerned about my safety
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What are you talking about?
dialog: The murders were a completely isolated
dialog: incident.
speaker_heading: TYSON
dialog: (reading from script)
scene_heading: SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT.
dialog: "What are you talking about Ricky, the
dialog: murders were a completely isolated incident".
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Would you give that script a rest?
dialog: It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
speaker_heading: TYSON
dialog: I'm just saying, though. What if there's
dialog: someone out there stalking actors? Huh?
dialog: Then what?
speaker_heading: ANGELINA
dialog: There's always someone out there stalking
dialog: actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.
speaker_heading: TYSON
dialog: Melinda McGraw?
speaker_heading: ANGELINA
dialog: No, the other one. The one who played his
dialog: wife.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I know who you're talking about. Rebecca
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: ANGELINA
dialog: Yeah I think. Anyway, point is, she had a stalker.
dialog: Sonny Bono had a stalker. David Letterman had one
dialog: too. So did Heather Langenkamp, Brooke Sheilds,
dialog: Jody Foster, --
speaker_heading: TYSON
dialog: Listen Miss ingénue, your cheering me up to much,
dialog: Give it a break.
text: Tom walks into frame, sits down next to Angelina, subtly putting his arm
text: around her. She shoves him away.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What? What'd I do? Relax your crack sweetheart
dialog: I didn't rip those two fucks up last night.
dialog: Jeez.
dialog: (lights up a smoke)
dialog: So what are you doing tonight?
text: Totally repulsed, Angelina gets up, races off set.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Talk about moody.
text: Tom leans back seductively, his crotch in full view, staring at Sarah with
text: bedroom eyes.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: And how about you good looking?
dialog: Got any plans for later?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Eww yeah, finding a guy to have sex
dialog: with that doesn't look like you.
text: Sarah, following suit laid by Angelina, scampers off set. Tom looks up at
text: Tyson, smoke blowing out his nostrils.
speaker_heading: TYSON
dialog: Oh no. I ain't into that shit.
text: Tyson races off set. Tom laughs, covers his face.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: DETECTIVE KINCAID AND GALE.
text: They walk through the set. Gale's mesmerized. Kincaid is all business.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Déjr vu-do.
text: The pair come to a halt on the driveway of what is supposed to be the Macher
text: Residence. Everything from the smashed beer bottles in the garage, to the boat
text: on the driveway is mimicked to a perfect t. Even a foam dummy Of TATUM RIELLY
text: dangles from the doggy door, head squashed a bloody mess.
text: GALE stares at the swaying dummy, haunted.
speaker_heading: VOICE(O.S.)
dialog: Well well, someone dies and Gale Weathers
text: comes running. What a shock.
text: GALE looks up. DEWEY stands beside her.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE KINCAID
dialog: Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid.
dialog: I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware	of last night's
dialog: Events?
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Yeah. A real tragedy.
text: Dewey stares daggers through Gale. There is a real bitter coldness between the
dialog: two.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside,
dialog: this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: What so you can just exploit her again with another
dialog: book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: (to Kincaid)
dialog: Show him.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE KINCAID
dialog: Mr. Rielly, this was found alongside the bodies of
text: Ben and his girlfriend.
text: Kincaid hands Dewey the ziplocked clipping. Dewey examines it, his fear slowly
dialog: growing.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: I promised Sid I'd keep her in seclusion.
dialog: I promised her nobody would ever find her.
dialog: If you don't mind Detective, I'd like to
dialog: approach her with this on my own and see
dialog: what she'd like to do about it.
text: Kincaid nods.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE KINCAID
dialog: That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else
dialog: should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Understood.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: If you'll excuse me Detective.
dialog: (coldly)
dialog: Gale.
text: Dewey walks off camera. Kincaid puts his hand on Gale's shoulder.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE KINCAID
dialog: I'm going to have a little chat with the
dialog: producers. Don't wander off. I may need you.
text: Gale nods as Kincaid disappears into the backdrop of the set. A Shrill voice
dialog: O.S.
speaker_heading: WOMAN(O.S.)
dialog: GALE WEATHERS! Oh my God!
text: Jennifer Jolie, an ambitious young starlet, playing GALE in the latest Stab,
text: rushes towards her, with arms wide open. She's decked out in the flashy neon
text: green ensemble Gale wore in the first film and even sports a fake shiner on
text: her right eye. Gale is obviously pissed. She knows this actress and doesn't
dialog: really want to be in her company very long.
dialog: Gale
dialog: Shit.
dialog: Jennifer
dialog: Listen, I know we've never met, and
dialog: I don't mind you never returning my calls,
dialog: but I have to tell you that after two films
dialog: I feel like I am in your mind.
dialog: Gale
dialog: Well, that would explain my constant headaches.
dialog: Jennifer
dialog: (defensively)
dialog: You know I'm sorry that things didn't work out
dialog: on '60 Minutes II', but 'Total Entertainment'
dialog: that's a pretty good fall back.
dialog: Gale
dialog: Thank you. I'm sorry that things didn't work out
dialog: with Brad Pitt, but being single, that's a pretty

speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a
dialog: woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'. She wanted to
dialog: see the file on Sid, for research.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: The boys said no. She wouldn't give her name.
text: A month later, the station gets broken into,
text: the file room ransacked.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Someone stole Sid's file?
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: I already removed it. I think someone on the
dialog: film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only
dialog: reason I came here. To make do a little
dialog: private investigating of my own and make sure no
dialog: one here was planning anything.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: (whips out cellular)
dialog: I'm sorry, this is too good!
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Right. Sorry.

speaker_heading: (RE: ROMAN)
speaker_heading: DEWEY

dialog: I've got my suspicions but still,
dialog: nothing you say can ever make me take
dialog: my eyes off one person.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: And who is that?
text: But Dewey doesn't answer. Again, he's staring daggers through Gale. Years and
text: years of bottled up resentment is finally surfacing.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Jennifer needs me.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: I'm on duty.
text: Dewey races out the room. Gale pauses, stares at the interrogation. Wallace
text: has reduced Roman to tears. It's pathetic. Gale bolts after Dewey.

speaker_heading: DEWEY

speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Fuck!

text: TOM PRINZE, loaded off his ass, still holding a half-filled bottle of JOHNNY
text: WALKER BLACK LABEL SCOTCH in his hand.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Tom Prinze, tanked as usual.
dialog: That's a shocker.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Hey I really liked that piece you did on me
dialog: last month. The one where you said my car
dialog: accident was caused by me drinking and drugs,
dialog: and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my
dialog: insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya.
dialog: Stage the news to boost ratings.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Really, cause that stunt lost me the
dialog: lead role in Roman Polanski's latest
dialog: picture. Huh, what a coincide I was
dialog: picked up by Roman Bridger. Well,
dialog: not exactly the Roman I wanted. Get
dialog: my point? STAB 3 is bullshit. Fuck,
dialog: because of your big mouth I'm here,
dialog: drinking piss water SCOTCH with Second
dialog: rate fucking celebrities like Jennifer
dialog: Jollie and yourself!
dialog: (a beat, subtle)
dialog: Hey, I just got an idea. Maybe I should
dialog: Have a look at your break line. That your
dialog: car over there?
text: Gale pushes Tom's chest. Stopping him.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: I think we should go inside. I have to have
dialog: a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: You mean what's left of us.
dialog: (tosses empty bottle aside)
dialog: Yeah I'm running on empty anyways.
dialog: Gotta refuel.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. JENNIFER JOLLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Gale and Tom enter. Jennifer is crying hysterically in Dewey's arms. She sees
text: Gale, looks up with anger written all over her gaudy, over rouged face, her
text: make-up running in a comical, almost homage to Mimi on the Drew Carey Show.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now?
dialog: What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those
dialog: USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly
dialog: you suck at acting?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: God damn you Gale Weathers!
dialog: Don't you see? The killer is choosing his
dialog: victims as they die in the script!
text: Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed.
dialog: So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so
dialog: his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's
dialog: Candy, and now me!
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Wait a second, whoa! Calm down!
dialog: Number one there were five different
text: versions of the script given out.
dialog: Ben Damon was given a fake script because
dialog: he was only being offered the role.
text: It only had fragments of real scenes from the
dialog: actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?
text: Everyone is silent. Dewey nods his head. Gale rips the script from Jennifer's
dialog: hands.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: (reading script)
dialog: AND I DIE NAKED?! UGH!
dialog: This is complete bullshit.
dialog: Who wrote this piece of crap?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I know right. It was kinda weak.
dialog: That's cause Will Kennison only wrote
text: a rough treatment of it.
dialog: The script was written by some new guy.
dialog: He wrote Arlington Street.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Still that was a much better movie,
dialog: I saw it at the premiere last week.
dialog: God, what the hell am I getting sidetracked
dialog: with this shit for?! We've gotta get down to business.
text: A teary-eyed Angelina Tyler rises up from the couch, approaches the group.
speaker_heading: ANGELINA
dialog: (crying)
dialog: What are you talking about?
dialog: Because of this shit I'll probably never
text: act in a Hollywood film again.
text: Tom throws his arm around Angelina, squeezes her tightly.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Hey good looking, if you play your cards right,
dialog: I may be able to sit you down on my casting couch
dialog: and try you out for a few films my production
dialog: company is working on.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: How do you feel about a DEEP THROAT remake?
text: Angelina squeals in disgust, elbows Tom, racing out of the house. Tom groans,

dialog: I was only playing! Hey look, I can really
dialog: get you a bit part! Just come on out! Ok?
dialog: (pauses)
dialog: Damn it. There goes my chances of getting
text: some head from her.
text: Tom whips out a joint, pops it in his mouth. He lights it, walks around the
text: side of the house. A noise catches his attention. A low, muffled squealing.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Aaaangelina?
text: Tom turns to a guest house. The door is half open, darkness spilling out. Tom
text: smirks, steps inside.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The entire small interior of the GUEST HOUSE / DEWEY'S LIVING QUARTER'S IS

dialog: IT'S THE GHOST!
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Angelina?
text: Tom stops in his tracks. He looks down. Lying in a pool of blood at his feet
text: is ANGELINA TYLER! Tom screams, staggers backwards right into the arms of --
speaker_heading: THE GHOST --
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You fucker!
text: The GHOST slashes open Tom's arm. Tom screams, backs up into the kitchen. The
text: ghost grabs him by the throat, begins choking him mid-air. He slowly begins to
text: lift him off his feet, angling the knife, readying to make the kill blow. Tom
text: gags. He can't even scream, the killer's crushing his voice-box, causing a
text: trickle of blood down his lips.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (gagging)
dialog: Fucker!
text: THE GHOST brings the knife down, piercing Tom's heart, pinning him to the

speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: What about her?

speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Ssh. Maybe it's Tom or Angelina.
dialog: I'll get it.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: What if it's the killer?
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Oh use your brain drama queen!
dialog: Do the killers ever knock on the fucking door?
dialog: Ever see Jason do that before burying an axe in
dialog: some big titted blonde's head? Or maybe Michael or
dialog: Chucky? Huh?
text: Jennifer sticks her tongue out at Gale. Dewey reaches into a holster tucked

speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!

text: huddle together, follow close behind.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Do you smell something?
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: (smirking)
text: It's Gale. She farts when she gets nervous.
text: Gale makes an angry face, slaps Dewey upside the back of his headplay fully.
text: Dewey steps up to the front door. IT'S NOT LOCKED. He reaches for the knob,
dialog: turns it when suddenly --
text: THE POWER SIZZLES OUT!
scene_heading: EVERYONE SCREAMS!
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Alright don't panic! Just a fuse.
text: Dewey throws open the door. ANGELINA'S CORPSE drops into the doorway. A
text: SYMPHONY OF SCREAMS.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Hurry! Everyone out the back way! Now!
text: Dewey, Gale, and Jennifer race for the French doors in the living room leading

speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Oh shit it's my cell!
speaker_heading: DEWEY

dialog: What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
speaker_heading: GALE

speaker_heading: GHOST(O.S.)
dialog: I just might!
text: THE GHOST comes running out of closet, knife swinging wildly. Jennifer
text: screams, races for the patio door. The ghost lunges for Gale. Dewey draws up
text: his gun, fires.
text: BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The GHOST takes six slugs
text: In the chest. He goes smashing through a coffee table, motionless. Dewey
text: backs into Gale's arms, smoke rising fromthe muzzle of the gun.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: God damn it you two! Run! Hurry!

speaker_heading: GALE

speaker_heading: GALE

speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: GALE BEHIND YOU!
text: The ghost barrels out from under the couch, knife raised. Dewey winds back,

speaker_heading: JENNIFER

speaker_heading: DETECTIVE KINCAID
dialog: Whoever it is, now is taking credit
dialog: for Maureen Prescott's murder.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: But we know who killed Maureen Prescott,
dialog: Billy Loomis and Stu Macher. I mean, they
dialog: even told Sidney how they did it!
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE KINCAID
dialog: Yeah, but, if I'm not mistaken, you said in
dialog: your book that Sidney got it wrong before.
dialog: She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother,
dialog: and he was sent away for it! Maybe there is a
dialog: third killer. Sidney Might know something
text: Kincaid's eyes appear as if questioning Dewey.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: I told you, I don't know where Sidney is.
dialog: And even if there was a third killer,
dialog: Sidney doesn't know about it.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE KINCAID
dialog: That is for me to decide. I need to talk to her Mr. Riley,
dialog: she is a key element in this case. I have a press
dialog: conference
dialog: in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead
dialog: celebrities.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Four? There are five.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE KINCAID
dialog: Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling.
dialog: Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned
dialog: how to count.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE KINCAID
text: Police are still searching through the debris.
dialog: Could be days before we find her . . . that is,
dialog: if she's even there.
text: Kincaid seems to be getting a morbid charge out of all of this. He smirks ever
text: so nefariously at Dewey.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: OK, look. We all know that this has something to
dialog: do with 'Stab 3'. What we do not know is why the
text: killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE KINCAID
dialog: Actually, there was more this time.
dialog: This time, we found a picture too.
speaker_heading: DEWEY/GALE
dialog: (together)
dialog: What?
text: Kincaid holds up a second ziplocked evidence bag. Within is a blurry 5x4 of
text: MAUREEN PRESCOTT exiting a motel room with COTTON WEARY. Kincaid turns it
text: over. Also, written on it's back is 'I KILLED HER'
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE KINCAID
dialog: Before you jump to conclusions, the man in
text: the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country
text: on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's
dialog: got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's
dialog: supposedly the biggest thing down under since
dialog: Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: What does this have to do with Sid?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE KINCAID
dialog: Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her

dialog: was married to Maureen.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE WALLACE
dialog: (chiming in)

speaker_heading: DETECTIVE KINCAID

speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Is that a threat, Detective?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE KINCAID
dialog: When it's a threat, you'll know it.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Is that a threat?
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers
dialog: later? The issue is Maureen Prescott!
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE KINCAID

speaker_heading: DETECTIVE KINCAID
dialog: What? When?
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: What'd he say?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Oh, you know, the usual small talk,

dialog: to die?"
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've
dialog: gotten your number?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE KINCAID

speaker_heading: SIDNEY

dialog: Why didn't you say something?
speaker_heading: DEWEY

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Oh MY god.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Well, if you're watching this tape, it means
dialog: as I feared, I did not survive these killings
dialog: here at Windsor College. Anyway, the reason
dialog: I am here is to help you, so that my death
dialog: will not be in vain. That my life's work, will
text: help save some other poor soul from getting mutilated.
dialog: If this killer does come back, and he's for real,
dialog: there are a few things that you gotta remember.
dialog: Is this simply another sequel? Well, if it is, same
dialog: rules apply. But, here's the critical thing. If you
dialog: find yourself dealing with an unexpected backstory,
text: and a preponderance of exposition, then the sequel
dialog: rules do not apply. Because you are not dealing
dialog: with a sequel, you are dealing with the concluding
dialog: chapter of a trilogy.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: A trilogy?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: That's right. It's a rarity in the horror field,
dialog: but it does exist, and it's a force to be reckoned
dialog: with, because true trilogies are all about going back
dialog: to the beginning and discovering something that wasn't
dialog: true from the get go. 'Godfather', 'Jedi', all revealed
dialog: something that we thought was true, that wasn't true. So
dialog: if it is a trilogy you are dealing with, here are some
dialog: super trilogy rules. One, you got a killer who's gonna be
text: super human. Stabbing him won't work, shooting him
dialog: won't work, basically in the third one, you gotta
text: cryogenically freeze his head, decapitate him, or blow him
dialog: up. Number two; anyone including the main character can
dialog: die. This means you, Sid. I'm sorry, it's the final
dialog: chapter. It can be fuckin 'Reservoir Dogs' by the
dialog: time this thing is through. Number three; the past
dialog: will come back to bite you in the ass! Whatever you
dialog: think you know about the past, forget it. The past is
dialog: not at rest, any sins you think were committed in
dialog: the past are about to break out and destroy you. NUMBER
dialog: FOUR,Never, ever under any circumstances go running off

speaker_heading: GALE

speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: I don't think so! Just what happened to
dialog: Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go.

dialog: I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were.
dialog: It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get

dialog: another, no matter what she said afterwards.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Are you saying she was-
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: I'm saying things got out of hand. Maybe they
dialog: did take advantage of her!. Maybe the sad truth
dialog: is, this is not the city for innocence. No charges
dialog: were brought. And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds

dialog: Gale run!
text: Dewey jumps in the killer's path. The killer winds back, cracks the base of
text: the knife across Dewey's skull. Dewey drops to the floor unmoving.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Dewey!
text: CLANG! The Killer's blade glistens in the moonlight. He charges for Gale. Gale

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - OFFICES - NIGHT
text: Gale races down the hallway, frantically trying every door she passes. All of

text: with a ping. Gale unleashes a horrendous scream --
speaker_heading: MILTON --
text: --has been strung up from the ceiling ventilation duct, gutted from knob to
text: gullet. His entrails lie in steaming heaps at his feet.
text: GALE staggers away from the elevator, speechless. She screams again.
text: HER GHOSTLY ATTACKER is coming straight for her.
text: GALE fakes out the killer, dives into the elevator. He runs ahead, briefly,
text: giving Gale enough time to trip him sending him landing flat on his face. Gale

speaker_heading: VOICE(O.S.)

text: slashes open Kincaid's throat, stabs him in the chest. Kincaid drops onto the
text: hood of his car, dead.
text: GALE pauses. She's screaming hysterically. The killer raises the knife
text: menacingly.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I wouldn't run if I were you Gale.
dialog: It's only gonna end up with you getting

speaker_heading: GALE

text: the voice draws her back, angrily and cautioning.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Don't do it! If you do one thing to attract

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Fuck!
text: Wallace's keys rest on his desk. Sid ponders, takes them. She stands up when
text: something inside her makes her open Wallace's drawer and dig around. She pulls

text: That's the ticket. She closes the drawer, slinks out the side exit.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: VOICE

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: I thought you wanted me here?
text: Click the killer hangs up. Sid pockets her phone. She looks up, and is
text: startled out of fright. Posted alongside the sound stageis a huge production
text: poster for STAB 3 with a life-size GHOST wielding a big knife. Sid knows she's
text: in the right place. The door leading inside is half-open. Sid taps the

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. STAB 3 SETS - NIGHT
text: Sidney enters. She pauses. As a million things rush through her mind. To her

speaker_heading: SIDNEY

dialog: Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.
text: The killer hangs up. Sid pockets the phone. She walks past the MACHER GARAGE

text: CORPSE! Sidney flinches, covers her eyes. She walks on.
scene_heading: INT. BECKER HOUSE - SET - NIGHT
text: Sid steps through the living room of the BECKER set. It mirrors the house

dialog: The killer's looking for you!
dialog: Quick untie me!
text: Sid bolts through the shattered patio door out onto the backyard set. Seated
text: before a heated in ground pool, tied to a patio chair, beaten and gagged, is
text: DEWEY RIELLY. He's unconscious and almost appears at first glance like STEVEN
text: ORTH from SCREAM. Sid's jaw drops. This can't be possible. She looks down at
dialog: the phone.
speaker_heading: DEWEY(O.S.)
dialog: Good work Sid.
text: Sid screams, dropping the phone out of fright. She turns around coming face to
dialog: face with --
speaker_heading: THE GHOST
text: HE STANDS in the patio doorway. A monstrous version of the voice-changing box
text: in hand. He raises up the box, clicks a button and speaks.
speaker_heading: GHOST

dialog: You play a good game Sidney.
dialog: Now it's time to get down to business.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: GHOST
dialog: (click-now he's Maureen's voice)
dialog: Your other half.
text: The GHOST rushes Sid. She screams, takes off running. She bolts across the
text: darkened set, running straight up the front porch of a mock-up of her own
text: childhood home. She swings open the front door, slams it closed.
scene_heading: INT. PRESCOTT HOUSE - SET - NIGHT
text: Sid locks and bolts the front door. She backs away from it as the killer
text: begins to pounce against it, struggling to get inside. Sid hears something
text: upstairs. Like muffled cries. She races up to investigate.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SIDNEY'S BEDROOM - SET - NIGHT

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: GALE!

speaker_heading: GALE

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MAUREEN'S BEDROOM - PRESCOTT HOUSE SET - NIGHT
text: Gale and Sidney run into the master bedroom set, slamming the door shut and

text: outside. However, what's inside utterly horrifies her. The walls, the
text: furniture and the bed are splattered with blood. On the bed lies a corpse in a
text: black rubber body bag (supposedly Maureen's body). The door buckles under the
text: killer's blows. Gale and Sidney scream. They can't hold out much longer.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Jesus Christ Sidney get out of here!
dialog: He can't get us both!
text: A knife splinters through the door, inches from Gale's face. She screams.
speaker_heading: GALE
speaker_heading: RUNNN!
text: Sid backs away, hysterical. She raises up the gun, fires into the door. BLAM!
text: BLAM! BLAM! Gale ducks out of the way. Silence.
text: The door ceases to move. AND THEN --
text: THE BODY BAG UNZIPS and the second GHOST emerges, knife in hand. The girls
text: utter horrified screams. Sid raises up the gun, goes to fire when suddenly --
speaker_heading: BAM!
text: The bedroom door's kicked down and the other killer enters, grabbing Sid by
text: her shoulders, batting the gun from her hands.
text: Sid screams, punches her attacker in the chest. He winces.
text: The second Ghost grabs Gale, holds the knife to her throat, stopping her in
text: her tracks. Sid makes a beeline for the window, leaps through the glass.
text: THE WINDOW SHATTERS.
text: Sid comes flying out onto the patio awning. She rolls over onto the astro-turf
text: grass, momentarily motionless. And then she comes to. Her eyes flickering
text: open, blurrily staring up at --
text: THE GHOST, leering out the shattered window frame.
text: SID stands up, takes off running towards --
text: THE MACHER HOUSE SET.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FOYER - MACHER HOUSE SET - NIGHT
text: Sid races into the foyer, slams the door closed behind her. Again, locking and

text: Woodsboro. This is where the climax of the original battle between good and
text: evil wasfought. It's déjr vu all over again. Footsteps O.S.
speaker_heading: DEWEY(O.S.)

dialog: Hold it right there you fucker!
text: Dewey goes to fire. CLICK. CLICK. CLICK. Out of bullets.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: OH shit!
text: THE GHOST winds back, launches the knife. It swirls through space before
text: embedding into Dewey's arm, launching him back through the doorway. Sidney
text: screams. Dewey's unconscious again. The GHOST races for the open door. Sid
text: screams, kicks it closed. Locking and bolting it again. A crash O.S. Sid turns
dialog: around --
text: A BODY rolls down the staircase, covered in blood. It comes to a halt at
text: Sidney's feet, an unmoving, rumpled figure.
scene_heading: IT'S ANGELINA TYLER.

speaker_heading: VOICE(O.S.)
dialog: You're not going anywhere Sidney.
dialog: It's time you came to terms with me, and with
dialog: mother! Maybe you never knew her at all, Sid.
dialog: Maybe you can't get past the surface of things.
text: The GHOST enters frame, ripping open his costume to reveal a KEVLAR bullet
text: proof vest.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Who the hell are you?
speaker_heading: THE GHOST
dialog: The other half of you! I searched for a mother too,
dialog: an actress named Rina Reynolds. I tried to find her
dialog: my whole life. And four years ago I actually tracked
text: her down, knocked on her door, thinking she'd welcome
dialog: me back with open arms, but she had a new life and a
dialog: new name, Maureen Prescott! You were the only
dialog: child she claimed Sidney. She shut me out in the cold
dialog: forever, her own son!
text: THE GHOST rips off his mask. IT'S ROMAN. Sidney's deathly quiet.
speaker_heading: ROMAN
dialog: Roman Bridger, director. And brother.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was
dialog: Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me,
dialog: what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little
dialog: home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen,
dialog: mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one
dialog: thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father,
dialog: that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing
dialog: his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And
dialog: once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was
dialog: a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case
dialog: you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like
dialog: her was making a movie.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: All the nightmares. All the hell I went through
dialog: was because of you, you spineless bastard!
speaker_heading: ROMAN
dialog: I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example,
dialog: Angelina over there,
dialog: (Angelina smiles)

speaker_heading: SIDNEY

dialog: Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?
speaker_heading: ANGELINA
dialog: That's me Sid. I always idolized you. You
dialog: were always my hero. That's why I'm here Sidney.
dialog: I wanted to make you proud.
speaker_heading: ROMAN
dialog: And I kinda keep her around cause it's a bit of
dialog: a turn-on. You know, in the movies she's you Sid, so every
dialog: time I jump her bones, I'm doing YOU, technically.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: (repulsed)
dialog: Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit
dialog: before! So lets get on with it!
speaker_heading: ROMAN
dialog: Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun.
dialog: You haven't seen the best part.
dialog: (pulls out tape recorder)
dialog: With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've
dialog: been able to steal your voice.
dialog: (presses play)
dialog: Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna
dialog: find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: (off tape recorder)
dialog: I can't take it anymore. This Hollywood exploitation

dialog: His parties, his flings, exploited the Hollywood nobody!
dialog: That's whyI had to make him pay. Daddy dearest is dead.
dialog: Mommy's dead. Looks like I'm an orphan all alone

speaker_heading: SIDNEY--

speaker_heading: SUDDENLY,
text: WHAM! The laundry room door swings open and the GHOST emerges, KNIFE in hand.
text: He buries the knife deep into Roman's chest, sending him flying backwards.
text: Sidney screams. The ghost stops in his tracks, pulling off his mask --
text: IT'S ONLY DEWEY. He can barely stand up. He's bleeding profusely from his
dialog: wounds.
text: Dewey and Sid embrace.

dialog: He wasn't superhuman at all.
text: THEN A HORRIFYING SCREAM rips through the air.
text: ANGELINA comes racing out of the living room, face a blackened, Kentucky-fried
text: mess. Everyone screams, one epic last scream. Sid raises up the gun, fires,
text: hitting Angelina dead center between the eyes, sending a splash of blood and
text: brain matter onto the wall behind her.
speaker_heading: GALE
