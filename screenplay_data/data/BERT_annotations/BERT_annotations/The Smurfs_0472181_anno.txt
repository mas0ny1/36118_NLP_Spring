scene_heading: EXT. DEEP IN THE WOODS (LIVE ACTION) - DAY
text: PUSH IN SLOWLY through thick ferns, mossy trees. Peaceful,
text: but like the calm before the storm. Like a scene from
text: Jurassic Park. Suddenly, a LOW RUMBLE... the sound of FEET
text: rushing. Little feet. Lots of them.
text: A FLASH OF BLUE in the underbrush. And another. Then... An
text: explosion of blue and white as a throng of blue GNOME-LIKE
text: creatures (SMURFS) explode into view, frantically fleeing with
text: gazelle-like precision or like a school of land-going fish.
text: (NOTE: Smurfs will be CGI in a live-action world, throughout).
text: As they whip past camera, a beast explodes from the bushes,
text: leaping directly toward the SCREEN, claws and fangs bared.
text: It’s a huge mangy HOUSE CAT -- terrifying from a Smurf’s POV.
text: At the head of the Smurfs is a sweet, dopey, but terrified
text: looking fellow. This is CLUMSY. We rocket into a CU of his
text: face and... FREEZE FRAME.

text: ANGLE ON Vanity and SMURFETTE, leading a group of SMURFS in a

speaker_heading: VANITY
dialog: Five, six, seven, eight!
speaker_heading: SMURFETTE
dialog: That's it, Clumsy, feel the rhythm.
dialog: Good job, Hefty. Almost lunch time,
dialog: Greedy, hang in there.
text: Brainy supervises decorations nearby, but can’t resist
text: interjecting.
speaker_heading: BRAINY
dialog: No, no, no! You call that dancing?!
speaker_heading: VANITY
dialog: I told you it was too complicated.
scene_heading: THE SMURFS - Stem & Weiss - 6/16/09 2.
speaker_heading: BRAINY
dialog: I’m sorry. What part of “step-ball-
dialog: change, pas de beurre, jazz hands” is
dialog: so hard to understand?!
text: The stare at him, blankly.
speaker_heading: HEFTY
dialog: The whole thing.
speaker_heading: CLUMSY
dialog: We could do the hokey pokey.
speaker_heading: BRAINY
dialog: Look who’s talking, it’s the dancing
dialog: bear!
text: Brainy does an comic impression of Clumsy’s dancing.
speaker_heading: VANITY
dialog: He’s doing the best he can... with
dialog: what little he has.
speaker_heading: CLUMSY
dialog: Thank you. I think.
speaker_heading: BRAINY
dialog: (to Greedy)
dialog: And you! Every time you turn it’s
text: like watching jelly jiggle. And
dialog: don’t get me started on this guy!
text: He turns to Gutsy, a tough-looking Smurf in a kilt who stares
dialog: him down.
speaker_heading: GUTSY
dialog: (in thick Scottish brogue)
dialog: Watch wat ya say lad, or you'll be
dialog: wearing yer lips like a scarf!
speaker_heading: BRAINY
dialog: Because he’s doing fine.
speaker_heading: LAZY
dialog: All this dancing’s making me tired.
text: Lazy YAWNS and falls face-first into the dirt, asleep.

dialog: Anything, except getting you people
dialog: to dance right. Now, from the top!
text: On Brainy’s CUE, the SMURF ORCHESTRA launches into SONG #1 --
text: a celebration of the powers of the Blue Moon. CRAZY, who can
text: make virtually any noise with his mouth, takes vocals as the
text: others break out in an insane Busby-Berkely dance number.
speaker_heading: SMURFETTE AND SMURFS (SINGING)
dialog: La la la-la-la-la la la la la la...
text: With Smurfette front and center, the otherwise all-male dance
text: troupe can’t keep their eyes off of her. Many are injured.
text: In the end, Clumsy trips, setting off a chain reaction of

scene_heading: INT. PAPA SMURF’S MUSHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: PAPA, the oldest and wisest of Smurfs (set apart by his beard

speaker_heading: CLUMSY (0.S.)
dialog: Papa Smurf! Papa Smurf!
text: Papa pours one drop... then, WHAM! The door flies open and
text: Clumsy rushes in. Startled, Papa drops in the whole bottle
text: and the potion explodes.
speaker_heading: PAPA
dialog: (swallowing his temper)
dialog: Yeeees, Clumsy? What is it?
speaker_heading: CLUMSY
dialog: Brainy sent me to see if you need any
text: help getting ready for the festival.
speaker_heading: PAPA
dialog: He sent you here? I thought you were
dialog: dancing.
speaker_heading: CLUMSY
dialog: He said my dancing was so good, I
dialog: should take a break so he doesn’t
dialog: pull his hair out in happiness!
scene_heading: THE SMURFS - Stem & Weiss - 6/16/09 4.
text: Smurfette appears in the doorway.
speaker_heading: PAPA
dialog: Let me guess, another helper?
speaker_heading: SMURFETTE
dialog: Or else Brainy said I have to dance
dialog: in a burka. What is a burka?
speaker_heading: PAPA
dialog: Very well, why don’t you two go pick
dialog: Smurfberries while I gather more
dialog: starweed, for our wishing potion.
speaker_heading: SMURFETTE
dialog: Papa, we have barrels of berries.
speaker_heading: CLUMSY
dialog: Can I get the starweed, Papa?
dialog: Please! It’s my fault you ran out.
speaker_heading: SMURFETTE
dialog: I could go with him.
speaker_heading: PAPA
dialog: No, no. The starweed grows too close
dialog: to Gargamel’s castle. It’s far too
dialog: dangerous for young Smurfs.
speaker_heading: CLUMSY
dialog: But I’m brave! If danger comes, I’1l
dialog: just freeze, like you taught us.
text: Striking an absurd “blending” in pose, Clumsy hits a pile of
text: ancient books, which buries him. He leaps back up.
speaker_heading: CLUMSY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m o-kay
speaker_heading: PAPA
dialog: Smurfnabit, Clumsy...
dialog: (catching himself)
dialog: I mean... I’1l just get the starweed
dialog: myself this time. Why don’t you too
dialog: run along and help set the table?
speaker_heading: CLUMSY
dialog: Oh. Sure, Papa Smurf... Sorry.

dialog: From 0.S.
speaker_heading: PAPA
dialog: What? Don’t smurf around the bush,

speaker_heading: SMURFETTE
dialog: When are you going to realize we're

dialog: boys are one-hundred and four.
speaker_heading: PAPA
dialog: Mere toddlers, my dear. A Papa's
dialog: work is never done.
speaker_heading: SMURFETTE
dialog: Well, it might be, if you let us help
dialog: you a little more. I worry about you
dialog: -- always working so hard.
speaker_heading: PAPA
dialog: (fixing her hair)
dialog: Ahhh, my sweet little Smurfette.
speaker_heading: SMURFETTE
dialog: I mean it, Papa. You’ve raised us
dialog: really well. It’s time you trust us
dialog: with more responsibility and take

scene_heading: TONY ROBBINS-HOOD

speaker_heading: TONY ROBBINS-HOOD (CONT’D)
dialog: And how better, than with my new

scene_heading: TONY ROBBINS-HOOD
dialog: Smurfs? The mythical blue folk in
dialog: tiny white pants and hats? About
dialog: three apples high?
speaker_heading: GARGAMEL (HOODED FIGURE)
dialog: Aye, the very same. Treacherous
dialog: creatures whose very essence can be

scene_heading: THE SMURFS - Stem & Weiss - 6/16/09 7.
scene_heading: TONY ROBBINS-HOOD
dialog: Sir, I offer science, not

text: HOWLS of LAUGHTER. A WIZARD LAUGHS so hard, LIGHTNING from

speaker_heading: NEWT (COCKNEY ACCENT)
dialog: I remember you! Flunked out of
text: Sorcerers Tech. Obsessed with
dialog: Smurfs. Had this huge stupid cat.
speaker_heading: GARGAMEL
dialog: Don’t be absurd.
text: MEOOOW. AZRAEL, the huge scraggly CAT, whom we recognize from
text: the opening, rubs against Gargamel’s leg.
speaker_heading: GARGAMEL (CONT’D)
dialog: Not now, Azrael.
text: The crowd LAUGHS again.
scene_heading: TONY ROBBINS-HOOD
dialog: Wait! I believe I do have bit of

text: Tony produces part of a tattered BLUE SCROLL. Gargamel GASPS.
speaker_heading: TONY ROBBINS-HOOD (CONT’D)
dialog: Won it in Parchesi from a peg-legged
dialog: crusader. Bark like a dog and it’s
dialog: all yours! Come now, you
dialog: superstitious peasant. Awwwwooooo!
text: More LAUGHTER. Furious, Gargamel throws back his hood to
text: reveal the face of a brilliant, but hapless madman.
speaker_heading: GARGAMEL (HOODED FIGURE)
dialog: You'll rue the day you laughed at the
dialog: great, and soon to be exceedingly
dialog: powerful... Gargamel.
text: Hurling a vial to the floor, POOF! Gargamel vanishes in a

speaker_heading: GARGAMEL (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Who's laughing now? Who? Or is it
dialog: whom? Either way, it is I, I!
scene_heading: THE SMURFS - Stem & Weiss - 6/16/09 8.
text: But as he gloats, he doesn’t notice his invisibility wear
text: off... until Tony decks him into the crowd. KNIGHTS fall like
text: dominos. Lanterns fly. Flames erupt. Everyone flees.
scene_heading: EXT. MEDIEVAL TOWN - FAIRE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: People rush from the fire. Gargamel staggers out with Azrael.
speaker_heading: GARGAMEL
dialog: Cursed invisibility spell! Making a
dialog: mockery of me! But with this, we
dialog: shall never be mocked again.
dialog: (reveals scroll segment)
dialog: Feast your eyes, Azrael! Feast!
text: They stare absurdly at the scroll segment for a beat,
text: “feasting.” Clearly, it bears greater import than Tony knew.
speaker_heading: GARGAMEL (CONT’D)
dialog: This will lead us to the Smurfs. And
dialog: when we extract the essence of those
dialog: wretched beasts, pure, unfailing,
dialog: unimaginable power will be ours. And

text: A FAIRE GOER, among MANY taking lessons at “BILL TELL’S”

scene_heading: EXT. DEEP WOODS - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: A tiny BLUE HAND reaches from within the undergrowth and picks
text: a starweed flower. TILTDOWN down to reveal Clumsy, filling a
text: sack with the flowers for Papa. berry... then another.
text: Nearby, a few more BLUE HANDS suddenly pick a branch clean.
speaker_heading: CLUMSY
dialog: We’re too young to pick starweed?
dialog: Ha. It’s too dangerous? Pleeease.
text: THWACK! William Tell’s apple-laden arrow lands like a totem

speaker_heading: GARGAMEL
dialog: (stops abruptly)
dialog: Now you’re just milking it.

speaker_heading: CLUMSY
dialog: He’s coming! He’s coming!
text: Up ahead, a troop of other SMURFS stop picking smurfberries

text: Clumsy charges through the group and they instantanly follow.
text: FREEZE FRAME: On Clumsy’s terrified face.
text: SUPER: “THIS IS WHERE YOU CAME IN.”
text: The action resumes as the Gazelle-like pack rushes through the

speaker_heading: JOKEY

scene_heading: THE SMURFS - Stem & Weiss - 6/16/09 10.

text: Papa and Clumsy dash for a mushroom cottage. But Gargamel

speaker_heading: SMURFETTE
dialog: Forbidden Grottos?! The last Smurf

dialog: Hey, look! The Blue Moon!
text: Peeking through trees, a huge BLUE MOON edges over the ravine.

speaker_heading: PAPA
dialog: Clumsy, no!
text: He reaches for Clumsy’s wrist just as THHHHHP! Clumsy flails
text: backwards, sucked INTO THE MAGICAL FALLS, enveloped in a
text: RAINBOW of ENERGY. He disappears through the once solid rock
text: wall behind the falls. Papa’s pulled in too. Followed by one

text: Gargamel bursts onto the scene only to find... they’re gone.
speaker_heading: GARGAMEL
dialog: Cowards! Come out and fight like

speaker_heading: CLUMSY
dialog: Papa?

scene_heading: EXT. FORBIDDEN GROTTOS - NIGHT

speaker_heading: PATRICK

text: Patrick glances about for a way to make this true. Among the

speaker_heading: GRACIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you talk to Odile about

scene_heading: EXT. SOUVENIR TENT - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: VAN

speaker_heading: GARGAMEL

speaker_heading: PATRICK

speaker_heading: ODILE

speaker_heading: GARGAMEL
dialog: (to Patrick)
dialog: Stop! Thief! That’s my Smurf!
text: Gargamel’s cry is lost in the CROWD NOISE. Oblivious, Patrick

text: Gargamel charges, but the Taxi pulls away, leaving him GASPING

speaker_heading: PAPA

speaker_heading: GREEDY
dialog: Mmmmm!
text: Suddenly, their world goes BLACK as a cargo lid is lowered

text: A FEDEX GUY secures the lid while his PARTNER labels it with
text: the tape gun. The container is hoisted. Gargamel leaps for it.
scene_heading: THE SMURFS - Stem & Weiss - 6/16/09 21.
speaker_heading: GARGAMEL
dialog: No! My Smurfs! Mine! Miiiine!
text: He falls on his back, clutching a shred of label and tape, the

speaker_heading: FEDEX WORKER
dialog: And they'll absolutely positively be

text: Gargamel calls to a PASSERBY.
speaker_heading: GARGAMEL
dialog: You, knave! Pray tell, where is the

speaker_heading: GARGAMEL

speaker_heading: GARGAMEL
dialog: Yes, of course. Wouldn’t want to

dialog: your flying machine.
text: He steps away from the counter and begins rummaging in his

scene_heading: INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT
text: A perfectly quiet, normal flight. A MAN gets up to retrieve

scene_heading: INT. OVERHEAD BIN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: The bin opens. In the dark far end, a pocket in a carry-on

speaker_heading: TINY GARGAMEL
dialog: Of course, I thought this through.
dialog: It’s a standard Class A Shrinking

scene_heading: INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: INT. WINSLOW HOUSE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
text: The door latch JIGGLES and SHAKES. Finally the stuck door is
text: shouldered open and Patrick enters with his bags. He slips
text: his shoes off and tip toes up the stairs, noting swatches of
text: PAINT SAMPLES remaining from unfinished tests, long ago.
text: IN Sam’S ROOM -- Patrick tousles his son’s hair and slides a
text: new snow globe on the desk -- beside a row of similar snow
text: globes Patrick’s brought back from all over the world.
text: IN SOPHIE’S ROOM -- Patrick finds his young daughter asleep in
text: her princess bed. Patrick slides Clumsy beneath one arm, then
text: kisses her on the head. Sophie stirs just enough to notice
text: the gift and smile. Patrick smiles, too, and exits.
text: Clumsy’s eyes pop open. He tries to squirm free, but Sophie
text: rolls over, pinning him beneath her chest. He’s struggles,
text: but can’t move. Exhausted, he lays back and passes out.
text: IN THE MASTER BEDROOM -- Patrick quietly undresses and readies
text: to climb into bed beside a clearly exhausted Gracie. He steps
text: on a toy, which launches into SONG, waking baby Reina, who
text: bursts into tears. Gracie starts to get up.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I got it.

text: Clumsy YAWNS and stretches in the first morning light.
text: Suddenly, he jolts awake, no idea where he is.
text: Inching from beneath Sophie, he takes in the giant princess,
text: then backs into something wet. He turns and stares into the
text: sleeping snout of Tarzan, the beagle.
text: Clumsy backs into a pile of toys, burying himself in an

scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Clumsy heaves the great door closed, then scales the sink

text: ON THE COUNTER: Clumsy collapses to catch his breath. After a
text: beat, he SNIFFS something sweet and follows his nose to... the
scene_heading: BERRY-BURST liquid HAND SOAP.
text: Famished, he sucks down a mouthful, then grimaces, BURPING a
text: huge BUBBLE. Stepping back, he triggers the BLOW DRYER which
text: sets him running in place in pool of slippy soap.
text: Reaching for support, Clumsy yanks the plug and all is QUIET.
text: He spots a “crystal pool,” below and climbs eagerly down...
text: INTO THE TOILET: HUMMING happily, Clumsy enjoys a quick splash
text: under the arms and a GARGLE. Ahh, refreshing. To climb out,
text: he grabs the handle... FLUSH!
text: Flailing wildly for balance, Clumsy grab the toilet paper,
text: which unfurls as he falls toward the raging whirlpool below.
text: Just as he would be lost, he’s plucked free. Clumsy looks up

speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I know you're alive... I saw you.

speaker_heading: ODILE (0.S. - ON PHONE)
text: Gargamel, dahling. Just checking in.

speaker_heading: PAPA
dialog: (holding his star notes)
dialog: Quiet, everyone! Please! I'm afraid

speaker_heading: PAPA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: PAPA
dialog: Well, it helps not to think of them

dialog: (off Patrick’s look)
dialog: Smurf be told... I’m a little over my

speaker_heading: PATRICK

dialog: Uh... Like what?
speaker_heading: PAPA
dialog: Ah. Well, there’s a book of magic

scene_heading: THE SMURFS - Stem & Weiss - 6/16/09 59.
speaker_heading: PATRICK

speaker_heading: PAPA

speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Oh, wow. Mr. Smurf, I’d love to help

speaker_heading: PATRICK

speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: So... You think I should just come
dialog: out and tell her?
speaker_heading: PAPA
dialog: I often find with my little Smurfs,
text: the truth, gently coated with tender
dialog: care, is easier to hear. Do
text: something meaningful for her. Then
dialog: share... Then duck.
scene_heading: THE SMURFS - Stem & Weiss - 6/16/09 60.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Something meaningful, huh? Hmmm...

speaker_heading: CHINESE MAN

speaker_heading: PAPA
dialog: Run!
text: The Smurfs flee through a beaded curtain into the back room.
text: Bringing up the rear, Papa pauses in archway to fend off
dialog: Azrael just as...
text: Gargamel LAUGHS and fires another MAGIC BOLT from his scepter.
text: Papa grabs a souvenir mirror and, bracing himself, deflects
text: the energy away from his Smurfs, bouncing it wildly around the
text: store. Books and shelves fly. Azrael YOWLS for cover.
speaker_heading: GARGAMEL
dialog: (dodges an energy bolt)
dialog: Oh, do struggle Papa Smurf! You only
dialog: make the hunt more savory.
speaker_heading: PAPA
dialog: Yeah? Savor this!
text: Papa strains to aim the mirror at the display of ceremonial

text: THWACK! THWACK! THWACK! They stick in the floor around
text: Gargamel, pinning him via his robe to the ground.
speaker_heading: GARGAMEL
dialog: (furious, re robe)

speaker_heading: CLUMSY
dialog: Noooooce! Papaaaaaa!
text: Left alone with Gargamel, Papa holds the mirror against the
text: scepter’s beam as long as he can but finally...
speaker_heading: GARGAMEL
dialog: Face it Papa... You’re smurfed.
text: A final massive bolt of blue magic freezes Papa in an agonized
text: pose. Gargamel pulls out his new camera/phone.
speaker_heading: GARGAMEL (CONT’D)
dialog: Hold that thought! I want this
dialog: moment to last forever.

scene_heading: EXT. STORM DRAIN - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

text: The Gull SQUAWKS and rears back, but Gutsy holds tight.
speaker_heading: GUTSY
dialog: Atta’ girrrl! Shoo us watcha’ got!

speaker_heading: GUTSY (CONT'D)
dialog: At's it, Heft! Shoo‘em oo's boss!

scene_heading: THE SMURFS - Stem & Weiss - 6/16/09 86.
text: Gargamel pours the last of the essense into his Dragon Scepter
text: and takes aim on the dungeon... WAZAAM! Wicker chairs become
text: mushroom-shaped smurf cages. Street barricades morph into
text: smurf-sized “cattle” chutes.
text: In moments, Belevadere is transformed into a Frankenstein-like
text: “essence factory.” Huge wooden cogs and gears move conveyers
text: of vials past old-fashioned, Smurf-sized, sweatboxes and
text: “exercise” machinery, which sprout “essence collecting tubes.”
speaker_heading: GARGAMEL (CONT’D)
dialog: Say hello to your new home, Papa.

speaker_heading: PATRICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen... Gracie, about Paris. I’m

speaker_heading: GRACIE

speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: C’mon, guys, I’m sure we’ll find ‘em.
dialog: (off their glares)
dialog: Look, I’m really sorry, alright? I
dialog: didn’t know who that guy was. I did
dialog: the best I could. So, don’t look at
dialog: me with those big, sad--
text: WAAAA! They break into more inconsolable, comic tears.
text: Smurfette leads Patrick away from the bunch and hops up on a
text: table to speak with him.
speaker_heading: SMURFETTE
dialog: They don’t blame you. They’re just
dialog: scared. They miss their Papa.
dialog: Remember how it felt when you were

speaker_heading: PATRICK

dialog: Actually, no. My dad passed away

speaker_heading: SMURFETTE
dialog: Oh. Gosh No Papa?... You poor thing.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: No, it’s not like that... it’s fine.

dialog: Okay, so it was a little hard... My
dialog: mom had to work two jobs to keep food
text: on the table, and I barely saw her.
dialog: But, you know, you adjust. You get by.
text: Smurfette gazes up, aching for him, her big eyes moistening.
text: Patrick pauses, his own bullshit failing to comfort even him.
text: He glances away... to the mantle... A FAMILY PORTRAIT of him,
text: Gracie and the kids in happier, more carefree times. In the

speaker_heading: PATRICK (CONT’D)
dialog: What am I doing? What’s wrong with
dialog: me? I’m about to throw everything
dialog: that matters to me away... and for

speaker_heading: SMURFETTE
dialog: You're scared.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I’m terrified. It’s like I have to

dialog: to keep up. And if I ever stop... I
dialog: don't know... We’ll end up living in
text: a box somewhere.
speaker_heading: SMURFETTE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Well... we live in mushrooms. And
dialog: because we have each other... it’s
dialog: really nice.
text: Patrick smiles, warming to the notion of maybe letting go...
text: just a little. Suddenly...
text: WHAM! A SEAGULL smashes into the window behind him. Another

text: Hefty forces his bird into an emergency landing on the table.
text: Clumsy clings to his neck.
speaker_heading: CLUMSY

text: through the undergrowth all around him.
text: With PENCILS for spears and LASER POINTERS to temporary blind
text: Gargamel, the Smurfs hold their own in the first wave.
text: Annoyed, Gargamel stirs the sky with his scepter. Thunderous
text: CLOUDS appear, only over his portion of the park. Rooftop

speaker_heading: HANDY
dialog: Don’t point it at anyone unless you

scene_heading: THE SMURFS - Stem & Weiss - 6/16/09 96.

speaker_heading: GARGAMEL GUTSY
dialog: Gooooooed kitty! Aaaaaaaaaaaaagh!
text: Gutsy, drops the wand and spins out of control, disappearing

text: ON GARGAMEL: IN SLOW MO, he makes a diving leap for the wand
text: as it tumbles toward an open subway vent.
text: Horses SCREAM as a late-night CARRIAGE stops just short of

speaker_heading: PAPA
dialog: (unfurling the spell)
dialog: Brainy... Do the honors?... You

speaker_heading: BRAINY
dialog: Unimoonibus... Bluticus...
dialog: Yarayak.... Kahol...
text: WHOOSH! A mighty WIND blasts through the park, spreading a
text: thick FOG. Veiled in the fog, a huge MOON appears to rise...
text: its glow, distinctively BLUE. The Winslows’ jaws drop.
scene_heading: THE SMURFS - Stem & Weiss - 6/16/09 101.
speaker_heading: HEFTY
dialog: Look!
text: The pond waters being to roil. As in the Forbidden Grottos, a
text: glistening rock formation rises up. A SHIMMERING PORTAL
text: blazes behind the falling waters. A rocky path emerges,
text: leading to shore.
text: Suddenly, a horse-drawn carriage charges up in the distance.
speaker_heading: GARGAMEL
dialog: Ya! YAAAAAA!
speaker_heading: PAPA
dialog: Go! Go!
text: Lesser known Smurfs charge across the watery path and dive
text: through the portal with hardly time to wave goodbye.
text: The carriage bears down with terrifying speed with Gargamel,
text: standing beside Azrael, whipping the horses like Ben Hur.
text: Panicked smurfs cross into the portal as fast as they can.
text: Gargamel aims his scepter... ZAP! A bolt of blue energy
text: OBLITERATES THE PORTAL, trapping Papa and half the smurfs in
dialog: our world while the other half are trapped in theirs.
text: Gargamel aims again, this time directly at Papa and the
text: remaining Smurfs. As they SCREAM and scramble for cover, we
text: hear the familiar whir of SPUTTERING ROTORS...
speaker_heading: GUTSY (0.S.)
dialog: Pick on someone yer oon size, ya’
dialog: smurrrfin' wanker!
text: Gutsy has risen and is diving for Gargamel.
speaker_heading: PAPA
dialog: Gutsy, noooooo!
text: BAM! Gutsy kamikazees into Gargamel's head. The copter
text: disintegrates, hurling Gutsy onto the horses face. Gargamel
text: falls back in the carriage, missing his shot.
text: IN SLOW MO: the wand flies through the air... little blue
text: hands dive for it. It falls to... CLUMSY. He grabs... He
text: bobbles... collapses... drops the wand into the murky pond.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE/PAPA
dialog: Clumsy!
text: They run to help him.
scene_heading: THE SMURFS - Stem & Weiss - 6/16/09 102.
speaker_heading: BRAINY
dialog: Gutsy!
text: All eyes turn to see the runaway horse, freaked by the blue
text: creature clinging to it’s face, rear up at the WALL of the
text: 79TH STREET TRANSVERSE. Gargamel, Azrael and Gutsy are thrown
text: over the wall, toward the speeding traffic below.
scene_heading: GUTSY & GARGAMEL AZRAEL
dialog: Aaaaaaaaaaagh! Yeeeeeeeeeoow!l !
text: WHAP! Gargamel and Azrael are comically flattened on the
text: windshield of a passing bus. It carries them away, with BLUE

text: Winslows and Smurfs are shocked at Gutsy’s sacrifice. Then...
speaker_heading: GUTSY (0.S.)
dialog: Well, doon jus’ stand thar! Give a
dialog: Smurrrf a hand!
text: A tiny blue hand reaches over from the wall... Gutsy’s
text: clinging safely above the speeding traffic. The Smurfs CHEER
text: as Sam, Hefty and others rush to pull him to safety.
text: Angle on Papa and Patrick.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: (re destroyed Portal)
dialog: What are you going to do?
text: Papa looks up at the moon as the fog clears away... It’s
text: clearly no longer blue.
speaker_heading: PAPA
dialog: I don’t know... I really don’t know.
speaker_heading: HEFTY
dialog: Hey... Look.
text: An inky BLUE spreads from where the wand went in. The
text: reflection of the moon is also blue, but the real moon is
text: still only white.
text: Clumsy, lies weak on the shore, his head in Sophie’s lap.
speaker_heading: CLUMSY
dialog: I’m sorry guys... I-- blew it again.
text: Spent and pale, Clumsy’s hand drops into the water.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Clumsy?
scene_heading: THE SMURFS - Stem & Weiss - 6/16/09 103.
speaker_heading: CLUMSY
dialog: I just wish... the moon was really
dialog: blue... and you all could go home.
text: Triggered at Clumsy’s hand in the water, the magic blue
text: essence shimmers on the water. BLUE ENERGY arcs over the
text: surface of the pond, dancing on the reflection of the moon...
text: Then, it rises up toward the Moon itself.
speaker_heading: GUTSY
dialog: Grrreat Smurf!
text: Everyone looks up to see the Moon actually turning BLUE.
text: Clumsy’s eyes open as the color begins to return to his hand,
text: then spreads to his whole body.
speaker_heading: PAPA
dialog: Great Smurf, indeed! Clumsy! You've
dialog: done it!
text: Clumsy sits up, renewed as the portal begins to rise from the
text: water again. The Smurfs stare in awe as the rocky path re-
text: emerges to bear them home.
text: QUICK SHOTS ALL OVER NEW YORK: NIGHT-LIFERS and WILDLIFE stop
text: to gaze up in amazement at the BLUE MOON.
text: IN THE PARK: Smurfs eagerly line up to walk the shimmering
text: stone path to the portal, where Brainy directs them through.
text: Each returns to their deep blue as they dive in.
speaker_heading: BRAINY
dialog: Come along everyone. No telling how
dialog: long the spell will last.
text: Hefty approaches the portal, then turns and waves to the
dialog: Winslows.
speaker_heading: HEFTY
dialog: Good bye! We’ll never forget you!
text: As the Winslows wave back, Hefty reaches out a tentative
text: hand... WHOOSH! He’s sucked through before he knows what
text: happened. A line of others wave goodbye and follow.
text: Gutsy, Jokey and Vanity and Romeo get in line.
speaker_heading: ROMEO

speaker_heading: PATRICK

speaker_heading: PAPA
dialog: If you work together, and truly

speaker_heading: REINA

speaker_heading: BRAINY

speaker_heading: WINSLOWS
dialog: Goodbye.
scene_heading: CLUMSY /BRAINY /PAPA/SMURFETTE
dialog: Auf-Wiedersmurf!
text: Brainy waves and goes in. Papa waves, takes Clumsy’s hand and
