text: a long rising line-- half smiles--
scene_heading: We see headings: DEATHS, NATURAL; DEATHS, MISHAP; CHILD

speaker_heading: KEVIN (cont'd)
dialog: But-- there's no estate-- the

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I saw that. So-- what do we do?
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: (galled)
dialog: Don't make me file with the state--
dialog: for a twenty-five-hundred dollar
dialog: policy?
text: John bristles-- Kevin sees it--
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We file with the state. So one
dialog: day, in the unlikely event somebody

speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: (scoops up the file)

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Well, illegitimate children will

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We spent three hundred thousand
dialog: bucks for these guys to make us
dialog: this new model, new field-data, new

dialog: but they screwed up all the decimal
dialog: weights. It's three-hundred

dialog: Kevin-- following as best he can--
speaker_heading: JOHN (cont'd)
dialog: But even so, it says people with

dialog: longer than people with one--
dialog: (flipping pages)
dialog: Smoking is bad-- speeding is bad.
dialog: Divorce is bad. Deaths in the

dialog: John smiles--
speaker_heading: JOHN (cont'd)
dialog: It's nice to see all that crap's

scene_heading: INTERCUT BETWEEN ALL THREE:
text: Cat-and-mouse through the maze, one step at a time-- guns out

dialog: and fires--
text: -- hitting bare walls-- nothing there-- just the neon-light
dialog: dying out--
text: Bodie-- actually scared-- it’s almost pitch-black--he moves
text: away, along the other wall-- as:
text: John and Jamie are on opposite sides of the same thin wall--
dialog: moving along it-- neither knows the other is there--
text: John steps on a sheared-out sheet of glass-- it cracks,
text: loudly-- he freezes--
text: Jamie whips around, hearing--

text: John sees Jamie’s shadow-- as Jamie raises his shotgun to the
dialog: wall--

dialog: In blinding-quick succession:
text: Billy raises his gun to fire--
text: John-- snaps his gun up, shoots Billy's fingers off-- and
text: half his hand-- Billy, spun by the blast, searing pain, goes
text: down temporarily-- a muffled scream lets out of him, half-
dialog: gone hand shaking--
text: John-- steps closer-- raises his gun, aims at Billy, ready to
dialog: shoot, as:
text: From behind, John gets shot in the neck--

text: a_ shot into Billy’s chest--
text: John and Billy collapse-- silence-- nothing moves--
dialog:

text: Billy-- twitches-- summons up all his strength-- manages to
text: get to his feet, stumble toward John--
text: Billy-- stumbling at John-- barely able to raise and keep his
text: gun straight-- but he aims it at John----
text: John-- gets to his feet-- tries to raise his gun, but-- he’s

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Billy's gun clicks-- empty-- he falters-- Billy-- bleeding

dialog: crawl at John, to hurt him any way he can--
text: John-- staggers back, a couple of steps--
text: John grabs a piece of splintered bannister-- he staggers
text: close to Billy, standing over him--
text: He raises it-- breathing-- almost-dead-- Billy looks up at
dialog: him-- John breathes--
