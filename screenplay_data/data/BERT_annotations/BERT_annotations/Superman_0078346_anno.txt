speaker_heading: THE FOUR GREAT VILLAINS:
text: Three of these creatures are men: the fourth is a woman. She is tall and has a magnificent body which is shown to its best advantage in a Krypton outfit that reveals more than it conceals: high boots, a clinging body suit, and all shiny black. Long raven hair frames a strikingly beautiful face; her eyes are almost fiery in their grace. A woman whose beauty makes strong men weak, she is consumed by total hatred of the male sex. This is URSA.
text: One of the men, who struts and swaggers like the leader, is got up in a Kryptonian version of ultra-military attire - Jackboots, high collar, uniform. All this, however, is belied by his pasty-faced, even sickly appearance. A pathological dictator, as super-Fascist whose only quality is utter contempt for everyone but himself, whose only goal is to command a world of inferiors. This is GENERAL ZOD.
text: The second man is a thin, wiry character whose face seems to be permanently contorted into a twisted, mocking grin. There is something seedy and second-rate about his appearance, even as his clothing is flashier, gaudier and, finally, more vulgar than the others. A psychopathic jokester, whose pranks and "practical jokes" are only funny to him when they cause death and suffering to others, this is JAK-EL.
text: The fourth member of the band is only a man to the extent that he is not an animal. A monstrous brute, his ugly face twists with violence. He does not speak but instead utters horrible animal-like growls and howls. Almost pure if, bent only on mindless destruction, he is a force of frightening evil. This is NON.

text: A site that instantly creates the biggest contrast with the mysterious beauty of outer space that we have just seen: a city garbage dump, dotted with reeking mounds of refuse and grey smoking bonfires. For it is here, in a place as close to deserted as can be found near the great city of Metropolis, that Superman can land unobserved. CLOSER ON HIM - FULL LENGTH: He lands, looking just a bit bushed from his recent ordeal.

speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (kidding)
dialog: How much does he pay you for
dialog: all the P.R. stuff you write?
text: The mood between them, though light and chipper, is complicated. Lois is more "up" than Clark, who seems to have a barely disguised, case of unrequited love. Odd, but true: the more he does to make her head spin as Superman, the less she appreciates good old Clark Kent.

dialog: CLARK Yes.
dialog: LOIS

dialog: CUT TO
speaker_heading: 293EXT. DELEGATION SKYSCRAPER - DAY
text: WIDE LONG SHOT: The main entrance of a tall, flat-roofed modern office building is cordoned off and guarded by a great many heavily armed policemen. Police wagons and vans and squad cars are parked all around, as well as mobile TV units. A general buzz of heightened activity: walkie-talkies going, the area swarming with reporters and photographers, the crowds pushed back behind barricades. In b. g. a taxi pulls up; Clark and Lois jump out and run to join the crowd of reporters.

text: CLOSER on the reporters who surge forward against the cordon, as a harried, tense POLICE SPOKESMAN emerges from the building.
speaker_heading: ON SPOKESMAN
dialog: SPOKESMAN Awright, here's the situation . Three terrorists have occupied the twenty-fifth floor. We don't know who they are -- they claim it's the Freedom Guerilla Army. We're checking that out. They've got hostages -- at least nine -- in an office up there. They say they're going to kill one every hour until their demands are met.
dialog: A REPORTER What demands ?
dialog: SPOKESMAN At this point in time, we don't know that information. We established communication but we still don't know what the fu . . . what they want.

dialog: COP Hey, lady!
text: Lois leaps into the elevator. The Cop races the distance towards it. Just as he gets there, the doors shut. The next elevator door then opens (as if they are programmed to work in sequence) and the Policeman gets in. FAST CUT TO
scene_heading: 295INT. FRONT DOOR - LOBBY - DELEGATION BUILDING - DAY
dialog: Clark Kent comes tearing in, runs to the elevators.

speaker_heading: 298INT. DELEGATION OFFICE CORRIDOR - 25TH FLOOR - DAY
text: We are ON a glass-walled office in which a drama of our time is being played out. Three TERRORISTS hold guns on nine hostages, one of whom is an almost hysterical woman pleading with the Terrorist who guards her. The image, in silence, is really frightening.
text: PULL BACK TO SEE that the corridor leading to the office is lined with police snipers in full regalia -- ammunition belts, battle vests, gas masks, rifles -- crouched in other office doorways.
text: In the delegation office, the Head Terrorist raises his wrist, indicating his watch, then begins waving his gun wildly at the hostages, yelling. As the hysterical woman begins to cry, we HEAR the POLICE COMMANDER O.S. at the very end of the corridor:
dialog: POLICE COMMANDER (0. S .) And one!
dialog: The police snipers raise their guns in unison.
dialog: POLICE COMMANDER (0. S .) And two!
dialog: The rifles are aimed at the office door.
speaker_heading: POLICE COMMANDER (O.S.) Fire!
text: The GUNS ARE FIRED in unison, hurtling tear gas canisters towards the office. The GLASS DOORS SHATTER and smoke instantly fills the office and begins to pour down the corridor, as Terrorists and hostages scramble wildly out and down the corridor TOWARD CAMERA. Three Men burst out of the tear-gas cloud first.
text: At this moment the elevator door opens and out steps Lois. The Men are virtually upon her and she seizes the opportunity to ask the nearest one:

text: AERIAL VIEW: The broad flat roof of the building, a fire station exit door at either end. A police helicopter hovers above as Clark and Lois emerge from one of the doors and are pushed by the Terrorists to the very edge of the roof. As this happens the chopper swings lower and a LOUDSPEAKER VOICE emanates from it:

text: On the word "change" his elbows come up hard, smashing one Terrorist on each side. smashing them simultaneously right in the chops and sending them flying. In that instant, he leaps into the broom closet, slams the door behind him. The Terrorists are quickly on their feet again, guns drawn. They FIRE through the broom closet door, RIDDLlNG it with BULLETS .

dialog: He makes a quick move towards the Terrorist. But --
dialog: TERRORIST LEADER Uh-uh. She is.
text: And so saying, he hurls Lois off the edge and into space. Lois, briefly glimpsed, screams in shock and horror as she falls. But to the amazement of the Terrorist (and the audience) Superman is not distracted; he keeps right on coming and decks the Terrorist with one terrific punch, knocking him cold on the roof!

text: ON LOIS -- still falling, shrieking now, the ground coming up fast. At the last moment, Superman swoops INTO FRAME, catching her in his arms as her last scream turns into a moan of relief. She buries her face against his chest. He smoothes her skirt down and deposits her gently on the pavement:. Then be takes off immediately.

text: CAMERA IS ON THE CRANE, WHICH NOW BEGINS TO PULL BACK AND UP, WIDENING AND PANNING OVER the prison yard of a large penitentiary. From the opening Uncle Tom image, this looks like every prison movie ever made: PAN REVEALS the prison-garbed CONS in classic situations -- one group playing ball, another group huddled around a card game, a third group sunning themselves, etc. Various entrances into the prison proper have signs over the doors reading "Print Shop," "Laundry," "Machine Shop," and so on.
text: As the song reaches its corny but stirring chorus, PAN CONTINUES to a dark, shadowed corner of the yard where TWO CONVICTS are deep in conversation, having deliberately isolated themselves from the rest of the prison population.
text: CRANE DESCENDS on these two, and we SEE that they are Lex Luthor and his assistant/architect/toady Albert. As song ends, we are into TIGHT TWO SHOT, FAVORING LUTHOR.

dialog: ALBERT (ever helpful) I know.
dialog: LUTHOR What could you know? You've got a twenty- year sentence. A sissy sentence,
dialog: ALBERT But I'll be an old man!
dialog: LUTHOR You've always been an old man, Albert. A fine architect, but not, not I say -- (God, how this grates him) -- the greatest mind of our time -- of all time! And how does the world choose it's one true genius? Do they give me treasure?
dialog: ALBERT No.
dialog: LUTHOR Who asked you? (continuing his tirade) Do they give me glory? What, in fact, do they give me?

speaker_heading: CONTINUED 308CONTINUED (2)
dialog: LUTHOR 'Would' have. Would have, Albert. As it turned out, thanks to the caped Concorde, not one drop of blood was shed.
text: This seems to disappoint him a bit. As he turns away, miffed, somebody comes running from the cellblock door towards them.
dialog: OTIS I just heard on the radio! Superman nabbed a buncha radical freaks on some roof or somethin'!
dialog: LUTHOR (galled) That crummy flag waver. He'll do anything to get a hand! (intensely) All I want out of life is to get out of here and destroy that miserable, glad-handing showboat.
dialog: ALBERT But how can you destroy him? You've tried everything. Nothing stops him. LUTHOR (slyly) Every man has a vulnerable point. I just didn't find his in time.
dialog: ALBERT (excited) And. now you've found it?
dialog: LUTHOR (nastily) What are you going to say, Albert? 'A little late, isn't it? ' 'Some timing, boss?' (lowers voice) It Just so happens that it takes time, patience and skill -- the Big 3 -- to build my black box.

dialog: LUTHOR (to Otis) Get me a fresh supply of tissue, Otis. I've used up my week's ration.
dialog: OTIS I gotta have somthin' to trade.
dialog: LUTHOR Give them Albert's radio.
text: Albert looks very unhappy. LUTHOR (back to business) So. All attempts to track Superman with conventional means have failed including radar, correct? Correct. He files at super-speed. (confidentially) And yet we know that every so often, when he isn't all tied up with -- (he says this like an insult) -- 'doing good' and taking bows and kissing babies -- (angrily) -- and posing for 'Newsweek' covers -- he goes North. North . Where ? We don't know. The tracking device always loses him. (ruminating) Now why would he go North?

dialog: LUTHOR (putting him on, razzing) How shocking!

Non and Zod take no notice of him; when he is held out politely to Ursa, she instinctively turns away with a grimace of disgust; Jak-El makes a face he thinks will amuse a baby but just makes him cry.

As for the way I live -- (a wave around the room) -- I suppose it's simple. It is good enough for me. But you're quite right.

dialog: LUTHOR (offended) Lex Luthor! Lex Luthor! What am I ? Chopped liver?
dialog: JOR-EL (sadly). And so, because of them, I created the Phantom Zone. We had, of course, no death penalty --
dialog: LUTHOR First good thing you've said, high-pockets.
dialog: JOR-EL -- and our one prison could not hold them. The solution, as I studied the problem, was a mathematical equation which I developed and presented to the Council of Elders. The Phantom Zone was constructed in space from this unbreakable, irreversible equation. In it the four were imprisoned. A terrible solution, yes, a cruel solution, but one we were forced to make, Kal-El. There is no mathematical equation that can free them.

dialog: LUTHOR (pleased) Hey! I asked the right question!

dialog: Clark looks in the direction of the parking lot.
dialog: CLARK Well, we passed a hot dog place back there. Will that do?
dialog: LOIS Around here that's a gourmet treat. I don't know how you felt about Cupid's Special Aphrodisiac French Toast Smothered in Venus and Adonis Syrup and St. Valentine's Heart-Melting Oleomargarine, but I passed.
dialog: CLARK (with a grin) Two hot dogs, comin' up.
dialog: He turns and goes.

speaker_heading: TWO SHOT -- MOTHER AND FREDDY
dialog: MOTHER (a hiss to Freddy) Freddy, didn't I tell you never to talk to strange men?

She is unwilling to alert Mama, who will only wallop him again, but very nervous about the show she is getting. A high kick or two and a quick smile, and then Freddy's hand slips. As his grin changes to terror and he plummets down the Falls, we HEAR O.S. the Mother's piercing scream, terrified. He tumbles, arms splayed out, clutching at air, and now there are other SCREAMS, pandemonium above, O.S. FOLLOW the fall.

WIDE SHOT of this desolate patch of land, which is really just a large rock outcropping scattered with small pebbles. ANGLE DOWN as suddenly, a booted foot comes INTO FRAME, kicking at a pebble. PAN UP: It is Ursa, looking very discontent.
dialog: URSA Let's get out of here.
text: WIDE SHOT -- The four in this barren region, against an empty sky. Zod sits on a boulder, taking a soldier's rest. Non stands in place, twisting slightly, Psychotically, making small restless noises. Jak-El and Ursa pace aimlessly, kicking rocks.
dialog: JAK-EL She's right. This planet is not a lot of laughs.
dialog: URSA No me. Nothing to . . . play with.
dialog: Non's Neanderthal growling is getting louder and more disquiet.
dialog: JAK-EL Even he's getting bored.
dialog: He kicks at something that makes a different Sound than a rock. He bends, picks it up.
dialog: ON IT: An empty Foster's beer can. But this means nothing to them -- it might be another kind of rock. He tosses it away.
dialog: JAK-EL Funny kind of rock.
dialog: CONTINUED

text: FOLLOW THE BEER CAN: It rolls to the edge of what we now realize for the first time is a plateau. As it drops off the cliff, WIDEN AND PULL BACK TO REVEAL the setting and an equally uninviting valley below.
dialog: ON THE FOUR:
dialog: ZOD Enough! There is nothing here for us. This planet is not capable of supporting life forms.
text: The others rise as well and move in a line to the edge of the rocky plateau, ready to fly off. But as they, so to speak, begin to rev up their motors, a kangaroo comes hopping across their line of vision in f. g., about fifty feet in front of them. With a happy roar, Non bounds toward it and decks it with one blow. As he lets out a triumphant howl:
dialog: URSA Nice for him. What do I do?
dialog: ZOD (sharply; suddenly) Quiet! Listen!
dialog: SOUND: The distant SOUND of a CAR MOTOR and an automobile HORN.
text: As they cock their ears in their discovery of Super-Hearing, BEGIN TO ZOOM PAST them TO mountain in b.g. where we can just MAKE OUT a shimmering automobile shape, moving along steadily.
dialog: CUT TO
speaker_heading: 400INT. POLICE CAR - DAY
dialog: (NOTE: From here on, actors proficient in Australian regional dialect should feel free to alter the dialogue a bit. But not much.)
text: Seated in the front seat of the car are TWO TERRITORIAL POLICE, men in their 30's and in local cop uniform. They are BILLY and BARRY.
dialog: BILLY (talking on hand mike to radio contact) Did they bring them two Aborigines in yet?

dialog: The RADIO VOICE is that of radio operator MAY.
dialog: MAY (RADIO VOICE) Drunk as a pair of wall-eyed wallabies. And Joe Harris says says he ain't gonna waste good gasoline towin' in what's left of that pick-up truck of theirs.
dialog: BILLY Well, it only gets this bad once a year, May.
dialog: MAY (RADIO VOICE) (griping good naturedly) Whoever said Wamago had to have the territorial sheep-shearing contest every year ought to be shot.
dialog: BARRY (mischievously) Why, May, wasn't it your grandpa thought that up?
dialog: MAY (RADIO VOICE) (after a pause) So it was. . . and he was shot, come to think of it.
speaker_heading: BILLY (chuckling) lO-4.
dialog: Clicks off, hangs up mike.
dialog: BARRY Don't see why the Territorial Patrol can't see fit to send us extra help for this thing. How do they expect two lone peace officers to handle that bunch of beer- soaked sheep herders?
dialog: BILLY Well, if it gets hairy like last year, we'll Just give a holler and they'll send a few troopers in to help.
dialog: CONTINUED
dialog: 400CONTINUED BARRY Help drink up the beer, you mean. I swear, Billy, why is it 364 days a year you never see mor'n ten new faces in Wamago and come the Sheep Shearin' Tournament, every weirdo that can chop wool comes out from under a rock or somethin'.
dialog: MAY (RADIO VOIC~) Billy? Your wife called in. Wants to know should she hold your dinner.
dialog: BILLY (taking mike up) Tell her that's more'n I been able to do since I married her.
dialog: The two men laugh.
dialog: MAY She'll be glad of that.

dialog: Suddenly his eyes widen in astonishment at what he sees through windshield.
dialog: BARRY Holy!
text: 401POV: On the horizon, coming down the road, the Four Villains. They look truly bizarre as always, in their outfits with the additions of astronaut accoutrements, not to mention Ursa's mask and Jak-El's boots, etc.
dialog: 402ON THE COPS
dialog: BILLY Some out-of-town entries, looks like. Good Lord, they're wores'n hippies! This is a wool-gatherin' not a costume ball.

dialog: Non, fascinated by the whirling red dome light, comes closer, to examine it.
dialog: BARRY Jesus! How long's he been in the Outback? Since the Stone Age?
dialog: CONTINUED
speaker_heading: 407CONTINUED
text: Non stares wonderingly, bemused at the light. Suddenly, with an animal-like gesture, he reaches for it and wenches it off the roof. He stares at it, making odd noises, and then, as if it were the natural thing to do, puts it on his head like a crown. Billy gets out of the car, pissed- off.
dialog: BILLY What the hell do you think you're doin'! You can't --
dialog: Non growls ominously at him. Billy shrinks back.
dialog: BILLY (clearly unsettled) I'm callin' for help, Barry.
text: He starts to get back in the car, but General Zod stops him, grabbing him by his shirt front.
dialog: ZOD (interested in Billy's badge) What is this symbol? Do you follow another leader?
dialog: With that, he yanks off the police badge, pins it on himself.
dialog: BARRY (going for his gun) Okay, buddy, you all Just bought yourselves sixty days in the --
dialog: As both cops pull out their guns:
dialog: ZOD A weapon of some sort?
dialog: BILLY (brave, but shaking) This gun has your name on it!
text: 408FAVORING JAK-EL: SPECIAL EFFECTS. He turns on his HEAT-VISION. The ray melts the two gun barrels like so much rubber.
dialog: 409As the cops stare incredulously at the gun in their hands:
dialog: JAK-EL Slowest shot in the west.
dialog: ON THE COPS -- Amazed and frightened out of their wits.
dialog: BARRY God! ZOD (correcting him) Zod.
dialog: BILLY (anxious to get away) Now look, boys -- and, uh, ma'am. . . we're not lookin' to make trouble. . . I know how it is when you've had a few too many (stares uncomprehendingly) -- how in hell did he do that??
dialog: Jak-El, with elaborate charm and niceness, opens the car door.
dialog: JAK-EL Don't let us detain you, sirs. We just wanted. to make your acquaintance. New in town and all that. You can go now.
dialog: BARRY But --
dialog: BILLY Don't argue. Barry, let's just get outta here.
text: They get in their car. Jak-El, with a bow, shuts the door. As the others stand watching, Billy starts the motor. Jak-El leans in the front window, seeming to be interested. IN CLOSE.
dialog: JAK-EL Very primitive. How does it work?
dialog: BILLY . . . Internal combustion. . . sir.
dialog: JAK-EL (brightening) Ah! Internal combustion!
text: And with that he lifts one side of the car off the ground and heaves it. 410LONG SHOT. The car goes off the cliff on the side of the road, tumbling over and over, smashing against outcrops of rock, finally stopping in a smashed heap at the bottom, upside down. A moment later it EXPLODES in a roar of fire.
dialog: JAK-EL (O.S.) He must have meant external combustion!
scene_heading: 411EXT. MAIN STREET - AUSTRALIAN VILLAGE - DAY
text: On a crudely-lettered, hand-painted sign: "WELCOME TO WAMAGO." PULL BACK TO REVEAL that this is a banner hung over a doorway. AS PULL BACK CONTINUES a man comes racing through the doorway, half-flung, and lands in the dirt road before it. Now a WOMAN strides through the doorway, her large hands on her large hips.
dialog: WOMAN (shouting) And stay out!
text: But, a good.-natured sort, she shakes her head, laughing as the man runs off.
dialog: WOMAN Shame on you. Harry Hargitay!
text: CONTINUE SLOW PULL BACK, WIDENING TO REVEAL that she stands in the doorway of Tim's Saloon. Aproned, blowsy, big and blonde, she is the barmaid who takes no nonsense from the local toughs. Her strength and womanliness serve a double purpose: she is the local midwife. This is RITA.
text: CONTINUE PULL BACK until the entire "MAIN STREET" is REVEALED. Tim's Saloon, an old general store, a little garage-machine repair shop and a tiny post office with a tall radio aerial on its roof all front on the dusty square of this remote outpost. Another banner is stretched over the post office: "WAMAGO ANNUAL SHEEP-SHEERING FESTIVAL."
text: A much larger crowd mills around than is usual in this town, i.e. about 50 folks now, by tonight's contest there might be 75. Among them, sheep-shearers, the great sharp shears hanging from their belts, cans of beer in every hand; herders, wives, kids, and one sad-faced. aborigine pushing a large broom to sweep away the accumulating debris, as well as an ice vendor and an elderly couple dressed for a really great event (of about 25 years ago), strolling the square in the shade of her parasol.
text: ON RITA, MOVING with her as she passes the store, waving to a lady examining a bolt of cloth in the sunlight, and crosses to Johnny Greer's Auto And Machine Repairs -- a ramshackle garage with one gas pump in front. Most of 35 year old. JOHNNY GREER is under an old car; his l5 year old son, WILLIE, is passing him a wrench. Rita stops. MOVE IN.
dialog: CONTINUED
speaker_heading: 411CONTINUED
dialog: RITA Is that Johnny Greer on the other end of those legs? He slides out - grease begrimed, smiling up at Rita.
dialog: JOHNNY Rita, me girl, there is nothin' as excitin' to me as the underside of a low slung chassis.
dialog: RITA (bawdy flirting) It's the car you're speakin of, I presume?
dialog: JOHNNY (with a quick look at his son; sotto voce) Not around the boy, wouldya?
dialog: With a wink, he slides back under.
text: FOLLOWlNG as she moves on across the square with easy familiarity, calling out greetings to all and sundry. But her smile vanishes as she sees something.
text: HER POV: A cluster of 3 or 5 sheep-shearers and herders, rough and mean-looking. The largest and meanest of the lot, a bully named ALFIE, swigs down beer as Rita, O.S., mutters to herself: RITA (O.S.) (worried) Alfie's here.
text: As she speaks, Alfie crushes the beer can in one fist, and drops it in the dirt just to the right of the aborigine who is passing, pushing his broom.
dialog: RITA (O.S.) . . . startin' earlier than usual. . .
text: The aborigine, doggedly following his regular path, misses the beer can. Alfie shoves him violently, knocking him to the ground.
dialog: RITA (O.S.) . . . and meaner than usual.
dialog: CONTINUED
speaker_heading: 411CONTINUED (2)
dialog: As the aborigine gets up and scuttles off, Alfie roaring with laughter, there comes an O.S. call:
dialog: PREGNANT WOMAN (O. S.) Hope I don't need you today, Rita.
dialog: PAN TO a YOUNG PREGNANT WOMAN waving at Rita.
dialog: ON RITA -- grinning back.
dialog: RITA Like I told all my ladies -- today I'm not deliverin', only pourin'.
text: Cheery again, Rita crosses to the clapboard post office. A formidable black Harley-Davison motorcycle is parked in front. She opens a screen door and enters, calling:

Seated before it, headphones on her gray head, is MAY -- the sharp-tongued old lady heard earlier who now spins around as Rita's booming Voice penetrates. She removes headphones.
dialog: MAY Damnit, Rita, you scared me to death!
dialog: RITA Yeah, well I had me a scare too. Alfie's back in town. You radio Officer Billy and tell him not to take his time gettin' here.

speaker_heading: 413INT. TIM'S SALOON - DAY
text: Dark and crowded and hardly elegant. Even before noon the action is in full swing on the big day. Rita enters in b.g. and takes her place behind the bar to help Tim who is frantically serving.
text: Some sheep-herders are singing, banging mugs. At the bar , one drunk is unaccountably and terrifyingly cutting another's hair with his shears while two others double up with laughter. At the largest table, in the center, the main activity is arm wrestling. Burly Alfie, his sleeve rolled up to display a massive arm, is taking on all comers. We SEE him easily best a large tablemate, then chug-a-lug another beer down.
text: None of which accounts for the look on the loser's face as we DOLLY IN TO CLOSEUP. His jaw drops as he stares at the door.
dialog: MAN Gor Blimey! Hey, Alfie!
dialog: Alfie turns too:
dialog: WHAT THEY SEE: General Zod, Non, Jak-El, and Ursa have just entered.

dialog: As all laugh, Alfie wiggles his fingers provocatively at Non.
dialog: ALFIE Wanna play, Cheetah?
text: Non charges forward, but suddenly, before he can get there, Ursa is there, sitting across from Alfie, elbow on the table, hand open, ready to arm wrestle. With a snort and a laugh, Alfie takes her hand. The fists clench together. Instantly she flicks his arm down. As she does so, there is a horrible SOUND of SOMETHING SNAPPING.

dialog: He stumbles out into the square, moaning with pain.

dialog: JOR-EL Then you recall what was said by one of the greatest writers of your planet; 'And this above all, to think own self be true. And it shall follow as night the day-'
text: As he is saying these last lines, Superman rises abruptly and turns away from his father. He is now facing Lois/balcony but he doesn't look up. Staring straight ahead in despair he finishes the line.
dialog: SUPERMAN '...thou can't not then be false to any man...'
dialog: JOR-EL (quietly) I leave you with that thought, my son.
dialog: A CLICK and he disappears.
text: 440TWO SHOT: A beat of silence as Superman stands still, looking at nothing. Unbeknownst, on the balcony above, Lois is in the same position, staring out unhappily over his head. She begins to speak quietly, almost to herself.
dialog: LOIS Funny, isn't it? Here I am --

dialog: NEW ANGLE, LONG: Reminding us of a very famous balcony scene in the positions.
dialog: SUPERMAN (looking up, startled) Lois!
dialog: LOIS Superman. (she leans on the balcony, bitterly ironic) Wherefore art thou, Superman? Deny thy father. . . (a sad smile) No, maybe father knows best. That was your father. . . ?
dialog: SUPERMAN (awkwardly) Yes, well, he was just -- We talk. I mean, we can communicate through. . . crystals. (he gestures to wall with first shelf of memory crystals ) Everything I know is in there. (gestures at wall with second shelf of unplayed crystals) What I still don't know is there.
dialog: LOIS You haven't listened to those?
dialog: SUPERMAN Not yet. I haven't needed to know what they tell.
dialog: LOIS (bitterly) Maybe they've got some advice for the lovelorn. For instance, Lois Lane, the girl who always got what she goes after. Ever since I was a little girl. You name it: straight A's, editor of the school yearbook, a Job on a newspaper, bylines, top salary. Once I set my sights on something. . . Well, I guess I set my sights too high this time.

dialog: REVERSE: He is there, beside her.
dialog: SUPERMAN (reaching out) Lois --
dialog: TWO SHOT: She pulls away, trying to control herself, moving swiftly down the corridor, saying:
dialog: LOIS I'm okay, I'll be okay.
text: She is stopped at the end of the corridor by large glass doors leading onto the exterior balcony. As he approaches, she turns suddenly to face him. Behind the star-crossed lovers is the starry arctic sky; the icy landscape gleams in moonlight.
dialog: LOIS (bravely) But I did do it, didn't I? I did get the man I love to love me?
dialog: SUPERMAN (this is very hard on him) Yes.
dialog: CONTINUED
speaker_heading: 440CONTINUED (3)
text: LOIS That's what's funny. I got everything I ever wanted. I even got the one thing nobody else could have. (bitterly) And now I can't have it. Because everybody else needs it. I understand, oh, how I understand. I tried awfully hard not to understand, but I'm not that selfish. They need you (quickly) Not more than I do. Nobody needs you more than I do. (soberly) But I'd be buying my personal little rainbow at the cost of all those people. The ones who say, 'Help. Come. Quick. Now.' While I'd be saying, 'Stay. Be with me. Don't go. Stay home.' And pretty soon, it'd be a toss-up whether you hated me more or I hated --
dialog: ON SUPERMAN -- He finds her thoroughly admirable, especially now.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP- LOIS
text: LOIS I was going to say, 'Whether you hated me more or I hated me more.' Because that would happen sooner or later. (desperately) I'd hate myself, Superman. (getting hold of herself) No, when you get down to the bottom line, I've got to live with Lois Lane. Alone or not. And I've Got to like her. You don't know how much, right now, I want to say, 'who cares about your great. . .' mission, isn't that what he called it? But I'm not a bitch. Not that much of a -- (it overwhelms her; she begins to weep) I'll be all right. (a fake laugh) Just some schoolgirl tears. (wipes her eyes; gets herself together) Listen, I'm tired, okay? I Just want to go somewhere and -- and lay down.

text: Superman is terribly touched and upset by her love for him and her sacrifice. Slowly he moves a few feet down the corridor and opens the bedroom door she emerged from earlier.
dialog: SUPERMAN (awkward) Here. The. . . bedroom.
dialog: LOIS (trying a smile) I know. I've been thinking about it all day. (as she approaches) But not like this. (at the door; next to him, a deep breath) Well. . .
dialog: TIGHT TWO SHOT: Suddenly he moves to take her in his arms.

dialog: 443CLOSEUP - SUPERMAN -- he can't take it anymore.
dialog: SUPERMAN I love her. I don't want to lose her. Suddenly, with the look of a man who has just made up his mind, he turns and rushes down the corridor.
dialog: SUPERMAN I won't lose her!
dialog: With a look of determination and purpose, Superman strides to the molecular restructuring chamber and enters it.
dialog: CUT TO
scene_heading: 444CUT TO INT. MOLECULAR RESTRUCTURING CHAMBER - NIGHT
text: The heavy door automatically closes. Superman goes to the crystal panel-bank and passes his hand across certain crystals (or pushes a button, or whatever the activating technique is) and then lays himself down on the transparent, forbidding slab. He closes his eyes.
text: EFFECTS: The very specific light changes begin, employing certain key colors, laser effects. Moving spotlights in a recognisable order and pattern -- all of it quite spectacular -- denoting the machine working. As the process continues:

text: WIDE: All hell has broken loose. The General Store has been demolished, felled. A number of bodies are strewn about. The town banner hangs limply torn. Three or four escaped sheep roam through the devastation. A lot has happened since we've been away. One small knot of sheepherders -- diehards, resistance fighters -- is in the surreptitious huddle. Non stands by what is left of the General Store: Jak-El is now in front of Johnny Greer' s garage by the gas pump; Ursa stands with General Zod, who, as we JOIN them, is in the middle of another speech.
dialog: ZOD (menacingly persuasive) . . . and so you see, we will have your . . . cooperation. . .

text: ON THE SHEEP-SHEARER HUDDLE: As they guardedly unchain their shear's from their belts. TRACK QUICKLY with the four as they make a rush at Jak-El, shears raised. They all fall on him, stabbing wildly.
dialog: INSERT: The shears' blades break and snap off against Jak-E.
text: WIDER: The assassins fall back, astonished, Jak-El grabs the handle of the gas pump, presses the trigger: gas gushes out as he turns toward Zod, with a wide grin.
dialog: JAK-EL Hey! Did you catch that? They think they're hot stuff!
text: 446And he blows on the gas gushing out of the hose. EFFECTS: HEAT-VISION causes a blowtorch effect, The shooting flames ignite the four sheep-herders; who flame up like tinder. Even as they do, the gushing gas spreads the fire and ignites Greer's Garage.
text: 447ON THE POST OFFICE: May rushes out, dressed in jodphurs, furious, uncowed, brandishing a fist at General Zod.
dialog: MAY Hooligans! Break my radio, will ya!
dialog: She leaps on the motorcycle; steps down, gunning it.
dialog: MAY I'll get someone to fix your wagon!
text: And she zooms off from the standing start, an old lady daredevil taking off for (in b.g.) the rise of the nearest hill. It is a comic image for a moment -- an Evel Knievel parody -- until:
dialog: ON ZOD -- watching her.
dialog: ZOD We fix the wagons around here. He nods to Non.
dialog: 448ON NON: SPECIAL EFFECTS : A COLD RAY FROM HIS EYES. THIS IS ICE- VISION.
text: ANGLE UP to May: Traveling at breakneck speed toward the top of the hill, about to make a turn as the ice vision hits. The handlebars freeze and lock; so do the pedals. A look of panic on May's face; an instant later she is hurled from the bike, spinning through the air, falling over the crest of the hill.
text: 449ON NON AND ZOD -- Zod gives his ward an appreciative nod; Non looks pleased and proud -- an evil child. Suddenly they hear something:
dialog: SOUND: the noisy, CHUGGING MOTOR of a small, ancient AIRPLANE.
dialog: 450ANGLE UP: Approaching overhead, Doc Randall's plane, with 'Flying Doctor" painted proudly on its fuselage.
text: 451ANGLE DOWN on THE CROWD: Looking up at the plane with great hope, as if seeing their savior. An audible sigh of relief.
dialog: 452ON THE PLANE, NEAR CCCKPIT: Doc Randall stares down in disbelief.
dialog: DOC (on his radio) May I Come in, May I What the bloody hell is going on? May? Where are you, May?
dialog: 453DOC'S POV - THE FOUR, below, suddenly fly up toward the plane.
text: 454NEW ANGLE: ON THE PLANE -- They arrive, placing themselves along the plane fore to aft. Together they tip the plane with a light toss. It falls, wobbling wildly just outside the square. FOLLOW its descent as it spirals down out of control, the engines now smoking from the interference. GROANS from the crowd.
dialog: JAK-EL Geronimo!
dialog: The Plane crashes, smoke spiraling, and EXPLODES.
dialog: 455ON THE SQUARE - FAVORING ZOD IN FRONT OF TERRIFIED CROWD
dialog: ZOD (ranting) No Escape! No Escape! There is no escape! Are you sufficiently convinced?
text: MEDIUM FULL -- ON A SECTION OF THE CROWD where we NOTICE a BOY about 9 years old, on the edge of the crowd in front of Tim's Saloon. Pretending to be listening to General Zod, he is in fact squirming backwards through the crush, never looking away from Zod, but slipping towards the rear all the while.
dialog: ZOD (O.S.) You will remain here! We will remain here! No one leaves Wamago alive!
text: By now, with careful backward strides, the Boy (we FOLLOW) breaks cut of the back of the crowd. He darts around the back of the saloon. 456EXT. BEHIND THE SALOON - WAMAGO - DAY
text: As Zod rants on O.S., the Boy runs to an old grazing mare tethered behind the saloon. In one jump he is on her back, loosing her rope, clinging to her neck, ready for the wild, bareback ride.
dialog: BOY (whispering prayerfully) Go! Go, Betsey!
dialog: Nothing. For one agonised second it seems as if the old horse does not even comprehend the command.
dialog: BOY (despairing) Oh, Betsey -- PLEASE!

speaker_heading: 458EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - WAMAGO, AUSTRAILIA - DAY
text: FULL SHOT: Ina filed beyond the square, the remains of two downed, wrecked Army fighter planes. REVERSE ZOOM, coming toward the square, past the bodies of dead soldiers, then past a group of tied-up, penned-in SOLDIERS, finally to one end of the square where four hanged and trussed-up bodies -- four of the toughest ranchers and herders we saw before -- are hung like carcasses.
text: CRANE SHOT BEGINS WITH A VERTICAL PAN DOWN from theses bodies which then PULLS BACK and OPENS VERY WIDE TO SHOW the village square: there is a long line of people -- the conquered, frightened survivors of the holocaust. Totally beaten and in thrall now, they look like people we used to see in those yearly ceremonies of subjects bringing booty to the Aga Khan on his birthday or conquered people laying up their store for a bandit thief. For indeed theses survivors of WAMAGO are lined up with their tithe, not gold and jewels in this case, but whatever meager possessions they could come up with: an old radio, some family heirlooms, watches, a clock, a feather boa, and of course five or six baby lambs cradled in the arms of their owners. PAN DOWN this line, SEEING these details, as well as the frightened, defeated faces. Before we reach the end of the line, however:
text: 459CUT TO THE FAR END OF THE LINE. In the center of the square, a crude, bizarre spectacle: on a makeshift "throne" made from somebody's old, battered armchair, sits General Zod. On a chair beside him, like a queen, is Ursa. Non, ever menacing, stands beside the "throne." and -- sprawled at their feet insolently smirking -- in the classic jester post (legs crossed, head resting on arm) is Jak-El. A large table is set up before them; on it, one at a time, the villagers lay their bounty down. At the head of the line is now an OLD WOMAN -- the elegant one we saw strolling with a parasol earlier -- weeping as she lays down some old rings and a pearl necklace.
dialog: OLD WOMAN It was me mother's . . . It's all I've got.
dialog: CONTINUED

dialog: JAK-EL That's all you've got? What a swell life you must have had. (as she stumbles away) Why not kill the old ones anyway? They're depressing. ZOD They have sworn their allegiance to me.
dialog: JAK-EL So what? What are they going to do if an enemy attacks -- gun them to death?
dialog: A man at the head of the line lays down a lamb.

Something very odd about this, which instantly shows us it isn't a normal situation: on the tops of the cars are suitcases, trunks, even items of furniture, bird-cages, etc., tied on. It looks like a modern-day Okie caravan. The cars are packed with families. in addition, we SEE certain yellow school busses, which have been papered with signs on the sides reading "EVACUATION TRANSPORTATION." Everywhere, POLICE in cars and on foot are evident, trying vainly to keep the traffic moving

dialog: 473INT. COSTUME SHOP - DAY
text: TIGHT ON A TV SET: sitting on a shelf next to some dusty old costume hats: sombreros, Roman Legionnaire helmets, etc. On the TV screen is a somber middle-aged man, seated at a desk bearing the Great Seal of Metropolis. This is THE MAYOR and he is in the middle of his talk.
text: MAYOR -- and we continue to wait and hope for some word from Superman before that midnight deadline. Meanwhile, as your Mayor, I can assure you that all that can be done is being done. Civil Defense units are doing a magnificent job in the stricken areas. All leaves have been cancelled in the police and fire departments. The President has declared the city a disaster area and ordered National Guard units to be posted on full alert. School buses and private cars are being used to evacuate children, the aged and the infirm. A list of the evacuation centers will appear in a moment. Meanwhile, I urge all citizens of Metropolis to stay off the streets. . .
text: As this goes on and the CRAWL APPEARS with the addresses of evacuation centers, PULL BACK TO REVEAL a very bizarre IMAGE: an old Jewish man holding a gorilla costume, crosses the little costume shop. Racks of typical outfits hang everywhere. The old man is the PROPRIETOR of the store.
dialog: PROPRIETOR Look, you got wars -- depressions -- muggings. (shrugs) So now you got mushuganahs flying in the sky. Believe me, it's always something. Hoodlums, gangsters, Muslims -- all I know is Al Felshman is alive and kicking, thank God, and people always need costumes, also thank God. You sure you don't want the gorilla? Very big this year.
text: He crosses to a curtained dressing booth and opens the curtain. In there stands Clark Kent half in an ill-fitting, somewhat baggy and faded Superman costume. As he puts his arm in the top part and zips it up:
dialog: CLARK (adjusting the Shoulders looking at himself in the mirror) No, thanks. Mr. Felshman. This is fine.

PAN WITH it as it turns down across street. In b.g. riot squad Metropolis Police are stationed at the end of the street, tense, edgy. From around the corner of' the street the truck came down, now emerges a curious sight: Clark Kent, "disguised" in raincoat, hat and glasses, but with his red Superman boots sticking out the bottom.
dialog: Trudging along oblivious to the world around him, he is muttering to himself like your average New York nut case.
dialog: CLOSER ON HIM:

text: WIDE SHOT: And now the advantage is with Clark, who advances on Luthor ready to try throwing a merely mortal punch. But Luthor immediately begins shadow-boxing, darting quick blows at Clark-Superman. Surprised, Clark-Superman can only keep ducking and feinting. Luthor stops abruptly; they are at a standoff.
dialog: LUTHOR (to Albert) Well. Albert, it looks like we won't. . . (a wildly significant look) Play ball. Y'know? (as Albert looks blank) Y'know?? The light dawns in Albert's face and he nods quickly.

On another a big department store. A hospital building down the street. The area is well lit, not only by street lights, but by big electric signs advertising various products or naming various companies, which sit on the roofs and ledges of the surrounding buildings, The Daily Planet building among them. One of these gigantic signs has been toppled, crushing about twenty people in the middle of the intersection. Many are dead. Some crawl away, hurt. Other people, a large crowd, are running in panic from the apocalypse, taking shelter in the lobby of the department store, crushing into the available space, to avoid the devastation taking place.

Non is now on the ledge of another building across the street. Zod is on his perch, right angles to Non. Completing the square is Ursa who sits on the awning of a building whose faade reads METROPOLIS CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL.
dialog: JAK-EL Come on, local boy, Make good.
dialog: URSA (taunting) Is de widdle man tired?
dialog: ZOD We noticed a pavilion in the children's hospital dedicated to you. Why don't you check yourself in with the rest of the sick and weak!
text: 529ON SUPERMAN: Looking every which way, a terrible inner struggle going on inside him. Jaw clenched, fists tight, he stands immobile.

text: A very delicate operation is in process. Albert stands none too steadily at the top or a rickety ladder hammering a metal patch on the broken water pipe, while Eve, half way up the ladder, passes him nails, and Luthor, at the foot of the ladder, steadies it. Signs of hasty repair are everywhere: buckets, towels, pans, etc. pressed into service.
text: LUTHOR If I never see any of them again, it's too soon for . . . 535Suddenly, with a mighty whoosh, the four villains descend from the hole in the ceiling, knocking down the ladder as they do, causing Albert to fall, the patch to come loose, the water to start gushing again.
dialog: LUTHOR (beside himself) Why me? Why me? Isn't there any other louse in this city who deserves grief and heartbreak? Does it always have to be. . .

text: PRESS SECRETARY (very serious) The President has asked me to read the following statement. (reading) 'These are grave and terrible events, which threaten the very existence of our planet. I have, therefore, as your Commander in Chief, placed all armed forces on emergency status. All leaves and furloughs are cancelled until further notice. There is little we can do against interplanetary forces bent on wanton destruction, however.

But no, you had to be macho man. They would've made you a deal, y'know. You could have been king of the United States maybe! At least Governor of North Dakota! But no, you had to go and make them mad. Hey listen, Superman, can you hear me? When these guys get mad it males me look like Winnie the Pooh. Now they want to kill you! What can I say?

dialog: JAK-EL Let's take it from the top.
dialog: Jak-El, leaps to the roof of the Fortress.
text: 546ON THE ROOF: As the wiry imp crawls between icicle points, looking for a means of entry, a second set of icicle-like points suddenly rises from the roof, intersecting with the first group. As these touch Jak-El (EFFECTS): Another ZAP! of electricity gooses him up and off. He falls to the ground.
dialog: 547ON THE GROUND LEVEL: They all cluster around Zod, feeling a bit foolish.
dialog: LUTHOR I don't know. . . for me the door was always open.
dialog: ZOD We have forgotten our plan. Four. We are four. It is the strength of four that will defeat our enemy.
text: He gestures to them, manipulating them into a flying wedge, pointed at the doorway.
dialog: ZOD Together! Now!
text: In a fearsome display of raw power, the four leap, fly like bullets, and hit the door simultaneously. Again there is a tremendous ZAP! of electricity, but it isn't strong enough to withstand their combined super-power. The door crashes and splits and they are inside.

dialog: LUTHOR (yelling frantically) No! Don't go in there! It's a trap! It's a trap!
dialog: NEW ANGLE: The four stop in their tracks.
dialog: QUICK CLOSEUP - SUPERMAN: looks upset. LUTHOR Don't set foot one in that thing! I know what it is! It's a molecular restructuring thing!
dialog: ZOD (snarling) A what?
dialog: LUTHOR It makes you into an earthling! It turns people like you in to. . . (feels funny saying this) . . . people like me.

dialog: ON THE FOUR: A gleam of pleasure appears in Zod's eyes.
dialog: ZOD An earthling? (savoring it) It turns a Kryptonian into an earthling?
dialog: LUTHOR (smiling) Like a man into a mouse.
dialog: URSA (almost salivating) Then a 'Super' man. . . JAK-EL . . . becomes a Super Mouse!
dialog: ZOD (a sadistic smile; his first smile of the movie) My friends. . . this amuses your General. (suddenly; frighteningly fierce) Seize him!
text: They spring at Superman and grab him -- literally limb by limb, one on each leg and arm. It is an awful spectacle, as Superman vainly kicks and struggles, his eyes contorting with fear.
dialog: SUPERMAN No! No! Please Don't!
text: His pleas are in vain. . . they hurl him into the chamber. Zod slams the door shut and seals it.
dialog: ZOD Lex Luthor! Ruler of the Cuba place! Activate this machine! Make the child of our jailer into a crawling slave so that we may destroy him as easily as. . .
dialog: ON LUTHOR: as he runs toward the chamber.
dialog: LUTHOR Say no more, General. It's my pleasure.
dialog: And he pushes the starting mechanism. Immediately:
dialog: 551WIDE: Something odd (to us, not to them) happens. The sudden spectacular changes of lights, colours, spotlights and so on that we saw earlier when Superman entered the chamber begin to happen again. . . but this time they happen in the entire interior of the Fortress, and not in the Molecular Restructuring Machine.
text: SHOTS: 1. WIDE as the lights change. 2. INSIDE THE MACHINE, Superman sits bathed in ordinary room light. 3. The colors and lights pass across the faces of the villains - red, green, blue.
dialog: But this time a new color, or set of light changes, occurs -- something we did not see the first time when the machine was lacking one important crystal.
text: At last the process ends. The lights in the Fortress return to "normal." The four, as well as Luthor, observed all the phenomenon with curiosity, but now that it seems to have ended they are grinning with anticipation, each wanting to be the one who gets the first shot.
dialog: JAK-EL Let me . . .
dialog: URSA No, I want to . . .
dialog: Non emits, a mighty howl.
dialog: ZOD (evil benevolence) Non. . . my faithful Non. . . you may do the honors.
text: FAVORING NON: Practically drooling with anticipation walks to the chamber and opens the lock. MOVE IN: SEE Superman in there. Hesitantly, he walks out the door, standing in front of Non.
text: With an idiot grin and a lunatic grunt of amusement, Non points to his chin, which he proffers, as it to say, "Go ahead, hit me." Superman stands there a moment. (Mother of Mercy, is this the end of Rico?). Now he clenches his fist. Now he raises his arm. Now Non grunts mockingly. Superman hauls back and socks.
text: 553WHAMM! The punch sends Non flying across the entire length of the entire room, crashing into the far wall, out cold.
dialog: 554QUICK REACTION SHOTS: URSA, JAK-EL, ZOD, LUTH0R. . . how could this be???
dialog: ON LUTHOR: A gibbering idiot, trying to figure it out, terrified.
dialog: LUTHOR He. . . he switched it! The old switcheroo! He was on the inside looking out, we were on the outside looking. . (blathering) The wrong place at the wrong time! It isn't fair! He turned it around! Put it in reverse! How could he do it?
text: MED, CLOSEUP - SUPERMAN: with a beaming smile, he looks skywards and makes a jaunty little salute.
dialog: SUPERMAN Thanks, Dad.
dialog: NEW ANGLE: URSA, spitting with rage, charges at him.
dialog: URSA I'll kill you! I'll destroy you!
text: As she springs at him, fingernails out, he grabs her, yanks her over and turns her over his knee.
dialog: SUPERMAN This is how we treat naughty girls on earth, Ursa.
dialog: He spanks her butt soundly. She howls.
dialog: ON ZOD: Cowering in a corner of the room; Jak-El behind him.
text: NEW ANGLE: Superman dumps Ursa on the floor, stalks towards the General. He grabs him by the lapels with one hand.
dialog: ZOD No!
dialog: SUPERMAN General Zod, consider yourself dishonorably discharged.
text: 555With his free hand, he strips the epaulets from General Zod's shoulders. Then, grabbing him with both hands, he raises him and hurls him across the room. Zod crashes into Jak-El and both wind up in a heap.
dialog: 556ON LUTHOR: on his knees.
dialog: LUTHOR (trembling) Listen, Superman, don't do anything rash. Don't be hasty. I'll be nice. I'll be your best friend. I'll change my ways.
dialog: POV: LUTHOR: ANGLE UP, Superman, advancing on him.
dialog: SUPERMAN Now then, Luthor, as for you. . .

dialog: CAMERA PULLS BACK: suddenly we SEE that we are now inside the Molecular Restructuring Chamber, but still TIGHT ON Luthor, so that it seems we are still in the Fortress.

dialog: PERRY C'mon, Kent, you're the tenth guy to do that number about the subway not running. When I started out. . . back before the wheel was invented. . . reporters knew how to walk to work. (turning to go, a word of advice) A little exercise wouldn't kill you.
text: REVERSE as they turn, and we now SEE what has been bothering Clark - beneath a great jagged hole in the ceiling stands the huge electric globe which was on the roof until Jak-El started cavorting on it. Obviously, as a final gesture, he sent it crashing down into the middle of the room. Plaster and dust are all around it and workmen with ropes and tackles are struggling to budge it.
text: PERRY (shouting to them) The world is too much with me! Will you get that thing out of here? (to Clark) A parting present from the flying freak show. (to the panting, puffing workmen) Where am I supposed to put my movie critic?! (to Clark) He said it was the best thing he's seen in years. But he thought he'd work at home. . . (raising his voice to the workmen) . . .while they take their sweet time !
