speaker_heading: GORDON (V.O)
dialog: Harvey Dent was needed. He was
dialog: everything Gotham has been crying
dialog: out for. He was...a hero. Not the
dialog: hero we deserved - the hero we
dialog: needed. Nothing less than a knight,
dialog: shining...
dialog: 
text: The sound of cracking. Splintering. A shape appears, in ice.
text: The shape of a BAT. The ice disintegrates...

scene_heading: EXT. AIRSTRIP, EASTERN EUROPE - DAY
text: An airstrip overlooking a grey city rocked by artillery

dialog: They are not my friends.
speaker_heading: DRIVER

speaker_heading: CIA MAN
dialog: Why would I want them?
speaker_heading: DRIVER

speaker_heading: CIA MAN
text: FIRST ONE TO TALK GETS TO STAY ON

text: LOT OF LOYALTY FOR A HIRED GUN!

speaker_heading: THIRD PRISONER (O.S.)

speaker_heading: CIA MAN
dialog: Wiseguy, huh? At least you can

dialog: 
speaker_heading: THIRD PRISONER
dialog: We are nothing. We are the dirt

dialog: For you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CIA MAN
speaker_heading: (UNNERVED)
dialog: Was being caught part of your plan?
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: Of course. Dr. Pavel refused our

speaker_heading: DR. PAVEL
dialog: Nothing! I said nothing!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CIA MAN
dialog: Why not just ask him?
speaker_heading: BANE

text: Dr. Pavel, strapped in, pushes against the seat in front of

scene_heading: EXT. ATLAS MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS
text: An explosion takes off the rear door of the cabin - the

dialog: 
text: Bane rips Dr. Pavel's sleeve - pulls out a length of

speaker_heading: HOODED MAN 2
dialog: Have we started the fire?
speaker_heading: BANE
speaker_heading: (NODS)
text: The fire rises.
text: Hooded Man 2 hands Bane his line. Bane clips it around Dr.

text: Pavel panics, flails. Bane takes his arms. Gentle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: Calm, Doctor. Now is not time for
dialog: fear...
text: Bane slides Dr. Pavel out of his seat. They hang in the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE
text: That comes later.

speaker_heading: MAYOR (V.O.)
dialog: But we're here tonight because it's
dialog: one of the most important...
text: ...over the Gotham river to the Palisades on the far side...
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAYOR (V.O.)
text: Harvey Dent's uncompromising stand
dialog: against organized crime and, yes,
dialog: ultimately, his sacrifice, have
dialog: made Gotham a safer place than it
dialog: was at the time of his death, eight
dialog: years ago...
text: ...finding a party in the grounds of Wayne Manor. The Mayor
text: addresses the wealthy and powerful of Gotham.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: This city has seen a historic
dialog: turnaround. No city is without
dialog: crime. But this city is without
dialog: organized crime because the Dent
dialog: Act gave law enforcement teeth in
text: its fight against the mob. Now
dialog: people are talking about repealing
dialog: the Dent Act. And to them I
dialog: say...not on my watch.
text: Enthusiastic applause as the Mayor wraps up.
dialog: I want to thank the Wayne
dialog: Foundation for hosting this event.
dialog: I'm told Mr. Wayne couldn't be here
dialog: tonight, but I'm sure he's with us
dialog: in spirit...
dialog: 
text: High above, on a darkened balcony, a lone figure. Watching.
speaker_heading: MAYOR (O.S)
dialog: Now I'm going to give way to an
dialog: important voice...
dialog: 
text: Down below at the bar, Commissioner Gordon examines some
text: sheets of densely written paper. A Congressman muscles in.
speaker_heading: CONGRESSMAN
dialog: Commissioner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Congressman.
speaker_heading: CONGRESSMAN
dialog: Ever lay eyes on Wayne at one of
dialog: these things?
text: Gordon shakes his head. Gordon's Deputy Commissioner, Foley,
dialog: cuts in.
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: No one has. Not in years.
speaker_heading: MAYOR (O.S)
dialog: He can tell you about the bad old
dialog: days, when the criminals and
dialog: corrupt ran this town with such a
dialog: tight grasp that people put their
text: faith in a murderous thug in a mask
text: and a cape. A thug who showed his
dialog: true nature when he betrayed the
dialog: trust of this great man - (Turns to
dialog: picture of Dent.) And murdered him
dialog: in cold blood.
text: The Congressman watches a tray of canapés breeze past, then
text: grabs the ass of the maid carrying them. She freezes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONGRESSMAN
dialog: Sweetheart, not so fast with the
dialog: chow.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: (turns, tight smile)
dialog: Shrimp balls?
text: The Congressman grabs two. The Maid moves off. The
text: Congressman glances down at Gordon's papers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAYOR (O.S)
dialog: Jim Gordon can tell you the truth
dialog: about Harvey Dent...
speaker_heading: CONGRESSMAN
dialog: Jesus, Gordon, is that your speech?
dialog: We're gonna be here all night.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Maybe the truth about Harvey isn't
dialog: so simple, Congressman.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAYOR (O.S)
dialog: But I'll let him tell you himself -
dialog: Commissioner Gordon?
text: Applause. Gordon approaches the mike. Looks down at his long
dialog: speech. Thinks.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: The truth...?
text: INSERT CUT: Harvey Dent, face half destroyed, threatens
text: Gordon's son with a handgun.
dialog: 10.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Gordon surveys the audience. Deciding.
dialog: I have written a speech telling the
dialog: truth about Harvey Dent...
text: Gordon folds up his speech.
dialog: Maybe the time isn't right...
text: Gordon stuffs the papers inside his jacket. The Congressman
text: mutters under his breath.
speaker_heading: CONGRESSMAN
dialog: Thank Christ for that...
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Maybe right now all you need to
dialog: know is that there are a thousand
dialog: inmates in Blackgate Prison as a
dialog: direct result of the Dent Act.
dialog: These are violent criminals,
dialog: essential cogs in the organized
dialog: crime machine that terrorized
dialog: Gotham for so long. Maybe, for now,
dialog: all I should say about Harvey
dialog: Dent's death is this...it has not
dialog: been for nothing.
text: The figure on the balcony turns back into the mansion.
text: People clap as Gordon leaves the mike. Gordon approaches
dialog: Foley.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: The second shift reports in?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: On your desk. But you should put in
dialog: some more time with the Mayor -
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: That's your department.
dialog: 
text: Gordon heads for the line of town cars in the gravel drive.
speaker_heading: CONGRESSMAN
dialog: Anyone shown him the crime stats?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
text: He goes by his gut, and it
dialog: continues to bother him, whatever
dialog: the numbers.
speaker_heading: CONGRESSMAN
dialog: Must be popular with the wife.
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Not really. She took the kids and
dialog: moved to Cleveland.
speaker_heading: CONGRESSMAN
dialog: He'll have plenty of time for
text: visits. Mayor's dumping him in the
dialog: spring.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Really? He's a hero.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONGRESSMAN
dialog: War hero. This is peacetime. Stay
dialog: smart, the job's yours.

speaker_heading: MAID 3
dialog: I heard he had an accident - that

text: The other Maids signal her to be quiet. All the chatter has
text: died. Alfred has entered the kitchen.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Mr. Till, why are your people using
dialog: the main stairs?
text: Alfred places a glass of water on a tray next to a covered

speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Where's Mrs. Bolton?
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: She's up at the bar, sir. Can I

scene_heading: INT. HALL, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Alfred talks to an elegant woman, thirties, Miranda Tate.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I'm sorry, Miss Tate, but I've
dialog: tried. He won't see you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: It's important, Mr. Pennyworth.
text: Her accent is European. Hard to place.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
text: Mr. Wayne is as determined to
dialog: ignore important things as trivial
dialog: ones.
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Don't take it personally, Miranda.
dialog: 
text: They turn to see a man in his fifties. Daggett.
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: Everyone knows Wayne's holed up in
text: there with eight-inch nails, peeing
dialog: into Mason jars. (To Alfred.) Good
dialog: of you to let me on the grounds.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: The Dent Act is about all Gotham.
dialog: Even you, Mr. Daggett. Miss Tate,
dialog: always a pleasure.
text: Alfred turns and walks off. Daggett smiles, glib.
dialog: 13.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: Why waste your time talking to the
dialog: man who threw away your investment
dialog: on some save-the-world vanity
dialog: project? He can't help you get your
dialog: money back. But I can.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I could try explaining that a
dialog: save-the-world project, vain or
dialog: not, is worth investing in,
dialog: whatever the return. I could try,
dialog: Mr. Daggett, but you understand
dialog: only money and the power you think
dialog: it buys, so why waste my time,
dialog: indeed?
dialog: 
text: She walks away. Daggett watches her go.

scene_heading: INT. DRAWING ROOM, EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS
text: Close on the dinner tray. We hear a labored step approach.
text: Bruce Wayne appears, leaning on a cane. Gaunt. Grey temples.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SITTING ROOM, EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR, CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The Maid looks at framed photographs of Rachel, Thomas and
text: Martha Wayne. Some are half-burned. She notices an archery
text: target, arrows stuck in it. She reaches out. WHAM! An arrow
text: sticks into the target - the Maid spins around, flustered.
text: Wayne, at the other end of the long room, lowers a composite
text: bow. Picks up his cane.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: I'm, I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne.
dialog: It is Mr. Wayne, isn't it?
dialog: 
text: Wayne nods, gently. Limps towards her.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: Although you don't have the long
dialog: nails... (Nervous laugh.) Or facial
dialog: scars...
text: She trails off, embarrassed. Coy. She seems very young.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Is that what they say about me?
dialog: 14.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: It's just that...nobody sees you...
dialog: 
text: Wayne approaches slowly. He nods at her pearl necklace.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: That's a beautiful necklace.
dialog: Reminds me of the one that belonged
dialog: to my mother. It can't be the same
dialog: one - her pearls are in this safe -
text: He reaches out with his cane to press open a panel on the
text: bureau, revealing a safe door...
dialog: - which the manufacturer clearly
text: explained is uncrackable.
dialog: 
text: ...which swings open with an awkward creak.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: Oops. No one told me it was
text: uncrackable.
dialog: 
text: The Maid suddenly seems more confident. Older.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I'm afraid I can't let you take
dialog: those.
dialog: 
text: She smiles at him. Moves towards him.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: Look, you wouldn't hit a woman any
dialog: more than I would beat up a
dialog: cripple.
text: She kicks his cane from under him, smashes him down.
dialog: Of course, sometimes exceptions
dialog: have to be made.
dialog: 
text: The Maid vaults onto the bureau and up to a high window.
dialog: Goodnight, Mr. Wayne.
text: She flips backwards through the window. Wayne smiles, then
text: rocks forward on his good leg and rises with athletic grace.
text: He looks at the safe, notices something. Powder...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVE, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS
text: Moving toward the line of town cars, the Maid pulls off her

speaker_heading: ALFRED

dialog: wondering.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I wasn't.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: What are you doing?

speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: ALFRED

speaker_heading: WAYNE
speaker_heading: (SHRUGS)
text: She took the pearls. Tracking

speaker_heading: ALFRED

speaker_heading: GORDON

speaker_heading: BLAKE

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: What about it?
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: The last confirmed sighting of the

speaker_heading: GORDON

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: You haven't been down here in a
dialog: long time...
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Just trying to find out more about
dialog: our jewel thief. I ran her prints
dialog: from the photos she handled -
text: Wayne pulls up a mug shot - a fat, male armed-robbery
dialog: suspect.
dialog: - but she was wearing someone
dialog: else's fingerprints. She's good.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: She may be. But we have the trace
text: on the necklace.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: We do, so I cross-referenced the
dialog: address she went back to with
dialog: police data on high-end
dialog: B-and-E's...
dialog: 
text: Wayne hits a key. A photograph of the Maid appears.
dialog: Selina Kyle. The databases are full
dialog: of close calls, tips from fences...
dialog: 19.
dialog: 
dialog: Newspaper headlines appear -
text: THE CAT STRIKES AGAIN, POLICE SUSPECT 'CAT' BURGLAR IN JEWEL
speaker_heading: HEIST.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: She's good, but the ground is
text: shrinking beneath her feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: We should send the police before
text: she fences the pearls.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: She won't. She likes them too much.
dialog: And they weren't what she was
dialog: after.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: What was she after?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: My fingerprints. There was printer
dialog: toner mixed with graphite on the
dialog: safe. Gives you a good pull, and
text: it's untraceable.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Fascinating. Maybe you should
text: exchange notes over coffee.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Now you're trying to set me up with
dialog: a jewel thief?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: At this point, sir, I would set you
dialog: up with a chimpanzee if I thought
dialog: it would bring you back into the
dialog: world.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: There's nothing out there for me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: And that's the problem. You hung up
text: the cape and cowl, but never moved
dialog: on. You won't get out there and
dialog: find a life. Find someone -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
speaker_heading: (BITTER)
dialog: I did find someone, Alfred.
dialog: 20.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I know. And then you lost them.
dialog: That's part of living, sir. But
dialog: you're not living - you're waiting.
text: Hoping for things to go bad again.
dialog: 
text: Wayne says nothing.
dialog: Remember when you left Gotham?
dialog: Before all this. Before Batman.
dialog: Seven years you were gone. Seven
dialog: years I waited. Hoping that you
dialog: wouldn't come back.
text: Wayne looks at Alfred. Not understanding.
dialog: Every year I took my holiday. I'd
dialog: go to Florence. There's a café by
dialog: the Arno... Any fine evening I
dialog: would sit there and order a Fernet
dialog: Branca...
text: INSERT CUT: Alfred seated in a café sipping his drink...
dialog: I had a fantasy. I liked to imagine
dialog: that one day I'd look across the
dialog: tables, and see you. Sitting there
dialog: with your wife. Perhaps some kids.
dialog: You wouldn't say anything to me, or
dialog: me to you, but we'd both
dialog: know...that you'd made it. That you
dialog: were happy.
dialog: 
text: INSERT CUT: Alfred spots a couple at another table and looks
text: closer, hopeful. But they are strangers.
dialog: I never wanted you to come back to
dialog: Gotham. I knew there was nothing
dialog: there for you but pain and tragedy,
dialog: and I wanted more for you than
dialog: that. I still do.

dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAKE

speaker_heading: FATHER REILLY
dialog: Jimmy hadn't been here for months.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: FATHER REILLY
dialog: You know why, Blake - he aged out.
dialog: We don't have the resources to keep
dialog: boys on after sixteen -
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: The Wayne Foundation gives money
dialog: for that -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER REILLY
dialog: Not for two years now.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: He has a brother here, right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER REILLY

text: Mark nods slowly. Staring straight ahead.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: What was he doing in the tunnels?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Lot of guys been going down the
dialog: tunnels when they age out. Say you
dialog: can live down there. Say there's
dialog: work down there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: What kind of work are you gonna
dialog: find in the sewers?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: More than you can find up here, I

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT
text: Selina Kyle, in a little black dress, walks in with a drunk
text: in a Hawaiian shirt. She sits him on a bar stool - walks
text: over to a table where a neatly dressed man, Stryver, sits.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STRYVER
dialog: You brought a date?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I like having someone around to
dialog: open doors for me.
dialog: 
text: Selina glances around. Things scattered throughout the bar.
text: Jumpy. Selina hands an envelope to Stryver.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Right hand. No partials.
text: Stryver slides a transparency out of the envelope. Holds it
text: up to the light. Four perfect fingerprint transfers.
dialog: 23.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STRYVER
dialog: Very nice.
text: He pockets the envelope.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Not so fast, handsome. You got
dialog: something for me?
speaker_heading: STRYVER
dialog: Oh, yes.
dialog: 
text: Stryver signals a Thug who locks the door. Another Thug
text: joins them at the table. Selina smiles.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I don't know what you're going to
dialog: do with Mr. Wayne's prints...but
dialog: I'm guessing you'll need his thumb.
text: As Stryver checks the envelope again -
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: You don't count so good, huh?
speaker_heading: STRYVER
dialog: I count fine.
text: The Second Thug puts a gun to Selina's head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STRYVER
dialog: In fact, I'm counting to ten right
dialog: now...
text: Selina looks in his eyes. The Thug cocks his gun. She
text: blinks.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Okay, okay -
dialog: 
text: She reaches for her purse. The Thug stops her, reaches in
text: himself - pulls out a cellphone. Slides it across the table.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: My friend is waiting outside. Just
dialog: hit 'send'...
dialog: 
text: Stryver looks at the phone. Hits 'send'. Selina sizes up her
text: options. A knock on the door. Second Thug hides his gun. The
text: door opens - a young woman, Jen. She enters, cheerful, spots
text: Selina. Pulls out an envelope, looks around.
dialog: 24.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEN
text: Place is a little dead.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: (takes envelope, tense)
dialog: It'll liven up in a minute, trust
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Everything okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Great. Catch you later.
text: Jen leaves. Stryver checks the envelope. Satisfied.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: It would've been a lot easier to
dialog: just give me what we agreed.
speaker_heading: STRYVER
dialog: We can't have loose ends. And even
dialog: in that dress, no one's going to
dialog: miss you.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: No. But my friend over there...?
text: Stryver looks at Selina's 'date' drooling into a bowl of
text: nuts at the bar - he looks familiar...
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Every cop in the city's missing
dialog: him.
dialog: 
text: Across the bar, the TV on mute -
text: MANHUNT FOR MISSING CONGRESSMAN.
text: Stryver looks at Selina.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STRYVER
dialog: Cute. But they're not gonna be
dialog: looking in a place like this.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I don't know... You did just use
text: his cell phone.
text: Stryver glances down at the cell phone as - SCREECH - the
text: Thugs look out the window at cop cars and SWAT units
text: descending on the bar. Stryver glances at the window and -
text: SMASH - Selina CRACKS his head against the table, grabs
dialog: 25.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Second Thug's gun hand, flips over the table, firing at the
text: other Thugs, who drop. The SWATs batter down the door.
text: Selina crouches, cowering, screaming.
speaker_heading: SWAT
dialog: It's alright, Miss. Just stay down
dialog: -
text: The SWATs barrel past, chasing the remaining Thugs back
text: through the bar and out into the back alley. Selina smiles.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS
text: The Thugs turn and open up on the SWATs with automatic
dialog: weapons.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DIVE BAR - CONTINUOUS
text: Selina moves to the door. Spots the Congressman under the
text: bar, clutching his bleeding leg.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Keep some pressure on that,

text: Moves for the door.

speaker_heading: CONGRESSMAN
speaker_heading: (WEAK)

scene_heading: EXT. DIVE BAR - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: There's a man in there - he's
dialog: bleeding!
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: It's okay, Miss. It's okay.
dialog: 
text: Blake helps Selina down onto the tailgate of a SWAT truck.
text: He heads into the bar, weapon drawn. Selina slips behind the
text: truck and into the night.
dialog: 26.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DIVE BAR - CONTINUOUS
text: Blake enters, gun drawn. Spots the Congressman.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
speaker_heading: (INTO RADIO)
dialog: I've got the Congressman - bullet
text: to the leg, but he's okay.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The SWATs return fire. The Thugs lay down cover fire, then
text: race around a corner into a smaller passage.
text: A cop car pulls up, blocking the mouth of the alley - Gordon
text: jumps out, gun drawn.
dialog: 
text: The SWATs approach the passage, massing on both corners
text: tactically. The two corner SWATs exchange hand signals,
text: counting down... They round the corner, aiming low and high.
text: The passage is empty.
dialog: 
text: The SWATs cover a fire escape, but Gordon spots at once -
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Manhole!
dialog: 
text: He races to the manhole cover - SWATs wrench off the cover,
text: Gordon grabs a flashlight from the nearest SWAT.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: You three, down with me. You two,
text: head down to cover the next exit -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SWAT
dialog: Where -?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Get the DWP down here, now!
dialog: 
text: Gordon starts climbing down the ladder...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SEWERS - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Gordon moves down the tunnel, flashlight low. Three SWATs
dialog: fall in behind...
dialog: 27.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS
text: Blake comes into the alley. Cops surround the manhole.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Where's the DWP guy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: They went down there?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: (shaking his head)
text: And Gordon took SWAT in after them.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SEWERS - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Gordon hears a noise up ahead - pushes forward, rounds the
text: corner. BANG! GUNFIRE. SWATs return fire, shots sparking off
text: the concrete walls, then - BOOM - behind him the tunnel
text: ERUPTS IN FIRE, blasting the SWATs. Gordon races forward,
text: tearing through the tunnels.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS
text: Blake jumps back as a fireball bursts out of the manhole.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SEWERS - CONTINUOUS

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS
text: Blake pushes forward.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Come on, we gotta get down there -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: That was a gas explosion, kid -
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Gas? This is a sewer!
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: No one goes in there till we know

dialog: 28.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: We know what's down there, sir. The
dialog: Police Commissioner!
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Somebody get the hothead out of

text: Blake backs off. Gets an idea - goes for his patrol car.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SEWERS - CONTINUOUS
text: Thug 1 flips Gordon onto his back.
speaker_heading: THUG 1
dialog: This one's alive. (Looks closer.)
dialog: Jesus. It's the Police
dialog: Commissioner.
speaker_heading: THUG 2
dialog: What do we do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THUG 1
dialog: Take him to Bane.
text: The two Thugs drag Gordon down through the maze of tunnels.
text: As they descend deeper they encounter work crews of muscular
text: men wielding large drills and jackhammers, working the walls
text: and ceiling of the larger tunnels. Some of the men are armed
text: Mercenaries, overseeing gangs of homeless street kids. They
text: stare as Gordon is dragged past. The Thugs drag Gordon
dialog: between two waterfalls, into -
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BANE'S LAIR, SEWERS - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)
text: They approach a figure, turned away, crouched in the
text: firelight. Bare-chested, muscular, masked. Bane. A crooked
text: line of scar tissue runs the length of his spine...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: Why are you here?
text: The Thugs drop Gordon at Bane's feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THUG 1
dialog: Answer him!
text: Bane slowly turns to the Thugs.
dialog: 29.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: I'm asking you.
speaker_heading: THUG 1
dialog: It's the Police Commissioner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: And you brought him down here?
speaker_heading: THUG 2
dialog: We didn't know what to do. We -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: You panicked. And your weakness
dialog: costs three lives.
speaker_heading: THUG 1
dialog: No, he's alone -
text: Bane flips the Thug's chin up and to the side with a crack.
text: Thug 1 drops. Bane turns to Thug 2.
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: Search him. Then I will kill you.
text: The Thug, terrified, pulls out Gordon's badge, wallet,
text: gun...and the folded papers of the speech he did not read.
text: Bane takes these one by one with quick glances. He stops at
text: the papers. Unfolds them...
dialog: 
text: As he reads, Gordon rolls off the steps, dropping into the
text: rushing flow of water - gunshots ring out...
speaker_heading: THUG 2
text: He's dead.
dialog: 
text: Thug 2 trails off as Bane looks up from the papers...
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: Then show me his body.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THUG 2
dialog: That water runs to any one of the
dialog: outflows - we'd never find him.
text: Bane turns to the Lead Mercenary.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: Give me your GPS.
text: Lead Mercenary hands him a GPS - Bane tucks it into Thug 2's
text: jacket, zips it up like a mother sending her kid to school.
dialog: 30.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: Follow him.
speaker_heading: THUG 2
dialog: Follow him?
dialog: 
text: Bane shoots Thug 2, kicks him into the water. Turns to Lead
dialog: Mercenary.
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: Track him. Make sure both bodies
dialog: will not be found. Then brick up
dialog: the south tunnel.

scene_heading: EXT. WATER TREATMENT FACILITY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Blake comes out to the catchment basin. He spots something

scene_heading: INT. FRONT HALL, WAYNE MANOR - DAY
text: Alfred opens the door to reveal Blake in his dirty uniform.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: I need to see Bruce Wayne.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I'm sorry, Mr. Wayne doesn't take
text: unscheduled calls. Even from police
dialog: officers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: And if I go get a warrant, in the
dialog: investigation of Harvey Dent's
dialog: murder? Would that still count as
dialog: unscheduled?
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STUDY, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Blake is sitting, drumming his leg, nervous. Wayne enters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: What can I do for you, officer?
speaker_heading: BLAKE
text: Commissioner Gordon's been shot.
dialog: 31.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I'm sorry to hear that -
speaker_heading: BLAKE
text: He chased a gunman down into the
dialog: sewers. When I pulled him out he
text: was babbling about an underground
text: army. A masked man called 'Bane'.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Shouldn't you be telling this to
dialog: your superior officers?
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: I did. One of them asked if he saw
dialog: any giant alligators down there. He
dialog: needs you. He needs the Batman.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: If Commissioner Gordon thinks I'm
dialog: the Batman he must be in a bad way
dialog: -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: He doesn't know or care who you
dialog: are. (Off look.) But we've met
dialog: before. When I was a kid. At the
dialog: orphanage. See, my mom died when I
dialog: was small. Car accident, I don't
dialog: really remember it. But a couple of
dialog: years later my dad was shot over a
dialog: gambling debt. I remember that just
dialog: fine. (Looks at Wayne.) Not a lot
dialog: of people who know what it feels
dialog: like, do they? To be angry. In your
dialog: bones. People understand, foster
text: parents understand. For a while.
dialog: Then they expect the angry kid to
dialog: do what he knows he can never do.
dialog: To move on. To forget.
dialog: 
text: Wayne stares at Blake.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: So they stopped understanding and
text: sent the angry kid to a boys' home
dialog: - St. Swithin's. Used to be funded
dialog: by the Wayne Foundation. See, I
dialog: figured it out too late. You have
dialog: to hide the anger. Practice smiling
dialog: in the mirror. Like putting on a
dialog: mask. You showed up one day in a
dialog: cool car, pretty girl on your arm.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 32.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: We were so excited - Bruce Wayne,
dialog: billionaire orphan. We made up
dialog: stories about you. Legends. The
dialog: other boys' stories were just that.
dialog: But when I saw you I knew who you
dialog: really were... (Beat.) I'd seen
dialog: that look on your face. Same one I
dialog: taught myself.
text: Blake gets up to leave. Wayne is lost in thought.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: I don't know why you took the fall
dialog: for Dent's murder, but I'm still a
dialog: believer in the Batman. Even if
dialog: you're not.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Why did you say your boys' home
dialog: used to be funded by the Wayne
dialog: Foundation?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Because the money stopped. Might be
dialog: time to get some fresh air and
dialog: start paying attention to the
dialog: details. Some of those details
dialog: might need your help.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALL, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Wayne and Alfred watch Blake drive away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: You checked that name? 'Bane' -
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Ran it through some databases. He's
dialog: a mercenary. No other known name.
dialog: Never been seen or photographed
text: without a mask. He and his men were
dialog: behind a coup in West Africa that
dialog: secured mining operations for our
dialog: friend John Daggett.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Now Daggett's brought them here?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: It would seem so. I'll keep
dialog: digging.
dialog: 33.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Alfred turns to leave.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Why did the Wayne Foundation stop
dialog: funding boys' homes in the city?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: The Foundation is funded from the
dialog: profits of Wayne Enterprises...
dialog: (Off look.) There have to be some.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Time to talk to Mr. Fox, I think.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I'll get him on the phone -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: No. Do we still have any cars
dialog: around the place?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
speaker_heading: (LIGHTS UP)
dialog: One or two.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: And I need an appointment at the
dialog: hospital. About my leg.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Which hospital, sir?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Whichever one Jim Gordon's in.

text: Miranda catches something in this.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA

speaker_heading: FOX

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
speaker_heading: (RISING)
dialog: Mr. Fox, are you aware that John
dialog: Daggett is trying to acquire shares
dialog: in Wayne Enterprises?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I was not. But it wouldn't do him
dialog: any good - Mr. Wayne still retains
text: a clear majority.
text: Miranda leaves. Fox moves into his office - stops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Bruce Wayne. As I live and breathe.
text: Wayne rises, pushing hard on his cane.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: What brings you out of cryo-sleep
dialog: Mr. Wayne?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I see you haven't lost your sense
dialog: of humor...even if you have lost
dialog: most of my money.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Actually, you did that yourself.
dialog: See, if you funnel the entire R and
dialog: D budget for five years into a
dialog: fusion project that you then
dialog: mothball, your company is unlikely
dialog: to thrive.
dialog: 35.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Even with -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOX
text: A wildly sophisticated CEO, yes.
dialog: Wayne Enterprises is running out of
text: time. And Daggett is moving in.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: What're my options?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: If you're not willing to turn your
dialog: machine on -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I can't, Lucius.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Then sit tight. Your majority keeps
dialog: Daggett at arm's length while we
dialog: figure out a future for the energy
dialog: program with Miranda Tate - she's
dialog: supported your project all the way.
dialog: She's smart, and quite lovely.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: You too, Lucius?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: We all just want what's best for
dialog: you, Bruce. Show her the machine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I'll think it over.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Anything else?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: No, why?
speaker_heading: FOX

scene_heading: INT. APPLIED SCIENCES - MOMENTS LATER
text: Fox leads Wayne into the vast, gadget-filled space. They
dialog: pass Tumblers with different weapons configurations...
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I figured you'd have shut this
dialog: place down.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: It was always shut down,
dialog: officially.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: But all this new stuff?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: After your father died, Wayne
dialog: Enterprises set up fourteen
dialog: different defense subsidiaries.
dialog: I've spent years shuttering them
dialog: and consolidating all the
dialog: prototypes under one roof. My roof.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Stop them falling into the wrong
dialog: hands. Besides, I thought someone
dialog: might get some use out of them...
text: Wayne shakes his head.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Sure I can't tempt you to
dialog: something? Pneumatic crampons?
dialog: Infrared lenses? Least let me get
dialog: you something for that leg.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: It's fine the use it gets these
dialog: days.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Well, then I have just the thing
dialog: for an eccentric billionaire who
dialog: doesn't like to walk...
text: Fox opens a door - we glimpse a sleek vehicle. Wayne's eyes
dialog: light up.
dialog: 37.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Now you're just showing off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Defense Department project for

text: Rotors configured for maneuvering
dialog: between buildings without
text: recirculation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: What's it called?
speaker_heading: FOX
text: It has a long and uninteresting
dialog: Wayne Enterprises designation. So I
dialog: took to calling it the Bat. And
dialog: yes, Mr. Wayne, it does come in
dialog: black.
text: Wayne touches its sleek side. Marveling.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Works great except for the
text: autopilot.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: What's wrong with that?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Software-based instability. Take a
dialog: better mind than mine to fix it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Better mind?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I was trying to be modest. A less
dialog: busy mind. Yours, perhaps.
text: Wayne looks wistfully at the machine. Turns away.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I told you. I retired, Lucius.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. EXAMINATION ROOM, GOTHAM GENERAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT
text: Wayne listens, distracted, while a Doctor examines an X-ray.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: I've seen worse cartilage in knees
dialog: -
dialog: 38.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: That's good -
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: No, that's because there is no
dialog: cartilage in your knee. And not
dialog: much of any use in your elbows and
dialog: shoulders. Between that and the
dialog: scar tissue on your kidneys,
dialog: residual concussive damage to your
dialog: brain tissue and general
dialog: scarred-over quality of your
dialog: body... (Takes a deep breath.) I
dialog: cannot recommend that you go
text: heli-skiing. About the only part of
dialog: your body that looks healthy is
dialog: your liver, so if you're bored I
dialog: recommend you take up drinking, Mr.
dialog: Wayne.
text: Wayne smiles. The Doctor leaves. Wayne pulls on a ski mask,
text: steps to the window, hops up, pulls a wire from his cane,
text: which he clips to his belt. He props his cane behind the
text: frame - jumps out. The wire unspools from the cane as -

text: Wayne drops three floors...

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PRIVATE ROOM, GOTHAM GENERAL - CONTINUOUS
text: Gordon lies in his bed, hooked up to machines. Wayne, in ski
text: mask, stands over him. Gordon's eyes flutter open. He tries
text: to speak with a weak, hoarse voice...
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: We were in this together. Then you
dialog: were gone...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: The Batman wasn't needed anymore.
dialog: We won.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Built on a lie. Our lie. Now
dialog: there's evil rising from where we
dialog: tried to bury it. Nobody will
dialog: listen... The Batman has to come

speaker_heading: GORDON

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SELINA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: Selina sits in a small room getting ready to go out. She
text: picks up the pearls - hears a disturbance in the hall.
speaker_heading: JEN (O.S.)
dialog: I told you - money first -
speaker_heading: YUPPIE (O.S.)
dialog: Goddammit, you took my wallet!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL OUTSIDE SELINA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: The Yuppie has Jen against the wall - he reaches back to hit
text: her with an expensive wristwatch-clad arm. But Selina has
text: grabbed his wrist with a powerful grip.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Get out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YUPPIE
dialog: She took my wallet!
text: Selina twists his arm behind him in a blinding move.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Now.
text: She releases the Yuppie, who moves off down the stairs.
text: Selina turns to Jen. Who is examining a wallet.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I told you not to try it with the
dialog: assholes, Jen.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: They're all assholes.
dialog: 40.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Okay, the assholes who hit.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: I don't know what he's so upset
dialog: about, he only had sixty bucks in
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Probably the watch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Watch?
text: Selina opens her hand and gives Jen the Yuppie's Rolex.

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SELINA'S BUILDING, OLD TOWN, GOTHAM - LATER
text: Selina exits and hails a cab. Wayne watches her go. Then
text: pulls out. Checking his tracker.

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MUSEUM, GOTHAM - LATER
text: Town cars dispense Gotham society in tasteful masquerade.
text: Wayne pulls up to the Valet. Paparazzi line the entrance.

speaker_heading: PAPARAZZI
dialog: Another stiff too old to climb out
text: of his sports car.
speaker_heading: PAPARAZZI 2
dialog: No, that's Bruce Wayne! Hey, Wayne,
dialog: where you been hiding?
text: Lenses swing onto Wayne, who pushes a button on his key fob
text: - a pulse. The cameras die. Wayne heads to the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I'm not sure if my assistant put me
dialog: on the guest list -
speaker_heading: GREETER
dialog: Right through here, Mr. Wayne...
dialog: 41.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MUSEUM - CONTINUOUS
text: A lavish ball - the expressively attired dance under falling
text: confetti... Even Bruce Wayne is struck by the ostentation.
text: He spots Selina dancing with a deeply smitten Rich Twit. She
text: wears a small, velvet pair of cat ears. And the pearls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (O.S)
dialog: Bruce Wayne at a charity ball?
text: Wayne turns to find Miranda Tate, amazed, a small mask her
dialog: only concession to fancy dress.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Miss Tate, isn't it?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Even before you became a recluse,
dialog: you never came to these things...
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: True. Proceeds go to the big fat
dialog: spread, not the cause. It's not
dialog: about charity, it's about feeding
dialog: the ego of whichever society hag
dialog: laid it on.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Actually, this is my party, Mr.
dialog: Wayne.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: And the proceeds will go where they
dialog: should, because I paid for the big
dialog: fat spread myself.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: That's very generous of you.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You have to invest to restore
dialog: balance to the world. Take our
dialog: clean-energy project...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Sometimes the investment doesn't
dialog: pay off. Sorry.
dialog: 42.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You have a practiced apathy, Mr.
dialog: Wayne. But a man who doesn't care
dialog: about the world doesn't spend half
dialog: his fortune on a plan to save it...
dialog: (Gentle.) And isn't so wounded when
dialog: it fails that he goes into
dialog: hiding...
text: Wayne looks at Miranda. Intrigued.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne.
text: Wayne watches Miranda glide away. Then turns to Selina.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Mind if I cut in?
text: Rich Twit turns, annoyed - Wayne hands him his cane. Takes
text: Selina by the waist. She glares at him.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: You don't seem very happy to see
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: You were supposed to be a shut-in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Felt like some fresh air.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Why didn't you call the police?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I have a powerful friend who deals
dialog: with this kind of thing. (Admires
text: her cat ears.) Brazen costume for a
text: cat burglar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Yeah? Who are you pretending to be?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
text: Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.
dialog: Who's your date?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: His wife's in Ibiza. She left her
text: diamonds behind, though. Worried
dialog: they'd get stolen.
dialog: 43.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: It's pronounced 'Ibeetha'. You
dialog: wouldn't want these folks realizing
dialog: you're a crook not a social
dialog: climber.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: (flash of anger)
dialog: You think I care what anyone in
dialog: this room thinks about me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I doubt you care what anyone in
dialog: this room thinks about you.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Don't condescend, Mr. Wayne. You
dialog: don't know a thing about me.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Well, Selina Kyle, I know you came
dialog: here from your walk-up in Old Town
dialog: - modest place for a master jewel
dialog: thief. Which means either you're
dialog: saving for your retirement - or
dialog: you're in deep with the wrong
dialog: people.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: You don't get to judge me because
dialog: you were born in the master bedroom
dialog: of Wayne Manor.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Actually, I was born in the Regency
dialog: Room.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I started off doing what I had to.
dialog: Once you've done what you had to
dialog: they'll never let you do what you
dialog: want to.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Start fresh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: There's no fresh start in today's
dialog: world. Any twelve-year-old with a
dialog: cell phone could find out what you
dialog: did. Everything we do is collated
text: and quantified. Everything sticks.
dialog: We are the sum of our mistakes.
dialog: 44.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Or our achievements.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: The mistakes stick better. Trust
dialog: me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: You think that justifies stealing?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I take what I need to from those
dialog: who have more than enough. I don't
dialog: stand on the shoulders of people
dialog: with less.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Robin Hood?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I'd do more to help someone than
text: most of the people in this room.
dialog: Than you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Maybe you're assuming too much.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Or maybe you're being unrealistic
dialog: about what's really in your pants
dialog: other than your wallet.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Ouch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: You think all this can last?
text: Wayne glances around at the sumptuous party.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne.
dialog: You and your friends better batten
text: down the hatches, because when it
dialog: hits you're all gonna wonder how
dialog: you ever thought you could live so
dialog: large and leave so little to the
dialog: rest of us.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Sounds like you're looking forward
dialog: to it.
dialog: 45.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I'm adaptable.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: These pearls do look better on you
dialog: then they did in my safe...
dialog: 
text: Wayne rolls her into his shoulder - reaches up to the back
text: of her neck, unclasps the necklace.
dialog: But I still can't let you keep
dialog: them.
dialog: 
text: The pearls slide off her neck into his other hand. Selina
text: looks at him. Angry. Then kisses him, hard, and disappears
text: into the crowd. Wayne's cane reappears.
speaker_heading: RICH TWIT
speaker_heading: (ANNOYED)
dialog: You scared her off.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Not likely.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MUSEUM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Wayne approaches the Valet. Pats down his pockets.
speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: VALET

speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: ALFRED

speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 46.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFRED (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't worry, Master Wayne. Takes a
dialog: little time to get back into the
dialog: swing of things.
text: Wayne dials his phone.
speaker_heading: FOX (O.S.)
dialog: This is Fox.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Remember those 'unusual requests' I
dialog: used to make?
speaker_heading: FOX (O.S.)
dialog: I knew it!
text: Up front, Alfred listens. Concerned.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BATCAVE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Wayne pushes a button on a hi-tech carbon fiber brace
text: strapped to his good knee - the brace tones. As Wayne starts
text: moving his knee, bending, stretching, Alfred puts down a
dialog: Thermos.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: You've got the wrong leg, sir.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: You start with the good limb so it
dialog: learns your optimum muscle
dialog: patterns.
text: Wayne swaps the brace to his bad knee. Puts his weight on it
text: - the knee bends, kicks. He sits again. Cautious.
dialog: Now we tighten it up.
dialog: 
text: Wayne gingerly pushes a button - the brace starts to shrink
text: tight to his leg, digging in. Wayne grits his teeth.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: It is terribly painful?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
speaker_heading: (GRITTED TEETH)
dialog: You're welcome to try it, Alfred.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Happy watching, thank you, sir.
text: Wayne shouts as the brace clicks home. He gets to his feet.
dialog: 47.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Not bad -
text: Wayne executes a perfect roundhouse, knocking out a brick.
dialog: Not bad at all.
dialog: 
text: Alfred picks up the brick. Considers it. Uneasy. He follows
text: Wayne across the bridge to the cube.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Master Wayne, if you're considering
dialog: going back out there you need to
dialog: hear some rumors surrounding Bane.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I'm all ears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFRED
text: There is a prison. In a more
text: ancient part of the world. A pit.
dialog: Where men are thrown to suffer and
dialog: die. But sometimes, a man rises
dialog: from the darkness. Sometimes...the
text: pit sends something back.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Bane.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
text: Born and raised in a hell on earth.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Born in a prison?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: No one knows why. Or how he
dialog: escaped. But they know who trained
dialog: him one he did...R¯'s al Gh¯l. Your
speaker_heading: A U
dialog: mentor.
dialog: 
text: Wayne takes this in. Shocked.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
text: He plucked Bane from a dark corner
dialog: of the earth and trained him in the
dialog: blackest disciplines of combat,
dialog: deception and endurance. Just like
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Bane was a member of the League of
dialog: Shadows.
dialog: 48.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFRED
text: Until he was excommunicated. And a
dialog: man considered too extreme for R¯'s
dialog: A
dialog: al Gh¯l is not to be trifled with.
speaker_heading: U
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I didn't realize I was known for
text: trifling with criminals.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: That was then. And you can strap up
dialog: your leg and put the mask back on.
dialog: But it won't make you what you
dialog: were.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Which was?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Someone whose anger at death made
dialog: him value all life. Even his own.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: If this man is all the things you
dialog: say he is, then this city needs me.
text: The Batsuit emerges from the cube.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Yes, this city needs Bruce Wayne.
dialog: Your resources, your
dialog: knowledge...not your body. Not your
text: life. That time has passed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I tried helping as Bruce Wayne,
dialog: Alfred. And I failed.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: You can fail as Bruce Wayne. As
dialog: Batman, you can't afford to.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: That's what you're afraid of - that
dialog: if I go back out there I'll fail.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: No. I'm afraid that you want to.

speaker_heading: TRADER 2
dialog: You can't short the stock because

speaker_heading: TRADER 1
dialog: Wayne coming back is change. Change
dialog: is either good or bad.
speaker_heading: TRADER 2
dialog: On what basis?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRADER 1

speaker_heading: TRADER 3

dialog: Alright, I'll take it.

dialog: face.
dialog: 
scene_heading: FEMALE SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Rookie! Lose the helmet! (Points at

dialog: 
text: In the rest room: a Janitor mops the floor, shifting out of
text: the way of two Traders who rush in to pee.
text: At the shoeshine stand, Trader 1 waves a bill down at the
text: man shining his shoes without a glance. Shoeshine Man takes
text: the bill, then, as the Traders step off, he reaches into a
text: gym bag and checks an automatic weapon. He clicks the slide
text: home, then hoists the gym bag and heads for the trading
dialog: floor.
text: At the secure entrance: the Courier pulls off his helmet.
text: The Female Security Guard's eyes go wide.
dialog: 50.
dialog: 
text: In the rest room: the Janitor reaches into his bucket and
text: pulls out a machine pistol in a Ziploc bag.
dialog: 
text: Near the front entrance: Food Guy pulls an automatic pistol
text: - clubs Trader 3 with it, pastrami flying. Shoeshine Man
text: moves onto the floor, pulls out his weapon.
text: Under the Courier's helmet - a mask. Bane. He grabs the
text: Female Security Guard and throws her into her colleagues,
text: lashing out in four directions with rapidfire lethality.
text: Shoeshine Man fires into the large trading screens. The
text: floor erupts into a different frenzy - traders hit the deck,
text: screaming. Bane moves onto the floor...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRADER 1
dialog: This is a stock exchange, there's
dialog: no money you can steal -
text: He dries up as Bane stops. Turns to him...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: Why else would you people be here?
text: Bane grabs Trader 1 by the throat and drags him across the
text: floor to an online automated trades terminal... He puts the
text: man's thumb onto the print reader - the screen lights up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: Enter your password. Or I send
dialog: these men to your home.
dialog: 
text: Trader 1, terrified, types in his password. Outside, sirens.

speaker_heading: CATWOMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Careful what you wish for.

text: Catwoman pins his wrist to the wall at shoulder height using

speaker_heading: CATWOMAN

speaker_heading: CATWOMAN

speaker_heading: STRYVER

speaker_heading: CATWOMAN

text: Catwoman spins, disarms Stryver, grabs Daggett.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: So where is it?
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: Where's what?
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: The program. The 'Clean Slate'.
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: Oh, yeah - the ultimate tool for a
dialog: master thief with a record. I don't
dialog: have it.
text: The Bodyguard bursts in, gun drawn. Catwoman, holding

scene_heading: EXT. WINDOW-CLEANING PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Where is it?

speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: The 'Clean Slate'? Type in a name
dialog: and date of birth and within a
dialog: couple hours that person ceases to

dialog: good to be true.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: You're lying. Rykin Data took it to
dialog: prototype stage -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: That's why I bought them. But they
dialog: had nothing. It was a gangland
dialog: myth.
dialog: 
text: Catwoman leans back from Daggett, taking this in... Shapes

text: Daggett's bodyguards, these are Bane's men... Catwoman holds
text: Daggett by the throat, threatening him.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Stay back!
text: They continue to approach. One of them screws a silencer
text: onto his gun.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: I'm not bluffing!
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: They know...
dialog: 
text: All eyes search for the source of the voice. Catwoman spots

speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: They just don't care.
dialog: 
text: As the Mercenary with the silencer looks up, Catwoman leaps
text: forward, grabs his gun. Batman drops into the middle of the
text: fray, fighting back Mercenaries at Catwoman's back - she
text: fires at one, clipping him, he drops. She spins aiming at
text: another's head - Batman yanks her arm down, forcing her to
text: miss the Mercenary. Batman takes him out with a kick.
dialog: 62.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: You've got to be kidding.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: No guns. No killing.

speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Where's the fun in that?
text: As more mercenaries come out onto the roof, Batman runs for
text: the far edge.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Come on!
text: Catwoman follows, confused, as Batman leaps off the roof.
text: She gets to the edge, pauses to look down into the alley -
text: sees the black angular roof of the Bat, cockpit open.
text: Shots impact around her - she leaps, landing hard, but
text: gracefully on the back of the vehicle, slides into the
text: cockpit. As the engines thunder into life, and the canopy
text: hisses shut, taking bullets from above.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: My mother warned me about getting
dialog: into cars with strange men -
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: This isn't a car.
text: Catwoman flinches as the Bat thunders into the sky,
text: downdraft forcing the Mercenaries down onto the roof, all

scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP, SKYSCRAPER, GOTHAM - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: CATWOMAN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: You're welcome.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: I had it under control.
dialog: 63.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Those weren't street thugs - they
dialog: were trained killers. I saved your

dialog: you did with Bruce Wayne's
dialog: fingerprints.
text: Catwoman looks at him. Considering.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Wayne wasn't kidding about a
dialog: 'powerful friend'. I sold his
dialog: prints to Daggett. For something
dialog: that doesn't even exist.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: I doubt many people get the better
dialog: of you.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Hey, when a girl's desperate...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: What were they going to do with
dialog: them?
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: I don't know. But Daggett seemed
dialog: pretty interested in that mess at
dialog: the stock market.
text: Batman considers this. A police chopper sweeps past,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Miss Kyle -?

scene_heading: INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Very inconspicuous. Shall I tell

speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: ALFRED

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: (pulls out USB drive)
dialog: I retrieved this.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Shouldn't the police be gathering
dialog: the evidence?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: They don't have the tools to
dialog: analyze it.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: They would if you gave them to them
dialog: -
speaker_heading: WAYNE
text: One man's tool is another man's
dialog: weapon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: In your mind, perhaps. But there
dialog: aren't many things you couldn't
text: turn into a weapon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Alfred. Enough. The police weren't
dialog: getting it done -
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Perhaps they would've if you
dialog: haven't made a sideshow of
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Perhaps you're upset you were
dialog: wrong.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Wrong?
dialog: 65.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: You thought I didn't have it in me.
text: Alfred looks at him. Puts down the cape and cowl.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: You don't. You lead a bloated

dialog: some fancy new toys from Fox. What
dialog: about when you come up against him.
dialog: What then?
dialog: 
text: Alfred points to the monitor - Wayne sees Bane killing...
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I'll fight harder, I always have.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: When you had something to fight
dialog: for. What are you fighting for now?
dialog: Not your life.
text: Wayne moves to switch off the monitor. Alfred grabs his
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
text: Take a good look. At his speed, his
dialog: ferocity, His training. I see the
dialog: power of belief. Of the fanatic. I
dialog: see the League of Shadows
text: resurgent.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: You said he was excommunicated.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: By R¯'s al Gh¯l. Who leads them
speaker_heading: A U
dialog: now?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: R¯'s al Gh¯l was the League of
speaker_heading: A U
dialog: Shadows. And I beat him. Bane's
dialog: just a mercenary, and we have to
dialog: find out what he's up to.
text: Wayne plugs the USB in, hits keys. Text scrolls.

speaker_heading: ALFRED

speaker_heading: WAYNE
text: Mine. Courtesy of Selina Kyle.

scene_heading: INT. HALL, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I'll get this to Fox. But no more.
text: Wayne hears his tone of voice. Turns to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I've sewn you up and set your
dialog: bones...but I won't bury you. I've
dialog: buried enough members of the Wayne
dialog: family.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: You'd abandon me?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: You see only one end to your story.
dialog: Leaving is all I have to make you
dialog: understand: you aren't Batman
dialog: anymore - you have to find another
dialog: way. You used to talk about
dialog: finishing. About life beyond that
dialog: awful cave -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Rachel died knowing we'd decided to
dialog: be together. That was my life
dialog: beyond this cave and I can't just
text: move on. She didn't. She couldn't.
dialog: 
text: Alfred considers this. Looks away.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: What if he had? What if she wasn't
dialog: intending to make a life with you?
dialog: 67.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: She was, I can't change that -
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: What if, before she died, she'd
dialog: written a letter? Explaining that
dialog: she'd chosen Harvey Dent over you?
text: Wayne watches, confused, as the old man prepares to say -
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: And what if, to spare you
dialog: pain...I'd burned that letter?
text: Wayne stares at Alfred, shocked.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Why would you say such a thing?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Because I have to make you
dialog: understand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: You're lying.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Because you are as precious to me
dialog: as you were to your own mother and
dialog: father and I swore to them that I
dialog: would protect you and I haven't.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: You're lying!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I've never lied to you. Except when
dialog: I burned Rachel's letter.
text: Wayne turns on the old man, furious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: How dare you use Rachel to stop me!
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I'm using the truth, Master Wayne.
dialog: Maybe it's time we all stopped
text: trying to outsmart the truth and
dialog: just let it have its day. I'm
dialog: sorry.
dialog: 68.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Sorry?! You expect to destroy my
dialog: world, then shake hands?!
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: No. I know what this means -
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: What does it mean, Alfred?!
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: It means your hatred. It means
dialog: losing the person I've cared for
dialog: ever since I heard his first cries
dialog: echo through this house. But it
dialog: might also mean saving your life.
dialog: And that is more important.
dialog: 
text: Wayne looks at Alfred. Furious. Summons the worst thing to

speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: FOX

speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Long term we may be able to prove

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: The weapons - we can't let Daggett
dialog: get his hands on Applied Sciences -
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Applied Sciences is shut up tight,

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Miranda Tate. We need to convince

speaker_heading: FOX

speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Ignition, yes. But no chain

speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You've built a lot of security

dialog: Nothing.
dialog: About three years ago a Russian

speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Would it make you feel better to
dialog: know that the Russian scientist
dialog: died in a plane crash six months
dialog: ago?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Someone else will work out what Dr.
dialog: Pavel did. Someone else will figure
dialog: out how to turn this power source
dialog: into a nuclear weapon. I need you
dialog: to take control of Wayne
dialog: Enterprises and this reactor.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: And to do what with it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Nothing. Until we can find a way to
dialog: guarantee its safety.
dialog: 72.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: And if we can't?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Decommission it. Flood it.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Destroy the world's best chance for
dialog: a sustainable future?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: If the world's not ready. Yes.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Bruce, if you want to save the
dialog: world you have to start trusting
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I'm trusting you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Doesn't count. You have no choice.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I could've flooded this chamber any
dialog: time in the last three years. I'm
dialog: choosing to trust you, Miranda, and
dialog: that's not the easiest thing for
dialog: me. Please.
text: His eyes are genuine. Pleading. Miranda nods.

scene_heading: INT. BOARDROOM, WAYNE ENTERPRISES - DAY
dialog: 
text: The Board Members, including Daggett and Miranda, take their
text: seats. Fox at one end of the table, Wayne at the other.
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: I'd like to point out that we have
dialog: a non-board member here. Highly
dialog: irregular, even if it is his family
text: name above the door...
text: All eyes go to Wayne. An older member of the board pipes up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FREDERICKS
dialog: Bruce Wayne's family built this
speaker_heading: COMPANY -
dialog: 73.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOARD MEMBER 2
dialog: And he himself has run it -
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: Into the ground, sir. Anybody
dialog: disagree? Check the value of your
text: shares this morning. Gambling on
dialog: crazy futures didn't just lose Mr.
dialog: Wayne his seat, it's lost us all a
dialog: lot of money. He needs to leave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I'm afraid he has a point, Mr.
dialog: Wayne.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I understand. Ladies and gentlemen.
dialog: 
text: Wayne glances at Miranda who nods at him. Wayne leaves.
speaker_heading: DAGGETT

speaker_heading: FOX

scene_heading: INT. LOBBY, WAYNE ENTERPRISES - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Wayne, how's it feel to be one of
dialog: the people?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMPANY VALET
dialog: I'm sorry, sir, they had paperwork
dialog: -
dialog: 
text: Wayne looks over to see his Lamborghini being towed.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (O.S.)

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DAGGETT'S PENTHOUSE - DAY
text: Daggett bursts in, furious. Stryver tries to placate him.
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: How the hell did Miranda Tate get
text: the inside track on the Wayne
dialog: board?! Was she meeting with Wayne?
dialog: Was she sleeping with Wayne?
speaker_heading: STRYVER
dialog: Not that we know of -
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: Clearly you don't 'know of'
dialog: anything, do you?! Where's Bane?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STRYVER
dialog: We told him it was urgent -
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: Then where is the masked -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE (O.S.)
dialog: Speak of the devil...
text: Daggett turns. Bane is already there.
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: ...and he shall appear.
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: What the hell's going on?
speaker_heading: BANE
text: The plan is proceeding as expected.
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: You see me running Wayne
dialog: Enterprises?! (Moves towards Bane.)
dialog: Your stock exchange hit didn't
dialog: work, friend. And now you've got my
dialog: construction crews working all
dialog: hours around the city? How's that
dialog: supposed to help my company absorb
dialog: Wayne's?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE
speaker_heading: (TO STRYVER)
dialog: Leave us.
dialog: 75.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: You stay right there! I'm in
dialog: charge!
text: Bane places a gentle hand on Daggett's shoulder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: Do you feel in charge?
text: Daggett is taken aback. Stryver leaves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: I've paid you a small fortune -
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: And that gives you power over me?
dialog: 
text: Daggett considers the heavy hand on his shoulder. Nervous.
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: Your money and infrastructure have
dialog: been important. Till now.
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: What are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE
text: Gotham's reckoning. Come to end the
dialog: borrowed time you've all been
dialog: living on...
dialog: 
text: Bane gently takes the terrified Daggett's head in his
dialog: hands...
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: You are true evil...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: I am necessary evil.

scene_heading: INT./EXT. CRUISER ON GOTHAM STREETS - MOMENTS LATER
text: Wayne stares out the window. Blake glances across.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: When you began...why the mask?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: To protect the people closest to
dialog: me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: You're a loner with no family.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: There are always people you care
dialog: about. You just don't realize how
dialog: much until they're gone. (Collects
dialog: himself.) The idea was to be a
dialog: symbol. Batman could be anybody,
dialog: that was the point.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: It was damn good to see him back.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Not everybody agrees.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: They'll figure it out in the end.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Got anything on Bane's whereabouts?
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Yeah, I've got five hundred pages
text: of tunnel records and a flashlight.
dialog: I could use some help.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
speaker_heading: (THINKS)
dialog: You know what? Drop me in Old

scene_heading: EXT. SELINA'S BUILDING, OLD TOWN, GOTHAM - DAY

text: Blake drops Wayne off.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Don't wait. I'll get a cab.
dialog: 77.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: You got money?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: (smiles, sheepish)
dialog: Actually, no.
text: Blake hands him some bills, watches him cross the street.
text: The radio squawks. Blake reacts - drives off.

scene_heading: INT. SELINA'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Selina is packing a bag. She hears voices in the stairwell.

scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL OUTSIDE SELINA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: Selina finds Wayne standing there with Jen.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: He's not a mark.

speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: And he doesn't have a cent to his
dialog: name, anyway.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SELINA'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Wayne looks at the cramped space. Selina shifts,
dialog: embarrassed.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Yeah, it's not much. (Smiles.) But
dialog: it's more that you've got right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Actually, they're letting me keep
dialog: the house.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELINA
speaker_heading: (SHAKES HEAD)
dialog: The rich don't even go broke same

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: (spots her bag)
dialog: Vacation?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Let's just say that I've incurred
dialog: the wrath of some people less
dialog: susceptible to my charms than you.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: My powerful friend hopes to change
dialog: your mind about leaving.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: And how would he do that?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: By giving you what you want.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: It doesn't exist.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
text: He says it does. He wants to meet.
dialog: Tonight.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
text: He needs to find Bane. He thinks
dialog: you'd know how.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Tell him I'll think about it.
text: Wayne nods, starts to leave.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Mr. Wayne? I'm sorry they took all

speaker_heading: WAYNE

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Blake enters. Gordon is sitting up in bed, talking to Foley.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Can we help you, officer?
speaker_heading: BLAKE
text: John Daggett's body was found in a
dialog: dumpster an hour ago. I thought you
dialog: might like to know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Because Daggett's name is all over
dialog: the permits I pulled to map the
text: tunnels under Gotham.
text: Blake hands Gordon a stack of files. Foley glares at Blake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: MTA maintenance, sewer
dialog: construction...
speaker_heading: GORDON
speaker_heading: (TO FOLEY)
dialog: Where did you get to with the
dialog: tunnel searches?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
speaker_heading: (TO BLAKE)
dialog: Remind me to tell the detail to
dialog: keep hotheads out. (To Gordon.)
dialog: We've had teams down there, but
dialog: it's a huge network -
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Get more men, work a grid. I want
dialog: him found.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Yeah, yeah - the masked man. We're
text: on it.
dialog: 
text: Gordon eyes the files hungrily - glances up at Blake.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: This is good work. Lose the uniform
dialog: - you're working for me now. We
dialog: could use some hotter heads around
dialog: here.
dialog: 80.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: This could just be a coincidence.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: You're a detective now, son, you're
dialog: not allowed to believe in
dialog: coincidence anymore.
text: Blake tries to conceal his excitement from Foley.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - EVENING (END OF DAY)
text: Wayne, covering his head with a newspaper, hurries up the
text: driveway in the rain. Steps into the alcove. Hits the bell.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (O.S)
text: Nobody's answering.
text: Wayne turns to find Miranda there.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: No. I'm on my own now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Do you have keys?
text: Wayne looks a little helpless all of a sudden.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Never needed them...
text: She takes his hand.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Let's find a window.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GREAT ROOM, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS (END OF DAY)
text: They force the French windows - enter, brushing off the
dialog: rain.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Fox worked the board like you've
dialog: never seen - I'm in, Daggett's out
text: and he's not happy.
text: Wayne sets down the newspaper:
text: FROM BILLIONAIRE TO BUM
dialog: 81.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Hope you don't like me for your
dialog: money.
text: Miranda kicks off her shoes. Glances at the paper.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
text: Suffering builds character.
text: Then at a photo of Wayne's parents.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I'll take care of your parents'
dialog: legacy, Bruce.
text: Miranda picks up a photo of Rachel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Who's this?
text: Wayne looks at her. Can't find words...
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Where's Alfred?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
text: He left. Taking everything.
text: Miranda puts the photo down. Kisses him. Passionately. Then
text: again. He kisses back. Suddenly the lights go out.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: What's that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
speaker_heading: (SHEEPISH)
dialog: I think my power's been shut off.

scene_heading: INT. SAME - LATER (NIGHT)
dialog: 
text: Wayne watches as Miranda tends to a roaring fire.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: You're pretty good at that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: When I was a child we had almost
dialog: nothing. But on the nights we had a
dialog: fire, we felt very rich indeed.
text: She returns to him, pulling a blanket around both of them.
dialog: 82.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I assumed your family was wealthy.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Not always. Not when I was young.
dialog: 
text: He traces a scar on her shoulder.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: An old mistake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I've made a few myself.
text: She turns to him, tracing the scars across his chest.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: More than a few... (Smiles.) We
dialog: could leave. Tonight. Take my
dialog: plane. Go anywhere we wanted.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Someday perhaps. Not tonight.
text: She pulls him close. He kisses her. They fold into each
text: other, the warm heart at the center of a vast, cold room.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GREAT ROOM, WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT
text: Miranda is sleeping, wrapped in the blanket. Wayne studies
text: her for a moment, then slips out...

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BATCAVE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Wayne moves to the Batsuit. Picks up the cowl.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SKIES ABOVE GOTHAM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The Bat roars towards downtown. Batman kills the lights and

scene_heading: INT. MIA TUNNEL - LATER
dialog: 
text: Catwoman on a wall, watching trains go by. She senses...
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Don't be shy.

speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Wayne says you can get me the
dialog: 'Clean Slate'.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: That depends.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: On what?
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: On what you want it for. I acquired
dialog: it to keep it out of the wrong
dialog: hands.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Still don't trust me, huh? How can
dialog: we change that?
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Start by taking me to Bane.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
speaker_heading: (SHRUGS)
dialog: You asked.
text: Catwoman jumps down. Batman follows. Catwoman leads him down
text: into a service tunnel...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SERVICE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
text: Catwoman speaks over her shoulder as she walks.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
text: From here, Bane's men patrol the

speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Neither am I.
text: Catwoman swings into a -
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SEWER TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: A Mercenary patrols. Catwoman comes up behind.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: He's behind you.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCENARY
speaker_heading: (SPINS)
dialog: Who?
text: Batman hangs upside down behind him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BATMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Me.
text: Darkness smashes onto the Mercenary. Gunfire in the tunnel.
text: Catwoman races along, pursued by a Mercenary. He is yanked
text: off his feet by darkness - he screams...
text: Batman picks off more and more Mercenaries. Screams echo...
text: Batman follows Catwoman through the dark tunnel.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Just a little further.
text: A grate slams down, separating them - the lights come on. He
text: is deep inside.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BANE'S LAIR, SEWERS - CONTINUOUS
text: Mercenaries look down on him from above. Catwoman turns.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: I had to find a way to stop them
dialog: trying to kill me.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: You've made a serious mistake.
speaker_heading: BANE (O.S.)
dialog: Not as serious as yours, I fear.
text: Batman turns. Bane emerges from behind the waterfalls.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Bane.
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: Let's not stand on ceremony here,
dialog: Mr. Wayne.
dialog: 
text: Catwoman hears the name. Less sure of what she's done.
text: Batman moves at Bane - strikes powerful blows - Bane catches
text: his fist.
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: Peace has cost you strength.
dialog: Victory has defeated you.
dialog: 85.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Bane SMASHES Batman back - kicks him off the catwalk -
text: Batman drops, uses his cape to land. Bane climbs down on a
text: chain - his men watch in disciplined silence - Batman hurls
text: flashbangs at Bane, who doesn't flinch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: Theatricality and deception are
dialog: powerful agents...to the
text: uninitiated.
text: Batman lashes out at Bane - Bane counters - they separate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: But we are initiated, aren't we,
dialog: Bruce? The League of Shadows. And
dialog: you betrayed us...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Us? You were excommunicated. From a
text: gang of psychopaths.
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: Now I am the League of Shadows,
dialog: here to fulfill R¯'s al Gh¯l's
speaker_heading: A U
dialog: destiny...
text: Batman hurls himself at Bane, throwing him into the
text: waterfall, where he smashes his fists and gauntlets into
text: Bane's mask again and again, water cascading over them.
dialog: 
text: Bane is not moving. Just taking the blows. Batman pauses.
text: Bane's arms SHOOT OUT, SMASHING Batman aside - Bane RISES...
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: You fight like a younger man.
text: Nothing held back. No reserves.
dialog: Admirable. But mistaken.
text: Batman hits a switch on his belt - the lights go out - Bane
text: turns slowly addressing all the shadows at once.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: You think darkness is your ally.
dialog: But you merely adopted the dark. I
dialog: was born in it. Formed by it...
dialog: 
text: In the shadows, Batman circles, looking to strike...
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: I didn't see the light until I was
dialog: already a man. And by then it was
dialog: nothing to me but blinding...
dialog: 86.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Bane lunges backwards into the darkness - Batman's throat in
text: his grasp.
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: The shadows betray you, because
dialog: they belong to me...
dialog: 
text: Bane SMASHES him into the ground, POUNDING, pounding,
text: pounding the hard cowl with his bare fists until it CRACKS.
text: Bane RISES from Batman, gestures to the ceiling of the
text: chamber - explosive charges have been drilled into holes...
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: I will show you where I've made my
dialog: home while preparing to bring
dialog: justice. Then...I will break you.
dialog: 
text: A Mercenary tosses Bane a detonator - Batman watches through

speaker_heading: BATMAN

speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: I wondered which would break first
dialog: - your spirit...
dialog: 
text: Batman SWINGS at him - misses - Bane GRABS him, lifts him
speaker_heading: HIGH.
dialog: ...or your body.
text: Bane brings Batman down onto his knee, BREAKING his back
text: with a horrific CRACK.
dialog: 87.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: In the shadows, Catwoman looks on. Shocked. Bane crouches to
text: pull the broken cowl off the broken Wayne. Mercenaries lift
text: Wayne's body and carry him off... Bane stares into the

speaker_heading: SELINA

scene_heading: INT. JETWAY, AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: BLAKE

speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Don't tell me, still in love?
speaker_heading: BLAKE

speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Who then? Bane? What do you know

speaker_heading: SELINA
speaker_heading: (QUIET)

speaker_heading: BLAKE

speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: When I spotted you, I was looking

speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BLIND PRISONER
dialog: How can you move faster then

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I do fear death. I fear dying in

speaker_heading: BLIND PRISONER

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: BLIND PRISONER

text: As Wayne hoists himself up onto the precipice something
text: EXPLODES from the cliff face. Wayne flinches - BATS... They

speaker_heading: FOLEY

speaker_heading: GORDON

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I admit I felt a little let down.
dialog: But I still think there's more to

dialog: 
text: She looks at him. Takes the drive, staring at it.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Start fresh? I can't even get off
dialog: this island.

speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Why do you need Fox?
speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: BATMAN
