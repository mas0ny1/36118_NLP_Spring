speaker_heading: DINA
dialog: Fuck that. Do it like a Brazilian

speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I’ve known about this for a few
dialog: months now.
dialog: The ladies’ jaws drop. The fuck?!
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Obviously, I was upset when I
dialog: found out, but we’re in counseling
dialog: and we’re working through it.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Oh. Well, that’s great. You're
dialog: working it out.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Stewart and I are a team. He made

speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: No, it’s not, this picture was

speaker_heading: RYAN

speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Hold on. I hear everything you’re
dialog: saying. And I’m down. But you can’t
dialog: just pretend this picture doesn’t

text: before the photographer shops it.
dialog: It’s all fair game in journalism.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Journalism? Is that what this is?
text: Sasha gives her a look. Ryan concedes.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: What do you think I should do?
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Let me find out if anyone else has

dialog: photo.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Are you crazy?! Calmart wants to
dialog: make a deal for a Ryan and Stewart
dialog: BRAND. I can’t have pictures of him
dialog: kissing another woman on your site!
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Hear me out. If I leak it, we can

dialog: angle to minimize the damage.
text: Ryan hates that this is what her life has become.
speaker_heading: RYAN

speaker_heading: LISA/SASHA
dialog: Dina, no!!!
text: Drake’s “0 to 100” drops. The ladies watch, horrified, as

speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: What the hell is wrong with you?
speaker_heading: DINA
dialog: You KNOW, nigga! Don’t play me!
text: Dina grabs an empty bottle off an adjacent table, breaks it,

speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: (re Dina)
text: She's holding a broken Pellegrino
dialog: bottle.
text: Lisa carefully takes the broken bottle from Dina’s hand. Ryan

speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: What the hell happened?! I was gone
dialog: for three minutes!
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: It happened really quickly.
speaker_heading: LISA
text: Like a summer sunset. It was bright

speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Sir, I apologize for my friends,

speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: Dina, you're lucky my aunt is hard

speaker_heading: DINA
dialog: And you lucky I don’t carry a

speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Mr Pierce, we're in the process of
dialog: removing this woman right now.
speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: If that’s your policy then I
dialog: understand.
text: Ryan is incredulous at Stewart. The security guard moves in.
speaker_heading: DINA
dialog: Okay, okay, I’m going. Just give me
dialog: one second.
text: The security waits a beat. Dina reels back and OPEN HAND
text: SLAPS THE DOG SHIT OUT OF STEWART.
speaker_heading: DINA (CONT'D)
dialog: Alright, now I’m ready.
text: The guard escorts Dina outside. Lisa and Sasha follow.
speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: Your girl needs a leash.

speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (with a smile)
dialog: Your room. Now.

speaker_heading: STEWART

speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: My bad? You didn’t burn dinner.
dialog: Your sloppy ass got caught sucking

speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: I didn’t invite her.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: So? You need to send that

speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: Come on, babe. How am I supposed to

speaker_heading: RYAN

speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: (pulling out his phone)
dialog: Done.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: You're really going to do it right
dialog: in front of me?
speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: Trying to be pro-active.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: You know what? I can’t do this.
dialog: This is bullshit. This hasn’t been
dialog: a marriage in awhile, but we agreed
dialog: to at least be a partnership. Your
dialog: trifling ass can’t hold up your end
dialog: of the bargain. Let alone your
dialog: pants. This is against everything I

speaker_heading: STEWART

speaker_heading: STEWART (CONT'D)
dialog: You're right: you don’t deserve
dialog: this. But our brand is who we are.
dialog: It’s who you are. Giving all that
dialog: up because I was sloppy isn’t worth
dialog: all that you have worked very hard
dialog: to accomplish. And for what? To
dialog: have that crumble? To be alone?
text: Ryan looks at him with disdain, but what he says resonates.
speaker_heading: STEWART (CONT'D)
dialog: Ry, I’m not going anywhere. You
dialog: know that. Let’s just keep doing
dialog: our dance and handle our business.
dialog: Be that couple who has it all. You
dialog: know you love me...
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: No more slip-ups. Stick to the

speaker_heading: SASHA

speaker_heading: HOBO

speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Did anyone else just flash back to
dialog: Ft. Lauderdale? Senior year?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Come to think of it, this room may
dialog: be an exact replica.
speaker_heading: DINA
text: Except the junk smashed against the

speaker_heading: RYAN

speaker_heading: STEWART

speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: And Stewart is a messy cook.
dialog: Doesn't clean after himself and
dialog: improvs. A lot.
speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: (sensing a shift)
dialog: Well, there is no one way to be in

dialog: just loves to dole it out---
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: (intervening)
dialog: Ryan. Just how much sausage should
dialog: be added?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: When it comes to sausage it all
dialog: depends on how greedy you want to
dialog: be before stuffing it in your bowl.
text: Ryan grabs a MEAT CLEAVER swinging it dangerously close to
text: Stewart who has to weave out of the way.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You can chop it. .
text: Whack whack whack goes the cleaver into the sausage.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You can even grind it.
text: Ryan grabs two sausages, tosses them in a meat grinder and

scene_heading: BETHANY AND ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: BETHANY

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Uh-huh. Yeah. It’s colloquial: “put

dialog: get hurt” Same etymology.
speaker_heading: SHAUN ROBINSON
speaker_heading: SHAUN ROBINSON
dialog: This ladies and gentlemen this may

speaker_heading: LISA

speaker_heading: FAT COP

dialog: You know who did it?
speaker_heading: LISA

speaker_heading: FAT COP

dialog: Thank you, Stew, for that wonderful
dialog: introduction. Thank you Essence for
dialog: the honor of speaking today. And
dialog: last but not least, thank you all
dialog: for coming out to support me...

text: Teleprompter.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: As most of you know, there’ve been
dialog: many questions about the status of
dialog: my marriage. And I'd like to put
dialog: those rumors to rest... The picture
dialog: that surfaced this morning isn’t
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 114
dialog: Official White 6-15-16 109.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: real. All allegations of infidelity
dialog: are false. My husband and I are in
text: a loving, faithful marriage.
scene_heading: INT. CONVENTION CENTER - HALLWAY - SAME TIME 114
text: The ladies, sweaty and out of breath, run down the hall.
text: Sasha spots the main auditorium doors. They’re closed.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Oh no, it’s already started...
text: Dina reaches for the handle. A VOLUNTEER halts them.
speaker_heading: VOLUNTEER
dialog: Sorry, ladies. No late entries.
text: Lisa and Sasha look to Dina, knowingly.
scene_heading: INT. CONVENTION CENTER - MAIN AUDITORIUM - MOMENTS LATER 115
text: With a loud BANG the back doors open abruptly as Dina kicks
text: them in, the ladies tumble inside, causing a scene.
speaker_heading: VOLUNTEER (0.C.) DINA
dialog: I’m calling security! I said step back, fool!
text: Ryan stops. EVERYONE turns and looks toward the commotion.
text: Dina straightens her clothing. Lisa smiles politely.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Please... Continue.
text: Ryan smiles, taking in the sight of her girls. She looks into
text: the audience, sees VARIOUS WOMEN she’s encountered over the
text: weekend. Women who look up to her. Ryan tries to continue.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: In fact, my husband and I are
dialog: stronger than ever...
text: Ryan pauses for a long beat. Her emotions catching up.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Come on, Ry...
text: The crowd waits. Ryan wrestles with her conscience. Then
text: looks at her girls, her support system, the Flossy Posse.
dialog: Official White 6-15-16 110.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: My agent wrote a very convincing
dialog: statement for me to read to you.
dialog: And I really thought I could go
dialog: through with it... because I’ve
dialog: done a really great job of
dialog: pretending so many times before.
dialog: But sometimes you reach a point
dialog: when you just can’t anymore. And I
dialog: can’t. I’m tired of all the lies...
text: Stewart looks nervous as hell. He stands, trying to stop her.
speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: Ry, let’s take a minute here--
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Stewart, sit down. Please.
speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: Ryan, baby. Be careful--
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Sit your ass down. Now.
dialog: (to the audience)
dialog: The picture is real. My husband is
dialog: having an affair. When I found out,
dialog: I felt a lot of things: Anger.
dialog: Heartache. Betrayal. But mostly,
dialog: fear. Fear that my marriage was
dialog: ending and that I would be alone.
dialog: And I was terrified of that... So
dialog: terrified I was willing to stay
dialog: with someone who betrayed my trust.
dialog: So terrified I was willing to
dialog: accept being treated as less than I
dialog: am...
text: Stewart hangs his head. Humiliated. People are shocked.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: And I know that I’m not alone in
dialog: this. I know a lot of us stay in
dialog: bad relationships because we've
dialog: convinced ourselves that being
dialog: disrespected is better than being
dialog: alone. But we shouldn’t fear being
dialog: alone. Because there’s power in re-
dialog: discovering our own voice.
text: Julian, in the audience, smiles.
dialog: Official White 6-15-16 111.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: And I'd forgotten that. I forgot
dialog: that years before I was Stewart’s
dialog: wife, I was Ryan. A woman with her
dialog: own ambitions. Her own dreams.
text: She makes eye contact with Sasha, Lisa and Dina.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: But luckily, my girls reminded me
dialog: of that... reminded me of my own
dialog: worth. And that there was a time
dialog: when I didn’t fear anything.
text: Their eyes well with pride.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: No one has the power to shatter
dialog: your dreams unless you give it to
dialog: them. And I refuse to give anyone
dialog: that power again.
text: Ryan looks out at her fans in the crowd.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: If anything, I hope that me
dialog: revealing my truth inspires you to
dialog: realize your own. Thank you for
dialog: listening.
text: Ryan makes a swift exit, fighting off tears. As the door
text: closes, an ERUPTION OF APPLAUSE. Stewart sits there, stunned.

speaker_heading: RYAN
