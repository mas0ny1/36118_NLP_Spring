speaker_heading: DARKNESS - NOW
text: The beautiful CHIMING SOUNDS OF SPACE TRAVEL through the
text: COSMOS... DOTS OF LIGHT whiz past our face.
text: They could be stars at lightspeed, or... SUBWAY LIGHTS
text: FLICKER ON - in a flash we see PALE, SULLEN FACES, riding
text: into a bleak future, and hear the INDUSTRIAL CLATTER. It's
text: dark, claustrophobic, obscure... the rhythmic beat of track
text: and wheel-clicks engulf us. The lights flicker back on and
text: hold as we see a half dozen SOLDIERS in BROWN CAMO, steel-
text: eyed, prepared for whatever may be at the end of the TUNNEL.
speaker_heading: ZERO IN on TWO:
text: KABLE, 30-something, roughneck... focused, determined; eyes
text: burning with internalized emotion...
text: ... and SANDRA, late 20s, undeniably hot but tough as hell -
text: both are in shackles &amp; cuffs, being roughly transported
text: through underground tunnels, knocked and shoved around.
text: Uniformed GUARDS roam the train, looking pissed off - their
text: swagger seems to mask FEAR.
text: KABLE is meditating, or exhausted - hard to tell. The GIRL
dialog: makes eye contact w/ him.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: Sandra.
text: KABLE says nothing, just stares at her, stoic.
speaker_heading: SANDRA (cont'd)
dialog: My name is Sandra.
speaker_heading: GUARD

speaker_heading: SANDRA

dialog: Putcher dick away...
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Get some.
text: CRACKK!! CRACK!! CRACKK!! ... CRACK!! SANDRA is buckled
text: over, awkwardly, hands behind her back tethered to the seat,
text: head dripping blood. KABLE jerks against his restraints,
text: every inch of him wanting to RIP THE MOTHERFUCKER APART...
text: He uses his elbow to help her back up, but SANDRA fights
text: through it, sits back up and spits blood - she can handle
dialog: herself.
text: The CAMERA holds TIGHT on KABLE and SANDRA... KABLE lets a
text: glob of blood dangle from his mouth, biting his lip, bearing
text: it... we hear the CRUNCHING SOUND of the CLUB working on the
text: others... and the METALLIC RUMBLE and CLATTER of the TRAIN -
text: growing louder, POUNDING, slamming into our brains, blotting
dialog: out all thought... until...
scene_heading: 2 INT. TUNNEL #1 - DAY 2
text: POV: we are RUNNING, ragged, full sprint, down a TUNNEL
text: towards dirty white DAYLIGHT...
text: NO MUSIC - just heavy breath, KABLE'S HEARTBEAT and the sound
text: of his boots bouncing off the concrete...
text: Others are running with us - SOLDIERS with weapons... at the
text: tunnel's end: vaguely defined shapes of buildings, smoke,
dialog: sky...
dialog: Our POV WHITES OUT as we...
scene_heading: 3 EXT. SPAWN POINT #1 - CONTINUOUS 3
text: ... smash into the DAYLIGHT.
text: Smoke plumes hang from a recent skirmish. KABLE climbs over

text: of character, he LEAPS THROUGH THE AIR SLO-MO and lands in an
scene_heading: OVERDRAMATIC, ROCKSTAR POSE (Nine Inch Nails, Coachella
dialog: 2005).
text: In sequence, multicolored LEDs on his weapon COME TO LIFE -
text: accompanied by a low frequency hum that seems to pierce
text: somewhere below human hearing. The MULTIPLE TURRETS spin,
dialog: then snap into place. GO TIME.
scene_heading: 5 OTHER SPAWN POINTS 5
text: Other BROWN SOLDIERS emerge like SNAKES out of DIRT HOLES and
text: INTO THE LIGHT. They crouch and spread out.
scene_heading: 6 SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 6
text: What appear like BUZZING FLIES swarm thru the grey air - at a
text: closer look, they are like tiny BALL BEARINGS that move like
text: hummingbirds, magnetically controlled. The swarm splits
text: apart - each FLY connects with a different SOLDIER - they
text: hover one foot above and two feet behind the SOLDIER'S head.
scene_heading: 7 SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - COVER 7
text: KABLE slides behind a shredded telephone pole and TAKES
text: COVER. The sound of trains, weapons, soldiers all fade
dialog: away... until...
scene_heading: NOTHING. DEAD QUIET.
text: SUDDENLY - A BULLET WHIZZES by KABLE's face - a pause - THEN
text: we hear a GUNSHOT.
text: Another BULLET WHIRS by his leg and another by his shoulder -
text: after the bullets pass, we hear the GUNSHOTS. See the
dialog: lightning, wait for the thunder.
text: In the peripheral a SOLDIER in DEEP BLUE CAMO runs from
text: behind an old car to a brick staircase. Then another BLUE
text: runs the opposite way, closer in the foreground. BROWNS VS.
text: BLUES?? The SILENCE is crawling, deafening, and then...
speaker_heading: BOOM.
text: ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. Suddenly we are in IRAQ TIMES TEN...
text: KABLE'S eyes glance down at his WEAPON - the turrets quickly
text: shift and rotate - he whips it up in a flash and RETURNS FIRE
dialog: into the mist:
text: THOOM! THOOM! The shells puncture air and connect
dialog: distantly...

scene_heading: WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007
speaker_heading: 7 CONTINUED: 7
text: The air ripples all around him, his world closing in... he
text: breaks free and runs toward an open street - THE TURRETS
text: READJUST - he efficiently wastes two BLUES with automatic
dialog: fire.
scene_heading: 8 SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - OPEN STREET 8
text: A couple of PEDESTRIANS walk across the street, totally
text: IGNORING THE VIOLENCE. KABLE makes a perfect 90 degree cut
text: and wraps around a street-lamp and into the alley. A BUM
text: holds out a can with a couple of coins and SHAKES it.
text: From an aerial POV we see the area swarming with BROWN &amp; BLUE
text: combatants and a dozen CIVILIANS. In the top right corner
text: of our frame we see the DULL REFLECTION of a FACE, somewhat
text: transparent, watching the battle, tungsten red (similar to
dialog: your own reflection on a TV).
text: We SNAP BACK to the ground - the whole area is a BATTLEZONE.
text: KABLE lines up another BLUE climbing the fire-escape to the
text: third floor window - and then, coming from the REAR SURROUND
dialog: SPEAKERS, behind us:
text: A VOICE - almost a whisper, too clean and distinct to be
dialog: outdoors in this environment... and TOO YOUNG to possibly
dialog: belong to KABLE.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: (clean, disconnected)
dialog: Eat shit please.
text: THWIPPP!! The BLUE drops like a sack. KABLE perfectly cuts
text: back another 90 degrees and runs for an old store front.
text: Inside a CLERK "air" bags groceries for an empty store.
text: A BROWN SOLDIER sets up a TRIPOD MACHINE GUN and aims for a
text: bunker a hundred yards north. The distant BLUE targets seem
text: almost robotically unaware. The BROWN SOLDIER plants his
text: left hand on the ground for stability, right hand twisting
text: the grip-lock - and squeezing the trigger: TAT TAT TAT TAT
text: TAT TAT!!!! TATATATATATATATATA TAT!! The BLUES fall, some
text: clumsily colliding into each other before they crash to the
text: ground, dead.
text: Another team of BLUES rock their heads around to focus on
dialog: him. Uh oh...
text: BOOOOOSH!!!! The BROWN TRIPOD GUNNER is vaporized from the
text: knees up... the FOREARM that supported him is standing
text: straight up, cleanly severed at the elbow. It slowly wobbles
text: over and connects with the TWO LEGS severed at the knees.
text: The THREE LIMBS fall into each other, forming a flesh and
text: bone TRIPOD.

text: VROOOOOOSH!!! CHUKUNK, CHUKUNK!! A SNOWPLOW BARRELS THROUGH
text: THE DESTRUCTION, pushing the bodies and debris out of the way
text: and clearing a path, one streaked with crimson red and burnt
text: flesh. It moves fast and vanishes into the smoke clouds.
scene_heading: 9 SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - STREET 9
text: Down the road, KABLE saves an EAST-INDIAN WOMAN from getting
text: obliterated by shoving her out of the way of the blazing
text: truck. As KABLE turns to waste another BLUE, the EAST-INDIAN
text: WOMAN gets right back up... walking into and getting
text: obliterated by another TRUCK. It's creepy - robotic, but
text: violent and too real - like a programmed suicide.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Can't say I didn't try...
text: We sense emotion in KABLE'S cold eyes - then they flicker to
dialog: the peripheral.
scene_heading: 10 SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - 2ND FLOOR BUILDING 10
text: Tracking along a row of blown out windows a BLUE is taking
dialog: aim; we SNAP ZOOM in...
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSED OVER THE IMAGE:

speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Shit! Shit!
scene_heading: KABLE spins, TOO LATE -
text: BUT: from the level directly below the SNIPER - through an
text: open doorway - we see a BROWN SOLDIER, BLASTING STRAIGHT UP
text: THROUGH THE CEILING! The BLUE is BLOWN TO CHUNKS.
scene_heading: 11 SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - STREET 11
text: The BROWN runs out and hits the curb; CONCRETE AND MEAT
text: collapse on the spot where she stood... it's SANDRA.
text: KABLE gives her covering fire as she heads his way. They
text: bolt for a corner - KABLE reaches protection first. He stops
dialog: to let SANDRA catch up, and in that instant -
text: HER BRAINS GET BLOWN TO JELL-O. Blood and particles splatter

dialog: stray shot - PLINK!
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.) (cont'd)
dialog: ... what the...!
text: Bullets and shells chop up everything around KABLE, but he's

scene_heading: BODY ARMOR UNDERNEATH.

scene_heading: 12 INT. SAVE POINT #1 12

text: A PRISONER - shirtless, his upper body smeared with WHITE
text: POWDER, screaming, SLAMS HIS FIST DOWN INTO FACE. Blood

text: We see that he is beating down a uniformed GUARD. The GUARD
text: wears a black gas mask, shattered and pouring blood. Other

text: time - his shoes are made of cloth. CRUNCH. The GUARD stops
dialog: moving.
text: The PRISONER starts to run for it across the white terrain.
text: A group of GUARDS appear to round up the remaining prisoners.
text: They club them down with the butts of rifles but pay no mind
text: to the fleeing ROGUE... they merely watch him go, impassive.
text: In a moment, we see why - when the ROGUE PRISONER crosses

text: KABLE is sitting in what seems to be a minimal REC AREA cut

text: SIMON is completely freaked - it's happening too fast, no
text: time to react... he tries to engage HAND-TO-HAND but every

text: HACKMAN slams the pipe off the side of KABLE'S head, DROPPING

speaker_heading: Ethanol Only
speaker_heading: SIMON (O.S.)
dialog: Kable. Dude. What are you doing?

speaker_heading: SIMON (O.S.) (cont'd)
dialog: What the hell?

scene_heading: IGNITION... VRUUUUMM, KACHUNK, KACHUNK...

speaker_heading: SIMON (O.S.)

scene_heading: RECOGNIZE THE SCARRED, BATTLE-TOUGH FACES from the prison,
text: the game, the pursuit... only instead of BLUE, they are

text: behind CASTLE...
dialog: I'd sacrifice anything come what might
dialog: For the sake of having you near

text: room... glasses, beards, pony tails - silently, the GEEK
text: SQUAD has moved in and taken position. They move their hands
text: in rhythm, synchronized... each one seems to control a
text: DANCER: they TWIRL A FINGER and the SLAYER SPINS... kick
text: with TWO FINGERS FOR LEGS and the SLAYER KICKS like a
speaker_heading: ROCKETTE.
text: Suddenly, ON A MUSICAL HIT, everyone - CASTLE, the GEEKS, the
text: SLAYERS - points dramatically up at the wall, where a VIDEO

dialog: Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?
dialog: Use your mentality, wake up to reality...
dialog: But each time I do just the thought of you makes me STOP -
dialog: before I give in
dialog: Cause I've got you, under my skin...

dialog: taken care of that.
text: KABLE tosses it aside and sprints for CASTLE, but the SLAYERS
text: break off from the choreography to ENGAGE HIM; turns out
dialog: they're flesh and blood after all.
text: CASTLE backs away, whistling the melody, and continues his
text: SOFTSHOE to the music as KABLE wades into brutal hand-to-hand

text: looks into ANGIE'S eyes - she and KABLE are like one; he *
text: seems to draw strength from her... finally, KABLE WILLS *
text: EVERYTHING HE HAS and STABS THE KNIFE INTO THE FLOORBOARDS. *
dialog: Suddenly:
text: KABLE's head SNAPS around, his eyes confused... and in one
text: quick, smooth movement, KABLE YANKS THE KNIFE out of the
text: floor, RISES TO HIS FEET AND SPINS ON CASTLE. He claps a
text: hand around CASTLE'S neck and tries to jam the knife up into
text: his GUT - but CASTLE is able to FREEZE HIM just short...

dialog: FORWARD...

scene_heading: 163 INT. CASTLE'S COURT - CONTINUOUS 163
text: ... KABLE'S KNIFE HAND begins to inch forward. Now CASTLE is

dialog: JAM THE SIGNAL YOU GOD DAMN
speaker_heading: RETARDS!
speaker_heading: GEEK

dialog: CASTLE, but-
speaker_heading: KEN CASTLE
dialog: (like he's explaining the
dialog: obvious to a child)
dialog: I think it.
text: KABLE, succumbing to CASTLE'S control, begins to move the
text: knife away from CASTLE'S belly.
speaker_heading: KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
dialog: You... fucking... do it...
text: CASTLE delivers a CRUNCHING HEADBUTT to his NOSE, KABLE loses
text: his footing, sweat pouring down his face, bloody, drained...
text: CASTLE pushes the KNIFE back towards KABLE. He fights back -
text: every muscle in his arm fighting against another like Yin &amp;
text: Yang, veins rising in his neck...
text: Then KABLE senses an opportunity:
speaker_heading: KABLE
dialog: Look at this knife... imagine me
dialog: sticking it into your gut... think
dialog: about it... make it real.
text: CASTLE laughs... BUT HIS EYES FLICKER TO THE KNIFE - of
dialog: course he can't help but picture it...

speaker_heading: KABLE (cont'd)
dialog: ... is the fuckin pose really
dialog: necessary?
text: CASTLE face-plants on the COURT.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Sorry.
text: KABLE'S body relaxes; he tosses the knife across the floor...

dialog: Georgia peach accent.
speaker_heading: DELIA
dialog: Are you my Daddy Tillman?
text: He gathers DELIA in his arms and lifts her off her feet,
text: squeezing her close; she SQUEEZES BACK. KABLE grabs ANGIE
text: with his other arm and pulls her in.
text: The GEEKS look at one another - realize that their employment
dialog: contract with CASTLE has just been terminated... shrug;
