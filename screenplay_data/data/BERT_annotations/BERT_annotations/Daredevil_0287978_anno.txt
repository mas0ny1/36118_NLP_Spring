speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. HELL'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: The street is empty save for the garbage that waits for
text: collection. Rotten haystacks of moldered meat, soiled
text: diapers, and sour milk crowd the sidewalks and stoops.
text: A HISS OF STEAM bursts from a sewer grate. It RISES UP like
text: a spirit, skirting the face of a crumbling Catholic church as
text: the sound of wind WHISTLES through CREAKING rafters. An oily
text: rat SKITTERS along a rain gutter matted with dry leaves. Each
text: noise is exaggerated, amplified into a symphony of sounds.
scene_heading: DRIP. DRIP. DRIP.
text: DROPS OF BLOOD trickle down a stained glass window; cutting a
text: clear trail across the dusty pane. We trace the blood trail
text: up to a large CRUCIFIX at the roof’s peak.
scene_heading: DRIP. DRIP. DRIP. DRIP.
text: The droplets become rivulets as we reveal a SILHOUETTE draped
text: over the cross. The silhouette of a devil. A SEARCHLIGHT
text: from a POLICE HELICOPTER cuts a path across the rooftops,
text: revealing the devil to be a man in costume.
text: This is DAREDEVIL.
dialog: So forget what you know about superheroes. Because this is
dialog: the real world. And in the real world there is no such thing
text: as “mutant healing’ or “spider sense” to keep a man alive.
text: In the real world there's just a guy in a mask.
text: And he’s bleeding to death.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH SANCTUARY - NIGHT
text: A skylight CREAKS OPEN and the devil slowly hangs down into
text: the church before hitting the floor with an ugly THUD.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A PAIR OF SHOES stopping at the sound. CAMERA TILTS UP to
text: reveal the weathered face of a priest, FATHER EVERETT. He
text: opens the door to the sanctuary to discover...
text: THE DEVIL.
text: Curled up on the altar; like a pill bug swallowing its pain.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED :
text: The old priest runs to the devil's side and cradles his head
text: before pulling back his crimson cowl to reveal...
scene_heading: MATT MURDOCK.
text: The searchlight hits Matt’s eyes through the skylight. But as
text: we PUSH IN we notice his pupils never dilate. They say your
dialog: whole life flashes before you when you die. And it’s true.
dialog: Even for a blind man.
scene_heading: MATCH DISSOLVE TO:
speaker_heading: THOSE SAME EYES
text: before they went blind. We PULL BACK to reveal MATT AT 14
text: YEARS OLD. He sports a cut lip and a bloody nose as he
text: stands over a kitchen sink. He splashes his face with cold
text: water and watches as the blood swirls down the drain...
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Dad? I’m home.
text: He steps into the living room to find his father passed out
text: - in front of the T.V. JACK MURDOCK. He’s a handsome man
text: despite a nose that’s been broken too many times to count.
scene_heading: T.V. RING ANNOUNCER
dialog: And the winner, by unanimous decision...
dialog: Gene “The Machine’ Conlan!
text: Matt CLICKS the T.V. off and pries a beer bottle from his
text: father’s fingers before pulling him to his feet.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: +. .™mm...wha...who...who won?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Conlan. By decision.
text: We TRACK THEM as Matt eases his father down the hall...

scene_heading: IN THE BEDROOM
text: Matt wrestles his shoes off as Jack notices his cut lip.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What‘s this?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Nothin’.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I told you I don’t want you fighting.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I don’t fight. I get beat up.
dialog: There's a difference.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Matt...
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I tried to walk away. Like you said.
dialog: But they kept giving me shit.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Don’t curse. What kinda shit?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (hesitant)
dialog: They said you work for Fallon. They said
dialog: you’re one of his guys now.
text: A LONG BEAT as Jack looks to his son’s pleading eyes.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Think I‘d be bustin’ my hump down at the-
dialog: docks if I was working for Fallon?
text: Matt smiles, relieved.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: You just keep hitting the books, you hear?
dialog: Be a doctor or a lawyer. Not like me.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Sure, Dad.

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I promise.
text: Jack pats Matt’s cheek.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: She woulda been proud, Matty...
text: And with that he falls back asleep. Matt SIGHS and steps
text: over to the window, gazing out to the rooftops that stretch
text: forever. As CAMERA CLOSES ON the FULL MOON we

text: A BIOHAZARD WARNING
text: in a circular design, FILLING FRAME, before a FORKLIFT
text: carrying a PALLET OF DRUMS turns to reveal that we're on:
scene_heading: EXT. WATERFRONT LOADING DOCK - DAY
text: Matt quickly weaves through the busy docks with a card in his
text: hand, searching for his father when:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: HEY! KID!
text: Matt spins around to face the SUPERVISOR.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
dialog: You trying to get yourself killed?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I’m looking for my dad. Jack Murdock.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
dialog: Murdock? He ain’t worked here for over
dialog: six months. Now beat it.
text: He turns, crestfallen, and tosses the card into a mud puddle.
text: We PUSH IN to reveal it’s his REPORT CARD. Straight A’‘s
dialog: Cur TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET/DOCKS - DAY
text: Matt trudges back for home when:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Please...please...

speaker_heading: MEAT PACKER
dialog: You gotta tell Fallon I need more time!
speaker_heading: THUG
dialog: You're all out of time.
text: Matt freezes at the voice.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Dad?
text: The Thug stops and turns to face us. A LONG BEAT before he
text: slowly slips his ski mask off to reveal...
text: JACK MURDOCK.
text: Matt shakes his head as tears come to his eyes. And then he
text: turns and runs off down the alley.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: MATT!
speaker_heading: ON MATT
text: Running out toward the loading docks, blinded by tears, his
text: father chasing behind him. BRAKES SCREECH as...
text: A TRUCK swerves to avoid him. Loaded with the same barrels
dialog: seen earlier. At the same time...
text: A FORKLIFT swerves as well, its forks up high. They tear
dialog: through the barrels as...
text: Matt looks up. Whitish fluid flies INTO CAMERA as we...
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
text: BLACKNESS .
text: We hear the sound of CHURCH BELLS RINGING. And as the sound
text: grows a ghostly SHADOW WORLD begins to take shape. A world
text: where sound isn’t just heard--but seen.
text: A BUS ROARS past us as the shadows collapse and distort into
text: a monstrous phantasm of visible vibration.
text: A HORN HONKS,. A CELL PHONE RINGS. A BABY CRIES. With each
text: noise our shadow world spills and pools, like liquid mercury.

speaker_heading: MATT (0.S.)
text: He turns to find Matt before the open window with his eyes

speaker_heading: MATT (cont'd)
dialog: Do you hear it?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What?
text: Matt turns to him.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Everything.
text: Jack shakes his head, trying to find some way to tell him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I talked to the doctor. He said--
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I’m blind. I know.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: But how--
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I could hear you talking in his office.
text: Jack looks back to where he was. Impossible.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT’D)
dialog: Something’s happening to me. I don’t
dialog: know what it is, but I’m not afraid.
text: Jack bows his head as the guilt washes over him.
speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: cuT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ROOF - DAY
text: Jack has turned the roof into a makeshift gymnasium. He
text: takes a few tentative swings at an old heavy bag while Matt
text: sits on a weight bench with a BRAILLE TEXT on his lap. The
text: agonizing process of learning to read all over again.
text: Jack sighs--it’s been too long. He turns from the bag just
text: as Matt SLAMS the book shut. They face each other. A BEAT.
text: Then Matt picks up the book. And Jack goes back to the bag.
text: Two fighters on the comeback trail.
speaker_heading: CuT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. ROOF - DAY
text: Matt is back at his braille book. A BREEZE picks up and the
text: SPEED BAG begins SQUEAKING on its chain. The sound is like
text: broken glass in his brain. Until Matt focuses all of his
text: anger and throws his book at the bag across the roof.
dialog: And nails it.
text: He walks over to the bag. And for the first time he doesn’t

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MATT'S POV
text: as the SQUEAKING slowly burns a silhouette through the

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY
text: Matt is back at the crosswalk. An OLD MAN steps off the curb

scene_heading: EXT. CITY - NIGHT
text: Matt stands in silhouette against the stars. He slowly

text: Matt does a cartwheel and the CAMERA ROLLS with him, taking
text: us on a dizzying, vertiginous ride as Matt goes faster and
text: faster before flipping onto TWO HEATING PIPES.
text: He SWINGS over them like a gymnast on parallel bars before
text: dismounting atop a brick smokestack. Matt smiles into the

speaker_heading: JACK

dialog: Wood, Mack, Chichester--they’re all my
dialog: fighters. Just like you.
text: Jack looks down as he realizes the truth.
speaker_heading: FALLON (CONT'D)
dialog: Now it’s your turn to take a fall.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What if I say “no?”
speaker_heading: FALLON
dialog: You know the answer to that. You used to

text: Fallon pats him on the shoulder.
speaker_heading: FALLON (CONT’D)
dialog: Think about your boy, Jack. I'm sure
dialog: you'll do the right thing.
text: He steps out as we STAY ON Jack’s devastated reaction.
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
text: THE FIGHT.
text: Palmiotti is easily fifteen years younger and light years

speaker_heading: MATT (0.S.)
dialog: C'MON, DAD! GET UP!
text: And then he sees his son as well. He struggles to his feet.
text: Palmiotti comes to finish him off. But in his haste he isn't

scene_heading: EXT. CIVIC CENTER - NIGHT
text: Matt waits out front for his father when his hyperacute
text: hearing picks up the sounds of violence. We hear the EXCITED

text: The CRACK of bone gives way to the PULPY sound of spit and
text: blood. Followed by the RASPY MOAN of his FATHER’S VOICE.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Dad...?
text: The sounds are suddenly overwhelmed by one THUNDEROUS BASS
text: HEARTBEAT. Then the DEATH BLOW. And the MOANING STOPS.

dialog: the halls. But today you can change all
dialog: that. Because today you are justice.
text: A petite but tough-looking girl is sitting beside Matt's
text: partner, FRANKLIN “FOGGY” NELSON.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: The criminal case against Quesada and
dialog: Smith was dismissed due to the arresting
dialog: officer's failure to read the defendants
dialog: their Miranda Rights. This civil suit is

dialog: (beat)
text: But Angela Sutton doesn’t seek damages.
text: She seeks the truth. She seeks justice.
dialog: And the chance to get on with her life.
speaker_heading: QUESADA

speaker_heading: QUESADA (CONT'D)
dialog: Angie was closing up and asked if we
dialog: wanted to stay and party after.
text: We PUSH CLOSER until we’re right up against Quesada’s chest.

speaker_heading: QUESADA (CONT’D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: A few drinks and she was good to go.
dialog: Said she wanted to take us both on.
text: The HEARTBEAT SKIPS. We suddenly PULL OUT of his chest and
text: WHIP ACROSS the room to Matt's reaction. Busted.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Mr. Quesada, you do understand that
dialog: perjury is a federal offense?
speaker_heading: QUESADA
dialog: Hey, I know what happened.

text: Quesada smiles, lecherous.

speaker_heading: FOGGY
dialog: Look, we knew it was a risk going in--
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Why? Because she’s from the Kitchen and
dialog: not the Upper East Side?
speaker_heading: FOGGY
dialog: Because she had a drug problem. Juries
dialog: don’t like their victims to be flawed.
dialog: They judged her past and not her case.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: How is she supposed to sleep at night
dialog: knowing that they‘re out there?
text: They stop and look out to the city together.
speaker_heading: FOGGY

speaker_heading: ON DAREDEVIL
text: LEAPING from rooftop to rooftop; his senses guiding him along
text: the way. He suddenly SWAN DIVES off of a ledge and PLUMMETS

dialog: accident took his sight. But it took his fear as well.
text: He shoots a 50-FOOT NYLON CORD from his billy club, catches

speaker_heading: QUESADA
dialog: (feeling no pain)

speaker_heading: QUESADA (CONT’D)
dialog: What are you gonna do about it?

speaker_heading: DAREDEVIL

dialog: This is not Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: as the lights over the billiard tables SWING BACK AND FORTH

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: FOGGY

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: FOGGY

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Only if it’s for a second.
speaker_heading: FOGGY
dialog: That whole love-at-first-sight thing?
dialog: Never happened to me. I always thought

dialog: What’s wrong with this headline, Urich?
dialog: It says New York Times! I let you chase
dialog: boogie men for six months and when they
dialog: actually turn out to be real you get
dialog: scooped by the Times?
speaker_heading: URICH
dialog: I was waiting for the facts. There’s no
dialog: real proof that Natchios was the Kingpin
dialog: or that Daredevil was the killer. That
dialog: story is premature.
speaker_heading: EDITOR
dialog: ‘Premature?' The Times outsold us today

scene_heading: INT. MATT'S APARTMENT ~ MORNING

speaker_heading: FOGGY (0.S.)
dialog: Matt? You home?
text: He POUNDS some more. Matt finally gets up and opens the door

dialog: What happened to you?
speaker_heading: MATT
text: Ran into a door.
text: Matt turns back inside as Foggy reacts.
speaker_heading: FOGGY
dialog: How many times?
text: Matt sits back at the table. Foggy sits across from him.
speaker_heading: FOGGY (CONT'D)
dialog: Guess what I found out?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: There is no Mark Welch.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Then you were right. It’s a dead end.
text: Foggy takes out the piece of paper that Matt used in Lisa
scene_heading: Tazio’s apartment. MARK WELCH 6301000.
speaker_heading: | FOGGY
dialog: It‘s not a name. It’s a hotel. Someone
dialog: named Welch was at The Mark. And that
dialog: phone number wasn’t a phone number...
text: Foggy puts a SLASH on the 630 and TWO DOTS onto the 1000.
text: Changing what looked like a phone number into: 6/30 10:00.
speaker_heading: FOGGY (CONT'D)
dialog: She didn't press hard enough for us to
dialog: read it. Lisa Tazio was meeting somebody
text: named Welch at ten o’clock at The Mark.
text: June 30th. The night she was murdered.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: It doesn’t prove anything.
text: Matt gets up and walks into the kitchen. He pours from a
dialog: specialized coffee maker for the blind (timed braille
text: buttons, burn protection) and pours himself a cup.
speaker_heading: FOGGY
dialog: But if you’re right and that’s the last
dialog: thing she wrote on the day of--

speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: What do I know about anything?
speaker_heading: FOGGY
dialog: You know about justice. All that talk
dialog: about making a difference? Sticking up
dialog: for the little guy? Well I‘1l be damed
dialog: if you don’t got me believing it.
text: Matt shakes his head.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I'm sorry. You're on your own today.
speaker_heading: FOGGY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: The funeral is this morning. It’s the
dialog: only way I can get to Elektra..
speaker_heading: FOGGY
dialog: I can’t do this by myself...
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You're a better lawyer than I am. You
dialog: just have to believe it for yourself.
speaker_heading: FOGGY
dialog: Iwill. But not today. Now come on.
dialog: Put on your lawyer clothes and let’s go.

text: Fisk leaves the bank of microphones and walks for the

speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: I don‘t understand, sir...
speaker_heading: FISK .
dialog: Better to appear loyal to a friend than
dialog: open-minded to his slander. Especially

speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Brilliant, sir.
speaker_heading: FISK
dialog: Wesley, if you must patronize me, at

speaker_heading: FISK
dialog: How did you get past security?
speaker_heading: ON BULLSEYE
text: sitting at his desk, holding a PENCIL in an electric

speaker_heading: BULLSEYE
dialog: You mean that guy?
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE

speaker_heading: BULLSEYE

text: Bullseye scowls.
speaker_heading: BULLSEYE

speaker_heading: FISK
dialog: Too much pride can kill a man.

speaker_heading: BULLSEYE
dialog: Tell your boys to stay out of Hell’s
dialog: Kitchen. Anybody gets in my way and

speaker_heading: FISK
dialog: Done. Anything else you need? Now that

speaker_heading: CORDOZA
dialog: Man, I was so wasted...it’s kind of hard

speaker_heading: CORDOZA
dialog: That’s right. Turk. I was going to meet
dialog: Turk. Cause he owed me some money.
speaker_heading: FOGGY
dialog: That's right. And you talked to Turk
text: outside of his apartment at 33rd, a block

text: Foggy wipes his perspiring forehead.
speaker_heading: CORDOZA

speaker_heading: FOGGY
dialog: Terrific and then you passed out.
speaker_heading: CORDOZA
dialog: Yeah. I woke up with this gun in my hand
text: and cops everywhere.
speaker_heading: FOGGY

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
