dialog: Hi Linda. How are you?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Ueuh. The funeral helped. I guess.
dialog: Just seeing him. I thought you

speaker_heading: RICHARD (ON PHONE)

text: background, is a slight man in a linen suit. Legs and arms
text: fold sharply, like a paper crane. Silent, listening.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: We are just going to reintroduce
dialog: ourselves as a formality, I'm
dialog: Detective Lieutenant Elliott, and
dialog: this is Trooper Wagner. Now, I'm
dialog: going to record, just makes it

dialog: Alright, we're with Linda Drysdale,
dialog: nee Thrombey, Harlan Thrombey's
dialog: eldest daughter, in discussing the

dialog: face?
speaker_heading: LINDA (V.O.)

dialog: housekeeper. Marta, Harlan's
dialog: caregiver, good girl, hard worker.
dialog: Family's from Ecuador. And Wanetta -
dialog: Greatnana, Harlan's mom.
text: At the snack table wearing a dozen coats, a woman who might

text: like a machine.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
dialog: (wow)
dialog: His mom? How old is she?
speaker_heading: LINDA (V.O.)
dialog: We have no idea.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
dialog: Okay, Your son Ransom, was he there
dialog: as well?
speaker_heading: LINDA (V.O.)
dialog: Yes but he left early.
text: RANSOM DRYSDALE, roguishly handsome in his early 30s,
text: breezes out the side door, past Greatnana.
speaker_heading: GREATNANA
dialog: Ransom, are you leaving?
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY
text: The strange man in the linen suit taps a piano key, as if
dialog: reminding to ask him something.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Right, did all three of you show up
dialog: at around the same time?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: N...0, Richard came early to help the
text: caterers set up.
text: She raises a questioning finger to ask about the man but
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Okay and you and your husband Richard
dialog: work for a real estate firm in
dialog: Boston?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: (sharp)
dialog: It's my company.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: (checks notes)
dialog: Sorry. Right.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I built my business from the ground
dialog: up.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Just like your dad. You two were very
dialog: close?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: We had our own secret way of
dialog: communicating. You had to find that
dialog: with dad. You had to find a game to
dialog: play with him. And if you did that,
dialog: and played by his rules...
text: CUT TO: Richard in the chair Linda was in, giving his
dialog: statement.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Everyone idolizes their dad, right?
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: I don't know, do they?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Very much not, don't know why I said
dialog: that. But Linda does.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
text: Harlan Thrombey, surrounded by his family, Richard and Linda
text: flanking him, a birthday cake with candles. All smiles.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (V.O.)
dialog: Harlan started with a rusty Smith-
dialog: Corona, built himself into one of the
dialog: bestselling mystery writers of all
dialog: time.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Seems like all his kids are self made
dialog: overachievers.
text: Richard makes a "...sure" face.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: WALT THROMBEY now sits in the questioning chair. Late 40s,
text: softly obsequious in a sweater and loafers. His leg is ina

scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: For the record, I'm speaking to Walt
dialog: Thrombey, Harlan Thrombey's youngest
dialog: son.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (cont'd)
dialog: So you run your father's publishing
dialog: company?
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Yeah. It's my - it's our, it's the
dialog: family's publishing company, dad
dialog: trusts me to run it. 30 languages,
dialog: over 80 million copies sold. A real
dialog: legacy. You guys fans?
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT TROOPER WAGNER
dialog: I don't do much fiction - BIG fan. Big.
speaker_heading: TROOPER WAGNER (cont'd)
dialog: His plots, like something like "A
dialog: Thousand Knives," with the - I don't
dialog: want to spoil it but - the cow and
dialog: the shotgun, like where do you come
dialog: up with that?
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Dad said the plots just popped into
dialog: his head fully formed, that was the
dialog: easy part for him -
text: TAP from the linen suit man's finger.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: You live in town, right? You guys
dialog: probably arrived at around the same
dialog: time?
text: Walt looks at Linen suit, thrown.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Uh. We all got here around 8.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
text: Walt laughing and mingling with his nervous wife DONNA.
speaker_heading: WALT (V.O.)
dialog: My wife Donna, she's my rock.
text: Richard backs up into Donna, who YELPS in fear and throws
text: her martini in the air. Richard jumps, but Walt doesn't
dialog: even register it.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Jeeesus! Donna, you alright?
speaker_heading: WALT (V.O.)
dialog: And my son Jacob, he's sixteen. Very
dialog: politically active.
dialog: 10.
text: His angry looking son JACOB, who is always on his phone.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY
text: Quick cuts, each in the chair:
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: The boy's literally a Nazi
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: He's an alt-right troll dipshit
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Kids today, with the internet,
dialog: amazing.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: So the night went well?
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
dialog: The exact same moment we saw with Richard and Linda of
text: Harlan in front of the birthday cake - but now it's Walt,
text: Donna and Jacob next to Harlan.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY
speaker_heading: WALT (V.O.)
dialog: I mean. We're all gutted but I'm
dialog: happy we got that night with him. To
dialog: be by his side, to think about our
dialog: books and what we've accomplished
dialog: with them, it's like I can still feel
text: his hand on my shoulder.
speaker_heading: WALT
text: Passing the torch.
text: Cut to: JONI THROMBEY in the chair. A striking woman, tall
text: and boho chic in chunky jewelry and a flowy dress.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: So we are with Joni Thrombey, Harlan
dialog: Thrombey's... daughter in law?
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Mm. I was married to his son Neil,
dialog: We had one daughter, Meg, and then
dialog: Neil passed on fifteen years ago.
dialog: 11.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: And you remained close to the
dialog: Thrombeys.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
text: Joni dances with various family members, free and flowing.
speaker_heading: JONI (V.0.)
dialog: Oh they're my family. I feel
dialog: simultaneously freed by and supported
dialog: by them, that balance of opposites is
dialog: the nugget of Flam.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY - PRESENT
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Sorry, the Nugget of?
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Flam.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Ah! Yeah Flam, right, your skin care
dialog: company. Sorry.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: I forgive you, yes, it's skin care
dialog: but it promotes a total lifestyle.
dialog: Self sufficiency with an
dialog: acknowledgment of human need. That's
dialog: Flam, but it's also Harlan. He got
dialog: me and Meg through some tough times.
text: Meg in the chair.
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: Granddad gives my mom a yearly
dialog: allowance, and he's never missed
dialog: wiring a tuition payment to my
dialog: schools. He's a genuinely selfless
dialog: man.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: You left his party early?
speaker_heading: MEG
text: To see some friends at Smith.
dialog: 12.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
text: Meg trots out. Linda, pissed, to Richard so Joni can hear:
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: you know, Dad's paying for her
dialog: crypto-Marxist postdeconstructual
dialog: feminist poetry theory whatever
dialog: major, she could have stuck around
dialog: for the cake.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: I think Linda was upset. But Harlan
dialog: understood.
dialog: Tap.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Right. You two arrived together to
dialog: the party at the same time?
text: Joni looks at the linen suit man.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: If I could - pause - because I, who
dialog: is that guy? And why are we doing
dialog: all this? Again?
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Just some follow up questions, just
dialog: being thorough, in order to determine
dialog: the manner of death.
text: Cut back to Walt in the chair.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: (almost laughing)
dialog: So by "manner of death" you mean if
dialog: he was killed. If one of us killed
dialog: him. One of his family?
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: None of us think that, this is pro
dialog: forma, all of it.
text: CUT TO: Richard in the chair. He doesn't buy it.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Ok. So who the fuck is that?
dialog: 13.
text: He points at linen suit. Elliott takes a breath.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: This is Benoit Blanc.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (the hell?)
dialog: Benoit Blanc?
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Yes. Mr. Blanc is a private
dialog: investigator of great renown.
text: Joni in the chair.
dialog: Linda in the
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Wait a minute - I read a tweet about
dialog: a New Yorker article about you. The
dialog: last of the gentlemen sleuths? You
dialog: solved that case with the tennis
dialog: champ - you're famous!
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Mr. Blanc is not with the police
dialog: department, he is not officially
text: involved with the case but he has
dialog: offered to consult. I happily obliged
dialog: and I can vouch for him.
dialog: chair.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Mr. Blanc, I know who you are, I
dialog: read your New Yorker profile. It was
dialog: delightful. I just buried my eighty
dialog: five year old father who committed
dialog: suicide. Why are you here?
text: Elliott and Wagner turn back to Blanc, who leans forward
dialog: slightly and
dialog: speaks in the gentlest southern lilt you have
dialog: ever heard in your life.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: I am here at the behest of a client.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: I cannot say, but let me assure you
dialog: this: my presence will be
dialog: ornamental.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: BLANC (cont'd)
dialog: You will find me a respectful, quiet,
dialog: passive observer. Of the truth.
text: Elliott and Wagner turn nervously back to Linda. She
text: doesn't look thrilled. Cut to Richard.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Fine. Are we getting there?
speaker_heading: BLANC
text: Nearly. Harlan's nurse. She was at
dialog: the party in a professional capacity?
text: Blanc begins idly playing with a silver dollar.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Marta?
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
text: The family is engaged in an animated discussion, Marta
text: standing on the outskirts.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (V.O.)
dialog: I guess. Harlan hired her to be
dialog: around, take care of whatever medical
dialog: needs pop up, but really she's like
dialog: part of the family.
text: Richard beckons with his cake, calls Marta into the
text: discussion, into the circle of the family.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (V.O.) (cont'd)
dialog: Good kid, been a good friend to
dialog: Harlan. Her family's from Paraguay.
dialog: Linda really likes her work ethic.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: “Immigrants - we get the job done."
dialog: From Hamilton.
text: Wagner gives him a smile to show he got the reference.
speaker_heading: TROOPER WAGNER
dialog: Oh Hamilton!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I saw it at the public.
dialog: 15.
text: Cut to Linda back in the chair.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: May I just - and then I'll recede,
dialog: but as a self made man myself I have
dialog: to express my admiration for how
dialog: you've followed in your father's
text: footsteps.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Just marvelous. The whole family too.
text: Joni with her things, Walt with his
dialog: publishing empire.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Well.
text: Blanc pauses. Doesn't push anything. Just waits a moment.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: Yes. I mean. Walt, yeah. He's done
dialog: well with what dad's given him.
dialog: Walt - not like it matters but he was
dialog: sort of adrift, dad gave him the job,
dialog: but really dad hands him a book twice
dialog: a year and Walt publishes it, I
dialog: mean... it's just not the same.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: But surely Walt runs the
dialog: merchandising, adaptations, film and
dialog: television rights...
text: Linda squints, narrowing her eyes on Blanc. Softly:
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Are you baiting me, Detective? You
dialog: know he doesn't, and you think I'm
dialog: dumb enough to be baited into talking
dialog: family business, into shit talking my
text: brother in front of a police
dialog: detective and a state trooper -
text: Richard in the chair.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Walt doesn't run shit! There are no
dialog: film or TV rights, Harlan's never
dialog: allowed any adaptations of his books.
dialog: Hates the idea.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Oh yeah! Drives Walt nuts, cause
dialog: that's where the real money's at.
dialog: When he gets a little Irish courage
dialog: in him he'll get into it with Harlan.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Did he get “into it" at the party?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Oh my god.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
text: Walt with a drink in his hand has cornered Harlan. Richard
text: watches across the room as Walt goes from arguing to
dialog: pleading.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (V.O.)
dialog: He wouldn't leave him alone, poor
dialog: guy. Harlan had to give him the
dialog: hook.
text: Harlan has had enough, he takes Walt's arm and leads him
text: into the drawing room for a private talk.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (V.O.) (cont'd)
dialog: I didn't hear what he said but he
dialog: must have really handed him his
text: lunch, Walt was like a wounded puppy
text: the rest of the night.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY
text: Walt in the chair, indignant.
speaker_heading: WALT BLANC
dialog: What? Richard said what?
dialog: Jesus. No, we didn't get I'm just trying to get an
dialog: “into it." accurate impression - Harlan
dialog: took you aside at the party,
dialog: when you returned you were
dialog: chastened, what did Harlan
dialog: say to you?
text: Walt starts to open his mouth, hesitates. Off his
text: frightened face we FLASH BACK:
scene_heading: INT. DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
text: Walt, drunk, Harlan guiding him firmly into the shadows.
speaker_heading: WALT HARLAN
dialog: The Netflix guys, their
dialog: business affairs guy sent
dialog: over something, hard numbers
dialog: this time, and I think -
dialog: this is a window, it's not Walt.
dialog: going to last and you should
dialog: just look at these numbers
dialog: Walt.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Dad you put me in charge of our books
dialog: let me be in charge, let me do this!
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: They're not our books, son. They're
dialog: my books. And this is not how I
dialog: wanted to have this conversation but,
dialog: you're right, it's unfair of me to
dialog: keep you tethered to something that
dialog: isn't yours to control.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: I've done you a grave disservice all
dialog: these years, I've kept you from
dialog: building something of your own,
dialog: that's yours. You're not going to
dialog: run the publishing house anymore. You
dialog: are free of it.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Dad. Are you firing me?
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: We'll talk about details tomorrow.
dialog: But my mind's made up. Good boy.
text: Harlan pats his face, then leaves him shell shocked.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY
text: Back to Walt's hesitating face. The briefest of moments has
dialog: passed. Walt lies:
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: We talked, we had a business
dialog: discussion, about e-books, Jesus, it
dialog: was nothing. You want to talk about
dialog: an argument, hell Ransom had an
text: argument with him.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Ransom, Richard and Linda's son?
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Look we love Ransom, he is a good
dialog: kid, we love him.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: -.-but
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: But he's always been the black sheep
dialog: of the family, and I'm not, I, I keep
dialog: stuff like this in the family, but
dialog: with Ransom, he's never had a job.
dialog: But dad for some unknown reason has
dialog: always supported him, they've got
text: this love hate bond. They fight.
dialog: But that night, god. They had a blow
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: About what?
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
text: The family having a conversation, everyone but Harlan, Jacob
dialog: and Ransom.
text: It grinds to a halt as through the door to
text: Harlan's study indistinct shouting booms.
speaker_heading: WALT (V.O.)
dialog: We couldn't make it out, but it was
dialog: huge. And it was strange they went
dialog: in another room to do it - they
dialog: usually love stoking up drama in
text: front of the whole family.
text: Ransom bursts out of the doors and storms out of the party,
text: past Greatnana.
speaker_heading: GREATNANA
dialog: Ransom are you leaving?
dialog: 19.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY
text: Richard in the chair.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Speaking of getting into it, you were
text: at the house early to help the
dialog: caterer set up. Did you converse
dialog: with Harlan at that time?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: He was there, we must have spoke.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: In his study?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: You see, I spoke with the caterer
dialog: this morning. She didn't see you
text: helping her staff, but she did hear
text: Harlan in a screaming match with
text: someone that afternoon. In his study.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I don't, a screaming match? No.
dialog: Joni was here too, she was early,
dialog: maybe it was her, ask her.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: These were two male voices.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY OF PARTY
text: A CATERER walks through with a platter. Pauses, hears
text: shouting through the wall.
speaker_heading: BLANC (V.O.)
dialog: Harlan shouted the phrase
speaker_heading: HARLAN (0.S.)
dialog: .»..you tell her or I will!
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: You tell her. Or I will. Bells
dialog: ringing?
dialog: 20.
text: For a just a split second, Richard considers what he is
text: going to say. In the second, we FLASH BACK:
scene_heading: INT. SMALL STUDY - DAY OF PARTY
text: Harlan showing Richard photos on a laptop. Long lens
text: photos, of Richard kissing a woman who is not Linda.
text: Richard glares at it, Harlan turns an old baseball over in
text: his hands.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: That's none of your business, Harlan.
dialog: Stay out of my marriage.
text: Harlan holds up a sealed small envelope with flowery
text: embroidery, "L" written on the front.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: I know my daughter. She'd want to
dialog: know. I've put it all in this letter
dialog: to her, tomorrow she gets it.
speaker_heading: RICHARD HARLAN
dialog: I'm warning you once, don't She deserves to know, you're
dialog: do this like hell - going to tell her!
text: Harlan slams the baseball down on the desk.
speaker_heading: HARLAN (cont'd)
dialog: You tell her or I will!
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY
text: Back to Richard. He grins, snaps his fingers.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Yes. I know - yes, ha. So. Harlan
dialog: decided to finally put his mom ina
dialog: nursing home. Which Linda always
dialog: opposed. And I was going to wait
dialog: till we were back home in Boston to
dialog: tell her, so there wouldn't be a
dialog: whole scene, but Harlan wanted me to
dialog: tell her then. That was it. Sorry.
dialog: Forgot.
text: Joni in the chair.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: The house?
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Early. Richard said you were there.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: I was. At the house early.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: To see Harlan?
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: To see Harlan. Yes.
text: Joni stops, smelling something in the air. She's about to
dialog: ask about it but -
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: What were you seeing Harlan about?
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: It was just a mix up with the payment
dialog: for Meg's tuition.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: I'm sorry to press, what kind of mix
dialog: up?
text: Joni hesitates, we FLASH BACK:
scene_heading: INT. SMALL STUDY - DAY OF PARTY
text: Harlan at his desk, toying with the same old baseball. This
text: is a thing he does at his desk. Joni standing, arms crossed.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: The school hasn't got the check yet,
dialog: I don't know why Alan didn't mail it
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: Alan didn't mail it because he caught
text: a discrepancy. Alan's office has
dialog: been wiring tuition directly to the
dialog: school, as per your request. But
dialog: Phyllis's office that handles your
dialog: yearly allowance has been wiring the
dialog: tuition money directly to you as
dialog: well. As per your request. You've
dialog: been double dipping Meg's tuition,
dialog: stealing from me. A hundred thousand
dialog: dollars a year. For the past four
dialog: years.
dialog: 22.
text: Harlan shows Joni a letter from his business manager, with
dialog: transaction receipts attached.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Harlan. I don't know how this mix up
dialog: happened but
text: Harlan opens his ledger, hand writes a check.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: I'm writing this tuition check, then
dialog: that is the last money you or Meg
dialog: will get from me.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Please you don't understand
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: I know it'1l hurt but it's for the
dialog: best.
text: Joni's speechless, her face frozen. Harlan puts the
text: baseball down and detaches the check, holds it out to her.
speaker_heading: HARLAN (cont'd)
dialog: My mind's made up.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY
text: Back to Joni. She shakes her head.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Just a money wiring issue. With the
dialog: office at the school. So I had to
dialog: ask Harlan to cut a check for this
dialog: semester. No big deal.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Why don't we take a breather.
scene_heading: INT. FOYER - DAY
text: Joni comes out into the foyer from the library, obviously
text: rattled. She pulls it together quick when Linda comes down
dialog: the stairs.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Joni. You haven't seen Richard have
dialog: you?
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: No, I was just in with the - no.
scene_heading: INT. SMALL STUDY
speaker_heading: LINDA (0.S.)
dialog: Richard!
text: Alone, Richard waits very still for Linda's footsteps to
text: walk away, then when he knows she's not coming in he
text: furtively rifles through desk drawers, finding various
text: ridiculous ephemera. He finds a small locked drawer,
text: jimmies it open with a letter opener.
text: Inside - the small pink envelope Harlan threatened him with
text: in his flashback. He rips it open, pulls out the card
dialog: inside.
text: It is blank.
text: Richard almost laughs. Drops it onto the desk.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Son of a bitch.
text: He spots Harlan's old baseball. Grabs it, spitefully chucks
text: it out the open window.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE OF HOUSE - DAY
text: Blanc, Elliott and Wagner stroll long the wide lawn beside
text: the house. Blanc ignites a long thin cigar.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Maybe I'm a victim of my own
dialog: expectations. But when the great
dialog: Benoit Blanc knocks on my door, I
dialog: expect it's going to be for
dialog: something... if not extraordinary,
dialog: at least interesting. This is an
text: open and shut case of suicide.
dialog: (checks watch)
dialog: And Benny we're at the point where I
dialog: need to know what we're doing here.
text: Blanc notices the OLD BASEBALL lying in the grass. He picks
text: it up idly.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: The method, throat slit. Typical of
dialog: a suicide?
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Dramatic. But look around. The guy
text: practically lives in a CLUE board.
scene_heading: INT. FOYER
text: Marta sits alone, across from a portrait of Harlan. Muffled
text: voices out on the patio. Cigar smoke drifts by outside.
text: She creeps over to the glass door. Puts her ear to it.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (0.S.)
dialog: You ask me to drag all these good
dialog: people back for questioning, go over
dialog: it all again, I don't get it. This
dialog: is a pleasant family with the usual
dialog: quarrels but no possible motives for
dialog: murder - where are you going?
text: At that moment, BLANC's face appears right next to Marta's
text: staring right at her through the distorted glass. She yelps
text: and falls back.
scene_heading: EXT. PATIO
text: Blanc opens the glass door. Marta steps back sheepishly,
text: but with a warm nod Blanc beckons for her to join them.
speaker_heading: BLANC
text: Harlan Thrombey's nurse, Marta...
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: ...Cabrera
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Marta Cabrera.
speaker_heading: TROOPER WAGNER
dialog: Miss Cabrera, you can just wait
dialog: inside - we'll be with you soon.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Miss Cabrera, I been doing a little
dialog: poking, you're hired on a part time
dialog: basis as a registered nurse, yes?
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Yeah, I don't work for a VNA. Harlan
dialog: hired me directly.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: You're paid a flat rate for how many
dialog: hours a week?
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: I started at 15, but slowly he...
dialog: needed more help.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Medical help?
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: He needed a friend.
text: Blanc smiles at the girl, genuinely touched.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Does having a kind heart make you a
dialog: good nurse?
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Blanc.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Yes. Marta we were just discussing
dialog: possible motives in the family. I
dialog: suspect Harlan has told you much
text: unfiltered truth about each of them,
dialog: and a little bird has told me, how
dialog: shall I put this delicately? You have
dialog: a regurgitive reaction to
dialog: mistruthin'.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Who told you that?
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Is it true?
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Yes. It's something that I have had
dialog: as a kid. It's a physically thing
dialog: that I - I - Just the thought of
dialog: lying, yeah, it makes me puke.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Really? Is Richard having an affair?
text: Marta is stunned. She FLASHES BACK TO:
dialog: 26.
scene_heading: EXT. PATIO - DAY - FLASHBACK
text: She reads, Harlan sits at his laptop, heavy with sadness.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: Why do men instinctively pull at
dialog: loose threads on their parachutes?
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: What?
text: Harlan spins his laptop towards her - the Richard photos.
scene_heading: EXT. PATIO - DAY
text: Back to our scene. Marta looks queasy, tries to stall.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Heh - Richard? - affair? Heh.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: A yes or no will do.
text: She struggles, her jaw clenched, face working hard, then
dialog: attempts -
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: sees no
text: And immediately VOMITS into a nearby planter.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT TROOPER WAGNER
dialog: Whoa! Oh my god!
text: They all rush to her, Blanc brings water, awfully concerned.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Dear girl I'm sorry. I assumed you
dialog: were speaking figuratively.
text: Blanc takes the shortest acceptable beat of concern before
text: turning to Elliott.
speaker_heading: BLANC (cont'd)
dialog: Quite something. But I was obviously
dialog: right, Richard is having an affair,
dialog: his father in law found out and
dialog: confronted him. "You tell her. Or I
dialog: will."
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Even if it's true... you ok?
dialog: 27.
text: Marta gives a weak thumbs up, recovering
speaker_heading: ELLIOTT
dialog: Even if that was right, protecting
dialog: his marriage is weak sauce as a
dialog: motive.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Well. And then there is... Joni.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT TROOPER WAGNER
dialog: Joni? Joni?!
speaker_heading: TROOPER WAGNER (cont'd)
dialog: Lifestyle guru Joni? No. Harlan was
text: supporting her and her daughter, she
dialog: had the opposite of a motive.
text: Marta tries to quietly slip back into the house
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: And if that support was threatened?
dialog: Miss Cabrera one moment please
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: I'm just going to go get some Scope
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Miss Cabrera, was Harlan planning on
dialog: cutting off Joni's allowance?
text: Off Marta's "oh god no" face:
scene_heading: INT. STUDY - DAY - FLASHBACK
text: Harlan looking at the letter from his business manager, with
text: the transaction receipts. He sighs heavily.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: Oh, Joni.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: What's up?
text: He hands her the letter.
scene_heading: EXT. PATIO - DAY
text: Marta's face works against impending nausea.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: I...
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Ok don't answer that if you're going
dialog: to puke. Please.
text: But Blanc presses.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Meg said Harlan pays the school
dialog: directly, Joni says he sends the
dialog: money to her. Both were true, she
dialog: was pocketing the double payment,
dialog: Harlan found out and cut her off
dialog: without a cent. Yes?
text: Marta starts to shake her head no, but her throat convulses.
text: She nods. Blanc hands her a glass of water.
speaker_heading: TROOPER WAGNER
text: And she bumps him off for the
dialog: inheritance? Come. On! Have you
dialog: seen her insta? She's an influencer.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: An allowance as a motive, Blanc. She
text: has her business. More weak sauce.
text: Blanc idly scratches a spot on the side of his neck.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Granted. But she lied. To me. All
dialog: three of them did.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Three?
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Walter.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: I see where you are going with this.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: But there was something else. Harlan
dialog: had turned Walter down before
dialog: regarding film rights, but that night
dialog: something Harlan said shook him. We
dialog: look at the pattern, Harlan was
dialog: cleaning house. I wonder...
dialog: (to Marta)
dialog: did he plan to fire Walter?
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: (honest & relieved)
dialog: Can I wait inside? I don't feel like
dialog: I should be here.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Yes, please just wait inside but stay
dialog: close.
text: She steps back in, grateful. Blanc to Elliott:
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: You've been very patient my friend,
dialog: and you are right, none of these weak
text: alibis and domestic squibbles answer
dialog: your question: why is Benoit Blanc
dialog: here? But now I will tell you why.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I am here because this morning
dialog: someone dodged one very important
dialog: question.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Me. Linda asked who hired me.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: So who hired you?
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: I. Do. Not. Know. An envelope of
dialog: cash showed up at my apartment
dialog: yesterday, with the news clipping of
text: Thrombey's death.
speaker_heading: TROOPER WAGNER
dialog: An envelope? That worked?
speaker_heading: BLANC
text: An envelope of cash.
text: Blanc indicates with his fingers - several inches thick.
speaker_heading: BLANC (cont'd)
dialog: So somebody suspects foul play, but
dialog: goes through this ha cha dance of
dialog: hiring me, of staying anonymous. It
dialog: makes no damn sense. Compels me
dialog: though.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: BLANC (cont'd)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Walk me through everyone's
text: whereabouts at the time of death.
text: Elliott hesitates, but Blanc's got him hooked. He flips
text: open his notebook. Blanc leans back, closes his eyes.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: We know, the party broke up at 11:30.
scene_heading: INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT OF PARTY
text: Marta and Harlan vanish up the stairs towards the third
text: floor, while Richard and Linda head into the bedroom right
text: next to the stairs. Down the hallway Joni waves, and ducks
text: into another bedroom.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
dialog: Marta took Harlan upstairs to give
dialog: him his meds, Richard and Linda and
dialog: Joni went right to bed. Now we do
dialog: have this: the stairs leading up to
text: Harlan's bedroom and his attic office
text: creak horribly.
scene_heading: INT. RICHARD AND LINDA'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
text: Richard sleeps deep, Linda sleeps lightly.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
dialog: And Linda is a light sleeper. So we
dialog: know every time someone took the
dialog: stairs that night.
scene_heading: INT. JONI AND MEG'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT OF PARTY
text: Joni has decorated the room with colorful silks and candles.
text: She is in lotus position on her bed, meditating.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
dialog: The first was when Joni heard a ka-
text: THUNK from somewhere above her in the
dialog: house.
text: Ka-THUNK! Joni looks up at the ceiling.
scene_heading: INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT OF PARTY
text: Joni trots down the hall and up the creaky stairs.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
dialog: She's concerned about Harlan, she
text: went up to investigate. Waking
dialog: Linda.
scene_heading: INT. RICHARD AND LINDA'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT OF PARTY
text: CREAK CREAK CREAK! From outside. Linda's eyes pop open.
scene_heading: INT. THIRD FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT OF PARTY
text: Joni knocks on the door of Harlan's attic office. It opens,
text: and Harlan answers. In the room behind him we see Marta,
text: her back turned, preparing a hypo needle.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
text: Harlan was in his attic office with
dialog: Marta. He explained that they had
dialog: just knocked the GO board over - that
dialog: game with the grid and stones, they
dialog: play it every night, and he was fine,
text: go to bed. So she does.
text: The spilled GO board on the floor. Joni kisses Harlan on
text: the cheek, goes. He shuts the door.
scene_heading: INT. RICHARD AND LINDA'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT OF PARTY
text: Linda has just gotten back to sleep.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
text: Ten minutes later, Linda is woken a
text: second time, by Marta leaving.
text: CREAK CREAK CREAK! Linda wakes, supremely annoyed.
speaker_heading: MARTA (0.S.)
dialog: Walt! I'm leaving!
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT OF PARTY
text: Walt and Jacob sit on the porch, Walt with a cigar, Jacob
text: with his phone. Marta trots through, saying goodbye.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
text: Walt was smoking a cigar on the porch
text: with his son. He saw her leave and
dialog: drive off, and noted the time -
dialog: midnight.
dialog: 32.
text: Walt glances at his watch. Midnight.
scene_heading: INT. RICHARD AND LINDA'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT OF PARTY
text: Linda with a pillow over her head.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
text: Fifteen minutes later, Linda is woken
dialog: for the third and final time. By
text: someone coming down the stairs.
text: CREAK CREAK CREAK! Linda wakes. You've gotta be kidding me.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT OF PARTY
text: Walt, still smoking with Jacob, spots Harlan through the
text: glazed glass, coming down the stairs in the foyer.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
dialog: Harlan. Who came down for midnight
dialog: snacks, which Walt tried to
dialog: discourage.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Dad, go to bed!
text: Through the glazed glass, Harlan goes back up the stairs.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
dialog: Based on this, the medical examiner
dialog: determined time of death to be
dialog: between 12:15 and 2am. As Walt was
text: finishing his cigar, about 12:30, Meg
text: came home. She went straight to bed.
dialog: Walt and Jacob turned in shortly
dialog: after that.
text: Meg pulls up, trots past Walt and Jacob and inside.
scene_heading: INT. JONI AND MEG'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT OF PARTY
text: Meg stirs, wakes. Joni is asleep.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
dialog: Sometime later that night,
text: undetermined but possibly near 3am,
dialog: Meg woke up because the dogs were
text: barking outside. She used the
text: bathroom and went back to bed.
dialog: 33.
scene_heading: EXT. PATIO - DAY
text: Elliott snaps the notebook closed.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: And that's it. Everyone's stories
dialog: matched, every movement accounted
dialog: for.
speaker_heading: BLANC
text: There is no other staircase up to
dialog: Harlan's room?
text: Blanc scratches that same spot on the side of his neck.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: No. Just the creaky one.
text: Blanc seems intrigued by this.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Interesting.
speaker_heading: TROOPER WAGNER
dialog: So I guess we can rule out Ransom, he
dialog: wasn't there. And Marta, Harlan was
text: alive after she left. But Meg got
text: home during the time of death window.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Except it was a suicide. Harlan hit
dialog: both carotids, we saw from the blood
dialog: blood splat patterns that they were
dialog: uninterrupted. Meaning, It's almost
dialog: impossible for anyone to have been
dialog: around him at the time. He's the one
dialog: that cut his own throat. I don't know
dialog: why we keep going over this.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Physical evidence can tell a clear
text: story with a forked tongue.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: And as we've seen this morning,
dialog: everyone can lie. Well. Almost
dialog: everyone.
dialog: 34.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Marta in the chair. She shifts, uncomfortable.
text: Blanc, Elliott and Wagner in their normal places.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Ms. Cabrera, we've kept you waiting
dialog: all afternoon because I wanted to
dialog: hear from you last. I wanted to have
text: the entire picture of the evening in
dialog: my head. Your piece of it is at its
dialog: very center. So please, take your
dialog: time. You took Mr. Thrombey upstairs
text: at 11:30. And left at midnight.
dialog: Think very carefully. And with as
dialog: much detail as possible, tell us what
dialog: happened in that half hour.
text: Marta is very still. A moment of silence. Blanc flips his
text: silver dollar into the air.
text: She does not say a word, but in that moment while the coin
text: hangs in the air we FLASH BACK with her to:
scene_heading: INT. HARLAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
text: The night of the party. A clock on a nightstand: 11:32.
text: Off screen we hear Marta leading Harlan up the creaky
dialog: stairs.
speaker_heading: MARTA HARLAN
dialog: Up up up up - you got it? I got it. Up up up I got
dialog: it.
text: Marta enters the room, and behind her we see Harlan keep
text: climbing up the narrow stairs to his office.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Up up nooooo no not tonight, no
dialog: straight to bed tonight it is soooo
dialog: late c'mon. Harlan. Harlan!
text: She grabs a med kit from the bedroom and follows him,
text: exasperated.
scene_heading: INT. HARLAN THROMBEY'S STUDY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
text: Harlan sits, setting up a GO board. Marta enters.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: MARTA HARLAN
dialog: It's late, I had champagne It's my birthday, we are -
dialog: no no no You had one glass - we're
dialog: not breaking tradition on my
dialog: birthday.
text: Marta puts two vials and a pill box on the GO board. She
text: pulls out two plastic wrapped hypodermics.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Take your goddamn medicine and go to
dialog: bed.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: If you're going to put that vile shit
dialog: in me you will have to earn it. On
dialog: my birthday.
dialog: (playing it up)
dialog: Eighty fifth. So old. Soo olddd
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Alright old man. 8x8 game. You
dialog: ready?
text: She sits and they start clacking white and black stones on
dialog: the board.
speaker_heading: HARLAN MARTA
dialog: Why can't I beat you at this
dialog: game? Because I'm not playing to
dialog: beat you, I'm playing to
dialog: Oh uh huh. build a beautiful pattern.
text: They play fast, and Marta is obviously winning.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: Elder abuse. I'm calling the AARP.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Don't make me get the belt.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: It's basically over. My only hope is
dialog: that an earthquake will strike. But
dialog: what are the chances -
text: Harlan starts shaking the table with his knee. He looks
text: around, startled. Marta just stares at him, deadpan.
speaker_heading: HARLAN (cont'd)
dialog: Get under a door frame!
dialog: 36.
text: He tips the whole table and the GO board and med vials and
text: syringe and med kit fall to the soft rug. Things spill out
text: of the kit. A mess. Marta just shakes her head.
speaker_heading: MARTA
text: Meds then beds.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: Fair.
text: She retrieves the vials and loads a syringe from one of
text: them. Harlan rolls up his sleeve revealing a pre-inserted
text: catheter. He crosses to close the room's only small window.
speaker_heading: HARLAN (cont'd)
text: Ugh, Walt's smoking a cigar on the
dialog: porch. Nasty things.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: How was tonight?
text: She hooks the syringe up to the catheter and slowly injects
text: him bit by bit while he talks.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: Tonight was... good.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Because I know you weren't looking
dialog: forward to it.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: No. But I did it. Cut the line on
dialog: all four of them. It was not easy.
dialog: This goddamn fortune. Sometimes I
dialog: think, everything I've given my
dialog: family, I've done, maybe without
dialog: knowing it, maybe, to keep them
dialog: beneath me. I should have what...
dialog: maybe, I don't know. Encouraged Walt
dialog: to write his own stories, not just be
dialog: a caretaker of mine. Like you said I
dialog: should. Been a father, not just a
dialog: provider, to Joni. Like you've also
dialog: said. I should have been kinder to
dialog: Linda. And Ransom.
text: Harlan takes a curved ornamental dagger from a display
text: mount, turns it over in his hands.
speaker_heading: HARLAN (cont'd)
dialog: Jesus there's so much me in that kid.
dialog: Confident, stupid, I dunno.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: HARLAN (cont'd)
dialog: Protected. Playing life like a game
dialog: without consequence, till you can't
dialog: tell the difference between a stage
text: prop and a real knife.
text: He stabs it into the desk, sharp and real. Leaves it there.
speaker_heading: HARLAN (cont'd)
dialog: I don't fear death. But god I'd like
dialog: to fix some of this before I go.
dialog: Close the book with a flourish. I
dialog: guess we'll see.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: I guess we will. Hey. Old man.
dialog: You've had a long day. Wanna do
dialog: drugs.
text: She loads the second syringe from the second vial.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: you mean the good stuff?
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Yeah but just a tiny bit.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: Send me to lala land. Why did I wait
dialog: till my mid eighties to become a
dialog: morphine user, what a schmuck, what a
dialog: nud-nig, this stuff's the best.
text: She pulls the needle from the second vial... then sees the
text: label. Freezes. Blinks at it.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Oh my god.
text: She snatches up the first vial she just injected him from.
dialog: Compares the label to the one she just picked up. They're
dialog: similar but not the same.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: Is there a problem?
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: This is what I just gave you 100
dialog: milligrams of. But I messed up.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: You gave me 100 milligrams of the
dialog: good stuff.
dialog: 38.
text: She immediately pulls an EMERGENCY KIT from a nearby shelf,
text: starts calmly but quickly going through its contents.
speaker_heading: HARLAN (cont'd)
dialog: What's the good stuff dosage supposed
dialog: to be?
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Lets not call it that right now -
dialog: three milligrams.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: That's much less. So what happens?
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: I give you an emergency shot of
dialog: Naloxone, so that you don't die in
dialog: ten minutes.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: Well no pressure. You know that's an
dialog: interesting, efficient method for
dialog: murder, I need to write that down.
text: He gets a little notebook and scribbles while she checks and
text: rechecks the kit contents with increasing urgency.
speaker_heading: HARLAN (cont'd)
dialog: So if someone switched the meds on
dialog: purpose I'd be dead in ten minutes,
dialog: like stone cold dead?
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: You'll feel symptoms in five. Sweats,
dialog: disorientation. Then yeah, that big
dialog: a dose, injected, within ten your
dialog: respiratory - your - yes ten minutes.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: From the time of injection, so
dialog: eightish now. And even if the victim
dialog: called an ambulance when he first
dialog: felt symptoms, if he was at a country
dialog: home like this one... where the
dialog: ambulance takes fifteen minutes to
dialog: arrive, it would be too late. If the
dialog: victim didn't have this emergency
dialog: Naxostuff.
text: He watches her. She's now digging around the carpet,
text: looking under the couch. She dumps the entire contents of
text: the kit out and is now frantically going through it. A bead
text: of sweat rolls down Harlan's brow.
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: HARLAN (cont'd)
dialog: Marta. Do you have Naxostuff?
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Yes! Naloxone yes it comes with the
dialog: emergency kit - it should be here,
dialog: it's - fuck. No Harlan it's not
dialog: here. It's not. Oh my god.
text: They look at each other for a second. She's panicked. He's
dialog: thinking.
speaker_heading: MARTA (cont'd)
dialog: Where's my phone? Shit -
text: She picks up a landline phone on the table, dials 911 with
dialog: shaking hands -
text: Before it can even ring, the line goes dead.
text: She looks, unbelieving: Harlan's finger is on the cradle.
text: His eyes are locked with hers, serious and certain.
speaker_heading: MARTA (cont'd)
dialog: Harlan what are you doing?
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: Marta, listen to me.
speaker_heading: MARTA HARLAN
dialog: Harlan we need to - are you Stop. Stop stop, Marta
dialog: crazy, we need to call, they listen there isn't time stop
dialog: need to get here I need to - now stop
text: She goes for her cell phone across the room and Harlan stops
text: her - they trip and fall to the ground with a KA-THUNK.
speaker_heading: MARTA HARLAN
dialog: What are you doing are you Marta it's too late it is
dialog: nuts? over, it's too late I am
text: dead listen. LISTEN.
text: He actually puts his hand over her mouth.
speaker_heading: HARLAN (cont'd)
dialog: Listen. If what you said is true I
dialog: am gone, there's no saving me, we
dialog: have six minutes. There is one last
dialog: thing I need to do in this world, and
dialog: only you can help me do it. But you
dialog: need to trust me and do everything I
dialog: say.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: What do you want to do?
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: Get you out of this. Think of your
dialog: mom - please trust me, we have to
dialog: 40.
dialog: make this look ironclad like it can't
dialog: have been your fault. You. Can't.
dialog: Have done this.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: My mom...?
text: CREAK on the stairs outside.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: Get up.
text: A knock on the door.
speaker_heading: JONI (0.S.)
dialog: Harlan? Marta? Everything alright?
text: Harlan and Marta stand. She's dazed, deer in the
text: headlights, but he's focused and sharp. He turns
text: from the door.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: Stand here, keep your back to me,
dialog: don't say a word.
text: Harlan opens the door. While he gets rid of Joni
text: with Marta, who stands stock still, tears running
text: face, eyes wild - what does she do?
speaker_heading: HARLAN (cont'd)
dialog: Joni.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: I - hi - I heard something, is
dialog: everything ok?
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: Oh yes we just, I just knocked over
dialog: the GO board, sorry about that.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Everything's alright?
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: Yes yes all fine, go to bed Joni.
dialog: her away
dialog: we stick
dialog: down her
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Ok. And maybe we can talk tomorrow
dialog: about the, uh, the thing with
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: Yes. Tomorrow.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Love you, Night.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: Night night.
text: Harlan shuts the door. Looks at the knife still sticking in
text: the desk. Then takes Marta's shoulders, looks in her eyes.
speaker_heading: HARLAN (cont'd)
dialog: Pay attention now, your mom is still
dialog: undocumented, if this is your fault
dialog: she'll be found out and at best
dialog: deported, your family will be broken.
text: A new kind of fear in Marta's eyes.
speaker_heading: MARTA HARLAN
dialog: Oh god But we're not going to let
dialog: that happen. I have a plan,
dialog: it's not going to be easy
dialog: but you have to do exactly
dialog: what I tell you. Will you
dialog: do this Marta? This last
dialog: thing. For me, and for your
dialog: family.
text: She's terrified. But she nods.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: What do you want me to do?
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT OF THE PARTY - FLASHBACK
text: Walt smoking and Jacob.
speaker_heading: HARLAN (V.O.)
dialog: Go downstairs as noisily as you can,
text: say goodbye loudly.
speaker_heading: MARTA (0.S.)
dialog: Walt! I'm leaving!
text: Marta exits quickly, down to her car.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: HARLAN (V.O.)

scene_heading: CAR - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
text: She drives out the guard gate and down the private road.
dialog: Up ahead - a

text: BEFORE the carved elephant.
text: weathered wood carved elephant statue.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Wait... was it before or after?
speaker_heading: HARLAN (V.O.)
text: AFTER the carved elephant.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: No, he said - before? Was it?
speaker_heading: HARLAN (V.O.)

speaker_heading: MARTA

scene_heading: EXT. WOODS -
scene_heading: NIGHT - FLASHBACK
text: Marta trudges away from the parked car, tree branches

speaker_heading: HARLAN (V.O.)
text: Park and come back on foot up to the
dialog: house,
dialog: 43.
scene_heading: EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE GATE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
text: A waist-high stone wall with a little pedestrian gate. The
text: house up ahead. Marta goes through the gate and up towards
dialog: the house.
speaker_heading: HARLAN (V.O.)
dialog: Take the side yard path, through that
dialog: little gate.
text: The DOGS sprint down the moonlit yard from the house towards
dialog: Marta.
speaker_heading: HARLAN (V.O.) (cont'd)
dialog: The dogs will know you, they
dialog: shouldn't bark.
text: The dogs stop at Marta and lick her hand.
scene_heading: EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE YARD - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
text: Marta looks up the side of the looming house. A sturdy
text: trellis on the wall, and high above a third story window.
speaker_heading: HARLAN (V.O.)
dialog: You've got to get up to the third
dialog: floor without being seen, and the
dialog: only way is to climb the side trellis
dialog: and come in through the trick hall
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: You've gotta be kidding me.
speaker_heading: HARLAN (V.O.)
dialog: I am not. Do it.
text: Cut to: moments later, Marta climbing the trellis. It's
text: easy going until a piece BREAKS under her foot, and she
text: swings for a second by one hand.
speaker_heading: HARLAN (V.O.) (cont'd)
dialog: And for godssakes don't make any
dialog: noise.
scene_heading: INT. THIRD FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
text: What appears to be a dead end hallway, with a painting at
text: the end. BUT suddenly the end wall swings away like a door,
text: revealing a WINDOW behind it. Marta heaves her way in
text: through it, and steps lightly into Harlan's bedroom.
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: HARLAN (V.O.)
dialog: Once you're inside, this is the
dialog: tricky part.
speaker_heading: MARTA (V.O.)
dialog: THIS is the tricky part?
scene_heading: INT. HARLAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
speaker_heading: HARLAN (V.O.)
dialog: Get my robe and cap from my bedroom.
dialog: And put them on.
text: She picks them up from the bed. Stops. A moment of doubt.
scene_heading: INT. HARLAN THROMBEY'S STUDY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
text: Back to the scene with Harlan. Marta stops him.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Harlan this is - I - this is crazy -
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: We need to make this so airtight your
dialog: average cop will entirely dismiss you
text: as a suspect. This seems crazy but
dialog: it will work.
scene_heading: INT. HARLAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
text: Marta in the robe, pulling the cap on, tucking her hair
text: under it.
scene_heading: INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT OF PARTY - FLASHBACK
text: Marta, in Harlan's robe and cap, creeps down the creaky
text: stairs, then keeps going down.
speaker_heading: HARLAN (V.O.)
text: Walt and Jacob are smoking outside.
dialog: They'll see you...
scene_heading: INT. FOYER - NIGHT OF PARTY - FLASHBACK
text: Marta come down the stairs, and sees the outline of Walt and
text: Jacob outside through the glazed window windows.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: HARLAN (V.O.)
text: ...through the glazed window.
text: She holds her breath, a deer in the headlights.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Dad, go to bed.
text: Marta heads right back up the stairs.
speaker_heading: HARLAN (V.O.)
dialog: You were seen leaving, the security
dialog: cameras show you driving off, and
dialog: twenty minutes later I am seen alive
dialog: and well by my son.
scene_heading: INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT
text: Marta climbs the creaky stairs.
speaker_heading: HARLAN (V.O.)
dialog: You've gone from suspect number one
dialog: to an impossibility.
scene_heading: INT. HARLAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Marta ducks in, ditching the robe and cap on the bed.
scene_heading: EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE YARD - NIGHT
text: Marta shimmies down the last of the trellis.
speaker_heading: HARLAN (V.O.)
dialog: Leave the way you came. And don't.
dialog: Be. Seen.
text: She hops to the ground, then FREEZES and almost shouts.
text: She's facing a darkened first floor window. Wide open. And
text: inside it, staring RIGHT AT her, is Greatnana.
text: Marta is frozen. Greatnana isn't moving either. Just has
text: her eyes locked on Marta.
text: After what seems like forever, Greatnana cocks her head
text: slightly and asks...
speaker_heading: GREATNANA
dialog: Ransom? Are you back again already?
dialog: 46.
text: Marta breathes. And backs away. Then turns and goes,
text: quickly, down across the lawn.
speaker_heading: HARLAN (V.O.)
text: Drive home. Sometime in the next few
dialog: days the police will question you.
scene_heading: INT. HARLAN THROMBEY'S STUDY - NIGHT
text: Back to Harlan and Marta.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Harlan I can't lie I'll puke
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: Don't lie. Tell fragments of the
dialog: truth. In this exact order:
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Blanc catches his coin. Lieutenant Elliott and Trooper
text: Wagner look up at Marta, expectant. Just a brief moment has
dialog: passed since we left them.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: I took him upstairs. We played our
dialog: nightly game of GO, at some point he
dialog: knocked the board over and Joni came
dialog: up to check on us. Then I gave him
dialog: pain medication, he pulled his
dialog: shoulder last week, and left him in
dialog: his study. At midnight. Said bye to
dialog: Walt, went home.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: What medication did he get?
text: Marta chooses her words very carefully:
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Since his injury I've been giving him
text: a 100 milligram IV push of Toradol, a
dialog: non narcotic analgesic. And to help
text: him sleep, 3 milligrams of morphine.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Anything unusual about his demeanor?
text: Uh oh. Marta keeps it solid. Superhuman effort.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: No.
text: The three men nod. Blanc holds Marta's gaze. She holds it
text: right back. Then he smiles.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Well that sounds about right. Thank
dialog: you Ms. Cabrera.
scene_heading: INT. FOYER - MOMENTS LATER
text: Marta walks calmly out of the library. Then across the
text: foyer into a small door.
scene_heading: INT. HALF BATH
text: Marta walks in, closes the door behind her, locks it, turns
text: on both the taps, and PUKES into the toilet.
scene_heading: INT. LINDA'S ROOM
text: Linda stands in her childhood room, by the window in the
text: ebbing light. From a shelf she pulls a stack of PINK
text: NOTECARDS, identical to the one Harlan showed Richard in his
dialog: office. But these are covered in writing, sweet little
text: notes, a father to his daughter.
speaker_heading: WALT (0.S.)
dialog: Hey sis. People are going to start
dialog: getting here for the memorial pretty
dialog: soon. Are you- Are you alright?
text: She looks up. Walt in the doorway. She wipes her eyes,
dialog: indicates the notes.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I was just thinking about Dad's
dialog: games. This all feels like one, it
dialog: feels like something he'd write, not
dialog: do. I keep waiting for a big reveal,
dialog: where it all makes sense. How nice
dialog: would that be?
text: Her little brother hugs her. His eyes tired and dark.
dialog: 48.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: HARLAN THROMBEY - his portrait, with an ambiguous look on
text: his face.
text: Marta. Soda water in hand at the reception that night.
text: Staring shell shocked at Harlan.
text: The reception for friends of the family. Tables of food.
text: Twenty or thirty people milling, in dark tasteful clothes,
dialog: with the whole Thrombey family.
text: A tearful Fran has cornered Marta, talks through sobs:
speaker_heading: FRAN
dialog: I don't think he killed himself I
dialog: don't. I don't. There's this
dialog: Hallmark movie Deadly By Surprise
text: where Danica McKellar plays a wife
text: who gets poisoned by her husband but
text: bit by bit so she thinks she's going
text: crazy and she ends up killing
dialog: herself, and my cousin who's the
text: receptionist at the medical examiners
dialog: office says that kind of thing can
dialog: totally happen, she says it's not
dialog: even like 3% as crazy as stuff she's
dialog: seen come through the -
text: As Fran's talking, Marta looks at the room of family
text: members, gathered around talking. She FLASHES BACK to:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF PARTY - FLASHBACK - NIGHT
scene_heading: NIGHT OF THE PARTY
text: Harlan and Ransom go off together to have a private talk,
text: leaving the family having a heated conversation in the
dialog: living room.
speaker_heading: RICHARD

dialog: asshole's what we needed
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Oh god. Yeah an asshole's
dialog: what Germany needed in

dialog: champagne flutes:

speaker_heading: FRAN
dialog: Jesus. I'm gonna disappear until the
dialog: politics talk is done. You want some
dialog: champers?
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: No I'm technically working. Thanks.
text: Marta checks her watch. Meanwhile Donna, who's had a few, is
text: tearing into the family fight.
speaker_heading: DONNA JONI
dialog: We're losing our way of life
dialog: and our culture, there's
dialog: millions of Mexicans coming
dialog: and this isn't Joni don't Oh god really - yeah it's
dialog: make this a race thing, I'd not a race thing yeah
dialog: say the same thing if they
dialog: were European immigrants - Oh yeah, if the Swiss were
dialog: we allow them in and they clogging in the streets -
dialog: think they own what's ours They're putting. Children.
dialog: In cages. I mean these are
dialog: camps.
speaker_heading: RICHARD JONI
dialog: Nobody's saying that isn't
dialog: bad, but I blame the parents For wanting a better life
dialog: for their kids, isn't that
dialog: what America
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: For breaking the law. You're going
dialog: to hate hearing this but it's true,
dialog: America is for Americans. Marta, come
dialog: here.
text: Richard beckons her over, waving his cake plate. We've seen
text: this moment before, silent, during Richard's questioning.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Oh god don't.
text: Marta is drawn over next to Richard, very uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: No, Marta your family came from
dialog: Uruguay but you did it right, she did
dialog: it legally, I'm saying. You work
dialog: hard, and you'll earn your share from
dialog: the ground up just like dad and all
dialog: of us did - Marta I bet you agree
dialog: with me.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Leave the poor girl alone.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: No Marta do you agree, I'd like you
dialog: to answer - you wanna become an
dialog: American, there are legal ways to do
dialog: it, but if you break the law it
dialog: doesn't matter if you have a good
dialog: heart, you gotta face the
dialog: consequences.
text: At that moment booming shouts begin behind the study door -
text: Harlan and Ransom going at it. Ransom bursts out.
text: Marta takes the opportunity to slip into the hallway, alone.
text: She breathes hard. Takes a champagne flute from the tray.
text: Drinks it in one gulp.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: END FLASHBACK. Marta in the same spot, Fran still talking
text: her ear off. The room sways. Marta sucks in breath, sways,
text: and braces herself against the wall.
speaker_heading: FRAN
dialog: Oh my god Marta, what?
text: Meg runs over, rubs her back.
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: Whoa hey, c'mere, hey. What do you,
dialog: you want water? Breathe. Hey. Fran
dialog: have you still got your stash?
scene_heading: INT. DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Empty and dark, fireplace blazing. Above the fireplace is
text: an ornate mantle clock. Fran uses a key to unlock one of
text: several tiny drawers hidden in its face, takes out a joint
text: and hands it to Meg.
speaker_heading: FRAN
dialog: Take em whenever you need em -
dialog: they're just drying out since you
dialog: gave me that Juul.
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: Thanks Fran.
text: Fran leaves them alone.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: MARTA MEG
dialog: I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm Stop saying you're sorry
dialog: sorry Jesus
text: Meg lights the joint.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: God my heart won't stop, I can't -
dialog: it's just everything, no, thank you
text: she refuses the joint, then realizes where it came from.
speaker_heading: MARTA (cont'd)
dialog: That's where Fran keeps her stash?
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: Who's going to open a clock?
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
text: Walt yells at a non responsive, bored Greatnana.
speaker_heading: WALT LINDA
dialog: DO YOU WANT DINNER, NANA? Walt she's fine, she ate the
text: DINNER? TO EAT? EAT? whole salmon spread already.
text: Meg grabs Walt, pulls him to Marta.
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: Did you tell Marta yet? What we all
dialog: talked about?
speaker_heading: WALT MEG
dialog: No, not yet, is now a good Yes a very good time. Right
dialog: time? now.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Marta. We've talked it over, and
dialog: (wait)
dialog: Have you been smoking grass?
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: We talked it over and the whole
dialog: family, we want to take care of you.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: What does that mean?
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: We all think you deserve something.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Financially, we want to help you out.
dialog: You were never anything but good to
dialog: dad. Because of that, you can count
dialog: on us.
text: Walt embraces her, Meg puts a hand on her back.
text: Over Walt's shoulder, Marta sees Harlan's portrait again.
text: Has its expression changed? It looks like it has a slight
text: conspiratorial smile. Marta breathes - maybe this is all
dialog: going to be ok.
speaker_heading: WALT (cont'd)
dialog: I thought you should have been at the
dialog: funeral, by the way. I was outvoted.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE PORCH - NIGHT
text: Later. Marta comes out to get some air. Exhales deeply.
text: And then jumps - she's not alone. Benoit Blanc sits ina
text: wicker chair in the dark, smoking a long thin cigar.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Wah ha. Detective. You're still here?
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Mm.
text: Silence. Blanc smokes and stares at Marta. Marta shifts.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Did you know Harlan?
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: He knew my father who was a police
dialog: detective. Years ago. My father
dialog: respected Harlan. That says quite a
dialog: lot.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: So that's why you're here?
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Here now here? No. I stayed hoping
dialog: to speak to you a little more.
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Uh?
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Something is afoot with this whole
dialog: affair. I know it, and I believe you
dialog: know it.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: So you're... going to keep digging.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Harlan's detectives they dig, they
dialog: rifle and root, truffle pigs. I
dialog: anticipate the terminus of gravity's
dialog: rainbow.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Gravity's Rainbow.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: It's a novel.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: I know. I haven't read it.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Neither have I. Nobody has. But I
dialog: like the title. It describes the
text: path of a projectile, determined by
dialog: natural law. Voila, my method. I
dialog: observe the facts without biases of
dialog: the head or heart, I determine the
text: arc's path, stroll leisurely to its
dialog: terminus, and the truth falls at my
dialog: feet.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The medical examiner was ready to
dialog: rule this a suicide, but Elliott
dialog: agreed to keep it pending for forty
dialog: eight hours. Tomorrow morning I
dialog: search the grounds and the house,
dialog: begin my investigation. I want you
dialog: to be by my side for it. My
dialog: confidant, my eyes and ears.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: What but - why me?
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: I trust your kind heart. Also you
dialog: are the only one who had nothing to
dialog: gain from Harlan's death. So.
dialog: Watson.
text: Blank puts out his cigar, stands.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: You want my insight into this family?
dialog: None of them are murderers. That's
dialog: my insight.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: And yet. Be it cruel or comforting,
text: this machine unerringly arrives at
dialog: the truth. That's what it does.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Always?
text: He does a little bow.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Tomorrow at eight.
text: Marta watches him go.
scene_heading: INT. CABRERA LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Marta gets home. Her mom is on the couch, zoning out in
text: front of the TV, still in a cleaning uniform. Without a
text: word Marta sits next to her. Stares at the TV.
text: Off her eyes, we FLASH BACK with her:
scene_heading: INT. HARLAN THROMBEY'S STUDY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: I know I missed something... there's
dialog: going to be something I missed. But
dialog: I know you can beat it. Without
dialog: losing your soul you have to do what

speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: You can and you have to. For me.
dialog: Right now.
dialog: 55.
text: She's out the door and he shuts it.
scene_heading: INT. OUTSIDE HARLAN'S ATTIC OFFICE DOOR - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
text: Marta stands frozen. Soft voices of Walt and Jacob float up
text: from downstairs. She turns back to the door.
text: Silence. Moments going by. Shit. Can she do this? Shit.
text: No. She turns and pushes back into the office -
scene_heading: INT. HARLAN THROMBEY'S STUDY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Harlan I have to get you help -
text: Harlan reclines on the couch in the middle of the room,
text: ornate dagger against his throat. Marta's eyes go wide.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: Do what I say and everything's going
dialog: to be ok, Marta. I promise.
text: She makes a move to stop him and with one quick motion he
text: DRAWS THE DAGGER across his throat. Blood sprays.
text: She leaps back, hands to her mouth, spins and leaves the
text: room, closing the door behind her.
scene_heading: EXT. THIRD FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
text: Breathing hard, silent crying. Then her breathing slows.
text: Her brain taking over. Resolve settling. The dice are
text: thrown. She wipes her eyes. Then bounds down the stairs,
text: out of frame.

text: Back to Marta and her mom on the couch. She puts her hand
text: on Mom's knee.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Everything's going to be ok. I
dialog: promise.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: (of course)
dialog: I know.
dialog: 56.
text: They go back to watching TV. But Marta's mind is buzzing.
text: On her white sneaker, we see but she does not - one single
text: drop of blood.
scene_heading: EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE GUARD GATE - MORNING
text: The gate is open, Marta's car pulls up just inside it. The
text: small Guard house next to the gate, Blanc, Elliott and
text: Wagner outside it. Blanc waves to her.
scene_heading: INT. GUARD HOUSE
text: Thrombey's security man, MR PROOFROC, guides them into the
text: cramped dusty space. Proofroc is old and salty. He shows
text: them old photos of the house, stuck to a steel fridge with
text: big brightly colored fruit magnets.
speaker_heading: MR PROOFROC
dialog: Fifty years I worked this estate, you
dialog: know security back then meant making
dialog: the rounds with a 94, keeping your
dialog: ears open. Before all this modern
dialog: technology.
text: Nothing in the room is newer than 1988. An 8 inch CRT
text: monitor shows a phosphorescent live feed of the road outside
text: the gate, and a top loaded VHS VCR sits next to it.
speaker_heading: MR PROOFROC (cont'd)
dialog: Well the video here, I saved the tape
dialog: from that night, usually I erase ‘em
dialog: with the magnetic de-gauser, but I
dialog: thought better save that one. Cause,
dialog: security. That's the live feed
dialog: there.
text: Marta notices something with alarm - the video feed shows
text: the road outside, and at the top edge you can just barely
text: see the carved elephant that marks the gardener's utility
dialog: road. She realizes Harlan said
speaker_heading: HARLAN (V.O.)
dialog: ...to avoid the security cameras,
dialog: pull off the road AFTER the carved
dialog: elephant.
dialog: Marta keeps a poker face, but.. shit.
dialog: 57.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: (to Proofroc)
dialog: Can we see the actual TAPE?
speaker_heading: MR PROOFROC
dialog: Oh sure.
text: CLACK! The tape loads into the mechanical VCR. An
text: impossibly grainy, smeared night vision view of the road
text: outside the gate. Time stamp: 10:02pm.
speaker_heading: TROOPER WAGNER
text: It's like a Japanese horror movie.
speaker_heading: MR PROOFROC
dialog: (proud)
dialog: I record it SSLP, gets eight hours
text: per tape. Nine pm to five am.
speaker_heading: BLANC MARTA
dialog: Can we - (to Proofroc)
dialog: (to Marta)
dialog: Can we scan forward?
dialog: Can we scan forward?
speaker_heading: MR PROOFROC
dialog: Hold the play button down and press
dialog: the FF down halfway till you feel it
dialog: grind.
text: Wagner does, the machine makes horrible noises and the
text: picture frizzles and frazzles. Then stops and ejects.
speaker_heading: MR PROOFROC (cont'd)
dialog: And hold the tape down or it'll
dialog: eject.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Can your guys digitize it so we can
dialog: scan it properly?
speaker_heading: TROOPER WAGNER
dialog: I'm sure we can.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: I got it.
text: Marta grabs the tape from the VCR.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DAY
text: They all hack through the overgrown gardener's path.
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: TROOPER WAGNER
dialog: You know all these statues that you
dialog: see around here - they are all
dialog: straight out of his series the
dialog: “menagerie tragedy series", pretty
dialog: cool.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: (dry)
dialog: Awesome. Blanc the grounds are
dialog: lovely but you think what, someone
dialog: broke into the house? To kill
dialog: Harlan? Is that why we're out here?
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: I think it's an unlikely but if they
dialog: did, there will be traces.
speaker_heading: TROOPER WAGNER
dialog: I'll take that, thanks ma'am.
text: Marta hands Wagner the VHS tape. Then she discretely
text: pockets something she had held in her hand next to it -a
text: few of the bright fruit MAGNETS from Proofroc's fridge.
scene_heading: EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE YARD
text: The group hikes up out of the woods, towards the low wall
text: with a small pedestrian gate that leads to the east lawn.
text: Marta is out in front. During the following, she notices
text: something: The earth around and under the gate is soft and
text: bare. And clear as day: HER FOOTPRINTS from the other
text: night, the only ones from women's shoes. The same ones she
text: has on now. Her breath catches. SHIT.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Any luck with - whatshisname?
speaker_heading: TROOPER WAGNER
dialog: Ransom. No, but we have an address.
dialog: Ten Kenoak street.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Ten Kenoak. That's a pleasant thing
dialog: to say. kenoak. I awoke amid
dialog: Kenoak.
speaker_heading: TROOPER WAGNER
dialog: Ugh this mud, my boots are going to
dialog: stink.
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Mud - has it rained the past week?
dialog: No - Nobody move! Freeze! Everyone!
dialog: These footprints must not be
dialog: disturbed!
dialog: (sees)
dialog: Marta!
text: Marta has already walked through the pedestrian gate and up
text: onto the lawn, stepping in her pre-existing prints. She
text: turns back, playing dumb.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Don't - stop there, don't -
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: I can't hear you, what?
text: She trots back to them through the gate, stepping into her
text: returning prints.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: No no no no don't - don't step on
dialog: the, ok, alright. Aughhhhh ok.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: What?
text: Blanc sidesteps up to the gate, not stepping in the mud.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Alright, Wagner let's get the boys on
dialog: it, check the prints, tape off this
dialog: area, keep it clear.
text: The dogs come running down the lawn, barking at the men.
text: They tear through the gate, further messing up the mud.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Hey boys, easy. Hey. Hey.
text: She pets them and they quiet down.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Best judge of character is a dog.
dialog: I've found that to be true.
text: The dogs start BARKING and bolt towards the house, where
text: Richard and Linda are pulling up in their lux SUV.
dialog: 60.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: They're doing the will reading at
dialog: ten, whole family will be here soon.
text: Elliott heads up towards the house. Blanc meanders up the
text: lawn, and Marta follows.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: I've never been to a will reading.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: You think it'll be like a game show.
dialog: No. Imagine a community theater
dialog: performance of a tax return.
text: They approach the side of the house. Blanc does a gentle,
text: meandering study of the layout.
text: Marta steals a look at the trellis she climbed.
text: Oh no. A piece of the white lattice trellis that broke off
text: when she was climbing - about eight inches long - lies in
text: the grass beneath it. Her eyes dart up - yup, there's the
dialog: broken spot. Shit.
speaker_heading: BLANC (cont'd)
speaker_heading: SWEET BEANS
text: Marta starts - did he spot it? No - he's come face to face
text: with Greatnana, standing stock still on the porch. She
text: stares at him like a bird.
speaker_heading: BLANC (cont'd)
dialog: Good morning Mrs. Thrombey.
text: He approaches her, slowly. When his back is fully turned
text: Marta takes her shot and KICKS the piece of trellis under
text: some thick bushes at the base of the house.
text: Blanc and Greatnana stare at each other. Blanc gets very
text: close to her, great sympathy in his eyes. Greatnana stares
text: back. It's almost like they're communicating. This goes on
text: for a little too long. Then Blanc breaks from the trance,
text: and turns to Marta.
speaker_heading: BLANC (cont'd)
dialog: Do you think you could handle the
dialog: study?
dialog: 61.
scene_heading: INT. HARLAN THROMBEY'S STUDY
text: The blood is now only a subtle dark stain, but other than
text: that the room has been left intact from the night of the
text: party. Marta and Wagner observe as Blanc paces the room.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: (to Marta)
dialog: Where's your medical bag?
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: I... don't know - I left it here, I
dialog: always leave it with Harlan at night.
speaker_heading: TROOPER WAGNER
dialog: They must have taken it in as
dialog: evidence. I'11 check on it.
text: Blanc picks up the GO board and sets it on the table.
text: Examines its grid idly.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: How'd the GO board get knocked over?
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: We were just goofing around.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What are you thinking?
text: Blanc sighs gently, turns the baseball over in his hands.
dialog: Looks like this was a bust.
text: Blanc tips the GO board over, and it lands on the carpet
text: with a nearly inaudible WHOMPH. He stares at it.
text: But his concentration is broken by sharp barking outside.
text: They go to the tiny window and look out. A DASHING MAN in
text: his early 30s climbs out of a vintage Porsche. The dogs go
text: NUTS, biting at his pant legs.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Let me guess.
scene_heading: EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE FRONT DRIVE
text: The man kicks off the dogs and limps toward the house,
text: cursing. Lieutenant Elliott and Trooper Wagner step out
text: onto the porch.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Hugh Drysdale?
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: Ransom. Call me Ransom, my middle
dialog: name. The help call me Hugh.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: I'm Lieutenant Elliott, this is
dialog: officer Wagner, we'd like to ask you
dialog: a few questions about the night of
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: Uh huh.
text: He blows past them and into the house.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
text: Walt, Donna and Jacob (nose in his phone) sit around the
text: room. Linda and Richard stand, on their phones. Ransom
text: breezes in, bumping Donna who YELPS, startled.
text: Elliott and Wagner follow.
speaker_heading: TROOPER WAGNER
dialog: Sir excuse me, we are officers of the
dialog: law.
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: You gonna run me in? I don't feel
dialog: like talking. I'm distraught.
text: Ransom disappears into the kitchen, comes out eating a
text: sleeve of pinwheel cookies.
text: Blanc and Marta slip in. Elliott nods to Blanc.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Blanc, anything you need to ask him?
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: The hell anyway is this arrangement?
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Mr. Drysdale
text: Ransom sizes up Blanc with a grin.
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: CSI KFC?
text: Ransom grabs Fran the housekeeper's sleeve as she walks by.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: RANSOM (cont'd)
dialog: Hey Frannie can you get me a glass of
dialog: cold milk?
text: Meg and Joni have just entered, and Meg heard this.
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: Hey asshole. Not her name, not her
dialog: job.
text: Fran walks off with a scorching look at Ransom.
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: Meg. How's your SJW degree coming?
speaker_heading: MEG JONI
dialog: Trust fund prick. Alright. Guys.
text: ALAN STEVENS, the family's attorney, knocks and enters with
text: an assistant, SALLY, who juggles several attache cases.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Hey everyone. Hey. I'm just going
dialog: to set up in the other room, be ready
dialog: in ten minutes.
text: They go off to the library, leaving the family all together
text: in tense silence.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Funny Ransom, you skipped the funeral
dialog: but you're early for the will
dialog: reading.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Ok, people grieve in different ways,
dialog: let's not
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: (to Ransom)
dialog: It's funny you're here at all. Why
dialog: are you even bothering, that's what I
dialog: want to know.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What's that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: He knows what it means.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Walt, what?
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Jacob was in that bathroom the night
dialog: of the party.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Is that where you were all night?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: The hell were you doing in the
dialog: bathroom all night?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: MEG
text: Swatting Syrian refugees.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: Alt right troll.
speaker_heading: JACOB
text: Liberal snowflake.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: I don't know what any of that means
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: It means your son's a little creep.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Oh MY son's a creep?
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Guys! Walt he was in the bathroom...
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: He was in the bathroom
speaker_heading: RICHARD
text: Joylessly masturbating to pictures of
text: dead deer.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Ok you wanna go?
text: They go at each other and do some half-hearted slap-fighting
text: before Linda and Joni break them apart. Ransom's loving
dialog: this.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: We gotta do this more often.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Alright! Enough. Jacob, we get
dialog: where this is going. The bathroom's
text: next to Harlan's office, where he had
dialog: the big fight with Ransom. You heard
dialog: something. Spill it.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I just heard two things.
scene_heading: INT. HALF BATH - NIGHT OF PARTY - FLASHBACK
text: Jacob on the toilet, hearing non distinct yelling through a
text: vent high in the wall. But two words poke through:
speaker_heading: HARLAN (0.S.)
dialog: ...my will!
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: And then there was more shouting, but
dialog: I also heard Ransom say "I'm warning
dialog: you."
text: Walt raises his arms, triumphant.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Ransom? What's this mean?
text: He just eats cookies, silent.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: It means dad finally came to his
dialog: senses and cut this worthless lazy
text: brat out of the will.
dialog: (to Ransom)
dialog: And you better sell your little
dialog: Beamer and you better give your
dialog: notice at that country club and kick
dialog: whatever fashion drugs you're on
dialog: cause if you think after the bridges
dialog: you've burned, the shit you've said
dialog: and what you've put this family
dialog: through for the past ten years that
dialog: any of us are going to support you,
dialog: are going to give you like dad used
dialog: to say a single red dime you're nuts.
dialog: 66.
text: Ransom looks around the room. Cold faces.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Son.
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: (mock gravity)
dialog: Father?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Did Harlan tell you he was cutting
dialog: you out of the will?
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Then he's done what we weren't strong
dialog: enough to do - this might finally
dialog: make you grow up.
text: Ransom is really slapped by this but he doesn't let it show.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I think it might be the best thing
dialog: that could happen to you.
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: Thanks - my mother, folks.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: It won't be easy for you but it'll be
dialog: good. Nothing good is ever easy.
speaker_heading: RANSOM MEG
dialog: Up your ass Joni, you've got
dialog: your teeth bit into this Oh ‘up your ass' very nice
dialog: family tit so hard you homophobic privileged -
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: (going down the line)
dialog: As a matter of fact - Eat shit, hows
dialog: that? In fact eat shit, eat shit -
dialog: eat shit - Definitely eat shit. Eat
dialog: shit.
text: And now everyone is shouting at each other.
text: Blanc has heard enough. He sets the baseball down on a side
text: table, and drifts out. Marta follows him.
dialog: 67.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT PORCH
text: Blanc breathes in the air. Marta joins him. From inside
text: the house, the shouting continues.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: What was that about will readings
dialog: being boring?
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Exception that proves the rule.
text: Fran bursts out of the living room, muttering
speaker_heading: FRAN
dialog: Asshole.
text: She storms off around the house. A beat of thought. Then:
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: I'm warning you. Ransom said. I'm
dialog: warning you.
text: One of the dogs bounds up the steps to Blanc.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: You heard Ransom in there, it's the
dialog: kind of thing he says.
text: When Blanc goes to pet him, the dog drops something to his
text: feet with a clatter. Marta freezes.
speaker_heading: MARTA (cont'd)
dialog: What's he got there? Hey boy. You
dialog: find a stick? He's always bringing
dialog: junk into the house -
text: It's the piece of broken trellis. Blanc picks it up,
text: examines it, and suddenly his eyes go sharp.
scene_heading: EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE YARD
text: Holding the piece up as he studies the trellis that runs up
text: the side of the house. Marta runs up beside him.
speaker_heading: BLANC
text: This looks like a relatively fresh
dialog: break - yes. Right there.
text: He's spotted the broken spot on the trellis. Just up from
text: it, what looks like a boarded window.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: BLANC (cont'd)
dialog: Wait - that doesn't make sense,
dialog: where's that window?
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
text: The whole family in a screaming match, but Blanc and Marta
text: walk through and up the stairs. Three people notice:
text: Elliott and Wagner (who follow) and Ransom (who doesn't.)
scene_heading: INT. THIRD FLOOR LANDING
text: Blanc looks down the "dead end" hallway. Marta joins him,
text: out of breath.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Show me, but don't step on the
dialog: carpet.
text: It's a runner rug, and Marta delicately steps on the wood
text: siding as she goes to the wall with the painting. And swings
text: it open, revealing the window.
speaker_heading: TROOPER WAGNER
dialog: It's the trick window! From "A Kill
dialog: For All Seasons!"
text: Elliott and Wagner at the top of the stairs, and Blanc
text: motions them not to approach.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Off the carpet!
text: He drops down to his knees, removes a loupe from his jacket,
text: and holds it in his eye. Then, his face inches from the
text: carpet, he scans it. All the way to the window. Then
dialog: stops.
speaker_heading: BLANC (cont'd)
dialog: Traces of dried mud. I suspect they
dialog: go the length of the hallway.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Footprints?
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: No, just traces.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Depending on when it was last
dialog: cleaned, it could be from anytime
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: But that would not explain this.
text: He motions to the base of the window sill - obvious scuffs
text: of dried mud. Marta winces.
text: Blanc tosses the piece of trellis to Elliott.
speaker_heading: BLANC (cont'd)
dialog: Analyze this mud. It will match these
dialog: traces, and you will find similar
text: samples leading up the trellis on the
text: side of the house.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: On the night of the party, somebody
dialog: who did not want to be heard climbing
dialog: the steps went to a great deal of
dialog: trouble to break into Harlan
text: Thrombey's rooms. The game is afoot,
dialog: eh Watson?
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY - MINUTES LATER
text: The whole family assembled. Marta stands in the back, with
text: Blanc, Elliott and Trooper Wagner.
text: Alan Stevens, Harlan's attorney, sits at a table with papers
text: in front of him, assistant Sally beside him.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Well. Thank you all for getting
dialog: together like this, it isn't legally
dialog: necessary but I thought because
dialog: you're all in town and some of you
dialog: are leaving soon, it would be best -
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Excuse me Mr. Stevens. As to that,
dialog: ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to
dialog: gently request you all remain in town
text: until the investigation is completed.
dialog: Shouldn't be more than two days.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: He's gently requesting, I'm ordering.
dialog: Nobody move until we figure this out.
dialog: Nobody likes this.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: What?
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Can we ask why? Has something
dialog: changed?
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: No it hasn't changed or no we can't
dialog: ask?
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Mr. Stevens, please continue.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Right. Well the other reason I
dialog: thought this gathering would be, uh,
dialog: beneficial is that as I told Walt,
dialog: Harlan altered his will one week ago.
dialog: He sealed it and asked me not to
dialog: submit it to the courts for probate
dialog: until after his death. So in case
dialog: there's any confusion about anything
dialog: we're all together, we can talk. I
dialog: can't imagine any of it will be that
dialog: complicated, Harlan's assets included
dialog: um
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: ...the house
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: the house which he owned outright, um
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: sixty million
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: right in various cash accounts and
dialog: investments, yes and of course the
dialog: real assets are sole ownership of um
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Blood Like Wine
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Blood Like Wine publishing, his
dialog: publishing company. Ok.
text: Walt's wife puts her hand on his knee. He squeezes it,
dialog: smiled tightly.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: ALAN (cont'd)
dialog: Um, he did write up a statement when
dialog: he made the recent changes, he wanted
dialog: it read first, so:
dialog: (reads)
dialog: "Some of you may be surprised by the
dialog: choice I've made here. No pleasure
dialog: was taken in the exclusion, and its
dialog: purpose was not to sow greater
dialog: discord in the family, quite the
dialog: opposite. Please accept it with
dialog: grace and without bitterness. But do
dialog: accept it. It's for the best."
text: Gently condescending eyes shift to Ransom. Linda sees this,
text: puts her hand on her son's hand, and he immediately gets up
text: and moves to a chair in the corner.
text: Alan's assistant hands him an envelope and he removes a
text: single sheet of paper with one short typed paragraph.
speaker_heading: ALAN (cont'd)
dialog: Ok. So - oh wow, yeah, not complex
dialog: at all. This'll be quick. "I Harlan
dialog: Thrombey, being of sound mind and
dialog: body, yada yada, my assets both
dialog: liquid and otherwise, I leave in
dialog: their entirety to Marta Cabrera. My
dialog: entire ownership of Blood Like Wine
dialog: publishing I leave in its entirety to
dialog: Marta Cabrera. The copyright of its
dialog: catalog likewise I leave in its
dialog: entirety to Marta Cabrera.
text: The air around Marta's head goes away. The room spins
text: She's not sure what's happening. Blanc is looking at her.
text: The whole family is looking at her.
text: Walt bursts out of his chair and grabs the will
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: No. What?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That can't be - that can't be right
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: RICHARD WALT
dialog: What the genuine shit That can't be right it's
dialog: right
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: It's right
text: Donna begins to hyperventilate. She puts her head between
text: her knees, breathes deep.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: No no no no Alan this can't be legal,
dialog: there are, we're his family
speaker_heading: WALT RICHARD
dialog: We're his family, Alan he
dialog: obviously wasn't,
dialog: something - I don't know
dialog: what but something wasn't Are there safeguards against
dialog: right here this?
text: And from the back of the room, slowly rising above the din
text: of confusion and cursing, slowly drawing even Marta's deer
text: in the headlights attention... Ransom. LAUGHING. Loud and
text: weirdly sincerely, tears down his cheeks, laughing his head
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Alan there's a mistake
speaker_heading: MEG JONI
dialog: Mom if it's what granddad No this is a mistake, this
dialog: wanted is ours.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Alan take that piece of paper and
dialog: shove it up your ass and get out.
dialog: And you cops, out!
text: They don't but Ransom slips out, his child-like laughter
text: trailing after him.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Linda -
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: No, we need to talk and we need to
dialog: fight this thing and we're not going
dialog: anywhere. GET OUT! We're the
dialog: Thrombeys goddammit! This is still
dialog: our house!
dialog: 73.
text: A beat of silence. Then all eyes go to Alan. Who looks
text: down at the will. His assistant Sally points helpfully.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Sorry, there's, uh. "Likewise the
dialog: house at two Deerborn Drive and all
dialog: belongings therein I leave to Marta
dialog: Cabrera.
text: Linda goes for Marta.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: You little bitch. Did you know about
dialog: this? What did you do to him to make
dialog: this happen, were you two what were
dialog: you boinking my father?
text: Marta recoils, stumbles back.
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: "Boinking?'
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Linda!
speaker_heading: JACOB WALT
dialog: Anchor baby. Marta! Jacob! And Linda -
dialog: please!
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Linda please - Marta, you need to
dialog: tell us though,
speaker_heading: WALT JONI
dialog: Yes Marta, did dad discuss You need to tell us
dialog: this with you? everything you know about
dialog: this and we need to talk
dialog: about this,
speaker_heading: WALT RICHARD
dialog: This isn't what dad wanted, Jesus don't mob the girl,
dialog: this isn't fair but we can let's talk about this
dialog: work this out
text: The whole family is coming towards her like zombies. Blanc
text: takes her by the arm and steers her towards the door.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: I think heads have to cool a little,
dialog: and in the meanwhile I'd maybe run.
dialog: 74.
scene_heading: EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE FRONT DRIVE
text: Marta stumbles out of the house in a daze. Behind her, the
text: entirety of the family floods out after her, shouting
text: reassurances and questions and accusations and a general din
dialog: of confusion.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: I - I have no idea why he - I just
dialog: need to think - I'll call you or have
dialog: him call me or do something I don't
dialog: know
text: She gets in her car and slams the door, and it's instantly
text: like A Hard Day's Night - the family gathered around trying
text: to talk through the window and rapping to get her attention.
text: Marta keys the ignition - chug chug chug. Nothing. Oh god,
text: not now - chug chug chug. It won't turn over.
text: Richard opens the door, she pulls it closed again and locks
text: it, this is like a horror movie. Blanc is trying to get the
dialog: family to back off but no dice.
text: Marta puts her head in her hands, all of it swirling and
text: echoing and horrifying, she has no idea what to do.
speaker_heading: HONK!
text: She turns - a honking car pulls up right beside her and
text: through the family crowd she sees Ransom in his Porsche,
text: waving "get in." With no other options she pushes out of
text: her car and through the family and JUMPS IN with him.
text: As he GUNS IT and careens out of the driveway he shouts back
text: at the family with a wave
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: I think this could be the best thing
dialog: to happen to all of you!
text: And they're gone. The family keeps shouting at each other.
text: Blanc watches the Porsche recede, his expression unreadable.
text: DING! His phone buzzing. He checks it. His expression
text: darkens.
scene_heading: INT. RANSOM'S PORSCHE
text: Tearing down the private road, away from the house. He's
text: still laughing, she's still shell shocked. Slowly, his
text: laughter eases to a stop. A moment of silence.
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: Ok seriously though, what the hell?
text: She shakes her head, looks at him. What the hell indeed.
scene_heading: EXT. ROADSIDE FAMILY RESTAURANT - LATER
text: The Porsche parked out front.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - CORNER BOOTH
text: Tucked into a dark corner, Marta is miserable. Ransom is
text: bemused, but regards her closely.
text: They sit in silence. A waitress sets a sausage plate down.
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: (to the waitress)
dialog: Could we get an extra bowl please?
dialog: (to Marta)
dialog: You look like you're gonna pass out.
dialog: Have you eaten all day? Eat.
text: She joylessly shovels food in her mouth, starving.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: This is a nightmare.
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: Uh huh. So why.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Why
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: Why. Hey, this is everything. There
dialog: has to be a bigger reason why and you
dialog: know it.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Well Ransom how about it had more to
dialog: do with you guys than with me.
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: (agrees)
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Yeah that's the only thing that makes
dialog: sense.
dialog: 76.
text: Marta is unexpectedly effected by this. The waitress
text: breezes by, sets an empty bowl on the table.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Did he tell you anything?
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: Just I wasn't getting a cent.
speaker_heading: MARTA RANSOM
dialog: He wanted you to build
text: something from the ground something from the ground
dialog: up, like your parents up, like my parents
speaker_heading: RANSOM (cont'd)
dialog: yeah. My mom built her business from
dialog: the ground up with a million dollar
dialog: loan from granddad. My dad owns none
dialog: of it, and mom made him sign a
text: prenup. He lives in fear.
dialog: I know that's what granddad wanted to
dialog: protect me from by doing this, and I
dialog: know I shouldn't say this out loud
dialog: but when he told me, Jesus Christ I
dialog: coulda killed him.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: After I left the party, though. I
text: was driving fast, nowhere, just in
dialog: the night. And I got this weird...
dialog: clarity. That from here on I was
dialog: going to have to do for myself. And
dialog: that felt... good. The old bastard.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Marta I know three things. One: I
dialog: know he didn't commit suicide.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: What makes you think that
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: I don't think it. I know it. Cause
dialog: I knew my granddad. So you're not
dialog: going to bullshit me. Because two:
dialog: I know lying makes you puke. Cause
dialog: of that mafia game last fourth of
dialog: July.
text: Marta sinks back, suddenly nervous.
speaker_heading: RANSOM (cont'd)
dialog: And three. I know that you just ate
text: a full plate of sausage and baked
dialog: beans.
dialog: 77.
text: She looks down at her empty plate. Oh no. He pushes the
text: large empty bowl in front of her.
speaker_heading: RANSOM (cont'd)
dialog: So look me in the eye. And tell me
dialog: what really happened to my granddad.
text: Her lip quivers. She looks like she might attempt it. But
text: then tears drop from her eyes.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: You bastard.
text: Ransom pull the bowl away, and puts his hand on hers.
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: Marta. Tell me everything.

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING
text: Lit by a fire in the fireplace, the whole family pacing

speaker_heading: ALAN

speaker_heading: RICHARD LINDA
dialog: Would a sound person do The very action speaks to
dialog: this! Sound how? unsoundness!
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: not legally no, you not liking what

dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What about undue influence?
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Yes! Undue influence!
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: (weary)
dialog: Did you just google that?
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: If Marta was manipulating dad
dialog: somehow, if we found out that she had
speaker_heading: LINDA WALT
text: Gotten her hooks into him Somehow or something
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: You need a strong case for that.
dialog: You've got nothing. "She endeared
dialog: herself to him through hard work and
dialog: good humor" won't cut the salami.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: What about the slayer rule?
text: All eyes turn to her. Her face is lit by her phone.
speaker_heading: JONI (cont'd)
dialog: I did just google that.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: The slayer rule obviously does not
dialog: apply here.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What the hell is the slayer rule?
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: It's if someone is convicted of
dialog: killing the person they can't get
dialog: their inheritance.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Not even convicted, even if they're
dialog: held responsible for their death in
dialog: civil court
speaker_heading: WALT ALAN
dialog: Like OJ Like OJ, yes. But Harlan
dialog: committed suicide.
dialog: 79.
text: All eyes turn to Blanc, who this whole time has been sitting
text: in a chair by the fire, lost in thought.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Detective Blank. You said that the
dialog: investigation is continuing. You
dialog: made a point of that. Do you suspect
dialog: foul play?
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Mister Blanc. If you please.
dialog: (beat)
text: There is much that remains unclear.
dialog: But yes. I suspect foul play.
dialog: The eruption you would expect breaks out.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Marta?
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: I have eliminated no suspects.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You're full of shit, I don't trust

speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Thank you.
text: Alan takes that as an excuse to leave.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: There's one answer to this: she can
dialog: renounce the inheritance.
speaker_heading: WALT LINDA
dialog: She knows it's what she

dialog: thing to do. right thing.
text: Meg rounds on her mom, speaks quietly, in tears.
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: Mom. If Granddad wanted Marta to
dialog: have everything, that's what he
dialog: wanted.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: No, this was not him. He loved us,

dialog: wanted you to have an education.

speaker_heading: JONI (cont'd)
dialog: Meg. You think I can pay for your

text: This leaves Meg shaken.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: Beer bottles now stacked up in front of Ransom. Marta has
text: just told Ransom everything. He stares into space, and
dialog: makes the slightest hint of a laugh which I'll write as:
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: Heuh.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: I know, just saying it it sounds
dialog: insane but it's all true. I think
dialog: Blanc's been on to me from the
dialog: start - I don't care if I go to jail,
dialog: but my mom... my sister, we can't -
text: Nothing but silence from Ransom. Maybe he's deep in
text: thought. A strange glint in his eye.
speaker_heading: MARTA (cont'd)
dialog: You going to say something?
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: I always thought I was the only one
dialog: who could beat Granddad at GO. I
dialog: always thought that meant something.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: I know you did.
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: At the party, that night, my last
dialog: conversation with him, our last
dialog: fight, that's what he told me, about
dialog: you. That you beat him nearly every
dialog: time. More than me. And I thought
dialog: what a strange thing to tell me. But
dialog: I think I get it now. I think it did
dialog: mean something.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm not telling the family shit.
dialog: You're not going to jail. That
dialog: detective is not going to catch you.
dialog: And you're not giving up the family
dialog: fortune.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: RANSOM (cont'd)
dialog: Think about what Granddad did to see
dialog: this through, this was what he wanted
dialog: not just for you but for his family,
dialog: and for him. And yes for you.
dialog: You've come this far. Let me help you
dialog: go all the way.
text: Marta looks at him hard.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: This isn't you. You could turn me in
dialog: right now and get your cut of the
dialog: inheritance. Why?
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: Because fuck my family. They don't
dialog: deserve any of this. I can help you
dialog: and we can fool them all and get away
dialog: with it... and then you will give me
dialog: my cut of the inheritance. The
dialog: perfect ending, we all win. You, me
dialog: and Harlan. Deal?
text: Silence. Broken by Marta's phone ringing. On the phone
speaker_heading: ID - "MEG T"

speaker_heading: MARTA MEG (ON PHONE)

speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: MEG (ON PHONE)
dialog: Well the... with the, will. What are
dialog: you going to do?
text: Marta looks at Ransom. What indeed.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: What do you think I should do?
speaker_heading: MEG (ON PHONE)
dialog: You should do what you think is...
dialog: right. I think you should give it
dialog: back to us. Granddad always took
dialog: care of us, we're his family, I know
dialog: he was like family to you but we're
dialog: his actual family. Marta you know
dialog: this isn't fair, we've always been
dialog: good to you and we're going to take
dialog: care of you, everyone loves you and
dialog: you're like family and we'll take
dialog: care of you but you have to make
dialog: things right, you know what's right.
text: Marta, keeping eye contact with Ransom. Then, her voice
text: quavering, Meg drops what is for her the big bomb:
speaker_heading: MEG (ON PHONE) (cont'd)
dialog: Marta, mom's broke, she says I'1l
dialog: have to drop out of school.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: No, no. I won't let that happen.

scene_heading: INT. DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: MARTA (ON PHONE)
dialog: And once I get the -
dialog: 83.
text: Meg hangs up, lets the phone drop from her ear. Tears in
text: her eyes. She turns to her whole family gathered behind
text: her, silent and expectant.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: Marta realizes the connection's dead, holds the phone in her
text: hand like something delicate she just broke.
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: Ok then. Did the detective find
dialog: anything suspicious at the house?
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: (in a daze)
dialog: Mud. Tracks upstairs - where I broke
text: in through the window.
text: Ransom winces.
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: Identifiable prints?
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: Good. Ok. Good. Hey. You've just

scene_heading: INT. MARTA'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING
text: She wakes to a sharp rapping at her door. Her sister Alice
text: pokes her head in, flustered.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Marta get your ass up, what the hell
dialog: is happening? There's a guy here and
dialog: a bunch of stuff, everything's going
dialog: crazy, are we rich??
text: Marta lifts her head from her hands.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Maybe, I dunno.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: I don't even know what that means but
dialog: you better get your ass up.

scene_heading: INT. CABRERA LIVING ROOM

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: (subtitled Spanish)
dialog: Oh my god Marta what is all this,
dialog: what did you do?
text: The TV is tuned to local news - an anchor stands outside
text: THEIR APARTMENT BUILDING.
speaker_heading: LOCAL NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV)
dialog: ...we again we don't know much about
dialog: Marta Cabrera or the exact
dialog: relationship she had to Harlan
dialog: Thrombey, beyond being his home
dialog: nurse, and the Thrombey family has
dialog: yet to release a statement...
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Is that here?
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Oh yeah it is. Wait so is that true?
dialog: Are we rich?

text: Blanc sits.

speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Good Morning Mrs. Thrombey.
text: as he thinks of exactly the right word.
speaker_heading: BLANC (cont'd)
dialog: Why is grief the providence of youth?
dialog: I don't know. But I'd imagine that
dialog: age deepens all feelings. Including
dialog: grief. This was a long walk to
dialog: offering condolences for the loss of
dialog: your son. And asking you if it isn't
dialog: presumptuous of me to not think too
dialog: harshly of your family, if I am as I
dialog: suspect the first to console you.
dialog: They're young aren't they.
speaker_heading: BLANC (cont'd)
dialog: One thing I do assume of age is
dialog: weariness. Damned if I don't get
dialog: more tired every day. Tired of what
dialog: I do. Following arcs, like lobbed
dialog: rocks. The inevitability of truth.
dialog: But the complexity and the gray lies
dialog: not in the truth but what you do with
dialog: the truth once you have it.
text: Greatnana's eyes move slightly.
text: He reclines,
text: back at him.
dialog: sheers.
speaker_heading: BLANC (cont'd)
dialog: I think you have something you want
dialog: to tell me. I think you're very
dialog: perceptive and very capable of
dialog: telling me what you saw the night of
dialog: your son's party. But I'll happily
dialog: wait. I'm inno rush. I find it
dialog: quite pleasant. Sitting here with
dialog: you.
text: not particularly looking at her. She looks

dialog: 86.
scene_heading: INT. CABRERA LIVING ROOM
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Lawyers were here, very big lawyers
dialog: it looked like, and some other guys I
dialog: didn't know, they left all this for

dialog: business cards, and there was a pile
dialog: of other stuff when I got home -
text: Mom shovels some official looking legal letter and courier
text: envelopes into Marta's arms.
speaker_heading: MOM (cont'd)
dialog: (subtitled Spanish)
dialog: Hey. I don't like this.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: (subtitled Spanish)
dialog: I don't like it either mom. I'm

scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY
text: Dim and dingy. Marta comes out of their apartment door,
text: then jump, startled - at the end of the hall, lurking:
dialog: Walt.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Hey.
text: Walt's eyes are rimmed red. His heavy cane taps.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Hey.
text: They're not sure what to do so they awkwardly hug. Marta
text: still has the envelopes in her hands.
speaker_heading: WALT (cont'd)
dialog: How you doing?
speaker_heading: MARTA WALT
dialog: Well. Walt I want you to
dialog: know I didn't know about any
dialog: of this. This is I know you didn't, we all
dialog: went kinda crazy yesterday
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Understandable
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: You're still very important to all of
dialog: us, I want you to know that.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: I haven't even looked at all this
dialog: yet, this legal stuff, is this from
dialog: you guys?
text: Marta flips through the envelopes, squinting.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: it isn't from us. Maybe just local
dialog: lawyers and accountants who saw the
dialog: news and want to jump on it, I'd be
dialog: careful of it all.
text: One envelope sticks out - a blank plain letter sized
dialog: envelope, no postage, no return address.
speaker_heading: WALT (cont'd)
dialog: Marta. Is it your intention to
dialog: renounce the inheritance?
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: This is what Harlan wanted.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Well. Harlan has put you in a very
dialog: hard position here. It was unfair of
dialog: him.
text: Walt's hand on his cane. Gripping tight.
speaker_heading: WALT (cont'd)
dialog: You see what this kicks up with the
dialog: press and the scrutiny, and we
dialog: know... with your mother...
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: ...with my mother.
text: Marta's spine straightens.
speaker_heading: MARTA (cont'd)
dialog: What did Meg tell you.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: This isn't about who - you're missing
dialog: the point, we're not attacking you
dialog: with this.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: WALT (cont'd)
dialog: Marta if your mom came here
dialog: illegally, criminally, if you come
dialog: into this inheritance with the
dialog: scrutiny that entails I'd be afraid
dialog: that could come to light. That's
dialog: what we're all trying to avoid here.
dialog: We can protect you from that
dialog: happening, or if it happens.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: You're saying even if it came to
dialog: light, with the family's resources
dialog: you could help me fix it.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Yes. The right lawyers, none of
dialog: those local guys but New York
dialog: lawyers, DC lawyers, enough resources
dialog: put towards it, yes. But there's no
dialog: need it should ever even come up.
dialog: But yes.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Ok. Good.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Ok?
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Cause Harlan gave me all your
dialog: resources. So that means with my
dialog: resources I'll be able to fix it. So
dialog: I guess I'm going to go find the
dialog: right lawyers.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Marta.
text: He shuffles towards her. For the first time she feels a
text: hint of physical threat, and backs up quick into her
dialog: apartment.
speaker_heading: WALT (cont'd)
dialog: You better be sure you want to -
text: She slams the door
scene_heading: INT. CABRERA KITCHEN
text: and leans against it, breathing hard. But angry and
text: focused. She dumps the legal envelopes in the trash but
text: keeps the mysterious envelope, opens it and pulls out:
dialog: 89.
text: Half a sheet of paper, roughly torn. A photocopy of the
text: header of some sort of medical document, "OFFICE OF THE
text: CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER" Under that, a photocopy of a tag
text: with her name on it. And hand written in block letters at
dialog: the top: "I KNOW WHAT YOU DID."
text: Marta's phone BUZZES, and she jumps. Caller ID: "maybe B
text: BLANC". She hesitates, then sends it voicemail. Looks at
text: the mysterious letter in her hands.
scene_heading: INT. RANSOM'S LIVING ROOM
text: Ransom studies the mysterious letter. Marta pushes aside a
text: stack of New Yorkers and sits on the couch.
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: Well I don't know what this is from
text: Indicating the tag photocopy with her name.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: It's my medical bag tag. They have
dialog: my medical bag. For some reason.
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: OK, but this is just a photocopy of
dialog: the header of a blood toxicology
text: report, from the local crime lab. On
dialog: Harlan. Marta, it would show the
dialog: morphine overdose.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: So I'm screwed! How do you know all
dialog: this stuff?
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: I was Harlan's research assistant.
dialog: For a summer.
text: He sips his morning coffee.
speaker_heading: RANSOM (cont'd)
dialog: But what kind of blackmail scheme is
dialog: this? I mean the actual evidence is
text: sitting up the street at the crime
dialog: lab. What was the point of sending
dialog: you this?
scene_heading: EXT. NORFOLK ROADS
text: Siren blazing, the cop car SPEEDS into town.
dialog: 90.
scene_heading: EXT. MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE
text: The cop car pulls past an identifying sign into the parking
text: lot of a one story stand alone building, joining several
text: other cop cars, and fire trucks. Journalists kept at bay.
text: The building is a charred brick husk. Black smoke, debris.
text: It's been gutted with an explosion and a blazing fire.
text: Blanc steps out of the cop car and finds Lieutenant Elliott.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: What's the cheese?
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Five AM, security systems here was

dialog: Blood stores, records, all gone. No

speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Any surveillance cams?
text: Elliott gestures wearily to the charred remains of a
text: security camera on the smoking shell of an awning.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: And speaking of security, the
dialog: security tape from the Thrombey
dialog: residence was scrambled. For some
dialog: reason.
text: Blanc unsurprised. He motions back to the building.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: What was still pending from the
dialog: autopsy?
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
text: The report on the blood work.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Blood work?

text: Across the street, Marta and Ransom pull up in her car.
scene_heading: INT. MARTA'S CAR
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Holy shit. This is insane.
dialog: 91.
text: Ransom looks at her - yeah it's likely. They both
text: instinctively duck down in case the cops look over.
speaker_heading: MARTA (cont'd)
dialog: Who would blow up a whole real
dialog: official building just to blackmail
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: Marta this means that the blackmailer
dialog: has the only paper copy of the thing
dialog: that can prove your guilt. You didn't
dialog: get any other instructions, no phone
dialog: call no email, no nothing?
text: Marta looks stunned. She stabs at her phone, quick swipes.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: ...nothing...I didn't check my email.
text: She shows him an email from 092832@shushmail.com. No
text: subject line, simple text: 1209 Columbus Rd 10AM
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: That's it. 1209 Columbus Road, 10am.
text: Marta looks at Ransom, then at the clock on her dashboard -
text: 9:32, then at the charred building.
scene_heading: EXT. MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE
text: Blanc looks around, deep in thought. He spots Marta's car.
scene_heading: INT. MARTA'S CAR
text: Marta peeking up through the window.
text: Blanc sees her. She sees him. Ducks back down. Shit.
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: You know what this means right? If
dialog: you destroy that copy you are totally
text: within the clear.
text: Blanc begins to walk straight towards Marta. Quickly and
text: with purpose. Shouts something, Lieutenant Elliott follows.
speaker_heading: RANSOM (cont'd)
dialog: Marta. Did you hear me.
dialog: 92.
text: Marta peeks again - Blanc coming at them full speed. Twenty
text: paces from the car. Closing in fast.

dialog: Yeah.
text: She sits up, throws the car in gear and FLOORS IT.
scene_heading: EXT. MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE
text: Her subcompact PEELS OUT and buzzes off down the road.
text: Blanc, crestfallen, runs back towards the cop cars in the
text: parking lot, shouting at Elliott, who flags a cop.
scene_heading: INT. MARTA'S CAR
text: The whine of the engine, Ransom puts on his seat belt. In
text: the rear view, siren lights as cop cars pour out of the

speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: You regret helping me yet?
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: I regret not taking the beamer.
text: Her phone buzzes - Blanc calling. IGNORE.
scene_heading: EXT. NORFOLK ROADS

speaker_heading: MARTA RANSOM
dialog: Oh my god oh my god oh my Are you flooring it?
dialog: god I am literally flooring
dialog: it
text: Her phone rings - Blanc again. She looks over - cop cars
text: are RIGHT ALONGSIDE them. Blank holds his phone up, looks
text: at her quizzically. Points to the phone.
speaker_heading: RANSOM (cont'd)
dialog: This is going well.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: This is stupid, I'm pulling over
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: If you miss your shot at getting that
dialog: tox report it's all over...
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Aaauuuuuawwwaaagghhhh
text: She hits the brakes.
scene_heading: EXT. NORFOLK ROADS
text: Marta's car PEELS TO A STOP and the two COP CARS on either
text: side blaze by, hitting their brakes.
text: She pulls off onto a SIDE STREET and into narrower city
text: streets, down narrow alleys, using her small car to nimbly
text: dart though small spaces.
text: The cops can't follow, and she loses them.
text: She pulls to a stop in a secluded little back lot.
scene_heading: INT. MARTA'S CAR
text: Marta, breathing hard. Ransom is shocked.
dialog: 94,
speaker_heading: MARTA RANSOM
dialog: Ok. I'm all just pure
dialog: adrenaline now it's like I
dialog: swallowed bees. What's the
text: the whatsitcalled address 1209 Columbus road.
dialog: ok. And I just - I mean
dialog: whatever they want, I just
dialog: say yes right, just to get
dialog: that report back. And destroy it.
dialog: And destroy it. Ransom.
dialog: Thank you. I couldn't do
dialog: this without you.
text: He smiles slightly. A quick moment of silence between them.
text: Then: RAP RAP RAP on Ransom's car window.
text: Blanc. Standing right outside. Marta looks in her rear
text: view - the cop car has pulled up silently behind them.
text: Another pulls up in front.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT
text: Ransom and Marta step out of the car, hands raised for some
dialog: reason.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: That was the dumbest car chase of all

speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: (to Marta)
dialog: I spoke to Wanetta Thrombey,
dialog: Greatnana. The night of the party
text: she saw someone climb the trellis to
text: the third floor.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Mr. Drysdale, come with us please.
text: Elliott leads Ransom off by the elbow. Ransom throws a look
text: back at Marta - he has no idea what's going on.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: “Ransom came back" she said. I don't
dialog: know what he came back to do, but
dialog: we'll find out.
dialog: 95.
text: Marta looks at Ransom - oh no. Senile Greatnana thought she
text: was him. This is a mistake. But... she glances at her
dialog: watch - 9:51.
speaker_heading: BLANC (cont'd)
dialog: Did he ask you to drive when he saw
dialog: me coming?
text: Ransom's being led to the police car. Marta decides:
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Yes.
text: Marta gets back in her car. She pretends to take a sip from
text: an empty soda cup, but actually SPITS UP a little into it.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (0.S.)
dialog: Blanc. Coming with us?
speaker_heading: BLANC (0.S.)
dialog: (to Elliott)
dialog: I'll drive with Marta.
text: To Marta's horror Blanc opens her passenger door.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Let's go to the police station, I

scene_heading: EXT. NORFOLK ROADS
text: Cop cars coast through town, Marta's bringing up the rear.
scene_heading: INT. MARTA'S CAR
text: Marta glances at the dashboard clock - 9:55. Blanc, casual:
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Strange case from the start. A case
text: with a hole in the middle. A donut.
dialog: I'm just talking through my process
dialog: here, let me know if this is boring.
text: Marta's arms are locked, her eyes steal a glance at the
dialog: clock - 9:58.
speaker_heading: BLANC (cont'd)
dialog: I feel the noose tightening - the
text: family are truly desperate.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: BLANC (cont'd)
text: Desperate motives, the mystery of who
dialog: hired me, the impossibility of the
dialog: crime, and yet -
text: Up ahead, a street sign - "Columbus Road." Marta tenses.
speaker_heading: BLANC (cont'd)
dialog: A donut! One central piece, and if it
text: reveals itself the fog would lift,
text: the arc would resolve, the slinky
text: become unkinked
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Do you mind if I stop for a second. I
dialog: need to pick something up. It will be
dialog: very quick.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Sure.
scene_heading: EXT. NORFOLK ROADS
text: Marta's car makes a sharp turn, leaving the cop caravan.
scene_heading: EXT. 1209 COLUMBUS ROAD
text: A row of storefronts - 1209 is vacant. Marta's car pulls a
text: few stores past it. She gets out of the car.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: I'll just be a few minutes.
text: Marta runs into a bustling hair salon.
scene_heading: EXT. BACK ALLEY
text: Marta ducks out the back door of the salon, goes two doors
text: down to 1209, and slips into the back door.
scene_heading: INT. 1209 COLUMBUS ROAD
text: Dark, empty retail space. Lit only by the painted-over
text: front windows. Marta edges her way in, her eyes still
text: adjusting from the sun.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Hello?
text: Her foot hits something on the dirty concrete floor.
dialog: 97.
scene_heading: HER MEDICAL BAG.
text: She kneels, picks it up gently.
text: Next to where it was lying, she finds something else
text: curious - the burned remnants of a piece of paper. Only a
text: charred corner remains.
text: She turns her attention back to the room. Creeps forward.
speaker_heading: MARTA (cont'd)
dialog: Hello?
text: Ahead - a silhouette. A person. Seated in a chair, in the
text: center of the room. Silent, facing her.
speaker_heading: MARTA (cont'd)
dialog: Listen I don't know what you want.
dialog: Whatever you want we can work it out,
dialog: but we have to figure it out right
dialog: here, right now, and I'm leaving with
dialog: that report.
text: A beat of silence. Nothing. Something's not right here.
speaker_heading: MARTA (cont'd)
dialog: Hello?
text: Marta takes a step closer, lifts her phone, and turns on its
dialog: flashlight.
text: Illuminating the ghostly face of FRAN, the housekeeper.
text: Marta, barely breathing:
speaker_heading: MARTA (cont'd)
dialog: Fran?
text: A SPIDER crawls across Fran's face. Marta STIFLES A SCREAM
text: and leaps back, sucking in air.
text: A moment of stillness. Her phone BUZZES - Blanc calling.
text: Marta ignores the call, frozen.
text: Her eyes go to: A white letter sized ENVELOPE in Fran's
text: hand, resting on her lap.
text: Marta swallows. Leans in, carefully and quietly for some
text: reason, and SLIPS the envelope from the lifeless fingers.
text: Unsealed. She opens it.
text: It is empty.
dialog: 98.
text: Before this can even sink in, a rattling, grating DRAW OF
dialog: BREATH - from Fran.
text: Marta starts - oh my god - and goes to her, checking a
text: pulse, checking her eyes, lays her on her back. Fran sucks
text: in thin breath, her eyes finding Marta in the glare of the
text: dropped phone flashlight.
speaker_heading: MARTA (cont'd)
dialog: Fran! Fran! Can you hear me? Fran,
dialog: give me a sign if you can hear me!
speaker_heading: FRAN
dialog: You
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Me? Fran it's Marta, you called me
dialog: here, you sent me the email, I'm
dialog: here. I'm going to call an ambulance
dialog: and you're going to be ok but can you
dialog: tell me what happened, did you take
dialog: something, what's happened to you -
text: Weak, Fran grabs Marta's wrist, and Marta focuses on her.
speaker_heading: FRAN
dialog: ...COpy... copy
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FRAN
dialog: ...Stashed...
dialog: These words are barely given breath:
speaker_heading: FRAN (cont'd)
dialog: you... did this... won't... get
dialog: away.. with this
text: Her eyes seize. Her breath gets ragged. Marta is paralyzed
text: with shock and fear. Fran is dying.
text: Marta looks at the medical bag in her hand. Then at Fran,
text: struggling with her final breaths, eyes wide with fear.
text: She takes a step back from the dying Fran. Fingers tight
text: around the medical bag. Letting her die.
text: But then, a decision: no. Marta dials 911 on speaker, drops
text: to her knees and starts administering mouth to mouth.
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: PHONE
dialog: 911, what is your emergency?
scene_heading: EXT. 1209 COLUMBUS ROAD
text: Blanc sitting in the car, singing softly to himself.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Sometimes I stand in the middle of
dialog: the room... not going left... not
dialog: going right...
text: He looks at the hair salon - what's taking so long? And
text: then sirens, as an AMBULANCE pulls up two doors down, and
text: EMT's run into the abandoned storefront.
speaker_heading: BLANC (cont'd)
dialog: Oh lord.
speaker_heading: HARD CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - LATER
text: Marta and Blanc sitting silently in the fluorescent-lit

text: on his phone, mostly listening.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: (listens)
dialog: Alright my friend, thank you for the
dialog: update. No I'm here with her. No
dialog: need for that, I'll bring her in once
dialog: we get word that the housekeeper is
text: stable. It's still touch and go.
dialog: (listens)
dialog: Alright.
text: He hangs up. Marta looks at him.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: This is over. People are getting
dialog: hurt. I'm going to tell you the
dialog: truth.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Young Ransom just told Lieutenant
dialog: Elliott everything. Who just told me
dialog: everything.
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: MARTA BLANC
dialog: Good. Wait god I hope he
dialog: didn't cover for me, did he
dialog: tell the real truth, about
dialog: me switching the- Yeah
dialog: And the disguise and all
dialog: the- Yes
dialog: And the blackmail with the- Mm.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: But why did Fran take my morphine?
dialog: Obviously she had swiped my bag from
dialog: the house, but she didn't seem like a
dialog: user to me, unless that's why she
dialog: needed money...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I dunno, doesn't matter. I should
dialog: tell the Thrombeys myself, I feel
dialog: like I owe that to them.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: I don't think that's a good idea
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: No, I need to do it. I won't do any
dialog: of this if I can't do that. I really
dialog: need to. I gave the doctors my
dialog: number, they'll call if anything
dialog: changes with Fran.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: We'll round up the Thrombeys at the
text: house, along with a police escort.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: For the arrest after.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: You can tell me your whole story on
dialog: the drive over. I want no more
dialog: surprises.
text: Marta stands, a dead man walking, resigned.
scene_heading: EXT. NORFOLK ROADS
text: Marta's car drives through the scenic countryside. Inside
text: we see but don't hear her telling a long story to Blanc, who
text: looks at the passing countryside, brow knit.
dialog: 101.
scene_heading: EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE FRONT DRIVE - AFTERNOON
text: All the family cars there, along with two police cruisers.
text: Marta's pulls up.
scene_heading: INT. MARTA'S CAR
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: ...Said it was stashed, the copy, and
dialog: then she told me "you did this, you
dialog: won't get away with it" and then I
dialog: called the ambulance. And that's it.
text: She turns the engine off. Looks up at the house. Breathes.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Alright. Are you ready?
scene_heading: INT. FOYER
text: Marta and Blanc enter. This really feels like a walk
text: towards the gallows. Richard, Walt and Meg are there. Meg
text: avoids eye contact with Marta.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Ah. Ok, has she come to her senses?
speaker_heading: WALT
text: She's standing right there Richard
dialog: she can speak for herself -
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Is the rest of the family here?
speaker_heading: WALT BLANC
dialog: In the living room. I think maybe, if we
dialog: could...
text: Blanc beckons, and Richard and Walt file out. On her way
text: out Meg hugs Marta, weeping.
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: I'm sorry, I'm so sorry I told them
dialog: about your mom. I was angry and
dialog: scared, I'm sorry
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: It's ok, Meg. I understand. Believe
dialog: me. It's alright.
text: Meg sniffs, dries her eyes.
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: God I am so raiding Fran's stash
dialog: after this.
text: They hug one more time. Then when Meg walks off towards the
text: living room, Marta realizes something. Blanc walks back.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: I still think this is a bad idea, but
text: the family is assembled.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: (to Blanc)
dialog: I know where the tox report is.
scene_heading: INT. DRAWING ROOM
text: Marta jimmies the clock drawer open with a letter opener.
text: She pulls a FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER from inside, blows loose
text: pot leaves off it. She hands it to Blanc.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: She practically told me where it was.
dialog: Anyway this'll tie everything up.
dialog: And I just handed it to you, god
dialog: you're you're not much of a
dialog: detective are you?
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: To be fair you're a pretty lousy
dialog: murderer. Perhaps we deserve each
dialog: other.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
text: The family gathered, impatient. Lieutenant Elliott and
text: Trooper Wagner are there too, with another uniformed
text: officer. Ransom sits in the corner, his face passive.
text: Marta gulps. Blanc is a few steps behind her. As she
text: speaks, he unfolds and reads the tox report.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Um. You guys have always been good
dialog: to me. And what I'm about to say
dialog: isn't going to be easy, and you're
dialog: going to be upset, but especially
dialog: after everything you've gone through
dialog: the past few days, I thought you
dialog: deserved to hear it from me.
dialog: 103.
dialog: Walt smiles at her, “you're doing the right thing." Marta
text: takes a deep breath.
text: Blanc has finished reading the report. He refolds it
dialog: carefully.
speaker_heading: MARTA (cont'd)
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Excuse me. You have not been good to
dialog: her. You have all treated her like
dialog: shit to steal back a fortune that you
dialog: lost and she deserves. You're a pack
text: of bloody vultures at the feast, but
dialog: you're not getting bailed out, not
dialog: this time.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Ms. Cabrera has decided definitively
dialog: not to renounce the inheritance.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Furthermore it will be my
dialog: professional recommendation to the
dialog: local authorities that the manner of
dialog: death in the case of Harlan Thrombey
text: is ruled as suicide, and the case is
dialog: closed.
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARTA BLANC
dialog: What? No, Blanc - Thank you all for coming
dialog: goodbye.
text: He firmly guides Marta out by the elbow. A beat of silence.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Is anybody else confused?
text: As the family breaks out in hubub, Linda notices her dad's
text: OLD BASEBALL on the side table where Blanc left it. What's
text: that doing here? She picks it up.
dialog: 104.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY
text: Blanc steers Marta into the library, as sounds of hubub and
text: shouting come from the other room.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: What the hell? I want to come clean,
dialog: this is over -
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Almost.
text: Elliott bursts in, motions to the living room, then Marta,
dialog: then Blanc.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: What - with - what?
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: I'm sorry - officer Wagner!
text: Wagner enters.
speaker_heading: BLANC (cont'd)
dialog: Please keep the family out of this
dialog: room and get them out of the house if
dialog: you can. But stand by with your
dialog: additional officer.
speaker_heading: TROOPER WAGNER
dialog: Get the family out?
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Yes but not all of them.
text: Blanc whispers something to Wagner, who nods and exits.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Blanc c'mon, what's all this Drama.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Indulge me.
text: Marta sits. Elliott remains standing.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Blanc. I told Ransom, Ransom told
dialog: you, I'm telling you now - it is an
dialog: immovable fact that I killed Harlan.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Yes you did, yes he did, yes you are,
dialog: but. But.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: BLANC (cont'd)
dialog: I spoke in the car about the hole at
dialog: the center of this donut. And yes,
dialog: what you and Harlan did that fateful
text: night seems at first glance to fill
text: that hole perfectly. A donut hole in
dialog: the donut's hole. But we must look a
dialog: little closer. And when we do, we
text: see that the donut hole has a hole in
dialog: its center - it is not a donut hole
text: at all but a smaller donut with its
dialog: own hole, and our donut is not whole
dialog: at all!
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Blanc I understand that this is
dialog: amusing for you -
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Why. Was. I. Hired? Why would
dialog: someone hire me?
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Someone fishing for any crime that
dialog: could help reverse the will.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: I was hired before the sealed will
dialog: was read. Yes, the person must have
dialog: known the contents of the will. But
dialog: one step further - that same person
dialog: must have known a crime was
dialog: committed, and further, if the intent
dialog: was to reverse Marta's inheritance,
dialog: they must have known that Marta was
dialog: responsible.
dialog: (beat)
text: An intriguing combination of factors.
dialog: Someone who knew what Marta did,
dialog: wanted to expose it, but could not
dialog: reveal how they knew.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Fran? She was blackmailing me, she
dialog: knew what I did
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: But Fran wanted money, ergo she did
dialog: not want the crime exposed.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
dialog: Did someone in the family see Marta
dialog: doing something suspicious?
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: They would have had no reason to not
dialog: speak up. No. The answer is not so
dialog: simple.
text: Blanc sits, suddenly weary.
speaker_heading: BLANC (cont'd)
dialog: Now with the entire solution in my
dialog: field of view, the arc of this case
dialog: is a tragedy of errors. And Marta,
dialog: it will not be easy to hear. But
dialog: there is at least one truly guilty
dialog: party behind it all, guilty in the
dialog: true sense of acting with malice, and
text: committing a heinous crime with
dialog: selfish intent.
dialog: (calls)
dialog: Trooper Wagner.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: Trooper Wagner??
text: Blanc squints at her. No.
text: A moment later Wagner leads Ransom in. Ransom looks at
text: Marta softly, sadly.
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: Marta I'm sorry. I told them
dialog: everything, I figured it was all up.
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: It's alright Ransom, I'm glad you
dialog: did.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Not exactly everything though.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Is this about what Greatnana told
dialog: you? She saw me that night, she
dialog: mistook me for Ransom
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: We'll get to that. But first, Mr.
dialog: Hugh Ransom Drysdale, you might tell
dialog: us all why you hired me.
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: Why I hired you?
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: You're right, let's back up. To the
dialog: night of the party. Your argument
dialog: with Harlan. What were the overheard
text: words by the Nazi child masturbating
dialog: in the bathroom - "my will" and "I'm
dialog: warning you." You and Harlan were
dialog: “drama mamas," you shared a love of
text: twisting the knife into one another.
dialog: I don't believe he would have slipped
dialog: it in halfway - no, I submit that
dialog: Harlan told you everything.
scene_heading: INT. SMALL STUDY - NIGHT OF PARTY
text: Ransom and Harlan face each other.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: You can't be serious.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: Not a red dime or word of my work to
dialog: a single one of them, you included.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Marta, remind me what Ransom said his
dialog: conversation with Harlan ended with.
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Harlan told him that I could beat him
dialog: in GO.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: And I asked myself - Marta? Why
dialog: would the topic of the will have
dialog: steered around to Marta? There is
dialog: one obvious explanation...
scene_heading: INT. SMALL STUDY - NIGHT OF PARTY
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: You are not this crazy. You would
dialog: not just throw your fortune away
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: No. I'm giving it to Marta. All of
dialog: it.
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: Ha. To your Brazilian nurse are you
dialog: goddamn insane.
speaker_heading: HARLAN RANSOM
dialog: I'm sane for the first time I'm going to stop this
dialog: in my life and I've done it Harlan, I -
dialog: I've made the change to my
dialog: will it's done
speaker_heading: RANSOM (cont'd)
dialog: I'm warning you!
text: Push into a vent in the wall.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY
speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: That is some heavy duty conjecture.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Granted. But it's the only way what
dialog: comes next makes sense. So you storm
dialog: out, you drive off into the night.
dialog: You tell Marta later of what was it,
dialog: feeling an overwhelming sense of...
speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Clarity. That he has to make do for
dialog: himself from here on out.
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Exactly.
scene_heading: EXT. NORFOLK ROADS - NIGHT OF PARTY
text: Ransom's Porsche SKIDS TO A STOP on the side of the empty
text: road. Sits idling.
speaker_heading: BLANC (V.O.)
dialog: Marta. The will. Harlan. "You
dialog: won't get away with this." Do for
dialog: yourself. And a plan forms.
text: A beat. Then the Porsche roars into a skidding U-TURN and
dialog: drives back the way it came.
dialog: 109.
scene_heading: EXT. PRIVATE ROAD - NIGHT OF PARTY
text: Ransom's Porsche kills its lights and drives slowly down the
text: private road, hooking a left at the CARVED ELEPHANT that
text: marks the utility road.
speaker_heading: BLANC (V.O.)
dialog: You return, careful to avoid the
text: gate's security camera range.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - NIGHT OF PARTY
text: The Porsche parked, Ransom hacks his way through the woods.
speaker_heading: BLANC (V.O.)
text: Then on foot up towards the house,
scene_heading: EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE YARD - NIGHT OF PARTY
text: The party is still going on inside. Ransom slips through
text: the side gate, up towards the house, and up the trellis.
speaker_heading: BLANC (V.O.)
dialog: You sneak in, up the trellis so as
dialog: not to be seen by the rest of the
dialog: family, who are still having their
text: party downstairs.
scene_heading: INT. THIRD FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT OF PARTY
text: The painting wall swings aside, and Ransom climbs through,
text: leaving mud traces on the sill and the carpet. He heads
text: straight down the narrow hall and into Harlan's bedroom.
text: The party din from downstairs.
speaker_heading: BLANC (V.O.)
dialog: What you need to do will take
dialog: moments. But it is essential you are
text: alone, and undetected.
text: Ransom disappears into the darkened doorway.
speaker_heading: BLANC (V.O.) (cont'd)
dialog: You knew the medications Harlan took.
dialog: You knew what Marta would be
text: injecting him with that night.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: BLANC (V.O.) (cont'd)
dialog: And you knew if Marta was responsible
dialog: for his death, even unintentionally,
dialog: the slayer rule would nullify the
dialog: changed will, and you would get your
dialog: share back.
scene_heading: INT. HARLAN'S BEDROOM
text: Dark and still. Marta's medical bag, open. Ransom has
text: unwrapped two syringes and has the two vials out - the
dialog: Toradol and the morphine (the "good stuff.")
text: Using the syringes he extracts the liquid from both vials...
text: and then injects the liquids back into the opposite vials.
text: He SWITCHES THE MEDICATIONS.
speaker_heading: BLANC (V.O.)
dialog: You use the syringes in the kit to
dialog: switch the liquids in the two
dialog: medication vials. And as a final
dialog: precaution, you take the Naloxone,
dialog: the life saving antidote.

speaker_heading: BLANC

speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: If he did that, if the meds were

dialog: (oh my god)

dialog: But then I gave Harlan

speaker_heading: BLANC

speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: I... just knew
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: You knew because there is the
text: slightest, almost imperceptible
dialog: difference of tincture and viscosity
dialog: between the liquids. You knew
dialog: because you had done it a hundred

speaker_heading: MARTA
dialog: Then Harlan was...
speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: I'm sorry Marta. But yes. Harlan
dialog: was perfectly fine.
text: He unfolds the tox report and hands it to her.
speaker_heading: BLANC (cont'd)
dialog: His blood was normal. The cause of
dialog: death was truly, solely suicide, and
dialog: you are guilty of nothing but some

speaker_heading: BLANC
dialog: Not a shred no, just as we have no
dialog: real proof of Marta's mixing up the

speaker_heading: RANSOM
dialog: You have her confession!
