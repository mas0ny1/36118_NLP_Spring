scene_heading: 2	EXT. NASHVILLE AIRPORT - DAY
text: TRICYCLE MAN drives into parking lot and parks next to GREEN'S
text: old Chevy. TRICYCLE MAM: locks his machine and walks toward
text: coffee shop. GREEN gets out of his car, locks it, starts in the
text: same direction. NORMAN parks the limo, goes into main building.
scene_heading: 3	INT. AIRPORT - DAY
text: NORMAN is attracted to large CONNIE WHITE display.
scene_heading: 4	INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
text: At the entrance is another "CONNIE WHITE" display and from the
text: jukebox we hear one of her songs.
text: The waitress, SUELEEN, drops a fork, then gets another from an
text: overflowing sink and hands it to her customer, TRICYCLE MAN.
text: There are several people at the counter with him, including
text: GREEN, who has just walked in. Another man enters, DELBERT
text: REESE. SUELEEN waits on all of them.
text: A small black man comes out of the kitchen, carrying a tray full
dialog: or dishes. This is WADE.
speaker_heading: WADE
speaker_heading: (to SUELEEN)
dialog: You want a ride into town?
speaker_heading: SUELEEN
dialog: You bet.
text: REESE looks up, checking out SUELEEN, then WADE, then the
text: TRICYCLE MAN, then his breast pocket to see it his wallet and
text: checkbook are still there, then he buries himself in his
dialog: newspaper.
speaker_heading: SUELEEN
dialog: Got me an audition tonight.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Well, you just remember, if you
dialog: can't kick front, kick back, 'cause
dialog: at least you're kicking... Ten
dialog: minutes, okay?
text: She nods and talks to the TRICYCLE MAN. REESE keeps sneaking
text: looks at her.
speaker_heading: SUELEEN
dialog: I've just been waiting for the
dialog: right spot to sing in... I'm so
dialog: nervous...
text: She laughs and starts to rinse the dishes in the sink.
speaker_heading: SUELEEN
dialog: I'm good, though. There ain't but
dialog: one Sueleen Gay -- I don't mean to
dialog: be conceited, but really it's true.
dialog: I've been taking special coaching
dialog: lessons from Zeke Willard -- he's
dialog: just wonderful. Teaches you how to
dialog: phrase; that's really important.
dialog: And breathing. Well, you know all
dialog: about that. Anyway, I wrote this
dialog: song.
text: She looks down and then begins to half whisper, sing, and half do
text: all of the gestures for a song she has written as she wipes some
text: glasses. The jukebox continues to play CONNIE WHITE, and every
text: time someone walks by, Sueleen stops. She finally gets through
text: the song and discovers REESE has been watching, too. She looks
text: away from him to the TRICYCLE MAN, who smiles. Be has finished
text: his meal.
speaker_heading: SUELEEN
dialog: Oh, listen, I really do go on.
dialog: Here's your check. Sure has been
dialog: nice talking to you.
text: As she removes her apron, a HAVEN HAMILTON song comes on the
text: jukebox, "Keep on a goin'." The TRICYCLE MAN leaves.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 5	INT. CONTROL BOOTH - NASHVILLE STUDIO - DAY
text: We hear the last chorus or "Keep on a goin'" as sung by HAVEN,

text: He is always dressed in white. In the booth are BUD and LADY
text: PEARL. Also present are two engineers and a producer. HAVEN is
text: accompanied by a long haired piano player with a white sweater.
text: HAVEN is not too happy with him.
scene_heading: 6	ANOTHER ANGLE
text: OPAL enters the booth, carrying a too-large English tape
text: recorder. HAVEN Stops singing, mad at OPAL'S interruption and
text: the piano player. Through the glass we see him pantomiming
text: instructions for her to leave. As she does, HAVEN starts over.
scene_heading: 7	INT. HALLWAY - DAY
text: OPAL wanders to the next studio. BUD follows, apologizing.
speaker_heading: BUD
text: Sorry. He sees a tape recorder and
text: gets upset.
text: She looks at him.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: He's my father.
speaker_heading: OPAL
dialog: Haven Hamilton is your father? Can
dialog: you arrange an interview?
scene_heading: 8	INT. SECOND RECORDING BOOTH - DAY
text: They have entered a different control tooth. In the recording
text: portion, LINNEA and an all-black, male CHOIR sings a gospel song.
text: OPAL asks BUD who this group is.
scene_heading: 9	INT. FIRST CONTROL BOOTH - DAY
text: BUD returns. HAVEN has just exploded at the piano player and
text: starts to leave, yelling at the producer.
speaker_heading: HAVEN
dialog: Who the hell is playing piano? Get
dialog: that hippie out of here... He's got
dialog: a tin ear. I asked for Pig, dammit.
dialog: I'm moving on 'cause I gotta get to
dialog: the airport. When you get my
dialog: backups straight, then we'll talk
dialog: about cutting this tune here.
text: He heads for the hallway.
scene_heading: 10	INT. HALLWAY - DAY
text: It is jammed with black singers from the CHOIR. HAVEN hates
text: being crushed and moves through the congestion like a white
text: knight. OPAL moves near.
speaker_heading: OPAL
dialog: Excuse me, sir. I'm here putting
dialog: together a film. I would like to
dialog: ask some questions.
text: She has to fumble with the bulky tape machine and transformer.
speaker_heading: HAVEN
dialog: Foreigner?
speaker_heading: OPAL
dialog: I'm from BBC television.
speaker_heading: HAVEN
dialog: Where the hell is that?
text: HAVEN nod a politely and leaves the crowded hallway with BUD and
text: PEARL. He spots LINNEA.
speaker_heading: HAVEN
dialog: Linnea.
speaker_heading: LINNEA
dialog: How you doing, Haven?
speaker_heading: HAVEN

speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Late! Oh, Jesus!
text: He runs off.
scene_heading: 16	ANOTHER ANGLE
text: As NORMAN runs toward passenger loading, we see HAVEN'S jeep

text: REESE and TRIPLETTE approach the 'Barbara Jean' plane. BARNETT

speaker_heading: HAVEN
dialog: Delbert, how are you?
speaker_heading: REESE
dialog: I'm fine. This here is John

text: She's got a new album cut again.
dialog: She'll be down in a minute. But
dialog: she'll be late for the Opera if she
dialog: doesn't hurry. Bud, get the plane on
text: the walkie-talkie.
text: BUD fumbles on his walkie-talkie telephone, but can't seem to get
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: BUD
text: They don't seem to be answering.
dialog: The ambulance boys are here, though.
dialog: Barnett always expects them to get
dialog: there like a shot. That thing only
dialog: goes a hundred fall bore with the
text: sirens going.
speaker_heading: HAVEN
dialog: Thank you, Bud.
text: BUD nods like he has been complimented.
scene_heading: 17	ANGLE TOWARD PLANE
text: A wave of noise begins from the fans. The band and majorettes
text: and horses and ropers go into a rendition of one of her hit tunes
text: as BARBARA JEAN appears. Everyone is breaking their neck to see,
text: especially GLENN. HAVEN and REESE give her the first round of
text: applause, then go back to talking. TRIPLETTE has never been
text: exposed to anything quite like this before and stands a little in
dialog: awe of the situation.
text: When the twirling and tricking and music stop, BARBARA JEAN
text: descends the stairs.
speaker_heading: HAVEN
dialog: Bud, tell them to move the horses.
dialog: Promised this strip would be spic
dialog: and span.
text: He smiles and winks.
speaker_heading: REESE
dialog: Listen, we'll go get the car and
dialog: come back. This'l1 be going on for
dialog: a while.
speaker_heading: HAVEN
dialog: You bet. She's probably talking to
dialog: somebody about their sick child. You
dialog: know how she is.
text: They wave goodbye and head in the direction of the loading zone.
text: Behind them, the horse people disperse and get into their cars
text: and horse trailers, preparing to return to Nashville.

text: finds BILL and MARY. NORMAN speaks softly and out of breath,
text: trying to pretend he's on time.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Hi.
text: BILL slaps him on the back and engulfs him.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Hi, Norman.
text: NORMAN looks relieved. BILL and MARY have been arguing.
speaker_heading: NORMAN

speaker_heading: BILL

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Norman, how are you?
text: She kisses him and he blushes. BILL and MARY are glad to talk to

speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Fine. Just fine.
text: As they walk to the limo, we see a car with loudspeakers on top
text: of it and clearly written door signs that read: "Replacement
text: Party" in red, white and blue. REESE and TILIPLETTE are walking
text: toward it, shaking hands with several people.
speaker_heading: NORMAN

scene_heading: 22	ANGLE TOWARD RUNWAY
text: The orange ambulance has moved into the area near the plane and
text: there seems to be a great deal at activity.
text: REESE and TRIPLETTE'S car stops, and they rush out and run into
text: HAVEN, who is shouting for people to get the hell out of the way.
speaker_heading: 23	NEW ANGLE
text: Two ambulance ATTENDANTS cut through the crowd. HAVEN, TRIPLETTE

speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: How long was she out?
speaker_heading: BARNETT
dialog: Not too long. But she keeps
text: passing out.
text: She comes to and looks at them all.
speaker_heading: BARBARA JEAN
dialog: (oblivious)
dialog: Just give your manna that vitamin
dialog: E. Makes a world of difference.
speaker_heading: HAVEN
text: Here she is again.
text: She resists the ammonia, looks around and passes out again.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: Okay, let's get her to the wagon.
text: A stretcher is brought in and she is placed under oxygen. BARNETT
text: climbs into the ambulance with BARBARA JEAN, slamming the door on

speaker_heading: L.A. JOAN
dialog: You know anything about the

speaker_heading: GREEN
dialog: (hasn't heard)
dialog: It's hard to say. Doctors thought
dialog: she'd come home a week ago. All it
dialog: was was appendix.
speaker_heading: L.A. JOAN
dialog: All they got is advertisements.
dialog: Just like L.A.
speaker_heading: GREEN
dialog: Did an exploratory and according to
dialog: them, she needed an overhaul.
text: He chuckles at his prepared joke.
speaker_heading: L.A. JOAN
dialog: Well, I could use one, especially

speaker_heading: GREEN
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: L.A. JOAN
dialog: I said, maybe I'll change my name

speaker_heading: GREEN

speaker_heading: L.A. JOAN

dialog: The other one said that wasn't true.
dialog: Then the first said he looked just
dialog: like Eddie Black when he said

speaker_heading: HAVEN
dialog: Bud, would you be sure to get the

speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Ya... where do you want me to take

speaker_heading: HAVEN
dialog: Where you always take it. There's

speaker_heading: PEARL

speaker_heading: HAVEN

speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Okay. Anything you want me to say?
speaker_heading: HAVEN
dialog: Say I had to get back to the

speaker_heading: PEARL

speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Is that what you're going to sing?
text: She laughs.
speaker_heading: SUELEEN
dialog: No -- That's exercises. My coach
dialog: says you have to do exercise because
dialog: the vocal chords are muscle and need
dialog: to be stretched. Every time you
dialog: stretch them, the middle part sets
dialog: stronger. That's the place where I
dialog: sing.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: You think I got any kind of a

text: He breaks into a scale.
speaker_heading: SUELEEN

speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Is that good?
speaker_heading: SUELEEN
dialog: It's not bad.
speaker_heading: WADE

dialog: 'cause I can tell them that you're
