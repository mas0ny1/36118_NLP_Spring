scene_heading: EXT. TWO LANE HIGHWAY - PASADENA, CA — NIGHT
text: A 1967 MUSTANG FASTBACK sits parked on the side of a small,
text: two lane highway just outside a residential neighborhood. A
text: dark figure sits behind the wheel. Someone we cannot fully
dialog: see.
text: Random CARS drive past the scene.
scene_heading: INT. MUSTANG
text: A girly pink KEYRING hangs from the ignition. A picture of a
text: young BLONDE WOMAN and her boyfriend inside the small frame.
text: The girl looks to be high school age.
text: A pair of RUBBER GLOVED HANDS flip through the radio
text: channels, searching for music, listening to talk shows. He
text: gives up and pulls the keys out of the ignition.
scene_heading: ON THE REARVIEW MIRROR
text: A pair of dark, menacing eyes stare into the rearview mirror.
text: We stay on the mirror as this person steps out of the car.
text: We hear the driver's door slam shut.
speaker_heading: THUMP !
text: We watch on, from the rearview mirror, as this figure walks
text: around the car and to the trunk. He opens the trunk. Fast
text: enough so we can’t get a good look at his face.
text: A few moments pass.
scene_heading: A YOUNG BLONDE WOMAN
text: appears from behind the trunk. Her mouth gagged and her
text: hands tied. The dark figure and his hostage begin toward the
text: woods, out of frame and out of our view of the rearview
dialog: mirror.
scene_heading: EXT. MUSTANG - WINDSHIELD
text: A white piece of paper lays under the windshield wiper. It
text: reads OUT OF GAS.
scene_heading: INT. WOODS
text: The gagged woman ruffles through the forestry. She cries
text: out, through the cloth.
text: The dark figure walks some distance behind her, silent.
text: Suddenly...he forcefully pushes the girl to the ground.
text: She falls into the mud.
speaker_heading: SPLAT!
text: She quickly turns around, facing her captor.
text: The dark figure kneels down and digs through the filthy mud,
text: searching for the perfect stick or tree branch.
text: He picks up a long, thick, healthy branch and snaps it in
text: half. He throws the other half back into the dirt and pulls
text: out a pocket knife.
text: The girl watches on, a bit confused.
text: He has a seat on a nearby tree trunk and begins using the
text: blade to shave the branch down, sharper and sharper, making a
text: home made weapon of some sort.
text: The young woman simply watches in horror. She attempts to
text: stand, but the dark figure walks over and steps on her back,
text: pushing her face back into the dirt.
text: As the girl lays, face down on the ground, the dark figure
text: continues shaving the tree branch down into a sharp spear.
text: The girl watches as shavings from the branch hit the ground,
text: all around her.
text: The dark figure grabs her and turns her over, facing him. He
text: points the sharp stick directly at her eye. She instantly
text: turns away.
text: He then rubs the end of the stick across her eye lids as she
text: SCREAMS out in a panic. Afraid that he’ll puncture her eye,
text: the girl tries to lay as still as possible.
text: He simply rubs the stick across her eyes and cheeks, taking
text: in her fear. Enjoying himself.
text: Her eyes remain shut, scared he will pop one of them out with
text: his weapon.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The dark figure reaches back, as if he’s going to drive the
text: stick into her face. Instead, he drives it into the ground,
text: as hard as he can.
text: He reaches down and pulls the gag from her mouth. She
text: SCREAMS out in terror.
text: The dark figure slowly slides his hand down the front of his
dialog: pants.

scene_heading: EXT. PARK GROUNDS

text: Detective Reinhardt notices an unsavory looking fellow with

text: ARCHIE is old, fat and greasy. His white hair is spiked up,
text: desperate to appear hip and youthful. His silk shirt,
text: designer slacks and fancy shoes suggest money, but are a bit
text: too flashy for the time and place. He is busy pounding away
text: at a hot dog with all the works.
text: Detective Reinhardt begins toward him.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE

text: Archie laughs again.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE REINHARDT
dialog: I got the twelve hundred?
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: You waiting on a rainy day? Let's

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )

speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Pretty expensive habit you got

speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Hmm. Dinero sucio. Shame, shame.

speaker_heading: ARCHIE (0.8.)
dialog: See you next week, cop.

scene_heading: DETECTIVE REINHARDT
dialog: Listen to me. I want you to stop
dialog: calling the house. I don’t wanna

scene_heading: INT. WOODS
text: Jake hurries through the forest a bit faster and more
text: confident, now finding his way easier.
text: He stops when he looks up and notices a young BLONDE WOMAN,
text: hands tied to a tree and gagged at the mouth.
text: She stares up at Jake as she cries out in despair.
text: The back of her shirt has been torn all the way up with a
dialog: knife.
text: Her bare skin exposed and her bra strap showing.
text: Jake almost doesn’t notice the NAKED MAN standing some
text: distance behind her. He is somewhat hidden from view by the
text: thick shrubbery, but is visibly nude.
text: He is a young, thin man in his twenties, long, curly black
text: hair. So long, it curtails his face from view. He is
text: wearing rubber gloves and holding a long blade in his hand.
dialog: We‘ll call him THE SCARY MAN.
text: The scary man uses the knife to rip off the girl’s bra. She
text: SCREAMS out in a panic.
text: Jake slowly backs up, distancing himself from the scene
text: before he’s noticed. He trips over a thick log and falls
text: into the mud.
speaker_heading: SPLAT!
text: The scary man quickly turns his head, staring directly over
text: at young Jake. We only see close ups of his eyes and the
text: back of his head as he begins toward Jake.
text: Jake quickly stands and darts off, deeper into the woods.
text: The scary man charges after him. From different camera
text: angles, we see parts of his body as he runs. He’s completely
text: naked. His every move is smooth and robotic.

scene_heading: INT. WOODS

scene_heading: DETECTIVE REINHARDT
dialog: The little brat scared them off.
text: Detective Reinhardt begins back towards the park, but stops

speaker_heading: CASSIE

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Here you are suspended from school.
dialog: Your dad took your car keys. Most

dialog: in your life.
text: Cassie hangs up and hurries back into the living room,
text: getting in Jake’s face.
speaker_heading: CASSIE
dialog: Let me get something straight,

speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: CASSIE
dialog: Oh really?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: That way it was always his fault

speaker_heading: CASSIE
dialog: Well your brother’s full of crap
dialog: and so are you!
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You're right. Telling the entire

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You think I could get a soda? I’m

speaker_heading: CASSIE

speaker_heading: CASSIE
dialog: So after a couple years of non stop
dialog: begging and pleading with my

speaker_heading: DETECTIVE GRIMES
text: Looks like he busted his nose open
dialog: first with some sort of blunt

scene_heading: DETECTIVE REINHARDT

text: face down in the trunk of their own
text: cars. Literally hours after their
text: death. All asphyxiated. None of
dialog: the bodies sustaining any kind of
dialog: visible, physical damage. That
dialog: means he’s holding them for long
dialog: periods of time without actually
text: touching them. When he DOES
text: finally finish the job, he keeps it
dialog: clean. Painless. He also makes
dialog: sure we find them fast by parking
dialog: their cars in public places and
text: leaving the trunks open.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE REINHARDT
dialog: So if he’s not interested in sex,
dialog: why is he leaving them nude?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE GRIMES
dialog: We have a couple theories. One is
dialog: he can’t get it up. And maybe he
text: gets himself off by watching. The
text: other is he gets off by humiliating
text: the victim. That he’s undressing
dialog: them post-mortem.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE REINHARDT
dialog: And what do you think?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE GRIMES
dialog: I think our guy’s trying to tell us
dialog: something.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE REINHARDT
dialog: Like...?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE GRIMES
dialog: Like how strong he is. That these
dialog: prom queen types aren’t worth his
dialog: time. Think about it. You‘re this
dialog: lonely kid. You can’t get laid.
dialog: You've been turned down by every
dialog: chick in school. So you go pick

dialog: You wanna embarrass her and
text: humiliate her, just like she did to
dialog: you. But he doesn’t do it quickly.
text: He prolongs it. It’s like the
dialog: longer he goes without touching
dialog: these girls, the stronger he gets.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE REINHARDT
dialog: And what better place than the
dialog: woods? She could scream her lungs
dialog: out for hours and nobody would
dialog: hear.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE GRIMES
dialog: And he can’t let her go after what

scene_heading: DETECTIVE REINHARDT
dialog: When that becomes boring to him...

dialog: Just asphyxiated.

text: Detective Grimes takes notice of her strange behavior.
text: Janis breaks her silence.
speaker_heading: JANIS
dialog: When my Alex was fifteen, he was

dialog: this girl into the shower room

dialog: there for nearly three hours before
dialog: someone found them.
text: Detective Reinhardt and Grimes share another look.
speaker_heading: JANIS
text: First, he barricaded the room so
text: she couldn’t get out. Then he
text: stuck a knife to her throat and
dialog: dared her to scream out. But never
dialog: touched her. Not once. Just
text: watched her beg for her life.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE GRIMES
dialog: What happened to the girl?
speaker_heading: JANIS
text: The janitor found them before he
dialog: was able to...do anything. Because
dialog: the girl wasn’t hurt physically and
dialog: Alex had no prior record, the court
dialog: ordered him to a psychiatric hold
dialog: for thirty days.
text: Detective Reinhardt listens carefully. He’s getting his old
text: mind set back.
speaker_heading: JANIS
dialog: A lot of good that did. When he
dialog: was released, the doctors couldn’t

speaker_heading: DETECTIVE GRIMES
dialog: Did you believe him?
speaker_heading: JANIS
dialog: Yes I did. It seemed like he was

dialog: warning.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE REINHARDT
dialog: How long has he been gone?
speaker_heading: JANIS
dialog: It was almost six months ago. He
dialog: packed some clothes and his camp

dialog: from him since.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE REINHARDT
dialog: Camp gear?
speaker_heading: JANIS
dialog: Alex had a tent. He used to like
dialog: to go camping with his father
dialog: before he died. To tell you the

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Why couldn’t we get any scary

speaker_heading: CASSIE
dialog: Because scary movies are stupid and

speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: CASSIE

text: Cassie backs up a bit, in shock.
text: An ARM reaches from under the car and grabs her ankle.

text: He slowly begins toward her. He holds out the gun, ready to
dialog: fire.
text: All the color drops from Cassie’s face. She’s a sitting
dialog: duck.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: CASSIE

speaker_heading: JAKE

dialog: decided to kick my heart in and
dialog: embarrass me in front of my

text: This catches Cassie’s attention. She can relate.
speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: CASSIE

speaker_heading: CASSIE

speaker_heading: CASSIE

speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: He‘s coming.
text: THE FOOTSTEPS STOP AT THE DOOR

speaker_heading: CASSIE

speaker_heading: JAKE

text: Her eyes wide and focused.
speaker_heading: CASSIE
dialog: Look. My Dad gave me real simple

dialog: If you get killed, I'm never gonna

text: He pushes her against a wall, pulling her arm behind her

dialog: if we make it off the stairs, we
text: still have to get past the door.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What're we supposed to do? We

speaker_heading: CASSIE

dialog: would've done it by now.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: So what does he want? What is he

speaker_heading: CASSIE
dialog: There was this kid who the police
dialog: department liked for it. An ex
text: boyfriend of the victim. A rich
dialog: kid named Danny Myers. The media
dialog: hated this kid. He was really
text: arrogant and cocky. He even
dialog: bragged about how he wished he was
text: the one who killed her. The TV and
dialog: newspapers made him out to be the
dialog: killer before all the evidence was
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I remember. It was all over TV.
dialog: Your dad was the head detective
dialog: back then, wasn’t he?
text: Cassie nods.
speaker_heading: CASSIE
dialog: They were putting a lot of pressure
dialog: on my Dad to put him away. When he
dialog: couldn’t get any evidence against

dialog: investigation. They found out he
dialog: took money from this kid’s parents.
dialog: Twenty thousand dollars.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: They paid your Dad off?
speaker_heading: CASSIE
dialog: My Dad had all these outstanding
dialog: football debts. He bet a lot back
dialog: then. Until these men came to the
dialog: house one night and told him if he
dialog: didn’t come up with twenty grand by
dialog: the end of the week, my mother and
dialog: I would disappear. So he told the
dialog: Myers, for the right price, he’d

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: But what about Myers? Did he do

speaker_heading: CASSIE

dialog: guy was more of a loner. Not
dialog: popular like this other kid.
dialog: Someone who wasn’t good with girls.
dialog: Someone who had either killed
dialog: before or was gonna kill again.
dialog: Myers had a clean record. He
dialog: didn’t fit the profile.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: So what happened to him?
speaker_heading: CASSIE
dialog: To Myers? Nothing. This same
dialog: killer murdered five other girls
dialog: since my Dad was thrown off the
dialog: force. Danny Myers had a solid
dialog: alibi for all of them. It couldn’t
dialog: have been him.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: So the guy I saw in the woods today
dialog: was the real killer?
speaker_heading: CASSIE
dialog: He must‘ve seen you with my Dad and
dialog: decided to follow you home.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: But why doesn’t he just kill us and
dialog: get it over with?
speaker_heading: CASSIE
dialog: I don't know. Maybe we’re like his

dialog: planning on using us as bait for my
dialog: father. One thing’s for sure. We

dialog: him to kill us.
speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: CASSIE

speaker_heading: CASSIE
dialog: I’m gonna go for the garage. He’ll

speaker_heading: JAKE
