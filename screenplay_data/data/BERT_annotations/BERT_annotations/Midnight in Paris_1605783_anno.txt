speaker_heading: GIL
dialog: You do?
speaker_heading: HEMINGWAY
dialog: If it's bad I'll hate it because I

speaker_heading: GIL

dialog: Gauguin.
speaker_heading: ADRIANA
dialog: Ohmigoodness - hello - enchante -
dialog: (ad-lib hellos best they
dialog: can)
dialog: (to Gil)
dialog: Isn't this thrilling? You see the
dialog: sketch he's made? Nobody can draw
dialog: like that today - not Pablo, not
dialog: Matisse -
text: We see fine drawing, Lautrec style.
speaker_heading: GIL
dialog: Parlez Anglais?

speaker_heading: ADRIANA

speaker_heading: GAUGUIN
dialog: La Renaissance est beaucoup mieux -
dialog: better to have lived during the
dialog: Renaissance.
speaker_heading: ADRIANA
dialog: No - this is the Golden Age - L'Age
dialog: D'or.
speaker_heading: DEGAS
dialog: Pas do tout - la Renaissance -
dialog: c'etait mieux - leur vetements sont
dialog: tres, tres modernes, tres
dialog: originaux.
speaker_heading: ADRIANA
dialog: He says your clothes are very
dialog: modern and original.
speaker_heading: GIL
dialog: Er - yes - Monsieur Lauren - Ralph.
dialog: (to Gauguin)
dialog: Shouldn't you be in Tahiti?
speaker_heading: GAUGUIN
dialog: I? What? Yes - I live on the
dialog: island - a much better life than
dialog: here - better there - but then I
dialog: miss Paris - up and back - Qu'est
dialog: que vous faites dans la vie?
speaker_heading: ADRIANA
dialog: What do I do? Je suis etudiante.
dialog: En haute couture - fashion designer

speaker_heading: DEGAS
dialog: Ah ga compte pour les vetements

speaker_heading: ADRIANA
dialog: Ballet costumes - my god - I don't
dialog: live here. I mean I do but I
dialog: don't. Je n'habite pas ici.
speaker_heading: GIL
dialog: I wouldn't get into too many
dialog: details with them. Let's just
dialog: leave it that we're temporarily
text: passing through.
speaker_heading: ADRIANA
dialog: (to Gil)
dialog: Can I speak with you a minute?
dialog: (to table)
dialog: Permettez-moi de m'absenter un
dialog: instant.
dialog: (she gets him off)
dialog: Let's never go back to the
dialog: twenties.
speaker_heading: GIL
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: ADRIANA
dialog: I think we should stay here - it's
dialog: the start of the Belle Epoque -
dialog: this is the greatest, most
dialog: beautiful era Paris has ever known.
speaker_heading: GIL
dialog: But I love the Jazz Age.
speaker_heading: ADRIANA
text: The twenties are full of strife and
dialog: uncertainty. But think of it, Gil -
dialog: the two of us - in a lovely art
dialog: nouveau home - I'll work in the
dialog: fashion world - I love the styles -
dialog: you can write ··· it's the age of
dialog: Debussy and Guimard. Maybe you can
dialog: meet Balzac.
speaker_heading: GIL
dialog: But what happened to the twenties
dialog: and the Charleston and Cole Porter?
speaker_heading: ADRIANA
dialog: That's the present, it's dull.
dialog: 81
dialog: 70 70
speaker_heading: CONTD: (5)
speaker_heading: GIL
dialog: It's not the present for me - I'm
dialog: from 2010.
speaker_heading: ADRIANA
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: GIL
dialog: I dropped in on you just the way we
dialog: dropped in on the 1890's.
speaker_heading: ADRIANA
dialog: You did?
speaker_heading: GIL
dialog: I wanted to escape my present just
dialog: like you wanted to escape yours.
dialog: To a golden age.
speaker_heading: ADRIANA
dialog: Surely you don't think the twenties
dialog: are a golden age?
speaker_heading: GIL
dialog: To me they are.
speaker_heading: ADRIANA
dialog: But I'm from the twenties and I'm
dialog: tellin~ you the golden age is the
dialog: Belle Epoque.
speaker_heading: GIL
dialog: Yes but don't you see - to these
dialog: guys the golden age was the
dialog: Renaissance. They'd all trade the
dialog: Belle Epoque to paint alongside
dialog: Michelangelo or Titian. And those
dialog: guys probably imagine life was
dialog: better when Kubla Khan was around.
dialog: I'm having an insight. A minor one
dialog: but that accounts for the anxiety
dialog: of my dream.
speaker_heading: ADRIANA
dialog: What dream?
speaker_heading: GIL
dialog: Last night I dreamed I ran out of
dialog: zithromax - and then I went to the
dialog: dentist and there was no novacaine -
dialog: these people have no antibiotics -
dialog: 82
dialog: 70 70
speaker_heading: CONTD: (6)
speaker_heading: ADRIANA
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: GIL
dialog: And even in the twenties - no
dialog: dishwashers - no 911 if your
dialog: appendix bursts - no "movies on
dialog: demand" ·
speaker_heading: ADRIANA
dialog: But if we love each other what does
dialog: it matter when we live?
speaker_heading: GIL
dialog: Because if you stay here and this
dialog: becomes your present, sooner or
dialog: later you'll imagine another time
dialog: was really the golden time. And so
dialog: will I - I'm beginning to see why
dialog: it can't work, Adriana. The
dialog: present has a hold on you because
dialog: it's your present and while there's
dialog: never any progress in the most
dialog: important things, you get to
dialog: appreciate - what little progress
dialog: is made - the internet - Pepto-
dialog: Bismol. The present is always
text: going to seem unsatisfying because
dialog: life itself is unsatisfying -
dialog: that's why Gauguin goes back and
dialog: forth between Paris and Tahiti,
dialog: searching - it's my job as a writer
dialog: to try and come up with reasons why
dialog: despite life being tragic and
text: unsatisfying, it's still worth it.
speaker_heading: ADRIANA
dialog: That's the problem with writers -
dialog: you're all so full of words - but
dialog: I'm more emotional. I'm going to
dialog: stay and live in Paris' most
dialog: glorious time. You made a choice
dialog: to leave Paris once and you
dialog: regretted it.
speaker_heading: GIL
dialog: Yes, that one I regretted but it
dialog: was a real choice and I made the
dialog: wrong one. This is a choice
dialog: between accepting reality or
text: surreal insanity.
dialog: 83
speaker_heading: CONTD: (7)
dialog: 70 70
speaker_heading: ADRIANA
dialog: So finally you do love Inez more
dialog: than me.
speaker_heading: GIL
dialog: No - I love you - but this way lies
dialog: madness - and if I'm ever going to
dialog: write anything worthwhile I've got
dialog: to get rid of my illusions and that
dialog: I'd be happier in the past is one
dialog: of them.
speaker_heading: ADRIANA

dialog: reads as well when you're done
dialog: you'll have something of value.
speaker_heading: GIL
dialog: (taking it back)
dialog: Thank you. I can't tell you how
dialog: much this means to me.
speaker_heading: STEIN
dialog: Hemingway who read your chapters

speaker_heading: GIL
dialog: From Ernest Hemingway. He thought
text: it out and it makes perfect sense.
speaker_heading: INEZ
dialog: Gil, your brain tumor's acting up
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: GIL
dialog: There's nothing crazy about Ernest
dialog: Hemingway or Gertrude Stein or
dialog: Fitzgerald or Salvador Dali -
speaker_heading: INEZ

speaker_heading: INEZ
dialog: You're a raving lunatic.
speaker_heading: GIL
dialog: I guess I'm too trusting. I'm
dialog: jealous and also trusting -
dialog: cognitive dissonance, Scott
dialog: Fitzgerald speaks of it.
speaker_heading: INEZ
dialog: Gil -
speaker_heading: GIL
dialog: I know it Inez - you can fool me
dialog: but not Hemingway.
speaker_heading: INEZ
dialog: Jesus Christ I'm dealing with a
dialog: madman - okay - Paul and I had a
dialog: few nights alone. We danced, we
dialog: drank - you were always working -
dialog: he's very attractive, he spoke to
dialog: me in French - the whole mystique
dialog: of this corny city got to me - it's
dialog: over. We can put this all in
text: perspective at home.
speaker_heading: GIL
dialog: I'm not going back.
speaker_heading: INEZ
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GIL
dialog: I'm staying here. It's not the
text: romantic fling. Paris is Paris.
dialog: It's that I'm not in love with you.
speaker_heading: INEZ
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GIL
dialog: A lot has happened to me since we
dialog: got here. I won't begin to bore

speaker_heading: GIL

dialog: Dali and Scott and Zelda -
speaker_heading: INEZ
dialog: Honey, you better listen to
dialog: yourself. You're a psycho. You
dialog: don't know what you're doing. You
