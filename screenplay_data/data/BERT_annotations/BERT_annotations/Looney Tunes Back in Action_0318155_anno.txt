text: A dark figure drops down in its path. It’s DAFFY. He

text: claw grabs for him; he leaps aside. He jumps on the claw.
text: Daffy is hoisted skyward. He spies a small open panel on
text: the calliope. It is a maze of wires and circuits. In
text: DAFFY'S COMPUTER-LIKE MIND, the circuits are analyzed in
text: 3-D and the system’s Achilles Heel is located.
text: A grim Daffy plucks a feather from his chin and directs

text: DJ deflects/catches dozens of deadly darts; Daffy is
text: multiply pierced.
text: DJ flips over a pit; Daffy falls in and crawls out
text: covered with scorpions.
text: DJ runs up the wall to avoid flames shooting from the
text: mouths of stone monkey reliefs. Daffy staggers out of the
text: flames, a cinder with eyes.
text: DJ leaps backwards, as if high jumping, between two
text: slicing scimitars. The scimitars slice Daffy into four
text: pieces, each piece is swallowed by a separate snapping
text: Venus Flytrap. A flytrap comes for DJ; he punches it and
text: knocks it unconscious.
text: A few feet ahead, Daffy grows out of the ground as a

text: With an ANCIENT CREAKING SOUND the monkey-shaped mosaic

text: The ground TREMBLES.
text: Everyone turns in half-horror to see what happens next.

text: DJ is suddenly lifted up into the air, cell phone leading
dialog: the way. It’s headed right for:
scene_heading: MR. SMITH’S FACE
text: The cell phone attaches to his cheek with a CLANG.
text: Mr. Smith reels backward, taking DJ with him. DJ releases
text: the phone, which remains stuck to Mr. Smith’s face.
speaker_heading: DJ (CONT'D)
dialog: Iron jaw. I suspected as much.
text: Cave Kate sidles up next to DJ, AFFECTIONATELY GRUNTING,
text: and starts grooming him. DJ tries to ignore this.
speaker_heading: MR. CHAIRMAN
dialog: Very clever. Now the diamond.
dialog: (hand out)
dialog: Gimme.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: What? So you can turn everyone in
dialog: the world into monkeys?
speaker_heading: MR. CHAIRMAN
dialog: Don’t be ridiculous. We are going
dialog: to use the diamond's power to
dialog: super-evolve ourselves, placing us
dialog: above all others and giving us an
text: unbeatable edge in a tight
dialog: marketplace.
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: We may turn some people into
dialog: monkeys.
dialog: (turning)
text: Mr. Smith, dismantle him.
text: Mr. Smith starts to advance on DJ, who is trapped against
text: the edge of the chasm. He looks to Daffy. He’s sleeping
text: peacefully, diamonds circling his head. Neanderthal Bugs
text: is digging a hole. Cave Kate is picking insects off of
text: Neanderthal Bugs. Monkey Damien raises his hands in a
text: what-can-I-do gesture. Mr. Smith is getting close...

scene_heading: SFX: STEAM WHISTLE
text: Mr. Smith drops his guard, walks to a nearby tree on
text: which is a time clock like the one we saw at Acme
text: headquarters, and punches out.
speaker_heading: MR. CHAIRMAN (CONT’D)
dialog: What are you doing!
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: I gotta have an eight-hour
text: turnaround between shifts.
dialog: Howard?
text: The elephant ambles over to join his colleague.
speaker_heading: ELEPHANT
dialog: I could go for a cold one.
speaker_heading: MR. CHAIRMAN
dialog: You can’t leave now!
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Take it up with the Teamsters.
speaker_heading: MR. CHAIRMAN
dialog: (backing off)
dialog: No, no, it needn’t come to that.
text: Mr. Smith (the cell phone still attached to his face) and
text: the elephant walk away. Mr. Chairman turns back to DJ,
text: annoyed. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out the
text: Tasmanian Devil’s mouth. He reaches deep into the mouth,
text: and “pulls” Taz right side out again.
text: Taz spins, spits and slobbers.
speaker_heading: MR. CHAIRMAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Now, which of your little animal
dialog: friends shall I have him eat
dialog: first?
text: DJ realizes he has lost. He hands the diamond over.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: I’m never buying anything from
dialog: ACME ever again.
speaker_heading: MR. CHAIRMAN
dialog: You won’t have much choice.
text: Mr. Chairman turns to exit, only to find standing in his
text: path one very angry Tweety bird.

speaker_heading: TWEETY
dialog: Where do you think you're going?
text: Mr. Chairman takes this in. He LAUGHS.
speaker_heading: MR. CHAIRMAN
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Ooh, what will I do now?
dialog: (gestures to Taz)
dialog: Eat the birdy.
text: Taz approaches Tweety, gnashing.
text: DJ takes a chance: he runs, launches off a rock and flips
text: over Mr. Chairman, plucking the diamond from above. DJ
text: lands and points it at Tweety. Light strikes it. A blue
text: beam shoots out and hits Tweety. The little bird glows
text: blue. He staggers back, and falls over the edge.
speaker_heading: MR. CHAIRMAN (CONT'D)
text: Entertaining, if pointless.
dialog: (to DJ)
dialog: My diamond, please?
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: No problem. Say, did you know that
dialog: birds descended from dinosaurs?
scene_heading: A GIGANTIC YELLOW PTEROSAUR 197
text: appears, flapping its wings. It has abnormally large
text: eyes. The voice is DEEP and has REVERB, but is
text: unmistakable.
scene_heading: TWEETY PTEROSAUR
dialog: You are a very bad man.
speaker_heading: MR. CHAIRMAN
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: Well, I try.
text: Pterosaur Tweety swallows Mr. Chairman in one GULP. He
text: SPITS out the diamond.
text: Pterosaur Tweety looks at Taz. Taz backs away, Woody
text: Allen-style, then turns tail and runs.
text: Monkey Damien scampers up and jumps on DJ’s shoulder. The
text: monkey “hugs” DJ’s head.

text: DJ, with Tweety on his shoulder, hugs Kate as they walk

speaker_heading: TWEETY
dialog: My tummy hurts.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: Dad, this is Kate. Kate, Dad.
text: Kate hands Damian her card.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: We should have lunch sometime.
dialog: Your franchise is growing a little
dialog: stale. I can help.
text: DJ pinches her affectionately. She laughs. Tweety burps.
text: Behind them are Daffy and Bugs, both in less good moods.
speaker_heading: DAFFY
dialog: (rubbing head)
dialog: I can’t believe after all that, we
dialog: had to throw the diamond in the
dialog: lava just because it could bring
dialog: about the downfall of mankind...
speaker_heading: BUGS
dialog: I can’t believe Tweety got to
dialog: waltz in at the end and be the
dialog: hero.
speaker_heading: DAFFY
dialog: Now you know how I feel.
speaker_heading: BUGS
dialog: You know, Daffy, you’re right.
dialog: From now on, you and I are going

dialog: you.

dialog: as the major Looney Tunes (even the formerly evil ones)
text: all join in the celebration.
text: DJ and Kate walk off together. They pass the real BRENDAN
text: FRASER, who’s reading a copy of Mad Magazine with his
text: caricature on the cover. DJ reenters frame and addresses
dialog: Brendan.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: Hey, remember me? I threatened
dialog: your “manliness” so you got me
dialog: fired?
speaker_heading: BRENDAN FRASER
dialog: I’m sorry, man. I get a lot of
dialog: people fired and... I just, I
dialog: can’t place the face...
text: DJ punches Brendan in the jaw, dropping him. DJ exits

speaker_heading: DAFFY (0.S.)
dialog: Hello? Help?
text: PAN BACK to Daffy, still trapped under the stone monkey.
speaker_heading: DAFFY (CONT'D)
dialog: Key grip?
text: The “real” Daffy strolls in, wearing a robe and sipping a
