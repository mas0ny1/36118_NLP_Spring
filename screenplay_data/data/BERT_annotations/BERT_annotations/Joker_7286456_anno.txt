speaker_heading: AN ORIGIN
dialog: Written by
dialog: Todd Phillips &amp; Scott Silver
dialog: 13 April 2018
text: This story takes place in its own universe. It has no
dialog: connection to any of the DC films that have come before it.
text: We see it as a classic Warner Bros. movie. Gritty, intimate
text: and oddly funny, the characters live in the real world and
dialog: the stakes are personal.
text: Although it is never mentioned in the film, this story takes
dialog: place in the past.
dialog: Let's call it 1981.
dialog: It's a troubled time. The crime rate in Gotham is at record
text: highs. A garbage strike has crippled the city for the past
dialog: six weeks. And the divide between the "haves" and the "have-
text: nots" is palpable. Dreams are beyond reach, slipping into
dialog: delusions.
speaker_heading: OVER BLACK:
text: HEAR LAUGHTER.
text: The sound of a man totally cracking up.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: 1 INT. DEPT. OF HEALTH, OFFICE - MORNING 1
text: CLOSE ON JOKER (30's), tears in his eyes from laughing so
text: hard. He's trying to get it under control. His greasy, black
text: hair is matted down. He's wearing an old, faded red hooded
text: zip-up sweatshirt, a threadbare gray scarf, thin from years
text: of use, hangs loosely around his neck.
text: WE NOTICE TWO FADED OLD SCARS cut at the corners of his
text: mouth. Almost forming a smile.
text: He's sitting across from an overworked SOCIAL WORKER (50's),
text: African American. Her office is cramped and run-down in a
text: cramped and run-down building. Stacks of folders piled high
text: in front of her.
text: She just sits behind her desk, waiting for his laughing fit
text: to end, she's been through this before. Finally it subsides.
text: Joker takes a deep breath, pauses to see if it's over.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: --is it just me, or is it getting
dialog: crazier out there?
text: Despite the laughter, there's real pain in his eyes.
text: Something broken in him. Looks like he hasn't slept in days.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: It's certainly tense. People are
text: upset, they're struggling. Looking
dialog: for work. The garbage strike seems
text: like it's been going on forever.
dialog: These are tough times.
dialog: (then)
dialog: How 'bout you. How's the job? Still
dialog: enjoying it?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Yeah, I mean, it's different each
dialog: day, so I really like that. I don't
dialog: think I could ever work in an
text: office. Behind a desk.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: JOKER (CONT'D)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: No offense.
text: She smiles. Writes something down. Looks at the clock, she's
text: running late for her next appointment.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: Have you been keeping up with your
dialog: journal?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Everyday.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: Great. Did you bring it with you?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (dodging the subject)
dialog: I'm sorry. Did I bring what?
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: (impatient; she doesn't
dialog: have time for this)
dialog: Arthur, last time I asked you to
dialog: bring your journal with you. For
dialog: these appointments. Do you have it?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Yes ma'am.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: Can I see it?
text: He reluctantly reaches into his bag. Pulls out a weathered
text: notebook. Slides it across to her--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I've been using it as a journal,
dialog: but also a joke diary. Funny
dialog: thoughts or, or observations-- Did
dialog: I tell you I'm pursuing a career in
dialog: stand-up comedy?
text: She's half-listening as she flips through his journal.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: No. You didn't.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I think I did.
dialog: 3.
text: She doesn't respond, keeps flipping through his journal--
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: Oh yeah. Because of what your
dialog: mother said,-- about your purpose.
dialog: "To bring laughter and joy to the
dialog: world," right?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Right.
text: ANGLE ON JOURNAL, pages and pages of notes, all in neat,
text: angry-looking handwriting. Also, cut out photos from hardcore
text: pornographic magazines and some crude handmade drawings.
text: A flash of anger crosses Joker's face. We see him picking at
text: his right eyebrow, almost obsessively. Trying to stay calm.
text: His eyebrow is actually half-gone. Something he does a lot.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I didn't realize you wanted to read
dialog: it.
text: The social worker gives him a look, then reads something in
text: the pages that gives her pause.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: (reading out loud)
dialog: "I just hope my death makes more
dialog: sense than my life."
text: She looks up at Joker. He just stares back. Lets it hang out
text: there for a beat.
text: Then he laughs a little, even though he doesn't think it's
dialog: funny--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Yeah. I mean, that's just--
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: Does my reading it upset you?
text: He leans in.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: No. I just,-- some of it's
dialog: personal. You know?
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: I understand. I just want to make
dialog: sure you're keeping up with it.
text: She slides his journal back to him. He holds it in his lap.
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: What about your mom? How's she
dialog: feeling?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: She has good days. But mostly bad.
dialog: It's been a big help having me
dialog: there. She really needs me.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: Seems like she's been sick a lot
dialog: since you got home.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Yeah, it's good I'm there. When I
dialog: was in the hospital, after my last
dialog: episode-- she was having trouble
dialog: getting over there to visit.
text: She looks back up at the clock, she needs to get to her next
dialog: appointment.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: All right. So, I'll see you again,
dialog: two weeks from today?
text: He nods. But keeps sitting there for a moment.
text: She stands up, trying to signal it's time for him to leave--
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: Is there something else I can help
dialog: you with, Arthur? My next
dialog: appointment is waiting.
text: He just keeps sitting there.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Yeah, I was wondering if you could
dialog: ask the doctor to increase the
dialog: dosage on my medications? Nothing
dialog: seems to make a difference.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: (looking over his record)
dialog: Do you know which ones you'd like
dialog: increased?
text: Shakes his head, no.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: Have you been sleeping?
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (lying)
dialog: Some.
text: She glances at his file again.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: Arthur, you're on seven different
dialog: medications. Surely they must be
dialog: doing something.
text: He finally stands up. Zips up his faded red sweatshirt.
dialog: Looks at her--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I just don't wanna feel so bad
dialog: anymore.
scene_heading: CUT TO BLACK:
speaker_heading: TITLE:
speaker_heading: JOKER
scene_heading: 2 EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE, MIDTOWN - KENNY'S MUSIC SHOP - DAY 2
text: GOTHAM SQUARE IS CLOGGED WITH TRAFFIC. Non-stop honking
text: horns, pedestrians crowding the sidewalk. Huge billboards,
text: giant movie marquees, garbage bags piled high everywhere.
text: Underneath it all we hear a TINKLING PIANO playing something
text: bouncy and fast-paced.
text: FROM ACROSS THE BUSY CITY STREET, we see Joker. He's dressed
text: as a sad-faced HOBO CLOWN. This is his job.
text: Dressed in tattered clothes, dark five o'clock shadow painted
text: on his face, big bulbous red nose, his mouth's outlined in
text: white, turned down at the corners.
text: He's holding up a sign in front of Kenny's Music Shop that
text: reads, "EVERYTHING MUST GO!" A banner above the store reads,
text: "GOING OUT OF BUSINESS!" Behind him, an OLD MAN plays a piano
text: on the street. Both of them there to draw attention to the
text: big sale going on in the store.
text: Joker's doing a little Charlie Chaplin like waddle to the
text: music. Most people walk right past, ignoring him. A few bump
text: into him by mistake.
text: JOKER SEES A GROUP OF FIVE BOYS, no more than 15-years-old,
text: walking toward him. He moves out of their way. They crack up
text: laughing when they see him. Start making fun of him.
dialog: 6.
text: Joker ignores them, tries to do his job the best he can while
text: maintaining some dignity. Keeps dancing and holding up the
dialog: sign.
text: One of the kids knocks the sign out of Joker's hands--
speaker_heading: KID #1
dialog: Suck my dick, clown.
text: The kids laugh. Joker doesn't say anything. Just bends over
dialog: to pick up the sign--
text: Another kid kicks him in the ass--
speaker_heading: KID #2
dialog: Whoops.
text: Joker falls face first onto the sidewalk. Oddly, the old man
text: playing the piano picks up the pace of the music--
text: The kids crack up. One of the boys grabs Joker's sign and
text: takes off running across the street--
text: The other kids follow, weaving through traffic--
text: Joker gets up and gives chase. He needs his sign back.
text: He almost gets hit by a taxi, spinning out of the way just in
text: time-- Spinning right into another taxi that stops just short
dialog: of hitting him.
text: Joker keeps running through traffic. People stare. A clown
dialog: barreling down the street has got to be a joke--
scene_heading: 3 EXT. CORNER, SIDE STREET - GOTHAM SQUARE - CONTINUOUS 3
text: The five boys are booking it down the crowded street laughing
text: and whooping it up. At the last second they take a sharp
text: right turn down a cross street--
text: Joker almost overshoots the corner, slip-sliding in his big
dialog: red shoes--
text: He rights himself and heads down after them--
dialog: Sees them running up ahead--
text: WHAP! Out of nowhere Joker gets hit in the face!
text: He falls to the ground.
text: One of the kids was hiding between parked cars and hit Joker
text: with the "EVERYTHING MUST GO!" sign, splintering it in two--
dialog: 7.
text: The other kids turn back and walk up to Joker down on the
dialog: ground.
text: Joker reaches out, still trying to save the sign--
text: THE KIDS START KICKING AND BEATING THE SHIT out of Joker.
text: It's brutal and vicious. Nobody on the street stops to help.
text: CLOSE ON JOKER'S HOBO CLOWN FACE, down on the ground. Sweat
text: running down his face, smearing his make-up. He doesn't even
text: look like he's in pain. He just takes the beating.
text: That stupid frown painted on his face.
scene_heading: 4 INT. CITY BUS (PULLING OUT) - HEADING DOWNTOWN - DUSK 4
text: Joker, makes his way toward the back of the crowded bus, now
text: walking with a slight limp, but keeping his head held high.
text: His make-up's washed off, costume and props all shoved into a
text: big shopping bag slung over his shoulder. Some white grease-
text: paint still smudged on the sides of his face.
text: He finds an empty seat in the back of the bus. Sees a sad-
text: eyed FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL, face puffy from crying, sitting on
text: her knees looking back at him. Her mother's facing forward,
text: but even from behind you can tell she's angry.
text: Joker sees the sad-eyed girl staring straight back at him. He
text: doesn't know where to look, feeling self-conscious and small.
text: He gets back into "character" smiling like a clown and covers
text: his face with his hands-- Starts playing the peek-a-boo game
dialog: with her.
text: The girl stares back at him for a moment then giggles--
speaker_heading: WOMAN ON BUS
dialog: (turns back to Joker;
dialog: already annoyed)
dialog: Can you please stop bothering my
dialog: kid?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I wasn't bothering her, I was--
speaker_heading: WOMAN ON BUS
dialog: (interrupts)
dialog: Just stop.
text: AND SUDDENLY JOKER STARTS TO LAUGH. LOUD. He covers his mouth
text: trying to hide it-- Shakes his head, laughter pausing for a
text: moment, but then it comes on stronger. His eyes are sad. It
text: actually looks like the laughter causes him pain.
dialog: 8.
text: People on the bus are staring. The girl looks like she's
text: going to cry again.
speaker_heading: WOMAN ON BUS
dialog: You think that's funny?
text: Joker shakes his head no, but he can't stop laughing. He
text: reaches in his pocket and pulls out a small card. Hands it to
dialog: the woman.
text: CLOSE ON THE CARD, it reads: "Forgive my laughter. I have a
dialog: condition (more on back)"
text: She turns the card over and there is a bunch of information
dialog: in small writing--
text: "It's a medical condition causing sudden, frequent, uncontrollable laughter that
dialog: doesn't match how you feel. It can happen in people with a brain injury or certain
dialog: neurological conditions."
dialog: She doesn't read it (but if you freeze frame the movie you
text: could). She just shakes her head annoyed and throws the card
text: on the ground.
text: Joker laughs harder. Tears running down his face.
dialog: Not wanting to attract any more attention to himself, he
text: pulls up his red hood, and uses his threadbare scarf to cover
text: his mouth, trying to muffle the laughter.
text: He looks out at the city passing him by.
scene_heading: 5 EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE, STREETS - GOTHAM - EVENING 5
text: The bus pulls away, sun almost gone.
text: Joker heads slowly down the litter-covered streets. Garbage
text: is piled along the sidewalks, the air thick with smog creates
text: a haze over everything.
text: The streets are crowded with the poor, the elderly and
text: disenfranchised. Women with children in busted strollers.
text: Homeless people sleeping on subway grates. Stray dogs. His is
text: one of the few white faces.
text: Joker makes his way into a run-down drug store, behind him
text: two drunks fight on the corner, beating the shit out of each
dialog: other. Joker, and nobody else for that matter, pays them any
dialog: attention.
dialog: No one here gives a shit.
dialog: 9.
scene_heading: 6 INT. LOBBY, APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING 6
text: A shabby lobby in a building that was once probably pretty
dialog: nice, but now it's a dump.
text: Joker checks his mailbox. He's holding a small white
text: (prescription) bag in his hand.
text: The mailbox is empty.
scene_heading: 7 INT. ELEVATOR, APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 7
text: Joker steps onto the wheezing elevator, harsh fluorescent
text: lights, graffiti on the walls. As the door closes, he hears--
speaker_heading: SOPHIE (OS)
dialog: Wait!!
text: He puts his foot out with some panache to stop the closing
dialog: door-- He's a romantic at heart. Ding.
text: And SOPHIE DUMOND (late 20's), tired eyes, hands filled with
text: grocery bags, steps onto the elevator with GIGI, her 5-year-
dialog: old daughter.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: Of course it's you,-- everyone else
dialog: in this building is just so fucking
dialog: rude.
text: Joker nods "thanks." Holds his breath, hoping he doesn't
text: start to laugh.
text: Floors dinging as the elevator rises.
text: Joker sees GiGi licking the dirty smudged elevator handrail
text: behind her mom.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: How's your mom doing?
text: He takes a deep breath, he's uncomfortable talking to her,
text: holds up the white prescription bag.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: It's day to day. I'm doing
dialog: everything I can to get her back on
dialog: her feet.
dialog: (re: pharmacy bag)
dialog: Picked up her medicine. Gonna make
dialog: her some dinner.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: (smiles; being polite)
dialog: She's lucky she has you--
text: Joker smiles thanks, can't help but glance at GiGi licking
dialog: the rail.
text: Sophie finally notices. She wants to grab her but can't with
text: her hands full. Tries to kick her away--
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Jesus. Don't do that, GiGi! How
dialog: many times have I told you that?
dialog: (to Joker)
dialog: This building is so awful, isn't
dialog: it?
text: Joker just nods... he doesn't know what to say, but clearly
dialog: wants to continue this conversation with Sophie.
text: The doors open. They all step off.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Okay. Well, tell your mom I said
dialog: hello.
text: And Sophie and GiGi walk down the hall-- the opposite way of
text: Joker. He just stands there for a beat. Heart beating fast.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (calls out after her)
dialog: Hey Sophie--
text: She turns around.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I'll tell my mom you said hello.
dialog: She smiles as in "yeah, that's what I said."
scene_heading: 8 INT. MOM'S APARTMENT, FRONT DOOR - EVENING 8
text: Old apartment, worn carpet. Nothing's new inside but it's
text: fairly neat and well-kept.
text: Joker closes the door behind him, leans his back against it
text: and swoons. Hears a deep purring sound. He looks down and
text: sees an OLD ORANGE CAT, rubbing up against his leg.
dialog: Then--
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: MOM (OS)
dialog: (shattering the moment,
dialog: calls out)
dialog: Happy?! Did you check the mail
dialog: before you came up?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Yes, Ma. Nothing. No letter.
speaker_heading: MOM (OS)
dialog: You sure you looked? Sometimes I
dialog: don't know where your head is.
text: Joker glances back down and sees the cat is gone.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Yes I'm sure. And my head's right
dialog: here. I'm gonna make you some
dialog: dinner, okay?
speaker_heading: QUICK CUTS:
text: JOKER TEARS OPEN THE PRESCRIPTION BAG... A FLURRY OF PILL
text: BOTTLES TUMBLE OUT ONTO THE COUNTER.
text: SEE HIS NAME, "ARTHUR FLECK" ON THE ORANGE PILL BOTTLES, AND
scene_heading: GLIMPSE THE GENERIC DRUG NAMES, TEMAZEPAM... PERPHENAZINE...
scene_heading: AHENELZINE... AMITRIPTYLINE... BENZEDRINE... DIAZEPAM...
text: MEPROBAMATE...
text: TAKES OUT ONE PILL FROM EACH THE TEMAZEPAM AND MEPROBAMATE
speaker_heading: BOTTLES.
text: TWO PILLS BEING CRUSHED UP TO POWDER.
text: SPRINKLES THE POWDER ON TOP OF A TV DINNER.
text: SWALLOWS A HANDFUL OF PILLS FROM THE OTHER BOTTLES.
text: LOOKS DOWN AND SMILES AT THE ORANGE CAT LOOKING UP AT HIM
text: FROM THE COUNTER.
scene_heading: 9 INT. MOM'S BEDROOM, APARTMENT - NIGHT 9
text: Joker brings the food to his mother, PENNY (70's), lying in
text: her bed. The TV is on, playing the local news.
text: Joker sets the food down in front of his mother. He covers
text: the pain from his beating the best he can-- His mother
text: doesn't seem to notice anyway.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: He must not be getting my letters.
dialog: 12.
text: Joker sits down on a chair next to the bed.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: He's a busy man.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Too busy for me? I worked for that
dialog: family for 12 years. He always had
dialog: a smile for me. Least he could do
text: is write back.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Ma, eat. You need to eat.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: You need to eat. Look how skinny
dialog: you are.
text: Before Joker can say anything, his mother points to the news
dialog: on the TV--
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: All day long it's more bad news.
dialog: That's all there is.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Maybe you shouldn't watch so much
dialog: television.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: (ignoring)
dialog: He's the only hope for Gotham.
dialog: He'll make a great mayor. Everybody
dialog: says so.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (playful)
dialog: Everybody who? Who do you talk to?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Well everybody on the news.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Stop it. He's not even gonna run.
dialog: Why would Thomas Wayne want to be
dialog: mayor? He can do more good as a
dialog: businessman.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Because he cares about this city.
dialog: And everyone in it-- that's why I
dialog: can't believe he hasn't written me
dialog: back.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: He will. Now eat some dinner.
text: He feeds her a bite of the food.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: How you feeling today?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: I don't know. It always hits me
dialog: worse at night, you notice that?
text: He shakes his head.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (teasing)
dialog: Maybe it's the moon. Maybe you're a
dialog: werewolf?
text: HE HOWLS SOFTLY like a wolf. She laughs.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: It's not funny.
text: Joker watches her as he cuts up some more of her food.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Anyway, I wrote a new letter today.
dialog: A better one. I want you to hand
dialog: deliver it to him.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: What? Why?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Cause maybe the mailman is throwing
dialog: them away. We should have tipped
dialog: him at Christmas time.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Who tips their mailman?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Some people do. Rich people do.
text: Joker sighs, resigned.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Okay. I can try his office.
dialog: Tomorrow.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (she pats the bed)
dialog: Come sit. It's almost on.
text: Joker gets into bed with her.
text: CLOSE ON TELEVISION, intro to "LIVE WITH MURRAY FRANKLIN!",
text: and we HEAR THE ANNOUNCER over clips of comedy bits, stars
dialog: and Murray Franklin himself--
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (ON TV)
dialog: It's Live with Murray Franklin!
dialog: Tonight Murray welcomes, Sandra
dialog: Winger, comedian Skip Byron and the
dialog: piano stylings of Yeldon &amp; Chantel!
dialog: As always, Don Ellis and his Jazz
dialog: Orchestra. And now, without any
dialog: further ado-- Murray Franklin!
text: Joker and his mom watch from bed, this is a ritual of theirs.
scene_heading: 10 INT. LIVING ROOM, MOM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 10
text: Late night. Joker's mom is dead asleep. Joker is alone in the
text: living room, which doubles as his bedroom. He can't ever
text: sleep. He opens his worn notebook. Flips to a page titled
dialog: "Jokes" and starts writing--
text: CLOSE ON WORDS, as he slowly writes: "The worst part about
dialog: having a mental illness is..."
text: ANGLE ON JOKER, pausing, thinking it over for a moment. Then
text: he laughs to himself when he comes up with something.
text: CLOSE ON WORDS, coming faster now, "...that people still
dialog: expect you to behave as if you don't."
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 11 EXT. WAYNE TOWER, STREET - MIDTOWN - MORNING 11
text: Joker's looking up at the intimidating steel and glass tower,
text: he looks so small, holding his mom's letter in his hand.
text: Bustle of professionals coming in and out of the company's
text: corporate headquarters, Joker looks out of place.
text: He heads inside through the giant glass doors.
dialog: 15.
scene_heading: 12 INT. RECEPTION, WAYNE ENTERPRISES - 25TH FLOOR - MORNING 12
text: Joker steps off an elevator and walks up to the white marble
text: reception desk as if he belongs there--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Hello. I have a personal letter for
dialog: Mr. Thomas Wayne.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Okay. You can leave it with me.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: It's kind of important. I need to
dialog: make sure he gets it himself.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Oh, in that case, I'll buzz you
dialog: right in.
dialog: Joker goes to enter--
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: I'm kidding. Leave it here.
text: He laughs along with her, even though she's not laughing.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Oh. Right-- well, my mom used to
dialog: work for the Wayne family-- for 12
dialog: years. She was their housekeeper.
text: A couple other business people are now waiting behind Joker,
dialog: there for meetings.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: That's great. But you can leave it
dialog: with me or you can leave with the
dialog: letter. Those are your options. Now
dialog: please step aside.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Mr. Wayne knows her. Can you maybe
dialog: at least call back to him? Tell him
dialog: that I'm here.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
text: Thomas Wayne is away on business.
text: Joker is getting frustrated.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Okay. Well, can I have your name?
dialog: So I know who I left it with.
dialog: 16.
text: Now Joker sees a GROUP OF MEN walking behind the glass that
text: separates the reception area from the back offices. Amongst
text: the group, he catches a glimpse of THOMAS WAYNE (60's), deep
text: tan, hair dyed so black it's almost blue.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Wait. He's right there.
dialog: (goes up to the glass,
dialog: shouts)
dialog: Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne.
text: He starts banging on the glass... but the group keeps moving.
text: Not noticing him.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Sir. Please stop. Sir!!
text: Joker keeps banging on the glass.
scene_heading: 13 EXT. WAYNE TOWER, FRONT ENTRANCE - MORNING 13
text: The glass doors swing open and Joker is forcibly thrown onto
text: the street. TWO LARGE SECURITY GUARDS stand over him.
text: He is still holding the letter.
text: He makes as if he's going to leave peacefully, then at the
text: last minute, TAKES ANOTHER RUN AT THE DOOR--
text: The two guards stiff arm him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 14 INT. HA-HA'S TALENT BOOKING, LOCKER ROOM - DAY 14
text: The cramped locker room of a small talent booking agency.
dialog: This is where Joker works. They "rent out" talent for parties
text: and events. Clowns, magicians, male strippers.
text: Joker takes off his shirt, grimaces in pain as he moves. His
text: body's bruised from the beating he took chasing after his
dialog: sign.
speaker_heading: RANDALL (OS)
dialog: You okay?
text: He turns. RANDALL (mid 50's), a big bear of a know-it-all,
text: standing there. He's a party clown as well. He's half-dressed
text: in his clown suit.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: I heard about the beat down you
dialog: took. Fucking savages.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: It was just a bunch of kids. I
dialog: should have left it alone.
text: Randall opens his locker--
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: It's crazy out there. And it's only
dialog: getting worse.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (nods)
dialog: My mother says that the people
dialog: nowadays lack empathy.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: What's empathy?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: It means like "feeling for other
dialog: people."
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Like sympathy?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Kind of. But different.
text: Randall comes over, hands Joker a brown paper bag-- Joker
text: looks inside. It's a GUN, a .38 snub-nose revolver.
text: Joker looks up at him, confused--
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Take it. I got a few. You gotta
dialog: protect yourself out there, buddy.
dialog: Too many wackos.
text: As Joker stares at it--
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: (lowers his voice)
dialog: It's a .38 snub-nose. Gets the job
dialog: done if you ever need to use it.
dialog: Usually pulling it out is enough.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I, I don't have the money for this,
dialog: Randall.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Don't sweat it. You can pay me some
dialog: other time. You're my boy.
text: That lands with Joker, he smiles to himself.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: (as he walks away)
dialog: But you didn't get it from me,
dialog: okay?
text: Joker nods. Puts the brown paper bag in his locker. Slowly
text: starts to get dressed-- his eyes darting toward the bag as he
dialog: does.
text: Another clown, GARY (30's), a dwarf, pops his head into the
text: locker room.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Arthur,-- Hoyt wants to see you in
dialog: his office.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: No clue.
scene_heading: 15 INT. FRONT OFFICE, HA-HA'S TALENT BOOKING - DAY 15
text: Joker still half-dressed, walks into the cramped office.
text: His boss, HOYT VAUGHN (60's) sits behind a metal desk. The
text: office is a complete mess, newspapers and files litter the
text: desk. A giant ashtray filled with cigarette butts. A calendar
text: of booking hangs on the wall. A scribbled, jumbled mess.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Hey Hoyt. Gary said you wanted to
dialog: see me?
speaker_heading: HOYT
dialog: (without even looking up)
dialog: How's the comedy career? Are you a
dialog: famous stand-up yet?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Not quite. Haven't even performed
dialog: yet. Just been working my material.
dialog: This business is all about fine-
dialog: tuning.
text: Now Hoyt looks up. Takes a drag from his cigarette.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: HOYT
dialog: Right.
dialog: Joker goes to sit down--
speaker_heading: HOYT
dialog: Don't sit. This will be quick.
text: Joker stops in his tracks.
speaker_heading: HOYT
dialog: Look, I like you, Arthur. A lot of
dialog: the guys here, they think you're a
dialog: freak. But I like you. I don't even
dialog: know why I like you. I mean, you
dialog: don't say much.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's probably that stupid laugh. It
dialog: gets me every time. Kills me.
text: Unsure how to respond, Joker just nods.
speaker_heading: HOYT
dialog: But I got another complaint. And
dialog: it's starting to piss me off.
text: Joker takes a deep breath, maybe picks at his eyebrow.
speaker_heading: HOYT
dialog: Kenny's Music. Sunday. The guy said
dialog: you disappeared. Never even
text: returned his sign.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: No. I got jumped. I told you about
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: HOYT
dialog: For a sign? Bullshit. It makes no
dialog: sense, just give him his sign back.
dialog: He's going out of business for
dialog: god's--
text: BANG! Out of nowhere, Joker slams his head into the wall.
text: Head-butting it hard.
speaker_heading: HOYT
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: Hey!
text: BANG! BANG! He does it two more times. Breaking the plaster
dialog: on the wall--
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: HOYT
dialog: What the fuck, Arthur?!
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (voice tightens)
dialog: I don't have his sign.
text: And Joker just stares at Hoyt, some blood forming on his
dialog: forehead--
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 16 EXT. BACK ALLEY, OUTSIDE HA-HA'S - AMUSEMENT MILE - DAY 16
text: WE'RE AT THE FAR END OF AN ALLEY, about halfway down, catch a
text: glimpse of Joker still half-dressed on the other side of a
text: dumpster. From this vantage, all we can see is him furiously
text: KICKING and STOMPING on something... or somebody.
text: We don't hear anything. And we can't make out what it is that
text: he's so violently beating down.
dialog: It could be a cat... a cardboard box... a homeless person...
dialog: We don't know.
text: Joker just continues unleashing his rage--
scene_heading: 17 INT. CITY BUS (MOVING) - DUSK 17
text: Joker at the end of his work day, sitting in his spot toward
text: the back of the bus.
text: Across the aisle from him, he's innocently watching a young
text: couple, playfully teasing each other.
scene_heading: 18 EXT. GOTHAM, LOWER EAST SIDE - EVENING 18
text: Joker heading back home down the litter-covered streets like
text: he does every night. Garbage still piled along the sidewalks,

text: He's carrying the paper bag that Randall gave him.
scene_heading: 19 INT. LOBBY, APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING 19
text: Joker checks his mailbox. Empty.

scene_heading: 20 INT. ELEVATOR, APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 20
text: Joker is on the elevator, as the door closes, he sticks his
text: foot out to stop it.
text: The door limps back open. Ding.
text: He looks to see if anybody, if Sophie, is coming. He waits.
dialog: Hoping.
text: The door starts to close on him again-- Right before it does,
text: he stops it with his foot again. Ding.
scene_heading: 21 INT. MOM'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT 21
text: JOKER'S GIVING HIS MOM A BATH, being careful with her as he
text: shampoos her hair.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: --so what did he say when you gave
dialog: him the letter?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: They wouldn't let me see him.
dialog: (lying)
dialog: But they promised me it would get
dialog: to him.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: It's good they promised. He only
dialog: works with the best. We should hear
dialog: something soon.
text: He fills an empty plastic container with some bath water.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Look up.
text: She tilts her head back and he rinses her hair with the water
dialog: from the container...
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Why are these letters so important
dialog: to you, Ma? What do you think he's
dialog: gonna do?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: He's gonna help us.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Help us how?
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Get us out of here, take me away
dialog: from this place and these-- these
dialog: awful people.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: You worked for him over 30 years
dialog: ago. What makes you think he would
dialog: help you?
text: She looks at him with conviction.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Because Thomas Wayne is a good man.
dialog: If he knew how I was living, if he
dialog: saw this place, it would make him
dialog: sick. I can't explain it to you any
dialog: better than that.
text: Joker nods. Annoyed, but not worth the argument. He stands up
dialog: to get her a towel.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I don't want you worrying about
dialog: money. Everyone's been telling me
dialog: they think my stand-up is ready for
dialog: the big clubs. It's just a matter
dialog: of time before I get a break.
text: She steps into the towel. He's helping dry her off.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Happy, what makes you think you
dialog: could do that?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: I mean, don't you have to be funny

dialog: 23.
scene_heading: 23 INT. LIVING ROOM, MOM'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 23
text: Joker sits on the couch. The TV is on, but the sound is off.
text: He holds the .38 SNUB-NOSE REVOLVER Randall gave him in his
text: hand. He's never held a gun before, looks uncomfortable with
text: it, the weight of it in his hand...
text: He points it at the TV, hand trembling a bit... Points it at
text: the cat... Points it at his head.
text: Looks closely at the grip. The barrel. The cylinder. Now he
text: casually pulls the trigger--
speaker_heading: BLAMMMMMMM!
text: He jumps up off the couch. What the fuck!? He looks around in
text: a panic. His hands shaking.
text: He shot a hole in the wall.
speaker_heading: MOM (OS)
dialog: (awoken by the shot)
dialog: HAPPY!? What was that?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: What?!
text: He quickly turns up the TV volume. REALLY LOUD. Shoves the
text: still smoking gun under the couch cushions.
speaker_heading: MOM (OS)
dialog: THAT NOISE! DID YOU HEAR THAT
speaker_heading: NOISE?
text: He's inspecting the hole in the wall. Shouts back over the TV
dialog: noise--
speaker_heading: JOKER
text: I'M WATCHING AN OLD WAR MOVIE.
speaker_heading: MOM (OS)
dialog: TURN IT DOWN!
text: He heads for his mother's bedroom.
scene_heading: 24 INT. MOM'S BEDROOM, DOORWAY - CONTINUOUS 24
text: Joker looks in on his mom in her dark bedroom, can make out
text: the outline of her body sitting up.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: It's so loud.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I know. The Americans are really
dialog: giving it to the Japs.
text: He walks over to her in the darkness. Kisses her on the
dialog: forehead.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (softly)
dialog: I'm sorry. I'll turn it down.
scene_heading: 25 INT. KITCHEN, MOM'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT 25
text: Joker is writing in his journal. He speaks softly to himself
dialog: as he writes...
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Why didn't Randall tell me the gun
dialog: was loaded? He's my friend. With my
dialog: luck, I could have killed someone.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I could have killed myself.
text: CLOSE ON THE LAST LINE, he crosses out "could"...
dialog: Writes... "should".
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (still to himself)
dialog: I should have killed myself.
text: CLOSE ON JOKER as he crosses out something again...
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (louder to himself)
dialog: I should kill myself.
dialog: Beat.

text: HANDHELD POV, see the run-down building where Joker lives
text: from across the street.
text: REVEAL, Joker is watching his own building on the far side of
text: a parked truck. Red hood pulled up, covering his head. He
text: waits. Watches.
text: Now we see Sophie exiting the building with her daughter
dialog: GiGi. Sophie's dressed more conservatively than when we
dialog: previously met her.
dialog: 25.
text: Joker starts following them.
scene_heading: 27 EXT. PUBLIC SCHOOL - MORNING 27

scene_heading: 29 INT. SUBWAY (MOVING) - MORNING 29
text: Joker stands at the window between two subway cars. Just
text: watching Sophie as she reads a book in the next car.
text: The train comes to a stop and she exits. Joker exits as well.
scene_heading: 30 EXT. STREET, UPPER EAST SIDE - MORNING 30
text: Nicer part of Gotham. Joker follows Sophie from a distance,
text: watches as she walks into Gotham First National Bank.
text: Sees her say hello to the guard. This is where she works.
text: Joker just watches and waits.
scene_heading: 31 INT. GOTHAM FIRST NATIONAL - LATER 31
text: A large, mid-level bank. Sophie is one of THREE BANK TELLERS
text: working behind the plexiglass windows.
text: Joker pulls the hood back off his head, takes a deep breath
text: before he walks up to her window. She is looking down,
text: counting her drawer.
text: Takes another deep breath. Then--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Hello. I'd like to open an account.
text: She looks up.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Hey, what are you doing up here?
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Oh, hi. That's weird.
dialog: (pausing to see if he's
dialog: gonna laugh; he's good)
dialog: I didn't know you worked at a bank.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Pretty glamorous, right?
text: Not getting the sarcasm, Joker nods. Looks around.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Very glamorous. Look at this place.
text: She laughs.
text: He stands there awkwardly for a moment looking around to see
text: what she's laughing about.
text: Realizes she thought he was making a joke.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I'm a comedian. I do stand-up
dialog: comedy.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Really? I had no idea.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Yeah. You know, I'm always making
dialog: funny observations. Always on the
dialog: look out for my next bit-- so it
dialog: makes sense.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Right. Anyway, is there something I
dialog: could help you with?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I said hi to my mom.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Last week. You said to say hi to my
dialog: mom. I did. Made her day.
text: They are interrupted by the BRANCH MANAGER (50's), white,
text: heavy-set, who has come up behind Sophie--
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: BRANCH MANAGER
dialog: Everything okay here?
text: He puts his heavy hand on Sophie's shoulder. She practically
text: shudders from his touch.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Everything is fine Mr. Slotnick.
text: Now he leans down and whispers something in her ear-- Joker
text: just watches through the glass.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
text: (shakes her head; to her
dialog: manager)
dialog: No. He's not. He's interested in
dialog: opening an account.
speaker_heading: BRANCH MANAGER
dialog: (to Joker)
dialog: Great. You just need to fill out a
dialog: form. They are back there-- against
dialog: the wall.
text: As the manager talks, Sophie makes wide eyes at Joker, like
dialog: "I almost got in trouble."
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (covering; trying to act
dialog: cool)
dialog: Okay. Thank you, sir. And thank you
dialog: as well, Miss.
text: Joker walks back to the wall by the forms.
text: He fumbles around for a minute, clearly not there to open an
text: account. He begins filling out a form. Then--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (shouts out, to no one in
dialog: particular)
dialog: YOU KNOW WHAT?! I FORGOT MY ID!
dialog: I'LL BE BACK. THANK YOU.
text: He walks out of the bank. Head in the clouds.
scene_heading: 32 INT. GOTHAM COMEDY CLUB, CHINATOWN - NIGHT 32
text: Joker sitting in the middle of a dark, crowded comedy club.
text: People on dates. Groups of friends. All here to watch the

text: act on stage.
dialog: 28.
text: The comic on stage is killing it. The whole room is laughing
text: and applauding. Everyone except Joker.
text: He's watching. Studying. Diligently jotting down notes in his
dialog: notebook.
scene_heading: 33 EXT. GOTHAM COMEDY CLUB, STREET - CHINATOWN - NIGHT 33
text: People are piling out of the club, onto the narrow street,
text: jumble of lit-up signs, most glowing yellow or red. Joker
text: walks out alone, carrying his notebook. He sees a FLYER taped
text: to the entrance of the club.
text: CLOSE ON THE FLYER, "Open mic night. Thursdays. 10pm."
text: He rips the flyer off the wall.
scene_heading: 34 INT. HA-HA'S TALENT BOOKING, LOCKER ROOM - DAY 34
text: Joker is working on his "Mr. Jingles" clown look, using the
text: small mirror in his locker. Behind him a couple of other
text: clowns are eating their lunch at a small table, not paying
dialog: Joker any attention.
text: Joker pauses half-finished, and stares at himself for a beat.
text: He starts to examine the two small scars on the corners of
text: his mouth, we really notice how they form a smile. Joker
text: hooks the corners of his mouth down with his index fingers,
text: turning his smile into a frown--
text: He lets go and his smile returns.
text: Does it again, up and down, up and down, his face a living
dialog: comedy/tragedy mask.
text: And then he pulls his fingers wider, stretching his smile
text: into a grotesque parody, pulling his mouth so wide tears come
dialog: to his eyes--
text: AND WE HEAR JOKER SINGING "If You're Happy and You Know It"
text: at his next gig.
speaker_heading: JOKER (PRE-LAP)
dialog: (singing)
dialog: --if you're happy and you know it
dialog: and you really want to show it, if

text: an oversized white lab coat over his "Mr. Jingles" clown
text: costume. A few nurses and doctors watch as well.
text: His white clown face, mouth outlined in black and filled in
text: with red, his green wig frizzy and worn out. Joker plays a
text: UKULELE along with the song.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: If you're happy and you know it,
dialog: stomp your feet.
text: Joker and the kids stomp and sing along.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: If you're happy and you know it,
dialog: stomp your feet.
dialog: (stomp, stomp)
dialog: If you're happy and you know it and
dialog: you really want to show it, if
dialog: you're happy and you know it stomp
dialog: your feet.
text: As the song winds down, the KIDS and NURSES clap.
text: Joker takes an exaggerated and ridiculous bow--
text: And as he does, his .38 SNUB-NOSE REVOLVER slips out of his
text: pants and slides across the floor.
text: Everyone stops. Looks at the gun on the floor.
scene_heading: 36 INT. LOBBY, GOTHAM GENERAL - LATER 36
text: Joker is on a payphone in the lobby of the hospital. He's in

speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hoyt, let me explain.
speaker_heading: HOYT (OVER PHONE)
dialog: Oh, this'll be good. Please tell me
dialog: why you brought a gun into a sick
dialog: kid's ward?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: It was, it was a prop gun. It's
dialog: part of my act now.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: HOYT (OVER PHONE)
dialog: Bullshit. Jingles would never carry
dialog: a fucking gun. Besides, Randall
dialog: told me you tried to buy a .38 off
dialog: him last week.
text: Joker's taken aback that Randall would do that to him.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Randall told you that?
speaker_heading: HOYT (OVER PHONE)
dialog: He was with me when the call came
dialog: in. You're a fuck up, Arthur. And a
dialog: liar. You're fired.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hoyt--
speaker_heading: HOYT (OVER PHONE)
dialog: Say it, Arthur.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Let me hear you say it.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Say what?
speaker_heading: HOYT (OVER PHONE)
dialog: I'm a fuck up and I'm fired.
text: Joker picks at his eyebrow.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (into phone; low)
dialog: --I'm a fuck up and I'm fired.
speaker_heading: HOYT (OVER PHONE)
dialog: Louder.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (into phone; louder)
dialog: I'm a fuck up and I'm fired.
speaker_heading: HOYT (OVER PHONE)
dialog: Yes. You are.
text: Click. He hears Hoyt hang up.
dialog: Beat.
dialog: 31.
scene_heading: 37 INT. SUBWAY (MOVING) - NIGHT 37
text: JOKER SITS ON THE SUBWAY CONTEMPLATING WHAT JUST WENT DOWN,
text: face still painted, his bag on the seat next to him, along
text: with his wig.
text: There's only one other person on the subway car, a YOUNG
text: WOMAN (30's) sitting at the far end-- reading a book.
text: The train comes to a stop and THREE WALL STREET GUYS enter.
text: They are being loud and obnoxious, clearly drunk. One of them
text: is eating some french fries out of a greasy McDonald's bag.
text: He flops down on the bench across from the girl and checks
text: her out. The other two guys start getting into it with each
dialog: other--
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #1
dialog: --I'm telling you, she wanted my
dialog: number. We should have just stayed.
text: The train starts moving again...
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #2
dialog: You're dreaming, man. She wasn't
dialog: interested-- at all.
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #1
dialog: Are you nuts? Did you see how close
dialog: we were dancing!? She was in love,
dialog: bro.
text: He starts dancing a bit with himself, mimicking what he
text: remembers. Wall Street #2 takes a swig from the brown bag he
text: is carrying.
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #2
dialog: She couldn't wait to get away from
dialog: you.
text: Joker is watching them closely, impressed by their confidence
dialog: and easy-going camaraderie.
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #1
dialog: (to the third guy)
dialog: Ryan, am I crazy? Tell him what you
dialog: saw.
dialog: But the third Wall Street guy isn't paying his friends any
text: attention. He has his eyes set on the young woman sitting
text: across from him, reading her book.
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #3
dialog: (to the girl)
dialog: Hey. You want some french fries?
dialog: 32.
text: He holds out his McDonald's bag and shakes it to get her
text: attention. The other two share a look. Joker watches from his
dialog: seat.
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #3
dialog: Hello? I'm talking to you. You want
dialog: some fries?
text: She looks up and shakes her head, polite smile.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: No thank you.
text: The other two guys crack up at this apparent blow-off. The
text: third Wall Street guy shakes his head, embarrassed, and
text: starts softly flinging fries at the young woman.
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #3
dialog: You sure? They're really good.
text: She just buries her face deeper in her book--
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #2
dialog: Don't ignore him. He's being nice
dialog: to you.
text: One of the french fries lands in her hair. She looks down
text: toward Joker, looking to see if he's going to do something or
dialog: say something--
text: Joker just sits there nervous. Not sure what to do, or even
dialog: if he wants to do anything at all.
text: AND HE JUST BURSTS OUT LAUGHING. He covers his mouth with his
text: hand as they continue to harass the woman.
dialog: They all look over-- What the fuck is this clown laughing at?
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #1
dialog: Something funny, asshole?
text: With their attention diverted, the young woman rushes out
text: through the door between subway cars, glancing back at Joker
dialog: before she goes--
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #3
dialog: (shouts after her)
speaker_heading: BITCH!
text: Joker laughs even harder through his hand. The Wall Street
text: guys turn to him sitting by himself at the end of the car--
dialog: 33.
text: Joker sees them staring. Looks down at the ground, hand still
text: covering his mouth, face turning red. Subway swaying, lights
text: flickering on and off.
dialog: Beat.
text: One of the guys heads down the car toward Joker, starts
text: singing "Send in the Clowns" as he approaches--
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #1
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Isn't it rich?
dialog: Are we a pair?
dialog: Me here, at last on the ground
dialog: You in mid-air
dialog: Send in the clowns.
text: The others crack up and follow after him. The guy plops down
text: next to Joker, puts his arm around his shoulder as he sings--
speaker_heading: JOKER
text: (shakes his head, stifling
dialog: the laughter)
dialog: Please. Don't.
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #1
dialog: (continues singing to him)
dialog: Isn't it bliss?
dialog: Don't you approve?
text: One who keeps tearing around,
dialog: One who can't move.
text: Joker starts to get up-- The lead guy pulls him back down.
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #1
dialog: Where are the clowns?
dialog: There ought to be clowns.
text: As he finishes the song, Joker's laughing fit is coming to an
text: end. One of the other guys sits down on the other side of
text: him. He's now sandwiched in between them--
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #2
dialog: So tell us, buddy. What's so
dialog: fucking funny?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Nothing. I have a condition--
text: Joker reaches into his bag to get one of his "Forgive my
text: laughter" cards, the third guy sees him reaching and tries to
dialog: grab the bag from him---
dialog: Joker pulls on it--
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: No. It's just my stuff. I don't
dialog: have anything.
text: The guy rips the bag from his hand--
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #3
dialog: I'll tell you what you have,
dialog: asshole.
text: Joker gets up from between them to go grab his bag back. The
text: two guys are cracking up.
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #3
dialog: You want it back? Here--
text: Joker reaches out to grab the bag--
text: And the guy tosses it over his head to one of his friends.
text: Keeping it away from Joker.
text: Three guys in suits tossing a bag around, playing 'monkey in
text: the middle' with a clown. THE LIGHTS ON THE TRAIN SEEM TO
text: GLOW BRIGHTER AND WE HEAR the drum roll opening to BOBBY
text: SHORT singing "Send in the Clowns" Live at the Café Carlyle.
text: Joker keeps trying to catch his bag until suddenly--
text: WHAP! Out of nowhere one of the guys punches him hard in the
dialog: face.
text: Joker goes down as if in slow motion. Blood coming from his
text: nose. He tries to get up, but his feet slip from under him
text: and he falls back down--
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #1
dialog: Stay down you freak.
text: And the third Wall Street guy starts kicking him--
text: The others join in. Surrounding Joker on the ground, kicking
text: him deliberately, sadistically, and the music swells--
speaker_heading: BLAM!
text: SUDDENLY THE LIGHTS GO BACK DIM, and one of the guys stops
text: kicking and falls back dead. Blood splattering on the subway
text: wall behind him--
text: And we HEAR Bobby Short sing out, picking up from where the
dialog: Wall Street Guy left off--
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: BOBBY SHORT (SINGING)
dialog: Just when I'd stopped opening doors
dialog: Finally knowin' the one that I
dialog: wanted was yours
text: BLAM! BLAM! Wall Street #2 goes down--
text: Revealing Joker on the ground, opening his eyes to see what
text: he did, smoking gun in his hand--
speaker_heading: BOBBY SHORT (SINGING)
dialog: Making my entrance again with my
dialog: usual flair
dialog: Sure of my lines
dialog: No one is there
text: The third guy takes off running for the doors that separate
dialog: the cars.
text: Joker starts after him, but then stops... turns back to grab
text: his bag and his wig, his hands shaking from the adrenaline.
text: The train is coming to a stop.
speaker_heading: BOBBY SHORT (SINGING)
dialog: Don't you love farce?
dialog: My fault I fear...
text: Joker picks up his bag between the two dead bodies, blood
dialog: everywhere...
text: The subway doors wheeze open and Joker steps halfway off the
text: train, waiting to see if the third Wall Street guy gets off
text: in the car ahead of him. Joker sees him run off--
scene_heading: 38 EXT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS 38
text: The platform is empty, the Wall Street guy is running toward
dialog: the stairs--
dialog: Joker follows--
text: Behind them, the train pulls away--
speaker_heading: BOBBY SHORT (SINGING)
dialog: I thought that you'd want what I
dialog: want.
dialog: Sorry, my dear.
text: The guy makes his way to the stairs, unaware that Joker is
dialog: behind him--
speaker_heading: BLAM!
dialog: 36.
text: The third guy falls, tumbling down the stairs. Joker walks
text: over to the body and empties the chamber-- BLAM! BLAM!
speaker_heading: BOBBY SHORT (SINGING)
dialog: But where are the clowns?
dialog: Quick, send in the clowns
dialog: Don't bother they're here.
text: And as "Send in the Clowns" ends, Joker fires the last shot--
dialog: BLAM! He's got nothing left.
scene_heading: 39 EXT. STREET, ROBINSON SQUARE PARK - NIGHT 39
text: Joker hauls ass out of the subway and makes a mad dash across
text: a busy street, horns honking--
text: Running as fast as he can past piles of garbage, he takes a
text: sharp turn high-tailing into a small, run-down needle park,
text: disappearing into the darkness.
scene_heading: 40 INT. PUBLIC BATHROOM, ROBINSON SQUARE PARK - NIGHT 40
text: Joker runs into the bathroom, locks the door behind him and
text: SUDDENLY EVERYTHING HITS HIM ALL AT ONCE--
text: He throws up into the dirty toilet, puking his guts out--
text: He finishes, wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. And
text: pulls the gun out of his waist, looking around for someplace
text: to throw it out. Under the sink he sees a rusted, metal grate
text: hanging off the wall covering some pipes.
text: Before he bends down, Joker catches his reflection in the
text: smudged mirror. Sees himself holding the gun in his hand--
dialog: Beat.
text: He raises the gun to his head and pulls the trigger--
dialog: Click.
text: It's empty.
text: He gets down on his knees, sweat dripping off his face, pulls
text: the grate away from the wall. And tosses the gun away inside.
text: Moves the grate back in place.
text: Joker stands back up and turns on the faucets. Rinses out his
dialog: mouth.
text: Looks at his smudged reflection as he starts washing the
text: clown make-up off his sweaty face--
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Hi. Do you like to laugh?
text: Water dripping, white grease paint running off his face--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Remember how I told you that I'm a
dialog: stand-up comedian?
dialog: (again)
dialog: Hi. How are you?
dialog: Beat.
scene_heading: 41 INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, LOBBY - LATER 41
text: Joker enters his building with great urgency. No time for the
text: elevator, he takes the stairs. Two at a time.
text: He races up the stairwell.
scene_heading: 42 INT. HALLWAY, APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 42
text: When he gets to his floor, instead of making a left toward
text: his apartment-- He makes a right, toward Sophie's. He stops
text: at her door. Out of breath.
text: Knocks.
text: He hears footsteps. Quickly pulls the folded-up flyer out of
text: his pocket.
text: The peephole in the door goes dark and then light again. He
text: hears locks unlocking. Sophie opens the door halfway--
text: Joker looks down at his feet--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Hi. Do you like to laugh?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (continuing without taking
dialog: a breath)
dialog: Remember the other day when I told
dialog: you about my stand-up comedy. Well,
dialog: I'm doing a set next Thursday and
dialog: I'm inviting a bunch of my friends
dialog: and I was wondering if maybe you
dialog: wanted to come and check it out.
dialog: 38.
text: He reaches out to give Sophie the flyer, she opens the door
text: wider-- He notices her face, sees her eyes are red.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Were you crying? Why are you
dialog: crying?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I had a bad day.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I'm sorry. I, I didn't--
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: It's okay. How would you know.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I got fired. From the bank.
text: Joker takes a deep breath and smiles without realizing it,
text: hoping he doesn't start to laugh.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Because,-- I don't know. It doesn't
dialog: fucking matter. I don't know what
dialog: I'm gonna do.
text: And she starts crying again. Joker doesn't move. Just stands
text: in the doorway awkward.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (finally)
dialog: Okay. Well, all the info is right
text: there on the flyer.
text: He starts to walk away, then turns back to her--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: You know they say laughter is the
dialog: best medicine.
text: Sophie wipes her eyes and manages a smile.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Is that what they say?
dialog: 39.
text: Joker just nods yes and walks back toward his mother's
dialog: apartment.
scene_heading: 43 INT. DEPT. OF HEALTH, OFFICE - MORNING 43
text: JOKER SITS ACROSS from the same Social Worker from the
text: opening scene. Same depressing office.
text: She stares at him for a beat, clearly annoyed.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: We spoke about this last time,
dialog: Arthur. You're supposed to bring
dialog: your journal with you.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Well I didn't think you were going
dialog: to read it.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: You said it didn't bother you.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I lied. Everything bothers me.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: What about it bothered you?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: It's personal. It's my private
dialog: thoughts. Plus it contains original
dialog: comedy material that I don't feel
dialog: comfortable handing over to you.
text: She looks at him and shakes her head. Not in the mood to deal
dialog: with this.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: Arthur, I have some bad news for
dialog: you.
text: He looks up, intrigued.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: They've cut our funding. We're
dialog: closing down our offices next week.
text: He looks around, just noticing some MOVING BOXES stacked
text: against the wall.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: So where will we be meeting?
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: We won't be. The city's cut funding
dialog: across the board. Social services
dialog: is part of that.
text: Joker nods, not hating the idea.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: They don't give a shit about people
dialog: like you, Arthur. You don't have a
dialog: voice and they don't really care
dialog: what happens to you or to us for
dialog: that matter.
text: He sits there for a moment. And then it dawns on him--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: How am I gonna get my medication?
dialog: Beat.
scene_heading: 44 INT. MOM'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN - MORNING 44
text: CLOSE ON A COUPLE OF PILLS, as they get crushed up.
text: CLOSE ON THE RESIDUE, as it's sprinkled on top of a bowl of
dialog: oatmeal.
speaker_heading: MOM (OS)
dialog: Happy! Come in here. Thomas Wayne
text: is on TV.
text: Joker takes a couple of pills for himself. Looks inside. Not
text: many left. He looks over at the orange cat sitting on the
text: counter, purring loudly, watching him.
speaker_heading: MOM (OS)
dialog: Quick! Come.
scene_heading: 45 INT. MOM'S BEDROOM, APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 45
text: Joker walks in carrying her breakfast. She waves him over to
dialog: her bed.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: They're interviewing him about
dialog: those horrible murders on the
dialog: subway last week.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Why are they talking to him?
text: His mother shushes him. Joker sits on the end of the bed next
dialog: to her. It's one of those "Good Morning, Gotham" shows.
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE (ON TV)
dialog: --as you know, Jerry, all three of
dialog: them worked at Wayne Investments,
dialog: and they were the best of the best.
text: Solid young men.
text: A small smirk registers on Joker's face when photos of the
text: THREE WALL STREET GUYS come up on the screen.
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE (ON TV)
dialog: And while I didn't know them
dialog: personally, like all Wayne
dialog: employees, past and present, they
dialog: were family.
dialog: Joker's mom perks up at that--
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: You hear that! I told you. We're
dialog: family.
text: ANGLE ON TELEVISION, footage of GRAFFITI around the city.
text: "KILL THE RICH" spray painted on a storefront. "F CK WALL
text: STREET" written on a subway wall. "RESIST" scrawled across a
dialog: billboard.
scene_heading: "GOOD MORNING" HOST (ON TV)
text: There now seems to be a groundswell
text: of anti-rich sentiment in the city.
dialog: It's almost as if our less
dialog: fortunate residents have taken the
dialog: side of the killer.
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE (ON TV)
dialog: Yes and it's a shame. It's one of
dialog: the reasons I'm considering a run
text: for mayor. Gotham has lost its way.
scene_heading: "GOOD MORNING" HOST (ON TV)
dialog: Are you announcing your candidacy?
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE (ON TV)
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: No comment.
text: We hear his mother gasp, excited.
dialog: 42.
scene_heading: "GOOD MORNING" HOST (ON TV)
dialog: What about the eyewitness report of
dialog: the suspect being a man in clown
dialog: make-up or a clown mask-- Care to
dialog: comment on that?
text: Joker leans in, intrigued. The camera zooms in closer to
text: Thomas Wayne on the screen...
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE (ON TV)
dialog: It makes total sense to me. What
dialog: kind of coward would do something
dialog: that cold-blooded? Someone who
text: hides behind a mask. Someone who's
dialog: envious of those more fortunate
dialog: than themselves, yet too scared to
dialog: show their own face.
dialog: (to camera)
dialog: And until that jealousy ends, those
dialog: of us who've made a good life for
dialog: ourselves will always look at those
dialog: who haven't as nothing but clowns.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 46 INT. COMEDY CLUB, BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - NIGHT 46
text: JOKER'S POV, slowly walking down the hall -- as if in slow
text: motion -- toward a curtain at the end, spotlight bleeding
text: through, other wannabe comics looking at him as he passes--
text: CLOSE ON JOKER, eyeing the others, sweat beading on his
dialog: forehead--
text: He gets to the curtain, the light, pulls his worn joke-
text: notebook out of his back pocket. Glancing into the room he
text: sees it's a pretty good crowd. Sees Sophie taking a seat in
dialog: the back.
text: Wheeling back into the dark hallway, he catches his breath in
dialog: the shadows--
text: And starts BANGING HIS HEAD BACK against the wall--
text: He hears the EMCEE from the stage.
speaker_heading: EMCEE (OS)
dialog: This next comic describes himself
dialog: as a lifelong Gotham resident who
dialog: from a young age was always told
dialog: that "his purpose in life was to
dialog: bring joy and laughter into this
dialog: cold, dark world." Ummm. Okay.
dialog: 43.
text: He hears the crowd laugh.
speaker_heading: EMCEE (OS)
dialog: Please help me welcome Arthur
dialog: Fleck!
text: There is a smattering of applause.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: JOKER STEPPING ON STAGE, out under the spotlight, lifts the
text: microphone in front of his mouth, the light so bright he
text: can't see faces in the dark audience, his hand trembling
text: holding onto his worn notebook--
text: He takes a deep breath, looks out at the dark crowd, and
text: opens his mouth.
text: And starts to laugh. His eyes go wide. God no, not now. A
text: terrified look comes to his face under the laughter. He just
text: keeps laughing. The crowd is just staring back at him.
dialog: Finally he composes himself--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (trying to stop himself
dialog: from laughing)
dialog: -- good evening, hello.
dialog: (deep breath; trying to
dialog: stop laughing)
dialog: Good to be here.
dialog: (keeps cracking up)
dialog: I, I hated school as a kid. But my
dialog: mother would always say,--
dialog: (bad imitation of his mom,
dialog: still laughing)
dialog: "You should enjoy it. One day
dialog: you'll have to work for a living."
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: "No I won't, Ma. I'm gonna be a
dialog: comedian!"
text: Dead silence. Except for Joker, who's still cracking up.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 47 EXT. COMEDY CLUB, CHINATOWN STREET - NIGHT 47
text: Joker and Sophie walking out of the club after the show, the
text: audience trickles out around them. Nobody looking in Joker's
text: direction, nobody says anything to him, maybe one or two even
text: cracking up at him behind his back. Garbage bags crowding the
text: narrow street, lit up by the bright signs.
dialog: 44.
text: Joker and Sophie walk a ways without saying a word. Awkward
dialog: silence.
dialog: Then--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: So, did you laugh? Really couldn't
dialog: see much from up there.
text: Sophie pauses, doesn't know what to say. She lights up a
dialog: cigarette.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: (trying to be nice)
dialog: Of course. Yeah. You couldn't hear
dialog: anything?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: All I heard was my heart pounding.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: It was good. I really needed to get
dialog: out of my apartment so, thanks.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What happened to the rest of your
dialog: friends?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: What friends?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Didn't you say some of your friends
dialog: were coming?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (he forgot; recovers)
dialog: Yeah, I decided not to invite them.
dialog: As a performer sometimes you want
text: to see how a "real" crowd reacts.
dialog: People who don't already love me,
dialog: or, or have a notion of who I am,
dialog: you know?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Yeah. I get that.
text: Joker smiles at the connection. They walk past a newsstand--
text: a wall of Chinese language newspapers mixed with local papers
text: and tabloids, screaming headlines about the three Wall Street
text: Guys gunned down on the train.
text: Joker stops and stares at the headlines--
dialog: 45.
text: CLOSE ON HEADLINES, "Subway Vigilante"... "Yuppie Slaughter"
dialog: "Killer Clown On The Loose?"...
speaker_heading: SOPHIE (OS)
dialog: (re: the headlines)
dialog: You believe that shit?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Yeah,-- I don't know how something
dialog: like that happens.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Please. I'll bet you five bucks
dialog: those rich assholes deserved it.
text: He turns to her.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: You think?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Look at their faces. Those smug
dialog: smiles. I've seen that look. Fuck
dialog: them.
text: Sophie flicks her cigarette away and starts walking.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: The guy who did it is a hero. Three
dialog: less pricks in Gotham City. Woo-
dialog: hoo! Only a million more to go.
text: Joker watches her walk for a beat.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (calls out to her)
dialog: Hey. You want to get some coffee?
text: Sophie turns around and smiles. She looks great, even in
text: front of the mounds of garbage bags that line the sidewalk.
text: AN AMBULANCE SCREAMS BY, SIRENS BLARING as Sophie says
text: something that Joker doesn't hear. She keeps walking.
text: Joker chases after her and trips over a TIN GARBAGE CAN LID--
text: CLANG. CLANG. He falls down flat on his face.
text: Sophie turns and bursts out laughing. She can't help but
text: laugh. It's the first time she's laughed all night.
dialog: 46.
scene_heading: 48 INT. SZECHUAN ACE RESTAURANT, TABLE - NIGHT 48
text: Table covered with plates of half-eaten Chinese food.
text: Joker and Sophie sitting across from each other, middle of
text: conversation. Crowded room, brightly lit, looks more like a
text: casino. Almost everybody eating there is Chinese. It's loud.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: --I'm telling you, it's across the
dialog: board. Wall Street, the banks,
dialog: politicians. They've been making a
dialog: killing for years. Fuck them.
text: Joker takes a moment to think about what she said.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: What don't you know?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Not all of them are awful. Take
dialog: someone like Thomas Wayne for
dialog: example. He's a hero.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Oh c'mon, he's the worst!
dialog: Joker is taken aback--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Sophie, he's the only one who can
dialog: save this city.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: You can't be serious!? He's a
dialog: complete narcissist. Brags about
text: his money. Meanwhile, the rest of
dialog: us can barely make rent. Or feed
dialog: our kids.
text: Joker nods. Thinking about it.
dialog: Then--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: With what?
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: With your job. At the bank?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: (suddenly uncomfortable)
dialog: Oh. Yeah, I was, um,--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: We don't have to talk about it.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Have you ever been fired before?
text: Joker thinks it over for a moment.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Every time.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: And have you ever wanted to torch
dialog: the place?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (thinks it over again)
dialog: Every time.
text: Sophie smiles.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Right. And this was like the first
dialog: good job I had in like, years. Not
dialog: waitressing or anything like that.
dialog: It was 9-5. I had benefits. You
dialog: know what that means when you have
dialog: a kid?
text: Joker just looks at her, he doesn't really know what that
text: means. He just smiles.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: But from the very first day, the
text: manager guy starts smiling at me,
text: whispering in my ear, touching me,
dialog: trying to get me to sleep with him--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Did you do it? Did you go to bed
dialog: with him?
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Fuck no. The guy's a fucking pig.
dialog: So finally I complained to his
dialog: boss, and they fired me... And now,
dialog: now I don't know what to do with
dialog: myself.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Right. Wait, what do you mean?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I finally felt good. Like I had a
dialog: future. A purpose. And now I don't
dialog: even know how I'm gonna pay my
dialog: rent.
text: AND JOKER STARTS LAUGHING. He puts a hand over his mouth
text: trying to cover it, but he can't stop cracking up--
text: It's unsettling and disturbing for Sophie. People eating,
text: waiters in red vests, busboys, all look over and stare at
text: him. A few laugh. Joker turns away embarrassed, he looks out
text: the plate-glass window, face turning red from laughing so
dialog: hard--
text: AS HE LOOKS OUT, HE SEES A GROUP OF ROWDY KIDS walking down
text: the street. One of them glances back before he turns the
text: corner-- HE'S WEARING A CLOWN MASK THAT LOOKS JUST JOKER'S
text: CLOWN FACE. And then he's gone. The group disappears around
dialog: the corner--
text: Joker can't believe his eyes, still laughing-- He turns to
text: Sophie who didn't see them. Just sits there awkwardly waiting
dialog: for it to stop.
text: Finally, it subsides--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (catching his breath)
dialog: I'm sorry. I have this thing--
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I know.
text: Awkward beat.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: How did you get it?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I don't know. I read you can get it
dialog: from a brain injury or, or a lesion
dialog: in there. My mom said I was born
dialog: this way. Born laughing.
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Is that why she calls you Happy?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Kind of. That actually started when
dialog: I was a kid. The other kids made
dialog: fun of me, called me Happy-- but
dialog: not in a good way. I got so sick of
dialog: it, one day when I was about ten,
dialog: I, I,--
text: He smiles.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I took a razor and cut this smile
dialog: onto my face.
text: (she's taken aback as he
dialog: points to the scars)
dialog: Sort of like "You want happy? Here,
dialog: how's this for happy?"
text: He looks down, still smiling. She just watches him for a
dialog: beat.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I've been thinking about this night
dialog: my whole life.
text: They just sit there for a beat. Quiet.
scene_heading: 49 INT. MOM'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 49
text: Joker opening the door to his mother's apartment, holding a
text: doggie bag in his hand, sees the flickering blue light of the
text: TV on in the living room, hears the end of "LIVE WITH MURRAY
text: FRANKLIN!" He locks the locks, drawing the security chain
text: high on the door.
text: TURNS TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF HIS MOTHER PASSED OUT in the
text: living room, the cat jumping up next to her on the chair.
text: Joker watches for a beat as Murray does his signature sign
dialog: off, the one he's been doing for years--
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON TV)
dialog: (looking into camera)
dialog: Good night! And always remember,--
dialog: That's life.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: "That's life."
text: He hears Don Ellis and his Jazz Orchestra playing the show's
text: closing song-- the instrumental version of Frank Sinatra's
dialog: "That's Life".
text: As the music continues, Joker puts his face up against his
text: mom's nose, to see if she's breathing or if she's dead.
text: He feels her breath against his cheek.
text: Now he picks his mother up in his arms and carries her into
text: her bedroom to the music, almost as if he's dancing with her
text: as he leaves the room...
dialog: We stay behind.
text: "That's Life" still playing from TV.
text: He comes back into the living room and turns off the TV.
text: Takes off his jacket and throws it on the couch. Notices
text: something sticking out of his jacket pocket. He pulls it out.
dialog: It's the envelope he was supposed to deliver to Thomas Wayne.
text: He stares at it for a beat. And then--
text: Quietly rips it open, starts to read the letter:
dialog: CLOSE ON WORDS, "Dearest Thomas, I don't know where else to
dialog: turn..."
dialog: "Need your help..."
dialog: "You have a son. We have a son. His name is Arthur."
dialog: Stops reading, stays on--
dialog: "You have a son."
text: JOKER STARING DOWN AT THE LETTER, reading those words over
dialog: and over again -- "You have a son."
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: 50 INT. MOM'S BEDROOM, APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING 50
text: JOKER'S SITTING IN A CHAIR in his mother's room watching her
text: sleep. He has clearly been up all night. Still wearing the
dialog: same clothes.
text: He's holding her letter in his hand as the sun is just
text: starting to rise outside the windows, light just beginning to
dialog: crack the gloom.
text: THE ORANGE CAT SITS AT HIS FEET staring up at him, won't take
text: her eyes off of him.
text: Joker impatiently sits there for another moment waiting for
text: his mother to wake up, then suddenly--
text: SHRIEKS OUT AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS like a teapot, kicking
text: his back on the chair like an excited toddler--
text: His mother wakes with a start, looking around half asleep and
dialog: confused--
text: Joker turns and sees the cat run out of the room--
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: --what, what time is it?
text: He doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: What happened? Did you hurt
dialog: yourself again?
text: Joker holds her letter up in his hand.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: What is this? How come you never
dialog: told me?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Is, is that my letter? Is that my
dialog: letter, Happy?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: How could you not tell me, Ma?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: You told me you dropped it off.
dialog: You have no right opening my mail.

speaker_heading: JOKER

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Stop yelling at me, you're gonna

speaker_heading: JOKER

dialog: can Thomas Wayne be my father?
speaker_heading: MOM (OS)
text: (shouts back from behind
dialog: the door)
dialog: I'm not talking to you until you

speaker_heading: JOKER
text: (lowers his voice; trying
dialog: to sound calm)
dialog: Okay. How's this, Mom? Better? Will
dialog: you please talk to me?
text: Joker leans in closer to the door. Leaning against it with
dialog: just his head--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: MOM (OS)
dialog: He is an extraordinary man, Arthur.
dialog: We had a connection. I was so
dialog: beautiful then. We were in love.
text: Joker just leans there, listening. He closes his eyes, it's
dialog: all too much.
speaker_heading: MOM (OS)
text: His wife could see it. She was
dialog: jealous from the moment I started
dialog: working there. She fired me before
dialog: I even knew I was pregnant with
dialog: you.
dialog: (hear her crying now)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: MOM (OS) (CONT'D)
dialog: And, I never told him or anybody
dialog: because, well, you can imagine what
dialog: people would say about Thomas and
dialog: me, and, and what they would say
dialog: about you.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (eyes still closed, head
dialog: leaning against the door)
dialog: What would they say, Ma?
speaker_heading: MOM (OS)
dialog: That I was a whore, and Thomas
dialog: Wayne was a fornicator, and that
dialog: you're a little, unwanted bastard.
text: AND THE BATHROOM DOOR SUDDENLY SWINGS OPEN, and Joker falls
dialog: face first into the bathroom--
text: Just missing his mother, crashing down onto the floor--
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 51 EXT. BOARDWALK, AMUSEMENT MILE - MORNING 51
text: Joker heads down the boardwalk toward Ha-Ha's, a bounce in
dialog: his step.
text: Looming behind him like the skeletons of monsters, a
text: sprawling rickety-looking wooden roller coaster and the
text: gigantic steel Wonder Wheel in the amusement park by the
text: ocean. Sound of waves crashing, seagulls squawking.
scene_heading: 52 INT. HA-HA'S TALENT BOOKING, LOCKER ROOM - MORNING 52
text: Joker walks into the locker room, sees Randall half-dressed
text: for work, red nose, big pants, big shoes, no wig yet, sitting
text: with Gary, TWO OTHER CLOWNS AND A MAGICIAN around the small
text: table, shooting the shit, drinking coffee.
text: They nod hello at Joker or give him a perfunctory wave, most
text: of his co-workers think he's a freak.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Hey Art, I heard what happened--
dialog: I'm sorry man.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Yeah, Hoyt did you wrong, buddy.
dialog: Doesn't seem fair.
dialog: 54.
text: Joker looks hard at Randall for a moment, just slowly nods,
text: and continues on to his locker.
text: He starts to clean it out, stuffing all of his clown gear
text: into an old brown paper shopping bag. Hears them talking
text: about him behind his back, about why he got fired, laughing
dialog: at him--
speaker_heading: HA-HA CLOWN #1 (OS)
dialog: Did you really bring a gun to the
dialog: kid's hospital, Artie? What the
dialog: fuck would you do that for?
text: Joker doesn't answer them, just continues emptying his
text: locker, a bag of balloons, a magic wand, some trick flowers--
speaker_heading: HA-HA CLOWN #2
dialog: No, I heard he pulled it out and
text: waved it around like a cowboy.
text: His co-workers crack up. Joker answers the guy without
dialog: looking back--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: It was a prop gun. And I didn't
text: pull it out, it fell out.
speaker_heading: MAGICIAN
dialog: So is that part of your new act? If
dialog: your singing doesn't do the trick,
dialog: you just gonna shoot yourself?
dialog: More laughter.
speaker_heading: HA-HA CLOWN #2
dialog: I thought Jingles was a lover not a
dialog: fighter.
text: Joker turns and looks at all of them, nods at Randall--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Why don't you ask Randall about it?
dialog: It was his idea.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: (to Randall)
dialog: Since when do you use a prop gun?
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: What? I don't. Stop talking outta
dialog: your ass, Art!
dialog: (to the guys)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: RANDALL (CONT'D)
dialog: I think all his stupid laughing
dialog: musta scrambled his brain or
dialog: something.
text: The guys laugh and keep jawing. Joker doesn't say anything.
text: Just finishes packing his bag and closes his locker door--
scene_heading: 53 EXT. HA-HA'S, BACK ALLEY - AMUSEMENT MILE BOARDWALK - MORNING
dialog: 53
text: Joker exits the back door holding onto his brown shopping bag
text: under his arm, starts down the alley.
text: Behind him, Randall hustles out and chases down the alley
text: after him, still half-dressed for work.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Art! Hold up,--
text: As he catches up with Joker his red nose falls off, but he's
text: so out of breath he doesn't realize he lost it--
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: What the fuck was that about?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Why would you say that? That, that
dialog: it was my idea.
text: Joker just looks back at Randall. Sees his red Styrofoam nose
text: bouncing down the alley behind him.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: ...
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: You don't get it, do you, buddy,
dialog: that shit that went down on the
dialog: subway, that's no joke. They got
text: clown sketches on the front of
dialog: every fucking paper. It's just a
dialog: matter of time before the cops come
dialog: around.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I don't know anything about it.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: (leans in close; lowers
dialog: his voice)
dialog: Art, you know you're my boy. I'm
dialog: not gonna say shit. I just hope you
dialog: got rid of that gun. That can't
dialog: come back on me, okay?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Randall, I didn't shoot anybody.
dialog: That wasn't me. And I don't have
dialog: time for this, I got somebody real
dialog: important I gotta go see.
dialog: Joker turns to go--
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: You know they're sellin' masks.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (turning back around)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: They're selling masks of your clown
dialog: face,-- based off the description I
dialog: guess. It's like a thing now.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: There's a lot of people in this
dialog: city who are happy you did what you
dialog: did. If you did it.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Randall. Your nose.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: What?
text: Randall touches his face. Realizes his nose is not there.
text: Joker points to Randall's clown nose tumbling back down the
text: alley. And Randall hustles after it, chasing after his red
text: nose blowing skipping away in the wind--

speaker_heading: NEXT AFTERNOON
scene_heading: CLOSE ON NEW "KILLER CLOWN" SKETCH ON FRONT PAGE OF THAT

dialog: SUB-HEAD, "'Kill the Rich' -- A New Movement?"
text: ANGLE ON JOKER LOOKING DOWN AT HIS NOTEBOOK, STARING AT A
text: PHOTOGRAPH OF THOMAS WAYNE RIPPED OUT FROM A MAGAZINE, taped
text: to a page. He glances at his distorted reflection in the
text: window, takes his hand and parts his hair to the side, more
text: like Thomas Wayne's hair. Maybe there is a resemblance.
text: WIDER ANGLE, train is packed with wealthy white businessmen
text: and a couple businesswomen heading home after work, many of
text: them reading the same tabloid. The "Killer Clown" sketch of
text: Joker's clown face dots the train. No empty seats -- except
dialog: the one next to Joker.
scene_heading: 55 INT. TAXI CAB (MOVING), COUNTRYSIDE - AFTERNOON 55
text: JOKER IN THE BACK OF A TAXI STARING OUT AT THE COUNTRYSIDE,
text: at the trees and green grass and blue sky and open spaces
text: whizzing by. The sun is getting low, bathing everything in a
text: golden light.
text: He doesn't see garbage anywhere.
scene_heading: 56 EXT. WAYNE MANOR, FRONT LAWN - MAGIC HOUR 56
text: Joker walking along an intimidating wrought iron fence,
text: surrounding the estate like prison bars, the brown paper
text: shopping bag stuffed under his arm. The big house set up a
text: small hill, evergreens dot the lush grounds. As he walks
text: around looking for the front entrance, Joker catches a
text: glimpse of an innocent looking EIGHT-YEAR-OLD BOY tracking
text: him from behind the trees, hiding as he follows.
text: Joker stops.
text: He sees the boy stop behind a tree.
text: Joker continues walking until he gets to the front gate. He
text: digs into his bag and pulls out the magic wand--
text: He holds it up for the boy to see.
text: The boy steps out from behind a tree to get a closer look.
text: Joker puts the brown bag down on the ground, looks over the
text: wand, pretending like he's trying to figure out what it does.
text: He waves the wand over the front gate lock to "try and see"
dialog: if it will open-- It doesn't.
dialog: 58.
text: The little boy walks down toward the fence, face like an
dialog: angel.
text: Joker waits until he gets closer and then reaches his hand
text: through the fence and hands the kid his magic wand so he can
dialog: try and figure out what it does--
text: The boy takes the wand and it goes limp in his hand before he
text: can wave it-- He laughs, surprised. He hands it back to
dialog: Joker.
text: The boys sees Joker's face up close, staring at his scarred
dialog: smile--
text: Joker straightens the wand back out, and reaches in through
text: the fence again so the kid can give it another try.
text: AND AGAIN THE MAGIC WAND DROOPS IN THE BOY'S HAND. He laughs
dialog: and gives it back to Joker--
text: Joker examines the wand as if its "broken", stiffens it one
text: last time, crouches down lower, and...
text: Ta-da! A bouquet of flowers bursts out the end of the wand--
text: Joker smiles and hands him the wand bouquet of flowers--
text: The little boy takes the flowers. Keeps staring at Joker, at
text: the scars around his mouth.
text: Now, he reaches his hand out through the fence and touches
text: Joker's face, tracing his finger around the edges of Joker's
text: mouth, over his scarred smile--
text: Joker closes his eyes -- embarrassed -- but it feels good to
dialog: him, nobody ever touches him besides his mother.
text: He starts to smile, when a man's voice shatters the moment--
speaker_heading: ALFRED (OS)
dialog: (shouting; slight English
dialog: accent)
dialog: Bruce! What are you doing? Get away
dialog: from that man.
text: The little boy pulls his hand back. Turns and runs away--
text: Joker looks up and sees a balding, tired-looking, ALFRED
text: PENNYWORTH (50's) bounding down the hill toward them.
text: Joker stands back up.
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: (still shouting)
dialog: What are you doing? Who are you?
text: Little Bruce runs behind Alfred, hiding behind his legs.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: My name's Arthur. I'm here to see
dialog: Mr. Wayne--
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: You shouldn't be talking to his
dialog: son. Why did you give him those
dialog: flowers?
text: Alfred takes the flower-wand away from the kid--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I, I was just trying to make him
dialog: laugh.
text: He hands it back to Joker.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Well it's not funny. Do I need to
dialog: call the police?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: No, please. My mother's name is
dialog: Penny Fleck. She used to work here,
dialog: years ago. Can you tell Mr. Wayne
dialog: that I need to see him?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: (color drains from his
dialog: face; beat)
dialog: You're her son?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Did you know her?
text: Alfred doesn't say anything.
text: Joker puts his face right up against the bars, whispers so
dialog: the boy can't hear him--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: You don't need to cover for them.
dialog: I'm sure Mrs. Wayne was very upset
dialog: when she found out.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: There was nothing to find out
dialog: about. Your mother was, was
text: delusional. She was a sick woman.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: No. No, just let me speak to Mr.
dialog: Wayne.
text: Now Alfred leans in closer to Joker, almost looks like he
dialog: feels some pity for him--
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Please just go, before you make a
dialog: fool of yourself.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (blurts out)
dialog: Thomas Wayne is my father--
text: Alfred looks at Joker, and can't help but crack up laughing
text: at him.
text: AND JOKER REACHES THROUGH THE BARS AND GRABS HIM. Pulls him
text: in close, trying to choke him, still holding the wand of
dialog: flowers in one hand--
text: AS HE CHOKES ALFRED, Joker sees little Bruce, wide-eyed in
text: the shadows, looking out at him in horror.
text: Joker stops.
text: Lets go of Alfred... Takes off running back down the street
text: away from Wayne Manor, magic wand in hand, leaving the rest
text: of his clown gear behind.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 57 EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE, STREETS - NIGHT 57
text: JOKER'S BACK IN HIS PART OF TOWN, garbage everywhere here.
text: The neighborhood at night is alive. Loud kids on the street
text: corners... A drunk seemingly fights no one... Hookers working
text: the street... He hears a wailing siren...
text: As Joker turns the corner, he sees AN AMBULANCE PARKED in
text: front of his building. Lights flashing. Hit with a sense of
text: dread, he runs toward the building--
dialog: 61.
scene_heading: 58 EXT. STREET, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 58
text: A SMALL CROWD OF GAWKERS have gathered around watching the
text: drama unfold. Shouting and laughing, loud dance music blaring
text: out an open window, feels like an impromptu block party.
text: Joker runs up, sees his mother being wheeled down the front
text: steps unconscious on a stretcher, AN EMT holding an oxygen
text: bag on her face. TWO DETECTIVES IN PLAIN SUITS following
text: behind them. It's a chaotic scene.
text: FROM ABOVE, Joker pushing through the crowd, rushes to his
text: mother's side. We don't hear what he says to the paramedics
text: over the music and the crowd, just see them nod okay and
text: Joker follow after them into the back of the ambulance--
scene_heading: 59 INT. CITY AMBULANCE, BACK (PARKED) - NIGHT 59
text: Joker looking out the back doors as they start to shut close--
text: CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF SOPHIE, coming out of the building. He
text: stares at her through the small back door window. Casually
text: waves at her, trying to connect with her--
text: Joker sees the two detectives approaching Sophie as the

dialog: wailing--
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 60 INT. CITY HOSPITAL, EMERGENCY TREATMENT ROOM - NIGHT 60
text: Joker's standing near the doorway of a large overcrowded
text: treatment room. Watching a sleep-deprived ER RESIDENT (late
text: 20's), and an EMERGENCY NURSE start to intubate his mother.
text: He hears shouts and cries of pain from around the crowded
dialog: room.
text: Joker turns away when he sees them insert a thin endotracheal
text: tube into her mouth and down through her larynx. It makes him
dialog: gag--
scene_heading: 61 EXT. CITY HOSPITAL, ER - NIGHT 61
text: Joker sits on a bench outside the bustling emergency room.
dialog: He's getting some fresh air, but he picked a weird spot to do
dialog: it.
text: He watches the sick and dying being rushed through the glass
text: doors. Opening and closing. This happens in the background
text: throughout the scene.
dialog: 62.
text: The two detectives walk up to Joker, interrupting him
text: watching the doors. Gotham police detectives, GARRITY (50's),
text: grey hair, and BURKE (30's), his partner.
scene_heading: DET. GARRITY
dialog: Mr. Fleck, sorry to bother you, I'm
dialog: Detective Garrity, this is my
dialog: partner Detective Burke.
text: Joker looks up at them. Doesn't say anything.
scene_heading: DET. GARRITY
dialog: We had a few questions for you, but
dialog: you weren't home. So we spoke to
dialog: your mother.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: You did this to her?
scene_heading: DET. GARRITY
dialog: What? No. We just asked her some
dialog: questions and she started getting
text: hysterical-- hyperventilating,
dialog: trouble speaking-- then she
text: collapsed. Hit her head pretty
dialog: hard.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: They told me she had a stroke.
dialog: Beat.
scene_heading: DET. GARRITY
dialog: Sorry to hear that.
text: AND JOKER BURSTS OUT LAUGHING, he can't stop it.
text: The detectives are taken aback. They don't know what to make
text: of him laughing. They share a look.
scene_heading: DET. BURKE
dialog: (confused)
dialog: I'm lost. Is something funny?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (laughter choking up in
dialog: his throat)
dialog: No I,-- I have a, a--
text: Tears rolling down his face, he takes out one of his cards
text: and hands it to Det. Burke. Burke glances over the card, a
text: skeptical look on his face.
dialog: 63.
scene_heading: DET. BURKE
dialog: Okay. But we have some questions
dialog: for you.
scene_heading: DET. GARRITY
dialog: About those subway killings from a
dialog: few weeks ago.
text: Joker pauses for a moment, his laughter subsiding. He holds
text: his breath.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I don't know anything about that.
scene_heading: DET. GARRITY
dialog: We have an eyewitness who described
text: a white male, about 6 feet tall, in
text: clown make up. Or a clown mask.
dialog: Spoke to your boss at Ha-Ha's, Mr.
dialog: Vaughn, and he said you were on a
dialog: job the day of the shooting.
text: Joker's still holding his breath, he nods yes.
scene_heading: DET. GARRITY
dialog: (just continues)
dialog: He also said you got fired that
dialog: day,-- For bringing a gun into the
dialog: children's hospital.
text: And Joker cracks up again, his laughter coming back harder--
text: He covers his mouth with his hand, shaking his head no, his
text: face now turning red.
scene_heading: DET. GARRITY
dialog: You weren't fired?
text: Joker catches his breath as the intensity of his laughter
text: starts to wane, petering out.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Not for having a gun. That was prop
dialog: gun. Part of my act.
text: Joker's laughter finally stops for good.
scene_heading: DET. BURKE
dialog: So why were you fired?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: They said I wasn't funny.
text: The detectives share another look.
dialog: 64.
text: Joker stands up.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Now, if you don't mind, I have to
dialog: go back and look after my mother.
text: Detective Burke steps close to him, holds up the card that
dialog: Joker handed him--
scene_heading: DET. BURKE
dialog: Hey lemme ask you a question? This
dialog: condition of yours,-- Is this real
dialog: or is this like some sorta clown
dialog: thing?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Clown thing?
scene_heading: DET. BURKE
dialog: I mean, is it part of your act?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: What do you think?
text: And Joker walks away-- heads for the sliding glass doors.
dialog: Only the motion detector doesn't engage--
text: AND HE SLAMS RIGHT INTO THE GLASS DOOR.
speaker_heading: HARD.
text: He bounces back.
scene_heading: 62 INT. HALLWAY, NURSE'S STATION - CITY HOSPITAL - NIGHT 62
text: Joker walking down the hallway, ER flooded with the poor and
text: uninsured. Overwhelmed doctors and nurses trying their best
text: to keep up. He stops at the busy nurse's station, and stands
text: there for a moment, trying to get a nurse's attention--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Excuse me, I was wondering how I
dialog: could check my mother out of here?
text: One of the nurses at the desk looks up at him, seems slightly
dialog: annoyed.
speaker_heading: ER NURSE
dialog: What's your mother's name?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Penny Fleck. I'd like to take her
dialog: home.
dialog: 65.
text: The sleep-deprived ER RESIDENT who was working on his mother
text: overhears Joker, comes over to talk to him with a clipboard
text: in his hand. Joker recognizes him--
speaker_heading: ER RESIDENT
dialog: Mr. Fleck, your mother had a
dialog: stroke. It's very serious. You
dialog: can't "check her out." She's gonna
dialog: be here for at least a week.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: She's not gonna wanna stay that
dialog: long. She doesn't like hospitals.
dialog: Or doctors.
speaker_heading: ER RESIDENT
dialog: I'm sorry to hear that. But she
dialog: can't just leave.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I don't like hospitals either.
dialog: Beat.
text: The resident just nods okay. Looks down at his clipboard--
speaker_heading: ER RESIDENT
dialog: Listen, I wanted to talk you about
dialog: something we noticed in her tox
dialog: report. We found heavy traces of
text: multiple medications in her system.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Okay. Thanks.
text: He turns to go, but the resident continues--
speaker_heading: ER RESIDENT
dialog: One of them's perphenazine. It's a
dialog: powerful anti-psychotic. If she was
dialog: taking that regularly and then
text: suddenly stopped, the withdrawal
dialog: could have contributed to her
dialog: stroke. Did you notice any
dialog: symptoms?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Symptoms?
speaker_heading: ER RESIDENT
dialog: Withdrawal symptoms. Nausea...
text: anxiety... hallucinations.
text: Joker shakes his head, no.
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: ER RESIDENT
dialog: Do you know how long she's been
dialog: taking it?
text: Joker shakes his head no again, leans in closer to the

text: Murray Franklin cracks up at his own joke. Studio audience
dialog: laughs.
text: JOKER LAUGHS, LYING IN BED NEXT TO HIS UNCONSCIOUS MOTHER in
text: the large overcrowded treatment room.
text: Blue curtain dividers separate the bays. He's watching the

text: mother, laughing over the sounds of her labored breath, the
dialog: pain and suffering of those around him.
text: He looks back up at the television.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON TV)
dialog: And finally, in a world where
dialog: everyone thinks they could do my

dialog: Good to be here.

dialog: "You should enjoy it. One day

speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON TV)

text: a trance. Unsure if this is really happening.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON TV)
dialog: One more, Bernie. Let's see one
dialog: more. I love this guy.
text: The tape continues of Joker at the comedy club.
speaker_heading: JOKER (ON TV)

text: up the air, crashing down hard onto the floor.
scene_heading: 64 INT. CAFETERIA, CITY HOSPITAL - EARLY MORNING 64
text: Joker walks with a plastic tray of food. Some runny eggs and

text: There are a few DOCTORS AND NURSES sitting and chatting at
text: one table. A group of ORDERLIES are sitting together at
dialog: another table.
text: He goes and sits down in the far corner, far away from

speaker_heading: YOUNG DOCTOR (OS)
dialog: No. It was definitely you, buddy.
dialog: You're the guy who couldn't stop

scene_heading: 65 EXT. CENTER FOR PERFORMING ARTS, WAYNE HALL - UPTOWN - DUSK
dialog: 65
text: Joker crosses a busy street heading to the Center for
text: Performing Arts. Light falling. Storm clouds gathering.
dialog: 70.
text: Joker stops when he sees--
text: A CROWD OF PROTESTERS SCREAMING AND SHOUTING IN FRONT OF
text: WAYNE HALL, behind steel barricades. Many wearing Joker's
text: "clown face" mask... A few wave homemade signs, "CLOWN FOR
text: MAYOR"... "KILL THE RICH"... "MR. WAYNE, AM I A CLOWN?"
text: A LINE OF POLICEMEN AND SECURITY GUARDS stand between the
text: crowd and the lit-up white marble building.
text: Joker watches the protest for a moment, then continues across
text: the street. It starts to rain.
scene_heading: 66 EXT. WAYNE HALL, FRONT ENTRANCE - EVENING 66
text: A FIGHT BREAKS OUT between a "clown" masked protester and two
text: cops. The crowd goes crazy, pushing through the barricades
text: toward the building in the driving rain. The police and Wayne
dialog: Hall Security fight to keep them out--
text: Amidst all the chaos, we glimpse Joker slipping into the
dialog: building unnoticed--
scene_heading: 67 INT. LOBBY, WAYNE HALL - EVENING 67
text: Joker walks through the massive multi-level lobby. It's
text: completely empty since the performance has already begun and
text: whatever security was available is outside helping the police
dialog: deal with the protesters.
text: He looks up in awe at the crystal chandeliers... The shiny,
text: marble floor beneath his feet. He's never seen anything this
text: opulent in his entire life.
scene_heading: 68 INT. BACK OF THEATER, WAYNE HALL - EVENING 68
text: JOKER MAKING HIS WAY THROUGH THE DARK SHADOWS ALONG THE BACK
text: WALL OF THE AUDITORIUM, looking for Thomas Wayne in the sold-
dialog: out black-tie audience--
text: He catches bits of Chaplin's MODERN TIMES projected on a
text: screen behind the Gotham Philharmonic playing the silent
text: movie's score... the Tramp roller skating blindfolded on a
text: date with the Gamin (Paulette Goddard) in a department store.
text: He continues moving along the wall from aisle-to-aisle
dialog: looking for Thomas Wayne...
text: The audience laughs as the Tramp skates blindfolded, skirting
text: along the edge of a balcony with no rail, orchestra playing
text: the bouncy score. Joker can't find Thomas Wayne in the dark--
dialog: 71.
text: He moves to the top of the next aisle, pausing to watch more
text: of the film. Suddenly somebody bumps into Joker--
text: He looks up and sees it's one of Thomas Wayne's TWO SECURITY
text: GUARDS, escorting Thomas Wayne out of the auditorium--
text: Joker turns and watches them lead him out. Behind Joker on
text: screen, the Tramp is rescued by the girl before he falls off
dialog: the edge, orchestra swelling--
scene_heading: 69 INT. LOBBY, WAYNE HALL - CONTINUOUS 69
text: Joker peeks his head out of the auditorium, sees Thomas Wayne
text: heading into the men's room, his two security guards waiting
text: by the door, still hear the orchestra playing the score--
text: Joker glances back into the auditorium--
text: Sees a lobby broom and upright dustpan tucked in the back
dialog: corner--
scene_heading: 70 INT. HALLWAY, MEN'S ROOM - WAYNE HALL - SECONDS LATER 70
text: Joker's sweeping up the hallway with his head down, hear the
text: orchestra playing the melancholy "Smile" from the film's
text: score. He sweeps along to the music like Emmett Kelly's
text: famous hobo clown... Sweeping around the two security guards'
text: feet... Annoyed, they move a bit away from the bathroom
text: door... And don't give Joker a second look as he heads
dialog: inside...
scene_heading: 71 INT. MEN'S ROOM, WAYNE HALL - CONTINUOUS 71
text: Joker sweeps his way into the cavernous, black &amp; white tiled
text: bathroom, ornate gold fixtures. It's empty save for Thomas
text: Wayne peeing at the far end of a long line of urinals.
text: Joker takes a deep breath, and walks down the line of urinals
dialog: right up next to Thomas Wayne--
text: He stands there for a beat while Thomas urinates, lobby broom
dialog: and upright dustpan in hand--
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE
dialog: (glances over; annoyed)
dialog: Can I help you, pal?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: What? Yeah. No I, I--
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: You need to get in here or
dialog: something?
text: Thomas Wayne finishes and zips his fly back up. Joker is not
dialog: sure what to say to him, just says--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Dad. It's me.
dialog: Beat.
text: But Thomas Wayne doesn't hear him, he was flushing the
text: urinal. He walks toward the sink.
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE
dialog: Excuse me?
text: Joker follows after him.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: My name is Arthur. I'm Penny's son.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I know you didn't know about me,
dialog: and I don't want anything from you.
dialog: Well... maybe a hug.
text: And Joker smiles, it's all very emotional for him. Thomas
text: looks over at him like he's fucking crazy.
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE
dialog: Jesus? You're the guy who came by
dialog: my house yesterday.
text: Joker nods, relieved he finally broke through.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Yes. But they wouldn't let me in,
dialog: wouldn't let me see you. So I came
dialog: here. I have so many questions.
text: Thomas Wayne just laughs to himself and turns on the gold
text: faucets at one of the sinks.
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE
dialog: Look pal, I'm not your father.
dialog: What's wrong with you?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: How do you know?
text: Thomas Wayne just keeps washing his hands, doesn't even look
text: over at Joker.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE
dialog: Cause you were adopted. And I never
dialog: fucked your mother. What do you
dialog: want from me, money?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: No. What? I wasn't adopted.
text: Thomas starts drying his hands.
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE
dialog: She never told you? Your mother
dialog: adopted you before she even started
dialog: working for us. She was arrested
dialog: when you were four years old and
dialog: committed to Arkham State Hospital.
dialog: She's batshit crazy.
text: Joker starts to smile, feels a laugh coming on.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: No. No, I don't believe that.
text: Thomas finishes drying his hands. Turns to Joker, his tone
dialog: way more serious now.
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE
dialog: I don't really give a shit what you
dialog: believe.
dialog: (steps in closer)
dialog: But if you ever come to my house
dialog: again, if you ever talk to my son
dialog: again, if I ever even hear about
dialog: you again, I'll--
text: AND JOKER CRACKS UP LAUGHING, interrupting his threat.
text: Laughing right in his face--
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE
dialog: Are you laughing at me?
text: Joker's laughing so hard he can't answer.
text: THOMAS SHOVES JOKER HARD UP AGAINST THE TILED WALL, gripping
text: his neck with one hand. Joker just cracks up louder, he drops
dialog: the dustpan and broom--
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: You think this is funny?
text: Thomas Wayne's security guards bang open the door, rushing
text: into the bathroom when they hear the shouting--
dialog: 74.
text: They stop when they see Thomas has Joker jacked up against
dialog: the wall.
speaker_heading: JOKER
text: (tries shaking his head
dialog: no; still laughing and
dialog: choking)
dialog: No, no I have a con--
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE
dialog: (interrupting; raising his
dialog: voice)
dialog: Is this a fucking joke to you?
text: AND THOMAS WAYNE PUNCHES JOKER STRAIGHT IN THE FACE with his
text: free hand, blood spraying from his nose--
scene_heading: 72 EXT. WAYNE HALL, FRONT ENTRANCE - PLAZA - NIGHT 72
text: The two security guards roughly throw Joker out of the hall,
text: right in front of the drenched crowd of screaming protesters,
text: TV cameras and photographers now on hand, bulbs flashing--
text: Joker knowing how to take a fall, plays it up in front of
dialog: this audience for all it's worth, tumbling end-over-end out
text: onto the plaza in the rain--
text: He rolls to his feet with a bit of panache and brushes
text: himself off like it was nothing.
text: The protesters go crazy, cheering and applauding his act--
text: And Joker takes a deep dramatic bow. Wet hair. Bloody nose.
text: He turns and sees the security guards coming back out--
text: Joker takes off running through the plaza in the downpour,
text: running out of the Center for Performing Arts. Turns down a
dialog: side street almost slipping--
text: And keeps running even though nobody's chasing after him.
text: We HEAR the familiar beats of THE SUGARHILL GANG'S "Apache"
text: as Joker just keeps running and running.
scene_heading: 73 INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY - NIGHT 73
text: Joker knocking on Sophie's apartment door, "Apache" blaring
text: inside. He's soaking wet, clothes clinging to his body.
text: There's no answer.
dialog: 75.

text: Now he tries the door. It's unlocked.
scene_heading: 74 INT. SOPHIE'S APARTMENT, FRONT HALL - CONTINUOUS 74
text: Joker walks into Sophie's apartment, "Apache" thumping,

speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Sophie?
text: WALKS INTO THE DARK LIVING ROOM, catches a glimpse of Sophie,
text: naked riding on top of SOME GUY on the couch--

scene_heading: 75 INT. HALLWAY, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 75
text: Joker rushing for his mother's apartment.
text: Behind him, the guy comes out half naked into the hallway,
text: zipping up his pants, screaming at Joker--
text: Joker doesn't look back, doesn't hear the guy yelling at him--
text: Quickly opens the door to his mother's apartment and hurries
dialog: inside.
scene_heading: 76 EXT. ARKHAM STATE HOSPITAL - MORNING 76
text: A GRAY, BEHEMOTH STATE HOSPITAL looming over the city block.
text: Metal screens cover steel-framed windows. Joker crosses the
text: street toward the building, eyes weary, he hasn't slept in
dialog: days.
text: HE SEES TWO GOTHAM CITY COPS AND A PARAMEDIC rolling a gurney
text: into the entrance... a naked, sunburned man screaming his
text: head off is handcuffed to the stretcher underneath a white
text: sheet. Joker follows them inside.
scene_heading: 77 INT. ARKHAM STATE HOSPITAL - ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE - MORNING
dialog: 77
text: Joker sits waiting in a cramped office, looking out a
text: plexiglass window that overlooks the crowded hallway--
dialog: 76.
text: A constant din of people moving about, talking and shouting.
text: Patients handcuffed to the armrests of their wheelchairs,
text: lying on stretchers, heads covered with pillowcase turbans or
text: forearms to block out the harsh fluorescent lights.
text: His gaze is interrupted by a CLERK (40's), ID clipped to his
text: shirt, who's lugging an old heavy file storage box.
text: He drops the box down on his messy desk with a thud.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Sorry for the wait. All our records
dialog: that are 10 years or older are
dialog: stored in the basement. You're
dialog: talking over 30 years ago,-- I had
dialog: to do some serious digging.
text: Joker nods thanks.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Like I said, if it's in here, I'm
dialog: still gonna need a release from
dialog: her.
text: The clerk opens the file box. Starts digging though it. Joker
text: stares out the plexiglass window that faces the hallway--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Can I ask you a question? How does
dialog: someone wind up in here? Have all
dialog: these people committed crimes?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (going through the files)
dialog: Some have. Some are just crazy and
dialog: pose a danger to themselves or
dialog: others. Some just got nowhere else
dialog: to go.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (nods; looks down)
dialog: Yeah, I know how that is. Sometimes
dialog: I don't know what to do, y'know, I
dialog: don't think I can take any more of
dialog: this.
text: The clerk is half listening as he scans the paper work.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Yeah, I can't take much more of
dialog: this shit either.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: CLERK (CONT'D)
dialog: Now they talking about more
dialog: layoffs, man, we're understaffed as
dialog: it is. I don't know what I'm gonna
dialog: do.
text: Joker looks up at the guy, thinking he's made a connection.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Last time I ended up taking it out
dialog: on some,-- people. Bad shit. I
dialog: thought it would bother me but, it
dialog: really hasn't.
text: For the first time, the clerk looks at him--
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: It's just so hard to try and be
dialog: happy all the time, y'know, when
dialog: everything's going to shit all
dialog: around you.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (taken aback; beat)
dialog: Listen, I'm just an administrative
dialog: assistant, like a clerk. I file
dialog: paperwork, fill out forms. I don't
dialog: really know what to tell you, but
dialog: maybe you should see someone-- they
dialog: have programs, like city services.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (backtracking)
dialog: Yeah. They cut those. Anyway, I was
dialog: just talking to talk.
text: The clerk just nods. Finally finds what he was looking for.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Here it is,-- Fleck. Penny Fleck.
text: He pulls out an old file, bulging with yellowing records.
text: Moves the box to the floor and sits down at his desk.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (saying it out loud for
dialog: himself to hear)
dialog: So she was a patient here.
text: The guy opens the file. Yellowing pages of her records--
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (nods, skim-reading)
text: Uh-huh. Diagnosed by Dr. Benjamin
dialog: Stoner... The patient suffers from
dialog: delusional psychosis and
dialog: narcissistic personality
dialog: disorder... Found guilty of
dialog: endangering the welfare of a child--
text: The clerk stops reading out loud, eyes going wide as he skims
text: further ahead. Joker just looks at the guy, waiting to see
dialog: what he's gonna say.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: You said she's your mother?
text: Joker just nods.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (closes the file)
dialog: I'm sorry, I can't. Like I said, I
dialog: can't release this without the
dialog: proper forms. I could get in
dialog: trouble.
dialog: (closes the file; beat)
dialog: Besides, it's pretty bad.
text: CLOSE ON JOKER, he shakes his head and smiles to himself.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I can handle bad. I've been on a
dialog: pretty bad run myself.
text: The clerk puts the file down on his desk--
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: I can't help you. If you want these
dialog: records you have to get your mom to
dialog: sign a patient disclosure form. I
dialog: can have someone mail you one.
text: Joker just sits there, thinking it all over for a moment.
text: Then snatches the file off the clerk's desk--
text: The clerk grabs it as well.
text: They play tug-of-war with the file, it's awkward and goes on
text: way too long. Finally, Joker shoves the guy hard and pulls
dialog: the file away--
dialog: 79.
text: He takes off running out of the office with it. The clerk
text: watches for a beat, but does nothing.
scene_heading: 78 INT. HALLWAY, ARKHAM STATE HOSPITAL - MORNING 78
text: Joker running down the hallway, files in his hands. Frantic.
text: Unaware he is not being chased.
text: Turns a corner and runs down another long hallway.
text: Gets to a stairwell door and runs in.
scene_heading: 79 INT. STAIRWELL, ARKHAM STATE HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS 79
text: Bounding down the steps. He stops at a landing below. Looks
text: up, sees no one is chasing after him--
text: ANGLE ON JOKER, catching his breath. He opens the file,
text: flipping through the records, finds the page the clerk was
text: reading. As he reads it over for himself, he HEARS his mother
dialog: being interviewed for her psychiatric assessment, over 30
dialog: years ago.
speaker_heading: MOM (VO)
dialog: He's not adopted-- he's Thomas
dialog: Wayne's son. I work for him, I told

text: Dr. Stoner is going over Penny's thick file, the same file
text: Joker's holding in his hands.
speaker_heading: DR. STONER
dialog: We went over this, Penny. You
dialog: adopted him. We have all the
dialog: paperwork right here.
text: Penny doesn't say anything, just smiles like she's in on a

dialog: 80.
text: Dr. Stoner keeps going through the file, pulls out black &amp;
text: white forensic photographs of three-year-old Joker's body--
speaker_heading: DR. STONER
dialog: You also stood by as one of your
dialog: boyfriends repeatedly abused your
dialog: adopted son. And battered you.
text: Penny looks at Dr. Stoner like he's crazy.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: He didn't do anything to me. Or to
dialog: my boy. Can I go now, I don't like
dialog: hospitals.
text: Dr. Stoner lays out the photographs in front of Penny--
text: Penny keeps smoking her cigarette, glances down at the
text: photos, we catch glimpses of various bruises on parts of

dialog: radiator...
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
text: Joker looking over the same black &amp; white photographs, still
dialog: HEARS his mother--
speaker_heading: MOM (V0)
dialog: I never heard him crying. Not once.

speaker_heading: DR. STONER (VO)
dialog: Penny, your son was found tied to a
dialog: radiator in your filthy apartment,
text: malnourished, with multiple bruises

text: Joker looks up from the file when he hears/reads this, turns
text: and looks at Penny's reaction-- HE'S NOW IN THE INTERVIEW
text: ROOM WITH THEM, living what he's reading on the page.
text: He sees his mother lean forward in her chair, glaring at Dr.
dialog: Stoner--
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: That's not true. My apartment
dialog: wasn't filthy. I keep a clean
dialog: house.
text: Joker just stares at his mother.
text: Dr. Stoner looks at Penny, not sure how to respond to that.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: DR. STONER
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And what do you have to say about
dialog: your son?
text: ANGLE ON PENNY, thinking it over, taking a drag off her
dialog: cigarette.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: I'm just glad I got to know him.

text: Before GiGi leaves Joker looks down at her--
speaker_heading: JOKER

speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: JOKER (CONT'D)
dialog: Happy?! I'm not happy. I haven't
dialog: been happy for one minute of my
dialog: entire fucking life.
text: He reaches behind her, grabs one of her pillows--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: But you know what's funny? You know
dialog: what really makes me laugh?
text: Leans down closer, face-to-face with her--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I used to think my life was nothing
dialog: but a tragedy, but now, now I
dialog: realize it's all just a fucking
dialog: comedy.
scene_heading: 85 INT. BLUE CURTAIN, HOSPITAL ROOM (SHARED) - CONTINUOUS 85
text: Other side of the blue divider curtain. We see Joker's feet
text: shifting a little.
text: SLOWLY WE PULL OUT, backing out of the room. Leaving behind
text: whatever Joker's doing to his mother on the other side of the
text: curtain. And we HEAR applause...
scene_heading: 86 INT. MOM'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 86
text: JOKER'S STUDYING VHS TAPES OF "MURRAY FRANKLIN LIVE!", studio
text: audience applauding Murray... He jots down notes in his worn
text: notebook... Watches the guests come out... how they cross the
text: stage... how they greet Murray... how they sit down... if
dialog: they cross their legs or not... studying how he should act,
dialog: how to be a person like other people.
text: His cat sits on top of the TV watching him the whole time,
text: never taking her eyes off him.
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT:
text: Practicing. Joker walks across the living room like he's on
text: the show, smiling, waving to the "audience"... He mimes
text: shaking Murray's hand... Mimes unbuttoning his jacket and
text: sits down. He smiles and pulls out his worn notebook from his
dialog: pocket--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: You wanna hear a joke, Murray?
text: He "waits" for Murray to answer. Then Joker nods okay and
dialog: opens his notebook--
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (reading)
dialog: Knock-knock.
text: His cat still watching him, now at his feet. Joker crosses
text: and uncrosses his legs... Looks uncomfortable.
text: He glances down at his cat. It's as if he can hear the cat
text: talking to him.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (nods; frustrated)
dialog: Yeah, I don't know if I should
dialog: cross or uncross 'em. Both feel
dialog: completely unnatural.
text: Joker gets up off the couch and walks back across the living
text: room. Waves to the "audience"... Mimes shaking Murray's
text: hand... Mimes unbuttoning his coat and sits down... Crosses
text: his legs.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Thanks for having me on, Murray. I
dialog: can't tell you how much this means
dialog: to me, it's been a life long dream.
dialog: I have a joke for you--
text: Joker stands back up.
text: Looks down at the cat again.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: You're right. You're right,
dialog: uncrossed is better.
text: Joker sits back down... Doesn't cross his legs this time.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 87 EXT. POTTER'S FIELD CEMETERY - DUSK 87
text: WIDE SHOT, a lone figure in a vast sea of mass graves, grey
dialog: headstones. This is where they bury the poor and the
text: unclaimed dead.
text: Joker stands by his mother's grave. His head bowed, face in
text: his hands, his body convulsing. He's dressed in an ill-
text: fitting faded rust colored suit, almost shiny from all the
text: wear. Behind him in the distance, the TWO DETECTIVES stand by
text: their parked car on the cemetery roadway. Sun dying in the
dialog: sky.
dialog: 88.
text: CLOSE ON JOKER'S FACE BURIED IN HIS HANDS, see he's laughing--
text: impossible to tell if he's laughing because of his condition
dialog: or laughing for real.
scene_heading: 88 EXT. ROADWAY, POTTER'S FIELD CEMETERY - DUSK 88
text: Joker walking away from his mother's grave, goes to the two
text: detectives -- GARRITY and BURKE -- waiting for him by their
text: unmarked car. His face is still red, tears in his eyes from
dialog: laughing.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (wiping his eyes;
dialog: restrained anger)
dialog: You shouldn't be here. It's not
dialog: right.
scene_heading: DET. GARRITY
dialog: We just came to pay our respects.
dialog: Sorry about your mother.
scene_heading: DET. BURKE
dialog: Yeah, it's too bad.
text: Joker just stares at the two detectives.
text: Awkward beat.
scene_heading: DET. BURKE
dialog: Where is everybody?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: It's always been just me and her.
text: Joker pauses for a moment, then starts to walk away.
scene_heading: DET. BURKE
dialog: (calls out)
dialog: We saw you on Murray Franklin.
text: Joker turns back to them.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: You saw that?
scene_heading: DET. GARRITY
dialog: Yeah. Heard you were on, so we got
text: a videotape.
scene_heading: DET. BURKE
dialog: I just couldn't tell if you were
dialog: actually trying to be funny or not.
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Yeah, well I guess you didn't get
dialog: the joke.
scene_heading: DET. GARRITY
dialog: Listen, we need to clear a few
dialog: things up, we spoke to the hospital
dialog: administrator--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Which hospital?
scene_heading: DET. BURKE
dialog: The Children's Hospital.
dialog: (reminding)
dialog: The night you were fired. He said
dialog: it didn't look like a prop gun, it
dialog: was heavy, like a real one. We have
dialog: some more questions for you.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I just buried my mother.
text: The detectives share a look. Garrity pulls out a card. Hands
dialog: it to Joker.
scene_heading: DET. GARRITY
dialog: We can do it tomorrow. But you need
dialog: to come down to the precinct--
dialog: first thing in the morning.
speaker_heading: JOKER
text: (looks down, reading the
dialog: card)
dialog: Right. Thanks for coming.
scene_heading: DET. BURKE
dialog: Of course.
text: Joker looks back up.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: That was a joke.
text: We hear applause followed by the familiar opening riff to
text: ELTON JOHN'S "Bennie &amp; the Jets".
scene_heading: 89 INT. MOM'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NEXT AFTERNOON 89
text: JOKER'S LEANING OVER THE BATHROOM SINK, water running. He's
text: wearing rust colored pants and a white "beater" T-shirt.
dialog: 90.
text: A "Joker" clown mask hangs off the dirty mirror by its
text: elastic band. "Bennie &amp; the Jets" blaring from a transistor
text: radio turned all the way up.
text: Joker lifts his head up. He's dyed his hair green like his
text: old "Mr. Jingles" clown wig-- but he's missed spots. Some of
text: his hair is still its original color, sticking out all helter-
text: skelter.
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT:
text: Now he's smearing white grease-paint all over his face.
text: He's dancing along to the music, gyrating and thrusting his
text: hips to the beat, as he glances at the mask hanging from the
text: mirror, trying to copy how it looks... A copy of a copy of
dialog: himself.
text: He barely hears someone banging on the front door over the
dialog: loud music--
text: Doesn't answer. Joker just keeps putting on his make-up,
text: dancing provocatively to the music.
text: More banging on the front door.
text: Joker casually opens the medicine cabinet. Finds some old
text: rusty scissors and turns the radio off--
scene_heading: 90 INT. FRONT DOOR, MOM'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON 90
text: Joker unlocks the locks, keeping the security chain latched,
text: and cracks open the door,-- Sees Randall. Looks down, and
text: sees Gary next to him. Undoes the chain and opens the door
dialog: for them--
text: Randall and Gary get a look at Joker's face, his dyed green
text: hair still wet, streaking white grease-paint smeared over
dialog: part of his face--
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: (re: his look)
dialog: Hey Arthur, how's it going? You get
dialog: a new gig?
text: Joker shakes his head no, steps aside so they can come in,
text: palming the scissors in his hand--
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: You must be goin' down to that
dialog: rally at City Hall. Right? I hear
dialog: it's gonna be nuts.
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Is that today?
text: Randall looks at him and laughs--
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Yeah. What's with the clown-face
dialog: then?
text: Joker shuts the door behind them. Locks the chain-lock.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: My mom died.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Yeah we heard. That's why we're
dialog: here. Figured you might wanna go
dialog: out, get a drink or something?
text: Joker doesn't answer.
text: Awkward beat.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: We don't wanna bother you. Randall
dialog: just thought we should come and pay
dialog: our respects.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Yeah, we're family. We gotta stick
dialog: together.
text: Joker stares at Randall.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's not a good time. I'm in the
dialog: middle of something here.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Of course. No problem. Another
dialog: time.
text: Gary turns to go. Randall pauses for a moment, has something
dialog: else to say before he leaves--
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Yeah. Another time, then. Oh hey,--
dialog: one other thing--
text: He takes a step closer to Joker--
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Listen, the cops have been poking
text: around the shop, they're talking to
dialog: all the clowns about those subway
dialog: murders and--
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: They didn't talk to me.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: (snaps at Gary)
dialog: That's because the suspect was a
dialog: regular-sized person. If it was a
dialog: fucking midget you'd be in jail
dialog: right now.
dialog: (turns back to Joker)
dialog: Anyway, Hoyt said they were looking
dialog: for me, and, and I just wanna see
dialog: what you said. You know, make sure
dialog: our stories line up, bein' that
dialog: you're my boy and--
text: AND JOKER STABS THE SCISSORS AS DEEP AS HE CAN into Randall's
text: neck. Blood spurts. Randall screams. Gary stumbles back in
dialog: shock--
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: What the fuck what the fuck WHAT
speaker_heading: THE FUCK--
text: Joker pulls them out and jams them into Randall's eye before
text: he can react. The sound is sickening. Gary's screaming in the
dialog: background--
text: Randall blindly fights back, screaming in pain, flailing his
text: arms, his own blood blinding him--
text: Joker grabs Randall by the head -- all of his pent up rage
text: and frustration pouring out of him -- AND SLAMS HIS HEAD
text: AGAINST THE WALL.
scene_heading: AGAIN. And AGAIN. And AGAIN.
text: Joker lets go of Randall's head, and Randall drops to the
text: ground. Joker leans back against the wall, out of breath,
text: kind of slides down the wall to the floor--
text: Sees Gary huddled in the corner, trembling with fear--
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (catching his breath)
dialog: I'm gonna be on TV tonight. Can you
dialog: believe it?
text: Gary doesn't answer. Doesn't move--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: It's okay, Gary. You can go.
text: Gary backs away toward the door. Joker sits there for a
text: moment, breathing heavy, wipes Randall's blood off his face--
speaker_heading: GARY (OS)
dialog: Hey, Art?
text: Joker turns, sees Gary at the front door. He points up high
text: to the chain-lock. He can't reach it.
text: Joker just shakes his head to himself and gets up to unlock
dialog: the door.
text: He walks past Gary who's still trembling almost too afraid to
text: look up at him. Joker leans over him and undoes the chain,
text: opens the door. Gary bolts, running down the hallway as fast
dialog: as he can--
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 91 INT. MOM'S BEDROOM, APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON 91
dialog: (Over the following, we don't see Joker's face. We don't
text: reveal his finished "look" just yet.)
text: CLOSE PICKING UP HIS NOTEBOOK, fanning through the pages--
text: Pausing at the BLACK &amp; WHITE RIPPED PHOTO OF BRUCE WAYNE for
text: a moment. Continues, stopping at the same entry from the
dialog: opening scene--
dialog: CLOSE ON WORDS, "I just hope my death make more sense than my
dialog: life."
scene_heading: 92 INT. LIVING ROOM, MOM'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON 92
text: CLOSE ON TAKING RANDALL'S WALLET OUT OF HIS BLOOD SOAKED

dialog: 94.
scene_heading: 93 INT. KITCHEN, MOM'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON 93

dialog: envelope--
text: TURNING ENVELOPE OVER, WRITING "SOPHIE" on the front.
scene_heading: 94 INT. LIVING ROOM WINDOW, MOM'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON 94
text: CLOSE ON THE ORANGE CAT AT THE WINDOW, and maybe if we're
text: looking close enough we notice something strange... the cat
dialog: has no reflection.
text: ANGLE OVER JOKER'S SHOULDER OPENING THE WINDOW, shooing the
text: cat out onto the fire escape, out into the dying day--
speaker_heading: JOKER (OS)
dialog: Go on. Go. You're free.
text: CLOSE ON THE CAT LOOKING BACK AT JOKER FOR A LONG MOMENT,
text: before scampering off out into the world, leaving him behind
dialog: for good.
text: As he closes the window we almost catch Joker's reflection in
dialog: the glass--
scene_heading: 95 INT. HALLWAY, APARTMENT BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON 95
text: FOLLOWING BEHIND JOKER, walking down the hallway as if in
text: slow motion, heading for Sophie's apartment. His dyed green
text: hair now slicked back.
text: He's wearing the ill-fitting rust colored suit he wore to his
dialog: mother's funeral.
text: STILL FROM BEHIND, he lays the envelope in front of Sophie's
text: door, then pulls something else out of his pocket -- his body
text: obscuring what it is -- puts it down by her door and leaves.
text: As he walks away down the hallway, we see what else Joker
dialog: left behind--
text: HIS WAND OF FLOWERS, at Sophie's door.
dialog: Hold.
dialog: 95.
scene_heading: 96 INT. ELEVATOR, HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON 96
text: FROM BEHIND JOKER STEPPING ONTO THE ELEVATOR, TURNING TO FACE
text: US AS THE DOOR STARTS TO CLOSE, FINALLY REVEALING HIS LOOK--
text: Green hair slicked back like one of the Wall Street assholes
text: he killed... White grease paint smeared over his face... red
text: nose painted on... dark blue peaks over and under his eyes...
text: his mother's red lipstick crudely outlining his broken
text: smile... Under the harsh flickering fluorescent lights, he
text: looks like an insane version of his mask.
text: The door closes on his new face. Ding.
scene_heading: 97 EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON 97
text: Joker steps out of his building into the setting sun, just as
text: Garrity and Burke are getting out of their unmarked Ford LTD
dialog: Crown Vic--
scene_heading: DET. GARRITY
dialog: Hey Arthur, where you going?
scene_heading: DET. BURKE
dialog: Yeah, thought you were coming down
dialog: to the station this morning.
dialog: And Joker takes off running--
text: Garrity gives chase on foot as Burke hurries back into the
dialog: car--
scene_heading: 98 EXT. 174TH STREET, TWO LANES - CONTINUOUS 98
text: Joker darts out from his block into the avenue, sprints
text: across the busy, two-lane street without looking--
text: Running right in front of an oncoming YELLOW CAB on the far
dialog: side of the street--
speaker_heading: BAM!
text: The cab hits him and Joker goes crashing into the windshield.
text: Bounces up and over the car. Landing hard on the pavement--
text: The car directly behind the cab skids to a stop just before
text: running over Joker's face. Swerving into the other lane and
text: CRASHING INTO an oncoming truck.
text: Cars on both sides of the street skidding trying to stop--
text: Crashing. It's chaos.
dialog: 96.
text: Joker pops back up from getting hit. He's in pain. But not
dialog: dead.
text: Garrity has drawn his service revolver as he makes his way
text: through the pile up. And Burke, now blocked because of the
text: crash has jumped out of his car--
text: Joker takes off running, limping down the street toward an
dialog: entrance for the elevated train--
scene_heading: 99 EXT. ELEVATED TRAIN STATION, STEPS - CONTINUOUS 99
text: Joker hustling up the stairs, dripping sweat, his white
text: grease-paint running down his face. He gets to the top of the
text: stairs, looks back and catches a glimpse of Garrity and Burke
dialog: at the bottom--
scene_heading: 100 EXT. PLATFORM, ELEVATED TRAIN STATION - CONTINUOUS 100
text: Joker makes his way down the crowded platform, the passengers
text: starting to file on a waiting Lexington Ave/Pelham Express
text: Train heading downtown. The train's packed with protesters
text: heading to the rally at City Hall. Many carrying signs...
text: most of them in "Joker" masks... a few painted up to look
text: like the "Joker" mask. Joker fits in with all of them.
text: He looks through the crowd of clowns and sees the two cops
text: getting to the top of the stairs, looking up and down the
text: platform for him. Pulling out their badges on chains from
text: around their necks. Identifying themselves as cops.
text: Joker's willing the doors to close. But they don't.
text: The two detectives run onto the train just as the doors are
dialog: finally closing--
scene_heading: 101 INT. LEXINGTON AVE/PELHAM EXPRESS (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS 101
text: Joker moves through the loud train pushing through the rowdy
text: protesters-- Into the next car, all of them packed.
text: AS THE TRAIN GOES UNDERGROUND, the lights flicker on and off--
text: car GOING BLACK FOR A FEW SECONDS as the train turns and dips
text: and speeds down the tracks.
text: Joker glances back at Burke and Garrity pulling out their
dialog: badges on chains around their necks. Smith &amp; Wesson service
text: revolvers by their sides. Shouting at the crowd, identifying
dialog: themselves as cops.
dialog: 97.
text: Joker hears some on the train shouting back in anger at the
text: police, keeps moving... past clown-faced protestors carrying
text: signs, "RESIST"... "AM I A CLOWN?"... "SAVE A CITY, KILL A
dialog: YUPPIE"...
text: The two cops push through the car, scanning all the "clown"
text: faces... So many look like Joker. They just shove protesters
text: out of the way, shouting at them all the while. A few more
text: voices rising up in protest--
text: Joker feels Burke and Garrity behind him getting closer. In
text: the flickering light sees a DRUNK GUY (20's) wearing a
text: 'Joker' mask and pulls it right off his face--
text: The drunk guy turns ready to fight.
text: He throws a punch at Joker, and Joker steps out of the way--
text: The guy pummels someone else--
text: A FIGHT BREAKS OUT, spilling down the car.
text: Joker slips the clown mask over his clown face--
text: AND JUST STANDS THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CHAOS, at home
text: with the chaos all around him--
text: Garrity and Burke spot Joker's rust colored suit in the
text: middle of the unruly mob--
text: Burke pulls his gun--
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: (shouting)
text: EVERYBODY DOWN, GOTHAM PD!
text: The crowd doesn't drop to the ground. They just keep fighting
dialog: with each other--
text: Burke sees Joker just standing there. Keeps yelling for the
dialog: crowd to get down, get down, but they don't listen to him--
text: He starts shoving protestors down, out of the way-- and
text: AND THEN THE MOB TURNS ON HIM AND GARRITY, starts closing in
dialog: around them--
text: Garrity and Burke are pointing their guns at the crowd,
text: yelling panicked for them to back off, back off, and one
text: idiot reaches for Garrity's gun--
dialog: Bang.
dialog: 98.
text: Burke fires into the crowd, as the train pulls into the
dialog: station--
text: A protestor falls dead. The other clowns on the train go
text: crazy, starting to riot. Glimpse Joker walking away calmly
text: out of the chaos. Taking off the mask and dropping it at his
text: side as he steps off the train, disappearing onto the crowded
dialog: platform.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 102 EXT. WGCTV STUDIOS, FRANKLIN THEATER - MIDTOWN - EVENING 102

scene_heading: 104 INT. STUDIO 4B, STAGE - FRANKLIN THEATER - EVENING 104
text: Studio audience filing into the studio, being seated in the

text: The set for "LIVE WITH MURRAY FRANKLIN!" is dark... but we
text: can still make out his desk... guest chairs... Don Ellis and
text: his Jazz Orchestra's band stand... big blue curtain.
scene_heading: 105 INT. HALLWAY, FRANKLIN THEATER - EVENING 105
text: The host of the show, MURRAY FRANKLIN (60's), usually quick
text: with a bemused grin but right now in a sour mood, walks fast
text: down the hall toward the drab dressing rooms with his old-
text: school producer, GENE UFLAND (60's), who's holding the show's
text: rundown rolled up in his hand.
speaker_heading: GENE UFLAND
dialog: --You gotta see this nut for
dialog: yourself, Murray. I don't think we
text: can put him on. With the rioting
dialog: out there.
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: Jesus, Gene, I don't have time for
dialog: this. Cindy's been breaking my
dialog: balls all day.
speaker_heading: GENE UFLAND
dialog: She's still mad at you about that
dialog: thing?
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: Three marriages, you'd think I'da
dialog: fuckin' learned something.
dialog: (then)
dialog: What do I gotta see? I already know
dialog: he's a nut. That's why we're
dialog: putting him on, it's a goof.
text: A young BLONDE INTERN walks by in the opposite direction. She
text: nervously smiles to them and keeps walking. Both men turn and
text: check out her ass. Murray winks at Gene.
speaker_heading: GENE UFLAND
text: (just shakes his head, and
dialog: smiles)
dialog: I'm telling you, you gotta see him,
dialog: Murray. I think it's too risky, the
dialog: show's too big. It's worth too much
dialog: to blow it on this,-- this freak.
scene_heading: 106 INT. DRESSING ROOM, FRANKLIN THEATER - CONTINUOUS 106
text: Joker's sitting on a small couch in the cramped dressing
text: room, watching the local news on a TV that's mounted up on
text: the wall, live shots from the subway station where Burke shot
text: the protestor, footage of the City Hall rally, clashes with
dialog: police.
dialog: He's cleaned himself up as best he could... white grease-
text: paint smeared more evenly over his face, green dyed hair
text: slicked back in place. Red lips redone.
text: Murray and his producer Gene open the dressing room door
dialog: without knocking--
text: Joker gets up off the couch and goes to shake Murray's hand.
text: Murray pauses when he sees Joker's face.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (shakes Murray's hand;
dialog: effusive)
dialog: Murray, I can't believe this is
dialog: real, that I'm really here.
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: GENE UFLAND
dialog: It's Mr. Franklin kid, show some
dialog: respect.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: Oh shut up, Gene.
dialog: (to Joker)
dialog: Murray is fine. I prefer it in
dialog: fact. Thanks for coming on the
dialog: show.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Are you kidding? Thank you for the
dialog: opportunity. I've been watching you
dialog: forever. My mother never missed a
dialog: show.
text: Murray nods not listening, he's heard this before.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: So what's with the face? Are you
dialog: part of the protests?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: No, I don't believe in any of that.
dialog: I don't believe in anything. I just
dialog: thought it would be good for my
dialog: act.
speaker_heading: GENE UFLAND
dialog: (upset)
dialog: Your act? Didn't you hear that a
dialog: kid got killed on the subway and
text: two cops who were almost beat to
dialog: death? You didn't hear about the
text: dozens of protestors and police
dialog: injured in the riots?
text: Joker looks like he's about to bust out laughing. All of that
text: news is playing out on the TV above their heads. He takes a
text: deep breath. Swallows the laugh.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: No. I hadn't heard.
text: Gene and Murray share a look.
speaker_heading: GENE UFLAND
dialog: --the audience is gonna go crazy if
dialog: you put him on. It was okay maybe
dialog: for a bit, but not a whole segment.
dialog: 101.
text: Murray thinks about it for a beat.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: I like it. It's timely. It's edgy.
dialog: It's, it's dangerous. The best
dialog: comedy is all those things put
dialog: together.
dialog: (done)
dialog: We're gonna go with it.
text: Gene rubs his temples, he doesn't like this, but Murray is
dialog: the boss.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Thank you Murray.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
text: (flashes his bemused
dialog: smile; condescending)
dialog: Couple rules though,-- No cussing,
dialog: no off-color material, we do a
dialog: clean show, okay? You'll be on
dialog: after Dr. Sally. Someone will come
dialog: and get you. Good?
text: Joker nods good. Smiles back at Murray.
text: Murray and Gene turn to go, exchanging smirks with each other
text: as they walk out, making light of Joker who we see behind
text: them still standing there.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Hey Murray,-- one small thing? When
dialog: you bring me out, can you introduce
dialog: me as "The Joker"?
text: Murray and Gene look back at him
speaker_heading: GENE UFLAND
dialog: What? You don't want to use your
dialog: real name?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Honestly, I don't even know what my
dialog: real name is.
text: Joker smiles, the guys can't tell if he's kidding or not.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Besides, that's what you called me
text: on the show, Murray. A joker.
dialog: Remember?
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (to Gene; trying not to
dialog: crack up)
dialog: Did I?
speaker_heading: GENE UFLAND
dialog: I have no idea.

dialog: (turns back to Joker)
dialog: Well, if you say so, kid. Joker it
dialog: is.
text: Murray starts to laugh at Joker as he closes the dressing
text: room door, shutting it right in his face.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 107 INT. BACKSTAGE, BEHIND CURTAIN - STUDIO 4B - NIGHT 107
text: JOKER'S BACKSTAGE AT THE EDGE OF THE BLUE CURTAIN, trying to
text: watch the show through a slim gap. Behind him there's a
text: monitor on a cart playing the live feed.
text: He moves the curtain aside to get a better look-- Glimpses
text: Murray laughing, finishing up talking to noted sex therapist
scene_heading: DR. SALLY FRIEDMAN (60's).
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (to Dr. Sally)
dialog: You gotta see our next guest for
dialog: yourself. Will you stick around?
dialog: Maybe you can help, I'm pretty sure
dialog: he could use a doctor.
text: The audience laughs.
scene_heading: DR. SALLY FRIEDMAN
dialog: Oh. Does he have sexual problems?
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: He looks like he's got a lot of
dialog: problems.
text: Another big laugh.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (turns, looks into camera)
dialog: It's been a crazy few days here in
dialog: Gotham, and, I think maybe things
dialog: are about to get crazy around here
dialog: too. Don't go anywhere folks. We'll
dialog: be right back.
dialog: 103.
text: APPLAUSE SIGN LIGHTS UP. Everyone claps. Joker keeps watching
text: Murray through the slim gap at the end of the curtain. Hears
text: the floor director shout, "And we're out. Back in three."
text: Joker adjusts the waist of his pants under his jacket. Takes
text: a deep breath.
scene_heading: 108 INT. DIRECTOR'S BOOTH, STUDIO 4B - NIGHT 108
text: Perched one story above the studio. There's a long console
text: where the DIRECTOR sits in front of a gooseneck microphone,
text: looking over a double-bank of monitors.
text: Sitting next to him are the ASSOCIATE PRODUCER who times the
text: show, and the TECHNICAL DIRECTOR who operates the board. The
text: monitor showing the live feed is playing a commercial.
speaker_heading: ASSOCIATE PRODUCER
text: Back in 30 seconds.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Okay, cue the clip. We'll come to
text: it straight out of break.
speaker_heading: ASSOCIATE PRODUCER
dialog: Five... Four... Three...
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
text: Roll clip. Put up the show graphic.
text: ON THE SHOW MONITOR, video of Joker's original stand-up
text: performance comes up with the show's graphic in the lower
text: right of the screen.
scene_heading: 109 INT. TALK SHOW SET, STAGE - STUDIO 4B - CONTINUOUS 109
text: ON THE SET, Murray watches the clip on the monitor above his
text: desk, can't help but laugh. Sees the FLOOR DIRECTOR counting
text: him down silently with her fingers... Three... Two... points
dialog: to Camera One.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (looking into camera)
dialog: O-kay, you may have seen that clip
dialog: of our next guest when we first
dialog: played it two weeks ago. Now before
dialog: he comes out, I just want to say
dialog: that we're all heartbroken here and
dialog: sensitive to what's going on in the
dialog: city tonight. But, this is how he
dialog: wanted to come on the show. So let
dialog: me introduce-- The Joker.
dialog: 104.
text: BEHIND THE BLUE CURTAIN, Joker gathers himself, ready for his
text: moment. Doesn't hear his introduction or see a STAGEHAND pull
dialog: open the curtain for him to go out--
text: ON SET, THE CURTAIN'S OPEN, Don Ellis and his Jazz Orchestra
text: are playing Joker on. He doesn't come out. Murray looks over
text: to the empty space in the curtain.
text: The audience laughs.
text: BEHIND THE CURTAIN, Joker sees the stagehand motioning for
text: him to go out on stage. Joker starts out, pausing when he
text: takes a step into the bright lights. The stagehand doesn't
text: see him stop, and drops the curtain back on Joker before the
dialog: audience can really see his face--
text: Tangling Joker up in the curtain.
text: The audience keeps laughing thinking it's part of his act.
text: The band keeps playing him on. Joker untangles himself from
text: the curtain and the audience gets a good look at him.
text: Some continue laughing. A few boo. Most don't know what to
dialog: make of him.
text: Joker walks across the stage, forgetting to wave like he
text: practiced. He trips over the riser surrounding the set when
text: he goes to shake Murray's hand. Almost falls on him.
text: Murray tries not to crack up. The audience laughs. Thinks
dialog: it's part of Joker's act.
text: Joker reaches out to hug Dr. Sally as she goes in for a
text: handshake. Another awkward moment. More laughs.
text: Joker finally sits down next to Murray. Crosses and uncrosses
text: his legs. Can't get comfortable.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: So, ahhh, thanks for coming on the
dialog: show. But I gotta tell ya, with
dialog: what happened at City Hall today,
dialog: I'm sure many of our viewers here
dialog: in the studio, and at home, might
dialog: find this look of yours in poor
dialog: taste.
text: Joker's not listening to Murray. He's mesmerized by all the
text: lights shining on him... all the eyes on him... he doesn't
dialog: answer Murray.
text: Nervous laughter from the audience.
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (tries again)
dialog: Can you tell us why you're dressed
dialog: like this?
text: AND JOKER STARTS TO LAUGH. Not embarrassed of it anymore. He
text: goes with it. Giving in to it, enjoying the laughter.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (can't help but smile at
dialog: Joker's laughing)
dialog: Okay. But I'm not sure how any of
dialog: this is funny. A lot of those
dialog: protesters are going with this
text: look. City seems to be full of
dialog: clowns these days.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (just nods, still
dialog: laughing)
dialog: Yeah. Isn't it great?
text: Joker just keeps cracking up. Audience still isn't sure what
text: to make of him. There's some awkward laughter.
scene_heading: 110 INT. DIRECTOR'S BOOTH, STUDIO 4B - CONTINUOUS 110
text: Nobody's laughing in the booth.
speaker_heading: TECHNICAL DIRECTOR
dialog: (looks to the director)
dialog: This guy's got nothing.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: (hits the producer's talk
dialog: button; into the mic)
dialog: Gene, what the hell? You wanna kill
dialog: this?
scene_heading: 111 INT. TALK SHOW SET, STAGE - CONTINUOUS 111
text: Murray glances over at his producer Gene Ufland, who's
text: sitting off-camera on a director's chair by a monitor. Gene
text: shrugs at him.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (smiles; trying to save
dialog: the interview)
dialog: So when we talked earlier, you
dialog: mentioned that you aren't
dialog: political. That this look isn't a
dialog: political statement.
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (between laughs)
dialog: That's right. I'm not political,
dialog: Murray. I'm, I'm, I'm just trying
dialog: to make people laugh.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (beat; smiles)
dialog: How's that goin' for ya? Have you
dialog: been working on any new material?
dialog: Do you want to tell us a joke?
text: The audience claps, egging Joker on to tell a joke.
text: Joker looks over at Murray -- his laughing fit finally
text: subsiding -- and reaches into his jacket pocket and--
text: Pulls out his worn notebook, catching his breath. Looks
text: through it to find a new joke.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: You brought a joke book?
text: The audience laughs. Joker smiles, opens the page to Bruce
text: Wayne's photo, pauses for a moment then turns the page. Finds
dialog: a joke--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (reading)
dialog: Okay. Here's one. Knock knock.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: Oh god, a knock-knock joke? And you
dialog: need to read it?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (nods, reads it again)
dialog: I want to get it right. Knock
dialog: knock.
text: Murray makes a face like, "Okay, I'll go along with this."
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: Who's there?
speaker_heading: JOKER
text: (looks up from his
dialog: notebook)
dialog: It's the police, ma'am. Your son
text: has been hit by a drunk driver.
text: He's dead.
dialog: Beat.
dialog: 107.
scene_heading: 112 INT. DIRECTOR'S BOOTH, STUDIO 4B - CONTINUOUS 112
text: The associate producer tries not to laugh, but she can't help
text: it. The director looks over at her like she's lost her mind.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: Okay, ready Camera Two. Take Two.
dialog: Ready Three. Three.
text: ON THE MONITORS, some of the audience cracks up. Joker smiles
text: at the response. Murray Franklin shakes his head, smirking at
dialog: the joke despite himself.
scene_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON MONITORS)
dialog: So, Arthur, you told me backstage
dialog: that your--
text: Joker leans over interrupting Murray, whispers something to
dialog: him.
scene_heading: 113 INT. TALK SHOW SET, STAGE - STUDIO 4B - CONTINUOUS 113
text: Murray nods as Joker whispers.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (bemused smile;
dialog: patronizing)
dialog: Right. Sorry. I mean Joker-- you
dialog: told me backstage that your
dialog: mother's a big fan of the show,
dialog: that she never misses it.
text: Joker puts the notebook back in his pocket. Crosses his legs,
text: starting to get a bit more comfortable.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: That's right, Murray. But she's
dialog: dead now.
text: The audience laughs.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (goes along with the
dialog: "joke")
dialog: Hold on. Your mother's dead?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Yeah. She is.
text: Murray's not sure if this is part of his act.
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: Okay. What about your father? Does
dialog: he watch the show?
text: Laughter from the crowd.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I don't know who my father is,
dialog: Murray. Turns out I was adopted and
dialog: sexually assaulted by my mother's
dialog: boyfriend.
text: A few in the audience groan. A couple even laugh. Still think
text: it's just Joker's edgy, off-kilter sense of humor.
text: Don Ellis plays "wha-wha-wha-whuuuuh" on his trumpet from the
dialog: band stand.
scene_heading: DR. SALLY FRIEDMAN
dialog: Ahhhh! No, no,-- You can not joke
dialog: about that.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (shakes his head;
dialog: irritated)
dialog: Yeah, that's not funny, that's not
dialog: the kind of humor we do on this
dialog: show.
text: Murray glances over at Gene in the wings. He gives him the
dialog: "wrap it up" sign.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (just keeps going, on a
dialog: roll)
dialog: Sorry. It's been a rough few
dialog: months, Murray. I mean, after my
dialog: mother died, the police came to
dialog: question me at her funeral. Who
dialog: does that?
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (too easy)
dialog: Oh really? Were you a suspect?
text: The audience laughs.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Very funny, Murray. No, they came
dialog: because I killed those three Wall
dialog: Street guys.
dialog: Beat.
dialog: 109.
text: Studio audience can't tell if he's joking or not. Murray
dialog: can't either.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (looks at him confused)
dialog: Okay. I'm waiting for the
dialog: punchline.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: There is no punchline. It's not a
dialog: joke.
scene_heading: 114 INT. DIRECTOR'S BOOTH, STUDIO 4B - CONTINUOUS 114
text: The director stares at the monitor.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Did he just confess to killing the
dialog: Wall Street Three?
speaker_heading: TECHNICAL DIRECTOR
dialog: (horrified)
dialog: Yeah. I think he did.
speaker_heading: ASSOCIATE PRODUCER
dialog: (turns to the director,
dialog: nods)
dialog: He definitely did.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Jesus Christ.
dialog: (hits the camera talk
dialog: button, into mic)
text: Camera Three, get in close.
text: ANGLE ON MONITOR, Camera Three zooming in close on Joker's
dialog: face.
scene_heading: 115 INT. TALK SHOW SET, STAGE - CONTINUOUS 115
text: Gene Ufland is now standing up from his chair. Motions for
text: Murray to kill the interview. Murray shakes his head to
dialog: himself. This is a big "get," it could be great television.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (turns back to Joker; with
dialog: gravitas)
dialog: You're serious, aren't you? You're
dialog: telling us you killed those three
dialog: boys on the subway. Why should we
dialog: believe you?
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I got nothing left to lose, Murray.
dialog: Nothing can hurt me anymore. This
dialog: is my fate, it was always my fate.
dialog: My life is nothing but a comedy.
scene_heading: 116 INT. SOPHIE'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 116
text: Sophie's sitting on her couch watching this interview play
text: out on TV. GiGi's asleep next to her. The open envelope and
text: the money are lying on the coffee table. No sign of the
dialog: flowers anywhere.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON TV)
dialog: Let me get this straight, you think
dialog: killing those young men is funny?
speaker_heading: JOKER (ON TV)
dialog: Yeah. But comedy is subjective,
dialog: isn't that what they say? Besides,
dialog: the way I see it, what happened was
dialog: a good thing. All of you, Gotham,
dialog: the system that knows so much, you
dialog: decide, you decide what's right and
dialog: wrong. What's real or what's made
dialog: up. The same way you decide what's
dialog: funny or not.
text: Sophie edges forward on the couch, can almost see a hint of
text: agreement on her face.
scene_heading: 117 INT. TALK SHOW SET, STAGE - STUDIO 4B - CONTINUOUS 117
text: Back on set, we can tell by the way Murray's now interviewing
text: Joker, talking to him slower, more thoughtfully, that he
dialog: thinks this is gonna get him an Emmy... Maybe even a Peabody.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Okay, I think I understand. You did
dialog: it to start a movement, to become a
dialog: symbol.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: C'mon, Murray, do I look like the
dialog: kind of clown who could start a
dialog: movement? I killed those guys
dialog: because they were awful.
dialog: Everybody's awful these days. It's
dialog: enough to make anyone crazy.
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: So that's it, you're crazy. That's
dialog: your defense for killing three
dialog: young men? Because they were mean
dialog: to you?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: No. They couldn't carry a tune to
dialog: save their lives.
text: Some audible groans from the audience.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Why is everyone so upset about
dialog: these guys? Because Thomas Wayne
dialog: went and cried about them on TV?
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: You have a problem with Thomas
dialog: Wayne, too?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Yeah. I do. Everything comes so
dialog: easy for him.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: And what's wrong with that?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Have you seen what it's like out
dialog: there, Murray? Do you ever actually
dialog: leave the studio? Everybody just
text: yells and screams at each other.
dialog: Nobody's civil anymore. Nobody
dialog: thinks what it's like to be the
dialog: other guy. You think men like
dialog: Thomas Wayne, men at ease, ever
dialog: think what it's like to be a guy
dialog: like me? To be anybody but
dialog: themselves.
text: (shaking his head, voice
dialog: rising)
dialog: They don't. They think we'll all
dialog: just sit there and take it like
dialog: good little boys. That we won't
dialog: werewolf and go wild. Well, this is
dialog: for all of you out there.
text: Joker "howls at the moon." It's fucking weird.
dialog: 112.
scene_heading: 118 INT. STATION SQUAD ROOM - 7TH PRECINCT - CONTINUOUS 118
text: OFFICERS AND DETECTIVES JUMPING INTO ACTION, rushing past a
text: small portable black &amp; white television sitting on one of the
text: desks, hear one of them shout--
speaker_heading: POLICE LIEUTENANT (OS)
dialog: That asshole just confessed to
dialog: killing those Wall Street guys on
dialog: fucking live TV!
text: ANGLE ON THE LITTLE TV, TIGHT TWO-SHOT OF JOKER looking at
dialog: Murray.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON TV)
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: So much self-pity, Arthur. You
dialog: sound like you're making excuses
dialog: for killing three young men. Not
dialog: everybody's awful.
scene_heading: 119 INT. TALK SHOW SET, STAGE - STUDIO 4B - CONTINUOUS 119
text: Back on set. Joker looks straight at Murray.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: You're awful, Murray.
text: There is no more laughter. The audience is watching this
text: exchange with full attention.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: Me? How am I awful?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Playing my video, inviting me on
dialog: the show,-- You just wanted to make
dialog: fun of me. Well it's easy to laugh
text: at Frankenstein on a crowded beach,
dialog: isn't it? You're just like the rest
dialog: of them, Murray. Everything comes
dialog: too easy for you.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (on the spot; defensive)
dialog: You don't know the first thing
dialog: about me, pal. Look what happened
dialog: because of what you did, Arthur,
dialog: what it led to. There are riots out
text: there. Two policemen are in
dialog: critical condition, someone was
dialog: killed today.
dialog: 113.
text: Joker nods in agreement, yeah, it's because of what he did.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: How about another joke, Murray?
dialog: What do you get when you cross a
text: mentally-ill loner with a system
text: that abandons him and treats him
dialog: like trash?
text: Murray pauses for a minute, not really listening to Joker,
text: suddenly realizing the seriousness of the situation. He
text: starts to turn to camera--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (pulls Randall's gun)
dialog: I'll tell you what you get. You get
dialog: what you fucking deserve,--
text: And as Murray Franklin turns back to him, JOKER SHOOTS THE
scene_heading: SIDE OF MURRAY'S HEAD OFF--
text: Blood splatters all over the back of the set. Some spraying
text: in Joker's face. AUDIENCE SCREAMS! Dr. Sally dives for the
dialog: floor.
scene_heading: 120 INT. SOPHIE'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 120
text: Sophie screams and jumps to her feet horrified! Waking up
text: GiGi who starts to cry when she sees what's on television--
text: ON THE TELEVISION, Joker gets up and walks right up to the
text: camera. Blood sprayed over his white painted face. Hear the
text: studio audience still screaming, bedlam all around him.
speaker_heading: JOKER (ON TV)
dialog: (looks straight into
text: camera; screams Murray's
dialog: signature sign off)
scene_heading: GOOD NIGHT AND ALWAYS REMEMBER,--
speaker_heading: THAT'S LIFE!
text: And as Joker waves goodbye to the home audience, a black &amp;
text: white "INDIAN-HEAD TEST PATTERN" cuts off the show--
scene_heading: "PLEASE STAND BY"
text: HERB ALPERT'S "Spanish Flea" plays underneath.
dialog: Beat.
dialog: 114.
scene_heading: 121 INT. TALK SHOW SET, STAGE - CONTINUOUS 121
text: BACK LIVE IN THE STUDIO, JOKER'S TACKLED BY TWO SECURITY
text: GUARDS AND SOME STAGEHANDS, still hear screams of terror from
text: the audience around him.
text: HIS FACE HITS THE SHINY FLOOR AS IF IN SLOW MOTION--
text: And we HEAR the soft and familiar opening to FERRANTE &amp;
text: TEICHER's piano version of "Send in the Clowns".
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 122 INT. GOTHAM SQUAD CAR (MOVING), GOTHAM STREETS - NIGHT 122
text: JOKER GAZING OUT THE WINDOW, at all the violence and madness
text: in the city. We only see it in the reflection of the glass...
text: the fires burning... the mob crowding the streets. Joker's
text: handcuffed in the back of the squad car moving slowly through
text: the rioting, sirens wailing, red lights flashing, blood still
text: splattered on his face.
text: STAY ON JOKER'S FACE AS HE HEARS THE POLICE RADIO CRACKLING,
text: reports of rioters in "Joker" masks setting fires, breaking
text: windows, looting stores.
text: The images reflected in the window start to speed up as the
text: officer driving weaves faster through the chaos.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER #1 (OS)
dialog: Look what you caused, you freak,
dialog: the whole city's on fire because of
dialog: you.
text: AND JOKER BANGS HIS HEAD HARD AGAINST THE STEEL MESH CAGE--
speaker_heading: BAM.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER #2 (OS)
dialog: Keep it up, asshole. Watch what
dialog: happens when we get to the station.
text: HE BANGS HIS HEAD AGAIN. BAM. BAM. Some blood is forming on
dialog: his forehead--
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER #1 (OS)
dialog: (glancing at Joker in the
dialog: back seat, shouting)
dialog: -- Calm the fuck down, you're not
dialog: going anywhere!
text: And when the cop driving turns back, catch a glimpse of
text: someone or something running out into the street in front of
dialog: the speeding squad car--
dialog: 115.
text: CLOSE ON JOKER AS THE SQUAD CAR SWERVES OUT OF THE WAY, Joker
text: banging up against the door--
text: CRAAAASSSHHHHHH!!!!
text: The squad car hits a parked car hard and flips over, sliding
text: across the street on its roof--
scene_heading: 123 EXT. SQUAD CAR (SLIDING), STREET - CONTINUOUS 123
text: SPARKS FLY UNTIL FINALLY THE UPSIDE DOWN SQUAD CAR COMES TO A
text: STOP. Smoke rising from the wreck. Ferrante &amp; Teicher's piano
text: only version of "Send in the Clowns" still playing...
text: Both police officers in the front seat are either unconscious
text: or dead. We see movement in the back seat, hard to tell
dialog: what's going on inside.
text: Suddenly the back door kicks open--
text: And Joker falls out of the car, landing hard on the street,
text: one hand free, handcuffs dangling from his other hand. Hear
text: sirens in the distance--
text: JOKER LEANS BACK AGAINST THE CAR, his face bloody, his body
text: broken from the crash. Sitting there amongst the wreckage,
text: can still see and hear the chaos, the fires burning all
text: around him. He reaches for a jagged shard of broken glass--
text: And pauses for moment catching his breath, hand holding the
text: jagged glass resting on his lap, wailing sirens getting
text: closer, looks like he's about to cut his wrists--
scene_heading: 124 EXT. MOVIE THEATER, STREET - UPTOWN - CONTINUOUS 124
text: A WELL-HEELED CROWD LETTING OUT OF A MOVIE THEATER, the
dialog: violence has even reached up here, the nice part of town...
text: Sirens wailing, gangs of punks wearing "Joker" masks running
text: past, breaking car windows, fires burning... Catch a glimpse
text: of the lit up marquee listing the films playing, "Blow Out"
text: and "Zorro the Gay Blade". Hear "Send in the Clowns" still
dialog: playing...
text: FROM BEHIND SEE A SILHOUETTED COUPLE AND THEIR KID hurry down
text: the dark side of the street, ducking into an alley to avoid
dialog: the chaos--
text: Catch a glimpse of a punk in a "Joker" mask following after
dialog: them pulling a gun--
dialog: 116.
scene_heading: 125 EXT. SQUAD CAR (UPSIDE DOWN), STREET - CONTINUOUS 125
text: Joker lifts the jagged shard of glass, handcuff swinging...
text: Passes by his wrist... And starts cutting into the slit on
text: one corner of his mouth, making his smile longer and wider.
text: Blood pouring down his face, onto his hand...
text: Joker tearing into the other side of his mouth, jagged glass
text: ripping into his flesh, spurting blood, handcuff swinging--
text: Sirens on top of him, red lights flashing over his face--
text: ANGLE ON JOKER LIT UP RED, done cutting his smile, letting go
text: of the jagged bloody shard... Leans his head back against the
text: squad car, and closes his eyes, covered in his own blood.
text: He's finished.
dialog: Now he is the Joker.
scene_heading: 126 EXT. ALLEY, MOVIE THEATER - CONTINUOUS 126
text: FROM BEHIND, FAMILY IN THE SHADOWS sees the guy's eyes go
text: wide behind the mask, pointing his gun, music swelling--
speaker_heading: PUNK
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: You still think we're all fucking
dialog: clowns?
text: And the punk shoots the man. Reaches out and grabs something
text: off the woman's neck before he shoots her as well. Both fall
text: to the ground dead. Revealing their young son standing behind
dialog: them--
text: CLOSE ON EIGHT-YEAR-OLD BRUCE WAYNE, closing his eyes as
text: blood sprays across his face. He opens his eyes and looks up
text: scared at the man in the "Joker" mask who killed his parents,

text: CUT TO BLACK.
text: A long beat.
text: HEAR LAUGHTER.
text: The sound of a man totally cracking up.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: 127 INT. ARKHAM STATE HOSPITAL, INTERVIEW ROOM - MORNING 127
text: CLOSE ON JOKER, tears in his eyes from laughing so hard. He's
text: enjoying it, not trying to get it under control.
dialog: 117.
text: His head's been shaved. He looks medicated or maybe even
text: lobotomized. Wearing white institutional clothes.
text: HIS NEW SMILE IS ALL STITCHED UP, cut deep up the corners of
text: his mouth. Forming a longer, "happier" smile.
text: He's sitting across from an overworked HOSPITAL DOCTOR
dialog: (50's), African American woman. Somehow it's the exact same
text: room Joker imagined his mother was in some 30 years ago. The
text: room and the doctor also look vaguely similar to the social
text: worker and her office in the opening scene.
text: The doctor just sits there, waiting for him to stop laughing.
text: A weathered notebook is on the table in front of him.
text: Finally, Joker stops himself.
speaker_heading: HOSPITAL DOCTOR
dialog: What's so funny?
text: He takes a deep breath, his eyes are glazed over. His voice
text: is scratchy, like he doesn't use it much.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: -- just thinking of this joke.
speaker_heading: HOSPITAL DOCTOR
dialog: Do you want to tell it to me?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: HOSPITAL DOCTOR
dialog: Because you don't think I'll get
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Because it's personal, it's between
dialog: me and him.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: HOSPITAL DOCTOR
dialog: Okay. Is the medication working?
dialog: How's your sleeping?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (nods yes)
dialog: ...
speaker_heading: HOSPITAL DOCTOR
dialog: How are you feeling?
dialog: 118.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Good. Everything's good now.
speaker_heading: HOSPITAL DOCTOR
dialog: Have you been writing in your

text: Joker slowly nods.
speaker_heading: HOSPITAL DOCTOR
dialog: Great. I want to make sure you're

speaker_heading: JOKER

dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: HOSPITAL DOCTOR
dialog: Have you written about your
