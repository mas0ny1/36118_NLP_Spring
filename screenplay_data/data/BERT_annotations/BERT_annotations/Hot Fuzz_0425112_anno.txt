text: at the door of his hotel. ANGEL strides inside.
scene_heading: INT. SANDFORD FRONT OFFICE - MORNING
text: ANGEL strides into the station, now in full uniform. The
text: same DESK SERGEANT is there as before. Although he is now
text: sour faced and has curly hair. ANGEL is a tad confused.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Morning Sergeant. Have you done
dialog: something with your hair?
speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Well, could you tell Inspector
dialog: Butterman that I’ve arrived?
speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT
text: He’s not in yet.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I see. How’s our guest?
speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT
dialog: Guest?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: The inebriate in cell four
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT
dialog: I dunno. Nobody tells me nothing.
text: ANGEL walks over to Cell Four and looks through the
text: observation hatch. Panic spreads across his face.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Can I get cell four open?
speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT (0.S.)
dialog: Danny, can you open four?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Quickly please?
speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT (0.S.)
dialog: Quickly...please!
text: An OFFICER opens the cell. ANGEL walks in to find it empty.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
text: He’s gone.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Oh my god? Who’s gone?
text: We see that the OFFICER is the ROTUND DRINKER.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Why are you dressed as a police
dialog: officer?
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Because I am one?
text: A jovial man enters the cell in senior officer’s garb.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Sergeant Angel, at last. I see
dialog: you’ve already met my boy.
scene_heading: INT. FRANK’S OFFICE - DAY
text: FRANK’s office is adorned with CERTIFICATES, including
text: "VILLAGE OF THE YEAR’ plagues, along with a POLICE a glass
text: case and two mounted ANTIQUE PISTOLS.
text: We also see a photo of a younger FRANK and DANNY dressed as
text: cowboys and a middle aged woman dressed as a sguaw.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Do forgive me. I’m something of a
dialog: wild west nut. Speaking of which,
dialog: that was a fair few outlaws you
dialog: rounded up last night.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Thank you sir.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I admire your enthusiasm Nicholas
dialog: and far be it from me to
dialog: sti[U+FBO2]e your [U+FBO2]air, but
dialog: this isn’t London.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: With respect sir, geographical
dialog: location shouldn’t factor in the
dialog: application of the law.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: But coming in all guns blaring can
dialog: sometimes exacerbate matters, you
dialog: know make things worse?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I’m aware of the meaning of
dialog: exacerbate, sir.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Of course you are. Statistically,
dialog: Sandford is the safest village in
dialog: the country but that doesn’t mean
dialog: it reguires anything less than a
text: careful and considered approach.
dialog: There’s a reason we accommodate a
text: few of the younglings at the pub.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: The greater good?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: The greater good. Precisely! Your
dialog: predecessor assumed rural policing
dialog: was easy. Ended up having a nervous
dialog: breakdown. And Sgt. Popwell was an
dialog: exceptional officer, truly
dialog: exceptional. And he had one thing
dialog: you haven’t got.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: What’s that sir?
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: A great big bushy beard! Come on.
dialog: Let’s have a mosey around.
scene_heading: INT. STATION - DAY
text: FRANK shows ANGEL the locker room. DANNY lags behind.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Locker room.
text: FRANK opens a door on a musty collection of riot gear.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT’D)
dialog: Riot room.
text: A HEDGEHOG is startled by the rare intrusion. FRANK
text: approaches another door with a security keypad.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT’D) (cont’d)
dialog: And this here’s the evidence room.
dialog: What’s the code again?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: 999, Dad.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You’d think I’d remember that.
text: FRANK opens the evidence locker. It’s surprisingly empty.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT’ D}
dialog: Now, how about a trip to the Andes?
text: FRANK leads them to a door marked ‘C.I.D’. Inside are two
text: thirty something plain clothes officers with cropped hair,
text: and tashes. On their small desk are two plates of cake.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Detective Sergeant Wainwright and
text: Detective Constable Cartwright.
text: CARTWRIGHT and WAINWRIGHT stare back at ANGEL with disdain.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT’D)
dialog: Don’t get up.
text: They leave and continue down the corridor.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I suspect you’re wondering why we
dialog: call them the Andes.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Because they’re both called Andrew?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: They said you were good.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It’s also because talking te them
dialog: is a uphill struggle, innit Dad?
text: A wastepaper basket sails out of the Andes office and hits
text: Eanny on the head.
speaker_heading: DANNY (cont’d)
dialog: Oh fuck eff?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Thank you Danny.
text: A battered tin reads ‘’SWEARBOX’. DANNY dreps a quid in.
speaker_heading: FRANK (0.S.)
text: The swearbox. All proceeds to the
text: restoration of the church roof.
text: FRANK shows ANGEL into the operations room, where uniformed
text: officers bunch together at oramped desks.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: And this is where it all happens-
text: We hear a solitary Apple start-up chime.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont’d)
dialog: That’s Sergeant Tony Fisher, that’s
dialog: PC Bob Walker and that is Saxon.
text: FISHER (40’s) reedy, fixed grin. WALKER (50’s) bald,
text: grizzled with a large Alsatian. All three are eating cake.
speaker_heading: WALKER
dialog: Pleshnrertoaveyeenbordsarg.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: And this is one Doris Thatcher.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: She’s our only police woman.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: She’s not a police woman.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: She is. I’ve seen her bra.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: She’s a police officer, being a
dialog: woman has nothing to do with it.
speaker_heading: DORIS TRATCHER
dialog: Oh, I don’t knew. It comes in handy
dialog: every so often.
text: The rosy faced officer winks lewdly at a blushing ANGEL.
speaker_heading: DORIS TRATCHER (cont’d)
dialog: I ceuld’ve given you the tour. I’ve
dialog: been round the station a few times.
text: The office erupts into bawdy cheers. ANGEL is keen to move
text: on. He points to a door marked 'N.W.A’.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: What’s upstairs?
text: A little besuited man opens the door. On the table of his
text: tiny, folder crammed office is a plate of chocolate cake.
speaker_heading: WEAVER
dialog: Well, well, well, I see we have
dialog: Visitors.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Nicholas, this is Tom Weaver"
speaker_heading: WEAVER
dialog: Civilian liaison for the
dialog: Neighbourhood Watch at your
dialog: service.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Good to meet you.
speaker_heading: WEAVER
dialog: You’11 find we run a tight ship
dialog: here. Got everyone linked up with a
dialog: walkie so we can keep eaoh other
dialog: abreast of any misadventure. And
dialog: from here
text: WEAVER opens a connecting door to a room full of monitors.
speaker_heading: WEAVER (cont’d)
dialog: I can see what the whole village is
dialog: up to. I must say I was rather
dialog: admiring your handiwork last night.
dialog: 26.
text: Chuckling WEAVER cues up CCTV footage of ANGEL’s run-ins. We
text: also see footage of HOODIES huddled around the fountain.
speaker_heading: WEAVER (cont’d)
dialog: Shame you couldn’t have done the
dialog: same with those bloody hoodies.
text: Hanging around. Loitering. Sitting.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I did notice some minor graffiti on
dialog: the fountain.
speaker_heading: WEAVER
dialog: Graffiti? I knew they were up to
dialog: something! They need to be dealt
dialog: with Frank?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: They’re nippers Tom. They’11 come
dialog: round.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Yes, this kind of transgression
dialog: usually stems from boredom. Ever
dialog: thought about building them a skate
dialog: park? Or providing a designated
dialog: wall for a graf [U+FB02]ti mural?
text: WEAVER looks at ANGEL and lets out a huge guffaw.
speaker_heading: WEAVER
dialog: Ha? That’s all we need on the team,
dialog: another bloody joker. Which reminds
dialog: me, our friend the living statue’s
dialog: back. He was there Saturday.
text: WEAVER [U+FB02]icks through CCTV printouts of a street
text: performer dressed as a STATUE. They are all identical.
speaker_heading: WEAVER (cont’d)
dialog: Look 11am, 12pm, lunchtime, 2pm. If
dialog: we don’t come down hard on these
dialog: clowns, we’1l be up to our balls in
text: jugglers.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Perish the thought.
speaker_heading: WEAVER
dialog: I tried to move him on myself but
dialog: it cost me twenty quid in fifty
dialog: pees and took four hours.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We’1l get right onto it, Tom.
text: They leave. FRANK scrunches up the printouts into a hall,
text: and throws it to DANNY, who heads it into the bin.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont’d)
dialog: We like to let them think they run
dialog: the place. Now, confession to make,
dialog: bit of a problem with your office.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Well sir, I like to think my office
dialog: is out on the street-
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Oh, you heard about that?
text: He nods to office furniture sat out front of the station.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont’d)
dialog: Had a bit of a leak last week.
text: FRANK opens a door to reveal a damp, bare tiny office.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont’d)
dialog: I know it’s not a great start on
dialog: the welcome front. They brought the
dialog: "Village Of The Year’ forward for
dialog: some reason and everyone’s gone a
dialog: bit mad getting ready for it. we’ll
dialog: get you behind your desk as soon as
dialog: the [U+FB02]oor’s dry.
text: FRANK shuts the door. They move back to the main
dialog: of [U+FB02]oe.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont’d)
dialog: And that’s that. Unless there’s
dialog: anything you’re unclear about?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: There is sir. Why is everyone
dialog: eating chocolate cake?
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: The Black Forest Gateaux is on
dialog: Danny. As punishment for his little
dialog: indiscretion.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I Wouldn’t call driving under the
dialog: influence a ‘little indiscretion’,
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: ANGEL (cont’d)
dialog: sir. Besides, where’s the
dialog: disciplinary value if Constable
dialog: Butterman gets to partake of the
dialog: Gateaux as well? He’s having his
text: cake and eating it. Literally.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (chuckles)
dialog: The gateau is for misplaoing his
dialog: helmet the other week. Last night’s
dialog: incident will require something
dialog: much more serious.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Do you like ice cream?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I’m sorry, I don’t follow sir.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Let’s just say we won’t be short of
dialog: Chunky Monkey for the next month.
text: The officers cheer. ANGEL visibly sags.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont’d)
dialog: Well, since it’s your hrst day and
dialog: it’s half past eleven, I’d say
dialog: that’s lunch.
text: Another cheer from the assembled officers.
scene_heading: INT. THE CROWN - DAY
text: ANGEL is sat at a pub table with the other offieers (only

speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Sooooo, what made you choose
dialog: Sandford Sergeant Angel?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: It wasn’t actually my choice.
dialog: There’s a

speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Wasn’t your choice to come down

dialog: Our jobs.
speaker_heading: WALKER

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I can assure you it wasn’t my

speaker_heading: CARTWRIGHT
dialog: Yeah, cos we all sell apples down
dialog: here, don’t we?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Your Dad sells apples Andy.
speaker_heading: CARTWRIGHT
dialog: And raspberries.
speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT
dialog: I bet you can’t wait to jump into

text: WAINWRIGHT swigs Guinness, the head collects on his lip.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I’m not jumping in anyone’s grave.
dialog: You have a moustache.
speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: CARTWRIGHT
dialog: Why’ve you got your stab vest on?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: It’s a requirement.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: In the city maybe. No-one’s going
dialog: to stab you in here sergeant, not a
dialog: member of the public anyhow.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Have you ever been stabbed Sergeant
dialog: Fisher?
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I have. And I can assure you it’s
dialog: not the slightest bit amusing.
text: DANNY’s ears prick up, he looks to ANGEL with awe.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Have you seen a lot of action
dialog: Sergeant Angel?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I’ve experienced my fair share,

speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: What little bird would that be?
speaker_heading: CARTWRIGHT

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Did you shoot anybody?
speaker_heading: CARTWRIGHT
dialog: Shot someone? He killed someone.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: No way, that’s amazing.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: It was not amazing, it was
dialog: extremely regrettable, but the
dialog: situation left me with no choice.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Who did you shoot?
speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT
text: He shot a crack-head with a

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Wow. Where d’you get that?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: The offender had the Kalashnikov.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Wow. Where’d he get that?
speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT
dialog: You do know there are more guns in

speaker_heading: CARTWRIGHT
dialog: Everyone and their mum’s packing

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Really, like who?
text: CARTNRIGHT nods to a tall, ruddy, farmer at the bar.
speaker_heading: CARTWRIGHT
dialog: Farmers.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Anyone else?
speaker_heading: CARTWRIGHT
text: Farmer’s mums.
text: DANNY pulls his chair closer to the bemused ANGEL.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What’s it like being stabbed?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: It was the single most painful

speaker_heading: DANNY

dialog: painful?
scene_heading: INT. ANGEL’S OFFICE - DAY

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Actually sir-
scene_heading: INT. FRANK’S OFFICE - SECONDS LATER
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: -there is something I want to talk

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Oh yes?
speaker_heading: ANGEL

speaker_heading: FRANK

scene_heading: INT. STATION " SOME MORE SECONDS LATER.
text: ANGEL steps out of Frank’s office. He gets the attention of

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Excuse me everyone. If you could

dialog: order to maximise my integration
dialog: here at Sandford, I’ve asked the
dialog: Inspector to permit me a more grass
dialog: roots introduction.
speaker_heading: DORIS THATCHER
dialog: Root. Ha ha.
dialog: There’s a

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I’m hoping that getting out on the

dialog: Thank you.
text: vague affirmative murmur from the other officers.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Basically, I’d just like to be

speaker_heading: ANGEL

speaker_heading: SIMON SKINNER
dialog: Oh we’re already firm friends.
text: SIMON SKINNER beams at ANGEL, who is a little unnerved. A

text: "WELCOME SERGEANT’.
speaker_heading: WEAVER
dialog: And this is Leslie Tiller, our
dialog: local [U+FB02]oral wiz. Her

speaker_heading: JOYCE COOPER

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I haven’t held a firearm for over
dialog: two years Mr. Reaper and I’m more
dialog: than happy to keep it that way.
speaker_heading: REAPER
dialog: You will be popular with the local
dialog: birds.
text: A ripple of polite laughter as the group gather round and
text: sit at a large circular table. SKINNER stares at ANGEL
text: grinning.
dialog: 37.
scene_heading: REV. SHOOTER
dialog: Hello Nicholas. Reverend Shooter.
dialog: May I say how pleased we are to
dialog: have an Angel at our table.
dialog: (more laughter)
dialog: Actually I was hoping you might
text: read a homily at Sunday Service.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: To be honest Reverend, that might
dialog: be a little hypocritical of me.
scene_heading: REV. SHOOTER
dialog: Oh, are we an atheist?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: No, I’m open to the concept of
dialog: religion, I’m just not entirely
dialog: convinced.
scene_heading: REV. SHOOTER
dialog: You’re agnostic?
speaker_heading: DR. HATCHER
dialog: I think I have a cream for that.
text: More laughter. WEAVER nods to a tweedy, bearded doctor.
speaker_heading: WEAVER
dialog: And this is Robin Hatcher our
dialog: resident sawbones.
speaker_heading: DR. HATCHER
dialog: Hopefully we won’t see too much of
dialog: each other over the coming months.
text: DR. HATCHER smiles at ANGEL. More laughter.
speaker_heading: WEAVER
dialog: All that remains to say is, welcome
dialog: to the weekly meeting of the

speaker_heading: READER
dialog: We’re basically a group of
dialog: volunteers who strive to keep the
dialog: village just so.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: We’re the community that cares.
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Well, it’s good to know we have the
dialog: support of the community.
speaker_heading: HATCHER
dialog: Well, not the whole community.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: We don’t let any old riff raff in.
text: A huge laugh. JOYCE COOPER brings the meeting to order.
speaker_heading: JOYCE COOPER
dialog: Now, quick announcement before we
dialog: begin. Janet Barker has just given
dialog: birth to twins. Congratulations to
dialog: her, we’ll be keeping a keen eye on
dialog: them as they grow up. Tom?
speaker_heading: WEAVER
dialog: Thanks Joyce. To business then.
text: WEAVER affects a deadly earnest tone of voice.
speaker_heading: WEAVER (cont’d)
dialog: I’m sure many of you will have
text: noticed the return of a blight on
dialog: our streets, one which is all the
dialog: more disturbing as the ‘'Village Of
dialog: The Year’ contest looms. I speak of
dialog: course of the extremely irritating
dialog: Living Statue.
text: An image of the LIVING STATUE on an overhead projector.
text: There are mumbles of "irritating". ANGEL stifles a yawn.

scene_heading: INT. SWAN HOTEL ROOM - EVENING - MONTAGE

speaker_heading: RADIO 4 ANNOUNCER (0.S.)

speaker_heading: SERGEANT (V.0.)
dialog: I’m out of the office at present.
dialog: If it’s an emergency, call 9-9-9...
dialog: 39.
text: Later: ANGEL lies awake on his bed. His [U+FBO2]oral tribute
text: appears almost funereal against the wall.
speaker_heading: ANGEL (V.0.)
dialog: Police work is as much about
dialog: preventing crime as it is about
dialog: fighting crime. Most importantly it
dialog: is about procedural correctness...
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: -in the execution of unquestionable
dialog: moral authority. Any questions?
text: We see ANGEL is talking to a group of young school kids.
text: DANNY sits cross legged with them. He puts his hand up.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Is it true if you shot a man ina
dialog: particular spot on the head, you
dialog: can make it blow up?
text: Later: ANGEL and DANNY talk to headmistress AMANDA PAVER. A
text: wiry young reporter approaches with a camera.
speaker_heading: TIM MESSENGER
dialog: Hi, Tim Messenger. Quick snap for
dialog: the Sandford Citizen?
text: Later: ANGEL poses awkwardly with the schoolkids.
speaker_heading: TIM MESSENGER (cont'd)
dialog: How about if you put the teacher in
dialog: handcuffs?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I’m not sure that gives off the
dialog: right signals.
speaker_heading: TIM MESSENGER
dialog: Give the little blond kid your hat?

speaker_heading: JOYCE COOPER (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Sergeant Angel?... The swan has

dialog: the swan escaped from? And who
dialog: might you be? Mr. Staker. Mr. P. I.
dialog: Staker? Piss taker?

speaker_heading: MR. STAKER
dialog: She’s a swan.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - DUSK

scene_heading: INT. NEWSAGENT - DAY

speaker_heading: ANNETTE ROPER

speaker_heading: DANNY

scene_heading: EXT. SQUAD CAR/SANDFORD SQUARE - DAY
text: ANGEL and DANNY sit in their usual parking space. Sandford

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You want anything from the shop?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: You’ve just been to the shop.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I was thinking of a different shop.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Constable Butterman, this is not

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Well, there’s nothing going on.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: There’s always something going on.
dialog: Look around you, what do you see?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: People...cars...that gold bloke...
dialog: the swan.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Ha ha?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I’m serious. You have to look

text: ANGEL nods to an ANCIENT MAN in a heavy winter overcoat.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Mr. Treacher?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Well why is Mr. Treacher wearing

dialog: Why the extra layer? He might be

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: But that’s Mr. Treacher.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Okay, what about him?
text: ANGEL nods over to a man in a PURPLE SHELL SUIT with his cap
text: pulled down low over his face.
speaker_heading: ANGEL (cont’d)
dialog: Ask yourself why he has his hat

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: He’s fuck ugly?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Or he doesn’t want you to see his

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: ANGEL

speaker_heading: ANGEL

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: ANGEL

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: ANGEL

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: ANGEL

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: ANGEL

speaker_heading: ANGEL

scene_heading: INT. SUMMERAISLES - DAY
text: As DANNY delves in a video bargain bin full of action films,

scene_heading: INT. MANAGERS OFFICE - DAY
text: ANGEL strides into an office where SIMON SKINNER reads the
text: ‘Top Cop’ story in the SANDFORD CITIZEN. A slutty CHECKOUT
text: GIRL lounges beside him. One wall is lined with sketches of

text: A ‘fun running’ trophy sits conspicuously on the shelf.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Ah, Sergeant Angel. Or is it Angle?
speaker_heading: CHECKOUT GIRL
text: Mr. Skinner, a baby’s sicked up in

speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Please excuse me. Michael?

speaker_heading: LURCH

speaker_heading: SKINNER
text: Child vomit. Aisle six. Mop it up.
speaker_heading: LURCH
dialog: Yarp.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Is there a problem, Mr Skinner?
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: No, I just wanted to say how lovely
dialog: it is to see you supporting your
dialog: local store.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: That’s quite alright.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: All too many have defected to the
dialog: big Safeway in Buford Abbey and may
dialog: their heads be struck from their
dialog: shoulders for such disloyalty.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Yes, well if you’d excuse me, Mr.
dialog: Skinner I am on duty.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Of course, I simply spied you
text: loitering in organic produce and
dialog: assumed you had time on your hands.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Well maybe there’s someone else you
dialog: should be keeping an eye on.
text: SKINNER turns to leak at the CCTV. On one screen we see a
text: small, well dressed man climbing out of a Range Rover.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: That’s the Fridge Magnate.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: The Fridge Magnet?
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Name’s George Merchant. Made a

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Actually I wasn’t talking about

speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Oh?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I was talking about him.
text: ANGEL paints to a different screen. We see a SHOPPER rather
text: obviously stuffing biscuits into his trousers.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Ah.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Excuse me.
scene_heading: INT. SUMMERAISLES - DAY
text: ANGEL strides straight up to the shopper. It is THE MAN IN
text: THE PURPLE SHELL SUIT from the square.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Excuse me.
text: The SHOPLIFTER freezes for a moment. Then scarpers.
text: DANNY reads the cover of Jackie Chan’s SUPERCOP when ANGEL
text: explodes into life, chasing the SHOPLIFTER down the aisle.
text: He throws the video back in the bin and fellows suit.
scene_heading: EXT. SUPERMARKET/HIGH STREET - DAY
text: The SHOPLIFTER bursts onto the street with ANGEL in hot
text: pursuit. The usual friendly greetings from folk are bestowed
text: on ANGEL as he sprints by. It sounds surreal.
text: They race past shopkeepers, who report into their radios.
text: They also pass the LIVING STATUE. He doesn’t budge.
text: The SHOPLIFTER avoids being hit by REAPER’s 4x4. ANGEL
text: vaults ever the bonnet. The shoplifter runs into an alley.
text: ANGEL fellows, but comes to a stop at the alley entrance.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Oh, you mothers.
text: Several YOUNG MOTHERS with push chairs clog up the alley.
text: DANNY catches up with ANGEL. He’s very out of breath.
speaker_heading: ANGEL (cont’d)
dialog: Let’s cut through here.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Through the gardens?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: What’s the matter? You never taken
dialog: a short cut before?
text: ANGEL leaps over a garden fence, then the next one, then the
text: next. It’s an amazing acrobatic feat. DANNY gasps and
text: follows ANGEL, but trips and crashes through the fence.
text: ANGEL lands back in the alley, when suddenly he spots-
text: The SWAN. Waddling past the mouth of the alley. ANGEL is
text: torn for a split second, then resumes the SHOPLIFTER chase.
text: ANGEL runs into the HOODIES, spraying a graffiti tag reading
text: 'G’ on a wall. Upon seeing ANGEL, the HOODIES immediately
text: scatter like roaches, dropping their spray cans on the
dialog: [U+FBO2]oor.
text: ANGEL scoops up the spray can and hurls it through the air.
text: It hits the SHOPLIFTER on the head. He crashes to the
text: [U+FBO2]oor hard. ANGEL picks the SHOPLIFTER up. DANNY
dialog: approaches.
speaker_heading: ANGEL (cont’d)
dialog: You do not have to say anything,
dialog: but it may harm your defence if you
dialog: do not mention when questioned
dialog: something which you later rely on
dialog: in court. Anything you do say may
dialog: be given in evidence.
speaker_heading: SHOPLIFTER
dialog: Alright Danny.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Alright Pete.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Do you know this man?
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Yeah, he’s Auntie Jackie’s sister’s
dialog: brother’s boy.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: And it didn’t occur to you to
dialog: mention this before?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I couldn’t see his face could I?
dialog: I’m not made of eyes!
scene_heading: INT. CUSTODY SUITE - DAY

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: What do you mean he doesn’t want to

speaker_heading: SIMON SKINNER (0.S.)
dialog: I’m simply suggesting Peter be

speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Stealing biscuits is...wrong?
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: (offers Fisher a biscuit)
dialog: Correct.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Ooh thanks.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: And yet we respond by not taking a
dialog: single punitive measure?
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: That’s the way the cookie crumbles.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Heh heh. Like biscuits innit?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Mr. Skinner -
speaker_heading: FRANK (0.S.}
dialog: Everything alright?
text: ANGEL turns to see FRANK at the doorway, eating ice cream.
speaker_heading: ANGEL

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: 27. Why are we on traffic?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Dad’s probably giving us a rest
dialog: after all that jumping over fences.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I don’t need a rest.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: There’s an amazing bit in ’Point

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Is there now? 28.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Yeah, Patrick Swayze’s robbed this

speaker_heading: DANNY (cont’d)
text: Keanu lands really badly and breaks
dialog: his leg off and he’s like

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: "and then he goes to shoot Swayze,
dialog: but he can’t cause he loves him so
text: much and he fires up in the air and
dialog: he’s going ‘aaaargh’-.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Have you ever fired your gun up in

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: No, Constable I have never fired my

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: You do, do what I do. What on Earth
dialog: do you think you’re missing out on?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I don’t know. Gun fights. Car
dialog: chases. Proper action and shit
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Proper policing isn’t about
dialog: action... or shit.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Yeah but you got to fire a gun. How
dialog: come we don’t all have guns?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
text: Arming the entire British Police
dialog: Service would not necessarily lower

speaker_heading: ANGEL (cont’d)
dialog: dizzying experience. 29. If you’d
dialog: paid attention to me in school,
dialog: you’d know it’s not all about guns
text: fights and car chases.
text: A MEGANE speeds past them. DANNY and ANGEL exchange a look.
speaker_heading: ANGEL (CONT’D}
text: Fire up the roof.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Yeah?...Where is it?
text: ANGEL [U+FB02]icks the siren on. They peel out at speed. The

speaker_heading: DANNY (cont’d)
dialog: That was brilliant.
text: They walk over to the MEGANE. The smartly dressed DRIVER
text: winds down his window. ANGEL can see a NERVOUS YOUNG WOMAN
text: in the passenger seat. The DRIVER hands over his license.
speaker_heading: BLOWER
dialog: Was I going a tad fast, officer?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Yes, you were Mr. Blower.
text: ANGEL starts speedily scribbling in his notebook.
speaker_heading: BLOWER
dialog: We’re staging a homage to Baz
dialog: Luhrmann’s, William Shakespeare’s
dialog: Romeo and Juliet tonight and I’ma
dialog: little late for the dress
dialog: rehearsal. I’m playing the
dialog: eponymous hero you see. Romeo not
dialog: Juliet.
dialog: (nervous chuckle)
dialog: What are you writing?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Everything you say so I can refer
dialog: to it later.
speaker_heading: BLOWER
dialog: Now officer, I am a respected
dialog: solicitor, there’s no need to-
text: ANGEL continues to write. DANNY watches this with interest.
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: BLOWER (CONT’D}
dialog: Stop writing. I was merely trying
dialog: to explain why I might have
dialog: exceeded the speed limit -
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: You’re playing the male lead in a
dialog: production of Bar Luhrmann’s,
dialog: William Shakespeare’s Romeo and
dialog: Juliet and you’re late for the
dialog: dress rehearsal. You think this is
dialog: sufficient reason to travel at 48

speaker_heading: BLOWER
dialog: Well, I-
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: To [U+FBO2]out laws put in place to

speaker_heading: ANGEL (cont’d)
dialog: You see what I did there?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You hypnotised him.
text: ANGEL waves his pocket book in DANNY’s face.
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I used this? The most important
dialog: piece of police hardware. This has
dialog: saved my skin on many occasions.
dialog: Think about using yours more often.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I do use mine.
text: DANNY produces his pocketbook. ANGEL [U+FB02]ips through the
text: pages. We see a [U+FB02]ick-illustration of cops shooting

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: This is just extraordinary.
speaker_heading: DANNY

scene_heading: INT. LOCKER ROOM/FRONT DESK - EVENING

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: ANGEL

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: ANGEL

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Pub?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I don’t think that’s a good idea,

speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT
dialog: Oi, you two. A Mr. Blower left you
dialog: tickets for Romeo and Juliet
dialog: tonight. Said it was by way of an

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Well, we can’t accept gifts from

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Yeah.
text: ANGEL calmly rips up both tickets in front of a deflated
text: DANNY. ANGEL makes to leave again, just as FRANK enters.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Ah Nicholas. Glad I caught you.
dialog: Wondered if you wouldn’t mind
dialog: representing us at the am dram

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: And there’s a spare for Danny too.
speaker_heading: DANNY

scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER
text: ANGEL’s expression is one of abject horror, Danny is asleep.

text: over EVE DRAPERS’s Juliet, who lies in state on a prop
text: alter. He uncaps a large bottle of poison, marked with a

speaker_heading: BLOWER (ROMEO)
text: A dateless bargain to engrossing
dialog: death. Here’s to my love.
dialog: 55.
text: He drinks the poison, just as JULIET awakes with an

dialog: horror.
speaker_heading: EVE DRAPER (JULIET)
dialog: Poison? Drunk all and not one drop
dialog: to help me after? I’1l kiss thy
dialog: lips. Happly some poison doth yet
dialog: hang on them.
text: They kiss. With tongues. It goes on far too long. ROMEO goes
text: limp. JULIET picks up his gun and shoots herself with a
text: click. The stage goes to black.
text: The lights come up again to reveal the whole cast performing
text: a ‘'Knees Up Mother Brown’ version of The Cardigan’s ‘Love
dialog: Fool’.

speaker_heading: MESSENGER
dialog: Sergeant Angel, quick word for the

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: It was very...enjoyable.
speaker_heading: MESSENGER
dialog: "Cop Enjoys Watching Young Lovers?"
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I don’t think so.
speaker_heading: MESSENGER
dialog: "Local Bobby Gives Thumbs Up To

speaker_heading: ANGEL

speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: You will spell his name correctly
dialog: this time, won’t you Timothy?
text: SKINNER swoops in and leads ANGEL away from MESSENGER.
speaker_heading: SKINNER (cont’d)
dialog: Absolute tosh wasn’t it?
dialog: Annoyingly, the understudies are
dialog: actually professional actors. Greg
dialog: was an extra in Straw Dogs and
dialog: Sheree portrayed a cadaver in Prime
dialog: Suspect -
text: SKINNER nods to an OLDER COURLE who wave back at him. A

speaker_heading: BLOWER
dialog: Sergeant Angel, you came? I am so
dialog: thrilled you accepted my

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Our Inspector requested we attend.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Yes, we can’t accept gifts from

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Well, congratulations anyway to you

speaker_heading: BLOWER
dialog: Oh, this isn’t my wife.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Yes, where is Edna, Martin?
speaker_heading: BLOWER
dialog: She’s at home with the dogs. This
dialog: is Miss Draper, my leading lady.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Isn’t she just? Eve works for the

dialog: in the know.
text: EVE DRAPER snorts an alarmingly high pitched laugh.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Oh I am not.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Nonsense. I’m sure if we bashed
dialog: your head in, all sorts of secrets
text: would come tumbling out.
text: EVE lets out another snort. GEORGE MERCHANT approaches.
speaker_heading: MERCHANT
text: Romeo, Romeo, a pint of bitter for
dialog: Romeo?
speaker_heading: BLOWER
dialog: Yes please George and thank you for
dialog: coming!
speaker_heading: MERCHANT
dialog: A pleasure my liege.

text: the other room, sipping Coke and staring at him.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Eve’s nice ain’t she?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
text: She has a... distinctive laugh.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: She was in my year at school.
dialog: Always had a thing for her.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Well, she obviously has a thing for
dialog: older men.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What with Blower?! No way!
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: We just sat through three hours of
dialog: so-called acting tonight Constable,
dialog: their kiss was the only convincing
dialog: moment in it.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Now you mention it, I too have
dialog: reason to believe she favours the

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Really? How so?
speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: DANNY

dialog: (pause)
dialog: You know that’s the bloke we done
dialog: for speeding earlier.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I know and hopefully that’s the

speaker_heading: FISHER (cont’d)
dialog: Must have hit the sign at some

speaker_heading: DORIS THATCHER
dialog: I’ve had my top off in this layby.
text: FISHER points to where BLOWER’sS MEGANE has come to a violent
text: stop. The top half of the car has been shaved off.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Most likely lost control, left the
dialog: road here and ended up there...
dialog: Soooo, what do you think we should
dialog: do? Sergeant Angel?
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: We should cordon off the area,
dialog: screen the remains from public view
dialog: and close off the road until the
dialog: ambulance arrives, whereupon we
dialog: should open a single lane of
dialog: traffic to ease congestion.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Very good. What he said.
text: FLASHCUTS; a cordon unfurled, tents erected, cones set out.

speaker_heading: REAPER
dialog: What’s happened Danny?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Car accident.
speaker_heading: REAPER

scene_heading: ANGEL WAINWRIGHT

speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Martin and Eve. Such a tragedy.
text: SKINNER goes to pull off. ANGEL stands in front of his ear.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Mr Skinner, could you tell me how
dialog: you knew the identity of the
dialog: persons involved?
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Of course. When I didn’t get my
dialog: Citizen delivered this morning, I
dialog: rang Annette Roper to enquire after
dialog: young Brian. You know how it is,
text: news travels fast.
text: SKINNER pulls away fast. ANGEL watches his MG go and makes a

text: PAVER pulls up on her bicycle and talks to DANNY.
speaker_heading: AMANDA PAVER
dialog: What’s happened, Danny?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: A traffic collision...Why can’t we

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Because ‘accident’ implies there’s

text: The ANDES sit in their office eating ice-cream. DANNY enters
text: with another bowl, which ANGEL declines.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I’m just saying, things aren’t
dialog: always simple as they look.
speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT
dialog: But most times they are. Let’s wait
text: until Er. Hatchet comes back with
dialog: something, before you go jumping
dialog: the Kalashnikov.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Well, in the meantime, why not
dialog: start by checking out some of
dialog: Martin Blower’s clients?
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT
dialog: Martin Blower represents damn near
dialog: most of the village. You want us to
dialog: go through the whole phone book?
speaker_heading: CARTWRIGHT
dialog: Yeah, we’1l put a call into Aaron
dialog: A. Aarronson shall we?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Please don’t be childish. At least
dialog: think about interviewing the widow?
dialog: Mr Blower was clearly having
text: an affair with Eve Draper.
speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT
dialog: And how did you establish that?
text: DANNY slams his [U+FB02]st on the table. ANGEL jumps.
speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: CARTWRIGHT
dialog: Yeah, what else you got, Tango and

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Simon Skinner.
speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT
dialog: What about him?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: He was acting suspiciously at the
dialog: collision scene.
speaker_heading: CARTWRIGHT
text: He runs the local supermarket.
speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT
dialog: Anything else?
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
text: Skid marks.
speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT
dialog: Now who’s being childish?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: There were no skid marks at the
dialog: scene. Don’t you think it’s a
dialog: little strange that Mr. Blower
dialog: would lose control of the car and
dialog: not think to apply his brakes?
dialog: For the [U+FBO2]rst time, the ANDES do not have an answer.
speaker_heading: ANGEL (cont’d)
dialog: If there are no skid marks it
dialog: follows that for three hundred
text: yards the driver and the passenger

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I can’t remember a time when I

dialog: apart from the summer of 1979 when
dialog: I wanted to be Kermit The Frog. It
dialog: all started with my Uncle Derek. He

speaker_heading: ANGEL (cont’d)

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Sounds like a good bloke.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Actually, he was jailed for selling
dialog: drugs to students.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What a cunt.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: He most likely bought the pedal car
dialog: with the proceeds. Needless to say
dialog: I never went near it again. I let
dialog: it rust. But I never forgot that
dialog: clear sense of right and wrong I
text: felt at the wheel of that pedal car
dialog: and I refused to accept that
dialog: corruption was the inevitable
dialog: consequence of authority. I had to
dialog: prove to myself that the law could
dialog: be proper and righteous and for the
dialog: good of humankind. I knew then, I
dialog: was destined to be a police
dialog: officer.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Shame.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: How so?
speaker_heading: DANNY

dialog: I dunno. I like a little midnight
dialog: gobble.
text: THATCHER and WALKER laugh at this. WALKER mumbles ‘Cocks’.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: So what do we reckon? Angel?
text: FISHER looks to a spectacularly groggy ANGEL and DANNY.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Help me.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: We should set up a proper cordon,
dialog: keep people back, let the fire crew
dialog: finish and get the forensics to do
text: a thorough sweep.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Right. What he said.
text: ANGEL spots a crew of workmen on the periphery, waiting to
text: clear the scene. TIM MESSENGER appears, notebook in hand.
speaker_heading: MESSENGER
dialog: Sergeant, a guick word?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Mr. Messenger, please. A statement
dialog: will be issued shortly.
speaker_heading: MSSENGER
dialog: Actually I just wanted to find out,
dialog: ‘what’s your perfect Sunday’?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I’11 deal with the press Sergeant.
dialog: Now, my perfect Sunday would begin
text: FISHER leads MESSENGER away. ANGEL sees SIMON SKINNER
text: amongst a crowd of onlookers. SKINNER waves ‘hello’.
speaker_heading: WAINWEIGHT
dialog: What you thinking? Foul play?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT
dialog: We’re just waiting to speak to the
dialog: last people to see Mr Merchant
dialog: alive, namely Sergeant Knickerless
dialog: Asswipe and Constable Fanny
dialog: Butterdog.
speaker_heading: The ANDES
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: That’s us.
text: collapse with into sniggers.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Why is this such a big joke to you?
dialog: Three people have died in less than
dialog: a week.
speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT
dialog: Oh come on Dr. Sherlock, they were
dialog: accidents.
speaker_heading: CARTWRIGHT
dialog: People have accidents everyday.
speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT
dialog: Ron Spencer got his cravat caught
dialog: in the mulcher the other week.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: But the victims knew each other.
speaker_heading: CARTWRIGHT
dialog: Everyone knows everyone round ‘ere.
speaker_heading: WAINWEIGHT
dialog: Yeah. If you didn’t see anything
dialog: suspicious, then who did?
scene_heading: INT. STATIQN/CCTV OFFICE - DAY
text: TOM WEAVER spools through footage on his CCTV monitors.
text: ANGEL, DANNY, FRANK and the ANDES look on.
speaker_heading: WEAVER
dialog: Bit of a blind spot I’m afraid.
dialog: We’re not that well covered around
dialog: George Merchant’s. We only get the
text: very edge of the explosion.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Nasty way to go.
speaker_heading: WEAVER
dialog: One thing that did catch my eye.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: What’s that?
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: WEAVER
dialog: You sticking it to these herberts!
text: WEAVER shows a replay of the drunken HOODIE fight and whoops
text: with delight. The ANDES snigger. ANGEL fumes.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: This is irrelevant.
speaker_heading: WEAVER
dialog: I beg to differ. It’s the closest
dialog: we’ve come to nabbing the bastards.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Mr. Weaver, let’s concentrate-
text: WEAVER pauses the tape on a blurred shot of the BLONDE KID.
speaker_heading: WEAVER
dialog: Did you get a good look at this
dialog: little mischief? What did he-
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Forget that, just keep looking for
dialog: anything out of the ordinary in the
dialog: immediate area of Mr Merchant’s
dialog: residence. Make a note of any car
dialog: registrations spotted in the
dialog: vicinity. In partieular, look out
dialog: for a Red MG, license ’SS1’.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Nicholas.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Yes sir?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Can I have a mo?
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You’ve got to ease off on these
dialog: Skinner allegations. He’s the
dialog: manager of the local supermarket.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: With respect sir-
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Listen, you are an exceptional
dialog: officer, truly exceptional, but you
dialog: do have to let the Andes do their
dialog: job. If there’s anything amiss,
dialog: we’1l hear soon enough. Until then
dialog: we have to regard these incidents
dialog: as accidents.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Yes sir.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Good boy.
text: FRANK leaves. ANGEL looks up to the photo on the wall. It is
text: of an officer with a big bushy beard; ‘Sgt, Popwell’.
speaker_heading: WEAVER (0.S.)
dialog: Sergeant Angel, I think I’ve found
dialog: what you’re looking for.
text: ANGEL runs excitedly over to WEAVER’s office. The ANDES
text: follow suit, as do DANNY and FRANK. They see CCTV footage of
text: the SWAN waddling past Merchant’s house.
speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT
dialog: Ah, there you go. It was the Swan
dialog: all along.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: This is not funny Detective!
speaker_heading: CARTWRIGHT
dialog: Oh give over Miss Marples.
speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT
dialog: Let us do our job and you do yours.
speaker_heading: CARTWRIGHT
dialog: Yeah, haven’t you got a church fete
dialog: to look after?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: No, I have not!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Actually.
dialog: 83.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH FETE - DAY
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Lovely day for it Sergeant?
text: A bored ANGEL patrols at a bustling fete. We see impressive
text: [U+FBO2]oral displays and banners reading ’SAVE THE CHURCH
text: RGQE’ and promoting Sandford for ’VILLAGE OF THE YEAR’. REV.
text: SHOQTER sidles up to ANGEL with a tray of drinks.
scene_heading: REV. SHOOTER
dialog: Sergeant Angel, would your
dialog: theological reservations preclude
dialog: you from assisting me with the
dialog: raf [U+FB02]e this afternoon? There’s
text: a glass of Joyce Cooper’s lemonade
dialog: in it for you.
text: ANGEL takes a glass and downs it, to SHOOTER’S delight.
speaker_heading: REV. SHOOTER (CONT’D)
dialog: Marvellous.
text: ANGEL slumps into a nearby chair and surveys the fete. He
text: sees a child messily eating a ice lolly. He looks up to see
text: the father, SGT. FISHER doing the same.
text: He sees DORIS THATCHER standing with two burly men, giggling
text: at a pig being spit roasted. He sees WALKER feed candy
dialog: [U+FBO2]oss to SAXON.
text: BONG. A bell rings as LURCH plays a ’TEST YOUR STRENGTH’
text: game. SKINNER lurks nearby, manning a ’BASH THE RAT’ stall
text: and staring into the distance. Thunder rumbles.
text: ANGEL follows his gaze over to TIM MESSENGER having an
text: animated discussion with LESLIE TILLER, the [U+FBO2]orist...
speaker_heading: CARTWRIGHT (0.S.)
dialog: Shark?
text: ANGEL jumps. The ANDES appear, clutching cans of Cider.
speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT
dialog: Seen any murderings Nicholarse?
text: FRANK and DANNY approach dressed in wild west gear.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Come on now boys. Leave Sergeant
text: Angel alone, he’s working.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT
dialog: Sorry Chief, won’t waste anymore
dialog: police time.
text: The ANDES slope off, swigging their cider.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Actually Nicholas. You may as well
dialog: have a break.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Great. I’ve got something to show
dialog: you.
text: ANGEL follows DANNY through the crowd until they come to a
text: stop at an AIR RIFLE RANGE, run by a smiling DR. HATCHER.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: This is a ri[U+FBO2]e range.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You’1l be really good at it.
speaker_heading: HATCHER
dialog: Three cans wins you a squeaky
dialog: bunny, five gets you a [U+FB02]oppy
dialog: lion. Take out all the little
dialog: people, you get to waltz off with
dialog: the cuddly monkey.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I thought I made it clear to you
dialog: how I felt about guns.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It’s only an air rilU+FBO2]e.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: No Danny.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It is for a cuddly monkey.
text: ANGEL grudgingly takes an air rifle. DANNY smiles
text: expectantly. ANGEL fires, hitting every can dead centre with
text: amazing speed. He lowers the rifle, feeling excited and
text: unclean at once. The ANDES watch, swigging their cider.
speaker_heading: DR. HATCHER
dialog: Good lord.
text: ANGEL hands the rilU+FB02]e to an awed DANNY, who inspects
dialog: it.
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Fuck me...that was-
text: DANNY accidentally pulls the trigger. We hear an agonized
text: yelp. DR. HATCHER drops on the [U+FB02]oor clutching his leg.
scene_heading: EXT. FETE - DAY
text: ANGEL and DANNY walk away from the stall: ANGEL clutching
text: the CUDDLY MONKEY, DANNY in shock. Behind a Saint John’s
text: Ambulance team attend to DR. HATCHER, who’s in some pain.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I can’t believe I shot someone.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: He’s a doctor, he can deal with it.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: But I’ve never shot anyone before.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Believe me Constable. It’s not
dialog: something you ever get used to.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Yeah. Maybe we should go on the
dialog: bouncy castle. Take our minds off
dialog: it.
text: ANGEL spies SKINNER talking heatedly with TIM MSSENGER.
speaker_heading: DANNY (cont’d)
dialog: What is it?
text: Thunder rumbles. Before ANGEL can answer, a YOUNG BOY runs
text: right into him. We see that it is the BLONDE SCHOOL KID. He
text: and ANGEL lock eyes. The boy looks terrified.
speaker_heading: WEAVER
dialog: Watch where you’re going.
text: ANGEL turns to see the grandfather.
speaker_heading: WEAVER (cont’d)
dialog: I do apologise for my grandson.
dialog: Stand up straight Gabriel, this is
dialog: Sergeant Angel.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I’ve met Gabriel before actually.
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: WEAVER
dialog: Oh, have you?
text: GABRIEL looks extremely anxious. His eyes go wide.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Yes. I gave a talk at the school,
dialog: didn’t I Gabriel?
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Maybe we’1l get a chance to have
text: another little chat sometime.
speaker_heading: WEAVER
dialog: I’m sure Gabriel would love that.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: You have a good afternoon.
text: WEAVER and GABRIEL walk off. GABRIEL looks back at ANGEL
text: his expression of confusion and relief.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What was that about?
text: Before ANGEL can answer...a breathless TIM MESSENGER
text: appears, slamming into ANGEL.
speaker_heading: MESSENGER
speaker_heading: TIM MESSENGER
dialog: Sergeant Angel, I need to talk to
dialog: you about George Merchant. Alone.
dialog: It might be less conspicuous if you
dialog: don’t bring the monkey.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: This man is a police officer, I’d
dialog: thank you to treat him with more
dialog: respect.
speaker_heading: TIM MSSENGER
dialog: I was talking about that.
text: nods to ANGEL’s giant CUDDLY MONKEY.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: TIM MESSENGER
text: The churchyard. Ten minutes.
text: ANGEL watches MESSENGER scurry off, passing SIMON SKINNER.
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Bash the rat?
speaker_heading: REV. SHOOTER (TANNOY)
dialog: Could we have Sergeant Angel to the
dialog: stage please?
text: ANGEL gives the CUDDLY MONKEY to DANNY and walks off.
scene_heading: EXT. FETE - DAY
text: A distracted ANGEL takes to a makeshift stage where the REV.
text: SHOOTER stands with a tombola and a microphone.
scene_heading: REV. SHOOTER
dialog: Here to announce the winners is the
dialog: newest addition to the Sandford
dialog: Police Force-
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: (under breath}
dialog: Police service.
scene_heading: REV. SHOOTER
dialog: -Sergeant Nicholas Angel.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Hello.
text: A buzz of feedback from the mic. ANGEL eyes the clock. It’s
text: 3pm. The tombola spins...
text: ...MESSENGER waits in the churchyard, looks at his watch.
text: ...ANGEL picks a name from the tombola.
speaker_heading: ANGEL (cont’d)
dialog: The [U+FB02]rst name is Simon
dialog: Skinner.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE ROPER
dialog: He’s in the loo!
scene_heading: REV. SHOOTER
dialog: Too much of Joyce’s lemonade
dialog: perhaps.
text: Laughter from the crowd. Thunder rumbles...
text: ...We see a BLACK GLGVED HAND on a church door handle...
text: ...The tombola spins. ANGEL looks at the clock...
text: ...We see BLACK EOOTS race up belfry steps...
dialog: 88.
text: ...MESSENGER still waits. Sweat forms on his brow...
text: ...ANGEL picks another name.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Tim Messenger.
scene_heading: REV. SHOOTER
dialog: Tim, your number’s up.
text: There’s much hub-bub. Thunder rumbles. Closer this time.
text: ANGEL looks in the crowd frantically...
text: .Unseen a CLOAKED EIGURE steps onto the church roof...
text: . ANGEL jumps down off the makeshift stage.
text: .ELACK GLOVED HANDS push on a loose turret stone.
text: . TIM MESSENGER stands directly below...
text: . ANGEL strides through the crowd...
text: ...The gloved hand presses on the turret. The stone
dialog: cracks...
text: ...ANGEL breaks into a run. He reaches the churchyard...
text: ...The stone breaks away from the roof and falls down.
text: ...ANGEL runs in the churchyard, sees TIM MSSENGER-
text: SPLAT. The tip of the stone CRUSHES MESSENGER’S head!
text: ANGEL jerks back in horror. TIM MESSENGER now looks utterly
text: surreal, with an upside down cone where his head should be.
text: The off duty police arrive on the scene, along with many of
text: the NWA. SIMON SKINNER runs over from a chemical toilet.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Keep back. There’s been a terrible
dialog: accident!
text: There’s much hub-bub and murmurs of the word ‘accident’ from
text: the crowd. FISHER steps in, not having seen the body.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: What accident?
dialog: (he sees it)
dialog: Oh right.
text: ANGEL grimaces, looks to the church roof and races off.
dialog: 89.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH STEPS/ROOF - CONTINUOUS
text: ANGEL runs up the church steps to the roof. He [U+FB02]ings
text: the door open and peers out. There’s no-one there.
text: He comes back down to find all the off duty police waiting
text: at the door, along with a troubled REV. SHOOTER.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Nicholas, what is it?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Sir, I think all these deaths are
text: linked. Tim Messenger was murdered.
scene_heading: REV. SHOOTER
dialog: Who could do something like this?
speaker_heading: WAINNRIGHT
dialog: Maybe it was the swan.
speaker_heading: CARTWRIGHT
dialog: Apparently they can break a man’s
dialog: arm.
speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT
dialog: Or blow up a man’s house.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Look-
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Whoa there Nicholas. Let me get
dialog: this straight. Are you saying this
dialog: is a crime scene?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Yes sir, I am.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Very well. Detectives, start
dialog: interviewing everyone who was at
dialog: the fete. Sgt Fisher, secure the
dialog: area, PC Thatcher, get the CSI down
dialog: here. PC Walker patrol the
dialog: churchyard with Saxon. Nicholas,
dialog: Danny...you know what to do.
dialog: 90.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCHYARD - NIGRT
speaker_heading: ANGEL and
text: DANNY sit in the rain at the crime scene. DANNY
text: still wears his cowboy outfit and clutches the MONKEY.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Do you really think this is murder?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I just don’t think we should rule
dialog: it out.
speaker_heading: DANNY
speaker_heading: PC WALKER
speaker_heading: The ANDES
dialog: Yeah. I think you’re right.
text: passes with SAXON.
speaker_heading: WALKER
dialog: Ifinkyertarkinaloodashitt.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: He thinks you’re talking a load of
dialog: shit. Swings and roundabouts innit?
text: wander past. ANGEL and DANNY get up and approach.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Did you find anything?
speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT
dialog: Yes I was extremely shocked when I
dialog: looked at my watch and discovered
dialog: the pubs were shut.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: What about his house? Have you
dialog: checked his office? Read his
dialog: articles?
speaker_heading: CARTWRIGHT
dialog: If you want to wade through every
dialog: copy of the Sandford bloody
dialog: Citizen, be our guest.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: It’s your job isn’t it? Detect!
speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT
dialog: This isn’t the city, Mister Angel.
dialog: Not everyone’s a murdering
dialog: psychopath. High time you realised
dialog: that. You and your monkey.
speaker_heading: The ANDES
speaker_heading: MONKEY.
dialog: A furious
dialog: 91.
text: walk off into the night. DANNY holds up the CUDDLY
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Did he mean me or that?
text: ANGEL puts his head in his hands.
speaker_heading: DANNY (cont’d)
dialog: Maybe we should go home.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Well, there’s nothing going on is
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Have you listened to anything I’ve
dialog: said Constable?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Has anything I’ve told you in the
dialog: last few weeks got through that
dialog: thick skull of yours?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Oh really?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You said I could be an amazing
dialog: policeman officer.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: There’s always something going on
dialog: Danny and you’11 never be an
dialog: amazing police officer until you
dialog: understand that.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I remembered something else you
dialog: said.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: And what was that?
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You don’t know how to switch off.
text: ANGEL stalks back to his stool and again guards the cordon.
text: He sits alone in the rain, soaking to the skin.
scene_heading: INT. SWAN HOTEL CORRIDOR/BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: ANGEL approaches his door. He unlocks it and enters. On the
text: bed is the sodden CUDDLY MONKEY and a card reading -
dialog: ‘This was left for you at reception. Regards Joyce’
text: ANGEL slumps into a chair, picks up the phone and dials-
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR (V.0.)
dialog: I’m out of the office at present...
text: ANGEL spies the Sandford Citizen featuring him on the cover.
text: He sees the byline ’Words and Pictures by Tim Messenger’.
text: ANGEL hangs up and [U+FB02]icks through the paper, past
text: mundane stories; ‘’Bypass Still Unannounced’, ’Sandford
dialog: Family Trees’.
text: He stops at a feature entitled ‘Sandford People’ with an
text: accompanying photo of George Merchant. A quote reads "This
dialog: is just the beginning; I have big plans for Sandford". ANGEL
text: looks inspired. He grabs his pen and notebook.
scene_heading: EXT/INT. LIERARY - MORNING
text: ANGEL sits at a table surrounded by archived volumes of the
text: Sandford Citizen. He [U+FB02]ips through the pages at speed.
text: We see FLASHCUTS of ANGEL scouring articles, photocopying
dialog: relevant pages, highlighting crucial sentences and even
text: correcting the odd typo. It’s a blizzard of information.
text: We see ANGEL highlight a sentence reading ’Mr. G. Merchant
dialog: has applied for planning permission...’ We see another
text: headline, ’George Of The Jungle: Merchant Buys Scrubland’.
text: We see a photo of MARTIN BLOWER outside the Sandford
text: Playhouse. The headline reads ’From Bar to Verse: Solicitor
dialog: Finances Drama Sociecy’.
text: The pages [U+FB02]ip faster, the words start to blur. There
dialog: has never been a more exciting scene in film history.
dialog: 93.
scene_heading: INT. STATION - MORNING
text: A glum DANNY sits at a desk. ANGEL enters. DANNY doesn’t
text: look up. ANGEL struggles with a guilty greeting.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Morning Constable.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Alright?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Thanks for the monkey.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It’s yours.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Yeah but I won it for you.
dialog: (smiles apologetically)
dialog: Danny, I think I’m on to something.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Are you?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I think with a little bit of
dialog: deliberation we can figure out what
dialog: links these deaths.
text: ANGEL slaps a thick bundle of photocopies on the table.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: We?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I can’t do this by myself Danny.
text: DANNY looks touched. The ANDES breeze past their desk.
speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT
text: Morning benders.
speaker_heading: CARTWRIGHT
dialog: What you up to?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Nothing.
text: The ANDES leave. ANGEL smiles at DANNY.
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Come on partner, lets go to work.
text: FISHER pokes his head out of his office, a note in hand.
speaker_heading: FISHER

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: ANGEL

speaker_heading: ANGEL

speaker_heading: ANGEL

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Martin Blower.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Affirmatron.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Respected solicitor and leading
dialog: light of the local drama society.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Bad actor.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
text: Undoubtedly.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Bad driver.
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Not necessarily.
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: Cheated on his missus.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Most certainly and we both know who
dialog: with?
scene_heading: EXT. SQUAD CAR - DAY

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: ANGEL

speaker_heading: ANGEL

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Council.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Specifically?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: The department of planning and
dialog: development.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Where George Merchant had secured

text: mansion on Norris Avenue.
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: So...
scene_heading: INT. STATION - EVENING
text: Back in the office, the energy [U+FBO2]ags. DANNY has his
text: head on ANGEL the table, ANGEL [U+FB02]icks endlessly through
dialog: his notes.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Tim Messenger was onto something
dialog: about George Merchant who was into
dialog: something with Martin Blower who
dialog: was up to something with Eve
dialog: Draper.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: And Simon Skinner has something to
dialog: do with it all.
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: But he runs the local supermarket.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I don’t know, I mean, maybe it was
dialog: all accidents. People have
dialog: accidents everyday. Gary Butcher
text: drowned in his own septic tank the
dialog: other week.
text: ANGEL puts his head on the table too. FRANK swings by.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What are you two up to?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Well, look sharp. There’s been
text: reports of a fire in the station.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: What?!
text: DORIS produces a cake with a single candle stuck in it. The

text: then notices cards and banners that have clearly been there
text: the whole day. All reading ‘Happy Birthday Danny’.
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: ANGEL (cont’d)
dialog: You should have said something.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: We were working weren’t we?

speaker_heading: DANNY (cont’d)

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Personal errand.
scene_heading: EXT. STATION - EVENING

dialog: No. Well, yes. I’m moving away.
dialog: It’s all a bit out of the blue. I
dialog: was planning to disappear quietly
dialog: actually. I do so hate goodbyes.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: And why the move, if you don’t mind
dialog: me asking?
speaker_heading: LESLIE TILLER
dialog: Well, just between you and I...
text: LESLIE TILLER seems a little edgy. ANGEL is intrigued.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: LESLIE TILLER
dialog: You know that fella who blew up?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: George Merchant.
speaker_heading: LESLIE TILLER
dialog: That’s him, well George Merchant -
dialog: god rest him - he wanted to buy
dialog: this land, so he sends round his
dialog: legal fella Martin Blower - god
dialog: rest him - I thought I might take
dialog: them up on it, because I’ve been
dialog: thinking about moving for some
dialog: time, I haven’t really got that
dialog: much family round here, save for
dialog: Cousin Sissy. And while the
dialog: "Village Of The Year’ stuff is
dialog: great and everything, I don’t
dialog: really see anything from it, so I
dialog: thought I might take them up on the
dialog: offer and move to Buford Abbey.
dialog: Would you like a card with this?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: No, it’s okay. You were saying
dialog: about the offer?
speaker_heading: LESLIE TILLER
dialog: Well, it turns out that Martin
dialog: Blower - god rest him - knew where
dialog: the new bypass road is going
dialog: because he was knocking off Eve
dialog: Draper from the council - god rest
dialog: her - then that reporter - god rest
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: LESLIE TILLER (cont'd)
dialog: him - finds out about the route and
dialog: tells me the land’s very valuable,
dialog: ten times what George Merchant and
dialog: Martin Blower - god rest them -
dialog: offered me. So with them having
dialog: passed on and me still owning the
dialog: land, I decided to sell it on
dialog: myself to some folks from the city
dialog: that Martin, George and Eve - god
dialog: rest the lot of them - had been
dialog: talking to, apparently they want to
dialog: build a big shopping centre or
dialog: something, of course Cousin Sissy
dialog: won’t be too happy about that, but
dialog: as far as I’m concerned -

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Would you excuse me for one second?
speaker_heading: LESLIE TILLEE
dialog: Of course.
scene_heading: EXT. FLORIST/NURSERY - NIGHT
text: ANGEL leaves the [U+FBO2]orist. He runs back to the car to
text: get his pocketbook. In the background we can see LESLIE
text: TILLER wrapping the [U+FBO2]owers - but we can also see -
text: The CLOAKED FIGURE slips in from the back room of the shop,
text: grabs the shears and plunges them into LESLIE TILLER’s
text: throat. Blood spurts all over the counter and front window.
text: ANGEL turns back to see...TILLER dead. Shears in her neck.
text: The blood. A SHADOW disappearing into the stock room...
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Stop. In the name of the law!
text: ANGEL runs towards the [U+FB02]Jorist, throwing his trunoheon
text: at the window. It shatters a second before he jumps through.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. FLORIST/NURSERY - NIGHT
text: ANGEL runs into the stock room, to see the CLOAKED FIGURE
text: running through the aisles of the stock room. He gives
dialog: chase.
text: SMASH. The CLOAKED FIGURE jumps through a greenhouse window,
text: catching their leg on the frame.
dialog: 101.
text: ANGEL is almost on top of him and jumps through the newly
text: smashed window. Landing, he looks up to see the FIGURE now a
text: good 50 metres ahead, running towards a greenhouse and
text: knocking garden furniture in its wake.
text: ANGEL sprints off again, bursting into the greenhouse and
text: gaining on the CLOAKED EIGUEE. Both knock plants asunder.
text: The CLOAKED EIGURE slices through a mesh door with a knife
text: and disappears over a hedge at the nursery perimeter.
text: ANGEL reaches the final hedge to find the CLOAKED FIGURE,
text: now 100 metres away, sprinting across a cricket pitch.
text: A breathless ANGEL stands at the hedge, confused and amazed.
scene_heading: EXT. FLORISTS/NURSERY - NIGHT
text: Back at the [U+FBO2]orist. ANGEL and FISHER stare at LESLIE
text: TILLER who lies dead, shears protruding from her neck.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Hang about, hang about. You’re

scene_heading: INT. STATION - NIGHT
speaker_heading: ANGEL

speaker_heading: CARTWRIGHT

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT

speaker_heading: ANGEL

speaker_heading: ANGEL

speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: No, actually.
speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT

speaker_heading: ANGEL

speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT (cont’d)
dialog: Thank you Andy.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Yes come on Sergeant, you’ve got to
dialog: accept that it was another terrible
dialog: accident.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Are you suggesting Leslie Tiller
text: somehow tripped and fell on her own
dialog: shears?
speaker_heading: FISHER
text: Ben Fletcher fell on his pitchfork
dialog: the other week.
speaker_heading: DORIS THATCHER
dialog: People have accidents everyday.
dialog: What makes you think it was murder?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Because I was there.
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: CARTWRIGHT
dialog: Yeah, that’s a point. Why were you
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I was buying a Japanese Peace Lily
dialog: for Constable Butterman’s birthday.
speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT
dialog: What absolute horseshit.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Look, I chased a suspect from the
text: scene. Innocent people don’t run.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: It might have been our old friend
text: the cactus thief again.
speaker_heading: DORIS THATCHER
dialog: Yeah, he was a prickly customer.
text: Everyone laughs. ANGEL crumples against the nonsense.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Am I going completely mad?
speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT
dialog: Maybe you are?
speaker_heading: CAEIWRIGHT
dialog: Ieah, maybe you killed her, seeing
dialog: as you’re such a big fan of murder.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: What !?
speaker_heading: FRANK (0.S.)
dialog: Sergeant Angel?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: YES....sir?
text: FRANK ushers ANGEL into his office and shuts the blinds.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Nicholas, Nicholas, Nicholas, what
dialog: am I going to do with you?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Chief, you’ve got to understand-
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No, you have to understand, the
dialog: boys here aren’t used to the
dialog: concepts you’re bandying about.
dialog: (off Angel’s look)
dialog: The ‘’M’ word, Nicholas. There
dialog: hasn’t been a recorded murder in
dialog: Sandford for 20 years.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: But I’m sure sir. And what’s more,
dialog: I know who did it.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I hope you’re not going to say who

scene_heading: INT. SKINNER’S GEFICE - NIGHT

text: purposefully. Various employees look through the office
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Sergeant Angel. Officers. To what
dialog: do I owe this pleasure?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I’m arresting you on suspicion of
dialog: the murder of Leslie Tiller.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Leslie Tiller is dead? How?
speaker_heading: FISHER
text: She tripped and fell on her own
dialog: shears.
text: ANGEL throws a pen at FISHER’s head. He yelps.
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I’m also arresting you on suspicion
dialog: of the murders of Tim Messenger on
dialog: May ist, George Merchant on April
dialog: 29th and Eve Draper and Martin
dialog: Blower on April 28th.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Why on earth would I want to do
dialog: that Sergeant?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I’m glad you asked.
text: The following is illustrated with oodles of FLASHCUTS. It
dialog: looks pretty damn cool, for a British film.
speaker_heading: ANGEL (cont’d)
dialog: My suspicions were [U+FBO2]rst
dialog: aroused when you appeared at the
dialog: scene of the Blower/Draper deaths,
text: on the outskirts of Sandford,
dialog: despite living and working in the
dialog: centre of the village. I couldn’t
dialog: help recall your comments at the
dialog: theatre the previous evening, when
dialog: you not only indicated your
dialog: awareness of the couple’s affair
dialog: but also inferred that Ms. Draper’s
dialog: connections at the council might
dialog: make her privy to important
dialog: information. You yourself spoke of
text: "bashing her head in". Perhaps
dialog: hoping you might discover the route
dialog: for the proposed Sandford Bypass.
dialog: You were already suspicious that
dialog: Blower’s client George Merchant was
dialog: buying up an area of land on the
text: edge of the village, after a story
dialog: Tim Messenger ran in the Citizen.
dialog: You put two and two together after
dialog: noting Merchant’s use of your car
dialog: park to visit Blower who you knew
dialog: all too well had an inside
dialog: connection at the council. The land
dialog: Merchant was buying up had no
dialog: particular value as it was but if
dialog: it were to be made accessible by a
dialog: new road, it would become an ideal
dialog: location for perhaps, a retail
text: park. Consumed with concern for
dialog: your business and potential
dialog: disloyalty from fickle customers
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: ANGEL (cont’d)
dialog: whom you yourself stated the desire
dialog: to behead, you killed the potential
dialog: competition in cold blood, staging
dialog: the murders as accidents. You used
text: a vehicle removal truck to stage
dialog: the Blower/Draper crash and
text: incinerated an old man in his
dialog: house, covering your tracks with
dialog: the judicial application of bacon
dialog: and beans. However, there was a
text: loose end. Tim Messenger foolishly
dialog: confronted you at the village fete,
dialog: after his own investigations lead
dialog: him to the same conclusions. So you
dialog: silenced him, before he could voice
dialog: his concerns to me but not before
dialog: he had told Leslie Tiller about the
dialog: true value of her land. Upon
dialog: discovering that she was about to
dialog: sell up to the developers, you
dialog: brutally murdered her with her own
dialog: shears and made your escape
dialog: utilising your impressive prize
dialog: winning skills as a fun runner.
text: ANGEL finishes his summation, by resting his hand on a ’fun
text: run’ trophy. The room is astonished. SKINNER claps slowly.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Very entertaining, Sergeant Angel.
dialog: But I rather think you’ve been
dialog: watching too many films.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: He hasn’t.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Why would I kill Leslie? You
dialog: clearly aren’t aware we’re related.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Oh but I am, ’Cousin Sissy’.
text: ANGEL slaps down a photocopied sheet of a family tree
text: article from the ’Sandford Citizen’. Highlighted are Skinner
text: and Tiller’s connected names. SKINNER scoffs.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: I’m afraid my nickname of Sissy is
dialog: only a revelation to yourself. My
dialog: teenage years studying ballet are
dialog: well known.
speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT
dialog: Yeah Sissy Skinner.
speaker_heading: CARTWEIGHT
dialog: What a gaylord!
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Thank you Andrews. Despite my
dialog: comment about beheading customers,
dialog: what we here on Planet Sandford
dialog: like to refer to as ’a joke’ I
dialog: would personally relish the
dialog: competition of another store.
dialog: Anything to energise my workforce.
text: SKINNEE gesticulates to his gormless minions
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: You would relish the competition.
dialog: Especially if it was yourself. As
dialog: Miss Tiller’s only cousin, you’re
dialog: set to inherit her land, on which
dialog: you plan to build a Summeraisles
dialog: Express. The perfect one stop shop
dialog: for bypass traffic.
text: ANGEL points to the sketch of a new store on
speaker_heading: SEINNER
dialog: These sketches are just pipe
dialog: dreams. Anyway, what makes you
dialog: think I could dislodge part of the
dialog: church roof? Or for that matter
dialog: stage a car crash?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: It’s a well known fact that the
dialog: church roof is severely in need of
dialog: repair. As for the car, isn’t it
dialog: true that two of your employees
dialog: also operate the council’s vehicle
dialog: removal truck?
dialog: 107.
dialog: outside.
dialog: the wall.
text: ANGEL points to the GRUFF LOOKING BUTCHERS. They are the
text: same GRUFF LOOKING MEN from the removal vehicle earlier.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Sergeant, this is the 21st Century,

speaker_heading: SKINNER (cont’d)
dialog: Tina here is a table dancer at
text: Flappers.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: The thing is Mr. Skinner, you could
dialog: quite easily have obtained access
dialog: to the removal vehicle and used it
dialog: for your own ends.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: These accusations are meaningless
dialog: Sergeant, unless you can back them
text: up with hard evidence.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Well you’ve certainly got me there.
dialog: We’d need something conclusive.
dialog: Like perhaps a wound you sustained
text: on a shard of broken glass this
dialog: very evening.
text: ANGEL awkwardly pulls back SKINNER’s trouser legs. Nothing.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Oh Sergeant, this is getting to be
dialog: embarrassing. Apart from anything
dialog: else, how can I be in several
dialog: places at once? I’m sure the
dialog: store’s security footage can
dialog: absolve me. Do feel free to spool
dialog: through.
scene_heading: INT. SKINNER’S OFFICE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I can handle this Danny You enjoy
dialog: the rest of your birthday.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Did you really get me that plant?

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Maybe I can still water it.

speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Sergeant, I wanted you to know that

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It’s just the one killer actually.
scene_heading: EXT. SQUARE - DAY
text: DANNY throws some change into the fountain. They get into

text: echo in ANGEL’s head; ’No luck catching them killers then?’
text: Licking his ice cream; ANGEL ponders DANNY’s response; ‘It’s
text: just the one killer actually’. The words resonate.
text: ANGEL stops eating his ice cream, his eyes go wide.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What’s the matter? You got
dialog: brainfreeze?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: No I got brainwave. Get us back to
dialog: the station. Now!

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: More than one killer.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It was Skinner a minute ago.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Maybe it still is. Maybe he’s not
dialog: alone. Maybe there are others.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Who exactly?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I don’t know but we were buying
dialog: Cornettos and it suddenly hit me-
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You’re an exceptional officer,
dialog: Nicholas. Truly exceptional. But
dialog: I’ve seen this before.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Sergeant Popwell. It was exactly
dialog: the same thing. You’ve come from a
dialog: city where there’s danger round
dialog: every corner and it’s driven you
text: round the bend.

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Yes sir.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Listen, I’m due at a function in

scene_heading: INT. SWAN HOTEL BEDROOM - DUSK
text: ANGEL hits the wall with a thud. He gets up and throws

dialog: 113.
text: LURCH. They look at each other for a second. ANGEL brings
text: his [U+FB02]sts down on either side of LURCH’s head. LURCH
text: drops ANGEL, holding his ears. ANGEL kicks LURCH in the
text: balls. He barely winces before hurling ANGEL across the room
text: into a painting of the castle. His notebook drops to the
dialog: [U+FBO2]oor.

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Danny. Stay here. Watch him. Call

speaker_heading: MASSED VOICES (0.S.}
dialog: .bonum commune communitatis...
text: ANGEL peers into the main hall. He sees several BLACK
text: CLOAKED FIGURES standing around a large circular stone
text: tablet. They hold torches under their faces.
text: ANGEL makes out familiar faces under the hoods. We see TOM
text: WEAVER, whose words echo in ANGEL’s head; "I can see what
dialog: the entire village is up to..."
text: ANGEL looks to see 12 walkie talkies on the stone tablet -
dialog: "Got everyone linked up with a walkie so we can keep each
text: other abreast of any misadventure."
text: ANGEL sees SKINNER under one of the hoods. Words echo; "How
dialog: can I be in several places at once?"...
text: We see ELASHCUTS of the [U+FBO2]orist chase, now with angles
text: that we didn’t see previously; a second CLOAKED FIGURE
text: outside the greenhouse, a third CLOAKED EIGUEE behind the
dialog: hedge.

dialog: plaque; ’This fountain was generously restored with funds
text: raised by F. Butterman, J. Cooper, R. Hatcher, A. Paver...’
text: As the CLOAKED FIGURES stop chanting and sit at the tablet,

dialog: My, he is tenacious isn’t he?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I’m placing you all under arrest on
dialog: suspicion of conspiracy to commit
dialog: murder.
speaker_heading: WEAVER
dialog: Oh come, come Sergeant Angel.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: You should be ashamed of
dialog: yourselves. This is supposed to be
dialog: the community that cares!
dialog: There’s a
dialog: 117.
scene_heading: REV. SHOOTER
dialog: Oh, but we do care Nicholas.
speaker_heading: JOYCE COOPER
dialog: It’s all about the greater good.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: The greater good.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: What do you mean the greater good?
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: The greater good.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Sandford, Nicholas. The village.
speaker_heading: DR. HATCHER
dialog: A happy village is a healthy
dialog: village.
speaker_heading: REAPER
dialog: Perfection breeds contentment and
dialog: contentment is paramount.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: You see, as much as I enjoyed your
dialog: wild theories Sergeant, the truth
text: is far less complex. Blower’s fate
dialog: was simply the result of his being
text: an appalling actor.
text: murmur of "appalling".
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: You murdered him for that?
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: He murdered Bill Shakespeare.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: What!? Oh I see.
text: We see FLASHEACKS of MARTIN ELOWER’s dressing room murder.
text: Now, we see new angles with MULTIPLE CLOAKED FIGURES.
speaker_heading: REAPER
dialog: The Sandford Players is an
dialog: important feather in our cap.
dialog: 118.
speaker_heading: DR. HATCEER
dialog: We couldn’t let Blower jeopardize
dialog: that. Not when we had two
dialog: semimprofessionals waiting in the
dialog: wings.
text: SKINNER points to an OLDER COUPLE in cloaks who wave back.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Let us not forget Greg was an extra
dialog: in Straw Dogs -
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Yes, I know!
speaker_heading: JOYCE COQPER
dialog: Martin was less concerned with the
dialog: reputation of the village than his
dialog: sordid affair with Eve Draper.
text: We see FLASHBACKS of EVE’s murder by MULTIPLE KILLERS.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: And so Eve deserved to die too?
speaker_heading: DR. HATCHER
dialog: She did have an annoying laugh.
text: There’s a murmur of ‘annoying’.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: And George Merchant?
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: He had an awful house.
text: There’s a murmur of "awful".
text: We see FLASHBACKS of MERCHANT’S ‘accidental’ explosion. Now,
text: with MULTIPLE CLOAKED FIGURES engineering it.
speaker_heading: JOYCE COOPER
dialog: We begged him in vain to make his
dialog: residence more in keeping with the
dialog: village’s rustic aesthetic.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: What was Messenger’s crime?
speaker_heading: SNINNER
dialog: Tim Messenger’s tenure as editor of
dialog: the Sandford Citizen has been
dialog: unbearable.
dialog: 119.
speaker_heading: REAPER
dialog: Our once great paper had become
text: riddled with tabloid journalism and
dialog: dreadful punnery. Not to mention
dialog: persistent errors.
speaker_heading: ROY PORTER
dialog: He listed her age as 55.
speaker_heading: MARY PORTER
dialog: When I’m actually 53.
speaker_heading: REV SHOOTER
dialog: The church roof was in need of
dialog: repair and the insurers wouldn’t
dialog: pay unless it was certified
dialog: hazardous. Let’s just say we killed
text: two birds with one stone.
text: FLASHBACK of MULTIPLE CLOAKED FIGURES pushing the turret.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: What about Leslie Tillar? One of
dialog: your own? Her her horticultural
dialog: expertise helped put Sandford on
dialog: the map.
speaker_heading: JOYCE COOPER
dialog: She was ever so good.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Cousin Leslie was a terrible shame.
dialog: But it seems she was set on moving
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: WEAVER
dialog: We had to stop her before she
dialog: shared her green fingers with
dialog: anyone else.
speaker_heading: JOYCE COOPER
dialog: Not least the heathens at Euford
dialog: Abbey.
text: The NWA simultaneously spit on the ground.
speaker_heading: DR. HATCHER
dialog: If we can’t have her no-one can.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: How can this be for the greater
dialog: good?!
dialog: 120.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: The greater good.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Shut it. These people died for no
dialog: reason, no reason whatsoever?
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Oh I wouldn’t say that.
text: All torches move to the voice. To ANGEL’s horror, it is
text: FRANK. He wears the era FASHIONED POLICE CAPE.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I was like you once Nicholas. I
dialog: believed in the immutable word of
dialog: the law. That is until the night
dialog: Mrs. Butterman was taken from me.
dialog: You see, no-one loved Sandford more
dialog: than her. She was head of the
dialog: Women’s Institute, chair of the
dialog: ’[U+FB02]oral committee’, even ran
text: the Neighbourhood Watch before Tom.
dialog: When they started the ’Village of
dialog: the Year’ contest, she worked round
dialog: the clock, it became her life. I’ve
dialog: never seen such dedication. On the
dialog: eve of the adjudicator’s
dialog: arrival, some travellers moved
text: into Callahan Park. Before could
dialog: say gypsy scum, We were knee deep
text: in dog muck, thieving kids and
dialog: crusty jugglers. We lost the title
text: and Irene lost her mind. She drove
dialog: her Datsun Cherry into Sandford
dialog: Gorge. The inquiry said it was an
dialog: accident but I knew better. From
dialog: that moment on I swore that I’d do
dialog: her proud. And whatever the cost,
dialog: we’d make Sandford great again.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Sir, this doesn’t make sense.
speaker_heading: WEAVER
dialog: It makes perfect sense, Sergeant.
text: Frank gathered together a group of
dialog: the most faithful Sandfordians and
dialog: showed us how we might rid our
dialog: streets of the paedophiles and
dialog: perverts-
dialog: 121.
scene_heading: REV. SHOOTER REAPER

speaker_heading: WEAVER AMANDA PAVER

speaker_heading: ANNETTE ROPER
dialog: -the paedophiles, the perverts-
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Yeah, you’ve had them.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: The adjudicators arrive tomorrow
dialog: Nicholas. They were supposed to
dialog: arrive in a couple of months but
dialog: they brought it forward for some
dialog: reason. We had to make sure
dialog: everything was ready.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Are you saying this was all about
dialog: winning the ’Best Village Award’?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: This is the best village Nicholas.
dialog: You’ve seen the people. They’re
text: happy, contented. Most of them
dialog: don’t even know about our work.
dialog: They have very normal lives.
text: There’s a murmur of "very normal".
speaker_heading: ANGEL
text: They’re living in a dream world.
dialog: 122.
speaker_heading: HATCHER
dialog: Precisely. No crime. No tension.
speaker_heading: WEAVER
dialog: Sheer bliss.
text: There’s a murmur of "bliss".
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We have created the society you
dialog: dream about. Isn’t that worth
dialog: preserving?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Not with murder.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Sgt. Popwell thought much the same
dialog: as you. I’m disappointed you can’t
dialog: see the big picture.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Well, I’m happy to disappoint sir.
dialog: And I’m afraid you’re going to have
dialog: to come with me. You’re all going
dialog: to have to come with me.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No Nicholas, I’m afraid it’s you
dialog: who has to some with us...
text: The NWA reveal an array of weapons from under their cloaks;
text: axes, scythes, pitchforks, knives etc.
text: Out of the shadows, a bruised and angry LURCH slaps a hand
text: on ANGEL’s shoulder. ANGEL is shocked. Another hand lands on
text: his other shoulder. he turns to see-
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Danny? No! NO!
text: DANNY is silent. He and LURCH wield knives and torches. With
text: lightning speed ANGEL ducks out of their grip, grabs LURCH’s
text: blade, spins behind DANNY and holds it to his throat. He
text: takes DANNY’s torch and shines it at the NWA.
speaker_heading: ANGEL (cont’d)
dialog: Now back off or you’1l be
dialog: explaining to everyone how Danny
dialog: accidentally tripped and cut his
text: own head off.
text: The NWA continue to close in. FRANK laughs.
dialog: 123.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Oh come on Nicholas. You haven’t
dialog: got it in you.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
speaker_heading: I MEAN IT.
text: They close in further.
dialog: Shit.
text: ANGEL throws DANNY to the ground and runs into the woods.
text: The NWA give chase. A hoard of cloaked figures run through
text: the trees. ANGEL sprints into the darkhess-
text: Suddenly ANGEL trips and falls through a hole in the path.
scene_heading: INT. BLACKNESS - NIGHT
text: ANGEL crashes to a dusty [U+FB02]oor, winded. He picks up his
text: torch and shines it around. He seems to be inside an old
text: GYPSY CARAVAN buried in the ground. His torch picks out a
text: SKELETON IN GYPSY CLOTHING.
text: ANGEL backs up frantically, colliding with an ENTIRE FAMILY
text: OF GYPSY SKELETONS, complete with children and dog.
text: ANGEL staggers to the door which bursts open into a cave.
text: His torch picks out many more bodies. The most recent
text: addition, in a PURPLE SHELL SUIT is a dead PETER COCKER.
text: ANGEL jumps back and finds himself staring at a skeleton in
text: a police sergeant’s uniform. It has a BIG BUSHY BEARD.
text: ANGEL [U+FB02]ees the cave and sees one other corpse; that of
text: the LIVING STATUE, now frozen in a final expression of
dialog: terror.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
text: ANGEL slams straight into DANNY at the cave mouth.
text: The other NWA members gather behind, an ominous mass of
text: shadow. DANNY produces his blade.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Danny! No!
text: DANNY plunges the knife into ANGEL’s chest. We see ANGEL
text: stagger back. His torch drops and smashes.
dialog: 124.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. DANNY’S CAR - NIGHT
text: A sign looms in the night - ’YOU ARE NOW LEAVING SANDFORD’.
text: A grim DANNY pulls into a dark layby in his Astra. The brake
text: lights illuminate the sign with a hellish glow.
scene_heading: INT/EXT DANNY’S CAR - NIGHT
text: A car boot opens. DANNY stands over a bloodied ANGEL, the
text: knife protruding from his chest.
text: ANGEL slowly opens his eyes and looks at DANNY with
text: confusion. DANNY slowly opens his hand to reveal a number of
text: empty ketchup sachets.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: Ta-daaaa.
text: DANNY yanks the knife out of ANGEL’s chest. ANGEL produces
text: the notebook from his breast pocket.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: They told me I had to put you in
dialog: the front seat and push you in the
dialog: gorge.
text: DANNY hauls ANGEL out of the car boot.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Danny, it’s murder.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It’s not, it’s ketchup.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I’m not talking about me Danny, I’m
dialog: talking about all the others the
dialog: NWA have murdered.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: That’s not true. Dad just said it’s
dialog: his special club. I thought it was
text: just about rapping knuckles and
text: sending them on their way.
dialog: 125.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: There are skeletons back there
dialog: Danny.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I don’t know nuffin about the
dialog: skelingtons!
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: But what about Draper, Blower,
dialog: Merchant, Messenger and Tiller?
dialog: What do you think was happening?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: It was Frank, Danny. He’s appointed
dialog: himself judge, jury and
dialog: executioner.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: He’s not Judge Judy!
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: He is Danny! And you have to help
dialog: me take him down.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I can’t Nicholas. I’m involved now.
dialog: I have to do what Dad says. I can’t
dialog: get out. But you can. Take the car
dialog: go back to London. There’s nothing
dialog: you can do.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I can come back. And I can bring
dialog: the blue fury of the Metropolitan
dialog: Police Service with me.
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: They’11 make it all disappear. They
dialog: hid it from everyone else. Who are
dialog: they gonna believe? Dad, or the

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: But you’1l be here won’t you Danny?
dialog: We can do this together. You and
dialog: me. Partners.
dialog: 126.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Forget it Nicholas. It’s Sandford.
text: A tearful DANNY pulls out his car keys. ANGEL takes them,
text: limps to the car and drives off. In his rear view, ANGEL can
text: just make out the figure of DANNY standing in the road.
scene_heading: INT. DANNY’S CAR - NIGHT
text: ANGEL drives down the M4. Rain lashes his windscreen. His
text: fuel light blinks low. He reaches ’HESTON SERVICES’.
scene_heading: INT. HESTON SERVICES - NIGHT
text: A CLERK eyes ANGEL, who is covered in grime and ketchup.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Is that everything Sir?
text: ANGEL’s gaze has been drawn to a bargain bin full of DVDs.
text: He scans the titles - ’OUT FOR JUSTICE’, ’THE ENFDRCER’,
text: ‘LETHAL WEAPON’, ‘WALKING TALL’, ’HARD TO KILL’.
speaker_heading: CLERK (cont’d)
dialog: Sir? Sir? Is there anything we can
dialog: do for you?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: No. This is something I have to do
dialog: myself.
text: ANGEL grabs a pair of shades, a [U+FB02]stful of car spray
text: paints and some bubble gum. He slams down some crumpled
dialog: money.
scene_heading: EXT. BRANNIGAN’S FARM - MORNING
text: We see the ‘WELCOME TO SANDFORD’ sign.
text: It’s morning outside JAMES REAPER’s farm. His GREEN 4X4
text: pulls over to the roadside. He gets out and walks to some
text: horses at a gate. They snort, restless. REAPER looks behind
text: him. The ASTRA is sitting right in the middle of the road.
speaker_heading: REAPER
dialog: Danny?
text: REAPER squints. It’s not DANNY. Sitting behind the wheel,
text: wearing shades and revving the engine, is ANGEL.
dialog: 127.
text: Reaper runs to his 4X4...ANGEL screams towards him...Reaper
text: grabs his car radio..
text: SMASH. ANGEL crashes his car directly into the 4X4...REAPER
text: is left clutching the radio and snapped cable...ANGEL

text: REAPER’S MUM brandishes a shotgun from the other side of the

text: ANGEL runs towards the gate, jumps into the air and launches
text: into a [U+FB02]ying kick. REAPER’S MUM snaps the shotgun
text: shut, ANGEL lands on her, with maximum force.
scene_heading: EXT. BRANNIGAN’S FARM - MORNING
text: JAMES REAFER and his MUM are tied to the fence.

scene_heading: INT/EXT. EVIDENCE ROOM - MORNING
text: '999’ is punched into the keypad. The door opens on the

text: The room is now completely empty, save for the sea mine.
dialog: 128.
scene_heading: INT. FRANK’S OFFICE - MORNING

scene_heading: INT. STATION - MORNING
text: ANGEL glides past the DESK SERGEANT, who finally pipes up.
speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT
dialog: Oh Sergeant Angel? Someone from
dialog: London called for you.
text: ANGEL scowls back at him, chewing gum, armed to the teeth.
speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT (cont'd)
dialog: I’11 tell them you’1l1 ring ’em
dialog: back.
text: ANGEL nods and walks out. The DESK SERGEANT watches him go.
speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT (cont'd)
dialog: That’s funny.
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.}
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT
dialog: I didn’t know we had a mounted

speaker_heading: ANGEL.
text: It’s his curly haired twin brother.
scene_heading: THE OTHER DESK SERGEANT
dialog: Nobody tells me nothing.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - MORNING
text: An armed ANGEL trots down the street on a FUCKING HORSE. He
text: rides past a bus shelter where GABRIEL WEAVER and the

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Wanna do something useful?
text: ANGEL throws a holdall to GABRIEL. It’s full of spray cans.
dialog: 129.
scene_heading: INT. STATION/CCTV OFFICE - MORNING
text: WEAVER reads the paper and daintily eats ice cream. He does
text: not see the CCTV screens slowly turn black behind him.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGH STREET - MORNING
text: Sandford. As it was that first morning. Idyllic, bustling,
text: happy. Among the morning folk we see smiling NWA members
text: going about their business as if nothing has happened.
text: We see WORKMEN putting up a banner across the middle of the
text: street reading ’GOOD LUCK SANDFORD: VILLAGE OE THE YEAR’.
text: ANNETTE ROPER is putting out a display in front of her shop.
text: Her walkie-talkie crackles to life.

text: on in terror.
text: SKINNER and his staff stare from the window of SUMMERAISLES.

scene_heading: INT. STATION - MORNING
text: WEAVER bursts into FRANK’s office, panic stricken. FRANK

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Angel.
scene_heading: EXT. SQUARE - MORNING
text: The village has come to a stop. The NWA watch as ANGEL
text: dismounts. Beads of sweat glisten. Eyes [U+FB02]ick this way
text: and that. The ordinary folk are unnerved by the hush.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Morning.
text: MR. TREACHER [U+FB02]ings open his winter coat revealing a

text: The village erupts into chaos. The innocent run for cover.
text: The NWA mobilise. The PORTERS scurry inside. DR. HATCHER
text: emerges from his surgery with a number of guns.
text: ANNETTE ROPER runs into her shop. Moments later an upper
text: window smashes and the barrel of a gun protrudes.
text: DANNY sits in the car, his face a mixture of awe and panic.
text: ANGEL takes a look at MR. TREACHER’s position. He is
text: standing next to a truck loaded with BEER BARRELS. ANGEL
text: jumps up and fires blasting the catch holding the BEER
text: BARRELS in place. They tumble off the back of the truck
text: knocking TREACHER off his feet.
text: ANGEL is pinned down by fire from ANNETTE ROPER. He looks up
text: to see ROPER’S gun poking out of her shop.
text: ANGEL sees the HOODIES hiding behind a car. He motions to
text: the newsagent. The HOODIES stampede into the shop. The door
text: slams. We see the notice; "ONLY ONE CHILD AT ANY TIME".
text: In the window, ROPER’S gun is suddenly yanked backwards. We
text: hear muffied screams and blows.
text: Shots ring out, a hail of bullets narrowly missing ANGEL.
text: Pedalling towards him on her cycle, firing a ri[U+FBO2]e is
text: AMANDA PAVER. ANGEL dives out of the line of fire.
dialog: 
text: DANNY sees AMANDA PAVER in his wing mirror. His face

dialog: 131.
text: DANNY runs over to join ANGEL. ANGEL throws him a shotgun.

speaker_heading: JOYCE COOPER
dialog: Fascist!

text: One of JOYCE’s hanging baskets drops directly on her head.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Hag!
text: There’s a piercing yell. ANGEL turns to see BERNARD baring
text: down fast with the ORNAMENTAL SWORD. ANGEL barely manages to
text: draw his baton to block the attack. BERNARD swipes, slicing
text: the baton in half. ANGEL takes out BERNARD’s legs with a
text: foot sweep. BERNARD crashes down.
text: Then from behind ANGEL.
scene_heading: REV. SHOOTER
dialog: STOP! STOP THIS! Please. Let us put
dialog: down our guns. Nicholas, my son,
dialog: you may not be a man of god but
dialog: surely you’re a man of peace.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Reverend I may not be convinced
dialog: about the existence of God but I
dialog: know good and evil and I have the

scene_heading: REV. SHOOTER
dialog: Oh fuck off Grasshopper!
text: REV. SHOOTER pulls a pistol from his cassock and fires. The

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Noooooooo00!
text: DANNY returns fire at SHOOTER hitting him in the shoulder.

scene_heading: REV. SHOOTER

speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Still feel like you’re missing out?
text: CLICK. They turn to see DR. HATCHER pointing a shotgun.
speaker_heading: DR. HATCHER
dialog: Drop your weapons.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Dr. Hatcher wait.
speaker_heading: DR. HATCHER
dialog: Shut up Danny. I brought you into
dialog: this world, it’s rather fitting I
dialog: should be the one to take you out
dialog: of it. You and your interfering
dialog: little friend. Now drop them!
text: DANNY does so. His shotgun hits the [U+FBO2]oor. BLAM! It

dialog: blood.
text: DR. HATCHER clutches his knee, wailing in pain.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: You’re a doctor, deal with

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What are you thinking exactly?
text: A shot blasts from the windows of THE CROWN.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Pub?
text: ANGEL eyes the board outside the pub; reading ’COME ON IN!’
scene_heading: INT/EXT. THE CROWN - MORNING
text: SMASH. The pub board comes smashing through the window.
text: The PORTERS fire wildly from behind the bar, before a sign
text: reading ’TWO SHOOTERS FOR THE PRICE OF ONE’. They stop.
text: Then - the pub doors [U+FB02]y open. DANNY and ANGEL burst
text: in, jumping through the air whilst both firing two guns.
dialog: 133.
text: They land and roll, grabbing tables to form a barricade. The
text: PORTERS open fire again. Tables and chairs splinter.
text: ANGEL pops up and fires at a bear trap on the wall. It falls
text: and clamps its jaws around ROY PORTER’s head.
speaker_heading: MARY PORTER
dialog: Roy! Somebody call the police!
speaker_heading: FRANK (0.S.}
dialog: Reach!
text: The entire Sandford police burst in, wearing RIOT GEAR and

text: FRANK leads them, aiming his ANTIQUE PISTOLS at ANGEL.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT’D}
dialog: Officers, arrest that man. Danny,
text: step away from the Sergeant.

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: No, I’m not taking orders from you

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Officers, arrest these men!
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: You can arrest us if you want. You

dialog: to being blind, submissive slaves.
speaker_heading: CARTWRIGHT
dialog: What the fuck is he on about?
speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT
dialog: What the fuck are you on about?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Have you ever wondered why the
dialog: crime rate in Sandford is so low
dialog: and the accident rate so high?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: No. Yes. What?
dialog: 134.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: You’ve been brain washed Sergeant
text: into naivety by an old man with a
dialog: murderous obsession and it’s time
dialog: you opened your eyes to the truth.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: This is ridiculous.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: No, it’s not Dad. It’s very
dialog: unridiculous. And it’s only now
dialog: that I’m starting to realise how
dialog: unridiculous it all is.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Silence Danny! Think of your
dialog: mother.
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: Mum’s dead and for the first time
dialog: in my life, I’m glad. Because even
dialog: though she loved this village more
dialog: than anything if she could see what
dialog: you’ve become, she’d kill herself
dialog: all over again.
speaker_heading: DORIS THATCHER
dialog: Sorry, I’m completely lost.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Sandford is a lie Doris. For the
dialog: last twenty years the village has
dialog: been controlled by Frank and the
dialog: NWA. They’ve lulled you into
dialog: thinking this is a perfect village
dialog: by killing anyone who threatened to
dialog: change that.
text: SAXON stops growling. BOB WALKER pipes up.
speaker_heading: WALKER
dialog: Recconneeegottsumadere.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: He says he ‘’reckons you got
dialog: something there’.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I know. Thanks.
dialog: 135.
speaker_heading: WALKER/DANNY
dialog: S’alroight.
text: FRANK rounds on the officers, raising his pistols at them.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You’re not seriously going to
dialog: believe this man are you? Are you?!
dialog: He’s not even from round here.
text: The officers look on in confused disbelief at the manic
text: FRANK, who realises he is brandishing his weapons.
speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT
dialog: Maybe it’s time to give it up sir.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You ignorant flatfoots!
text: FRANK snaps, shooting his pistols up in the air. He hits a
text: rustic light fitting, which crashes to the ground.
text: ANGEL and the other officers dive out of the way, as glass
text: explodes across the main bar. Everyone scatters.
text: In the confusion, FRANK makes a bid for freedom through the
text: back of the pub. ANGEL jumps up. The other officers stare
text: after FRANK, then look to ANGEL, their new leader.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Let’s go.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Aren’t we gonna go after dad?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
text: He’11 come round again.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Well, who else is there?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Want anything from the shop?
text: FLASHCUTS; the police tool up, cuff people. PC WALKER and
text: SAXON guard the already incapacitated NWA members. ROY
text: PORTER still has the bear trap on his head.
dialog: 136.
scene_heading: EXT. SUMMERAISLES - MORNING
text: ANGEL leads his new recruits as they approach the car park
text: They take cover behind recycling bins, armed and ready.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What you thinking?
dialog: Before Angel can answer-
speaker_heading: FISHR
dialog: We should strike now while we have
dialog: the element of surprise, the longer
dialog: we wait the more time they have to
dialog: mobilise. I say we go in through
dialog: the front entrance and take the
dialog: place aisle by aisle. They won’t be
dialog: expecting that.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Very good. What he said.
scene_heading: INT. SUMMERAILES - MORNING
text: A grim SKINNER and his gormless minions watch the CCTV.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: My, my. Here come the fuzz.
scene_heading: EXT. SUMMERAISLES - MORNING
text: The Sandford police gather near the entrance.
speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT
dialog: Maybe they’re not in.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Wait here.
text: ANGEL goes into SUMMERAISLES through the automatic door.
speaker_heading: DORIS THATCHER
dialog: We can’t let him go in on his own.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: He knows what he’s doing.
text: KRAAASSSHHHH! ANGEL comes [U+FB02]ying through the front
text: window of the shop and lands in a heap on the ground. He
text: gets up.
dialog: 137.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: They’re in. You take the shop. I’1l
text: deal with the trolley boy.
scene_heading: WAINWRIGHT CARTWRIGHT
dialog: Eh? Eh?
text: LURCH strides out of the shop.
scene_heading: WAINWRIGHT CARTWRIGHT
dialog: Oh. Oh.
text: DANNY leads the officers in, as ANGEL faces up to LURCH.
speaker_heading: ANGEL (cont’d)
dialog: We don’t have to do this Michael.
dialog: Is this what you really want?
speaker_heading: LURCH
dialog: Yarp.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Suit yourself.
text: ANGEL runs at LUNCH and headbutts him in the face.
scene_heading: INT. SUMMRAISLES - MORNING
text: The OFFICERS make their way through the supermarket aisles.
text: WAINWRIGHT peers round a corner. One of the GRUFF BUTCHERS
text: throws a large meat cleaver. It shatters a tomato sauce jar
text: next to his head. CARTWRIGHT shrieks, assuming it’s blood.
speaker_heading: CARTWRIGHT
dialog: Andy!
text: Meanwhile ANGEL is being swung around by LURCH, his arms
text: clamped tightly around LURCH’s neck. ANGEL [U+FB02]ailing
text: legs knock produce off shelves as he clings on tight. LURCH
text: begins to lose consciousness. He staggers past a ‘’WET FLOOR’
text: sign, slips and both fall hard into a chest freezer.
text: ANGEL scrambles out covered in frost. LURCH is out cold.
text: ANGEL joins the other officers, who crouch behind shelves as
text: they shoot at the two GRUEE EUTCHERS.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Where’s Lurch?
dialog: 138.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
text: He’s unconscious in the freezer.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Did you say ‘cool off’?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: No I didn’t say anything.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Oh shame.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: But you missed a bit earlier when I
dialog: distracted him with the monkey,
dialog: said ’Playtime’s over’ and hit him
dialog: with the Peace Lily.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You’re off the fucking chain!
text: Another cleaver whizzes by, smashing more sauce bottles.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: What’s the situation?
speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT
text: Two blokes and a lot of cutlery.
dialog: What do you reckon?
text: The two GRUFF BUTCHERS wait, knives drawn, ready to throw.
text: Suddenly a terrific clattering rumble fills the store. A
text: battering ram comprised of several trollies handcuffed
text: together bursts into view, hurtling toward the GRUFF
text: BUTCHERS. The ANDES ride the front of the trolley-ram,
text: yelling like Vikings.
text: The trollies crash into the meat counter, knocking the GRUFF
text: BUTCHERS to the [U+FB02]o0or. The ANDES leap off the makeshift
text: battering ram and deck the [U+FB02]oored bad guys.
text: A PIERCING SCREAM. The officers turn to see the sluttish
text: CHECKOUT GIRL running towards them.
text: DORIS THATCHER grabs the ’WET FLOOR’ sign and slams it into
text: the CHECKOUT GIRL’s face. She slides across the [U+FBO2]oor.
speaker_heading: WAINWRIGHT (cont’d)
dialog: Nice one Doris.
speaker_heading: DORIS THATCHER
dialog: Nothing like a bit of girl on girl.
dialog: 139.
text: SPLAT! The officers duck for cover. Gangly SHELF STACKERS
text: appear, throwing a volley of melons and pineapples.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Can you handle this sergeant? We’re
text: going after the big boss.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: We’re on it, Sergeant.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Danny, let’s roll.
speaker_heading: WAINWEIGHT
dialog: Angel! Don’t go being a twat now.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I wouldn’t give you the
dialog: satisfaction.
text: ANGEL and DANNY burst in. The office is deserted, the window
text: open. They see SKINNER in the car park climbing into a SQUAD
text: CAR, driven by FRANK.
speaker_heading: ANGEL (cont’d)
dialog: Let’s get down there.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Skip.
text: ANGEL and DANNY jump through the open window and land ina
text: skip full of cardboard boxes, as FRANK’s car peels off.
speaker_heading: ANGEL (cont’d)
dialog: Head ’em off?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Fuck yeah.
text: ANGEL and DANNY sprint down an alley, burst back into the
text: square and race towards DANNY’s SQUAD CAR.
speaker_heading: DANNY (cont’d)
dialog: I'll drive.
text: ANGEL slides over the bonnet to the passenger side. FRANK’S
text: car screams past. DANNY gets in and [U+FBO2]icks on the
text: siren.
dialog: 140.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Punch that shit!
text: They screech off. Behind them we see the once picturesque
text: square bullet riddled and blood splattered. The banner
text: reading ‘Village of the Year’ [U+FBO2]utters to the ground.
text: Three official looking types holding clipboards stand
text: gobsmacked amid the debris.
scene_heading: EXT. SANDFOED STREETS - DAY
text: FRANK’s car races past a ’KILL YOUR SPEED’ sign.
text: Behind, ANGEL and DANNY gain on them. They take turns
text: shooting at FRANK’s car as they go. It’s COP ON COP.
text: FRANK’s car hits the brow of a hill at 100mph and gets air.
text: As it hits the road again, SKINNNR spots something.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Swan!
text: FRANK panics. Swerves. Big mistake. The car careers off the
text: road and smashes right into a sign for the ’MODEL VILLAGE’.
scene_heading: EXT. MODEL VILLAGE - DAY
text: A beautiful blue sky. The sun beams down on a perfect vista
text: of Sandford. The idyllic shot is quickly ruined however as-
text: A GIGANTIC SQUAD CAR [U+FB02]ies over what we reveal to be a
text: miniature version of Sandford. A small GINGER HAIRED KID
text: stares in awe as the SQUAD CAR brie[U+FB02]y blocks out the
dialog: sun.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - DAY
text: ANGEL and DANNY’s SQUAD CAR reaches the brow of the hill.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Swan.
text: DANNY brakes with expert timing. They screech to a stop by
text: the waddling SWAN. ANGEL opens the door and grabs the SWAN.
dialog: 141.
scene_heading: EXT. MODEL VILLAGE - DAY
text: The SWAN now sat in the back seat, DANNY takes the SQUAD CAR
text: into the Model Village. Ahead is a scene of devastation.
text: FRANK’s SQUAD CAR lies upturned in a water feature, a
text: damaged sprinkler rains water down onto the model village.
text: FRANK is motionless at the wheel.
text: SKINNER limps away from the crash. ANGEL jumps from the car
text: and runs toward him. DANNY runs over to his injured father.
text: SKINNER swipes up the GINGER HAIRED KID and holds a pistol
text: to his head. ANGEL freezes, stopping dead in his tracks.
speaker_heading: SKTNNER
dialog: Stay back or the ginger nut gets
dialog: it!
text: The KID thinks fast, sinking his teeth into SKINNER’s hand.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Ow you little fucker!
text: SKINNER drops the kid. Before he has a chance to recover,
text: ANGEL pounces and they both crash down into the tiny
text: village. SKINNER’s pistol skitters down a miniature street.
text: ANGEL and SKINNER spring back up. The sprinkler rains down
text: as they trade blows. The low angle in the model village
text: makes them look like GODZILLA and KING KONG.
text: ANGEL hits SKINNER twice hard in the face. Reaching out
text: SKINNER grabs ANGELS’s hand. ANGEL winces in pain. SKINNER
text: sees he has discovered a weakness and exploits it. He twists
text: ANGEL’s hand whilst raining blows down on his face.
speaker_heading: SKINNER (cont’d)
dialog: GET GUT GE MY VILLAGE!
text: ANGEL straightens himself like T2 and shakes his head.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: It’s not your village any more.
scene_heading: WHAM. ANGEL [U+FBO2]attens SKINNER with one punch. SKINNER
text: sprawls across a mini village sguare. ANGEL looks over to
text: the GINGER KID, who is agog at the coolness of events.
speaker_heading: ANGEL (cont’d)
dialog: Well done son. What’s your name?
dialog: 142.
scene_heading: GINGER HAIRED KID
dialog: Aaron A. Aaronson.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I’m sorry?
text: The KID’s eyes go wide. ANGEL spins around. Behind is a
text: Maniacal SKINNER, holding a box cutter knife and running
text: full pelt at ANGEL through the tiny streets.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Annnnnnnnnnnnnngell1111111!
text: SKINNER trips on a model Someraisles truck. His legs slip
text: from under him, sending him [U+FB02]ying. He spins in the
dialog: air.
text: SPLAT. SKINNER falls hard onto the miniature church roof. A
text: model turret has embedded itself beneath SKINNER’s chin and
text: protrudes through his mouth.
text: ANGEL looks to DANNY who pulls FRANK from the SQUAD CAR.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
text: Danny. It’s over.
speaker_heading: SKINNER (0.S.}
dialog: Ooowwww .
text: SKINNER is not actually dead. He speaks, even though his
text: neck and tongue are now pierced by the turret.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Goooow, thith weally hurth. I can’t
dialog: feel my thongue. I’m going to need
dialog: thome ice cream.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: There’s plenty of ice cream back at
dialog: the station. Isn’t there-
text: ANGEL turns to see FRANK holding a gun to DANNY’s head.
speaker_heading: ANGEL (cont’d)
dialog: Oh pack it in Frank, you silly
dialog: bastard!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Now, now Sergeant. We don’t want
dialog: any more bloodshed.
dialog: 143.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Dad, don’t do this!
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Frank, this whole thing started
dialog: because you lost someone you loved.
dialog: Don’t expect me to believe you’d
dialog: let it end the same way.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I’11 tell you how this is going to
dialog: end!
text: He points his gun at ANGEL. DANNY leaps on FRANK wrestling
text: the gun from him. FRANK sprints off towards ANGEL’s car.
text: DANNY aims the gun at him and is about to pull the trigger.
text: He can’t. Instead he points the gun in the air and fires.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Aaaaargh!
text: FRANK jumps in the car and peels off, wheels screeching.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: FRANK looks in his rear view. No one pursues him.
text: However he is not alone in the car. Behind, the long slender
text: neck of THE SWAN rears up. FRANK turns. It pounces.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - MORNING
text: ANGEL and DANNY watch as the CAR veers wildly and crashes
text: into a tree. We hear the sound of distant swan battle.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I feel like I should say something
dialog: smart.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You don’t have to say anything at
dialog: all.
text: Rehind them cars screech up and the rest of the Sandford
text: police run over. The two officers look up to see a
text: METROPOLITAN POLICE HELICOPTER coming to land in a field.
dialog: 144.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - LATER
text: FRANK sits handcuffed in the back of an ambulance, wearing a
dialog: neckbrace.
text: SKINNER is carried through shot on a stretcher, the model
text: church spire still sticking through his face. The HOODIES
dialog: record this sight on their mobiles.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Ow ow Ow Ow Ow Ow ow.
text: We see the Swan cuffed to a car door by the neck. The OLD
text: MAN IN A CAP approaches to retrieve him.
text: ANGEL and DANNY sit with blankets around them. They are
text: addressed by the three ofificers from the start of the film.
speaker_heading: CHIEF INSPECTOR
dialog: What do you say Nicholas?
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: We’ve been trying to reach you for
dialog: days.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Well I’ve been kind of busy.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: We need you back. The figures have
dialog: gone a little squiffy in your
dialog: absence it has to be said.
speaker_heading: CHIEF INSPECTOR
dialog: Come back to London. Sandford’s
dialog: hardly fitting for such an
dialog: exceptional officer.
text: ANGEL looks to DANNY, then back at the model Sandford.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Yes, but the thing is sir. I like
dialog: it here. Now, if you’1l excuse me,
dialog: we have to do a considerable amount
dialog: of paperwork.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. STATION - DAY
text: FASTCUTS of forms being filled, various NWA members
text: processed; prints, mug shots etc. ROY PORTER still has the
text: bear trap on his head. He is measured as 7 feet 5 inches.
dialog: 145.
scene_heading: INT. STATION - DUSK
text: The entire Sandford force, including both DESK SERGEANTS sit
text: guietly scribbling away. DANNY is particularly hard at work,
text: the Peace Lily now has pride of place on his desk.
speaker_heading: WATNWRIGHT
dialog: Fucking hell Nick, this is going to
dialog: take ages.
speaker_heading: CARTWRIGHT
dialog: Yeah, we’re gonna be here all
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Good job we’ve got the manpower
dialog: isn’t it Andy?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Actually, official vocab guidelines
dialog: state that we say ‘staf [U+FB02]ng’,
dialog: not ‘manpower’. ‘Manpower’s sexist.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: You don’t mind a bit of manpower do
dialog: you Doris?
speaker_heading: DORIS THATCHER
dialog: Dirty bastard!
text: Everyone laughs. Whoops and catcalls fill the office. ANGEL
dialog: is for once the office joker.
text: A WASTEPAPER BASKET hits him hard on the head.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Hey you cheeky fucker!
text: Another huge laugh. ANGEL grins at DANNY, who appears
text: suddenly grave. He follows DANNY’s gaze to see TOM WEAVER.
text: Aiming a BLUNDERBUSS at ANGEL, his face full of hate.
speaker_heading: WEAVER
dialog: You know what you are? A bloody
dialog: busy -body!
text: WEAVER fires. DANNY lunges at ANGEL, pushing him off his
text: chair and taking full force of WEAVER’s blast in the chest.
text: With lightning speed ANGEL slips his feet into a wastepaper
text: basket and kicks it at WEAVER’s face.
dialog: 146.
text: WEAVER staggers back into the evidence ream. He hits the
text: back shelf. The sea mine teeters, rolls forward and drops
text: between WEAVER’s legs, narrowly missing his crotch.
speaker_heading: WEAVER (cont’d)
dialog: Oh thank god.
text: KA-BOOM. The sea mine gees off. The evidence room door
text: blasts outwards. ANGEL [U+FB02]ies backwards thrcugh the air.
scene_heading: SANDFORD POLICE STATION EXPLODES.
text: In the clearing smoke, paperwork [U+FBO2]utters to the fioor.
text: From under the rubble, we see movement. A hedgehog crawls
text: out, blinking in the light.
text: Then the Sandford Police Service, blackened but intact,
text: miraoulcusly get to their feet. A frantic ANGEL hurries over
text: to find DANNY who lies among the debris, barely alive.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Hold an Danny. Everything’s
dialog: alright.
text: The offieers gather round ANGEL cradling DANNY in his arms.
speaker_heading: ANGEL (cont’d)
dialog: Everything’s gonna be just fine.
scene_heading: EXT. SANDFORD/VARIOUS - DAY
text: CAPTION - ’One Year Later’. We see ANGEL leaving a cottage
text: and walk by a garden yath.
text: We see ANGEL, now an Inspector, suiting up at the station.
text: His uniform is different however. It’s more modern. Cooler.
text: He is else armed with an automatic revolver.
text: ANGEL strolls down a station corridor. Familiar looking
text: brightly coloured notices are pinned all around the walls.
text: ANGEL walks out of the newly built station, and gets into
dialog: his new SQUAD CAR. It’s mere modern. Cooler.
text: ANGEL drives along, his passenger seat conspicuously empty.
text: He passes a skate yark where GABRIEL WEAVER and friends
text: congregate, their heeds down. His mobile rings. He answers.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Okay. Give me a minute.
text: ANGEL comes out of the florists, now called LESLIE’S GARDEN,
text: with a bouquet of [U+FBO2]owers and gets into his car.
dialog: 147.
text: He walks through the graveyard to a single headstone. We see
text: that it reads BUTTERMAN.
speaker_heading: ANGEL (CONT’D)
dialog: Are these okay?
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Yeah they’re lovely.
text: DANNY is revealed, standing next to ANGEL. He kneels down
text: and places the [U+FBO2]owers on a grave. ANGEL steps back,
text: revealing the full headstone. It reads, ‘IRENE BUTTERMAN’.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. SQUAD CAR - DAY
text: DANNY and ANGEL are in their car. The radic crackles.
speaker_heading: DORIS THATCHER (0.S.)
dialog: Any officers near the church?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Go ahead Doris.
speaker_heading: DORIS TRATCHER (0.S.)
dialog: Chief, we’ve had a report of some
dialog: hippy types messin’ with the
text: recycle bins at the supermarket.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Leave it with us. Sergeant
dialog: Butterman. Little hand says it’s
dialog: time to rock and roll.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Bring the noise.
text: We cut to the exterior of the SQUAD CAR. ANGEL pulls a
text: spectacular handbrake turn, spinning the car 180 degrees.
text: Accelerating with a roar, the car hurtles towards us,
text: filling the frame.
text: CRASH TO BLACK
dialog:
