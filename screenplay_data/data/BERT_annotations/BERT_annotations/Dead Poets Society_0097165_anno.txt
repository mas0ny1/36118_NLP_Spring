speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Now remember, keep your shoulders back.
text: A student opens up a case and removes a set of bagpipes. The young
text: boy and his brother line up for a photograph
speaker_heading: PHOTOGRAPHER
dialog: Okay, put your arm around your brother.
dialog: That's it. And breathe in.
text: The young boy blinks as the flash goes off.
speaker_heading: PHOTOGRAPHR
dialog: Okay, one more.
text: An old man lights a single candle. A teacher goes over the old
dialog: man's duties.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: Now just to review, you're going to
dialog: follow along the procession until you
text: get to the headmaster. At that point
dialog: he will indicate to you to light the
text: candles of the boys.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: All right boys, let's settle down.
text: The various boys, including NEIL, KNOX, and CAMERON, line up holding
text: banners. Ahead of them is the old man, followed by the boy with the
text: bagpipes with the two youngest boys at the front.
speaker_heading: MAN
text: Banners up.
text: The boys hoist the banners and the bagpipes begin to play loudly. The
text: small group marches out of the room and down a set of stairs into a
text: church. The pews are filled with students and parents while the
text: teachers, all dressed in robes, are seated at the front of the church
text: behind the headmaster.
text: The boys break off to either side at the front of the church. The
text: bagpipes cease and the headmaster, MR. NOLAN, walks over to the old
text: man carrying the candle.
speaker_heading: MR NOLAN
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, boys, the light
dialog: of knowledge.
text: An organ begins to play as the old man goes forward with shaking hands
text: to the young boys in the front pew. Each boy is holding a candle and
text: he bends over to light the first one. Each boy in turn lights the
text: candle of the boy next to him.
speaker_heading: MR NOLAN
dialog: One hundred years ago, in 1859, 41 boys sat in this
text: room and were asked the same question that greets
dialog: you at the start of each semester. Gentlemen, what
dialog: are the four pillars?
text: All throughout the pews, uniformed boys rise to their feet. TODD, who
text: is not wearing a uniform, is urged by his father to stand with them.
speaker_heading: BOYS
dialog: Tradition, honor, discipline, excellence.
text: The boys quickly return to their seats.
speaker_heading: MR NOLAN
dialog: In her first year, Welton Academy graduated five
dialog: students. Last year we graduated fifty-one. And
dialog: more than seventy-five percent of those went on to
dialog: the Ivy League. This, this kind of accomplishment is
text: the result of fervent dedication to the principles taught
dialog: here. This is why you parents have been sending us
dialog: your sons. This is why we are the best preparatory
dialog: school in the United States.
text: Mr. Nolan soaks up the applause from the audience.
speaker_heading: MR NOLAN
dialog: As you know, our beloved Mr. Portius of the English
dialog: department retired last term. You will have the
dialog: opportunity later to meet his replacement, Mr. John
dialog: Keating, himself a graduate of this school. And who,
dialog: for the past several years, has been teaching at the

speaker_heading: MRS ANDERSON

speaker_heading: MR NOLAN

speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Todd Anderson.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Why'd you leave Balincrest?
speaker_heading: TODD

scene_heading: INT DORMATORY - DAY
text: DR. HAGER is standing in his room doorway while SPAZ and his father are
text: going over some last minute precautions over the boy's allergies. Spaz's
text: father hands Hager various bottles.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: This is for sinuses. Oh, and if he can't swallow you
dialog: give him one of these. And if he had trouble breathing
dialog: you can give him some of those.
speaker_heading: HAGER
dialog: All right fine.
text: Dr. Hager takes the bottles and quickly backs into his room, shutting
text: the door.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (to son)
dialog: Did you remember your vaporizer?
speaker_heading: SPAZ
dialog: Yes, I put it in my room.
text: Spaz's father tries to say something else to Dr. Hager but realizes he
text: has already gone.
scene_heading: INT HALLWAY - DAY
text: Neil pushes his way through a crowd of boys, carrying two suitcases. As
text: he enters his room, Knox quickly passes by.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Hey, how's it going Neil?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Hey Knox.
text: Cameron comes by and leans against the doorway.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Neil, study group tonight?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Yeah, sure.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Business as usual, huh? Hey, I hear you got the new
dialog: kid. Looks like a stiff!
text: He begins laughing when he notices Todd coming into the room.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Oops!
text: Cameron quickly leaves. Neil tries to keep from laughing as Todd enters
text: the room and sets his luggage down on his bed.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Listen, don't mind Cameron. He was born with his
dialog: foot in his mouth. You know what I mean?
text: He pulls some papers from his blazer pocket and playfully whacks Todd
text: across the back with it.
text: CHARLIE comes to the door with a smug expression on his face. Knox and
text: MEEKS are close behind him. He points at Neil
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Rumor has it, you did summer school.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Yep. Chemistry. My father thought I should get ahead.
dialog: How was your summer Slick?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Keen.
text: The boys enter the room. Charlie turns around and looks at Meeks who is
text: just entering.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Meeks. Door. Closed.
speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: Yes sir.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Gentlemen, what are the four pillars?
speaker_heading: BOYS
text: Travesty. Horror. Decadence. Excrement.
text: Charlie makes himself comfortable on Neil's bed and lights up a cigarette.
text: Meanwhile, Todd is by his bed unpacking his luggage.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Okay, study group. Meeks aced Latin. I didn't quite
dialog: flunk English. So, if you want, we've got our study
dialog: group.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Sure. Cameron asked me too. Anyone mind
dialog: including him?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hmm, what's his specialty, boot-licking?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Come on, he's your roommate.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That's not my fault.
text: Meeks seems to notice Todd for the first time.
speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry, my name is Steven Meeks.
text: Neil quickly gets up from his spot by the window.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Oh, this is Todd Anderson.
text: Todd turns around and shakes hands with Meeks.
speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: Nice to meet you.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Nice to meet you.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Charlie Dalton.
text: Charlie continues to lay on the bed, looking smug. Knox extends a hand.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Knox Overstreet.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Todd's brother was Jeffrey Anderson.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh yeah, sure. Valedictorian. National merit scholar.
speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: Oh well, welcome to Hell-ton.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It's every bit as tough as they say, unless you're a
dialog: genius like Meeks.
speaker_heading: MEEKS
text: He flatters me. That's why I help him with Latin.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: And English, and Trig.
text: Charlie begins coughing. There is a knock at the door. Charlie quickly
text: stamps out his cigarette on the floor and Neil tries to wave the smoke
text: from the air.
speaker_heading: NEIL
text: It's open.
text: The door opens and Mr. Perry walks into the room. Neil quickly rises from
text: the window.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Father, I thought you'd gone.
text: The other boys stand up when he enters.
speaker_heading: BOYS
dialog: Mr. Perry.
speaker_heading: MR PERRY
dialog: Keep your seats fellows, keep your seats. Neil, I've
dialog: just spoken to Mr. Nolan. I think that you're taking
dialog: too many extra curricular activities this semester, and
dialog: I've decided that you should drop the school annual.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: But I'm the assistant editor this year.
speaker_heading: MR PERRY
dialog: Well I'm sorry Neil.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: But Father, I can't. It wouldn't be fair.
speaker_heading: MR PERRY
dialog: Fellas, would you excuse us for a moment?
text: Mr. Perry walks towards the door and Neil hesitantly follows. Mr. Perry
text: pauses by the door and smiles to the other boys.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
text: The smile has gone from Mr. Perry's face. He grabs a hold of Neil's arm.
speaker_heading: MR PERRY
dialog: Don't you ever dispute me in public. Do you
dialog: understand?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Father, I wasn't disputing-
speaker_heading: MR PERRY
dialog: After you've finished medical school and you're on your own, then you
dialog: can do as you damn well please. But until then, you do as I tell you.
dialog: Is that clear?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Yes sir. I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: MR PERRY
dialog: You know how much this means to your mother,
dialog: don't you?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Yes sir. You know me, always taking on too much.
speaker_heading: MR PERRY
dialog: Well, that's my boy. Now listen, you need anything,
dialog: you let us know, huh?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Yes sir.
text: Mr. Perry slaps his son on the shoulder and leaves. Neil leans his head
text: back against the wall as the other boys emerge from the room.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Why doesn't he let you do what you want?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Yeah Neil, tell him off. It couldn't get any worse.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Oh, that's rich. Like you guys tell your parents off, Mr.
dialog: Future Lawyer and Mr. Future Banker.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Well just don't tell me how to talk to my father. You
dialog: guys are the same way.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: All right, all right, Jesus. So what are you going to do?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: What I have to do. Drop the annual.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Well I wouldn't lose much sleep over it. It's just a
text: bunch of jerks trying to impress Nolan.
speaker_heading: NEIL
text: I don't care. I don't give a damn about any of it.
speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: Well, uh, Latin, eight o' clock in my room?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: Todd, you're welcome to join us.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Yeah, come along pal.
text: Todd looks up from his desk where he is setting his alarm clock.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Thanks.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELDS - DAY
text: A clock bell chimes five o'clock. Enormous flocks of birds, apparently
text: disturbed by the noise, take to the sky.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRCASE - DAY
text: The sound of squawking birds merges into the sound of noisy boys as they
text: descend the stairs in a long spiralling line.
text: MR. MCALLISTER tries to make it upstairs against the steady stream.
speaker_heading: MCALLISTER
dialog: Slow down boys, slow down you horrible
text: phalanx of pubescense.
scene_heading: INT CHEMISTRY LAB - DAY
text: A teacher walks up and down the aisles, handing out books.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: Pick three laboratory experiments from
dialog: the project list and report on them every
dialog: five weeks. The first twenty questions at
dialog: the end of chapter one are due tomorrow.
text: The students let out a collective groan.
scene_heading: INT. LATIN CLASSROOM - DAY
text: Mr. McAllister paces back and forth in front of the blackboard and gets
text: the students to repeat everything he says.
speaker_heading: MCALLISTER
dialog: (students repeat after each word.)
dialog: Agricolam. Agricola. Agricolae.
dialog: Agricolarum. Agricolis. Agricolas.
dialog: Agrilcolis.
dialog: Again, please.
dialog: Agricola.
scene_heading: INT. MATH CLASSROOM - DAY
text: Dr. Hager walks up the classroom aisles with his arms behind his back.
speaker_heading: HAGER
dialog: Your study of trigonometry requires absolute precision.
dialog: Anyone failing to turn in any homework assignment will
dialog: be penalized one point off their final grade. Let me urge
dialog: you now not to test me on this point.
scene_heading: INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY
text: Students enter Keating's classroom, talking and acting up. Keating
text: glances out from his room off to one side.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Hey Spaz, Spaz.
text: Spaz turns around in time to be hit by a ball of crumpled up paper
text: while Cameron smacks him on the shoulder.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Brain damage.
text: The students quickly quiet down as Keating emerges from the other room,
text: whistling the 1812 Overture. He walks up the length of the classroom and
text: out the door without a word. The students look around at one another,
text: uncertain of what to do. Keating pokes his head back in the doorway.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Well come on.
text: He gestures them to follow and the students, after some hesitation, grab
text: their books and follow Keating out into the main entranceway.
scene_heading: INT. ENTRANCEWAY - DAY
text: Keating stands before the school's trophy cabinets and waits until all
text: the boys arrive.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: "Oh Captain, My Captain" who knows where
dialog: that comes from?
text: Todd looks up as if he knows the answer, but says nothing. Spaz blows his
text: nose a little too close to Meeks for his liking.
speaker_heading: KEATING
text: Not a clue? It's from a poem by Walt
dialog: Whitman about Mr. Abraham Lincoln. Now in
dialog: this class you can call me Mr. Keating. Or,
dialog: if you're slightly more daring, Oh Captain,
dialog: My Captain.
text: The students laugh slightly.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Now let me dispel a few rumors so they
dialog: don't fester into facts. Yes, I too
dialog: attended Hell-ton and survived. And no,
dialog: at that time I was not the mental giant
dialog: you see before you. I was the intellectual
dialog: equivalent of a ninety-eight pound
dialog: weakling. I would go to the beach and
dialog: people would kick copies of Byron in my
text: face.
text: The boys laugh once again, while Cameron, obviously trying to write all
text: this down, looks around confusedly. Keating looks down at papers in his
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Now, Mr Pitts. That's a rather
dialog: unfortunate name. Mr. Pitts, where are
dialog: you?
text: Pitts raises his hand while everyone around him snickers.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Mr. Pitts, would you open your hymnal to page 542 and read the first
dialog: stanza of the poem you find there?
speaker_heading: PITTS
dialog: "To the virgins, to make much of time"?
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Yes, that's the one. Somewhat appropriate,
dialog: isn't it.
speaker_heading: PITTS
dialog: "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, old
text: time is still a flying, and this same
dialog: flower that smiles today, tomorrow will
dialog: be dying."
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Thank you Mr. Pitts. "Gather ye rosebuds
dialog: while ye may." The Latin term for that
dialog: sentiment is Carpe Diem. Now who knows
dialog: what that means?
text: Meeks immediately puts his hand up.
speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: Carpe Diem. That's "seize the day."
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Very good, Mr.-
speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: Meeks.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Meeks. Another unusual name. Seize the
dialog: day. Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.
dialog: Why does the writer use these lines?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Because he's in a hurry.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: No, ding!
text: Keating slams his hand down on an imaginary buzzer.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Thank you for playing anyway. Because we
dialog: are food for worms lads. Because, believe
dialog: it or not, each and every one of us in
dialog: this room is one day going to stop
text: breathing, turn cold, and die.
text: Keating turns towards the trophy cases, filled with trophies, footballs,
dialog: and team pictures.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Now I would like you to step forward over
text: here and peruse some of the faces from
dialog: the past. You've walked past them many
dialog: times. I don't think you've really looked
text: at them.
text: The students slowly gather round the cases and Keating moves behind them.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: They're not that different from you, are
dialog: they? Same haircuts. Full of hormones,
dialog: just like you. Invincible, just like you
dialog: feel. The world is their oyster. They
dialog: believe they're destined for great things,
dialog: just like many of you. Their eyes are full
dialog: of hope, just like you. Did they wait until
dialog: it was too late to make from their lives
dialog: even one iota of what they were capable?
dialog: Because you see gentlmen, these boys are
text: now fertilizing daffodils. But if you listen
dialog: real close, you can hear them whisper their
dialog: legacy to you. Go on, lean in.
text: The boys lean in and Keating hovers over Cameron's shoulder.
speaker_heading: KEATING
text: (whispering in a gruff voice)
dialog: Carpe.
text: Cameron looks over his shoulder with an aggravated expression on his face.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Hear it?
dialog: (whispering again)
dialog: Carpe. Carpe Diem. Seize the day boys,
dialog: make your lives extraordinary.
text: The boys stare at the faces in the cabinet in silence.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL STEPS - DAY
text: The boys emerge from the school, loaded down with numerous books.
speaker_heading: PITTS
dialog: That was weird.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: But different.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Spooky if you ask me.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Think he'll test us on that stuff?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Come on Cameron, don't you get anything?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: What? What?
scene_heading: INT. LOCKER ROOM - EVENING
text: A coach sticks his head around the corner into the room.
speaker_heading: COACH
dialog: Let's go boys, hustle up in here. That
dialog: means you Dalton.
text: Meeks emerges from the showers, drying himself off.
speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: Okay, who's up for a trig study group
dialog: tonight guys?
speaker_heading: PITTS
dialog: Me.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Me.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (still annoyed by what the coach said)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: I can't make it guys. I have to have
text: dinner at the Danburry's house.
speaker_heading: PITTS
dialog: The Danburry's? Who are the Danburry's?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Big alumns. How'd you swing that?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Friends of my Dad's. They're probably in
dialog: their nineties or something.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Ooh!
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Anything's better than Hell-ton hash.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'll second that.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Yeah we'll see.
text: Neil approaches Todd, who's been sitting by the window staring down at the
text: floor. Neil snaps his fingers to get Todd's attention.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Hey, you coming to the study group tonight?
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Uh, no, no I, uh, I've got some history I
dialog: wanna do.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Suit yourself.
scene_heading: INT. TODD'S ROOM - EVENING
text: Todd is seated at his desk. He scrawls "CARPE DIEM" across a blank page
text: of his notebook. He looks at it for a few moments before crumpling it up
text: and opening up his Chemistry book.
scene_heading: INT. ENTRANCEWAY - NIGHT
text: Hager comes down the stairs. Knox is looking at one of the old class photos
text: on the walls.
speaker_heading: HAGER

speaker_heading: CHET (O.S.)
dialog: I can't, Mom.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (O.S.)

text: The door opens and Knox is awe-struck by the beautiful girl (CHRIS) who
text: has answered the door.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Can I help you?
text: Knox manages to break out of his daze.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Hi. Knox Overstreet. Uh, Dr. Hager.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: This is the Danburry's, right?
speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: KNOX

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: MRS DANBURRY
dialog: Sorry. Thank you Chris. I'm Mrs. Danburry.
dialog: You must be Knox.
speaker_heading: KNOX

speaker_heading: CHET (O.S.)

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Chet, I'm coming.
text: Knox enters the house, his mind still hung up on Chris as MR DANBURRY
text: comes out of the living room to meet him.
speaker_heading: MR DANBURRY
dialog: Knox. How are you? Joe Danburry.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Nice to meet you sir.
speaker_heading: MR DANBURRY

scene_heading: INT. STUDENT LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: Several students are throwing darts at a small rubber skeleton hanging
text: from the bulletin board. Various students are studying and playing games.
text: Meeks and Pitts are sitting at one table working on their "hi-fi system".
text: Meeks is waving an antenna around with no luck. Pitts points out to him
text: that he forgot to plug it in. Neil, Cameron, and Charlie are working on
dialog: their trig homework.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Just replace these numbers here with "x",
dialog: for "x" and "y".
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Of course, so what's the problem?
text: Charlie enters the room and closes the door behind him, leaning up
text: against it heavily.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: How was dinner?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: How was dinner?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Terrible. Awful.
text: He leaves the door and sits down with the other boys.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Why? What happened?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Tonight, I met the most beautiful girl
dialog: in my entire life.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
speaker_heading: KNOX
text: She's practically engaged. To Chet Danburry.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That guy could eat a football.
speaker_heading: PITTS
dialog: That's too bad.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Too bad? It's worse than too bad Pitsie,
dialog: it's a tragedy. A girl this beautiful in
dialog: love with such a jerk.
speaker_heading: PITTS
dialog: All the good ones go for jerks, you
dialog: know that.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Ahh, forget her. Open your trig book and
dialog: try and figure out problem five.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: I can't just forget her Cameron. And I
dialog: can't think about trig.
text: The radio Meeks and Pitts were working on begins letting out a high

speaker_heading: PITTS

speaker_heading: HAGER

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Did you see her naked?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Very funny Dalton.

dialog: That wouldn't be a radio in your lap,
dialog: would it Mr. Pitts?
speaker_heading: PITTS
dialog: No sir. Science experiment, radar.
text: Meeks holds up the antenna as if demonstrating it.
scene_heading: INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY
text: Keating sits at his desk at the front of the classroom and opens up one
dialog: of his books.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Gentlemen, open your text to page
dialog: twenty-one of the introduction. Mr.
dialog: Perry, will you read the opening
dialog: paragraph of the preface, entitled
dialog: "Understanding Poetry"?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Understanding Poetry, by Dr. J. Evans
dialog: Pritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand
dialog: poetry, we must first be fluent with
text: its meter, rhyme, and figures of speech.
dialog: Then ask two questions: One, how artfully
dialog: has the objective of the poem been
dialog: rendered, and two, how important is that
text: objective. Question one rates the poem's
dialog: perfection, question two rates its
dialog: importance. And once these questions have
dialog: been answered, determining a poem's
dialog: greatest becomes a relatively simple
dialog: matter.
text: Keating gets up from his desk and prepares to draw on the chalk board.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: If the poem's score for perfection is
text: plotted along the horizontal of a graph,
dialog: and its importance is plotted on the
text: vertical, then calculating the total
text: area of the poem yields the measure of
dialog: its greatness.
text: Keating draws a corresponding graph on the board and the students
text: dutifully copy it down.
speaker_heading: NEIL
text: A sonnet by Byron may score high on the
dialog: vertical, but only average on the
text: horizontal. A Shakespearean sonnet, on
dialog: the other hand, would score high both
text: horizontally and vertically, yielding a
text: massive total area, thereby revealing the
dialog: poem to be truly great. As you proceed
dialog: through the poetry in this book, practice
dialog: this rating method. As your ability to
dialog: evaluate poems in this matter grows, so
dialog: will - so will your enjoyment and
dialog: understanding of poetry.
text: Neil sets the book down and takes off his glasses. The student sitting
text: across from him is discretely trying to eat. Keating turns away from
text: the chalkboard with a smile.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Excrement. That's what I think of Mr. J.
dialog: Evans Pritchard. We're not laying pipe,
dialog: we're talking about poetry.
text: Cameron looks down at the graph he copied into his notes and quickly
text: scribbles it out.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: I mean, how can you describe poetry like
dialog: American Bandstand? I like Byron, I give
dialog: him a 42, but I can't dance to it.
text: Charlie suddenly appear to become interested in the class.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Now I want you to rip out that page.
text: The students look at Keating as if he has just gone mad.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Go on, rip out the entire page. You heard
dialog: me, rip it out. Rip it out!
text: Charlie looks around at the others. He then looks down at his own notes,
text: which consists of drawing breasts.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Go on, rip it out.
text: Charlie rips the page out and holds it up.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Thank you Mr. Dalton. Gentlemen, tell you
dialog: what, don't just tear out that page, tear
dialog: out the entire introduction. I want it
dialog: gone, history. Leave nothing of it. Rip
text: it out. Rip! Begone J. Evans Pritchard,
text: Ph.D. Rip, shred, tear. Rip it out. I
dialog: want to hear nothing but ripping of Mr.
dialog: Pritchard.
text: Meeks looks around reluctantly and then finally begins tearing out pages.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: We'll perforate it, put it on a roll.
text: Keating sees Cameron still hesitating.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: It's not the bible, you're not going to
dialog: go to hell for this. Go on, make a clean
dialog: tear, I want nothing left of it.
text: Keating goes over to his room. Cameron turns around to Neil.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: We shouldn't be doing this.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Rip, rip, rip!
text: Neil makes Cameron turn back around.
speaker_heading: KEATING (O.S.)
dialog: Rip it out, rip!
text: From outside the classroom, Mr. McAllister hears all the noise and sees
text: all the students ripping out the pages. He bursts into the room.
speaker_heading: MCALLISTER
dialog: What the hell is going on here?
text: The boys all turn around in shock. Charlie stuffs a crumpled page into his
text: mouth. Keating emerges from his room with a waste paper basket.
speaker_heading: KEATING
text: I don't hear enough rips.
speaker_heading: MCALLISTER
dialog: Mr. Keating.
speaker_heading: KEATING
text: Mr. McAllister.
speaker_heading: MCALLISTER
dialog: I'm sorry, I- I didn't know you were
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: I am.
speaker_heading: MCALLISTER
dialog: Ahh, so you are. Excuse me.
text: Mr. McAllister slowly backs out of the classroom.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Keep ripping gentlemen. This is a battle,
dialog: a war. And the casualties could be your
dialog: hearts and souls.
text: Keating holds out the basket to Charlie who spits out a wad of paper.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Thank you Mr. Dalton. Armies of academics
dialog: going forward, measuring poetry. No, we
dialog: will not have that here. No more of Mr.
dialog: J. Evans Pritchard. Now in my class you
dialog: will learn to think for yourselves again.
dialog: You will learn to savor words and language.
dialog: No matter what anybody tells you, words and
dialog: ideas can change the world. I see that look
text: in Mr. Pitt's eye, like nineteenth century
dialog: literature has nothing to do with going to
dialog: business school or medical school. Right?
dialog: Maybe. Mr. Hopkins, you may agree with him,
dialog: thinking "Yes, we should simply study our
dialog: Mr. Pritchard and learn our rhyme and meter
dialog: and go quietly about the business of
dialog: achieving other ambitions." I have a little
dialog: secret for ya. Huddle up. Huddle up!
text: The boys get up from their seats and gather around Keating in the center
dialog: of the class.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: We don't read and write poetry because
dialog: it's cute. We read and write poetry
dialog: because we are members of the human race.
text: And the human race is filled with passion.
dialog: Medicine, law, business, engineering,
dialog: these are all noble pursuits, and necessary
dialog: to sustain life. But poetry, beauty,
dialog: romance, love, these are what we stay alive
dialog: for. To quote from Whitman: "O me, o life
dialog: of the questions of these recurring, of the
text: endless trains of the faithless, of cities
dialog: filled with the foolish. What good amid
dialog: these, o me, o life? Answer: that you are
dialog: here. That life exists, and identity.
dialog: That the powerful play goes on, and you
dialog: may contribute a verse. That the powerful
dialog: play goes on and you may contribute a verse.
text: Keating looks up at Todd.
dialog: Keating
dialog: What will your verse be?
scene_heading: INT. HEAD OF CAFETERIA - DAY
text: The cafeteria is filled with students and teachers standing before the tables saying grace.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: For what we are about to receive, may the
dialog: Lord make us truly grateful. Amen.
text: Mr. Keating and Mr. McAllister are seated next to one another at the table.
speaker_heading: MCALLISTER
dialog: Quite an interesting class you gave today,
dialog: Mr. Keating.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: I'm sorry if I shocked you, Mr. McAllister.
speaker_heading: MCALLISTER
dialog: Oh, there's no need to apologize. It was
text: very fascinating, misguided though it was.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: You think so?
speaker_heading: MCALLISTER
dialog: You take a big risk by encouraging them to
text: be artists John. When they realize they're
dialog: not Rembrandts, Shakespeares or Mozarts,
dialog: they'll hate you for it.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: We're not talking artists George, we're
text: talking free thinkers.
speaker_heading: MCALLISTER
dialog: Free thinkers at seventeen?
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Funny, I never pegged you as a cynic.
speaker_heading: MCALLISTER
dialog: (taken aback by the comment)
dialog: Not a cynic, a realist. Show me the heart
dialog: unfettered by foolish dreams, and I'll
dialog: show you a happy man.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: But only in their dreams can man be truly
dialog: free. 'Twas always thus, and always thus
dialog: will be.
speaker_heading: MCALLISTER
dialog: Tennyson?
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: No, Keating.
text: Keating winks and Mr. McAllister can't help but laugh.
scene_heading: INT. CAFETERIA TABLE - DAY
text: Neil joins the others at the table. He pulls out a yearbook.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Hey, I found his senior annual in the
dialog: library.
text: He hands the annual over to Cameron who laughs at the younger picture of Keating.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Listen to this, captain of the soccer team,
dialog: editor of the school annual, Cambridge
text: bound, Thigh man, and the Dead Poets Society.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: (reading from the annual)
dialog: Man most likely to do anything.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Thigh man. Mr. K was a hell-raiser.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: What's the Dead Poets Society?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: Is there a picture in the annual?
speaker_heading: NEIL
text: Nothing. No other mention of it.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN (O.S.)
dialog: That boy there, see me after lunch.
text: Cameron quickly puts the annual away and the others all return to their meal.
scene_heading: EXT. WELTON GROUNDS - DAY
text: Keating is walking down towards the lake, whistling the same tune as before.
text: The boys emerge from the building and chase after him.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Mr. Keating? Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain,
dialog: My Captain?
text: Keating immediately turns around.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Gentlemen.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: We were just looking in your old annual.
text: He hands Keating the annual and Keating looks at his old photograph.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Oh my God. No, that's not me. Stanley
dialog: "The Tool" Wilson-
text: Keating crouches down and continues looking through the book.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: God.
text: Neil crouches down next to Keating.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: What was the Dead Poets Society?
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: I doubt the present administration would
dialog: look too favorably upon that.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Why? What was it?
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Gentlemen, can you keep a secret?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Sure.
text: The other boys crouch down around Keating.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: The Dead Poets were dedicated to sucking
dialog: the marrow out of life. That's a phrase
dialog: from Thoreau that we'd invoke at the
dialog: beginning of each meeting. You see we'd
text: gather at the old Indian cave and take
text: turns reading from Thoreau, Whitman,
dialog: Shelley; the biggies. Even some of our
text: own verse. And in the enchantment of the
dialog: moment we'd let poetry work its magic.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: You mean it was a bunch of guys sitting
dialog: around reading poetry?
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: No Mr. Overstreet, it wasn't just "guys",
dialog: we weren't a Greek organization, we were
dialog: romantics. We didn't just read poetry,
text: we let it drip from our tongues like honey.
dialog: Spirits soared, women swooned, and gods
dialog: were created, gentlemen, not a bad way to
dialog: spend an evening eh? Thank you Mr. Perry
dialog: for this trip down amnesia lane. Burn that,
dialog: especially my picture.
text: Keating hands the annual back and walks away, whistling once again. Neil
text: remains crouched.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Dead Poets Society.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: What?
text: The school bells begin ringing and everyone heads back towards the school.
text: Neil stands up.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: I say we go tonight.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Tonight?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Wait a minute.
speaker_heading: PITTS
dialog: Where's this cave he's talking about?
speaker_heading: NEIL
text: It's beyond the stream. I know where it
dialog: is.
speaker_heading: PITTS
dialog: That's miles.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Sounds boring to me.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Don't go.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: You know how many de-merits we're talking
dialog: Dalton
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So don't come, please.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Look, all I'm saying is that we have to
dialog: be careful, we can't get caught.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No shit, Sherlock.
speaker_heading: HAGER
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: You boys there, hurry up.
text: Neil turns around and faces the other boys.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: All right, who's in?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Come on Neil, Hager's right-
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Forget Hager, no. Who's in?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm in.
speaker_heading: HAGER (O.S.)
dialog: I'm warning you, move.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: PITTS
dialog: I don't know Neil
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: What? Pitts-
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Pitsie, come on.
speaker_heading: MEEKS
text: His grades are hurting Charlie.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: You can help him Meeks.
speaker_heading: PITTS
dialog: What is this, a midnight study group?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Forget it Pitts, you're coming. Meeks,
dialog: are your grades hurting too?
speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: I'll try anything once.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Except sex.
speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: Ha ha ha.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: I mean as long as we're careful.
text: The boys run into the building.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What about you Knox?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: I don't know Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Come on Knox, it'll help you get Chris.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Yeah? How?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Women swoon.
text: Charlie laughs and runs inside. Knox chases after him.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: But why do they swoon? Charlie, tell me
dialog: why they swoon. Charlie!
scene_heading: INT LIBRARY - DAY
text: The boys are all gathered around one of the tables with a map laid out
text: on it.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Okay, follow the stream to the waterfall.
text: It's right there. It's got to be on the
dialog: banks.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: I don't know, it's starting to sound
dialog: dangerous.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Well, why don't you stay home?
speaker_heading: MCALLISTER
dialog: For God's sake stop chattering and
dialog: sit down.
text: The boys take their seats once again and Neil goes over and sits next to
text: Todd, who is sitting by himself.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Todd, are you coming tonight?
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Why not? God, you were there. You heard
dialog: Keating. Don't you want to do something
dialog: about it?
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Yes, but-
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: But? But what?
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Keating said that everybody took turns
dialog: reading and I don't want to do that.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Gosh, you really have a problem with
dialog: that, don't you?
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: N- no, I don't have a problem. Neil,
dialog: I just- I just don't want to do it,
dialog: okay?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: All right. What if you didn't have to
dialog: read? What if you just came and
dialog: listened?
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: That's not how it works.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Forget how it works. What if - what if
dialog: they said it was okay?
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: What? What are you gonna do, go up and
dialog: ask them?
text: Neil shrugs.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: No. No, Neil.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: I'll be right back.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Neil, Neil!
text: Neil gets up and rejoins the others. McAllister hears the boys whispering
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: MCALLISTER
dialog: Oh shut up, will you.
scene_heading: INT BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Various boys are crowded around the sinks getting ready for bed. Someone
text: is playing snake charmer music on a kazoo while someone else is bothering
text: Spaz with a red sock puppet acting like a snake.
speaker_heading: SPAZ
dialog: That's my- that's for my asthma, okay.
dialog: Could you give that back please? Could
dialog: you give that back?
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: What's the matter? Don't you like snakes?
text: Neil enters and taps Todd on the shoulder.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: You're in.
speaker_heading: SPAZ
dialog: Get away from me, okay?
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Spaz, why don't you check your pocket,
dialog: huh? Come on Spaz I have to brush my
dialog: teeth
speaker_heading: SPAZ
dialog: Get a- get off,
text: Hager walks past the bathroom and into his room.
speaker_heading: HAGER
dialog: Cut out that racket in there.
text: The kazoo player lets out a rude squeek before finally stopping. Hager
text: glares at them for a moment.
scene_heading: INT NEIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Neil stands in his doorway. He looks across the hall to the other room
text: where Cameron and Charlie are standing. Cameron gives a thumbs up. Neil
text: closes his room door and takes out his cloak and a flashlight. Setting
text: the flashlight down on the desk, he notices a worn book, "Five
text: Centuries of Verse", sitting there. Opening it up, he sees John Keating's
text: name at the top followed by "Dead Poets". Below the title of the book,
text: is written: "To Be Read At The Opening of D.P.S. Meetings." Along with
text: several lines from Thoreau, beginning with "I went to the woods because
dialog: I wanted to live deliberately"
scene_heading: INT STAIRWAY - NIGHT
text: The shadows of hooded figures can be seen moving throughout the darkened
dialog: halls.
scene_heading: INT HAGER'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Hager hears a dog barking.
scene_heading: INT HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Someone drops a number of dog biscuits by the dog's feet. He stops
text: barking and immediately begins gobbling them down. Hager looks out
text: into the hallway with his flashlight but sees nothing.
scene_heading: EXT SCHOOL GROUNDS - NIGHT
text: The boys quietly leave the building and set off running across the
text: fields towards the woods.
scene_heading: EXT WOODS - NIGHT
text: The boys search about the trees trying to find the cave. Meeks is
text: searching around when Charlie leaps up behind Meeks in the dark
text: shining the flashlight up at his own face and grabs Meeks by the
dialog: shoulder.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Arrr, I'm a dead poet.
speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: Aww, Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Guys, over here.
speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: You're funny. You're real funny.
scene_heading: INT CAVE - NIGHT
text: The boys are trying to start a fire. The cave is quickly filling up with
dialog: smoke.
speaker_heading: MEEKS
text: It's too wet.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: God, are you trying to smoke us out of
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: No, no, the smoke's going right up this
dialog: opening.
text: Pitts tries to stand up and slams his head into the low rock ceiling. He
text: lets out a yell while the others laugh.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: PITTS
dialog: Oh God. Clowns.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: All right, all right, forget the fire.
dialog: Let's go gentlemen.
text: Neil stands before the others with the book in hand, and takes a drag
text: on a cigarette.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: I hereby reconvene the Dead Poets
dialog: Society.
text: The boys cheer.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Welton chapter. The meetings will be
dialog: conducted by myself and the other new
text: initiates now present. Todd Anderson,
dialog: because he prefers not to read, will
dialog: keep minutes of the meetings. I'll now
text: read the traditional opening message by
dialog: society member Henry David Thoreau. "I
dialog: went to the woods because I wanted to
dialog: live deliberately. I wanted to live deep
dialog: and suck out all the marrow of life."
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'll second that.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: "To put to rout all that was not life,
dialog: and not, when I had come to die,
dialog: discover that I had not lived.
text: Several boys whistle softly in reaction to the poem.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: And Keating's marked a bunch of other
dialog: pages.
text: Neil begins flipping through the book.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: All right, intermission. Dig deep right
dialog: here. Right here, lay it down
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: On the mud? We're gonna put our food on
dialog: the mud?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Meeks, put your coat down. Picnic blanket.
speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: Yes sir, use Meeks' coat.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Don't keep anything back either. You
dialog: guys are always bumming my smokes.
text: Meeks lays his coat down and everyone dumps their food on it. Amongst
text: the pile are chocolate chip cookies, a box of raisins, a few apples, an
text: orange, and half a roll.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Raisins?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Yuck.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Wait a minute, who gave us half a roll?
speaker_heading: PITTS
dialog: (talking with his mouth full)
dialog: I'm eating the other half.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Come on.
speaker_heading: PITTS
dialog: You want me to put it back?
scene_heading: INT CAVE - NIGHT
text: Neil, lit up by a flashlight, begins to tell everyone a story.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: It was a dark and rainy night, and this
dialog: old lady, who had a passion for jigsaw
text: puzzles, sat by herself in her house at
text: her table to complete a new jigsaw puzzle.
text: But as she pieced the puzzle together, she
dialog: realized, to her astonishment, that the
dialog: image that was formed was her very own
text: room. And the figure in the center of the
text: puzzle, as she completed it, was herself.
text: And with trembling hands, she placed the
text: last four pieces and stared in horror at
text: the face of a demented madman at the
dialog: window. The last thing that this old lady
text: ever heard was the sound of breaking glass.
speaker_heading: BOYS
dialog: Ohhh no
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: This is true, this is true.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: I've got one that's even better than
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Ha!
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: I do. There's a young, married couple,
text: and they're driving through the forest
text: at night on a long trip. And they run
text: out of gas, and there's a madman on the-
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: The thing with the hand-
text: All the boys react, recalling the story and miming the scraping on the
text: roof of the car.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: I love that story.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I told you that one.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: You did not. I got that in camp in
dialog: sixth grade.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: When were you in six, last year?
text: As everyone's voices begin to calm down, Pitts begins reading from the
dialog: book.
speaker_heading: PITTS
text: "In a mean abode in the shanking road,
dialog: lived a man named William Bloat. Now,
dialog: he had a wife, the plague of his life,
dialog: who continually got his goat. And one
text: day at dawn, with her nightshift on,
dialog: he slit her bloody throat."
text: The boys laugh.
speaker_heading: PITTS
dialog: Oh, and it gets worse.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You want to hear a real poem?
text: Meeks hands Charlie the book but he shoves it away.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: All right? No, I don't need it. You take
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: What, did you bring one?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: You memorized a poem?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I didn't memorize a poem. Move up.
text: Neil moves to the side as Charlie stands and takes his spot.
speaker_heading: MEEKS
text: An original piece by Charlie Dalton.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: An original piece.
speaker_heading: PITTS
text: Take center stage.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: You know this is history. Right? This is
dialog: history.
text: Charlie clears his throat and pulls out a page from a magazine and
text: slowly unfolds it, revealing a Playboy centerfold (Elaine Reynolds,
dialog: Miss October, 1959)
speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: Oh, wow.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Where did you get that?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Teach me to love? Go teach thyself more
dialog: wit.
dialog: I, chief professor, am of it.
text: Neil gets up and looks over Charlie's shoulder to see what he is
dialog: reading.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: The god of love, if such a thing there
dialog: be, may learn to love from me.
text: Charlie winks at the guys and they clap and cheer.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Wow! Did you write that?
text: Charlie turns over the centerfold to show where he had written down
dialog: the poem.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Abraham Cowley. Okay, who's next?
text: Neil sits reading from the book by flashlight.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Alfred Lord Tennyson.
dialog: Come my friends,
dialog: 'Tis not too late to seek a newer world
dialog: for my purpose holds to sail beyond the
dialog: sunset.
dialog: And though we are not now that strength
dialog: which in old days
dialog: Moved earth and heaven; that which we

dialog: One equal temper of heroic hearts,
text: Made weak by time and fate, but strong
dialog: in will.
dialog: To strive, to seek, to find, and not to
dialog: yield.
text: Meeks takes center stage and begins reading a poem like he is
text: performing a chant.
speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: Then I had religion, then I had a
dialog: vision.
dialog: I could not turn from their revel in
dialog: derision.
dialog: Then I saw the Congo creeping through

dialog: Then I saw the Congo creeping through

scene_heading: INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY
text: Keating is walking to the front of the classroom filled with students.
speaker_heading: KEATING
text: A man is not very tire, he is exhausted.
dialog: And don't use very sad, use-
text: He points to the back of the classroom.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Come on, Mr. Overstreet, you twerp,
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Morose?
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Exactly! Morose. Now, language was
dialog: developed for one endeavor, and that is?
dialog: Mr. Anderson? Come on! Are you a man or
dialog: an amoeba?
text: Keating stands before Todd's desk. Todd looks up nervously but
text: says nothing. Keating paused for a moment before looking away.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Mr. Perry?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Uh, to communicate.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: No! To woo women. Today we're going to
dialog: be talking about William Shakespeare.
text: The class lets out a collective sigh.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Oh, God!
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: I know. A lot of you looked forward to
dialog: this about as much as you look forward
dialog: to root canal work. We're gonna talk
dialog: about Shakespeare as someone who writes
dialog: something very interesting. Now, many of
dialog: you have seen Shakespeare done very much
dialog: like this:
text: Keating holds out his right arm dramtically and begins to
text: speak in an exaggerated British accent.
dialog: "O Titus, bring your friend hither." But
dialog: if any of you have seen Mr. Marlon Brando,
dialog: you know, Shakespeare can be different.
dialog: "Friend, Romans, countrymen, lend me your
dialog: ears." You can also imagine, maybe, John
dialog: Wayne as Macbeth going, "Well, is this a
dialog: dagger I see before me?"
scene_heading: INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY
text: The students are all seated together near the front of the room as
text: Keating reads from a book.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: "Dogs, sir? Oh, not just now. I do enjoy
dialog: a good dog once in a while, sir. You can
dialog: have yourself a three-course meal from
dialog: one dog. Start with your canine
dialog: crudites, go to your Fido flambe for
text: main course and for dessert, a Pekingese
dialog: parfait. And you can pick your teeth
dialog: with a little paw."
scene_heading: INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY
text: The students are all back in their normal seats and Keating leaps
text: up onto his desk.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Why do I stand up here? Anybody?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: To feel taller.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: No!
text: Keating rings the bell on his desk with his foot
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Thank you for playing, Mr. Dalton. I
dialog: stand upon my desk to remind yourself
dialog: that we must constantly look at things
text: in a different way.
text: Keating glances around the classroom from atop the desk.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: You see, the world looks very different
dialog: from up here. You don't believe me? Come
dialog: see for yourself. Come on. Come on!
text: Charlie and Neil quickly rise from their seats to go to the front
text: of the classroom. The rest of the class follows them. While Keating
text: continues speaking, Neil and Charlie join him on the desk and then
text: Keating jumps down.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Just when you think you know something,
dialog: you have to look at it in another way.
dialog: Even though it may seem silly or wrong,
dialog: you must try! Now, when you read, don't
dialog: just consider what the author thinks.
dialog: Consider what you think.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Boys, you must strive to find your own
dialog: voice. Because the longer you wait to
dialog: begin, the less likely you are to find
dialog: it at all. Thoreau said, "Most men lead
dialog: lives of quiet desperation." Don't be
dialog: resigned to that. Break out!
text: Keating notices Spaz and another boy leaving the desk immediately.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Don't just walk off the edge like lemmings.
dialog: Look around you.
text: The school bell rings as the boys continue to climb onto the desk.
text: Keating begins to gather up his stuff. The clock begins to toll as
text: Keating walks to the back of the class.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: There! There you go, Mr. Priske. Thank
dialog: you! Yes! Dare to strike out and find
dialog: new ground. Now, in addition to your
dialog: essays, I would like you to compose a
dialog: poem of your own, an original work.
text: The students begin to groan. Keating begins flickering the lights
text: off and on while chanting ominously.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: That's right! You have to deliver it
text: aloud in front of the class on Monday.
dialog: Bonne chance, gentlemen.
text: Keating steps out into the hall before quickly peeking back in once again.
text: Todd is the last one to stand on the desk and is about to jump off.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Mr. Anderson? Don't think that I don't
dialog: know that this assignment scares the
dialog: hell out of you, you mole.
text: Keating flicks the light off, leaving Todd to jump down in the darkness

scene_heading: INT. TODD'S ROOM - DAY
text: Todd is on his bed trying to write a poem. The door opens and Todd
text: turns his writing pad over. Neil enters the room laughing. He crouches
text: down next to Todd's bed and plunks a sheet of paper in Todd's lap.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: I found it.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: You found what?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: What I wanna do right now. What's
dialog: really, really inside me.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: "A Midsummer Night's Dream"?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: This is it.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: It's a play, dummy.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: I know that. I-- Wh-Wh-What does it have
dialog: to do with you?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Right. They're putting it on at Henley
dialog: Hall. Open tryouts. Open tryouts!
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Yes, so?
text: Neil pounds on the bed and then pulls a blanket off his bed,
text: wearing it like a cloak.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: So, I'm gonna act. Yes, yes! I'm gonna
dialog: be an actor! Ever since I can remember,
dialog: I've wanted to try this. I even tried to
dialog: go to summer stock auditions last year,
dialog: but, of course, my father wouldn't let
dialog: me. For the first time in my whole life
dialog: I know what I wanna do.
text: Neil grabs a handful of papers off Todd's bed and tosses them into
dialog: the air.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: and for the first time I'm gonna do it
dialog: whether my father wants me to or not!
dialog: Carpe diem!
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Neil, Neil, hold on a minute. How are
dialog: you gonna be in a play if your father
dialog: won't let you?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: First I gotta get the part, then I can
dialog: worry about that.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Yeah, but won't he kill you if he finds
dialog: out you went to an audition and didn't
dialog: even tell him?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: No, no, no, no. As far as I'm concerned,
dialog: he won't have to know about any of this.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Well, that's impossible.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Bullshit! Nothing's impossible.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Well, why don't you just call him and
dialog: ask him? And m-maybe he'll say yes.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: That's a laugh!
text: Neil tosses the blanket back onto his bed.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: If I don't ask him, at least I won't
text: be disobeying him.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Yeah, but if he said--
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: (shouting angrily)
dialog: Jesus, Todd! Whose side are you on?
text: Todd says nothing. Neil looks at him for a moment and then takes
text: the flyer back from Todd. He walks over to the window, his
text: excitement gone.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: I mean, I haven't even gotten the part
dialog: yet. Can't I even enjoy the idea for a
dialog: little while?
text: Once again, Todd says nothing. After a moment, Neil sits on the
text: heater and Todd returns to his poem.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: You're coming to the meeting this
dialog: afternoon?
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: I don't know. Maybe.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Nothing Mr. Keating has to say means
dialog: shit to you, does it, Todd?
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: W-What is that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: You're in the club! Being in the club
dialog: means being stirred up by things. You
text: look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
text: Neil gets up from the window and stands over Todd.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: So- You want me out?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: No! I want you in, but being in means
dialog: you gotta do something. Not just say
dialog: you're in.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Well, listen, Neil. I-I appreciate this
dialog: concern, but I-I'm not like you. All
dialog: right? You, you, you say thing and
dialog: people listen. I'm, I'm not like that.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Don't you think you could be?
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: No! I--I, I don't know, but that's not
dialog: the point. The, the, the point is that
dialog: there's nothing you can do about it, so
dialog: you can just butt out. I can take care
dialog: of myself just fine. All right?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: What do you mean, "no"?
text: A smile comes to Neil's face.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: No.
text: Neil grabs Todd's notebook of poetry and runs across the room with
text: it. Todd leaps up after him.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Give me-- Neil. Neil, give that back.
text: The two begin racing in circles around the room, jumping from
text: bed to bed as Todd tries to grab his poem back.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: "We are dreaming of a--" Poetry! I'm
dialog: being chased by Walt Whitman! Okay,
dialog: okay.
text: Neil drops the notebook. Cameron walks into the room.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: What are you guys doing? I'm sure-- You
dialog: see this chemistry-
text: Cameron tries to hold up his book and Neil snatches it from his hands and
text: suddenly all three of them are racing around the room.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Hey, give me-- Neil, give me-- Don't be
dialog: immature. Come on. I need my-
text: Charlie enters the room and begins waving his hands.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Give it to me! Give it to me!
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Charlie!
text: Neil tosses Cameron's book to Charlie.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Let me have my book, I need my-
text: The four boys continue racing around the cramped quarters, tossing
text: Cameron's book back and forth. Neil picks up a recorder and begins
text: blowing erratic notes on it while Charlie starts pounding on a set of
text: bongo drums. Outside the room a crowd of boys watch.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPUS ENTRANCE - DAY
text: Knox is riding his bike around in circles near the entrance. Seeing no
text: one nearby, he races through the open gates and down the road. He comes
text: to the top of a hill and then goes downhill across the grass, shouting
text: as he sends an immense flock of geese flying into the air.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
text: A number of vehicles drive up, filled with students dressed in bright red
text: cosyumes, playing trumpets and various other instruments as they pass.
text: Knox watches the growing crowd of students. They are all converging on
text: a bus. A football player, wearing a horned helmet, dances on the roof of
text: the bus. A band is playing while a group of cheerleaders are practising.
text: Knox spots Chris amongst the cheerleaders. He watches her until Chet
text: comes along and she grabs hold of his hand. Knox looks away in disgust.
speaker_heading: COACH
dialog: Okay, everybody on the bus. Let's go,
dialog: boys. Come on, let's go. On the bus,
dialog: boys. Now!
text: Chris jumps into Chet's arms as everyone begins to board the buses. Knox
text: turns his bike around and leaves.
scene_heading: EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY
text: Keating walks across the field, followed by his students. He kicks a ball
text: ahead of him while he carries a number of other balls in a net slung over
text: his shoulder.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Now, devotees may argue that one sport
dialog: or game is inherently better than
dialog: another. For me, sport is actually a
dialog: chance for us to have other human beings
dialog: push us to excel. I want you all to come
dialog: over here and take a slip of paper and
text: line up single file.
text: Keating reaches the stands. He tosses the balls aside and pulls sets
text: his briefcase down. As the boys line up he begins ripping off slips
text: of paper from a notepad and handing them out.
speaker_heading: KEATING
text: Mr. Meeks, time to inherit the earth.
dialog: Mr. Pitts, rise above your name.
text: He hands the notepad to another student.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: I want you to hand these out to the boys,
dialog: one apiece.
scene_heading: EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY
text: The students are all lined up in single file, each holding a slip
text: of paper. Keating blows his whistle.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: You know what to do, Pitts.

speaker_heading: PITTS
dialog: "Oh to struggle against great odds. To

speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Now go on.
text: Pitts gives one of the soccer balls a good kick.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Yes! Next.

speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Next. Louder!
speaker_heading: BOY 2

text: Keating walks away and starts up a record player.
speaker_heading: BOY 3
dialog: "To mount the scaffolds. To advance to

text: Classical music begins playing on the phonograph. Meeks goes to

speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Come on, Meeks! Listen to the music.
speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: "To dance, clap hands, exalt, shout,

speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: HOPKINS
dialog: (without energy)
dialog: "Oh, to have life henceforth the poem of
dialog: new joys."
text: Hopkins crumples up his paper and then barely taps the soccer
text: ball with his foot.
text: Keating puts a look of disgust on his face.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Oh! Boo! Come on, Charlie, let it fill
dialog: your soul!
text: Charlie raises his hands over his head.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: "To indeed be a god!"
scene_heading: INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY
text: Neil is racing down the hallway, all excited.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Charlie, I got the part! I'm gonna play

text: He pounds on Charlie's door.
speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: What did he say?
speaker_heading: PITTS
dialog: Puck?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: That's the main part.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Great, Neil.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Charlie, I got it!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Congratulations. Good for you, Neil.
dialog: Good for you.
text: Neil enters his room with Todd and sits down at his typewriter.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Okay, okay, okay, okay.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Neil, how are you gonna do this?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: They need a letter of permission from my
dialog: father and Mr. Nolan.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: You're not gonna write it.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Oh yes, I am.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Oh, Neil. Neil, you're crazy.
text: Neil begins typing.
speaker_heading: NEIL

speaker_heading: KNOX

speaker_heading: BOY 1
dialog: Who's Chris?
speaker_heading: BOY 2
dialog: Mmm, Chris.
speaker_heading: KNOX
text: I see a sweetness in her smile.
text: Blight light shines from her eyes.
dialog: But life is complete; contentment is
dialog: mine,
dialog: Just knowing that...
text: Several students begin to snicker.
speaker_heading: KNOX
text: just knowing that she's alive.
text: Knox crumples his poem and walks back to his desk.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Sorry, Captain. It's stupid.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: No, no. It's not stupid. It's a good
text: effort. It touched on one of the major
text: themes, love. A major theme not only in
dialog: poetry, but life. Mr. Hopkins, you were
dialog: laughing. You're up.
text: Hopkins slowly walks to the front of the class and unfolds
text: his piece of paper.
speaker_heading: HOPKINS
text: "The cat sat on the mat."
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Congratulations, Mr. Hopkins. Yours is
dialog: the first poem to ever have a negative
dialog: score on the Pritchard scale. We're not
dialog: laughing at you, we're laughing near
dialog: you. I don't mind that your poem had a
dialog: simple theme. Sometimes the most
dialog: beautiful poetry can be about simple
text: things, like a cat, or a flower or rain.
dialog: You see, poetry can come from anything
dialog: with the stuff of revelation in it. Just
dialog: don't let your poems be ordinary. Now,
dialog: who's next?
text: Keating approaches Todd's desk.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Mr. Anderson, I see you sitting there in
dialog: agony. Come on, Todd, step up. Let's put
dialog: you out of your misery.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: I, I didn't do it. I didn't write a
dialog: poem.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Mr. Anderson thinks that everything
text: inside of him is worthless and
dialog: embarrassing. Isn't that right, Todd?
dialog: Isn't that your worst fear? Well, I
dialog: think you're wrong. I think you have
dialog: something inside of you that is worth a
dialog: great deal.
text: Keating walks up to the blackboard and begins to write.
speaker_heading: KEATING
text: "I sound my barbaric yawp over the
dialog: rooftops of the world." W. W. Uncle Walt
dialog: again. Now, for those of you who don't
text: know, a yawp is a loud cry or yell. Now,
dialog: Todd, I would like you to give us a
text: demonstration of a barbaric "yawp." Come
dialog: on. You can't yawp sitting down. Let's
dialog: go. Come on. Up.
text: Todd reluctantly stands and follows Keating to the front.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: You gotta get in "yawping" stance.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: A yawp?
speaker_heading: KEATING
text: No, not just a yawp. A barbaric yawp.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Yawp.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Come on, louder.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Yawp.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: No, that's a mouse. Come on. Louder.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Yawp.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Oh, good God, boy. Yell like a man!
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Yawp!
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: There it is. You see, you have a
dialog: barbarian in you, after all.
text: Todd goes to return to his seat but Keating stops him.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Now, you don't get away that easy.
text: Keating turns Todd around and points out a picture on the wall.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: The picture of Uncle Walt up there. What
dialog: does he remind you of? Don't think.
dialog: Answer. Go on.
text: Keating begins to circle around Todd.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: A m-m-madman.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: What kind of madman? Don't think about
dialog: it. Just answer again.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: A c-crazy madman.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: No, you can do better than that. Free up
dialog: your mind. Use your imagination. Say the
dialog: first thing that pops into your head,
dialog: even if it's total gibberish. Go on, go
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Uh, uh, a sweaty-toothed madman.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Good God, boy, there's a poet in you,
dialog: after all. There, close your eyes. Close
dialog: your eyes. Close 'em. Now, describe what
dialog: you see.
text: Keating puts his hands over Todd's eyes and they begin to slowly
text: spin around.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Uh, I-I close my eyes.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: TODD
text: Uh, and this image floats beside me.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: A sweaty-toothed madman?
speaker_heading: TODD
text: A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare
text: that pounds my brain.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Oh, that's excellent. Now, give him
dialog: action. Make him do something.
speaker_heading: TODD
text: H-His hands reach out and choke me.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: That's it. Wonderful. Wonderful.
text: Keating removes his hands from Todd but Todd keeps his eyes
dialog: closed.
speaker_heading: TODD
text: And, and all the time he's mumbling.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: What's he mumbling?
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: M-Mumbling, "Truth. Truth is like, like
dialog: a blanket that always leaves your feet
dialog: cold."
text: The students begin to laugh and Todd opens his eyes. Keating
text: quickly gestures for him to close them again.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Forget them, forget them. Stay with the
dialog: blanket. Tell me about that blanket.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Y-Y-Y-You push it, stretch it, it'll
dialog: never be enough. You kick at it, beat
dialog: it, it'll never cover any of us. From
dialog: the moment we enter crying to the moment
dialog: we leave dying, it will just cover your
text: face as you wail and cry and scream.
text: Todd opens his eyes. The class is silent. Then they begin to clap
dialog: and cheer.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: (whispering to Todd)
dialog: Don't you forget this.

speaker_heading: PITTS
dialog: Duh. It's a lamp, Meeks.

speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: Vocabulary.
text: Knox jumps up.
speaker_heading: KNOX

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Knoxious, you've gotta calm down.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: No, Charlie. That's just my problem.

speaker_heading: NEIL

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What are you gonna do?
speaker_heading: KNOX

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
text: Knox is making a call from the payphone.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (O.S.)
dialog: Hello?
text: Knox immediately hangs up and looks at the other boys who are
text: all gathered around him.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: She's gonna hate me. The Danburrys will
dialog: hate me. My parents will kill me.
dialog: All right, goddamn it. You're right.
text: "Carpe diem." Even if it kills me.
text: Knox puts in another coin and calls again.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (O.S.)
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: KNOX

speaker_heading: CHRIS (O.S.)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Hi. This is Knox Overstreet.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (O.S.)

speaker_heading: KNOX

speaker_heading: CHRIS (O.S.)
dialog: Listen, Chet's parents are going out of

speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Would I like to come to a party?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: CHRIS (O.S.)
dialog: Friday? Um-
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Well, sure.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (O.S.)

speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Okay, great. I-I'll be there, Chris.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (O.S.)

speaker_heading: KNOX

speaker_heading: CHRIS (O.S.)
dialog: Okay. Bye.
speaker_heading: KNOX

speaker_heading: KNOX

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: At Chet Danburry's house.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So, you don't really think she means
dialog: you're going with her?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Well, of course not, Charlie. But that's
dialog: not the point. That's not the point at
dialog: all.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What is the point?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: The point, Charlie, is, uh--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: that she was thinking about me. I've
dialog: only met her once, and already she's
dialog: thinking about me. Damn it. It's gonna
dialog: happen, guys. I feel it. She is going to
dialog: be mine. Carpe. Carpe!

scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD - DAY
text: The students are standing in a line while Cameron, Pitts, and Knox
text: are walking in a circle. Keating watches as they go around.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: No grades at stake, gentlemen. Just take
text: a stroll.
text: After a few moments, the three boys begin to march to the same beat.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: There it is.
text: The other boys start clapping to the rhythm of their steps.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: I don't know, but I've been told--
speaker_heading: BOYS
dialog: I don't know, but I've been told--
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Doing poetry is old--
speaker_heading: BOYS
dialog: Doing poetry is old--
text: Mr. Nolan looks out at them from his office as Keating joins the
text: boys and begins marching with them.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Left, left, left-right-left. Left, left,
dialog: left-right-left. Left, halt!
text: The boys come to a halt.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Thank you, gentlemen. If you noticed,
dialog: everyone started off with their own
text: stride, their own pace.
text: Keating begins walking very slowly.
speaker_heading: KEATING
text: Mr. Pitts, taking his time. He knew he'll
dialog: get there one day. Mr. Cameron, you could
dialog: see him thinking, "Is this right? It might
dialog: be right. It might be right. I know that.
dialog: Maybe not. I don't know."
text: Keating begins walking with his groin pushed forward.
speaker_heading: KEATING
text: Mr. Overstreet, driven by deeper force.
dialog: Yes. We know that. All right. Now, I
dialog: didn't bring them up here to ridicule
dialog: them. I brought them up here to illustrate
dialog: the point of conformity: the difficulty in
dialog: maintaining your own beliefs in the face
dialog: of others. Now, those of you -- I see
dialog: the look in your eyes like, "I would've
dialog: walked differently." Well, ask
dialog: yourselves why you were clapping. Now,
dialog: we all have a great need for acceptance.
dialog: But you must trust that your beliefs are
dialog: unique, your own, even though others may
dialog: think them odd or unpopular, even though
dialog: the herd may go, "That's baaaaad." Robert
dialog: Frost said, "Two roads diverged in a
dialog: wood and I, I took the one less traveled
dialog: by, and that has made all the
dialog: difference." Now, I want you to find
dialog: your own walk right now. Your own way of
text: striding, pacing. Any direction.
dialog: Anything you want. Whether it's proud,
dialog: whether it's silly, anything. Gentlemen,
dialog: the courtyard is yours.
text: The students begin walking about, some walking casually, others
text: making up silly walks. Keating notices that Charlie is still
text: leaning up against one of the pillars.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: You don't have to perform. Just make it
dialog: for yourself. Mr. Dalton? You be joining
dialog: us?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Exercising the right not to walk.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Thank you, Mr. Dalton. You just

speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: NEIL

speaker_heading: TODD

speaker_heading: NEIL

speaker_heading: TODD

text: Neil looks down at a deskset sitting next to Todd, still in
text: its wrappings.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Isn't this the same desk set-
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Yeah, yeah. They gave me the same thing
dialog: as last year.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Maybe they thought you needed another
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Maybe they weren't thinking about
dialog: anything at all. Uh, the funny thing is
dialog: about this is I, I didn't even like it
dialog: the first time.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Todd, I think you're underestimating the
dialog: value of this desk set.
text: Neil picks up the desk set and begins examining it more closely.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: I mean, who would want a football or
dialog: a baseball, or-
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Or a car.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Or a car if they could have a desk set
dialog: as wonderful as this one? I mean, if, if
dialog: I were ever going to buy a, a desk set
dialog: twice, I would probably buy this one
dialog: both times. In fact, its, its shape is,
dialog: it's rather aerodynamic, isn't it? I can
dialog: feel it. This desk set wants to fly.
text: Neil tosses the desk set lightly in the air. Todd stands up
text: and Neil hands him the desk set.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Todd? The world's first unmanned flying
text: desk set.
text: Todd flings the desk set over the side of the walkway and it
text: falls to pieces down below.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Oh, my!
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Well, I wouldn't worry. You'll get

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Knox!
speaker_heading: KNOX

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: No.

speaker_heading: CHRIS
text: No. Ginny Danburry's here. Wait. I have
dialog: to go find Chet. Why don't you go

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: KNOX

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Hey, you Mutt Sanders' brother? Bubba,
dialog: this guy look like Mutt Sanders to you
dialog: or what?

speaker_heading: BUBBA
dialog: You're his brother?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: No relation. Never heard of him. Sorry,
dialog: guys.
speaker_heading: BUBBA
dialog: (obviously drunk)
dialog: Where's your manners Steve? Mutt Sanders'

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: To Mutt.
text: The two guys raise their glasses in a toast and Knox reluctantly
text: joins them.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: To Mutt.
text: They each take a big drink. Knox rolls his eyes and gasps,
text: loosening his tie to try and breathe.
speaker_heading: BUBBA
dialog: Now, how the hell is old Mutt, anyway?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah. What's ol' Mutter been up to, huh?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: I don't really know Mutt.
speaker_heading: BUBBA
dialog: To Mighty Mutt.
speaker_heading: GUY 1
dialog: To Mighty Mutt.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: To Mighty Mutt.

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?

speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: That's so sweet.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I made that up just for you.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: You did?
text: The boys laugh and Cameron shakes his head. Charlie moves over
text: to sit next to Gloria.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'll write one for you too, Gloria.
text: She walks in beauty like the night.
text: She walks in beauty like the night.
text: Of cloudless climes and starry skies.
dialog: All that's best, dark and bright,

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: There's plenty more where that came

scene_heading: INT. CHET'S BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: The room is whirling as Knox belches and staggers across the room. He
text: passes Chet and several of his friends. He steps over several couples
text: kissing on the floor and slump down on the couch, only to be crowded
text: in by another couple who seem oblivious to him. He is about to get up
text: again when he notices Chris sleeping next to him on the couch.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: God help me.
text: Knox looks about and then looks back down at Chris.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Carpe diem.
text: Knox takes a last swig of his drink and then begins to softly run his
text: fingers over Chris' hair. He then leans over and kisses her forehead.
text: Across the room, Bubba looks over and sees what's going on.
speaker_heading: BUBBA
dialog: Chet! Chet! Look!
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BUBBA
dialog: It's Mutt Sanders' brother.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: Huh?
text: Chris rises up from the couch and looks at Knox in surprise.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Knox, what--
speaker_heading: BUBBA
dialog: And he's feeling up your girl!
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Chet gets up from his chair.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: What the hell are you doing?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Chet! Chet, don't.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Now, Chet, I know this looks bad, but
dialog: you've gotta-
text: Chet throws himself at Knox, hurling them both to the floor. He

text: tries to protect himself.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Chet, no! You'll hurt him! No! No! Stop
dialog: it! Leave him alone!
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: Goddamn!
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Chet, stop it!
text: Chris manages to haul Chet away from Knox.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: Bastard!
text: Knox takes his hands away from his face and feels at his bloody
text: nose. Chris tries to help him up.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Knox, are you all right?
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: Chris, get the hell away from him!
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Chet, you hurt him!
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: Good!
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: It's okay. It-It's okay.

speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: Next time I see you, you die.
scene_heading: INT. CAVE - NIGHT
text: Tina passes a bottle of alcohol to Neil.
speaker_heading: TINA

text: There is a moment of awkward silence.
speaker_heading: MEEKS

speaker_heading: PITTS

speaker_heading: GLORIA

scene_heading: MEEKS AND PITTS

dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That's part of what this club is about.
dialog: In fact, I'd like to announce I
dialog: published an article in the school
text: paper, in the name of the Dead Poets.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Demanding girls be admitted to Welton.
speaker_heading: PITTS
dialog: You didn't.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (whispering to Meeks)
dialog: So we can all stop beating off.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: How did you do that?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm one of the proofers. I slipped the
dialog: article in.
speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: Look, uh, it's, it's over now.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Why? Nobody knows who we are.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Well, don't you think they're gonna
dialog: figure out who wrote it? They're gonna
dialog: come to you and ask to know what the
dialog: Dead Poets Society is. Charlie, you had
dialog: no right to do something like that.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It's Nuwanda, Cameron.
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: That's right. It's Nuwanda.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Are we just playing around out here, or
dialog: do we mean what we say? For all we do is
text: come together and reach a bunch of poems
dialog: to each other. What the hell are we
dialog: doing?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: All right, but you still shouldn't have
dialog: done it, Charlie. This could mean
dialog: trouble. You don't speak for the club.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hey, would you not worry about your
dialog: precious little neck? If they catch me,
dialog: I'll tell them I made it up.

speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: Sit.
text: The students all sit.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: In this week of Welton's Honor there
text: appeared a profane and unauthorized
dialog: article. Rather than spend my valuable
dialog: time ferreting out the guilty persons --
dialog: and let me assure you I will find them -
dialog: - I'm asking any and all students who
dialog: knows anything about this article to
dialog: make themselves known here and now.
dialog: Whoever the guilty persons are, this is
dialog: your only chance to avoid expulsion from
dialog: this school.
text: The sound of a phone ringing can be heard. The professors look

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Welton Academy. Hello. Yes, he is. Just
text: a moment.
text: Charlie stands up, holding a phone and bell in his hands.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Mr. Nolan, it's for you. It's

text: Most of the students laugh while the boys from the cave all shake
text: their heads in disbelief.
scene_heading: INT. NOLAN'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Charlie stands with his back to the door as Mr. Nolan shuts it. Mr.
text: Nolan then walks around to face Charlie.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: Wipe that smirk off your face. If you
dialog: think, Mr. Dalton, that you're the first
dialog: to try to get thrown out of this school,
dialog: think again. Others have had similar
dialog: notions and have failed just as surely
dialog: as you will fail. Assume the position.
text: Charlie sighs and bends over, resting his hands on the desk. Mr.
text: Nolan hefts a flat wooden paddle in his hands.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: Count aloud, Mr. Dalton.
text: Mr. Nolan begins to strike Charlie with the paddle.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: One. Two. Three. Four. Five.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: What is this Dead Poets Society? I want

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY

speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: You kicked out?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: So what happened?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm to turn everybody in, apologize to
dialog: the school and all will be forgiven.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: So, what are you gonna do? Charlie!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Damn it, Neil. The name is Nuwanda.

scene_heading: INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY
text: Keating and McAllister are enjoying tea in the small room off the
text: classroom. Mr. Nolan knocks on the door and enters.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: Excuse me. May we have a word, Mr.
dialog: Keating?
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Certainly.
text: Keating fixes his tie and follows Mr. Nolan into the classroom.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: This was my first classroom, John. Did
dialog: you know that? My first desk.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Didn't know you taught, Mr. Nolan.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: English. Oh, long before your time. It
dialog: was hard giving it up, I can tell you.
dialog: I'm hearing rumors, John, about some
dialog: unorthodox teaching methods in your
dialog: classroom. I'm not saying they've
dialog: anything to do with the Dalton boy's
dialog: outburst. But I don't think I have to
dialog: warn you boys his age are very
dialog: impressionable.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Well, your reprimand made quite an
dialog: impression, I'm sure.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: What was going on in the courtyard the
dialog: other day?
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Courtyard?
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
text: Yeah. Boys marching, clapping in unison.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Oh, that. That was an exercise to prove
dialog: a point. Dangers of conformity.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: Well, John, the curriculum here is set.
dialog: It's proven it works. If you question,
dialog: what's to prevent them from doing the
dialog: same?
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: I always thought the idea of educating
dialog: was to learn to think for yourself.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: At these boys' ages? Not on your life!
dialog: Tradition, John. Discipline. Prepare
dialog: them for college, and the rest will take
dialog: care of itself.

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Creak. He started walking around towards
text: my left. Creak. Creak. "Assume the
dialog: position, Mr. Dalton."
text: The door opens and Keating walks in. Many of the boys get up from
dialog: their seats.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: It's all right, gentlemen.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Mr. Keating.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Mr. Dalton. That was a pretty lame stunt
dialog: you pulled today.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You're siding with Mr. Nolan? What about
text: Carpe diem and sucking all the marrow
dialog: out of life and all that?
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Sucking the marrow out of life doesn't
dialog: mean choking on the bone. Sure there's a
dialog: time for daring and there's a time for
dialog: caution, and a wise man understands
dialog: which is called for.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: But I thought you'd like that.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: No. You being expelled from school is
dialog: not daring to me. It's stupid, 'cause
dialog: you'll miss some golden opportunities.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah. Like what?
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Like, if nothing else, the opportunity
dialog: to attend my classes. Got it, Ace?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Aye, aye, Captain.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Keep your head about you. That goes for

speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: No. Nobody-- I thought I'd surprise you.
dialog: I've gotten all A's in every class.
scene_heading: MR. PERRY
dialog: Did you think I wasn't going to find
dialog: out? "Oh, my niece is in a play with
dialog: your son," says Mrs. Marks. "No, no,
dialog: no," I say, "you must be mistaken. My
dialog: son's not in a play." You made me a liar

speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Gosh, they don't give you much room

speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Have you ever told your father what you
dialog: just told me? About your passion for

speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: I can't talk to him this way.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Then you're acting for him, too. You're
dialog: playing the part of the dutiful son. I
dialog: know this sounds impossible, but you
dialog: have to talk to him. You have to show
dialog: him who you are, what your heart is.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: I know what he'll say. He'll tell me
dialog: that acting's a whim, and I should
dialog: forget it. That how they're counting on
dialog: me. He'll just tell me to put it out of
dialog: my mind, "for my own good."
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: You are not an indentured servant. If
dialog: it's not a whim for you, you prove it to
dialog: him by your conviction and your passion.
dialog: You show him that And if he still
dialog: doesn't believe you, well, by then
dialog: you'll be out of school and you can do
dialog: anything you want.

speaker_heading: NEIL

speaker_heading: KNOX

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Well, you did. Chet found out. And it
dialog: took everything I could do to keep him

dialog: out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You know what would happen if Chet found
dialog: out?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: He won't know anything. We'll sit in the

dialog: over.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: And I suppose you would promise that

dialog: Lie further off; in human modesty,
dialog: Such separation as may well be said
text: Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,
dialog: and, good night, sweet friend:
dialog: Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life

dialog: While these visions did appear.
dialog: And this weak and idle theme,

dialog: If you pardon, we will mend:
dialog: And, as I am an honest Puck,
dialog: If we have unearned luck
dialog: Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,
dialog: We will make amends ere long;
dialog: Else the Puck a liar call;
dialog: So, good night unto you all.
dialog: Give me your hands, if we be friends,
dialog: And Robin shall restore amends.

text: something. Looking closer, he sees a thin cloud of smoke rising from

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Todd? Todd.
text: Todd, still half asleep, tries to shrug him off.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Oh, Charlie.
text: Todd opens his eyes and sees Charlie's face
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: What is it?
text: Todd looks over to see Pitts, Meeks, and Knox by the door.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Neil's dead.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPUS - DAY
text: It is a snowy, overcast morning. Todd walks through the snow. He
text: has his coat on over his pyjamas. The other boys follow closely

text: out at the snow-covered surroundings.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: It's so beautiful.
text: Todd begins to gag and then goes down on his knees, vomiting into
text: the snow. The other boys huddle around him, hugging him.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Todd. It's okay, Todd.
speaker_heading: PITTS
dialog: Calm down.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It's all right, Todd.
speaker_heading: PITTS
dialog: Todd, it's okay. It's okay, Todd.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It's all right. It's alright.
text: Charlie grabs a handful of snow and wipes Todd's mouth with it.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: He wouldn't-- He wouldn't have done it.
speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: You can't explain it, Todd.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: It was his father!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: He wouldn't have left us. It's because he-
dialog: He wouldn't have. His dad was-- his, his
dialog: father did it.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Todd.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: His father killed him. He made him do it.
speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: You can't explain it, Todd.
text: Todd pushes himself away from the boys and stumbles down the hill,
text: slipping and falling in the snow.
speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: Todd!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Leave him be.
text: The boys watch as Todd runs down towards the dock by the river,
text: yelling and crying. He finally seems to regain control of himself
text: and walks in silence out onto the dock.
scene_heading: INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY
text: Keating sits by himself at his desk. After a moment he gets up
text: and walks over to Neil's desk. Opening it, he finds his copy
text: of "Five Centuries of Verse" and flips through the first few pages.
text: Sitting down at the desk, he returns to the opening page, reading
text: the opening verse written there. Keating begins to sob, then closes
dialog: the book.
scene_heading: INT. ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY
text: A church service is going on. The boys have joined in the other

speaker_heading: BOYS
dialog: (singing)
dialog: All my life
dialog: Thy light shall surely follow me
dialog: And in God's house forevermore
dialog: My dwelling place shall be
dialog: Amen.
text: Mr. Nolan stands at the pulpit, with the rest of the professors
text: seated behind him.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
text: The death of Neil Perry is a tragedy. He
dialog: was a fine student. One of Welton's
dialog: best. And he will be missed. We've
dialog: contacted each of your parents to
dialog: explain the situation. Naturally,
dialog: they're all quite concerned. At the
dialog: request of Neil's family, I intend to
dialog: conduct a thorough inquiry into this
dialog: matter. Your complete cooperation is
dialog: expected.
scene_heading: INT. CLOAKROOM - DAY
text: The boys (except Cameron) are sitting about the cluttered room
text: waiting. Charlie lights a cigarette.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You told him about this meeting?
speaker_heading: PITTS
dialog: Twice.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That's it, guys. We're all fried.
speaker_heading: PITTS
dialog: How do you mean?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Cameron's a fink. He's in Nolan's office
text: right now, finking.
speaker_heading: PITTS
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: The club, Pittsie. Think about it. The
dialog: board of directors, the trustees and Mr.
dialog: Nolan. Do you think for one moment
dialog: they're gonna let this thing just blow
dialog: over? Schools go down because of things
text: like this. They need a scapegoat.
text: The door opens. All the boys except Charlie hurry to put
text: their cigarettes out and wave the smoke away. A light comes on
text: and Cameron enters.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: What's going on, guys?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You finked, didn't you, Cameron?
text: Charlie gets up and approaches Cameron, tossing his cigarette away.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Finked? I didn't know what the hell
dialog: you're talking about.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You told Nolan everything about the club
dialog: is what I'm talking about.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Look, in case you hadn't heard, Dalton,
dialog: there's something called an honor code
dialog: at this school, all right? If a teacher
dialog: asks you a question, you tell the truth
dialog: or you're expelled.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You little-
text: Charlie lunges at Cameron but Knox and Meeks hold him back.
speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: Charlie!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: He's a rat! He's in it up to his eyes,
text: so he rattled to save himself.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Don't touch him, Charlie. You do and
dialog: you're out.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm out anyway!
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: You don't know that, not yet.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: He's right there, Charlie. And if you
dialog: guys are smart, you will do exactly what
dialog: I did and cooperate. They're not after
dialog: us. We're the victims. Us and Neil.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What's that mean? Who are they after?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Why, Mr. Keating, of course. The
dialog: "Captain" himself. I mean, you guys
dialog: didn't really think he could avoid
dialog: responsibility, did you?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Mr. Keating responsible for Neil? Is
dialog: that what they're saying?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Well, who else do you think, dumb ass?
dialog: The administration? Mr. Perry? Mr.
dialog: Keating put us up to all this crap,
dialog: didn't he? If he wasn't for Mr. Keating,
text: Neil would be cozied up in his room
text: right now, studying his chemistry and
text: dreaming of being called doctor.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: That is not true, Cameron. You know
dialog: that. He didn't put us to anything. Neil
dialog: loved acting.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Believe what you want, but I say let
dialog: Keating fry. I mean, why ruin our lives?
text: Charlie lunges at Cameron again and punches him in the face.
text: Cameron falls to the floor as the boys pull Charlie away. Cameron
text: lifts a hand to his bloody nose.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: You just signed your expulsion papers,
dialog: Nuwanda.
text: Cameron rises to his feet.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: And if the rest of you are smart, you'll
dialog: do exactly what I did. They know
dialog: everything anyway. You can't save
dialog: Keating, but you can save yourselves.
text: Cameron walks away, closing the door behind him.
scene_heading: INT. TODD'S ROOM - DAY
text: Todd looks out the window and watches as Hager escorts Meeks back
text: to the dorm. Inside the room, Neil's bed has been stripped of all
text: its bedding.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
text: Meeks walks slowly to his room. Hager remains standing at the end of
text: the hallway.
speaker_heading: HAGER
dialog: Knox Overstreet.
text: Knox emerges from his room and goes to joing Hager. He gives a thumbs
text: up to Todd as he passes his door. Once he leaves with Hager, Todd goes
text: over to Meeks' door.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Meeks?
speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: Go away. I have to study.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: What happened to Nuwanda?
speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: Expelled.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: What'd you tell 'em?
speaker_heading: MEEKS

speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Mom.
text: THe door closes behind Todd. He remains standing, not knowing
dialog: what to do.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: Have a seat, Mr. Anderson.
text: Todd sits down next to his parents.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: Mr. Anderson, I think we've pretty well
dialog: put together what's happened here. You
dialog: do admit to being a part of this Dead
dialog: Poets Society?
text: Todd says nothing.
scene_heading: MR. ANDERSON
dialog: Answer him, Todd.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Mr. Nolan puts his glasses on and glances at a paper before him
text: before removing his glasses once more.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: I have here a detailed description of
dialog: what occurred at your meetings. It
dialog: describes how your teacher, Mr. Keating,
dialog: encouraged you boys to organize this
dialog: club and to use it as a source of
dialog: inspiration for reckless and self-
text: indulgent behavior. It describes how Mr.
text: Keating, both in and out of the
dialog: classroom, encouraged Neil Perry to
dialog: follow his obsession with acting when he
dialog: knew all along it was against the
text: explicit order of Neil's parents. It was
text: Mr. Keating's blatant abuse of his
dialog: position as teacher that led directly to
dialog: Neil Perry's death.
text: Mr. Nolan motions to Todd's father, who passes along a sheet of
dialog: paper to Todd.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: Read that document carefully, Todd. Very
dialog: carefully.
text: Todd looks at the paper, which already contains the signatures of
text: the other four boys.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: If you've nothing to add or amend, sign
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: What's gonna happen to Mr. Keating?
scene_heading: MR. ANDERSON
dialog: I've had enough. Sign the paper, Todd.
text: Mr. Nolan holds out a pen for Todd to take.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPUS - DAY
text: Mr. McAllister leads his students, textbooks in hand, through the
text: snow outside the classrooms.
speaker_heading: McALLISTER
dialog: Grass is gramen or herba. Lapis is
text: stone. The entire building is
dialog: aedificium.
text: Keating looks out from his office window. McAllister pauses and looks
text: up at Keating, giving him a brief wave. Keating waves back.
scene_heading: INT. KEATING'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Keating laughs slightly as he watches McAllister from the window.
text: Inside, all his belongings have been packed up.
scene_heading: INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY
text: The students are all seated at their desks in silence. Everyone looks
text: as the door opens. They quickly stand as Mr. Nolan enters the room.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: Sit.
text: The students sit once again as Mr. Nolan walks to the front of the room.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: I'll be teaching this class through
dialog: exams. We'll find a permanent English
dialog: teacher during the break. Who will tell
dialog: me where you are in the Pritchard
dialog: textbook?
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: Mr. Anderson?
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Uh, in the, in the Pr-
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: I can't hear you, Mr. Anderson.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: In the, in the, in the Pritchard?
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: Kindly inform me, Mr. Cameron.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: We skipped around a lot, sir. We covered
dialog: the Romantics and some of the chapters
dialog: on Post Civil War literature.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: What about the Realists?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: I believe we skipped most of that, sir.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: All right, then, we'll start over. What
dialog: is poetry?
text: There is a knock at the classroom door.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: Come.
text: The students look back as the door opens. They quickly turn
dialog: away when hey see it is Keating.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Excuse me. I came for my personals.
dialog: Should I come back after class?
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: Get them now, Mr. Keating.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: Gentlemen, turn to page 21 of the
dialog: introduction. Mr. Cameron, read aloud
text: the excellent essay by Dr. Pritchard on
dialog: "Understanding Poetry."
text: Todd slowly closes his book. Keating opens the door to the tiny
text: room off the classroom.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: That page has been ripped out, sir.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: Well, borrow somebody else's book.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: They're all ripped out, sir.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: What do you mean, they're all ripped
dialog: out?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Sir, we, uh-
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: Never mind.
text: Mr. Nolan takes his own book over to Cameron's desk and then
text: slaps the open page.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: Read!
text: As Cameron begins to read, Keating looks out at Todd as he puts
text: his scarf on. Todd looks at him for a moment and then glances away.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: "Understanding Poetry by Dr. J Evans
dialog: Pritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand
dialog: poetry, we must first be fluent with its
text: meter, rhyme and figures of speech, then
dialog: ask two questions: 1) How artfully has
dialog: the objective of the poem been rendered
dialog: and 2)..."
text: The door squeaks as Keating shuts it behind him. Cameron pauses.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: "... How important is that objective?
dialog: Question 1 rates the poem's perfection;
dialog: question 2 rates its importance. And
dialog: once these questions have been answered,
text: determining the poem's greatness becomes
dialog: a relatively simple matter. If the
text: poem's score for perfection is plotted
text: on the horizontal of a graph--"
text: Keating passes by Todd and the others and gets to the back of the
text: classroom before Todd leaps up from his seat and turns to face him.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Mr. Keating! They made everybody sign
dialog: it.
text: Mr. Nolan gets up from his desk and approaches Todd.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: Quiet, Mr. Anderson.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: You gotta believe me. It's true.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: I do believe you, Todd.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: Leave, Mr. Keating.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: But it wasn't his fault!
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: Sit down, Mr. Anderson!
text: Todd reluctantly returns to his seat.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: One more outburst from you or anyone
dialog: else, and you're out of this school!
dialog: Leave, Mr. Keating.
text: Keating hesitates at the back of the classroom.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: I said leave, Mr. Keating.
text: Keating slowly turns and heads to the door. As he opens
text: it, Todd, stands upon his desk and turns to Keating.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: O Captain! My Captain!
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: Sit down, Mr. Anderson!
text: Keating pauses at the door and looks back at Todd on his desk.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: Do you hear me? Sit down! Sit down! This
dialog: is your final warning, Anderson. How
dialog: dare you? Do you hear me?
text: After a moment of indecision, Knox climbs up onto his desk.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: O Captain! My Captain!
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: Mr. Overstreet, I warn you! Sit down!
text: Pitts climbs up onto his desk, followed by several others,
dialog: including Meeks.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: Sit down! Sit down. All of you. I want
dialog: you seated. Sit down. Leave, Mr.
dialog: Keating.
text: More students stand on their desks until half the class is standing.
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: All of you, down. I want you seated. Do
dialog: you hear me?
speaker_heading: MR. NOLAN
dialog: Sit down!
text: Keating stands in the doorway, staring up at the boys in wonder. A
text: smile comes to his face.
speaker_heading: KEATING
dialog: Thank you, boys. Thank you.
