scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - DAY
text: A football game is in progress. Six guys on each side,
text: all in their late teens and early twenties, wearing
text: khaki pants, work shirts, T-shirts. OVER, we hear the
text: voice of BRUCE DERRINGER. The first player we see is
scene_heading: VIRGE HOOGESTEGER.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (V.0.)
dialog: Virge Hoogesteger., What kind of
dialog: name is that? Nicknamed 'The
dialog: Virgin.â€™ Well, look at him. Poor
dialog: kid probably tries to get a girl
text: into bed and she wants to make him
text: brush his teeth and wash behind
text: his ears.
text: Then we see JACK BOCCI bulldozing down one of the
dialog: defense players.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (V.0.)
dialog: Look at this goon. Jack Bocci
dialog: from Brooklyn. He's a magician.
dialog: Wants to be the next Houdini.
dialog: Well, he's escaped twenty-four
dialog: missions. Not bad for an amateur.
text: Next, EUGENE McVEY nervously making a play.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (V.0.)
dialog: This is the religious one.
dialog: There's always a religious one.
dialog: Eugene McVey. Nineteen from
dialog: Cleveland. There's always one
dialog: from Cleveland. High strung,
text: nervous, always coming down with
dialog: something. How'd he get in this
dialog: bunch?
text: Next, we see RICHARD "RASCAL" MOORE showing off.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (V.0.)
dialog: Rascal? That can't be his real
dialog: name. Here we go. Richard Moore,
dialog: but called the Rascal. Thinks
dialog: he's a real ladies man. Talks
dialog: dirty, the whole bit. Well, he'll
dialog: grow out of it. If he grows at all.
text: Then we see CLAY BUSBY, cooly running with the ball.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: 1A
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BRUCE (V.0.)
text: Clay Busby, a farmer's son from
text: Louisiana. Plays piano and sings.
dialog: Listen to this. Learned piano in
dialog: a New Orleans whorehouse. Better
dialog: keep that out of the papers.
text: Last, we see DANNY DALY. He has the ball and is going
text: for the touchdown as his team urges him on.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (V.0.)
dialog: Oh boy, this kid couldn't be more
dialog: Irish if he tried. Even his name,
dialog: Danny Daly. He's the
dialog: intellectual. Writes poetry.
dialog: Likes to read. Hates sports.
text: Danny makes the touchdown. He shouts with exhilaration
text: and raises the ball in triumph. Just then, a huge olive
text: drab B-17 bomber appears out of nowhere and roars
text: directly overhead. The game is forgotten and everyone
text: starts running towards a short, boxy control tower. Now
text: we see that the football field is a grassy area on the
text: side of an air field with three intersecting runways.
text: Men are coming from all over the base, on foot and
text: bicycle, shouting out the number of planes: five, seven,
text: nine, twelve! Planes are appearing all over the sky.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: Fifteen, sixteen!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How many went out?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Twenty-one.
speaker_heading: VIRGE
dialog: There's another!
text: We MOVE UP TO the control tower. The balcony is crowded
text: with men. THROUGH the window we see the CO (Commanding
text: Officer) on the phone.
scene_heading: INT. CONTROL TOWER - DAY
text: The CO is in his early thirties, impeccably-dressed.
dialog: He's in charge and handles his many responsibilities
dialog: efficiently -- no detail is too small. In the b.g. are
text: the adjutant and other personnel.

dialog: Sir, they're still coming in.
dialog: How can I promise you 24 planes
dialog: tomorrow when they're not even
dialog: back?
text: The adjutant comes up to him with some papers, the CO
text: grabs them and motions the adjutant away. The CO is
text: shocked by what he hears. He speaks quietly.
dialog: co
dialog: Where? But we hit that target a
dialog: month ago, sir. I thought...
text: The voice on the other end interrupts.
dialog: co
dialog: I know we have to put the pressure
dialog: on, but I almost lost a quarter of
dialog: my...
text: The 8-2, a scholarly, bespectacled young man, comes in
text: from the balcony and waits to get the CO's attention.
text: Frustrated, exasperated, the CO listens to the voice on
dialog: the other end.
dialog: co
dialog: Yes, sir. Yes, sir, I'll have my
dialog: ground crews work all night. I
dialog: was hoping to give them a little
dialog: break. We're having a dance
dialog: tonight in honor of the Group's
dialog: first anniversary...
dialog: (interrupted again)
dialog: Yes, I'll give you an update as
dialog: soon as I know more. Thank you,
dialog: sir. Goodbye.
text: He hangs up. He's shaken by the news he's received.
dialog: 8-2
text: Sir, eighteen planes. Three still
dialog: out.
text: He nods, then hurries out the door to the balcony.
scene_heading: EXT. CONTROL TOWER BALCONY - DAY
text: On the balcony, COLONEL BRUCE DERRINGER. Bruce is in
text: his mid-thirties, has all-American good looks and an
text: easy-going charm that he can turn on and off at will.
text: Bruce isn't watching the planes landing. He's looking
text: down at the lawn below. The CO comes out on the balcony
dialog: with the S-2.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: 2 CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: So that's them.
dialog: co
dialog: Those are the enlisted men.
dialog: You're meeting the officers
dialog: this afternoon.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: They must be the ten luckiest
dialog: sons of bitches in the world.
dialog: co
dialog: They're ordinary men, Bruce.
speaker_heading: 2A BRUCE'S POV
text: FROM the balcony DOWN TO the control tower lawn where
text: our six boys are just joining the crowd below.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (0.8.)
dialog: Are you kidding? First, they
dialog: volunteer for this, then they
dialog: do 24 missions without a scratch.
dialog: They don't sound very ordinary
dialog: to me.
dialog: 8-2
dialog: Two more, sir.
scene_heading: 2B EXT. CONTROL TOWER BALCONY - DAY
text: The CO looks out at arriving planes through his
text: binoculars.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: You know, people at home are
dialog: getting pretty discouraged by our
dialog: losses. They're starting to think
dialog: daylight bombing is a mistake.
dialog: co
dialog: It's the only way we're going to
dialog: win this war.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: You're right, and we've got to
dialog: get that message across. That's
dialog: where I come in. The nation's
dialog: going to fall in love with those
dialog: boys. The first crew in the
dialog: Eighth Air Force to complete their
dialog: tour of duty.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

dialog: They haven't done it yet.
speaker_heading: BRUCE

scene_heading: EXT. CONTROL TOWER LAWN
text: The six boys anxiously watch for the last plane.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: One more. It'd be great if
dialog: everyone came back today. With
dialog: the dance and everything.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I give them four to one. Any
dialog: takers?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Me.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Show me your money, Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Gene, lend me some money.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: What do I look like, Wells Fargo?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: There they are!
text: Danny points out at the horizon. The boys are relieved.
text: They push each other around a little, then turn and start
text: walking across the field towards the barracks. SOUND:
scene_heading: ENGINE SPUTTERING. (The following dialogue can be used
dialog: as the men walk away, if needed.)
speaker_heading: VIRGE
dialog: I heard they brought in a swell
dialog: band for the dance tonight.
speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: OMITTED
scene_heading: EXT. BASE - DAY
text: The plane is coming in to land. It has two feathered
text: props and only the left front wheel is down. The wheel
text: touches the runway and the plane immediately tips to
text: the right. It pivots on its single wheel, scraping its
text: belly on the runway. The props on the right side bend
text: back, slowing the PLANE's spin. It starts to come to
text: a halt, but just as it looks like it's safe, it EXPLODES
text: in a sudden fiery blast.
scene_heading: EXT. CONTROL TOWER LAWN - DAY
text: The six boys recoil with shock and disbelief. Danny
text: watches as long as he can, then turns away -- he
dialog: can't stand it anymore.
scene_heading: EXT. CONTROL TOWER BALCONY - DAY
text: Bruce is also looking at the burning plane with horror.
text: The CO is stony-faced. He shows no surprise and little
text: emotion -- he's seen it too often before.
dialog: co
dialog: Come on, Bruce, you wanted to meet
dialog: the officers of the Southern
dialog: Belle.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Jesus, what happened? They were

scene_heading: EXT. BASE - DAY

speaker_heading: OMITTED
scene_heading: INT. MESS HALL - DAY
text: DENNIS DEARBORN is sitting stiffly in a chair, the
text: bomb group symbol behind him on the mess wall. Dennis,
text: at twenty-six, is the oldest of the crew. He's a
dialog: serious young man -- you never catch him smiling or
text: relaxing. His photo has just been taken by a Life
text: Magazine photographer. Bruce is behind the camera,
text: interviewing Dennis.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: You named the plane after your
dialog: girl back home, that's a great
dialog: angle. You don't sound like
dialog: you're from the South, Captain
dialog: Dearborn.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: I met her when I was in Memphis

speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I bet she's a living doll, huh,

speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: A lifeguard. That's a pretty
dialog: responsible job, Luke.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah, it's rough basking in the
text: sun all day, having girls swarm
dialog: all over you. That's why I
dialog: joined up. Had to get away from
dialog: all that.
text: Flash. Now VAL KOZLOWSKI the bombardier, is sitting in
text: the hotseat. Val has Latin good looks and a street
text: fighter's body. He's a pretty intense guy. He squirms,
text: pushes at his hair, tries to loosen his collar,
text: straighten his tie.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Val. What's that short for,
dialog: Valentine? I bet the women love
dialog: that. You're the bombardier and
dialog: I understand you've got four
dialog: years of medical school under
dialog: your belt.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: Yeah. Well, something like that.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Believe me, when your picture
dialog: comes out in Life Magazine, every
dialog: man, woman and child in America is
dialog: going to want you to be their
dialog: doctor.
text: Val brightens at this. Flash. Now PHIL LOWENTHAL is in
text: the chair. Phil's in his early twenties, with a lot of
text: hair and a lot of teeth. He slumps in the chair, moody
text: and gloomy. He'd like to be anywhere but here.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Phil, look at the camera. Sit up
dialog: straight. Smile.
speaker_heading: PHIL

speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: You'll go back home in your own
dialog: plane and fly all over the States,
dialog: making speeches, getting people to
dialog: buy more war bonds, work longer
dialog: hours, turn out more planes. And
dialog: believe me, you'll be wined,
text: womened and songed from one end of

speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Sir, you mean we're going to be
dialog: famous?
speaker_heading: BRUCE

speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Their pictures in Life? Wine,

speaker_heading: DENNIS

speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Come on, we could do our jobs in

speaker_heading: DENNIS

text: Eugene swings under the big girl's arm, kicks Jack in

speaker_heading: ON DENNIS
text: Feeling alienated, alone, he turns and walks out the
dialog: door.
scene_heading: EXT. BASE - NIGHT
text: It's dark, foggy. Dennis walks across the field toward
text: another hangar, a beer in his hand. The BAND can be
text: heard in the DISTANCE.
scene_heading: INT. SECOND HANGAR - NIGHT
text: It is brightly, starkly lit with floodlights. There are
text: planes and parts of planes crowded in here with ground
text: crews crawling over them. It is an epic sight, showing
dialog: the huge scale of the air war and the number of men
dialog: required to sustain it. In the f.g. is a plane, "Is You
text: Is Or Is You Ain't My Baby?" The pilot's window is
text: shattered, a front tire is flat, a chunk has been taken
text: out of the tail, the ball turret is broken in half and
text: what remains is covered in dried blood. A mechanic is
text: hosing it out. LES ENRIGHT, a stocky man in his mid-
text: thirties, wearing grease-stained coveralls, is helping
text: carry a new ball turret over to the plane. Dennis goes
text: over to him.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Les, what are you doing here?
dialog: You're my ground crew chief.

speaker_heading: LES
dialog: Number three's fixed. It's all

dialog: my job, Captain. Watch your feet.
text: A dark red pool is gathering right at Dennis feet.

speaker_heading: LES
text: The Belle's in mint condition. If
dialog: you don't believe me, go look at
dialog: her. She's out on the apron, Sir.
text: Les turns back to work. A moment. Dennis knows he
text: jumped on Les a little too fast, but he also doesn't
text: want to apologize. He turns and goes out the door.
scene_heading: EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE - NIGHT
text: We see only the vague outline of the Belle through the
text: fog as Dennis approaches. He stops in front of the nose
text: and speaks to the plane.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Well, I'm going to miss you, girl.
dialog: We've been together a long time
dialog: and you've never let me down. I
dialog: can't say that about many people.
dialog: You know how to take care of your
dialog: man and that's just about the best
dialog: thing a fellow can say about a
dialog: girl, I guess. Maybe we'll be
dialog: going back to the States together,
dialog: but it won't be the same, will it?
dialog: It won't have the same...
text: He searches for the word, can't find it, then starts to
text: take a drink. But he decides he's had enough and pours
text: the rest of the beer on the ground. He turns and walks
text: back across the field to the dance. Then a head pops up
text: and looks out through the nose of the plane: Virge.
speaker_heading: FAITH (0.8.)
dialog: I wish you'd talk to me like that,
dialog: Virge.
dialog: 20.
scene_heading: 18 INT. NOSE - NIGHT
text: Looking forward, we see Virge and Faith in silhouette.
text: They've put something down on the floor of the plane as
text: a makeshift bed, perhaps some parachutes.
speaker_heading: VIRGE
dialog: You know what the captain would do
dialog: if he caught us in here? He'd
dialog: murder me. Come on, Faith, let's
dialog: get this over with and get back
text: to the dance.
text: They try to get it going again.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Wait, there's something... Hold
dialog: on. There! Sorry.
text: Faith pulls something out from under her. Virge grabs
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: VIRGE
dialog: My wrench! I've been looking for
dialog: that all over! Where'd you find
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Under my bum.
speaker_heading: VIRGE
dialog: Oh, thanks. Boy, I thought
dialog: someone stole it.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Virge, forget the bloody wrench.

speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: You've never done this before,

speaker_heading: VIRGE
dialog: Why, am I doing something wrong?
speaker_heading: FAITH

speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Maybe I'll pop â€˜round for a

speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I'll go in first, if that's...
speaker_heading: VIRGE
dialog: Oh, sure! Go right ahead.

scene_heading: INT. AIRPLANE HANGAR - NIGHT

speaker_heading: ROOKIE
dialog: Hooray...
text: Danny grabs his arm to stop him. A couple of other
text: rookies have started to cheer, but they also quickly shut
text: up. A grim silence falls over the hangar. Bruce is
text: embarrassed and doesn't know what to do. Danny looks at
text: Clay -- a look saying "Do something." Clay quickly goes
text: through the crowd and steps up onstage and takes the
text: microphone.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: This buddy of mine keeps begging
dialog: me to sing and I guess I ain't
dialog: gonna get out of it this time.

speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: 'From glen to glen,
dialog: And down the mountain side...'
text: Then suddenly, without warning, Clay and the band go

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: I don't want to die, I don't want

text: a leggy woman in a bathing suit. Also, twenty-four
text: yellow bomb emblems and eight swastikas. The big forward
text: landing gear gives it a wide stance and the nose points
text: into the air, as if eager to take off. The plane is
text: huge, so huge it doesn't look like it could ever get off
text: the ground. It's a dramatic sight, the sun coming up
text: yellow and hot behind this 30 tons of machine. Men are

scene_heading: EXT. BARRACKS - DAWN

text: splashing mud. Val starts jogging.
scene_heading: EXT. BASE - DAWN
text: Val jogs around the perimeter track. Planes are on
text: their individual hardstands, with ground crews crawling
text: over them. Gas trucks and bomb carts come and go.
text: Ordinance crews are loading fat olive drab bombs into

dialog: of him.
scene_heading: EXT. AIRPLANE HANGAR - DAWN
text: All that remains of the dance is some beer bottles,

text: Suddenly, a voice cries out.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Bogey, six o'clock low!

speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Look out!

text: more and more planes -- B-17s stacked up all over the sky.
text: The formation is composed of three groups, each group

speaker_heading: EUGENE

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: DANNY

scene_heading: EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE

speaker_heading: LUKE (V.0.)

scene_heading: INT. NOSE

dialog: man.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Jesus, he doesn't have a parachute.
dialog: How long would it take to fall?
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: Too long.

speaker_heading: DENNIS (V.0.)

scene_heading: INT. RADIO ROOM

speaker_heading: DANNY

scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT

speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: It's a scratch! Look! It's

dialog: bullet.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: My harmonica! Goddamnit, my
dialog: favorite harmonica!
text: Laughing, Eugene quickly wraps his flight scarf around

speaker_heading: DANNY

dialog: You have to fly straight through

speaker_heading: ROOKIE (V.0.)

text: Suddenly, a BANG and a hole opens in the left wall of the
text: radio room and a small, SIZZLING piece of FLAK skates
text: across Danny's desk, digs a scar in the wood and lands
text: on top of his log book. It burns a little hole in the

text: shrapnel away.
scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT
