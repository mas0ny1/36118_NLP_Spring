scene_heading: EXT. ST. ANN'S SCHOOL - DAY
text: CAMERA PANS a group of freshly-scrubbed, innocent children,
text: obediently standing in line, like recruits for the Holy
text: Crusade. PULL BACK to REVEAL they are wearing the gray
text: blazers, striped ties and navy slacks of St. Luke's School.
text: They are waiting patiently at the curbside in front of the
text: statue of the school's sainted namesake. One of the fifth
text: grade BOYS pokes the KID next to him with his elbow. The
text: other Kid is about to retaliate when SISTER MARY FRANCIS, a
text: stern-faced nun, appears behind them, grabbing them both
text: firmly by the shoulders.
scene_heading: SISTER MARY FRANCIS
dialog: Make one more move and you'll both
dialog: be staying late for the rest of the
dialog: week.
speaker_heading: THE BOYS
dialog: (softly; in unison)
dialog: Sorry, Sister Mary Francis.
scene_heading: SISTER MARY FRANCIS
dialog: I didn't hear you.
speaker_heading: THE BOYS
dialog: (louder)
dialog: Sorry, Sister Mary Francis.
text: Sister Mary Francis checks her watch. She scowls and looks
text: out past the parking lot gate.
text: Suddenly we HEAR the SOUND of an ENGINE roaring at full
text: throttle. There is a SCREECHING of BRAKES, followed by the
text: loud GRINDING of GEARS. It sounds like the Indy 500 is taking
text: place around the corner.
scene_heading: SISTER MARY FRANCIS
dialog: (used to this)
text: Step away from the curb, children.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Zooming through the parking lot gates is a large yellow school
text: bus. It practically takes the last turn on just two wheels.
text: The bus driver quickly slams on the brakes, leaving ten feet
text: of rubber behind him as the bus comes to an ear-splitting
text: halt right in front of them. The front door immediately swings
text: open and RICK STAHL, the driver, hops out. Rick is the life
text: of the party, even when there isn't any party going on.
text: While chronologically older than the St. Luke students, the
text: only thing that sets him apart from them is that he has a
text: driver's license. Rick figures he'll live up to his
dialog: capabilities and get serious in his next life... This
dialog: incarnation's strictly for laughs. Sister Mary Francis steps
text: up to him.
scene_heading: SISTER MARY FRANCIS
dialog: You're late again, Rick.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I know, Sister, but I have a very
dialog: good excuse.
scene_heading: SISTER MARY FRANCIS
dialog: There can be no excuse for tardiness.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: You're absolutely right. I should
dialog: never have stopped to save that
dialog: drowning infant. I'm just weak,
dialog: Sister; I'm so weak.
text: He starts sobbing softly into his hands.
scene_heading: SISTER MARY FRANCIS
dialog: All right, stop that... Children, on
dialog: the bus.
text: The kids obediently file past Rick, who makes like he is
text: drying his tears with his handkerchief.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Sister, do you ever get lonely after
dialog: vespers? If you do, why don't you
dialog: give me a call. I'm in the book.
scene_heading: SISTER MARY FRANCIS
dialog: (smiling despite
dialog: herself)
dialog: Get going, Rick... you're late enough
dialog: as it is.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Right... Think it over.
text: He hops on the bus, closes the door and gently backs the bus
text: out of the parking lot.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - DAY
text: As soon as the bus is out of sight of the school, all hell
text: breaks loose. The formally well-mannered children are acting
text: like normal kids... hitting each other over the heads with
text: books, running up and down the aisles, screaming at the top
dialog: of their lungs.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - RICK
text: He removes the St. Christopher statue from the dashboard,
text: revealing a hulaing Hawaiian girl in a grass skirt. He watches
text: the madness behind him in his rearview mirror, picks up the
text: P.A. microphone and rationally attempts to restore order.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (over mike)
dialog: If you don't all calm down I'm gonna
dialog: drive this thing over a cliff.
text: The kids pay no attention to him.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (continuing;
dialog: philosophically)
dialog: Ah... youth.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BUS
text: Rick's bus pulls up to a light and another school bus filled
text: with kids (from a public school) pulls up alongside of it.
text: The other DRIVER gives Rick a competitive smirk and guns his
text: engine. Rick counters by gunning his.
scene_heading: INT. THE BUS
text: All the kids start screaming "Race... race." "Wipe 'em out."
text: "Go for it." Etc. Some of the kids even start taking out
text: money and start betting one another on the race's outcome.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - RICK
text: as he readies for action.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BUSES
text: The light turns green and they're off. Or as off as two lunky
dialog: school buses filled with kids can be.
scene_heading: WIDE SHOT - ANOTHER STREET
text: The two buses come zooming down the street.
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S BUS
text: The kids are screaming at Rick to go faster. One of the little
text: boys looks nauseous as he clutches the seat in front of him.
scene_heading: EXT. THE STREET - LOW ANGLE
text: The buses squeeze down a narrow street, neck and neck with
dialog: one another.
scene_heading: INT. THE BUS
text: The kids are all yelling words of encouragement to Rick, who
text: is hunched over in his seat, driving with the determination
text: of Andy Granitelli. The nauseous kid is now turning a pale
text: shade of green. He moves to an open window, straining to
dialog: control the inevitable.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BUSES
text: They race down a steep hill.
scene_heading: INT. THE BUS
text: The nauseous kid can't hold it any longer.
scene_heading: EXT. THE OTHER BUS
text: Something hits with a splat against the windshield that
text: resembles Campbell's Chunky Vegetable Soup.
scene_heading: INT. THE OTHER BUS
text: The other Driver turns on the windshield. It only makes it
dialog: worse.
scene_heading: EXT. THE STREET
text: Rick's bus pulls out in front, accompanied by the cheering
text: of his passengers. Suddenly a stop light looms ahead. Rick
text: puts on his brakes. Both buses stop just in time.
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S BUS
text: Rick's kids are all piled in a clump right behind him in the
text: front of the bus. Although disheveled, the kids still manage
text: a victorious cheer.
scene_heading: PHOTOGRAPHER'S POV
text: We're LOOKING THROUGH the camera lens. We SEE a cute one-
text: year-old baby boy. He's sitting on a cuddly blanket. We HEAR
text: the VOICE of Jay O'Neill. He is a baby photographer at Sears.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL (O.S.)
dialog: Okay, Timmy... hold that smile...
dialog: and watch the birdie.
text: He takes the picture and we SEE the camera flash.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL (O.S.)
dialog: There.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
text: We see he has his camera and backdrop set up in the camera
text: department behind a velour curtain which blacks out the rest
text: of the store. He's conservatively dressed in a suit, vest
text: and tie. He looks like he could be a Young Republican. But
text: under those Sears clothes is a man a little off center. Rick's
text: best friend. Need we say more? He takes the film out of the
text: camera. The matronly mother is in the process of gathering
dialog: up her baby.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: These should be in the mail to you
dialog: by next Friday.
text: She smiles and exits.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Next.
text: A beautiful -- and we're talking gorgeous -- WOMAN enters.
text: Her clothes hug every curve of her body. She has her baby in
text: her arms. O'Neill immediately wants her, and now. His eyes
text: settle onto her full breasts. These he likes.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Whoa. Look at those babies.
text: She gets this innuendo and loves it.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: How are we doing? My name is O'Neill.
dialog: And you are...?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Klupner.
dialog: (teasing)
dialog: Mrs. Klupner.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: Mrs.?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I'm separated.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: Then there is a God. Why don't we
dialog: take that baby picture.
text: He takes the baby. He has a hard time taking his eyes off
text: her breasts. He places the baby on the blanket.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: If I were you, I'd breast feed until
dialog: I was 17 or 18.
dialog: (gets behind camera;
dialog: sizing up the shot)
dialog: Tell ya what...
scene_heading: O'NEILL'S POV THROUGH CAMERA
text: We SEE the baby sitting on the blanket.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL (O.S.)
dialog: Why don't you lean into the picture
dialog: with your child?
text: She coyly leans INTO FRAME.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL (O.S.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: A-huh. A little more... good!
text: She is totally blocking her baby out of the picture.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
text: He gets out from behind the camera.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: I'm getting one heck of a glare off
dialog: your dress there. Could you undo a
dialog: few buttons?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (seductively)
dialog: Of course.
text: She starts to unbutton her blouse. O'Neill looks into his
text: camera.
scene_heading: O'NEILL'S POV THROUGH LENS
text: We SEE the Woman finish her last button.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL (O.S.)
dialog: Now lean in a little more... more...
dialog: more...
text: As she complies, her breasts all but spill out of her dress.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL (O.S.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Hold that pose.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
text: He runs from behind the camera and poses with the woman.
scene_heading: THROUGH CAMERA LENS
text: We SEE a QUICK SERIES of camera flashes. Each pose finds him
text: near her breasts. He has them on his head. He's cheek to
dialog: breast. Etc.
speaker_heading: RICK
text: enters and witnesses the photo session. He immediately jumps
text: into the shots.
scene_heading: THROUGH CAMERA LENS
text: Rick joins the craziness. After several beats, the Woman
text: gets bored and EXITS the FRAME.
speaker_heading: THE WOMAN
text: As Rick and O'Neill continue mugging like two 12-year-olds
text: in a photo booth, the Woman takes her child and exits. A few
text: beats pass and the guys notice they're alone.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: Where'd she go?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: She probably had sex scheduled for
dialog: 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the
dialog: guys for a drink... I have major
text: news to announce.
text: O'Neill crosses to his camera and takes out the film.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: Okay... be right with ya.
speaker_heading: RICK
text: He picks up some photographs of today's work.
scene_heading: INSERT - PHOTOS
text: Each one has a different mother in several seductive poses.
text: Their babies are barely visible, if at all.
speaker_heading: RICK (O.S.)
dialog: Pictures a family will cherish
dialog: forever.
scene_heading: EXT. CHULO'S AUTO SHOP - DAY
text: Rick's school bus pulls into the yard of the auto shop.
text: Several Chicanos are working on various cars. Rick and O'Neill
dialog: hop out.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Hey, Chulo, where are you, man?
scene_heading: ANGLE - LATE-MODEL CAR
text: We SEE a very large pair of shoes sticking out from under
text: the chassis. Slowly, a large, bear-like body rolls out and
text: we catch our first glimpse of CHULO. A happy-go-lucky mechanic
dialog: of Mexican ancestry.
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: Hey, you guys, what's going on?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: We're going for a little liquid
text: refreshment.
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: Great. I'll go with you. Wait a
dialog: second. Hey, Raul! Move that car,
dialog: will you?
text: A SMALL MECHANIC with an eye patch gets into a car behind
text: them as we DOLLY WITH the guys THROUGH the lot.
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Roberto, you finished fixing that
dialog: lighter yet?
text: Another MECHANIC sticks his face out of another car and shakes
text: his head. Just then Raul, the eye-patched worker, whizzes by
text: behind the guys, driving the car in a zig-zag pattern right
text: into traffic.
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: (continuing; to Rick)
dialog: I'm glad you guys came by... What's
dialog: the occasion?
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: Rick's got an important announcement
dialog: to make.
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: Yeah. What is it?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I've decided not to run for President.
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: Too bad, man, that blows my chance
dialog: to be Ambassador to France.
text: Behind them we can SEE Roberto fiddling with the lighter.
text: Suddenly flames leap out of the car, blowing Roberto ten
text: feet into the air.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: The guys all start to pile into the bus. Nearby another
text: employee is washing down the garage with a hose.
text: Chulo turns to another mechanic, who has his head under the
text: hood of a car.
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: Manuel, be sure and finish up the
text: electrical system on that Chevy.
text: Manuel waves at Chulo, who turns, hops on the bus. Rick starts
text: it up and starts to drive away. Just as the bus CLEARS FRAME,
text: we SEE Manuel connect two wires together at the same moment
text: the guy with the hose washes down the area around his feet.
text: Manuel lights up like a Christmas tree, screaming in pain.
text: There is a beat, and then Robert falls INTO FRAME, still
text: holding the cigarette lighter, and the car Raul is driving
text: enters the lot and smashes into the side of the garage.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
text: A sign on an office door says "CONCERT TICKET AGENCY." From
text: inside we HEAR someone TALKING loudly on the phone. Chulo,
text: Rick and O'Neill open the door and go inside. On the walls
text: in the cramped office there are rock 'n' roll concert posters
text: advertising rock bands like Men At Work, The Clash and Barry
text: Manilow. Behind a cluttered desk we FIND a little man with a
text: thin mustache and horn-rimmed glasses. This is GARY MELNITZ,
text: wheeler-dealer, entrepreneur and coward. Gary yells a lot,
text: which is a definite overcompensation for his size and
dialog: inability to deal with the opposite sex.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: (yelling; into phone)
dialog: Screw you... Screw that... Don't
dialog: jerk me around. You promised me 1500
dialog: seats for the Police Concert... 1500,
dialog: not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw
dialog: you -- Screw Sting.
text: (hangs up and sees
dialog: the guys standing
dialog: there)
dialog: Hi, guys.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Gary, you're quite an animal.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Screw you...
text: The PHONE RINGS.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: (continuing; into
dialog: phone)
dialog: Hello, Concert tickets... What? Pat
dialog: Benitar has a yeast infection? She's
dialog: cancelling? Screw her. You know what
dialog: this is gonna cost me?...
dialog: (he hangs up)
dialog: Okay. Let's go.
text: He gets up and they start for the door. Just then the PHONE
text: RINGS. Gary picks it up.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: Screw you... That's crap... Suck
dialog: my...
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Oh, Mom, I didn't know it was you...
dialog: eggs and milk... Okay, I won't forget.
text: He hangs up the phone and they start for the door again.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Let's go.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Isn't he incredible, gets along with
dialog: everybody.
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: Yeah, he's really got his thing
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Oh, eat me!
text: The guys all laugh and exit.
scene_heading: INT. HARBORSIDE INN - DAY
text: It's a quiet restaurant near a Marina. A lot of business-
text: people in suits are eating.
scene_heading: TWO MALE CUSTOMERS
text: CUSTOMER ONE calls for a waiter.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER ONE
dialog: Waiter.
text: The WAITER approaches them from OUT OF FRAME.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER ONE
dialog: We'd like to order now.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: We see their waiter, RYKO, a blond, tanned, muscular beach
text: bum who has definitely stayed out in the sun too long.
speaker_heading: RYKO
dialog: How you guys doin'... Could you
dialog: believe how overcast it was this
dialog: morning? Bad day for sailin', waves
dialog: are too rough and...
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: You can skip the small craft warnings.
dialog: We're in a hurry.
speaker_heading: RYKO
dialog: No prob, bud... Here's today's
dialog: dealie...
text: He holds up a blackboard with the day's menu.
speaker_heading: RYKO
dialog: We got... uh, veal... ah... veal...
dialog: (to customer)
dialog: What's this word?
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER ONE
dialog: Parmisan.
speaker_heading: RYKO
dialog: Yeah right. I always want to say
dialog: Paramisian when I see that. We looked
text: at them under the jigamabob in biology
text: once. Little squirmy, creepy things
dialog: that live in your intestine and...
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: Please... We have an appointment in
dialog: a half hour...
speaker_heading: RYKO
dialog: Wow, sounds stressful. What do you
dialog: guys do for a living?
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER ONE
dialog: We're lawyers.
speaker_heading: RYKO
dialog: Whoa... You got to go to school for
dialog: that or what?
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: (he's had enough)
dialog: Look, forget the specials. We'll
dialog: take three hamburgers.
speaker_heading: RYKO
dialog: Okay, great... Any of you guys got a
dialog: pencil by any chance?
text: One of the customers shrugs and hands him a pen.
speaker_heading: RYKO
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: All right, a Bic... How 'bout a piece
dialog: of paper?
text: Ryko's customers look totally disgusted as Ryko's short
text: attention span is interrupted by something he sees O.S.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Rick and the guys appear in the bar.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Ryko. Come on!
text: They all disappear into the bar area.
speaker_heading: RYKO
dialog: Be right there.
dialog: (to customers)
dialog: Nice rappin' with you guys.
dialog: Unfortunately I'm outta here. Someone
dialog: else will have to help you.
dialog: (calling off)
dialog: Skip!
text: The customers are pleased to get rid of Ryko. SKIP enters.
text: He's a clone of Ryko.
speaker_heading: SKIP
dialog: Like um... What's the deal, you guys
dialog: gonna order?
text: The customers give each other a "Here we go again" look
scene_heading: ANGLE - THE GUYS
text: They're laughing uproariously and carrying on as Ryko comes
text: over and sits down.
speaker_heading: RYKO
dialog: Hi pals.
text: The guys acknowledge him.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's
dialog: the big announcement?
speaker_heading: ANGLE - RICK
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna
dialog: sugar-coat this thing. I've known
dialog: you guys since grade school, so I'm
dialog: gonna give it to you straight from
dialog: the hip... right from the shoulder...
dialog: without beating around the bush...
dialog: Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard
dialog: facts... tell it like it is.
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: Man, you're losing your audience.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Okay... This is it... I'm getting
dialog: married.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: You're kidding.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I don't believe it.
speaker_heading: RYKO
dialog: Fuck me!
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next,
dialog: I lose my amateur standing and turn
dialog: pro.
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: Hey, man, congratulations!
text: Chulo gets up and gives Rick a big bear hug... The other
text: guys shake his hand.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Wait a minute. You been living with
dialog: Debbie! Why do you want to get
dialog: married?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Because I love her. What can I tell
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: RYKO
dialog: You sure? This means no more partying.
speaker_heading: RICK
text: No more raping and pillaging, either.
dialog: You'll have to carry on without me.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Next Saturday... That's just two
dialog: more weeks to live.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: Hold it... As long as you're gonna
dialog: go through with this, the least we
dialog: can do is make sure you go out in
dialog: style.
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: (warming to this)
dialog: Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor
text: party with drugs, booze and broads.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: Yeah. Right. All the things that
dialog: make life worth living.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Sounds swell... I'm really touched.
dialog: And my getting married's not gonna
dialog: change a thing between me and my
dialog: pals. We're still gonna go bowling
dialog: on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays
dialog: and wear women's clothes on Sunday
dialog: night. I love you guys... I always
dialog: will.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Let's have a toast.
text: The guys all raise their glasses.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: To Rick.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: To us.
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: To girls with big pairs.
scene_heading: ALL THE GUYS
dialog: Yeah, right on, etc.
text: As they down their drinks, we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. THE JEAN MACHINE - DAY
text: We SEE a couple of very contemporary looking 15-year-olds
text: going into a very "now" clothing store -- like Fred Segal's...
text: When the door opens, loud ROCK 'N ROLL MUSIC blasts out.
scene_heading: INT. THE JEAN MACHINE - DAY
text: Inside the store we see all the sales clerks grooving
text: narcissistically to the music like they're at a disco. The
text: cashier, PHOEBE, has devoted her life to following the current
text: trends and fads no matter how inane they may be. Today she's
text: in a reggae mode, her hair wound into tight dreadlocks, as
text: she sways lost in the ozone to the music. A CUSTOMER
text: approaches her with a purchase.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: I'd like to pay for these.
speaker_heading: PHOEBE
dialog: Huh... What... Oh sure, wait till
text: this song is over.
text: She floats off again...
text: One of the young MALE CUSTOMERS approaches an attractive
text: salesgirl. This is DEBBIE THOMERSON, Rick's intended. She
text: seems to be the only sane employee in the place because she's
text: actually working, putting clothes on the racks. This
text: impression of sanity fits her, as she is level-headed, and
text: has a clear sense of herself. She can also take a joke, thus
dialog: her engagement to Rick.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: Excuse me, where can I try on these
dialog: pants?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Right over here.
text: She leads the Customer to the try-on booths. The Customer
text: enters one. We SEE that the saloon-style doors of the booths
text: have been hung too high, so as he takes off his pants, his
text: underwear is exposed to the world. We PULL BACK, REVEALING
text: other people in other booths, their bare asses clearly in
text: sight. No one in the store seems to care, however, as they
text: are much too busy dancing.
text: The front door opens and BOBBIE, a very sultry and earthy-
text: looking girl with long, dark hair, pushes inside. She is
dialog: O'Neill's girl and Debbie's best friend... She's also someone
dialog: who would party every night if given half a chance.
speaker_heading: BOBBIE
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so
text: excited.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Bobbie, what are you talking about?
speaker_heading: BOBBIE
dialog: O'Neill just tole me. It's sooo
dialog: great... I don't believe it.
text: Phoebe crosses to them.
speaker_heading: PHOEBE
dialog: What's happening?
speaker_heading: BOBBIE
dialog: Debbie's marrying Rick.
speaker_heading: PHOEBE
dialog: ...Really?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Yes, it's true.
speaker_heading: PHOEBE
dialog: Ohmygod.
text: The girls screech and jump around, hugging each other in
text: sheer joy. A MALE CUSTOMER, moved by this outpouring of
text: affection, moves over and gets in the middle of the girls,
text: enjoying every moment of being hugged by three women at once.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (to Customer; realizing)
dialog: Would you get out of here.
text: Reluctantly the guy retreats back to the Calvin Klein jeans
dialog: rack.
speaker_heading: BOBBIE
dialog: Does Cole know about this?
speaker_heading: PHOEBE
dialog: Really -- you went with him for two
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: He still thinks I'm going with him.
dialog: I'm going to break the news to him
dialog: tomorrow.
speaker_heading: BOBBIE
dialog: He's not gonna be happy. And your
dialog: parents can't be too thrilled either.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: No. As far as they're concerned the
dialog: only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I
dialog: don't care... it's my decision.
speaker_heading: PHOEBE
dialog: (oblivious)
dialog: I'm totally blown away. You're getting
dialog: married. It seems like only yesterday
dialog: I showed you how to have oral sex.
speaker_heading: BOBBIE
dialog: Deb, I want to throw you a shower.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Oh, that's really sweet. I'd love
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: PHOEBE
dialog: We'll invite all the girls.
speaker_heading: BOBBIE
dialog: I don't believe it... Mrs. Rick Stahl.
text: The girls all start to scream and carry on all over again.
scene_heading: INT. RICK AND DEBBIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Rick is cooking dinner in the cramped combination kitchen /
text: living room. He has about five dishes going at once as he
text: dashes from stove to refrigerator. He grabs some hamburger
text: meat, rolls it into a ball, then slaps it on the counter. He
text: then takes a steam iron and presses it on the patty.
text: Debbie comes in the front door and crosses to him and hugs
text: him tightly, kissing him sweetly.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (between kisses)
dialog: God, you're a slob.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: But a fabulous cook.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: What are we having?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or
dialog: charred flesh. I won't know till
dialog: it's finished.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (looking at the stove)
dialog: I think your dinner's burning.
text: Rick crosses to the stove. A small fire is coming out of one
text: of the frying pans. He douses it with water.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Don't worry... it's supposed to do
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (setting the table)
dialog: Want to hear something great? Bobbie
dialog: and Phoebe are throwing me a shower.
dialog: It's really gonna be fun.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Not as much fun as the bachelor party
dialog: the guys are throwing for me.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: You're going to have a bachelor party?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Of course. I'm a traditional guy...
dialog: It's a traditional event.
dialog: (he brings all the
dialog: food to the table)
dialog: Well, what do you think?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: It looks awful.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Yes, but looks are deceiving...
dialog: (takes a bite)
dialog: Not in this case, however.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Are you going to have women at your
dialog: party?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: No, sweetheart, it's a stag party.
dialog: Does stay home.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I'm not talking about does. I'm
text: talking about hookers.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Oh, those. Why do you ask?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Because from what I've heard, it's a
dialog: tradition and you're a traditional
dialog: guy.
text: Rick grabs her; starts kissing her passionately on the neck.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Deb, you is my woman now. I is yo
dialog: man. No painted lady ever gonna come
dialog: between us.
speaker_heading: DEB
dialog: I need you to promise.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Okay, you got it. I got a way we can
dialog: seal the deal -- what'd you say?
text: He grabs her. They kiss and slide down onto the table,
text: knocking the dishes to the floor.
scene_heading: EXT. BEL AIR-TYPE ESTATE - DAY
text: Through the iron gates of an impressive-looking estate comes
text: Debbie in her convertible VW Rabbit. She pulls up behind a
text: new Porsche 911 and a Jeep, all decked out with rifles, nets
text: and other hunting equipment. As she walks down the path toward
text: the house, she sees something off in the distance that
text: startles her.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE'S POV
text: A large brown grizzly bear appears to be entering the side
text: door of the house.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - DEBBIE
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (calling O.S.)
dialog: Cole?... Cole!
speaker_heading: DEBBIE'S POV
text: The "Bear" turns around. We SEE that the bear is, in fact,
text: dead. It is being carried by a tall, handsome HUNTER. He
text: waves to Debbie and indicates for her to follow him inside.
scene_heading: INT. COLE'S SMOKEHOUSE - DAY
text: Debbie opens a rustic-looking door and peers in.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Cole?
speaker_heading: COLE (O.S.)
dialog: Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
text: CAMERA PANS WITH Debbie as she enters the room. She passes
text: several trophies, guns and stuffed animal heads hanging from
text: the wall. She makes her way past some sections of an
text: undetermined animal's anatomy hanging from hooks suspended
text: from the ceiling. Finally we see COLE WHITTIER, a Steve Garvey
text: look-alike... rugged all-American, and heir to the Whittier
text: Plastic Wrap fortune. Despite his jockish good looks and
text: outward arrogance, there's something in his manner that is
text: definitely unsavory.
text: As Debbie approaches him we SEE that he is butchering some
text: unfortunate friend of the forest on the table in front of
dialog: him. (NOTE: For the squeamish, all of this is done OUT OF
dialog: FRAME. The only thing we should HEAR are the delightful SOUNDS
scene_heading: of TAXIDERMY.)
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Hi, Deb. Just got back from the
dialog: mountains.
text: (as he cuts in with a
dialog: surgeon's skill)
dialog: Isn't this a beauty?... It's gonna
dialog: look great in the den.
text: Debbie tries her best not to look down at what he's doing.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Cole, we've got to talk.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: No, Cole, I...
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (lifting an organ of
dialog: some sort O.S.)
dialog: It's all right, I forgive you. I'm
dialog: not the vengeful type. We'll forget
dialog: what happened. Why don't we take a
dialog: trip together? Maybe kill a few lions
dialog: in Kenya over Christmas.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Cole, listen to me... I've got to
dialog: tell you...
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You know, when you dumped me for
dialog: that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll
dialog: be back. God wants the two of you to
dialog: be together, and sure enough...
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (confused)
dialog: You're marrying him? Then why are
dialog: you coming back to me?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I'm not. I just thought I should
dialog: tell you myself before you heard it
text: somewhere else.
text: Cole stops what he is doing for a beat and just stares at
text: Debbie intensely. Then he returns to his work with a renewed
text: enthusiasm, chopping, slashing and slicing.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You know how that makes me feel,
dialog: Deb? Wanta know how that makes me
dialog: feel?
dialog: (softly)
text: Angry, Deb.
dialog: (a little louder)
dialog: Yesss, that's the word, angry. But
dialog: if he makes you happy, you go right
dialog: ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.
dialog: (a little nuts)
dialog: No matter what, no matter how angry
dialog: it makes me, no matter how much it
dialog: hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very,
text: very happy.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Cole, I'm sorry, I...
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: That's all right, Deb. Go be happy
dialog: and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (uncomfortable)
dialog: I'm going now, Cole.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy.
text: Debbie exits and we PUSH IN ON Cole. Something on his face
text: says, "Hi! I'm really out of my mind."
scene_heading: INT. DR. STAN STAHL'S OFFICE - DAY
text: DR. STAN is Rick's older brother and a proctologist. Although
text: he's only in his early thirties, he thinks and acts like
text: someone in their early 70's. A little on the pompous side,
text: Stan is never without his pipe.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Okay, Rick, hold out your arm.
text: He crosses to a sterile container and takes out a syringe.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: You wouldn't hurt your own brother,
dialog: would you?
dialog: (looking at the needle
dialog: cautiously)
dialog: I changed my mind. I don't need a
dialog: blood test. The marriage is off. I --
text: Just then, Stan sticks the needle in his arm.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You always were sneaky, Stan, very
dialog: sneaky.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Rick, marriage will be good for you.
dialog: It's done wonders for me.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: True, you're a lot handsomer now.
dialog: Don't you have enough blood already?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: (without much
dialog: conviction)
dialog: You won't miss a thing about being
dialog: single... The wild parties, the
dialog: different girls every night, running
dialog: around like a maniac... God, I miss
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I
dialog: didn't know you were going to fill
dialog: 'er up. Just take a couple of gallons,
dialog: okay?
text: Stan removes the needle and hands Rick a cotton ball.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: That's an even trade... a cotton
dialog: ball for all my blood.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: (returning to this
dialog: world)
dialog: Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't
dialog: wait for that bachelor party... I
dialog: need the action.
text: CAMERA FOLLOWS them as they go out into the hall.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Don't say anything to my wife about
dialog: it.
text: They pass an open examining room. Stan's wife, TINA, is also
text: a doctor and is examining an old man. She's not as tiny as
text: her name suggests. In face, she's more like over-sized.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Hi, Tina.
text: Rick moves to hug her and he notices that Tina has her finger
dialog: up the old guy's ass.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: Rick...
dialog: (to PATIENT)
dialog: Mr. Goldsmith, this is my brother-in-
dialog: law. He's getting married.
speaker_heading: PATIENT
dialog: (without turning around)
dialog: Congratulations.
text: Tina turns to a NURSE.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Nurse, will you take over?
text: The nurse shrugs and sticks her finger up the patient's rear

speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'm so happy for you.
text: Rick hugs her, uneasily trying to make sure her right hand
text: doesn't come anywhere near his face.
scene_heading: EXT. DEBBIE'S PARENTS' HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY
text: Debbie and Rick and her MOM and DAD are having a frustrating
text: game of tennis behind her parents' plush home. Mr. Thomerson
text: is a stockily-built guy in his fifties who prides himself on
dialog: being tough and competitive. His wife loves to shop. As far
text: as she's concerned, appearances are everything. Neither of
dialog: them likes Rick's appearance or anything else about their
text: future son-in-law. Mr. Thomerson slams the ball to Rick;
text: Rick slams the ball back and drives it over the fence, out
dialog: of the court.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Oops!
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: All right, who serves?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: You do, Daddy.
text: Mr. Thomerson serves the ball to Debbie, who hits it over
text: the net to her mother, who hits it to Rick, who slams it
text: over the fence, out of the court. Mr. Thomerson does not
text: look pleased.
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
dialog: Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You
dialog: don't have to kill it.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Can't I just maim it a little?
scene_heading: MRS. THOMERSON
dialog: Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
dialog: No. Let's at least finish the set.
text: Rick starts humming the "ABC Wide World of Sports" theme
text: loudly. Mr. T. gives him a disgusted look and serves the
text: ball. Rick smashes the ball and sends it over the fence, out
dialog: of the court.
scene_heading: EXT. THE THOMERSON'S NEIGHBORS' BACKYARD - DAY
text: A middle-aged COUPLE are sitting on some lawn furniture trying
text: to read the newspaper. A tennis ball comes down from the sky

speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: One of these days I'm gonna burn

scene_heading: EXT. THE THOMERSON'S - MEDIUM SHOT - DAY
text: Rick and Mr. Thomerson are having a heart to heart chat over
text: some lemonade in front of the tennis court.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Well, I have to admit my game's a
dialog: little rusty, but I love polo. It's
text: unrelenting, a constant challenge to
dialog: the senses. Really a beautiful
dialog: experience.
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
dialog: Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I'd love that.
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
dialog: (sitting on his anger)
dialog: Good. I think you're an asshole. No,
dialog: let me correct that, an immature
dialog: asshole. Which is fine, except you're
dialog: marrying my daughter and I'm afraid
dialog: my grandchildren are going to be
dialog: little assholes.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Mr. Thomerson, I...
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
dialog: Let me finish. Debbie's an adult.
dialog: She can do what she wants. But if
dialog: you want your marriage to last, you're
dialog: going to have to change some things
dialog: about yourself. If I may make some
dialog: suggestions...
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Feel free.
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
dialog: First, you're a slob. You have to
dialog: dress for success. Second, your
dialog: outlook on life...
text: As Mr. Thomerson drones on, Rick shifts uncomfortably in his

text: rear patio.
scene_heading: ANGLE - DEBBIE, MRS. THOMERSON AND ILENE
scene_heading: MRS. THOMERSON
dialog: I'm using the same caterer for the
dialog: shower I had for our Christmas party
dialog: last year.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Great, Mom.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: If I were you, I'd worry less about
dialog: the shower and more about Rick's
dialog: bachelor party.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Ilene, why would I want to do that?
dialog: I trust Rick.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Of course you do. I trusted my ex,
dialog: Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk
dialog: from experience. What do you think
dialog: they do at these parties, have tea
dialog: and play scrabble?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Ilene, Rick promised...
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs.
scene_heading: MRS. THOMERSON
dialog: (trying to change the
dialog: subject)
dialog: Girls, why don't we go inside for
dialog: lunch.
dialog: (calling to Mr. T)
dialog: Boys, would you mind bringing in
dialog: that lemonade?
scene_heading: ANGLE - MR. THOMERSON AND RICK
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
dialog: In a second...
dialog: (to Rick)
dialog: And you're irresponsible. Show some
dialog: initiative, try to better yourself,
dialog: stop showing off, actions speak louder
dialog: than words.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Well, sir, that's quite a list. But
dialog: you're absolutely right. And if I
dialog: work hard at it, I think I can be a
dialog: totally changed person by the time
dialog: we finish lunch...
text: Mr. Thomerson rolls his eyes, knowing he's been wasting his
text: breath. He grabs the pitcher of lemonade and Rick grabs the
text: tray, which is filled with fresh lemons. They get up at the
text: same time and collide, sending the lemonade all over Mr. T.,
text: and the lemons bounding over the fence.
scene_heading: EXT. THOMERSON'S NEIGHBORS' HOUSE

speaker_heading: COLE

speaker_heading: RICK

speaker_heading: MR. THOMERSON (O.S.)
dialog: So, Cole, you been practicing your

speaker_heading: COLE (O.S.)
dialog: Sure have...
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Why is Cole here?
scene_heading: MRS. THOMERSON

speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Yes, sir, I am.
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
dialog: Cole, I don't want you to give up on
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I've tried to change her mind.
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
dialog: It's not her mind you need to change.
text: It's Disneyland head in there.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: But how can I do that?
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
dialog: If it were me, I'd reason with him
dialog: first. Then, if that failed...
dialog: (with malice)
dialog: ...I'd take more persuasive action.
text: Mr. T. drills a wicked forehand shot straight at Cole, who
text: swings at it and misses.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (conspiratorily)
dialog: Thanks for the advise, sir.
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
dialog: Keep me informed.
text: PUSH IN ON Cole. This is a man with a plan...
scene_heading: EXT. PARK ON A BLUFF - DAY
text: The bluff overlooks the ocean. It's a beautiful spot. Just
text: the right setting for an outdoor wedding. Some folding chairs

text: Gathered for the rehearsal are Gary, Ryko, Chulo, O'Neill
text: who is with Bobbie, Debbie's mother and Mr. Thomerson, Phoebe,
text: Ilene, Tina, Stan, a gray-haired priest. FATHER FALWELL and,
text: of course, Rick and Debbie. Everyone is admiring this
text: picturesque setting. Everyone but Mr. Thomerson. He's very
text: underjoyed at the sight of Rick and his friends. Mr. and
text: Mrs. Thomerson are standing with Father Falwell. They are
text: watching Rick holding Debbie.
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
dialog: The thought of that person marrying
dialog: my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
scene_heading: MRS. THOMERSON
dialog: You can tell a man by his friends.
scene_heading: FATHER FALWELL
dialog: They're not such a bad bunch.
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
dialog: No?
dialog: (he points off)
text: That's his best man peeing on a tree.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: In the b.g. we SEE O'Neill's back TO US. He is definitely
text: relieving himself on a weeping willow. The wind begins to
dialog: pick up.
scene_heading: FATHER FALWELL
dialog: If everyone would take their
dialog: positions...
text: Everyone takes their places for the wedding procession. The
text: wind now takes this time to blow with much greater force. As
text: Father Falwell opens his Bible, the wind rips the pages out
text: of the Holy Book. They blow to the four corners of the Earth.
scene_heading: FATHER FALWELL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Oh, dear. Well, let's begin. And...
text: He hums the Wedding March. Chulo hums along. His humming is
text: a driving Jimi Hendrix-like guitar lick that all but drowns
text: out Father's humming.
scene_heading: FATHER FALWELL
text: He's orchestrating the proceedings.
scene_heading: FATHER FALWELL
dialog: Flower Girls... Now Rick...
text: (he gestures for him
dialog: to start down the
dialog: aisle)
dialog: Good... Debbie and Mr. Thomerson.
text: As he gestures for them to make their walk to him, a gust of
text: wind lifts up Father's cassock, exposing his bare ass. He
text: quickly grabs his cassock and covers himself.
speaker_heading: RICK
text: He begins to walk toward the priest. Suddenly, out of nowhere,
text: Cole appears at his side.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck
dialog: to see the groom before the wedding?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I want Debbie.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Cole...
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You dump her and I'll give you cash.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: What's Debbie's blue book value right
dialog: now?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Five thousand dollars.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: No.
text: They are now standing near Father Falwell. Debbie is

speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Seventy-five hundred.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Not interested.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster

dialog: A big mistake.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Thanks, Dad.

dialog: Cole, go away.
speaker_heading: COLE

speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (a la talk show host)
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, Cole Whittier.
dialog: Let's hear it for him -- a funny,
dialog: funny guy. We love ya, babe.
text: The wind suddenly picks up. A storm is coming in off the
text: sea. Father Falwell's cassock blows up again. It starts to
text: rain and hail. Everyone runs for cover but Rick and O'Neill.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (to O'Neill)
dialog: You think the gods are telling me
dialog: something?
scene_heading: INT. RICK AND DEBBIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I can't sleep.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Oh... I got something for that.

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Stop fooling around... I need to

speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I don't know... I just feel scared.
speaker_heading: RICK

speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Good...
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Um... that's very relaxing.

speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You want to share it?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Right.
text: He pops it in his mouth.
scene_heading: EXT. TERMINAL
text: The guys exit the Baggage Area. Rick is pushing Larry who is
text: sprawled out on top of his bags in a luggage cart.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: My marriage is the worst. All crap.
text: A big pile of shit.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Maybe your marriage should lay off
text: grains for a while.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: She hates me. It's over. You'll see,
dialog: as soon as you get married, everything
dialog: changes. You sure you want to go
dialog: through with it, man?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (his interest peaked)
dialog: What do you mean, it changes?
text: Before Larry can answer they reach the bus where Debbie is
text: waiting for them.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (hugging Larry)
dialog: Larry, how are you?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Hi, Debbie, congratulations. Hey, do
dialog: you know where there's a pharmacy
dialog: around here so I can get a
dialog: prescription filled?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Come on, get him on the bus.
text: As a couple of the guys pick Larry up and carry him into the
dialog: bus we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BUS - DUSK
text: Rick is driving the bus with Debbie sitting next to him in
text: the driver's seat. The guys sit in the row of seats behind
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Well... twenty-four more hours to go
dialog: and tonight we'll share with our
dialog: friends and loved ones the joys of
text: those last moments of singleness.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: You better not have too much joy.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Wouldn't think of it. Because
dialog: tomorrow...
dialog: (starts singing)
dialog: We're going to the chapel and we're...
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Gonna get married...
scene_heading: ANGLE - THE GUYS
text: They start to join in the song in a little less than perfect
dialog: harmony.
speaker_heading: EVERYBODY
dialog: Going to the chapel and we're gonna
dialog: get married.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Gee, I really love you...
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: And we're gonna get ma-a-a-ried.
speaker_heading: EVERYBODY
dialog: (whooping it up)
text: Going to the chapel of love.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah.
scene_heading: EXT. BUS
text: The bus zooms down the street.
speaker_heading: EVERYBODY (V.O.)
text: Going to the chapel of love.
scene_heading: EXT. THOMERSON'S - DUSK
text: Rick's bus comes up to the driveway in front of the house
text: and stops.
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S BUS - DUSK
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: This is it, lady. Last stop.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Can't I just go with you guys?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Sorry, we got men's business to do.
dialog: It's no place for a lady.
text: He opens the door, picks Debbie up and carries her out to
text: the sidewalk.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Remember, you promised... no screwing
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Did I promise that? I don't remember
dialog: that...
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: You're really pissing me off.
text: She grabs Rick and wraps her arm around him in a playful
text: headlock.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Okay, I promise... I swear on my
text: mother's grave.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Your mother's not dead.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Well, if I go back on my word, I'll
dialog: kill her.
text: Debbie lets go of his neck.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Have a good time. Don't make it too
dialog: late.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun
dialog: shower. Use soap.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I love you.
text: They kiss, and the guys whistle in the background. Then Debbie
text: starts toward the house and Rick hops back into the bus. He
text: gets into the seat and sits there for a moment, watching
text: Debbie with a guilty look as she goes into the house.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: (to Rick)
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (snapping out of it)
dialog: Nothing... Let's get crazy!
speaker_heading: RYKO
dialog: All right!
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: When do the girls get to the party?
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: Don't worry, Gary's taking care of
dialog: that now.
text: The guys holler and whoop it up as Rick puts the bus in gear
text: and takes off down the street.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. GRIMY STREET CORNER - EVENING
text: JUMBO, a well-dressed behemoth in a sky blue suit and
text: widebrimmed hat, is standing on a street corner talking to
dialog: Gary.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: So we want your best girls, the cream
dialog: of your crop.
speaker_heading: JUMBO
dialog: Let's see your bread.
text: Gary takes out a roll of bills, which Jumbo grabs and quickly
dialog: counts.
speaker_heading: JUMBO
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Okay, I got just what you're looking
dialog: for.
dialog: (calling off)
dialog: Margot... Darlene...
text: Two shapely HOOKERS in tight-fitting clothes come up to them.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: They'll do just fine. Hiya, girls.
dialog: Look, after the orgy, maybe we could
dialog: have coffee.
text: The girls look at him with "Is he for real?" in their eyes.
speaker_heading: JUMBO
dialog: Shorty, where's the party?
text: Gary takes some slips of paper out of his pocket and hands
dialog: Jumbo one.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
speaker_heading: JUMBO
dialog: They'll be up there in a half hour.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Okay. Nice to meet you both.
text: Gary turns, almost collides with a garbage can, and starts
text: walking down the street. He passes a parked Porsche. After a
text: beat, Cole Whittier sticks his head up and watches Gary walk
text: off. Then he hops out of his car and approaches Jumbo and
dialog: the girls.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Hi. I must have just missed my friend.
dialog: He hired you for a bachelor party.
speaker_heading: JUMBO
text: At the Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
dialog: What about it.
text: Cole's face lights up. This is the information he needed.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Yeah. Right.
dialog: (takes out piece of
dialog: paper)
dialog: This is the new address. We changed
dialog: our minds and decided to send the
text: girls over to his house instead.
text: He takes out a fifty-dollar bill.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: And here's a fifty... I want this to
dialog: be a surprise, so you never saw me,
dialog: okay?
speaker_heading: JUMBO
dialog: (pocketing the money)
dialog: No problem.
text: Cole smiles happily as he slithers back to his car.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Now she'll see what kind of jackoff
dialog: he is.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - HOTEL
text: A parking VALET crosses to the bus as Rick hands him the
dialog: keys.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Be careful with it. It's a rental.
text: The guys hop out with the enthusiasm of a home team that's
text: just won the state championship. They race in the front door.
text: A banner over the door reads: "WELCOME MISS MOOSEHEAD BEER
dialog: PAGEANT."
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
dialog: This is a pretty plush place. The kind of hotel that prides
text: itself on its classy image. The guys are totally unaware of
text: the sedate atmosphere in the lobby as they go screaming toward
dialog: the elevators.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: (to some dignified
dialog: guests)
dialog: We who are about to go ape shit salute
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: RYKO
dialog: All right, I'm stoked!
text: Just as they are about to get into the elevator, a hand comes
text: INTO FRAME and holds the door so it will not close.
text: WIDEN TO INCLUDE the MANAGER. All their carrying-on stops
text: when the guys see him staring grimly at them. If he wasn't a
dialog: hotel manager, he'd be a mortician. He has a constant
text: expression on his face that suggests he's constantly sucking
dialog: lemons.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Just where do you guys think you
dialog: are?
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: The Library of Congress?
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: Detroit?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Beyond the sun?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Are any of those right?
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the
dialog: Hotel Manager. Are you looking for
dialog: someone?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Yes, you. We're looking for our
dialog: room... 1002.
text: Rick takes out his key.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
text: It's on the tenth floor.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: What do you know, they moved it.
dialog: Catch you later.
text: The door starts to close and the guys start yelling.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Keep your voices down. This is a
dialog: respectable establishment. We don't
dialog: go for any funny business here. Just
text: then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat
text: and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass
text: him and enter the elevator with the
dialog: boys.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I see what you mean... You're a
dialog: beautiful guy. And you're doing a
dialog: damn good job.
text: The door slams shut before the Manager can say anything else.
scene_heading: INT. THE THOMERSON'S - NIGHT
text: Several of Debbie's friends have arrived and are chatting
text: amiably in the living room. Phoebe is dipping potato chips
text: into a bowl that says "Muffy" on it.
speaker_heading: PHOEBE
dialog: Do you have any more of this dip,
dialog: Mrs. Thomerson? It's really excellent.
scene_heading: MRS. THOMERSON
dialog: You just ate Purina Cat Chow.
speaker_heading: PHOEBE
dialog: Gross me out...
text: Debbie comes into the living room and sits next to Bobbie.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: What do you think's gonna go on at
dialog: the guys' party?
speaker_heading: BOBBIE
dialog: They'll probably get drunk, and watch
dialog: dirty movies. But don't worry about
dialog: the dirty movies.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: BOBBIE
dialog: I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I
text: found a bunch of pornos in the back
text: seat of O'Neill's car.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: You're kidding.
speaker_heading: BOBBIE
dialog: Nah. Everything's cool... I took
dialog: care of 'em.
dialog: (starts to giggle)
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Rick, Ryko, O'Neill, Chulo, Larry and Stan are walking down
text: the hallway, looking for their room.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: 1004, 1003...
dialog: (spots the room)
dialog: Aha! 1002.
text: The guys give out a hearty cheer as they huddle around the
text: door. O'Neill grabs the doorknob. He takes his time, playing
dialog: up the moment.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: And now...
text: The guys lean forward, anticipating the opening of the gates
dialog: of heaven.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ...to our honored guest Rick, and
dialog: his life-long friends, I say...
dialog: (turns the doorknob)
dialog: ...gentlemen, start your boners.
text: He flings open the door and everyone but he and Rick burst
text: into the room.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
text: The guys all but dive into the room. It is a two-room suite
text: with living room/kitcheonette and separate bedroom. The room
text: has been decorated with balloons. A sign reads: "Happy
text: Bachelor Party!" It looks far from professionally decorated.
text: Chulo frantically checks out the rooms.
speaker_heading: RYKO
dialog: Bitchin' place.
text: He hangs a chin-up bar in a doorway and starts to chin
dialog: himself.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: I did the balloons myself.
text: He takes a prophylactic out of a Trojan carton. He blows it
text: up. On closer examination, we SEE all the balloons are
text: inflated prophylactics.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Chulo returns from his search of the rooms.
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: (crazed)
dialog: Where's the women, man? We gotta
dialog: have women.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: Chulo, one thing at a time.
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: What's first?
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
text: A bit of a warm-up.
text: He threads a film projector.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos
dialog: Without Pants"...
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Olivier's in that, right?
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
text: Then it's on to the real thing.
speaker_heading: GUYS
dialog: (cheering)
dialog: All right!
text: Ryko flips off the lights as O'Neill puts the projector into
text: forward and the title flashes on a movie screen. All the
text: guys yell in anticipation.
scene_heading: HOME MOVIE SCREEN
text: We SEE a man stepping out of a shower. He puts on his robe
text: and exits the bathroom. To his surprise and to the delight
text: of our guys, two young, beautiful Nordic looking women,
text: dressed in micro-minis and see-through blouses stand waiting
dialog: for him.
speaker_heading: CHULO (O.S.)
dialog: They're Danish, I know it. I'm crazy
dialog: for Danes.
speaker_heading: RYKO AND CHULO
text: sit watching the screen.
speaker_heading: RYKO
dialog: (to Chulo)
dialog: Denmark makes great Nautilus
dialog: equipment.
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: I'd like to jerk and press those
dialog: babies.
scene_heading: RICK AND O'NEILL
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (to O'Neill)
dialog: And I thought we wouldn't have any
text: meaningful conversation.
speaker_heading: ON SCREEN
text: The man takes off his robe. The girls start to seductively
text: undress.
speaker_heading: GUYS (O.S.)
dialog: (excitedly)
dialog: All right, yeah, yeah, yeah...
text: Suddenly an abrupt jump cut. The girls are undressed and
text: lying on top of the man. Our guys are seriously let down.
speaker_heading: GUYS
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: Awwww...
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
text: He can't figure it out.
scene_heading: ON THE SCREEN
text: As the women kiss the man from his head slowly down his chest,
text: past his navel and heading south...
speaker_heading: GUYS
text: Their eyes start to widen like a child in a Keene painting.
speaker_heading: GUYS
dialog: Yes, go, go, yes, go...
scene_heading: ON THE SCREEN
text: Another abrupt jump cut spliced together with what looks
text: like a band-aid, and the girls are sitting on the side of
text: the bed. The man is recovering from the best sex he's ever
dialog: encountered.
speaker_heading: GUYS
speaker_heading: GUYS
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: Awwwwww...
text: Rick turns to a shocked O'Neill.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Excuse me, but this is as arousing
text: as a stroll through the Vatican.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: This isn't right.
speaker_heading: GUYS' POV
text: They watch the screen. The two women seem to be taking a
text: liking to each other. They begin to fall onto the bed and
dialog: entwine.
speaker_heading: GUYS
dialog: Please, yes, do it, yes, yes, oh
dialog: yes...
text: A jump cut and they are dressing. Stan can't take it anymore.
text: He jumps to his feet.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Where are the dirty parts? I'm a
dialog: doctor. I can see these things.
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: What a waste of two women.
text: O'Neill rises abruptly.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: I don't get it, but at least Gary's
dialog: got the real stuff coming up here in
text: a few minutes.
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: (in ecstasy)
dialog: Women!
text: Everyone cheers.
scene_heading: INT. THOMERSON HOUSE
text: The girls are having a great time. The front DOORBELL RINGS.
text: Mrs. Thomerson answers it. Standing in the doorway is Tina
text: Stahl, Stan's wife; she's late for the shower. Behind her
text: are two obvious hookers: Margot and Darlene. Tina doesn't
dialog: know either of the girls.
scene_heading: MRS. THOMERSON
dialog: Yes?
text: Before Tina can speak, Margot speaks up. She's reading from
text: the piece of paper Cole gave her.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (through heavy gum
dialog: chewing)
dialog: Yeah, hi. Look, is this...
scene_heading: INSERT - PIECE OF PAPER
text: Margot reads the address.
speaker_heading: MARGOT (O.S.)
dialog: 838 North Franek Avenue?
text: BACK TO SCENE
scene_heading: MRS. THOMERSON
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: We're here.
scene_heading: MRS. THOMERSON
dialog: How nice.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: I'm Tina Stahl.
scene_heading: MRS. THOMERSON
dialog: Of course. Stan's wife... Everyone
dialog: come in.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE - THE STREET
text: Cole sits in his car and watches happily as the hookers go
dialog: inside.
scene_heading: INT. THOMERSON'S LIVING ROOM
text: Debbie spots Tina. She is oblivious to the two hookers.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Tina!
text: They give each other a big hug. The hookers watch closely.
text: Debbie leads Tina to the other women.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You know everyone here, don't you?
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Yes.
text: The girls hug and give big hellos. Meanwhile, Margot and
text: Darlene have come to the conclusion they've been hired for a
text: kinky scene.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: One of these, huh?
speaker_heading: DARLENE
dialog: Looks that way.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Buck's a buck.
text: They start to unbutton their coats.
text: Tina hands Debbie her present.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: It's so heavy.
text: She sits and the girls gather around as she starts to open
dialog: the gift.
text: Phoebe happens to look off and is stunned by what she sees.
text: The others are curious at what she is looking at and they
text: too stare O.S., stunned to silence.
scene_heading: MARGOT AND DARLENE
text: dressed in leather and mesh stockings. Margot carries a whip.
text: Darlene is holding a phallic electrical device.
speaker_heading: DARLENE
dialog: (business-like)
dialog: Is there an empty outlet in here?
text: Debbie unconsciously points to a nearby wall. Margot and
text: Darlene stand amidst the girls. Darlene plugs in her device.
text: She and Margot start to embrace and fondle one another. The
text: girls watch in stony silence. Dumbfounded at what they see.
text: Margot and Darlene start to sink to the floor, OUT OF OUR
text: SIGHT. Before they disappear, we see Margot take out her gum
text: and park it on an end table. Now OUT OF SIGHT, the girls
text: watch for a beat. Then we hear the WHIRRING of Darlene's
text: implement. Our girls screech in horror and hold onto one
text: another in a protective clump.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE
text: The guys are sitting around drinking, eating and looking
text: generally bored. Chulo sits in front of the TV, glumly
text: watching an old "I Love Lucy" re-run.
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: If I was Ricky Ricardo I would beat
dialog: the shit out of that chick.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (totally ripped,
text: staring at the black
dialog: and white image)
dialog: Wow! The colors are sooo beautiful.
text: Chulo gives him a strange look.
speaker_heading: RYKO
dialog: (opening a beer,
dialog: reading the label)
dialog: Isn't there any beer that's not
dialog: imported? All this stuff's from St.
dialog: Louis.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (calling to imaginary
dialog: person O.S.)
dialog: Bartender, round of brains for my
dialog: friend here.
text: Gary enters the room. He's all smiles. Confident he's done a
dialog: great job arranging for the entertainment.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: How's it going, guys?
text: Everyone crowds around him like children greeting Daddy.
text: Looking for candy hidden in his coat.
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: Where's the girls? Where's the girls?
text: Rick pushes them away from Gary like a referee separating
dialog: two fighters.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Give the guy air. Everyone to a
dialog: neutral corner.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: Nothing. We got no women.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Screw you.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: It's true.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: This place should have been wall to
text: wall tits by now.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (to O'Neill)
text: Guy paints a beautiful picture.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I'm going to see what the hell
dialog: happened.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Looks like the only one who got
dialog: screwed here was you.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Screw that.
text: He exits out the door.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: So, what do you guys think of the
dialog: party so far?
text: The guys toss sandwiches and empty beer cans at him.
speaker_heading: RICK
text: (putting his arm around
dialog: O'Neill)
dialog: Well, I think you've done a damn
dialog: fine job.
text: Everyone pelts Rick and O'Neill with more junk.
text: Suddenly the door bursts open. The guys look up and are
text: surprised to see Cole enter.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Rick, I want to talk to you.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Ah, Cole.
dialog: (turns to the others)
dialog: I don't remember ordering an asshole
dialog: from room service.
text: Cole enters, closing the door behind him.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I don't want any trouble.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Oh, come on, just a little.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I'm ready to make you another deal.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (mock excitement)
dialog: Ooh, be still, my heart.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (points out window)
dialog: See that down there? That's my most
dialog: prized possession. My new Porsche.
speaker_heading: RICK'S POV
text: Cole's Porsche parked in the hotel parking lot.
speaker_heading: RICK (O.S.)
dialog: Very nice...
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Rick gestures to Chulo to look out the window.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (his voice tells us
dialog: he has something in
dialog: mind)
dialog: Isn't that a great car, Chulo?
text: Chulo gets Rick's drift.
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: Yeah... real nice. Ah, excuse me.
dialog: I'll be right back.
text: He starts to exit. Before he does, he grabs a hanger out of
dialog: the closet.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Great car.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: The best.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I love that car.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I'm very happy for you two.
text: They back away from the window.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie.
dialog: An even swap.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: The car for Debbie?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (getting a little
dialog: excitable)
dialog: I mean it. The car is yours. Dump
dialog: Debbie.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Gee, guys, what should I do? The car
dialog: or Debbie?
text: All the guys treat this as if it's "Let's Make A Deal". They
text: take sides, yelling out, "Take the car," "Keep Debbie." Over
text: the din we hear a befuddled Rick.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What a decision here.
text: He walks over to the window. Cole follows closely. He's trying
text: to convince Rick to take the car.
speaker_heading: COLE
text: Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: So does Debbie.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Chulo is using the hanger to jimmy the car lock on Cole's
text: Porsche. He's successful. He jumps into the car and drives
dialog: off.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE
text: Rick and Cole are at the window. The guys are still trying
text: to convince Rick on his decision.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I got the car only two months ago --
dialog: it's got --
text: As he looks out the window we see with him that his car is
dialog: gone.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's
dialog: gone!
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Maybe it had something to do.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Shit!
text: He charges out of the room.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
text: Odd. He's only been gone a few seconds
dialog: and I already miss him.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET CORNER - NIGHT
text: Gary spots Jumbo on the same grimy street corner. He's pimping
text: for one of his ladies and makes a sale to an anxious young
text: Marine as Gary approaches him.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
speaker_heading: JUMBO
dialog: What are you talking about, asshole?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Your whores never showed up.
speaker_heading: JUMBO
text: They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Screw you!
text: Jumbo has had enough. He backs Gary against a wall and pulls
text: a knife on him.
speaker_heading: JUMBO
dialog: (irritated; a lot)
dialog: That's it, prick lips.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: What are you...
speaker_heading: JUMBO
dialog: I've had it, numb nuts... How much
dialog: money you got?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: JUMBO
dialog: Because I'm pissed off. Now give me
dialog: your cash.
text: Gary hurriedly digs into his pockets and gives Jumbo his
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: This is bad public relations. I was
dialog: planning to do a lot of business
dialog: with you. But now I'm going to have
dialog: to go elsewhere.
speaker_heading: JUMBO
dialog: (mock sincerity)
dialog: Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll
dialog: give you girls.
text: He snaps his fingers and TWO of his LADIES come forward.
speaker_heading: JUMBO
dialog: (continuing; to girls)
dialog: Give him the works.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: That's more like it.
text: The girls walk over to Gary and proceed to beat the crap out
dialog: of him.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIPPENDALE'S - NIGHT
text: It is a garish nightclub. A large lighted billboard proclaims
text: "ALL MALE... ALL NUDE." Two cars pull into the parking lot.
text: Debbie and all of her shower guests get out.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Are you sure this is a good idea?
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Look, you heard what those hookers
dialog: said. They were supposed to go to a
dialog: bachelor party.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can
dialog: have women, we can have men.
speaker_heading: BOBBIE
dialog: (agreeing)
dialog: Yeah.
scene_heading: MRS. THOMERSON
dialog: (reluctantly)
dialog: I don't know about this.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: C'mon, Mother, it'll be fun.
text: The girls giggle as they enter the place, with Mrs. Thomerson
text: following reluctantly behind.
scene_heading: INT. CHIPPENDALE'S - NIGHT
speaker_heading: PHOEBE
dialog: Look at that guy. What a hunk.
speaker_heading: BOBBIE
text: Check out the other guy's buns.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Let's sit over here.
text: They head for some empty tables. Debbie notices her mother
text: is still standing transfixed by the MAN on display on stage.
text: Debbie grabs her by the shoulder.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: C'mon, Mom.
text: On the way to the table they pass MICHAEL, the bartender,
text: who looks at them and immediately recognizes Debbie. Finding
text: this interesting, he picks up a phone and dials.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (softly; into phone)
dialog: Yes... is there a Rick Stahl
dialog: registered there?
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE
text: Gary, beaten up, his clothes ripped, stands amidst the guys.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Hookers beat you up?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I didn't know you were into that.
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: How could you be so stupid. I'm gonna
dialog: kill you.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Go ahead, but if you want women, we
dialog: need more money.
speaker_heading: RYKO
dialog: This just isn't righteous.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: (angered)
dialog: Screw you... Do me a favor, join
dialog: this decade, will ya, pal!
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (as if he's working a
dialog: fundraiser)
dialog: Hey, now, our buddy needs help. Come
dialog: on, dig into those pockets. Help
dialog: this man.
text: (puts his arm around
dialog: Gary)
dialog: Help this person help others get
dialog: laid. Give till it hurts. He needs
dialog: you.
text: The guys take out money. Larry stands and digs into his pocket
text: for his wallet. Along with the wallet comes dozens of pills.
text: The PHONE RINGS.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: And there's our first pledge coming
dialog: in --
text: Rick picks up the receiver.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Hello. End Horniness Telethon. Yeah.
dialog: Michael... how you doing?
scene_heading: INT. CHIPPENDALE'S - MICHAEL
text: He's standing behind the bar.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'm working... Right. At
dialog: Chippendale's. Guess what. Debbie
text: and her friends just walked in.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Really? That's very interesting.
dialog: (he brightens)
dialog: I'll tell you what... stay there and
dialog: we'll be right down. I want to check
dialog: this out.
text: He hangs up the phone. Gary, meantime, has collected his
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I'll be back with women.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I might as well have left my genitals
dialog: at home, the good they're doing me
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: (calling after Gary)
dialog: Hurry back.
text: Gary exits.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (it's obvious he has
dialog: something in mind)
dialog: While we're waiting for Gar, why
dialog: don't we all go for a little fresh
dialog: air.
speaker_heading: RYKO
dialog: Where we going?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Out.
text: The guys start toward the door.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (zonked and depressed)
dialog: Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I just want to be alone.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: All right. Now, there's milk and
dialog: cookies in the refrigerator. Go to
text: bed right after "Falcon Crest."
text: As Larry slumps on the couch, the guys exit.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL
text: Rick and the guys exit the hotel. As they exit, Mr. Thomerson
text: enters. Both parties are oblivious to the other's presence.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL
text: Mr. Thomerson is greeted by a Moosehead Beer EXECUTIVE who
text: is wearing a straw hat that says "Moosehead Beer."
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: Ed, we're so glad you could come
text: over at the last minute and judge
dialog: our little beauty pageant.
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
dialog: My pleasure, Al... Always happy to
text: help out in a pinch...
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: Excuse me. I better call my service...
dialog: tell them where I am.
text: He enters a phone booth and starts to dial.
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
dialog: (to executive, covering
dialog: mouthpiece)
dialog: I had to get out of the house anyway
text: tonight. The wife is throwing a bridal
dialog: shower for my daughter.
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: This is Ed Thomerson. Please transfer
dialog: my calls to...
dialog: (reading number off
dialog: phone)
dialog: 220-1892. Right.
text: He crosses with executive toward the ballroom.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: Congratulations on your daughter's
dialog: wedding. Who's she marrying?
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
text: A real turd.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: (at a loss for words)
dialog: Well... hope she'll be very happy.
text: They exit into ballroom.
scene_heading: INT. CHIPPENDALE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Amidst the kitchen activities we SEE Rick, O'Neill, Ryko,
dialog: Stan, and Michael.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: So will your friend Nick do it?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: He'll do anything for money.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I love his attitude.
dialog: (calling off)
dialog: They still out there?
speaker_heading: STAN
text: He's peeking through the kitchen door. We SEE Debbie and the
text: shower girls whooping it up at a ringside table. Stan turns
text: back to Rick.
speaker_heading: STAN
text: Breathing heavy at ringside.
text: He joins the other guys.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (a la Long John Silver)
dialog: So, they want action, eh? Are you
dialog: with me, me hardies?
text: The guys shout approval as NICK, one of the male dancers,
text: enters carrying a tray of food. Nick is a muscled hunk.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Guys, this is Chippendale's star
dialog: attraction, Nicholas Carter... better
dialog: known as Nick the Dick.
speaker_heading: RYKO
dialog: Nick the what?
text: Nick drops his pants. Since he's being SHOT only from the
text: WAIST UP, we can't see what the guys see.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (proudly)
dialog: The Dick.
scene_heading: ALL OUR GUYS
dialog: (astonished at this
dialog: O.S. sight)
dialog: Jesus Christ!
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Let's get this thing going. Tray,
dialog: please.
text: Nick holds the tray waist high. Rick arranges the food.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Looks good. Can I have the bun,
dialog: Michael?
text: Michael hands Rick a hot dog bun. Rick places it on the tray.
text: He turns to Nick.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: And now, Nick... or is it Mr. Dick?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Nick.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Nick, if you would be so kind...
speaker_heading: NICK
text: He holds the tray with one hand. With the other he reaches
text: OUT OF FRAME. In a nutshell, what he does is place his honker
text: in the hot dog bun. As he slaps his business into the bun,
dialog: we HEAR a solid THUMP.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Nick, the rest is all yours.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (excusing himself)
dialog: Gentlemen.
text: He exits. As he does, our guys crowd around and peek through
text: the kitchen door.
speaker_heading: NICK
text: We FOLLOW him as he approaches the girls' table.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: If you ladies would like to serve
dialog: yourselves...
text: The girls grab their orders. Mrs. T. is last. Hers is the
text: hot dog. She points to it.
scene_heading: MRS. THOMERSON
dialog: Is this the foot long?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: And then some.
text: Mrs. T. grabs the hot dog. It won't come off the tray. She
text: yanks harder. Nick drops the tray and Mrs. T. finally comes
text: to realize what she is pulling on. She screams in terror.
text: Because of sheer fright, she can't seem to drop Nick's schlong
text: from her grip. The rest of our ladies look to see Mrs. T. 's
text: hot dog. They scream in shock. Debbie spits out her
text: marguerita, hitting Phoebe in the face.
speaker_heading: OUR GUYS
text: They are busting a gut watching the girls' reactions.
speaker_heading: ILENE
text: She looks up just in time to see the
text: guys close the kitchen door.
speaker_heading: MRS. T
text: still frozen in a state of shock. The girls try to pry her
text: hands off.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET CORNER
text: Several HOOKERS are standing around. Gary approaches them.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Ladies... come here.
speaker_heading: HOOKER
dialog: Talk to the pimp.
text: She gestures to a MAN with his back TO US.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Let's talk.
text: The PIMP turns around and we SEE he is the stereotypical
dialog: pimp. One big difference: he's an Indian straight from the
text: streets of Calcutta. He's soft-spoken and ever smiling and
text: he still hasn't quite mastered English.
speaker_heading: RAJAH
dialog: (oh-so-heavy Indian
dialog: accent)
dialog: What can I be doing for you?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: You're a pimp?
speaker_heading: RAJAH
dialog: I'm telling you I am, Joe.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I want women.
speaker_heading: RAJAH
dialog: That I got. Very good women. They
dialog: sit on your face, anything you want.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I'll take some.
speaker_heading: RAJAH
dialog: Big problem now. Soon they go to
dialog: customers.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I need them for a bachelor party at
dialog: the Park View Hotel.
speaker_heading: RAJAH
dialog: You are being in luck. Customers in
dialog: same hotel. I let you have them at
dialog: cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
speaker_heading: RAJAH
dialog: Not one minute longer or Milt will
dialog: come for you.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Milt?
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: MILT joins them. Milt is a massive hulk. A bearded exbiker.
text: He could have come out of an MX silo. A menacing mountain of
text: a man decked out in a cowboy hat.
speaker_heading: RAJAH
dialog: This being Milt.
text: Milt casually takes off his hat and immediately sticks his
text: face through a nearby window, smashing it to pieces. He pulls
text: his head out, smiles and puts his hat back on.
speaker_heading: RAJAH
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Girls back in 45 minutes or Milt
dialog: cuts your balls off. Fair enough?
dialog: Shake!
text: Gary extends his hand and they shake.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: (to himself as he
text: walks to his car)
dialog: I just bet my balls and shook on it.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT
text: The guys are piling back out of the bus into the hotel. The
text: Manager watches them suspiciously.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE
text: Rick, O'Neill, Ryko and Stan come back into the room.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (concerned; calling
dialog: O.S.)
dialog: Larry! Yo, Larry.
text: Rick crosses to the bathroom door, opens it and goes in.
speaker_heading: RICK'S POV
text: Larry is on his knees on the side of the tub with his head
text: submerged fully under several inches of water.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Larry comes out of the water. He gasps for breath and speaks.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I'm killing myself.
text: He takes a deep breath and submerges his head again. Rick
text: unplugs the tub and it begins to drain.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Larry... you've got to lighten up.
dialog: You and the wife can work it out.
text: The water has drained from the tub, leaving Larry high and
text: dry. He lifts his head out of the tub. In his state, he's
text: unaware that the water is gone. He gasps for air as Rick
text: holds him up.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Lar... sometimes when people are mad
dialog: they say things they don't mean.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: No, she hates me... I want to end
dialog: everything here... now.
text: Larry takes a deep breath and plunges his head into the tub.
text: His head hits the waterless tub bottom with a loud THUD. He
text: goes limp from the concussion. His body drapes into the tub,
text: head first.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Yeah, I guess so.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon,
dialog: let's party.
text: Larry gets up and exits the room. PUSH IN ON Rick. He looks
text: after Larry, concerned.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: He ain't all right.
scene_heading: ANGLE - THE LOBBY
text: Cole sits in a phone booth holding the receiver impatiently.
text: ANGLE WIDENS TO REVEAL THE ADJOINING PHONE BOOTH
text: The receiver is off the hook. After a beat, Mr. T. crosses
text: to the phone. Cole does not see him, and vice versa.
speaker_heading: MR. T
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Mr. Thomerson.
speaker_heading: MR. T
dialog: Yes, son, did you find out where the
dialog: bachelor party is?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Yes I did.
speaker_heading: MR. T
dialog: Fine. How's everything going?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Not so good. He wouldn't listen to
dialog: reason. He stole my car... my
dialog: Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
dialog: So, he's playing hard ball. Well,
dialog: two can play that game.
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Go after him. Stop at nothing. You
dialog: hear me?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear
dialog: you.
text: Looking over into the next booth, he sees Thomerson's back.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (continuing)
text: Some fat slob in the next booth is
text: making a lot of noise.
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
dialog: Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Right.
dialog: (calling off)
dialog: Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
dialog: Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin
text: head's yelling...
dialog: (yelling O.S.)
dialog: Shut up, I'm talking here.
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Now look, I want you to go back and
dialog: I don't care what you do. Stop that
dialog: marriage.
text: He slams the phone down and EXITS SCREEN RIGHT. Cole starts
text: to exit left when he spots Chulo getting into the elevator.
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: Hey, man, your car's looking good.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (crazed)
dialog: Where is it?
speaker_heading: CHULO
text: Out front.
text: The elevator doors slam shut. Cole races out into the street.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL
text: Cole comes bursting out into the street. We can tell by his
text: shocked expression he doesn't like what he sees.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
text: CAMERA PANS as he charges to his Porsche. His pride and joy
text: has now, thanks to Chulo, been customized into a Chicano
text: special. It's chopped and channeled; dingleberries rim the
text: back window, flames have been painted on the rear fender; a
text: chain steering wheel, fuzzy dashboard, dice hanging from the
text: mirror. A real East L.A. beauty.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - COLE
text: He's snapped -- totally flipped. He turns and yells up to
dialog: the hotel:
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Rick... Rick... Goddamn it.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE - ANGLE - RICK
text: He's standing near the window.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Gee. I think that's for me.
text: He looks out the window and sees Cole standing next to his
dialog: transformed Porsche.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always
dialog: be.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (yelling back)
dialog: Cole, when was the last time you had
dialog: a lobotomy?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (furious)
dialog: You've had it. I'm gonna get you.
scene_heading: ANGLE - THE STREET
text: Cole hops in his car and drives off, blowing his HORN at
text: oncoming traffic. The HORN PLAYS "LA CUCURACHA." Cole slams
text: his fist on the steering wheel in disgust.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (to guys)
dialog: Don't you love it when old friends
dialog: stop by?
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: (to Rick)
dialog: Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get
dialog: something to eat. We'll bring back
dialog: food for everybody.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I'm not really hungry.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: C'mon. I insist.
text: He grabs Rick by the arm and leads him out of the room.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT
text: Rick is finishing giving the food order to a WAITER. In the
text: b.g. we SEE O'Neill talking to a BELLHOP. The Bellhop is
text: pointing to a table. O'Neill thanks him and slips him some
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: ...couple more on rye. Lots of
text: fries... and a burger and diet soda.
text: Waiter acknowledges he's got it and exits. O'Neill joins
dialog: Rick.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: Let's sit down.
text: O'Neill leads Rick to the table the Bellhop pointed out.
text: They sit down. Immediately O'Neill takes some cash from his
text: pocket and holds it under the table.
scene_heading: ANGLE UNDER THE TABLE
text: Huddled underneath the table, hidden by the tablecloth, is a
text: HOOKER. Her specialty is coming right up. She grabs the bills
text: from O'Neill's hand. She tucks the money in her cleavage and
text: turns her talents to Rick. She unzips his fly.
speaker_heading: RICK
text: He reacts to the ZIP SOUND.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: What the hell is that?
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: My gift to you.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Under the table!
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
text: The best table in the house.
dialog: The Hooker has begun to do what she does best. And Rick loves
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: ...I think we can skip the wine list.
dialog: Oh, gee...
scene_heading: FATHER FALWELL
text: enters the restaurant. He spots Rick and O'Neill and crosses
dialog: to them.
scene_heading: FATHER FALWELL
dialog: Boys, good evening to you.
text: Rick tries to maintain his dignity. But from under the table
text: a blue ribbon job is being applied to his fun zone.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: Father Falwell, good evening.
text: Falwell shakes Rick's hand. Rick hangs on for dear life.
text: Pumping the hand up and down at a faster and faster rate.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Father... Oh, yes... yes... yesssss...
dialog: Oh, yesssssss!
text: Falwell pries his hand loose.
scene_heading: FATHER FALWELL
dialog: So, Rick, soon you will be a married
dialog: man. How does it feel?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Innnnnn-credible!
scene_heading: FATHER FALWELL
dialog: Well, nice seeing you both.
text: Rick's excitement heightens as the Hooker pulls out all stops.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Ooooooooh, Jesus, Oh God, God, God,
dialog: God, Oh Jesus, Jeeeesussss...
text: Father Falwell looks on rather perplexed. Rick sees Falwell's
text: puzzled look.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I was just saying grace.
scene_heading: FATHER FALWELL
dialog: How nice.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: You done?
text: Before Rick can speak we HEAR a VOICE from under the table.
speaker_heading: HOOKER (O.S.)
dialog: Not yet.
text: Rick's hand EXITS FRAME and zips up his pants. Then Rick and
text: O'Neill get up.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Father, would you like to take our
dialog: table?
text: O'Neill can't believe what Rick is about to do.
scene_heading: FATHER FALWELL
dialog: Yes. Thank you.
text: He sits in Rick's spot. Rick leans on the table to say his
text: final farewell to the priest. He takes this moment to get
text: some money out of his pocket and hold it under the table.
scene_heading: UNDER THE TABLE
text: The Hooker grabs the money.
text: BACK TO SCENE
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I think you'll enjoy this table.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: So long, Father.
text: He and Rick, suppressing a laugh, exit. Father Falwell picks
text: up the menu. We HEAR the ZIP SOUND. Father perks up. He
text: doesn't know what the hell is happening.
text: O'Neill turns to Rick as they're leaving the coffee shop.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: I don't get it. Why didn't you go
dialog: for it just now?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I don't know. Maybe it's because I
dialog: love Debbie or maybe it's hard for
dialog: me to get off in a place that smells
dialog: like egg salad. I'm not sure.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE
text: Rick and O'Neill enter the suite. No one is there.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Where the hell is everybody?
text: Everyone jumps out from their hiding places. With our guys
text: is Gary and his team of FIVE PROSTITUTES.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Surprise!
dialog: (gesturing to the
dialog: girls)
text: The team bus just pulled in.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Hookers. It's a party!
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: All right!
text: One of our hookers, KELLEY, gets everyone's attention.
speaker_heading: KELLEY
dialog: Who's first, guys?
text: Everyone acts as if they're in grade school. They raise their
text: hands; they come on like kids trying to get the teacher's
dialog: attention.
speaker_heading: GUYS
dialog: Oh, me... me... me!
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: Wait. The guest of honor should be
dialog: first.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Nah, that's okay. My brother has to
dialog: look up old people's asses all day
dialog: long. Let's give him a break.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Right. Give me the will to live. Let
dialog: me go first.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: A moving plea. Okay, Doc, you lead
dialog: off. I'll screw clean up.
text: Everyone cheers Stan's good fortune. Kelley takes Stan by
text: the hand and leads him into the bedroom. Gary turns on a
text: record and everyone starts dancing. Larry is laying out drugs
text: on a table. They consist of lines of coke and various happy
text: time pills of all colors and shapes. Rick takes a look at
dialog: the layout.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: How thoughtful. A drug smorgasbord.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Chulo enters. He sees the party has taken off.
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: I have returned!
text: He spots a sweet-faced young hooker, LAVERNE. She is prancing
text: around in her bra and underwear. Chulo wants her.
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: (continuing; points
dialog: to her)
dialog: You! Mine!
text: Laverne is frightened of Chulo. Mainly because he's coming
text: at her like a sex-starved buffalo. Chulo goes after her.
text: Scared, she runs around the room, then out the door. Chulo
text: gives chase.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (to O'Neill)
dialog: Chulo's got such a nice, light touch
dialog: with women.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR
text: Laverne runs down the hall, closely pursued by Chulo. An all-
text: female NEW WAVE BAND comes to the door. O'Neill greets them.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: Terrific. You made it... You can set
dialog: up over there...
dialog: As they enter we go to --
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR
text: Chulo is on the heels of Laverne. She bursts through a door
dialog: to excape him.
scene_heading: INT. STAGE
text: Laverne finds herself on the stage of a beauty pageant, still
text: in her bra and panties. FIVE other LADIES are dressed in
text: their bathing suits. Chulo stops short of running on stage.
text: Laverne, seeking the safety of the moment, stands in line
dialog: with the contestants.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON MR. THOMERSON AND OTHER JUDGES
dialog: They like what they see.
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
dialog: (to another)
dialog: Great bathing suit.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: (indicating Laverne)
dialog: I think I screwed that one once.
scene_heading: INT. THOMERSON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Debbie and the shower guests are all in a state of undress.
text: We WATCH as they put on dresses and heavy makeup. Mrs.
text: Thomerson is still freaked out over her meeting with Nick
dialog: the Dick.
scene_heading: MRS. THOMERSON
text: I had his weiner right in my hands.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: I told you. Men are pigs... I saw
text: them standing there.
speaker_heading: PHOEBE
dialog: What a gross thing to do... gawd!
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: I bet right now Rick and his pals...
text: (she spits disdainfully)
dialog: ...are knee deep in whores.
scene_heading: MRS. THOMERSON
text: A strange wang right in my palm.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Ilene, we don't really know that.
speaker_heading: BOBBIE
dialog: That's what we're going to find out...
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Good. That's just what we're doing.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: I'll kill Stan if I find out he's
dialog: been screwing around.
text: Ilene shoves socks in her bra to enhance her cleavage and

dialog: Brett, are you with us?
scene_heading: MRS. THOMERSON
dialog: (coming out of her
dialog: fog)
dialog: Yeah, sure... I was eye to eye with
text: an unfamiliar pud.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE
text: The party is taking off. The all-girl band is going ape shit.
text: The guys are dancing with the hookers. They're all moving in
text: unison, to a gyrating New Wave dance step and singing along
text: with the MUSIC.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - RYKO
text: He's wearing gravity boots, hanging upside down, entwined
text: around one of the hookers. They're hanging there, making out
text: like crazy. Gary passes by.
speaker_heading: RYKO
dialog: Hey, Gary, spot me.
scene_heading: ANGLE - BEDROOM DOOR
text: Stan comes out of the bedroom. He's disheveled, but looks
text: very happy. He crosses to Rick.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Thanks a lot, that was the best.
dialog: You're next.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older
dialog: brother. I need some advice here.
dialog: What's the deal with marriage? What
dialog: can I expect?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Well, the first month it's great.
text: The second month things calm down a
dialog: little. By the third month you're
dialog: looking through your old girlfriends'
dialog: phone numbers; by the fourth month
dialog: you're numb; by the fifth month,
dialog: hopefully the football season starts.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of
dialog: help.
text: Stan pats Rick on the back and dives into the festivities.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - GARY
text: He spots someone across the room. It's like Tony spotting
text: Maria for the first time in "West Side Story." As in a DREAM
text: SEQUENCE, ALL SOUNDS STOP. Two pinspots hit them. She turns
text: and sees him. She smiles. Both are madly in love. Like two
text: pieces of metal attracted to the same magnet, they walk toward
dialog: each other.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: SHE
dialog: Hello.
text: They take each other by the hand. They walk into the bedroom
text: and close the door behind them.
text: The New Wave dance briefly continues, then comes to an end.
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE - THE HOTEL ROOM
text: O'Neill grabs Ryko (who is just coming down from his gravity
text: bar) and Stan, who is wearing a pair of women's underwear on
text: his head.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: You guys better get going. It's
dialog: getting late.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Oh, right.
text: Ryko and Stan cross to the door and exit. As they do, four
text: or five pretty GIRLS are passing by in the hallway.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Is there a party going on in there
dialog: or something?
speaker_heading: RYKO
dialog: Yeah. It's great. Go on in.
text: The girls cross inside.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: My God. Fresh meat. Let's hurry back.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - TIGHT ON LARRY
text: There is a pained, tragic and extremely stoned out look on
text: his face as he sighs deeply and then summons up his courage.
text: WIDEN as he looks down at his right wrist.
text: He heaves another deep sigh and brings an electric razor
text: INTO FRAME. He turns it on and runs it over his wrist. Of
text: course, nothing happens. Just then Rick enters.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: What the hell are you doing?
speaker_heading: LARRY
text: I'm trying to slash my wrists.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: You're trying to kill yourself with
dialog: an electric razor?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I couldn't find any razor blades.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Well, this is terrific. Now you're
dialog: gonna have wrists that are smooth
dialog: and kissable. Just go out there.
dialog: Forget about everything and laugh it
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: LARRY
text: (suddenly laughs like
dialog: a crazy man)
dialog: Ha, ha, ha.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now,
dialog: forget about marriage for a while.
dialog: Go party.
text: As he shoves Larry out, Gary enters the bathroom. His
text: expression tells us he's had the best sex of his life.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Gary, how we doing, big stallion?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Rick, I really think I'm in love.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: This is cause for celebration. She'll
dialog: probably charge half price for sex
dialog: from now on.
text: Rick exits as Gary dreamily crosses to the mirror.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: (into mirror)
dialog: This time it's real. She's wonderful.
text: Gary's "woman" enters and closes the door. Their eyes meet.
text: Gary takes her hand and kisses it gently. She turns away,
text: then lifts up the toilet seat, lifts up her dress and proceeds
text: to pee. She is a man. Gary is stunned. His jaw drops open.
text: Gary's dream girl/guy finishes his business. He drops his
text: dress and turns to Gary.
speaker_heading: SHE
dialog: The name's Tim. I'm always available.
text: He blows a kiss and starts to leave, but turns back.
speaker_heading: SHE/TIM
dialog: By the way... I also do engine work
dialog: on BMW's. 'Bye.
text: Tim exits. Gary feels filthy. He rips open the cabinet, takes
text: out tooth paste and toothbrush and vigorously brushes his
text: teeth. He rips off his clothes and jumps in the shower and
text: scrubs as if he's scraping barnacles off a hull of a tugboat.
scene_heading: EXT. STABLES - NIGHT
text: Ryko and Stan drive up to a country stable. They get out of
text: the car and open a barn door. Both are pleased at what they
dialog: see.
speaker_heading: RYKO
dialog: All right.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Standing there is a donkey, eating straw.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT
text: Cole drives up in his Chulo-customized Porsche. He gets out,
text: then reaches back into the car and takes out a crossbow (the
text: heavy duty metal kind hunters use). He looks up menacingly
text: at the hotel and spots the room where the party is going on.
text: He sees another hotel across the way. He gets an idea and
text: enters the other hotel.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE
text: The party is going full blast. Some other girls and a couple
text: of guys (hotel guests) enter the room and are quickly swept
text: up in the spirit of the party. O'Neill approaches Rick.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: Rick, I'm concerned.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: This is your bachelor party. You
dialog: haven't had sex with anyone yet.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (trying to joke his
dialog: way out of it)
dialog: Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance
dialog: and see what happens.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: I got something you can't resist. I
dialog: have a friend, Tracey. She wants to
dialog: meet you. She loves to please.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Oooooo.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: (indicating the bedroom)
dialog: Right in there, pal.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: If I'm not out in a half hour, send
dialog: for the paramedics.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: That's the old Rick!
text: Rick enters the bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM
text: It's dark, but for a lamp on the nightstand which is on. In
text: one corner of the room we SEE the figure of a woman.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Hellooo!
text: Tracey walks toward Rick. The light illuminates her. What we
dialog: see is truly the most beautiful woman on earth. She is totally
text: nude. A vision that would make any man screw and ask questions
dialog: later.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (to himself;
dialog: overwhelmed by her)
dialog: Eat my chair!
speaker_heading: TRACEY
dialog: Take me... please.
text: Rick instinctively makes a move toward her. He decides to go
dialog: for it.
scene_heading: RICK'S POV - TRACEY
text: Just then a strange thing happens to Tracey's face. It
text: transforms into Debbies.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Rick stops dead in his tracks. He can't believe it. Debbie's
text: face is now on Tracey's body.
speaker_heading: TRACEY/DEBBIE
dialog: You promised me, Rick. You promised
dialog: you wouldn't make love to anyone
dialog: else.
text: Rick is shaken by this. He shakes his head and wipes at his
text: eyes. Debbie's face is gone. He moves toward Tracey again.
speaker_heading: TRACEY
text: Her face transforms into Sister Mary Francis.
scene_heading: TRACEY/SISTER MARY FRANCIS
dialog: Don't go back on your word, Rick. Be
dialog: true; be strong.
text: Sister Mary Francis's face disappears.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I can't do it.
speaker_heading: TRACEY
text: Her face becomes Stan's.
speaker_heading: TRACEY/STAN
dialog: You nuts? Look at me, I'm beautiful!
text: Stan's face turns back to Tracey's.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: All the kids from his bus are gathered around Tracey. They're
text: egging him on.
speaker_heading: KIDS
dialog: Do it! Come on! Put her away! Go for
dialog: it!
text: Debbie's face appears on Tracey's.
speaker_heading: TRACEY/DEBBIE
dialog: (pleading)
dialog: Don't Rick.
text: Debbie's face disappears. Rick can't take it anymore.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I can't do it. I love Debbie.
text: He runs out of the room, leaving a very confused Tracey in
text: his wake.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM
text: O'Neill is waiting outside the bedroom door as Rick comes
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: How'd it go?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Put it to you this way -- you're
dialog: gonna have to pry her out of the bed
text: with a spatula, mister.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: I'm proud of you, lad.
text: Rick crosses to the bar area as O'Neill watches him go,
text: beaming.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM ACROSS THE STREET - NIGHT
text: Cole enters the room. He runs to the window.
speaker_heading: COLE'S POV
text: His window is right opposite the window in the hotel of Rick's
dialog: party.
speaker_heading: COLE
text: He's pleased. Very pleased. He places an arrow into his
text: crossbow.
speaker_heading: COLE'S POV
text: He's looking down his sights. Rick is the target... and an
dialog: easy one at that, for at this very moment Rick is crossing
text: past the window.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE
text: The door opens and in walks Rajah, the Indian pimp. He looks
text: pissed. He's looking for Gary.
speaker_heading: RAJAH
dialog: (angry)
dialog: Am looking for this dunghead who
dialog: took my women... He is being liar to
dialog: me. 45 minutes way over.
speaker_heading: COLE'S POV
text: He has Rick right where he wants him.
speaker_heading: CROSSBOW TRIGGER
text: Cole's finger squeezes off a shot.
speaker_heading: RICK
text: Luckily he starts to dance with a female guest. This takes
text: him out of line of the arrow.
scene_heading: HOTEL SUITE WINDOW
text: The arrow zooms through the open window.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE
text: Rajah is standing by the door. The arrow zips through the
text: room, misses everyone and lodges in the wall inches from
text: Rajah's head. He looks at the arrow and realizes he almost
dialog: was killed.
speaker_heading: RAJAH
dialog: (frightened)
dialog: Holy Dung is this thing! I sic Milt
dialog: on you. He get back bitches. Me? I
dialog: haul ass.
text: He runs out of the room. Rick and O'Neill watch Rajah exit,
dialog: confused.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Who was that?
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (looking at arrow)
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: Got me.
text: Just then another arrow comes zipping through the room,
text: lodging in a chair inches from Rick.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (to new arrow)
dialog: How 'bout this?
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
text: Still drawing a blank.
text: They turn in the direction the arrow came from and look out
text: the window. They spot Cole loading his bow in the room across
dialog: the way.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: He look familiar?
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: Very.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle.
dialog: We better put Cochise out of business.
text: They start for the door as we go to --
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE OF BEAUTY PAGEANT
text: Chulo is waiting outside a door that says "Dressing Room."
text: Several of the beauty contestants race out wearing formal
text: gowns. Laverne follows them, wearing a very tight black dress.
text: Chulo approaches her.
speaker_heading: LAVERNE
dialog: Stay away from me.
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: I'm not gonna hassle you... Don't
dialog: worry. You look beautiful.
speaker_heading: LAVERNE
dialog: (nervous)
dialog: Think so? I borrowed it from one of
dialog: the girls. I don't look too fat?
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: You're an angel... A madonna.
text: Laverne is moved by this. Before she can respond a Stage
text: Manager takes her by the arm and pushes her on stage.
speaker_heading: STAGE MANAGER
dialog: You're on.
text: Chulo watches Laverne enter the stage to hearty applause.
scene_heading: ANGLE - THE AUDIENCE
text: Mr. Thomerson and the other Judges sit in the front row making
dialog: notes.
scene_heading: MEDIUM SHOT - THE STAGE
text: The girls are lined up on pedestals as the MC approaches
dialog: Laverne
speaker_heading: MC
dialog: All right, here is your question,
dialog: Miss... Er...
text: He looks through his cards hurriedly and is unable to find
dialog: Laverne's.
speaker_heading: LAVERNE
dialog: Rivas.
speaker_heading: MC
dialog: Miss Rivas... Yes... How would you
dialog: solve our country's present economic
dialog: problems?
speaker_heading: LAVERNE
dialog: Who, me?
speaker_heading: MC
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: LAVERNE
dialog: That's a good question. From the way
dialog: I understand it, according to supply
dialog: side economics, when supply exceeds
text: demand, recession is the result.
dialog: That's why I think we should control
dialog: the credit markets and increase the
dialog: prime rate. That way, the consumer
dialog: price index will stabilize and we
dialog: will have economic recovery.
scene_heading: ANGLE - THE CROWD
text: They break into spontaneous applause.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - CHULO
text: He is totally blown away.
scene_heading: ANGLE - LAVERNE
text: She smiles broadly at the applause and walks off stage. Chulo
text: moves alongside her.
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: How'd you know all that stuff? You're
dialog: a real brain.
speaker_heading: LAVERNE
dialog: Nah, I used to fuck a librarian.
text: Chulo looks at her with awe and respect as she exits into
text: the dressing room.
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: Wow!
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
text: Debbie, her mother and the girls enter the lobby. They
text: approach the Hotel Manager, who is standing behind the front
text: desk. They are dressed garishly, like hookers. Debbie has on
text: a cheap blonde wig and mini skirt. The Manager looks at them
text: the way one would look at an approaching plague.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I don't believe we're doing this.
text: The Manager crosses to them.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Can I help you, ladies?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Yes, we're looking for the Stahl
dialog: party.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Room 1002.
text: The girls turn and start toward the elevator. Mrs. Thomerson,
text: who is wearing the kind of push-up bra that makes her tits
text: look like the Black Hills, smiles at the Manager seductively.
text: He smiles back, then catches himself.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: (to Bellboy)
dialog: Those guys are asking for it.
text: The girls cross to the elevator. Ilene pushes the button and
text: the doors swing open. They get inside and just before the
text: doors close, a huge behemoth of a man joins them inside. He
text: turns and faces CAMERA. It's Milt, Rajah's beefy helper. He
text: doesn't look happy as he eyes the girls. They look back at
text: him uncomfortably as the doors slam shut.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR
text: The elevator door opens. Milt has all the girls by the collar
text: and hustles them down the hall.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: You're making a big mistake.
speaker_heading: MILT
dialog: Shut up. You still got another job
dialog: to do here.
scene_heading: MRS. THOMERSON
dialog: What kind of job? I'm a housewife.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Quiet, Mother.
text: Milt stops at a door and kicks it with his foot. The door
text: opens a crack at first, then swings open wide, revealing six
text: middle-aged Japanese business MEN in their underwear. They
text: smile wide at the girls, obviously thrilled with the quality
text: of the merchandise delivered to them. Milt shoves them into
dialog: the room.
speaker_heading: MILT
dialog: Get in there.
text: He slams the door shut and exits.
scene_heading: INT. JAPANESE GUYS' ROOM
text: The guys start to move toward our panicked girls. They speak
dialog: to each other in Japanese (with English subtitles)
speaker_heading: JAPANESE ONE
dialog: Nice looking quim, huh, Bob?
speaker_heading: JAPANESE TWO
dialog: Yeah, you know me, Ray, I've always
dialog: been a sucker for redheads.
speaker_heading: JAPANESE FOUR
dialog: Hubba-hubba.
speaker_heading: BOBBIE
dialog: Let's get out of here, girls.
text: They turn toward the door. One of the Japanese races over
text: and gets there first, slamming and bolting the door shut.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Guys, take it easy. Guys.
text: The girls run around the room in a panic with the Japanese
text: chasing them in very hot pursuit.
scene_heading: EXT. COLE'S ROOM
text: Rick, O'Neill and Tracey quietly approach Cole's door. Tracey
text: is dressed in a see-through negligee.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: This is it.
dialog: (he positions Tracey
dialog: outside the door)
dialog: Go get 'im.
text: He and O'Neill duck around the hallway corner, out of sight.
scene_heading: INT. COLE'S ROOM
text: He is at the window, holding his crossbow. He is frantically
text: searching the bachelor party across the way for any sign of
dialog: Rick.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Where the hell is he?
text: He hears a KNOCK on the DOOR. Cole quickly hides his crossbow
text: under the bed and answers the door.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Tracey stands in the open door. Cole's jaw drops open. He
dialog: has never seen anything as lovely.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: TRACEY
dialog: Make love to me... please.
text: She walks into the room. Cole closes the door.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE COLE'S DOOR
text: Rick and O'Neill run up to the door. They listen closely. We
text: HEAR the SOUND of Cole's SHIRT being RIPPED off, the buttons
text: flying around the room, then the SOUND of his pant ZIPPER
text: being undone.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: T minus... 3... 2... 1. We have
dialog: ignition.
text: e and O'Neill burst into the room and close the door.
speaker_heading: COLE (O.S.)
dialog: Hey!
scene_heading: INT. COLE'S ROOM
text: O'Neill is tying the end of a sheet around the bed post. We
text: SEE the bed is minus its sheets and blankets.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: All set here.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: The guys have tied the sheets and blankets together and made
text: a rope. The other end is tied around Cole's chest. And that's
text: all Cole is wearing; he's nude.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You guys are never going to get away
dialog: with this.
text: Rick stuffs Cole's underwear in his mouth to gag him.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: We're just going to keep you in a
text: safe place until after the party.
text: He and O'Neill lift Cole up and put him out the window. They
text: hang onto the sheet/blanket rope and lower him slowly outside.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL
text: We SEE Cole being lowered from the window.
scene_heading: CLOSER ON COLE
text: He's struggling, but can do nothing about his predicament.
text: He looks down.
speaker_heading: COLE'S POV
text: The hotel parking lot is ten stories below.
speaker_heading: COLE
text: He looks up to the guys.
scene_heading: RICK AND O'NEILL
text: They look down at him from the window above.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Now, don't get into any trouble.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: Take care.
scene_heading: RICK &amp; O'NEILL
dialog: Byeeeee!
text: They duck inside the window.
scene_heading: INT. COLE'S ROOM
text: Rick, O'Neill and Tracey exit the room.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (to Tracey)
dialog: Don't you wish you were a guy so you
dialog: could have fun like this?
speaker_heading: COLE
text: He's scared to death.
scene_heading: INT. COLE'S ROOM
text: We SEE that Cole's weight is pulling the bed to the window.
speaker_heading: COLE
text: He's slowly lowering down the side of the building.
scene_heading: INT. ANOTHER HOTEL ROOM
text: A YOUNG COUPLE enters the room. They are very much in love.
text: He gives her a kiss and closes the door.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Why don't you get comfortable?
text: She smiles coyly and starts to undress. He crosses to the
text: closed blinds.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: There's a wonderful moon out tonight.
text: He opens the blinds, revealing Cole's ass pressed up against
text: the window.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
text: She screams, horrified.
scene_heading: INT. JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN'S ROOM
text: The girls are being hotly pursued by the Japanese men.
speaker_heading: JAPANESE/RAY
dialog: (subtitled)
dialog: Hey, Bob, this beats the shit out of
dialog: sushi, doesn't it?
scene_heading: INT. COLE'S ROOM
text: The bed moves right up against the wall under the window. We
text: SEE the end tied to the bed post is beginning to untie.
speaker_heading: COLE
text: He's panicked.
scene_heading: INT. COLE'S ROOM
text: The knot unties.
speaker_heading: COLE
text: He falls OUT OF FRAME. The "rope" trailing behind.
scene_heading: INT. CAR
text: The young couple from the room are seated in his sportscar.
text: He's cranking open the sun roof.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Babe, I didn't know anything about
dialog: that.
text: The sun roof opens. Suddenly Cole's ass sticks through it.
text: The Woman freaks out again.
scene_heading: EXT. SPORTSCAR
text: We SEE a groggy Cole sitting in the sun roof. The Man in the
text: car is trying to calm down his lady.
scene_heading: INT. BANQUET ROOM - BACKSTAGE
text: Chulo and Laverne are standing in the wings while in the
text: b.g. we can SEE the MC singing the Moosehead Beer jingle.
dialog: Then:
speaker_heading: MC
dialog: All right, can we have our five
dialog: finalists, please.
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: Good luck, Laverne.
text: Laverne and the five finalists go out on stage.
scene_heading: ANGLE - MR. THOMERSON

speaker_heading: MC
dialog: Thank you, Mr. Thomerson. Well, the

scene_heading: ANGLE - THE GIRLS
text: They are all nervous, especially Laverne.
speaker_heading: MC
dialog: Laverne Rivas.
text: Laverne squeals with delight and hugs the MC as he puts the

text: microphone.
speaker_heading: LAVERNE
dialog: (teary-eyed)
dialog: I can't believe it. This is the
dialog: happiest day of my life, and I owe
dialog: it all to him.
text: She points O.S. to Chulo, Chulo, with tears in his eyes,
text: comes out on stage and, in a surge of emotion, picks Laverne
text: up off her feet and hugs her passionately.
scene_heading: ANGLE - THE JUDGES
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: I know I've had that girl.
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
dialog: (looking at Chulo)
dialog: And I know that guy from somewhere,

text: The other judge looks at Mr. Thomerson suspiciously.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT
text: CAMERA PUSHES IN TO a car in the parking lot which is towing
text: a U-Haul trailer behind it. The car stops and turns off its
text: lights.
scene_heading: INT. CAR
text: Stan and O'Neill sit in the car looking at the hotel.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: How the hell are we supposed to get
dialog: this donkey inside?
speaker_heading: RYKO
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: What? I thought you told me you had
dialog: it all figured out.
speaker_heading: RYKO
dialog: Maybe I did... I don't remember.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: (through clenched
dialog: teeth)
dialog: I'd love to get you in an operating
text: room. Just once.
scene_heading: ANGLE - HOTEL ENTRANCE
text: Just then the "Moose" from the beauty pageant steps outside
text: the hotel for a smoke.
text: The guy in front removes the head, takes a drag of his
text: cigarette and passes it to the guy bringing up the rear.
text: After a beat, smoke steams out the rear end of the costume.
scene_heading: ANGLE - THE GUYS IN THE CAR
text: They both have the same idea. They stroll out of the car and
text: approach the two men in the moose suit. We can't hear what
dialog: they're saying, but we can SEE the bills Stan is taking out
text: of his pocket. Ryko grabs the moosehead and runs over to the
text: trailer with it.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - A FEW MINUTES LATER
text: The door opens and Stan and Ryko enter pulling the "Moose"
text: by a rope.
speaker_heading: RYKO
dialog: Can you believe how perfect it fits?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both
dialog: be a size 138 regular.
text: Just then Rick and O'Neill saunter into the lobby.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: Hey, you guys...
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Who's your friend?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: (keeping it a surprise)
dialog: Oh... it's... er... the guys from

text: them to the party.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Great.
dialog: (to moose)
dialog: I was wondering, how do you guys go
dialog: to the bathroom in that thing?
text: At that moment he HEARS a SPLAT hit the ground. The guys
text: look down and see a large, shiny clump of shiny brown
text: excrement nestled in the shag carpet.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Say no more.
text: The Manager crosses to them.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: I don't know which one of you did
dialog: this, but you're not going anywhere
dialog: till you clean up this disgusting
dialog: mess.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: (resigned)
dialog: Anybody got a paper towel or a shovel
dialog: or something?
text: All the guests turn away in disgust. Stan takes out a
text: handkerchief and hands it to Rick, who closes his eyes and
text: picks up the warm little bundle. The Manager turns and walks
text: off in a huff. On the way back to the elevator, Rick checks
text: to see no one is watching and places the handkerchief's
text: contents on the front desk, just OUT OF FRAME. Smiling
text: contentedly, the guys lead the reluctant "moose" into the
text: elevator. The doors slam shut.
text: ANGLE AT THE DESK
text: The Manager is just finishing checking in a couple from out
dialog: of town.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: I'll have the boy take your bags up.
text: He goes to hit the bell and to his surprise, his hand comes
text: down on something soft and mushy. The look on his face tells
dialog: us what it is. It's the "gift" Rick left behind.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: (to couple)
dialog: Excuse me. I seem to have a hand
text: full of potty.
text: Revolted, he races into a room marked "MEN."
scene_heading: ANGLE - BALLROOM DOORS
text: The doors open and several people from the Moosehead beauty
text: pageant come out. Mr. Thomerson is one of them.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We
dialog: appreciate it.
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
dialog: Any time, Al.
text: Mr. T. crosses to the door just as Cole comes running in,
text: slightly dazed, wrapped in the tattered remnants of the sheet
text: that held him suspended out the window. They both are shocked
dialog: to see one another.
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
dialog: Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing
dialog: here? What happened?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (nearly hysterical)
text: The bachelor party's upstairs. They
dialog: made me get naked. They hung me from
dialog: the window so high up it was so scary
dialog: I fell down...
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
dialog: Take hold of yourself. What room are
dialog: they in?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: 1002.
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
dialog: All right, I'll go up there and take
dialog: care of this myself.
dialog: (disgusted)
dialog: You look awful, son. Go find yourself
dialog: some clothes.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: With a determined look, Thomerson crosses to the elevator,
text: as Cole runs into the hotel gift shop.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
text: Rick, Ryko, Stan, O'Neill enter with the "moose."
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: It's Bullwinkle.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: Gentlemen... Ladies... For your
dialog: viewing pleasure, meet Mike the
dialog: Magical Sexual Mule.
text: O'Neill lifts the head off the moose costume, revealing a
text: real burro. The burro shows all his teeth as burros are apt
text: to do when excited. O'Neill and Stan zip off the rest of his
text: costume, revealing a well-endowed beast.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: How about this, a Trojan donkey.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: And here's Mike's partner, in more
dialog: ways than one. A gal who doesn't
dialog: think happiness ends with primates.
dialog: The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
text: DESIREE, an erotic, tall woman wearing a leather face mask,
text: comes out of the bedroom carrying a long whip. Desiree puts
text: Ravel's "Bolero" on the PHONOGRAPH; then she starts to sway
text: her hips sensuously in front of the animal.
scene_heading: ANGLE - THE PARTY GUESTS
text: They all scream and holler approval.
scene_heading: ANGLE - DESIREE
text: She rubs up against the donkey, shaking her backside against
text: the animal's.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Swell. She's gonna pin her tail on
text: the donkey.
text: Now all eyes are on Desiree as she does an erotic striptease.
scene_heading: ANGLE - THE DONKEY
text: It is getting bored and a little hungry. It bends its head
text: to the left and spots the table with food on it. It bends
text: over and starts munching on some cole slaw.
scene_heading: ANGLE - DESIREE
text: To the catcalls of the partygoers, Desiree is getting all
text: worked up, stripping down to a G-string.
speaker_heading: THE DONKEY
text: It's had enough cole slaw. Now it sniffs at Larry's drug
text: smorgasbord and then starts to chomp on a few pills. Next it
text: sticks its head into the lines of coke and snorts them up in
text: one gigantic sniff.
scene_heading: ANGLE - DESIREE
text: She lets her long, flowing hair hang down over her breasts.
text: Then she takes a mattress and sets it on the floor. She rolls
text: on it and sways her hips sensuously on her knees.
scene_heading: ANGLE - HER AUDIENCE
text: Rick can't believe he's seeing this. The other guys are
text: screaming at the top of their lungs. Even Larry seems spell-
dialog: bound.
scene_heading: ANGLE - THE DONKEY
text: It doesn't look so hot as it finishes off every drug on the
dialog: table.
scene_heading: ANGLE - DESIREE
text: She moves over to the donkey, hits him on the side gently
text: with her whip, then pulls him over to her mattress. The
text: donkey's blood-shot eyes are the size of saucers. Once again
text: he shows his teeth in a kind of shit-eating grin. Desiree
text: drops to the mattress and beckons the animal to her. Mike
text: the Donkey obediently does as he's told, moving to her in a
text: trance-like, very turned-on state.
speaker_heading: DESIREE
dialog: C'mon, Mike... Come to Mama.
text: The Donkey takes another step forward, and then suddenly
text: rears up on his hind legs, snorting. He starts bucking wildly.
text: The crowd moves out of his way as the animal goes berserk
text: for a few seconds, then without warning collapses in a heap
text: on the floor.
text: Everyone goes rushing up to it.
text: Chulo and Laverne enter the room, followed by several of the
text: other contestants and others from the beauty pageant.
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Hey, you guys, I'm getting married.
dialog: (to Laverne)
dialog: We're gonna make lots of kids.
text: He looks over and sees everyone gathered around Mike.
speaker_heading: CHULO
dialog: What the hell happened?
text: Gary shushes him. We PUSH IN ON Dr. Stan, who is listening
text: for signs of life in the animal's chest. Finally Stan stands
text: up somberly.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Drug overdose.
speaker_heading: DESIREE
dialog: You mean it's...
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Afraid so. I did everything I could.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: It's my fault. He's dead because...
dialog: I left those drugs...
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: It's really not all your fault. I
dialog: was talking to Mike earlier and he
dialog: had a lot of problems. Personal
dialog: things, you know. Made some bad
dialog: investments. At least now he's
dialog: peaceful...
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: C'mon, we gotta get this thing out
dialog: of here.
text: O'Neil places the moosehead on the donkey as Rick, Gary,
text: Chulo and Stan pull the donkey out into the hall like
text: pallbearers at a funeral.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
text: Mr. Thomerson, who's been standing at the door, takes this
text: time to sneak into the suite right behind them.
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S SUITE
text: Mr. Thomerson can't believe the goings-on. People are making
text: out, drinking and dancing. He hides in a corner to watch
dialog: undercover.
scene_heading: ANGLE IN CORRIDOR
text: The guys shove the donkey onto the elevator and the doors
dialog: snap shut.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: Yes... I see... Of course we don't
dialog: allow that sort of thing here, ma'am.
dialog: No... Well, I'm sorry the noise woke
dialog: you. I'll take care of it right away.
text: He hangs up and crosses to the elevator.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: I've had enough of this.
text: Just then the elevator door swings open. The donkey falls
text: out into the lobby. The Manager screams in terror, as do
text: several of the hotel guests.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: That's it. I'm calling the cops.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
text: Some more uninvited guests come drifting into the room.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Welcome, welcome, one and all.
speaker_heading: MR. THOMERSON (O.S.)
dialog: Rick!
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (recognizing the voice)
dialog: Oh, no!
text: He turns and spots Mr. Thomerson as he makes his way through
dialog: the party.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Christ... it's Mr. Laughs.
text: Mr. Thomerson goes nose to nose with Rick.
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
dialog: This is it. You're through. When
dialog: Debbie hears about this she'll never
dialog: see you again. Now I'm calling the
dialog: cops to break up this sex orgy...
dialog: And toss your ass in jail!
text: He turns away and walks OUT OF FRAME. O'Neill crosses to
dialog: Rick.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: What are you going to do about it?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (defeated)
dialog: What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's
dialog: going to go crazy and end the whole
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: I'll stop him... You stall him.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Mr. Thomerson is heading for the phone in the bedroom.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Mr. Thomerson!
text: Thomerson stops and turns to Rick.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (continuing; dramatic)
dialog: Please, no. Don't ruin my life.
dialog: Please!
text: He drops to his knees and hugs Thomerson's legs. The party
text: stops and everyone watches.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: It's not me. I was brought up on the
text: wrong side of the tracks. A victim
dialog: of my environment...
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - O'NEILL AND LARRY
text: Larry is handing O'Neill a plastic bag filled with white
dialog: powder.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: Is that all the coke in the place?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: That's it.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: Good.
text: O'Neill unscrews the mouthpiece off the phone. He pours the
text: bag of cocaine into the phone. He then screws the mouthpiece
text: back on over this mound of powder. Satisfied with his work,
text: he exits the bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. SUITE - MAIN ROOM
text: Thomerson is trying to free himself from Rick's grasp as
text: Rick continues with his "hard luck" story.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: My poor old mammy had to take in
dialog: laundry. My pappy had to work 20
dialog: hours a day at the Pez Factory.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: O'Neill gestures to Rick that everything's ready. Rick
text: immediately jumps to his feet.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: The end.
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
dialog: No sob story is going to change my
dialog: mind.
text: Mr. Thomerson pushes O'Neill aside and enters the bedroom.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: The phone's all yours.
text: Mr. Thomerson, in the bedroom, picks up the receiver. As he
text: does so, a cloud of cocaine falls out of the mouthpiece. He
text: screams at Rick, gesturing with the phone in his hand as he
text: dials. Each move produces a large cloud of powder, which
text: causes him to sniffle slightly.
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
dialog: I never liked you. I've never liked
dialog: any of your friends. I've hated you
dialog: from the first time I saw you. And
dialog: now you are out of my life. You are
dialog: out of my life!
text: He starts to react from inhaling the powder. He puts the
text: receiver to his ear. He takes a deep breath and tries to
text: dial another number. A large cloud of coke flies up his nose.
text: He's stunned. He takes another deep drag. He's hooked. He
text: forgets all about dialing. He jams the receiver against his
text: nose and takes deep drag after deep drag.
text: Desiree, still wearing her leather mask, crosses to him and
text: sits down next to him on the bed. He gives her a big, wide
dialog: smile.
text: O'Neill closes the door.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
text: Reach out and snort someone.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I'm saved. Let's party!
text: Everyone starts to whoop it up again.
scene_heading: INT. JAPANESE SUITE
text: It's still a standoff between the girls and the horny
dialog: Japanese.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Let's give them what they want.
speaker_heading: PHOEBE
dialog: What?
text: Debbie opens the bedroom door and motions for the Japanese
dialog: to file in.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Let's go. Everyone inside.
text: The Japanese immediately put two and two together and get
text: orgy. These are some happy fellas as they enter the bedroom.
speaker_heading: BOBBIE
dialog: Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (herding in the last
dialog: Japanese)
dialog: Right in here. The big show starts
text: in one minute.
text: The Japanese man enters the room. Debbie slams the door shut
text: behind him.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Let's go.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and
dialog: hold them off. The rest of you break
dialog: for it!
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Ilene, are you crazy?
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: I know what I'm doing... Go!
text: The girls run out the door.
scene_heading: INT. JAPANESE BEDROOM
text: Ilene smiles. She has what she wants. She walks into the
text: bedroom, surrounded by panting Japanese.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Gentlemen, the gods have answered
dialog: your prayers... Bonzai!
text: She takes a running leap and dives on top of the Japanese.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR
text: Debbie and the ladies run to an elevator. Debbie presses the
dialog: "down" button.
scene_heading: MRS. THOMERSON
dialog: I hope Ilene's all right.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I hope those guys are all right.
text: The elevator door opens, revealing the donkey lying flat on
text: his back. His stiff legs point skyward. The girls see him
text: and scream. They run down the hall to the stairway. On the
text: way Debbie notices she's passing Room 1002. She HEARS the
text: party SOUNDS inside.
text: She heads for the room angrily. This is a lady out to even a
dialog: score.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE
text: As Debbie opens the door, her father walks by with Desiree
text: on his arm. Neither sees the other. Debbie enters the room.
text: She is surprised by the masses of humanity rubbing shoulders
text: with one another in the room.
text: O'Neill looks over from the other side of the room and spots
text: her. He isn't fooled for a minute by her wig and mini skirt.
text: He runs over to Rick.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: Guess who's here? Another surprise
dialog: guest.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: Debbie.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: My Debbie?
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: What's with her costume?
text: O'Neill points and Rick sees Debbie. She doesn't see them.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I don't know... Go up to her, make
dialog: like you don't know her and send her
text: into the other bedroom.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: You got it.
text: O'Neill crosses to Debbie.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Hi, baby. You're new here. I don't
dialog: think the groom's had you yet, has
dialog: he?
text: PUSH IN ON Debbie. She's pissed.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: No, not yet. Where is he?
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM
text: Rick opens the door from the bathroom. The lights are turned
text: off and from the flashing illumination of a neon sign outside
text: the window we can MAKE OUT the outline of Debbie's body on
dialog: the bed.
speaker_heading: RICK
text: I can't see anything.
text: Debbie, in a disguised Southern accent, speaks out.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Don't turn on the lights, sugar.
dialog: (seductively)
dialog: I'll lead you around.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Why don't you get undressed.
text: Rick starts to undress. While undressing, he takes on the
text: persona of Mr. Rodgers. He sings Rodgers' opening theme in
text: that same sappy, child-like manner of his.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (singing)
text: It's a lovely day in the neighborhood.
dialog: It's a lovely day, it's a beauty,
dialog: would you be mine, could you be mine.
dialog: (he's now stripped
dialog: down to his underwear)
dialog: ...Please won't you be my neighbor.
dialog: (as Mr. Rodgers)
dialog: Hi... Hi there... Today we're going
dialog: to learn about anatomy...
text: He jumps on top of her and starts mauling her passionately.
text: Debbie snaps on the lights. She throws off her wig and she
text: and Rick come face to face.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Debbie... you're a hooker! I can't
dialog: believe it!
text: She all but jumps out of bed.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I can't trust you!
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: C'mon, I knew it was you.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (holding back tears)
dialog: Rick, you're lying!
text: As Rick protests, she throws on her blouse and runs out of
text: the room. Rick charges after her.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE - MAIN ROOM
text: The place is wall to wall people.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - DEBBIE
text: She tries to make her way to the exit, but her path is slowed
text: by all the happy revelers.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (yelling over the
dialog: din; furious)
dialog: Let go of me!
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (yelling back)
dialog: Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do
dialog: anything, hardly.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: The marriage is off. Now you can
dialog: screw around with your friends for
dialog: the rest of your life.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I don't want that. I want to be with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: And I want to be with someone who
dialog: understands the meaning of the word
dialog: commitment.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I am committed. I love you.
text: Just then Desiree and Mr. Thomerson cross THROUGH FRAME.
text: She's leading him around by the silver chain, which is now
text: attached to his neck. She's also carrying a leather whip.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I don't believe you.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
text: Rick gets up on the sofa and yells loudly over the din.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: People! Can I have your attention...
dialog: people!
text: Everyone stops what they're doing and looks up.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I want to ask you all a question.
dialog: Have I had sex with anybody in this
dialog: room tonight?
text: There's a negative response from the crowd.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Are you sure?
text: Everyone responds positively.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Thank you.
text: All the guests go back to partying. Rick drops off the sofa
text: and faces Debbie.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: See? And these are not just ordinary
dialog: party-goers -- there are professionals
dialog: in this crowd -- I didn't want any
dialog: of them. You... You're what I want.
dialog: Understand?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (melted)
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Great. Now, what do you want to do
dialog: about it?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (sexy)
dialog: Let's get naked.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: You're on.
text: She takes him by the hand and crosses into the other bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. OTHER BEDROOM
text: Rick and Debbie enter. To their surprise they find a man
text: wearing a leather mask tied to the bed and happily licking
text: Desiree's boots, which she dangles in front of him. She also
text: holds a whip over his head. Despite the mask, there is
text: something very familiar about his face, and the white powder
text: encrusted all over his nose.
text: Debbie picks up on this immediately.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: Daddy?
text: Sure enough, Mr. Thomerson looks up and grimaces, knowing
text: he's been caught with his bondage down. He tries to say
text: something, but the boot in his mouth prevents anything
text: intelligent from coming out.
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
dialog: Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Of course, sir. That explains it.
dialog: Leather is a very good source of
dialog: vitamin E.
scene_heading: INT. SUITE - MAIN ROOM
text: The party has reached fever pitch. Suddenly police SIRENS
text: pierce through the party sounds. Everyone freezes. We HEAR
text: the Hotel Manager BEATING on the DOOR with his fists.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR
text: The Manager is pounding on the door. By his side are several
scene_heading: UNIFORMED POLICE.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: You're all under arrest. Open up!
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (to everyone in the
dialog: room)
dialog: Your attention, please. May I be the
dialog: first to say, It's a raid!
text: Everyone starts to panic and run for the doors.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (continuing)
text: I'm glad no one is panicking.
text: He snaps up his clothes from the bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: (to Police)
dialog: Break it in, boys!
text: The cops rear back for a run at the door. At that moment the
text: hotel door opens up and the cops and the Manager are trampled
text: by Rick, Debbie, Mr. Thomerson, Rick's gang, other guests
text: and assorted hookers. They run down the stairs. The cops
text: pick themselves up and give chase. The Manager looks inside
text: the room and is devastated by what he sees... Hiroshima looked
text: better after the A-bomb.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY
text: We SEE the police have collared Bobbie, Phoebe, Mrs. Thomerson
dialog: and the other ladies of the shower as hooker suspects. Our
text: bachelor party mob now charges down the stairs and out the
text: hotel doors.
text: The cops grab Mr. Thomerson as he tries to get out, and they
text: throw him in line with the others. Unfortunately for him,
text: he's standing next to Mrs. Thomerson.
scene_heading: MRS. THOMERSON
dialog: Ed! What are you doing here?
text: Before he can answer, Mrs. Thomerson checks out his shocking
dialog: leather outfit.
scene_heading: MRS. THOMERSON
dialog: (angry)
dialog: Ed... you're kinky!
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
dialog: The phone made me do it!
scene_heading: MRS. THOMERSON
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: You've been having strange sex...!
scene_heading: MR. THOMERSON
dialog: No, Brett, I...
scene_heading: MRS. THOMERSON
dialog: It's all right...
dialog: (proudly)
dialog: So have I.
text: He is totally blown away by this as the cops lead them out
text: of the room.
scene_heading: MRS. THOMERSON
dialog: I've seen another man's diddly.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL - MORNING
text: Our people pile out of the hotel. Rick, Debbie and all Rick's
text: friends run down the street.
text: Suddenly a Porsche pulls up between Rick and Debbie. It's
text: Cole. He reaches over and pulls Debbie into the car with
text: him. She screams.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Cole, what the hell are you doing?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: She's mine!
text: He drives off.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: He's kidnapped her! Everyone into
dialog: the bus!
text: They all board the bus.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET
text: As Cole rounds a corner, a tire comes loose and rolls off
text: the car -- thanks to Chulo's shoddy workmanship.
scene_heading: INT. PORSCHE
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
text: He looks to the rear and sees Rick's bus not far behind them.
text: Suddenly he spots something O.S. He grabs Debbie and runs
scene_heading: OUT OF FRAME.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET
text: A city maintenance truck is driving slowly down the center
text: of the street. A man in the back of the truck is leisurely
text: placing orange cones in the center line of the road.
text: Cole, with Debbie in tow, grabs the truck's DRIVER and hauls
text: him out of his seat. He then places Debbie inside the truck
text: and him at the wheel. He peels out. Our man with the cones
text: in the back is unaware of what has happened. He keeps placing
text: the cones on the street. However, now the truck is hitting
text: speeds in the upper 70's. The man's leisure pace speeds up.
text: He rapidly places cones on the road at break-neck speed.
scene_heading: INT. RICK'S BUS
text: Rick, is plowing into the cones and knocking them all over.
scene_heading: MAINTENANCE TRUCK
text: Our man with the cones is almost completely exhausted.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY
text: Rick is in pursuit, knocking over cones. He's almost caught
dialog: up with Cole.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
text: The vehicles reach the top of the hill. Cole grabs a sharp
text: left and pulls into a movie theater parking lot. The maneuver
text: loses Rick for a second. Rick jams on the brakes and doubles
text: back into the parking lot.
scene_heading: EXT. MOVIE THEATER PARKING LOT
text: Cole pulls up with a SCREECH in front of the theater. He
text: grabs Debbie and jumps out of the truck. He drags her into
text: the theater entrance.
text: Rick brings his bus to a stop and he and the gang pour out
dialog: of the bus.
speaker_heading: COLE
text: He and Debbie stand outside the
text: theater, which is a multi-plex cinema.
dialog: Fourteen movie theaters under one
text: roof. Prominent is a sign which reads:
text: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags
text: Debbie into one of the theaters. The
text: gang runs up to the theaters.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Fan out and look for them.
text: They all go running into various theaters.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - RYKO
text: He approaches a theater and sees the title of the movie
text: playing inside.
speaker_heading: RYKO
dialog: Aw, I've seen this one already.
text: Rick chooses a theater and goes inside.
scene_heading: INT. MOVIE THEATER
text: The patrons are wearing their 3D glasses, watching the action
text: on the screen. On the movie screen we SEE a man and a woman
text: arguing. Cole and Debbie enter the theater. They run down to
text: the front of the screen, heading for an exit. Rick enters.
text: He gives chase and catches up with Cole.
text: He takes a swing at Cole and Cole swings back. Behind them
text: on the screen a man has come to the rescue of the woman.
text: A fight starts in the movie, also. The patrons sit calmly
text: watching the action. Miraculously, Rick's fight with Cole is
text: in perfect sync with the actors in the movie. Rick hits Cole
text: with a punch that sends him backwards into several movie
text: patrons. The patrons are impressed by the realism of the
text: film's special effects. Cole throws a punch. Rick ducks. The
text: punch hits a MAN in the front row in the mouth.
