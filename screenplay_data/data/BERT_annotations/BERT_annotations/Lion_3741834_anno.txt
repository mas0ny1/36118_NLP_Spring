dialog: [*Note: throughout, all dialogue is in the appropriate
dialog: dialect/language, with subtitles where appropriate. In Khandwa,
text: Saroo's home town, this is Hindi; in Calcutta, where he is

scene_heading: EXTREME HIGH AERIAL - DAY (1987)
dialog: We're soaring - 20,000 feet above this vast island earth -
scene_heading: VERY HIGH AERIAL - DAY
text: 15,000 feet now - we’re soaring over a dark emerald ocean -
scene_heading: HIGH AERIAL - ABOVE INDIA - DAY
text: 4,000 feet, whooshing effortlessly over cities, villages,
dialog: countryside, rail lines - all the mad glory of India -
scene_heading: AERIAL - INDIA - DAY
text: 2,000 feet, soaring, slowing, high above an ochre landscape -
text: - way down there: a TINY FIGURE picks its way through the
text: fringes of a small trash heap by a dam -
scene_heading: AERIAL - ABOVE FIELD NEAR DAM, KHANDWA - CONTINUOUS (DAY)
text: 20 feet above ground now, we’re following that tiny figure (a
text: SMALL BOY) from behind, as he scampers through the trash -
scene_heading: EXT. RUBBISH-STREWN FIELD NEAR DAM, KHANDWA - CONTINUOUS
text: His TINY HANDS come into frame. Scavenging.
text: IN TIGHTER: the same hands. Clearly a practised routine.
text: A YELLOW BUTTERFLY flutters onto the hand. The hand STILLS,
dialog: so as not to scare the butterfly.
text: Our tiny figure (SAROO, 5) stands up, ever so carefully.
text: FRONT ANGLE: we see him properly for the first time. Studying
text: the butterfly. Entranced. Then he notices a few more.
text: WIDER: he’s in a field entirely filled with their fluttering.
text: Delighted, he spreads his arms wide. He moves through the
text: butterflies - fluttering all around his head and shoulders.
text: Suddenly - a 5-year-old testing his powers - he ROARS -
speaker_heading: SAROO
speaker_heading: ROARRRGHHH! !
text: - laughing - the butterflies scatter all around him -
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Saroo! Saroo!
text: In the distance, up on the railway line that runs along the
text: ridge, a silhouette. Saroo’s BROTHER (GUDDU, 12) waves.
scene_heading: EXT. RAILWAY TRACKS - AFTERNOON
text: Saroo and Guddu hide in wait in the shrubs along the track.
text: A huge COAL TRAIN lumbers toward them, picking up speed.
text: Guddu bursts out - clambers up onto the moving train.
text: Saroo runs alongside, terrified and at the same time loving
text: the thrill. His bare feet hurting on the rough ground.
text: Guddu effortlessly swings himself onto the open coal car.
speaker_heading: GUDDU
dialog: Keep up! Keep up!
text: Guddu starts throwing coal off the train, into the makeshift
text: net of Saroo’s shirt - mostly missing.
text: At any moment Saroo could go under those giant wheels.
text: Along the tracks: THREE MEN (SECURITY) give chase, shouting.
text: Guddu clambers down. The boys scramble for stray lumps of
text: coal. But they don’t have much time; the men are gaining.
text: They peel off into the dense scrub, giggling as they sprint
text: well-trodden short-cuts; the men begin to recede, B/G.
scene_heading: EXT. KHANDWA STREETS - AFTERNOON
text: Bustling Khandwa. Colors, street stalls, people everywhere.
text: Saroo and Guddu stride confidently through all this, holding
text: their pregnant coal bellies in place. They know this routine.
scene_heading: EXT. KHANDWA MARKETS - SOON AFTER (AFTERNOON)
text: They dump the coal into a STREET VENDOR’s bucket.
text: As the vendor ladles out a small plastic bag of warm milk
text: from a bubbling vat, Saroo notices something to his side -
text: POV, as in a dream: in another vat, rich, deep-orange Jalebis
text: sizzle - an unattainable feast that makes Saroo salivate.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (nudges Guddu)
dialog: Guddu ... Jalebis ...
text: Guddu looks at them too; for a beat we see beyond the boys’
text: deep hunger - they’re just kids, yearning for a sweet.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD HOME TO GANESH TALAI - SOON AFTER (DUSK)
text: They run along the road home. Joyful, free. A job well done.
text: Turning into the final alley, they pass a house with a lurid
text: aqua wall, and a hedge of overflowing bougainvillea.
text: All the while we keep our eye on that little plastic bag.
scene_heading: INT. ONE-ROOM HOME - SOON AFTER (EVENING)
text: Home is a dirt-floor shack. Kerosene lamp. Bare walls. Coal
text: fire in the corner. Plastic dish tub. Subsistence living.
text: Saroo’s MOTHER (KAMLA, 30 - beautiful, but lined by life)
text: ladles dhal onto plates for Saroo, Guddu, and SHEKILA (2).
text: KALLU (a boy, 9 - Saroo and Guddu’s brother, cheeky, flighty)
text: enters, sits, unwrapping a cloth containing scraps of bread.
speaker_heading: KALLU
dialog: I got the bread!
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (it’s competitive)
dialog: We got the milk!
text: They devour the meal in silence. We study each person.
text: Kamla unties the plastic bag, pours the milk into a bowl. She
text: dips a crust of bread and gives it to Shekila to suckle on.
text: Guddu, Kallu, and Saroo take a sip each and pass the bowl.
text: Saroo offers the bowl to his mother. She smiles a gentle No.
text: Saroo grins at Guddu. So proud of their milk escapade.
text: Kallu ups and leaves as fast as he came.
scene_heading: INT. ONE-ROOM HOME - SOON AFTER (EVENING)
text: Saroo lies with Shekila on her little “cot” - barely a scrap
text: of mattress - on the floor. Soothing her, stroking her head.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Shhh. Shhh.
text: Saroo lifts his head, looks at Kamla as she drapes her head
text: with a silk sari and begins to head out.
text: She looks back at his questioning little face.
speaker_heading: KAMLA
dialog: You know I have to work.
scene_heading: INT. ONE-ROOM HOME - SOON AFTER (EVENING)
text: Stillness of the night outside. Shekila sleeps; Saroo nearly
text: there. But when Guddu slips out the door, Saroo sees him go.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY BEHIND ONE-ROOM HOME - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)
text: Guddu wrestles his rickety bicycle from its hiding place.
speaker_heading: SAROO (0.S.)
dialog: How long this time?
text: Guddu turns to see Saroo standing there.
speaker_heading: GUDDU
dialog: You did good today, Saroo.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: I want to come with you. How long?
speaker_heading: GUDDU
dialog: A week. You have to mind Shekila.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Kallu will be back.
speaker_heading: GUDDU
dialog: You're too little to carry sacks.
dialog: It’s very hard work.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: I can carry anything!
text: Guddu smiles, amused. Really?
text: With great effort, Saroo lifts up the bicycle, holds it aloft
text: above his head, like a weight-lifter. Straining.
speaker_heading: GUDDU
dialog: Okay. Put it down.
text: Guddu laughs at the absurdity and sheer balls.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERPASS AND BUSY STREETS - SOON AFTER (NIGHT)
text: Travelling at breakneck speed - Saroo joyfully perched on the
text: handlebars - the boys emerge from the underpass.
text: The busy streets whizzing past. Guddu the daredevil.
speaker_heading: A YOUNG MAN
dialog: Go, Guddu!
dialog: On Saroo: so proud of his big brother. This is living!
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN TO BURHANPUR - LATER (NIGHT)
text: Saroo and Guddu standing on a crowded night train. Hemmed in.
scene_heading: INT. SAME TRAIN - LATER (NIGHT)
text: The majority of the crowd are disembarking at a station.
text: In a deftly-practised move, Saroo and Guddu scurry like
text: monkeys under the seats, scavenging for scraps.
text: On Guddu: he finds a peso. (It’s about 1/100th of a Rupee.)
speaker_heading: GUDDU
dialog: Peso!
text: On Saroo: he grabs something. A peanut. He cracks the shell -
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Guddu!
text: He splits the single peanut in two, and they eat it.
scene_heading: INT. SAME TRAIN - LATER (NIGHT)
text: The train is moving again. Plenty of seats now.
text: Saroo looks totally exhausted, his head resting on Guddu.
text: Guddu strokes Saroo, dreamily staring out into the blackness.
scene_heading: EXT. BURHANPUR PLATFORM - LATER (NIGHT)
text: The train pulls into Burhanpur Station. The PASSENGERS
text: disembark. Last off is Guddu, carrying sleeping Saroo.
text: Guddu sits Saroo down on a bench.
speaker_heading: GUDDU
dialog: Saroo - wake up!
text: Saroo simply groans, and curls up sideways.
speaker_heading: GUDDU (CONT'D)
dialog: You have to walk.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (whiny)
dialog: I’m asleep ...
speaker_heading: GUDDU
dialog: You're too little for late nights!
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: I’m asleep ... Don’t bother me.
text: Guddu looks around. Annoyed with himself. Back to Saroo:
speaker_heading: GUDDU
dialog: I'll go sort things for tomorrow.
dialog: Then we can find a place to sleep.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Bring back a thousand jalebis.
speaker_heading: GUDDU
dialog: Very funny. Wait here. You don’t
dialog: move, okay?
text: Guddu leaps off the end of the platform. Familiar with it.
text: ON Saroo: deep asleep in an instant.
text: ON Guddu: tiny figure, hopping his way along the tracks.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
scene_heading: EXT. BURHANPUR PLATFORM - LATER (VERY LATE NIGHT)
text: FADE UP: Saroo wakes. The platform now all but deserted -
text: empty, haunted. A few scattered, shadowy MEN in the distance.
text: Saroo looks around. Coming to consciousness. Where is Guddu?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Guddu?
text: Those shadowy MEN in the distance, huddled, smoking.
dialog: We feel Saroo’s total vulnerability to this weird open space.
text: A big empty train, standing in front of him.
speaker_heading: SAROO (CONT'D)
dialog: Guddu?
text: He looks up at the giant WATER TOWER behind the platform.
text: Looming, almost alive - like some brooding iron monster.
dialog: What to do? Where on earth is Guddu? One of the shadowy men
text: gives Saroo one of those stares that never break.
text: A moment of decision. CLOSE on Saroo.
text: And just like that - step! - Saroo steps up onto the train.
scene_heading: INT. CARRIAGE - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)
text: Little Saroo just stands there. The carriage is dark, empty.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Guddu?
text: He walks down the aisle to the end of the carriage. He tries
text: the connecting door. It’s locked.
text: He stands in the doorway, looking out. Still no Guddu.
text: He retreats back inside. Safer here.
text: He sits. Knees drawn. Taking in the measure of this new empty
text: space. His lids heavy. He lies there. Spooked, but fading.
text: He curls up. Fighting sleep so hard. Then his lids fall shut.
speaker_heading: HARD CUT:
scene_heading: INT. CARRIAGE - DAY
text: Daylight. CLOSE on Saroo, eyelids flickering in sleep, head
text: rocking gently, as a sunbeam creeps across his face.
text: AUDIO: the distant, soothing clickety-clack of the train.
text: POV: we’re in a sun-drenched, empty train carriage. (And
text: suddenly that clickety-clack is pretty damn loud.)
text: ON Saroo: as he lurches awake. His catastrophe has begun.
text: As he stands up, taking in his surroundings, sheer terror -
text: - he’s like a feral animal, realizing it’s trapped.
text: He slaps his hands to the window, looks out.
text: Panicking, he jumps across the aisle. Looks out.
text: He runs up the aisle. Tries the lock of the connecting door.
text: The main door: locked. Distraught, he looks out the window.
text: POV (REVERSE): an endless expanse of ochre plains racing by.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (through the bars)
dialog: Guddu! Ammi!* [*Mummy] Shekila!
text: He sits back, mind racing. Frozen, mute.
scene_heading: HIGH AERIAL - CONTINUOUS (DAY)
text: The train hurtles across the land. [We note the rest of the
text: train is crowded. Only the last carriage, Saroo’s, is empty.]
scene_heading: INT. CARRIAGE - LATER (AFTERNOON)
text: Time has passed. Saroo is staring numbly at the ceiling.
text: The train lurches, slows. Saroo tenses. Jumps up, hopeful.
text: Out the window (POV): we’ve entered a mid-sized TOWN.
text: The train comes to a stop at last. But where is the platform?
text: Saroo cranes his neck at the window bars once again.
text: POV (REVERSE): oblique angle, partial view, we catch a
text: GLIMPSE of the human activity on the platform further along.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN ON SMALL-TOWN PLATFORM (ESTABLISHING) - CONTINUOUS
text: WIDE EXTERIOR, we now see what’s actually going on: Saroo’s
text: carriage, the last one, hangs over the end of the platform.
text: Little Saroo, craning at the bars of a window.
scene_heading: INT. CARRIAGE - SECONDS LATER (AFTERNOON)
text: Saroo is back at the carriage door, trying the handle, on tip-
text: toes trying to get a glimpse out the window.
text: (His POV): just near him, legs dangling over the end of the
text: platform, sits a single STREET URCHIN (10), black with grime.
text: Saroo bangs on the door window.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Help me!
scene_heading: EXT. PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS (AFTERNOON)
text: From the urchin’s POV: Saroo, trapped behind the dirty pane.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Help me!
text: The urchin stares blankly at Saroo. In his own desolation, he
text: can’t find the energy to even engage, let alone help.
speaker_heading: SAROO (CONT’D)
dialog: Please! Help me!
text: But the train begins to pull out. Gathering speed.
text: The urchin turns his head, and gazes at Saroo, receding.
scene_heading: INT. CARRIAGE - CONTINUOUS (AFTERNOON)
text: As the train continues to gather speed we see, over Saroo’s
text: shoulder, all the people on the crowded platform flashing by.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (flailing, screaming)
dialog: Help! Help!
text: But not a soul notices him - and then the station is gone.
scene_heading: HIGH AERIAL - AFTERNOON
text: The train continues across the vast landscape, whose colors
text: have shifted now - less ochre, more verdant.
scene_heading: INT. CARRIAGE - LATER (LATE AFTERNOON)
text: Saroo, just sitting. Weeping forlorn, hopeless tears.
scene_heading: INT. CARRIAGE - LATER (NIGHT)
text: NIGHT. Saroo on all fours under the seats again, scavenging.
text: He lunges for a peach stone. Well and truly eaten. He gnaws
text: and sucks on it ravenously, getting at the last strands.
scene_heading: INT. CARRIAGE, SLOWING INTO CALCUTTA - LATER (NIGHT)
text: Saroo watches out the window a dark, unfamiliar CITY
text: streaming past. A vast SHANTY TOWN at night. And such NOISE!
text: The train begins to slow, noticeably. Saroo, pressed to the
text: window, wide-eyed. Scared. But desperate to get off!
scene_heading: INT. CARRIAGE, ARRIVING AT HOWRAH STATION - LATER (NIGHT)
text: As the train lurches to a stop, Saroo is poised at the door,
text: tensed, wary, alert. PEOPLE crowd the door.
text: To Saroo, they seem frightening, ugly: a Boschean nightmare
text: of faces, all crowding at the door.
text: How’s this going to work? His hand tight on the handle.
text: AUDIO: a HYDRAULIC AIR RELEASE SOUND, and the door unlocks.
text: It slides OPEN, and instantly the CROWDS are PILING IN.
text: Saroo, caught off-guard, pushes forward. THROWS himself into
text: the crowd, like a stage diver. No way he isn’t getting off.
scene_heading: EXT. HOWRAH PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)
text: The HORDES push on board as tiny Saroo fights his way out.
text: Desperate. Lunging. Swimming his way through them.
text: He pops clear. Free. But then, before him: the chaos of
text: Howrah, Calcutta’s main terminus - 26 platforms. WIDE, the
text: place is indescribably vast. The size of a small town.
text: He turns in a circle - every direction equally hopeless.
text: He steps up to a WOMAN.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Ganestlay?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (waving him off)
dialog: I have no money.
text: To a MAN IN RAILWAY UNIFORM walking by:
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Ganestlay?
dialog: 10
text: But the man keeps walking.
text: Saroo sees ANOTHER OFFICIAL. He tugs on the man’s trousers.
text: But the man just BATS Saroo away - a real clip on the ears.
text: Turning in a bewildered circle, Saroo spots a STREET KID (5)
text: drinking from a water fountain then walking off.
text: Saroo steps up, tippy-toes, and drinks. And drinks. Two days
text: without food or water. This is the Fountain of Life.
text: Then his eyes search for that street kid.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)
text: Up the far end of the platform, the kid sits down with a
text: bunch of STREET KIDS, all of them so blackened with grime.
text: CLOSER: some rowdy, some quiet. Some already asleep.
text: ON SAROO: studying them. Cautiously approaching.
text: He sits, twenty metres away, eyeing them warily.
text: ON THE CHILDREN: a wild, dangerous energy.
text: A WIRY BOY, 10, returns Saroo’s stare. No invitation here.
text: He’s not being accepted. Eyes at ten paces.
text: LATER. Saroo sleeps - sitting up, knees drawn, head drooping.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
scene_heading: OVER THE BLACKNESS (PRE-LAP): a SHRIEKING STATION WHISTLE -—
scene_heading: EXT. HOWRAH PLATFORM - MORNING
text: Saroo, standing in front of a packed train about to leave, on
text: the platform where he arrived yesterday.
text: That WHISTLE blows again. The train lurches into movement.
text: Saroo’s mind ticking. Here it is. The chance to go home.
text: At the last possible moment Saroo leaps on the moving train.
scene_heading: INT. CROWDED TRAIN - CONTINUOUS (MORNING)
text: Saroo pushes inside, stands there holding the pole.
text: Taking everyone in. He tugs on a LADY’s sari.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Ganestlay?
text: The woman grunts - huh? - and looks away.
text: Saroo pushes through. Asks a MAN.
dialog: 11
speaker_heading: SAROO (CONT’D)
dialog: Ganestlay?
text: Nothing. The man just looks away.
text: On Saroo: the invisible boy. Looking up at all these ADULTS.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN (ESTABLISHING) - NIGHT
text: The train hurtles along, now through the night.
scene_heading: EXT. UNNAMED STATION - MORNING
text: The train pulls into a TERMINUS, where EVERYONE alights.
text: Saroo jumps up from under that seat. Instantly awake, he runs
dialog: for the door. Excited. This should be Ganestlay.
text: He stands in the doorway - lost, looking up the platform, the
text: carriage behind him now empty. This is not Ganestlay.
scene_heading: A STATION GUARD
dialog: (re: the empty train)
dialog: This one terminates here.
text: Saroo doesn’t understand a word he says.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Ganestlay?
speaker_heading: STATION GUARD
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Go! Shoo!
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Ganestlay?
text: The guard points to the crowded train on the other platform.
speaker_heading: STATION GUARD
dialog: Two minutes. Go!
dialog: To Saroo, that’s a Yes to the Ganestlay question.
text: As he sprints up the overpass to the train on the opposite
dialog: platform, we feel his rush of hope.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - MOMENTS LATER (MORNING)
text: Saroo jumps on, squeezes through the crush. So tiny.
text: He perches himself at a window - on the edge of his seat -
text: looking out - ahead. Could this really be it?
text: He catches a LADY looking at him.
dialog: 12
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (pleased with himself)
dialog: Ganestlay.
text: She smiles. Whatever he’s saying, the little kid is sweet.
text: He points out the window, as the train starts to move.
speaker_heading: SAROO (CONT’D)
dialog: Ganestlay.
dialog: The lady doesn’t understand. But perhaps she can be helpful.
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: Calcutta.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (trying the word)
dialog: Cal-cutta.
text: It dents his optimism a little. He’s so easily confused.
dialog: “Calcutta”. What the hell is she talking about?
text: He notices a SCHOOL GIRL staring at him. His filthy clothes.
text: He’s already beginning to look like those street kids.
scene_heading: I/E. (TRAVELLING) TRAIN TO CALCUTTA - AFTERNOON
text: Saroo, leaning out the open doorway - calm, content. In his
text: bones: soon home will reappear.
text: CLOSER on Saroo as confusion sets in. Then a sinking feeling:
text: WIDE (Saroo’s POV): we’re slowing, coming into ... Calcutta!
text: The SHANTY TOWN again. Howrah ahead in the distance. Oh, no.
scene_heading: EXT. HOWRAH STATION - SOON AFTER
text: We FOLLOW forlorn Saroo as he walks through the CROWDS across
text: the Howrah Station CONCOURSE and goes up to a TICKET BOOTH.
text: On tiptoes, his head barely appears at the window.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Ganestlay?
text: The MAN shoos him away, as people are piling up behind him.
speaker_heading: SAROO (CONT’D)
dialog: (more insistent)
dialog: Ganestlay?
text: The man is now impatient and shouts at Saroo; the PASSENGERS
text: push and slap him out of the way.
dialog: 13
scene_heading: INT. HOWRAH SUBWAY PASSAGE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Saroo, so tiny, as he walks along the VAST, CROWDED subway
text: passage (SINGLE SHOT, WIDE) - a subterranean nightmare.
scene_heading: EXT. TRACKS LEADING OUT FROM HOWRAH - DUSK
text: CLOSE: Saroo stands bathed in the late afternoon light -
text: gazing out at something. A gentle breeze on his face.
text: He looks left. Looks right. Looks ahead. Then with a resigned
text: slump, he turns and walks off.
text: WIDE: he’s walking back (towards the station) across an
text: ENORMOUS COBWEB of entangled train tracks - an IMPENETRABLE
text: WEAVE that really shows just how impossible getting home is.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBWAY PLATFORM, HOWRAH STATION - NIGHT
text: LATE; the lost children are curled up, entangled, asleep.
text: Forlorn Saroo sits down - same wary distance as the other
text: night. His eyes tired and red. His grimy face tear-stained.
text: He now looks just like them - the transformation is complete.
text: Eye contact with Wiry Boy, who’s lying on a bed of cardboard.
text: Wiry Boy shifts, nods to Saroo - slides out one of the layers
text: of cardboard that make up his bed. Slides it over to Saroo.
dialog: Saroo - I can? An offer of extraordinary generosity.
text: Saroo walks over, takes it, lies down. A luxury.
text: Saroo nods Thank-you, smiles shyly. Wiry Boy nods solemnly.
text: As Saroo closes his eyes, we
text: FADE TO BLACK.
speaker_heading: SILENCE.
scene_heading: HARD CUT INTO:
scene_heading: EXT. SUBWAY PLATFORM, HOWRAH STATION - LATE NIGHT
text: - Saroo is woken by screaming and sudden pandemonium.
text: SHADOWY ADULTS are grabbing at the children - it is
dialog: terrifying and aggressive and chaotic -
speaker_heading: ADULTS
dialog: Come here! Hey! You!
text: - and the children are screaming in terror and scattering.
text: A STATION OFFICIAL casually lights a cigarette. (In his
dialog: nonchalance, a sense of the machinery of corruption.)
dialog: 14
text: Springing into survival mode, Saroo runs for his life -
text: straight up the end of the platform, and leaps straight off -
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS (LATE NIGHT)
text: - and into the tunnel. The last thing he sees, as he turns
text: for one last glance, is Wiry Boy being violently taken away.
text: Saroo sprints along the tunnel. A MAN chases.
text: ON Saroo: a heart-pounding chase. Rats scurrying everywhere.
speaker_heading: BODY SNATCHER
dialog: Hey! You come here! You come back!
text: Suddenly, danger: a train hurtling towards him.
text: Blinded, Saroo flattens himself against the wall, terrified.
text: The train barely misses him, as it blares past.
text: As Saroo stands there, pinned against the wall amid all the
text: electrical cables, head turned sideways, he sees -—
text: - along there, the body snatcher, also pressed to the wall.
text: Now the train is gone - and here comes the body snatcher -
text: - nowhere to go but forward - Saroo keeps sprinting - at last
text: the body snatcher gives up -
scene_heading: EXT. BETWEEN STATION AND RIVER - MOMENTS LATER (LATE NIGHT)
text: - Saroo emerges into the world outside the station - and sees
text: for the first time what he’s just been inside:
text: - the great red brick edifice that is Howrah - and beyond it,
text: huge HOWRAH BRIDGE. An eerie, haunting 3:00 a.m. Stillness.
text: From INSIDE comes a child’s SCREAM - which propels Saroo to
text: keep sprinting - away from the station - along the road -
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS (LATE NIGHT)
text: - straight up the stairs to a vast forbidding bridge - his
text: tiny legs struggling to keep going upwards, upwards ...
text: He reaches the top of the stairs. He looks ahead.
text: This bridge, stretching into the distance, is the biggest
dialog: thing he’s ever seen in his life.
text: Few cars on the road. Few PEOPLE on the footpath. Pollution
text: haze like a ghostly fog. It feels haunted.
text: Ahead: a couple of Calcutta’s WILD DOGS potter about. They
dialog: own this bridge at night.
text: Saroo inches backwards, scared and wary.
dialog: 15
text: He looks back down the stairs. No sign of the body snatcher.
text: But ahead, beyond those dogs: it’s too daunting. Too haunted.
text: Through the rails, down by the river bank, he sees: -
text: CANDLES, flickering. That looks the safer option.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVERBANK & KALI SHRINE - MINUTES LATER (LATE NIGHT)
text: We follow Saroo from blackness - to those candles flickering.
text: 15 BABAS (HOLY MEN) sleep: dirty robes, matted beards,
text: dreadlocks, red ochre faces. Peaceful.
text: They sleep facing a small platform shrine to goddess Kali
text: (the Destroyer). Bright painted Kali statue 4 feet high -
text: fierce, frightening, astride her lion.
text: Carefully, Saroo moves through the holy men, toward Kali.
text: Four arms, garland of skulls, riding a lion. Spooky.
text: At Kali’s feet, offerings: coconut shavings, pesos, nuts.
text: Saroo looks at the men again; no one seems to be stirring.
text: He bows quickly to Kali, and sneaks some of the offerings.
text: Spies a sliver of unpopulated ground.
text: He clambers in behind the small platform, lies down. Out of
text: trouble, out of sight. His own corner of this metropolis.
text: His eyes getting sleepy. Watching the sleeping holy men - and
text: beyond them, the dark, wide river, flowing by.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
text: Silence - a beat - then the sound of men murmuring, chanting.
speaker_heading: FADE UP TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RIVERBANK & KALI SHRINE - MORNING
text: The chanting grows louder. Saroo’s eyes, dreamy, open - lost
text: in the chanting. [It will act as a strange breathing space. ]
text: He stands. He comes out from behind the Kali shrine.
text: The Babas face him, meditating, chanting. As if Saroo, there
text: beside Kali on her lion, were a tiny god himself.
text: Saroo walks through the holy men, down to the river's edge.
text: No real purpose. The chanting is haunting, extraordinary.
dialog: 16
text: All the PEOPLE going through their morning rituals: bathing,
text: brushing their teeth, scrubbing pots. Saroo separate. Lost.
text: Observing everyone. They all seem to know what they’re doing.
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT:
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM, HOWRAH STATION - A WHILE LATER (DAY)
text: The chanting continues, as Saroo wanders, back at that place
text: from where he fled last night. It’s empty and desolate now.
text: He doesn’t look terrified. Just lost. He sees what he wants:
text: - on the ground, the cardboard that Wiry Boy gave him.
text: He picks it up. His “bed”. Planning ahead. He drags it away.
scene_heading: EXT. ALONG THE RAILWAY TRACKS, HOWRAH STATION - AFTERNOON
text: Saroo wanders by the side of the tracks, with his cardboard
text: sheet. Past the BLACK METAL POOLS where MEN and BOYS sift for
text: metals from construction waste. Then up a tiny path.
text: He comes across a WOMAN (NOOR, 40) carrying tin lunch boxes.
text: She turns as they pass. Watches him.
speaker_heading: NOOR
dialog: It’s dangerous walking here.
text: Saroo stops. Stands there, quietly, innocently.
speaker_heading: NOOR (CONT'D)
dialog: You speak Bengali?
text: Saroo doesn’t seem to understand the question.
speaker_heading: NOOR (CONT'D)
dialog: (in Hindi)
dialog: You speak Hindi?
text: A beat. Saroo nods, Yes.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: I got lost.
speaker_heading: NOOR
dialog: Where are you from?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Ganestlay.
speaker_heading: NOOR
dialog: Where is that?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Home.
dialog: 17
speaker_heading: NOOR
dialog: I don’t know where that is.
text: A beat. She seems concerned. Saroo, so vulnerable.
speaker_heading: NOOR (CONT'D)
dialog: What is your name?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Saroo.
speaker_heading: NOOR
dialog: I am Noor.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Are you hungry?
text: She motions with the lunch boxes. Saroo nods, follows.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL, APARTMENT BLOCK - SOON AFTER (AFTERNOON)
text: Saroo follows Noor up the stairs of her building -
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - MOMENTS LATER (AFTERNOON)
text: - they come out onto the amazing rooftop - Saroo has never
dialog: been anywhere high before - Calcutta stretches before him -
text: (POV): the view reveals KIDS playing on LOWER ROOFTOPS -
text: kites - a sense of community - the sounds of kids playing -
speaker_heading: NOOR
dialog: - Come -
text: She lives up here! He follows her into her rooftop shack -
scene_heading: INT. NOOR’S ROOFTOP HOME - CONTINUOUS (AFTERNOON)
text: Saroo, wide-eyed, walks across to the windows -—
text: (POV): amazing views across the RAILWAY YARDS; HOWRAH BRIDGE
text: in the distance; everywhere, golden afternoon light.
scene_heading: INT. NOOR’S ROOFTOP HOME - LATER (LATE AFTERNOON)
text: Saroo sits at a small table with Noor, shovelling lentils
text: into his mouth from a plastic plate. To him, a feast.
text: It’s as if he relaxes, a tiny notch. This woman feels safe.
speaker_heading: NOOR
dialog: (ironic)
dialog: Looks like you hate it!
text: Saroo looks up, mouth full, smiles at the humour.
dialog: 18
speaker_heading: NOOR (CONT'D)
dialog: I make the lunches for all the men.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You have to make a living.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: I help my brother carry bales.
speaker_heading: NOOR
dialog: You do?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: I help my mother carry rocks.
speaker_heading: NOOR
dialog: She works in a quarry?
text: Saroo nods Yes. His mouth still full, going full throttle.
text: Noor gazes at him. Sadness. Compassion.
text: From a TINY FRIDGE, she takes out an ORANGE SODA in a bottle.
text: She opens it and hands it to him.
text: Saroo looks down astonished at the bottle in his hands. He's
text: never had one of these. He looks up at her. She nods, Go on.
text: He puts the bottle to his lips. Drinks. Winces at the
text: bubbles. Looks up at her, and smiles.
text: Another sip. Amazing. Amazing. Suddenly: an enormous burp.
text: Saroo could cry, he’s so amazed. Instead, they laugh.
scene_heading: INT. NOOR’S ROOFTOP HOME - LATER (NIGHT)
text: Naked Saroo, head to toe in soap suds, stands in a plastic
text: tub in the corner, as Noor SCRUBS him vigorously.
text: His body being pummeled. It’s not at all unpleasant.
text: Noor ladles water, pours it over Saroo’s head. As the water
text: cascades and the suds wash away, he closes his eyes.
scene_heading: INT. ONE-ROOM HOME, KHANDWA - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
text: - and opens them, the water cascading off his face.
text: REVERSE: he’s looking at Kamla, bathing him.
text: Saroo blinks, looking at:
text: Kamla’s face, as she concentrates on washing him.
scene_heading: INT. NOOR’S ROOFTOP HOME - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)
text: Saroo blinks, looking at:
dialog: 19
text: Noor’s face - as she concentrates on washing him.
text: She takes his cheeks in her hand -
speaker_heading: NOOR
dialog: Open your mouth.
text: She moves his lips, inspects his teeth and gums.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM, NOOR’S ROOFTOP HOME - LATER (NIGHT)
text: Saroo, curled up on the tiny bed in the corner. Noor pads a
text: blanket down on top of him. Luxury.
speaker_heading: NOOR
dialog: (her voice soothing)
dialog: I know a man who is a very special
dialog: man. His name is Rama. He knows
dialog: many people. He will come tomorrow,
dialog: to help you.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: To find Ammi?
speaker_heading: NOOR
dialog: Yes, Ammi. You sleep now.
text: The day couldn’t get any better. Saroo smiles, eyes heavy.
text: Then, surrendering to his tiredness, he’s out like a light.
speaker_heading: HARD CUT:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM, NOOR’S ROOFTOP HOME - MORNING
text: Saroo opens his eyes. The light is blinding, almost heavenly.
text: He raises his head, looks through to the other room:
text: - where a handsome, impeccably dressed MAN (RAMA, 40) sits
text: with Noor at the table, finishing a small meal.
speaker_heading: RAMA
dialog: Oh, he is awake.
text: Rama walks into the bedroom. Perches on the bed.
speaker_heading: RAMA (CONT'D)
dialog: I wonder what worlds you have
dialog: travelled in. That was such a
dialog: sleep, young man.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (sitting up)
dialog: You are Rama?
speaker_heading: RAMA
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Yes, but not the god. And I have
dialog: been told you are lost.
dialog: 20
text: Saroo nods meekly, yes.
speaker_heading: RAMA (CONT'D)
dialog: I need to ask you some questions.
dialog: And you need to tell me all that
dialog: you can - so I can help you ...
dialog: What is your name?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Saroo.
speaker_heading: RAMA
dialog: Saroo. And you are from...?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Ganestlay.
speaker_heading: RAMA
dialog: It’s not a name that is familiar to
dialog: me. But we may be able to find it.
dialog: What is your family name?
text: Saroo looks up at the man, almost shameful. He doesn’t know.
speaker_heading: RAMA (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s all right, it’s not important.
text: Rama starts to lie down, and gestures Saroo to lie back down.
speaker_heading: RAMA (CONT'D)
dialog: Come lie down, I have come so far
dialog: to see you.
text: Saroo blinks twice. Is that a “no thanks” kind of question?
text: He lies down, tentatively. Rama pulls him in. A tiny bed.
speaker_heading: RAMA (CONT'D)
dialog: Tell me how you got here, Saroo.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: I went to the station with my
dialog: brother -
speaker_heading: RAMA
dialog: - and your brother is? -
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: - Guddu. And he went away. And he
dialog: didn’t come back -
text: - as Saroo talks, Rama casually strokes his hair - CLOSE, in
dialog: Saroo’s eyes: surely that’s not right -
speaker_heading: SAROO (CONT’D)
dialog: - so I rested on the train. But I
dialog: fell asleep. Then I couldn’t get
dialog: off. And the train came here.
dialog: 21
text: - Rama nods, murmurs encouragement, keeps stroking -
text: - Noor watches, blankly, from across the room -
speaker_heading: SAROO (CONT’D)
dialog: But I can’t find the train to get
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: RAMA
dialog: Saroo, you’re a good boy. Are you a
dialog: good boy?
text: Saroo nods earnestly. But also subtly shifts his head.
text: Rama sits up. Ruffles Saroo’s hair.
speaker_heading: RAMA (CONT'D)
dialog: I’1l1 tell you what. I’11 be back
dialog: tonight, and I’1l take you
dialog: somewhere good.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: To my mother?
speaker_heading: RAMA
dialog: Somewhere good. And from there
dialog: we'll try to find your mother.
dialog: These things are not always easy.
text: Saroo nods, confused, hopeful. Rama stands.
speaker_heading: RAMA (CONT'D)
dialog: Stand up for me. Let me see you.
text: Saroo stands on the bed. Rama admires him, pulls his arms -
text: like a man admiring strength or beauty in a son. Or
text: inspecting a horse. Saroo, passive, lets it happen.
text: Rama holds out his hand. Saroo, clearly not practiced in the
text: art of hand-shaking, offers his tiny hand.
speaker_heading: NOOR
dialog: Say thank you to Rama.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Thank you.
text: Rama leaves the bedroom, crosses the main room, kisses Noor
text: goodbye - slight sexual overtone - and passes out the door.
text: Saroo stands there on the bed, closely observing all this.
text: It’s all so strange. And not quite right.
text: The faint sound of children playing, 0/S.
scene_heading: INT. NOOR’S ROOFTOP HOME - LATER (DUSK)
text: Saroo sits, eating, as Noor stirs dhal in a pot.
dialog: 22
text: Another bottle of orange soda in front of him. Untouched.
text: He stares at the bottle. Then at Noor.
text: Busy with cooking, she half-sings along to some Bollywood
text: song on the radio. She looks over to Saroo and smiles.
text: He looks at the soda again. At Noor. Something stirring
dialog: inside him -
text: - and suddenly he simply ups from the table and makes a break
dialog: for it - straight out the door.
text: Noor SCREAMS - revealing the true animal she is.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL, APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS (DUSK)
text: - Saroo takes the stairs at lightning speed, Noor screaming
text: and chasing O/S behind him -—
text: - around one landing, a MAN lurches at him - misses -
dialog: - Saroo taking those steps faster that he’s ever run before -
scene_heading: EXT. PATHWAY OUTSIDE APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS (DUSK)
text: Saroo BURSTS OUT onto the pathway outside the apartment
text: building and scrambles away, up towards the city lights -
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS NEAR HOWRAH STATION - CONTINUOUS (DUSK)
text: - and into the busy dusk streets. He runs.
text: And runs, and runs, and runs —
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS (DUSK)
dialog: - right up those stairs to the Howrah Bridge. (This time:
text: trucks, cars, horns blaring, countless PEOPLE. No wild dogs.)
text: And this time, Saroo keeps right on running - zigzagging his
text: way through the CROWDS, a bundle of pure determination.
text: His little fists clenched. Glancing back, still fearful.
text: A marathon runner. And now we hear only his breath.
scene_heading: EXT. CALCUTTA STREETS - SOON AFTER (MONTAGE)
text: We TRACK him in PROFILE: framing consistency, fluid fades and
dialog: consistency of tracking speed mean it all looks like one
text: shot, even though B/G changes and it’s many different shots.
text: As if he’s running through all of India.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
text: OVER the blackness, the sound of RAIN. It pours. It pours.
dialog: 23
scene_heading: A SUPER: TWO MONTHS LATER
text: Then a tiny voice, coming up over the rain:
speaker_heading: SAROO (V.0., PRE-LAP)
dialog: Sorry. Sorry.
speaker_heading: FADE UP TO:
scene_heading: INT. CONCRETE HIDEY-HOLE - DAY
text: TIGHT on Saroo’s face - DARK, in the shadows - we’ve no idea
text: where it is - his face ever grimier.
text: It’s raining heavily. In the shadowy recess, he’s whispering:
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Sorry. Sorry. I'll come back. I’m
dialog: sorry, Ammi ...
scene_heading: EXT. DREAM QUARRY, KHANDWA - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: SUDDEN contrast from the darkness to brilliant white light.
text: A surreal landscape: mythological, prehistoric - rocky,
text: barren - white dust swirling like a fine talcum mist.
text: Saroo, scrambling over the rocks, like the first human ever.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Ammi! Ammi!
text: We’re in a quarry - and there in the distance is Kamla, the
text: hot winds flapping her sari about - she turns as he nears -
speaker_heading: KAMLA
dialog: Good boy.
text: Saroo starts helping - lifts a rock far too heavy for him.
speaker_heading: KAMLA (CONT'D)
dialog: (laughing as he struggles)
dialog: Not this one, Saroo. Get those
dialog: little ones.
text: He gathers a couple of rocks, drops them into her wooden hod.
speaker_heading: KAMLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Small ones at the back. That’s it.
dialog: Look at your muscles!
text: Saroo grins, flexes his muscles like a bodybuilder.
speaker_heading: KAMLA (CONT'D)
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Good boy. Good boy.
dialog: 24
scene_heading: INT. CONCRETE HIDEY-HOLE - DAY
text: Heart-wrenching - Saroo’s attempts at a nest, at belongings.
text: A filthy blanket; water bottle; broken toy car; mussel shell.
text: And another cardboard sheet. Which he’s lying on now, on his
text: belly, a torn Indian Vogue propped against the wall.
text: Saroo parks the toy car at the base of the Swiss mountain in
text: a Breitling watch ad. He loads the seashell onto the roof of
text: the car and drives it away, making little-child NOISES.
text: He fills the mussel shell with dirt and tiny pebbles, pushes
text: it to the corner, tips the contents out. Like Kamla’s hod.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Good boy. Good boy. That’s a good
dialog: boy. Good boy.
dialog: AUDIO: the rain easing.
scene_heading: EXT. CONCRETE HIDEY-HOLE - SOON AFTER (DAY)
text: The sun’s out, everything dripping. Saroo clambers down. (We
text: see how ingenious his nest is: a 4-feet-cubed concrete recess
text: between two pylons, 8 feet off the ground, hidden from view.)
text: The crows look down on him from the telegraph wires.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY
text: Saroo fossicks by the shore, where the garbage ebbs and bobs.
text: His little “scavenger bag” slung over his shoulder.
text: A DEAD BODY - a crippled beggar, lips blue, eyes lifeless -
text: stares at the sky in a death grimace. Saroo stares for a
text: moment. And then steps over it.
text: He finds a bent spoon. Inspects it. It looks like some rusted
text: relic from the Raj - an English serving spoon.
text: Pleased, he puts it in the scavenger bag.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: Saroo sits in a narrow traffic island in the middle of a
text: crazy busy street - buses and trucks in all directions.
text: He takes out the spoon, studies it again, straightens it.
text: Reaching back into the scavenge bag, he places a few grains
text: of rice and corn on the spoon.
text: Across the road at a cafe table, a MAN (pleasant-looking, a
text: student, 22, a book and cup of chai in front of him) watches -
dialog: fascinated.
text: Saroo feeds himself off the spoon, imagining a HUGE mouthful.
dialog: 25
text: To the man it’s heartbreaking - he’s drawn in by Saroo’s
text: “play”. At that moment their eyes meet. The man smiles.
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT:
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE, POLICE COMPLEX - SOON AFTER (DAY)
text: Saroo sits at a desk, tiny and bewildered in “officialdom"”,
text: as the café man speaks to a POLICE OFFICIAL (50).
speaker_heading: CAFE MAN
dialog: He speaks Hindi - not a word of
dialog: Bengali - so he must be a long way
dialog: from home. When I ask where he’s
text: from, he keeps saying “Ganestlay”.
dialog: It means nothing to me.
text: The official nods, walks over to an old WALL MAP of India.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICIAL
dialog: (to Saroo)
dialog: Now this ... “Ganestlay” —-
dialog: (pointing to all of India)
dialog: Do you think you might have a rough
dialog: idea where it is?
dialog: Saroo - the little prince of cluelessness.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICIAL (CONT’D)
dialog: Do you know which province? It
dialog: would help us a lot if you knew the
dialog: province.
text: Even as the words come out of his mouth, he understands the
text: stupidity of the question. But he hovers there, in hope.
text: Saroo stares at the map - that distinct triangle of India -
text: then the official, as if they’re both enormous blank walls.
text: The official sits. Glances at the café man.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICIAL (CONT’D)
dialog: Let's try something else. Do you
dialog: know your family name?
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE, POLICE COMPLEX - SOON AFTER (DAY)
text: FLASH! Saroo’s photo is taken.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT COUNTER, POLICE COMPLEX - SOON AFTER (DAY)
text: The official at a counter (Saroo on a bench, B/G, with the
text: café man) as a hardened OFFICER (he’s seen it all) takes
text: approximately five seconds to read Saroo’s two-page FILE.
text: STAMP! He stamps the file “LOST”. Staples the PHOTO to the
text: cover. Pulls out a separate page, Indian-bureaucracy-style.
dialog: 26
speaker_heading: HARDENED OFFFICER
dialog: (hands official the file)
dialog: That’s for ISSA.
dialog: (hands him the page)
dialog: That’s for Liluah.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICIAL
dialog: (slight frown)
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: HARDENED OFFFICER
dialog: (shrugs; not my problem)
text: While they process him.
text: ON THE POLICE OFFICIAL: he knows this is not great. He
text: composes himself, turns, smiles to Saroo and Café Man.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICIAL
dialog: They've found him a home - while
dialog: they look.
text: The man smiles, relieved. Ruffles Saroo’s hair.
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE VAN, STREET TO LILUAH GATE - AFTERNOON
text: We FOLLOW a dirty van down a narrow road along a high wall
text: topped with barbed wire and embedded broken glass.
scene_heading: INT. LILUAH VAN - CONTINUOUS (AFTERNOON)
text: In the back of the van, Saroo and four sullen STREET KIDS
text: sit, spooked, silent, tense, waiting - a haunting vigil of
text: expectation as the van rattles along.
text: (AUDIO, EXT:) The van’s horn HONKS; an iron gate creaks open.
scene_heading: CUT TO BLACK -
scene_heading: OVER THE BLACKNESS:
speaker_heading: A GUARD (0.S.)
speaker_heading: MOVE! MOVE!
text: Shuffling sounds, as the children move - and outside, the
text: various noises and echoes of a world we are about to reveal.
scene_heading: BURST INTO BRIGHTNESS:
scene_heading: EXT. LILUAH DETENTION CENTER - CONTINUOUS (AFTERNOON)
text: We emerge from the darkness, following the terrified children
text: following the barking guard into the bleak, sun-drenched
text: courtyard of the high-walled complex.
text: A shiver-up-the-spine wrongness about this decrepit, fortress-—
dialog: like place - no sense of a connection to the outside world.
text: Lonely chairs and rubbish lie on top of the wire-mesh “roof”.
dialog: 27
text: They pass rows of cells; children’s EYES stare from the dark.
dialog: On Saroo: what is this nightmare? He was desperate in
text: Calcutta; but there’s nothing but sorrow and suffering here.
scene_heading: INT. YOUNGER DORM, LILUAH - LATER (LATE AFTERNOON)
text: Saroo sits frozen, wary, on what passes for a bed.
text: Five other CHILDREN on beds, like spectres in the gloom.
text: Everyone looks traumatized; nobody speaks.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
text: OVER THE BLACKNESS we hear: the sounds of LOCKS OPENING,
text: CHAINS CLANGING, the big IRON FRONT GATE CREAKING OPEN -
text: FOOTSTEPS across the courtyard - two MEN talking - coming
text: closer, closer - and downstairs, into the quiet building -
scene_heading: INT. YOUNGER DORM, LILUAH - LATER (NIGHT)
text: FADE UP: a sweet 5-YEAR-OLD GIRL (AMITA) lies in bed in the
text: stillness, staring over at Saroo with huge unblinking eyes.
text: Saroo stares back. The sounds come closer.
text: Saroo turns and watches as the two men - one a GUARD, the
text: other a well-dressed OUTSIDER - stride past the open door.
text: A door opens (0/S, AUDIO). Whimpering - a scuffle - shouts.
text: Then Saroo catches a glimpse of a HAUNTED BOY (8) being
text: dragged past the door by the men. Terror in the boy’s eyes.
text: Saroo so wide-eyed and wide awake in the dark night.
text: AUDITORY SEQUENCE (while on Saroo): a confusing auditory
text: nightmare. Beatings. Cries of anguish. Rape.
text: Amita simply stares across to Saroo.
text: Then after a time, she closes her eyes.
text: Saroo stares at the ceiling, eyes wide. The noises continue.
scene_heading: INT. MESS HALL, LILUAH - MORNING
text: Saroo shovels the thin gruel into his mouth in cowed silence.
text: Amita by his side, doing the same.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: What is your name?
speaker_heading: SWEET GIRL
dialog: Amita.
dialog: 28
text: Saroo notices a GUARD escorting a kindly-looking lady (MRS
text: SOOD, 45) with files in hand, who seems to be pointing and
text: talking about particular kids with the guard.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Does anybody ever leave here,
dialog: Amita?
speaker_heading: AMITA
dialog: I've seen it.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: What will you do when you leave?
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: AMITA
dialog: I'd like to own a watch one day.
dialog: Long pause.
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM, LILUAH - DAY
text: Fifteen CHILDREN, nerves on edge, straining to get it right.
text: A SEVERE TEACHER barks the Sanskrit alphabet, pointing to the
text: letters on the blackboard as these illiterate kids repeat:
scene_heading: TEACHER CHILDREN
text: Kaa ... Gaa ... Naa ... Daa Kaa ... Gaa ... Naa ... [etc]
text: Saroo is earnestly trying to learn. He spots the haunted boy
text: from last night. A wild look in the boy's eyes: blank, angry.
text: All the children except for Haunted Boy are duly repeating
text: the alphabet. Saroo looking sideways, fascinated by him.
text: Haunted Boy swaying back and forwards, rubbing his hair and
text: forehead, looking like a pressure cooker about to explode.
text: He upturns his desk, WAILS a primal howl of pure distress.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: What is this?
text: The teacher starts raining blows upon Haunted Boy.
text: At first Haunted Boy just takes it, through clenched teeth -
text: - then he goes completely crazy, and fights back.
text: The teacher fights back even harder, screaming for help.
text: All the kids back away in a wide circle, scared, horrified.
text: Saroo, trying to shrink within himself.
dialog: 29
text: As the horrible struggle continues and two MALE TEACHERS rush
text: in and help beat down Haunted Boy - Saroo watching wide-eyed -
text: - LIVE SOUND FADES, and a beautiful, haunting little Hindi
text: folk song rises - Amita’s voice in PRE-LAP -
scene_heading: INT. YOUNGER DORM, LILUAH - NIGHT
text: Saroo lies listening, soothed, as Amita softly sings. The
text: song becomes the AUDIO “BED” as we travel over the landscape
text: of the various CHILDREN in this holding room of lost souls:
text: hands covered in scabs, eyes all staring. Listening.
text: Not a child in this room has any idea of their fate. The song
text: holds it all together: for this one moment, all are soothed.
text: ON SAROO: gradually, his eyes close.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
text: Over the black, a SUPER: THREE MONTHS LATER
scene_heading: HARD CUT INTO:
scene_heading: INT. YOUNGER DORM, LILUAH - MORNING
text: JOLTING AWAKE out of the dreamy song is Saroo, being shaken -—
speaker_heading: STAFF MEMBER
dialog: You. You have to come.
dialog: Sleepy Saroo is confused: what on earth could this mean?
scene_heading: INT. RECEPTION ROOM, LILUAH - SOON AFTER
text: We travel BEHIND Saroo as he’s led into an outer room
text: balcony. Kindly Mrs Sood stands as he enters.
speaker_heading: MRS SOOD
dialog: Good morning, Saroo.
dialog: He takes her in. Angel of Mercy or Angel of Death? She’s that
text: woman he briefly noticed on that first day in the mess hall.
speaker_heading: MRS SOOD (CONT’D)
dialog: My name is Mrs Sood. Sit. Sit.
dialog: (he sits, warily)
dialog: I run an organization called ISSA.
dialog: (in English:)
dialog: The “Indian Society for Sponsorship
dialog: and Adoption.”
dialog: (then says it in Hindi -)
text: Saroo listens, brow furrowed, a little astonished that this
text: woman is talking to him as if he’s an adult.
dialog: 30
speaker_heading: MRS SOOD (CONT'D)
dialog: This place is a home for the
dialog: deformed. For the mentally ill. For
dialog: juvenile delinquents. Or where
dialog: parents who cannot cope leave their
dialog: children. But you are none of
dialog: those. You are lost. I like to make
dialog: sure there’s no one here who should
dialog: be - elsewhere. That’s why I’m
dialog: here. Annoying them. Helping you.
dialog: (beat; opening his file)
dialog: I've been investigating your case
dialog: for a while now - we even placed
dialog: this ad in all the Calcutta
dialog: newspapers when you arrived here -
text: She shows him a cutting of a small classified ad in Sanskrit,
dialog: with that photo of Saroo we recognize from the police station
dialog: and, in English, “Indian Society for Sponsorship and
dialog: Adoption, 1 Kyd Street, Calcutta”.
text: Saroo stares at the photo of himself. Fascinated.
speaker_heading: MRS SOOD (CONT'D)
dialog: Fifteen million people read this.
dialog: That’s many, many people.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Not one reply, I’m afraid.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: I came from far away.
speaker_heading: MRS SOOD
dialog: Not one reply.
text: It’s a harsh truth and she doesn’t hide it. Saroo, desperate.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Ammi? [Mummy ]
speaker_heading: MRS SOOD
dialog: No ... no Ammi.
text: Saroo just sits there. Shocked. Silence. A long beat.
speaker_heading: MRS SOOD (CONT'D)
dialog: Saroo, do you know where Australia
dialog: is?
text: Saroo looks confused.
speaker_heading: MRS SOOD (CONT'D)
dialog: We found a family there who could
dialog: look after you.
text: As Saroo pulls back - What? - Mrs Sood gets that he
text: understands this means the search is over.
dialog: 
dialog: 31
speaker_heading: MRS SOOD (CONT'D)
dialog: Come. Sit here.
text: Saroo says nothing. Falls deeper into numbness.
text: Mrs Sood pulls him onto her lap. Shows him a little FLIP BOOK
dialog: of photos, sent by the prospective parents.
speaker_heading: MRS SOOD (CONT'D)
dialog: Would you like to see them?
dialog: (flipping through)
dialog: Look. That’s “John”. That’s “Sue”.
dialog: This is the house. [etc.]
text: Saroo studies them, intensely. ON THE PHOTOS: John and Sue,

dialog: They live on a little island called
dialog: Tasmania. Full of very nice people.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: They look nice, don’t they?
text: Saroo shakes his head meekly, No.
text: Mrs Sood strokes his hair gently, once. Gets serious.
speaker_heading: MRS SOOD (CONT'D)
dialog: Saroo. You cannot stay here.
text: A tear rolls down Saroo’s face.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: I want Ammi.
speaker_heading: MRS SOOD
dialog: I know you do. It’s hard.
text: She sets him down. Takes out the photo of John and Sue.
speaker_heading: MRS SOOD (CONT'D)
dialog: Will you take this? Look after it,
dialog: until the next time I see you?
text: Saroo nods bravely. Takes the photo in his tiny hand.
speaker_heading: MRS SOOD (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t lose it.
text: Saroo nods, slips it into his little back pocket. He walks to
text: the door, head down, dejected. He turns.
text: A huge question - you can see it in every fibre of his being.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Did you really look your hardest?
text: She nods solemnly.
dialog: 32
speaker_heading: MRS SOOD
text: Under every rock.
text: Saroo stands there. Hanging onto her gaze like a lifeboat.
speaker_heading: MRS SOOD (CONT'D)
dialog: You can hold them in your heart,
dialog: always. But now you have a new
dialog: home, if you want it.
text: Saroo looks away. A deep breath, almost a sigh.
scene_heading: EXT. LILUAH COURTYARD - DAY
text: Two KIDS play a joyless game - others pace the yard and lurk,
text: B/G - while Saroo sits against a decayed wall at the yard
text: edge. Amita beside him - holding that photo of Sue and John.
text: ON THE PHOTO: already, it’s battered and frayed and folded.
text: Amita studies it, with the fiercest interest. Saying nothing -
text: but knowing everything. Nodding. Knowing he’s going. Knowing
dialog: how lucky he is.
text: She looks up at the clouds through the wire mesh open roof.
text: Saroo looks up there too. A silent communion between the two.
text: Then - almost formally - Amita takes the tiny Ganesh
text: medallion from around her neck. Puts it around Saroo’s neck.
text: Not cheap and touristy, but ancient-looking, and worn -
text: almost like something dug up from an archeological dig.
speaker_heading: AMITA
dialog: Ganesh will look after you. He’s
dialog: the god of new beginnings.
text: Saroo takes her hand in his. They sit there, side by side.
scene_heading: INT. SIMPLE HOTEL SUITE, DINING TABLE - SOON AFTER (NIGHT)
text: We TRACK through a pleasant, simply furnished hotel suite to
text: find Saroo and two other orphans sitting, a little stiffly,
text: at a table set in western style: knife, fork, spoon in the
dialog: proper order, butter dish, salt and pepper shakers, etc.
text: As they eat, Mrs Sood is giving them a last-minute lesson.
speaker_heading: MRS SOOD
dialog: (in English)
dialog: “Fork”.
text: Saroo proudly holds up his fork, grinning.
speaker_heading: MRS SOOD (CONT'D)
dialog: Good. “Knife”?
text: The orphan boy holds up the knife.
dialog: 33
text: Mrs Sood points to the salt shaker.
speaker_heading: ORPHAN GIRL
dialog: (tentative)
dialog: “Salt...”
speaker_heading: MRS SOOD
dialog: (in English)
dialog: Salt. Good.
text: She points to the pepper. Orphan Girl racks her brains.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (jumping in)
dialog: “Peppa...”
dialog: It’s the funniest word they’ve ever heard. The three children
text: giggle, repeating the word.
scene_heading: INT. QANTAS JUMBO JET - DAY
text: CLOSE with Saroo as he steps into the enormous interior of a
text: Qantas jet. Awestruck. Everything so gleaming and new - just
text: like Saroo himself, wearing that hilarious “Tasmania and its
text: territories” tee-shirt from the Long Way Home book cover.
text: His minder settles him and sits beside him.
dialog: On Saroo: what a world. The seat. The seatbelt. The magazine
text: pocket. The window shade. The overhead light.
scene_heading: QANTAS ATTENDANT
dialog: Would he like a Kids’ Kit?
speaker_heading: MINDER
dialog: Thank you.
text: She hands the kit to the minder. Then an extra surprise:
scene_heading: QANTAS ATTENDANT
dialog: Would you like a Cadbury bar,
dialog: little man?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (taking it from her)
dialog: Cadbury.
text: He looks at the minder, who nods Yes, you can open it.
text: Saroo opens the purple wrapper. Blown away by what chocolate
text: looks like up close. He bites into it.
scene_heading: INT. QANTAS JUMBO JET - SOON AFTER (DAY)
text: TAKE-OFF. We study this tiny 5-year-old, glued to the window
text: as the plane lifts off.
dialog: 34
scene_heading: INT. QANTAS JUMBO JET - SOON AFTER (DAY)
text: POV from window: all of Calcutta. So tiny down there.
scene_heading: INT. QANTAS JUMBO JET - LATER (DAY)
text: The astonishing view from 30,000 feet. Saroo’s been glued to
text: that window for hours. The earth is vast.
text: Saroo pulls down the window blind. Pulls it up again.
text: Saroo turns, looks at his sleeping minder. Looks back at the
text: window. Blind down, blind up. Looks back out the window.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR, HOBART AIRPORT - DAY
text: We're CLOSE behind Saroo’s shoulder as the minder guides him
text: along a corridor, flanked by an AIRPORT OFFICIAL.
text: We round the corner of the corridor and enter -
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, HOBART AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS (DAY)
text: - where JOHN (32) and SUE (29) BRIERLEY stand up anxiously -
text: Everyone just stands there for a moment - so tentative -
speaker_heading: MINDER
dialog: Hello. I’m Swarmina.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (softly)
dialog: I’m John. This is Sue.
text: Saroo has retreated behind Swarmina’s leg - he holds on for
text: dear life and peers out shyly. Wide-eyed. First boy on Mars.
text: Sue kneels gently. A lifetime of waiting brims in her eyes.
text: She looks down on Saroo with as much astonishment as he her.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Hi there.
text: Saroo still clutches the half-eaten Cadbury bar from earlier.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (deadpan)
dialog: Cadbury.
text: It doesn’t get more awkward. Or beautiful.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: It’s a Cadbury, John.
dialog: 35
scene_heading: I/E. CAR / THE BRIERLEY’S STREET - DAY
text: We're in the car with our new nuclear family, in the back
text: seat with Saroo (POV). He looks at the passing rows of brown
text: suburban homes - neat lawns - sprinklers. So unlike India.
text: Sue watches Saroo in the central mirror: his curiosity and
dialog: his amazement.
scene_heading: INT. BRIERLEY HOME - MINUTES LATER (DAY)
text: We’re behind Saroo as he enters the house, awed, alert,
text: curious. Sue and John gently prod -
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That’s okay - have a look around -
text: Saroo is goggle-eyed. Sue gives running commentary wherever
text: he goes. Whatever he looks at.
dialog: This is the Living room. That's the
dialog: television. [etc...]
text: The clean white benches. The shiny refrigerator.
text: Saroo steps up to the fridge. He looks back to Sue: May I?
text: He opens the door. The colourful glory of western groceries.
text: Stands there, mouth open, simply stunned. Shuts it gently.
scene_heading: INT. SAROO’S BEDROOM, BRIERLEY HOME - MINUTES LATER (DAY)
text: Saroo’s bedroom. A box of toys. Saroo looks up at Sue and
text: John, not quite believing his eyes: Can I touch these?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: They’re yours.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You can play with them.
text: But Saroo just stands there, lost in a moment of fully taking
text: in his parents. John Brierley. Sue Brierley. White Martians.
text: Saroo blinks twice.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: (kneeling)
dialog: Here you go.
dialog: (pushing a truck)
dialog: You have a go, son.
text: Saroo picks it up. Simply studies its wheels. Spins one.
text: He’s too overwhelmed, too shy, to play immediately. Looks up
text: at his parents again.
dialog: 36
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: See how the doors open. Look. Like
dialog: this.
text: John demonstrates the truck doors. Saroo likes that. He opens
text: and closes the tiny doors.
text: He puts the truck on the ground - pushes it along. Gets lost
dialog: in the activity.
text: Then he looks up. As he takes in the room once more,
text: something on the wall catches his attention:
text: - a detailed MAP OF INDIA. Saroo recognizes the triangle, all
dialog: that dense information, though he can no more understand
dialog: written English than he could the Bengali on that map in the
dialog: police station back in Calcutta -
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: That's right. That’s where you came
dialog: from. Look. This is India. This is
dialog: Calcutta, here.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (one word he recognizes)
dialog: Cal-cutta.
text: He stares politely at the incomprehensible map.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM, BRIERLEY HOME - NIGHT
text: Dinner time: Saroo nervous, polite, calm, as they eat. Head
text: barely above the table. Taking in the place settings.
text: As Saroo chews, he looks up at his new parents. Grins.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: Peppa.
text: Sue and John share a proud smile.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: That's right. That’s the pepper.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM, BRIERLEY HOME - NIGHT
text: Sue ladles water over Saroo. He’s fascinated with everything:
dialog: the water, the warmth, this gentle woman, these bath toys.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Close your eyes.
dialog: She motions to him: close your eyes.
text: For an instant, he looks at her warily. Remembering Noor.
dialog: 37
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: Go on. It’s okay.
text: He looks into her eyes. He has to trust. He can trust.
text: He closes his eyes.
text: Sue pours a saucepan of water SLOWLY over his head. The STEAM
text: comes off him. It’s like some exotic baptism. You can see his
text: whole body - his whole being - relax.
text: He opens his eyes.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: (eager, encouraging)
dialog: Good?
text: Saroo smiles.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: You’ve come so far. Haven’t you? My
dialog: little one.
text: He stares up at her with those huge dark eyes.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT’D)
dialog: I don’t imagine it’s been easy. One
dialog: day, you make sure to tell me all
dialog: about it. Tell me everything. Who
dialog: you are. I'll always listen.
text: He squeezes the alligator. It SQUEAKS. He pulls back, amused.
text: Sue notices John at the door - he has been quietly standing
text: there the whole time - and a beautiful warmth spreads between
dialog: the three. So this is what it feels like - to be a family.
scene_heading: HIGH AERIAL - WINEGLASS BAY - DAY
text: Down there, a small YACHT races towards a sheltered bay.
text: Over this, a SUPER: ONE YEAR LATER.
scene_heading: EXT. THE SUZIE / WINEGLASS BAY - DAY
text: The modest boat - lovingly maintained - skips across the
text: water. Her name - SUZIE - painted on the side. John teaches
dialog: Saroo how to sail.
text: Saroo is deeply absorbed - his little face earnest. Sue - the
text: wind in her hair - watches them with unconcealed delight.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH, WINEGLASS BAY - DAY
text: CUT IN HARD on little Saroo diving into frame, making an
text: overdramatic lunge, catching a ball on the soft sand.
dialog: 38
speaker_heading: JOHN (0.S.)
dialog: Howzat!
text: The Brierleys play cricket on a curve of white sand, at the
text: extraordinarily beautiful Wineglass Bay. The small family
text: boat is moored nearby, in the azure water.
text: With a child’s wooden cricket bat, Sue hits the ball high in
text: the air in a graceful arc that forces Saroo to really sprint.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: (excited commentator)
dialog: It’s going for six! No, young
dialog: Saroo’s under it! -
text: Saroo leaps for the ball again - dives into the water’s edge
text: as he catches it -
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Howzat!
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Bravo!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (commentator)
dialog: Ohhhh! Saroo Brierley has done the
dialog: impossible! Australia wins on the
dialog: final ball of the day! Let’s look
dialog: at the slow motion replay!
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Mum! Mum, look at me!
text: Saroo’s victory dance. His English comes naturally now.
text: Laughing, Sue gets her camera - Saroo poses - a miniature
dialog: hero - for a victory pic.
scene_heading: INT. HOBART AIRPORT - DAY
text: CLOSE on a child’s drawing - a house, a tree, the sun, two
text: adults, a brown child - and another brown face, looking out
text: from an airplane window high above.
text: WIDER: Saroo holding up the drawing like a banner - a kind of
text: “Welcome” offering. Pointing at the figures -—
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Mum. Dad. Me. Mantosh.
text: Sue and John, expectant. But not as nervous as last year.
text: MANTOSH (8) enters with the same minder from last year.
speaker_heading: MINDER
dialog: Hello again! Saroo - my goodness!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: This is Mantosh.
dialog: 39
text: Mantosh looks wild and feral - something not quite right.
text: Saroo sees it instantly: sees it before John and Sue.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Mantosh - I’m John. This is Sue.
dialog: And this is your brother Saroo. Say
dialog: hello, Saroo.
text: Saroo says nothing; gently hands the drawing to Mantosh.
text: Mantosh doesn’t even take it, doesn’t even look at it.
text: Saroo, perplexed, glances at Sue.
text: The minder smiles at Sue. But you can see she’s had a tough
dialog: 24 hours, and knows there’s something’s wrong with this kid.
text: AUDIO (B/G, faint): John and Sue make small-talk with the
dialog: minder, along the lines of “You have a nice flight?” etc.
dialog: But down here at kid level, all of Saroo’s focus is on this
text: wired boy whose eyes dart crazily, whose hands are scarred
text: and scabbed. Saroo is basically thinking, “What the hell have
dialog: we got here?”
dialog: [In Mantosh, we get the visual and behavioral echoes with
dialog: Haunted Boy in Liluah too. ]
scene_heading: INT. SAROO’S BEDROOM, BRIERLEY HOME - DAY
text: Saroo stands frozen and freaked out in his own bedroom, eyes
text: wide open - listening to a great commotion along the hall.
text: Saroo leans to his open door - peeks out -
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY LEADING TO LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (DAY)
text: REVERSE of that: a sliver of the chaos in the living room -
text: - (Saroo’s POV) Sue in silhouette, frozen - as beyond her,
text: Mantosh screams like a banshee for no apparent reason. A
text: child's cricket bat flies across the room, clattering against
text: the china cabinet - as John lunges to protect it -
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Woh woh woh woh! Hang on, sunshine -
text: Mantosh ransacking his own new toys - Tasmanian devil style.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
text: Careful with the furniture, mate.
text: Mantosh starts to hit himself, screaming. Losing breath.
text: Sue and John try to calm him.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: C’mon. Breathe. Deep breaths.
dialog: 40
text: BACK ON SAROO: in his sliver of doorway, watching the scene
text: up the hallway, he simply CLOSES HIS EYES.
text: CUT TO BLACK.
scene_heading: INT. DARK HALLWAY, INTO KITCHEN, BRIERLEY HOME - NIGHT
text: We TRACK OUT OF THE BLACKNESS along the hall, into the dark
text: living room - and the OPEN KITCHEN over there.
text: A night light in the kitchen illuminates Sue, standing at the
text: sink. Still. Her arms hanging limp. Exhausted. Mute.
text: Saroo stands behind her, watching. (She hasn’t heard him.)
text: He steps beside her. Reaches up, takes her hand.
text: She snaps out of it, looks down on him. It’s all right, says
text: the look on his face.
text: A private communion. The son comforting the mother. Then, as
text: if remembering her duty to look after him, Sue pulls Saroo
text: close, cradles his head. They stand there, a silent tableau.
text: MUSIC (PRE-LAP into next scene) rises over end of this, into
scene_heading: EXT. WINEGLASS BAY - DAY (2010)
text: Deep blue water, infused with glints of sunlight.
text: Saroo (now 26) breaks the surface.
text: Contented. Relaxed. Completely at home in the water, he
text: floats onto his back, at one with the sea and the sun.
dialog: This is paradise...
speaker_heading: Super: 25 YEARS LATER
text: He swims smoothly to the shore. Hauls his sailboard upright.
scene_heading: AERIAL - HOBART STREETS - LATE AFTERNOON/DUSK
text: We track high above a car as it glides down the freeway -
scene_heading: INT. HOBART WATERSIDE RESTAURANT - DAY
text: Saroo, John and Sue sit in a busy restaurant - glass walls,
text: wine glasses tinkling, sunlight bouncing off the harbour.
text: There’s a fourth place-setting, untouched. Clearly this is a
text: huge moment - their son is leaving. John pours the champagne.
text: Saroo, observing the ritual. Sue, her eyes sparkling, to
dialog: Saroo, re: the champagne - isn’t this exciting?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: It’s only Melbourne...
dialog: 4l
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (jokes)
text: It’s across the water.
text: They hold their glasses up. Respect and care in this family.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Saroo. Beautiful boy. May this
dialog: bring you all you can wish for.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: And then some.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Thanks Mum. Thanks Dad.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: You came into our lives.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: - Mum! -
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I’m not finished. You were more
dialog: than we ever hoped for.
dialog: On Saroo: Okay, Mum’s getting serious. Head down —
text: embarrassed, but touched.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: More work, that’s for sure.
text: They laugh.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT’D)
dialog: From the moment we first saw you -
text: She takes John’s hand.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Those great big eyes -
text: Sue and John smile at each other.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: And now look at you - just look at
dialog: you...
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You’re a good lad, Saroo.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: We're proud of you, and excited for
dialog: you, for this new chapter.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (toasts)
dialog: To success.
dialog: 42
text: At this moment the WAITER comes up.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: (on the unused setting)
dialog: Are you still waiting on someone?
dialog: Or can I take this away?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: You can take it away.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: You can leave it, thanks.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: No, take it.
text: The waiter, uncertain.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (tight)
dialog: I'd like to keep it, thanks.
dialog: Beat. Well, that decides it.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: You don’t really think he’1l turn
dialog: up, do you?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Just let it be, son.
text: Sue puts on her brave smile. Takes another sip of champagne.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (to John)
dialog: This is a nice one, love.
text: John puts his hand on her hand.
text: Saroo looks lovingly at Sue. She’s brave and beautiful.
scene_heading: I/E. MAZDA / RUN-DOWN HOUSE - AFTERNOON
text: Saroo pulls up at a run-down shack that sits alone in a huge
text: eucalyptus forest by the sea - an isolationist’s dream.
scene_heading: EXT. (THROUGH TO INT.) RUN-DOWN HOUSE - SECONDS LATER
text: We follow Saroo as he steps through the open front door into
text: Mantosh’s forlorn home.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Mantosh?
text: As Saroo walks straight through to the back door - it’s not a
text: big house - we take in the bare-bones, rundown interior -
dialog: 43
text: - Saroo notes, in passing, all the messy drug paraphernalia
text: on the “coffee table” (an old door on two milk crates) -
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD, RUN-DOWN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS (AFTERNOON)
text: - through to the back - and there, in a patch of sunlight in
text: the unkempt, scrappy yard, sits ADULT MANTOSH on a log.
text: Smoking a hand-rolled cigarette, drinking instant coffee.
text: Saroo comes over. Wariness between the two. Mantosh: wiry,
text: edgy, nervy. Static electricity comes off this guy.
speaker_heading: MANTOSH
dialog: Yeah, sorry I didn’t make lunch.
text: Beat. Saroo, edgy.
speaker_heading: MANTOSH (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s the course again?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Hotel management.
speaker_heading: MANTOSH
dialog: So you’re gonna learn to, what -
dialog: manage a hotel?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Well, have fun.
text: Saroo doesn’t answer.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Any bills you need to pay?
speaker_heading: MANTOSH
dialog: Some cash’d be good.
dialog: This is not even taken seriously.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: You're on your own now.
speaker_heading: MANTOSH
dialog: I’m good at that.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Hey, you can give me a job when you
dialog: come back.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Cut the shit. Just - please, could
dialog: you not do anything while I’m gone -
speaker_heading: MANTOSH
dialog: - yeah, yeah -
dialog: 44
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: - that’s going to make mum even
text: more unhappy.
speaker_heading: MANTOSH
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: Mate. Why do you think I stay away?
scene_heading: AERIAL - HOBART AIRPORT - AFTERNOON
text: MUSIC. CLEAN POV of a TARMAC, falling away as we lift off.
scene_heading: HIGHER AERIAL - TASMANIA - AFTERNOON
text: High above this luscious island. The green wilderness of
text: Tasmania. The ocean, coming into view.
scene_heading: INT. QANTAS DOMESTIC FLIGHT - AFTERNOON
text: CLOSE on Saroo: at his window, looking down over that ocean.
text: Reflective. The nomad, off again. He pulls the window blind
dialog: down. Then up. Down. Up. Didn’t he do that once long ago?
speaker_heading: FADE TO BLACK
scene_heading: SUPER: MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA
scene_heading: INT. RMSHM AUDITORIUM - DAY
text: Well-lit stage. An impressive, modern feel. Mid-address, the

speaker_heading: PROVOST
dialog: You've been selected from around
text: the world. A world that’s opening
dialog: up faster than we could ever have
dialog: imagined.
text: ON Saroo: he scans the room. Students of all races. He spots
text: a CLUSTER OF INDIAN STUDENTS.
speaker_heading: PROVOST (0.S.) (CONT’D)
dialog: We see ourselves as the United
dialog: Nations of hospitality schools, and
dialog: we like to think we teach a
dialog: balanced and global perspective. -
dialog: Saroo studies the Indian students. We feel ever so slightly
text: his intrigue - as memories awaken from the deep.
speaker_heading: PROVOST (0.8) (CONT’D)
dialog: You’re here because you have a
dialog: dream. We're here to help you make
dialog: that dream a reality.
dialog: 45
scene_heading: INT. RMSHM AUDITORIUM, AISLE - LATER
text: Induction over. The aisle between the seats is crowded.
text: Saroo shuffles along shoulder to shoulder with other students
dialog: of many races.
text: He hears fragments of Hindi - it strikes him how many Indian
dialog: students there are.
text: He nods neutral hellos to them. Saroo eavesdrops as an INDIAN
text: STUDENT on her cell phone excitedly calls her Ammi.
text: Saroo is stuck at the end of a row. Opposite him - also stuck
text: - is a beautiful young woman - LUCY (late 20's). She meets
text: his eye. They step forward together. A mirror-moment.
scene_heading: INT. RMSHM CLASSROOM - DAY
text: Open MID on Lucy - we’re in a round-robin discussion in a
text: tutorial of about fifteen STUDENTS, assorted ages and
text: backgrounds. A non-Anglo TUTOR.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: - so I saw first-hand how the
dialog: hospitality industry brings
dialog: infrastructure to communities that
dialog: really need it. But I also saw the
dialog: problems that causes. Which is why
dialog: community groups really need to be
text: involved, every step of the way.
dialog: And taken seriously. And I thought -
dialog: I could help give them a voice.
text: Saroo, watching, listening, entranced by this beautiful,
dialog: idealistic woman.
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT'D)
dialog: Not try to prevent progress, but
dialog: convince developers there are
dialog: benefits to being sustainable and
dialog: community oriented.
speaker_heading: TUTOR
dialog: (amused, encouraging)
dialog: Why not think big?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Absolutely. In return, the labour
dialog: force would be more consistent and
text: better trained and more motivated.
dialog: Win-win.
speaker_heading: TUTOR
dialog: So you want to be ...
dialog: The tutor considers.
dialog: 46
speaker_heading: TUTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: - a community liaison consultant?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: That sounds good!
text: Done. She looks to Saroo: his turn next.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: I want to run hotels that put all
dialog: the profits into my pocket.
text: Some laughter. Some frowns. Saroo was only joking.
text: Lucy grins at him. A tickle of chemistry.
speaker_heading: TUTOR
dialog: Let’s start with where you’re from.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Tassie.
speaker_heading: PRAMA
dialog: “Tazzy"?
speaker_heading: SAROO
text: Tasmania. Across the water.
speaker_heading: TUTOR
dialog: So born in Australia.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (resistant)
dialog: Umm ... Kolkata.
speaker_heading: PRAMA
dialog: I have cousins that live there.
dialog: They're quite mad.
speaker_heading: BHARAT
dialog: Which part?
text: Saroo’s sudden discomfort. It’s been a long time, and even
text: talking about it is stirring up memories.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: I'm adopted. I’m not really Indian.
text: He inadvertently comes across as a little rude - as if he
dialog: wouldn’t want to be Indian. Bharat and Prama feel it. Lucy
text: dispels the growing tension.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: You love cricket though, right?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Of course.
dialog: 47
speaker_heading: BHARAT
dialog: You don’t support the Aussies, do
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Only the Aussies, mate.
text: Bharat and Prama look alarmed.
speaker_heading: BHARAT
dialog: This is going to be interesting!
text: They all smile.
speaker_heading: TUTOR
dialog: (getting it back on track)
dialog: And why are you doing this course,
dialog: Saroo? What do you hope to get out
dialog: of it?
text: Saroo refocuses, ponders the question. He smiles at the tutor
text: - trying to find the elusive answer.
scene_heading: EXT. FLINDER’S STREET, MELBOURNE - DAY
text: Saroo walking in the afternoon light. A metropolis strangely
text: like Howrah. The hum and energy, the traffic, distant train
dialog: sounds.
scene_heading: INT. SAROO’S STUDENT APARTMENT - DAY
text: Silence. A sudden sense of isolation. Saroo goes to the
dialog: window.
text: Ten stories down, the busy city with its enticing energy.
scene_heading: EXT. INDIAN SHARED FLAT - DUSK
text: Beers in hand, Saroo climbs the exterior stairs of a 70’s
text: block, where a long balcony leads along the third floor.
text: As he reaches the landing, he sees Lucy at the far end -
text: coming up the opposite identical stairs. Like mirrors again.
text: Struck by the serendipity again - and Saroo struck by Lucy’s
text: beauty - they burst into smiles.
text: As they arrive at the door, Bollywood music can be heard.
text: They can’t resist the “mirror” temptation - they knock on the
text: door in unison, cracking up.
scene_heading: INT. INDIAN SHARED FLAT, LIVING ROOM - DUSK
text: Prama opens the front door to Saroo and Lucy -
speaker_heading: PRAMA
dialog: Hi! Come in, come in —
dialog: 48
text: Inside, Bharat greets them and introduces some fellow
dialog: students. Make sure we hear Lucy’s name here, as she hasn’t
text: been introduced anywhere else. SAMI (24) and ANNIKA (30). A
text: Bollywood movie plays B/G. A GREAT SPREAD of Indian food
text: already on the table.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Wow, something smells amazing!
speaker_heading: BHARAT
dialog: Ah - Saroo - Lucy - this is Sami -
dialog: and Annika.
text: Everyone shakes hands, says “Hi”.
speaker_heading: PRAMA
dialog: (challenges Saroo)
dialog: You do eat Indian food...?
speaker_heading: LATER
text: The food served Indian-style. Saroo watches Lucy - and the
text: others - eat with their hands. He looks lost.
text: Lucy’s no expert, but she’s giving it a go. She raises her
text: eyebrows at Saroo, amused at his inaction.
text: Bharat slides a fork across the table to Saroo.
speaker_heading: BHARAT
dialog: (to Lucy)
dialog: So why was it called Taxi to
dialog: Tomorrow?
speaker_heading: PRAMA
dialog: (to Saroo)
dialog: It’s easy, come on try it.
dialog: (eating with her hands)
text: On Saroo: he puts down his cutlery.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Okay, I say flashlight -
dialog: (to Annika)
dialog: - you say -—
speaker_heading: ANNIKA
dialog: Lampe de poche.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: (to Saroo)
dialog: You say —-
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Torch.
dialog: 49
speaker_heading: PRAMA
dialog: (to Saroo)
dialog: Do you speak Hindi?
speaker_heading: BHARAT
dialog: Why would he, he’s from Tazzie.
dialog: Flashlight is ...
text: Bharat says flashlight, in Hindi. On Saroo: a flash of
text: recognition, that feeling he hasn’t felt in so many years.
text: Tries eating with his hands. A mirror of the “Peppa” scene.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: And what's “taxi”?
speaker_heading: BHARAT
dialog: Taxi.
speaker_heading: ANNIKA
dialog: Taxi.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: See? It’s the same in every
dialog: language.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (jokes)
dialog: Unless you take a cab.
text: Lucy gives him a “thanks very much” look.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: (to Lucy)
dialog: I still think you’re crazy. I'd be
dialog: terrified to live anywhere in
dialog: Africa.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: (to Saroo)
dialog: Have you travelled much?
text: Saroo shakes his head.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Who wants another beer?
text: Saroo escapes into a role he’s familiar with.
scene_heading: INT. INDIAN SHARED FLAT, HALLWAY & KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: We follow Saroo along the hallway, past the homely
dialog: decorations the Indians have put up in a short space of time -—
text: - and through to the kitchen. As Saroo moves to the fridge he
text: sees a tray of jalebis - those deep golden-orange spirals
text: from the far recesses of his memory.
dialog: 50
text: He stares at them. His mind spinning. Retrieving the
dialog: memories.
text: He’s not just struck. He’s thunderstruck.
speaker_heading: SLAM CUT:
scene_heading: MEMORY, KHANDWA MARKET
dialog: Back on that day more than 20 years earlier when Saroo and
text: Guddu swapped the stolen coal for warm milk.
text: The jalebis sizzling in the vat - an unattainable feast.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (nudges Guddu)
dialog: Guddu ... Jalebis ...
text: Guddu looks at them too; for a beat we see beyond the boys’
text: deep hunger - they’re just kids, yearning for a sweet.
text: Then Guddu makes light of it - with bravado:
speaker_heading: GUDDU
dialog: One day, I’m going to buy you one!
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (playful, cheeky)
dialog: One day, let’s buy the whole vat!
text: Guddu laughs at this ... but both boys steal another glance,
text: salivating at this sizzling utopia.
scene_heading: INT. INDIAN SHARED FLAT, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: Staring intensely at the orange spiral sweets, Saroo slowly
text: reaches his hand forward - reaches back in time - towards
dialog: this unattainable thing he never got to taste.
text: He picks one up, studies it. As if it’s some mystical
text: communion wafer.
text: He puts it to his mouth. Bites into it. The significance of
text: the moment hits him hard - he is eating for Guddu too.
text: Just then Lucy enters. Something not right here...
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (barely a whisper)
dialog: «+. jJalebis ...
text: Lucy looks concerned.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Saroo?
dialog: We are TIGHT on the two.
dialog: 51
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (like a confession)
dialog: I’m not from Kolkata.
text: She moves closer. Gentle. Careful.
speaker_heading: SAROO (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m lost.
text: They notice Bharat has entered.
scene_heading: INT. INDIAN SHARED FLAT, LIVING ROOM - LATER SAME NIGHT
text: The mood is completely different. Respectful and intrigued.
speaker_heading: PRAMA
dialog: You must have been freaking. Howrah
dialog: Station’s enormous! I went through
dialog: on pilgrimage to Puri - I missed my
dialog: connection twice.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: And you couldn’t speak Bengali?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: I didn’t even know it was called
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: BHARAT
dialog: How long were you on the train?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: A couple of days.
text: Some squabbling and cross-referencing in Hindi - and through
text: it, as they throw in their two cents worth, some MOMENTS in
text: Saroo’s eyes. The long-forgotten music of the language.
speaker_heading: BHARAT
dialog: What was your home town again?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: “Ganestlay”. But I must have had it
dialog: wrong, it doesn’t exist.
speaker_heading: BHARAT
dialog: You must remember something about
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: The platform I fell asleep on had a
text: big rain tank.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: There are thousands of stations...
text: Saroo has never spoken about this before. He’s starting to
text: tense up. Lucy is aware of his discomfort.
dialog: 52
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Yeah. Look, that’s all in the past.
speaker_heading: BHARAT
dialog: No, no. We find out how fast
dialog: passenger trains went back then. We
dialog: take the speed and multiply it by
dialog: the hours you were on the train,
dialog: and create a search radius.
speaker_heading: PRAMA
dialog: Totally. And have you heard of this
dialog: new program, Google Earth? It’s
dialog: incredible - you can see anywhere
dialog: in the world.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: It would take three lifetimes to
dialog: search all the stations in India.
speaker_heading: BHARAT
dialog: Not all the stations -
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Okay, half the stations.
text: Saroo, squirming with all this focus on his past.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Really guys, it was a long time
dialog: ago.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Do you think your parents tried to
dialog: find you?
speaker_heading: PRAMA
dialog: Of course they did!
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: No, I just mean, if his family
dialog: looked for him, maybe they left,
dialog: like, a paper trail.
speaker_heading: BHARAT
text: He doesn’t even know his surname.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: And my mum couldn’t read or write.
text: A small silence. Lucy moves closer to Saroo. They share a
dialog: smile.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: What did she do?
dialog: 53
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (more to Lucy)
dialog: She was like - a labourer.
dialog: It doesn’t exactly compute - for these modernized Indian kids
dialog: with money to study abroad.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Your mum?
text: Sami’s naivety has crossed a line. Saroo fights back.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (blunt; as if Sami is the
dialog: thick one)
dialog: Yeah. She carried rocks.
text: Bharat glares at Sami - shut up.
speaker_heading: BHARAT
dialog: That’s cool.
speaker_heading: PRAMA
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: Yeah. Cool.
scene_heading: EXT. MELBOURNE STREET - LATER, SAME NIGHT
text: Saroo and Lucy walk in the streets. Silence.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: My mom died four years ago. Cancer.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: I’m sorry.
text: She glances at him. He’s sincere, not just being polite. She
dialog: opens up further -
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: My dad still blames her. Not for
dialog: getting sick, obviously. For
dialog: refusing chemo.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: She knew herself. She knew her
dialog: terms. How she wanted to live.
dialog: (beat - morbid humour: )
dialog: Dad's attitude was, there’s only so
dialog: much a juice cleanse can do.
text: Saroo smiles at it.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: And what was your attitude?
dialog: 54
text: A pause, as Lucy considers the question, and comes up finally
dialog: with the only possible answer - here in the present:
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I miss her.
dialog: You can see in her eyes how deeply this is true. Then she
text: glances up at him, changes direction, deflects it:
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT'D)
dialog: You miss yours?
text: But Saroo himself has about eleven force-fields around him.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: I guess.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: What about your dad?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: He walked out on us. Took another
dialog: wife.
text: Lucy shakes her head - crazy world.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Any brothers or sisters?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Two brothers and a sister. It was a
dialog: long time ago. All a bit vague.
text: He casually shrugs it away, as if the length of time is
dialog: sufficient explanation for the vagueness. And then:
speaker_heading: SAROO (CONT’D)
dialog: But there’s Mantosh. In Tassie.
dialog: He’s adopted too.
dialog: They walk.
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT'D)
dialog: So what do you think of Bharat’s
dialog: search radius idea?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: (ironic enthusiasm)
dialog: I think it sounds promising.
text: Saroo nods, but it’s noncommittal, a little distant.
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT'D)
dialog: You all right?
dialog: 55
text: Saroo looks vulnerable; then suddenly he grins, and head-
text: bobbles to her - Indian Style.
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my god. You are so wrong!
text: And suddenly, shaking himself out of the past - playing to
text: Lucy - flirting with her - Saroo pulls a few dance moves,
text: mock-Bollywood style.
text: Lucy laughs, embarrassed but impressed. And even though it’s
text: momentarily playful, they both know that something deep has
dialog: connected them.
scene_heading: INT. SAROO’S STUDENT APARTMENT - LATER, SAME NIGHT
text: Saroo, alone in the dark - despite the spark with Lucy, still
text: rattled by whatever it is the jalebis have opened up in him.
scene_heading: EXT. INDIAN DREAM QUARRY (FLASHBACK)
text: We're in that mythic, prehistoric, dust-shrouded landscape.
text: WORKERS all around load rocks into old wooden hods.
text: Saroo is running across the rubble, white with dust himself.
text: Everything heightened and surreal.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Ammi! Ammi! [Mummy! Mummy! ]
text: Kamla comes into focus, as she stands, and turns.
dialog: But before we get to her, we -
scene_heading: HARD CUT BACK INTO:
scene_heading: INT. SAROO’S STUDENT APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)
text: We can just make out Saroo’s face, as he sits in the dark.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Ammi ... Ammi ...
text: The pain of memory. A sudden intense expulsion of breath.
scene_heading: INT. LIVE MUSIC GIG - NIGHT
text: A wall of music. The BAND, sweating, pulsing, lost in the
text: frenzy of instruments. A CROWD of dancing people.
text: Saroo and Lucy, sweaty, tranced, deep ... their eyes locked -
text: a different kind of connection - visceral - almost alarming.
text: They ride the music.
text: Now a change of mood - the music shifts - haunting.
dialog: 56
text: Saroo and Lucy hold each other up, enjoying the public
dialog: intimacy.
text: Their eyes meet - they hesitate -
dialog: - this is real, the connection between them -
dialog: - to surrender or not, that’s the question -
dialog: - they go for it.
text: Hand to hand, forehead to forehead -—
text: - again, a mirror - physically connected this time.
dialog: A transformative moment -
dialog: - their senses, so alive -
text: - so close, blurring into one.
scene_heading: INT. SAROO’S STUDENT APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: E/C/U: Saroo runs his finger slowly along the lines on Lucy’s
text: marble white arm and palm.
dialog: WIDER: We’re in a tender post-coital darkness.
text: Lucy drifting into sleep.
scene_heading: MEMORY, FOREST, KHANDWA
text: Sounds of the forest. Laughing children. CLOSE on 5-year-old
text: Saroo, facing a tree, his hands covering his face, but
text: grinning through his fingers.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Here I come! ...
text: He turns. Beaming. Pretending to look here and there.
speaker_heading: SAROO (CONT’D)
dialog: Where is she? Where could she be?
text: HIDING, Shekila tries not to squeal with anticipation.
text: Suddenly Saroo SWOOPS DOWN and discovers her -
speaker_heading: SAROO (CONT’D)
dialog: (like a lion)
dialog: Roaargh!!
text: - and Shekila shrieks her delighted lungs out too. Such a
text: beautiful release of energy.
text: Then another ROAR from behind, and it’s Kamla, playfully
text: catching the two of them off-guard.
dialog: 57
text: They all tumble and wrestle, squealing, laughing. Sound of
text: the leaves crunching, the wind in the trees...
text: Shekila notices on her arm - a ladybird.
text: The tiny delicate insect. Sound of a bird call, clear, in the
text: forest canopy.
text: She and Saroo watch the ladybird, entranced...
scene_heading: INT. SAROO’S STUDENT APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: The sounds of play and forest trail into Saroo, now sitting
text: up on the edge of the bed. Staring into the darkness. His
text: head racing, his heart pounding. He breathes.
text: JUMP CUT: Saroo is standing now. In the dark. Just standing
text: there. He stares over at his laptop. Something’s calling him.
text: He sits at his desk. A haunted look. Hits ENTER. The screen-
text: saver opens to his default page, Google. ON SCREEN:
text: - he types “Indian train station water tanks” as a search.
text: A hodgepodge of results, as you’d expect. Assorted images of
dialog: water towers.
text: He clicks on a couple. It’s not that none look like the one
text: in his memory. It’s that they all look fairly similar.
text: In the search bar he types “Dams India”.
text: Again, a mixed bag of random results. IMAGES of giant hydro-
text: electric works. He clicks on an aerial shot of one.
text: In the bottom corner of the image, he notices:
dialog: - a logo. “Copyright Google Earth”.
text: Curious, he clicks on it.
text: Google Earth opens. The address bar: www.google.com/earth.
text: ON SCREEN: that now-so-familiar Google glow - our Earth -
text: beautiful blue sphere suspended in pure black space.
text: To either side of it, the menus and controls.
text: Saroo stares at it all. How does this work?
text: Using his track pad, he clicks the arrows. The globe “spins”.
text: Slowly at first. Working out how it works. Then around the
text: curve of the planet comes India - that familiar triangle that
dialog: was on his wall all of his childhood.
text: He stares at it. As if it might give him some information.
dialog: 58
dialog: [Note: during all such scenes we're INTERCUTTING BACK AND
text: FORTH between Saroo and screen. ]
text: He hits the “plus” symbol and starts to zoom inwards again.
text: At a certain point he spots Calcutta (or “Kolkata”, by 2010).
text: Down, down. Closer. The Earth coming closer.
scene_heading: SAROO’S “MEMORY MAP”: 1 - WATER TOWER (NIGHT)
text: The looming WATER TOWER, that night on Burhanpur platform.
dialog: [NOTE: these memory maps are Saroo’s vivid, clear memories -
text: the landmarks that will act as his geographical “locators”. ]
scene_heading: SAROO’S “MEMORY MAP”: 2 - DAM (DAY)
text: WIDE: the DAM, the long dam wall. Two little silhouettes
text: (Guddu, Saroo, distant, frolicking) emerging from the water.
scene_heading: SAROO’S “MEMORY MAP”: 3 - UNDERPASS (DAY)
text: WIDE: Little Saroo runs into the distinctive UNDERPASS near
dialog: Khandwa Station.
scene_heading: SAROO’S “MEMORY MAP”: 4 - ALLEYWAY TO HOME (DAY)
text: We FOLLOW over little Saroo’s shoulder, sprinting down the
text: narrow alley to home, past the house with the lurid aqua
text: wall, past the overflowing bougainvillea.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Ammi! Ammi!
scene_heading: INT. SAROO’S STUDENT APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: On the screen - Saroo sees the great river - the Hooghly, we
dialog: can see it’s called - that slices Calcutta in half, much like
dialog: Paris or London.
text: The river, closer. We can make out crowded city blocks now.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: The bridge ...
text: There it is. The Hooghly Bridge. And there: Howrah Station.
speaker_heading: SAROO (CONT'D)
dialog: No way.
text: His emotions up in his throat.
text: ON SCREEN: the floating label says “Howrah Station”. There it
text: is. All the platforms. All the tracks leading out.
text: Saroo, in awe, devouring all this visual information.
dialog: 59
text: Now, inches from the screen.
text: TINY JUMP CUTS: Saroo squinting at the specks on the
text: platforms: each speck a person, but LO-RES, GRAINY, COARSE.
text: Something hypnotic about it - the graininess, the little
text: circle spinning as the pixels clarify and sharpen.
text: Saroo hunched over, rapidly mastering these controls.
dialog: Learning how to scroll and “track”.
text: He scrolls along the tracks leading out from Howrah Station.
text: But now - remembering - he imagines what it must have been
dialog: like for his brother - to find him missing -
scene_heading: IMAGINED MEMORY, PLATFORM, BURHANPUR STATION
text: The out-of-focus stretch of the empty Burhanpur platform,
text: four in the morning.
text: C/U Guddu walks up into frame, into focus. The moment that he
text: sees that Saroo is not there. His panic surges.
speaker_heading: GUDDU
dialog: Saroo?! SAROO?!
text: His panic rising, he runs, searching, continuing to scream.
scene_heading: INT. SAROO’S STUDENT APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: Guddu’s SCREAM (AUDIO) trails into the beginning of this
text: scene, as we find Saroo overcome by those screams. His head
text: racing. His heart pounding. His breath catching in his chest.
speaker_heading: LUCY (0.S.)
dialog: Are you okay?
text: He nods. Switches off the computer. This is too hard.
text: She’s sitting up in bed, watching him. Her great, dark eyes.
text: Her tangle of dark hair. She’s a goddess.
text: He dives back into bed, back into the sensuality, the
text: physical warmth, the miraculous present moment.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: I am now.

scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM & BEDROOM, BEACH HOUSE - CONTINUED
text: Saroo’s in the shower. Singing to himself.
text: Saroo and Lucy’s home - nothing expensive but evidence
text: everywhere of care, taste, and a nesting impulse.
text: Saroo dries himself. Towel around his waist. Walks into the
text: bedroom. Starts up his laptop.
scene_heading: ON SCREEN: India.
text: He scrolls randomly along a railway track; then stops at a
dialog: STATION.
text: The laptop struggles to render the image - the rotating hour-
text: glass spins and spins...
text: Saroo looks frustrated - his old laptop is crap.
text: Lucy hurries in. All dressed up. Corporate. Sparkling.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Wow. Look at you.
text: She does a spin.
speaker_heading: SAROO (CONT’D)
dialog: Your hem’s down...
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: (panics)
dialog: Oh God. It’s so long since I wore
dialog: this.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Have you got a stapler?
text: He gets one. Staples her hem for her. She notices the
text: computer struggling to render. Says nothing.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (reassures her)
dialog: They’11 love you.
text: He starts kissing her neck.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I haven't got time...
text: Saroo keeps kissing her, nuzzling - Lucy reciprocates.
speaker_heading: LATER
dialog: 61
text: Saroo’s alone - eating toast - dressed in his Assistant
text: Manager’s suit - name-pin on his lapel.
text: He returns to the laptop - the hourglass is still spinning!
text: He’s incredulous - shakes his head in disbelief.
scene_heading: INT. CONVENTION ROOM, HOBART GRAND HOTEL - DAY
text: We follow Saroo (in a suit) into a large convention room
text: which is at this moment bursting with activity.
text: The space is filled with STAFF setting big round tables with

speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Peter - have you got the individual
dialog: place cards too?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I’m on it.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (to another worker)
dialog: Michael - take three people with
dialog: you to the loading dock. The
text: flowers have arrived.
text: Michael heads off. Saroo stands there surveying his domain.
text: CLOSE: he shifts his tie, stretches his neck. We suddenly see
text: how uncomfortable he looks. Something not quite right.
text: He starts striding FAST out of the convention room -
scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE ONE-ROOM HOME, KHANDWA (FLASHBACK)
text: - and suddenly we’re behind LITTLE Saroo (same camera angle)
text: as he follows a scene of utter CHAOS as three POLICEMEN drag
text: screaming Guddu to a paddy wagon -
text: - Shekila wailing in Saroo’s arms, Guddu kicking and

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY, HOBART GRAND HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)
dialog: - and now ("REVERSE” of previous shot) we LEAD, tracking
text: backwards, as Saroo picks up speed - striding towards us -

scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM, HOBART GRAND HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)
text: STILL LIFE: an empty high-end hotel room. The door knocks.
speaker_heading: SAROO (0.S.)
dialog: Housekeeping.

dialog: Housekeeping.
text: The door opens. Saroo enters using his swipe card.
text: He sits on the sofa. Still breathing hard.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE ONE-ROOM HOME, KHANDWA (FLASHBACK)
text: Neighbors are gathering at their doors and windows, watching
text: the commotion, as the police drag Guddu from the door to a

speaker_heading: KAMLA
dialog: Guddu!
speaker_heading: GUDDU
dialog: Ammi!
text: SLAM! They bundle him, struggling, into the paddy wagon. His
text: fingers through the grille, his terrified eyes looking out.
speaker_heading: KAMLA
dialog: He hasn’t done anything wrong -
speaker_heading: HEAD POLICEMAN
dialog: - he was caught stealing eggs -
text: Kamla starts screaming, Saroo, still holding Shekila, steps
text: to the paddy wagon door.
speaker_heading: GUDDU
dialog: Saroo!
text: Saroo is shell-shocked, his big brother being taken away. He
text: is numb, trying to process it. But Kamla is positively feral.
text: As she screams and keeps kicking up a fuss, we’re CLOSER with
dialog: Guddu and Saroo:
speaker_heading: GUDDU (CONT'D)
dialog: Saroo! Listen to me. Pay attention!
text: Saroo crying, focuses on Guddu, nods bravely Okay.
dialog: 63
speaker_heading: GUDDU (CONT'D)
dialog: Whatever happens, you need to be

text: Kamla rattles the paddy wagon door, fearless, feral.
speaker_heading: KAMLA
dialog: Arrrrggghh! ...
speaker_heading: GUDDU
dialog: I’m talking about Ammi. You
dialog: understand?
dialog: Saroo nods, Yes.
speaker_heading: GUDDU (CONT'D)

dialog: Saroo couldn’t be prouder.
speaker_heading: GUDDU (CONT'D)
dialog: But you have to go! They will catch
dialog: you! I’1l be out soon! Go! Go to
dialog: Ammi! Go quickly!
text: Saroo nods, runs. He is his brother’s hero.
text: We follow little Saroo for a time. Sprinting his heart out.
text: Gliding through the dark Indian night.
text: Running. Running.
scene_heading: INT. SAROO & LUCY’S LIVING ROOM - VERY LATE NIGHT
text: Saroo is now lying on the couch - laptop on his belly - the
text: SOUNDS of his running fading from the previous scene.
text: An ever-so-slight smile on his face.
speaker_heading: FADE TO BLACK
scene_heading: EXT. EMPTY STREETS OF HOBART - DAWN (ESTABLISHING)
text: Music hovers. Empty dawn streets, eerily interesting. And so
text: still. Not even the birds are up yet.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, BEACH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: In the dawn light, Lucy walks into the living room, dressed
dialog: for a run.
text: She finds Saroo, passed out on the couch, laptop still open
text: on his belly. The neatly piled list of stations and other
text: search paraphernalia on the floor.
text: For a moment she looks concerned. Then she moves the laptop
text: off him - without looking at the screen. Wriggles onto the
text: couch, next to him. He groans.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Time for a run...
text: Saroo’s eyes open - his face says “You must be kidding me!”
scene_heading: EXT. CRADLE MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK - DAY
text: Saroo and Lucy run up a steep mountain track. Both hung-over,
dialog: for different reasons. But a combination of natural beauty,
text: fresh air and endorphins is kicking in.
text: Lucy pulls ahead - Saroo grabs the back of her T-shirt to
text: hold her back - she’s laughing.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Oh my god - you are such a bad
dialog: loser!
dialog: 65
text: Saroo manages to race past her. Claims victory - we can see
text: in him the same little kid from Wineglass Bay.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: We're BEHIND Saroo and Lucy, who are perched on a viewing
text: spot. Stretching in front of them:
text: Spectacular, expansive, glorious GREEN. And OCEAN beyond.
text: They're so HIGH UP, it’s like a Google Earth view.
text: Lucy looks utterly content. Closes and opens her big blue
text: eyes - we see this panorama through her eyes in all its
text: expansive glory.
text: Saroo’s eyes are wide open too - focussing -
text: - it’s the same view as Lucy’s - but not uninhabited -
text: Saroo’s POV: in the distance, the tiny figure of Guddu.
dialog: What’s Guddu doing here, on Mount Wellington? In the land of
dialog: the living?
text: Guddu’s silent stare calls to Saroo...
text: Lucy - smiles at Saroo - realizes he’s not here, with her, in
dialog: the present moment.
text: She looks disappointed. Worried.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM, BEACH HOUSE - DAY
text: Saroo is in the bedroom. He’s having a panic attack. Tries to
text: slow his breathing.
scene_heading: MEMORY, KHANDWA QUARRY
text: Kamla stands in the moonscape. She seems to be staring
text: straight at Saroo...
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM, BEACH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Lucy comes in.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Sweetheart? It’s after six...
text: Saroo squeezes his eyes shut. As if he could somehow block
dialog: out the present.
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Fine.
dialog: 66
scene_heading: INT. SUE’S ART STUDIO, BRIERLEY HOME - NIGHT
text: CLOSE on small, beautiful watercolors - ethereal landscapes,
text: horizons - stacked around, as Sue and Lucy step into the
text: downstairs sun-room/studio.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I don’t usually show anyone these -
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: They're beautiful ...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I do have fun. My secret hobby.
text: Lucy notices, on a shelf, a jumble of trophies. At a glance,
dialog: there seem to be about ten different sports here, from soccer
text: to windsurfing to cricket.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: Saroo’s. He was good at everything.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I had no idea.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: He was such a happy boy.
text: Lucy looks away. Spots a framed family photo, picks it up
dialog: gently.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Wow, look at Mantosh.
text: ON PHOTO: Saroo, Mantosh, Sue and John laughing on the boat.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Yep. He was a cheeky little
dialog: thing...
text: Lucy gazes closer at the snapshot of a lost, happy era.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT’D)
dialog: Pure energy. Impossible to control.
dialog: But incredible. If he could ever
dialog: learn to control it, he could do
dialog: anything. Saroo’s very protective
dialog: of him.
text: Lucy’s finding this conversation a little difficult. She has
dialog: so many questions she’d like to ask Sue, about Saroo’s
dialog: childhood.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: I’ve been blessed...
dialog: 67
scene_heading: EXT. UPSTAIRS DECK, BRIERLEY HOME - SAME TIME
text: Saroo on the deck with John, who’s just stacked some freshly
text: cooked chops on a plate. Sausages sizzling away on the grill.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Not partying too hard?
text: Saroo, amused by that.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Not partying at all!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You look a bit tired.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: It’s just work.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: How’s it with Lucy?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Great.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We love Lucy.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (entranced by the
dialog: sausages)
dialog: Yep. It’s hard not to. She’s great.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: SAROO (CONT’D)
dialog: I’ll get us another beer.
text: Saroo turns inside. John nods. Okay. Prods the meat.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, BRIERLEY HOME - CONTINUOUS
text: Saroo steps inside. And Mantosh is there, back turned,
text: rolling a cigarette as he props the fridge door open with his
text: leg, inspecting the contents.
text: He turns as he hears the sliding door.
speaker_heading: MANTOSH
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: Was wondering where everyone was.
text: His eyes are BLAZING STONED. Saroo takes him in.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Jesus. You couldn’t be a little
dialog: more wasted?
dialog: 68
text: Mantosh shrugs, grins. Aloof bravado, but fragile underneath.
dialog: Just holding on: clearly it’s a big effort just to come here.
text: At that moment Sue comes up the stairs with Lucy. Is very
text: happy to see Mantosh.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Darling -
speaker_heading: MANTOSH
dialog: Mum!
text: Sue goes - tentatively - to hug him. Mantosh somehow manages
text: to balance the half-rolled cigarette as she enfolds him.
text: Through the awkwardness, it somehow becomes a warm embrace.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (private, in his ear)
dialog: Well done for coming.
text: She breaks the embrace -
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: This is Lucy ...
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: (very friendly)
dialog: It’s nice to finally meet you.
text: Mantosh continues to roll his ciggie, licking the paper.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (nervous to confront him)
dialog: You have to smoke that outside.
text: Mantosh lights the cigarette, takes a deep toke.
speaker_heading: MANTOSH
dialog: No worries.
text: He heads outside to the deck. Saroo, fuming, can’t stand what
text: Mantosh does. He notices Sue, now readying the food in a
text: fussy and manic way.
speaker_heading: MANTOSH (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, Dad!
speaker_heading: JOHN (0.S.)
dialog: Son!
text: ON Lucy. Okay. Right. She feels the world, between them all,
text: in that cigarette smoke. All the spaces in between them.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM, BRIERLEY HOME - LATER SAME NIGHT
text: Saroo, Lucy, John and Sue at the table, serving up. A dark
text: cloud building over Saroo.
dialog: 69
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: (to Saroo)
dialog: I saw all your trophies...
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Oh Mum, you didn’t? -
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: (re: Saroo)
dialog: He never tells me anything about
dialog: growing up -
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That's just half. I’ve got more in
dialog: the garage.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: (re: Saroo)
dialog: These days I can’t get him off the
dialog: couch.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (warns)
dialog: Luce -—
text: Sue, John and Lucy quite taken aback by his sudden intensity.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Why can’t you tell them what you’ve
dialog: been doing? -—
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: - don’t -
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: - what’s that, luv? —-
text: Mantosh enters, even more stoned, rubbing hands, big grin.
speaker_heading: MANTOSH
dialog: Yum, dinner!
text: He sits. Notices the tension. And it’s not from him!
speaker_heading: MANTOSH (CONT'D)
dialog: What? What have I missed?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: MANTOSH
dialog: (noticing Lucy)
text: She looks upset.
speaker_heading: SAROO
text: She’s not upset.
dialog: 70
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: (to Saroo)
dialog: I can speak for myself. And how do
dialog: you know how I feel?
text: In his stoned amazement, Mantosh enjoys the spectacle.
speaker_heading: MANTOSH
dialog: Saroo knows everything. He’s an
dialog: expert. He’s a manager.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Why are you here?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: He’s here because he’s your
dialog: brother.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: No he’s not. We're different.
text: So cold, matter-of-fact. For Sue, a knife in the chest. For
dialog: John, an alarm-bell - it’s never been easy but this open
text: aggression is new. Mantosh goes from stoned amazement to deep
text: hurt. He looks rattled, vulnerable, and five years old. He
text: stares at Saroo, a deep wound opening in him.
speaker_heading: SAROO (CONT’D)
dialog: (awkward, but can’t stop)
dialog: Every fucking meal you do come to,
dialog: you have to get wasted -
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Now, now -
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (to Saroo)
dialog: How dare you.
text: Mantosh gets up - not coping - starting to become wild -
text: - John stands to soothe him - he knows this routine -
speaker_heading: MANTOSH
dialog: (so wounded)
dialog: - I wouldn’t want to be your
dialog: brother, mate —
text: John cradles Mantosh, tries to talk him down. Mantosh lashes
text: out - a verbal lashing too, semi-coherent. John doesn’t let
text: go - handles it as he always has - whispering the mantra into
dialog: Mantosh’s face -—
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: C’mon. Breathe. Big breaths. You're
dialog: okay. Shhh. Shh. You’re good, luv.
dialog: You're good.
dialog: 71
text: Mantosh continues muttering, distressed. Quite the show for
dialog: Lucy - 25 years of history in a minute.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Boys...
text: Mantosh breaks free, heads out the door - John follows -
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: No - Mantosh - it’s all good, shh -
text: John leaves in pursuit, he throws a glance back at Saroo -
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: - nice one, mate -
text: Sue looks to Saroo: if looks could kill.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: What’s going on?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: I hate what he does to you!
text: Silence. Sue turns to Lucy. Lucy is trapped - she hates
text: lying, but she has to be loyal to Saroo.
text: Sue looks disappointed in her. Lucy - mortified.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (to Lucy)
dialog: I see.
dialog: (to Saroo)
dialog: Whatever it is, I’m warning you, I
dialog: can’t do it.
text: Sue and Saroo - locked together.
text: O.S, AUDIO: fragments of John pleading ("Come on, mate, come
text: back inside,” etc). Mantosh’s car starting.
text: Sue’s silence circles Saroo, like a shark.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM, BEACH HOUSE - DAWN
text: It’s silent. Lucy’s just woken up. She’s in bed, alone.
text: Saroo’s pillows - neat. No sign he’s been in bed beside her.
text: Lucy - lost in her thoughts.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, BEACH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Lucy walks into the living room, wearing Saroo’s old T-shirt.
text: She opens the curtains. Sunrise floods the room.
text: Saroo locks eyes with her vulnerable, searching stare.
dialog: 72
text: He shuts the laptop - nothing here he wants to talk about. He
text: holds her gaze. Almost defiant. Yep. I’ve been up all night.
dialog: Yep. This is what I’m doing.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Why don’t you want your parents to
dialog: know?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: They've got enough to deal with.
dialog: You saw what Mantosh does to them.
dialog: It’s always about him. Ever since
text: he got off the plane.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: They’d support you. They’d
dialog: understand.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: They'd pretend to. Mum’d keep
dialog: smiling even if she was dying
dialog: inside.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Because she wouldn’t want you hurt.
dialog: She wants to protect you. She’s a
dialog: mother.
text: Beat. Saroo, so mad, so sleep-deprived, turning sour on Lucy.
dialog: Whose side is she on?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Wait. Do you even want me to find
dialog: them?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Of course I do. But I’m worried
dialog: about you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: About us.
text: He walks into the kitchen. Leaving Lucy stranded.
scene_heading: INT. LUKE’S PLACE - NIGHT
text: Saroo and Lucy arrive at a party in a terrace house. Loud
text: music - a narrow, packed hallway - a crush of PARTY GUESTS.
text: They greet their FRIENDS, including Luke - the host. Saroo’s
text: all smiles. Loud and cheerful - over-playing it.
text: Lucy's aware of his hyped-up mood - concern in her eyes.
scene_heading: INT. LUKE’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: A short time later, Lucy is dancing. Saroo’s drinking.
text: Looking around. Disconnected.
dialog: 73
text: She beckons to him. He ignores her. Wanders out.
text: She keeps dancing.
scene_heading: EXT. LUKE’S BACK YARD - NIGHT
text: Lucy searches out Saroo, who - uncharacteristically - has
text: found a corner to be alone in.
text: She stands in front of him. He doesn’t look at her. How long
dialog: will he actually ignore her?
text: She moves closer - takes his hands - places them on her body,
text: under her shirt. He pulls away.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: I need a beer.
text: As he starts to move past her, she loses it. Blocks his path.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: (furious)
dialog: “I need another beer.” You always
dialog: do that -
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Stop it, Luce -
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: - no, you stop it!
text: There are party guests nearby - Saroo and Lucy keep their
text: voices low, neither of them welcoming a public drama.
text: But now Saroo disengages, infuriating her more.
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT'D)
dialog: Where are you?
text: He shakes his head.
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT'D)
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (on the public setting)
dialog: I’m not prepared to argue with you.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Talk to me. Be with me.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Can this wait till we get home ...
text: The more he tries to avoid conflict, the angrier she becomes.
dialog: 74
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Home? You mean the place I live,
dialog: alone? With you - alone - in the
dialog: next room?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Luce -
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I moved here to be with you.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: - this isn’t working.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: What isn’t?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Any of it.
text: He moves past her -
scene_heading: INT. LUKE’S PLACE - CONTINUOUS
text: - and back into the loud party - and out of here -
dialog: - Lucy hot on his heels -
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Saroo!
text: Luke, watching them head for the door.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE LUKE’S PLACE - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)
text: Saroo just wants to get away. Lucy follows.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Don’t do this.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: You don’t get it.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: You have to face reality.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: What do you mean, “reality”?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: The reality that you’re ruining
dialog: your life! That you’re not even
dialog: here!
dialog: 75
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Do you have any idea what it’s
dialog: like, knowing my real brother and
dialog: mother spend every day of their
dialog: lives looking for me?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: (genuinely bewildered)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: How every day they scream my name.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And I feel their touch. I see their
dialog: faces. Can you imagine the pain
dialog: they must be in, not knowing where
dialog: I am? Twenty-five years, Luce.
dialog: Twenty-five!
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Why haven’t you ever told me this
dialog: was happening?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: And we swan about in our privileged
dialog: lives. Pretending. It makes me
dialog: sick.
text: Lucy is speechless.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: (faint, soft)
dialog: I never stopped you ...
text: It’s as if Saroo suddenly sees her pain properly. And is
text: brought back to earth. The air in him deflating.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Listen -. Lucy -. I’m sorry -. I
dialog: can’t do this -.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You deserve more -
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: - don’t! Don’t you dare.
text: Her eyes fill with tears.
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT'D)
dialog: This is on you! Not me.
text: Saroo can’t deal with her pain. He takes off. This time, she
text: doesn’t follow.
scene_heading: EXT. HOBART STREETS - NIGHT
text: Saroo walks the streets like a tormented soul.
dialog: 76
dialog: He can’t live in two worlds at once. He has to choose.
text: Slowly, his despair becomes defiance.
dialog: He’s made his choice.
scene_heading: IMAGINED MEMORY, KHANDWA STREETS
text: Kamla wanders the streets, distressed.
speaker_heading: KAMLA
dialog: Saroo!
text: (JUMP CUTS.) She’s beside herself. Searching empty laneways.
speaker_heading: KAMLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Saroo! Saroo!
text: Faces everywhere. Kamla looks like a crazy lady.
text: People peer out from their windows and doorways. She never
text: stops, the camera always moving.
text: A mother in panic.
scene_heading: EXT. EMPTY SUBURBAN STREETS, HOBART - PRE-DAWN
text: First hints of light. Saroo just wandering.
text: He seems drained. All movement, no thought.
scene_heading: EXT. KHANDWA RIVER - DAY (IMAGINED MEMORY)
text: Kamla is by the river, amongst the prayer, the smoke, the
text: chanting.
text: Kids in the river, swimming. Washing.
text: She hunts their faces.
speaker_heading: KAMLA
dialog: Saroo!
text: WIDE: she searches in this enormous landscape - strange,
text: poetic, haunting - the PEOPLE like ants ...
speaker_heading: KAMLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Saroo!
text: Her voice drowned out by the sound of a train, passing over
dialog: the river.
speaker_heading: FADE TO BLACK
dialog: 77
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, BEACH HOUSE - DAY
text: TWO MONTHS LATER. SOUND of the sea. Bright marine light. We
text: track through the house. It’s virtually empty. The atmosphere
text: of a squat.
text: No sign of homeliness, of warmth - of Lucy.
text: A mattress on the living room floor. A master map of India on
text: the wall. Piles of print-outs - lists of railway stations -
text: some marked-up - most still pristine. Images of water towers,
text: train platforms, under-passes.
text: Saroo - long hair, beard - has surrendered to his obsession.
text: MUSIC starts - continues into a series of HARD CUTS:
text: - Scrolling; waiting for the pixels to resolve.
text: - A blue “train station” symbol.
text: - CLOSER IN: a formless, satellite-image town.
dialog: - On Saroo: studying its features. No, that’s not it.
text: He stands - grabs a blue pin - sticks it into the map.
text: - leans back into the screen. Reads the next town -
dialog: - enters the name.
dialog: - blue train station symbol.
text: - Another town, the surrounds of the train station.
text: - He grabs another blue pin - sticks it into the map.
text: - Scroll. Symbol. Station. Pin.
text: - Scroll. Symbol. Station. Pin.
text: It becomes a rapid MONTAGE. Sound of someone hammering on the
text: front door.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Mantosh is at the door. He looks nervous, desperate, standing
text: there counting coins in his hand. He bangs harder on the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: MANTOSH
dialog: Saroo, ya bastard!
text: Silence. Mantosh, listening.
dialog: 78
speaker_heading: MANTOSH (CONT'D)
dialog: Saroo!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Mate, can you lend us fifty bucks?
text: CLOSE on Mantosh, sweating there at the door. He doesn’t look
dialog: good.
text: Mantosh gives up knocking, leaves.
speaker_heading: MANTOSH (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah, whatever, dude.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, BEACH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Saroo spies out of the window.
text: As Mantosh heads off down the beach, he’s joined by a DRUGGIE
text: MATE, who has been lurking somewhere near.
text: The mate looks to Mantosh, inquisitive, Well? Mantosh just
text: shakes his head, No go. They walk away.
text: Saroo turns. Guddu is there, also watching Mantosh.
text: Saroo and Guddu look at each other.
text: Saroo returns to his search.
scene_heading: INT. STATIONERY SHOP, MALL - DAY
text: TWO MONTHS LATER. Saroo - his hair longer, his beard wilder -
text: moves slowly down the aisle of a stationery shop - putting
text: boxes of COLOURED FLAG PINS into a basket.
dialog: He’s out of place in this vivid Charlie & the Chocolate
dialog: Factory world.
text: He stops at the pen section, testing high-lighters. Throws
text: some different-coloured boxes of those in his basket.
text: At the counter, as the items are scanned, we study Saroo’s
text: face. He looks exhausted. Doesn’t notice when the CASHIER
text: smiles at him.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: Same project?
text: Saroo nods, with an air of defeat.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN BEACH - DAY
text: Saroo walks along the sand with his shopping. Past rows of
text: suburban houses, their blank windows reflecting the sea.
dialog: 79
scene_heading: EXT. RAILWAY TRACKS, KHANDWA - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: Little Saroo on the tracks, proudly holds his pregnant belly
text: of coal. Guddu bustles over to him.
speaker_heading: GUDDU
dialog: Come on, hurry.
text: Little Saroo looks so happy, as they trot off together.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Saroo crosses the sand to the house. His face determined now.
scene_heading: I/E. TRAIN CARRIAGE, INDIA - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: Saroo’s POV: the world moves past in a watercolour blur -
dialog: ochre country, hills, mountains, trees -
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, BEACH HOUSE - DAY
text: ON SCREEN: tracking railway lines, flying above them -
text: station after station.
text: Saroo ZOOMS in.
text: His hopes up. He counts the platforms with his finger.
dialog: NO: yet again, that’s not it.
text: Disappointed, he zooms back out.
text: GOOGLE SCREEN JUMP CUTS: train track after train track ...
dialog: Platform after platform...
text: SOUND of a real train, approaching, coming under us:
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN LINE, INDIA - DAY (IMAGINED MEMORY)
text: Kamla walks up to the very edge of railway track just as a
text: train rips past very fast.
text: An endless stream of carriages - the noise and speed violent,
text: crazy, dangerous - but Kamla shows no fear.
speaker_heading: KAMLA
dialog: Saroo! Saroo!
text: Her screams drowned out by the racket of the train. She is in
dialog: hell, but cannot - will not - give up.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, BEACH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Saroo mirrors her desperation. He gets a beer, stares at the
text: map. A new colour being used now, for a new search zone.
text: About 15% of the search complete.
dialog: 80
text: He’s suddenly aware it’s the dead of night. He feels like the
text: only soul awake.
scene_heading: INT. FOOD COURT, MALL - DAY
text: TWO MONTHS LATER. CLOSE on a table filled with leftover
text: Chinese food (where some people have just finished and left
text: the table), when a SMALL INDIAN HAND comes into frame, the
text: fingers scooping up the food -
text: - we TRACK up the arm to reveal Guddu - wolfing down the food
text: with bare hands, greatly enjoying it - and all the while
dialog: staring across to -
text: - Saroo (other side of the food court) - who stares right
text: back, sitting in front of his untouched (western) meal.
scene_heading: EXT. MALL - CONTINUOUS
text: Saroo steps onto the escalator. The lights and muzak of
dialog: capitalism definitely not working wonders for him.
text: As he descends: there is someone ascending. It’s Lucy. She
text: looks grounded and somehow resolved.
text: They approach each other.
text: Lucy sees him. Alarm in her eyes. He looks like a crazy man.
text: Saroo swings across, from his escalator to hers.
text: As always, drawn by her vivid gaze, her intense life-force.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, BEACH HOUSE - DAY
text: Lucy follows Saroo up the stairs. She walks in and stops dead
text: at the sight of Saroo’s “Project”.
text: It’s mind-blowing. An entire wall is plastered in charts,
text: train-timetables, station-name-lists, grainy images from
dialog: Google Earth.
text: On the Master Wall is a big map - surrounded by smaller ones.
dialog: And all the pins ...
text: The floor layered in books, notes, clothes, take-away
dialog: containers.
text: We go closer to the Master Wall with Lucy, inspecting it.
text: Dense trails of colored drawing pins on the 400km search
dialog: radius - different colors for different train lines.
dialog: WALL KEY: green pin = Mumbai line, red pin = Nagpur line etc.
dialog: But our dominant visual information: in the past 6 months,
text: Saroo has covered a fraction of the search radius. The inner
dialog: circle only.
dialog: 81
text: Saroo responds to Lucy’s look of fascination and alarm.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Theoretically it’s not infinite.
text: She just stares at him.
speaker_heading: SAROO (CONT'D)

text: Saroo and Lucy sit on the beach.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: What was she like?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Beautiful.
text: He’s lost in the memory of it - staring out to the ocean,
text: drawing patterns in the sand.
speaker_heading: SAROO (CONT’D)
dialog: I’ve been visiting her.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Every night I walk those streets
dialog: home - home from the dam, home from
dialog: the station. I know every single
dialog: step of the way. And I imagine that
text: I’m whispering in her ear. “I’m
dialog: here. It’s all right.”
text: Silence. Lucy knows what he means - she’s imagined the same
text: thing with her own mother.
speaker_heading: SAROO (CONT’D)
dialog: How was New York?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Same old, same old.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: And now?
text: Lucy grins. There is good news.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Our funding came through.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: That’s great! See, they know how
dialog: good you are.
text: An awkward silence.
dialog: 82
text: Lucy can’t resist a moment longer - she reaches out and combs
text: his beard with her fingers. Her touch is like manna from
dialog: heaven.
speaker_heading: SAROO (CONT’D)
dialog: I miss you -
dialog: A pained beat -
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I saw your mom. She hasn’t been
dialog: well.
text: He doesn’t want to hear this.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: She'd freak if she saw me like
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: You underestimate her.
text: A long, sad pause.
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT'D)
dialog: She needs you.
scene_heading: EXT. KHANDWA MARKETS - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: A monsoon day - in the middle of a torrential downpour.
text: A MERCHANT (55) loads a giant WATERMELON into Saroo’s arms -
speaker_heading: MERCHANT
dialog: Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Go!
text: - the merchant keeping dry, looking for a gap in the traffic,
text: launching Saroo onto the wet road, with his green boulder -
text: - Saroo, ill-prepared for the task, as traffic whizzes by -
text: almost immediately his feet slide out from under him -
text: - and a MOTORBIKE blares out of nowhere, careening down upon
text: Saroo - too late - the motorbike brakes, skids, aqua-glides -
text: - SLAMS into Saroo - who sits up - YOW! - head bleeding,
text: watermelon gloop all around him, as the motorcyclist kick-
text: starts his bike, and drives off.
dialog: 
text: Saroo touches the blood -
text: - blood in the puddle where he sits, blood on his hand -
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD HOME TO GANESH TALAI - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: Saroo runs home through the rain, his shirt bunched to his
text: head, blood and rain streaming down his tiny torso -
dialog: 83
text: - he runs into the UNDERPASS - we recognize this as one of
text: the “Memory Maps” - and into BLACK -
scene_heading: INT. ONE ROOM HOME, GANESH TALAI - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: Kamla tends to Saroo’s gash. Saroo’s crying. Shekila’s
text: wailing. Kamla wipes the wound with a cloth.
text: Guddu enters, drenched too. It’s still pouring outside.
speaker_heading: KAMLA
dialog: Where were you? You were meant to
dialog: be looking after him!
text: Guddu knows he messed up. He looks upset, ashamed. Saroo and
text: Shekila cry and cry.
text: But now Kamla draws Saroo closer, and ever so gently she
text: kisses his forehead better. His crying begins to subside.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, BEACH HOUSE - DAY
text: But now, it’s not Kamla who kisses it better. It’s Lucy -
text: gentle, loving - kissing that old scar on Saroo’s forehead.
dialog: They've just made love - all those endorphins and oxytocin
text: flooding their bodies - on the mattress on the floor.
text: There’s an edge to it all: Saroo’s life still looks bachelor-
text: transient and obsessively preoccupied; Lucy is conflicted,
dialog: knowing she shouldn’t really have gone down this path.
dialog: But god it’s nice, after sex: even with the floating sadness.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: That village might not even exist
dialog: any more. Entire worlds change in
dialog: twenty-five years. I worry that ...
text: - but she lets it trail off, and hang.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: That what?
text: Long, sad pause.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: That you’re chasing ghosts.
text: She stands, pulls on her shirt. Smiles that brittle, pained,
text: loving smile at him.
text: And his own heart is broken, because he knows he can’t do
dialog: anything but keep on with that search.
text: She opens the door, walks out.
dialog: 84
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, BEACH HOUSE - DAY
dialog: It could be later the same day. It could be another day. Time
text: has blended into something amorphous. Saroo lies on his
text: lonely mattress. All is still; even the sea is calm. Then his
text: past silently weaves into his consciousness, all these
text: vignettes and flashbacks united in their stillness, as his
text: eyes flicker closed:
scene_heading: INT. ONE-ROOM HOME, KHANDWA - EVENING (FLASHBACK)
text: ON KAMLA - unmoving, sensing Saroo;
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM, LILUAH - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
text: ON little AMITA, lying in bed, staring.
scene_heading: EXT. CALCUTTA STREET - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: ON CAFE GUY - his kind stare through the cafe window (as
text: Saroo sits on that traffic island, fantasizing non-existent
text: food on his rusty bent spoon -
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM, HOWRAH STATION - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
text: ON WIRY BOY - just moments before he decides to offer the
dialog: cardboard, dignity and generosity - then:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM, NOOR’S ROOFTOP HOME, MORNING (FLASHBACK)
text: ON RAMA - his slow-moving hand along Saroo’s leg ...
speaker_heading: RAMA
dialog: You’re a good boy. Are you a good
dialog: boy?
text: (O/S AUDIO) Whimpering - a scuffle - shouts. A confusing
text: auditory nightmare. Beatings. Cries of anguish. Rape. Liluah.
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM, LILUAH - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: ON HAUNTED BOY, swaying back and forth, rubbing his hair and
text: forehead, a pressure cooker about to explode. He bangs his
text: head against the wall, over and over.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM, HOWRAH STATION - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
text: The SOUND of Haunted Boy banging his head carries over into
text: screaming and sudden pandemonium, as the CHILD-SNATCHERS
text: arrive and the URCHINS scream and scatter and WIRY BOY is
text: violently grabbed and wrenched away, screaming -
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, BEACH HOUSE - LATER
text: Saroo’s eyes, still flickering. Guddu sits in the dark - it’s
text: dusk or dark now - watching over Saroo. Keeping his distance.
dialog: Giving Saroo space. He knows the memories are the search...
dialog: 85
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, BEACH HOUSE - DAY
text: A knock at the door. Saroo wakes and goes to the window.
text: Looks down.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH HOUSE - INTERCUT
text: John, looking up. He has a “care package” from Sue. He puts
text: it by the door. He waits. Nothing.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It’s the One Day International
dialog: tomorrow. Come over if you like.
dialog: We'll get some beer and pizzas.
text: Nothing from inside the house.
text: INSIDE: Saroo just stands there, pressed against the wall.
text: Frozen. Conflicted.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: I meant to tell you - I fixed the
dialog: tiller. Why don’t we take her out,
dialog: head up the coast? Maybe see if we
dialog: can round up Mantosh.
text: Pause. John, listening.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Saroo, your mum’s not -
dialog: Whatever he was about to say ("Your mum’s not doing so
text: well”), he stops it. Looks down at the care package.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Your mum’s made a nice cake for
dialog: you. Put a few other goodies in
dialog: here too.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I think she’d love a visit.
text: He stands there, hoping against hope that Saroo will suddenly
dialog: appear.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Right. Take care, son.
text: He turns to walk away.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Saroo sits on the beach, a starry night. Watching the water -
text: the ghost-waves marking time like a pulse ...
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, BRIERLEY HOME - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
text: A night light in the kitchen illuminates Sue, standing at the
text: sink. Her arms hanging limp. Exhausted. Mute.
dialog: 86
text: Five-year-old Saroo steps beside her. Reaches up, takes her
dialog: hand.
text: She snaps out of it, looks down on him. It’s all right, says
text: the look on his face.
text: A private communion. The son comforting the mother. Then, as
text: if remembering her duty to look after him, Sue pulls Saroo
text: close, cradles his head.
text: They stand there, a silent tableau.
scene_heading: INT. SUE’S ART STUDIO, BRIERLEY HOME - AFTERNOON
text: Concern registers on Saroo’s face as he enters the little
text: room. Sue sits in the weak sunlight by the window. She looks
text: pale and unwell, in her dressing gown, nursing a cup of tea.
text: Saroo doesn’t look crash-hot either - months of no sleep or
text: exercise have taken their toll. Two lost souls.
text: But she brightens at the sight of Saroo.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (hugging her)
dialog: I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
text: He sits opposite her. She holds back tears.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: John just heard, he’s been out on
text: the boats. Doing the lobster run.
dialog: They’re due back tomorrow.
text: Saroo looks at her, doesn’t want to admit what this means.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: So he’1l be flush for cash. And
dialog: then back on the hard stuff ...
text: Saroo can see in her pain how much she loves Mantosh. She
text: smiles bravely, her pale eyes sparkling.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: I’m sorry you couldn’t have your
dialog: own kids.
text: ON SUE: a misconception, dawning on her.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: What are you saying?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: I mean, we weren’t blank pages,
dialog: were we? Like your own would have
dialog: been. You weren't just adopting us,
dialog: but our pasts as well.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And I feel like we're killing you.
dialog: 87
text: Sue smiles - still holding off the tears.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: We could have had children. We
dialog: chose not to.
text: ON SAROO: shocked by this new information.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Wait. You could have had kids?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Never made that public. Some things
dialog: need to stay private. Some people
dialog: would never understand why you’d
dialog: start a family like ours. We wanted
dialog: you two in our lives. We chose
dialog: that.
text: Saroo is moved. Listening intently.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT’D)
dialog: (smiles, remembering)
dialog: I think it’s one of the reasons I
dialog: fell in love with your dad.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We both felt the world had more
dialog: than enough people in it already.
dialog: Because to have a child - that’s no
dialog: guarantee that’s going to make
dialog: things better. But to take a child
dialog: who's suffering - like you boys
dialog: were - and to give him a chance in
dialog: the world. Well, then. Now there’s
dialog: something.
text: Saroo looks with wonder at his mother. What she’s given up.
dialog: Without her, where would he have ended up?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: I bet you never imagined it would
dialog: be this hard.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: It’s not a matter of hard or easy.
dialog: There was only ever one path.
dialog: That’s how I believe things happen.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: When I was twelve, I had a vision.
dialog: Some people would call it a
dialog: breakdown ...
text: Saroo, completely intrigued by his mother opening up like
dialog: this - in such strange ways.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: You know my father was an
text: alcoholic. Out of control.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 88
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: All wrong. I remember I was
dialog: weeping. Or I'd wept it all out.
dialog: There were no more tears. I was
text: standing out the back of the house.
dialog: Looking out across this field. I
dialog: literally wanted the earth to
dialog: swallow me. There wasn’t any joy.
dialog: Life was a nightmare. And I felt
dialog: this kind of - electric current -
text: electric shock - jolt through me.
dialog: And there was a little brown-
dialog: skinned boy across that field. I
dialog: couldn’t even tell if it was just
text: my eyes playing tricks. And then he
text: was beside me. Just standing there.
dialog: And I sensed it so strongly. I
text: could feel his warmth.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: SUE
text: Literally. The left side of my body
dialog: started to heat up.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Did you try to talk to him?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: It wasn’t like that. Anyway, I was
dialog: doubting my sanity. Even as it
dialog: happened.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: It didn't speak?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: It stood beside me. And for once in
dialog: my bleak life, I felt something
dialog: good. And I knew it was guiding me.
dialog: And I knew - in my heart - I'd be
dialog: fine. It was as if, at that moment,
dialog: I could suddenly believe in the
dialog: future.
text: Saroo sits there, haunted and entranced by her story.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: And now - I don’t know where I’m
dialog: going. I don’t know what anything
dialog: means any more. I thought I could
dialog: hold everything together. By an act
dialog: of will.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: - oh, Mum -
dialog: 89
speaker_heading: SUE
text: But it’s all just splinters.
text: Everything splintering off.
text: Saroo, pained. He shrugs, palms up: I don’t know what to say.
scene_heading: HIGH AERIAL - MORNING
text: Way down there, Saroo’s car travels along the wild, lush,
dialog: remote Tasmanian coast.
scene_heading: I/E. CAR / NEAR DOVER LOBSTER PORT - DAY
text: Saroo winds down towards a wild windswept inlet. Towards
dialog: Mantosh’s shed...
scene_heading: EXT. MANTOSH’S SHED - CONTINUOUS
text: Saroo pulls up, gets out, bangs on doors. Peers in through
dialog: the windows.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (calls)
dialog: Mantosh!
text: Wide: the lonely ghost gums echo his call.
scene_heading: INT. SAROO’S CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: He gets back in the car, to wait it out... the trees, the
dialog: isolation... the quiet... relief almost...
text: He winds his seat back. Stillness.
speaker_heading: KAMLA (V.O., PRE-LAP)
dialog: That one is Makara, the sea
dialog: monster. You see his long tail?
speaker_heading: SAROO (V.O., PRE-LAP)

dialog: he fly?
scene_heading: MEMORY, ROOFTOP, ONE-ROOM HOME, KHANDWA
text: Looking DOWN on Kamla, Guddu, Kallu and Saroo (Shekila
text: wrapped in swaddling, sound asleep), all lying on their backs
text: on the flat roof, looking up at the stars.
speaker_heading: KAMLA
dialog: I don’t know. It’s as deep as the
dialog: ocean up there.
text: Pause. They’re all staring straight up, in wonder.
speaker_heading: KAMLA (CONT'D)
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: See the bright one, and the line
dialog: like that? That’s Simha. The lion.
dialog: 90
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Will he eat us?
speaker_heading: KAMLA
dialog: He might. When he gets hungry
dialog: enough.
text: ON Saroo: gazing up. Sheer wonder. Thinking about Simha.
text: REVERSE - their POV. The incomparable spread of stars.
scene_heading: INT. SAROO’S CAR - DUSK
text: Saroo, looking up at the ceiling of his car.
text: A single tear rolls from his eye. Gentle SOUNDS on the roof -
text: spitting of rain.
text: BANG on the window - a wet and bedraggled MANTOSH, has just
text: pulled up in his UTE, waders over his arm, smoking a joint.
speaker_heading: MANTOSH
dialog: Brother from another mother. Your
dialog: hair looks as bad as mine.
text: Saroo, sits up, gets out. Mantosh offers Saroo the joint.
text: Saroo shakes his head No.
text: Mantosh takes a big toke. Flicks the joint away.
scene_heading: INT. MANTOSH’S SHED - CONTINUOUS
text: Inside, it’s barely habitable. A grimy sink. A rickety table.
text: A single bed with grey blankets that look damp.
text: Mantosh pours cheap whisky into two grubby glasses. He turns
text: the RADIO on low.
text: They sit, clink glasses, take a sip. Mantosh’s cheery facade
text: fails to hide his desolation and desperation.
text: He holds his hand out, horizontal.
speaker_heading: MANTOSH
dialog: I’m off the speed, mate.
text: Perhaps his hand trembles, just a little; Saroo notices.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: That’s good. ‘Cos Mum’s not well.
speaker_heading: MANTOSH
dialog: (wary)
dialog: Oh yeah? What is it?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Stress. She thinks she’s gonna lose
dialog: you -
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 91
speaker_heading: SAROO (CONT'D)
dialog: (quick adjustment: )
dialog: - us. She’s worried about us.
text: It hangs there. Big thing for Saroo to say. Mantosh, taking
text: it in. His heart shifts, a notch. His big brother just spoke
dialog: of them as an ‘us’.
speaker_heading: MANTOSH
dialog: That’s no good.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Nah.
speaker_heading: MANTOSH
dialog: I should get out to see her.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: Long pause.
speaker_heading: SAROO (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m sorry for what I said at
dialog: dinner.
text: Mantosh shrugs, remembering. A silent, painful It’s nothing.
speaker_heading: SAROO (CONT’D)
dialog: You been all right?
text: Just the act - the intention - of Saroo trying to connect: it
text: breaks something open in Little Brother. Mantosh heaves a
text: single sudden dry sob - then stops it. All the world’s pain
dialog: in those shoulders.
speaker_heading: MANTOSH
dialog: We were the untouchables. You know
dialog: that, don’t you? You know how much
dialog: our lives were worth. Nothing.
dialog: Zero.
dialog: (remembering: such pain)
dialog: They had no problem touching me.
text: He looks up at Saroo as if coming out of a trance.
speaker_heading: MANTOSH (CONT'D)
dialog: You were one of the lucky ones. I’m
dialog: not having a go at you. I’m
dialog: genuinely happy for you.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: What do you mean, “luck”? - Mate, I
dialog: think about my mother in India
dialog: every day, knowing I’1l never see
dialog: her again. Same as you.
dialog: 92
speaker_heading: MANTOSH
dialog: (smiling, but an edge)
dialog: Not the same. I had bad luck being
dialog: born. You got LOST! That’s all that
dialog: happened, bro. And before anything
dialog: bad even happened, you got whisked
dialog: off to Australia. Do you know how
dialog: long I was in Liluah for? Fourteen
dialog: months.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: MANTOSH (CONT'D)
dialog: Not untouchable in there.
text: Silence. Saroo, staring at Mantosh. The “lucky ones”. He
dialog: knows he’s got a point: at Liluah, Saroo escaped the
dialog: bogeyman.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: What happened to you was bad. It
dialog: was just bad. But this is not how
dialog: you deal with it, Mantosh. You
dialog: think I’m lucky; I think I made my
dialog: own luck. I don’t know which one’s
dialog: true. I didn’t have choices. When
dialog: that train took off, I didn’t have
dialog: a choice. You've got to keep going.
dialog: Sometimes that’s all it is.
text: Mantosh just looks at him. They both seem exhausted.
speaker_heading: SAROO (CONT’D)
dialog: You've suffered enough.
speaker_heading: MANTOSH
dialog: I’m persevering, bro. Trust me.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: I’ve already lost a brother. I
dialog: don’t want to lose you too.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I need you, bro. We gotta keep this
dialog: family together. You and me.
text: A light coming back into Mantosh’s eyes. Just hearing this.
dialog: But then, too, the irony:
speaker_heading: MANTOSH
dialog: We do things differently, you and
dialog: me. You try to remember. I try to
dialog: forget.
text: Saroo is moved by his insight. They sit in silence in this
text: new, fragile camaraderie - the radio still playing low, B/G.
text: Mantosh stands at a song he likes. Turns up the volume. Kylie
dialog: Minogue’s I Can’t Get You Out Of My Head.
dialog: 93
text: He takes a large swig of whiskey. A big smile spreads.
text: He starts to dance to the music. His ridiculousness is
text: infectious, and Saroo smiles too.
speaker_heading: MANTOSH (CONT'D)
dialog: C’mon, dance with your brother!
text: Mantosh turns the volume up louder.
speaker_heading: MANTOSH (CONT'D)
dialog: (over the racket)
dialog: c'mon!
text: Saroo reluctantly gets up. And dances. Two goofy brothers.
text: And then: they begin to lose themselves.
text: The scene becomes loud, frenetic, crazy. They can’t believe
text: they’re doing this. They’re laughing like mad.
speaker_heading: MANTOSH (CONT'D)
dialog: (shouting in Saroo’s ear)
dialog: I love you, Saroo. I’m gonna get
dialog: better.
dialog: Saroo grins, Okay, then. Good.
text: Mantosh takes a big swig straight from the bottle.
text: Passes it to Saroo, who does the same. Grinning.
dialog: And now, they really do lose themselves. The dance is
text: completely mad. And glorious.
scene_heading: INT. MANTOSH’S SHED - DAWN
text: DAWN. Saroo, wrapped in a blanket. Staring at his sleeping
text: brother. The scars on Mantosh’s hands. The tobacco-stained
dialog: fingers. The fragility.
text: CLOSE: gently, carefully, Saroo places the old Ganesh
text: medallion in the palm of Mantosh’s hand.
text: He closes Mantosh’s fist around the medallion.
scene_heading: EXT. PEBBLY BEACH NEAR MANTOSH’S SHED - DAWN
text: Saroo steps outside into the freezing morning. No one about.
text: Not a sound. Not a bird. Just the WILD WIND and the small

speaker_heading: HARD CUT:
scene_heading: EXT. PEBBLY BEACH, TIDELINE - CONTINUOUS
text: Saroo, a tiny figure, walks down to the water’s edge.
dialog: 94
text: He strips off - and starts to walk into the water... stopping
text: as the pain of the cold kicks in... the endless horizon
dialog: beyond.
text: He looks back at the shed - Mantosh will not survive without
dialog: him.
text: He spots Guddu, looking vulnerable, worried, is he losing
dialog: Saroo?...
text: His locked stare with Guddu. A deep breath from Saroo -
text: - Guddu looks alarmed, as if he wants to stop Saroo -
dialog: - Saroo DIVES.
text: UNDERWATER - fluid, peaceful, muffled. Saroo’s wild hair
dialog: flowing.
text: He comes up - roaring - oh, the shock! - his wild wet mane -
speaker_heading: SAROO
speaker_heading: ROAAAARRRGGHHH!
text: Roaring in pain. Grief. Anger. Knowing he can’t go on.
text: Roaring his past away. BIG emotional moment, then in its
dialog: wake...
text: Guddu is gone.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Saroo steps up to the wall. All its madness in front of him.
text: He reaches for a flag pin. Pulls it out. What’s he doing?
text: He stabs it back into the map - to a totally different part
text: of India. Way outside the search radius.
text: Then with both hands, he starts pulling out flag pins,
text: stabbing them anywhere. Jumbling them up. Pins everywhere.
text: There are pins now all over the place. Pakistan. The
dialog: Himalayas.
dialog: He’s just deliberately ruined a year or two of painstaking
text: work. Making certain it’s over, and there’s no turning back.
text: Casually, he SWIPES at a section of printouts spreading out
text: from the main map, scotch-taped together. In a domino effect,
text: other printouts tear away. More flag pins go flying. A mess.
text: He leans his head against the wall.
text: Saroo slumps down on the couch. End of the road. He has to
dialog: move on too.
dialog: Over on the Wall: that mess he’s just made.
dialog: 95
text: The laptop sits open on the couch. He leans across, places
text: his finger on the trackpad, follows a train line -
text: - then starts to flick the track pad, faster. So that before
dialog: the station has time to reach full resolution -
text: - he flicks again, carelessly, without method.
text: And suddenly - it’s a kind of goodbye - he veers off the rail
text: line completely - out over land - and more land -
text: - doing on the SCREEN what he just did on the WALL -
text: - random shifts, here, there, left, right. Jerky. EVERYTHING
text: starts cascading in his psyche, as his memories make their
text: final fight for life. So we see MAD SNIPPETS and FLASHES:
scene_heading: GUDDU - COAL THEFT - DAM - JOY - UNDERPASS - STREETS —
scene_heading: WATERMELON ACCIDENT - HIDE AND SEEK WITH SHEKILA AND KAMLA.
text: - and on and on it goes - interwoven with the Google Earth
text: search on screen, as Saroo carelessly continues flicking the
text: cursor, saying goodbye to the search as his past and his
text: memories disintegrate into fragments -
text: He stops. Exhausted. His face perfectly blank. Equally
text: randomly now, he tap-tap-taps on that “Zoom Out” minus sign.
text: He ZOOMS OUT, higher. Higher. We’re now staring down on a
dialog: good chunk of India.
text: Scrolling, Saroo flicks quite a distance left. Still just
text: random moves. We are now way outside the search perimeter.
dialog: Nothing matters. Flick, flick. Who cares?
text: And then: something stops him. He tilts his head -
text: ON THE SCREEN: an expanse of ochre fields.
text: He pulls the laptop onto his thighs. Something about that
text: COLOR. Still as the Sphinx, he stares at the screen.
scene_heading: HIGH AERIAL ABOVE FIELDS - (DAY)
text: - matching the Google Earth, but real: we’re hovering above a
text: real ochre landscape. STILL. We can hear nature - the
text: tickling of the grass, the whole earth vibrating.
dialog: (NOTE: this shot should also recognizably MATCH the landscape
text: of the 4000-feet-above-India shot, those parched ochre fields
text: from the opening AERIALS...] -
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, BEACH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)

text: As he carefully stands, and spreads his arms:
text: PANORAMIC WIDE of an ochre landscape. Full of yellow
dialog: butterflies.
text: The YELLOW is fluttering, fluttering, and starts FILLING THE
speaker_heading: FRAME.
text: AUDIO: very faintly a haunting refrain rises: the lullaby
dialog: little Amita sang that long-ago night in Liluah.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, BEACH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)
text: The lullaby carries over to the present - we’re back with
text: Saroo - more ALERT - scrolling on the Google screen -
text: We scroll over fields. Villages. Then a railway line.
dialog: He does what he’s always done: trace the tracks to find the
dialog: next station.
scene_heading: - A FLASH: POV FROM MOVING TRAIN (from when he was trapped)
dialog: of those WIDE OCHRE FIELDS -
text: He keeps scrolling, scrolling. And soon enough: the train
text: line enters a mid-sized TOWN.
text: We're over the centre of the town. He zooms in closer.
text: The Google Earth blue railway station symbol, hovering.
text: The rail lines. The platform.
text: Closer in. Closer.
dialog: And then, on Saroo: Huh. What’s that?
text: ON GOOGLE EARTH SCREEN: it’s blurry. But it looks a little
text: like a water tower.
text: Saroo blinks, looking at it. Zooming in. His head tilts:
text: - this water tower, getting a little clearer as he zooms.
scene_heading: SAROO’S “MEMORY MAP”: FLASHBACK 1 - WATER TOWER (NIGHT)
text: Little Saroo alone on the deserted platform. Where’s Guddu?
text: Saroo shivers, holding himself. He looks up. At the tower.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, BEACH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)
text: Saroo, sitting up straight. Looking as spooked as that child.
dialog: 97
text: ON SCREEN: it’s a WATER TOWER. It’s certainly similar.
text: Saroo leans in closer to the screen. His finger touches the
text: platform. And the water tower. Working out the angles.
scene_heading: SAROO’S “MEMORY MAP”: FLASHBACK 1 - WATER TOWER (NIGHT)
text: We PUSH IN on little Saroo, standing frightened on that
text: haunted platform, looking up at the water tower off-screen.
text: REVERSE: we PUSH IN on the water tower.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, BEACH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)
text: ON SCREEN: zooming, closer, closer. The satellite resolution
text: becoming clearer. That’s a tower. That’s the water tower.
text: The pixels coarsen and blur as the zoom reaches its limit.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (a breath)
dialog: It can’t be -
text: Saroo actually cups his hands over his mouth.
text: His back is ramrod straight. His nerves on fire -
text: - and suddenly, frantically, he scrolls, scrolls, scrolls -
scene_heading: AERIAL - OCHRE FIELDS - DAY
text: High in the air, we RUSH across the Indian landscape -
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, BEACH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)
scene_heading: (NOTE: CONTINUE RAPID INTERWEAVING BETWEEN THE HIGH AERIAL
text: GLIDES & THE GOOGLE SCREEN SCROLLING ...]
text: - ON GOOGLE EARTH SCREEN: as he scrolls, the pointer races
text: across the landscape in jerks: across ochre fields, across
text: rivers, roads ... sometimes the train line is on screen and
dialog: sometimes not - because Saroo’s not following the track now -
dialog: he knows where he’s going -
dialog: - he’s going HERE:
dialog: - it’s a DAM. Holy shit. It’s a dam.
scene_heading: SAROO’S “MEMORY MAP”: FLASHBACK 2 - DAM (DAY)
text: Guddu’s POV: we’re spinning in a circle, holding onto Saroo
text: with outstretched arms as he too shrieks with laughter.
text: WIDE of same: Guddu twirls Saroo around in the shallow water
text: by the dam, tiny Saroo’s feet barely skimming the surface.
text: Guddu lets go, Saroo flies into the water. He jumps up,
text: laughing. Drenched in golden sunlight.
dialog: 98
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, BEACH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)
text: Saroo’s hands are shaking. Fingers on the track pad, urgent.
dialog: This cannot be happening.
text: He zooms in closer. ON Google Earth screen, more details: the
text: clay shore, the LONG DAM WALL.
scene_heading: SAROO’S “MEMORY MAP”: FLASHBACK 2 - DAM (DAY)
text: - a beautiful, sun-drenched moment: five-year-old Saroo
text: sprinting homewards, the dam receding behind him (with its
text: LONG DAM WALL). Elation and urgency mixed together.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, BEACH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)
text: Saroo keeps scrolling, paying 1000% attention.
text: ON SCREEN: he stops on the town.
text: Saroo, scrolling. Eyes attentive to every detail.
text: ON SCREEN: the name hovering above the town is “Khandwa”.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (it doesn’t ring a bell)
dialog: Khandwa?...
text: But his fingers trace across the screen. There’s the STATION -—
scene_heading: EXT. STREET NEAR KHANDWA STATION - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: Little Saroo continues running home, past Khandwa Station.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, BEACH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)
text: Saroo, scrolling along -
scene_heading: - ON GOOGLE EARTH SCREEN: the UNDERPASS -
scene_heading: SAROO’S “MEMORY MAP”: FLASHBACK 3 - UNDERPASS (DAY)
text: Little Saroo continues running home - into the underpass -
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT:
text: - and pops out the other side -
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, BEACH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)
text: Saroo, scrolling frantically. Nose inches from the screen.
text: ON GOOGLE EARTH SCREEN: we scroll OVER the underpass - out
dialog: the other side - following roads -
scene_heading: (NOTE: CONTINUE TO BLEND WITH RAPID FLASHES OF REAL AERIAL]
text: - left, right, right - the roads getting narrower ...
dialog: 99
text: And now, at last: a NAME floats above this part of town.
speaker_heading: GANESH TALAI
dialog: ON Saroo: what?? WHAT??!!
text: ON SCREEN: there it is. Floating. “Ganesh Talai”.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Ganesh Talai. Ganesh Talay.
dialog: Ganestlay.
text: He gasps. Then an involuntary LAUGH comes from deep in his
text: belly. A feeling that this can’t be happening.
text: And now he picks up speed, and scrolls, ever faster -
text: - ON SCREEN: the streets, narrower and narrower —
scene_heading: INT. GANESH TALAI STREETS - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: Little Saroo, sprinting, lungs bursting, joyful, homewards -
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, BEACH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)
text: - Saroo, glued to the screen. Scrolling. Left, right. The
text: streets getting narrower.
text: ON SCREEN: a street so narrow it could only be an alleyway.
scene_heading: SAROO’S “MEMORY MAP”: FLASHBACK 4 - ALLEYWAY TO HOME (DAY)
text: We FOLLOW over little Saroo’s shoulder as he rounds the final
text: corner to the narrow alley to home: past the house with the
text: lurid aqua walls, past the overflowing bougainvillea -
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, BEACH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)
text: ON SCREEN: We stop. Above a nondescript CLUSTER OF SHACKS.
text: We ZOOM, closer, closer. Towards a single specific BUILDING.
text: Closer. Until the pixels coarsen, and the roof is a blur.
text: Saroo, breathing hard. Staring so intently at the screen.
text: That blurry, pixellated roof fills the entire screen.
text: On Saroo, brimming with emotion.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (very softly)
dialog: Ammi ...
text: - that Hindi word, rising up from the deep.
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT:
dialog: 100
scene_heading: EXT. SHARE HOUSE - SAME NIGHT
text: Saroo knocks. Lucy comes to the door. They stare at each
text: other. She looks frightened - what’s happened...
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: I found home...
dialog: Her face - doubt, belief, joy for him. Did you just say what
dialog: I think you said?
text: Saroo’s eyes, wide in amazement. That’s a Yes.
text: Lucy wraps her arms around Saroo. They embrace tightly - -
dialog: what does this mean for them?
text: Held in that embrace - rocking gently together - Saroo
dialog: breathes.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, BEACH HOUSE - NEXT DAY
text: Saroo holds the door open as Sue walks into the room.
text: John, just arrived in his work clothes, stands there, proud
text: as punch - watching his wife.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You need to look at this -
text: Sue enters slowly, mesmerized by something off-screen.
text: Emotions palpably rippling across her face.
text: REVERSE: we follow her as she walks up to the map - it’s
dialog: still in disarray from Saroo’s flag pin destruction, but you
dialog: can see how amazing and methodical it was.
text: Sue studies it. The grandeur, the scope, the epic madness -—
text: even in its fractured state. Its magnificence.
text: ON Saroo: watching her, anticipating her response.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: This is where you've been?
text: He nods.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: I didn’t want you to feel I was
dialog: ungrateful...
text: Sue takes it all in, astonished.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Saroo.
text: She embraces him, overcome with emotion.
dialog: 101
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: I really hope she’s there. She
dialog: needs to see how beautiful you are.
text: John joins in the embrace.
scene_heading: INT. QANTAS A380 TO INDIA - NIGHT
text: Saroo in his window seat on the plane. Peering out, down into
text: the dark earth. Most everyone else is asleep, and the lights
text: are dimmed. But Saroo’s awake, and deep in thought.
dialog: And just like that five-year-old - twenty-five years ago,
text: heading off to the unknown - he pulls the shade down, up. But
dialog: only once.
scene_heading: EXT. DREAM QUARRY - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: We’re back in our mythic, prehistoric, dust-shrouded
text: landscape. The washed-out whiteness. The white dust.
text: And again, Saroo running across the sun-baked rubble, white
text: with dust himself. Everything so heightened and surreal.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Ammi! Ammi!
text: He’s carrying something close to his chest, like a bright
text: orange heart. He’s beaming, proud.
speaker_heading: SAROO (CONT’D)
dialog: Ammi!
text: And there in the distance, Kamla turns again. Shading her
text: eyes against the sun. Covered in the white quarry dust.
speaker_heading: SAROO (CONT’D)
dialog: Look what I’ve got!
text: He reveals his offering: in the middle of all that white - a
text: perfect, bulbous MANGO. Glowing in its perfect orangeness.
text: She reaches out her hand. Touches his face in thanks. What an
dialog: unimaginable treat.
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT:
text: Saroo and Kamla sit on the rocky ground, devouring the mango.
text: The juice streaks their dust-caked faces. Sucking at the
text: flesh, the nectar. A playful delight coursing through them.
speaker_heading: SAROO (CONT’D)
dialog: I threw a rock. I knocked it out of
dialog: the tree!
dialog: 102
speaker_heading: KAMLA
dialog: (grinning, nodding)
dialog: Good boy.
scene_heading: I/E. TAXI / ROAD FROM INDOOR TO KHANDWA - DAY
text: Saroo in the back seat of the taxi. Peering intently out the
text: window at the landscape rolling by.
text: The fields. The small towns.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM, KHANDWA - DAY
text: We FOLLOW CLOSE behind Saroo as he enters his hotel room and
text: throws the backpack on the bed.
text: Saroo at the window. Looking down on the bus terminal and -
text: further away - train station from this third floor room.
text: POV: all the mad activity down there in the streets.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM, KHANDWA - TWENTY MINUTES LATER (DAY)
text: Saroo lies fully clothed, spread on the bed. Shoes still on.
text: Arms spread. Staring up at the ceiling.
text: He’s wide, wide awake. The ceiling fan turning. No way he’s
text: getting twelve hours’ sleep.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: All right.
text: He leaps up.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET, KHANDWA - MINUTES LATER (DAY)
text: Saroo walks along the busy street. Hard to read his face.
text: Past the busy station. And suddenly now in front of him: the
text: UNDERPASS. He strides ahead. His legs carrying him forward
dialog: now.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD HOME TO GANESH TALAI - TWENTY-FIVE MINUTES LATER
text: Saroo strides along the road. Purposeful.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF GANESH TALAI - MINUTES LATER (DAY)
text: Saroo knows exactly where he’s going. Automatic pilot through
text: those never-forgotten streets. Turning left. Turning right.
text: Now he RUNS - as he did through these streets as a child.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEYWAY TO SAROO’S CHILDHOOD HOME - MINUTES LATER
text: Saroo turns into a narrow alley. Heart positively pounding.
text: He rounds the next bend and -
dialog: 103
dialog: - stops dead.
text: From BEHIND, his view down the ALLEY, past that house with
text: those (now faded) lurid aqua walls, past the overflowing
dialog: bougainvillea: we recognise that long-ago childhood home.
text: REVERSE of this: looking at Saroo. Only it’s 5-YEAR-OLD-SAROO
text: who’s standing there now. Still as a statue. Awed.
text: Little Saroo starts moving forwards, towards home. We track
text: backwards with him. He’s not scared, just calm, amazed. He’s
text: been waiting for this moment for a long, long time.
text: He arrives at the door -
text: HARD CUT to side angle: now it’s ADULT Saroo, peering in
text: through the rotted slats of the door -
dialog: And ... it’s abandoned in there.
text: His POV: in there, in the gloom, there’s NOTHING. That dirt-
text: floored shack, the rubble of a former life.
text: He steps back. So that’s it. Shit. Stands there, at a loss.
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: (in Hindi)
dialog: Can I help you?
text: Saroo turns. It’s a WOMAN, 21, with a BABY in her arms.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Hi! Um - I used to live here.
dialog: (off her blank look)
dialog: You don’t speak - ?
dialog: (pointing at the shack)
dialog: I used to live here.
text: He unfolds a sheet of paper.
text: ON THE SHEET: it’s an enlarged photocopy of that photo taken
text: at the police station when he was five.
speaker_heading: SAROO (CONT’D)
dialog: That’s me. I used to live here.
text: The woman nods politely. But can’t understand a word he says.
text: A middle-aged MAN pokes his head out from a doorway.
scene_heading: ENGLISH-SPEAKING MAN
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Hello. You speak English?
scene_heading: ENGLISH-SPEAKING MAN
dialog: Yes. A little.
dialog: 104
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Have you lived here long?
scene_heading: ENGLISH-SPEAKING MAN
dialog: Some time.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (pointing at photo)
dialog: I’m Saroo. This is me.
dialog: (pointing at empty house)
dialog: I'm looking for, um. Kamla, Guddu,
dialog: Kallu, Shekila.
text: The man looks from Saroo to the house. To Saroo.
scene_heading: ENGLISH-SPEAKING MAN
dialog: Here? You lived here?
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Here. Yes.
text: The man takes a long look at Saroo. Squinting.
scene_heading: ENGLISH-SPEAKING MAN
dialog: Wait here.
text: And he simply turns, and walks away.
dialog: Saroo: every nerve ending is alive. We CIRCLE him. Everything
text: else a background BLUR - chatter in Hindi, PEOPLE popping out
dialog: of doorways.
text: And Saroo staring down the alley to where that man just
text: disappeared around a corner. Where has he gone?
text: Saroo starts walking, as in a dream, toward the corner.
text: The people trailing him. But we’re CLOSE with Saroo.
text: Momentarily, the man reappears around the corner.
scene_heading: ENGLISH-SPEAKING MAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Come.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Come where?
scene_heading: ENGLISH-SPEAKING MAN
dialog: (he’s already moving)
dialog: Come.
text: They walk. Saroo in his trance.
text: Rounding the corner - Saroo, the man, the curious HANGERS-ON.
text: And fifty metres ahead, there are THREE WOMEN standing there -—
text: stunned, uncertain. Two of them flanking the ONE IN THE
text: MIDDLE, lightly holding her by the elbows.
dialog: 105
text: Behind them, their own entourage of curious HANGERS-ON.
text: On Saroo: brain about to explode. This can’t be real. Can it?
text: As Saroo and entourage move towards the three women, the
text: three women and entourage begin to move towards him.
text: PUSHING IN towards the women: to that one, CENTRE OF FRAME.
text: Kamla. A quarter of a century older. Still as beautiful.
text: REVERSE - PUSHING IN towards Saroo, as he walks towards us.
text: On Kamla: with immense confusion and reservation, staring up
dialog: at this giant man, this total stranger.
text: - and as she gets closer, looking into his eyes -
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Ammi -
text: - and she knows it’s him.
speaker_heading: KAMLA
dialog: Sheru!
text: They embrace each other, tightly.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (close, soft)
dialog: I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
text: They hold the embrace.
text: Then Kamla starts running her hands over Saroo’s face.
speaker_heading: SAROO (CONT’D)
dialog: It’s me -
dialog: (showing her the photo)
dialog: Look -
text: The instant Kamla looks at the photo, it ALL comes back, and
text: she weeps. Hugging Saroo, wailing, touching his face.
text: The commotion growing. PEOPLE appearing. Explanations flying -
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT:
text: The little crowd has grown further. Everyone talking at once.
text: Kamla can’t stop hugging Saroo, touching him, squeezing him.
speaker_heading: A NEIGHBOR
dialog: Are you sure it’s him?
speaker_heading: KAMLA
dialog: (stabbing the photo)
dialog: It’s him. I know it’s him. My son
text: has come back.
dialog: 106
text: She reaches up, parts the hair on his forehead. Sure enough,
dialog: the scar.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: The watermelons!

dialog: (in Hindi)
dialog: Watermelons.
speaker_heading: KAMLA
dialog: The watermelons!
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: (in Hindi, imitating)
dialog: Tarabuja! [Watermelon]
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And Guddu? Where is Guddu?
speaker_heading: KAMLA
dialog: (heartbroken)
dialog: Guddu. Guddu.
text: Saroo, not wanting to believe what he thinks she’s saying.
scene_heading: ENGLISH-SPEAKING MAN
dialog: Guddu is no more.
dialog: (beat; clarifies)
dialog: He is with God.
text: Amidst all this surreal joy, a knife in the heart. Saroo
text: looks at the man - numb and uncomprehending.
text: He looks to Kamla: is it true? Surely it’s not true.
dialog: In her eyes: it’s true. It’s true. Such sorrow.
text: They embrace. She weeps. AUDIO muffles - they’re in some
text: private space that sound can’t penetrate. They gaze into each
dialog: other’s eyes. Pain, love, joy -
text: Then: a COMMOTION. The crowd parts for ADULT SHEKILA (27).
speaker_heading: KAMLA
dialog: (she’s nearly hysterical)
dialog: Shekila! It’s him!
dialog: (to Saroo)
dialog: This is Shekila! This is your
dialog: sister!
text: Saroo, amazed.
speaker_heading: SAROO
dialog: Shekila?
text: Kamla nods yes; a howl of joy from Saroo -
dialog: 107
speaker_heading: SAROO (CONT’D)
dialog: Shekila!
text: He pulls her into the embrace.
text: The onlookers crowding and touching him, as if he’s not real.
text: Saroo and his mother and sister, locked in the embrace.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD TO KHANDWA STATION - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
dialog: That last night together, twenty-five years ago: little
text: Saroo, King of the World, perched on the handlebars as Guddu
text: pedals for all he’s worth through the streets of Khandwa.
text: They're gliding. Banking. Soaring. The world is rushing by.
speaker_heading: A YOUNG MAN
dialog: Go, Guddu!
text: It’s as if they’re being cheered through the very streets.
speaker_heading: SMALL FADE.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM, KHANDWA - LATE AT NIGHT
text: Saroo - a profoundly changed man - at the window, looking out
text: over Khandwa and the train station.
text: The street stalls, the lights, the endless traffic.
speaker_heading: SUE’S PHONE MESSAGE (V.O.)
dialog: Hello. You've reached Sue Brierley.
dialog: I can’t get to the phone right now,

scene_heading: EXT. DAM, KHANDWA - LATE AFTERNOON
text: The warm late sun floods the air as we come upon adult Saroo
text: walking along the water’s edge by the dam, where a new
text: generation of KIDS are splashing and playing - just as Saroo
dialog: used to do, twenty-five years ago.
text: The dam wall over there. Out in the water: two BOYS
text: frolicking, shrieking.
text: Saroo, watching them.
speaker_heading: SAROO (V.O., CONT'D, FROM PREVIOUS)

scene_heading: SAROO'S VOICE ON SPEAKERPHONE
dialog: My mother thanks you both for
dialog: raising me. She understands you’re
dialog: my family. She’s happy just knowing
dialog: I’m alive.
dialog: (long beat)
dialog: I found Ammi. But that doesn’t
dialog: change us. I love you, Mum. So
dialog: much. And you, Dad. And Mantosh.
dialog: We're a family.
scene_heading: EXT. DAM, KHANDWA - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Saroo stands there by the dam. Taking it all in.
text: He turns. Up ahead: that ridge where the railway track runs.
text: Saroo starts walking up the embankment to the track.
scene_heading: EXT. RAILWAY TRACKS, NEAR DAM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Saroo is walking TOWARDS US along the tracks. Stepping on
dialog: every second sleeper. The dam over there, B/G.
text: REVERSE: MATCH SHOT so it feels like a normal reverse, BUT -
text: ON THE REVERSE: it’s twelve-year-old Guddu and five-year-old
text: Saroo, walking AWAY FROM US down that long stretch of track.
text: Guddu’s arm draped over Saroo’s shoulder. Saroo dragging a
text: stick behind him, clack-clack-clack along the sleepers.
text: They're literally walking off into the sunset. And we

dialog: We're very HIGH - they’re TINY SPECKS - we’re
text: FADING TO BLACK.
text: In the blackness, SUPERS come up, one after the other:
text: Saroo Brierley made it back to Ganesh Talai on February 12,
dialog: 2012. He’d been lost for over 25 years.
dialog: 109
dialog: He learned that 25 years earlier, on the same night he
text: stepped up into that carriage, his brother Guddu died - hit
text: by a train not far from the platform.
dialog: Saroo’s mother, Kamla, had never given up hope of Saroo’s
dialog: return, and had never moved away.
dialog: She said she was “surprised with thunder” that her boy had
dialog: come back, and that the happiness in her heart was “as deep
dialog: as the ocean.”
dialog: Saroo learned that all those years ago, as a five-year-old,
dialog: he had been mispronouncing his own name.
dialog: He was “Sheru” -
dialog: - “LION”
dialog: AND SLAM INTO:
text: - that police station PHOTO of 5-year-old Saroo - the REAL
dialog: PHOTO, not our actor -
text: We PUSH slowly, slowly CLOSER AND CLOSER into the photo -
text: - into those huge, determined eyes.
text: CUT TO BLACK.
