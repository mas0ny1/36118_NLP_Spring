scene_heading: 1 A FLASH OF LIGHT 1
text: A radiant shiny something dazzling in EXTREME CLOSEUP.
scene_heading: BEGIN TITLES.
text: CAMERA very slowly PULLS BACK. The sparkling surface
text: turns out to be a lot of carats. WE SEE the stone, then
text: the ring, then suddenly, in b.g., something HUGE SWEEPS
text: by. REVEAL a mechanical claw above the ring, hanging
text: from a crane. The ring sits in a sea of tiny dolls,
text: joke eyeballs, and other carnival junk.
text: The claw descends on the ring again and again, sometimes
text: catching it for a moment then tragically dropping it --
text: accompanied by OOHS and AAHS (O.S.) of hope and disap-
text: pointment. INTERCUT with the HANDS of a young black man
text: working the controls. The EYES of a young black woman
text: watching him work. Another guy's HANDS digging in his
text: pocket for change. QUARTERS going into the slot.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: This'll never work, Tommy.
speaker_heading: TOMMY (O.S.)
dialog: Be positive, Armando. Course it will.
text: The claw inadvertently snags a rabbit's foot.
speaker_heading: TOMMY (O.S.)
dialog: Look. See what a lucky fuck I am?
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: He don't mean the ring, hon, he
dialog: means the whole plan.
speaker_heading: TOMMY (O.S.)
dialog: So do I.
text: The claw catches the ring and closes on it. QUICK CUTS
text: of their FACES as the crane rises. A very pretty lady.
text: A beefy Latino with a two-day beard. Their apprehension.
text: Tommy's confidence. Then his exceptional smile. He gets
dialog: the ring.

dialog: spicy virgin mary no salt, a club
dialog: soda -- good choice -- a lime

scene_heading: 6 INT. FUNCTION ROOM - DAY 6
text: Tommy, maintaining his vantage point, repeats another
text: order, this time in a heavy CARRIBEAN ACCENT:

dialog: lime and no ice, a gin Gibson
dialog: straight up with ex-tra onions
dialog: -- I am also fond of de onions --
dialog: and a Chardonnary spritzer...also
dialog: with extra onions -- no, no, do
dialog: not worry, that is just a little
dialog: joke. There will be no onions

dialog: Oh, at first, none of us in the

dialog: it was when the two-year-old across

speaker_heading: ANDERSEN
