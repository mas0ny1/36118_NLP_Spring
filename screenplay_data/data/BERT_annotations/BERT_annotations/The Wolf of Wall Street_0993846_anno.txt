speaker_heading: JORDAN (V.O.)
dialog: Check this out -- despite my

dialog: absolute favorite.
scene_heading: 13 INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDAN'S OFFICE - DAY (FEB `95) 13
text: Gadgets, computers, oxblood leather furniture. With
text: the DIN of the brokerage firm bleeding in, Jordan uses

speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: Enough of this shit'll make you
text: invincible, able to conquer the
dialog: world and eviscerate your enemies.

speaker_heading: JORDAN (CONT'D)

text: He crumbles it into a ball and tosses it into a corner,
text: where it comes to rest with two dozen others. Over his
text: back as we TRACK HIM out of his office toward what sounds
dialog: like the ROAR of a mob--
speaker_heading: JORDAN (V.O.)
dialog: Money doesn't just buy you a
dialog: better life -- better food, better
dialog: cars, better pussy -- it also
dialog: makes you a better person. You

speaker_heading: JERRY FOGEL
dialog: You got a problem with that?
dialog: (reads name tag)
dialog: Jordan?
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: Nope. No problem at all.
dialog: 7.
dialog: The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13
speaker_heading: JERRY FOGEL
dialog: Your job is `connector', which
dialog: means you'll be dialing the phone
dialog: over 500 times a day, trying to
dialog: `connect' me with business owners.
dialog: And till you pass your Series 7,
dialog: that's all you'll be doing. Sit.

speaker_heading: JERRY FOGEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Just so you know, last year I made
dialog: over 300k and the other guy you'll

speaker_heading: JORDAN (V.O.)
dialog: A million dollars? I could only
dialog: imagine what a douchebag that guy
dialog: must be.
text: A manicured hand lands on Jordan's shoulder. It's MARK

speaker_heading: MARK HANNA
dialog: Jordan? Mark Hanna.
dialog: (re: Fogel)
dialog: Good, you've met Jerry. One of
dialog: the smartest guys in the office.
dialog: Who's ever sucked a dog's cock out
dialog: of loneliness.
text: Fogel's smile turns to a frown. He hands Jordan a stack
dialog: of 3x5 index cards.
speaker_heading: JERRY FOGEL
dialog: Smile and dial. And don't pick
dialog: your fucking head up till one.
speaker_heading: MARK HANNA
dialog: Don't mind Jerry, his father raped
dialog: him as a child. Besides, I'm
dialog: senior broker here, he's a
dialog: worthless piker. I heard you
dialog: pitched stock at your job
dialog: interview.
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: Had to do something to stand out.
speaker_heading: MARK HANNA
dialog: I fuckin' love that! Let's grab
dialog: lunch later. Windows good with

text: electronic stock ticker encircling the room -- 9:30 a.m.
speaker_heading: MARK HANNA
dialog: Let's fuck!!
text: RING!!! Absolute pandemonium at the BELL signalling the
text: opening of the stock market. Feet fly off desks; Brokers
text: and their Connectors dial phones like mad. The CAMERA
text: PUSHES IN on JORDAN, mesmerized as he takes in the ROAR.
speaker_heading: BROKER #1
dialog: (to Broker #2)
dialog: Miniscribe's a fuckin' steal!
dialog: Thirty eight bucks a share!
speaker_heading: MARK HANNA

dialog: Your broker in West Virginia?
dialog: What are you buying, a coal mine?
dialog: It's the 80s, the game is high-
dialog: tech.
speaker_heading: BROKER #2
dialog: (to Broker #3)
dialog: Fuckface! I got 50,000 July 50s!
speaker_heading: JORDAN (V.O.)
dialog: You want to know what money sounds
dialog: like? Visit a trading floor on
dialog: Wall Street. Fuck this, shit
dialog: that. Cock, cunt, asshole. I
dialog: couldn't believe how these guys
dialog: talked to each other--
text: Fogel notices Jordan sitting there frozen. He covers his
text: mouthpiece, kicks the desk violently.
speaker_heading: JERRY FOGEL
dialog: Dial the cocksucking phone!
text: Jordan snaps out of it, starts dialing.
speaker_heading: JORDAN (V.O.)
dialog: I was hooked within seconds.
text: Mark Hanna slams down his phone in victory, scrawls out a
text: "buy" ticket. He places the ticket into a glass cylinder
text: which he slips into a plastic pneumatic tube.
speaker_heading: JORDAN (V.O.)
dialog: It was like mainlining adrenaline.
text: The tube is WHOOSHED into the ceiling and we're suddenly--

text: CLOSE ON a COKE SPOON whose contents disappear up a

text: The lunchtime power spot with panoramic views of the
text: city. At a corner table, a paranoid Jordan looks around
text: as Hanna does another bump of coke. None of the other
text: DINERS seem to notice or care.
speaker_heading: MARK HANNA
dialog: (offering the spoon)
dialog: Got enough for one more? Tootski?
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: No. Thanks though.
text: Hanna slips the vial into his pocket as HECTOR, the
text: tuxedoed Maitre'D, approaches.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for
dialog: you on this glorious afternoon?
text: Hanna surreptitiously palms Hector a $100; Jordan
dialog: notices.
speaker_heading: MARK HANNA
dialog: Here's the game plan, Hector.
dialog: Bring us two Absolut Martinis
dialog: straight up. Precisely seven and
dialog: a half minutes after you deliver
dialog: those you'll bring two more, then
dialog: two more every five minutes until
text: one of us passes out.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: An excellent strategy, sir.
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: Actually, I'm good with 7-Up.
text: Jordan might as well have farted at the table.
speaker_heading: MARK HANNA
text: First day on Wall Street, Hector.
dialog: Give him time.
dialog: (Hector offers menus)
dialog: No thanks, I'm not eating.
text: Hector heads off.
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: You can get high during the day
dialog: and still function?
dialog: 10.
dialog: The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13
speaker_heading: MARK HANNA
dialog: High is the only way to do this
dialog: fucking job. Guy who coined the
dialog: term "three-martini lunch" was a
dialog: woman. Cocaine and hookers, my
dialog: friend, the keys to success.
text: Jordan smiles, not sure if Hanna is kidding.
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: I gotta say, I'm really excited
dialog: about being part of your team.
dialog: I wanna do all I can for our
dialog: clients and --
speaker_heading: MARK HANNA
dialog: (reciting an ad)
dialog: "Here at L.F. Rothschild, our
dialog: clients aren't just important,
dialog: they're family." Just as long as
dialog: we get our taste first. Remember
dialog: something, Jordan, your top
dialog: priority in this job: make us
dialog: money. If the clients get rich
text: along the way, bully for them.
dialog: Got a girlfriend?
speaker_heading: JORDAN
text: Wife. She cuts hair.
text: Mark swallows a comment about that. Gets to business.
speaker_heading: MARK HANNA
dialog: OK, first rule of Wall Street.
dialog: Nobody -- and I don't care if
dialog: you're Warren Buffet or Jimmy
dialog: Buffet -- nobody knows if a
dialog: stock's going up, down or fucking
dialog: sideways, least of all stock
dialog: brokers. But we have to pretend
dialog: we know. Make sure you stay
dialog: relaxed. Nobody wants to buy
dialog: something from someone who sounds
dialog: like they haven't gotten laid in a
dialog: month. Take breaks when you feel
dialog: stressed, jerk off if you can.
dialog: You like jerking off, right?
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: Well... sure.
speaker_heading: MARK HANNA
dialog: Good, jerking off is key. And I
dialog: highly recommend cocaine, which
dialog: will make you dial faster, which
dialog: is good for me. Churn `em and
dialog: burn `em, baby.
dialog: 11.
dialog: The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13
text: A BUSBOY stops by with a fresh napkin for Mark who thanks
text: him. Then, discreetly as possible, Mark removes a fresh

text: Jordan realizes: that's why he palmed the maitre d' $100.
speaker_heading: JORDAN (V.O.)

speaker_heading: JORDAN (V.O.)
dialog: They called it Black Monday.
dialog: By four p.m. the market was down
dialog: 508 points, the biggest one-day
dialog: drop since the crash of `29.
text: 4 p.m. The closing bell RINGS; the entire place goes

dialog: So I'll take an extra shift, don't
dialog: worry about it.
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: You work too much as it is.
speaker_heading: TERESA
dialog: We could pawn my engagement ring.
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: We're not pawning anything. I'm
dialog: gonna be a millionaire, Teresa.
speaker_heading: TERESA
dialog: You know that doesn't matter,
dialog: right?
text: He smiles, kisses her. Together, they peruse the ads.
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: (points to an ad)

speaker_heading: TERESA
dialog: You're a stock broker.
speaker_heading: JORDAN

speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: I'm looking for Investor's Center?
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: That's us, hey. Dwayne.
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: (as they shake hands)
dialog: Jordan Belfort, I called earlier.
dialog: I was a broker with Rothschild.
text: Dwayne motions Jordan to a seat. Nearby, a Broker in

speaker_heading: TOBY WELCH
dialog: I'm tellin' you, this stock is
dialog: goin' up!... Cause I know,
dialog: okay?!... I have inside
dialog: information!
text: Jordan looks at him, appalled at what he's hearing.
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: Where are your quotrons?
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: No quotrons, we sell off the pink
dialog: sheets -- penny stocks.
text: Dwayne slides Jordan a large thin book; its pages are
text: literally pink. He explains as Jordan flips the pages:
speaker_heading: DWAYNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Company don't have enough capital
dialog: to be listed on NASDAQ, their
dialog: shares trade here.
dialog: (points to the book)
dialog: Like these guys, Aerotyne? They
dialog: make radar detectors out of a
dialog: garage in Dubuque.
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: Six cents a share? Who buys this
dialog: crap?
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: Schmucks mostly. Mailmen,
dialog: plumbers, people thinking they can
dialog: get rich quick. They answer our
dialog: ads, Popular Mechanics, Hustler.
dialog: 14.
dialog: The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: The spread on these is huge.
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: So's your commission, that's the
dialog: point. Blue chips stocks you get
dialog: what, one percent? Pink sheets
dialog: are fifty.
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: Wait a second. You're telling me
dialog: if I sell two thousand dollars
dialog: worth of stock, my commission is a
dialog: thousand bucks?
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: Technically, yeah, but not even
dialog: the biggest schmuck buys two
dialog: thousand dollars of this shit.
scene_heading: 28 INT. INVESTOR'S CENTER - (LATER THAT) DAY (DEC '87) 28
text: As others Brokers bark into phones, Jordan sits, phone
text: cradled in his shoulder, making notes. A few beats, then:
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Mr. Fleming, good morning, Jordan
dialog: Belfort with Investor's Center in
dialog: New York City. You recently
dialog: responded to one of our ads...
text: A few of the other Brokers glance over, eavesdropping.
speaker_heading: JORDAN (CONT'D)
dialog: The reason I'm calling is that
dialog: an extremely exciting investment
dialog: opportunity crossed my desk today.
dialog: Typically our firm recommends no
dialog: more than five stocks per year:
dialog: this is one of them...
text: A few more Brokers look over...
speaker_heading: JORDAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Aerotyne International is a
dialog: cutting edge tech firm out of the
dialog: Midwest, awaiting imminent patent
dialog: approval on a new generation of
dialog: radar equipment...
text: LATER. Now all the Brokers listen in rapt attention.
dialog: 15.
dialog: The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13
speaker_heading: JORDAN (CONT'D)
dialog: -- so if Aerotyne's shares rise
dialog: to only a dollar -- and our
dialog: research indicates they could go
dialog: much, much higher -- your profit
dialog: on a mere three thousand dollar
dialog: investment would be upwards of
dialog: fifty thousand... That's right,
dialog: you could pay off your mortgage.
text: Seconds tick by; an eternity, then he starts writing:
speaker_heading: JORDAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Four thousand dollars, will
dialog: that be check or money order?...
dialog: Thank you, sir.
text: Jordan hangs up, scrawls out a "buy" ticket.
speaker_heading: JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Just like that I made two grand.

speaker_heading: JORDAN (V.O.)
dialog: The weird thing was when he'd do

dialog: Phantom of the Opera.
text: Donnie does a hit of crack; his jaw twitches, then his

speaker_heading: DONNIE
dialog: You now, take a hit!

speaker_heading: SEA OTTER

speaker_heading: SEA OTTER

speaker_heading: TERESA

speaker_heading: TERESA
dialog: Never gonna make anybody money.
dialog: (a few beats; then)
dialog: Wouldn't you feel better selling

speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: Rich people don't buy penny

speaker_heading: TERESA

speaker_heading: JORDAN (V.O.)
dialog: But what if they didn't sound like
dialog: jerk-offs? What if I took this
text: bunch of nincompoops and molded
dialog: them in my own image? I
dialog: reinvented the company, gave it a

text: And as his Brokers settle in to folding chairs--
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: Gentlemen, welcome to Stratton
dialog: Oakmont. The clients we've gone
dialog: after in the past -- they're done.
dialog: We will now target exclusively the
dialog: wealthiest one percent of

dialog: hype is worthless with these

dialog: 23.
dialog: The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13
speaker_heading: JORDAN (CONT'D)
dialog: In military terms it's like carpet-
text: bombing -- noisy, menacing and
dialog: only marginally effective. As
dialog: Stratton brokers you will be laser-
dialog: guided smart-bombs aimed at high-
dialog: priority targets. You will
dialog: establish an initial relationship
dialog: with your clients selling only
dialog: blue chip stocks -- then and only
dialog: then will you attempt to sell the
dialog: pink sheets, where the real money
dialog: is. Now the key to every sale is
dialog: this:
text: Jordan writes the word "URGENCY" on the board.
speaker_heading: JORDAN (CONT'D)
dialog: No one buys stock unless he thinks
text: it's going up and going up now.
dialog: You must convince your client to
dialog: buy before the takeover happens,
dialog: before the lawsuit is settled,
dialog: before the patent is granted.
dialog: If he says I'll think about it and
dialog: call you back, it's over, you're
dialog: dead! No one calls back! So you
dialog: have to create urgency --
scene_heading: 48 INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO SHOP BULLPEN - DAY 48
text: Another day. With Stratton Oakmont signage visible in

text: CLIENT, the other Brokers listening in.
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: --and once Kodak settles the

speaker_heading: CLIENT (O.S.)

speaker_heading: SAUREL
dialog: The only way the Banque Real de

dialog: foreign legal body is if the crime
dialog: being pursued also happened to be
dialog: a crime in Switzerland. But there
dialog: are very few Swiss laws pertaining
dialog: to your "rumored" improprieties.
dialog: Which is why Mr. Azoff's joke is
