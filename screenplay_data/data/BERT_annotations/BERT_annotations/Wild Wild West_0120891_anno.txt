scene_heading: A1 EXT. ALFALFA FIELD - NIGHT A1
text: A slight breeze gently sways the green and purple crop.
text: The CHIRP of CICADA is the only sound.
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSE: 1868 - ST. TAMMANY PARISH, LOUISIANA
text: But suddenly the CHIRPING GETS LOUDER and LOUDER --
text: BZZZZZ! -- until we realize it's not the cicadas, but
dialog: a --
text: SWOOOSH! A lethal, razor-sharp DISC BUZZES up over the
text: horizon, swoops TOWARD the CAMERA and OUT OF FRAME!
text: The CAMERA SPINS AROUND to see the disc flying away,
text: chasing a man, THADDEUS MORTON, wearing a strange
text: metallic collar -- exhausted, horrified, about to die.
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE - MORTON
text: He looks over his shoulder, panting -- he's been running
dialog: forever.
speaker_heading: MORTON
dialog: (mumbling)
dialog: Madman... Hideous spider... Run...
dialog: Run! Warn the President...
text: Morton zig-zags through a grove of trees, a desperate
text: attempt to avoid the horrible serrated disc. But the
text: ruse is futile. The disc goes straight through the
text: trees, slicing a path straight as the crow flies.
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE - OLD WAGON
text: dilapidated, broken down, weathering away in the field.
text: Morton runs around the wagon -- but the DISC BUZZES
text: straight through the sideboards! Wood shavings spit
dialog: everywhere! There's no stopping this thing.
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE - MORTON
text: running for his life -- stops, turns. He turns,
text: incomprehensibly mumbling, pleading for his life,
text: cowering.
speaker_heading: MORTON
dialog: Noooooooo!!!!!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 4/9/99 2.

scene_heading: NIGHT SKY FULL OF STARS - LOW ANGLE
text: A man leans INTO FRAME. This is GENERAL McGRATH. And
text: he's there to collect the silver death disc.
speaker_heading: McGRATH
dialog: (to the unseen,
dialog: dead Morton)
dialog: And they says you scientists are
dialog: supposed to be smart.
scene_heading: 1 EXT. DUSTY ROAD - LOW ANGLE - NIGHT 1
text: HOOVES THUNDER by. Then bouncing, skidding wagon wheels.
text: Up on the empty buckboard is a pair of murderous ex-Rebs.
text: As the Rebs pass a pint of whisky, lash the six-horse
text: team on, PAN WITH the wagon to see it's headed for...
scene_heading: 2 EXT. WATER TOWER - NIGHT 2
speaker_heading: SALOON GIRL (O.S.)
dialog: The legendary Captain James West
dialog: and I finally got him all to
dialog: myself.
scene_heading: 3 INT. WATER TOWER - NIGHT 3
text: WEST is bathing with the beatiful SALOON GIRL.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: That's right, sugar, and you
dialog: should feel free to treat him
dialog: just bad.
text: She moves in and kisses him, long and hard. West hears
text: the CLATTER of the APPROACHING WAGONS. He stops the
text: kiss and peeks out the knothole.
scene_heading: 4 EXT. WAREHOUSE - WEST'S POV THROUGH KNOTHOLE - NIGHT
text: Down below, West sees the wagon with the Rebs.
scene_heading: WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 4/9/99 3.
scene_heading: 5 INT. WATER TOWER - NIGHT 5
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: General McGrath's boys. I thought
dialog: y'all was never gonna show up.
speaker_heading: SALOON GIRL
dialog: Mister West, you wouldn't be here
dialog: workin' tonight, now would you?
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: No, no. 'Course not. Not tonight.
dialog: Would you be working if you were up
dialog: here with you?
speaker_heading: SALOON GIRL
dialog: Good.
text: They start kissing again. He surreptitiously peeks out
text: the knothole, while continuing his kiss.
scene_heading: 6 INT. FAT-CAN CANDY'S - NIGHT 6
text: This two-story, Victorian building across town is a
dialog: "gentlemen's sporting house" in name only. Drunken
text: roughnecks and ex-Confederate soldiers goose and maul
text: the rouged-up tarts.
speaker_heading: AT BAR - WOMAN
text: shrinks back from the moronic ribaldry. The Toulouse
text: Lautrec lighting only accentuates her garish hair and
text: makeup, identifying her as a SOILED DOVE. A whore -- not
dialog: to put too fine a point on it. She's trying not to make
text: eye contact with two men seated at a table across the
dialog: parlor.
scene_heading: SOILED DOVE'S POV - GEN. McGRATH AND HUDSON
text: HUDSON is a fearsome-looking Indian in a well-tailored
text: suit. Long black braids descend incongruously from under
text: a homburg hat. As for his companion...
text: McGRATH is a mountain of drunken pus. Six foot, sweating
text: like a Devonshire hog with his tattered, undersized
text: Confederate dress jacket buttoned all the way to the top.
text: His ear has been hacked off and replaced by what looks to
text: be a miniature leather Victrola horn. McGrath smiles at
text: our Soiled Dove and makes a little kissing gesture.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 4/9/99 4.
speaker_heading: 6 CONTINUED: 6
scene_heading: ANGLE ON SOILED DOVE
text: Eyes widened in revulsion. What evil abides in this
text: Godforsaken place? Now a drunkenly EYE-CROSSED REB
text: licks Dora's ear, then whispers something in it.
text: Something unspeakably vile, by Dora's expression.
speaker_heading: DORA
dialog: I'm sorry. That won't be
dialog: possible. I have... tonsillitis.
scene_heading: 7 EXT. WAREHOUSE - WEST'S POV THROUGH KNOTHOLE - NIGHT 7
text: The Rebs load the boxes onto the wagon. We see the wheel
text: of the wagon up against the rotted leg of the water
dialog: tower.
speaker_heading: BIG REB
dialog: Pack'er up good, Virgil. Next stop
dialog: N'Orleans.
scene_heading: 8 INT. WATER TOWER - NIGHT 8
text: West is unaware that she's watching him, not watching
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: SALOON GIRL
dialog: (admonishing)
dialog: Jim!
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Ah, this hole is a safety issue.
dialog: I'm thinking, what if it starts to
text: rain and the water level goes up.
dialog: It could suck you right up. I'm
dialog: protecting you. (variations)
text: Saloon Girl frustrated, has grabbed West's boxer shorts
text: (with little horses on them) and plugs the hole with
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: SALOON GIRL
dialog: Problem solved.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Belle, you don't just ram a man's
text: underbritches into a knothole.
dialog: You wanna plug the hole, you ram
dialog: your own britches in there.
text: West is at a loss. She moves in for another kiss.
scene_heading: WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 4/9/99 4A.
scene_heading: 9 EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 9
text: The HORSES SPOOK as a crate is dropped onto the wagon.
speaker_heading: CLOSE - AXLE
text: caught on the WATER TOWER LEG. It CREAKS.
scene_heading: 10 INT. WATER TOWER - NIGHT 10
text: West hears the CREAK. He breaks the kiss.
speaker_heading: SALOON GIRL
dialog: Oh, Jim.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: (serious)
dialog: Much as I'd like to take credit
dialog: for that you might need to hand
dialog: me my gun...
text: The tower starts to topple.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: ... Hand me my gun.
text: It CRASHES...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 11 EXT. WAREHOUSE SKYLIGHT - NIGHT 11
text: West crashes down into the tarp covering the boxes. The
text: only people more shocked than he is are the guards and
text: the Rebs he just dropped in on. West picks himself up,
text: smiles coolly at the drenched slack-jaws.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Okay, who just made a wish?
dialog: Was it you?
text: He looks up at the freaked-out Saloon Girl, still in the
text: tank. She hangs on with one hand, the other hand
text: clutches his clothes.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: I could sure use those clothes
dialog: now.
text: She responds by Frisbee-ing his hat down. West picks it
text: up, with a look... uses it to cover his genitals.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 4/9/99 4B.
speaker_heading: 11 CONTINUED: 11
speaker_heading: BIG REB
dialog: Well, we got us a shy nig...
text: But he never gets that word out. Bang! West lashes a
text: lightning martial arts kick to the Reb's jaw.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Fought five long years with the
dialog: Union Army not to hear that word
dialog: again. And you boys lost,
dialog: remember?
text: As the other Reb comes at him, he spins, still holding
text: the hat in front of him... and whap! Down that one goes.
text: West looks up at the none-too-bright water tank woman.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: How 'bout some pants!?
text: As she throws the rest of his clothes down in a heap...
dialog: 5.
scene_heading: 12 INT. FAT-CAN'S - NIGHT (SAME TIME) 12
text: General McGrath checks a pocket watch, looks up
text: impatiently at the Indian, Hudson. His eyes drift
dialog: upwards... to the balcony where...
scene_heading: ANGLE ON UPSTAIRS BALCONY - TWO MORE EX-REBS
text: have come up back stairs lugging a heavy steamer trunk.
speaker_heading: McGRATH
text: I'm still waiting on my guns and
dialog: ammo, but I see my men have
dialog: brought your merchandise.
text: McGrath subtly gestures with his eyes to the balcony for
text: Hudson to confirm. Hudson nods.
speaker_heading: McGRATH
dialog: I had expected to be delivering it
dialog: personally to Mr...
text: Hudson quickly cuts him off before he can say the name.
text: The Indian speaks in a very precise King's English.
speaker_heading: HUDSON
dialog: My employer, here in a brothel?
dialog: (a small ironic
dialog: smile)
dialog: That would be quite... redundant.
scene_heading: 13 EXT. STREET - ON CARRIAGE - NIGHT 13
text: MOVE IN ON an elegant brougham driven by a very large,
text: very striking woman in livery.
text: As the carriage passes under the gas lamp, we can make
text: out the top-hatted silhouette of McGrath's "employer,"
text: DR. ARLISS LOVELESS. Clustered around him inside the cab
text: are three more beautiful women. As he strokes the cheek
text: of the ORIENTAL one with the back of his hand like a
dialog: cat...
scene_heading: 14 INT. FAT-CAN'S - McGRATH AND HUDSON - NIGHT 14
speaker_heading: HUDSON
dialog: You'll meet him when the time --
dialog: and place -- are appropriate.
dialog: Now...
dialog: (stands)
dialog: ... shall we go upstairs to check
dialog: the 'merchandise'?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: 14 CONTINUED: 14
speaker_heading: McGRATH
dialog: Frankly, Mr. Hudson, I wasn't
dialog: planning to walk those oaken
dialog: stairs with you. Direct me to the
dialog: poot, sir. Something young and
text: creamy. A gamer that takes to the
dialog: crop and spur.
text: McGrath looks to the singer (Rita), who beats a hasty
text: retreat from him after her song. So, once again, McGrath
text: lays his rheumy eyes on...
scene_heading: ANGLE ON SOILED DOVE
text: She's oblivious, more intrigued by the ex-Rebs on the
text: balcony with the trunk. As she starts for the stairs...
text: a man's hand grabs her. It's the Eye-Crossed Reb again.
speaker_heading: EYE-CROSSED REB
dialog: You drive a hard bargain, lady.
dialog: All right, fifty cents to take
dialog: them big juicy lips and...
speaker_heading: DORA
dialog: Still not interested.
text: She tries to pull away. But the Reb won't let go.
speaker_heading: EYE-CROSSED REB
dialog: But you gotta be interested.
dialog: You're a whore.
text: Suddenly the coquettishness in the eyes becomes rage.
text: The falsetto becomes a baritone growl.
speaker_heading: DORA
dialog: (baritone)
dialog: That doesn't mean a girl can't
dialog: have high standards.
text: Just as the Reb registers the odd new voice... wham! Her
text: corsage springs out and whacks him right in the jaw. The
text: Reb's eyes roll back... and he slumps to the ground.
dialog: Whooa, hoss... the Soiled Dove is a man! He's ARTEMUS
dialog: GORDON and his true profession will be revealed to us
text: shortly. But now, as he/she stashes the unconscious Reb
text: behind the bar, straightens bosom and wig...
scene_heading: 15 INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 15
text: West is trying to get dressed.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: 15 CONTINUED: 15
text: As he pulls on one leg of his pants, a guard lunges at
text: him with a knife. West hops up on one leg, smacks the
text: guy with a mule kick.
text: Now he puts his arm through his shirt sleeve. When the
text: hand emerges out of the cuff, it's balled in a fist --
text: which coldcocks the other guard.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Could I have a little privacy
dialog: here?
text: As if in response, the water tower, still hovering above,
text: now crashes to the floor -- obliterating his opponents.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Thank you.
text: He calmly looks up in time to catch the falling, naked,
text: screaming Saloon Girl in his arms.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: You'll have to excuse me,
dialog: darlin'... but my evidence is
text: getting away.
text: West gallantly puts her down, jumps up, grabs the
text: overhead block and tackle system and slides through the
text: warehouse. As the HORSE TEAM, which has spooked,
text: THUNDERS past...
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - WEST
text: sails onto the runaway wagon. As he pulls himself into
text: the back, he gives the shivering Saloon Girl a tip of his
text: hat -- now on his head.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Sorry about there not being any
dialog: towels.
scene_heading: 16 INT. FAT-CAN'S - NIGHT (SAME TIME) 16
text: General McGrath leers down a line-up of Fat-Can's girls.
text: Just as he gets to the beautiful singer, who looks sick
text: at the thought, suddenly Gordon intrudes. He/she blocks
text: out the singer, poses coquettishly -- sucking a
dialog: lollypop.
speaker_heading: McGRATH
dialog: What's your name, missy?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: 16 CONTINUED: 16
speaker_heading: GORDON/DORA
dialog: (demurely; back to
dialog: his falsetto)
dialog: Dora. Would you like to go
dialog: upstairs?
speaker_heading: McGRATH
dialog: Oh, indeedy I would.
text: Gordon/Dora starts to go as the Eye-Crossed Reb wakes up.
text: He grabs him/her, very pissed.
speaker_heading: EYE-CROSSED REB
dialog: Hey, c'mere! Who the hell are you
dialog: anyway?!
speaker_heading: McGRATH
dialog: She's... mine!
text: Blam! McGrath emphasizes his claim by gut-shooting the
text: Reb. The shot makes Dora/Gordon jump and the room go
text: quiet. As the Reb crumples, McGrath turns back to
text: Gordon/Dora, oddly inspired.
speaker_heading: McGRATH
dialog: I feel like... a ditty!
speaker_heading: GORDON/DORA
dialog: A ditty? But General...
dialog: (trying to be
dialog: coquettish again)
dialog: ... my talents really lay
dialog: elsewhere.
speaker_heading: McGRATH
dialog: Nothing stokes the fire in my
text: loins like a ditty.
text: McGrath hauls him/her over to the piano player.
speaker_heading: McGRATH
dialog: You've got some pretty fair lungs
dialog: on ya, girl, now use 'em!
text: He punctuates with a slap to Gordon/Dora's rump. The
text: other singer (Rita) watches too.
scene_heading: 17 INT. FAT-CAN'S - NIGHT 17
text: Gordon/Dora is sweating. Reluctantly, he/she whispers
text: something to the piano player. He clears his throat and
text: begins singing.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: 17 CONTINUED: 17
speaker_heading: GORDON/DORA

scene_heading: 18 EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - WILD WAGON RIDE - NIGHT 18
text: West spots the contents of an open box. Eyes widen.
scene_heading: CLOSE - BOX - DOZEN GLASS VIALS
text: stuck in sand. But clinking together ominously as the
text: wagon races over the cobblestones.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Backwards-ass bumpkins got a wagon
dialog: full of nitro...!
text: West tries to steady the glass vials with his hands...
text: but it's no use. He quickly climbs over the boxes, onto
text: the buckboard seat. But the reins are dragging on the
text: ground beneath the frothing horses.
text: West leaps onto the horses as the wagon careens down the
text: street. He pulls himself over the first one's neck...
text: onto the next horse. And as he tries for the lead horse,
text: he falls between them!
scene_heading: 19 INT. FAT-CAN'S - NIGHT 19
text: Gordon/Dora singing. He/she struggles through the song
text: in a very tough room.
speaker_heading: GORDON/DORA
dialog: 'And tell them I tried...
dialog: And tell them I cried...'
text: Just when it looks like the stone-faced rowdies might rip
text: him/her apart, McGrath starts tapping a mud-caked toe.
text: Encouraged, Gordon/Dora belts out the next verses OVER...
scene_heading: 20 EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - WILD WAGON RIDE - NIGHT 20
text: West's custom boots drag in the dirt as he's about to be
text: trampled under the hooves of the freaked-out horses. And
text: if he hasn't got enough problems, the lynch pin attaching
text: the team to the wagon has almost worked its way out.
scene_heading: CLOSE - BACK OF WAGON - NITRO VIALS
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: 20 CONTINUED: 20
text: CLANKING together like chimes...
speaker_heading: CLOSE - WEST
text: Straining with every ounce of strength in his body, he
text: pulls himself up by the harness onto...
scene_heading: CLOSE - WILD-EYED LEAD HORSE
text: West grabs for the halter.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Whoa now...!
text: But it doesn't whoa. The wagon goes around a corner up
text: on two wheels! It's about to tilt over when West grabs
text: both the horses' ears, yanks them back -- screaming into
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: I said, whoa!!!
dialog: This approach seems to work.
scene_heading: 21 EXT. RISE ABOVE FAT-CAN'S - NIGHT 21
text: The team comes to an abrupt stop... and with it the wagon
text: hanging over the edge of a steep drop.
text: Jim carefully climbs off. He slaps the dust on his
text: jacket, straightens the crease in his trousers. When he
text: looks up, a bitter smile.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Well, well, this is workin' out to
dialog: be a perfect day. My man...
scene_heading: HIS POV - VICTORIAN BUILDING - ACROSS STREET
text: The tasteful sign under the red light reads: "FAT-CAN

dialog: 11.
scene_heading: 22 INT. FAT-CAN'S - CLOSE - McGRATH 22

speaker_heading: GORDON/CROWD
dialog: (rousing finish)
dialog: And tell them I tried just the
dialog: same...!
text: He/she curtsies to rousing applause. McGrath beams like
text: a man with the fire in his loins roaring. He grabs his
text: little songbird and up the stairs they go.
text: Out the WINDOWS, we see West tracking them. Simul-
text: taneously going up outside steps.
scene_heading: 23 INT. FAT-CAN'S - UPSTAIRS - GORDON/DORA 23
text: leads the sweating, leering General down the hall.
text: He/she quickly opens and closes boudoir doors --
text: ostensibly to find a free room for their assignation.
text: The real agenda is to find the mysterious trunk.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON DOORWAY #1
text: Quick peek. He/she registers a mild reaction of shock.
text: Closes that door and moves on to...
scene_heading: ANGLE ON DOORWAY #2
text: Quick peek. The two rebs sitting on the trunk. At their
text: feet is a wriggling burlap sack. The "merchandise" is alive.
text: Gordon/Dora giggles like a schoolgirl.
speaker_heading: GORDON/DORA
dialog: Well, that's a new one.
text: McGrath slams the door, drags Gordon/Dora roughly...
scene_heading: 24 INT. BOUDOIR - CONTINUOUS ACTION 24
text: Our soiled dove has her back to the door as if steeling
text: herself for the task at hand. McGrath beckons her over
text: to the bed.
speaker_heading: McGRATH
dialog: Don't let the ear scare you. I
dialog: lost it at Chickamauga.

dialog: Would you mind...? I... I...
dialog: can't seem to release the clasp of
dialog: my belt.
text: Say no more. McGrath is on her like a flash, fidgeting
text: with it. But it pops open, revealing a spiraling screen
text: courtesy of Dr. Mesmer. His eyes lock onto it.
speaker_heading: McGRATH
dialog: Wha... what's this?
speaker_heading: GORDON/DORA
dialog: It's a deep, deep pool. Maybe
dialog: your old swimmin' hole. Getting
dialog: sleepy, General?
speaker_heading: McGRATH
dialog: (ga-ga)
dialog: Yes, I'm sleepy.
text: McGrath sits on the floor. Gordon smiles... this is

speaker_heading: GORDON

speaker_heading: McGRATH
dialog: (barks)
dialog: Woof!
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: All right, little doggy. Sit up.
dialog: (as he does)

speaker_heading: McGRATH

speaker_heading: 24 CONTINUED: (2) 24

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Watch the swirling spiral! Lie

speaker_heading: 25 OMITTED 25
scene_heading: 26 INT. FAT-CAN'S - BOUDOIR - GORDON/DORA 26

text: smooth move. West rolls to his feet, fixes a gallant
dialog: smile on Gordon/Dora.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Didn't mean to startle you, ma'am.
dialog: Looked like you could use some
dialog: help.
text: It takes Gordon a moment to recover. He stares at this
text: black Samaritan, obviously having no clue who he is.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: (clears throat to
dialog: recover falsetto)
dialog: Looks can be deceivin'... dark
dialog: stranger. I am perfectly fine.

text: his bag of gold coins.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: I can see that, darlin'. Woman of
dialog: your caliber probably gets top
dialog: dollar, too. So here you go.
dialog: (flips her McGrath's

text: McGrath's rebel yell brings help from all directions.
text: DOORS BANG open all along the hallway. Not just

text: West pushes the monster off of him, rolls as a BULLET
text: SPLINTERS the WOOD where he just was. The SHOT STARTS...
scene_heading: ANGLE - STAMPEDE OF SEMI-CLAD WHORES
text: all screaming hysterically and heading for the exits.

dialog: Gordon.
text: Gordon staggers, drops the perfume/mace BOTTLE which

speaker_heading: LOVELESS

scene_heading: EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

scene_heading: 34 INT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY 34
text: West limps past black floor scrubbers. They stop working

speaker_heading: HOUSE DETECTIVE

speaker_heading: WEST

speaker_heading: WEST

speaker_heading: PRESIDENT GRANT (O.S.)

speaker_heading: PRESIDENT GRANT
dialog: Don't make Captain West any later

speaker_heading: PRESIDENT GRANT
dialog: Of course I know him, he's the

dialog: Nothing will stop him from
dialog: completing a mission for his
dialog: President... except the impulsive
dialog: actions of a headstrong cowboy!

speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT GRANT
dialog: I am the President of the United

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Sir, in perilous times like these,
dialog: I was simply illustrating how

text: Just as Gordon makes his intestinal allusion, West takes

speaker_heading: PRESIDENT GRANT
dialog: You're clever, Gordon. One day

speaker_heading: PRESIDENT GRANT

speaker_heading: WEST

speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: It's McGrath, sir. The South is

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Sir, West's obsession aside,
dialog: McGrath may be a vicious killer,

speaker_heading: WEST

speaker_heading: WEST

dialog: Yee-haaa!!

text: Then, finally ready...
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Avant!!!

text: Gordon engrossed in what he's doing... which appears to
dialog: be sewing.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Stop this train!! You hear me!?!
text: If Gordon hears him, he pretends not to. He just
text: casually makes the next stitch.
text: West's horse has had it. They're losing ground to the
text: train. At the last second, West leans over at full
text: gallop and grabs a handle on the side of the train. He
text: swings out of the saddle, hanging on for dear life,
text: blowing in the breeze like laundry.
text: Finally, his boot finds a small metal plate to put its
text: weight on. Just as West stands safely on it... whoosh!
text: He flies up in the air and drops through a sliding

scene_heading: 40 INT. WANDERER - PARLOR CAR - DAY 40
text: The car is like a classy Victorian men's club. Bar

speaker_heading: GORDON

speaker_heading: WEST

text: West draws his gun, aims it at Gordon's stomach and cocks
dialog: the trigger.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Really?
text: Gordon quickly pulls the vest away from his stomach.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: But it hasn't been really
dialog: tested empirically yet.
speaker_heading: WEST

speaker_heading: GORDON

speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Yeah? How do you feel about a
dialog: fist?
text: Gordon puts down The Impermeable, stands with a weary
dialog: sigh.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I must tell you, Mr. West, I've

dialog: physical violence is a failure on
dialog: my part.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Well then, 'Mr.' Gordon, you

speaker_heading: 40 CONTINUED: (2) 40
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I'm sorry, Mr. West, you brought

text: Then to West's utter amazement, Gordon puts his hands
text: together as if praying while at the same time, crooking
text: his right leg stork-like. Is this some kind of martial
text: art? Then, he bends at the waist, and like a ballet
text: dancer, extends his leg out to the wall and flips a
dialog: switch.
text: It immediately triggers a leather hammer to swing down
text: from the ceiling. It whacks West on the side of the
text: head, and sends him spinning back onto the pool table.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON POOL TABLE - WEST

scene_heading: 60 INT. LOVELESS MANSION - STUDY - WEST - NIGHT 60

text: the crook of his arm.
text: West turns his attention to the desk blotter. There's a

scene_heading: 62 INT. LOVELESS MANSION - STUDY - WEST AND EAST - NIGHT 62

dialog: backwards!
speaker_heading: CLOSE - WEST

speaker_heading: RITA

speaker_heading: GORDON

speaker_heading: LOVELESS
dialog: Now just who are you?
speaker_heading: GORDON/GRANT
dialog: The President.
dialog: (turns to President,
dialog: snorts)
dialog: He's just an actor hired to stand
dialog: in for me on public occasions. A
dialog: very bad actor, I must say... a
text: little puffy and overweight.
text: As the President eyes him, puffs on his cigar,
text: Gordon/Grant apes his every move, bigger, mockingly.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT GRANT
dialog: (aside)
dialog: Gordon, you've got a lot of brass.
dialog: Where's West?
speaker_heading: GORDON

scene_heading: 161 EXT. PROMONTORY POINT - TWO GRANTS - DAY 161
text: Gordon/Grant turns to an Army officer, standing behind.
speaker_heading: GORDON/GRANT
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: Captain, get this man out of my

dialog: real actor!
text: As the bewildered captain starts to lead the President

scene_heading: 162 EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DAY 162
dialog: Loveless has had enough.
speaker_heading: LOVELESS
dialog: Take them both!!!
text: Munitia, manning a sort of cannon, takes a bead on

scene_heading: 163 EXT. PROMONTORY POINT - TWO GRANTS - DAY 163
text: ... and a sticky white silk shoots out covering both

speaker_heading: PRESIDENT GRANT
dialog: Well, Gordon... was this part of
dialog: your plan?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I'm by your side, sir. That's
dialog: what's important.
text: Now Munitia hits a lever and they're hoisted up off the

text: West shoots the mechanism and it jerks to a stop.
text: All eyes turn to the source of the sharpshooting...
scene_heading: 164 EXT. PROMONTORY POINT - TARANTULA LEG - DAY 164

scene_heading: 165 EXT. TARANTULA - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY 165

scene_heading: 173 EXT. PROMONTORY POINT - DUSK 173
text: West's body hasn't moved. The only change is that now
text: a line of ants crawls across his face. We watch, hoping
text: for a twitch, something... But there is none. The ants

dialog: his head. If we're not convinced he's dead...
speaker_heading: ANGLE - VULTURE

scene_heading: EXTREME CLOSEUP - WEST'S EYES
text: A shadow falls across them. But instead of the pecking

scene_heading: WEST'S POV - NAVAJO SHAMAN

dialog: There have been some significant internal changes which

text: There's appreciative laughter.
scene_heading: 175 INT. WANDERER - PARLOR CAR - WEST - SAME TIME 175
text: stumbles in and looks around discouraged.
text: The place has been ransacked. The gun cabinets are
text: empty, the Gatling lamp removed. All that's left is
text: Gordon's Nitro-cycle and his wardrobe full of dresses.
text: West tries every secret hiding place. Nothing. Finally
text: he finds Gordon's belt buckle/derringer. He opens the
text: breech. Only one dinky bullet. He throws down the belt
dialog: in disgust.
scene_heading: 176 INT. LOVELESS'S LAIR - AMPHITHEATER - LOVELESS - DUSK 176
text: sits behind a desk that has been brought to center stage.
text: Loveless unrolls a document, signs his half of it.
speaker_heading: LOVELESS
dialog: My partner nations insist that we
dialog: make this as legal as possible.
dialog: Personally, I like the symmetry of
dialog: it. After all wasn't it you who
dialog: made us sign a surrender at
dialog: Appomattox?
text: Loveless snaps his fingers. Amazonia drags Grant out of

speaker_heading: PRESIDENT GRANT
dialog: Never will I sign that paper,

speaker_heading: 176 CONTINUED: 176
speaker_heading: LOVELESS
dialog: Well, sir, we're at loggerheads

text: Grant sets his jaw intractably. He's right about that.
speaker_heading: LOVELESS
dialog: ... so, if you still refuse to
dialog: sign this surrender... we'll start
dialog: by shooting your man, Gordon.
text: Loveless whirls, nods to Amazonia who drags the President

text: help her outburst.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Artemus!
text: Artemus smiles at her, extremely brave under the

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: (tugs at his vest)
dialog: Don't worry, I'm wearing the
dialog: Impermeable.
text: Rita turns to Grant. What the hell is that? Gordon has
text: no time to explain as Amazonia hauls him up on the stage.
text: As Munitia aims her rifle... Gordon holds up a finger.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: If I may have one request... it's
dialog: that she aim at my heart... which
dialog: has loved this great country so
dialog: much!
speaker_heading: LOVELESS
dialog: (considers for a moment)
text: Shoot him in the head.
speaker_heading: GORDON

dialog: 97.
scene_heading: 177 INT. LOVELESS'S LAIR - AMPHITHEATER - DUSK 177
text: A candle-powered spotlight swings across the stage and
text: illuminates... a deep-throated, bluesy black CHANTEUSE
text: who starts singing the popular cathouse song, "Hangtown
dialog: Gals."
speaker_heading: CHANTEUSE
dialog: (singing)
dialog: 'Ohhh... Hangtown gals are plump
dialog: and rosy...'
text: Loveless wheels his chair around to take a gander and
text: forgets Gordon's execution instantly. And why not?
text: She's young and beautiful in a RuPaul sort of way. About
text: six feet tall, wearing the blue sequined number Gordon
text: had in his dressing room.
text: Accessorized with black mesh stockings, big feather boa,
dialog: silver-buckled belt, lots of frilly petticoats for those
dialog: can-can moves.
speaker_heading: CHANTEUSE
dialog: (singing)
dialog: 'Hair in ringlets, mighty cozy...'
text: She winds her finger around her ringlets and sticks out
text: her derriere to the crowd. They stare, mouths agape at
dialog: this piece of ass worthy of Othello.
scene_heading: CLOSE - LOVELESS
text: Intrigued. Well, maybe more than intrigued.
speaker_heading: LOVELESS
dialog: A new girl! What a nice surprise!
text: He motions to hold up Gordon's execution, rolls to her.
speaker_heading: CHANTEUSE
text: 'Painted cheeks and frilly

dialog: (bends over showing
dialog: her undergarment)
dialog: Touch them...'
text: Loveless hears this as an invitation, reaches out with

speaker_heading: CHANTEUSE
dialog: '... And they'll sting like
dialog: hornets!'
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: 177 CONTINUED: 177

speaker_heading: LOVELESS
dialog: (making her name up
dialog: on the spot)
dialog: Ebonia! Why are you so cruel to
dialog: me?
text: Ebonia has escaped a head-cutting neck bracelet. But she
dialog: probably shouldn't be teasing a man who's having "ghost

speaker_heading: ANGLE - GORDON

dialog: about her for Gordon.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: (musing to himself)
dialog: I have a dress like that.
scene_heading: ANGLE - CHANTEUSE
text: Now with the crowd singing along, she pulls out all the

speaker_heading: CHANTEUSE
dialog: (singing)
dialog: 'Hangtown gals are lovely
dialog: creatures
dialog: Think they'll marry Mormon
dialog: preachers.'
text: She sashays over to the French dignitary, pulls his

text: steaming it up. As she pops it back on his face...
speaker_heading: CHANTEUSE
dialog: (singing)
dialog: 'Heads thrown back to show their
dialog: features...'
text: Now she puts her cheek next to Rita as if matching their
text: relative beauty while picking the pocket of Lippenreider.
text: Rita pushes her away disgustedly but not before Ebonia

speaker_heading: 177 CONTINUED: (2) 177
speaker_heading: COLEMAN

dialog: "I'd rather be dead" partner, Jim West.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Ha... Ha... Hangtown girls...
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Not to sound ungrateful, but you're

speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: (sings)
dialog: Ha... Ha... Ha...
text: West/Ebonia wraps the feather boa around Gordon's neck --
text: hiding the derringer in the palm of his hand. Gordon looks
text: worried. What's he going to do with a gun? As he tucks
dialog: it up his sleeve...
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Let me warn you about that
dialog: dress...
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Gotta go. Big finish...
dialog: (belts it out)
dialog: 'Ha, ha, ha! Hangtown gals!!!'

speaker_heading: PRESIDENT GRANT

speaker_heading: COLEMAN

scene_heading: 178 INT. LOVELESS'S LAIR - AMPHITHEATER - DUSK 178
text: Immediately two FLAME THROWERS EXPLODE from his cone-like
text: bosoms.
text: Maybe he should've listened about the dress. He turns to
text: Gordon questioningly, and inadvertently incinerates one of
text: Loveless's goons. He howls in pain, runs panicked...
dialog: right into Rita.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Serves you right for staring at

speaker_heading: LOVELESS
dialog: Kill him!
dialog: (off their confused
dialog: looks, points)
dialog: Him! Him! The girl!
text: Finally getting it, they rush Ebonia. Even his 4th of

text: reaches way down in his undergarments to retrieve one of
text: Gordon's billiard balls. He depresses the number and

speaker_heading: GORDON

speaker_heading: WEST

speaker_heading: RITA

text: Three goons drop. Gordon and West exchange looks.
dialog: Not bad for an emphysemic old engineer.
speaker_heading: COLEMAN
dialog: Special Marshal... President
dialog: thought you needed some lookin'

dialog: Speaking of the President... he's grabbed a dead goon's

speaker_heading: GORDON (O.S.)
dialog: Now Bernoulli's Principle states

dialog: the wing... that's called 'lift.'
dialog: Course, it's just a theory... it's

scene_heading: NEW ANGLE - GORDON'S DRAWING
text: It depicts a wing cutting through the air. Arrows

text: a leather flight jacket and goggles.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: You're not makin' me feel any

text: Now they attach the wing to the frame -- which is

speaker_heading: GORDON

speaker_heading: WEST

speaker_heading: GORDON

speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Hey, uh... that's the cliff over
dialog: there, you know?
text: He guns the accelerator.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Yes, I do know.

scene_heading: 189 EXT. SKY - DESERT WASP (IN FLIGHT) - DUSK 189

speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: But you've got two of those.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Okay, lemme talk to Gordon, I'll
dialog: see if he can...
text: No time for talk. Knife Guy does a bad-ass series of
text: moves. The blades criss-crossing one another at blinding
text: speed. West, unimpressed, retorts with a lame shake of
text: his stiletto and boot.
text: And the fight begins...
text: Knife Guy attacks! West narrowly escapes each thrust of
text: the knife, and attempts a kick to the groin... but comes
text: up short -- The stiletto collides with one of the blades
text: and snaps like a carrot. His only weapon... gone.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Damn.
text: West rolls onto the railing to avoid the attack. Sparks
text: fly as the Knife Guy tries to slice and dice West but
text: misses each time, hitting the metal railing instead.
text: West rolls to the floor, sucking air. Knife Guy lands
text: a kick to West's ribs. And to make matters worse...
speaker_heading: WRENCH GUY
text: just showed up. He swings his wrench at West's head.
text: West ducks but gets kicked in the back. He sails across

speaker_heading: SHOVEL GUY
text: makes an appearance. He hammers his shovel at West's
text: groin, over and over. (West is in a crab position and
text: backs up to avoid this.) West finally gets a kick in
text: -- it does a moderate amount of damage.
text: Wrench Guy appears and swings his huge wrench at West's

text: West punches both of them. Wrench Guy tumbles OUT OF
speaker_heading: FRAME.
text: West stands. Looking for a way out, but... no luck...
text: Shovel Guy attacks. West ducks and the shovel connects
text: squarely with Knife Guy's blades. West crouches and
text: throws two simultaneous punches, each connecting with a
text: set of jewels.
text: West stands, follows it up with a right cross and left
text: hook and these two jokers wind up OUT OF FRAME.
text: Now... the Wrench Guy is on his feet and he's pissed!
text: He attacks West, lands a solid kick to the chest and
text: West flies backward toward a...
speaker_heading: HANGING CHAIN
text: which he grabs. He scales the gears, gets a solid grip,
text: then swings, a huge arc across the room, gaining momentum,
text: and kicks Shovel Guy and Wrench Guy at the same time! Off
text: their feet they go, slamming onto the metal floor.
text: West lands. Knife Guy attacks. West uses the chain to
text: block the blades which are flying at him, left and right.
text: Sparks fly. West manages to wrap the chain around one of
text: the knives, locks it down, and heaves it into the gears...
text: the blade snaps.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: No more Mister Knife guy!
text: West drops a stiff right-cross on the chin of the Knife
text: Guy... wobbles his legs a bit. But before West can follow
dialog: up...
text: ANOTHER BLADE SHOOTS OUT
text: to replace the broken one. It stops about a half-an-inch
text: from West's nose.
text: A struggle ensues, but West manages to wrap the chain
text: around Knife Guy's neck and string him up.
text: West throws a kick to his back... Knife Guy, hanging by
text: his neck, flies through the belly... (the chain is on a
text: track)... and out of the mouth of the beast, down into
dialog: the abyss, chain and all.
text: Shovel Guy springs to his feet and swings on West. West

text: West gains sole possession of the shovel and mule-kicks
text: Shovel Guy OUT OF FRAME. West spins just in time to
text: land a crippling blow to Wrench Guy's back.
text: Shovel Guy grabs the shovel. He and West tug-o'-war again.
text: West ducks under the shovel and moves back-to-front with
text: him. West elbows him in the ribs. He responds by putting
text: West in a choke hold. West swings the shovel wildly but
text: hits his target -- shovel Guy's head!
text: West steps back, gets his footing and, for good measure,
text: whacks him in the back.
text: Wrench Guy attacks. West defends himself with the shovel
text: and lands a stiff kick to his stomach. Wrench Guy goes
dialog: down...
text: West turns, hits Shovel Guy in the chest with the shovel
dialog: and he goes down...
text: Wrench Guy sneaks up on West from behind and swings at
text: his head. West, on instinct, lifts the shovel and blocks

dialog: West has now found his rhythm...
text: He swings and shovel and connects with... first, the
dialog: foot, then the chin, and last but not least, the head --
text: BOINK! West drops the shovel and, World Wrestling
text: Federation style, picks him up and hurls him into the
dialog: space between the gears. We won't see him anymore!
text: West pivots and WHACK!... Shovel Guy plants a neat
text: little roundhouse kick squarely on West's jaw. West
text: backs up and catches another in the stomach. Then...
dialog: Shovel Guy really shows what he's made of...
text: He does a series of jump-kicks, round-houses and fan-
text: kicks into the air. All perfectly timed, all deadly.
speaker_heading: SHOVEL GUY
dialog: I learned that from a Chinaman.
text: West, without missing a beat, steps on the shovel, which

speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: Noooo.

speaker_heading: WRENCH
text: He picks it up and starts swinging! A shot to the body
text: ... PING! Then another... PING! Then another... PINGGGG!

dialog: space.
speaker_heading: LOVELESS
dialog: Weeeeeeeeeest!!!!
dialog: A beat, then...
speaker_heading: ANGLE - CHAIN

text: Grant turns to West and Gordon.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT GRANT

dialog: of an agency whose sole duty is to
dialog: protect the President and the

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Uh, just out of curiosity, sir...
dialog: who's Agent No. 1?
dialog: Grant just shakes his head, some things never change.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT GRANT
dialog: I don't think that matters very
dialog: much, do you? Gordon? Besides,
dialog: you'll have plenty of time to
dialog: discuss it on your new assignment.
dialog: (hands them piece
dialog: of paper)
dialog: See you back in Washington.
text: He snaps off a salute, starts to go as they read it.

text: West and Gordon sit up like dogs.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Rita! You look great.
speaker_heading: GORDON
text: Ravishing, a vision.

speaker_heading: RITA

speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Texas? Why're you going back
dialog: there? Why don't you come with me
dialog: back to Washington?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Or better still, come with me to
dialog: Washington. I could introduce you
dialog: to people I still know in the
dialog: theater...
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: She's not really an entertainer,
dialog: remember?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (intercedes)
dialog: I can't go with either of you.
text: She looks from one crestfallen suitor to the other.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: It's not that you both don't have
dialog: your attributes.
dialog: (to Gordon)
dialog: You're so sophisticated and such a
dialog: wonderful cook.
dialog: (to West)
dialog: Jim, you're good with a gun... and
dialog: have great legs.
dialog: (to both)
dialog: And you're both so brave. But...
dialog: I'm afraid I haven't been
dialog: completely honest with you.
speaker_heading: WEST AND GORDON
dialog: Uh-oh...
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Professor Escobar's not my father.
dialog: He's my husband.

speaker_heading: 216 CONTINUED: (3) 216
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Well, I was going to... but would
dialog: you have really brought me along
dialog: if I said I was married?
dialog: Honestly.
text: Neither West nor Gordon knows what to say.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I didn't think so.
text: She turns and starts to walk away. Stops and smiles.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: At least you still have each
dialog: other.
text: As West and Gordon look at one another...

speaker_heading: WEST (O.S.)
dialog: You know, Arte...
speaker_heading: GORDON (O.S.)
dialog: What's that, Jim?
speaker_heading: WEST (O.S.)
dialog: Maybe Rita's right...
text: Suddenly intruding into the f.g. is a huge metal leg.
text: Then another LEG CLOMPS down... and the Tarantula comes
text: INTO FULL VIEW. As our heroes ride slowly into the
dialog: sunset.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Besides... there's a lot of
dialog: other women in the world.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: That's easy for you to say. She
dialog: didn't walk off with your best
dialog: dress.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
