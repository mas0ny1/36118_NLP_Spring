speaker_heading: LEOPOLD

speaker_heading: STEARNS
dialog: She must be really salty...
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: It's not just the salt. She's got

speaker_heading: STEARNS
dialog: Wait a minute.

dialog: Hawaii.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: -- Shit!
text: He WHIPS THE BINOCULARS back: but all that's left is the

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Hi, I'm Dave Barry. Has something
dialog: like this ever happened to you?
dialog: (bends down to pet
speaker_heading: THE CHIHUAHUA)
dialog: Because if you're a guy - or if you
dialog: know someone who is - then what you've
dialog: just seen should look pretty familiar.
text: He picks up the Chihuahua, starts walking with it.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Scientists call this condition "Lust

speaker_heading: DAVE

speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: But...why?
speaker_heading: HUSBAND

speaker_heading: GUY HUSBAND
speaker_heading: (NODS)

speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: A year ago. By accident.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: Anyway. I thought I was marrying a

dialog: heart, he was a guy.
speaker_heading: DAVE (O.S.)
dialog: When did you first suspect?
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: Not long after the wedding. But it
dialog: didn't bother me. I just didn't

speaker_heading: ALBERT

dialog: were guys. You know?
speaker_heading: DAVE (O.S.)
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: (thinks about it)
dialog: -- The guys were funnier. But the
dialog: men were more responsible. You could
dialog: almost half-believe them when they
dialog: told you something sometimes.
speaker_heading: DAVE (O.S.)
dialog: So, if you were to meet someone that

speaker_heading: DAVE (O.S.)
dialog: In what way?
speaker_heading: HORSE GROOMER

dialog: But I can't bear the uncertainty
dialog: anymore, of where this relationship
dialog: is going.
dialog: Roger turns...
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I'm not asking whether you want to
dialog: get married. Only whether you believe
dialog: that we have some kind of a future
dialog: together. That you, and I - have a
dialog: future.
speaker_heading: JOHN MADDEN
dialog: Now this is just what you want in a
dialog: playoff game. You got snow, you got
dialog: mud, you got a lead that keeps
dialog: changing, you got two great teams
dialog: that just hate each other to the
dialog: bone and would rather die than give
dialog: up...
text: Roger looks...then takes the REMOTE and TURNS OFF THE TV -
text: waving Elaine over, who cuddles into him.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: I've been thinking too, Elaine. And
dialog: for the first time in my life, I'm
dialog: feeling like I might really be close
dialog: to a lasting commitment. I haven't
dialog: said anything up until now because
dialog: it's always been important to me
dialog: that I not mislead you. But yes,
dialog: Elaine. I want to think that we dQ
dialog: have a future. And with a little
dialog: more time, I think I could be sure.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Oh, Roger...
text: He smiles. Strokes her hair and pulls her in even closer.

speaker_heading: PRIMATE GENE

speaker_heading: JOHN MADDEN
dialog: The worst kind, Dave, and in a lotta

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What's the main thing we're looking

speaker_heading: JOHN MADDEN
dialog: Well the crucial thing here, is makin'
dialog: sure there's no eye contact. I mean
dialog: none - zero. These guys'll look up,
dialog: they'll look down, they'll look
dialog: straight ahead -- but a guy would
dialog: rather have you poke both his eyes
text: out with burning hot fire tongs,
dialog: Dave, than to give the next guy over
dialog: a reason to think you might be lookin'
text: at him in a public bathroom. For
dialog: reasons that oughtta be pretty darn
dialog: obvious.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Obvious indeed. Now here comes Guy
dialog: Number Two --
text: The SECOND GUY comes in; John diagrams the call.
speaker_heading: JOHN MADDEN
dialog: Now Guy Number Two, what he's gonna
dialog: do is, he's gonna come in, see the

dialog: and right away he's gonna line up
text: wide on the opposite side. This is
dialog: a best case scenario here, something
dialog: both these guys can appreciate.
dialog: Plus they've opened up the middle
dialog: for the third guy --
text: The THIRD GUY comes in. John diagrams his path to the middle
text: urinal. The Guy goes there.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What about eye contact in this
dialog: situation.
speaker_heading: JOHN MADDEN
dialog: Well you're still not likely to
dialog: encounter any, but again if you do,
dialog: that's what that buffer zone on either
dialog: side of him's for. And all three of
dialog: 'em are feelin' pretty lucky to have
dialog: it, I can tell you that.
speaker_heading: DAVE

speaker_heading: DAVE

speaker_heading: SECRETARY

speaker_heading: SECRETARY

dialog: of course, even by the most basic
dialog: standards, these two are living like
dialog: savages. But they honestly don't
dialog: know this -- because Guys, in their
dialog: natural state, aren't any more aware
dialog: of domestic standards than a trout
dialog: would be aware of the stock market.
dialog: And this causes women a lot of

dialog: Take laundry. To him his clean

dialog: go get them. And they can dry the
text: rest of the way in the drawer. But
dialog: they don't dry the rest of the way
text: in the drawer, they sit there in
text: damp musty unfolded balls and he
dialog: doesn't even mind, and I can't figure
dialog: that out. What is the matter with
dialog: folding something? What is the matter
dialog: with waiting for it to be dry?

scene_heading: INT. DAVE'S CURRENT BEDROOM - DAY
text: Dave unloads a laundry basket on the bed. Starts folding
text: the clean clothes and making piles.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Laundry's a big issue - and a deep
dialog: and puzzling mystery to guys. My
dialog: own wife Michelle, for instance, is
dialog: an accomplished sportswriter and
text: mother of an extremely young child,
text: yet she is still able to maintain a
dialog: vigorous clothes-cleaning regimen
dialog: bordering on the super-human. And

speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: (comes in with more
speaker_heading: CLOTHES)
dialog: He's right.
text: She dumps out the clothes, sees what he's doing and takes

text: a LABEL with lots of printing on it.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: These are clearly secret codes, that
dialog: women intuitively understand but
dialog: cannot adequately explain -- just
dialog: like how a lot of guys understand
dialog: the Infield Fly Rule, without being

text: Dave anchors a semi circle with Sidra, Mia, Karla E and Lila.
text: They take turns focus group style.
speaker_heading: SIDRA
dialog: Sometimes I think they're just like
dialog: tapeworms. You know? I mean
dialog: tapeworms are just tapeworms - that's
dialog: all they are, and all they'll ever
dialog: be. They're just these repulsive
dialog: little parasitic beasts and nobody
dialog: expects anything different from them -
dialog: because people know that's their
dialog: nature. And it's the same way with
dialog: guys - although a tapeworm's more
text: likely to help clean out the garage.
speaker_heading: LILA

speaker_heading: KARLA E
dialog: They sleep with your sister and wonder

speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: They will make a game out of anything.
dialog: A contest out of anything. Give

dialog: figure out some game with it.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: And they'll argue over the rules.
speaker_heading: KARLA E
dialog: (off their agreement)
dialog: They leave their dirty dishes
dialog: everywhere. I can't believe the
dialog: places I'll find some crusted over
text: cereal bowl with yuckola blobs of
dialog: God knows what in them. And the
dialog: thing is, from his point of view?
dialog: They really do get cleaned by magic!
dialog: Because I can't take seeing them sit
dialog: there, so I clean them.
speaker_heading: SIDRA
dialog: (to Karla E)
dialog: I just get him to wash my car when
dialog: that stuff happens.
speaker_heading: KARLA E
dialog: Sweetheart he could wash my car with
dialog: his tongue and it still wouldn't
dialog: make up for where I find those dishes
dialog: sometimes.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (while they commiserate)
dialog: So now that we've heard your thoughts.
dialog: The frustration, the exasperation...
text: the obvious question comes to mind:
dialog: Why go through it? Why have guys in
dialog: your life at all?
text: They look at him.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: -- You mean as a choice? You mean
dialog: like a mature adult choice to have a
dialog: guy in your life? In spite of
dialog: everything?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 93
speaker_heading: SIDRA
dialog: Like trying to borrow money from
dialog: you, after you've broken up, so he
dialog: can buy something for his new
dialog: girlfriend? And wondering what the
dialog: problem was with that? I mean like
dialog: really not knowing?
text: Dave looks at her. They all do. Until --
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: I'll tell you why. There is no good
dialog: reason, that's why.
text: The others turn, look her way.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: -- I mean don't get me wrong. They
dialog: really can be fun. You know, like a
dialog: big stupid dog can be fun. I mean
dialog: not everything has to be so serious
dialog: in life. You want to be able to do
dialog: more with someone than just read
dialog: book reviews together - which is
dialog: something a guy would never do anyway.
dialog: (then as the others
speaker_heading: LISTEN CLOSER)
dialog: But what a guy will do? Is at eleven
dialog: o'clock at night he'll show up at
dialog: your door and bring cheese steaks.
dialog: And he doesn't care that you look
dialog: all rumply and dreadful from not
dialog: expecting anyone. He might not even
dialog: remember that you're a vegetarian
dialog: and don't eat cheese steaks -- but
dialog: that doesn't really matter either.
dialog: Because the point is he wanted one,
dialog: and he can't come out and say it but
dialog: he didn't want to eat it alone.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: And you're the person he thought of.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: (off her look; nods)
dialog: I can't tell you what that feels
dialog: like, when they do that.
dialog: (a beat; and then)
dialog: I swear, if they knew how adorable
dialog: they are sometimes, they'd be
dialog: dangerous. I mean -- more dangerous.
dialog: The other Girls think about that. Considering...

dialog: -- Bullshit. They're tapeworms.

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Well now you know where things stand.
dialog: You've learned a little bit about
dialog: guys, and the critical roles they've
dialog: played in the past and in modern
dialog: society today. And for better or
dialog: worse, they're here with us to stay --
dialog: so the best thing you can do about
dialog: it, is continue to learn about them -
dialog: by coming to see this movie lots and
dialog: lots of times, and bringing more and
dialog: more of your friends back every time
dialog: you do. Because the more people
