speaker_heading: DANNY (V.O.)
dialog: My name is Tom Van Allen ...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: or Danny Flynne ...
text: A DUFFLE BAG FULL OF MONEY ON THE BED. The money burning, tiny flaming

speaker_heading: DANNY (cont'd)
dialog: ... I don't know anymore.

speaker_heading: KUJO
dialog: So the alphabet, I mean look at it,

speaker_heading: DANNY (cont'd)

speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You don't find that repugnant?
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Just the way the world works. Look,

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Shut up, Garcetti!
text: Danny turns to Tanner
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: If he finds out it's me, I'm a dead man.
speaker_heading: TANNER

text: Danny paces back and forth.
speaker_heading: TANNER (cont'd)
dialog: And if you're that worried about it,

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: How the hell am I gonna do that? You

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR
dialog: Anything for a dear friend.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: But I just met you.
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR

dialog: think of you as a brother already.
text: Pooh-Bear takes another bite of eggs.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR
dialog: If you say so.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Pooh-Bear, I don't mean to be rude,
dialog: but I get the feeling you aren't
dialog: taking me seriously.
text: Pooh-Bear puts the plate down.
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR
dialog: Maybe you're the one who isn't taking
dialog: me seriously.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Why do you say that?
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR
dialog: I welcome you here with open arms and
dialog: you got the nerve to low-ball me like
text: some slick used car salesman.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Hey, I was just trying to ...
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR
dialog: (never losing his smile)
dialog: I want to tell you about the last guy
dialog: who tried to jam me up on a deal.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Hey, I don't play that.
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR
dialog: I'm sure you don't. At least I'm
dialog: sure you think you don't. Anyway, I
dialog: want to tell you. It's a good story,
text: guaranteed to break the ice at a party.
text: Pooh-Bear leans back, grinning broadly
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
dialog: Dude shorted me eleven dollar ...
dialog: thought I wouldn't count it till I
dialog: got home. Wrong.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You know what I did?
dialog: (beat)
text: I clamped his head in a vice.
text: QUICK FLASH BACK: LOW ANGLE SLOW-MOTION CLOSE-UP of Pooh-Bear staring

speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR (V.O.)
dialog: You should have heard him howling.
text: BACK TO PRESENT: Pooh-Bear lights a cigarette
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR
dialog: Then I took a Saws All and I cut

text: QUICK FLASH: CONTINUE SLOW MOTION CLOSE UP. Pooh-Bear reaching for
text: something OFFSCREEN.
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR (V.O.)
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: You know, those Saws All really do
dialog: cut through everything.
text: BACK TO PRESENT: Danny getting nervous.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Look, you don't have to ...
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
dialog: So I'm standing there looking at this
dialog: dude's brain and I'm thinking to
dialog: myself, you know, this guy doesn't
dialog: really need this thing. I mean,
dialog: anyone stupid enough to jam me up
dialog: doesn't really use their brain to
dialog: begin with. You know what I'm
dialog: saying?
dialog: (beat, dead serious)
dialog: So I took it.
text: Pooh-Bear makes a POPPING SOUND as he illustrates with his hands.
text: QUICK FLASH BACK: Pooh-Bear looking down at SOMETHING in his hand, his

text: BACK TO PRESENT: Danny listens somberly.
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
dialog: Hell, I make better use out of it
dialog: than he ever did. Got it up in my
dialog: freezer. I take it out from time-to-
dialog: time, mix a little of it up in my
dialog: dinner ....
dialog: (looks at the plate of eggs)
dialog: ... of breakfast.
text: ON THE PLATE - little chunks of gray matter mixed in with the eggs.
text: Pooh-Bear smiles knowingly. Danny turns pale.
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR
dialog: 10,000 a pound
dialog: Danny decides to nerve it out
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Now you're insulting me. Nice
dialog: talking business with you.
text: Danny gets up to leave. One of his hands shaking uncontrollably. He
text: steadies it with the other hand.
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR
dialog: 9,000. Take it or leave it.
text: Danny stops.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I'll leave it. Eight is as high as
dialog: I'll go. See ya'.
text: Danny goes to leave again.
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR
dialog: All right, all right. Don't get your
dialog: knickers in a knot. I can live with eight.
text: Pooh-Bear stands up.
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
dialog: You got a deal.
text: They shake hands.
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR
dialog: God damn, Danny, you got some nerve.
dialog: Pooh-Bear respects that.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Oh, by the way ...
text: Pooh-Bear takes something from the kitchen counter and tosses it on the
dialog: table ...
text: ... a store-bought package of COW BRAINS.
text: QUICK FLASH BACK: REVEAL that Pooh-Bear has been standing at the meat

speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR

dialog: Hmm. Good price.
text: Pooh-Bear tosses the package in his cart and walks away, whistling.

speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: KUJO

scene_heading: EXT. CEDARS SINAI - DAY (FLASH FORWARD)

speaker_heading: DANNY (cont'd)

speaker_heading: DANNY (cont'd)
dialog: Why are you out here?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Quincey, my boyfriend... he kicked me out.

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I

speaker_heading: COLETTE

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Leave me out of this.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: That bad, huh?

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Nevertheless, I still try to see

text: He takes a sip.
speaker_heading: DANNY (cont'd)
dialog: Problem is, it's usually half-full of

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Could be worse.

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Don't worry, he's probably passed out

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: This man sounds like a real catch.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Oh, he's a keeper all right.
speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Go ahead.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Look, it's really none of my business
dialog: but why don't you just dump this guy?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: It's not that easy.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Don't tell me, down deep he's really
dialog: not a bad person and you don't want

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce
dialog: Brothers?

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: You don't understand.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: There's nothing to understand.

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I can't leave.
speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: COLETTE (cont'd)

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Why don't you call the cops?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Why? They don't hold him for more
dialog: than a day or two.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: That's long enough to get out of town.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I can't. I've got a kid. She lives
dialog: with my parents. Quincey knows where
dialog: they live.
text: Danny chews it over for a second then ...
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Then make sure he gets put away for longer.
speaker_heading: COLETTE

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: TANNER

speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: You've got no choice.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Whata you mean I've got no choice?
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in
dialog: la casa grande ...
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: For that old possession charge?
dialog: Gimme a break.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: No. You just handed us a new one. We
dialog: can go Federal on your ass right now:
dialog: ongoing criminal conspiracy. Intent
dialog: to buy and distribute $250,000 worth
dialog: of crank. What's the mandatory on
dialog: that, Al?
speaker_heading: GARCETTI
dialog: Dime, minimum.
text: MOVE OFF GARCETTI and over to a wall mounted heating vent. MOVE INTO
dialog: THE VENT, then ...
text: ... OUT OF A VENT in another room.
text: BUBBA lurking in the shadows. Listening to the conversation through the
text: wall vent in the other room.
speaker_heading: TANNER (O.S.)
dialog: And believe me, word will get out that
dialog: you're a pro rat.
speaker_heading: GARCETTI (O.S.)
dialog: That's not good in prison. It's just
dialog: not good.
text: Bubba listens intently.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - NIGHT
text: Danny hunkered down in the back sea. Garcetti sniffing the air.
speaker_heading: GARCETTI
dialog: What's that smell?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: That would be me.
speaker_heading: GARCETTI
dialog: What'd you do, piss your pants?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Hell, yes! What the hell do you expect
dialog: zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?
text: Garcetti looks back at Danny with a twisted smile.
speaker_heading: GARCETTI
dialog: Who'd have thought it? Danny
dialog: "Chickenshit" Flynne trying to go
dialog: large right under our noses.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Lay off, Garcetti. I'm not in the mood.
speaker_heading: GARCETTI
dialog: No. You've got me all wrong. I
dialog: mean, in you own pussified way, you
dialog: actually got some nuts in your little sack.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Bullshit. He's a liar.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: You think you're so god damned smart,
dialog: don't you?
text: The dynamic has suddenly changed in the trio's relationship. Tanner is
dialog: now the bad cop.
speaker_heading: TANNER (cont'd)
dialog: Well, you played the wrong mark this
dialog: time, asshole.
scene_heading: EXT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL - NIGHT
text: Danny approaching the building, we hear shots ...
text: ... THE RED CAR from earlier, prowling the streets. Danny ducks into a
text: liquor store and watches from the window.
text: The red car cruises slowly past.
text: Danny squinting, trying to make out ...
text: ... THE LICENSE PLATE NUMBER. A street light illuminates the tag
text: momentarily. A VANITY PLATE: IFORGIV.
text: Danny frowns, not sure that to make of it.
scene_heading: INT. COLETTE'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Colette and Quincey lying in bed. THE LILTING SOUND of Danny's trumpet
text: wafting in the air.
text: Quincey is fast asleep. Colette lays there, eyes open, listening to
text: the coolly hypnotic strains of Miles Davis' "Generique."
scene_heading: INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - SAME

text: trumpet, staring at the photos of his wife.
scene_heading: INT. COLETTE'S ROOM - SAME

scene_heading: INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - SAME
text: Danny continues playing. He sneaks down a look at ...
text: ... A GREETING CARD on the vanity in front of him. The word,
text: "CONGRATULATIONS" printed on the front.
text: THE FLASHBACK IMGERY appears on the wall behind him again. MOVE from
dialog: Danny to the image as we ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DIRT ROAD - THE HIGH DESERT (FLASHBACK)
text: The car jolting slowly back and forth over the bumpy road.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - SAME

text: AGAIN. REMEMBER, DANNY IS KNOWN AS TOM IN THIS SCENE.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Why didn't you just ask for
dialog: directions back there?
speaker_heading: DANNY/TOM
dialog: Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: You mean like the Donner Party?
speaker_heading: DANNY/TOM
dialog: Hey, do you think you could eat me if
dialog: you had to? And if so, which part do
dialog: you think you would find the most
dialog: delicious?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Tom, quit fucking around.
speaker_heading: DANNY/TOM
dialog: Okay, okay.
dialog: (peering through the windshield)
dialog: There's a house up there. I'll go ask
dialog: for directions.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - SAME

scene_heading: INT. CAR - SAME
text: Liz sees the run-down old house.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: You think that's a good idea?
speaker_heading: DANNY/TOM
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Look at that place. It's creepy.
text: Danny steers the car onto the narrow dirt approach to the house.
speaker_heading: DANNY/TOM
dialog: First you want me to ask for
dialog: directions, then you don't. Which is it?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I wanted you to ask back there. You
dialog: know, before you got us lost.
speaker_heading: DANNY/TOM
dialog: Just no pleasing you, is there?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Just admit you're wrong.
speaker_heading: DANNY/TOM
dialog: We all know how much you like hearing
dialog: that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong.
dialog: There. You happy?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom.
dialog: It gets old.
speaker_heading: DANNY/TOM
dialog: No. You know what gets old? Being
dialog: reminded what a loser you are every
dialog: time you screw up.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Here it comes, poor Tom.
speaker_heading: DANNY/TOM
dialog: But that's okay, Liz, you're the one
dialog: with the steady job, you pay all the
dialog: bills. I'm just an unemployed
dialog: musician. You have every right.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: That is so unfair.
text: Danny stares straight ahead, steering the car towards the house.
speaker_heading: DANNY/TOM
dialog: My sentiments exactly.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Why are you doing this?
text: Danny doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: LIZ (cont'd)
dialog: I never once asked you to stop
dialog: playing. I wouldn't dream of it. So
dialog: don't take your low self-esteem out
dialog: on me.
text: Danny continues to ignore her.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: ... Tom ... screw it. Tell me when you're
text: ready to apologize.
scene_heading: INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: DANNY

dialog: I'm sorry, Liz. I love you and I'm sorry.
text: But the DANNY IN THE IMAGE never answers.
scene_heading: INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: It is raining buckets outside. Danny sleeping soundly.
text: The roof of Danny's room is leaking, PUDDLING UP ON THE FLOOR NEAR HIS
dialog: BED.
text: Danny's eyes pop open. He lays there rigidly. LISTENING TO THE WATER.
text: ALL OTHER SOUND FADES OUT AS THE WATER PATTERS AND PUDDLE ON THE FLOOR.
text: IT IS UNNATURALLY LOUD.
scene_heading: INT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT
text: The bar is almost empty.
text: Danny quietly playing chords on a beat-up old upright piano in the back

speaker_heading: COLETTE (O.S.)
dialog: This seat taken?
text: Danny looks up.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Oh. Hi.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: What happened to your eye?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: By the way, I'm not looking for a
dialog: matching set.
dialog: (off her puzzled look)
dialog: Where's Quincey?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Don't worry. He's out of town.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: How far out of town?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Trust me. We're safe.
text: Colette sits down on the piano bench next to Danny.
speaker_heading: COLETTE (cont'd)
dialog: Please keep playing.
text: He continues. She sits there listening for a few moments.
speaker_heading: COLETTE (cont'd)
dialog: That's nice. What is it?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Miles Davis. "All Blues."
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Never heard of him.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Just a fucked-up guy who played
text: beautiful music.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Like you?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Nah. I'm strictly minor league...
dialog: except for the fucked-up part.
text: Danny continues to play.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Dude played his soul right out the
text: end of the horn. No false notes.
dialog: Always honest.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: And you admire that?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It's the only way to play.
text: Colette slides closer.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Is that how you play?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I try.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: No false notes?
text: She pulls even closer.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: No deep dark secrets?
text: She goes to kiss him. Danny stops playing. Pulls away from her.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (cold and abrupt):
dialog: What are you up to?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What do you want from me, Colette?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I don't want anything. Why are you
dialog: so suspicious?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It gets me through the day.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: You really need to lighten up.
text: She puts her hand on his leg.
speaker_heading: COLETTE (cont'd)
dialog: Just relax.
text: He moves his leg away.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Look, I can't help you with Quincey
dialog: if that's what you're after.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: This has nothing to do with him.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: How much time do you have?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: What is wrong with you?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: How much time do you have?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: You've got a comeback for everything,
dialog: don't you, Danny? You use 'em like
dialog: some sort of shield.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: There you go again. You're nothing
dialog: but false notes.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You don't like the tune, find another
dialog: station.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: What are you hiding, Danny?
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: Therapy session is over.
text: He closes the keyboard cover.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: You think you're the only one down
dialog: here with a sad story?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: No. But I'm the only one with my sad
dialog: story.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And that's how it's gonna stay.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAY

text: beating a pimp to death with an
dialog: electric wheelchair.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: GARCETTI
dialog: Several possession charges, but nothing major.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
speaker_heading: GARCETTI
dialog: They have. But they never found a lab.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: That's because he doesn't have one.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Whata you mean? He told me -
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Guy scores dope and dollar from
text: ripping off other drug dealers. As
dialog: least that's what the word is.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: That's probably what he would have
dialog: done if we hadn't found out about
dialog: your get-rich-quick scheme.
speaker_heading: GARCETTI
dialog: You're lucky, Flynne.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Funny, I don't feel lucky.
speaker_heading: GARCETTI
dialog: We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D..
dialog: We'll have your sorry ass covered.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What if he caps me before you can
dialog: make a move?
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Golly, I hadn't thought of that.
speaker_heading: GARCETTI
dialog: Don't we always take good care of you?
text: Danny doesn't look reassured.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Speaking of which ... you run that license
dialog: plate for me?
speaker_heading: GARCETTI
dialog: You mean the menacing red car?
text: Garcetti and Tanner exchange a smile.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What? Is it bad?
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: I'm afraid so, Danny.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: GARCETTI
dialog: Brace yourself.
text: Danny's eyes dart back and forth between Garcetti and Tanner.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Come on! Who is it? Domingo's boys?
speaker_heading: GARCETTI
dialog: Worse. Much worse.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: A teacher.
text: Garcetti and Tanner break out laughing.
speaker_heading: TANNER
text: Car is registered to a Mrs. Nancy Plummer.
text: Danny reacts to the name, not listening to the rest of what Garcetti
dialog: and Tanner have to say.
speaker_heading: GARCETTI
dialog: She's 57 and she's been teaching
dialog: third grade for the last 33 years.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Now that's scary!
text: Danny lost in thought.
speaker_heading: GARCETTI
dialog: You're paranoid, Flynne. I think
text: that crank is finally starting to get
dialog: the best of you.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: Danny waiting on the corner.
speaker_heading: GARCETTI (V.O.)
dialog: When is the deal going down?
speaker_heading: DANNY (V.O.)
dialog: I'm making the small buy tonight ...
dialog: if I don't get beaten to death with a
dialog: wheelchair or something. If
dialog: everyone is happy, we'll do the big
dialog: deal later in the week.
text: Jimmy's Vega sputters to a stop in front of Danny. Jimmy gets out and
text: hands Danny the keys.
text: ON THE BUMPTER, a hand-made sign. It reads: PULL ME OVER. I DARE YOU!

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You sure you don't want me to go with you?
text: Danny burns rubber.
scene_heading: EXT. POOH-BEAR'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Pooh-Bear, my man. What's up?
text: Pooh-Bear doesn't respond. Continues brushing.
speaker_heading: LITTLE BILL
dialog: He's blue.
speaker_heading: BIG BILL
text: Comin' down from a 10 day ride.
text: Danny closes his eyes. Not what he wanted to hear.
speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR

dialog: Pull your pants down.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I'm sorry?
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR

speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR
dialog: Big Bill.
text: Big Bill pulls a 19th century double-barreled FLINTLOCK PISTOL from his

speaker_heading: BIG BILL
dialog: Argh, matie. I'm a pirate.
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR
dialog: Little Bill
text: Little Bill drops Danny's trousers. Danny about to object when he is
dialog: started into silence.
text: The saturnine Pooh-Bear raises his head, illuminating his face. He
text: isn't wearing his prosthetic nose. A GAPING HOLE WHERE HIS NOSE SHOULD
text: BE. He looks like some obscene human bat.
text: Pooh-Bear holds up the plastic nose he has been cleaning, inspecting it
text: under the light.
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
text: Introduce him to Captain Steubing.
text: He pops his nose back into place, but it goes on crooked.
text: The Bills escort Danny over to the cage. There is A GIGANTIC CRAZED
scene_heading: WEASEL INSIDE.
text: The cage is divided by a large piece of Plexiglas.
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
dialog: You'll have to excuse him, he ain't

text: The weasel is foaming at the mouth.
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
dialog: That and the rabies. Don't make for

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (trying to stay calm)
dialog: Pooh-Bear. come on, man. What is
dialog: this?
dialog: (off Pooh-Bear's silence)
dialog: It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR
dialog: Big Bill
dialog: 
text: Big Bill pushes Danny up to the cage, which comes up to about waist

speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR
dialog: Captain Steubing thinks you might
dialog: work for the police.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What?!
text: Pooh-Bear holds up his hand.
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR
dialog: Don't address me. I didn't make the
dialog: accusation.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Please .. I don't know what you're ...
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR
dialog: Uh-uh-uh ...
text: He points to the cage. Danny looks down at the weasel, which is
text: trying to gnaw through the Plexiglas.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Jesus Christ.
dialog: (to the weasel)
dialog: Um ... I'm not .. Captain Steubing.
dialog: I'm not working for the cops.
text: The weasel continues to gnaw.
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR
dialog: He don't believe you. Big Bill.
speaker_heading: BIG BILL
dialog: Drop your package in the cage.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: My what?
speaker_heading: BIG BILL
dialog: Put your pee-pee through the hole.
text: There is a hole in the top of the cage on the opposite side of the
dialog: Plexiglas from Captain Steubing.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: This is fucking crazy!
text: Big Bill pulls back the hammer on the gun.
speaker_heading: BIG BILL
text: Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Oh fuck ... oh Jesus ...
text: Danny's eyes dart quickly over to Little Bill, who like everyone else,
text: is watching the weasel.
text: Little Bill is wearing a big, filthy pea coat with A LARGE TEAR on the
dialog: side.
text: Danny still hasn't complied with Pooh-Bear's order.
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR
dialog: Shoot him.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Okay! Okay!
text: From behind, we see Danny bend slightly, dropping his privates into the
dialog: cage.
speaker_heading: DANNY (cont'd)
dialog: (eyeing the wild rodent)
dialog: Oh my God ... oh-my-fucking-God ...
text: Danny tries to stay calm, shoots another look at Little Bill who is
text: standing right next to him.
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR
dialog: Now get talkin'
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I didn't fucking do anything! I
dialog: swear to God!
text: Pooh-Bear leans forward and opens the Plexiglas partition about half an
dialog: inch.
text: THE WEASEL bolts for the opening, gnashing its teeth, trying to squirm
dialog: through.
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR
dialog: You got something to tell Captain
dialog: Steubing, you'd better do it now.
text: The weasel squirms and squeals and bangs against the Plexiglas.
text: Danny uses the diversion. He quickly TAKES SOMETHING from him own
text: jacket pocket and SLIPS IT IN THE HOLE IN LITTLE BILL'S JACKET between
text: the coat and the lining.
text: No one notices.
text: Pooh-Bear opens the Plexiglas even more. The weasel is able to get his
text: head through the hole. He bares his filthy teeth.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (rapid-fire)
dialog: Captain Steubing, listen to me.
dialog: You're after the wrong guy. This is
dialog: the fuck you should be talking to.
text: He nods towards Little Bill. Pooh-Bear cocks his head.
speaker_heading: DANNY (cont'd)
dialog: Jimmy told me that Little Bill's been
dialog: shorting Pooh-Bear ... settin' up his
dialog: own stuff on the side.
speaker_heading: LITTLE BILL
dialog: That's a pack of discharge.
text: Danny now makes eye contact with Pooh-Bear, who listens intently.
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: It's true. Jimmy saw him flashing a
dialog: pimp role at a bar the other night ...
dialog: said he was dissin' your ass in front
dialog: of one of your customers.
text: Pooh-Bear rises slowly. Approaches the triumvirate.
text: Danny keeps one eye on ...
text: ... the weasel as it continues its assault on the opening.
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR
dialog: Man'll say a lot of thing when he's
text: sporting weasel food for a pecker.
speaker_heading: LITTLE BILL
dialog: Damn straight.
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR
dialog: Least I can do is check it out though.
text: Pooh-Bear pulls a chrome .45 from his waistband.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Can I pull my dick out now?
text: Pooh-Bear limply aims the .45 at Little Bill.
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
dialog: Big Bill
dialog: 
text: Big Bill pats Little Bill down.
speaker_heading: LITTLE BILL
dialog: (holding up his arms)
dialog: Go ahead. I got nothing to hide.
text: Big Bill checks all of Little Bill's pockets, coming up empty.
text: The weasel has squeezed about a third of the way through the hole.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Can I pull my dick out?
text: Danny, panicked, eyes the hole in the pea coat.
speaker_heading: BIG BILL
dialog: He's clean.
text: Danny can't believe it. But when Little Bill lowers his arms, a big
text: roll of cash protrudes from the hole.
text: Pooh-Bear and Big Bill see it immediately.
speaker_heading: LITTLE BILL
dialog: What?
text: He follows their gaze to the cash.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR
dialog: (eyes on Little Bill)
dialog: Yeah.
text: Danny extracts himself from the cage just as ...
text: ... the weasel bolts through the opening and springs for the hold in
dialog: the cage.

text: Pooh-Bear drops a zip-lock bag of METH on the table.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I ought to just call this whole thing
text: off right now.
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR
dialog: Don't do that. Please. Or I'll kill
dialog: you. Please, Danny.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What the hell was that? Who told you
dialog: I was five-0?
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR
dialog: No one. It was just a test. I need
dialog: to be sure of who I'm dealing with
dialog: from time-to-time.
text: Pooh-Bear nudges the baggie towards Danny.
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
dialog: Take it easy. You passed.
text: Danny hands over the bundle of cash. Pockets the dope.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Did it ever occur to you that someone
dialog: might cop to something they didn't do
dialog: rather than have their balls chewed
dialog: off by a rabid weasel?
speaker_heading: POOH-BEAR
dialog: I'll keep that in mind.

speaker_heading: NANCY

speaker_heading: NANCY (cont'd)
dialog: I know everyone deals with grief in

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Closure? How do you find closure
dialog: when her killers are still running
dialog: around out there?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I found forgiveness in my heart for

dialog: gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Is that what you want me to do? Put

speaker_heading: NANCY

speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Your hatred makes them stronger and
dialog: you weaker.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night
dialog: she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a

speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: How?
text: Verne slams his hand down on the table.
speaker_heading: VERNE
dialog: By not disgracing her memory!
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: VERNE
dialog: You might as well be spitting on her

dialog: conveniently forget that it was drug

text: Verne glares at Danny. No forgiveness in his heart.
speaker_heading: VERNE (cont'd)

text: He shoots Danny in the stomach. Danny slumps to the floor. His
text: cigarette falls out of his mouth and rolls under the bed.
dialog: Colette freaks.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: You said you wouldn't kill him!
text: She tries to go to Danny but Quincey stops her.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: You lied to me!
speaker_heading: QUINCEY
dialog: Oops. My bad.
text: Danny looks at them, confused, a blood stain blossoming on his white
dialog: shirt.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Colette, what happened? Didn't the cops ...
speaker_heading: QUINCEY
dialog: The cops came. But they didn't find
dialog: nothing. Turns out their C.I. game
dialog: 'em some bad information.
text: Quincey holds up the baggie of drugs.
text: Danny looks from Quincey to Colette. Colette looks away.
speaker_heading: QUINCEY (cont'd)
dialog: You fuck with the Mexicali Boys, this
dialog: is what you get, homes.
text: UNDER THE BED - the cigarette smoldering on the carpet.
speaker_heading: QUINCEY (cont'd)
dialog: Domingo thought you might be the one
dialog: who went rat on him.
text: Quincey looks at Colette
speaker_heading: QUINCEY (cont'd)
dialog: So I brought in a rat of my own.
text: Danny looks at Colette, dumbfounded.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You set me up?
speaker_heading: QUINCEY
dialog: Bitch played you like a squeezebox, Romeo.
text: Danny can't help from laughing at the irony. Beads of sweat are
text: forming on his blanched face. He looks at Colette with a wry smile.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You're good, princess. I'll give you that.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Danny, it's not what you think.
text: Danny looks down at his bloody stomach.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I owed them money ... a lot of
dialog: money ... they didn't give me a
dialog: choice. You know how it works. When
dialog: I got to know you, I tried to back
dialog: out ... that's when they did this ...
dialog: (she indicates the bruises)
dialog: But I told them I wouldn't do it .. I
dialog: didn't want to see you get hurt.
text: Danny stares at her, not sure what to believe. He looks over at
dialog: Quincey.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: She selling me a bill, home boy?
text: Quincey shakes his head.
speaker_heading: QUINCEY
dialog: Nah, she ain't lying. She took a
dialog: pretty good beating from you, ace. I
dialog: seen grown men crack after a lot
dialog: less. But not this bitch.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It was very touching.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Then why are we here?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: They threatened to kill my daughter.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I had no choice.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm sorry, Danny.
text: Danny looks at Colette, imagining the awful beating she must have
dialog: taken.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It's okay. It's okay.
text: (Danny touches her face.)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: God damn, you're beautiful.
text: UNDER THE BED - THE CARPET IGNITES. The fire spreads quickly.
speaker_heading: QUINCEY
dialog: Jesus.
text: Quincey grabs her arm.
speaker_heading: QUINCEY (cont'd)
dialog: Let's go.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: No!
text: The drapes go up in flames. Quincey puts the gun to the back of her
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: QUINCEY
dialog: You wanna die here with him or come with me?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Colette, go.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I don't want to leave you.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Your daughter needs you. Go.
text: The fire continues to spread. Colette kisses Danny on the lips.
text: Quincey pulls her away.
text: Collette looks back one last time just as the flames reach the door,
dialog: cutting off any escape.
text: Danny breathing hard. He gets up. Staggers over to the mirror where
text: his trumpet is.
text: He opens the case and takes the trumpet out.
text: He plops down on the bed and BLOWS A FEW NOTES. He stops for a second,
text: a smile on his lips.
text: He starts to play SAETA.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. BURNING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Back to the opening scene. The whole room ablaze. Danny lying on the
text: bed, playing the horn.
speaker_heading: DANNY (V.O.)
dialog: So what is it? Who am I after it's
dialog: all said and done?
text: Pieces of the roof start falling in.
speaker_heading: DANNY (cont'd)
dialog: Tom Van Allen or Danny Flynne?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Avenging angel or plain old Judas?
text: He stops playing.
speaker_heading: DANNY (cont'd)
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: You decide, friend. You decide.
text: He closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: DANNY (cont'd)
dialog: I'm too tired ... so you decide.
text: He drops his trumpet and lays his head back.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: BLACK SCREEN
text: THEN BLURRY, VAGUE SLOW MOTION - moving through the flames.
text: CLOSE ON DANNY'S HEAD - seemingly floating through the fiery room.
speaker_heading: DANNY (V.O.)
dialog: Oh shit. What is this?
text: Emerging from the flames into a dark hallway.
text: Danny's eyes flutter as he seemingly continues to float.
speaker_heading: DANNY (cont'd)
dialog: Am I dead?
text: A linoleum floor rushes underneath.
speaker_heading: DANNY (cont'd)
dialog: Linoleum. This must be hell.
text: Danny head sags, finds himself staring at ...
text: ... A TATTOED LIKENESS OF HIMSELF. The tattoo smiles and speaks.
speaker_heading: TATTO
dialog: (warped, distorted)
dialog: Hang in there buddy.
text: Stairs rush by underneath. Then another hallway.
text: DANNY'S P.O.V. - a bright white light at the end of the hall.
speaker_heading: DANNY (cont'd)
dialog: Oh no. What a fucking cliché.
text: On Danny's face, floating through the hall. His eyes fluttering.
text: MOVING TOWARDS the light. Closer. Closer.
text: Danny's eyes close, his head droops.
scene_heading: FADE TO WHITE:
text: CLOSE ON DANNY as his eyes flutter and open.
text: DANNY'S P.O.V. - an image slowly coming into focus ...
text: ... JIMMY staring down at him with concern.
text: Danny blinks his eyes again. Looks up at ...
text: ... A PARAMEDIC working on him.
text: Danny smiles a weak smile at Jimmy.
text: Jimmy just sits there, nodding his head, a big shit-eating grin on his
dialog: face.
text: The paramedic continues to work on Danny. His eyes slowly close.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. THE CITY - DAY
text: Danny exits a cab and heads towards a coffee shop. He looks like a new
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: DANNY (V.O.)
dialog: Well, I've had some time to think
dialog: about it and it's pretty simple after
dialog: all. I guess it's like the man said -
dialog: "Man is the measure of all things."
dialog: I should know. I ran the gamut.
dialog: Avenging Angel, Judas, loving
dialog: husband, prodigal son, prince of
dialog: Denmark. I was all of those things.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Tom Van Allen got his revenge.
dialog: Good for Tom. And Danny Flynne? He
dialog: got gut-shot for being the low-life
dialog: rat that he was. Sucks for him.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But as far as I'm concerned, they're both dead.
text: Danny looks through the window of the shop.
text: Colette inside, working the counter, pouring coffee.
speaker_heading: DANNY (cont'd)
dialog: But what about this guy? Who is he?
text: Danny enters the shop.
speaker_heading: DANNY (cont'd)
dialog: To tell you the truth, I don't know yet.
scene_heading: INT. COFFE SHOP - SAME
text: Danny takes a seat at the counter. Colette turns and sees him.
speaker_heading: DANNY (cont'd)
dialog: But I like his chances.
text: They stare at one another for a beat, then smile. Colette pours him
dialog: some coffee.
speaker_heading: DANNY (cont'd)
dialog: I really like his chances.
dialog: They strike up a conversation as we ...
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: THE END
