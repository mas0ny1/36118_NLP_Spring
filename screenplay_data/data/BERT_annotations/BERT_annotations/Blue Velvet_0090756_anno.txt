dialog: There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on,

dialog: I heard some of the same names.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Do you know who was brought in for
dialog: questioning?
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: There were at least three, maybe four. But

speaker_heading: JEFFREY

speaker_heading: SANDY

dialog: They've had her under surveillance for a

dialog: There are opportunities in life for gaining

dialog: Now, how are you going to do that?
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Right out in the car I happen to have some

dialog: will then jimmy a window.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: What will I say when she comes to the door?
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a

speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: I don't know. it sounds like a good
dialog: daydream, . but actually doing it is too
dialog: weird. too dangerous.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Let's just try the first part. If that
dialog: goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one

dialog: almost full. Jeffrey and Sandy are taking it all in.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: (to Waiter)
dialog: When does Dorothy Vallens come on?
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: (flustered; overworked)
dialog: I don't know. pretty soon. Who knows.
dialog: After the Waiter leaves,
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: That guy was filled with information.
dialog: They pour their beers.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: (raising his glass)
dialog: Here's to. an interesting experience.
speaker_heading: SANDY

text: Later. Jeffrey and Sandy have just finished dinner. The M.C. is arranging
text: a floral art deco microphone and a SAXOPHONE PLAYER, a BASS PLAYER, and a
speaker_heading: DRUMMER are on stage.
dialog: M.C.
dialog: (very low key)
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen. The Blue Lady.
dialog: Miss Dorothy Vallens.
dialog: There is quite a round of applause, even though most people continue
text: laughing, talking, and drinking. Dorothy Vallens comes out on stage.
text: She smiles. The house lights are still up. As she sings the first lines
text: of "BLUE MOON" the house lights go down and a blue spot light comes up on
dialog: her as she sings the word, "Blue." This is a very sexy and slow version of
dialog: the song.
dialog: During the song, Jeffrey and Sandy look at one another with the thought
dialog: that this is the woman whose apartment they are about to break into.
text: Jeffrey and Sandy leave as Dorothy starts her next song, "BLUE VELVET."
text: They hear the first few lines before they get out the door.
speaker_heading: 78. EXT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT
text: They hurry to the car, get in, and drive off.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: 79. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR - NIGHT
dialog: Jeffrey and Sandy drive through dark areas of the city. They don't talk
text: as they drive, but again they sneak glances at one another.
scene_heading: 80. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT
text: They turn in to the street where Dorothy Vallens lives and glide to a stop
text: close to the building. Jeffery cuts the engine.
dialog: It is very quiet. Both are looking around to see if anyone is out or
text: watching. Jeffrey tries to look up out the front windshield to the
text: Seventh Floor. It is dark. Sandy moves. Every tiny sound is heard.
text: Sandy looks at Jeffrey for some time, then back at the building.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I
dialog: shouldn't have told you.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: It'll be okay. I don't think you should
dialog: wait out here though. I think you should
dialog: go home. Can you drive this car?
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Yeah. but.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Leave it in the front of your house for me.
dialog: okay?
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: O.K.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Could you wait a little while. this key may
dialog: not fit.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: . I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't
dialog: make any sense. Let's go somewhere and
dialog: have some coffee.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow
dialog: and tell you how it went.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: I. I don't want to see you tomorrow.
dialog: Mike's coming over.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Oh, okay. can I call?
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Okay. yeah, call.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Look. it can wait till Sunday.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope
dialog: you can sneak out okay. You're going to
dialog: wait until she's asleep?
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: I'm going to wait here until she comes.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and
dialog: know she's on her way up. Okay?
dialog: Jeffrey nods.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Okay. thanks.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: I don't know if you're a detective or a
dialog: pervert.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: That's for me to know and for you to find
dialog: out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Okay, okay. Bye.
text: Jeffrey gets out of the car and shuts the door. He looks in one more time
text: at Sandy. They stare at each other silently.
text: Jeffrey can see her lips in the black darkness of the car. Sandy watches
text: him cross the lawn and go into the apartment building. She slides over and
text: sits in the driver's seat.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 81. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Jeffrey hurries up the stairs to the Seventh Floor.
text: SOMEONE comes out of an apartment just as Jeffrey gets to the Seventh Floor.
text: He goes up another flight of stairs to the Eighth Floor and waits until
dialog: the man goes downstairs.
text: Jeffrey then goes back to the Seventh Floor and goes to Door 710.
text: He takes out the key and looks around. No one. He inserts the key.
text: It fits. He turns it. The door opens.
scene_heading: 82. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: He quickly enters the very dark apartment and shuts the door. It takes a
text: moment for his eyes to adjust to the darkness. Soon he finds his way
text: around. He decides on the closet to hide in. However before he goes in
text: to the closet he slowly surveys the apartment as well as he can in the
text: darkness. He goes down the hallway to the back bedroom.
text: Across the hallway he opens another door and is surprised to find an empty
text: child's room. In the child's room he sees a small pointed hat with a
dialog: propeller on top. The kind that plays music when the propeller turns.
text: The hat is sitting silently on the bed post. He quietly closes the door.
text: He returns to the closet. Once inside, he checks out how much he can see.
text: Through the slats he has a view of half the apartment. This is where he
text: will stay. He moves around some to relax. He takes several deep breaths.
dialog: He looks at his watch. It says "10:17."
scene_heading: 83. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT
text: Sandy sits in the car, carefully watching the apartment building and
dialog: street.
scene_heading: 84. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: In the closet, Jeffrey shakes his shoulders and moves around some to
dialog: stretch his muscles which are getting tired. Again, he takes several
text: deep breaths. He looks at his watch - it says 12:45.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Oh no, hurry up Dorothy. Come on!. and I
dialog: gotta pee. Great. it's now or never.
text: Jeffrey sneaks out of the closet and makes his way across the bedroom to
text: the door of the bathroom. His foot hits the door and it makes a loud
dialog: noise. He freezes.
scene_heading: 85. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: He moves again into the bathroom. He starts to pee.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Heineken.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 86. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT
dialog: Suddenly Sandy sits up alert.
scene_heading: 87. EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
text: A car drives up and a MAN helps Dorothy Vallens get out. They walk into
dialog: the building.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 88. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
dialog: Jeffrey instinctively has flushed the toilet and because everything else
dialog: is so quiet the water SOUNDS seem very loud.
scene_heading: 89. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT
dialog: Sandy begins to honk the horn.
scene_heading: 90. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Unable to hear the warning horn, Jeffrey nonchalantly leaves the bathroom
dialog: as the tank is still filling.
text: SUDDENLY, he hears something. a key going in the door. He bolts toward
text: the closet. He flies inside it and is swinging the door shut as the front
dialog: door opens.
text: Just as suddenly, the toilet tank gets full and the water shuts off -
text: SILENCE, except for Dorothy Vallens at the front door.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY (V.O.)
dialog: (we're watching Jeffrey trying to
dialog: control frightened breathing in
dialog: the dark closet)
dialog: Thanks Jimmy, see you tomorrow. You want a
dialog: drink, or something?
speaker_heading: JIMMY (V.O.)
dialog: I better get back. thanks anyway.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Goodnight.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Goodnight now.
text: The front door shuts and the living room lights go on. Jeffrey can see
text: Dorothy come toward him. She walks RIGHT UP, almost to his face, when
speaker_heading: the phone RINGS.
text: She turns immediately and goes to answer it. Jeffrey almost passes out.
dialog: He thought he'd had it. He overhears.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: Hello. yes. yes sir, Frank. Let me
dialog: talk to him. Please Frank, sir. I like
dialog: to sing Blue Velvet. Don? It's okay.
dialog: Don't worry. Don??. can you hear me?
dialog: Is little Donny OK? Is he there? Don? You
dialog: mean Meadow Lane? Frank?! What's the
dialog: matter with him? I know. When? Okay. In
dialog: an hour. I'll be sweet. Momma loves you.
dialog: Okay Frank, sir.
text: She hangs up the phone hard and puts her head in her hands.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (to herself)
dialog: Frank, you son of a bitch!
text: She goes and sits down and starts chewing a fingernail. She nervously
text: gets up again and looks at a framed photograph for a moment then hides
text: the photograph under a pillow on the couch. She puts on a record, "FOR
text: YOUR PRECIOUS LOVE." She sits back down and chews her nail again,
text: listening to the MUSIC; she starts to cry. She stops herself and takes
text: the record off. She starts taking off her stocking. She then takes off
dialog: her dress.
text: Underneath, she has on a bra and panties. She crosses the living room,
dialog: goes down the hallway into the bathroom.
text: Jeffrey can't see her too well now. She takes off her panties in the
text: bathroom. She is now naked. She looks at herself in the mirror. We see
text: Jeffrey's face as he watches her. She disappears from view completely and
dialog: we HEAR her start a SHOWER.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 91. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Jeffrey's face. He sees Dorothy - in a towel - come toward him again.
text: He quickly moves back into the closet as far as he can.
text: She opens the door, reaches in and gets a blue velvet robe. She doesn't
text: see Jeffrey even though he isn't well hidden. She closes the door. It
speaker_heading: CLICKS shut.
text: Jeffrey is in almost total darkness. He listens. He can HEAR WALKING
text: around, then silence. He hears the kitchen sink WATER RUNNING.
text: He HEARS her WALKING AGAIN. Now he can see her. She sits down on her
text: bed. She looks up. Just as Jeffrey shifts his weight. She looks at the
text: closet strangely, but then calmly picks up a book and thumbs through it.
dialog: She slowly gets up.
text: Jeffrey doesn't know what is up. He looks but she walks out of view.
text: SUDDENLY, he hears a DRAWER OPEN, and just as suddenly, the CLOSET DOOR
text: FLIES OPEN, and there she is with a pistol pointed right at him. When
text: she realizes that SOMEONE IS REALLY THERE, she SCREAMS ONCE, very loud.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (crazy scream, then)
dialog: GET OUT OF THERE!! GET OUT!! Put your
dialog: hands up, on your head. GO ON!! Get down
dialog: on your knees - DO IT!! What are you
dialog: doing? Who are you? What's your name?.
speaker_heading: WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Jeffrey.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Jeffrey nothing.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.
dialog: (reads his license)
dialog: Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in
dialog: my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: I wanted to see you.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Nobody.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Shit. You better tell me something.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: I was. an experiment. Just to see if
dialog: I could do it.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: I sprayed your apartment. I took your key.
dialog: I really didn't mean to do anything but
dialog: see you.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: (scared, nervous)
dialog: . I saw you come in, talk on the phone.
dialog: get undressed.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: The phone. What did you hear on the phone
dialog: . Tell me. Word for word.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: (trying to remember)
dialog: You said hello. to Frank. You wanted to
dialog: talk to someone?. Don?. and little Donny.
dialog: You said something about Momma loves you.
dialog: and something about a Meadow Lane.
dialog: something in an hour. I don't remember
dialog: any more.
text: Dorothy stares at Jeffrey studying him for some time thinking.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: That's right. That's what I said. You
dialog: have a good memory. Then what?
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Well.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
speaker_heading: THEN WHAT?
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Then you got undressed.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: How many times have you sneaked into girls'
dialog: apartments and watched them undress?
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: (quietly; feeling guilty)
dialog: Never before this.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: How'd you like it if someone sneaked into
dialog: your house and watched you.
dialog: (gets an idea)
dialog: Get undressed. I want to see you.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: No. Come on.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I
dialog: want to see you.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: No way.
text: Dorothy moves to the kitchen counter and gets a knife. She goes to
text: Jeffrey. Now she has a knife and a gun. He's scared.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Get undressed. I want to see you.
text: Jeffrey begins to undress. First he takes off his shoes and socks,
text: Then his shirt. He undoes his belt and unzips his pants and takes them
text: off. Now he is only in his underwear.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
speaker_heading: STAND UP.
dialog: He does.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Come closer.
text: Dorothy has a strange look on her face. She reaches out and pulls
text: Jeffrey's underpants down to his knees. She looks at him.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: What do you want from me?
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: (quietly, getting very hot)
dialog: I . I don't know.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: What do you want?
text: Dorothy is getting very DREAMY and begins to talk in a childlike voice.
text: She opens her robe and pulls Jeffrey to her breasts.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Don't move. don't look at me.
text: Jeffrey's eyes close with nervous ecstasy as Dorothy begins touching him.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Do you like that?
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Yes.
dialog: He tries to touch her.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Don't move or I'll kill you.
dialog: She looks at him.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Do you like talk like that?
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Lie down on the bed.
text: He lies down. He looks frightened.
text: There's a KNOCK, KNOCK on the door. Dorothy looks VERY frightened. She
text: quickly moves a finger to her lips in a "quiet" sign and whispers to
dialog: Jeffrey.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (whispers, frantic)
dialog: Shut up. Hurry! Go in the closet. Don't
dialog: say anything or you'll get killed. I mean
dialog: it.
text: KNOCKING is heard louder at the door. Jeffrey picks up all his clothes
text: and gets in the closet. He's naked and hiding in the closet. Dorothy
text: closes her robe and glides to the front door.
dialog: Jeffrey sees FRANK come in.
text: Frank is medium height and stocky with a burr hair cut. He is wearing a
text: tight blue t-shirt and an old black sports jacket. He's got on a pair of
dialog: blue jeans and boots. He has a raw, mean sexuality - a "bomb about to go
dialog: off" - presence.
text: He comes into the room slowly, always looking at Dorothy. He sits on the
dialog: couch.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Hello, baby.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (annoyed, condescending)
dialog: Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Hello, daddy.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (can't-you-remember-
dialog: anything-attitude)
dialog: . my bourbon.
text: Dorothy goes into the kitchen to get Frank his drink. As she passes the
text: closet, Jeffrey can see the fear in her face.
text: She returns with a small glass of bourbon and hands it to Frank. Frank
dialog: sips on it.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: . sit down. get your chair.
text: Dorothy brings a small chair over from the wall and sits down. She
dialog: adjusts her robe.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (studying her)
dialog: . spread your legs.
text: Dorothy slowly spreads her legs. She can see Jeffrey staring out of the
dialog: darkness of the closet at her.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: wider.
text: She opens her legs wider. Frank looks at her crotch and drinks his
text: bourbon. He stares at the floor for a moment, then slowly looks back at
dialog: Dorothy, her body - her crotch.
text: Dorothy looks up at the ceiling, waiting. Frank suddenly reaches to his
text: belt, where he has a small canister and a mask. He opens a valve on the
text: canister and places the mask over his nose and mouth. The canister is
text: filled with helium, which makes Frank's voice very high and strange
dialog: sounding. The result is frightening.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (high voice)
dialog: . mommy.
text: Dorothy jumps. She keeps looking at the ceiling.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing, with high voice)
speaker_heading: . MOMMY!.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (frightened)
dialog: . mommy's here.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (high voice)
dialog: Baby wants to fuck.
text: Then, Frank's voice goes to normal.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (normal voice, but loud - like
dialog: an army order to himself)
dialog: GET READY TO FUCK!
text: Frank goes to Dorothy and kneels down in front of her. He takes one more
dialog: gasp of helium.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (high voice)
dialog: Baby wants blue velvet.
text: Dorothy opens her robe and gives a part of the robe to Frank.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Okay.
dialog: Frank slowly moves
text: Frank slowly moves his mouth to the robe and runs his lips along the
dialog: texture of the velvet. His hands rub the velvet and feel Dorothy's body
text: underneath. His hands start feeling her breasts as he sucks and bites the
dialog: velvet robe.
text: Dorothy is very frightened but she is getting hot in spite of her fear.
text: Then Frank, in a sort of sickening way, pulls Dorothy down to rug. He
dialog: warns her.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Don't look at me!
text: He begins stuffing part of the robe into her mouth. Then, he pushes her
dialog: arms back and she keeps them back, letting Frank have his way. Frank
text: sucks and bites the velvet coming out of her mouth, while he pinches and
text: feels her breasts in a strange, compulsive, timidly sickening way.
text: Dorothy is moaning. Frank is breathing very heavily. He feels her crotch.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Don't look at me!!!
dialog: (heavy breathing)
dialog: Daddy's home.
text: He starts stuffing the robe in his mouth now and he gets on top of Dorothy.
text: He starts humping her and pulling her nude body up and down him. Faster
text: and faster, then he has a climax in his pants. Dorothy's head is falling
text: back. She can see Jeffrey blurred in the distance - in the closet.
text: Cautiously, she looks sideways at Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Don't look at me!!!
text: He slugs her in the face. His nose is running and he's stifling sobs from
text: deep within him. On his hands and knees, he moves away. The robe pulls
text: out of his mouth. His breathing is even heavier now. He stands and
text: begins to move around the apartment. He goes to a wall, turns off the
text: lights, then turns and walks into the bathroom, all the while breathing
text: big, heavy breaths, trying to stop the crying. Dorothy moans softly.
text: It gets very quiet and still for a moment. Then, Jeffrey hears Frank
text: with his high helium voice talking to himself in the bathroom. The high,
text: strange sound reverberates in the distance. Jeffrey can't make it out -
text: soon, he hears Frank's high laughing. Frank comes back into the living
text: room. The mask is around his face. All his breathing - every sound is
text: high . He laughs a little and crosses the darkened room to the door.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Stay alive baby. See you next Christmas!
text: Frank leaves and shuts the door. The apartment is silent except for
dialog: Dorothy's moans.
text: Jeffrey is stunned. He doesn't move. He watches Dorothy in the
text: half-light. She rolls over and starts crying. The crying is deep and
dialog: genuine.
text: Slowly, Jeffrey emerges from the closet and goes to her. He bends down
text: and touches her. She flinches and turns to see him. She turns back
text: sobbing. He tries to get her up.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Why don't you come lie down. Come on, I'll
dialog: help you.
text: She struggles up with Jeffrey's help and he takes her over to the bed.
text: She falls down on her side, turned toward the wall. He covers her with
dialog: the sheet.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Don't.
dialog: (referring to the sheet)
dialog: I don't like that. What do you want?
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Nothing. Are you alright?
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Sure I'm alright.
dialog: (she starts crying again)
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: I'll go then.
text: He starts to put on his underwear. They're inside out. He tries to turn
dialog: them around.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Don?
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me.
dialog: Please.
text: Jeffrey turns to her. He studies her. He reaches out and takes her
text: shoulders. He moves down and holds her.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Thank you. honey.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: It's okay. It's okay.
dialog: They lie together for a long silent moment.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Do you like the way I feel?
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: See my breasts? . See?
dialog: Jeffrey looks.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: See my nipples?
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: You can kiss them if you want. Fell them
dialog: . They're getting hard.
text: Jeffrey starts to move closer. Dorothy closes her eyes.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Go ahead. I don't mind.
text: Jeffrey can't help himself. He licks and sucks her nipples and feels her
dialog: breasts. They both are getting very hot.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Feel me.
text: Jeffrey is all over her now. Dorothy suddenly seems to recognize him.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: You can hit me, if you want to.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: No. please. I won't.
text: Dorothy arches back and whining she throws her head back hard against the
dialog: wall.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Stop it!
text: She moves and won't let him feel her anymore. She holds his hands away.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Do you like me?
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Yes, I like you.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: You can be my special friend and come and
dialog: put that in me.
text: They start making love. Suddenly, Dorothy starts crying.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: What's the matter?
text: Suddenly Dorothy slaps Jeffrey in the face. very hard.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Get off me.
text: Jeffrey gets off her, pressing his hand to his face. Dorothy goes into
text: the bathroom crying all the way. Jeffrey sits, confused.
text: Suddenly Jeffrey hears a horrible scream from Dorothy. A true scream of
text: horror. He rushes into the bathroom to see what is wrong.
scene_heading: 92. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: She is just flushing something down the toilet. The water SOUND rushes.
text: He turns to her. She is trembling and in a state of shock.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: I made it go down the toilet.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: What?
text: He looks in the swirling water. It looks like an ear revolving around and
dialog: around then whatever it is disappears.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: I made it go down the toilet.
text: Jeffrey looks up. he sees written with a bar of soap the words "look down"
dialog: on the mirror.
text: He looks down into the sink. At the bottom he sees a small clot of blood
dialog: and a smear of fresher blood.
text: Jeffrey suddenly remembers mentally Frank's high helium voice reverberating
dialog: in the bathroom.

dialog: left a present for Dorothy? What was it?
dialog: An ear? Another ear?!!
dialog: (out loud, to Dorothy)
dialog: What was it?
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (strangely - extremely frightened
dialog: now that Jeffrey may have left it)
dialog: Do you know?
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (breathing heavily, strangely)
dialog: You don't?
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: No. What is happening?
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Maybe you don't know. I know you though.
dialog: You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where
dialog: you live and I know ways to get you and I
dialog: know ways to kill you.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Please don't talk like that. You're upset.
dialog: I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I
dialog: did. I better go.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Go then. I can't let you put it in me now
dialog: but I want you. I like you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Then don't talk about killing.

dialog: (she leans close)
dialog: I want to die.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Don't say that.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day

dialog: now.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: (frightened by her craziness)
dialog: O.K.
text: He takes another look at the blood in the bottom of the sink. He takes
dialog: another look at the beautiful dark troubled eyes of Dorothy Vallens, and
text: turns, goes through the hall to the living room. He crosses slowly to the
text: door, suddenly he turns back and enters the hallway going down to the
text: bathroom. He stops and looks at Dorothy who is turned away from him.
text: She stares into the sink. Jeffrey notices that a square of fabric has
dialog: been cut from the bottom of her blue velvet robe
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: I'm leaving now.
dialog: She is whispering something to herself.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (very faint whisper)
dialog: Help me. help me. please help me.
dialog: Jeffrey doesn't know what he can do.
scene_heading: 96. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Jeffrey turns back, goes through the living room. He looks around and
text: sees the empty bourbon glass of Frank's. Suddenly he remembers the
text: photograph that Dorothy hid. He picks up the pillow and sees a picture
text: of a smiling man and a small boy standing next to him wearing a pointed
text: hat with a propeller. He turns the photo over and finds an old marriage
dialog: license. It reads: Dorothy Vallens to Don.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY (V.O.)
dialog: Don. Oh my God.
text: He hides the photo again. He sees Dorothy's telephone. He memorizes the
text: number - moving his lips with each digit. He goes to the front door and
dialog: opens it quietly.
scene_heading: 97. EXT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
text: He looks out into the hall. It's empty.
scene_heading: 97A. INT. HALLWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
text: He quickly goes to the back stairway and down the stairs. These steps are
text: cement and his feet make echoing sounds which seem very loud. He goes
dialog: through a door marked "EXIT".
scene_heading: 98. EXT. LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT
text: . and comes out, crosses a lawn and goes out onto the sidewalk.
text: He walks along taking in deep cleansing breaths. He looks at his watch.
text: 2:30. He feels so confused, exhilarated, so uneasy. He secretly worries
dialog: about what he's gotten into.
scene_heading: 99. INT. BEAUMONTS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Jeffrey enters the house. THE CAMERA RUSHES along the rug in the dark to a
text: foot. The lights come on. PAN UP the leg to Mrs. Beaumont waiting in a
dialog: chair, staring.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: (startled)
dialog: God. you scared me.
speaker_heading: MRS. BEAUMONT
dialog: Is something wrong? What's happened to
dialog: your face?
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Nothing. I'm fine.
speaker_heading: MRS. BEAUMONT
dialog: You can't just stay out half the night and

text: Jeffrey hangs up the phone hard. He shakes his head.
scene_heading: 101. INT. BEAUMONTS' HARDWARE STORE - DAY
text: Jeffrey's drinking a cup of coffee behind the counter in the store.
text: He thinks. He takes another drink of coffee and sets the cup down.
text: He clasps his hands behind his back and begins pacing up and down.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: (to himself, out loud)
dialog: How can I help her? I can't tell her to go
dialog: to Detective Williams. She'll think I'm a
dialog: policeman. She has my address. She can go
dialog: there. if she has to. I'll tell her. and
dialog: her. and she thinks I'm Don. her husband?
dialog: Where the hell is Don? - maybe he died.
dialog: Jeffrey dials the phone.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Hello?. Mrs. Williams?. This is Jeffrey
dialog: Beaumont. Fine. Okay. Is Sandy there?
dialog: Okay. Hi Sandy. Can you talk? He is?.
dialog: Well, I guess I'll talk to you later on.

dialog: Dinner?. Tomorrow night? Seven o'clock,
dialog: yeah, sounds good. Okay. he's still in

scene_heading: 102. INT. HOSPITAL LABORATORY - DAY
dialog: The searching, mysterious MUSIC plays over while,
text: A DOCTOR is looking at various blood samples under a powerful microscope.
speaker_heading: Various sophisticated gadgets are seen in CLOSEUPS.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY (V.O.)
dialog: This is what my father's disease looks like?
speaker_heading: DR. GYNDE
dialog: Yes.
text: The BLOOD is seen in CLOSEUP. Cells are moving.
dialog: The Doctor makes a change in magnification. The cells are huge - then,
dialog: even bigger. They are so big we can hear them moving.
speaker_heading: 103. EXT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT
text: The parking lot is half-full. A strong wind is blowing trash around.
dialog: Jeffrey parks his car.
speaker_heading: 104. INT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT
dialog: . and enters the club. He speaks to the Maitre d'.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: A table in back, please.
speaker_heading: MAITRE D'
dialog: Certainly
dialog: Dorothy is singing her opening song as the Maitre d' seats Jeffrey.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: I'll have an ice-cold Heineken.
speaker_heading: MAITRE D'
dialog: One Heineken, certainly, sir.
dialog: Jeffrey surveys the place after the Maitre d' leaves. It is very dark and
text: smoky inside. He has trouble seeing, but suddenly he spots Frank sitting
text: with some other GUYS watching Dorothy sing. They are sitting two tables
dialog: away.
dialog: Frank is totally captivated by Dorothy's singing and is very serious-
text: looking. He looks right up to her eyes. In his hand he works a small
dialog: piece of blue velvet cloth with his fingers. Again her first number,
dialog: "BLUE MOON," segues into "BLUE VELVET." This song she sings mainly to
text: Frank. When it is over Frank continues watching Dorothy and everyone else
dialog: applauds loudly.
text: Jeffrey drinks up his Heineken and goes back outside.
speaker_heading: EXT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT
text: He looks around at all the cars but none stand out as Frank's. He gets
text: into his car and pulls out across the street, re-parks the car and waits.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
speaker_heading: 106. EXT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT
text: Traffic roars past Jeffrey and in the distance several people exit the
dialog: SLOW CLUB. Among them are Frank and his friends. They get into a black
text: Ford Fairlane and drive out of the parking lot - down the highway.
text: Jeffrey starts his engine and moves out after them. He has to gun the car
dialog: up to sixty-five to catch up with them.
scene_heading: 107. EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT
dialog: The mysterious MUSIC plays.
text: He follows them to an intersection where they turn off to the right.
text: He waits at a light right behind them. Inside they are lighting
text: cigarettes. The light turns green and Frank takes off. Jeffrey follows
text: them through a dark area down by the docks. He follows them up a narrow
dialog: street through dark factories.
scene_heading: 108. EXT. FRONT STREET - NIGHT
dialog: Dark, low MUSIC now.
text: Up ahead, Frank parks his car. Jeffrey quickly pulls over and kills his
text: lights and engine. He watches Frank and his friends enter an old apartment
text: building next to a bookbinding factory. They disappear within. The
dialog: electric lines above buzz loudly.
text: Jeffrey gets out of his car and walks up the deserted street. He reaches
text: Frank's car which is making popping and clicking NOISES as it cools down.
text: He looks at the license plates - walks a few paces ahead and then writes it
text: down in his notebook. He continues on to the apartment building.
scene_heading: 109. 	INT. LOBBY - FRANK'S BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Inside he looks at the names on the mailboxes. He sees a name - Frank
dialog: Booth. The name gives him the chills. The apartment number is 26.
text: In the distance, he hears footsteps. He quickly leaves.
scene_heading: 110. EXT. FRONT STREET - NIGHT
text: . and crosses the street down to his car. He gets in and waits. Frank
text: comes out of the building and crosses to his car.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY

dialog: Jeffrey goes back to his car to wait.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 114. EXT. DINER PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: A storm is building. There is a roar of thunder as Frank slams his car
text: door as he gets in. His mouth twists into a smile as he guns the engine
text: and leaves. Jeffrey waits till Frank is safely gone.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: (thinking out loud)
dialog: I shouldn't go in. I shouldn't. but I'm
dialog: too curious. and I have to try to help her.
text: He then gets out of his car as the wind is building.
speaker_heading: 115. EXT. VACANT FIELD - NIGHT

scene_heading: 116. EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
dialog: . to Dorothy's building.
scene_heading: 117. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
text: He goes up to the seventh floor and knocks twice on 710. A moment passes,
text: then the door flies open.

speaker_heading: LOOKS BAD.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY

speaker_heading: JEFFREY

speaker_heading: DOROTHY

speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: I'm alright. go hide. This won't
dialog: take long. Be quiet.
text: Jeffrey gets in the closet and Dorothy closes the door. She holds her
text: head collecting her fragile self. Dorothy goes to the door and opens it.
dialog: It's the Man with the Yellow Sports Coat - tonight he's wearing a purple
text: sports coat and light blue double knit pants. His eyes are glazed and his

speaker_heading: YELLOW MAN

speaker_heading: JEFFREY

dialog: Nice guy. Who's he?
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Who's it, you mean.
text: SUDDENLY, Dorothy starts to shake and cry.

speaker_heading: JEFFREY

speaker_heading: DOROTHY

text: The storm is closer and the dark clouds move violently in front of a full

dialog: wind.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: (as she stares down)
dialog: Look.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: (turning to her quickly)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY

speaker_heading: DOROTHY

speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: No. I should go.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Please. please stay.
text: She makes him kiss her. he really likes it. Once again, Jeffrey and
dialog: Dorothy get VERY HOT. Dorothy and Jeffrey lie down on the roof. Dorothy
text: cries out suddenly and bangs her head hard again and again against the
dialog: roof.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Why Dorothy?
text: We move very close to Jeffrey's ear as Dorothy's lips come up and whisper
dialog: into it.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Don? I have to make it hurt. I want

text: Now Dorothy's apartment building at night. A very low angle looking up
text: to the roof. Suddenly a pinpoint of red appears coming toward us from

text: In EXTREME CLOSEUP we see a termite walking by her shoe on the thick
dialog: carpet. Then in EXTREME CLOSEUP we see Aunt Barbara's fingers pinch the

speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: These are beautiful. How's the case

speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Why do you do it?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

speaker_heading: SANDY

dialog: . in the dream the world was dark because
dialog: there weren't any robins. you know, birds.
dialog: robins stood for love. and all of a sudden
dialog: thousands of robins flew down and brought
dialog: this blinding light of love. and it felt
dialog: like that love would be the only thing that

speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Yeah I guess so.

text: door. He gets his key out and inserts it. Turns it. With a loud click

text: he moves closer to a hideous sight. Standing in the middle of Dorothy's
dialog: apartment is T.R. Gordon, the Yellow Man. He is in an extreme state of
text: shock. He is bleeding badly from a huge wound at the top left of his head. His eyes focused on something only his twisted inner mind see. Sitting in one of Dorothy's chairs is a dead man with no ears. only half-healed bloody wounds at each side of his head. A bullet hole in the center of his forehead. The T.V. is crushed in but it is turned on and it is the television that produces the high electrical whine. Jeffrey moves forward again and kicks the television cord out of the wall. The high whine stops instantly. Silence except for the Yellow Man's labored breathing.
text: Suddenly there is a loud "radio voice" coming from the Yellow Man's police
text: radio which is turned "on" in his jacket pocket. Jeffrey's heart leaps
text: and just as suddenly the Yellow Man throws his arms out wildly knocking a
text: floor lamp to the ground and crushing out its light. Jeffrey's heart goes
text: wild at this sight and he jumps back but the Yellow Man is silent and
dialog: motionless again. The radio talks again.

speaker_heading: FRANK (V.O.)
dialog: (helium voice)

He smiles - he slowly goes right toward Jeffrey - smiling. Jeffrey points the pistol. His finger moves to the trigger. He squints his eyes. He doesn't want to kill a man. any man. Frank comes right to the closet door and throws it open, when Jeffrey hears Sandy scream.
