scene_heading: EXT. THE BAIRD SCHOOL - WILTON, NEW HAMPSHIRE - “MORNING 1
text: A New England prep school straddling the prettiest section of
text: town, a chapel and belfry commanding a grassy quadrangle
text: surrounded by ivy-covered classroom structures and the marble
text: arches of an administration building.
text: The great black iron bell in the belfry RINGS, the SCRAPING of
text: wooden chairs against wooden floors, doors rocket open and the
text: cream of adolescent America pours forth onto the gravel paths
text: intersecting the lawn: these youths are the future of the
dialog: nation’s banking, law and medicine, perhaps even The White
text: House, all draped in versions of oxford cloth and tweed and gray
text: flannel, tight knots of ties overlapping the thick fuzz of
text: crewnecks.
scene_heading: INT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - MORNING 2
text: The mid-morning crush at the students’ mailboxes, a noisy place
text: with combination locks being spun open and slammed shut, the
text: racket blunted by the steady march of delinquent students up
text: worn marble steps leading to the Dean’s and Bursar’s offices.
text: However, downstairs there is the happy activity of the
text: mid-morning break, clusters of gossipers, the excitement of
text: plans being hatched. Nearby hangs a bulletin board, decorated
text: with plastic turkeys. Standing in front of it, a good-looking
text: kid whose cut-rate haircut and J.c. Penney coat-and-tie don’t
text: fit in with the Preppie platoons. His name is CHARLIE SIMMS,
text: 17, and he is scanning the sparse entries under "Student Aid,
dialog: Jobs, Thanksgiving Weekend".
scene_heading: EXT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - MORNING 3 |
text: A_new maroon Jaguar pulls into the #1 parking spot. Out steps
text: DEAN TRASK, an avuncular man in his 50’s, the obligatory
text: schoolmaster’s cozy bow tie and blue blazer, however the face
text: bears more the flinty expression of a labor negotiator or
dialog: baseball front office man.
text: Observing Trask from in front of the Administration Building,
text: another group of students, HARRY HAVEMEYER, 18, a
text: born-to-the-purple prep school prince, GEORGE WILLIS, 17,
text: Harry’s consort, and two aides of Harry’s, TRENT and JIMMY.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Will you look at this?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I can’t believe it, they really gave
dialog: it to hin.
speaker_heading: HARRY “
text: Now he’s a loser with a Jaguar.
text: Dean Trask locks the car, gives it a last, cherishing look and
text: heads for the Administration Building. Harry breaks off from
text: his cohorts and angles across the yard to cut him off. é
speaker_heading: HARRY (contd)
dialog: Dean Trask!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: Good morning, Havemeyer.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Good morning, sir. Fabulous.
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: What’s fabulous?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That’s some piece of steel you got.
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: You don’t think I deserve it?
text: Harry holds the door open for Dean Trask as he enters the
dialog: Administration Building.
scene_heading: INT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - DAY
text: Harry pursues Trask as he moves down the lobby.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: ...No sir, I think it’s great. Why
dialog: should the head of Baird be
dialog: putt-putting around in some junker?
dialog: I think the Board of Trustees have had
dialog: their first stroke of inspiration in
dialog: some time.
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: Well thank you, Havemeyer, I’11 take
dialog: that at face value.
text: Leaving Harry behind, Trask enters his office where he is
text: greeted by MRS. HUNSAKER, 55, his no-nonsense, New England
text: secretary. She has four delinquents waiting in chairs in front
text: of her, their pink Dean’s slips balled up in sweaty palms.
text: Trask passes by.
speaker_heading: TRASK (contd)
dialog: Good morning, Mrs. Hunsaker.
dialog: (to the boys)
dialog: What have we here, Murderers’ Row?
text: He chuckles, delighted by his own turn of phrase, and enters his
dialog: inner office.
text: Across the lobby Harry, withdrawing an envelope from his
text: mailbox, meets up with his followers, Georges Trent and Jimny,
text: who have joined him inside. Charlie is still at the bulletin
dialog: board.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What was all that?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Nothing.
dialog: e
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: C’mon, Harry --
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Nothing. Just saying hello. I always
dialog: enjoy saying hello to Dean Trask.
text: Harry opens the envelope, smiles.
speaker_heading: HARRY (contd)
dialog: Sugarbush. Lift tickets and condo
dialog: vouchers.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I thought we were going to Stowe.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Sugarbush is Stowe, Jimmy.
dialog: 
text: A bell RINGS, the lobby starts to clear but Charlie continues
dialog: to examine the job opportunities.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: ...We’re doing it right, Thanksgiving
dialog: in Vermont, Christmas in Switzerland --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Christmas in Guh-staad is going to
dialog: cost us --
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Staad, the ‘G’ is silent. George?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: ‘Staad.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Trent?
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: ‘Staad.
text: Harry turns back to Jimmy.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: So what about ‘Staad?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: The ‘G’ may be silent but it costs
dialog: three G’s to get there. I’11 have to
dialog: talk to my father.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Better yet, why doesn’t my father talk
dialog: to your father. :
dialog: to class.
dialog: 
text: Behind them, Charlie is having difficulty concentrating on the
text: listings as the snobbish, but good-natured, dispute continues.
text: The bell rings again, the lobby empties as students hurry out
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - DAY
text: Charlie bumps into Harry and George as they all squeeze out the
text: door, Jimmy and Trent following close behind as the group
text: proceeds up a narrow path of the grassy quadrangle.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (to Charlie)
dialog: You going home this weekend?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Going home to fucking Idaho for
dialog: Thanksgiving?

dialog: I’m from Oregon.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I meant fucking Oregon.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (to Charlie)
dialog: How do you feel about skiing? In the
text: mood for the white-bosomed slopes of
dialog: Vermont?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Umm --
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: We got a deal going, kid. 20% off for
dialog: my friends. My dad arranged it.
dialog: Christmas in Switzerland --

dialog: Easter in Bermuda. Then, Kentucky
dialog: Derby weekend. We could work you in,
dialog: son.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: How much are the \‘white-bosomed slopes
dialog: of Vermont’?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARRY
text: Twelve hundred dollars. Included is
dialog: a nine-course champagne Thanksgiving
dialog: dinner.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Twelve hundred dollars is a little
dialog: rich for my blood, Harry.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: How short are you?
text: Charlie smiles.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: How short, Harry? So short it
dialog: wouldn’t be worth the trouble for you
dialog: and George to measure. But thanks for
dialog: asking.
text: Charlie breaks off, heads for class.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (to Harry)
dialog: What’d you do that for? You know he’s
dialog: on Aid --
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: On major holidays, Willis, it is
dialog: customary for the lord of the manor
dialog: to offer drippings to the poor.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN OF WILTON - DAY
text: Past the mill, across the river, above the noisy waterworks
text: there is a blue-collar section, frame houses dark with soot.
text: Charlie unfolds the squares of the piece of paper on which he
text: copied down an address from the bulletin board. He checks a
text: number, heads up the sidewalk, rings the bell. KAREN ROSSI, 26,
text: answers, two children squeezed against her legs and pulling at
text: the seams of her jeans, FRANCINE, 4, blonde bangs, a mischievous
text: smile and very dangerous, and WILLIE, 2, who does what Francine
dialog: tells hin.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Mrs. Rossi..?
text: Karen looks Charlie up and down, he again checks his slip of
text: paper against the plastic dry wall numbers beside the door,
text: Karen smiles ingratiatingly.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (contd) ~
dialog: 16 Water Street -- ? I’m here about
dialog: the weekend job?

scene_heading: INT. ROSSI HOUSE - DAY
text: Karen shows Charlie inside, Francine and Willie still clinging
dialog: to her.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Get out of the way, Francie --
speaker_heading: FRANCINE
dialog: Has he got pimples? He hates pimples.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Quiet!
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Pimples! Yay!
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Shush.
dialog: (to Charlie)
dialog: I’m sorry, the School gave me your
dialog: name but I’ve forgotten it.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Charlie. Charlie Simms.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: How are you, Charlie?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Fine, thanks.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Right this way...
text: Charlie follows Karen as she picks her way down a dark hall
text: littered with toys and a stroller, past an adult work bench,
text: through a kitchen in deep activity with pots working on the
dialog: stove.
speaker_heading: KAREN (contd)
dialog: You’re available for the whole
dialog: weekend?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Not going home for Thanksgiving?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No. *
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Good.
text: She opens the back door, tired wooden steps lead down to a yard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAREN (contd)
dialog: -- They put him in a Veterans’ Home
dialog: but he hated it. I told my dad we’d
dialog: take him --
scene_heading: EXT. REAR, ROSSI HOUSE - DAY
text: Karen leads Charlie across the yard towards a small dark
text: cottage, an unexpected outcropping in this cramped yard.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: -- Before you go in, do you mind my
dialog: telling you a few things? Don’t ‘sir’
dialog: him, don’t light his cigars, and if
text: he staggers a little when he stands
dialog: up, don’t pay any attention.
text: Charlie stops now, stares at the cottage’s dark windows. Karen
text: smiles, trying to displace Charlie’s sudden caution.
speaker_heading: KAREN (contd)
dialog: Charlie, I can tell right away you’re
dialog: the right person for the job. And
dialog: Uncle Frank’s going to like you, too.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Where are you going to be this
dialog: weekend?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: We’re driving to Albany. Donny -- my
dialog: husband -- he’s got family there.
text: Karen reaches down for a cat who bounds out of a pet door at the
text: bottom of the cottage’s entrance, she knocks, then calls inside.
speaker_heading: KAREN (contd)
dialog: Do you want Tommy in or out?!
text: The briefest of silences, then a powerful VOICE:
speaker_heading: COLONEL SLADE (V.0.)
dialog: LEAVE HIM OUT!
text: Charlie flinches.
speaker_heading: COLONEL SLADE (V.0.) (contd)
text: He’s chasing that calico ginch from
dialog: the tract houses!
text: Karen, gently tossing the cat out into the yard, senses
text: Charlie’s hesitation.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: (to Charlie)
text: Down deep, the man is a lump of sugar.
dialog: 
text: Karen gives Charlie a reassuring nod, and the gentlest of
text: pushes. He enters the cottage, the door closes quietly behind
text: him. Through the silence, Charlie hears the burblings of
text: children as Karen, heading back across the yard to her house, is.
text: joined by Francine and Willie.
speaker_heading: FRANCINE (V.0.)
dialog: He’s going to hate hin.
speaker_heading: WILLIE (V.0.)
dialog: Pimples!
scene_heading: INT. SLADE’S COTTAGE - DAY
text: Semi-darkness but as the eyes become accustomed, objects start
text: to come into view. Charlie taps on the door frame.
speaker_heading: > CHARLIE
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: SLADE (V.0.)
dialog: Don’t call me ‘sir!’
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Sorry, I mean, mister -- sir --
speaker_heading: SLADE (V.0.)
dialog: What are you, a moron?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, mister, that is --
text: Charlie unfolds the squares of paper again, pores over it for
text: help, glances back at Karen’s house but she has disappeared
dialog: inside.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (contd)
dialog: Lieutenant, yes sir, Lieutenant -- ?
speaker_heading: SLADE (V.0.)
dialog: Lieutenant Colonel! Twenty-six years
dialog: on the line, no one ever busted me
dialog: four grades before. Get in here, you
dialog: idiot
text: Charlie steps inside, through the crepuscular light the only
text: objects Charlie can discern are some cat food and a bowl of
text: water at the bottom of a bulging bookcase. Coming into view
text: now, a blanket on the wall stitched in black, gray and gold
text: which reads "U.S.M.A. 1965", team and military unit photographs,
text: a picture of the dismissed General MacArthur waving to the
text: crowds on 5th Avenue from the back of an open car.
text: Through the silence and darkness, a man becomes visible, planted
text: in an armchair in the midst of this dormitory room/Bachelor
scene_heading: Officers Quarters. His name is FRANK SLADE, LT. COLONEL (U.S.A.
dialog: ret.).
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: Come closer, I want to get a better
dialog: look at you.
text: Charlie moves in closer and now, as Slade raises his head to
text: sniff the air, Charlie can make him out better.
text: Slade is blind, still the man cuts a remarkable figure. In his
text: late-forties, he wears a coat and tie, a pair of jodhpur boots,
text: his chin is chiselled, his posture erect, not an ounce of fat,
text: his neck swiveling slightly as he brings Charlie into his radar,
text: both eyes staring blankly, crow’s feet around the corners of
text: them which prove, on closer examination, to be scars.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: How is your skin?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: My skin, sir?
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: For chrissake!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: -- I don’t know, Mister --
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: ‘Frank!’ Call me Frank! Or Mr.
dialog: Slade. Or if you must, Colonel!
text: Slade bangs the oversized silver oak leaf mounted on burnished
text: wood beside him, the plaque slashing into the table. He pinches
text: the end of a cigar, reaches for a Zippo lighter and begins the
text: hit-and-miss business of lighting it. Charlie unconsciously
text: aids him with body English until the flame makes contact, then
text: Slade reaches for a mean bottle of whiskey beside him, splashes
text: the whiskey into a glass with such a vengeance that some of the
text: dark liquid flies up onto his fingers, he waggles them at
text: Charlie and the drops flicker onto Charlie’s nose.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: Simms, Charles, a Senior. You on
dialog: Student Aid, Simms?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yes, I an.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: For ‘Student Aid’ read ‘crook.’ Your
text: father peddles car telephones at a
dialog: 300% markup and your mother works on
text: heavy commission in a camera store. ~
dialog: (taps his ashes)
dialog: Graduated to it from espresso
dialog: machines.
text: Charlie is at a loss.
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: What are you, dying of some wasting
dialog: disease? .
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I’m right here, sir.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: I know exactly where your body is.
dialog: What I’m looking for 1s some
dialog: indication of a brain. Too much
dialog: football without your helmet?
dialog: (cackles)
text: Lyndon’s line on Jerry Ford. Deputy
dialog: Debriefer, Paris Peace Talks, ‘68.
text: Shave-tail, snagged a Silver Star,
dialog: threw me into G-2. How old are you?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: 17.
text: Slade sniffs.
speaker_heading: SLADE
text: Smells more like 18.
dialog: (smiles lasciviously)
dialog: Get down last night?
text: The cat pops back through the pet door, crosses to his food.
text: Slade senses him, fondly angles his head towards him.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: The old ass man didn’t quite get his
dialog: ashes hauled. You can tell when he
text: comes back hungry. Like a woman whose
dialog: brains you’ve just fucked out and she
dialog: asks you for a cigarette. Where you
dialog: from?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Gresham, Oregon.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: So what does your father do in
dialog: Gresham, Oregon, count wood chips?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: My stepfather and my mom run a
dialog: convenience store.
speaker_heading: SLADE -
dialog: 7-Eleven, Arco, Allsup’s?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It’s an independent.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: What time they open?
dialog: 
dialog: 11
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: DONNY
dialog: Hi, Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hello. I don’t know, Mrs. Rossi --
dialog: I got the feeling I screwed up.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You couldn’t have.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: -- It was a bad interview.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: That was no interview, Charlie, you’re
dialog: it. You’re the only one who showed
dialog: up. And you've got to take the job.
dialog: He sleeps a lot, you can watch
dialog: television, call your girlfriend, I
dialog: promise you, an easy three hundred
dialog: bucks.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I don’t get an ‘easy’ feeling.
speaker_heading: KAREN
text: His bark is worse than his bite. The
dialog: man grows on you. By Sunday night,
dialog: you'll be best friends.
text: Charlie blinks.
speaker_heading: KAREN (contd)
dialog: Charlie, please -- I want to get away
dialog: with my husband for a few days -- and
dialog: Uncle Frank won’t come with us. I
dialog: could practically leave him alone --
dialog: I just feel better having someone
dialog: around. Just in case. Please --
dialog: vu
text: Donny turns around now from the bathtub, looks pleadingly at
text: Charlie... Karen does, too. Together, they wait for his
text: decision. Finally, Charlie smiles reticently.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Okay, Mrs. Rossi. Sure.
text: Karen smiles gratefully at Charlie, turns back to the bathtub,
text: Francine scoops some suds off her chest, throws them at Charlie
text: as he backs out.
scene_heading: EXT. ROSSI HOUSE - DUSK 11
text: Charlie exits, shoves his hands into his back pockets, regards
text: the whole, scruffy Rossi compound, now hurries off into the
dialog: twilight and The Baird School.
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Five AM.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Close?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: One AM.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Hard workers, you got me all
dialog: misty-eyed. So, what are you doing
dialog: in this sparrow-fart town?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I attend Baird.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: ‘Attend’ Baird? I know you go to The
dialog: Baird School. The point is how do you
dialog: afford it, even with Student Aid plus
text: the folks back home hustling the Corn
dialog: Nuts?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I won a National Merit Scholarship.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Hoo-rah.
text: There is a tapping at a window pane of the door which opens onto
text: the yard. Francine is there.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: Who’s that?!
text: Francine rattles her fingers on the glass, sticks her tongue
text: out, makes a crazy face at Charlie.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: Is that that little piece of tail?!
dialog: Get her out of here!
text: He hurls a rubber mouse at the door, it slams against the
text: window, falls to the floor, little bells ring gently. Slade
text: tilts his head in the direction of Karen’s house.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: I can’t believe they’re my blood. The -
dialog: IQ of sloths and the manners of
text: banshees. A mechanic and a homemaker.
dialog: He knows as much about cars as a
dialog: beauty queen and she bakes cookies
dialog: that taste like wing nuts. As for the

dialog: know which end is up! What do you
dialog: want?!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: A job, Colonel Slade. I’m trying to
dialog: make my plane fare home for Christmas.
text: Slade drains his drink, starts the dangerous ceremony of
text: lighting a fresh cigar, hits a button and country music PLAYS.
text: Charlie is in thrall.
text: After a few moments, Slade shuts the music off.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Are you still hanging around,
dialog: Poormouth? Convenience store, my ass.

scene_heading: EXT. DEAN TRASK’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The Dean’s maroon Jaguar is parked outside. Harry approaches

text: crowbar. Nearby, a concrete mixer from a small landscaping
text: operation has been resting overnight beside a garden wall.
text: Jimmy jabs a bag of concrete mix with a spade, Trent picks up
text: the bag and heaves the contents into the mixer. Harry switches
text: the mixer on, it THUMPS rhythmically. He picks up the nozzle

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Why are we going to New York?
dialog:

text: He sniffs again.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: I can still smell her. Women. Who
dialog: made them? God was a fucking genius.
dialog: What a mind the guy must’ve had. The
dialog: hair -- they say the hair is
dialog: everything. Have you ever buried your
text: nose in a mountain of curls and just
dialog: wanted to go to sleep forever? And
dialog: lips that when they touch yours are
dialog: that first swallow of wine after
dialog: you’ve just crossed the desert?
text: Slade is deep into a reverie.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: Tits. Big ones, little ones, bury

dialog: Legs, I don’t care if they’re Greek

text: between them is a passport to heaven.
dialog: Don’t think I can’t see women because
dialog: I can’t see women. I’m a Female
dialog: Traffic Controller, Charlie, I can
dialog: bring them in. With my nose, with my
dialog: ears. What is it about them? "What

speaker_heading: SLADE

dialog: Please don’t do that.
text: Directly behind Slade, the Maitre d’ seats an elegant, young

scene_heading: INT. WALDORF SUITE - NIGHT 40
text: Charlie stands by as Slade moves tentatively around the room

speaker_heading: SLADE

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Nothing!
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Next time, snap it out, thumb to palm,
dialog: index through little digit aligned

text: Slade lets Charlie stew through another anxious silence.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: Too many men far better than you have
dialog: executed that courtesy and if you know

dialog: again...
text: Charlie holds himself very still.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: This bat’s got sharper radar than the

dialog: Charlie.
text: Slade lifts his cane, taps his way into his bedroon.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: See that you get a good night’s sleep.
text: Slade closes his door, Charlie stares at it for a moment. He
text: sits down on the couch, he glances around the fancy hotel
text: sitting room; damask drapes, directoire chairs, a fake French
text: antique desk. An air of bewilderment in Charlie gives way to
text: resignation. He stands up, removes the cushions from the couch
text: and pulls out the bed.
scene_heading: INT. WALDORF SUITE - NEXT MORNING 41

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Super! You know Sofia here’s working

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Suicide, Colonel Slade, is a crime.
speaker_heading: SLADE

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Who says?
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Squaws chew leather. Chew the skins

text: Slade is smiling slyly. He crosses and uncrosses his shoes.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)

speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Testarossa.
speaker_heading: SLADE

speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: 380.
speaker_heading: SLADE

speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: My wife’s name is Gail.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Excuse me. Gail -- strikes me as a
dialog: very beautiful young woman but there’s
text: a little tension in her voice. That

speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: What’s your point, Uncle Frank?
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: You ought to go down on her.

speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: My friend’s name is Charles.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (to Randy)
dialog: Yes, he’s special and he’s blind.
speaker_heading: RANDY

speaker_heading: RANDY

speaker_heading: GRETCHEN

speaker_heading: RANDY

speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Fort Benning.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: He was teaching hand-to-hand combat
dialog: to Second Lieutenants at the Infantry
dialog: School --
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Look at me, Randy, when you’re talking
dialog: to me.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: His partner in the act was some
dialog: Captain --
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Major Vincent Squires.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Whoever he was, before going on,
dialog: they’d have themselves a lo-cal

speaker_heading: RANDY

speaker_heading: RANDY (contd)
dialog: He was really flying at class, he got
text: excited and started pulling the pins.
text: One grenade got away from him. The
dialog: pin was in, he claims. In or out,
dialog: what’s the difference, what kind of
text: showboating lunatic juggles grenades?
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Vinnie came out okay --
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: And all Frank lost was his eyesight.
dialog: (to Charlie)
dialog: Well, he was an asshole before. Now
dialog: all he is, is a blind asshole. But
dialog: nothing could make me happier. Some
dialog: people don’t deserve to see. You get
dialog: the picture, Chuckie?
text: Suddenly Slade is up, jams Randy against the wall, he wraps his
text: arm terrifyingly around Randy’s neck.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: His name is Charles. You can say
dialog: that, can’t you? ‘Charles’.
text: Randy is choking, Gail and Gretchen screaming, W.R. and Garry
text: tear at Slade but he is too powerful for them.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: You know what this is, Randy? It’s
dialog: a chokehold, they teach it to you at
dialog: Ranger School. A little pressure and
dialog: I bust your windpipe. Now --
dialog: ‘Charles’. After me -- ‘Charles’.
text: Randy, against the wall, has gone blue. Suddenly, between the
text: two combatants, Charlie shoves his way through. Slade senses
dialog: hin.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: c'mon, Colonel, c’mon =~
text: Unconsciously, Slade eases up. Gretchen and Gail are frozen at
text: the kitchen door, Garry blinks emptily and W.R. doesn’t know
text: which way to turn. Slade removes a pristine napkin which he had
text: tucked under his chin for dinner, dots both corners of his
dialog: mouth.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Gretchen, you outdid yourself.

speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: (to Gretchen)
dialog: If you twist my arm hard enough, and
dialog: we're talking Turkey Marbella next

text: A terrible SILENCE. Slade finds a wine glass on the table, any
text: glass, he starts to raise it to his lips.
dialog: W.R.
dialog: Frank?
text: A moment.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Good-bye.
text: Slade extends his hand, W.R. looks at it, shakes it.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: Willie, I’m no fucking good and I
dialog: never have been.
text: Slade raises his wine in a toast.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: Here’s looking at you.
text: He taps the glass against his glass eye. PING! He polishes off

speaker_heading: SLADE

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Okay, okay --
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: You’re an employee, Simms. Keep your

text: Slade sips from his flask, shakes a pill out of a bottle.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What are you doing, taking pills with
dialog: liquor?!
text: Charlie snatches the bottle of pills away from Slade, tries to
dialog: read the label.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (contd)

dialog: What are these?
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: My German downers. Give ‘em back
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Colonel Slade --
speaker_heading: SLADE
scene_heading: GIVE ‘EM BACK!
text: Charlie hands him the pills.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: Pull duty with NATO, you eat and drink

text: He washes the pill down with whiskey, caps the bottle lovingly.

speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: Baden-Baden. Every night they award

speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: Hey, runt!

speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Back to bed.
text: Slade smiles enigmatically, Charlie stares anxiously at him, but
text: Slade’s eye is blinking closed peacefully. Charlie moves out to
text: the sitting room now, tries to fix up his mussed-up bed, but he
text: can’t get comfortable. He lies there in the darkness.
text: A THUD. Charlie jumps up, runs into Slade’s room, Slade has
text: fallen out of bed, is lying face-down beside it. On the night
text: table the bottle of German sleeping pills, now empty, lies on
dialog: its side.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Colonel! Colonel!
text: He shakes him desperately.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (contd)
dialog: For God’s sake, wake up!
text: Slade lies still, his jaw slack, Charlie lunges for the
text: telephone but keeps Slade in view, Slade’s one eye opens and
text: Charlie blinks into the shining, sea-blue iris. Suddenly
text: Slade’s face lights up, breaks into a smile, he starts laughing,
text: feels under the skirt of the bedside table, pulls out a little
text: vase into which he has poured the pills, now spills them back
text: in the bottle.
speaker_heading: SLADE -
dialog: You’re easy --
text: Charlie hangs up the phone.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That’s not funny.
dialog: 49
dialog:

speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Charlie, my boy, you got no sense of
dialog: humor.
text: Slade leans back in bed, presses a button on the TV remote,
text: another access channel comes on, the host is interviewing a
dialog: transsexual.
speaker_heading: . CHARLIE
dialog: It’s time you went to sleep,
dialog: Colonel --
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: At ease, son.
text: Charlie watches Slade "watching" television. He reaches for the

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Good night.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Shush, this is fascinating.
scene_heading: INT. WALDORF SUITE - NEXT MORNING 49
text: Charlie wakes up, hears a CLICKING sound from the direction of
text: Slade’s room. CLICK-CLICK, the sound repeats itself, then
text: repeats itself again, it is unearthly in the dark of the
text: morning, like some creature from another planet.
text: Charlie gets up, opens the door between the rooms, the light
text: from his room barely illuminates Slade who is sitting in a wing
text: chair, a side table pulled up in front of him. The extra
text: blanket from his bed is folded in half over the table.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: You got a watch?
text: Charlie looks at the clock besides Slade’s bed.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: It’s 7:19.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: I didn’t ask the time, I want to know
dialog: whether you got a watch?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE *
dialog: Yes. In my roon.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Get it.
text: Charlie hesitates, another CLICK.
dialog: 
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: LIE
dialog: There’s a clock right beside your bed,
dialog: Colonel --
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Does it have a second hand?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yes --
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Time me.
text: Charlie switches on the light, Slade is holding a .45 in his
text: hand. Slade signals Charlie to start timing him, in what seems
text: like an instant Slade has dismantled the gun, every part comes
text: out and is laid in perfect position on the blanket in front of
text: him, just as quickly he reassembles it, cocks it, dry-fires.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: How long?
text: Charlie hesitates, decides to go along.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (checking Slade’s
dialog: bedside clock)
dialog: 49 seconds.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: I‘’m rusty.
text: He starts to take the pistol apart again, slowly, feeling the
text: parts, taking a lot of pleasure in the process.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Where’d you get the gun, Colonel?
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Piece or weapon, Charlie, never a gun.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Where’d you get the piece?
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: I’m an officer in the United States
dialog: Army, this is my sidearm.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You’re not an officer anymore -~
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: So I’m retired, so what? An officer
text: never relinquishes his .45.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: you better relinquish it to_me or I’m
dialog: going to have to call Mrs. Rossi.
dialog: 
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Good idea.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: And then I’m going back to school.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Blue skies, green lights, I hope you
dialog: have a wonderful trip.
text: CLICK, CLICK, Slade has reassembled the pistol in rapid time.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: That felt like 45 seconds. You should
dialog: be able to do a .45 in 45. Did you
dialog: time me?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, I did not. And I’m calling
dialog: Albany.
text: He searches in his pathetic wallet, finds Karen’s slip of paper,
text: carefully unfolds it when suddenly Slade, quick as a cat, has
text: snatched it out of his hand, balled up the piece of paper and
dialog: swallowed it.
text: Charlie regards him, Slade’s Adam’s apple still bobbing.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (contd)
dialog: That was stupid.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: You’re stuck with me.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, I’m not, I’m out of here.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: How? All the way to New Hampshire on
dialog: no money? Ever hitchhiked on the West
dialog: Side Highway? You’ll end up hog-tied
text: in a dumpster in Hackensack.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You don’t scare me.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: You scare me, Charlie.
dialog: (sings)
dialog: ‘Charlie, my boy
dialog: Oh, Charlie, my boy

text: SNAP, Slade has taken apart the .45 again, his fingers are like
text: a watchmaker’s with the gun.
dialog: 
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: (rubbing his stomach)
dialog: Karen’s number tastes like Albany.
dialog: (tilts his head)
dialog: I’m headed for Arlington, Charlie. I
dialog: got my plot all picked out, section
text: 46, next to Audie Murphy’s. They may
dialog: give you a hard time because The
text: Unknown Soldier area is high-rent, but
dialog: be firm, tell them I qualify on every
dialog: count -- 100% disability, Silver Star,
dialog: 20-year man, active duty, authentic
dialog: Purple Heart.
text: CLICK-CLICK, Slade has reassembled the pistol, Charlie reaches
text: for it, Slade extends the pistol at arm’s length, out of
text: Charlie’s grasp.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: If they give you a hard time on
dialog: Section 46, ask for a space near Joe
dialog: Louis’ or Abner Doubleday’s. I always
dialog: liked baseball.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Give me the gun, Colonel.
speaker_heading: SLADE
text: An officer never gives up his sidearm,
dialog: I told you.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: In that case, I’m leaving.
text: Charlie takes a step towards his room.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Charlie!
text: Charlie stops.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: (carefully)
dialog: All I want from you is another day.
dialog: - Silence.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: For what?
text: Slade throws up his hands spontaneously.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: One last tour of the battlefield. I
dialog: can get around in a big city like New
dialog: York but now and then, I need a point
dialog: in the right direction. What’s a day
dialog: between friends?
dialog: 
text: A moment.
text: He tilts his
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Say I stay for another day, will you
dialog: give me your weapon?
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: I’m a Lieutenant-Colonel in the United
dialog: States Army and I’m not giving my
dialog: fucking gun to anybody. What are you
dialog: drinking?
text: flask, takes a huge swallow.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Colonel, this is unacceptable.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: ‘unacceptable?!’ Don’t give me any
dialog: of that prep school crap. Have they
dialog: already taken the Oregon out of the
dialog: boy and turned it into Harvard
dialog: Business School?
text: Slade cackles.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Okay, give me the bullets.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: My ammo?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You want to be next to Joe Louis or
dialog: not?
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: You do see the sense of it, Charlie,
dialog: don’t you? I can’t chew the leather
dialog: anymore. So why should I share in the
dialog: tribe’s provisions?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (firmly)
dialog: The bullets, Colonel.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: ‘The bullets, Colonel.’ You sound
dialog: like a guy in ‘Lives of a Bengal
dialog: Lancer.’ Next thing you'll be asking
dialog: for my blindfold and cigarette.
text: CLICK, CLICK, Slade removes the magazine, flips it to Charlie,
text: he catches it.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: What do you give a shit for?
dialog: 
dialog: Slade stands
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: LADE
dialog: About whether I blow my brains out or
dialog: not.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Because I have a conscience.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Oh yes, I forgot. The ‘Charlie’
dialog: conscience. Do we tell or do we not
dialog: tell? Do we follow the rich boy’s
dialog: code or not? Do we let the blind
dialog: asshole check out? When were you
dialog: born, Charlie, at The Round Table?
dialog: Haven’t you heard, conscience is dead?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, I haven’t heard.
speaker_heading: SLADE
text: THEN TAKE THE WAX OUT OF YOUR EARS AND
dialog: GROW UP! Fuck your buddy, cheat on

dialog: Mother’s Day. It’s all shit.
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: To take a leak. I know I said only

speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
text: Get dressed -- the battlefield awaits.
text: Slade turns towards the bathroom.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: And Charlie...you forgot the one in
dialog: the chamber.
text: Slade instantly cocks and uncocks the pistol, expelling the
text: bullet, which tumbles in a harmless arc, landing at Charlie’s
text: feet. Slade spins his .45 cowboy-style, drops it into his
text: bathrobe pocket and disappears into the bathroon.

speaker_heading: DONNA

speaker_heading: SLADE

speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: So you don’t mind if we wait with you?
text: Donna smiles again.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: No.
text: Slade has already pulled up a chair. He sits down, Charlie
text: joins him as Slade leans into Donna.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: You smell like a bar of Ogilvie
dialog: Sisters soap.
text: A moment.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: That’s amazing.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Good, I’m in the amazing business.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: It is Ogilvie Sisters soap.
dialog: (to Charlie)
dialog: Granny gave me three bars for
dialog: Christmas.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: I’m crazy about your grandmother. And
dialog: I think she would have liked Charlie,
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (to Donna)
dialog: Don’t pay any attention to him.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: What’s your name?
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Donna.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Hi Donna, I’m Frank and...
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: That’s Charlie.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: (to Charlie)
dialog: She likes you.
text: Donna laughs, she is looking right at Charlie now.
dialog: 82.
dialog: 
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: (seductively)
dialog: What’s that music?
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Samba. Or is it a tango?
text: Donna’s shoulders sway gently.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Yes, it’s a tango. You tango, Donna?
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: I love to. But --
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: But what?
speaker_heading: DONNA
text: Michael doesn’t.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: ‘Michael,’ who you’re waiting for.
speaker_heading: DONNA
text: Michael thinks the tango’s hysterical.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Tell Michael I think he’s hysterical.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (to Donna)
dialog: Don’t pay any attention to him. Or
dialog: did I say that already?
text: Donna giggles.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: You know the name of this tango?
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Tangos have names?
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Of course, this one’s called La
dialog: Punalada.
dialog: Slade’s Spanish is perfect.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd) ~
dialog: You know what that means?
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: No --
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: ‘The Stab.’
text: Donna risks another look at Charlie.
dialog: 
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: : SLADE (contd)
dialog: Would you like to dance?
text: Donna checks with Charlie, he gives a reassuring nod and, in
text: this moment, endears himself to Donna completely. Slade and
text: Donna rise.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: (to Donna)
dialog: Your arm?
text: Slade takes Donna’s arn.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: I need some coordinates here, Charlie.
text: Charlie leans into Slade.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You're looking at about forty by
dialog: twenty. You/re facing the long end.
text: Halfway down on the left there’s a
text: palm plant sticking out, on the right
dialog: side’s the band --
text: Slade puts up his hand to tacit Charlie, hands him his cane.
text: He moves out to the dance floor with Donna, she raises her arms,
text: he takes hold of them, and in an instant they are into a tango.
text: Slade is a marvelous dancer, he moves in perfect consonance with
text: the music, at first it is all Donna can do to keep up with him
text: put he leads so brilliantly, after a while she becomes a perfect
text: partner. The little trio is into the number now, the dance
text: floor clearing for Slade and Donna, the tempo speeds up,
text: rivulets of sweat run down Donna’s cheek but the Colonel remains
text: cool and precise and in command. As Donna dances, her eyes keep
text: meeting Charlie’s eyes when suddenly, with a great glissando,
text: the tango ends and the trio takes a brief break but first they,
text: and the customers at the tables, applaud.
text: Donna leads Slade back to Charlie.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Frank, you are one incredible dancer.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Wait ‘til you see Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: He’s a liar, I don’t dance.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: (to Donna)
dialog: Isn’t he a charmer? Truth is, not
dialog: only can he dance, he can sing you a

speaker_heading: DONNA

speaker_heading: DONNA (contd)
dialog: This is Frank and this is Charlie.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Hi Frank, hi Charlie.
dialog: (to Donna)
dialog: Sorry I’m late --
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: That’s okay, these two guys
dialog: entertained me. I got to tell you,
dialog: the time flew.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: (to Michael)
dialog: Your girl does a helluva tango.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (to Donna)
dialog: At last. You found someone to tango
dialog: with.
dialog: (smiling, to Charlie)
dialog: Let me shake your hand.
text: He pumps Charlie’s hand.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: No, no, it was Frank --
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What the hell, I’11 shake both your

text: Michael pumps Slade’s ‘and Charlie’s hands.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (contd)

speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Okay, okay -~
dialog: 
dialog: 53
dialog: 86.

text: jingles.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Take your hand out of your pocket,
dialog: Michael, I/’11 get this.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Why thank you.
text: Donna kisses Frank, and now she kisses Charlie. Then suddenly
text: she hurries away.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (contd)
dialog: ‘Bye, guys.
text: And Donna and Michael are gone. Charlie watches them disappear
text: as Slade stares in the direction where Michael last stood.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: (emptily)
dialog: ‘Darryl and Carol.’
scene_heading: INT. P.J. CLARKE’S, THIRD AVENUE - NIGHT : 53
text: Slade and Charlie are perched at the bar, drinking, and eating
text: cheeseburgers. They are like the eye of a storm in an excited
text: holiday crowd, junior executives, male and female sizing each
text: other up, some already coupled.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Soap, for Christ’s sake! Twenty-two
text: years old and she smells of soap and
dialog: water! God, that’s a once ina
dialog: lifetime thing and what happened? You
dialog: blew it!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Blew what?
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: That girl was crazy about you.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Me? She was getting ready to have
dialog: kittens with you on the dance floor.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: That’s the point. She was coming on
dialog: to me but it was you who she wanted. x
dialog: It’s the oldest trick in the world.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I think you’re wrong. It was you that
dialog: she liked. And you know she liked
dialog: you, you just don’t want to admit it.
dialog: 
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Watch it, I/’11 do the mind-fucking
dialog: around here.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: We should have all gone to dinner.
dialog: Then you and Donna could have snuck
text: off and danced the night away.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: And then what?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You tell me.
text: Slade summons the bartender.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Triple Jack Daniels, and another beer
dialog: for the professor.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I’ve moved up to ‘professor’.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: That’s for the cretin behind the bar.
dialog: I don’t want him worrying about the
dialog: Beverage Commission.
dialog: (a final bite)
dialog: This is my last cheeseburger.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That bad, huh?
text: Slade smiles at Charlie’s attempt at a joke.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: I feel like eating it all over again.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Let's get you one, 1/11 spring for it.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Thanks, Charlie, I’m full. But I’m
dialog: empty, if you know what I mean.
text: The bartender serves up the new round of drinks.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: (to Charlie)
dialog: Ever hear that song of Frank
dialog: Sinatra’s, ‘My Way?’
text: Charlie nods, sings a little bit of it.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: I hate that song.
text: Charlie smiles.
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: I did it my way but my way’s no
dialog: fucking good.
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: You won’t make the same mistakes I
dialog: did, will you?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I don’t know, I don’t have a way yet.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Oh yes, you do. You’re a giver,
text: Charlie. A helper. A reacher-out.
dialog: Very valuable --
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You think so?
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Great with women. They love that
dialog: stuff. If I’d understood women, I
dialog: could’ve ruled the world.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Donna sure went for you.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Maybe. The truth is, Charlie, with
dialog: women I didn’t wear well. But that’s
dialog: nothing against women. Men felt the
dialog: same way.
speaker_heading: . CHARLIE
dialog: I think you’re being hard on yourself.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Isn’t it about time?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Everybody’s got problems. It’s how
dialog: you work them out. You’re a marvelous
dialog: man and you got a lot to offer --
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Don’t blow smoke up my ass, you’ll
dialog: ruin my autopsy.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Your reasons for killing yourself are
dialog: invalid, Colonel. I’d love to ‘tear
dialog: a herring’ with you and I/1l bet
dialog: there’s plenty others standing in line
dialog: behind me -- if you’d only give us a
dialog: chance.
text: Slade stares at Charlie.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: I got a phone, Charlie. In the last
dialog: two months I received one call. They
dialog: were trying to sell me The Boston
dialog: Globe. I decided against it. But TI
dialog: enjoyed talking to then.
text: Charlie regards Slade, Slade senses him, reaches out, rumples
text: Charlie’s hair a little too roughly.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
text: The head is slightly underdeveloped.
dialog: Oregon out of the Boy Scouts by Mom’s
dialog: Apple Pie.
text: Slade’s hand falls to Charlie’s chest.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: But you know something, Charlie my
dialog: boy, in parts your heart is good.
dialog: Play it smart. Give a little now and
dialog: then so you can get what you want.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Sell out?
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: In installments. To the highest
dialog: bidder.
text: Charlie switches drinks with Slade, swaps his beer for Slade’s
text: shot of Jack Daniels. Takes a sip, winces.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You don’t believe a word of that.
text: Slade smiles.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: All that stuff about squealing and
dialog: running for cover and doing the deal
dialog: -- that was all bullshit, wasn’t it?
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Yes.
text: Charlie drains the Jack Daniels, exhales at the strength of the
text: drink. Slade, for the moment, has fallen silent.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: I used to come here with Big Ed for
dialog: brandies after ‘21’. We’d sit in the
dialog: pack over there -~
text: Charlie looks around, plugs into the charged atmosphere of
text: paired-off singles.
dialog: 
dialog: 54
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: We never went home alone. Things were
dialog: different then, Charlie.
text: After a sudden and deep silence, Slade turns to a woman on his
dialog: eft.
speaker_heading: > SLADE (contd)
dialog: Dance?
text: The woman, frightened, swivels away.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: No?
text: Slade sits for a moment, then steps off his barstool, drifts
text: towards a dark, empty area next to the jukebox, and dances
text: alone. He moves like a sylph and Charlie, for the instant,
text: gives himself up to Slade, enjoys it.
text: Suddenly, Slade calls to Charlie.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: Get a hold of Manny. Tell him ‘now’.
text: Slade is staring blindly but intently at Charlie and it is not
text: until Charlie crosses to a pay phone, that he resumes dancing.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. LIMO, STREET - NIGHT 54
text: Slade and Charlie are seated in the back of the limo, it is
text: parked in the east 60’s just off 5th Avenue, Manny at the wheel,

text: brownstone down the street.
speaker_heading: |. CHARLIE
dialog: I’d say it’s about twenty steps --
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Yards. Always give it to me in yards,
dialog: Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: About fifteen yards, and there’s
dialog: stairs --
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: A stoop. How many?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE “

speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Nine steps up. Railing?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No railing.

speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Bell?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: There’s a shiny, brass plate on the

speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: How do you know it’s not the mailbox?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE

text: in the middle.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Good work.
text: Slade leans towards Charlie.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: How’s my part?
text: Charlie checks Slade’s hair.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Straight as an arrow.
text: Slade fluffs up his pocket handkerchief.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: I got the red foulard okay, didn’t I?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Real dark red --
speaker_heading: SLADE

dialog: Bay Run.
dialog: (adjusts his tie)
dialog: Windsor knot.
text: He swings open the door of the car and steps out. As he
text: straightens himself up on the street, he turns back once towards
text: Charlie, throws him a happy, mini-salute, walks on down towards
text: the brownstone. Manny and Charlie are tracking Slade as he-
text: moves unerringly to the bottom of the brownstone’s steps, climbs
text: them, rings the bell, a black woman in a formal maid’s uniform
text: admits him, closes the burnished wood door.
text: An awkward silence.
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: You know, Charlie...
dialog: 
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: Normally, I don’t do no whoring and

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I’m sure you don’t, Manny.
dialog: (after a moment)
dialog: This your first time?
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: Well...
dialog: Another moment.
speaker_heading: MANNY (contd)
dialog: Maybe when I first purchased the car,
dialog: I had this big balloon payment. But
dialog: the Colonel, you know, Charlie --
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What about him?
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: The Colonel is a gentleman.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: A gentleman?
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: Class.
text: Charlie weighs Manny’s sincerity, regards the burnished wood
text: door down the street. He reaches for the car phone.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Can you get long distance on this?
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: And how. Be my guest.

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh no, Colonel, you’re not going to

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: ...Yes, this is a valid Oregon

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: The Colonel is not my companion, I’m

speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: very nice. But this is a hundred and

dialog: this door.
text: Charlie moves to another model.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: How about this one?
speaker_heading: FRED ~

dialog: Quota?
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: How many Ferraris you sold this month?

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Could we get off suicide? You’re just
text: in a slump right now.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: No slump, Charlie. I’m bad. Not bad,
dialog: rotten.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You’re not bad, you’re just in pain.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: What the fuck do you know about pain?
dialog: You're a fucking little snail darter
dialog: from the Pacific Northwest.
text: Slade reaches for a cigar one-handed, lights it with his Zippo,
text: blows a smoke ring, aims the gun at the smoke ring, Charlie
text: steps towards him and Slade lowers the gun again and points it
text: right at Charlie.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: This is no time to grow a dick, ny
dialog: joy.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Please put the gun away, Colonel...
text: Charlie takes one more step towards Slade. Slade hesitates,
text: twirls the gun furiously, and suddenly it is pointing at his own
dialog: head again.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Don’t move. .
text: Charlie freezes.
dialog: 
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: I’m talking Parade Ground --
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: -- Atten-shun!!
text: Charlie is motionless, sweat at his hairline as Slade’s antennae
text: work overtime, the place static with the electricity of his
text: concentration. Charlie advances on Slade, who keeps the pistol
text: trained on his own temple.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: Soldier, you were given an order.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Give me the gun, Colonel.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Charlie, in five seconds I’m going to
dialog: kill myself.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I want your gun, Colonel.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Five -- four -- three -- two --
text: WHAP! Charlie, ducking under the electrical field and quick as
text: a cat, grabs the barrel of the gun, tries to wrest it away, but
text: the Colonel won’t give it up. They struggle, Charlie holds on
text: desperately, pulling the gun down towards himself but Slade
text: won’t release it. The barrel of the gun is now pointed at
text: Charlie’s stomach, he has both his hands around it, but the
text: Colonel’s finger is still firmly on the trigger.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: Let go.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, I won’t.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: You’re going to die like a dog,
dialog: Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Do it! You want to do it? Do it!
dialog: Do it!
text: Only the sounds of their breathing now.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (contd) ~
dialog: I’ll explode all over you. Pull the
dialog: thing, you blind motherfucker.
text: Charlie starts to hyperventilate, his breaths coming in terrible
text: heaves, sweat running down his cheek. Slade is inches away.
speaker_heading: SLADE

speaker_heading: j CHARLIE
dialog: I’m scared.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: You don’t want to die, Charlie.
speaker_heading: . CHARLIE
dialog: Neither do you.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Give me one reason not to.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I’ll give you two. You can dance a

speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: You’ve never seen anybody do either.
text: He stares down at his gun.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)

speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: You know how to handle a .45?
dialog: Another moment.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Half as good as a .90.
text: Slade hesitates for a moment, he manages a weak smile, relaxes
text: imperceptibly. Charlie looks down, finds Slade has released the
text: gun, Charlie holds it awkwardly by the barrel. Slade gently
text: reaches out, with one hand he flicks a lever, the magazine drops
text: out of the gun, with the other hand Slade catches it’and in one
text: smooth move, reaches up and deposits it in Charlie’s breast
text: pocket. Now Slade turns away.
speaker_heading: SLADE .
dialog: I could use a drink.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: How about a cup of coffee?
speaker_heading: SLADE .
dialog: i That’s too big a leap for me right
dialog: now, Charlie. Maybe tomorrow. Mr.
dialog: John Daniels, no water.
dialog: 
dialog: 118.
text: Charlie crosses to the mini-bar, and Slade listens to the
text: comfortable sounds of Charlie fixing him a drink. Charlie hands
text: the glass to him. Slade takes a gulp, makes a face.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: I said no water, Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: No water. They have strong ice at the
dialog: Waldorf.
text: Slade smiles, takes another sip.
text: The RATTLE of a key in the door, the Night Maid,-an aging but
text: attractive Hispanic woman, enters.
speaker_heading: NIGHT MAID
dialog: Turn down your bed, sir?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, thank you --
text: Slade sniffs the air, opens his arms invitingly.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: What he means, senorita, is come right
dialog: in.
text: | The Night Maid smiles anxiously. Charlie removes a set of
text: towels from her arm, shows her out.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (kindly)
dialog: Maybe later.
speaker_heading: NIGHT MAID
dialog: Yes sir, good night.
text: She leaves, Slade is still sniffing the area, his teeth bared
text: in a ravenous smile.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Boy, have you got a one-track mind.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Is there anything else in the world,
dialog: Charlie?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Not for you. x
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: What’s so bad? Women are the essence
dialog: of life. You know what’s kept me
dialog: going all these years --
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 119.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: ...The thought that maybe one day I
dialog: could have a woman’s arms wrapped
text: around me -- and her legs -- wrapped
dialog: around me -- and --
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: And what?
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: And that she might still be there in
dialog: the morning when I wake up -- the
text: smell of her, all funky and warn...
text: Slade is staring blindly into the remains of his watery drink,
text: Charlie watching him closely, Slade oddly drifts away.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: I finally gave up on it.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Well, you’re making a mistake. I
dialog: don’t know why you can’t have that.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: (dazedly)
dialog: Have what?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You know, when we get back to New

text: Charlie holds up his hand to Slade.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That's okay, Manny says there’re

dialog: impressive.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: No way, Charlie. Not the shuttle, not

speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Thanks. Why are you all alone with

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: He left.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: I thought it was a Mom-and-Pop store.
dialog: Who’s the Pop?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: My stepfather.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Oh yeah. Why isn’t he in on this?
text: Charlie doesn’t answer.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: He’s no good, huh?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: He’s okay. We just don’t get along.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Why not?

speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Keep rolling, Manny.
text: Charlie, asleep, shivers. Slade takes the blanket off himself
text: and doubles it up on Charlie, now he settles himself
text: ramrod-straight in the corner of the backseat, his dress hat
text: rests on his knee, his eyes are closed, but an acute sense of
text: awareness about him, as if he could bounce awake in an instant.
text: As if he were in a foxhole.
scene_heading: EXT. DORMITORY, THE BAIRD SCHOOL - MORNING 78
text: A screen door keeps slamming as students pour out of the
text: building, green book bags and bicycles, they make their way down

text: The limousine pulls up and parks, a few of the students glance

text: opens, Manny hands Charlie a plastic Waldorf-Astoria laundry
dialog: bag.
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: -.-This it?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Thanks.
text: He takes the bag, climbs out of the limo, turns back to Slade
text: who is still seated in the car, his head tilted towards Charlie.
text: A bell RINGS.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: First bell. I just got time to shave.
text: Slade extends a cigarette-sized roll of bills.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Three hundred dollars. A job well

speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Okay, Manny.

scene_heading: EXT. THE BAIRD SCHOOL, BELFRY - MORNING 79
text: The bell RINGS again.
scene_heading: INT. ACADEMY BUILDING, BAIRD SCHOOL - MORNING 80
text: An impressive assembly hall, portraits of founders and former
text: headmasters line the walls, the entire student body is settling
text: into long benches, century-old relics with initials of alumni
text: long dead carved into the backs. The benches face a stage and
text: a podium.
text: Charlie enters, the bell is RINGING steadily now, a Monitor
text: touches Charlie’s arm, motions him up the steps to the stage
text: where the members of the Student-Faculty Disciplinary Committee
text: are taking seats in wooden armchairs arranged in a semi-circle.
text: Facing the Committee are a pair of elementary school-type desks.
text: Charlie notices George at one of the desks, but he is depressed
text: to see a distinguished-looking, gray-haired man seated beside
text: him, GEORGE WILLIS, SR. George, Jr., who appears to have shrunk
text: in size next to his father, studiously avoids meeting Charlie’s
text: glance as Charlie takes his seat at the other desk. Mrs.
text: Hunsaker is beside the podium with a note pad. A noisy rustle
text: and scraping of benches, the students rising as Dean Trask
text: enters from a wing.
text: Charlie, isolated at his desk, looks out, his eyes rove the sea
text: of students’ faces in the great hall. Seated in their midst,
text: and side-by-side, are Harry, Trent and Jimmy. The bell stops
text: ringing as the last tardy students take their seats. Trask
text: approaches the podium.
speaker_heading: TRASK .
dialog: ..-I called an open meeting of this
dialog: institution this morning because the
dialog: incident that occurred this Tuesday

dialog: all of us...not an isolated case of

dialog: 
dialog: 125.
speaker_heading: TRASK (contd)
dialog: vandalism, what happened is the
dialog: symptom of the sickness of a society,
text: a sickness which runs counter to the
dialog: principles this school was founded on.
dialog: A school among whose graduates, three
text: have sat at the desk in the Oval Room
dialog: of The White House. Baird men have
dialog: run State Departments and investment
dialog: houses, founded department stores and
dialog: coached football teams, our alumni
dialog: receive their bulletins in ashrams in
dialog: India and in palaces in Jordan, we
dialog: are, in fact, known around the world
dialog: as the cradle of this country’s
dialog: leadership. But today we are bleeding
dialog: from disrespect.
text: A door to the assembly hall SQUEAKS open and Manny, caught like
text: a rabbit in headlights, appears. Awkwardly, he leads Slade onto
text: the stage and into a chair next to a startled Charlie. Slade
text: settles himself in as if he were right at home, Manny departs
text: quickly as Trask looks Slade up and down, as do the other
text: participants on the stage. The students on the back benches
dialog: rise, to get a better view of this blind article who has
text: arranged himself at the side of Charlie Simms.
text: Slade leans over to a bewildered Charlie, speaks intently to
text: him, now Charlie turns Slade in the direction of George’s
text: father, Slade tilts his head in his fashion, examining George,
text: Sr. with his antennae, but George, Sr. meets his gaze.
speaker_heading: TRASK (contd)
dialog: Who is this, Mr. Simms?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Ummm -- ahh --
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: (to Trask)
dialog: ‘This’ is Frank Slade,
dialog: Lieutenant-Colonel, United States
dialog: Army, retired. I’m here in place of
dialog: Charlie’s parents.
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: In loco parentis. ~
dialog: 
text: Trask blinks.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: They could not make the trip from
dialog: Oregon today.
dialog: 126.
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: And what is your relationship to Mr.
dialog: Simms?
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Is this a courtroom?
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: The closest thing we could manage to
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Then if we’re taking oaths, I’d like
dialog: to swear a few people in.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: There are no oaths at Baird, we are
dialog: all on our honor.
speaker_heading: SLADE
text: Larry and Franny Simms are old and
dialog: dear friends of mine. They asked me
dialog: to appear here today on Charlie’s
dialog: behalf. Okay?
text: A moment.
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: Happy to have you with us, Colonel.
text: Trask turns towards the desk where George and his father are
text: seated.
speaker_heading: TRASK (contd)
dialog: Mr. Willis?
speaker_heading: WILLIS, SR.
dialog: Which Mr. Willis?
text: Slade pokes Charlie with his elbow.
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: George, Jr., sir.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: TRASK -
dialog: You were in a position last Tuesday
dialog: night to see who vandalized my car.
dialog: Who was it?
speaker_heading: GEORGE .
dialog: Well, I have an idea who it was.
dialog: 127.
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: Not an ‘idea’, Mr. Willis, did you see
dialog: or did you not see?
speaker_heading: . GEORGE
dialog: I didn’t have my glasses on.
text: George’s father stares at hin.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (contd)
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: I was in the library, I had on my
dialog: reading glasses, and then I helped
dialog: Simms close up and I started to put
dialog: on my regular glasses but it was a
dialog: real frosty night, right? So I
dialog: started to clean them, then I heard
dialog: this sound, but I never got a chance
dialog: to put them on.
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: Whom, with your limited vision, did
dialog: you see?
text: George hesitates, his father puts his hand on his arm, whispers
text: purposefully to hin.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: } (to Trask)
dialog: Well, like I say, it was real blurry
dialog: -- I mean I can’t see without my
dialog: : glasses --
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: What did you see, Mr. Willis?
speaker_heading: | GEORGE
dialog: You mean definitively?
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: Stop fencing with me, Mr. Willis, and
dialog: tell me what you saw!
text: George’s father drills George with another stare.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Now don’t hold me to this, but -- I
dialog: mean no glasses, and it was dark and
dialog: everything and --
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: Mr. Willis?!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Maybe Harry Havemeyer, Trent Potter
dialog: and Jimmy Jameson.
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: ‘Maybe’?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 128.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Ballpark. Best guess.
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: Could you provide us with some detail?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, Charlie could tell you for sure,
dialog: he was closer.
text: Trask, finally, irritated by the interchange, turns to Charlie.
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: Mr. Simms?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: You don’t wear eyeglasses, do you?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: With your untrammeled sight, whom did
dialog: you see?
text: A moment. From their seats in the middle of the assembly,
text: Harry, Trent and Jimmy, very nervous now, await Charlie’s
dialog: response.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (contd)
dialog: I saw something, but I couldn’t say
dialog: who it was.
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: All right, what was the ‘something’
dialog: you saw?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I couldn’t say.
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: You ‘couldn’t say’? Or you wouldn’t
dialog: say?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I -- I just couldn’t say. .
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: Couldn't, wouldn’t, shouldn’t! Mr.
dialog: Simms, you’re exhausting my patience
dialog: and making a mockery of these
dialog: proceedings. I am giving you one last
dialog: j chance -- the consequences of your
dialog: response will be dire.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 129.
speaker_heading: TRASK (contd)
dialog: By ‘dire,’ Mr. Simms, I mean your
dialog: future will be jeopardized --
dialog: ermanently. Now, for the last
dialog: Pine -- what did you see last
dialog: Tuesday night outside my house?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I saw somebody --
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: ‘I saw somebody.’ Good! And did you
dialog: see their size and shape?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: And they were the size and shape of
dialog: whom?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: They were the size and shape of --
text: A very long moment.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (contd)
dialog: ..-most any Baird student.
text: Slade is ecstatic. Harry, Trent and Jimmy sink back into their
text: seats and exhale with relief.
text: Trask surveys the gathering: the student body. the Disciplinary
text: Committee, George, Jr. and George, Sr., and finally, Charlie and
dialog: Slade.
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: I am left with no real witness. Mr.
dialog: Willis’ testimony is not only vague,
text: it is unsubstantiated. The substance
dialog: I was looking for, Mr. Simms, was to
dialog: come from you.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I’m sorry.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (contd)
dialog: I really am.
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: I’m sorry, too. Because you know what
dialog: I’m going to do inasmuch as I can’t
dialog: punish Mr. Havemeyer, Mr. Potter and
dialog: Mr. Jameson -- and I won’t punish
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: Silence.
dialog: 130.
speaker_heading: TRASK (Cont’d)
dialog: Mr. Willis, he is the only party to
dialog: this incident who is still worthy of
dialog: calling himself~a Baird man -- I am
dialog: going to expel you, Mr. Simms. You
dialog: are a cover-up artist and you are a
dialog: liar.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: But not a snitch.
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: No, I don’t think I will.
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: Mr. Slade --
speaker_heading: SLADE
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: Please watch your language, Mr. Slade,
dialog: you are in The Baird School, not a
dialog: barracks. Mr. Simms, I’1ll give you
dialog: one final opportunity to speak up --
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: Mr. Simms doesn’t want it. He doesn’t
dialog: need to be labeled ‘still worthy of
dialog: being a Baird man’. What’s your motto
dialog: here? "Boys, inform on your
dialog: classmates and you’1l save your hide,
dialog: anything short of that and we’ll burn
dialog: you at the stake"? Gentlemen, when
dialog: the shit hits the fan, some guys run
dialog: and some guys stay. Here’s Charlie
dialog: -- facing the fire. And there’s
dialog: George -- hiding in Big Daddy’s
dialog: pocket. And what are you going to do,
dialog: Dean Trask? Reward George -- and
dialog: destroy Charlie?
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: Are you finished, Mr.Slade?
speaker_heading: - SLADE
dialog: I’m just warming up. I don’t care if
dialog: William Howard Taft or William
dialog: Jennings Bryan went here, their spirit
text: is dead.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 131.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: You’re building a ratship, a vessel for
dialog: seagoing snitches, and if you think
dialog: you're preparing these minnows for
dialog: manhood, think again because you’re
dialog: killing the very spirit this institution
dialog: proclaims it instills. What a
dialog: performance. The only class in the
dialog: act is sitting next to me and I’m here
dialog: to tell you his soul is intact. You
dialog: know why? Because someone, I’m not
dialog: going to say who, offered to buy it.
text: Slade stares at Trask.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
dialog: However, Charlie wasn’t selling.
speaker_heading: TRASK
dialog: Sir, you’re out of order.
speaker_heading: SLADE
dialog: You don’t know what ‘out of order’ is.
dialog: I’d show you out of order, but I’m too
dialog: old, too tired and too blind. If I
dialog: were the man I was five years ago, I’d
dialog: put a flame thrower to this place.
dialog: I’ve been around, Dean-O, there was
dialog: a time when I could see, and I’ve seen
text: arms torn out and legs ripped off but
dialog: there’s nothing like the sight of an
dialog: amputated spirit -- no prosthetic for
dialog: that. You think you’re merely sending

dialog: And he’s chosen the right path. The
text: path is made of Principle and it leads
dialog: to Character. Let him continue on his
dialog: journey.
text: He sits. The hall is engulfed in silence.

text: down, George Willis, Sr. turns beet-red, Harry, Trent and Jimmy
dialog: don’t know which way to turn, the members of the Student-Faculty
dialog: Disciplinary Committee have already begun conferring, the

text: building seems to shake with SOUND, Slade reaches down and
text: squeezes Charlie’s arm, a wink from his gimpy eye.
speaker_heading: SLADE (contd)
