text: A SOUND slowly builds: the rhythmic rocking of a TRAIN'S
text: WHEELS over RAILROAD TRACKS...
scene_heading: INT. HIGH SPEED TRAIN - MORNING
text: COLTER jolts awake. Sunlight hits his face.
text: He blinks. A stunned beat. He's disoriented.
text: Slowly he turns his head to one side...
text: PASSENGERS. Filling most of the seats. Office workers on
text: their morning commute into a city.
text: Turning the other way, he's confronted with a window. Trees
text: flash by, splitting the rising sunlight into a hypnotic
text: strobe pattern.
text: Colter looks to be thirty years old. A military buzz cut. A
text: disciplined physique, lean and spare, almost gaunt. Skin
text: burnished by years of desert sandstorms and equatorial sun.
text: His expression, prematurely aged by combat, is perpetually
text: wary, sometimes predatory, accustomed to trouble.
text: Despite his military bearing, Colter wears a button down
text: shirt and navy sports coat. On his wrist is a digital watch.
text: It reads 7:40 a.m.
text: He swallows. A strange, creeping panic.
text: He has no idea where he is.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW JERSEY COUNTRYSIDE - MORNING
text: The train hurls straight at us.
text: NEW ANGLE -- Skimming alongside as the train twists and
text: turns, sucking up track -- feet, yards, miles of it.
text: Beneath it, the curving rails, which the rushing train barely
text: seems to touch. They vibrate with an eerie, dulcimer HUM.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - MORNING
text: Colter hasn't moved. By his side he sees a canvas MESSENGER
dialog: BAG. Is that his?
text: Tentatively, he lifts the edge of the bag to look inside. A
text: red APPLE rolls against two LIBRARY BOOKS. The bag's leather
text: NAME TAG reads: "SEAN FENTRESS."
dialog: It's not coming back to him. This whole experience is
text: starting to freak him out.
text: He catches the scent of something. A passenger walks by with
text: a STEAMING CUP OF COFFEE.
text: CHK-THOCK! Two rows back, an OVERWEIGHT MAN opens a can of
dialog: soda.
text: Sitting opposite Colter, facing him, is a WOMAN in her late
text: twenties (CHRISTINA). In contrast to the corporate suits
text: around her, her appearance is thrift store funky: black nail
text: polish, dark lipstick, black hair with blue streaks, a button-
text: down blouse edged in black funeral lace with silver skull-and-
text: bones cufflinks. She's busy writing in a journal.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Ma'am?
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Excuse me... ma'am?
text: She looks up. Blank stare.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: What's what?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Where am I?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: (looks out the window)
text: Almost at Newark.
text: Goes back to her journal.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: What's Newark? A city?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: It's more of a hell hole.
text: But Colter still doesn't understand. He gets up. Nausea
text: slams into him. He hangs on to the seat.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Woah.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I think I'm going to puke.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: (gestures, alarmed)
dialog: Okay, bathroom's that way.
text: Colter looks down the aisle, hesitating.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Go. Seriously.
text: Colter eases himself into the aisle. Totters down the length
text: of the car until he finds the RESTROOM.
text: The door is LOCKED. The latch reads "OCCUPIED."
text: Bracing himself, he lurches forward into...
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - SECOND CAR - MORNING
text: He freezes. It's a mirror image of the first car. But no,
text: the passengers are different.
text: Beside him there's a small door. Thinking it's the bathroom,
text: he instead opens it to find a CONDUCTOR'S COMPARTMENT. A
text: cramped office with chairs and surveillance monitors.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: Ticket?
text: A heavy-set CONDUCTOR stands in the aisle. A jangling of
text: keys. Colter just stares at him. Dazed.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: May I see your ticket?
text: The last thing on his mind. Bewildered, he searches his
dialog: pockets.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I don't think I...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: Have to write you up then.
text: He pulls out a citation pad.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Is this...?
text: From inside his sports coat he pulls out a TRAIN TICKET. The
text: conductor snips his ticket and brushes past.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Wait a sec. I'm a little out of it
dialog: here. Where's this train headed?
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
text: New York. Penn Station.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: New York?
dialog: Why would he be going to New York? How can this be
text: happening? Fear starts to grip him as the hallucination
text: simply continues.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Do you know where I got on?
text: The conductor examines his ticket again.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: Princeton Junction.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Where's that?
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: "Bout ten minutes back.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: But I've never been to Princeton
dialog: Junction. See... I don't remember
dialog: waking up or buying a ticket or
dialog: getting on the train or anything
text: else. It's just a blank.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: Lucky you.
text: The jaded conductor moves on. Colter is alone with his
text: confusion. Takes a deep breath. The nausea has eased
dialog: slightly.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Okay. You're gonna figure this
dialog: out.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - FIRST CAR - MORNING
text: Entering the first car again. The rows of passengers. Must
dialog: be at least forty people.
text: As he walks back up the aisle, he looks from face to face:
text: A pale COMPUTER ENGINEER reviews some documents.
text: A forty-something SECRETARY does a crossword puzzle.
text: DEREK, a stock broker type, talks on his cell phone:
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Trust me, by one o'clock, the
dialog: bridge is going to be jammed...
text: A COLLEGE STUDENT, slumped against a window, eyes shut,
text: listens to an MP-3 player.
text: An OLD MAN with a faded wool suit clutches a cane.
text: A BACKPACKER, female, European, 20s, hiking boots, examines a
dialog: guidebook.
text: A dowdy OFFICER MANAGER type sorts supermarket coupons into a
text: tabbed file box.
text: An African American EXECUTIVE reads a newspaper.
text: None of them pays any attention to Colter.
text: A WHOOSH of AIR -- he turns to
text: An AIR-CONDITIONING VENT. The HISS of AIR sound sinister.
text: Like the exhalations of a creature.
text: A SCRAPE. He looks to see
text: A woman FILING HER NAILS.
text: Colter cringes. Every detail, every sensory impression seems
text: heightened, near the point of overload.
text: He reaches Christina again. Eases back in the seat across
text: from her. She writes in her journal, ignoring him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
text: There's something else in his sports coat. A WALLET. He
text: turns it over a few times, inspecting it. Pulls out a
text: DRIVER'S LICENSE. Another man's face is in the photo. The
text: name on the license reads: "SEAN FENTRESS." The same name as
text: on the messenger bag. The street address on the license
dialog: reads: "58 Alexander Road, Princeton Junction, New Jersey."
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Sean Fentress? Who the hell's
dialog: that?
text: And why does he have this guy's wallet? He leans forward to
text: speak with Christina again.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Ma'am?
text: She lowers her journal, annoyed. We see she hasn't been
text: writing but DRAWING. A well-executed sketch of a face.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Why do you keep calling me ma'am?
dialog: How old do you think I am, anyway?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I'm having a little problem here.
dialog: I'm trying not to freak out, but I
dialog: think something's happened to me.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Like, total memory loss. Complete.
dialog: I don't know how I got here.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: So you drank too much last night.
dialog: So did I. Unfortunately, I
dialog: remember the whole thing.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: That's not it. See... I'm a pilot.
dialog: I fly helicopters in Iraq. I'm in
dialog: the army.
text: She waits for more. As if he's telling a joke.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I was on a mission. Right before I
dialog: woke up here I was in the middle of
dialog: a mission...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
text: Wavering. Unsure of himself. His memories.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Boy, you really did drink a lot
dialog: last night.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I'm telling you the truth.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
text: Now approaching Newark Station.
text: Newark Station, next stop.
text: The train begins to SLOW DOWN. A few people begin to get up.
text: The platform of Newark Station slides into view.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: These aren't my clothes. And this
dialog: wallet here...
text: He holds up the driver's license. One final attempt to
dialog: convince her.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You see this? This isn't me.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Of course it is.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Take a look in the mirror, good
dialog: sir.
text: The mirror? She goes back to her sketchbook. Determined not
text: to be interrupted again. Anxiety ripples through Colter.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: This can't be happening.
text: The train lurches to a stop.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: Newark Station.
text: Colter gets up. Through the windows, a few passengers
text: disembark onto the platform: Derek, the Old Man, the College
text: Kid and GUZMAN, a Middle Eastern man, who HURRIES past all of
text: them towards the station building.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
text: Colter only half notices all this. He's intent on reaching
text: the train's BATHROOM, the door of which is now OPEN.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
text: All aboard. Doors are closing.
text: Christina watches Colter go. Curious.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
text: This is a New York bound train.
text: Next stop, New York - Penn Station.
text: The train begins MOVING. Colter reaches the bathroom.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING
text: A fluorescent light flutters on as Colter shuts the door.
text: He's in a tiny space with prefab restroom fixtures in
text: stainless steel.
text: He SHOUTS in surprise. Recoils backwards. Eyes locked on
speaker_heading: THE MIRROR
text: Staring back is SEAN FENTRESS'S FACE. Not his own.
text: He's frozen there. Heart pounding. Seized by cosmic panic.
text: He SLAPS himself in the face. Hard.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Wake up!
text: The restroom rattles and tilts with the motions of the train,
text: obliging him to hang on.
text: This isn't a dream. At least not one he can wake up from.
text: The other guy's face stares back at him. Blinks when he
text: blinks.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - MORNING
text: Warehouses go by in a blur. The train is entering New
text: Jersey's industrial zones on the outskirts of New York City.
text: From her seat, Christina stares at the messenger bag which
text: Colter left behind. Then up at the closed restroom door.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: BATHROOM DOOR
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
text: Her hand knocks.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Hey. You okay in there?
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Colter sits on the closed toilet seat. Head buried in his
text: hands. Scared. Desperate for it all to end.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - CONTINUOUS
text: Christina's holding Colter's messenger bag. She talks
text: through the closed door.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: You left your bag on the seat.
dialog: Which is a flagrant violation of
text: rail security, leaving a suspicious
dialog: package behind and all that. I
dialog: probably saved you a huge fine.
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: I'll just leave it right out here
dialog: for you.
text: She places the bag beside the door. She hesitates at the
dialog: door. The oddness of this situation.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Colter stares into the mirror at the stranger's face.
text: Practically catatonic at this point. And then her voice --
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA (O.S.)
dialog: If it'll help you remember, you've
dialog: been riding this train every
dialog: morning for three months.
text: Her words rouse him.
speaker_heading: COLTER
speaker_heading: (WHISPERS)
dialog: Three months?!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - CONTINUOUS
text: Christina's walking back down the aisle.
text: The car rocks to one side as an EXPRESS TRAIN flashes by on
text: the opposite tracks, going the other way. A blur and a
text: whoosh, and it's gone.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING
text: On the verge of opening the door, Colter hears a METALLIC
text: RATTLING. Two SCREWS are rattling around in the sink.
text: Colter picks up a screw. Turns it over and over in his hand.
dialog: What are they doing in the sink?
text: He looks UP.
text: An overhead VENTILATION PANEL has been PRIED OPEN. Above it
text: is the darkness of a CRAWL SPACE.
text: Something is sitting up there.
text: From outside comes a TRAIN HORN.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - MORNING
text: Through the windows, a FREIGHT TRAIN is passing the other
text: way. A moving wall of metal boxcars and liquid tankers.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING
text: Colter looks up into the crawl space. Can't quite see the
dialog: object up there.
text: Moving carefully in the tiny space, he stands up on the
text: toilet. Grabbing onto the ventilation panel, he WRENCHES IT
text: all the way open. Then PULLS himself uncomfortably upward.
text: On tip-toes, he looks into crawl space and discovers
speaker_heading: A MASSIVE BOMB
text: It's an enormous device. Several large CANNISTERS tied
text: together, full of sloshing liquid. Barely discernible behind
text: wires and gaffing tape is CELL PHONE -- the bomb's detonator.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Jesus.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
text: Running footsteps from outside. Commotion. An ALARM sounds.
scene_heading: THE BOMB'S CELL PHONE RINGS -- THE DEVICE'S CIRCUIT CLOSES --
text: THE BOMB EXPLODES IN COLTER'S FACE WITH A HUGE AND DEAFENING
text: FORCE, INSTANTLY KILLING HIM.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - CONTINUOUS
text: THE FIREBALL RIPS THROUGH THE CAR -- KILLING CHRISTINA AND
text: ALL THE OTHERS.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - MORNING
text: Fuel lines explode in the other cars in a horrendous chain
text: reaction. The fire is spectacularly bright, lighting up the
text: windows of the rowhouse apartments facing the tracks.
text: Nearby TREES INCINERATE, mere matchsticks amid sheets of
text: flames.
text: On the rowhouses, a ALUMINUM DOOR MOLDINGS begin to MELT in
text: the intense heat.
text: One of the FREIGHT CARS, loaded down with coal, shuddering
text: from the blast, wobbles a few yards then PITCHES OVER --
text: ROLLING off the rails, tipping right off the elevated
dialog: tracks...
text: It FALLS through the air and SMASHES into the middle of an
text: traffic intersection below with a shattering force.
text: The cascade of EXPLOSIONS continues. Large portions of BOTH
text: TRAINS are ANNIHILATED, while the heat reduces the heavy-
text: gauge steel rails back to elemental, molten ore.
dialog: And then...
text: An odd sound, like a BALLOON loosing air or MACHINERY winding
dialog: down as we
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: BRILLIANT WHITE. All sounds cease.
text: For exactly 1/3 OF A SECOND, a mysterious PATTERN OF LINES
text: appears. Like METAL RODS, maybe. RADIATING OUTWARDS. It
text: makes no sense. An abstract pattern.
text: Then it's gone. Many will not even see it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
text: Now there is only darkness. Nothingness. Seconds pass.
text: The CLICK of an INTERCOM switching on.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: This is Beleaguered Castle.
scene_heading: INT. ISOLATION UNIT
text: We're VERY CLOSE on Colter's UPSIDE DOWN face. His eyes
text: flutter open. He's surprised to find himself alive.
text: Consternation flashes through him as he discovers that he's
text: tightly strapped in. He now wears a military flight suit.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: Captain Colter Stevens, this is
dialog: Beleaguered Castle. Acknowledge
dialog: transmission.
text: The measured calm of a mission controller's voice comes over
text: Colter's headset.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: Captain Stevens, do you copy?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Where am I?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: You're with Beleaguered Castle.
text: PULL BACK, fractionally, to reveal Colter in a tight and
text: confined CAPSULE. It bristles with sophisticated electronics
text: and ghostly glowing diodes. He's like an astronaut in an
text: orbiter craft.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: Are you functional?
text: He tries to clear his head. He's still upside down.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I'm dizzy.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: Adjusting your rotation.
text: Very slowly, almost imperceptibly, Colter's upside-down face
text: begins to turn and right itself.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: Can you report at this time?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: What is this? Who am I talking to?
text: More confusion. No idea how to react. Just as on the train.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: Report what you saw.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: Just now.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I was on a train.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: And... There was a bomb.
speaker_heading: (PANICKING)
dialog: What the hell is going on?!
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: Just relax, Captain.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. ISOLATION UNIT
text: Later. We're still in the tiny chamber. It's stabilized.
text: As has Colter, but in the manner of a dangerous wild animal
dialog: given a sedative.
text: Embedded into the controls is a two inch-square VIDEO
text: MONITOR. It shows the face of GOODWIN. He's a middle-aged
dialog: communications officer. Although we know him as Goodwin, his
text: military name badge and rank insignia have been covered up.
text: He wears a headset and sits surrounded by banks of electronic
text: equipment and keyboards. He peers in at Colter, exuding the
text: blandness of a military flight controller.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Standby for thread one of alpha
dialog: memory pattern.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: You already have that information,
dialog: Captain. Now think. Recall my
dialog: name.
text: A long moment. A name floats into his head.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Goodwin?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Correct.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: How do I know that? I have no idea
dialog: how I know your name's Goodwin.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
text: Commencing memory pattern.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Listen to me. Something's wrong.
dialog: I was flying a mission. I was in a
dialog: chopper. Then I woke up on a
dialog: train. Now I'm here. Can you
dialog: explain that? What unit is this?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: You're with Beleaguered Castle.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: You're with friends.
speaker_heading: (PATIENTLY)
dialog: The exercises will assist you. Are
dialog: you ready?
text: Just like with the train, he seems to have no choice but to
dialog: go along with it.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Memory Thread One. Listen to the
dialog: following passage: "When Lily woke,
text: she had the bed to herself. She
text: sat up, bewildered by the
dialog: strangeness of her surroundings;
dialog: then memory returned, and she
text: looked about her with a shiver.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: GOODWIN (CONT'D)
text: In the cold slant of light
text: reflected from the back wall of a
text: neighboring building, she saw her
dialog: evening dress and opera cloak lying
text: on a tawdry heap on a chair." End
dialog: of thread one.
text: Silence. Is it Colter's turn to speak?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I don't get it. Is this a Red Flag
dialog: exercise?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Thread Two. Listen. I am holding
dialog: the following hand of cards: Queen
text: of spades. Four of clubs. Nine of
text: clubs. Three of hearts. Nine of
dialog: hearts.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I repeat: Queen of spades. Four of
dialog: clubs. Nine of clubs. Three of
dialog: hearts. Nine of hearts. End of
dialog: thread two.
text: Beads of sweat on Colter's forehead. What the hell?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Thread Three. The following is a
text: recording of a Western Screech-Owl:
text: A rather spooky BIRD CALL plays -- a short whistle, followed
text: by a long trill. The call is repeated twice more.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: End of Thread Three. End of
text: pattern. Acknowledge.
text: Unexpectedly, in the back of his mind, a reply is there.
speaker_heading: COLTER
text: A... Acknowledge. End of pattern.
dialog: How did he know to say that? A conditioned response?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Stand by to initiate pattern
dialog: recall.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Go for pattern recall.
text: The response comes to him more quickly. Like lines from an
text: old script. Even if it still baffles him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: The five playing cards. Arrange
dialog: them in order of descending values,
dialog: irrespective of suit.
text: He thinks for a moment. Focus. Play along. Maybe it will
dialog: all be okay.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Queen, two nines, four and a three.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: That is correct. The passage I
dialog: read contained mention of a woman's
dialog: name. What was that name?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Laurie.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: No. Lily. Her name was Lily.
text: At each answer, Goodwin makes notations and adjusts gauges.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: That is correct. End of pattern.
text: Goodwin leans forward to flip a switch and EVERYTHING GOES
speaker_heading: DARK.
scene_heading: INT. ISOLATION UNIT
text: Over DARKNESS, the SOUND of BACKGROUND CONVERSATION.
text: Engineers speaking in technical jargon.
text: Click. The unit's VIDEO MONITOR comes on again, illuminating
text: Colter in its glow. He's still strapped into the capsule.
text: The tiny monitor shows an out of focus view of a LAB. Like a
text: movie camera inadvertently left on between takes.
text: ENGINEERS wander past, oblivious. Their disjointed
text: conversations continue at low volume.
text: Abruptly, a MAN SMOKING A PIPE sits down in front of the
text: camera. His graying hair is windblown and unkempt. His eyes
text: are piercing blue. He wears a track and field warm-up
text: jacket. He looks in at us with an unsettling Cheshire-cat
text: grin. He puffs on his pipe. Winks. Pressing a button he --
text: Click -- shuts the whole thing off again. Sound and picture
text: vanish. Leaving us suspended.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 17.

text: An indeterminate amount of time has passed. Goodwin is back
text: on the monitor.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Please list the primary
dialog: specifications of the aerial
dialog: platform you've been trained to
dialog: operate.
text: Colter mulls his options. Should he talk? Keep silent? He
text: tugs against the steel harness holding him in. A HATCH, like
text: the kind used on submarines, seals the capsule.
text: Goodwin's voice grows slightly louder over his headset.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Please list the primary
dialog: specifications of the aerial
dialog: platform you've been trained to

speaker_heading: COLTER

text: The UH-60 Blackhawk Helicopter

dialog: them. Find the bomber.
text: ON SCREEN -- Goodwin leans forward to press a button and --
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 19.
text: Click. Everything goes dark. We HEAR Colter's nervous
text: BREATHING.
speaker_heading: COLTER (V.O.)
dialog: Hey. What's happening?
text: The HUM of machinery starting up.
speaker_heading: COLTER (V.O.)
dialog: Goddamn it, Goodwin, what is all
dialog: this?
text: The machinery HUM changes modulation. Then gives way to a
text: GENTLE ROCKING SENSATION. Tha-thunk. Tha-thunk. Tha-thunk.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - MORNING
text: Colter opens his eyes...
text: SUNLIGHT hits his face. In flickering patterns. He turns to
speaker_heading: LOOK OUT
scene_heading: A TRAIN WINDOW
text: At the passing woodland scenery.
text: He's back on the train. Back in the same navy sports coat.
text: Across from him, Christina is at work on her sketch pad.
text: Just like before. Other commuters all around him.
text: Everything is exactly the same as before.
dialog: Note: The remaining story will follow this "binary pattern."
text: Scenes will take place either on the train or in the capsule.
text: Compared to tomb-like isolation chamber he just came from,
text: the train is exploding with sensory input -- the smell of
text: steaming coffee, the cramped proximity of other passengers,
text: the crinkle of an freshly-ironed dress shirt, the glint of a
text: buckle on a purse, the slanting sunlight, the trees out the
text: window, bursting with summer leaves.
text: Almost unintentionally, Colter finds himself repeating the
text: same opening actions as last time -- checking his watch (7:40
text: a.m.)... turning at the scent of passing coffee... peeking in
text: the canvas messenger bag beside him...
text: This time, however, he takes the books out of the messenger
text: bag. The books are stamped "NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY."
text: He also takes out the APPLE. Sniffs it. Takes a bit. It's
dialog: good. No, it's awesome. Crisp and delicious.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 20.
dialog: Is Goodwin watching him from somewhere?
text: Not knowing what else to do, he takes a few more bites.
dialog: Enjoying this small pleasure.
text: He reaches in his sports jacket pocket and pulls out his
scene_heading: TRAIN TICKET.
text: CLOSE ON -- THE TICKET. It hasn't been punched yet.
text: CHK-THOCK! The Overweight Man opens his can of soda. Just
dialog: as before.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: It's a goddamn simulation.
text: Christina's pen stops sketching. She glances up.
speaker_heading: COLTER
text: A three dimensional, completely
dialog: immersive scenario. Touch, taste,
text: sound, sight and smell.
dialog: A measure of relief. A way to think about all this.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Are you talking to me?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Complete with pretty girl.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Pretty girl.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Every combat simulator has one. In
text: the middle of a fire fight a pop-up
text: window starts playing a porno.
speaker_heading: (CONFIDENT NOW)
dialog: You're an unusual choice for a
dialog: distraction.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: And you're a moron.
text: Disregarding her, Colter gets up. Pursuing a new line of
text: action. The only way he can make sense of this. He starts
text: walking up the rows.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Find the bomber. Find the bomber.
text: The conductor approaches him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: Ticket?
text: Expecting this now, Colter hands over his ticket to be
dialog: punched.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Everything okay today, chief?
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: Say what?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Anything out of the ordinary?
text: The conductor frowns at him. Who is this guy?
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: Please take a seat, sir.
text: Colter moves on. He looks for suspects. We've seen the
text: faces before -- the Computer Engineer, the Secretary, the
dialog: Stock Broker, the Backpacker and so on.
text: All seems normal. He finds himself focusing on a jumble of
dialog: unfiltered details -- Suits. Ties. Shoes. Skirts.
text: Watches. Newspapers. Coffee cups. Litter.
text: Sudden dizziness. He grabs a seatback for support. Sensory
text: details slam into him. We go EXTREMELY CLOSE ON:
text: The STITCHING on a leather purse.
text: A FOUNTAIN PEN rattling in a fold-out tray.
text: AIR CONDITIONING hissing from a vent.
text: A CRUMPLING SOUND as the Overweight Man crushes an empty soda
dialog: can.
text: TAP, TAP, TAP -- the Computer Engineer tapping his foot on
text: the floor. Faster and faster.
text: Derek, the Wall Street Type, talks on his phone:
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Trust me, by one o'clock, the
dialog: bridge is going to be jammed...
text: Then... the CLICK of a LOCK UNLATCHING.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 22.
text: The restroom door swings open. GUZMAN, the Middle Eastern
text: man, emerges. After a furtive glance around, he quickly
text: takes a seat.
text: Now Colter makes the connection. The bomb in the restroom.
text: The Middle Eastern man emerging from the same restroom.
text: Colter starts down the long aisle.
text: In his seat, Guzman slips on dark glasses. He looks
text: forbidding with his mustache and olive-colored skin.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: How's it going?
text: Colter stands in front of him, arms crossed. Behind his dark
text: glasses, Guzman ignores him, but he's visibly uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: What's your name?
text: Guzman is stock still. Beads of sweat on his forehead. The
text: conductor appears, accosting Colter.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: Didn't I tell you to take a seat?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Goodwin? Where are you? It's
dialog: over. I found him.
text: Appealing to Goodwin's invisible presence. But nothing
dialog: happens.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: Who are you talking to?
text: An edgy silence. Other passengers looking over. Colter's
text: about to retort, about to accuse Guzman, when he stops.
dialog: It's too easy.
text: Colter senses the uproar he's about to create. Which just
text: might be a mistake. He reconsiders.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Sorry. This guy seemed a little...
dialog: anxious. I was worried about him.
speaker_heading: GUZMAN
speaker_heading: (THICK ACCENT)
dialog: I am minding my business. Tell him
dialog: to mind his.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 23.
text: The conductor has noticed Guzman's white-knuckle uneasiness.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: You feeling all right, sir?
text: With a pained smile, Guzman loosens his collar.
speaker_heading: GUZMAN
dialog: Motion sickness, I'm afraid. I
dialog: believe I will get off at the next
dialog: stop.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: Very well.
text: The conductor turns back to Colter.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Okay. I'm sitting down.
text: Turning away, he finds a seat. He studies Guzman out of the
text: corner of his eye.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
text: Now approaching Newark Station.
text: Newark Station, next stop.
text: The train begins to slow down.
text: Several rows up, he sees Christina. She looks back at him
text: with distaste.
text: A small number of passengers get up, among them the College
text: Student. He catches Colter's attention as he picks up a
text: WALLET from a seat and catches up with Derek, the Stock
text: Broker, who's about to get off the train.
speaker_heading: COLLEGE STUDENT
dialog: Hey, you dropped this.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: (relieved, takes back the
speaker_heading: WALLET)
dialog: Wow. Thanks.
text: The College Student waits to get off. Colter now eyes him
dialog: closely.
text: As the train pulls to a stop, Guzman forcefully pushes
text: forward towards the doors, moving with a barely contained
dialog: urgency.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: GUZMAN
dialog: Excuse me... Please let me
dialog: through...
speaker_heading: COLTER
speaker_heading: (TO HIMSELF)
dialog: Jesus, he's running away.
scene_heading: EXT. NEWARK PLATFORM - MORNING
text: The doors slide open.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: Newark Station.
text: The Old Man, Derek and the College Kid get off. Guzman
text: hurries past them towards the station house.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
text: All aboard. Doors are closing.
text: Just before the doors close, Colter steps out onto the
text: platform. Eyes locked on Guzman -- who disappears inside the
dialog: station house.
text: The train PULLS OFF, leaving Colter behind. Did he make the
dialog: right move?
text: As he goes to pursue Guzman, Colter is struck by more sensory
speaker_heading: IMPRESSIONS:
text: The STATION CLOCK. Its digital numerals flash 7:50 a.m.,
text: hurting Colter's eyes with their brightness.
text: The dying HISS of the rails as the train recedes down the
dialog: track.
text: The super-sharp glint of a PENNY embedded down in the gravel
dialog: of the tracks.
text: The melancholy SIGH of trees in the wind.
text: Pushing it all aside, he hurries after Guzman.
scene_heading: INT. NEWARK STATION HOUSE - MORNING
text: Entering, Colter stops. There's no sign of Guzman. Just an
text: empty marble lobby. A lone CLERK restocks timetable
text: brochures at a display.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: A guy just came through here. Did
dialog: you see where he went?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (not looking up)
dialog: Lots of guys come through here.
text: Windows look out over the station's parking lot. There's no
text: sign of Guzman out there.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: He was just here. A Middle Eastern-
dialog: looking guy.
text: Through the platform doors comes Derek, followed by the
text: College Kid. Derek heads for the parking lot, while the
text: College Kid mills around the newspaper stand.
text: A muffled COUGH.
text: Colter spins. Sees a door marked "MEN'S ROOM."
scene_heading: INT. NEWARK STATION - MEN'S ROOM - MORNING
text: Pushing open the door, Colter discovers a row of 1930's-era
text: sinks and stalls. An intercom crackles to life:
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: The train to Philadelphia will be
text: four minutes late... The train to
dialog: Philadelphia will be four minutes
dialog: late...
text: Colter's footsteps echo down the length of the deserted men's
text: room. The last stall door is SHUT.
text: From within the closed stall, comes the sound of VOMITING.
text: Colter edges closer.
text: A toilet FLUSHES. Guzman emerges from the stall. Looks
text: awful. Freezes when he sees Colter.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: All better now?
text: Guzman's face hardens. He goes to the sink to wash his
dialog: hands.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Don't much care for trains myself.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 26.
text: The bathroom mirror, of course, reflects back Sean Fentress's
text: face, not Colter's. Guzman does not seem to notice this
text: disparity. He picks up his briefcase and briskly walks out.
text: Colter takes an uneasy look at Fentress looking back at him
text: in the mirror, then follows Guzman out.
scene_heading: INT. NEWARK STATION - MORNING
text: Colter emerges in the lobby. Guzman is nearby. A bit
text: indecisive. Colter wanders over to the newspaper stand.
text: The STATION CLOCK reads 7:54 a.m.
text: Colter looks down at HIS WATCH: THREE MINUTES remaining.
dialog: What will Guzman do?
text: Guzman glances over at Colter, then heads through the doors
text: and back out on the train platform.
scene_heading: EXT. NEWARK STATION - MORNING
text: Guzman sits on a bench. Colter stops nearby him.
speaker_heading: GUZMAN
dialog: I resent this. This is harassment.
dialog: You obviously work for someone.
dialog: FBI. CIA.
speaker_heading: (BITTER)
dialog: I expected this reception in your
dialog: country.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: How are you going to pull this off?
dialog: That bomb has a cell phone
dialog: detonator. And I don't see a pay
dialog: phone around here. So I'm betting
dialog: you got a phone on you with the
dialog: number already programmed in.
speaker_heading: GUZMAN
dialog: I have no idea what you're talking
dialog: about. I am an international
dialog: business man. An executive.
text: The tracks begin to VIBRATE. In the distance comes the HORN
text: of an EXPRESS TRAIN approaching.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Open your briefcase. Prove to me
dialog: there's no phone in there.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: GUZMAN
speaker_heading: (STANDS UP)
dialog: I will prove nothing to you. Leave
dialog: me alone.
text: WHAM! Colter PUNCHES Guzman with tremendous force, sending
text: Guzman sprawling to the ground.
text: Colter's hand throbs from the force of the punch. The
text: simulation's reality stuns Colter all over again.
text: Crouching down, Colter pops open Guzman's briefcase. Inside
text: is a corporate IDENTIFICATION BADGE with Guzman's name and
text: photograph on it. The company is Shell Oil.
speaker_heading: COLTER
speaker_heading: (READING)
dialog: "Hasnan Guzman, Vice President,
dialog: Shell Oil." Must be a cover.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
text: Philadelphia train now approaching.
text: Guzman groans in pain. Colter rifles through his briefcase.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Where the hell's your phone?
text: Another look at HIS WATCH -- 20 SECONDS.
text: Grabbing Guzman, Colter goes through his suit pockets. He
text: triumphantly pulls out GUZMAN'S CELL PHONE and steps back.
text: Guzman looks up at him, eyes moist with humiliation and
text: malice.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I thought so. Now let's see you
dialog: try to --
text: A distant THUD rattles the station windows. Colter pivots,
text: looks down the tracks. The first thing he sees is
speaker_heading: THE EXPRESS TRAIN
text: Closing in on the station.
text: The second thing he sees, far beyond it, miles further down
text: the tracks, is the RISING PLUME of a HUGE EXPLOSION.
text: Colter looks back at Guzman in shock. Then down at Guzman's
text: cell phone. Which has remained off.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You didn't do it.
text: Disbelief. As the din of the distant explosion is drowned
speaker_heading: out by the ROAR of
scene_heading: THE ARRIVING EXPRESS TRAIN
text: With a cry of rage Guzman SPRINGS UP and PUSHES COLTER INTO
text: THE PATH OF THE ON-COMING EXPRESS TRAIN -- with a blast of
text: its horn, THE TRAIN RUNS HIM OVER.
text: Everything stops.
text: Like film celluloid catching fire in a projector, the world
text: itself BLISTERS AND BURNS INTO SEARING WHITE... into
text: smothering, forgetful SILENCE...
dialog: For exactly 2/3 of a second (1/3 of a second longer than
text: before), the same flickering after-image appears:
scene_heading: THIN LINES -- RADIATING OUTWARD --
text: This time they all connect into
text: THE SPOKES OF A WHEEL. A BICYCLE WHEEL.
scene_heading: INT. ISOLATION UNIT
text: The SOUND of MACHINERY STRAINING. Colter is SLAMMED back
text: into his seat -- back in the capsule. All he can do is hang
text: on and gasp for air.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Holy fuck!
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: Stabilize. Lower your pulse.
text: Colter opens his eyes. He's back in his military flight
dialog: suit.
text: The craft goes still. Cautiously, he releases his hands from
text: their grip on the seat restraints. He looks like he's
text: sweated off five pounds.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Do you need to urinate?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: A fucking train just ran over me.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Do you need to urinate?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: How are you doing this? Am I on
dialog: some kind of drug?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Did you find the bomber?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I didn't find the bomber. You
dialog: fooled me with the Middle Eastern
dialog: guy. I went for the diversion.
dialog: What kind of freaky simulation is
dialog: this? Let me out of here!
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Which Middle Eastern guy? Be
dialog: specific.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Guzman. Shell Oil. Look, I don't
dialog: have intel experience. Why do you
dialog: have me doing this?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: You've already been told what you
dialog: need to know. Discipline your
dialog: memory. Limit your operational
dialog: awareness to the tasks we assign
dialog: you. Everything else is
dialog: irrelevant.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Irrelevant? Killing me each time
dialog: is irrelevant?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: You do not die. As you can see,
dialog: you simply return to us.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: How? How can you do that?
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Who's the man with the pipe?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Say again?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: There was a man smoking a pipe. I
text: saw him on the monitor. Who's he?
dialog: How does he fit into this?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: The man with the pipe isn't here
dialog: right now.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Let me talk to him. This isn't
dialog: right. I'm not your prisoner.
text: Goodwin makes technical adjustments to dials and gauges.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: You feel unsatisfied with our
dialog: relationship?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: What is this? Why are you talking
dialog: like that? Is this some kind of
dialog: script?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: If Guzman, the Middle Eastern man,
dialog: is innocent, as you maintain, who
dialog: might be the guilty party?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Who cares? I'm tired of this.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: This isn't a game, Captain.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Then what is it? Don't you already
dialog: know who the bomber is? Don't you
dialog: have all the answers?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
text: We have no answers. Only corpses.
text: A weird beat.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Corpses? Whose corpses? The
dialog: passengers?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Some were too badly burned to be
dialog: identified.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (CONT'D)
text: The heat from the explosion fused
dialog: many of them completely into the
text: wreckage.
text: Is this the truth? Or another evasive answer? His mind
dialog: pulled in all kinds of unpleasant directions.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: These were real people?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: This really happened?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Today.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Today?! The train blew up today?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: It was attacked this morning, at
text: 7:57 a.m., Eastern Standard Time.
text: Six miles outside of New York City.
text: Colter's head is spinning.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You're lying. I don't believe it.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: What do your senses tell you?
text: His senses tell him it's true. But how can he accept it?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Where am I, right now, as we speak?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: With Beleaguered Castle.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: My unit's still in Iraq. I'm
dialog: flying missions in Iraq. I flew
dialog: one yesterday!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Your unit was rotated Stateside
dialog: three weeks ago.
text: The news comes like a slap in the face. Colter clearly has
dialog: no memory of this.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Then why do I still have Iraqi dirt
dialog: underneath my fingernails?
text: Goodwin simply makes another adjustment on the controls.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Talk to me! Three weeks? I've
dialog: been back three weeks? How'd I get
dialog: in here? Have I seen my family?
dialog: Does my father know I'm home?
dialog: "Cause I'd kinda like to tell him
dialog: if that's the case.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Listen up, soldier.
text: Goodwin hunches forward, putting his elbows on his desk. As
text: he does so, he inadvertently reveals a glimpse of his
text: military unit SHOULDER PATCH. The insignia contains wings
text: and a lightning bolt against a background of stars.
text: Underneath it is written "CAOC-N."
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
text: The train is just the beginning.
dialog: Our intel says there are more
dialog: attacks are coming today. And
text: they're linked with the train.
dialog: Time is of the essence. Do you
dialog: understand?
text: Colter barely hears. He's fixated on that shoulder patch.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Captain?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I'm listening.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
text: D.N.I. Counterterrorism has come up
dialog: with the five most likely follow-up
text: targets in the New York area.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (CONT'D)
dialog: They are, in no order of
dialog: importance, the Holland Tunnel,
dialog: Newark International Airport, the
dialog: Brooklyn Bridge, Penn Station and
dialog: the Empire State Building. It
dialog: could be any of them, it could be
dialog: none of them. Whatever it is, if
dialog: you find the bomber and learn his
dialog: plan, the next one we might be in a
dialog: position to prevent. Those are
dialog: your orders.
text: It's too much information to process. Colter's head spins
dialog: with questions.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Wait. If I'm somehow on that train
dialog: before it blows up, why don't I
dialog: just dismantle the bomb?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Those are not your orders.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: But all those people dying...
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Those are not your orders. You are
dialog: not to influence events any more
dialog: than you need to in order to
dialog: accomplish your mission.
text: Military priorities. Defying comprehension.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I didn't volunteer for this shit.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Would you like to see the release
dialog: form you signed?
speaker_heading: COLTER
speaker_heading: (EXASPERATED)
dialog: How do I know it's real? How do I
dialog: know you didn't force me to sign
dialog: it? And how the hell can I be put
text: on a train over and over again -- a
dialog: train I never was really on?!
text: He might as well be talking to a wall.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I don't believe in time travel,
dialog: Goodwin. There's no such thing.

text: firing up.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Only one way forward, Captain.
dialog: Seventeen minutes. Find the truth.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Why seventeen? Why me? Why
dialog: anything?
text: The capsule begins to SHAKE.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Let me out! Don't send me back
dialog: there!
text: SFX: UP ON a HUGE ROAR as --
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - MORNING
text: THE TRAIN hurls down the tracks.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - MORNING
text: Landscape flies by. Colter's forehead rests against the
text: glass window. Piercing sunlight.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Shit. This is not happening.
text: He leans back in his seat, as if just another beaten down
text: office worker on the train.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Ain't life grand?
text: Across from him, Christina sketching. A gentle smirk. He
text: focuses in on her. Not knowing where else to begin.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You an artist?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: I went to art school. Doesn't make
dialog: me an artist.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Can I see what you're working on?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 35.
text: Her pencil pauses. She eyes Colter.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: I'd rather not.
text: He looks down at his watch. 7:41 a.m. He's been back for
text: one minute. Adjusting the settings, he changes the digital
text: display to COUNT DOWN the remaining SIXTEEN MINUTES.
text: He tries again for human contact.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You don't look like you belong
dialog: here. The way you're dressed.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: You certainly do.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I'd really like to see what you're
dialog: working on. Unless you're worried
dialog: I won't like it.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: It's private. And your opinion
dialog: doesn't interest me.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: So you scribble away on that thing
dialog: so as not to deal with people.
text: She scowls. Tosses the sketch pad onto his lap. Surprised,
text: Colter opens it. It's full of faces -- thumbnail portraits
text: of other passengers riding the train. They're exquisitely
text: observed, darkly stylized into expressions of loneliness.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: They're amazing.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: I wouldn't go that far.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Seriously, they're really good,

speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Christina.
speaker_heading: COLTER

dialog:

speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: All of them, practically.
text: She leans forward, eyes glinting conspiratorially.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: I know all about them.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You know all about them?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: I'm a collector of moments.
scene_heading: (DISCREETLY GESTURING)
dialog: That woman over there? She's a

dialog: houndstooth check suit every third
dialog: Wednesday. The nebbishy fellow

dialog: What about that guy?
text: Christina looks over Guzman.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: I haven't seen him before today.
speaker_heading: (LOOKING CLOSER)
dialog: He's cranky. Thinks the worst of
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Dangerous?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Everyone's dangerous.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You see anything unusual happen
dialog: this morning? Anything out of the
dialog: ordinary?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: I'm not sure I know what you mean.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Has anyone else come out of that
dialog: bathroom that you remember?
text: She takes a closer look at him. A puzzled smile.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Who are you?
text: Colter hesitates. Debating.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Don't you know? Haven't you seen
dialog: me here every day for, what, three
dialog: months?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Something's different about you
dialog: today.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: If I told you that there's a
dialog: terrorist on this train, that I was
dialog: sent here to catch him, would you
dialog: believe me?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
text: Most fervently.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Then tell me which one you'd
dialog: arrest.
text: Christina pages through her sketch pad again. Considering
dialog: different faces.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: They're all so utterly normal.
dialog: That's what's terrifying about
dialog: them. Perhaps there's more than
text: one. A team at work. The patent
text: attorney in cahoots with Julius
dialog: Caesar and the nebbishy guy. And
dialog: don't forget the sullen college
dialog: kid. He's the expendable one. But
dialog: they're all controlled by this good-
dialog: looking stock broker.
text: She shows him her sketch of Derek, the Stock Broker.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
text: Blond, blue eyed, hyper alert. The
dialog: perfect Machiavellian operative.
dialog: Out for himself. He'll betray them
text: all in the end.
text: She's not taking him seriously.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Never mind.
text: He gets up. Foolish of him to confide in her. His watch now
text: reads THIRTEEN MINUTES.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
text: Now approaching Newark Station.
text: Newark Station, next stop.
text: The train begins to slow. Derek, Guzman, the Old Man and the
text: College Kid head towards the exit doors.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
speaker_heading: (STAGE WHISPER)
dialog: He's getting away...!
text: Colter moves aside to let them walk past.
speaker_heading: COLTER
speaker_heading: (CURT DISMISSAL)
dialog: Thanks for your help, ma'am.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Ma'am? How old do you think I am?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I don't know. Thirty two?
text: Her icy glare tells him he's guessed too high.
scene_heading: EXT. NEWARK STATION - MORNING
text: The disembarking passengers exit the platform.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - MORNING
text: The train is moving again. In the exit area, Colter watches
text: the station disappear. He's doing this all wrong.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: Next stop New York Penn Station.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 39.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING
text: The two screws rattle in the sink. Colter gazes up at the
text: half-opened ventilation shaft -- and at the edge of the
text: sinister bomb planted there.
text: Back down to the mirror. Sean Fentress's face. The most
text: baffling mystery of all.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: What happened, Fentress? Who are
dialog: you? How can I be you?
text: FLASHCUT -- Back in the isolation unit. On the monitor, the
text: glimpse of Goodwin's SHOULDER PATCH INSIGNIA. The unit
dialog: initials "CAOC-N."
text: Back to scene. Colter churning over the thought.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: "CAOC-N." What unit is that?
text: A KNOCK on the door.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - MORNING
text: Through the windows comes the blur of the EXPRESS TRAIN
text: whizzing past (the same train which previously ran over
dialog: Colter).
text: Emerging from the bathroom, Colter discovers Christina there.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Who were you talking to?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Leave me alone.
text: Colter walks off. Irked at his change in tone, she follows
text: him, carrying his messenger bag.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: My pleasure, okay? It's just that
dialog: you left your bag on your seat.
dialog: (trying to be cute)
dialog: It's a flagrant violation of rail
text: security, leaving a suspicious
dialog: package behind and all that. Maybe
dialog: you're the terrorist.
text: This is too much. Colter turns on her. Paranoid.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Terrorist? Why did you say that?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: I was joking.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Stop joking. Who are you? Are you
dialog: an operative?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: I had no idea you were so
dialog: thoroughly weird. I'm not entirely
dialog: sure I like it.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Why do you have sketches of
dialog: everybody on board? Are you part
dialog: of this?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Part of what?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I can have you arrested. Maybe
dialog: that's the only way you'll drop the
dialog: bullshit and talk. Stay put. I'm
dialog: getting help.
text: She sees he's serious and drops her arch playfulness. Speaks
text: in a flat, sober voice.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Who am I? I'll tell you. I'm
dialog: twenty seven years old. I have no
dialog: savings and no health insurance.
text: He turns back. Waits. The more she speaks, the angrier she
dialog: gets.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Six months ago I moved back in with
dialog: my parents because I ran out of
dialog: money. I got A's in line drawing
dialog: and advanced oil painting but no
dialog: one's buying my stuff. Two weeks
dialog: ago I put away all my paints. My
dialog: little sketch book is the last
dialog: thing left. You see, I'm not a
dialog: artist. I'm a receptionist in a
dialog: law firm. The only thing I operate
text: is a phone switchboard.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 41.
text: The stark reality of her life.
text: The HORN of the FREIGHT TRAIN yanks his attention to the
text: windows. Up ahead are the row houses opposite which the
text: train exploded. Time is running down.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Now let me tell you about you. You
dialog: work at the New York Public
dialog: Library. You've been eyeing me for
dialog: months on this train but haven't
dialog: said a word to me. You're bland
text: and colorless and predictable. And
dialog: now I see you're delusional, too.
text: Colter doesn't hear her. He's still looking out the window.
speaker_heading: COLTER'S POV
text: Above the row houses, a COMMERCIAL AIRLINER is climbing
text: serenely into the blue after take-off out of Newark Airport.
text: The view is wiped away as the FREIGHT TRAIN comes surging
text: past the windows. But the sight of the plane has already
text: caused something to click in Colter's head.
speaker_heading: COLTER
text: Son of a bitch. "CAOC-N." That's
dialog: not army. That's Air Force.
dialog: Combined Air and Space Operations
dialog: Center. Nellis Air Force Base!
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Are you mocking me?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: They're running this whole thing
text: out of Nellis Air Force Base in
dialog: Nevada. Fucking Nevada!
text: Tears in Christina's eyes. That Colter would persist in this
text: delusion after what she's confessed about herself.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: (racking his brain)
dialog: What's there? What's on that base?
text: B-52s. KC tankers. Air Combat
text: Command. Predator Drones. Remote
dialog: operations.
dialog: (something to this)
dialog: This a remote operation.
speaker_heading: (FINALLY)
dialog: What if it is time travel?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 42.
text: A worried CONDUCTOR runs past them, talking rapidly into his
text: radio. We catch the words "bomb threat."
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: What did he say?
text: A WARNING ALARM begins beeping. Passengers look around
text: uneasily. Christina, however, focuses her anger on Colter.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Do me a favor. Don't ever talk to
dialog: me again.
text: She drops his messenger bag at his feet and walks away.
text: Colter looks down at his watch. THE LAST SECONDS TICK AWAY --
dialog: 5... 4... 3...
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Christina!
text: He grabs her -- she struggles against him --
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Get off me!
text: But he HOLDS HER TIGHT, shielding her with his body and
text: squeezing his eyes shut as --
text: THE EXPLOSION RIPS THROUGH THE TRAIN -- EVERYTHING VAPORIZES.
text: Blinding light. Painful to look at.
text: Like a star exploding.
text: A dull, hollow sound of WIND rattling through an abyss.
text: And then the ghostly still life. Details flicker into view:
text: A bicycle. A stone wall. And next to it...
text: A woman.
text: It's Christina. Turning to look at us. A gentle, reassuring
dialog: smile.
scene_heading: INT. ISOLATION UNIT
text: Click -- click. Click -- click. The video monitor is
text: malfunctioning. It flickers on and off, revealing Colter's
text: face in and out of darkness.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 43.
text: The capsule is nearly shut down. The controls appear non-
text: functional. Ice crystals have formed over the circuitry.
text: Colter hugs himself, shivering. His breath is visible in the
text: capsule's tomb-like cold.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Goodwin? What's happening? Come
dialog: in. Can you read me? It's goddamn
dialog: cold in here.
text: He hits a few buttons. Almost at random. The VENTS which
text: had been blowing in air FALL SILENT.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Goodwin, I'm losing oxygen.
text: The monitor fizzles out. The light from the controls FADES.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Goodwin!
text: It's now COMPLETELY DARK.
text: He BANGS on the side of the capsule. Just a muffled thump.
text: A terrifying silence.
text: The SNAP of a harness releasing. A THUD as Colter falls to
text: the floor of the capsule. Cursing. Some sounds of thrashing
dialog: around. Then...
text: The SPARK of a BLUE FLARE illuminates Colter's face. He's
text: activated a miniature signal light on his flight suit. It
text: begins to BLINK. Like a beacon for downed pilots afloat in
text: the sea. It is the only light in the otherwise dead capsule.
text: Up on his knees, he grasps the release handles of the EXIT
text: HATCH. Using all his strength he TURNS...
text: But the handles don't budge. The hatch remains sealed.
text: He gets to his feet. Can't stand up fully. The capsule is
text: incredibly cramped.
text: Rifling through a cabinet, he discovers OPERATIONAL MANUALS
text: in small, almost illegible type. And a small set of TOOLS.
text: He spreads them out on the tiny ledge. Taking a wrench, he
text: BANGS on the escape hatch. A deep, clanging ECHO in the
dialog: hull.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 44.
text: So, like any pilot would, he sets about repairing his craft.
text: At first he puzzles over the electronics and circuitry.
text: Daunted by the complexity.
text: There's no time to lose. Using a miniature screw driver, he
text: begins unscrewing the monitor panel. His fingers are slow
text: and clumsy in the frigid cold and the screw driver slips out
text: of his hands.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Icicles have appeared over dormant air vents. Colter, ice
text: crystals in his hair, is shivering more violently. Much of
text: the capsule's electronics lay open and exposed.
text: Using copper wires, he's attempting to revive a row of
text: BATTERIES. They spark once... twice... Nothing.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Come on!
text: Another SPARK. It shocks him. There's a puff of blue smoke.
dialog: He's burned his fingers.
text: But the battery now has a tiny BLINKING GREEN LIGHT.
text: Working fast, Colter attaches the copper wires to the leads
text: on the battery. From inside the engines comes a faint
text: electric HUM.
text: FFFT. The monitor awakens. Like a film projector it throws
text: the image of a PLAYING CARD onto the opposite side of the
dialog: craft.
text: Colter begins replacing the monitor components. As he does,
text: a pre-recorded AUDIO FILE comes on:
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: -- four principle dialects of
dialog: Arabic: Egyptian, Gulf, Syrian-
dialog: Lebanese and North African. We
dialog: will now play you portions of each,
dialog: discussing the audible differences
dialog: between them.
text: CLIPS of SPOKEN ARABIC begin to play.
text: Colter continues reconstituting the computer. The monitor
text: fills with scrolling lines of COMPUTER CODE.
text: With an oddly low-tech CLANG, the heart of the machine
text: reawakens. The air vents come back to life. Heat starts to
text: return. The icicles begin to DRIP.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 45.
text: Colter sits back in his seat, exhausted from the work.
text: The monitor switches to a real-time view of the LAB.
text: Goodwin's chair is there, but Goodwin is not in sight. In a
text: background distorted by the FISH-EYE LENS, various
text: technicians wander by.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Hello? Anyone out there? It's me.
text: He toggles an audio jack. Then a MAN comes walking up.
text: Frowns into the camera, as if through the foggy lens of
dialog: another world.
text: It's the MAN WITH THE PIPE. The elusive Bohemian scientist
text: whom Colter glimpsed once before. He will be known as
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Can you hear me?
text: Rutledge is tinkering with the camera. The image shakes for
text: a moment as he adjusts it. Then puts on a headset.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: Project designer initiating
text: sequence and drives check.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I'm here! I'm okay!
text: Rutledge checks his headset. Not sure he heard right.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: Is someone there?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Yeah. It's me. Colter.
text: Rutledge blinks in surprise. The blue eyes sparkling.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: Wow! It's you.
speaker_heading: COLTER
text: The capsule lost power. It's still
dialog: pretty cold in here.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: We've been working towards you from
dialog: the other side. Nice to have you
dialog: with us again. You feeling all
dialog: right?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I think so. Who are you?
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
text: The name's Rutledge.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: They wouldn't let me talk to you
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: No, I guess not. They're pretty
dialog: anal around here.
dialog: (lights his pipe)
dialog: Don't tell them you saw me smoking
dialog: in here, okay?
text: His genial eccentricity is completely at odds with the
text: military environment. And then it occurs to Colter:
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You're the inventor of this thing.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
speaker_heading: (SHRUGS)
dialog: I prefer the term project designer.
dialog: And sorry for all the secrecy.
dialog: Goodwin will be thrilled you re-
dialog: established contact.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I don't want to deal with Goodwin
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Don't you understand? He's
dialog: torturing me. I'm helpless. Can't
dialog: you get me out of here?
text: Rutledge looks uneasy. As a scientist, he's ill-equipped to
dialog: deal with personnel issues.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: Why would Goodwin have it in for
dialog: you?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: He's a remote operator. And remote
dialog: operators are risk averse pussies
text: who sit at control screens in the
dialog: rear while actual pilots like me
dialog: put their asses on the line in the
dialog: field.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: He seems pretty devoted to the
dialog: mission.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: And just what kind of mission is
dialog: this? Talk to me, man. Why won't
dialog: he let me save those people on the
dialog: train?
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: Because they can't be saved.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Why not? I know what's going to
dialog: happen. I could take apart the
dialog: bomb. Stop the train.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: Yeah but you'd be doing it in the
dialog: Source Code, not here. Not in our
dialog: own past.
text: Mystery upon mystery.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: What's the difference?
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: I'm not sure I should be telling
dialog: you this.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Telling me what?
text: Coaxing the scientist in him.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: It's quantum physics. Linear
dialog: algebra. Parabolic calculus. It
dialog: would take weeks to explain.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Is Source Code time travel?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 48.
text: Rutledge sighs. Looks at his pipe.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
text: It's gone out again.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Why can't I save those people on
dialog: the train?
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: Think of it like this: events in
dialog: our past can never be undone.
dialog: Einstein proved that.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: So...
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: So Source Code opens up another
dialog: past for you. A parallel past. It
text: looks the same but it has no
dialog: intersection with our own world.
dialog: In essence, by sending you back, an
dialog: entirely new but utterly parallel
dialog: world is created. It looks
dialog: identical to ours, but nothing you
dialog: do there has any effect on this
dialog: reality.
text: At last some useful information. Colter races to process it.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: What happens to the Source Code
dialog: world after I leave it?
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: I don't know. You can never know
dialog: that because you're not there to
text: observe it. Maybe it vanishes.
dialog: Maybe not.
speaker_heading: (UNEASY)
dialog: I should tell them you're okay.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: What about the bicycle?
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: What bicycle?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I see it each time. Right after
text: the bomb goes off. Like an after
dialog: image.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: COLTER (CONT'D)
text: There's a bicycle and a stone wall
dialog: and a girl. It's a girl from the
dialog: train. I don't know where any of
dialog: it is supposed to be, but --
text: Rutledge removes the pipe from his mouth.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: Wait. You see all this after you
dialog: leave the train?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Yeah. Just for a split second.
text: Rutledge is stunned. Like he's discovered some strange new
dialog: property to his invention.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: Please tell me you're not making
dialog: this up.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: No. It's there. What do you think
dialog: it means?
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: I don't know.
text: Rutledge looks off camera for a moment.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: They're here. There's no more time
dialog: to talk.
speaker_heading: (QUICKLY)
dialog: Make sure he sends you back in.
dialog: Find out about the after images.
text: Goodwin appears. Rutledge reluctantly takes off his headset.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Rutledge, wait. Don't leave me.
text: Rutledge steps away. A pointed look at Colter. Goodwin
text: settles back into his seat, donning the headset.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Welcome back. How are you feeling?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I'm alive. No thanks to you.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: You find the bomber?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You're a brick wall, Goodwin. A
dialog: fucking brick wall.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Lower your pulse. The situation
text: has worsened. The fire on the
dialog: tracks caused one of the freight
dialog: cars to blow up and release some
dialog: kind of gas. As a precaution
dialog: they're having to evacuate all of
dialog: lower Manhattan.
dialog: Evacuate lower Manhattan? The enormity of this. Having to
dialog: take it on faith.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: We may have lost the initiative.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: What do you mean? Let's keep
dialog: going.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: We were expecting more from you.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I can give you more. Let me think
dialog: for a second.
text: But Goodwin ignores him. Absorbed in paperwork.
speaker_heading: COLTER
text: The freight car blows up from the
text: fire. It spews gas, or what could
dialog: be gas -- it might be chlorine, so
dialog: they can't take any chances.
text: Anxious now. Trying to make up lost ground. Whatever it
text: takes to get sent back in.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: So they decide to play it safe and
dialog: evacuate parts of New York City.
dialog: And maybe that's part of the
dialog: terrorists' plan, right?
speaker_heading: (THINKING)
dialog: So... so who benefits from that?
dialog: What's vulnerable? What's down
dialog: there in lower Manhattan?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Wall Street.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 51.
text: Surprising himself with this insight.
text: And now Goodwin is paying attention again. Waiting for more.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Wall Street. That's what they're
dialog: going to hit next. The financial
dialog: markets.
text: Goodwin considers this. For the first time, slightly
dialog: impressed.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: I want to show you something.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: DRIVERS LICENSE PHOTOS
text: The video monitor shows CHRISTINA's DMV shot. Her wry,
text: secretive smile.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Did she die, too?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Yes. This drivers license photo
dialog: was found with her body. We're
dialog: creating a database of recovered
text: identifications as they come in
dialog: from the site.
text: A pang of sorrow. Moving among ghosts.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You sure she's dead?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Would you like to see her morgue
dialog: photos?
speaker_heading: COLTER
speaker_heading: (QUIETLY)
text: She was sitting across from me.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: We know.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: This was taken shortly after the

text: The TIME CODE on the image reads 8:26 a.m.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: We noted the location of each
dialog: corpse when we pulled it out.
text: On screen, rescue workers pull a CHARRED CORPSE out of the
text: wreckage.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: Prepare yourself. This is unedited
dialog: footage.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I told you I didn't want to see
dialog: her!
text: The camera ZOOMS IN on a corpse. Its burned face, like a
text: piece of rotted fruit, fills the screen. Nevertheless, we
text: recognize it. And it's not Christina. It's someone else.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: That's...
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: Sean Fentress.
text: The man in the mirror. Himself, at least on the train.
speaker_heading: COLTER
text: He died on the train.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
text: As a host identity, Sean Fentress
dialog: had to have certain basic
dialog: similarities to you. Gender.
dialog: Blood type. Approximate age. His
dialog: head was still intact. We need the
dialog: head, you see. To link the two of
dialog: you remotely.
text: They carry the corpse towards a MORGUE TRUCK with a vast
text: array of SATELLITE COMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT attached to it.
dialog: 
dialog:

text: The image freezes, then DISSOLVES back to Christina's DMV
dialog: photo.
text: Silence. Pondering.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Would you like to see the other
dialog: passenger photos? Perhaps that
dialog: would help you.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You still have Christina's body?
dialog: The other things she was carrying?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I want to know about her.
dialog: Everything I can. She's not just
dialog: another victim. She's connected to
dialog: all this.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - MORNING
text: The rich smell of steaming coffee. The glint of a polished
text: leather shoe. The crisp click of someone uncapping a
text: fountain pen. The scenery rushing by -- the blur of trees,
text: the soft lavender of the morning sky. The swell and pull of
text: the mighty machine coursing over the rails.
dialog: If a train ride could ever be a sensory delight, this is it.
text: To Colter, every sensation has become even more pronounced,
text: more intensely real than ever.
text: CLOSE ON - HIS WATCH - A beep as he sets it to countdown
text: again from seventeen minutes. The duration of his freedom.
text: Across from him is Christina. Absorbed with her sketching.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Thirty six dollars and eleven

text: She looks up at him.
speaker_heading: COLTER

speaker_heading: CHK-THOCK!
text: The Overweight Man opens his soda can. She gives Colter a
text: quizzical look. He points out the window. They're passing a
text: neighborhood of modest homes.
speaker_heading: COLTER
text: We're about to pass a street with
dialog: willow trees. Two girls will be
text: jumping rope. A white dog's going
text: to run out behind them. A
dialog: Dalmatian mix.
text: In a moment, they pass a scene exactly as Colter described.
text: Christina's befuddled smile.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: You want to tell me how you're
dialog: doing this?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Close observation. You could say
dialog: I'm a collector of moments.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: A collector of moments?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: That's the cheesiest line I've ever
dialog: heard.
text: She resumes her drawing.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You trained to be an artist.
dialog: No response.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You got A's in line drawing and oil
dialog: painting. But your work didn't
dialog: sell. You took a job answering
text: phones in a law firm.
speaker_heading: (MORE)

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: COLTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Six months ago you moved back in
dialog: with your parents. Two weeks ago
dialog: you put your paints away for good.
dialog: The sketch book is all you have
dialog: left.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Who the hell are you? Who have you
dialog: been talking to?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Me? No. I haven't ever talked to
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: But we have, Christina. You've
dialog: drawn all these people here. You
dialog: know their routines. At one point
dialog: you thought you were different from
dialog: all of them. But now you're not so
dialog: sure.
text: Christina has gone white. Utterly incredulous.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN DINING CAR - MORNING
text: A small bar area. Coffee sloshing in styrofoam cups Colter
text: hands one to Christina and sits down opposite her. A glance
text: at his watch shows TWELVE MINUTES left.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Okay, you've got my attention. Now
dialog: tell me what this is all about.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I need your help.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Are you selling something?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Listen to me. I can't use up any
dialog: more time trying to convince you.
dialog: I just need you to believe
dialog: everything I'm about to tell you.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: This better be good.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Bear with me.
dialog: (beat, where to begin?)
dialog: Your sketch book. Is there a
dialog: drawing of me in there?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: I'm not sure.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Please, Christina.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Yes, fine! Here.
text: She flips through it. Shows him a sketch of SEAN FENTRESS.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: I did it last week.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: The thing is, that's not me.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Give me a little credit.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: No. You drew what you saw, but the
dialog: person you're seeing now is someone
dialog: else. I'm not Sean Fentress. I'm
dialog: not really on this train.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
speaker_heading: (INCOMPREHENSION)
dialog: You're not really on this train.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I'm taking someone's place.
dialog: Borrowing it. My name is Colter.
dialog: I'm a soldier. And I'm being held
dialog: prisoner. And this is the only way
dialog: -- the only time and place I have --
dialog: to figure out how to escape.
text: She gives him a blank look.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: After three months of riding the
dialog: train, this is how you introduce
dialog: yourself to me?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I'm serious. Elements in the
dialog: American military are using me for
dialog: an experiment. I'm not sure
dialog: exactly how it all happened, but
dialog: I'm at a facility on Nellis Air
dialog: Force Base in Nevada. Right now.
dialog: As we speak. It's a project called
dialog: Source Code.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Source Code.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: It's a program. It shifts
dialog: identities. It also performs small
dialog: amounts of time travel. Or "time
dialog: engineering." I don't know the
text: jargon.
text: He's not getting through to her. It's too bizarre.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I've been put on this train to look
dialog: for someone. A criminal. And I
dialog: need to find out just enough about
dialog: him to keep them putting me back on
dialog: this train. Because right here's
dialog: only place I can figure out what's
dialog: really happening. But I have very
dialog: little time. And each time I come
dialog: back, you won't remember me and
dialog: I'll have to go through this all
dialog: over again.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: You are, I think, deliciously mad.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Then how do I know all those things
dialog: about you if we've never spoken
dialog: before?
text: She doesn't have an answer. Can't easily dismiss him.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Why tell all this to me? There's
dialog: lots of people around for you to
dialog: talk to.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Because I think you have the answer
dialog: to this whole thing.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Believe me, I don't have the answer
dialog: for anything.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: There's a vision. I keep having
dialog: it. It's very powerful. And
dialog: you're in it. And there's a
dialog: bicycle. And this... old stone
dialog: wall. And it's very peaceful.
dialog: Does this sound familiar? Like
dialog: where you live, maybe?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Stone walls? My parents live in a
text: house with aluminum siding and an
text: American eagle over the door. The
dialog: only bike is a Harley which the guy
text: down the street revs at three in
dialog: the morning.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: The vision must mean something.
dialog: It's the only time when I'm not on
dialog: the train or in the capsule. Why
dialog: else would Rutledge be so
dialog: interested?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Who's Rutledge?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Someone who was trying to help me
dialog: understand something. Until they
dialog: got to him.
text: He lowers his head. A dead end. No answer. The train
text: begins to slow down.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
text: Now approaching Newark Station.
text: Newark Station, next stop.
text: Colter looks at HIS WATCH. Ten minutes left.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: I saw a program on TV. It was
dialog: about psychics. They say psychics
dialog: have a lot of paranoia.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I don't believe in that shit.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: Newark Station.
text: Through the window, the Old Man, Derek and the College Kid
text: disembark. Guzman hurries past them to the station house.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
text: All aboard. Doors are closing.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Don't you have people you can go to
dialog: for help? Friends, family?
text: The train begins to move again.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
text: This is a New York bound train.
text: Next stop, New York - Penn Station.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Most of my friends are in the
dialog: military. My dad runs a melon farm
dialog: in Alabama.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Maybe now's the time to reach out
dialog: to him.
text: She hands him her cell phone. Colter just holds it in his
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Me and my dad, we don't see eye to
dialog: eye. We're just two different
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: As opposed to being the exact same
dialog: person?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Are you always this sarcastic?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: This is so not about me.
text: Colter reluctantly dials. As it rings --
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: What day is it?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: June 11th.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: June?
dialog: One more thing to puzzle him.
text: The call connects. An OLDER MAN, DONALD STEVENS, answers.
text: The gravelly voice of a Midwestern farmer.
speaker_heading: DONALD (V.O.)
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Dad?
text: Donald doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Dad, it's me. It's Colter.
text: Again, silence.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Been a while, huh? I'd been
dialog: meaning to call you, but --
text: Click. The line goes dead. Colter looks at Christina.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: He wanted me to stay on and take
dialog: over the farm but... I had other
dialog: ideas.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: You're intimidated by him.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: You're scared of him. I can see
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: The hell I am.
text: Challenged, he redials. Braced for conflict. The call
dialog: connects.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Dad, don't hang up. We're going to
dialog: talk. I need your help.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: DONALD
speaker_heading: (CONTROLLED ANGER)
dialog: Now you listen to me. Whoever you
dialog: are, never call here again.
text: Donald hangs up.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: He's still mad at you, huh?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: No... it was like he didn't even
dialog: know who I was.
text: Troubled, he hands back her phone. Outside, the EXPRESS
text: TRAIN flashes by.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: I don't know how to help you.
text: She feels bad for him. And something inside Colter closes.
text: Retreating inside himself.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Sorry to have bothered you.
text: He gets up to go. Christina stays where she is.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - MORNING
text: Back in his seat. Lost in the view out the window. The
text: neighborhoods have given way to Newark's industrial fringe.
text: Bringing him closer to the inevitable end.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA (V.O.)
dialog: I have a friend.
text: Surprised, he turns to find her there.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
text: She works at the New York Times.
dialog: Her name's Stephanie. She's just a
dialog: proofreader, but she wants to be
dialog: made a reporter. She's always
dialog: saying she needs a good story to
dialog: bring in so she gets noticed.
dialog: Something like this, with a crazy
dialog: paranoid angle could really
dialog: interest her.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Forget it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: She could do some poking around.
text: She's already quite suspicious of
dialog: the government.
text: Christina's dialing her phone. Colter turns back to the
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: I'm getting voice mail.
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: Steph, it's Christina. You know
dialog: that story you're always looking to
dialog: write? I might just have something
dialog: for you. I met a guy. His name is
dialog: Colter Stevens. He says he's in
text: the army. He flies helicopters in
dialog: Iraq, but now they've put him into
dialog: a secret project called Source
dialog: Code. Maybe you can look into it a
dialog: bit, okay? Call me.
text: She hangs up. Pleased with herself.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: She'll call back. Just wait.
text: None of it will do Colter any good, but he manages a smile.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Thank you, ma'am.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
speaker_heading: (LAUGHS)
dialog: Ma'am? How old do you think I am?
text: He gives her a wary look. Considers.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Twenty five?
text: She smiles, pleased.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: No, but thanks.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: What did you mean, there's a
dialog: criminal on the train? How do you
dialog: know that?
text: Colter looks away. Careful.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I just do.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: How can I help you if you don't
dialog: tell me everything about this?
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING
text: Colter enters the tiny space. Christina is reluctant to
text: follow him into the bathroom.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You said you wanted to know.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Can't you just tell me?
text: He gives her an imploring look. She sighs and squeezes in
text: next to him.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Try anything and I'll kill you.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Shut the door.
text: As she shuts the door, Colter gets up on the sink.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: What are you doing?
text: He wrenches back the ventilation panel, then steps aside.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: It's up here.
text: He holds out his hand. She grabs hold and steps up on the
text: sink. She's not quite tall enough to see into the
text: crawlspace, so he steps up behind her and lifts her the rest
dialog: of the way.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
text: (startled, feels his hands
speaker_heading: ON HER)
dialog: What are you --
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Just look.
text: Her blouse brushes his face as he holds her up. A long beat
text: as she looks inside the overhead space at the bomb.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Is that...?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Acetone Peroxide. It's a liquid
dialog: explosive. There's fourteen
dialog: cannisters of it. Simple
dialog: detonator. Cell phone signal
text: closes the circuit and boom.
text: He lowers her. An incredulous beat.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Did you put this here?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: No. It was someone else. They
dialog: don't know who. That's why I'm
dialog: here. To find out.
dialog: Watching her. Will she believe him?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: We have to tell someone. We have
dialog: to stop this.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - MORNING
text: The bathroom door opens and Christina walks quickly away.
text: Mounting fear. Colter falls into step behind her.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: It won't matter. The train's
dialog: already...
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Already what?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I've been sent here. It sounds
dialog: crazy, but it's true. I've been
dialog: sent from the future -- from five
dialog: hours in the future. This train's
text: already been blown up.
text: She backs up. Scared of him. Every right to be.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You wanted to know. Now you know.
text: She turns and hurries for the exit doors.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: This isn't happening. I've got to
dialog: get off.
text: Colter catches up with her inside the exit vestibule. She's
text: stabbing at the door release button.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Why won't it open?!
text: Her phone is RINGS. They both stop. She looks at the
dialog: number.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: It's Steph.
speaker_heading: (HOLLOW)
dialog: I told you she'd be interested.
speaker_heading: (ANSWERS)
dialog: Hi.
text: Her eyes are fixed suspiciously on Colter as she listens.
text: Colter looks outside. Recognizes the terrain. Looks down at
speaker_heading: HIS WATCH --
speaker_heading: 50 SECONDS.
text: It's awful. Unbearable. He dashes towards the bathroom --
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING
text: Tears open the door. Jumps up on the sink.
speaker_heading: THE BOMB
text: Sits in the semi-darkness, faintly illuminated by the
text: bathroom's fluorescent light. As he grabs hold of the bomb,
dialog: he hears --
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA (O.S.)
dialog: Colter...?
text: Working fast, he unhooks the leads on the detonator, rips
text: away gaffing tape -- jostling the cannisters of explosives --
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA (O.S.)
dialog: Colter, I have to tell you
dialog: something.
text: -- and pulls off the detonator cell phone. Ducking back
text: down, he see Christina standing in the doorway.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Look. Now the fucking thing can't
dialog: go off.
speaker_heading: HIS WATCH
text: Reads 20 SECONDS.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
text: Stephanie did a computer search.
text: Something in her expression worries him.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: She's got a database of all
dialog: newspaper articles going back to
dialog: forever.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Source Code's classified. It
dialog: wouldn't be in a newspaper.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: No. But you were. She found you.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: She found me? What does that mean?
text: She stops. Not wanting to go on.
text: From outside comes the HORN from the approaching freight
dialog: train.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Jesus Christ, Christina, are you
dialog: going to spit it out?
text: In his hand, the CELL PHONE RINGS. Colter's eyes light up in
text: amazement -- the DISPLAY SCREEN is showing the name and
text: number of the bomber. But before he can read what's there,
text: Christina's voice finds its way to the back of his brain:
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: According to the notice, you were
dialog: killed in action two months ago.
text: The world stops.
text: A SEARING PAIN SLAMS INTO him. He drops the phone and
text: doubles over. She runs to him --
speaker_heading: COLTER'S POV
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 67.
text: Everything around him PIXELATES into a hundred thousand
text: POINTS on an array. Christina's cries become bursts of
text: static. Flying behind the array come LINES OF COMPUTER CODE -
dialog: - the Source Code architecture laid bare.
text: And then the screen itself seems to melt, giving way to a
text: frightening series of HALLUCINATORY FRAGMENTS:
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER - DAY
text: A PILOT'S P.O.V. -- desert sand, searingly bright -- flight
text: deck instrumentation -- a windshield pockmarked with bullet
text: holes -- the horizon tilting as the helicopter PLUNGES
text: towards earth amid a chaos of RADIO TRANSMISSIONS:
dialog: "...taking a lot of RPG fire... be advised A61 is going
dialog: down... A61 is going down hard..."
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - DAY
text: Black smoke. Boots crunching on sand as we are borne,
text: P.O.V., a victim on a jostling stretcher.
scene_heading: INT. MEDIVAC HELICOPTER - DAY
text: Airborne again. The thud of rotors. Through blurred vision
text: we see medics working furiously to save a life.
scene_heading: INT. C5 TRANSPORT JET - DAY
text: The smooth, glassy calm of 30,000 feet. The regular
text: pulsations of a VENTILATOR. Fluids drip down through an IV
text: bag. Tubes and monitors stacked all around us. Gurneys of
text: other wounded packed together. The grumble of another,
text: unseen wounded soldier:
speaker_heading: SOLDIER (O.S.)
dialog: Never any damn leg room on a plane.
text: An ALARM begins beeping.
speaker_heading: FLIGHT MEDIC (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, this guy's crashing...
text: FADE TO BLACK.
text: Silence and darkness. Nothingness.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 68.
text: Then, a PLAYING CARD appears, as if through a slide
text: projector. The Jack of Clubs.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: Captain...?
text: The playing card flickers, separates into pixels, then
text: dissolves.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: Captain, allow me to introduce
dialog: myself. My name is Goodwin.
dialog: You're with Beleaguered Castle.
dialog: You are safe. All your needs will
dialog: be met here.
text: Lines of computer code flit across the screen. A blinking
text: cursor.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
text: A tiny APERTURE opens... revealing CHRISTINA. And the
text: bicycle. And the stone wall. The strange, recurring vision.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: Captain?
text: The sound drives away the image, replacing it with
scene_heading: THE JACK OF CLUBS
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: Captain, just tell me what you see.
dialog: Just look and speak.
text: Groggy breathing. A ragged voice:
speaker_heading: COLTER (V.O.)
dialog: I see a card.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: Very good. Very, very good.
scene_heading: INT. ISOLATION UNIT
text: On Colter's face. A deep, cold knot in his stomach.
text: Shuddering in fear. The truth before him now. Crouching
text: there, a nightmare, ruling over him.
text: On the MONITOR, Goodwin looks into the camera. Assessing the
dialog: situation.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Are you comfortable? Are you warm?
text: Colter clings to his harness as if to keep from vanishing
text: entirely from existence.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Do you need to urinate?
text: Colter swallows. Too terrorized to speak.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
text: Beleaguered Castle is waiting for
dialog: your report.
text: Goodwin taps his pen on his clipboard. Impatient. He flips
text: a switch. A blocky COMPUTER VOICE, something out of the
dialog: 1970s, comes on:
speaker_heading: COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Hearing Test. First sequence.
text: Left ear.
text: A short SERIES of ELECTRONIC TONES.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Hearing Test. First sequence.
dialog: Right ear.
text: The tones cease. Colter remains impassive and inert.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Captain, I know you can hear me.
dialog: Did you find the bomber?
text: Goodwin keys in some commands. Forever adjusting.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Memory Thread One: "When Lily woke,
text: she had the bed to herself. She
text: sat up, bewildered by the
dialog: strangeness of her surroundings;
dialog: then memory returned, and she
text: looked about her with a shiver."
text: Goodwin stops the audio.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: As you're collecting your thoughts,
dialog: I should tell you there's been
text: another development. A terrorist
dialog: group has taken responsibility for
text: bombing the train.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (CONT'D)
dialog: This began broadcasting over the
dialog: Internet a half hour. We've traced
dialog: it to central Asia.
speaker_heading: ON THE MONITOR
text: A grainy VIDEO shows an arid, wind-swept plateau of a far-
text: away desert. It is twilight. A MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTER, his face
text: hidden by a hooded cloak, sits cross legged before a
text: flickering camp fire and a tea service.
text: The fighter rises, picks up a rocket-propelled grenade
text: launcher, and approaches the camera. The wind whips his
text: black robes. The figure looks slight. Almost spectral. It
text: begins speaking to the camera.
scene_heading: MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTER
dialog: (on camera, in accented
speaker_heading: ENGLISH)
dialog: By now you have suffered a taste of
dialog: divine vengeance. God willing, you
dialog: will soon suffer another.
text: Colter does not raise his head. No idea whether he's even
dialog: listening.
scene_heading: MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTER
dialog: These attacks will show you that
dialog: you will never be safe. You can
dialog: secure your borders. But what can
dialog: you do against one of your own
dialog: citizens? One who looks like you,
text: who is blameless, living already
dialog: among you, who takes eighty million
dialog: of our dollars, a trifle, and
dialog: carries out our bidding? You
dialog: cannot stop this. Time has run
dialog: out.
text: The image freezes. Then switches back to the live feed of
dialog: Goodwin.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Let me talk to Rutledge.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: So you've decided to speak.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Rutledge. Get him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: We appreciate your desire for
text: further discussion. Perhaps at a
dialog: later date.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Will you let me out of here?
text: Goodwin ignore the question. Continues making notations.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Frankly, Captain, we're
dialog: disappointed.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Find Rutledge! Now!
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: I have to say that we expected more
dialog: from you.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Stop! Stop reading from your
dialog: goddamn script!
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Perhaps we overestimated your
dialog: abilities.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I swear to fucking Christ!
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Please accept the criticism in the
dialog: spirit it was given. Perhaps a few
dialog: memory exercises would help.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I don't need your criticism and I
dialog: don't need your memory exercises,
dialog: you gutless freak. And by the way,
text: that bomb is detonated by a cell
dialog: phone. When activated, the phone's
text: display screen displays caller ID
dialog: information. Caller ID. I wonder
dialog: if that information would be useful
dialog: to Beleaguered Castle.
text: For a split second, Goodwin looks thrown. But the mask of
text: the cold clinician goes back up.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Very well. We're ready for that
dialog: information.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You'll have to send me back. I
dialog: didn't get a good look at it. But
dialog: I will next time.

speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: What assurance do we have you'll be
text: able to read the screen before the
dialog: device detonates?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Goodwin, there's no time left.
dialog: Send... me... back.
text: Goodwin's pale, inscrutable face fills the monitor. His eyes
text: are unblinking. Unfeeling. Nothing behind them.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - MORNING
text: Colter prowls the aisle feverishly. He scans the overhead
text: luggage rack. Peeks inside a bag. Doesn't see what he
text: wants. He looks all around... up the rows of passengers...
text: intently scanning...
text: There. The Computer Engineer. He's asleep. But clutched in
text: his hand is what Colter wants -- a CELL PHONE.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON - THE COMPUTER ENGINEER - MOMENTS LATER
text: The train jolts slightly, waking him up. Looking down, the
text: Computer Engineer notices that his cell phone has vanished.
text: Across the aisle, a LATINA OFFICE MANAGER taps him on the
text: arm. She gestures down the aisle to
speaker_heading: COLTER
text: Who's walking off with the guy's cell phone. Behind him, the
text: Computer Engineer gets up.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER ENGINEER
dialog: Hey, do you have my phone?
text: People turn to look. Among them is Christina. Colter just
text: starts walking faster.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER ENGINEER
speaker_heading: (UPSET)
dialog: Dude, give me back my phone!
scene_heading: INT. SECOND CAR - MORNING
text: The Computer Engineer hurries in. Colter is nowhere in
text: sight. He RUNS down the aisle and towards the next car.
text: PAN OVER to the DOOR of the CONDUCTOR'S COMPARTMENT as it
text: CLICKS SHUT.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN CONDUCTOR'S COMPARTMENT - MORNING
text: Breathless, Colter has just finished shutting the door and is
text: about to use the cell phone when sees
text: THE CONDUCTOR and a TRAIN OFFICIAL
text: Looking over at him in surprise.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Sorry. Wrong turn.
text: Reversing gears, Colter backs out of the compartment.
scene_heading: INT. SECOND CAR - MORNING
text: Just as the befuddled Computer Engineer disappears into the
text: third car, Colter steps back into the aisle and walks the
dialog: other way.
scene_heading: INT. FIRST CAR - MORNING
text: Sweating a bit now, Colter is keying in a number on the cell
text: phone as he walks.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Operator. City and listing.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Las Vegas, Nevada. Nellis Air
dialog: Force Base.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Connecting you.
text: A tingle up his spine. The call connects.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: POST OPERATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Post Operator.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Is this... Nellis Air Force Base?
speaker_heading: POST OPERATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Yes, sir. How may I direct your
dialog: call?
text: He takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I'm trying to reach... Captain
dialog: Colter Stevens.
text: Calling himself. Strange. No idea where this is going.
speaker_heading: POST OPERATOR (V.O.)
dialog: I have no listing for a Captain
dialog: Colter Stevens.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Then give me the Combined Air and
dialog: Space Ops Center.
speaker_heading: POST OPERATOR (V.O.)
dialog: One moment, sir.
text: The call seems to take forever to connect. Then a terse
text: military VOICE comes on the phone.
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: C Deck.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Who is this?
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: C Deck.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I'm calling for Rutledge. It's
dialog: urgent.
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: You have the wrong number.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: This is Captain Colter Stevens.
text: An eerie pause.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Would you repeat that?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Colter Stevens. Captain Colter
dialog: Stevens.
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Hold the line.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
text: Now approaching Newark Station.
text: Newark Station, next stop.
text: The train slows at it pulls into Newark Station.
text: Another voice comes over the phone.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: Captain? This is Goodwin.
text: Colter's heart sinks.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: Where are you, Captain?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Let me talk to Rutledge.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Where are you? How did you find
dialog: us?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I'm on the train.
text: The train pulls to a stop.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: Newark Station.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: What train?
speaker_heading: COLTER
speaker_heading: (REALIZES)
dialog: You don't know. It hasn't happened
dialog: yet.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: What hasn't happened?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: COLTER
text: The explosion.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: What explosion?
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
text: All aboard. Doors are closing.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Don't you understand? I'm in it,
dialog: Goodwin. I'm calling you from
text: inside the mission. Inside the
dialog: Source Code.
text: A beat of stunned silence. The train begins moving.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: Next stop New York Penn Station.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: This contact is ill-advised. I
dialog: must ask you to hang up.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Goodwin, I'm trapped in this and I
dialog: can't get out.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: You have no authorization to be
dialog: making this call. Goodbye.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: No! Wait! Don't hang up! Forget
dialog: authorization. There's no time.
dialog: Soon you're going to find out what
dialog: happened on this train. And then
dialog: your own day is going to start.
dialog: But not until then. Right now it's
dialog: just you and me talking. And
dialog: you're a different Goodwin than the
dialog: one I'm going to go back to in a
dialog: few minutes. You're separate from
dialog: him. Separate worlds. Do you
dialog: understand?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Good. Now there's a lot of secrecy
dialog: in all of this, and you have your
dialog: reasons for that.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: COLTER (CONT'D)
dialog: But here and now, just this once, I
dialog: need to ask you something. And you
dialog: need to tell me the truth.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: I'd rather you not ask me anything,
dialog: Captain.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I'm going to ask it.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: I should terminate this call.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Jesus, Goodwin, how can I get
dialog: through to you? You're not just a
dialog: soldier. Somewhere inside you're a
text: human being, too. Somewhere inside
dialog: you've got to know that this is
dialog: wrong. Source Code is wrong. And
dialog: if you can't grasp that, if you
dialog: just follow orders, then you're
dialog: just as much a prisoner as I am.
text: The car SHUDDERS as the EXPRESS TRAIN FLASHES BY. Quiet
text: returns as it recedes.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: What's your question?
text: Surprised, Colter raises his head. Draws a breath.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Did I survive that helicopter crash
dialog: in Iraq?
text: Silence. Colter shuts his eyes.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Answer me. Did I survive that
dialog: crash?
text: Another pause. This is crushing Colter.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Goodwin.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: Not physically.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: What?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: You did not physically survive the
dialog: crash.
text: A terrible chill comes over Colter. He swallows. Trying to
dialog: stay brave.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Not physically? Fuck. At least
dialog: give me an answer I can understand.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: We've kept alive certain areas of
dialog: your brain.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: But... the capsule I'm in...
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: A manifestation. Your way of
dialog: making sense of it.
text: This is crushing. Colter fights back terror.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You had no right.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: As a soldier...
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I was a soldier. Then. But now?
speaker_heading: (WHISPERS)
dialog: After death?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: It was the only way. You couldn't
dialog: have a body and be sent back into
dialog: the Source Code.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: What is the status of your mission?
dialog: Is it a success?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You really want to know?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: I suppose not. You're right to
dialog: keep it from me.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: That's what we do. Keep stuff from
dialog: each other. Will this ever end?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: End?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: How can I get out of this?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: You must realizes the army's made
dialog: an investment in you. You'll be
dialog: used again.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: Imagine a turntable. With a record
dialog: spinning on it. All we do is lift
text: up the needle. The music stops.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: And then what?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: Then we wait. Until another
text: mission. And the needle comes down
dialog: again. You won't remember any of
dialog: this. We'll start with the playing
dialog: cards. Electronic tones. Simple
dialog: memory exercises. Bit by bit,
dialog: we'll revive your cerebral
dialog: capacities once more.
dialog: The barbarism of it. Digital slavery.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: How many times have I done this?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: Does it matter?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: No one knows I'm here. No one can
dialog: help me.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: In stimulating your cortex, they're
dialog: prolonging your life. Many
dialog: soldiers would find that preferable
dialog: to death.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You can't do this. I served my
dialog: country. I already gave my life.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: The courts.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: The courts know you're here.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Military court or civilian court?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: Military.
text: Colter finds no comfort in this.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN (V.O.)
dialog: I'm sorry you found out about all
dialog: of this. That wasn't our
dialog: intention.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Does that make it any less wrong?
text: No answer. Colter looks down at his watch. Time is running
dialog: out. And there's absolutely nothing he can do.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
speaker_heading: COLTER'S FACE
text: Ashen. Almost lifeless. Around him is the darkened steel
dialog: cocoon of the
scene_heading: INT. ISOLATION UNIT
text: Its appearance has altered slightly, given Colter's new
text: awareness of what this really is. The capsule is even more
text: claustrophobic. There are fewer controls. Even less light.
text: A shadow world.
text: The monitor is blank. He shouts from the void --
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Goodwin?!
text: Rutledge appears. Drops into the seat and puts on the
text: headset. Fiddles with his pipe as a way to avoid looking at
dialog: the camera.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: How's it going? Any breakthroughs?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I finally get it, Rutledge. You're
dialog: the good guy, Goodwin's the bad
dialog: guy. Working together, you get
dialog: what you want out of me. Why
dialog: didn't I see it before?
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: Believe me, Captain, I'm on your
dialog: side.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Drop it. I know about the
dialog: helicopter crash. I know what
dialog: they've done with me.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
speaker_heading: (STRUGGLING)
dialog: Look, it's been a long day. For
dialog: all of us. But now we've got to
dialog: bring this home and catch a killer.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: What's in it for me?
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: Come on. These guys are serious.
dialog: Help me out. My ass is on the
dialog: line, too, you know.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You can do better than that. They
dialog: sent you here to offer me a deal.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: If you think I'm enjoying this,
dialog: you're wrong.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: What's their offer? What can they
dialog: possibly threaten me with after so
dialog: colossally fucking me? Spit it
dialog: out, you spineless turd.
text: Rutledge's face goes red. Quite possibly no one has ever
text: spoken to him like this before. After a sputtering pause,
text: Rutledge's mouth hardens.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: The government can decide to take
dialog: an interest in people. People like
dialog: your father with his struggling
dialog: farm. It can discover things like
dialog: unpaid property taxes. It can call
dialog: in his equipment loans or tie him
dialog: down for years in environmental
dialog: litigation. On the other hand, it
dialog: can pay him handsomely for mineral
dialog: deposits he never knew were there.
dialog: As distant and problematic as your
dialog: relationship was, surely you'd like
dialog: the chance to do something for him.
text: A beat of silent outrage from Colter.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Those after images I saw. You
dialog: never knew about them. They
dialog: weren't part of Source Code
dialog: architecture, were they?
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
speaker_heading: (HASTILY)
dialog: They're meaningless. Nerves
text: firing. Brain chemistry.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You don't believe that. I've been
dialog: to places you haven't. I've
dialog: crossed and recrossed that line
dialog: between living and dying. And when
dialog: I do, that veil gets lifted for
dialog: just a second. And what's there is
dialog: real. Maybe it's a vision of the
dialog: next world, but I can see it.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: You can see it. But you can never
dialog: get there without our help.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Get there? What do you mean?
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: Our offer. Maybe we can get you
dialog: there. In return for your
text: completing the mission.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: They'll let you die. I'll shut off
dialog: your life support and you'll simply
dialog: slip away.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Just like the good Lord intended
dialog: you to do a few months back.
text: A fearful beat. Negotiating over his own soul.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You'd never do it. You wouldn't
dialog: have to. You could just flip the
dialog: switch and start me back up again
dialog: unaware. For all I know, you've
dialog: made this deal with me before.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: Actually, we haven't. Your
dialog: operational awareness has become
dialog: too great. If you found out the
dialog: truth about yourself once, you
dialog: might do so again. As for Source
dialog: Code, I'm sure we can find other
text: servicemen coming back from
dialog: overseas with wounds just like
dialog: yours.
speaker_heading: (PATRONIZING)
dialog: Do you have the courage to serve
dialog: your country one final time?
text: Colter's eyes bore into Rutledge.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I'm going to find you, Rutledge.
text: Someday. Somewhere.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: (retreating from the
speaker_heading: CONFRONTATION)
text: The display screen on the detonator
dialog: was a useful and exciting insight
dialog: you made. This time, make it pay
dialog: off. Get the information on the
text: screen. But let the bomb explode.
dialog: We need the force of the explosion
dialog: to help integrate you quickly back
dialog: into the present.
text: The Source Code machinery is already beginning to HUM.
text: Rutledge excitedly keying in system commands.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You hear me? Somehow, I'm going to
dialog: find you.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: I doubt that.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 84.
text: There's barely time for Colter to grab onto the harness
text: restraints before the machinery goes into a deafening HOWL.
speaker_heading: THUNK.
text: Colter's body convulses and goes limp. Unconscious, he sags
text: in his seat, held in by the harness. Everything SWITCHES OFF
text: AND GOES DARK.
text: A split second later, the capsule comes back to life again.
text: As if the plug were simply put back in.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: Captain?
text: Colter JOLTS AWAKE. Disoriented. Thrashing to get free.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: It's okay. Calm yourself. You're
dialog: back.
text: Colter exhales. Shuddering. He's just completed another
dialog: Source Code.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: What happened?
text: The tentacles of the nightmare slowly releasing. Replaced by
text: the oppression of being back in the capsule. Back in
dialog: Rutledge's power.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: Was the bomber's identity on the
dialog: cell phone?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I think so. But there wasn't time
text: to read the screen. As soon as it
text: rang the bomb went off.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
speaker_heading: (IMPATIENT)
dialog: What about the phone itself? Make,
dialog: model, product identification
dialog: number.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I was unable examine the phone
dialog: without separating it from the
dialog: detonator -- which I was instructed
dialog: not to do.
text: His delivery is different now. Impersonal. Distant.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: Did you make any other progress?
dialog: What in heck's name did you do for
dialog: those seventeen minutes?
text: Colter does not answer.
text: The machinery again STARTS UP. Colter tenses, bewildered.
text: Eyes dart accusingly to the screen.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Wait. What are you --
speaker_heading: THUNK.
text: Again, he convulses and goes limp.
text: Click. Darkness. Everything POWERS DOWN...
text: ... And BACK UP again -- controls, monitor, machinery.
text: Colter GROANS and opens his eyes. Gripped by another terror.
text: Returning from yet another trip on the train. Another bomb
text: blast. Death and resurrection. Rutledge looks in on him
text: with impatience.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: We can do this all day. Until you
dialog: get it right.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Please... I don't feel good...
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: I don't doubt it. Who's the
dialog: bomber?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I don't know... I honestly... I
dialog: can't keep...
text: The HUMMING again. He's helpless. An insect on a pin.
text: Colter tears at his restraints, ready to bash his brains out
text: against the controls. He SCREAMS...
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - MORNING
text: ... and, in sudden freedom, surges up out of his seat with a
text: cry. Around him startled passengers look over in confusion.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Hey!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 86.
text: Colter, back in his navy jacket, slacks and shirt, has
text: pitched forward into Christina.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: You want to get off me?
text: The Overweight Man, wide eyed in surprise, has his finger
text: poised to open his can of soda.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Go ahead! Open your fucking soda!
text: CHK-THOCK! The Overweight Man complies. Some half-muttered
text: reproaches, then most people go back to what they were doing.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: What's wrong with you, anyway?
text: She glares at him at he stands up. He can't respond.
text: Despair surges through him. He stumbles off down the aisle.
text: But where can he go? There is no freedom. No escape.
text: Imprisoned in both worlds.
text: From her seat, Christina watches him go. Sensing the torment
dialog: in him.
speaker_heading: EXIT AREA
text: Colter is slumped in a corner. Christina appears. Taps him
text: on the shoulder.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: You okay?
text: He eyes her furtively. Like a cave man who's never seen
text: another human being before.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: You're not okay.
text: He's ghastly pale. He's sweating profusely.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Ma'am, please... return to your
dialog: seat.
text: Footsteps. The sound of jangling KEYS.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: Ticket.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 87.
text: The conductor takes up position in front of him. As
text: implacable as Rutledge, in his way.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: Ticket, please.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
text: He's not feeling well.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: He still needs a ticket.
text: Colter makes no move to respond. No more concern for
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: Have it your way, pal.
text: He takes out his book to write Colter up.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Wait. I'll pay it.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: I have no idea where he got on.
dialog: Full fare's $22.50.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: All right, all right.
text: Getting out her wallet, she pays the conductor. He eyes her
text: with disapproval, then shambles off.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: I see customer service is alive and
text: well on New Jersey Transit.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Why did you just do that?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: The ticket? I don't know. You
dialog: looked a little lost.
text: The gratitude in his look makes her self conscious. She
text: turns to go.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Will you do me a favor?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: What's that?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Get off the train.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
text: Now approaching Newark Station.
text: Newark Station, next stop.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Please. Just get off the train.
text: Her puzzled look. The train begins to SLOW DOWN.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: This isn't my stop.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You shouldn't have been on this
dialog: train, Christina. You should be
dialog: living another life. Not spending
text: it answering phones for lawyers.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: How do you...?
text: A group of passengers approaches the exit area. We've seen
dialog: them all before: Derek, the Old Man, the College Kid. And
text: the small encounters: shuffling around, positioning at the
text: doors, and the College Kid tapping Derek on the arm, holding
text: out Derek's wallet.
speaker_heading: COLLEGE STUDENT
dialog: Hey, you dropped this.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: (relieved, takes it back)
dialog: Wow. Thanks.
text: The train stops. The doors OPEN.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: Newark Station.
text: Derek, the Old Man and the College Kid get off. A second
text: later, Guzman bursts past them, making his nauseated run for
dialog: the station.
text: Leaving just Colter and Christina there. The doors stand
text: open, invitingly.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Everyone has a destiny. And this
dialog: isn't yours.
text: He steps out onto the platform. Holds out his hand for her
text: to join him. A coaxing look.
text: She's incredulous. This guy. His words. This whole moment.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Who in the world are you?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Just do it. Stop being afraid.
dialog: Believe in yourself.
text: He waits for her. Only two steps away.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
text: All aboard. Doors are closing.
text: She blinks. The spell breaks. Those two steps prove to be
dialog: two much.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Leave me alone.
text: She retreats back into the car. Colter is heartbroken.
text: About to pursue her, he happens to look over and see
speaker_heading: DEREK
text: Instead of going directly to the station house, Derek
text: continues walking down the platform alongside the train, as
dialog: if intending to reboard further down.
dialog: And then it happens.
text: With a quick motion Derek TOSSES SOMETHING through an open
text: door of another car, then heads quickly away towards the
dialog: station house.
text: With no time to think, Colter slips back on board just as the
text: doors slide shut.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - MORNING
text: The train begins moving. Christina is nowhere in sight.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
text: This is a New York bound train.
dialog: Next stop New York - Penn Station.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 90.
text: Intrigued, Colter leaves the exit door area...
scene_heading: INT. SECOND CAR - MORNING
text: ... Strides down the aisle of the second car... and reaches
dialog: the next set of
speaker_heading: EXIT DOORS
text: There's nothing there. Whatever Derek tossed inside is gone.
text: Did someone pick it up? Colter looks up the aisle and then
text: the other way into the next car. No one there.
text: Once more he examines the exit area. Gets down on his knees.
text: Then he spots it -- an OPENING between the floor and one of
text: the wall panels, only a few inches high.
text: And there something lies. Colter slides it out.
text: Derek's WALLET. Intentionally left here. The same wallet
text: the College Kid gave back to Derek earlier.
text: Opening it, Colter pulls out Derek's DRIVER'S LICENSE.

text: The Source Code has finished. The monitor shows just the
text: empty chair. Finally Rutledge returns to his seat.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: They've searched the wreckage and
text: found the wallet. It was under the
dialog: wall panel. Just as you said.
text: An awkward dynamic between them. They despise each other but
dialog: have to work together.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Believe me, he's our guy. He
text: tossed his own wallet back on the
dialog: train. Only reason he'd do that...
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: (finishing his thought)
dialog: ...is if he wanted us to think he
dialog: died in the explosion. I know.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
text: We looked into his profile.
speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Derek Frost is a commodities
dialog: trader, with a wife, two children
dialog: and a promotion one month old.
dialog: He's an emergency preparedness
text: volunteer on his office floor, for
dialog: God's sake.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You saw that terrorist video --
dialog: they said it was one of us. One of
dialog: our own.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: If he's really the one, you can
text: find out the rest of his plan.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: By any means necessary. There is
dialog: no Geneva Convention in the Source
dialog: Code.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Torture him, you mean.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
speaker_heading: (SHRUGS)
dialog: Find out the plan, before it
dialog: happens here. And then I'll let
dialog: you die.
text: Their grisly bargain.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
text: In the conductor's compartment
text: there's a fully loaded 9 millimeter
text: handgun locked in a safe. Think
dialog: you can remember the combination?
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - MORNING
text: Christina is absorbed in her sketch book. Across from her,
text: Colter watches. A stranger to her again. It hurts too much.
text: She feels his eyes on her. When she looks up, he's gone.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - MORNING
text: As Guzman exits the bathroom, he almost crashes into Colter,
text: who's waiting right there.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: GUZMAN
dialog: Excuse me.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Assalam'alaikoom.
text: Squeezing past, Guzman does a double take to hear the
dialog: standard Arabic reply.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING
text: Reaching into the overhead crawl space, Colter once again
text: unhooks the cell phone detonator from the bomb.
text: Sitting down on the toilet seat, he dials 4-1-1 on the cell
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (V.O.)
dialog: What listing?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: The New York Times.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - MORNING
text: Christina's CELL PHONE RINGS. She gets it out.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE (V.O.)
dialog: Christina? It's Stephanie. Where
dialog: are you right now?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Going to work. Why?
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE (V.O.)
dialog: The strangest thing. The phone
dialog: rang at my desk and some guy I
dialog: don't know said the train you're on
dialog: isn't safe and that you should get
text: off at the next stop. Then he hung
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: What?
text: The train begins to SLOW DOWN.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
text: Now approaching Newark Station.
text: Newark Station, next stop.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: I don't understand.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE (V.O.)
dialog: Maybe you should get off. Are you
dialog: okay?
text: The station platform slides into view.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: I'm fine. Everything's normal. Is
dialog: there something on the news? Some
dialog: kind of alert?
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE (V.O.)
dialog: Nothing that I've heard.
scene_heading: EXT. NEWARK PLATFORM - MORNING
text: The train pulls to a stop. Passengers begin to get off.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: Newark Station.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - MORNING
text: Christina is out of her seat, debating.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE (V.O.)
dialog: I think you should get off.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: I'll be late for work.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE (V.O.)
dialog: The hell with work, Christina! You
dialog: hate that job anyway.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: It's probably a joke. A weirdo guy
dialog: from somewhere.
text: She sees Colter down in the exit area. They lock eyes.
text: And somehow she knows. He made the call. Colter quickly
text: disappears into the other car.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 94.
scene_heading: INT. SECOND CAR - MORNING
text: The doors stand open to the platform. Just then Derek's
text: WALLET goes skidding back on board, disappearing under the
text: wall panel. A second later, Colter reaches the exit area.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
text: All aboard. Doors are closing.
scene_heading: EXT. NEWARK PLATFORM - MORNING
text: The train doors shut. Colter is now out on the platform.
text: Christina is not there. Concerned, walking quickly forward,
text: Colter looks through the windows...
text: And finds her staring back at him. Still on the train. A
text: strange moment between the two of them.
text: Once again he's failed to save her.
text: They watch each other for as long as possible, until the
text: train pulls away.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - MORNING
text: As the train SPEEDS UP, Christina sits down again, lowering
dialog: her phone.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE (V.O.)
dialog: Did you get off...?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: No. I'll call you back.
text: She hangs up. Disturbed. As if she's failed some test.
dialog: But what test? Why this weird feeling?
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
text: This is a New York bound train.
dialog: Next stop New York - Penn Station.
text: The train SPEEDS UP. Anxiety creeps into her face. Looking
text: around, the tranquility of the passengers begins to seem
text: ominous, hinting that she's made the wrong choice.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 95.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN CONDUCTOR'S COMPARTMENT - MORNING
text: The conductor enters. About to pour himself a cup of coffee
speaker_heading: WHEN --
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: Huh?
text: The metal door to THE SAFE has been OPENED.
scene_heading: INT. NEWARK STATION - MORNING
text: Inside the quiet lobby, Derek is heading for the outer doors
dialog: to the parking lot, when:
speaker_heading: COLTER (O.S.)
dialog: Derek Frost.
text: Colter is walking towards him, holding up Derek's WALLET.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You forget something?
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Gosh. Is that my wallet?
text: As he goes to take it, Colter GRABS HIM.
scene_heading: INT. NEWARK STATION - MEN'S ROOM - MORNING
text: Behind the closed door at the end stall comes the sound of
scene_heading: GUZMAN VOMITING.
text: BANG - The men's room DOOR flies open -- Colter DRAGS Derek
dialog: inside.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: What the hell, man? What the
dialog: hell???
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You see this?
text: Colter pulls out the DETONATOR CELL PHONE -- the one he took
text: off the bomb. Holds it inches from Derek's face.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Now you can't blow it up.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: What is this? Get away from me!
text: The BARREL of a 9 MM PISTOL. Aimed right at him.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Believe me, I'm very accurate with
dialog: one of these things.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Jesus.
text: Derek raises his hands. Sweating. All fright. Like a
text: decent man, terrorized.
text: It gives Colter pause. Does he have the right guy?
text: A toilet FLUSHES. The last stall door opens and Guzman
text: emerges. Stops cold as Colter swings the pistol at him.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Stay there, my man.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Don't hurt me.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Stop acting, for Chrissakes.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Keep my wallet. Take my watch.
dialog: Take anything you want.
text: Unprompted, Guzman takes out his own wallet and sets it on
text: the counter. Calmer than Derek. Accustomed to trouble.
speaker_heading: GUZMAN
dialog: There. Now you have two wallets.
dialog: Take them and go.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Shut up!
dialog: Tensing. This isn't supposed to happen like this.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Please. I have a family.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: What about those other passengers?
dialog: Don't you think they had families?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: GUZMAN
dialog: Just what is this about?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: This man's a terrorist. He planted
text: a bomb on the train.
speaker_heading: DEREK
speaker_heading: (HALF LAUGHS)
dialog: What?
text: Click. Colter pulls back the hammer and savagely JAMS the
text: barrel of the pistol into Derek's cheek.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: What's the next attack? Who else
dialog: are you going to kill today, huh?
speaker_heading: DEREK
speaker_heading: (IN TEARS)
dialog: Oh God... Oh God...
text: Guzman takes a step towards Colter.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: One more step, asshole.
speaker_heading: GUZMAN
dialog: Don't treat him like this. He's
dialog: not an animal. Neither are you.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Listen to him. For God's sake I'm
dialog: not a terrorist...!
text: A URINE STAIN spreads on Derek's pants. He looks down,
text: ashamed. Colter keeps the gun on him.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Piss all you want. You took eighty
dialog: million dollars to kill hundreds of
dialog: people today.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Eighty million dollars? I swear to
dialog: you...
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Then what about the wallet, huh?
dialog: Why the fuck did you twice try to
dialog: leave your wallet on board?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: I... I...
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Time's up! What is it?! What is
dialog: the next attack! So help me, I'll
dialog: put this bullet through your brain.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: I don't know what you're talking
dialog: about!
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I'm going to do it.
text: Tightening his finger around the trigger. Tears are
text: streaming down Derek's face. But he's not going to talk.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: I would never hurt anyone. I have
dialog: a family. I guess you'll have to
dialog: kill me.
text: But Colter can't. He can't shoot him. He lowers the gun.
text: Disgusted with himself. Why can't he do it?
speaker_heading: GUZMAN
dialog: You see? You are a human being.
text: Speaking gently. Trying to calm him. Even as Colter feels
dialog: like he's failed.
speaker_heading: GUZMAN
dialog: This can be worked out. We can
dialog: listen to each other.
text: The temperature cooling. Derek's nodding with him.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Anything you want... Please...
text: The detonator CELL PHONE RINGS, startling all of them.
text: Confused, he answers the phone.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA (V.O.)
dialog: Who is this?
speaker_heading: COLTER
speaker_heading: (STUNNED)
dialog: Christina?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA (V.O.)
dialog: Are you the guy who was sitting
dialog: across me on the train?
text: Colter looks at his watch. The countdown passes THREE
scene_heading: MINUTES. 2:59... 2:58...
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: How can you be calling this number?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA (V.O.)
dialog: My friend had it. From when you
dialog: called her -- to try and get me off
dialog: the train. Who are you? What do
dialog: you want?
text: Derek and Guzman cautiously lower their hands. Watching in
dialog: confusion.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I was trying to warn you.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA (V.O.)
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I'm not sure that it matters now.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA (V.O.)
dialog: Talk to me. I feel that something
dialog: terrible's going to happen. Do I
dialog: need to get off the train? Am I
dialog: going to die?
text: He can hear the b.g. noise of the train on the other end.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I'm right here, okay? Don't be
dialog: afraid.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
speaker_heading: (ANGUISH)
dialog: Why didn't I get off the train?
speaker_heading: (SIGHS)
dialog: I knew I should have driven in
dialog: today. But then there's the
dialog: bridges, right? You never know
dialog: when they'll be jammed.
text: That stirs something in the back of Colter's mind.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: What did you say?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: The bridges. You just never know
dialog: when they'll be jammed.
text: His heart starts racing.
speaker_heading: FLASHBACK
text: On the train. Earlier. Derek in his seat, on his cell
text: phone. Colter nearby, overhearing him:
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Trust me, by one o'clock, the
dialog: bridge is going to be jammed...
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Colter looks to Derek. His stomach sinks.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: "By one o'clock, the bridge is
dialog: going to be jammed." That's what
dialog: you said. You knew. You knew
dialog: there was going to be an
dialog: evacuation. You knew before it
dialog: happened. All those people walking
dialog: across the...
text: The realization hits.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: They're going to bomb the bridges.
dialog: While they're full of people.
speaker_heading: ON DEREK
text: A slight flicker travels across Derek's face. Like a
text: disturbance on a surface of deep water.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA (V.O.)
dialog: What are you talking about. Who's
dialog: going to --
text: Over the phone comes the HORN from the passing FREIGHT TRAIN.
text: Colter presses the phone to his ear, trying to hear her.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Christina? Just hang in there.
dialog: You'll be okay.
text: A HAND closes over his gun. Before Colter can react, Derek
text: TURNS THE GUN BACK INTO HIM --
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: BLAM! BLAM!
text: DEREK SHOOTS COLTER TWICE IN THE CHEST.
text: Colter staggers back -- slumps to his knees. Guzman cries
text: out -- makes a run at Derek -- who spins and --
speaker_heading: BLAM!
scene_heading: SHOOTS GUZMAN DEAD.
text: Spent shell casings roll to a stop on the tile floor. A
text: terrible silence.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA (V.O.)
dialog: What's happening? Are you okay?
dialog: Are you there?
text: Derek picks up the phone and terminates the call. He coldly
text: evaluates the two men dying in pools of blood. Then calmly
text: walks out.
text: As the life slips from Colter's eyes, he manages to focus on
text: his beeping WATCH --
dialog: Where the seventeen minutes have RUN OUT. And the world
text: BLEACHES WHITE...
text: In the haze comes the mystical vision again -- but deeper in:
text: THE STONE WALL now curves over our heads, becoming a TUNNEL.
text: CHRISTINA walks away from us -- down into the tunnel. The
text: far end is ablaze in WHITE LIGHT.
text: We try calling to her. But our voice is weak and faint. She
text: continues towards the light... and we do not follow.
scene_heading: INT. ISOLATION UNIT
text: The monitor is dark. Everything is still. Colter in his
text: seat. For long seconds we watch his face.
scene_heading: INT. ENGINEERING LAB - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY
text: A jarring transition. We are now away from Colter's P.O.V.
dialog: and in the real, physical environment of the Source Code
text: operations center. Military and civilian personnel work amid
text: mysterious scientific equipment.
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Yes... We appreciate that... I just
dialog: hope the information has come in
dialog: time to clear the bridges... Thank
dialog: you, sir.
text: When he hangs up, he turns to Goodwin and a few other
text: TECHNICIANS. Naked ambition courses through him.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: Whether or not they can stop the
dialog: bridge attack, we came up with the
dialog: intelligence. And that virtually
dialog: assures all of our futures. This
dialog: is just the beginning, guys.
speaker_heading: (TO GOODWIN)
dialog: You did a great job, Goodwin. You
dialog: operated our captain with skill and
dialog: professionalism. What's that you
dialog: have?
text: Goodwin opens an envelope and slides out a CITATION.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: The Army investigated Colter's
dialog: helicopter crash in Iraq.
dialog: Apparently he stayed behind to fly
dialog: protective cover for a disabled
text: convoy until he ran out of fuel.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: What's this, then? Some kind of
dialog: posthumous reprimand for reckless
dialog: flying?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: No. It's the Silver Star.
text: Something in Goodwin's voice momentarily checks Rutledge's
text: breezy good humor.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: Send it on to his father. It'll
text: ease the pain of his son's death.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: I thought I might inform the
dialog: captain of the citation.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: Better not. We can't risk
dialog: acquainting him with the citation
dialog: in case the memory wipe isn't
dialog: entirely clean.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: The memory wipe?
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: I thought we were going to let him
dialog: die.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: I know, I know. But now the
dialog: Director of National Intelligence
dialog: is sure to want a closer look at
dialog: our program, and until we train up
dialog: another candidate, we'll need to
dialog: keep Colter around to demonstrate
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: This thing is much bigger than any
dialog: one of us. Goodwin, please clear
text: Colter's memories and re-initialize
dialog: Source Code.
text: Rutledge walks away. The technician gives Goodwin a look of
text: disgust. Goodwin carefully replaces the citation into the
dialog: envelope.
scene_heading: INT. CONTROL CONSOLE - DAY
text: Mission Control. Panels, consoles and screens. Goodwin
text: takes a seat at his workstation. He swings a microphone up
text: and goes to flip a switch.
text: Then stops. Unsure how to proceed. Looks down at the
text: envelope with the citation in it.
scene_heading: INT. ISOLATION UNIT
text: Inside the capsule, the silence continues. Colter thinks to
text: himself. The MONITOR then comes on.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Captain, this is Beleaguered
text: Castle. Acknowledge transmission.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY
text: Rutledge walks by himself. Reflecting. Pleased with
text: himself. Under his breath, he acknowledges the praises he's
text: imagining in his head:
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: Thank you, sir... I appreciate your
dialog: faith in me... It's a great day for
dialog: our country.
scene_heading: INT. ISOLATION UNIT
text: Colter looks out at Goodwin. A beat of difficult silence.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: How are you feeling? Are you
dialog: comfortable?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Just do it.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Come again?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Just do it. I knew they wouldn't
dialog: let me die. At least you can make
dialog: me forget all of this. I hope.
text: Goodwin stares at his hands. Unmoving.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: What are you waiting for? You're
dialog: just doing your job. I'd do the
dialog: same thing if I was you. At least
dialog: you've got a shot at saving those
text: people on the bridges.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: I doubt it.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You don't think they'll save them?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: No. I meant, I doubt you'd be
dialog: doing this, if you were me.
text: An unusually personal statement, coming from Goodwin.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Look, someone had to be where
dialog: you're sitting, and someone had to
dialog: be in here. Turned out it was you
dialog: and me.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: Just do it. I'm tired.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Would you like to see Christina
dialog: again? One last time?
text: Colter's not sure he heard him right.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: I don't understand.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Seventeen minutes. That's all I
dialog: could give you. No mission to
dialog: fulfill. Just... the two of you.
speaker_heading: COLTER
speaker_heading: (STUNNED)
dialog: Why would you do that?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: As a favor. One prisoner to
dialog: another.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Prisoner?
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: You were right. About me. And
dialog: about Source Code. We've kept too
text: much from each other.
text: An odd sensation comes over Colter.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: I usually report in at 0600. Today
dialog: I was there early. I was there
dialog: when the call came in. Your call.
text: His call? They share a long look.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: No... There's no way... There's no
dialog: way you could have...
text: Goodwin just smiles.
speaker_heading: COLTER
speaker_heading: (PROTESTING)
dialog: How? The Source Code was a
dialog: parallel world! You told me so!
text: It's hermetically sealed. Nothing
dialog: I did on that train would have any
dialog: effect on this reality!
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: You were on the train. I was not.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: But...
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: We didn't know if any bleed-
dialog: throughs could occur. The
dialog: implications would be staggering.
dialog: That's why you were told to avoid
text: unduly influencing events.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You're saying I could have saved
dialog: those people?!
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: No. Not in our world. The time
dialog: currents are too strong. But minor
dialog: alterations, here and there, a
dialog: phone call, say, those might slip
dialog: through. We didn't know for sure.
dialog: But you proved it.
text: Colter is thunderstruck. Unable to grasp it.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: I've been thinking about the things
dialog: you said on that call. As the day
dialog: passed, the more I understood them.
dialog: And now, I guess we've caught up to
dialog: each other.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Man. Just when I think I
dialog: understand this...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
speaker_heading: (NERVOUS)
dialog: There's not much time. They think
dialog: I'm re-initializing the system.
dialog: One last look at her. That's all I
dialog: can give you. If that.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: They'll nail your ass for this.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: If I had any feelings, I'd worry
dialog: about that. But, as you've
dialog: maintained, I do not.
text: The strange path of their relationship. Ending at last at
text: simple, grudging respect.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Roger that.
text: MACHINERY BEGINS TO HUM.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: This is Beleaguered Castle signing
dialog: off. Acknowledge final

speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Final transmission acknowledged.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Thank you, Goodwin.

dialog: What is this? Who authorized this?
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: We don't know, sir. But Source

speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: Where's Goodwin?
text: The chair at the console is EMPTY.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: No idea, sir.
text: A DIGITAL CLOCK ticks down from 17 minutes: 15:28... 15:27...

scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - MORNING
text: Colter drinks in the sight of Christina. Finally he gets up
text: and walks off down the aisle.
text: As soon as he's gone, Christina looks up. She's observed his
text: interest in her. Doesn't quite know what to make of it.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - MORNING
text: Colter is by himself in the exit door area. From his jacket
text: he takes out a CELL PHONE.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON -- THE CELL PHONE SCREEN
text: As he dials 9-1-1. The call connecting...
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (V.O.)
dialog: 9-1-1. What is the nature of your
dialog: emergency?
scene_heading: INT. CONTROL CONSOLE - DAY
text: Rutledge watches the computers churn.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: Shut it down.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: Shut down the Source Code. Right
dialog: now.
text: The technician hesitates.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Fine. I'll do it myself.
text: Rutledge sits down at the controls.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: I wouldn't do that.
text: Rutledge gives a dismissive snort. And yet he pauses.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: And why not?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: We've never interrupted Source Code
dialog: in mid run. We'd have to literally
dialog: pull the plug. It could damage the
dialog: processors.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: Let it finish, then. No harm in
dialog: that, I guess.
speaker_heading: (OMINOUS)
dialog: All of you are in deep shit, I
dialog: promise you. As for Goodwin, he'll
dialog: never make it off this base.
text: Rutledge picks up a phone.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: I don't think that's where he's
dialog: headed.
text: Rutledge considers. And then catches on.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: He wouldn't.
text: Looks up at the technician. Grows more and more uneasy.
text: Snapping his attention back to
scene_heading: THE COUNTDOWN CLOCK
text: Which reads: 12:42. Before it hits 12:41, Rutledge is
text: already out of his chair and RUNNING for the door.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: Seal the ICU. I want a detachment
dialog: of MPs meeting me on the way there.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - MORNING
text: Colter walks down the aisle. Looks at HIS WATCH -- 12
text: minutes, 40 seconds. The train begins to SLOW DOWN.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
text: Now approaching Newark Station.
text: Newark Station, next stop.
text: The Computer Engineer begins to wake up. As he does, Colter
text: passes by, deftly slipping the borrowed cell phone back into
text: the engineer's hand without being noticed.
text: Derek packs up his things. We see him hide his wallet into a
text: gap in the seat cushions and get up.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 111.
text: The College Kid, also getting up, notices Derek's wallet,
text: picks it up and hurries after him.
speaker_heading: COLLEGE STUDENT
dialog: Hey, you dropped this.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Wow. Thanks.
text: Keeping his composure, Derek accepts the wallet.
text: Colter steps aside, allowing them to pass. Allowing it all
dialog: to happen.
text: The station slides into view. No one on the platform.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY
text: Rutledge furiously descends, shoving people out of his way.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY
text: Rutledge runs up to a locked door and swipes his access card
text: through the scanner. It comes up RED.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: What?!
text: He tries again. Red. The door stays LOCKED.
scene_heading: EXT. NEWARK PLATFORM - MORNING
text: The train comes to a halt. Unlike before, the doors stay
text: shut for SEVERAL SECONDS LONGER than usual. Derek waits
text: quietly at the doors.
text: Finally they open. Derek steps out onto the platform,
text: together with the Old Man, the College Kid and Guzman.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: Newark Station.
text: Colter remains on board, standing in the exit area, watching.
text: As usual, Derek quickly flips his wallet onto the next car
text: and starts toward the station house. Guzman is ahead of him,
text: already pushing open the doors to the station.
text: All is quiet. Perhaps too quiet. Derek approaches the
dialog: station and sees
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 112.
text: THROUGH THE OPEN DOORS
text: In station lobby are POLICE OFFICERS.
text: Derek's jaw tightens. He changes course, heading instead for
text: an outdoor stairwell.
text: Coming UP the stairs, however, are more POLICE OFFICERS.
text: Wheeling around, Derek heads the other way. Walking faster,
text: but keeping his head. Not running, not panicking.
text: The train, oddly, is still sitting there.
text: As he nears the other end of the platform, MORE OFFICERS
text: appear from behind columns, cutting off his escape. The
text: police are coming from all sides, converging on the platform.
text: Yet no one panics. No one runs. Finally --
speaker_heading: POLICE COMMANDER
speaker_heading: (CALLING OUT)
dialog: Derek Frost.
text: Derek goes to get back on the train. The doors, however,
text: SLIDE SHUT in his face. Through the closed doors, Derek
text: looks in at Colter, still on the train. They stare at one
text: another through the window.
speaker_heading: POLICE COMMANDER
dialog: Mr. Frost. Please turn to face us.
text: An entire PHALANX OF POLICE OFFICERS is on the platform.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Of course. What's this about?
text: Unseen by the officers, Derek has taken out his CELL PHONE
text: and is DIALING IT as he turns around.
text: The police approach, cautiously.
speaker_heading: POLICE COMMANDER
dialog: Place your hands in the air.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: My pleasure.
text: Raising his hands, he pushes SEND on his phone.
text: On board the train there's a RINGING.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 113.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - MORNING
text: The DETONATOR PHONE has been removed from the bomb and now
text: rings harmlessly in the hand of the train's SECURITY OFFICER.
text: The restroom door is open and swarming with conductors
text: examining the bomb.
text: On the platform, the officers tackle Derek, subduing him.
text: Passengers watch at the windows, mesmerized.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: Once again, please return to your
dialog: seats, ladies and gentlemen.
text: No way. No one's moving from the windows.
text: Except for Colter, who stands off by himself. The first look
dialog: of satisfaction we've ever seen on his face.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY
text: An ALARM is going off. At a locked door, an Air Force
text: LOCKSMITH is in the process of disabling the key pad.
text: Rutledge paces, livid.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: I want to know who reprogrammed
dialog: this lock. And if you don't get
dialog: this open in ten seconds I'll see
dialog: that you're busted back down to
dialog: private.
speaker_heading: LOCKSMITH
dialog: I'm already a private, sir.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: Just open it! A man's life is at
dialog: stake.
text: The key pad goes GREEN and the pressure lock releases.
text: Rutledge tears open the door.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY

scene_heading: INT. BUNKER MEDICAL FACILITY - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY
text: Goodwin enters. He locks another door behind him. He is
text: shaken but nevertheless going forward. In the chamber, three
text: MEDICS monitor gauges and screens. One of them stands up to
text: block his way.
speaker_heading: MEDIC #1
dialog: Sorry, I can't let you pass.
text: Goodwin removes the patch on his uniform to reveal the
text: insignia of a major.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Step aside. That's an order.
speaker_heading: MEDIC #1
dialog: We all know your rank, Goodwin, but
dialog: I have explicit orders from

text: BAM! Goodwin drops the Medic with a splintering HEADBUTT.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: I'm glad you know my rank. Were
dialog: you also aware I'm in the Special

scene_heading: EXT. NEWARK PLATFORM - MORNING
text: The train has been evacuated as police investigators search

speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, rail service
dialog: has been cancelled. Please clear

scene_heading: EXT. NEWARK STATION - PARKING LOT - MORNING
text: Police cars parked everywhere. Two DETECTIVES are

speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: So you have no idea how your cell
dialog: phone was used to call in the tip?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: COMPUTER ENGINEER
dialog: No!
text: People mill about waiting for the buses, groaning and
text: complaining. Christina accosts a passing transit employee.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: What now? How do we get to work?
dialog: You guys have some busses or
dialog: something?
text: The transit employee ignores her and walks away.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Hey! I'm talking to you!
text: She stands there in exasperation. This whole thing has been
text: designed to thwart her. Nearby, Colter sits on a bench.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Ain't life grand?
text: Looking over, she notices him.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Yeah. Now I'm going get fired for
dialog: being late.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Maybe that's a good thing.
text: She gives him a sharp look.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY
text: Rutledge runs, now leading the detachment of MPs.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: Shoot him if you have to, you hear
dialog: me?
text: The MPs exchange a look of annoyance at being ordered around
dialog: by this guy.
scene_heading: INT. BUNKER MEDICAL FACILITY - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY
text: A heavy INNER DOOR has been opened.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 116.
scene_heading: INT. BUNKER ICU - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY
text: The BEEPING of life support systems. The compressions of a
text: ventilator. Goodwin approaches a GURNEY. A jungle of tubes
text: and lines lead from the gurney into advanced machinery. A
text: somber look on his face.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Hello, Captain.
text: As Goodwin edges forward, we reveal the bare foot of someone
text: lying there.
text: A DIGITAL TIMER reads 1 MINUTE.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY
text: At the facility's outer door, the locksmith goes to work on
text: another panel as Rutledge and the MPs stand by.
speaker_heading: LOCKSMITH
dialog: Give me twenty seconds.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: Make it ten.
text: Rutledge looks at HIS WATCH. It reads 52 SECONDS.
scene_heading: EXT. NEWARK STATION - PARKING LOT - MORNING
scene_heading: CLOSE ON - COLTER'S WATCH
text: It also reads 52 seconds.
text: His work is done. He's saved her. Saved them all. At least
dialog: this one time.
text: Only she doesn't know that. Christina stands there, arms
text: crossed, scowling at the parking lot.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Could this day get any worse?
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: That train was taking you to a
dialog: place you didn't want to be. But
dialog: then you got off. And maybe that's
text: a sign.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 117.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Yeah. If only.
text: She takes out her cell phone. The stress of her day.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: I'm calling a cab. Maybe I'll only
dialog: be somewhat late for work.
text: Colter watches her, a quiet ache inside. Maybe some people
dialog: don't want to be saved.
scene_heading: INT. BUNKER ICU - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY
text: The noise from the outer door grows louder. The MPs are only
text: seconds from getting inside. Goodman moves towards the life
text: support equipment.
text: As he does, we glimpse a horrifying sight: the upper half of
text: Colter's body -- his real body -- inside a sterile tent of
text: transparent plastic. His skull has been removed. A massive
text: apparatus has been infused directly onto his brain.
text: Goodwin takes a long, last look.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Thank you for your service. Time
dialog: to go home.
text: Goodwin's hand goes to the switch to shut off life support.
text: His eyes on the clock. It reads 30 SECONDS.
scene_heading: EXT. NEWARK STATION - PARKING LOT - DAY
text: Christina on the phone, waiting as it dials.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Hey.
text: She turns. Colter gets up.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You can do anything you want with
dialog: your life. Starting right now.
text: She's taken aback. He starts walking off.
speaker_heading: CAB DISPATCH (V.O.)
dialog: Metro Cab Dispatch.
text: A long beat as she watches him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 118.
speaker_heading: CAB DISPATCH (V.O.)
dialog: Hello...?
text: Click. She shuts her phone.
text: Beat. Is she crazy? She's baffled by her own action. And
dialog: by this unusual guy here.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Wait.
text: Colter turns. She crosses her arms archly.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: You can't just expect someone to
dialog: change her life just like that. At
dialog: the very least... you'd have to buy
dialog: that person coffee and explain your
dialog: reasons.
text: She waits for his response. Uneasy at putting herself out
dialog: there.
text: Colter's watch ticks down to the final seconds. His last
text: moments in this world. He has only time enough for a final
text: look of reassurance.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: Maybe some other time.
text: Disappointment flickers on her face. She turns to go.
text: Behind her is a STONE WALL. A BICYCLE is parked against it.
text: Colter's breath catches in his throat. This is it! This is
dialog: the mysterious scene he's been seeing!
text: HIS WATCH - Hits ZERO.
scene_heading: INT. BUNKER ICU - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY
text: THE DIGITAL TIMER - Also hits ZERO.
text: The outer door OPENS. Rutledge RUSHES in, accompanied by
dialog: MPs.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: Arrest him!
text: Goodwin backs away from the gurney, hands in the air.
text: The BEEPING has given way to a MONOTONE. All of Colter's
text: vital signs have FLATLINED.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 119.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: He's dying...!
text: Rutledge frantically goes to reconnect the machines -- but
text: Goodwin has turned off too many of them.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: Get a medical team in here! Move!
text: But the MPs just stare at the appalling sight of Colter's
text: exposed brain.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
speaker_heading: (SHRIEKING)
dialog: What are you standing there for?!
dialog: Do it! We can save him!!!
text: No one moves. Rutledge rashly grabs for one of the MP's
dialog: rifles.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: I guess force is the only thing you
dialog: people understa --
speaker_heading: MP
dialog: Back away, sir, now!
text: The MP has leveled his rifle at Rutledge. Who steps back,
text: aghast. His authority has vanished with Colter's life.
text: Goodwin shuts off the monitors. Silence fills the room.
text: Colter is dead.
text: Rutledge stares sorrowfully at Colter's body. Then at
text: Goodwin with burning hatred.
speaker_heading: RUTLEDGE
dialog: You're a murderer.
text: Goodwin offers his hands to the MP.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: Go ahead and arrest me.
text: But the MP does nothing.
speaker_heading: GOODWIN
dialog: I'll be around. Whenever you want
dialog: me.
text: They part as he walks out of the room. A look of grim
text: satisfaction on his face.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 120.
scene_heading: EXT. NEWARK STATION - PARKING LOT - MORNING
text: Christina walks past the bicycle parked against the stone
text: wall. She's about to enter a TUNNEL that goes under the
text: tracks. The same tunnel from Colter's vision.
text: She stops. Something tells her to turn around.
text: The bench where Colter sat is empty.
text: But three feet away... Colter is standing there. Still here.
text: Dumbfounded, he looks at his watch -- it remains at ZERO.
text: He looks all around. Trees stirring in the breeze. A bird
text: flies overhead. The crowd of passengers outside the station.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: You okay?
text: Colter turns to her. How can this be? He's afraid to even
text: speak. As if that alone could break the enchantment.
text: But the world is here. It goes on. That's all he knows.
text: Finally he swallows. Finding his voice.
speaker_heading: COLTER
dialog: You're right. The least I can do
dialog: is buy you coffee.
text: This pleases Christina, although she tries not to show it.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Okay, well, come on then.
text: Walking forward, he joins her. The two of them disappear
text: down the tunnel.
text: A beautiful morning.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
