text: hair out of place.
text: She walks into the bedroom, where TED, a gorgeous man

text: positioning herself and moving the sheets to show her
dialog: good parts.
text: She coughs and nudges Ted to wake him up then pretend
dialog: sleeps.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Good morning.
text: Annie pretends to wake up.
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ANNIE
speaker_heading: (ACTING EMBARRASSED)

dialog: morning. I look terrible. I just woke up.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Last night was fun.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah, I had the best time. I have't had
dialog: that much fun on a first date in years,
dialog: ever...
text: She brushes the hair off his forehead as if he were her
dialog: long time lover.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: So listen Annie, I like you. So, I want
dialog: to be up front with you. I'm not really

text: Annie's eyes grow large. She uncomfortably smiles at him,
text: nodding.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oooooo. Oops. I mean, yeah. What?
speaker_heading: TED

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: And honestly, (sits up) I don't even know
dialog: how I feel about the whole monogamy
dialog: thing, is one person really enough for
dialog: anyone? I mean, I like to be with a lot
dialog: of different people.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: It is sooo refreshing to hear you say
dialog: that, because isn't that what everyone
dialog: thinks but is afraid to say? I mean, i's
dialog: science. I'm-I don't want a relationship
dialog: either. Let's just say that. And I
dialog: wouldn't even care whatever you do or I
dialog: do, I just wanna have tons of fun, like
dialog: no strings attached at all. I'm just
dialog: different from other girls.
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: LILLIAN

dialog: mean? He can't date anyone in the summer?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I guess? I don't know. I feel so stupid
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: No he's stupid Ann, not you.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I think I might be a little bit stupid.
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: Ew. Did you have sex with him?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: No! But I gave him a blow job.
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Well, he kept putting it in my face.
text: Lillian's boyfriend DOUGIE enters the bedroom eating a

dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: Well, at least he was honest with you so
dialog: you don't waste your time with him.
speaker_heading: DOUGIE
dialog: Baby, look how hard I worked out. Look at
dialog: all this sweat.
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: Can you see that I'm on the phone? I'm
text: talking to Annie.
speaker_heading: DOUGIE

speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: Are you eating my Luna Bar? Those are for

speaker_heading: DOUGIE (O.S.)
dialog: I'm gonna play with my new boobs in

speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: I swear I cannot handle him right now. He
dialog: has been driving me crazy. Sometimes it
dialog: feels like I'm kissing my brother. I
dialog: don't know what do.
text: Annie pulls into an alleyway behind HARRINGTO'S JEWELRY
text: STORE and starts changing into her work uniform in the
text: car. A white blouse and navy skirt.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: At least you have someone. God, wha's
dialog: wrong with me?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: There's nothing wrong with you. But I
dialog: think maybe, and don't get mad at me,
dialog: I've said this to you before, you need to
dialog: stop trying so hard.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I still don't think I do that.
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: OK, so you had a first date last night.
dialog: Did you bring him a present?
text: Annie is silent.
speaker_heading: LILLIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ann, what did I tell you?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I brought him lemon-bars because I was
dialog: making them anyway, as a friend. Yo're
dialog: right, that's weird.
speaker_heading: DOUGIE (O.S.)
dialog: Shit!
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: DOUGIE (O.S)
dialog: I just chipped a nail!
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: Ok, I don't know if it's because I'm
dialog: tired or what, but I wanna kill him.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Ok, just take a deep breath, look in the
dialog: mirror and remember when I was getting my
text: braces off and farted at the
dialog: orthodontist.
text: Lillian laughs.
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: Oh my God. We need to hang out. 'm
dialog: coming to Milwaukee this weekend.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Are you serious?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: We'll go to Joni's and pig out and I'll
dialog: bring some shitty magazines, and I'm
dialog: gonna spend the night.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: God, I haven't seen you in months!
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: I'll call you tomorrow. Bye.
text: They hang up. Dougie is in the doorway wearing her

speaker_heading: DOUGIE

speaker_heading: LILLIAN

text: semicircle.
text: Annie and six other employees gather around DONNA.
speaker_heading: DONNA (CONT'D)
dialog: (slightly overdramatic) Something
dialog: terrible has happened. Donald will not
dialog: be coming in to work today. He stepped
text: on a wasp and there is some uncomfortable
dialog: swelling.
text: Employees mumble.
speaker_heading: DONNA (CONT'D)
dialog: Annie? Where's your tie?
text: Everyone looks at Annie. She holds it up and starts to
dialog: put it on.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: DONNA (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, I have an eye doctor's appointment
dialog: that I can't change or they'll will
dialog: charge me. So someone will have to cover
dialog: for Donald in engagement rings. Now I--
text: Annie and SANDY, a male co-worker, shoot their hands the
text: air eagerly.
speaker_heading: DONNA (CONT'D)
dialog: Sandy? Today's your day.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Ooh, my horoscope said I would be
dialog: presented with an opportunity at work
dialog: today. That is eerie. That is eerie.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Annie, that means you'll be alone in
dialog: keepsakes. You think you can handle it?
speaker_heading: EMPLOYEE (SOTTO)
dialog: Yeah, look out. There might be a bum-
dialog: rush for letter openers...
text: The employees snicker.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Sometimes there is, so....there have

speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Alright everybody, let's get to work!
dialog: Saneel?!...OPEN SESAME!
text: SANEEL, the security guard, rolls his eyes and unlocks
text: the doors. Everyone goes to work. Donna gathers her
text: things and starts walking towards the exit with Annie
text: tailing behind her.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Donna, can I talk to you for a second? I
dialog: feel like if you gave me a shot at
dialog: engagement rings sometime, I could really-
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Annie, what is the calibration of a 2
dialog: carat diamond in a standard English
dialog: setting?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Five?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: I just made all of that up. None of that
dialog: was real. I just put words together.
dialog: You're not ready for the big leagues.
dialog: Understand?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: It's so hard to make commission over
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Sweetheart...did I ever tell you the
dialog: story of the little paralyzed Chinese
dialog: girl who wanted to be dancer?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Many times.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: She was paralyzed Annie, had no feeling
text: in her legs, and then one day after years
dialog: of believing in herself, she stood up out
dialog: of that chair and tap-danced for the
dialog: king. On his birthday! My point is, Sandy
dialog: makes a real effort around here. He
dialog: connects with the customer. And when he
text: wants to make a sale, he goes for it.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Okay. (beat) I do want it.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: (smiling) Good. Showing up on time is a
dialog: wonderful place to start.
text: Donna talks to herself and gathers her things.
speaker_heading: DONNA (CONT'D)
dialog: Uhh! A wasp! Who walks around even their
dialog: own backyard without at least a thin
dialog: sandal. It's reckless!
text: Donna exits. A customer passes Anni's section.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Hello, can I interest you in a sterling
dialog: silver money clip that will create
dialog: memories for you and your family? No?

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Noooo. That's, that's sooo smart.
text: Annie enters the apartment, tired. She throws her keys
text: down and sifts through her mail. Steve presses mute.
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: There you are, you stayer-out-all-
dialog: nighter. Did you make out? Sleep over?
text: As Annie heads for her bedroom, he walks towards her
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't go in the bathroom. Are you going
dialog: to bed?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yes. I'm beat.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Your ex-boyfriend got more mail, I did
dialog: what you said and just threw it away.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Thanks. Goodnight Steve!
text: She shuts the door behind her.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: That credit lady called! She wants to
dialog: talk to you, Annie! She's gonna find you.
text: Steve sits back on the couch, un-mutes the T.V..
speaker_heading: ALLEN (ON SHOW)

speaker_heading: ANNIE

speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Cool! They're making a WKRP movie.
speaker_heading: LILLIAN

speaker_heading: ANNIE

speaker_heading: LILLIAN

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Lillian! What is that?!
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: I'm engaged.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: What?!!
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: He proposed at dinner last night. I
dialog: wanted to tell you in person and show you
dialog: this rock!
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: It's beautiful. Lillian. Oh my God, this
dialog: is...this is crazy!
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: I know Dougie and I have been fighting a
dialog: lot, but I've been so stressed out with
speaker_heading: WORK--
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: That's not I mean. I mean, I remember
dialog: when we met him at Lake Mills. You lost
dialog: your virginity to him right in front of
dialog: me on the dock, remember?
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: Oh you want to get into who's done what
dialog: down at the lake?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: No, I don't. It's just making me realize
dialog: how long we've known each other.
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: Well then, who better to be my Maid of
dialog: Honor?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh my God! I don't know what to say!
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: Annie, you're my best friend. Honestly I
dialog: didn't even have to think about it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Uh, wow. Yes! Of course! Yes! My God.
dialog: I've never been in a wedding.
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: It's no big deal, and I don't want to
dialog: make it one. It's not gonna be a big
dialog: crazy thing. I wanna keep it simple.
dialog: (beat) What dessert are you gonna get?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I know what you're doing. Don't downplay
dialog: this. I'm happy for you. And someday when
dialog: hell freezes over and I get married, you
dialog: can be my Maid of Honor. But for right
dialog: now, this is about you. OK? This is
dialog: you're day, and it is a big deal.
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: Ok, but I still don't want this to be a
dialog: huge production. I just want to have all
dialog: my friends meet each other, have fun,
dialog: dance, drink, whatever.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Then that's what it'll be. Did you guys
dialog: set a date?
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: Oh God, not yet. I don't want a super
dialog: long engagement, but there's a lot to do.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Well you are very fortunate because you
dialog: happen have the best maid of honor in the
dialog: whole wide world, and--
text: Lillian's cell phone rings, she looks at it and smiles.
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: (mocking) Can you hold that thought. I's
dialog: my fiancee calling.
text: Lillian gets up laughing. Annie laughs along with her.
speaker_heading: ANNIE

speaker_heading: HELEN

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Well, what about this one?
text: Everybody stops and looks at Annie.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I think it would be flattering on
dialog: everyone and we could totally wear it
text: again. The sash comes in different colors
dialog: not just this one.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Everyone! We can't all have the dress
dialog: that we want. I've been in a lot of
dialog: weddings and when choosing a bridesmaid
dialog: dress, you must ask yourself, âIf
dialog: invited, would I wear this a dress
dialog: to...The ACADEMY AWARDS!â
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Ooo, I never thought of it that way.
text: All the girls agree.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: With that in mind, I say we wear this

speaker_heading: ANNIE

speaker_heading: HELEN

dialog: guys?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I love it. Right guys?
text: The girls all agree. Except Annie.
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: Cool. Let's eat!
text: Helen dumps the dress in Annie's arms and follows

speaker_heading: HELEN

speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: Ooh, good idea.

speaker_heading: LESLIE

speaker_heading: ANNIE

speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: So Annie, what's your deal? Are you

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: No, no. Not right now. I had a boyfriend
dialog: for three years but we broke up like six
dialog: months ago.
speaker_heading: BECCA
dialog: Oh, I hate to hear stuff like that! What
dialog: happened?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: It just didn't work out.

speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Well, I don't have it.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
text: Very few HPV infections show any signs or

text: Silent. Everyone is a little grossed out..
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyway, it's fine, the past is the past.
dialog: We weren't meant to be. My last pap-smear
dialog: came back normal so that's cule. But you
dialog: know, I'm dating, here and there...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Do you have anyone in mind to bring to

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh, I didn't even think about that.

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: And thanks again for coming from

speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ANNIE

speaker_heading: HOSTESS

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, I don't know about you but since

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: ANNIE

speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Annie Walker. I thought I heard your car

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Very funny, Officer...Jones?
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Jones? Oh boy. Guess somebody thought he
dialog: was a little more memorable than he was.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: No. Sorry. I'm a little out of it. I'm
dialog: not drunk.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: That's ok. Call me Rhodes. (notices her

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah. Recovering from a date.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: ANNIE

speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Yeah, trying to wean myself back to the

scene_heading: EXT - MINIMART. CONTINOUS.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Thanks for the drink. (beat) So are you
dialog: one of those cops that sits in that same
dialog: spot everyday and sneaks up on people?
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: A lot of people get up to high speeds on
dialog: this road. I tell people its better to
dialog: pay for a ticket than have your family
dialog: pay for a funeral.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: That's a very good point.
speaker_heading: OFFICER RHODES
dialog: Want a carrot?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yes. I'm starving.
speaker_heading: CONTINUOUS:

speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Oh, you got the ugly carrot.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: The what?

dialog:

speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: There's one in every bag. You should eat

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: No. I think you should eat it. The're

scene_heading: INT. RHODES' POLICE CAR.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I don't think I've ever wanted to get of

speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Yeah, I don't go on blind dates. It seems
dialog: unnatural.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I have no idea what am I going to tell my
dialog: friends who set us up.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Just tell her the truth.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah. You're probably right.
text: Now Rhodes and Annie are driving in his police car.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: It's an ok job. It's commission, so it's
dialog: unpredictable. I don't know, I always
dialog: wanted to finish my bachelor's but that's
dialog: kind of financially impossible right now.
dialog: Plus I'd feel like ninety around all
dialog: those college students.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: You know my dad used to say that life is
dialog: like a hallway of doors. You can stand at
dialog: the same door forever if you want. Or you
dialog: can open a different door. And that one
dialog: may not be the right door, but i'll open
dialog: up a whole new hallway of doors. Anyway,
dialog: it worked for me. I was kinda lost and I
dialog: opened a door and the next thing I knew I
dialog: was a cop. And I love my job.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Hmm. I think I get it?
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Or you can always sell moon-pies by the
text: side of the road.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Moonpies. What?
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: It's a joke. You had moon-pies in your

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh yeah.
scene_heading: INT. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT COUNTER. LATER
text: They are waiting in line.
speaker_heading: OFFICER RHODES
dialog: When I get married I don't want the kind
dialog: of wedding people have these days. I want
dialog: it to be like a carnival. You know dunk
dialog: tanks? People win prizes...
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah, and you can have elephants, trapeze
dialog: artists and a big scale to guess the
dialog: bride's weight.
speaker_heading: OFFICER RHODES
dialog: Ok, first of all that's a circus wedding
dialog: and I'm talking about a carnival wedding.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: ANNIE

speaker_heading: BURGERS
speaker_heading: OFFICER RHODES
dialog: And then she moved to Hawaii and now

dialog: And supposedly she has really long armpit
dialog: hair now. That's pretty much the last
dialog: girlfriend I had.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Well, lets just say my last boyfriend
dialog: that I lived with broke up with me over
dialog: the phone. Then come to find out, he had
dialog: borrowed $30,000 in my name without
dialog: telling me, putting me in horrible debt

speaker_heading: OFFICER RHODES

speaker_heading: RHODES

dialog: want to give you. I was gonna wait but, I
dialog: think you'll want this now.
text: He jokingly gives her the ugly carrot.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: For me?!
speaker_heading: OFFICER RHODES
dialog: Well I know you've had a terrible night.
text: He gives it to her. Her phone rings.
dialog:

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Sorry, one sec. Hello? Ted!? Hey! Oh my
dialog: gosh! No,no. Can you hold on a sec?
text: She waves at Rhodes and mouths...
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I guess I'll see you around?
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Yeah. Don't forget about those
text: taillights. They're really starting to
dialog: bug me.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: K. Bye.(to Ted) So, you're in town?
scene_heading: EXT - TED'S HOUSE. NEXT MORNING.
text: He opens the front door, leading Annie out again.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Next time I won't call so late.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: No, it was fine. Like I said, I mean I
dialog: was just driving.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Awesome. It's cool that we can just
dialog: hookup and whatever. No strings.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Me too. I love it. I feel good right now.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Cool. Bye.
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION. CONTINUOUS.

speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Annie, hi! I almost left, but they said

dialog: late.
text: Helen is standing there looking gorgeous.
speaker_heading: HELEN (CONT'D)
dialog: I had to come into Milwaukee for a
text: charity luncheon right down the street
dialog: and I thought I'd come in and say hi.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Hi!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: And as the leader of the bridesmaids, I
dialog: thought it'd be fun to pick up some
dialog: little gifts for all the girls.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Leader of the bridesmaids? Um, wouldn't
dialog: that technically be me? Honor?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Well, no, sweetie, you're the Maid of
dialog: Honor, and we're all bridesmaids, and out
dialog: of all of us, I'm the leader. Anyway, it
dialog: doesn't matter. Um, I wanted to get
dialog: something that we could wear to the
dialog: rehearsal dinner or something. That would
dialog: be fun. Where are the diamonds?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh, well, what about a nice pen..or a
text: tortoise-shell handled sterling silver
dialog: letter opener? No? Ok, let me get Sandy.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Oh! And Annie we really need to start

dialog:

speaker_heading: ANNIE

scene_heading: INT. ANNIE'S APT. THAT NIGHT.
text: Annie arrives home from work frazzled to find Steve on

speaker_heading: TV HOST
dialog: Wow, well I have never seen a

text: bus is stunning.
scene_heading: GIRL ON SHOW
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Unbelievable. (to Annie) You got another
dialog: package from your mom.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Hey thanks for saving my butt today. Like
dialog: I said I'll pay you back as soon as I
dialog: can.
text: She opens the package. And pulls out a red blazer.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: No problem. But you should always put gas
text: in when it gets to a quarter tank.
dialog: Especially cause you have such a shitty
dialog: car.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Thanks. Can I ask you a question? What do
dialog: you think of Vegas?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Ooo. Let me turn this off. Vegas is a
dialog: black hole but I must have it in my life.
dialog: Does that make sense?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I'm just asking because some of the girls
dialog: are talking about going for Lillia's
dialog: bachelorette party and I've never been.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Oh no. Now I don't know about weddings.
dialog: When you go on a bachelorette, does the
dialog: bride pay?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: No, everyone pays for themselves. And you
dialog: pay for the bride.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Ok, I'm gonna say no. You cannot afford
dialog: that. Vegas is not cheap. Airfare,
dialog: hotels, food, cars, drinks, clubs, show
dialog: tickets. Remember this morning? You
dialog: cannot afford Vegas.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Well, I could save up for it.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: No, you need to win a contest to go to
dialog: Vegas/You had gum for lunch yesterday.
dialog: Ooh, âNight Moves.â Can I have this?
text: A lightbulb goes off in Annie's head. Steve holds the
text: blazer out and reads the tag.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Told you I'd pay you back!
text: Annie runs into her room. She sits down at the computer
text: and begins typing feverishly.
dialog: We see these words: âDear bridal partyâ, âgreat ideaâ,
dialog: âbachelorette partyâ, âFloridaâ, âSea World!â, âFree
text: place to stay!â. She presses send, and is very pleased.

speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I just got your e-mail. Um...Sea World?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Well it's not just Sea World. It's a
dialog: weekend in Florida. See, when Lillian and
dialog: I were kids we went there and she loved
dialog: it and has always talked about going
dialog: back. Ask Dougie. I think it would really
dialog: mean a lot to her. We could stay at my
dialog: Dad's house, he won't even be there. Then
dialog: we could go out at night and got to the
dialog: beach and then Sea World on one of the
dialog: days.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: But a bachelorette at Sea World?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Like I said, Sea World would just be a
text: part of it.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Well, I have been talking to the other
dialog: girls, and I was thinking we should go to
dialog: Las Vegas!
text: Annie's other line rings.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh, can you hold on? That's my other
dialog: line.
text: She clicks over.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: BECCA (CONT'D)
dialog: I was just looking at your e-mail, yo're
dialog: so cute. Sea World. What about Turkey?
dialog: That's where we went for for MY
dialog: bachelorette.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh well, Turkey's really far away.
speaker_heading: BECCA
dialog: It's super old though! They have awesome
dialog: restaurants. It's very exotic. Have you

dialog: that.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Hang on...
text: Annie clicks back over to Helen.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Helen, I'm sorry can I call you back?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Just a few minutes. I'll call you back.
text: Annie clicks over.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Becca?
speaker_heading: BECCA
dialog: Hi. You know, if you wanna go some place
text: closer than Turkey. Helen JUST e-mailed
dialog: me about going to Vegas.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh, I don't know. Everybody always goes
dialog: to Vegas. It seems just cliche to me.
speaker_heading: BECCA
dialog: I never get sick of it. I love blackjack.
dialog: I have a system.

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh, my other line's ringing. Can I call

speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: I love your idea about Sea World.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Yeah, but then Helen just called me and
dialog: said we should go to Vegas.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: But Vegas is so hot, don't you think?
dialog: It's like, hot and dry. People get sick
dialog: there all the time.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: I haven't had that experience. My skin
dialog: always clears up there.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah, I just think it's probably not--
dialog: Hold on. (clicks over) Hello?
speaker_heading: MEGAN

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (defeated) No.

speaker_heading: LESLIE

dialog: nine years, this may be the last
dialog: bachelorette party of my career and I
text: want the sweaty nuggets of a gay man
dialog: pounding me in the face at some point
dialog: during this trip. I'll pay whatever I
dialog: have to pay. (to the kids) Tyler stop it,
dialog: put that back! Paul!
scene_heading: QUICK CUTS BETWEEN:
speaker_heading: BECCA
dialog: Vegas has these party busses that have
text: flat screens in them and dance floors--
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Or we could take hummer limos around
dialog: everywhere.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: That sounds really expensive.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Oh but it's gonna be so much fun! Besides
dialog: money shouldn't be a problem if Lillian's
dialog: our friend.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh no, no, I was just thinking about
dialog: everyone else. That's all I'm saying.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: What I'm saying is, they drop you off in
dialog: the middle of the desert. You have to
dialog: kill your own food and find your way
dialog: back. Not everyone makes it. Seriously.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: pushing her this whole time! Annie was
dialog: right.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Yeah!
text: Helen glares at Megan.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What are you talking about? The only
dialog: reason you're even in this wedding is
dialog: because you're the groom's sister.
dialog: Weirdo.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: I'd rather be the groom's sister than
dialog: have cameltoe from my $600 pants.
text: We see that Helen has cameltoe. Megan has surprised them.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Why is everyone attacking me? I wasn't
dialog: the one who caused a huge scene at
text: Lillian's bridal shower and made her cry.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 127.
text: Everyone looks at Annie.
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: I hate to interrupt this riveting
dialog: discussion but a really creepy guy in a
text: Trans Am just pulled over.
text: The guy gets out of the car. He is thirty-ish, wears at-
text: shirt with a cat on it and camouflage shorts.
speaker_heading: TRANS AM MAN
dialog: Hey it's pretty late. What are you ladies
dialog: doing?
text: Becca and Dana scramble into the woods. Leslie gets
text: behind the car.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
text: Just changing the tire.
speaker_heading: TRANS AM MAN
dialog: You guys need some man hands for that?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Nope I think we got it. But thank you.
text: He doesn't leave, the girls worriedly look at each other.
speaker_heading: TRANS AM MAN
dialog: Look, if you guys get tired, I live right
dialog: up that hill. You ladies can just leave
dialog: your car here, come on up and let us all
text: lay down together.
text: He starts to walk toward them. The girls are scared.
text: Annie gives Megan a look. Megan tries to distract him.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Hey! Are those snowflake rims?
text: The guy looks at Megan.
speaker_heading: TRANS AM MAN
dialog: Yeah, found âem in a junk yard. Restored
dialog: âem myself.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: I bet you got a formula 4OO under there?
speaker_heading: TRANS AM MAN
dialog: Well, well. Someone knows her cars.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 128.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: I'm in the Firebird club.
speaker_heading: TRANS AM MAN
dialog: You don't say. I never met a lady in the
dialog: FBC before.
text: He walks over to Megan, she gives Annie a nod. Annie
text: rushes to the tire and quickly continues changing it.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: You ever make it up to the Trans Am
dialog: Nationals in Dayton?
text: Becca, Dana, Leslie and Helen are huddled together. They
text: talk in a loud whisper.
speaker_heading: BECCA
dialog: What's happening? What's happening?
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: I can hear animals.
speaker_heading: BECCA
dialog: Be quiet!
text: The guy is moving closer to Megan.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Remember Smokey and the Bandit?
speaker_heading: TRANS AM MAN
dialog: It's my favorite movie. âGive me a Diablo
dialog: sandwich and a Dr. Pepper and make it
dialog: quick . I'm in a goddamn hurry.â
text: He leans into her.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Why don't you show me what's under the
dialog: hood?
text: Back at Helen's car. Leslie sneaks over to Annie.
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: How's it comin'?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
text: Almost there.
text: The guy has lifted up his hood and Mega's looking. He
text: puts his hands on her ass.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 129.
speaker_heading: TRANS AM MAN
dialog: You wanna get in the backseat?
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Uh...
text: He is really getting aggressive, pushing against her.
speaker_heading: MEGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey take it easy!
speaker_heading: HELEN (O.S.)
dialog: Hey what about me?
text: He turns around to be hit with a huge piece of wood by
text: Helen. He falls.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Oh my God!!
text: Annie is frantically releasing the jack.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: OK, everybody in the car! Get in! Megan,
dialog: Helen let's go!
text: All the girls scramble in the car, Helen starts it. Annie
text: is finishing.
speaker_heading: TRANS AM MAN
dialog: Hey you!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Annie get in!
speaker_heading: TRANS AM MAN
dialog: I'm gonna get you bitches!!
text: He is coming towards Annie! She turns towards him with
dialog: the jack.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Back away! Or I will shove this Jack so
dialog: far down your throat you will shit
dialog: out...your fucking..face!
speaker_heading: TRANS AM MAN
dialog: Whoa, whoa. Alright. Alright. I'm
dialog: leaving.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Get out!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 130.
speaker_heading: TRANS AM MAN
dialog: I am! I live up the hill though if you
dialog: change your mind.
text: Annie backs up and jumps in the car. Helen peels away.
text: The girls drive away fast.
speaker_heading: CONTINUOUS
text: The girls still driving. Megan's eating chips.
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: Megan I was freaked out when he leaned up
dialog: against you. That was a pretty gutsy
dialog: move.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Annie's the one who tried to make him eat
text: a car jack.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
text: Helen hit him over the head with a tree.
text: They all continue talking, Helen and Annie smile.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: There it is, turn left up here. Go down
dialog: the little hill. Ok, that's the driveway.
text: It's dark and very rustic. It's LILLIAN'S LAKE HOUSE FROM
text: THE FLASHBACK. Where Lillian and Dougie met.
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: God I haven't been here in forever.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: The house is right up here.
text: They pull up to a small cottage and get out of the car.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Her car's not here.
speaker_heading: DANA
text: Doesn't look like any lights are on.
speaker_heading: BECCA
dialog: She's not here.
text: Annie is sitting on the front step, defeated.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 131.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I thought she'd be here. I really thought
dialog: she'd be here. I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Annie, it's ok.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: No, it's not. I don't know what happened.
dialog: I messed everything up. Lillia's not
dialog: even talking to me. I think I'm so afraid
dialog: to see what's really happening.
dialog: Lillian's moving on to this great life
dialog: and I feel left behind. And know matter
dialog: how hard I try, I don't fit in to her
dialog: life now.
text: Everyone is silent.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Annie, Lillian loves you. (beat] I know I
dialog: haven't made things easy for you.. I
dialog: don't have a life and I am bored. Perry
dialog: is always away and I'm constantly alone
dialog: and she's been there. And I've been a
dialog: bridesmaid nine times and although I may
dialog: have implied it, I....I've never been a
dialog: Maid of Honor. I wanted to make
dialog: everything special for Lillian because...
dialog: I don't have a lot of friends. I wanted
dialog: her to like me better and to impress her,
dialog: and everyone else. And I'm just good at
dialog: throwing parties. I always have been. In
dialog: fact sometimes I think people only ask me
dialog: to be in their wedding's because of that.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Lillian wouldn't do that. If she asked
dialog: you to be in her wedding it's because you
dialog: are her friend. Trust me.
text: Dana is crying and takes a picture. The're both startled
text: by the flash.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I'm sorry about the Sea World tickets.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I'm sorry that when I left the shower I
dialog: told your neighbors you were shooting a
dialog: porn.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 132.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Oh, I didn't know that you did that.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh, well, sorry.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I deserved it.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I must say you do put on some pretty
dialog: spectacular events.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Well, I'm really rich.
text: They smile.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
text: It is getting pretty late.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: What should we do about Lillian?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: She'll come home when she's ready.
scene_heading: INT. ANNIE HALLWAY. LATE THAT NIGHT (EARLY AM]
text: Annie enters exhausted to find Lillian sitting against
text: her door. Annie walks up and slides down to sit next to
text: her. After a minute.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: Yeah. Didn't mean to make anyone worry.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: It's okay. I really am sorry.
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: I'm sorry too. I didnt want things to
dialog: turn out like this. I got so caught up in
dialog: the frenzy of everything, wanting this
dialog: one day to be perfect.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Well its easy to get caught up.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 133.
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: And it doesnt help that all my friends
dialog: hate eachother.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I'm sorry. But it's all good now. We all
dialog: talked and everythings cool.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Really?!
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yup, Helen and I are best friends now.
dialog: We're going shopping for cream sweaters
dialog: tomorrow.
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: She's really not so bad.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: I just wish the wedding hadnt become
dialog: about everything and everyone else but me
dialog: and Dougie. And now, it's become this
dialog: thing I never wanted. I did want simple.
dialog: I wanted colored lanterns, twinkly lights
dialog: and food everywhere. I wanted a DJ to
dialog: play all those stupid wedding songs.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: It's not too late to have those things.
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: I'm sorry I didn't know all the stuff you
dialog: were going through too.
text: Annie is clearly sad.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: It's fine. I just feel really lost right
speaker_heading: NOW AND--
text: Lillian hugs her.
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: Nothing's going to change.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh God dont say that.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 134.
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: I mean between you and me.
speaker_heading: ANNIE

dialog: woman.

speaker_heading: LILLIAN

text: the other side of it.
speaker_heading: RHODES (O.C.)
dialog: Need a ride ma'am?
text: It's Rhodes, leaning against his car like Jake in sixteen
text: candles. Annie is all smiles and walks up to him.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: How did you know I was here?
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: It was really complicated. I remembered
dialog: the name of this place, I called them up,

dialog: investigation and uh, made them tell me
dialog: all the weddings they had planned for the

speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Yes I did.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Did you like' em?
speaker_heading: RHODES

text: completely covered in ants.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Ooo, I didn't think about that.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 137.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: You probably should have put it in a
dialog: plastic wrap or maybe a foil or
dialog: something. Tupperware would've worked but
dialog: then I'd have to get it back to you-I'm
dialog: gonna kiss you right now so...
text: He walks to her and takes her in his arms. They are about
dialog: to kiss.
text: Rhodes stops.
speaker_heading: RHODES (CONT'D (CONT'D)

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 138.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Ooo, I didn't think about that.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: The real reason I came here today is that
dialog: I have something that belongs to you.
text: He opens his hand to reveal the ugly carrot. She smiles.
text: He stops the car and unlocks the passenger door. She gets
