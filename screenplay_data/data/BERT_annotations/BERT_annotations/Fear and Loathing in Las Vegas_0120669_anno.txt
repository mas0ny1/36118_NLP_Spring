dialog: Terry Gilliam &amp; Toy Grisoni
speaker_heading: BLACK SCREEN
text: A desert wind moans sadly. From somewhere within the wind
text: comes the tinkly, syrupy-sweet sounds of the Lennon Sisters
text: singing "My Favorite Things." A series of sepia images of
text: anti-war protests from the mid-sixties appear one after
text: another on the screen.
text: In the violently scrawled style of Ralph Steadman, the title
text: FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS splashes onto the screen. A
text: beat, and then it runs down and off revealing:
dialog: TITLE: "He who makes a beast of himself
dialog: Gets rid of the pain
dialog: Of being a man."
dialog: Dr. Johnson
scene_heading: The VOICE OF HUNTER S. THOMPSON -- a.k.a. RAOUL DUKE:
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: We were somewhere around Barstow on
dialog: the edge of the desert when the
dialog: drugs began to take hold.
scene_heading: AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
text: A red Chevy convertible -- THE RED SHARK -- wipes the black
dialog: screen.
scene_heading: EXT. ON THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY
scene_heading: AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
text: THE RED SHARK races down the desert highway at a hundred
text: miles an hour. THE STONES' "Sympathy For the Devil" blares.
speaker_heading: AT THE WHEEL
scene_heading: STRANGELY STILL AND TENSE, RAOUL DUKE DRIVES -- SKELETAL,
scene_heading: BEER IN HAND -- STARES STRAIGHT AHEAD.
text: BESIDE HIM, FACE TURNED TO THE SUN, EYES CLOSED BEHIND
scene_heading: WRAPAROUND SPANISH SUNGLASSES, IS HIS SWARTHY AND UNNERVINGLY
scene_heading: UNPREDICTABLE ATTORNEY, DR. GONZO.
text: The music pounds DUKE stares straight ahead. GONZO froths
text: up a can of beer - uses it as shaving foam.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: I remember saying something like:
dialog: "I feel a bit lightheaded. Maybe
dialog: you should drive..."
text: GONZO starts shaving.
dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
text: Suddenly there was a terrible roar
dialog: all around us and the sky was full
dialog: of what looked like huge bats, all
text: swooping and screeching and diving
dialog: around the car...
text: Close on DUKE -- shadows flutter across his face. The
text: reflections of bats swirl within his eyes. We push in close
text: to one eye ball -- SCREECHING SWIRLING BAT-LIKE SHAPES!
scene_heading: AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: ... and a voice was screaming: Holy
dialog: Jesus! What are these goddamn
dialog: animals?
dialog: CUT TO WIDE SHOT OF CAR -
text: DUKE, eyes rigid, flails at the air. No bats anywhere.
text: GONZO casually looks over...
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: What are you yelling about?
text: DUCK SCREECHES to the side of the road. The sudden wrench
text: makes GONZO nick his face with his razor.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Never mind. It's your turn to drive.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: No point mentioning these bats. I
dialog: thought. The poor bastard will see
dialog: them soon enough.
text: DUKE hops out of the car, keeping an eye out for bats,
text: frantically opens the trunk to reveal what looks like A
scene_heading: MOBILE POLICE NARCOTICS LAB. DUKE desperately rifles
text: through the impressive stash.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: We had two bags of grass, seventy-
dialog: five pellets of mescaline, five
text: sheets of high powered blotter
text: acid, a salt shaker half full of
dialog: cocaine, a whole galaxy of multi-
dialog: colored uppers, downers, screamers,
text: laughers... Also a quart of tequila,
text: a quart of rum, a case of beer, a
dialog: pint of raw ether and two dozen
dialog: amyls.
dialog: 3.
text: DUKE, eyes darting madly as he hears what sounds like the
text: SHRIEKS OF BATS returning, grabs an assortment along with
text: another six-pack of beer - slams the trunk shut and dives
text: back into the car.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: Not that we needed all that for the
dialog: trip, but once you get locked into
dialog: a serious drug collection, the
dialog: tendency is to push it as far as
dialog: you can.
text: THE RED SHARK RACES INTO THE DISTANCE... on the ground,
text: weakly flapping is a SEMI-SQUASHED, SLOWLY DYING ANIMAL... A
speaker_heading: BAT?
scene_heading: EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY
text: IN THE RED SHARK
text: GONZO grips the wheel - stares maniacally down the road - a
dialog: lousy driver.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: The only thing that really worried
dialog: me was the ether. There is nothing
dialog: in the world more helpless and
dialog: irresponsible and depraved than a
text: man in the depths of an ether binge.
dialog: And I knew we'd get into that
dialog: rotten stuff pretty soon.
text: The radio news wars with "SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL" on a tape
dialog: recorder.
speaker_heading: RADIO NEWS
dialog: An overdose of heroin was listed as
dialog: the official cause of death for
dialog: pretty 19 year old Diane Hanby
dialog: whose body was found stuffed in a
dialog: refrigerator last week...
text: GONZO changes the station - "ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE, SWEET
text: JESUS, ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE" vies with "SYMPATHY"... He
text: sings along - washes a couple of pills back with a new beer.
text: The RED SHARK fishtails.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: "One toke over the line, sweet
dialog: Jesus."
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (muttering to himself)
dialog: One toke. You poor fool. Wait
dialog: till you see those goddamn bats.
text: UP AHEAD - AT THE SIDE OF THE DESERTED ROAD
text: A LONE HITCHHIKER spots them, jumps up and sticks out a
text: thumb. The RED SHARK roars past. Then, fifty yards down
dialog: the road...
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Let's give that boy a lift.
text: GONZO wrenches the wheel - THE RED SHARK swerves to the side
dialog: of the road.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: We can't stop here - this is bat
dialog: country!
text: GONZO JAMS THE CAR INTO REVERSE AND ROCKETS BACKWARDS. The
text: HITCHHIKER races to the car. A poor OKIE KID with a big grin.
speaker_heading: HITCHHIKER
dialog: Hot damn! I never rode in a
dialog: convertible before!
text: Then the big grin freezes on the OKIE KID's face at the
text: sight of: DUKE and GONZO looking out at him with HYPER-
text: NORMAL, shit-eating SMILES.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Is that right? Well, I guess
dialog: you're about ready, eh?
text: The HITCHHIKER hesitates.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: We're your friends. We're not like
dialog: the others.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (hissing sharply)
dialog: No more of that talk or I'll put
dialog: the leeches on you.
text: DUKE turns back to the HITCHHIKER - smiles reassuringly.
scene_heading: EXT. EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY
text: The HITCHHIKER sits nervously in the back seat as the RED
text: SHARK screams down the road.
dialog: 5.
text: GONZO sings along to the tape player.
text: The HITCHHIKER's eyes go to the door - considers jumping out
dialog: and taking his chances.
text: DUKE, sweating bullets, STARES AT THE HITCHHIKER in the rear
dialog: view mirror.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: How long could we maintain, I
dialog: wondered. How long before one of
text: us starts raving and jabbering at
dialog: this boy? What will he think then?
dialog: This same lonely desert was the
dialog: last known home of the Manson family.
text: The HITCHHIKER's eyes notice a thin line of blood trickling
text: down GONZO's neck.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: Would he make that grim connection
dialog: when my attorney starts screaming
dialog: about bats and huge manta rays
dialog: coming down on the car?
text: DUKE's mouth moves intermittently - sometimes in sync with
dialog: the words, sometimes not.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: If so - well, we'll just have to
dialog: cut his head off and bury him
text: somewhere. Because it goes without
dialog: saying that we can't turn him loose.
dialog: He'd report us at once to some kind
dialog: of outback Nazi law enforcement
dialog: agency, and they'll run us down
dialog: like dogs...
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (out loud to himself)
dialog: Jesus! Did I say that?
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: Or just think it? Was I talking?
dialog: Did they hear me?
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: (reassuringly to HITCHHIKER)
text: It's okay. He's admiring the shape
dialog: of your skull.
text: DUKE gives the HITCHHIKER a FINE BIG GRIN and the HITCHHIKER
text: giggles nervously.
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: Maybe I better have a chat with
dialog: this boy I thought. Perhaps if I
dialog: explain things, he'll rest easy...
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (roaring over the
dialog: road noise)
dialog: THERE'S ONE THING YOU SHOULD
scene_heading: PROBABLY UNDERSTAND --
text: The HITCHHIKER stares at him, not blinking.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (yells)
dialog: CAN YOU HEAR ME?
text: The HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- terrified. DUKE climbs
text: into the back seat.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: That's good. Because I want you to
dialog: have all the background. This is a
dialog: very ominous assignment -- with
dialog: overtones of extreme personal
dialog: danger. I'm a Doctor of Journalism!
dialog: This is important, goddamnit! This
dialog: is a true story!...
speaker_heading: (WHACKS the BACK OF
speaker_heading: THE DRIVER'S SEAT
dialog: with his fist)
text: The CAR SWERVES SICKENINGLY, then straightens out.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: (screams)
dialog: Keep your hands off my fucking neck!
text: The HITCHHIKER makes a sudden lunge for freedom. DUKE GRABS
text: HIM BACK DOWN.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: Our vibrations were getting nasty --
dialog: but why? Was there no communication
dialog: in this car? Had we deteriorated
dialog: to the level of dumb beasts?
text: The HITCHHIKER STRUGGLES IN PANIC.
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: DUKE
speaker_heading: (to HITCHHIKER)
dialog: I want you to understand that this
dialog: man at the wheel is my attorney!
dialog: He's not just some dingbat I found
dialog: on the Strip. He's a foreigner. I
dialog: think he's probably Samoan. But it
dialog: doesn't matter, does it? Are you
dialog: prejudiced?
speaker_heading: HITCHHIKER
dialog: Hell, no!
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: I didn't think so. Because in
dialog: spite of his race, this man is
dialog: extremely valuable to me. Hell, I
dialog: forgot all about this beer. You
dialog: want one?
speaker_heading: (HITCHHIKER shakes
dialog: his head)
dialog: How about some ether?
speaker_heading: HITCHHIKER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Never mind. Let's get right to the
dialog: heart of this thing. Twenty-four
dialog: hours ago we were sitting in the
dialog: Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills
dialog: Hotel...
scene_heading: INT. THE BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL POGO LOUNGE 1971 - DAY
text: A uniformed DWARF, carries a shockingly PINK TELEPHONE
text: through the glittering, tranquil POGO LOUNGE CROWD. They
scene_heading: are the ELOI. HENDRIX AFROS and DROOPING MUSTACHES and BELL
text: BOTTOMS and LOVE BEADS and BELLS. ACTRESSES sip Singapore
text: Slings and PROMOTERS sip ACTRESSES in this MONIED, SANITISED
text: VERSION OF THE GREAT REVOLUTION YEARS.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: ... in the patio section, of
dialog: course, drinking Singapore Slings
text: with mescal on the side, hiding
dialog: from the brutish realities of this
dialog: foul year of Our Lord, 1971.
text: The DWARF reaches DUKE -- T-shirt, levis, sneakers and
text: shades. GONZO -- white rayon bellbottoms and a khaki tank
text: top undershirt. They are in the middle of a serious
dialog: conversation.
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: I'm telling you, the Salazar story
dialog: is getting too complicated. The
text: weasels have started closing in.
text: The DWARF sneers.
speaker_heading: DWARF
dialog: Perhaps this is the call you've
dialog: been waiting for all this time,
dialog: sir...
text: DUKE lifts the receiver -- listens...
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Uh-huh...
text: DUKE hangs up the PHONE with the DEAD-PAN EXPRESSION OF A
speaker_heading: MOVIE SPY.
speaker_heading: DWARF
dialog: That was headquarters. They want
dialog: me to go to Las Vegas at once and
dialog: make contact with a Portuguese
dialog: photographer named Lacerda. He'll
dialog: have the details. All I have to do
dialog: is check into my sound proof suite
dialog: and he'll seek me out.
text: GONZO, says nothing for a moment, then POUNDS the table!
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: God hell! I think I see the
dialog: pattern! This one sounds like real
dialog: trouble! You're going to need
dialog: plenty of legal advice before this
dialog: thing is over. As your attorney I
dialog: must advise you that you'll need a
text: very fast car with no top and after
dialog: that, the cocaine. And then the
dialog: tape recorder, for special music,
dialog: and some Acapulco shirts...
dialog: (GONZO tucks his
dialog: khaki undershirt into
dialog: his white
dialog: bellbottoms -- he
dialog: means business!)
dialog: This blows my weekend, because
dialog: naturally I'll have to go with
dialog: you -- and we'll have to arm
dialog: ourselves.
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Why not? If a thing's worth doing,
dialog: it's worth doing right.
text: DUKE and GONZO are up and off. The DWARF chases after them
text: with the (very large) check in his hand.
text: They sweep out through the Lounge door, unaware of it
text: swinging back into the face of the pursuing DWARF.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: I tell you, my man. This is the
dialog: American Dream in action! We'd be
dialog: fools not to ride this strange
text: torpedo all the way to the end.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Indeed. We must do it. What kind
dialog: of story is this?
scene_heading: EXT. BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL - FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY
text: DUKE and GONZO emerge.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: The Mint 400! The richest off-road
dialog: race for motorcycles and dune-
dialog: buggies in the history of organized
dialog: sport!
dialog: (handing parking
dialog: ticket to Valet)
dialog: -- a fantastic spectacle in honor
dialog: of some fatback grossero who owns
dialog: the luxurious Mint Hotel in the
dialog: heart of downtown Vegas... at least
dialog: that's what the press release says.
text: Their car arrives -- rusted out, smashed door panels. They
dialog: jump in.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: We're going to have to drum it up
dialog: on our own. Pure Gonzo Journalism.
text: And they're off in a cloud of black exhaust as the nose-
text: bleeding DWARF stumbles out with the unpaid bill in his hand.
scene_heading: EXT. SUNSET BLVD - DAY
text: The PINTO races through shot.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: Getting hold of the drugs and
dialog: shirts had been no problem...
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: EXT. POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY
text: The PINTO skids to a halt outside Polynesian bar, the back
text: window full of Hawaiian shirts.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
dialog: ... but the car and tape recorder
dialog: were not easy things to round up at
text: 6:30 on a Friday afternoon in
dialog: Hollywood.
scene_heading: INT. POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY
text: TORN YELLOW PAGES with dealer's ads ticked off lie in a pile
text: as GONZO yells into a PAYPHONE. DUKE carries over four
dialog: Singapore Slings.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: O.K., O.K., yes. Hang onto it.
dialog: We'll be there in thirty minutes.
dialog: (to DUKE -- hand over
speaker_heading: the PHONE)
dialog: I finally located a car with
dialog: adequate horsepower and the proper
dialog: coloring.
speaker_heading: (into PHONE)
dialog: What?! OF COURSE the gentleman has
dialog: a major credit card! Do you
dialog: realize who the fuck you're talking
dialog: to?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Don't take any guff from these
dialog: swine.
speaker_heading: (GONZO slams the
dialog: phone down)
dialog: Now we need a sound store with the
dialog: finest equipment. Nothing dinky.
dialog: One of those new Belgian Heliowatts
text: with a voice-activated shotgun
dialog: mike, for picking up conversations
text: in oncoming cars.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: We won't make the nut unless we
dialog: have unlimited credit.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: We will. You Samoans are all the
dialog: same. You have no faith in the
dialog: essential decency of the white
dialog: man's culture.
dialog: 11.
scene_heading: EXT. SUNSET BLVD - DUSK
text: The PINTO races down street.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: The store was closed, but the
dialog: salesman said he would wait, if we
dialog: hurried...
scene_heading: EXT. SUNSET BLVD - TRAFFIC JAM - DUSK
text: They're stuck in a traffic jam -- clouds of exhaust. DUKE
text: BANGS ON THE HORN IN FURY.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: But we were delayed en route when a
dialog: Stingray in front of us killed a
dialog: pedestrain.
text: Directly in front of them: BLOODY CARNAGE -- a covered
text: corpse is loaded into an ambulance by PARAMEDICS.
scene_heading: EXT. CAR RENTAL AGENCY - NIGHT
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: We had trouble, again, at the car
dialog: rental agency.
text: Behind the wheel of the RED SHARK: DUKE grins with
text: satisfaction -- checking it out. A nervous AGENT holds out
text: a clipboard. DUKE signs without looking at the rental papers.
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: Say... uh... you fellas are going
dialog: to be careful with this car, aren't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Of course.
text: DUKE throws the car into reverse -- roars backwards past the
text: gas pumps to where GONZO is unloading their rusted out car.
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: Well, good god! You just backed
text: over that two foot concrete abutment
dialog: and you didn't even slow down!
dialog: Forty-five in reverse! And you
dialog: barely missed the pump!
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: No harm done. I always test the
dialog: transmission that way. The rear
dialog: end. For stress factors.
dialog: 12.
text: GONZO transfers boxes of new sound equipment and a large box
text: of rum and ice into the RED SHARK.
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: Say. Are you fellows drinking?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Not me. We're responsible people.
text: He JAMS the car into LOW GEAR and lurches into traffic. The
text: AGENT runs into the street and helplessly watches them go.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: There's another worrier. He's
text: probably all cranked up on speed.
scene_heading: EXT. RUNDOWN BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT
text: STRANGE AND MAGICAL. In the moonlight: the silhouetted
text: figures of DUKE and GONZO as they pack the RED SHARK.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: We spent the rest of that night
dialog: rounding up materials and packing
dialog: the car. Then we ate some mescaline
dialog: and went swimming.
text: The surf crashes in the distance...
scene_heading: EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT
text: DUKE cries out as he dives into the ocean. He lets himself
text: float up through the silvery bubbles...
text: DUKE AND GONZO FLOAT BEATIFICALLY IN THE GLOWING, SHIMMERING
scene_heading: MOONLIT SURF.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: Our trip was different. It was to
dialog: be a classic affirmation of
dialog: everything right and true in the
dialog: national character; a gross,
dialog: physical salute to the fantastic
dialog: possibilities of life in this
dialog: country. But only for those with
dialog: true grit...
scene_heading: EXT. AND EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY
text: DUKE's intense face.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: ...and we're chock full of that!
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Damn right!
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: My attorney understands this
dialog: concept, despite his racial handicap.
dialog: But do you?!
text: The HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- petrified.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: He said he understood, but I could
text: see in his eyes that he didn't. He
dialog: was lying to me.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: My heart!
text: GONZO clutches his heart. The car veers off the road and
text: screeches to a halt. He slumps over the wheel.
speaker_heading: GONZO (CONT'D)
dialog: Where's the medicine?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: The medicine? Yes, it's right here.
text: DUKE spills out 4 AMYL CAPSULES from a tin.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Don't worry, this man has a bad
dialog: heart... Angina Pectoris. But we
dialog: have a cure for it.
scene_heading: DUKE and GONZO break 2 AMYLS apiece -- INHALE DEEPLY. GONZO
text: falls back on the seat, staring straight up at the sun. The
text: HITCHHIKER looks petrified.
speaker_heading: GONZO
text: (suddenly flailing
text: his naked arms at the sky)
dialog: Turn up the fucking music! My
dialog: heart feels like an alligator!
dialog: Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must
dialog: have bass! What's wrong with us?
dialog: Are you goddamn old ladies?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (turns up music to
dialog: full volume)
dialog: You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch
dialog: your language! You're talking to a
dialog: Doctor of Journalism!
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: (laughing uncontrollably)
dialog: What the fuck are we doing out here?
dialog: Somebody call the police! We need
dialog: help!
speaker_heading: DUKE
speaker_heading: (to HITCHHIKER)
dialog: Pay no attention to this swine. He
dialog: can't handle the medicine.
dialog: (he begins laughing)
speaker_heading: GONZO
speaker_heading: (to the HITCHHIKER)
dialog: The truth is we're going to Vegas
dialog: to croak a scag baron named Savage
dialog: Henry. I've known him for years
dialog: but he ripped us off -- and you
dialog: know what that means, right?
text: GONZO pulls out a .357 Magnum -- waves it around.
speaker_heading: GONZO (CONT'D)
dialog: Savage Henry has cashed his check!
dialog: We're going to rip his lungs out!
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: And eat them! That bastard won't
dialog: get away with this! What's going
dialog: on in this country when a scum
dialog: sucker like that can get away with
dialog: sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?
text: GONZO cracks ANOTHER AMYL.
text: The HITCHHIKER SCRAMBLES OUT OF THE CAR, DOWN THE TRUNK LID,
text: AND FLEES.
speaker_heading: HITCHHIKER
dialog: Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot.
dialog: I like you guys. Don't worry about
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (yells)
dialog: Wait a minute! Come back and have
dialog: a beer!
text: The HITCHHIKER RUNS from car.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Good riddance. That boy made me
dialog: nervous. Did you see his eyes?
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Jesus, this is good medicine.
text: DUKE glances back at the running HITCHHIKER.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (suddenly clambering
dialog: into the front seat)
dialog: Move over!! We have to get out of
dialog: California before that kid finds a
dialog: cop!
text: DUKE GUNS THE RED SHARK -- TAKES OFF DOWN THE ROAD...
scene_heading: EXT. UNBELIEVABLY FAR DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY
text: THE RED SHARK races -- DUKE at the wheel -- straight ahead
dialog: driving.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: It was absolutely imperative that
dialog: we get to the Mint Hotel before the
dialog: deadline for press registration.
dialog: Otherwise, we might have to pay for
dialog: our suite.
text: GONZO wrestles with a shaker of COCAINE. The top comes off
text: and the powder swirls away on the wind.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Oh, Jesus! Did you see what god
dialog: just did to us?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: God didn't do that! You did it!
dialog: You're a fucking narcotics agent,
dialog: that was our cocaine, you pig!
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: (waving his .357
dialog: Magnum at Duke)
dialog: You better be careful. Plenty of
dialog: vultures out here. They'll pick
dialog: your bones clean before morning.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: You whore!
text: GONZO tears up a BLOTTER OF ACID.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Here -- chew this. It's your half
dialog: of the acid.
text: DUKE takes his half -- chews it.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: How long do I have?
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Maybe thirty more minutes. As your
dialog: attorney, I advise you to drive at
dialog: top speed. It'll be a goddamn
dialog: miracle if we can get there before
dialog: you turn into a wild animal. Are
dialog: you ready for that? Checking into
text: a Vegas hotel under a phony name
dialog: with intent to commit capital fraud
text: and a head full of acid.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: Thirty minutes. It was going to be
dialog: very close.
text: The RED SHARK screams along the highway past a billboard:
scene_heading: "DON'T GAMBLE WITH MARIJUANA! \ IN NEVADA: POSSESSION - 20
dialog: YEARS; SALE - LIFE!!"
scene_heading: EXT. LAS VEGAS MINT HOTEL - DUSK
text: The RED SHARK pulls up outside the MINT. A great banner
text: spanning the street announces the MINT 400.
text: DUKE can feel the drug surging up inside him. Clutching a
text: buckled beer can, sweat pouring, he stares fixedly at the
text: TICKET the ATTENDANT gives him.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: I need this, right?
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: I'll remember your face.
text: DUKE stares -- losing it...
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: There is no way of explaining the
dialog: terror I felt.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
text: DUKE waits in line at the front desk -- RIGID WITH PENT UP
text: ENERGY. GONZO's ahead of him -- muscling in -- trying to
text: queue jump and failing.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: I was pouring sweat. My blood is
dialog: too thick for Nevada. I've never
dialog: been able to properly explain
dialog: myself in this climate.
text: A COUPLE move off and DUKE jerks forward -- stops -- eyes
text: fixed on the stony FEMALE RESERVATIONS CLERK.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
dialog: Be quiet, be calm... name, rank,
dialog: and press affiliation, nothing
dialog: else...
text: DUKE moves ANOTHER RIGID STEP CLOSER to the desk -- the
text: tension almost snapping him in two. GONZO's FLAPPING
dialog: AROUND -- absolutely no success.
text: Something catches DUKE's eye... He REMAINS ROOTED -- his
text: eyes turning to the VEGETAL PAISLEY PATTERNS ON THE CARPET
scene_heading: WHICH ARE SHIFTING -- UNDULATING. THE CARPET PATTERNS ARE

speaker_heading: DUKE
scene_heading: HI THERE. MY NAME... AH, RAOUL

scene_heading: FOR SURE. FREE LUNCH, FINAL
scene_heading: WISDOM, TOTAL COVERAGE... WHY NOT?
dialog: I HAVE MY ATTORNEY WITH ME, AND I
text: REALIZE OF COURSE...
text: As DUKE stares at her, BABBLING, her FACE BEGINS TO MORPH.
text: He tries to stop it happening by TALKING FASTER.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: ... THAT HIS NAME IS NOT ON THE
dialog: LIST, BUT WE MUST HAVE THAT SUITE.
dialog: YES. JUST CHECK THE LIST AND
dialog: YOU'LL SEE. DON'T WORRY. WHAT'S

scene_heading: RESERVATIONS CLERK
dialog: (hands him an envelope)
dialog: Your suite's not ready yet. But
dialog: there's somebody looking for you.
text: Her face is CHANGING -- SWELLING -- PULSING...
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: NO! WHY? WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING
speaker_heading: YET!
text: The FACE OF THE RESERVATIONS CLERK TURNS GREEN &amp; GROWS FANGS.
text: DEADLY POISON! DUKE LUNGES BACK at GONZO, who GRIPS his arm
text: intensely -- REACHES OUT to take the ENVELOPE.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: I can handle this. This man has a
dialog: bad heart, but I have plenty of
dialog: medicine. My name is Dr. Gonzo.
dialog: Prepare our suite at once. We'll
dialog: be in the bar.
text: GONZO manoeuvres DUKE away from the desk. DUKE looks

scene_heading: INT. NAUTICAL BAR - DAY
text: The bar -- OILY PEOPLE -- quiet music -- nautical theme.

dialog: Two Cuba Libres with beer and
text: mescal on the side.
dialog: (opens the envelope)
dialog: Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us
dialog: in a room on the twelfth floor?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Lacerda?
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: I couldn't remember. The name rang
dialog: a bell, but I couldn't concentrate.
dialog: Terrible things were happening all
dialog: around us...
text: DUKE is staring -- RAPT -- TERRIFIED. BLOOD FLOWS FREELY
text: onto the floor. DUKE keeps his voice low.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Order some golf shoes. Otherwise,
dialog: we'll never get out of this place
dialog: alive. It's impossible to walk in
dialog: this muck -- no footing at all...
text: DUKE looks up -- GONZO has disappeared.
text: DUKE looks around him -- the entire room has TRANSFORMED
text: into a ROOM FILLED WITH REPTILES IN CLOTHES, DRINKING AND
text: GNAWING AT ONE ANOTHER.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: I was right in the middle of a
dialog: fucking reptile zoo. And somebody
dialog: was giving booze to these goddamn
dialog: things! It won't be long before
dialog: they tear us to shreds!
text: GONZO IS SUDDENLY BACK -- AT DUKE'S SHOULDER.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: If you think we're in trouble now
dialog: wait until you see what's happening
text: in the elevators.
text: GONZO removes his sunshades and we see he's been crying...
text: as he speaks he seems to be floating. Duke struggles to
dialog: keep him in his line of vision.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: I just went upstairs to see this
dialog: man Lacerda. I told him I knew
dialog: what he was up to...
speaker_heading: (GONZO rallies --
dialog: turns fierce)
dialog: He says he's a photographer! But
dialog: when I mentioned Savage Henry he
dialog: freaked! He knows we're onto him!
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: But what about our room? And the
dialog: golf shoes?
text: A GROUP OF REPTILES AT A TABLE ACROSS THE ROOM stares at
text: them, BLOOD DRIPPING FROM THEIR FANGS.
speaker_heading: DUKE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (grabbing GONZO
dialog: trying to hold him still)
dialog: Holy shit! Look at that bunch over
dialog: there! They've spotted us!
dialog: 20.
text: Cut to wider shot -- DUKE is holding on to a man standing
text: next to him at the bar. The room has returned to normality.
text: GONZO is sitting in his original position.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: (downs his drink --
dialog: gets up)
dialog: That's the press table. Where you
dialog: have to sign in for our credentials.
dialog: Shit, let's get it over with. You

speaker_heading: DUKE

scene_heading: INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DUSK
text: A TELEVISION shows the NIGHTLY NEWS. A BUDDHIST MONK,

speaker_heading: BELL BOY
dialog: Four club sandwiches, four shrimp
dialog: cocktails.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: There's a big... machine in the
dialog: sky... some kind of electric snake...
text: DUKE is curled by the window -- MESMERIZED by an unseen neon

text: colored lights.
speaker_heading: BELL BOY
dialog: ... a quart of rum...
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: ... coming straight at us.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Shoot it.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Not yet. I want to study its habits.
speaker_heading: BELL BOY
dialog: ... and nine fresh grapefruit.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Vitamin C. We'll need all we can
dialog: get.
text: GONZO sees the BELL BOY out the door -- turns and lays into
speaker_heading: DUKE.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Look, you've got to stop this talk
dialog: about snakes and leeches and
dialog: lizards and that stuff. It's
dialog: making me sick!
text: DUKE stares -- hears the drone of B52 BOMBERS...

scene_heading: DISASTERS -- EXPLOSIONS AND TWISTED WRECKAGE.
text: Newsreel footage of MAI LAI MASSACRE and the LIEUTENANT
text: CALLEY court-martial.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: You bastard! They'll never let us
dialog: back in that place. I leave you
dialog: alone for three minutes and you
dialog: start waving that goddamn marlin
dialog: spike around -- yelling about
dialog: reptiles! You scared the shit out
dialog: of those people! They were ready
dialog: to call the cops. Hell, the only
dialog: reason they gave us press passes
dialog: was to get you out of there...
text: A knock at the door. DUKE and GONZO break out in a sweat.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Oh my God! Who's that?!
text: GONZO STICKS HIS GUN IN HIS WAISTBAND -- opens the door to
scene_heading: LACERDA -- BOUNCING WITH PUPPY DOG ENTHUSIASM. GONZO stares
text: at a man he instantly hates -- watches him with deep
dialog: suspicion.
speaker_heading: LACERDA
dialog: Duke? I'm Lacerda your photographer.
dialog: Got your press passes? Good, good.
dialog: Too bad you missed the bikes
dialog: checking in. My, what a sight!
text: DUKE watches the B-52S DROP THEIR BOMB LOADS.
dialog: 22.
text: Looking down to the thick, patterned carpet, DUKE sees the
text: BOMBS EXPLODE like vicious flowers.
text: DUKE looks up: LACERDA is a war photographer -- bruised,
text: filthy and blood spattered. LACERDA approaches him --
text: talking a foreign language.
speaker_heading: LACERDA
dialog: Husquavarnas. Yamahas. Kawaskis.
dialog: Maicos. Pursang. Swedish Fireballs.
dialog: Couple of Triumphs, here and there
dialog: a CZ. All very fast. What a race
dialog: it's gonna be.
text: DUKE screws up his eyes -- WILLS NORMALITY BACK. LACERDA is
dialog: now just a keen photographer.L
speaker_heading: LACERDA
dialog: Well, we start at dawn. Get a good
dialog: night's sleep. I know I will.
text: And with a cheerful wave, he's gone. DUKE is in shock.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: That's good...
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: I think he's lying to us. I could
text: see it in his eyes.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (even weaker)
dialog: They'll probably have a big net for
dialog: us when we show up.
text: DUKE's attention returns to the devastation on the TV...
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Turn that shit off!
text: GONZO kills the TV.
dialog: Black screen.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: Never lose sight of the primary
dialog: responsibility. Cover the story.
dialog: But what was the story? Nobody had
dialog: bothered to say.
dialog: 23.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - DAWN
text: Against A BIG ORANGE SUN, on a concrete slab, MEN FIRE
text: SHOTGUNS into the dawn sky. Clay pigeons shatter. The Mint
dialog: Gun Club.
text: Next to them, MOTORCYCLES REV -- preparing for the MINT 400
text: RACE: A hundred BIKERS, MECHANICS and assorted MOTORSPORT
text: TYPES milling around in the pit area; taping headlights,
text: topping off oil in the forks, last minute bolt tightening.
text: DUKE wanders through.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
text: The racers were ready at dawn.
dialog: Very tense. But the race didn't
dialog: start until nine so we had three
dialog: long hours to kill.
text: A sign by a long trestle table: "KOFFEE &amp; DONUTS." DUKE
text: walks past -- ignoring the SMILING LADY behind the stall.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
dialog: Those of us who had been up all
dialog: night were in no mood for coffee
dialog: and donuts. We wanted strong drink.
dialog: We were, after all, the Absolute

speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: That's it! They're starting!
text: In a sudden rush the PRESS CROWD make for the door taking
text: DUKE with them.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - DAY
text: MOTORCYCLES REV -- tension builds...
text: A flag goes down. The CROWD cheers. The MOTORCYCLES ROAR

text: as they disappear into the desert...
dialog: A moment...
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Well, that's that. They'll be back
dialog: in an hour or so. Let's go back to
dialog: the bar.

scene_heading: INT. RACE BAR TENT - DAY

speaker_heading: HOODLUM
dialog: God damn! What day is this --
dialog: Saturday?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: More like Sunday.
speaker_heading: HOODLUM
dialog: Hah! That's a bitch, ain't it?
dialog: Last night I was home in Long Beach
dialog: and somebody said they were runnin'
dialog: the Mint 400 today, so I says to my
dialog: old lady, "Man, I'm goin'." So she
dialog: gives me a lot of crap about it, so
dialog: I start slappin' her around, and
dialog: the next thing you know two guys I
dialog: never seen before are beating me
dialog: stupid.
speaker_heading: VOICE OFF
dialog: Group 4!
text: Outside, another batch of motorcycles roar away -- kicking
text: up more clouds of dust.
speaker_heading: HOODLUM
dialog: Then they gave me ten bucks, put me
dialog: on a bus, and when I woke up here I
dialog: was in downtown Vegas, and for a
dialog: minute all I could think was, "O
dialog: Jesus, who's divorcing me this
dialog: time?" But then I remembered, by
dialog: God! I was here for the Mint 400.
dialog: And, man, I tell you, it's wonderful
dialog: to be here. Just wonderful to be

text: A silence. A MAGAZINE REPORTER lunges across the bar --

speaker_heading: DUKE

dialog: his palm)
dialog: Hell yes! Bring us ten!
speaker_heading: VOICE OFF
dialog: Group 5!
speaker_heading: MAGAZINE REPORTER
dialog: (screams)
dialog: I'll back it!
dialog: (slides off his stool
dialog: to the floor)
text: Outside, motorcycles roar away. The dust cloud billows into
text: the tent -- getting denser.
speaker_heading: MAGAZINE REPORTER (CONT'D)
dialog: (on the floor)
dialog: This is a magic moment in sport!
dialog: It may never come again! I once
dialog: did the Triple Crown, but it was
dialog: nothing like this.
text: A FROG-EYED WOMAN claws at the MAGAZINE REPORTER, tries to

speaker_heading: FROG-EYED WOMAN
dialog: Please stand up! You're a

scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - DAY
text: Nothing. Except for a THICK CLOUD OF DUST.
text: Barely visible, a motorcycle comes speeding into the pits.
text: The RIDER staggers off his bike. The PIT CREW gas it up and
text: sends it back with a FRESH RIDER.
text: DUKE watches him disappear back into the dust cloud.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: By 10 they were spread out all over
dialog: the course. It was no longer a
dialog: race, now it was an Endurance
dialog: Contest. The idea of trying to
dialog: "cover this race" in any
dialog: conventional press sense was absurd.
text: A HORN HONKS. A shiny BLACK BRONCO with DRIVER. LACERDA
text: hangs out of the window.
speaker_heading: LACERDA
dialog: It's great, isn't it?! Jump in!
text: DUKE gets into the Bronco and they head into the DUST CLOUD.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - DAY

speaker_heading: LACERDA
dialog: I'll just keep trying different

dialog: [What did he ask you, Rusty?]
dialog: "Did you fight or did you run?"
text: A moment later, the Bronco races out of the dust. DUKE
text: coughs, chokes, drinks beer.
speaker_heading: BATTLE HYMN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: [And what did you tell them,
dialog: Rusty?]
dialog: "We responded to their rifle fire
dialog: with everything we had..."
text: The sound of gun shots...
text: A DUNE BUGGY races toward them, loaded down with THREE
text: RETIRED PETTY OFFICERS, DRUNK AS HELL. The radio blares:
text: "THE BATTLE HYMN OF LIEUTENANT CALLEY."
text: The dune buggy is COVERED WITH OMINOUS SYMBOLS: SCREAMING
text: EAGLES CARRYING AMERICAN FLAGS IN THEIR CLAWS. A slant-eyed
text: Snake being chopped to bits by a buzz-saw made of stars and

text: yell over the roaring engines.
speaker_heading: DUNE BUGGY DRIVER
dialog: Where's the damn race?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Beats me. We're just good patriotic
dialog: Americans like yourself.
text: DUKE gives DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2 A NICE BIG GRIN. In

speaker_heading: DUNE BUGGY DRIVER
dialog: (suspiciously)
dialog: What outfit you fellas with?
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: The sporting press. We're

text: The DRIVER and DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2 exchange looks.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: If you want a good chase, you
dialog: should get after that skunk from

dialog: He's the man responsible for that
text: book, THE SELLING OF THE PENTAGON.
scene_heading: DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #1
speaker_heading: HOT DAMN!
scene_heading: DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2
dialog: A black jeep, you say?
dialog: And they ROAR away.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Take me back to the pits.
speaker_heading: LACERDA
dialog: No, no -- we have to go on. We
dialog: need total coverage.
text: DUKE gets out of the Bronco.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: You're fired.
text: After a moment's hesitation, LACERDA and the BRONCO driver
text: roar away leaving DUKE alone in the cloud of dust.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: It was time. I felt, for an
dialog: Agonizing Reappraisal of the whole
dialog: scene. The race was definitely
dialog: under way. I had witnessed the

speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: How about "Nickel Nick's Slot

dialog: heavy. Twenty-nine cent hotdogs...
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Look, what are we doing here? Are
dialog: we here to entertain ourselves, or
dialog: to do the job?
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: To do the job, of course. Here we
dialog: go... a Crab Louie and quart of

text: The Shark hits a bump.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: As your attorney I advise you to
dialog: drive over to the Tropicana and
dialog: pick up on Guy Lombardo. He's in
dialog: the Blue Room with his Royal
dialog: Canadians.
text: They hit another bump.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Why what?
text: CUT to wide shot. They are DRIVING AROUND IN CIRCLES in a
text: large casino parking lot, bumping over the dividers.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Why should I pay out my hard-earned
dialog: dollars to watch a fucking corpse.
dialog: I don't know about you, but in my

dialog: You can't park here!
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Why not? Is this not a reasonable

text: Reveal the RED SHARK parked on the sidewalk in front of the

text: GONZO leaps from the car, waving a five-dollar bill at the
speaker_heading: DOORMAN.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: We want this car parked! We drove
dialog: all the way from L.A. for this show.
dialog: We're friends of Debbie's.
text: A pause, then... the DOORMAN pockets the bill, hands them a

scene_heading: INT. DESERT FROM HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
text: DUKE and GONZO walk through the lobby. Black, mirrored,

speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Holy shit! They almost had us
dialog: there! That was quick thinking.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: What do you expect? I'm your
dialog: attorney. You owe me five bucks.
dialog: I want it now.
text: DUKE shrugs and hands over the $5.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: This was Bob Hope's turf. Frank
dialog: Sinatra's. Spiro Agnew's. It
dialog: seemed inappropriate to be haggling
dialog: about nickel/dime bribes for the

text: A WINE-COLORED TUXEDO stops them at the entrance to the

scene_heading: WINE-COLORED TUXEDO

speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Goddamnit, we drove all the way

speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Fuck seats! We're old friends of

text: GONZO and the WINE-COLORED TUXEDO get into an ugly arm-
text: waving negotiation.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: After a lot of bad noise, he let us
dialog: in for nothing provided we would
text: stand quietly at the back and not
dialog: smoke.
text: As DUKE and GONZO disappear through the door we can hear the
text: orchestra blasting out a HIGHLY BLANDIZED "SGT. PEPPER'S
text: LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND."
text: A beat.
text: The door flies open and BOUNCERS manhandle DUKE and GONZO

speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Jesus creeping shit!
speaker_heading: DUKE

speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: Ah, devil ether. It makes you

dialog: loss of all basic motor skills;
dialog: blurred vision, no balance, numb
dialog: tongue --
dialog: (throws away kleenex)
text: The mind recoils in horror, unable
dialog: to communicate with the spinal

text: DUKE and GONZO approach the entrance with elaborate care-
text: taking one step at a time -- trying to keep ahead of the drug.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: You approach the turnstiles and
dialog: know that when you get there, you

text: CRAZILY, unable to get money out of their pockets.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: Some angry Rotarian shoves you and
dialog: you think: What's happening here?
dialog: What's going on? Then you hear
dialog: yourself mumbling.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (mumbling)
dialog: Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of
dialog: mine. Watch out!... Why money? My
dialog: name is Brinks; I was born... Born?
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Get sheep over side... women and
dialog: children to armored car... orders
dialog: from Captain Zeep.
text: The ATTENDANTS indulgently escort them through the TURNSTILES.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: Ether is the perfect drug for Las

dialog: us loose inside.
scene_heading: INT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS CASINO - NIGHT

scene_heading: ACT with FOUR MUZZLED WOLVERINES, SIX NYMPHET SISTERS FROM
scene_heading: SAN DIEGO, TWO SILVER PAINTED POLACK BROTHERS, and THREE
scene_heading: KOREAN KITTENS.
text: The WOLVERINE chases a NYMPHET through the air. TWO POLACKS
text: swing at it from opposite sides and they are instantly
text: locked in a death battle.
text: All plummet to the nets suspended over the GAMBLING TABLES
text: and SLOT MACHINES. No one looks up. The GAMBLERS REMAIN
text: INTENT ON THE SPINNING ROULETTE WHEEL, THE TURN OF THE CARD,
text: THE ROLL OF A DICE.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: Bazooko Circus is what the whole
dialog: hep world would be doing Saturday
dialog: night if the Nazis had won the war.
dialog: This was the Sixth Reich.
text: Something causes DUKE to look down. A dwarf carrying drinks
text: on a tray is tugging DUKE's pants leg trying to get him to
dialog: move out of the way.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
dialog: A drug person can learn to cope
dialog: with things like seeing their dead
dialog: grandmother crawling up their leg
text: with a knife in her teeth but,
dialog: nobody should be asked to handle
dialog: this trip.
text: GONZO and DUKE go upstairs walking past funhouse booths.
text: One of them is manned by an orangutan in costume. A
text: FAIRGROUND BARKER grabs DUKE.
speaker_heading: FAIRGROUND BARKER
dialog: Stand in front of this fantastic
dialog: machine, my friend. For just 99
dialog: cents your likeness will appear 200
text: hundred feet tall on a screen above
dialog: downtown Las Vegas.
text: On a TV monitor a 200 FOOT HIGH DRUNKARD looms over the Las

dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: FAIRGROUND BARKER
dialog: 99 cents more for a voice message.
dialog: Say whatever you want, fella.
dialog: They'll hear you, don't worry about
dialog: that. Remember, you'll be 200 feet
dialog: tall!
speaker_heading: ANOTHER BARKER
dialog: Step right up! Shoot the pasties

speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: I hate to say this, but this place
dialog: is getting to me. I think I'm
dialog: getting The Fear.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Nonsense. We came here to find the
dialog: American Dream, and now we're right
dialog: in the vortex you want to quit.
dialog: You must realize that we've found
dialog: the Main Nerve.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: That's what gives me The Fear.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Look over there. Two women fucking
dialog: a Polar Bear.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Please, don't tell me those things...
dialog: Not now.
dialog: (signals the waitress
dialog: for two Wild Turkeys)
dialog: This is my last drink. How much
dialog: money can you lend me?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Not much. Why?
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: I have to go.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: GO?
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Calm down. You'll be straight in a
dialog: few hours.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: No. This is serious. One more
dialog: hour in this town and I'll kill
dialog: somebody!
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: OK. I'll lend you some money.
dialog: Let's go outside and see how much
dialog: we have left.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Can we make it?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: That depends on how many people we
dialog: fuck with between here and the door.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: I want to leave fast.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: OK. Lets pay this bill and get up
dialog: very slowly. It's going to be a
dialog: long walk.
dialog: (signals waitress who
dialog: comes over)
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: (suddenly to waitress)
dialog: Do they pay you to screw that bear?
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: He's just kidding.
speaker_heading: (to GONZO)
dialog: Come on, Doc -- lets go downstairs
dialog: and gamble.
text: GONZO trembles with fear -- walks to the edge of the
dialog: turntable.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: When does this thing stop?
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: It won't stop. It's not ever going
dialog: to stop.
text: DUKE carefully steps off the turntable.
text: GONZO, eyes staring blindly ahead, squiting in fear and
text: confusion, rooted to the spot, is carried away.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Don't move you'll come around.
text: DUKE reaches out to grab GONZO, who jumps back -- keeps
dialog: going around.
text: The BARTENDER narrows his eyes at them.
text: DUKE steps onto the merry-go-round -- hurries round the
text: bar -- approaching GONZO from the blind side and shoves
text: GONZO from behind. GONZO goes down with a hellish scream.
text: DUKE approaches him with his hands in the air. Smiling.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: You fell. Let's go.
text: GONZO refuses to move and stands tense, fists clenched,
dialog: looking for somebody to hit...an old woman perhaps?
speaker_heading: DUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: OK. You stay here and go to jail.
dialog: I'm leaving.
text: DUKE walks fast towards the stairs. GONZO catches up with
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Did you see that? Some sonofabitch
dialog: kicked me in the back.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Probably the bartender. He wanted
dialog: to stomp you for what you said to
dialog: the waitress.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Good God! Let's get out of here!
dialog: Where's the elevator?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (turning him in the
dialog: opposite direction)
dialog: Don't go near that elevator.
dialog: That's just what they want us to
dialog: do... trap us in a steel box and
dialog: take us down to the basement.
dialog: 39.
scene_heading: EXT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS CASINO - NIGHT
text: DUKE and GONZO stumble out of the entrance.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Don't run. They'd like any excuse

speaker_heading: GONZO

dialog: You drive! I think there's
dialog: something wrong with me.
scene_heading: INT. MINT HOTEL CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THEIR SUITE - NIGHT
scene_heading: DUKE AND GONZO RUN MADLY DOWN THE CORRIDOR... DUKE TAKING

text: GONZO STRUGGLES with the key in the lock.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Those bastards have changed the

text: The door SUDDENLY SWINGS OPEN. DUKE AND GONZO fall inside.
scene_heading: INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Bolt everything! Use all chains!
text: DUKE locks the door. The suite is crowded with ROOM SERVICE
text: GOODIES. DUKE turns to see GONZO staring at two hotel room
text: keys. EVERYTHING STOPS.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Where did this one come from?
text: DUKE snatches a key.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: That's Lacerda's room.
text: GONZO smiles a slow smile...
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Yeah... I thought we might need it...
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: What for?
text: GONZO snatches the key back.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Let's go up there and blast him out
text: of bed with the fire hose.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: No, we should leave the poor
dialog: bastard alone. I get the feeling
dialog: that he's avoiding us for some
dialog: reason.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese
dialog: son of a bitch is dangerous. He's
dialog: watching us like a hawk.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: He told me he was turning in early...
text: GONZO utters an anguished cry -- slaps the wall with both
dialog: hands.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: That dirty bastard! I knew it!
dialog: He's got hold of my woman!
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: That little blonde groupie with the

speaker_heading: GONZO

speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Where'd you get that knife?
scene_heading: GONZO SLICES THE GRAPEFRUIT -- MANIACAL.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Room service sent it up. I wanted
dialog: something to cut the limes.
scene_heading: GONZO SLICES THE GRAPEFRUIT -- INTO EIGHTHS!
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: What limes?
scene_heading: GONZO SLICES -- SIXTEENTHS!
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: They didn't have any. They don't
dialog: grow in the desert.
dialog: SLICE! SLICE! SLICE!
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: That dirty toad bastard! I knew I
dialog: should have taken him out when I
dialog: had the chance. Now he has her.
text: SLICE! SLICE! SLICE! GONZO SLASHES INSANELY!
text: DUKE watches -- straight-faced.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: I remember the girl. We'd had a
text: problem with her in the elevator a
dialog: few hours earlier: my attention had
dialog: made a fool of himself.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: An elevator door opens to reveal the SMILING FACES OF
text: LACERDA, THE BLONDE TV REPORTER AND HER CREW.
text: DUKE and GONZO stagger in.
text: LACERDA drops his smile. He's standing beside the BLONDE TV
text: REPORTER. A trembling GONZO moonily turns his eyes onto her.
speaker_heading: BLONDE TV REPORTER
dialog: (to Gonzo)
dialog: You must be a rider. What class
dialog: are you in?
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Class? What the fuck do you mean?
speaker_heading: BLONDE TV REPORTER
dialog: What do you ride? We're filming
dialog: the race for a TV series -- maybe
dialog: we can use you.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Use me?
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: Mother of God, I thought. Here it
dialog: comes.
text: GONZO is TREMBLING BADLY. There's a moment of uncomfortable
dialog: silence.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: (suddenly shouting)
dialog: I ride the BIG ONES! The really
dialog: BIG fuckers!
text: GONZO shows his teeth to LACERDA. DUKE laughs trying to
text: defuse the scene.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: The Vincent Black Shadow. We're
dialog: with the Factory Team.
speaker_heading: TV CAMERAMAN
dialog: Bullshit.
text: GONZO stills -- becomes dangerous -- zeros in on the TV
dialog: CAMERAMAN -- groin to groin...
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Wait a minute, pardon me lady, but
dialog: I think there's some kind of
dialog: ignorant chicken-sucker in this car
dialog: who needs his face cut open. You
dialog: cheap honky faggots! Which one of
dialog: you wants to get cut?!
scene_heading: DEAD SILENCE.
text: Ding! The elevator door opens, but nobody moves. The door

text: Next floor. Ding! The door opens again. A middle-aged

scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
text: DUKE and GONZO run down the corridor. GONZO LAUGHS WILDLY.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Spooked! They were spooked! Like

scene_heading: INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DAY
text: DUKE and GONZO CRASH into their hotel suite -- BOLT THE DOOR.

speaker_heading: GONZO

speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: (squinting suspiciously)
dialog: Have you made a deal with him? Did
dialog: you put him on to her?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (backing slowly
dialog: towards the door)
dialog: Look you better put that blade away
dialog: and get your head straight. I have
text: to put the car in the lot.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: One of the things you learn, after
dialog: years of dealing with drug people,
dialog: is that you can turn your back on a
dialog: person, but never turn your back on
dialog: a drug. Especially when it's
text: waving a razor-sharp hunting knife
dialog: in your eyes.
scene_heading: INT. CASINO/LOBBY MINT HOTEL
text: The MAGAZINE REPORTER is on the telephone.
speaker_heading: MAGAZINE REPORTER
text: Las Vegas at dawn. The racers are

dialog: the desert, fifty thousand dollars
text: in prize money, slumbers darkly in
dialog: the office safe at Del Webb's

text: DUKE walks past the REPORTER -- into THE CASINO, THE SAD,
text: MEAGRE CROWDS AROUND THE CRAP TABLES. No joy. DUKE watches.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: Who are these people? These faces!
dialog: Where do they come from? They look
text: like caricatures of used car
dialog: dealers from Dallas.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O; CONT'D)
dialog: And, sweet Jesus, there are a hell
dialog: of a lot of them at four-thirty on
text: a Monday morning. Still humping
dialog: the American dream, that vision of
dialog: the big winner somehow emerging
dialog: from the last minute predawn chaos
dialog: of a stale Vegas casino.
text: DUKE stops at the Money Wheel, puts down a two dollar bill

speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: You bastards!
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: No. Calm down. Learn to ENJOY

scene_heading: INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
text: DUKE walks back into the room. We hear the LOUD STRAINS OF
text: THREE DOG NIGHT'S "JOY TO THE WORLD."
text: He walks to the bathroom and opens the door.
scene_heading: INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Submerged in green water, GONZO WALLOWS in the steaming tub.
text: Soap labels and grapefruit rinds float on the surface. A
text: large empty pack of Neutrogena soap lies on the floor. The
text: shower is on -- the tub overflowing. THE TAPE RECORDER
text: PLAYS, from where it's plugged into the razor socket over
dialog: the sink.
text: DUKE turns off the shower -- notices a HUGE HUNK OF CHEWED
scene_heading: UP WHITE BLOTTER.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: You ate ALL THIS ACID?
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (turning down the volume)
dialog: You evil son of a bitch. You
dialog: better hope there's some Thorazine
dialog: in that bag, because if there's
dialog: not, you're in bad trouble.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Music! Turn it up. Put that tape
dialog: on.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: What tape?
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit."
dialog: I want a rising sound.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: You're doomed. I'm leaving here in
dialog: two hours and then they're going to
dialog: come up here and beat the mortal
dialog: shit out of you with big saps.
dialog: Right there in that tub.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: I dig my own graves. Green water
dialog: and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: OK. But do me one last favor, will
dialog: you. Can you give me two hours?
dialog: That's all I ask -- just two hours
dialog: to sleep before tomorrow. I
dialog: suspect it's going to be a very
dialog: difficult day.
text: He switches on the tape. "WHITE RABBIT" begins to build.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: (coolly)
dialog: Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll
dialog: give you all the time you need, at
dialog: my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but
dialog: you'll be wanting a cushion, so,
dialog: why don't you just lay one of those
dialog: $100 bills down there beside the
dialog: radio, and fuck off?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: How about a check?
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Whatever's right.
text: DUKE moves the radio as far from the tub as he can and
text: leaves, closing the door behind him.
scene_heading: INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
text: DUKE goes across to the sofa and crashes -- exhausted.
text: Suddenly a great ripping and crashing noise in the bathroom.
speaker_heading: GONZO (V/O)
dialog: Help! You bastard! I need help!
dialog: 46.
text: DUKE JUMPS up -- crosses to the bathroom door, muttering.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Shit, he's killing himself!
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: DUKE RUSHES IN. GONZO flails -- trying to reach the radio
text: with the shower curtain pole which he has ripped from its
dialog: mounts.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: (snarling)
dialog: I want that fucking radio!
text: DUKE GRABS THE RADIO.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Don't touch it! Get back in that
dialog: tub!
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Back the tape up. I need it again!
dialog: Let it roll! Just as high as the
dialog: fucker can go! And when it comes
dialog: to that fantastic note where the
dialog: rabbit bites its own head off, I
dialog: want you to THROW THAT FUCKING
text: RADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME!
text: DUKE stares down at GONZO.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Not me. It would blast you through
dialog: the wall -- stone dead in ten
dialog: seconds and they'd make me explain
dialog: it!
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
text: HIS ARM LASHES OUT OF THE WATER, HOLDING THE KNIFE.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
text: DUKE considers this. He's had enough.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Okay. You're right. This is
dialog: probably the only solution.
speaker_heading: (holds the PLUGGED IN
text: TAPE/RADIO over the tub)
dialog: Let me make sure I have it all
dialog: lined up. You want me to throw
dialog: this thing into the tub when "WHITE
dialog: RABBIT" peaks. Is that it?
text: GONZO falls back into the water, smiling gratefully.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Fuck yes. I was beginning to think
dialog: I was going to have to go out and
dialog: get one of the goddamn maids to do
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Are you ready?
text: He switches "WHITE RABBIT" back on. GONZO HOWLS AND MOANS
text: AND THRASHES TO THE MUSIC, straining to get over the top.
text: Meanwhile, DUKE picks up a grapefruit from the sink -- a
dialog: good two-pounder, he gets a grip on it... and when "WHITE
text: RABBIT" peaks... HE HURLS IT INTO THE TUB LIKE A CANNONBALL.
scene_heading: GONZO SCREAMS CRAZILY, THRASHING AND CHURNING -- CAUSING A
text: TIDAL WAVE.
text: DUKE JERKS THE RADIO CABLE OUT OF THE SOCKET -- SLAMS OUT OF
text: THE BATHROOM.
scene_heading: INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
text: DUKE slumps onto the sofa.
speaker_heading: SILENCE.
text: GONZO RIPS OPEN THE BATHROOM DOOR, his eyes unfocused. HE
text: WAVES THE RAZOR SHARP BLADE out in front of him -- LUNGES at
text: DUKE. DUKE WHIPS OUT A CAN OF MACE.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: MACE! YOU WANT THIS?
text: GONZO stops -- hisses.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: You bastard! You'd do that,
dialog: wouldn't you?
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing
dialog: in the world like a Mace high.
dialog: Forty-five minutes on your knees
dialog: with the dry heaves...
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: You cheap honky sonofabitch...
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Why not? Hell, just a minute ago,
dialog: you were asking me to kill you!
dialog: And now you want to kill me! What
dialog: I should do, goddamnit, is call the
dialog: police!
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: The cops?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: There's no choice. I wouldn't dare
dialog: go to sleep with you wandering
text: around with a head full of acid and
dialog: wanting to slice me up with that
dialog: goddamn knife!
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: (mumbles)
dialog: Who said anything about slicing you
dialog: up? I just wanted to carve a
dialog: little Z on your forehead. Nothing
dialog: serious.
text: GONZO shrugs and reaches for a cigarette on top of the TV set.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (menaces him with the MACE)
dialog: Get back in that tub. Eat some
text: reds and try to calm down. Smoke
dialog: some grass, shoot some smack --
dialog: shit, do whatever you have to do,
dialog: but let me get some rest.
text: GONZO turns toward the bathroom -- suddenly sad.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Hell, yes. You really need some
dialog: sleep. You have to work. Goddamn.
dialog: What a bummer. Try to rest. Don't
dialog: let me keep you up.
dialog: 49.
text: GONZO shuffles back into the bathroom. DUKE wedges a chair
text: up against the bathroom doorknob and puts the mace can next
text: to the clock.
text: DUKE turns on the TV. WHITE NOISE FILLS THE ROOM. He
text: collapses onto the sofa and lights up his lightbulb as pipe.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: Ignore the nightmare in the bathroom.
dialog: Just another ugly refugee from the
dialog: Love Generation.
text: The WHITE NOISE snow storm on the TV is reflected in his
text: face. The camera pulls back revealing THE ENTIRE WALL
text: BEHIND HIM TO BE SWIRLING WITH THE FIZZING SNOWSTORM PATTERN.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: My attorney had never been able to
dialog: accept the notion -- often espoused
dialog: by former drug abusers -- that you
dialog: can get a lot higher without drugs
dialog: than with them. And neither have
dialog: I, for that matter.
text: The pattern on the wall changes to A 60'S VISCOUS OIL
text: LIGHTSHOW PATTERN. With DUKE still sitting in the
text: foreground, the projected image widens to reveal the interior
text: of A HAIGHT ASHBURY DANCE HALL full of DANCING PROTO-HIPPIES.
scene_heading: INT. MATRIX CLUB - NIGHT
text: A slightly YOUNGER DUKE moves through the throng. All the
text: action is in a DREAMLIKE SLOW-MOTION.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: I recall one night in the Matrix.
dialog: There I was -- a victim of the Drug
dialog: Explosion. A natural street freak,
dialog: just eating whatever came by.
text: A ROAD-PERSON with a big pack on his back is shouting. The
text: sound of his voice, like his movements, is in slow-motion.
speaker_heading: ROAD-PERSON
dialog: Anybody want some L...S...D...? I
dialog: got all the makin's right here.
dialog: All I need is a place to cook.
text: The camera pushes right into the ROAD-PERSON's mouth.
scene_heading: INT. MATRIX MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Still in slow motion, the YOUNGER DUKE is trying to eat a
text: HUGE SPANSULE OF ACID. With difficulty.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: I decided to eat only half at first.
dialog: Good thinking. But I spilled the
dialog: rest on the sleeve of my red
dialog: Pendleton shirt.
text: DUKE stares at his sleeve, uncertain what to do. C/U of the
text: door to the men's room as a MUSICIAN enters speaking in
text: slow-motion.
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN
dialog: What's the trouble?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (also in slow-motion)
dialog: Well, all this white stuff on my
dialog: sleeve is LSD.
text: The MUSICIAN approaches and looks down at DUKE'S arm. A
dialog: long pause.
text: Cut back to tight shot of door as it opens and a very clean-
text: cut, PREPPY, STOCKBROKER TYPE enters. He freezes in horror.
text: We cut to his POV. DUKE is standing in the middle of the
text: men's room with the MUSICIAN hunkered down at his side...
text: sucking on his sleeve. A very gross tableau. The
text: STOCKBROKER slowly eases out of the room.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: With a bit of luck his life was
dialog: ruined -- forever thinking that
text: just behind some narrow door in all
dialog: his favorite bars, men in red
dialog: Pendleton shirts are getting
dialog: incredible kicks from things he'll
dialog: never know.
scene_heading: INT. A BAR - YEARS LATER - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: Strange memories on this nervous
dialog: night in Las Vegas.
text: (he gets up, pours
dialog: himself a drink)
dialog: Has it been five years? Six? It
dialog: seems like a lifetime -- the kind
dialog: of peak that never comes again.
dialog: San Francisco in the middle sixties
dialog: was a very special time and place
dialog: to be a part of. But no
dialog: explanation, no mix of words or
dialog: music or memories can touch that
dialog: sense of knowing that you were
dialog: there and alive in that corner of

speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)

scene_heading: MEAN OR MILITARY SENSE; WE DIDN'T
scene_heading: NEED THAT. OUR ENERGY WOULD SIMPLY
dialog: prevail. We had all the momentum;
dialog: we were riding the crest of a high
dialog: and beautiful wave...
text: DUKE'S FACE IS SUFFUSED WITH A SADNESS AND SERENITY WE HAVE
scene_heading: NEVER SEEN BEFORE.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: So now, less than five years later,
dialog: you can go up on a steep hill in
dialog: Las Vegas and look west, and with
dialog: the right kind of eyes you can
dialog: almost see the high water mark --
dialog: that place where the wave finally
text: broke and rolled back.
dialog: 52.
text: The memories dissolve into the night skyline of Vegas.
text: Suddenly towering over the casinos is a 200 foot high Nazi
text: shouting "WOODSTOCK ÜBER ALLES!"
scene_heading: INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
text: DUKE closes the curtain. The room is in darkness again.
scene_heading: INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DAWN
text: A harsh door buzzer. DUKE jerks awake. Alone. Looking
text: like shit. Around him is the wreckage of their stay.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: The decision to flee came suddenly.
dialog: Or maybe not.
text: DUKE opens the door to a BELL BOY with a trolley load of
text: fruit, drinks and flowers... and a smile.
speaker_heading: BELL BOY
dialog: Room service!
text: The BELL BOY wheels the trolley across the room -- already
text: stacked with EVEN MORE BOXES OF GOODIES.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: Maybe I'd planned it all along --
text: subconsciously waiting for the
dialog: right moment. The bill was a
dialog: factor, I think. Because I had no
dialog: money to pay for it.
text: DUKE slams the door -- starts FRANTICALLY PACKING.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: Our room service tabs had been
dialog: running somewhere between $29 and
dialog: $36 per hour, for forty-eight
text: consecutive hours. Incredible.
dialog: How could it happen?
text: DUKE sees the DISCARDED WRAPPINGS OF EXPENSIVE, HAND TOOLED
text: LUGGAGE. A sudden thought. He rushes to GONZO's room --
text: empty. His plastic briefcase remains on the bed...
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: But by the time I asked this
dialog: question, there was no one around
dialog: to answer.
text: DUKE opens the briefcase -- finds the .357 MAGNUM inside.
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: My attorney was gone. He must have
dialog: sensed trouble.
speaker_heading: QUICK CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DAY
text: GONZO WAVES GOODBYE as he boards an airplane with a set of
text: brand-new fine cowhide luggage.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: Panic.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE HOTEL SUITE - DAY
text: DUKE emerges with his bag and Gonzo's plastic briefcase --
text: leaves the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door -- checks both
text: ways, then hurries away down the corridor.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: It crept up my spine like first
text: rising vibes of an acid frenzy.
dialog: All these horrible realities began
dialog: to dawn on me.
scene_heading: INT. MINT HOTEL ELEVATOR - DAY
text: An anxiety ridden DUKE watches the floor numbers as the
text: elevator descends. He searches his pockets...
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: Here I was, alone in Las Vegas,
dialog: with this goddamned incredibly
dialog: expensive car, completely twisted
dialog: on drugs, no cash, no story for the
dialog: magazine. And on top of everything
dialog: else I had a gigantic goddamn hotel
dialog: bill to deal with.
text: DUKE finds a last crumpled $5 bill.
text: The door opens. A SECURITY GUARD enters with an OLD LADY IN
speaker_heading: HANDCUFFS.
text: DUKE hides the bill -- crams back into the corner. Doors
dialog: close.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: I didn't even know who had won the
dialog: race. Maybe nobody.
dialog: 54.
scene_heading: INT. MINT HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
text: DUKE hurries out of the elevator -- eyes on a hovering
text: MANAGER. Past the curious look of the reception CLERK.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (muttering to himself)
dialog: How would Horatio Alger have
dialog: handled this situation?
scene_heading: EXT. MINT HOTEL - DAY
text: Motoring, DUKE gives his $5 bill to the HOTEL FRONT DOORMAN
text: with a smile. The DOORMAN blows a frantic whistle and waves
speaker_heading: at the CAR BOY.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: Stay calm. Stay calm. I'm a
dialog: relatively respectable citizen -- a
dialog: multiple felon, perhaps, but
dialog: certainly not dangerous.
text: The CAR BOY pulls up with a screech. DUKE jumps in. The
text: back seat is stacked with bars of Neutrogena, piles of Mint
text: 400 t-shirts, boxes of grapefruit.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
dialog: Luckily, I had taken the soap and
text: grapefruit and other luggage out to
dialog: the car a few hours earlier. Now
dialog: it was only a matter of slipping
dialog: the noose...
text: DUKE shifts into drive. Deliverance!
speaker_heading: CLERK'S VOICE
speaker_heading: MR. DUKE!
text: DUKE freezes.
speaker_heading: CLERK'S VOICE
dialog: Mr. Duke! We've been looking for
dialog: you!
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: The game was up! They had me.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Well, why not? Many fine books
dialog: have been written in prison.
dialog: 55.
text: Resigned, DUKE turns off the ignition. A young CLERK
text: arrives breathlessly with a smile and a YELLOW LETTER IN HIS
speaker_heading: HAND.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Sir?
text: (thrusts out a TELEGRAM)
dialog: This telegram came for you.
dialog: Actually, it isn't for you. It's
dialog: for somebody named Thompson, but it
dialog: says 'care of Raoul Duke'. does
dialog: that make sense?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (barely able to speak)
dialog: Yes... It makes sense.
text: DUKE stuffs the telegram into his top pocket.
text: The CLERK peers into the car -- sees part of the enormous
text: stash inside.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: I checked the register for this man
dialog: Thompson. We don't show him but I
dialog: figured he might be part of your
dialog: team.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: He is. Don't worry, I'll get it to
dialog: him.
text: He fires up the engine -- eases the RED SHARK into low gear.
text: SECURITY GUARDS are looking across -- sharing a quiet word
dialog: or two.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's
dialog: signature on the telegram from Los
dialog: Angeles. When we knew he was right
dialog: here in the hotel.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: You did the right thing. Never try
dialog: to understand a press message.
dialog: About half the time we use codes --
dialog: especially with Dr. Gonzo.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Tell me. When will the doctor be
dialog: awake?
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (tenses)
dialog: Awake? What do you mean?
text: DUKE's eyes are on the SECURITY GUARDS -- moving closer.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (uncomfortably)
dialog: Well... the manager, Mr. Heem,
dialog: would like to meet him. Nothing
dialog: unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet
dialog: all our large accounts... put them
dialog: on a personal basis... just a chat
dialog: and a handshake, you understand.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Of course. But if I were you, I'd
dialog: leave the Doctor alone until after
dialog: he's eaten breakfast. He's a very
dialog: crude man.
text: DUKE edges the car forward, but is stopped by the CLERK.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: But he will be available? Perhaps
dialog: later this morning?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Look. That telegram was all
dialog: scrambled. It was actually from
dialog: Thompson, not to him. Western
dialog: Union must have gotten the names
dialog: reversed. I have to get going. I
dialog: have to get out to the track.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: There's no hurry! The race is over!
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (taking off)
dialog: Not for me.
text: He waves the CLERK off the car -- roars away.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Let's have lunch!
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Righto!
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD OUT OF VEGAS - DAY
text: DUKE drives the RED SHARK out of Vegas.
dialog: 57.
text: A "YOU ARE LEAVING LAS VEGAS" sign flashes past.
dialog: Bob Dylan plays: "Memphis Blues Again -- "Aaww, Mama, can
dialog: this really by the end...?"
text: A sign: LOS ANGELES -- 400 miles.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: Jesus, bad waves of paranoia,
dialog: madness, fear and loathing --
dialog: intolerable vibrations in this
dialog: place. Get out! The weasels were
dialog: closing in. I could smell the ugly
dialog: brutes. Flee!
text: DUKE drives fast.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Do me one last favor Lord: just
dialog: give me five more high-speed hours
dialog: before you bring the hammer down;
dialog: just let me get rid of this goddamn
dialog: car and off of this horrible desert.
text: A sign flashes "YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE."
text: A patrol car pulls out behind him, lights flashing.
speaker_heading: DUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: You evil bastard! This is your
dialog: work! You'd better take care of
dialog: me, Lord... because if you don't
dialog: you're going to have me on your
dialog: hands.
text: The patrol car screams after the RED SHARK.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: Few people understand the psychology
dialog: of dealing with a Highway Traffic
dialog: Cop. Your normal speeder will
text: panic and immediately pull over to
dialog: the side. This is wrong.
text: DUKE floors the gas pedal.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
text: It arouses contempt in the cop heart.
scene_heading: THE SPEEDOMETER CLIMBS STEADILY.
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: Make the bastard chase you. He
dialog: will follow. But he won't know
dialog: what to make of your blinker signal
dialog: that says you're about to turn right.
text: DUKE signals right. The RED SHARK screams at 120 mph.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: This is to let him know you're
dialog: looking for a proper place to pull
dialog: off and talk.
scene_heading: AN EXIT OFF RAMP: MAX SPEED 25.
text: DUKE hits the brakes. The COP brakes.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: It will take him a moment to
text: realize that he is about to make
dialog: 180 degree turn at speed... but you
dialog: will be ready for it, braced for
text: the G's and the fast heel toe work.
text: The patrol car spins and fishtails crazily out of control.
scene_heading: EXT. SCENIC PICNIC AREA - DAY
text: The patrol car comes skidding around the corner. DUKE
text: stands beside the RED SHARK, completely relaxed and smiling.
text: The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN gets out of the car, screaming.
scene_heading: HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
dialog: Just what the FUCK did you think
dialog: you were doing?!
text: DUKE smiles.
scene_heading: HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
dialog: May I see your license.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Of course, officer.
text: DUKE reaches for it. And BOTH MEN look down at a beer
text: can -- which DUKE had, somehow, forgotten was in his hand.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: I knew I was fucked.
text: The COP relaxes -- actually smiles... He reaches out for
text: DUKE's wallet, then holds out his other hand for the beer.
dialog: 59.
scene_heading: HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
dialog: Could I have that, please?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
text: The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN takes it, pours out the beer --
text: glances in the back seat of the RED SHARK. Amongst the bars
text: of soap... A case of warm beer. DUKE smiles back at him.
scene_heading: HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
dialog: You realize...
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I
dialog: understand that. I knew it was a
dialog: crime but I did it anyway. Shit,
dialog: why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
scene_heading: HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
dialog: That's a strange attitude.
text: He looks at DUKE thoughtfully.
scene_heading: HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
dialog: You know -- I get the feeling you
dialog: could use a nap. There's a rest
dialog: area up ahead. Why don't you pull
dialog: over and sleep a few hours?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: A nap won't help. I've been awake
dialog: for too long -- three or four
dialog: nights. I can't even remember. If
dialog: I go to sleep now, I'm dead for
dialog: twenty hours.
text: The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN smiles.
scene_heading: HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
dialog: Okay. Here's how it is. What goes
dialog: into my book, as of noon, is that I
dialog: apprehended you... for driving too
dialog: fast, and advised you to proceed no
dialog: further than the next rest area...
dialog: your stated destination, right?
dialog: Where you plan to take a long nap.
dialog: Do I make myself clear?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: How far is Baker? I was hoping to
dialog: stop there for lunch.
dialog: 60.
scene_heading: HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
dialog: Not my jurisdiction. The city
dialog: limits are two point two miles
dialog: beyond the rest area. Can you make
dialog: it that far?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: I'll try. I've been wanting to go
dialog: to Baker for a long time. I've
dialog: heard a lot about it.
text: The PATROLMAN holds the door for DUKE who gets in.
scene_heading: HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
dialog: Excellent seafood. With a mind
dialog: like yours, you'll probably want to
dialog: try the land-crab. Try the Majestic
dialog: Diner.
text: The PATROLMAN slams the door shut.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY
text: DUKE drives away -- teeth gritted.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: I felt raped. The Pig had done me
dialog: on all fronts, and now he was going
dialog: off to chuckle about it -- on the
dialog: west side of town, waiting for me
dialog: to make a run for L.A.
text: DUKE drives past the rest area to an intersection where he
text: signals to turn right into Baker. As he approaches the turn
text: he sees the HITCHHIKER! As DUKE slows to make the turn
text: their eyes meet. DUKE is about to wave -- but the HITCHHIKER
text: drops his thumb.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Great Jesus, it's him.
text: DUKE, spooked, SPINS THE RED SHARK round -- ROARS BACK THE
dialog: WAY HE CAME.
scene_heading: EXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY
text: DUKE on the public phone booth -- screaming.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: They've nailed me! I'm trapped in
text: some stinking desert crossroads

text: time. The fuckers are closing in.
dialog: They'll hunt me down like a beast!
dialog: 61.
scene_heading: INT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY

speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Who? You sound a little paranoid.
scene_heading: EXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY
text: DUKE screams -- sweat pouring.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: You bastard! I need a lawyer
dialog: immediately!
scene_heading: INT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: What are you doing in Baker?
dialog: Didn't you get my telegram?
scene_heading: EXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in
dialog: trouble. You worthless bastard.
dialog: I'll cripple your ass for this!
dialog: All that shit in the car is yours!
dialog: You understand that? When I finish
dialog: testifying out here you'll be
dialog: disbarred!
scene_heading: INT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: You're supposed to be in Vegas. We
dialog: have a suite at the Flamingo. I
dialog: was just about to leave for the
dialog: airport.
scene_heading: INT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY
text: DUKE pulls out the telegram from his top pocket.
speaker_heading: GONZO'S VOICE
dialog: You brainless scumbag! You're
dialog: supposed to be covering the National
dialog: District Attorney's conference! I
dialog: made all the reservations... rented
dialog: a white Cadillac convertible... the
dialog: whole thing is arranged! What the
dialog: hell are you doing out there in the
dialog: middle of the fucking desert?
dialog: 62.
text: DUKE stares at the telegram.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Never mind. It's all a big joke.
dialog: I'm actually sitting beside the
dialog: pool at the Flamingo. I'm talking
text: from a portable phone. Some dwarf
dialog: brought it out from the casino. I
dialog: have total credit! Can you grasp
dialog: that?
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: Don't come anywhere near this place!
dialog: Foreigners aren't welcome here!

scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - DAY

speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: All energy flows according to the

text: C/U Barrel of the gun. It fires. An explosion of desert
dialog: dirt.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: What a fool I was to defy Him.
text: The IGUANA sits unfazed.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: Never cross the Great Magnet. I
dialog: understood this now...
dialog: (another blast from
dialog: the gun)
dialog: ... and with understanding came a
text: sense of almost terminal relief.
text: DUKE stands alone in the vast desert firing at nothing, the

scene_heading: EXT. ROAD INTO VEGAS - DAY
text: The RED SHARK driving back towards Las Vegas.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)

dialog: ...especially the Vegas Police.
speaker_heading: (tight C/U of DUKE)
dialog: Luckily, my credit card was still
dialog: technically valid.
dialog: PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
text: DUKE, now driving a white Cadillac Coupe de Ville -- THE
speaker_heading: WHITE WHALE.
text: DUKE pushes buttons -- lowers the top.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: This was a superior machine -- ten
dialog: grand worth of gimmicks and high
dialog: price special effects. The rear
text: windows leapt up with a touch like
text: frogs in a dynamited pond. The
text: dashboard was full of esoteric
dialog: lights and dials and meters that I

scene_heading: EXT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - AFTERNOON
scene_heading: A GIANT SIGN: THE FLAMINGO WELCOMES THE NATIONAL DA'S
scene_heading: CONFERENCE ON NARCOTICS &amp; DANGEROUS DRUGS.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: If the Pigs were gathering in
dialog: Vegas, I felt the Drug Culture
dialog: should be represented as well...
dialog: and there was a certain bent appeal
dialog: in the notion of running a savage
dialog: burn on one Las Vegas hotel and
text: then just wheeling across town and
dialog: checking into another.
text: The WHITE WHALE turns into a VIP parking slot, immediately
text: attended by impressed MINIONS.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: Me and a thousand ranking cops from
dialog: all over America. Why not? Move

scene_heading: INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL LOBBY - AFTERNOON

text: behind mirror shades. He heads for the check-in line.
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: My arrival was badly timed.
text: THE PLACE IS FULL OF COPS. 200 of them, on vacation, all
text: dressed in cut price Vegas casuals: plaid Bermuda shorts,
text: Arnie Palmer golf shirts, and rubberized beach sandals.
text: Ahead of DUKE -- A POLICE CHIEF argues with the DESK CLERK.
text: The POLICE CHIEF'S AGNEW STYLE WIFE stands to the side,
text: weeping. The POLICE CHIEF'S FRIENDS stand uneasily around.
speaker_heading: POLICE CHIEF
dialog: What do you mean I'm too late to
dialog: register? I'm a police chief.
dialog: From Michigan. Look, fella, I told
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: (waves a POSTCARD)
dialog: I have a postcard here that says I
dialog: have reservations in this hotel.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (prissily)
dialog: I'm sorry, sir. You're on the
dialog: "late list." Your reservations were
dialog: transferred to the... ah...
text: Moonlight Motel, which is out on
dialog: Paradise Boulevard...
speaker_heading: POLICE CHIEF
dialog: I've already paid for my goddamn
dialog: room!
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: It's actually a very fine place of
dialog: lodging and only sixteen blocks
dialog: from here, with its own pool and...
speaker_heading: POLICE CHIEF
dialog: You dirty little faggot! Call the
dialog: manager! I'm tired of listening to
dialog: this dogshit!
text: FRIENDS restrain the POLICE CHIEF.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (solicitously)
dialog: I'm so sorry, sir. May I call you
dialog: a cab?
text: The POLICE CHIEF's screamed insults fade away...
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: Of course, I could hear what the
dialog: Clerk was really saying...
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: CLERK
scene_heading: (IN DUKE'S IMAGINATION)
dialog: Listen, you fuzzy little shithead --
dialog: I've been fucked around, in my
dialog: time, by a fairly good cross-
dialog: section of mean-tempered rule-crazy
dialog: cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck
dialog: you, officer, I'm in charge here,
dialog: and I'm telling you we don't have
dialog: room for you."
text: DUKE steps to the desk, around the raging POLICE CHIEF.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Say. I hate to interrupt, but I
dialog: wonder if maybe I could just sort
dialog: of slide through and get out of
dialog: your way. Name's Raoul Duke --
dialog: Raoul Duke. My attorney made the
dialog: reservation.
text: DUKE snaps a credit card down onto the counter. EVERYONE
text: goes silent. The POLICE CHIEF GROUP stares at him like he
text: was some kid of water rat crawling up to the desk. The
text: CLERK hits the bell for the BELLBOY.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Certainly, Mr. Duke!
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: My bags are out there in that white
dialog: Cadillac convertible. Can you have
dialog: someone drive it around to the room?
text: ALL EYES turn to the gleaming WHITE WHALE.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild
dialog: Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and
dialog: a night's worth of ice delivered to
dialog: my room, please?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Don't worry about a thing, sir.
dialog: Just enjoy your stay.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Well, thank you.

scene_heading: INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - AFTERNOON

text: A 16-year-old GIRL with the aura of an angry Pit Bull.
text: GONZO stands in the bathroom doorway -- stark naked with a

speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: You degenerate pig!
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: It can't be helped. This is Lucy.
dialog: (laughing distractedly)
dialog: You know--like "Lucy In The Sky

text: LUCY eyes DUKE venomously.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Lucy! Lucy, be cool, goddamnit!
dialog: Remember what happened at the
dialog: airport! No more of that, okay?
text: LUCY keeps her eyes on DUKE. GONZO idles over and puts his
text: arm round her shoulder.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Lucy... this is my client. This is
dialog: Mr. Duke, the famous journalist.
dialog: He's paying for this suite, Lucy.
dialog: He's on our side.
text: DUKE flops onto the sofa.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Mr. Duke is my friend. He loves
dialog: artists.
text: DUKE notices for the first time that the room is full of
text: artwork. Maybe 40 or 50 portraits, some in oil, some in
text: charcoal, all more or less the same size and same face.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Lucy paints portraits of Barbra
dialog: Streisand.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I drew these from TV.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Fantastic. She came all the way
dialog: down here from Montana just to give
dialog: these portraits to Barbra. We're
dialog: going over to the Americana Hotel
dialog: tonight to meet her backstage...
text: DUKE's voice rises above GONZO.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: I desperately needed peace, rest,
dialog: sanctuary. I hadn't counted on
dialog: this. Finding my attorney on acid
dialog: and locked into some kind of
text: preternatural courtship.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Well, I guess they brought the car
dialog: round by now. LET'S GET THE STUFF
text: OUT OF THE TRUNK.
text: DUKE fixes GONZO hard.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Absolutely, LET'S GET THE STUFF.
dialog: (to LUCY)
dialog: Now, we'll be right back. Don't

speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: WELL? What are your plans?
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Plans?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Lucy.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: (struggling to focus)
dialog: Shit. I met her on the plane and I
dialog: had all that acid.
dialog: (he shrugs)
dialog: You know, those little blue barrels.
dialog: I gave her a cap before I realized...
dialog: she's a religious freak... Jesus,
dialog: she's never even had a drink.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Well... It'll probably work out.
dialog: We can keep her loaded and peddle

text: GONZO stares uneasily at DUKE.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Listen, she's running away from
dialog: home for something like the fifth
dialog: time in six months. It's terrible.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: She's perfect for this gig. These
dialog: cops will go fifty bucks a head to
dialog: beat her into submission and then
dialog: gang fuck her. We can set her up
dialog: in one of these back street motels,
dialog: hang pictures of Jesus all over the
dialog: room, then turn these pigs loose on
dialog: her... Hell she's strong; she'll
dialog: hold her own.
text: GONZO's face twitches badly.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Jesus Christ. I knew you were sick
dialog: but I never expected to hear you

speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: It's straight economics. This girl
dialog: is a god-send. Shit, she can make
dialog: us a grand a day.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: NO! Stop talking like that.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: I figure she can do about four at a
dialog: time. Christ, if we keep her full
dialog: of acid that's more like two grand
text: a day. Maybe three.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: You filthy bastard. I should cave
dialog: your fucking head in.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: In a few hours, she'll probably be
dialog: sane enough to work herself into a
dialog: towering Jesus-based rage at the
text: hazy recollection of being seduced
dialog: by some kind of cruel Samoan who
dialog: fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her
text: to a Vegas hotel room and savagely
dialog: penetrated every orifice in her
text: body with his throbbing,
text: uncircumcised member.
text: GONZO starts crying.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I
dialog: wanted to help her!
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: You'll go straight to the gas
dialog: chamber. And even if you manage to
dialog: beat that, they'll send you back to
dialog: Nevada for Rape and Consensual
dialog: Sodomy. She's got to go.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Shit, it doesn't pay to try to help
dialog: somebody these days.
dialog: A silence.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: The only alternative was to take
dialog: her out to the desert and feed her
dialog: remains to the lizards. But, it
dialog: seemed a bit heavy for the thing we
dialog: were trying to protect: My attorney.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: We have to cut her loose. She's
dialog: got two hundred dollars. And we
dialog: can always call the cops up there
dialog: in Montana, where she lives, and
dialog: turn her in.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: What?... What kind of goddamn
dialog: monster are you?
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: It just occurred to me, that she
dialog: has no witnesses. Anything that
dialog: she says about us is completely
dialog: worthless.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Us?
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - SUNSET
text: DUKE is speaking into the phone in hushed tones.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Hotel Americana? I need a
dialog: reservation. For my niece. Listen,
dialog: I need her treated very gently.
dialog: She's an artist, and might seem a
dialog: trifle highstrung...
text: In the background GONZO helps LUCY and her paintings out the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet
dialog: Barbra...
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: I felt like a Nazi, but it had to
dialog: be done.
scene_heading: EXT. ON THE STREETS - A CAB STAND - DUSK
text: The WHITE WHALE pulls up -- DUKE at the wheel. GONZO helps
text: LUCY and her paintings from the car.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: Lucy was a potentially fatal
dialog: millstone on both our necks. There
dialog: was absolutely no choice but to cut
dialog: her adrift and hope her memory was
dialog: fucked.
text: GONZO unrolls a couple of bills -- pays off a CAB DRIVER --
text: waves to LUCY in the back with her paintings. She's starting
dialog: to come down...
text: GONZO gets back in the WHITE WHALE and slaps his hands
text: together as if washing his hands of the situation.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Well that's that. Take off slowly.
dialog: Don't attract attention.
dialog: 71.
text: They pull out into traffic.
scene_heading: EXT. LAS VEGAS STREETS - DUSK
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: I gave the cabbie an extra ten
dialog: bucks to make sure she gets there
dialog: safe. Also, I told him I'd be
dialog: there myself in an hour, and if she
dialog: wasn't, I'd come back out here and
text: rip his lungs out.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: That's good. You can't be subtle
dialog: in this town.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: As your attorney, I advise you to
dialog: tell me where you put the goddamn
dialog: mescaline.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Right. Let's find a good seafood
text: restaurant and eat some red salmon.
dialog: I feel a powerful lust for red
dialog: salmon...
text: The electric WHITE WHALE heads off down the Strip. The

text: tune croaks on the radio in the warm dusk.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - BATHROOM - NEXT MORNING
text: GONZO throws up in the toilet bowl.
text: In the background, DUKE opens curtains. Daylight blinds him.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Come on, we're going to be late.
text: GONZO looks up at his sick reflection -- wipes his mouth
text: with a towel.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: This goddamn mescaline. Why the
dialog: fuck can't they make it a little
dialog: less pure? Maybe mix it up with
dialog: Rolaids or something.
dialog: 72.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
dialog: (crackling and
text: booming over the
dialog: lousy sound system)
dialog: On behalf of the prosecuting
dialog: attorneys of this county, I welcome
dialog: you to the Third National DA's
dialog: Conference on Narcotics and
dialog: Dangerous Drugs.
text: The EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR -- well groomed, GOP businessman
text: type -- speaks from the podium. A banner behind him reads:
scene_heading: NATIONAL DA'S CONVENTION 1971. "If You Don't Know, Come To
dialog: Learn... If You Know, Come To Teach."
scene_heading: A BIG MIXED CROWD: TOP LEVEL STRAIGHT COPS, UNDERCOVER NARCS
text: AND OTHER TWILIGHT TYPES -- beards, mustaches and super-Mod
dialog: dress. Just because you're a cop, doesn't mean you can't be
dialog: WITH IT! However, for every URBAN-HIPSTER there are around
text: 20 REDNECKS.
text: A dozen big, low-fidelity speakers mounted on steel poles
text: distort and feed back the EXECUTIVE's voice through the room.
text: At the back, under a loudspeaker, sits DUKE -- $40 FBI
text: wingtips, a Pat Boone madras sportcoat, and an official name
scene_heading: tag: RAOUL DUKE, PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR, L.A.
text: GONZO sits beside him. His name tag: DR. GONZO. EXPERT,
text: CRIMINAL DRUG ANALYSIS. He's nervous -- close to the edge.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: (lowers his voice)
dialog: I saw these bastards in Easy Rider,
dialog: but I didn't believe they were real.
dialog: Not like this. Not hundreds of them!
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: They're actually nice people when
dialog: you get to know them.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Man, I know these people in my
dialog: goddamn blood!
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Don't mention that word around here.
dialog: You'll get them excited.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: This is a fucking nightmare.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Right. Sure as hell some dope-
dialog: dealing bomb freak is going to
dialog: recognize you and put the word out
dialog: that you're partying with a thousand
dialog: cops.
speaker_heading: COP IN BACK
speaker_heading: SSSSHHH!
text: DR. BLUMQUIST -- a "drug expert" -- takes the stage.
speaker_heading: DR. BLUMQUIST
dialog: We must come to terms with the Drug
dialog: Culture in the country... country...
dialog: country...
text: The sound systems echoes.
speaker_heading: DR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D)
dialog: The reefer butt is called a "roach,"
dialog: because it resembles a cockroach...
dialog: cockroach... cockroach...
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: What the fuck are these people
dialog: talking about? You'd have to be
dialog: crazy on acid to think a joint
dialog: looked like a goddamn cockroach!
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: It was clear that we had stumbled
text: into a prehistoric gathering.
speaker_heading: DR. BLUMQUIST
dialog: Now, there are four states of being
dialog: in the cannabis, or marijuana,
dialog: society: Cool, Groovy, Hip, and
dialog: Square. The square is seldom if
dialog: ever cool. He is not "with it,"
dialog: that is, he doesn't know "what's
dialog: happening." But if he manages to
dialog: figure it out, he moves up a notch
dialog: to "hip."
text: DUKE and GONZO listen in disbelief.
speaker_heading: DR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D)
dialog: And if he can bring himself to
dialog: approve of what is happening, he
text: becomes "groovy." After that, with
dialog: much luck and perseverance, he can
dialog: rise to the rank of "cool." A cool
dialog: guy... cool guy... cool guy...
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: COP IN BACK
dialog: Dr. Bloomquist, do you think the
dialog: anthropologist, Margaret Mead's
dialog: strange behavior of late might
dialog: possibly be explained by a private
dialog: marijuana addiction?
speaker_heading: DR. BLUMQUIST
dialog: I really don't know, but at her
dialog: age, if she did smoke grass, she'd
dialog: have one hell of a trip!
text: Roars of laughter.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: I know a hell of a lot better ways
dialog: to waste my time than listening to
dialog: this bullshit.
text: He stands, knocking the ashtray off his chair arm, and
text: plunges down the aisle to the door.
speaker_heading: COP IN BACK
dialog: Down in front!
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Fuck you! I have to get out! I
dialog: don't belong here!
speaker_heading: COP IN BACK
dialog: Good riddance!
text: He stumbles from the room. DUKE turns his attention back to
dialog: the stage.
text: The lights go down. A black &amp; white film -- REEFER
text: MADNESS! -- illustrates his now evangelical talk.
speaker_heading: FILM NARRATOR
dialog: KNOW YOUR DOPE FIEND! YOUR LIFE
dialog: MAY DEPEND ON IT! You will not be
dialog: able to see his eyes because of
dialog: Tea-Shades, but his knuckles will
dialog: be white from inner tension...
text: DUKE turns his attention to a 340 pound TEXAN POLICE CHIEF
text: who necks with his 290 pound WIFE beside him.
speaker_heading: FILM NARRATOR
dialog: ... and his pants will be crusted
text: with semen from constantly jacking
dialog: off when he can't find a rape
dialog: victim...
dialog: 75.
text: DUKE gazes at the TEXAN and his WIFE. -- Feigning sickness,
text: he gets up, hand over mouth.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Pardon me, I feel sick.
speaker_heading: FILM NARRATOR
text: He will stagger and babble when
dialog: questioned. He will not respect
dialog: your badge. The Dope Fiend fears
dialog: nothing. He will attack, for no
dialog: reason, with every weapon at his
dialog: command -- including yours...
text: DUKE heads for the exit.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Sorry, sick... Beg pardon! Feeling
dialog: sick...
speaker_heading: FILM NARRATOR
dialog: BEWARE. Any officer apprehending a
dialog: suspected marijuana addict should
dialog: use all necessary force immediately.
dialog: One stitch in time [on him] will
dialog: usually save nine on you.
text: DUKE CRASHES OUT THROUGH THE DOOR.
scene_heading: INT. CASINO BAR - DAY
text: DUKE sees GONZO at the bar -- talking to a SPORTY LOOKING

scene_heading: ATTORNEY FROM GEORGIA.
speaker_heading: DA
dialog: I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't
dialog: have much trouble from drugs where
dialog: I come from...
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: You will. One of these nights
dialog: you'll wake up and find a junkie
dialog: tearing your bedroom apart.
speaker_heading: DA
dialog: Naw!
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: They'll climb right into your
dialog: bedroom and sit on your chest with
dialog: big Bowie knives. They might even
dialog: sit on your wife's chest. Put the
text: blade right down on her throat.
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: DA
dialog: Not down in my parts.
text: DUKE joins them.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (to WAITRESS)
dialog: Rum and ice, please.
speaker_heading: DA
text: (looks at DUKE'S NAME TAG)
dialog: You're another one of these
dialog: California boys. Your friend
dialog: here's been tellin' us about dope
dialog: fiends.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: They're everywhere. Nobody's safe.
dialog: And sure as hell not in the South.
dialog: They like warm weather... You'd
dialog: never believe it. In L.A. it's out
dialog: of control. First it was drugs,
dialog: now it's witchcraft.
speaker_heading: DA
dialog: Witchcraft? Shit, you can't mean it!
text: The BARTENDER cleans his glasses, one ear straining for the
dialog: conversation.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Read the newspapers.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Man, you don't know trouble until
dialog: you have to face down a bunch of
dialog: these addicts gone crazy for human
dialog: sacrifice!
speaker_heading: DA
dialog: Naw! That's science fiction stuff!
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Not where we operate.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Hell, in Malibu alone, these
dialog: goddamn Satan worshippers kill six
dialog: or eight people every day. All
dialog: they want is the blood. They'll
dialog: take people right off the street if
dialog: they have to.
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Just the other day we had a case
dialog: where they grabbed a girl right out
text: of a McDonald's hamburger stand.
dialog: She was a waitress, about sixteen
dialog: years old... with a lot of people
dialog: watching, too!
text: The BARTENDER keeps cleaning the same glass -- more and more
dialog: furiously.
speaker_heading: DA
dialog: What happened? What did they do to
dialog: her?
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Do? Jesus Christ, man. They
dialog: chopped her goddamn head off right
dialog: there in the parking lot! Then
dialog: they cut all kinds of holes in her
dialog: head and sucked out the blood!
speaker_heading: DA
dialog: (DA ad-libs a
dialog: summation of the crime)
dialog: And nobody did anything?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: What could they do? The guy that
dialog: took the head was about six-seven,
dialog: and maybe three-hundred pounds. He
dialog: was packing two Lugers, and the
dialog: others had M-16s.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: They just ran back out into Death
dialog: Valley -- you know, where Manson
dialog: turned up...
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Like big lizards.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: ... and every one of them stacked
dialog: naked...
speaker_heading: DA
dialog: Naked!?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Naked.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Yeh, naked!... except for the
dialog: weapons.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: They were all veterans.
speaker_heading: DA
dialog: Veterans?!!!?
text: Agog with the horrors of the story, the BARTENDER polishes
dialog: the glass -- faster and faster...
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Yeh. The big guy used to be a
dialog: major in the Marines.
speaker_heading: DA
dialog: A major!
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: We know where he lives, but we
dialog: can't get near the house.
speaker_heading: DA
dialog: Naw! Not a major.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: He wanted the pineal gland.
speaker_heading: DA
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: That's how he got so big. When he
dialog: quit the Marines he was just a
dialog: little guy.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Usually, it's whole families.
dialog: During the night. Most of them
dialog: don't even wake up until they feel
dialog: their heads going -- and then, of
dialog: course, it's too late.
text: The glass smashes in the BARTENDER's hand.
speaker_heading: DUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Happens every day.
text: DUKE turns to a WAITRESS with a warm smile.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: DUKE (CONT'D)
text: Three more rums. Plenty of ice.
text: Maybe a handful of lime chunks.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Are you guys with the police
dialog: convention upstairs?
speaker_heading: DA
dialog: We sure are, Miss.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: I thought so. I never heard that
dialog: kind of talk around here before.
dialog: Jesus Christ! How do you guys
dialog: stand that kind of work?
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: We like it. It's groovy.
text: The WAITRESS stares -- sickened -- at GONZO.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: What's wrong with you? Hell,
dialog: somebody has to do it.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Hurry up with those drinks. We're
dialog: thirsty. Only two rums. Make mine
dialog: a Bloody Mary.
speaker_heading: DA
text: (whacks his fist on
dialog: the bar)
dialog: Hell, I really hate to hear this.
dialog: Because everything that happens in
dialog: California seems to get down our
dialog: way, sooner or later. Mostly
dialog: Atlanta. But that was back when
dialog: the goddamn bastards were peaceful.
dialog: All we had to do was to keep 'em
dialog: under surveillance. They didn't
dialog: roam around much... But now Jesus,
text: it seems nobody's safe.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: (with a conspiratorial
dialog: nod)
dialog: You're going to need to take the
dialog: bull by the horns -- go to the mat
dialog: with this scum.
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: DA
dialog: What do you mean by that?
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: You know what I mean. We've done
dialog: it before and we can damn well do
dialog: it again!
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Cut their goddamn heads off. Every
dialog: one of them. That's what we're
dialog: doing in California.
speaker_heading: DA
dialog: (stupefied)
speaker_heading: WHAT?
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Sure. It's all on the Q.T., but
dialog: everybody who matters is with us
text: all the way down the line.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: We keep it quiet. It's not the
dialog: kind of thing you'd want to talk
dialog: about upstairs. Not with the press
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: DA
dialog: (recovering slightly)
dialog: Hell, no. We'd never hear the
dialog: goddamn end of it.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Dobermans don't talk.
speaker_heading: DA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Sometimes it's easier to just rip
text: out the backstraps.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: They'll fight like hell if you try
dialog: to take the head without the dogs.
speaker_heading: DA
dialog: God almighty!
dialog: (muttering in a daze)
dialog: I don't think I should tell my wife
dialog: about this. She'd never understand.
dialog: You know how women are.
dialog: 81.
text: DUKE gives the DA a brotherly slap on the back.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Just be thankful your heart is
text: young and strong.
text: DUKE and GONZO leave the stunned DA -- staring into the
text: swirling ice in drink.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - DAY
text: DUKE and GONZO fall into the suite in fits of laughter.
text: GONZO feels the nausea rise suddenly -- heads for the
text: bathroom. Immediate sounds of retching.
text: The phone message light is blinking. DUKE opens a beer,
text: picks up the phone.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: What's the message? My light is
dialog: blinking.
speaker_heading: CLERK (V/O)
dialog: Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one
dialog: message: "Call Lucy at the Americana
dialog: Hotel, room 1600."
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Holy shit!
text: DUKE slams the phone down. GONZO emerges from the
text: bathroom -- looking like death.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Lucy called.
text: GONZO sags visibly -- like an animal taking a bullet.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: What?
text: The telephone rings. DUKE answers.
scene_heading: INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - RECEPTION - DAY
text: A worried CLERK speaks in to the phone.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm
dialog: sorry we were cut off a moment
dialog: ago... I thought I should call
dialog: again, because I was wondering...
dialog: 82.
scene_heading: INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - DAY
speaker_heading: DUKE
speaker_heading: WHAT?
speaker_heading: (hand over the PHONE)
dialog: What was that crazy bitch said to
dialog: him?
dialog: (screams)
dialog: There's a war on, man! People are
dialog: being killed!
speaker_heading: CLERK (V/O)
dialog: Killed?
speaker_heading: DUKE
text: IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN
speaker_heading: TELEVISION!
speaker_heading: CLERK (V/O)
dialog: Oh... yes... yes... This terrible
dialog: war. When will it end?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Tell me. What do you want?
text: In the background GONZO is upturning a sofa to retrieve his
text: stash from the lining.
speaker_heading: CLERK (V/O)
dialog: The woman who left that message for
dialog: you sounded very disturbed. I
dialog: think she was crying...
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Crying? Why was she crying?
speaker_heading: CLERK (V/O)
dialog: Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke.
dialog: But since I know you're here with
dialog: the Police Convention...
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Look, you want to be gentle with
dialog: that woman if she ever calls again.
dialog: We're watching her very carefully...
dialog: this woman has been into laudanum.
dialog: It's a controlled experiment, but I
dialog: suspect we'll need your cooperation
dialog: before this thing is over.
speaker_heading: CLERK (V/O)
dialog: (hesitantly)
dialog: Well, certainly... We're always
dialog: happy to cooperate with the police...
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Don't worry. You're protected.
dialog: Just treat this poor woman like
dialog: you'd treat any other human being
dialog: in trouble.
speaker_heading: CLERK (V/O)
dialog: What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what
dialog: you mean... Yes... so, you'll be
dialog: responsible then?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Of course. And now I have to get
dialog: back to the news. Send up some ice.
text: He hangs up. GONZO zaps TV channels -- commercials.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Good work. They'll treat us like
dialog: goddamn lepers after that.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (slowly, carefully)
dialog: Lucy is looking for you.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: No, she's looking for you.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Me?
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: She really flipped over you. The
dialog: only way I could get rid of her was
dialog: by saying you were taking me out to
dialog: the desert for a showdown -- that
dialog: you wanted me out of the way so you
dialog: could have her all to yourself.
dialog: (laughing again)
dialog: I guess she figures you won. That
dialog: phone message wasn't for me, was it?
text: A look of stunned realization from DUKE...
scene_heading: INT. FANTASY COURT ROOM - DAY
text: LUCY is on the witness stand.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Yessir, those two men in the dock

dialog: 84.
text: A doomed DUKE and GONZO await their fate.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I don't know for sure what they
dialog: done to me, but I remember it was

text: DUKE KEEPS PACKING. GONZO is looking worried.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call
dialog: her. I'll get her off our backs.
dialog: You're right. She's my problem.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: It's gone too far.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Relax. Let me handle this.
dialog: (dials the PHONE,
text: snaps angrily at DUKE)
dialog: You'd make a piss-poor lawyer.
dialog: ...Room 1600, please.
speaker_heading: (to DUKE)
dialog: As your attorney, I advise you not
dialog: to worry.
dialog: (nods towards bathroom)
dialog: Take a hit out of that little brown
dialog: bottle in my shaving kit.
text: DUKE goes in the bathroom. He finds a little bottle -- a
dialog: label: "DRINK ME."
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: What is this?
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: You won't need much. Just a little
dialog: tiny taste, that stuff makes pure

dialog: Adrenochrome.
text: DUKE stares wonderingly at the bottle.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Adrenochrome...
speaker_heading: GONZO
speaker_heading: (into PHONE)
dialog: Hi, Lucy? Yeah, it's me. I got
dialog: your message...what? Hell, no, I
dialog: taught the bastard a lesson he'll
dialog: never forget... what? No, not
dialog: dead, but he won't be bothering
dialog: anybody for a while. Yeah. I left
dialog: him out there, I stomped him, then
dialog: pulled all his teeth out...
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: I remember thinking, "Jesus, what a
dialog: terrible thing to lay on somebody
dialog: with a head full of acid."
text: DUKE dips a match head into the brown bottle -- studies
scene_heading: it -- TASTES IT -- NOTHING -- TASTES SOME MORE...
speaker_heading: GONZO
speaker_heading: (to PHONE)
dialog: But here's the problem. That
dialog: bastard cashed a bad check
dialog: downstairs and gave you as a
dialog: reference. They'll be looking for
dialog: both of you. Yeah, I know, but you
dialog: can't judge a book by its cover,
dialog: Lucy. Some people are just
dialog: basically rotten... Anyway, the
dialog: last thing you want to do is call
dialog: this hotel again; they'll trace the
dialog: call and put you straight behind
dialog: bars... no, I'm moving to the
dialog: Tropicana right away. I have to
dialog: go, they've got the phone tapped.
dialog: Yeah, I know, it was horrible, but
dialog: it's all over now... OH MY GOD!
dialog: THEY'RE KICKING THE DOOR DOWN!
speaker_heading: (throws the PHONE
dialog: down; shouts)
dialog: No! Get away from me! I'm innocent!

dialog: (slams the PHONE down)
text: GONZO sits back in his chair... watching MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Well. That's that. She's probably
dialog: stuffing herself down the

dialog: last we should be hearing from Lucy.
dialog: (fumbling with the
dialog: hash pipe)
dialog: Where's the opium?
text: DUKE stares at the back of GONZO's neck. SOMETHING VERY
text: STRANGE IS HAPPENING TO HIM...
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: I remember slumping on the bed, his
dialog: performance had given me a bad jolt.
dialog: For a moment I thought his mind had
dialog: snapped -- that he actually believed

speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Where'd you get this?
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Never mind, it's absolutely pure.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Jesus... what kind of monster
dialog: client have you picked up this time?
dialog: There's only one source for this
dialog: stuff -- the adrenaline gland from
dialog: a living human body!
text: GONZO turns to smile at DUKE.
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: I know, but the guy didn't have any
dialog: cash to pay me. He's one of these
dialog: Satanism freaks. He offered me
dialog: human blood -- said it would take
dialog: me higher than I've ever been in my
dialog: life.
dialog: (laughs -- struts
dialog: round DUKE -- eyes
dialog: bright with expectation)
dialog: I thought he was kidding, so I told
dialog: him I'd just as soon have an ounce
dialog: or so of pure adrenochrome -- or
dialog: maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland
dialog: to chew on.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: I could already feel the stuff
dialog: working on me -- the first wave
dialog: felt like a combination of mescaline
dialog: and methedrine -- maybe I should
dialog: take a swim, I thought...
text: DUKE sees that GONZO is TOYING WITH HIS HUNTING KNIFE...
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Yeah, they nailed this guy for
dialog: child molesting. He swore he
dialog: didn't do it. "Why should I fuck
dialog: with children?" he says. "They're
dialog: too small." Christ, werewolf is
dialog: entitled to legal counsel. I
dialog: didn't dare turn the creep down.
dialog: He might have picked up a letter
dialog: opener and gone after my pineal
dialog: gland!
text: GONZO JABS WITH THE RAZOR BRIGHT KNIFE. DUKE'S BODY IS
text: GOING RIGID -- HE SPEAKS THROUGH GRITTED TEETH.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Why not? We should get some of
dialog: that. Just eat a big handful and
dialog: see what happens.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Some of what?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (spitting words)
dialog: Extract of pineal!
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: GONZO
text: (STARING AT DUKE WITH
speaker_heading: A STRANGE SMILE)
dialog: Sure. That's a good idea. One
dialog: whiff of that shit would turn you
dialog: into something out of a goddamn
dialog: medical encyclopedia.
scene_heading: GONZO GROWS HORNS -- HIS FACE BECOMES A MEXICAN DEMON MASK.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Man, your head would swell up like
dialog: a watermelon, you'd probably gain
dialog: about a hundred pounds in two
dialog: hours...
text: A CLOVEN HOOF BURSTS THROUGH GONZO'S SHOE.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Right!
speaker_heading: GONZO
text: ... grow claws... bleeding warts.
text: GONZO'S CHEST EXPANDS -- BONY RIBS BURSTING HIS SHIRT.
speaker_heading: DUKE

speaker_heading: GONZO

dialog: back...
scene_heading: A TAIL LASHES, HOOFS STRIKE THE FLOOR. GONZO TOWERS -- A

speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Fantastic!
text: DUKE is now so wire that his hands are CLAWING UNCONTROLLABLY

text: EYEBALLS SWELLING.
scene_heading: GONZO-DEMON LOOMS AGAINST THE CEILING.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: you'd go blind... your body would

text: GONZO REVERTED TO NORMAL HUMAN SHAPE AND SIZE.
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Man I'll try about anything; but
dialog: I'd never touch a pineal gland.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What
dialog: happened?! What about the glands?
text: GONZO, a small smile on his lips, backs away warily...
text: towards the TV -- NOW A HUNDRED FEET AWAY IN THE DISTANCE...
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Jesus, that stuff got right on top
dialog: of you, didn't it.
text: VEINS stand out on DUKE's forehead. He is purplish-red.
text: OVER THE TOP! Too late, he realizes he is NEAR DEATH!
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Maybe you could just... shove me
dialog: into the pool, or something...
text: GONZO shakes his head disgustedly.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: If I put you in the pool right now,
dialog: you'd sink like a goddamn stone.
dialog: You took too much. Jesus, look at
dialog: your face, you're about to explode.
text: GONZO sits back down... watching the TV.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Don't try and fight it, or you'll
dialog: get brain bubbles. Strokes,

dialog: and die.
text: DUKE FALLS TO THE GROUND, WRITHING, CATATONIC, SINKING INTO
speaker_heading: PARALYSIS.

scene_heading: INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
dialog: Darkness. Insanely, somewhere NILSSON plays -- "Put the
dialog: lime in the coconut and mix em all up..."
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: What kind of rat-bastard psychotic
dialog: would play that song -- right now,
dialog: at this moment?
text: DUKE opens his eyes and the hotel suite rushes in. He lies,
text: awkwardly twisted -- unable to move. He could have been
dialog: there days -- months.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: When I came to the general back
dialog: alley ambiance of the suite was so
dialog: rotten, so incredibly foul. How
dialog: long had I been lying there? Hours?
dialog: Days? Months? All these signs of
dialog: violence. What had happened?
text: DUKE moves his eyes -- taking in his surroundings: Like THE
scene_heading: SIGHT OF SOME DISASTROUS ZOOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT involving
text: whisky and gorillas. Blue and red Christmas tree lights
text: replace lightbulbs, used towels hanging everywhere,
text: pornographic pictures ripped out of a magazine are plastered
text: on a shattered mirror.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: There was evidence in this room of
dialog: excessive consumption of almost
dialog: every type of drug known to
dialog: civilized man since 1544 AD.
text: DUKE manages to move -- stiffly gets to his bare feet --
text: HOBBLES ROUND THE TRASHED ROOM like a newly risen ape.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: But what kind of addict would need
dialog: all these coconut husks and crushed
dialog: honeydew rinds? Would the presence
dialog: of junkies account for all these
dialog: uneaten french fries? These
text: puddles of glazed ketchup on the
dialog: bureau? Maybe so, but then why all
dialog: this booze? And these crude
text: pornographic photos smeared with
dialog: mustard that had dried to a hard
dialog: yellow crust...
text: DUKE peers into Gonzo's room -- HIS BED LIKE A BURNED OUT
text: RAT'S NEST -- blackened springs and wires.
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: These were not the hoof prints of
dialog: your normal god-fearing junkie. It
dialog: was too savage, too aggressive.
speaker_heading: QUICK FLASHBACK:
text: GONZO SMASHES THE TEN FOOT MIRROR WITH A HAMMER:
text: BACK IN THE ROOM:

speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
text: Grim memories and bad flashbacks.
text: In the bathroom, DUKE'S unlaced boots CRUSH BROKEN GLASS IN
text: VOMIT AND GRAPEFRUIT RINDS.
text: DUKE unzips and pisses. THERE IN THE TOILET BOWL IS THE
speaker_heading: MAGNUM .357!
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: Something ugly had happened. I was
dialog: sure of it...
text: DUKE stares at the golden stream SPLASHING ON THE GUN.
text: The SOUNDS OF VOMITING come from a closet near the front door.
text: DUKE looks into the room. He sees GONZO's ass sticking out
text: of the closet. He opens his mouth to speak when, IN THE
text: SMASHED MIRROR HE SEES THE FRAGMENTED REFLECTION OF HIMSELF...
text: sleeping on the sofa.
text: The ominous SOUND OF A KEY TURNING in the room lock.
text: A hellish scream wakes up the SLEEPING DUKE. He sees GONZO
text: grappling naked with the maid -- gun to her head. GONZO is
text: muffling her screams with an ice bag.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: Please... please... I'm only the
dialog: maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (jumps up from the
text: bed, flashing his
dialog: press badge)
dialog: YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: GONZO
speaker_heading: (to DUKE)
dialog: She must have used a pass key. I
dialog: was polishing my shoes in the
dialog: closet when I noticed her sneaking
dialog: in-so I took her.
text: DUKE shakes his head.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (barks at the MAID)
dialog: What made you do it? Who paid you
dialog: off?
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: Nobody. I'm the maid!
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: You're lying! You were after the
dialog: evidence. Who put you up to
dialog: this -- the manager?
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: I don't know what you're talking
dialog: about!
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Bullshit! You're just as much a
dialog: part of it as they are!
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: Part of what?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: The dope ring. You must know
dialog: what's going on in this hotel. Why
dialog: do you think we're here?
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: (blubbering)
dialog: I know you're cops, but I thought
dialog: you were just here for that
dialog: convention. I swear! All I wanted
dialog: to do was clean up the room. I
dialog: don't know anything about dope!
speaker_heading: GONZO laughs.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Come on, baby don't try to tell us
dialog: you never heard of the Grange Gorman.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: No! No! I swear to Jesus I never
dialog: heard of that stuff!
speaker_heading: DUKE
text: Maybe she's telling the truth.
dialog: Maybe she's not part of it.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: No! I swear I'm not!
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: (long pause)
dialog: In that case, maybe she can help.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: Yes! I'll help you all you need!
dialog: I hate dope!
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: So do we, lady.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: (helping her up)
dialog: I think we should put her on the
dialog: payroll. See what she comes up with.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Do you think you can handle it?
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: One phone call every day. Just
dialog: tell us what you've seen. Don't
dialog: worry if it doesn't add up, that's
dialog: our problem.
text: GONZO hustles the MAID to the door.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: You'd pay me for that?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: You're damn right. But the first
dialog: time you say anything about this,
dialog: to anybody -- you'll go straight to
dialog: prison for the rest of your life.
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: Alice. Just ring Linen Service and
dialog: ask for Alice.
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Alright, Alice... you'll be
text: contacted by Inspector Rock.
dialog: Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a
dialog: politician.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Inspector Rock will pay you. In
dialog: cash. A thousand dollars on the
dialog: ninth of every month.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything
dialog: for that!
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: You and a lot of other people.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: The password is: "One Hand Washes
dialog: The Other." The minute you hear
dialog: that, you say "I fear nothing."
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: I fear nothing.
text: She repeats the password several times while they listen to
dialog: make sure she has it right.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Oh, and don't bother to make up the
dialog: room. That way we won't have to
dialog: risk another of these little
dialog: incidents, will we?
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: Whatever you say, gentlemen. I
dialog: can't tell you how sorry I am about
dialog: what happened...
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Don't worry, it's all over now.
dialog: Thank God for the decent people.
text: She smiles, repeating to herself "One Hand Washes The Other"
text: as GONZO hangs the DO NOT DISTURB sign and shuts the door.
text: CUT BACK TO THE PRESENT.
text: A grimy tape runs through a grunged-up portable tape recorder.
speaker_heading: GONZO ON TAPE
dialog: ... Thank God for the decent people.
dialog: 95.
text: DUKE sits in the middle of the wrecked suite with his

scene_heading: EXT. SAFEWAY SUPERMARKET - DAY

text: DUKE and GONZO burst out of the supermarket riding a shopping

text: The trolley collides into the WHITE WHALE. SHOPPERS gather
text: at the supermarket entrance to watch -- baskets loaded with
text: junk, SCREAMING KIDS and EMPTY WALLETS.
text: DUKE switches on the music: JUMPING JACK FLASH. He selects
text: a coconut -- ceremonially balances it on the hood. GONZO
text: pulls out a silver claw-hammer. A sly look at the gathering
text: CROWD... then he smashes the hammer down on the coconut!
text: A GASP from the surly SHOPPERS.
text: DUKE places another coconut. SMASH! Milk and white meat
text: flies everywhere.
speaker_heading: SHOPPER #1
dialog: Hey! Is that your car?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Sure is.

speaker_heading: SMASH!

speaker_heading: SHOPPER #2
dialog: Meat, hell! Look what you're doing

speaker_heading: SMASH!
speaker_heading: DUKE

speaker_heading: SHOPPER #3
dialog: Someone should stop them!
speaker_heading: SMASH!
speaker_heading: DUKE

speaker_heading: SHOPPER #3

speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Police? Are you people crazy?

speaker_heading: DUKE

text: A final CLANG! GONZO jumps in.
text: DUKE floors the accelerator -- screams at the CROWD.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: You people voted for Hubert Humphrey!
dialog: You killed Jesus!
text: They swerve round and through the CROWD.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)

speaker_heading: DUKE

speaker_heading: GONZO (V/O)
dialog: Drive! Drive! Drive! We have
dialog: fifteen fucking minutes to get me
dialog: on that plane!
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD ON OUTSKIRTS OF LAS VEGAS - DAY
text: The WHITE WHALE, looking like shit -- it's TOP HALF UP,
scene_heading: TORN, SLAPPING IN THE WIND -- ROARS THROUGH AN INTERSECTION
text: as the light turns red.
scene_heading: DR. GONZO FRANTICALLY PAWS OVER A MAP.
text: DUKE drives -- SILENT AND FURIOUS -- sick to his stomach
text: with the PSYCHOTIC GONZO.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: What are you doing? You were
dialog: supposed to turn back there!
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: We had abused every rule that Vegas
dialog: lived by -- burning the locals,
dialog: abusing the tourists, terrifying
dialog: the help. The only chance now, I
dialog: felt, was the possibility that we'd
dialog: gone to such excess that nobody in
dialog: the position to bring the hammer
dialog: down on us could possibility
dialog: believe it.
text: DUKE suddenly SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Jesus Christ!!!
text: There, crossing the road in front of them, is LUCY -- her
text: paintings under her arm -- looking lost. SHE LOOKS UP WITH
text: A VAGUE SENSE OF RECOGNITION...
text: DUKE throws the car into a SKIDDING REVERSE TURN AND ROARS
speaker_heading: OFF.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT ROAD OUTSIDE LAS VEGAS - DAY
text: THE WHITE WHALE TEARS DOWN THE DESERTED FREEWAY. GONZO
text: looks wildly around.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Goddamnit! We're lost! What are
dialog: we doing out here on this
dialog: godforsaken road?
text: GONZO sees that THEY'RE RUNNING PARALLEL WITH THE AIRPORT
speaker_heading: RUNWAY.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: The airport is over there!
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Never missed a plane yet.
text: DUKE HITS THE BRAKES and wrenches the wheel -- takes the
text: WHALE down into the grassy freeway divider. WHEELS CHURNING,
text: HE MAKES IT UP THE OPPOSITE BANK, nose of the car straight
text: up, then BOUNCES ONTO THE FREEWAY and keeps going right OVER
text: A FENCE, dragging it through a cactus field and onto the
speaker_heading: RUNWAY.
text: GONZO is FROZEN WITH FEAR -- GRIPPING THE DASHBOARD. He
text: throws a worried look at DUKE.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: I'll drop you right next to the
dialog: plane.
text: They SPEED UNDER A PARKED AIRPLANE, SHOUTING ABOVE THE JET
scene_heading: ENGINE SCREAM.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: No! I can't get out! They'll
dialog: crucify me. I'll have to take the
dialog: blame!
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (irritatedly)
dialog: Ridiculous! Just say you were
dialog: hitchhiking to the airport and I
dialog: picked you up. You never saw me
dialog: before. Shit, this town is full of
dialog: white Cadillac convertibles. I
dialog: plan to go through there so fast
dialog: that nobody will even glimpse the
dialog: goddamn license plate. You ready?
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Why not? But for Christ's sake,
dialog: just do it fast!
scene_heading: EXT. AT THE AIRPLANE - DAY
text: DUKE SCREECHES UP in front of the DESERT AIR 727. GONZO
text: JUMPS OUT -- HEADS FOR THE PLANE.
text: DUKE watches him go -- RELENTS.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Hey!
text: GONZO stops -- turns.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Don't take any guff from those
dialog: swine. Remember, if you have any
dialog: trouble you can always send a
dialog: telegram to the Right People.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Yeah... Explaining my Position.
dialog: Some asshole wrote a poem about
dialog: that once...
speaker_heading: GONZO pauses.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Probably good advice, if you have
dialog: shit for brains.
text: GONZO turns and RACES TOWARDS THE STEPS JUST AS HE IS ABOUT
text: TO ENTER THE PLANE HE PAUSES AND LOOKS BACK...SMILES...AND
text: LEANS FORWARD AND VOMITS.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: There he goes -- one of God's own
dialog: prototypes -- a high powered mutant
dialog: of some kind never even considered
dialog: for mass production. Too weird to
dialog: live and too rare to die.
dialog: 107.
text: DUKE watches for a second then ROARS AWAY. PULL BACK WITH
scene_heading: THE WHITE SHARK -- LEAVING THE AIRPLANE FAR BEHIND.
scene_heading: INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE/APOCALYPSE - NIGHT
text: On the TV an airplane soars thru the sky. Pull back to find
text: DUKE barricaded in GONZO'S BEDROOM. He is typing on his
dialog: typewriter.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: We are all wired into a survival
dialog: trip now. No more of the speed
dialog: that fueled that 60's. That was
text: the fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip.
dialog: He crashed around America selling
dialog: "consciousness expansion" without
dialog: ever giving a thought to the grim
dialog: meat-hook realities that were lying
dialog: in wait for all the people who took
dialog: him seriously...
text: DUKE records like A WAR CORRESPONDENT. The CAMERA slowly
text: rises -- DUKE alone in the room with the TV SPEWING OUT
text: IMAGES OF WARS AND CIVIL UNREST OF THE 90'S.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: All those pathetically eager acid
dialog: freaks who thought they could buy
dialog: Peace and Understanding for three
dialog: bucks a hit. But their loss and
dialog: failure is ours too. What Leary
dialog: took down with him was the central
dialog: illusion of a whole life-style that
dialog: he helped create...
scene_heading: RISING HIGHER -- THE WALLS OF THE ROOM APPEAR TO BY 20 TO 30
text: FEET HIGH. DUKE SEEMS TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF A WELL... THE
text: CAMERA RISES UP THROUGH BROKEN TIMBERS...
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: ... a generation of permanent
dialog: cripples, failed seekers, who never
dialog: understood the essential old-mystic
dialog: fallacy of the Acid Culture: the
dialog: desperate assumption that somebody...
dialog: or at least some force -- is
text: tending the light at the end of the
dialog: tunnel.
scene_heading: HIGHER STILL -- DUKE ALONE IN THE ROOM -- AN ISOLATED BOX
text: SURROUNDED BY THE TWISTED METAL AND RUBBLE AND SMASHED NEON
text: SIGNS OF THE DEAD CITY -- A BLASTED LANDSCAPE WITHOUT
scene_heading: LIGHT -- SHARDS OF A CIVILIZATION.
dialog: 108.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY
text: A BURNING FLARED-OUT SUN. The camera pans down to DUKE
text: DRIVING THE WRECKED WHALE. A piece of the fence flies out
text: of the back seat as he takes a bump.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: There was only one road back to L.A.
dialog: US Interstate 15, just a flat-out
text: high speed burn through Baker and
text: Barstow and Berdoo, then on to the
dialog: Hollywood Freeway straight into
dialog: frantic oblivion: safety, obscurity,
dialog: just another freak in the Freak
dialog: Kingdom.
text: DUKE sees THE HARDWARE BARN, A RUSTIC OLD FARM BUILDING
text: facing the road with a single gas pump outside and a neon
text: sign that flashes beer.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Ahhh. Wonderful.
text: DUKE PULLS OFF THE ROAD and parks. Gets out and walks in.
scene_heading: INT. HARDWARE BARN - BAKER, CALIFORNIA - DAY
text: DUKE enters the DARK, CLUTTERED INTERIOR. Scattered all
text: about the store are BITS OF AMERICANA... OLD BARRELS, WAGON
text: WHEELS, WOODEN YOKES. A STUFFED HORSE HANGS FROM THE
text: RAFTERS. The sunlight shafts through high windows. AN OLD
text: MAN is repairing an iron pot-bellied stove near the wooden
text: bar. A NORMAN ROCKWELL PAINTING... ONLY REAL.
speaker_heading: PROPRIETOR
dialog: What'll you have?
dialog: DUKE can't quite believe this place -- too good to be true.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (doubtfully)
dialog: Ballantine Ale...?
text: THE PROPRIETOR serves the ale up ice cold. DUKE SMILES AND
speaker_heading: RELAXES.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Hard to find it served like this
dialog: anymore.
text: As he drinks, DUKE toys with a rack of key chains -- LITTLE
scene_heading: AMERICAN ICONS... A REMINGTON COWBOY, A BUGS BUNNY, A TWEETY
text: PIE, BETTY BOOP, A BASEBALL PLAYER. The logo on the rack
text: reads: AMERICAN DREAM KEY RINGS.
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: PROPRIETOR
dialog: Where ya comin' from, young man?
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Las Vegas.
speaker_heading: PROPRIETOR
dialog: A great town, that Vegas. I bet
dialog: you had good luck there. You're
dialog: the type.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
speaker_heading: PROPRIETOR
dialog: (trustingly)
dialog: That's a fine combination. You
dialog: can't lose.
text: A LOVELY GIRL appears. Seeing DUKE, she smiles. CAN THIS
text: REALLY BE HIS LUCKY DAY? She approaches him... and...
text: KISSES THE PROPRIETOR.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (caught off guard... muttering)
dialog: Oh, my God!...
speaker_heading: PROPRIETOR
dialog: (not understanding)
dialog: This is my granddaughter...
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (recovering)
dialog: Don't worry...
dialog: (leans forward in confidence)
dialog: ... and I'm actually the District
dialog: Attorney from Ignoto County.
dialog: (winks)
dialog: Just another good American like
dialog: yourself.
scene_heading: A MOMENT. THE PROPRIETOR'S SMILE DISAPPEARS.
text: Wordlessly the PROPRIETOR and his GRANDDAUGHTER go to the
text: back of the store -- GET ON WITH THEIR WORK -- IGNORING DUKE.
scene_heading: WHO FEELS ASHAMED.
text: DUKE puts some money down on the bar and SLOWLY LEAVES.
scene_heading: EXT. HARDWARE BARN - DAY
text: A CHASTENED DUKE approaches the vomit streaked WHITE WHALE.
text: Gets in -- sits there -- deflated -- miserable...
dialog: 110.
text: A state bus draws up across from the Hardware Barn.
text: Somberly, DUKE watches as TWO YOUNG MARINES with duffel bags
text: step off -- chatting like TRUE BROTHERS...
text: DUKE switches on the ignition. Something rolls off the
text: trembling dash... DUKE catches it...
scene_heading: ONE SINGLE BEAUTIFUL AMYL CAPSULE...
scene_heading: DUKE CRACKS THE AMYL -- INHALES. THE RUSH MAKES HIM GASP --
text: TEETH BARED LIKE A MADMAN.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: HOLY SHIT!!!
text: DUKE GUNS THE ENGINE with a laugh -- leans out -- YELLS AT
text: THE MARINES.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: GOD'S MERCY ON YOU SWINE!
text: DUKE ROARS AWAY. AN AMERICAN FLAG FLIES UP FROM THE DEBRIS
text: IN THE BACK SEAT, MADLY UNFURLING ITSELF AS IT SNAGS ON THE
scene_heading: CONVERTIBLE-TOP FRAME OF THE TRASHED WHITE WHALE!
scene_heading: AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
text: The TWO MARINES look after him CONFUSED.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY
text: DUKE drives fast -- TEETH GRITTED IN FROZEN ECSTASY!!
text: DUKE CRANKS UP THE TAPE RECORDER.
speaker_heading: DUKE (V/O)
dialog: My heart was filled with joy. I
text: felt like a monster reincarnation
dialog: of Horatio Alger... a man on the
dialog: move... and just sick enough to be
dialog: totally confident.
text: The WHITE WHALE WIPES THE SCREEN BLACK.
scene_heading: AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
speaker_heading: END
