speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SISTER JAMES

speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Well, sermons come from somewhere,

speaker_heading: SISTER JAMES
dialog: I suppose you’d have to ask him.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: No, that would not be appropriate.

speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS

speaker_heading: SISTER JAMES
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS

speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Yes. One?
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: Three.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Three?
text: She's appalled and tries to hide it.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: Sweet tooth.
text: She digs at the sugar because the cubes have melded together.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: One. Two. Three. Sister, you care
dialog: for sugar?
speaker_heading: SISTER JAMES
dialog: Never! (Gently, to Flynn.) Not that
dialog: there’s anything wrong with sugar.
text: Sister Aloysius puts the sugar away in her desk.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Well, thank you, Father, for making
dialog: time for us. We are at our wit’s
dialog: end.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: Well, I think it’s an excellent
dialog: idea to rethink the Christmas
dialog: pageant. ‘Cause last year’s effort
dialog: was a little woebegone.
speaker_heading: SISTER JAMES
dialog: Oh, I loved it! But I love all
dialog: pageants. The hymns! O Little Town
dialog: of Bethlehem, O Come O Come
dialog: Emmanuel, O Come All Ye Faithful - -
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: All right. Thank you, Sister
dialog: James! So what do you think,
dialog: Father? Is there something new we
dialog: could do?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: Well, we all love the Christmas
dialog: hymns, but it might be jolly to
text: include a secular song.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Secular?
speaker_heading: FLYNN
text: Yes. IT’S BEGINNING TO LOOK A LOT
text: LIKE CHRISTMAS. Something like
dialog: that.
text: Sister Aloysius gets up.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: What would be the point of a
dialog: secular song?
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: Just fun.
speaker_heading: SISTER JAMES
text: Or FROSTY THE SNOWMAN.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: That’s a good one. We could have
text: one of the boys dress as a snowman
dialog: and dance around.
text: Sister Aloysius flips the blinds. A shaft of sunlight blazes
text: on the priest.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Which boy?
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: (Squinting)
dialog: We'd do tryouts.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
text: FROSTY THE SNOWMAN espouses a pagan
dialog: belief in magic. The snowman comes
text: to life when an enchanted hat is
text: put on his head. If the music were
dialog: more somber, people would realize
dialog: the images are disturbing and the
dialog: song heretical.
text: Sister James and Father Flynn exchange a look.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: SISTER JAMES
dialog: I’ve never thought about Frosty The
dialog: Snowman like that.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Well, it should be banned from the
text: airwaves.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
text: So. Not FROSTY THE SNOWMAN.
text: He writes something in a small notebook.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
text: Oh, IT’S BEGINNING TO LOOK LIKE - -
dialog: A LOT LIKE CHRISTMAS would be fine,
dialog: I suppose. Parents would like it.
dialog: May I ask what you’re writing down?
dialog: With that ballpoint pen?
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: Oh. Nothing. It’s an idea for a
dialog: sermon.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: You had one right now?
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: I get them all the time.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: How fortunate.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: I forget them so I have to write
dialog: them down.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Oh. What is the idea?
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: Intolerance.

speaker_heading: SISTER JAMES
dialog: Would you like a little more tea,
dialog: Father?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: Not yet. (To Sister Aloysius) It’s
dialog: a new time, Sister.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: What’s new about it?
speaker_heading: FLYNN
text: Something inside of people is new.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
text: There is nothing new under the sun.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: The Church needs to change. We
dialog: should sing a song from the radio
dialog: now and then. Take the kids out for
dialog: ice cream.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Sweet tooth.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: Maybe take the boys on a camping
dialog: trip.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: The point being?
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: We should be friendlier. You know,
dialog: the children and the parents should
dialog: see us as members of their family.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: But we are not members of their
dialog: family. We’re different.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: Why? Because of our vows?
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Precisely.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: I don’t think we're so different.
dialog: You know, Sister, I would take some
dialog: more tea.
text: Flynn gets up. Sister James gets up.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: And they think we’re different,
dialog: yeah? The working class people of
dialog: this parish trust us to be
dialog: different.
text: Flynn flips the blinds closed.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: I think we’re getting off the
dialog: subject.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Yes, you’re right. You're right.
dialog: Back to it.
text: The wall intercom rings. She answers it.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Yes, Sister Raymond? (Listens.)
dialog: Well you tell her to wash her face
dialog: and her neck and report to me at
dialog: three.
text: She hangs up.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: (turning on the desk lamp)
dialog: Excuse me. The Christmas pageant.
dialog: We must be careful how Donald
text: Miller is used in the pageant.
text: Sister James shakes as she pours the tea, spilling a little.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: Easy there, Sister.
speaker_heading: SISTER JAMES
dialog: Oh, uh, yes, Father.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: All right, what about Donald
dialog: Miller?
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: We must be careful, in the pageant,
dialog: that we neither hide Donald Miller
dialog: nor put him forward.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: Because of the color of his skin?
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: That's right, yeah.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Oh come, Father.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: I think he should be treated like
dialog: every other boy.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Well, you yourself singled the boy
dialog: out for special attention. You held
text: a private meeting with him at the
text: Rectory. (Shooting a look at Sister
dialog: James) A week ago?
speaker_heading: SISTER JAMES
dialog: Yes.
text: Flynn picks a lemon drop out of the bag.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: What are we talking about?
speaker_heading: SISTER JAMES
dialog: Donald Miller?
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: The boy acted strangely when he
text: returned to class.
text: The priest turns to Sister James, popping a lemon drop in his
dialog: mouth.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: He did?
speaker_heading: SISTER JAMES
text: When he returned from the Rectory.
dialog: A little odd, yes.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Can you tell us why?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: How did he act strangely?
speaker_heading: SISTER JAMES
dialog: He...I’m not sure how to explain
dialog: it. He...he laid his head on the
dialog: desk, and he...some...
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: Do you mean you had some
dialog: impression?
speaker_heading: SISTER JAMES
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: And he’d come from the Rectory so
dialog: you're asking me?
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Hmmm.
speaker_heading: SISTER JAMES
dialog: That’s it.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: Mmhmmm.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Hmmm.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: Mm-hmmm. Hmmm. Did you want to
dialog: discuss the pageant, is that why
dialog: I’m here, or is this what you
dialog: wanted to discuss?
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: This.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: Well. I’m a little uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: Why do you think?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: The boy’s well-being is my
dialog: responsibility.
text: The phone rings.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
text: His well-being is not at issue.
scene_heading: DUTCH ANGLE OF PHONE ON SISTER ALOYSIUS’ DESK
text: It rings. She doesn’t answer it.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: I’m not satisfied that that is

speaker_heading: SISTER JAMES
dialog: No.

speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS

speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: (overlaps)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: I object to your tone.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: This is not about my tone... or
dialog: your tone, Father Flynn. It’s about
text: arriving at the truth.
text: The phone stops ringing.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: Of what?
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: You know what I’m talking about.
dialog: Don’t you? You’re controlling the
dialog: expression on your face right now.
dialog: Aren't you?
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: My face? What exactly are you
dialog: accusing me of?
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: I am not accusing you of anything,
dialog: Father Flynn. I am asking you to
dialog: tell me what happened in the
text: Rectory.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: I don’t wish to continue this. And
dialog: if you're dissatisfied with that, I
dialog: suggest you speak to Monsignor
dialog: Benedict. I can only imagine this

speaker_heading: SISTER JAMES

dialog: You should’ve let it alone.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: Mr. McGuinn caught Donald drinking
dialog: altar wine. When I found out, I
text: sent for him. There were tears. And
dialog: he begged not to be removed from
dialog: the altar boys. I took pity on him.
dialog: I told him if no one else found
dialog: out, I would let him stay on.
text: Sister James leaps to her feet, overjoyed.
speaker_heading: SISTER JAMES
dialog: Oh, what a relief! That explains
dialog: everything! Thanks be to God! Look,
dialog: Sister, it was all a mistake!
text: Sister Aloysius is unmoved.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: And if I talk to Mr. McGuinn?
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: Oh, talk to him by all means. But
text: now that the boy’s secret’s out,
dialog: I’m going to have to remove him
dialog: from the altar boys. That’s what I
text: was trying to avoid.
speaker_heading: SISTER JAMES
dialog: You were trying to protect the boy!
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: That’s right.
speaker_heading: SISTER JAMES
dialog: I might have done the same thing!
dialog: (To Sister Aloysius) Is there a way
dialog: Donald could stay on the altar
dialog: boys?
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: If the boy drank altar wine, he
dialog: can’t continue as an altar boy.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: Of course. Are you satisfied?
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: Hmmm. Well, I’1l be going. I have
dialog: some writing to do.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS

speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: That's right. I’m not pleased with
dialog: how you handled this, Sister.
dialog: Sister.
dialog: He goes.
text: Sister James weakly launches into optimism.
speaker_heading: SISTER JAMES
dialog: Well. What a relief! He cleared it

speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: You believe him?
speaker_heading: SISTER JAMES
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Isn't it that it’s easier to
dialog: believe him?
speaker_heading: SISTER JAMES
dialog: But we can corroborate his story
text: with Mr. McGuinn.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Mmm...hmm. Yes. These types of
dialog: people are clever.
speaker_heading: SISTER JAMES
dialog: Well, I’m convinced!
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: You're not. You just want things to
dialog: be resolved so you can have
dialog: simplicity back.
speaker_heading: SISTER JAMES
dialog: I want no further part of this.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: I'll bring him down.
speaker_heading: SISTER JAMES
dialog: How can you be so sure that he is
dialog: lying?
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Experience.
speaker_heading: SISTER JAMES
dialog: You just don’t like him! You don’t
dialog: like it that he uses a ballpoint
dialog: pen. You don’t like it that he
text: takes three lumps of sugar in his
dialog: tea. You don’t like it that he
dialog: likes FROSTY THE SNOWMAN. And
dialog: you're letting that convince you of
dialog: something terrible, just terrible!
dialog: Well, I like FROSTY THE SNOWMAN!
dialog: And I think it would be nice if
dialog: this school weren’t run like a
dialog: jail! And I think it’s a good thing
dialog: I love to teach History and that I
dialog: might inspire my students to love
dialog: it, too! And if you judge that to
dialog: mean that I’m not fit to be a
dialog: teacher, then so be it!
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Sit down.
text: Sister James immediately complies. The light bulb over her
text: head flashes and goes out.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Look at that. You blew out my
dialog: light. In ancient Sparta, important
dialog: matters were decided by who shouted
dialog: loudest. Fortunately, we are not in
dialog: ancient Sparta. You honestly find
dialog: the students in this school to be
dialog: treated like inmates in a prison?
speaker_heading: SISTER JAMES
dialog: No. Actually, they all seem fairly

speaker_heading: SISTER JAMES

speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: There are people who go after your

speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS

scene_heading: MRS. MILLER

dialog: May have made.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: I can’t be certain.
scene_heading: MRS. MILLER
dialog: No evidence?
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: No.
scene_heading: MRS. MILLER
dialog: Then maybe there’s nothing to it.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: I think there is something to it.
dialog: I think Father Flynn gave Donald

scene_heading: MRS. MILLER
dialog: Why would he do that?
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Has Donald been acting strange

scene_heading: MRS. MILLER

speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: I don’t uhh...I’m not sure you

scene_heading: MRS. MILLER
dialog: I think I understand the kind of
dialog: thing you’re talking about. But I
dialog: don’t want to get into it.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: What’s that?
scene_heading: MRS. MILLER
dialog: Look, I only have a few minutes.
dialog: Not to be disagreeing, but if we’re
dialog: talking about something floating
dialog: around between this priest and my
dialog: son, it ain’t my son’s fault.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Oh, I’m not suggesting that--.
scene_heading: MRS. MILLER
dialog: (overlaps)
dialog: He’s just a boy.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: I know.
scene_heading: MRS. MILLER
dialog: Twelve years old. If somebody

dialog: be the man, not the boy.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: I know. I agree with you
dialog: completely.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 74.
scene_heading: MRS. MILLER
dialog: You're agreeing with me, but I got
dialog: called to the principal if you know
dialog: what I’m saying.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: I am concerned about Donald’s
dialog: welfare.
scene_heading: MRS. MILLER
dialog: You honestly think that priest gave
dialog: Donald that wine to drink?
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Yes, I do.
scene_heading: MRS. MILLER
dialog: Then how come my son got kicked off
dialog: the altar boys if it was the man
dialog: that gave it to him?
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: I know. The boy got caught, the man
dialog: didn’t.
scene_heading: MRS. MILLER
dialog: So you're giving my son the blame.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: No.
scene_heading: MRS. MILLER
dialog: No problem my son getting blamed.
dialog: And you know why that is?
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Perhaps you should let me talk. I
dialog: think you’re getting upset now.
scene_heading: MRS. MILLER
dialog: Sister, you ain’t going against no
dialog: MAN in a ROBE and win. He’s got the
dialog: position.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: And he’s got your son.
scene_heading: MRS. MILLER
dialog: Let him have him then.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS

scene_heading: MRS. MILLER

speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Do you know what you’re saying?
scene_heading: MRS. MILLER
dialog: Know more about it than you.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS

scene_heading: MRS. MILLER
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: I know I am right.

scene_heading: MRS. MILLER

speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS

scene_heading: MRS. MILLER

dialog: don’t cover it.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: I know what I won’t accept!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 76.
scene_heading: MRS. MILLER
dialog: You accept what you gotta accept

speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: This man is in my school.
scene_heading: MRS. MILLER
dialog: Well, he’s gotta be somewhere and
dialog: maybe he’s doing some good, too.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: He is after the boys!
scene_heading: MRS. MILLER
dialog: Well, maybe some of them boys want
dialog: to get caught! That’s why his
dialog: father beat him. Not the wine.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: What are you telling me?
scene_heading: MRS. MILLER
dialog: I’m talking about the boy’s nature
dialog: now, not anything he’s done. You
dialog: can’t hold a child responsible for
dialog: what God gave him to be.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: I’m only interested in actions,
dialog: Mrs. Miller.
scene_heading: MRS. MILLER
dialog: But then there’s the boy’s nature.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Leave that out of it.
scene_heading: MRS. MILLER
dialog: Forget it then. You’re the one
dialog: forcing people to say things. My
dialog: boy came to your school ‘cause they
dialog: were going to kill him in the
dialog: public school. His father don’t
dialog: like him. He come to your school,
dialog: kids don’t like him. One man is
dialog: good to him. This priest. Then does
dialog: the man have his reasons? Yes.
dialog: Everybody does. YOU have your
dialog: reasons.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 77.
dialog: But do I ask the man why he’s good
dialog: to my son? No. I don’t care why. My
dialog: son needs some man to care about
dialog: him and to see him through the way
dialog: he wants to go. I thank God, this
text: educated man with some kindness in
dialog: him wants to do just that.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: This will not do.
scene_heading: MRS. MILLER
dialog: It’s just till June.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: I'll throw your son out of this
dialog: school.
scene_heading: MRS. MILLER
dialog: And why would you do that if it
dialog: didn’t start with him?
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Because I will stop this.
scene_heading: MRS. MILLER
dialog: You'd hurt my son to get your way?
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: It won’t end with your son.
scene_heading: MRS. MILLER
dialog: Throw the priest out then.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: I am trying to do just that.
scene_heading: MRS. MILLER
dialog: Then what do you want from me?
text: Sister Aloysius struggles for a moment.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS

speaker_heading: FLYNN

speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS

dialog: came to drink it.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: Did his mother have something to

speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: FLYNN

speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: I am not satisfied.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: Ask the boy then!
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Oh, he’d protect you.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: Why would he do that?
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Because you have seduced him.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: You're insane! You’ve got it in

dialog: child after giving him wine, and
dialog: nothing I say will change that.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: That’s right.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: But this has nothing to do with the
dialog: wine. Not really. You had a

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS

speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: Did you know that Donald’s father

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS

speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: This morning, before I spoke with
dialog: Mrs. Miller, I took the precaution
dialog: of calling your last parish.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: What'd he say?
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: The Pastor.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: I did not speak to the Pastor. I
text: spoke to a nun.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: You should have spoken to the
dialog: Pastor.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: I spoke to a nun.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: You know that’s not the proper
dialog: route for you to have taken,
dialog: Sister! The Church is very clear.
dialog: You’re supposed to go through the
dialog: Pastor.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Why? You have an understanding, you
dialog: and he?
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: No, you have no right to go
dialog: rummaging through my past!
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: You have a history. This is your
dialog: third parish in five years. Why?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: Call the Pastor. Ask him why I
dialog: left! It’s perfectly innocent.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: I’m not calling the Pastor.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: I’m a good priest!
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: You will go after another child and

dialog: stopped.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: What nun did you speak to?
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: I won't say.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: I’ve not touched a child.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: You have.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: You haven’t the slightest proof of
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: But I have my certainty, and armed
dialog: with that, I will go to your last
dialog: parish, and the one before that if
dialog: necessary. I’1l find a parent.
dialog: Trust me, Father Flynn, I will.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: You have no right to act on your
dialog: own! You have taken vows, obedience
dialog: being one! You answer to us! You
dialog: have no right to step outside the
dialog: church!
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: I will step outside the church if
dialog: that’s what needs to be done, till

speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: Have you never done anything wrong?
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: I have.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: A mortal sin?
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: I confessed it, Father!
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: Then whatever I have done, I have
dialog: left in the healing hands of my
dialog: confessor. As have you! We are the
dialog: same!
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS

dialog: are things beyond your knowledge.
dialog: Even if you feel certainty, it is
text: an emotion, not a fact.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: You will request a transfer, and
dialog: take a leave of absence until it’s
dialog: granted.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: You'd leave me nothing.
speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: It’s Donald Miller who has nothing,

dialog: that.
speaker_heading: FLYNN
dialog: I’ve done nothing wrong. I care

speaker_heading: SISTER ALOYSIUS
dialog: Why? ‘Cause you smile at him and
dialog: you sympathize with him, and you
dialog: talk to him as if you were the
dialog: same? You are a cheat. And that
