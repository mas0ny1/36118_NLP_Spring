dialog: at you folks, right now...
speaker_heading: SUPER: 2007
text: We follow the back of her head as she joins the rest, like

text: THE HALLWAY. For a moment, they plunge into darkness. Then--
scene_heading: INT. MOVES - THE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
text: Destiny steps into the light. The music is overwhelming. It
text: takes a moment for our eyes to adjust. The room is enormous,
text: two floors, no windows, pink and red neon lights, smoke
text: machines, strobes, mirrors. The girls are transformed.
speaker_heading: DJ (0.S.)
dialog: Here at Moves, we’re gonna give you

text: They are all paired off. Destiny is alone.
speaker_heading: DJ (0.S.)
dialog: And now, let’s welcome to the main-—
dialog: stage...the one, the only...Ramona.
text: Destiny turns to see RAMONA (10 years older than Destiny)
text: take the main-stage like a boxer entering the ring. Ramona
text: dances, commanding the room. The crowd is wild, throwing

text: Ramona finishes her routine with one final flourish, smacks
text: an armful of money to her chest, and steps off-stage.
text: Destiny watches in awe as Ramona crosses the room, all
text: different guys reaching out. Ramona looks them in the eyes,

text: Destiny can’t look away, as Ramona walks by, turns to her:
speaker_heading: RAMONA
dialog: Doesn’t money make you horny?

dialog: Destiny’s face, we...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MOVES - ROOFTOP - LATER

dialog: Hustler... I was a centerfold once.
speaker_heading: DESTINY
dialog: No way...
speaker_heading: RAMONA
dialog: 193.
speaker_heading: DESTINY

speaker_heading: DESTINY
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Stevie Wonder? Noooo...what for?
speaker_heading: RAMONA
dialog: Casey had him in the champagne
text: room. Swears he isn’t blind.
text: Destiny laughs into a sigh. Then...
speaker_heading: DESTINY
dialog: Hey how come you’re so good with
dialog: everybody? I mean, I’ve seen you
dialog: with the guys, all different guys,
dialog: and...I don’t know, you seem to
dialog: have ‘em all figured out.
text: Ramona takes a drag.
speaker_heading: RAMONA
dialog: I’m just a people person, I guess.
dialog: (exhales)
dialog: It’s easier if you think of them as
dialog: your rich friends. Especially if
dialog: you gotta see the same ones all the
dialog: time. Some of ‘em aren’t so bad.
text: Ramona starts playing with Destiny’s hair.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: RAMONA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: RAMONA
dialog: You followed the green brick road.
speaker_heading: DESTINY
dialog: (slight laugh)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: RAMONA
dialog: So far, so good?
text: Destiny gestures “so-so”.
speaker_heading: RAMONA (CONT'D)
dialog: Get out. You must be cleaning up.
dialog: You're new. You're Asian. You’re
dialog: gorgeous. You're a triple-threat.
text: Destiny laughs. Ramona keeps playing with her hair.
speaker_heading: DESTINY
dialog: .«-. well... maybe you could show me
dialog: some... new moves... sometime...
text: Ramona looks at Destiny. It takes a moment. Then...
speaker_heading: RAMONA
dialog: Maybe we could work together. I
dialog: could give you a crash course in
dialog: this place. Introduce you to some
dialog: of my regulars. Mostly Wall Street
dialog: guys looking to spend money on
dialog: pretty girls. Would you like that?
text: As a smile spreads across Destiny’s face, we hear...
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)

scene_heading: INT. MOVES - PRIVATE AREA - NIGHT
text: Destiny and Ramona dance for the bottom-tier guy. Ramona
text: SHOUTS over the music but for some reason, he can’t hear her.
speaker_heading: RAMONA

speaker_heading: RAMONA (V.O.)
dialog: All you have to do is figure out
dialog: who you're dealing with. And then
dialog: play them at their level.
text: Ramona bends down, puts her thumbs under Destiny’s thong,

scene_heading: INT. MOVES - LOCKER ROOM - LATER
text: End of the night. Destiny counts out her tips, marveling at
text: the stack. She looks at the other girls, Jackie, Tracy,

speaker_heading: RAMONA
dialog: Here...

dialog: Specifically saltwater. Try ‘em on.
text: Destiny steps right into the denim bikini bottoms under her

speaker_heading: RAMONA
dialog: Yeah, that’s how I feel. I just

speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
