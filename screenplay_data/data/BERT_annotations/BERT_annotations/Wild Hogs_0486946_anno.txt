scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
text: ANGLE ON: BILLY MATTHEWS, 8, ravenously eating a plate
text: of hashbrowns, runny fried eggs and syrupy waffles.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (O.C.)
dialog: Doug?...
text: We see DOUG MATTHEWS, 40's, sitting across the table,
text: staring at his son, Billy. Doug is handsome in that
dialog: honest, sincere way. A guy you would call to help you
text: move a couch. He watches Billy scoop up his hashbrowns
text: with a frosted pop-tart. Billy catches his Dad's look
text: and grins with his mouth full. Doug smiles back, then
text: looks down at his own plate. He has scrambled egg whites
text: and sliced tomatoes. His smile fades away.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (O.C.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Doug?
text: Doug snaps out of it and looks up at his wife, KELLY
text: MATTHEWS. She's attractive, with a patient smile.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I've got some stuff to do for the party
dialog: tomorrow. Can you take Billy to school?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: What "stuff"? This party isn't going to
dialog: be fancy, is it? Just some friends and a
dialog: wing platter from Costco?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: It's a our 10th anniversary, Doug. Its
dialog: going to be a nice party with nice food
dialog: and nice music. And wings have carbs, so
dialog: you can't eat them anyway.
speaker_heading: BILLY
speaker_heading: (MOUTH FULL)
dialog: I'll eat 'em.
text: Doug gives Billy a look.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: No you won't. Because I'm going to
text: scrape the batter off.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: That doesn't work.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 2.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I went to medical school. You think I
dialog: don't know how carbs work?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Dentists go to medical school?
text: Doug looks a little insulted.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Doug, can you take Billy or not?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yeah, I can take him. There aren't any
text: emergencies at the office this morning.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You have emergencies?
speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: (INDIGNANT)
dialog: Yes, I have emergencies. That's what my
dialog: pager is for. one beep from that thing,
text: and bam. I'm off. Like a cheetah.
text: Billy, now pouring lucky charms into a bowl, looks up.
speaker_heading: BILLY
speaker_heading: (MOUTH FULL)
dialog: The battery ith gone in that thing. You
text: took them out for the TV clicker.
text: Doug gives Billy a look.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I did do that. I forgot about that. I
dialog: need to get some batteries in there.
dialog: Because dentists do have emergencies. We
dialog: are doctors, you know? We take the same
dialog: oath. The oath of saving lives.
text: Doug goes to take some of Billy's discarded Lucky Charms.
text: Billy swats his hand away.
speaker_heading: BILLY
speaker_heading: (MOUTH FULL)
dialog: Uh uh. Carbth.
text: Doug nods, defeated, as Billy hops up and dumps the
text: remaining lucky charms in the trash.
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 3.
scene_heading: INT. VOLVO - LATER THAT MORNING
text: DOUG drives a Volvo station wagon along the streets of
text: Cincinnati. BILLY is next to him, in the passenger
text: seat, looking bored. Doug notices.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: You know, I use to race a car like this.
dialog: Put a hemi under the hood... Nobody saw
dialog: me coming.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yup. It could really... smoke some ass.
text: Billy raises his eyebrows, impressed. Doug smiles. This
dialog: was a good time to break the "no saying ass" rule.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes, sir. They called it the dragon
dialog: wagon. You're lucky to be in here
dialog: without a helmet, pal. We both are.
text: Doug downshifts a gear, and the tame engine roars
text: artificially. Billy is impressed.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Awesome! Hey, can I jam the radio?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Heck yeah, you can jam the radio.
text: Doug tussles Billy's hair and smiles.
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. TRAFFIC LIGHT - A FEW MINUTES LATER
text: The Volvo pulls up to a red light. Radio Disney blares
text: "MICKEY LOVES MAMBO" from the stereo. BILLY bobs his
text: head along with the music. DOUG looks out the window
text: and sees a mid-twenties guy in a Porsche, staring at him.
text: Doug nods hello, then awkwardly faces forward.

scene_heading: INT. SMALL OFFICE - MORNING
scene_heading: VOICE ON SPEAKERPHONE
dialog: Bob?...
text: BOB LEVENSTEIN, 40s, is working at his computer. Bob is
text: good enough looking, but with a gawky wimpishness and
text: burdened eyes. He tries to ignore the speakerphone.
speaker_heading: VOICE ON SPEAKERPHONE (CONT'D)
dialog: Bob!?
text: Bob cringes at the shrill, female voice.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Hey, honey.
scene_heading: VOICE ON SPEAKERPHONE
dialog: You need to come tell Haley she can't go
dialog: to a party tonight.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (into speaker phone)
dialog: Well, I'm technically at the office right
dialog: now, so...
text: The door behind him flings open, and KAREN LEVENSTEIN,
text: attractive and harsh-looking, steps in holding a phone.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Are you kidding me!? You work in our
text: guest bedroom, not an office.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I know, I was just trying to make this
speaker_heading: DEADLINE--
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Yeah, and I have to go to a job that
dialog: actually makes us money, Bob. So, get
dialog: out here and tell Haley she's not going
dialog: anywhere!
text: Bob nods obediently and hurries out of the room.
scene_heading: INT. BOB'S HOUSE / KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER
text: Bob enters the kitchen. His five year-old daughter,
text: CLAIRE, wearing a dance leotard, walks up to him and
dialog: smiles.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 5.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Hey, Daddy. Listen.
text: (screams at the top of her
speaker_heading: LUNGS)
scene_heading: EEEEEIIIIIIIIIAAAAAAAAAAAA1
text: Bob winces, and looks around for his other daughter.
speaker_heading: SFX: PHONE RINGS
text: Bob reaches for it, but his other teenage daughter,
text: HALEY, runs in, wearing a denim mini-skirt and Ugg boots.
speaker_heading: HALEY
dialog: No!! Don't touch that! It's Julien!
text: Haley snatches the phone away from Bob.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Actually, I need to talk to you--
speaker_heading: HALEY
speaker_heading: (IGNORING BOB)
dialog: Hey, Julien. Yeah, totally. I'll
text: probably just drop by and chill.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: If that's about the party, you--
speaker_heading: HALEY
dialog: Dad! I'm talking, here. God!
text: Haley storms out of the room. Bob goes to say something,
text: but CLAIRE enters and looks up at him.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
speaker_heading: (SCREAMING AGAIN)
dialog: Eeeeeeeiiiiiaaaaa!!
text: Bob just stares at her, as Karen enters the Kitchen.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: (yelling above Claire)
dialog: Did you talk to her? Tell me you talked
dialog: to her. God! I have to do everything!
dialog: Just get Claire to ballet. She's late.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well, I really have to finish my--
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Your little article for the "Web"
dialog: magazine, Bob?
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: "wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 6.
speaker_heading: KAREN (CONT'D)
dialog: I have a shareholder meeting. And we
dialog: agreed that my career would be the
dialog: priority, and you would work out of the
dialog: house. You might not like it, but my job
dialog: is higher paying. And I don't see you
dialog: complaining about that hundred dollar
dialog: shirt you're wearing.
text: Bob looks down at his too-hip dress shirt.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You bought this shirt for me. I was fine
dialog: with my t-shirts--
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Oh, you don't like the shirt now? Fine.
dialog: Take it off.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Take it off! You don't want to wear nice
dialog: things, don't. Off!
text: Bob sighs and takes the shirt off. Karen snatches it
dialog: from him.
speaker_heading: KAREN (CONT'D)
dialog: Now take Claire to her ballet class.
text: It's starts in five minutes.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well, I have to get another--
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Go! Five minutes!
text: Karen pushes Bob out the door, with Claire skipping
text: happily behind him.
scene_heading: INT. BOB'S CAR - A MOMENT LATER
text: Bob sits in the car, SHIRTLESS, next to Claire. He looks
text: over at her, and notices a pink hoodie in her lap.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You going to wear that?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: For five dollars, I'm not.
text: Bob sighs and reaches for his wallet.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 7.
scene_heading: INT. CHILDREN'S DANCE STUDIO - FIVE MINUTES LATER
text: A bunch of kids in dance leotards are starting a class.
text: Claire comes running into the group, as Bob enters behind
text: her, wearing the pink hoodie. It's way too small, and
text: doesn't quite cover his belly. He sits with the parents
text: and nods awkwardly to them. It's embarrassing.
scene_heading: FADE TO BLACK:
scene_heading: FADE BACK IN ON:
scene_heading: INT. MODERN HOUSE - MORNING
text: We see the pristine living room of an expensive,
dialog: architectural house.
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE (O.C.)
dialog: Woody.
speaker_heading: (GETTING ANGRY)
dialog: Woody Stevens!
text: We see WOODY STEVENS, 40s, handsome, but with shifty eyes
text: and a Michael Keaton hairline, walk through the stylish
text: house speaking into a cordless headset.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: .No, you listen to me. You're not
dialog: going to push me around. We agreed on a
dialog: price, and that's the price I'll pay. If
dialog: you don't like it, walk away... but you
dialog: can kiss your business good bye, because
dialog: that's what happens when you screw with
dialog: Woody Stevens. You go down. Hard.
text: As Woody talks, he passes by framed magazine covers of a
text: beautiful model, (CLAUDIA) as well as some pictures of
text: his wedding day with her, their exotic vacations, and one
text: blownup glamour shot of Woody, shirtless, oiled and
text: holding a greasy wrench.
speaker_heading: WOODY (CONT'D)
dialog: .No, money's not the problem (LAUGHS)
dialog: Money's never a problem. You just need
dialog: to honor the correct price. Got it?
text: Woody gets his answer, and angrily throws the headset
text: down on a stack of moving boxes. He marches to the front
text: door and throws it open.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 8.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Woody yells out the front door.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: .Then go home, Toby! You make me sick!
text: ANGLE ON: The front yard. A ten-year-old boy is
text: standing with a rake, surrounded by leaves. He clicks
text: off his cellphone and shrugs.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: I can't do this many leaves for ten
dialog: bucks! It'll take two hours!
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Well, you should have thought of that
dialog: before you put the "any yard for ten
text: bucks" flyer on the telephone pole.
dialog: You're done on this block, now. And that
dialog: goes for your band fund-raisers, too.
dialog: I'm not buying any candy bars no matter
dialog: what parade you dorks have to get to!
text: Woody slams the door closed. Toby kicks at a pile of
text: leaves, then starts home.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
scene_heading: FADE BACK IN ON:
scene_heading: INT. CLUTTERED OFFICE - MORNING
text: We see an office crowded with disassembled Apple
text: computers, motherboards, and abandoned monitors.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER VOICE
dialog: Dudley?
text: ANGLE ON: DUDLEY FRANK (late 30s), an odd-looking, curly-
text: haired guy with black plastic glasses that are slightly
text: too big for his face. He stares at a computer in front
dialog: of him.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Yeah, hey, Mac. How's it go--
speaker_heading: COMPUTER VOICE
text: It is now nine o'clock am.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 9.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Thanks, Mac. Open internet, okay?
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER VOICE
dialog: Command unknown.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Mac. Open. Internet.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER VOICE
text: It is now nine o'clock am.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Alright, Mac. I'll show you.
text: Dudley clicks a few keys and nods satisfactorily.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER VOICE
dialog: Internet open.
text: Dudley laughs good-naturedly.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Right, because I just opened it.
speaker_heading: (SIGHS)
dialog: I guess I need to research alternative
dialog: specs.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER VOICE
dialog: Searching "alternative sex."
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: What? No!
text: Dudley jumps forward and starts hitting the keys.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER VOICE
dialog: Two million websites found.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: I didn't want to search that! I said
dialog: specs... "all the data to be compiled."
speaker_heading: COMPUTER VOICE
dialog: Searching "sex all the day with child."
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Ahhh, No!!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 10.
text: Dudley frantically starts ripping the power wires out of
text: the computer. The monitor goes dark. Dudley touches it
text: sadly, then looks over at a cat sitting on the edge of
dialog: the desk.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO CAT)
dialog: Looks like it's still just you and me,
dialog: icat.
text: Dudley reaches out to pet the cat. It hisses at him
text: angrily, and he quickly pulls his hand back.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DOUG MATTHEW'S OFFICE - THAT AFTERNOON
text: DOUG, now in his lab coat, sits at his desk, playing with
text: a model of a mouth. The phone rings and Doug answers it.
speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Hey, honey.
text: INTERCUT WITH KELLY: On the phone at home.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You busy?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Me? Oh, yeah. I've got a mouth right
dialog: here in front of me.
text: Doug takes a dental tool and hammers on the plastic
dialog: mouth.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Don't they mind you being on the phone?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Well, it's not attached to a head,
dialog: really. More research.
text: Doug hits the mouth too hard and all the teeth fall out.
text: He fumbles to stop them from scattering everywhere.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 11.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Oh. Well, I just wanted to tell you I
dialog: found a great rate for the Ritz-Carlton
dialog: tomorrow night. I Thought it might be
dialog: romantic. Mom can stay here with Billy.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I don't know. Do you think we really
dialog: need to stay at a hotel? I mean, Billy
dialog: has his own room. Why don't we just buy
dialog: new sheets? Like, hotel-colored ones.
dialog: It'll be like the Ritz, but we won't have
dialog: to pay to make phone calls!
speaker_heading: KELLY
speaker_heading: DOUG--
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: What? I'm just saying--
text: Suddenly, the speaker comes on overhead.
speaker_heading: VOICE ON SPEAKER
dialog: Dr. Matthews? Patient emergency in room
dialog: eight.
text: Doug snaps to attention.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Emergency?
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: I've got to go! Emergency!
text: Doug jumps out of his seat and scrambles over his desk
text: and out the door.
scene_heading: INT. DENTAL EXAM ROOM - A SECOND LATER
text: Doug flies into an exam room, where a hygienist, DANA, is
text: looking into a male patient's mouth.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Doctor Matthews. Finally. Take a look
dialog: at this.
text: Doug looks in the man's mouth and nods.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Acute molar abscess. That's going to
dialog: need emergency surgery.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 12.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: That's what I thought. Thank God you got
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Well, let's send him over to an
dialog: Orthopedic surgeon.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Absolutely. Thanks, doctor.
text: Doug nods. He looks around for something else to do, but
text: there's nothing. He moves a dental tool away from the
text: edge of a tray, smiles politely and exits.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DOUG'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - LATER THAT AFTERNOON
text: DOUG, looking depressed, pulls into the driveway. He
text: looks over and sees BILLY and three of his friends
text: shooting baskets. He smiles, gets out of the car and
text: struts over.
speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: (TO KIDS)
dialog: Yo! Matthews is open.
text: Billy looks up and cringes a little bit, but passes the
text: ball to DOUG. Doug dribbles it under his leg and charges
dialog: the basket.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: Taking it into the paint. Who's got the
dialog: D? Whoop, too late, dudes! Booya!
text: Doug jumps up to slam the ball, but only hammers it into
text: the rim. The rim clangs loudly and the ball goes flying
text: backwards. Billy's friends laugh a little. Doug
dialog: notices.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, that's not really my shot. I
dialog: usually hit from downtown, you know?
text: Doug grabs the ball out of the bushes and dribbles back
text: to the three point line.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 13.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: That's where the big games get won. Back
dialog: here from the three--
text: Doug swivels, jumps up and releases the ball. It heads
text: towards the basket, then falls down five feet before it.
text: It looks more like a pass than a shot. Billy hangs his
text: head, humiliated.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: That was a pass, dudes!
dialog: It wasn't.
text: Doug nods with false confidence to the kids, stands there
text: awkwardly for a moment, then quietly heads inside.
scene_heading: INT. DOUG'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER
text: DOUG enters and finds KELLY. She smiles and kisses him.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Hey, honey. Snack?
text: Kelly hands Doug a sandwich bag of celery. He looks over
text: to the table, where Kelly has laid out Ritz crackers
text: covered in cheez whiz, for the kids. Doug puts the bag
text: of celery down.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I'm okay. I think I'm just going to go
dialog: meet the guys for a beer.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: 
dialog: Okay. Lite beer, if you want to stick to
dialog: that diet.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: 
dialog: Right. Yes. Lite beer. No carbs. Just
dialog: delicious beer... water.
text: Doug smiles and heads upstairs. Kelly looks concerned.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DOUG'S BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER
text: Doug enters his bedroom and shuts the door behind him.
text: He sits down on the bed and lets out a long sigh.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 14.
text: After a moment, he gets up and walks over to the closet.
text: He opens it and we see: A leather biker jacket, leather
text: chaps, boots, gloves, a black "half-helmet," etc. For
text: the first time, we see a genuine smile come over Doug's
dialog: face.
scene_heading: MUSIC CUE: IGGY POP'S "REAL WILD ONE (WILD CHILD)"
scene_heading: EXT. DOUG'S DRIVEWAY - A FEW MINUTES LATER
text: The garage door on Doug's house rolls open like a theater
text: curtain, and Doug, wearing the full leather biker getup,
text: idles out of the garage on a gleaming, chromed-out Harley
text: Davidson Fatboy. He looks around the neighborhood
text: cockily, smiles, then kicks the bike into gear and rides
text: into the street. The camera rotates around him and comes
text: to rest on the back of his jacket, where we see a large
text: patch that reads "Wild Hogs." The camera ZOOMS IN ON
dialog: THIS, and it becomes:
speaker_heading: TITLE CARD
scene_heading: MUSIC CUE CONTINUES OVER FOLLOWING SCENES:
scene_heading: EXT. BOB LEVENSTEIN'S HOUSE - SAME TIME
text: BOB creeps through the living room. From the kitchen, we
text: can hear KAREN, HALEY and CLAIRE screaming things at him,
text: about him, etc. He just tip-toes to the hall closet and
text: opens the door. We don't see what's in it, but see Bob
dialog: smile the same way Doug did, and...
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BOB'S DRIVEWAY - A MINUTE LATER
text: BOB, in leather biker gear, rolls out of his garage on
text: another shimmering Harley Davidson. He looks around
text: through his mirrored aviator sunglasses like a complete
text: bad ass. He looks down the street and spots DOUG, riding
text: towards him. Bob rides down the driveway and joins
text: alongside Doug. They nod silently to each other and tap
dialog: fists like the toughest guys in the world. We see Bob is
text: also wearing a "Wild Hogs" jacket.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODY'S HOUSE - SAME TIME
text: WOODY walks through the courtyard, and into a pristine
dialog: garage.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 15.
text: He passes by a BMW 645, several stacks of labelled moving
text: boxes, and finally a beautiful Harley Davidson Softail
dialog: Anniversary Edition.
text: A MINUTE LATER, Woody pulls onto the street on his
text: Harley. DOUG and BOB turn the corner and nod to him.
text: Woody nods back, revs his engine, and joins alongside
dialog: them.
scene_heading: EXT. DUDLEY'S COMPUTER-CLUTTERED GARAGE - SAME TIME
text: We see a garage crowded with disassembled Apple
text: computers, printers, and a Harley Davidson Sportster.
text: Out walks DUDLEY, who's biker outfit doesn't quite mesh
text: with his thick-lensed eyeglasses.
text: Dudley cockily pulls on a "Wild Hogs" jacket, kick starts
text: the motorcycle, presses a button to open the garage door,
text: and rides the motorcycle out. However, as he gets
text: halfway out of the garage, the garage door catches on
text: something, and snaps back down. It clotheslines Dudley
text: off the bike, which rolls down the driveway and into some
text: garbage cans. Dudley lays in the driveway, staring up at
text: the sky with a pained look on his face.
scene_heading: EXT. DUDLEY'S DRIVEWAY - A FEW MINUTES LATER
text: DOUG, BOB and WOODY ride towards Dudley's house, but find
text: DUDLEY sitting in his driveway with his arms around his
text: knees. He shrugs and motions to his motorcycle - Which
text: he has stood back up, but has a bent wheel and smashed
text: headlight. Doug and Bob take in the situation and then
text: look at Woody. Woody rolls his eyes...
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - LATER
text: DOUG, BOB and WOODY ride along. We see DUDLEY is riding
text: bitch on Woody's bike, and Woody doesn't seem thrilled
text: about it. The camera pans around and we see they are all
dialog: wearing "Wild Hogs" jackets. And on this, we:
speaker_heading: END MUSIC CUE
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. "BYKER'S ISLAND" BIKER BAR - LATER
text: The guys pull up at a biker-theme bar with a motorcycle
text: mounted above the entrance.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 16.
text: Woody is obviously humiliated to have Dudley behind him,
text: as they park the bikes among a crowd of other bikers.
text: Dudley climbs off the back of Woody's bike and pats him
text: on the shoulder.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Thanks, Woody. I feel really safe with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: I noticed that. And if you ever lay your
dialog: head on my back when you're riding bitch
dialog: again, I'm going to throw you into
dialog: traffic.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: I was trying to keep my face out of the
dialog: wind.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: I felt you smell my hair!
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Guys! Come on. Let's go get a brew.
dialog: I'm buying.
text: Doug heads into the bar.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You're cool with the carbs?
text: Doug pauses, without turning around.
speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: (MUMBLES)
dialog: I can have a light.
text: Doug continues into the bar, but now with less swagger.
scene_heading: INT. "BYKER'S ISLAND" BIKER BAR - A MOMENT LATER
text: The guys are sitting at a worn table. The place is
text: crowded with curiously gentle-looking bikers. Woody
text: looks around the bar with a smirk.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Man, I wish we could find a place that
dialog: wasn't so freaking lame.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What are you talking about? This place
dialog: is cool. We're with other bikers.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 17.
text: Suddenly, a large, bald biker comes up and slams a beer
text: down on their table.
speaker_heading: BALD BIKER

dialog: Wild Hogs aren't welcome here!
text: The guys all look at him for a beat - then the Bald guy
text: cracks a smile.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Hey, Paul.
text: PAUL laughs at his joke.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hey, guys... Woody, your tax return is
dialog: almost done, but I want to talk to you
dialog: next week about incorporating. A lot of
dialog: my executive clients have been--
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Yeah, Paul. I'll talk to you about it on
dialog: the trip.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah, we'll talk about in Daytona.
dialog: (angrily, to group)
dialog: What the hell are you staring at!?
text: Paul glares at the other guys for a beat, then cracks up.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: See you guys.
text: Paul exits. Woody shakes his head.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: This place sucks. Why are we going to
dialog: Daytona with these posers?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Because it's Bike Week. That's our
dialog: annual trip, Woody. We're Wild Hogs.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: We're not Wild Hogs. That's a patch your
dialog: wife made and we all had to sew it on our
dialog: jackets so she didn't feel bad.

dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 18.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Hey! She took an embroidery class for
dialog: those. What has your wife ever made us?
speaker_heading: BOB
speaker_heading: (QUIETLY)
dialog: Hard.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Hey!?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Sorry. I didn't... Don't tell her.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: It's not a big secret, Bob. She's a
dialog: swimsuit model. She's hot. I mean, so
dialog: is my Kelly. She's very hot. Even after
dialog: ten years. Not that I'm not still good
dialog: looking...
text: Doug looks at the guys. They don't respond.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: We're not going to say you're hot, man.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Because it's gay, or because I'm not?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: There's no non-gay response to that.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
speaker_heading: (TO DOUG)
dialog: If I were a girl, I'd be attracted to
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Point proven.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well, Kelly must still think you're hot.
dialog: Ten years, man. How's that feel?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I don't know. Good, I guess. Is ten the
dialog: silver anniversary?
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: No, that's the 25th. Ten is aluminum.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 19.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Aluminum? Like, siding?
dialog: (considers, then)
dialog: Yeah, that feels about right. Aluminum
dialog: is sturdy, lightweight... recycled.
text: Woody smiles and puts a map down on the table.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: --And ready for the trip of a lifetime.
text: The guys look at the map, puzzled.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: We don't need a map for Daytona. We just
dialog: follow the group.
text: Woody takes a drink from his beer, then looks at the
text: group with a mischievous fire behind his eyes.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Not if we don't go on the Daytona trip.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Noooo!!
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Guys, listen to me. It's time for a
dialog: change. Let's go on our own trip this
dialog: year. Just us, like it was in college.
dialog: Forget these guys. Forget Daytona beach.
dialog: Bike Week is just corporate white guys
dialog: playing dress up. This bar is, too. And
dialog: we didn't get into this to play dress up -
dialog: we got in this to live. "Be cool and
dialog: Ride free." That's the Wild Hog creed.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: No, it's not. It's the slogan for the
text: Downtown trolley.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: I know. But, it works as our creed, too.
dialog: So let's live it!
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: But, I boogie board in Daytona. Can't
dialog: our creed be "Be cool and boogie board?"
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 20.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: No. That's dumb, Dudley. Let the big
dialog: people talk.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Well, what kind of trip are you
dialog: suggesting? Another bike week somewhere?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: No. That's the best part. We don't do
dialog: some planned out trip. We follow the
text: open road. U.S. 50. The backbone of
dialog: America. We take a week and go all the
dialog: way to San Francisco. Think about it,
dialog: guys. Camping out, stopping wherever we
dialog: want, whenever we want... Just freedom.
dialog: When was the last time we had that?
text: The guys consider this, but look sceptical.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I don't know, man.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: You're afraid to ask your wife.
speaker_heading: BOB
speaker_heading: (COVERING)
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: WOODY
speaker_heading: (TO DOUG)
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Well, Daytona isn't the "backbone of
dialog: America," but it is a tradition. We've
dialog: been riding with this club for years. Do
dialog: we really want to miss out on that?
text: One of the bikers, KENT, approaches carrying a box.
speaker_heading: KENT
dialog: Hey, dudes. Check these out.
text: Kent holds up a sleeveless t-shirt with a big cartoon guy
text: on a motorcycle - with the words "Born to Be Wild!
dialog: Daytona ride, 2005." It's horrifying.
speaker_heading: KENT (CONT'D)
dialog: We're all going to wear these on the
dialog: trip.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 21.
speaker_heading: KENT (CONT'D)
dialog: That way everyone will know we're from
dialog: the Cincinnati chapter. It'll also get
dialog: you ten percent off at T.G.I.Fridays.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Cool! Born to be wild!
text: Dudley grabs a shirt and starts to pull it over the t-
text: shirt he already has on. Woody gives a look to Bob and
dialog: Doug.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Look, We'll talk about it tomorrow. But
dialog: we don't need some trip to go "live." We
dialog: 
text: are living. Free and wild.
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DOUG'S HOUSE - THE NEXT EVENING
text: The anniversary party is in full swing. DOUG is watching
dialog: 
text: several guests dish steaming pasta and cream sauce out of
text: a chaffing dish. He looks down at his plate of field
text: greens and skinless chicken breast.
speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: (TO HIMSELF)
dialog: Free and wild.
text: Doug looks around the party. Several middle-aged couples
text: are dancing on the living room floor. Others mingle,
text: laughing... Everyone is having a great time, except Doug,
text: who stands there, listless.
text: Kelly walks up and kisses him on the cheek.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: 
dialog: Hey, sweetie. Having fun?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: 
dialog: Yeah. It's getting pretty late, though.
dialog: 
dialog: Maybe we should kill the music. Drop a
dialog: 
dialog: hint.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: 
text: It's eight O'Clock. It started at seven.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: oh.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: Still, that's late. We should just
text: flicker the lights on and off. People
dialog: will get it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 22.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: People are having fun. Look at the
dialog: Miltons.
text: ANGLE ON: THE LIVING ROOM. A happy-looking couple, THE
text: MILTONS, are dancing around to Prince's "1999." Doug
dialog: laughs.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Oh, man. There should be laws against
dialog: that... Is Fred having a seizure?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: No, Fred's having a good time. With his
dialog: wife. Remember what that was like?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Hey, we have fun all the time. But I'm
dialog: not going to let myself look like that.
text: He wears dress socks with shorts, too.
dialog: I've seen it. Do you want me to do that?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I don't care. Why do you?
text: Doug searches for a response, as ROGER, 70, Kelly's Dad,
text: clinks his wine glass at the front of the room.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Excuse me, everybody. I have a little
dialog: toast. For my daughter and her husband.
text: Roger winks at Doug and Kelly. Doug smiles weakly.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (sotto, to Kelly)
dialog: He's drunk. We should do something.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: I want to start by saying how proud I am
dialog: of my son-in-law.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (sotto, to Kelly)
dialog: --No, he's fine. Let him talk.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Now, I have to make an admission. Ten
dialog: years ago, when Doug and Kelly got
dialog: married. I was worried. Doug was a
dialog: little wild...
text: The guests laugh. Doug gives an unsure chuckle.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 23.
speaker_heading: ROGER (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, he had that old trans-am with the
dialog: huge engine... Remember how he'd peel
dialog: out of anywhere? Even the grocery
dialog: parking lot after buying baby formula?
text: The guests laugh again. Now Doug isn't.
speaker_heading: ROGER (CONT'D)
dialog: Or the way he'd just grab Kelly and run
text: off to some crazy island to snorkel with
dialog: something that thinks you're lunch.
dialog: 
text: The guests continue to laugh. Kelly looks at Doug, now.
dialog: 
text: She sees this is landing on him. He's getting upset.
speaker_heading: ROGER (CONT'D)
dialog: But, not anymore. He's now become the
dialog: son-in-law I would have always hoped for.
dialog: Responsible, reliable, and a great
dialog: husband to my daughter. So cheers to--
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: No, no. No cheers-- Because that wasn't
dialog: an accurate toast. I'm still the same,
dialog: shitty son-in-law I used to be.
dialog: 
text: The guests laugh. They think he's joking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: 
dialog: Come on, Doug. You should be proud!
dialog: 
dialog: You've grown up! Cheers!
dialog: 
text: The guests nod and clink their glasses. Doug shakes his
dialog: 
dialog: head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: 
dialog: Grown up? No, I haven't. I'm still
dialog: 
dialog: young. No cheers! Stop clinking!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: 
dialog: Doug, stop it. You're being rude.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: 
dialog: Well, tell them I'm the same as I used to
dialog: 
dialog: be, Kelly. Tell your Dad not to like me.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You're not the same, Doug. The old Doug
dialog: wouldn't have made fun of Fred Milton for
dialog: dancing, because he would have been out
dialog: there dancing himself. With me.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 24.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: So what are you saying?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I'm saying you have changed. And
dialog: frankly, i don't like it. I like you the
dialog: way you were. I liked it when you
dialog: weren't afraid of looking stupid. I
dialog: liked it when we laughed. I liked it
dialog: when we danced.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Hey, I'll dance! It's just this music is
dialog: lame. People like me need a fresh beat!
text: Doug walks over to the stereo and changes the station.
text: "Cand Sho " h y-50 Cent starts playing. Doug nods along
text: with the beat, as the guests all now stare at him.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: (yelling over music)
dialog: Awwww, yeah. This is the shit! It ain't
dialog: 1980 anymore, man. Yeah!
speaker_heading: (SINGS ALONG)
dialog: I take you to the... Andy shop--
text: Doug tries to confidently sing along, but struggles
text: awkwardly, as he's obviously never heard the song before.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (urging, to Doug)
dialog: Honey, stop it. You're being an ass.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: What!? I thought this was what you
dialog: wanted? I'm dancing!
text: Doug starts grinding and shimmying to the beat. Kelly
text: grits her teeth.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, baby! Just because we're
dialog: married ten years doesn't mea n we're old
dialog: people. Let's dance! It fee ls goooood!
text: Doug makes another spastic dance move, then suddenly
text: grimaces and grabs his chest.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: Nope, that feels bad--
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Doug? What's wrong? Are you okay?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 25.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yeah. I'm just-- Ow: That's-- Yeah, I
dialog: should go to the hospital--
text: Doug staggers across the carpet as people run to help
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Doug!?
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - AN HOUR LATER
text: Doug is in a bed, with Kelly next to him. A DOCTOR
text: enters with a chart.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Well, Mr. Matthews--
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Dr. Matthews, actually.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Oh, really? Great. Then, I can say this
dialog: a lot easier. You had a hypertensive
dialog: myocardial seizure.
text: Doug nods confidently, then, after a moment:
speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: (DEFEATED)
dialog: I'm a dentist, actually... I have no
dialog: idea what you just said.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Oh. Sorry. It looks like you had a
text: stress-induced panic attack.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Stress-induced? I'm not stressed.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Well, it's probably been pretty buried. I
dialog: actually see it a lot with middle-aged men.
dialog: Work, family, it can take a toll on you.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I'm not middle-aged.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 26.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Yeah, I see that a lot, too. Anyway. We
dialog: should have you out of here soon.
text: The doctor smiles and exits the room. Kelly looks at
dialog: Doug.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I am middle aged, aren't I?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Only mathematically.
text: Doug takes this in.
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Doug, Let me ask you a question. When
dialog: was the last time you sang a Bon Jovi
dialog: song?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You used to sing Bon Jovi songs at the
dialog: top of your lungs. Like you didn't care
dialog: who heard you, or how dopey it sounded.
dialog: 
dialog: Then one day, you just stopped. That's
dialog: 
dialog: how it's been with everything. Romance,
dialog: sense of humor, the way you used to give
dialog: me that cocky little wink when you took
dialog: 
dialog: off your shirt... It's all faded away,
dialog: 
dialog: leaving just a shell of what you used to
dialog: 
dialog: be. Why? Why no more Bon Jovi songs?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I don't know. There's just a lot
dialog: weighing me down these days, you know?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Like what? You have a great career, a
dialog: 
dialog: perfect family. Money is fine. The only
dialog: 
dialog: thing that could be weighing you down is
dialog: 
dialog: me. Is it me? Are you tired of me?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: 
dialog: No! of course, not. I could never be
speaker_heading: TIRED OF--
text: Doug stops himself, as it dawns on him. You can see the
text: horror of realization creep across his face. He looks at
text: Kelly, wide-eyed.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 27.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (REALIZING)
dialog: It's me. I'm weighing me down. I'm not
dialog: a guy I'd hang out with anymore, I'm...
dialog: Me. What's cool about me? I don't even
dialog: eat carbs.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Then eat them. I'd rather have you sing
dialog: than have a thirty-four waist.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I still have a thirty--
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: No, you don't, Doug. I buy your pants.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: Look. We've been married ten years. And
dialog: personally, I'd like to be married fifty
dialog: more, but if you stay like this...
dialog: Then... I don't know...
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: We are going to be married fifty more
dialog: years, Kelly. I'm going to find old
dialog: Doug. I just have to figure out where to
dialog: look.
text: Kelly takes a breath, and pulls out a map. She hands it
text: to Doug, who looks at it.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: Woody's map?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I took it away from him at the party. He
dialog: wouldn't stop waving it at Bob and
dialog: Dudley.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I thought you agreed it was a bad idea.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: It might be. But I'm desperate, Doug. I
dialog: want us to be happy again. So go on it.
dialog: It's my anniversary present to you.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Really?
dialog: (considers, then)
dialog: I only got you an ankle bracelet.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 28.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: All I want is old Doug back. Please.
dialog: This marriage can't survive without him.
text: Doug takes this in, and smiles at her. She's a good
text: wife, and he knows it. Suddenly, BOB enters the room.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Doug! Are you okay?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yeah, I'm okay. Just stress.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Oh, man. Thank god.
speaker_heading: KELLY
speaker_heading: (TO BOB)
dialog: Where's Karen?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Oh, she's waiting in the parking--
text: SFX: A loud honk from the parking lot.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: That's her.
text: Bob looks out the window nervously. Kelly looks at Doug.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You all need this trip.
text: Doug gives her a knowing nod, then turns to Bob.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Bob. Let's forget about Daytona Bike
dialog: week. Let's ride across U.S. 50.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yeah? Are you sure? I mean, We'll be
dialog: leaving behind everything we're used to.
text: SFX: The horn honks again from outside.
speaker_heading: KAREN (O.C.)
dialog: (yelling from parking lot)
dialog: Bob!? You said two minutes! I'm not
dialog: circling!!
text: Bob cringes. Doug shares a look with Kelly, then to Bob:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 29.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yeah. I think that might be okay.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - THE NEXT WEEK
text: DOUG is riding his Harley, which is loaded with gear
dialog: (sleeping bag, spare gas tank, saddle bags). He
text: approaches a freeway entrance ramp, where WOODY and
text: DUDLEY and BOB are waiting on their bikes, next to an
text: entrance ramp sign that reads: U.S. Highway 50. The guys
text: all tap fists, then notice Dudley is grinning ear to ear.
speaker_heading: WOODY
speaker_heading: (TO DUDLEY)
dialog: What? What's wrong with you?
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: I got a tat.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: A tattoo? You got a tattoo?
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: I'm a biker, dude! I got a tat!
text: Dudley yanks his jacket down to his elbows and we see he
text: is wearing a sleeveless shirt underneath. On his bicep
text: is a tattoo of the Macintosh Apple. The guys nod, trying
text: to look impressed.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Wow. That's...
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Trademarked, I know. But what are they
dialog: going to do? It's in my skin, bitch!
text: Dudley laughs and pulls on his jacket, as Woody ties a
text: bandana skull-cap on his head. The guys look at Woody.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: You're not wearing a helmet?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Nape. I don't want anything between me
dialog: and the road, man.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: You will if your head falls on it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 30.
text: Woody shrugs and starts his bike.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Look, the only rule on this trip is to
dialog: have no plan. We're riding to San
text: Francisco, and nothing else is planned.
dialog: Just riding free.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Well, if we're going to make it in five
dialog: days, we'll should probably get to
dialog: Illinois by tonight.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yeah, the way I mapped it out - we should
dialog: be a hundred miles past St. Louis by
dialog: sundown.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: What? No. No plan. It's the open road.
dialog: Who knows where we'll be.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I do. I have this little GPS system.
text: Doug shows them a handheld GPS system. Woody grabs it
text: and throws it into a storm drain.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey! What the hell, man? That was
dialog: expensive!
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: I did it for the good of the trip, Doug.
dialog: You don't need GPS to discover America.
dialog: We just need the wind, our bikes, and
dialog: freedom. And if we have an emergency, I
dialog: always have a cell phone--
text: Woody takes out a cellphone. Doug grabs it and throws it
text: in the storm drain.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Hah! How's that feel?
text: Woody gives Doug a long look, then slowly smiles.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: It felt good. It felt damn good.
speaker_heading: (ANNOUNCES)
dialog: No cell phones!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 31.
speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: (WORRIED)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: He's right, Doug. Wild Hogs!
text: Bob takes his cellphone and throws it in the storm drain.
speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: (TO BOB)
dialog: You just did that so Karen wouldn't call.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yup.
text: Bob starts his bike.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: So we're not even going to talk about
dialog: this? I mean, shouldn't we at least--
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Yeeeeaaah! Freedom!!
text: Dudley throws his cellphone, but instead of going into
text: the storm drain, it goes flying into traffic and smashes
text: against an oncoming pickup truck. We hear the truck
text: screech to a stop after it passes them.
speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: (QUICKLY)
dialog: Okay, let's ride!
text: The guys all hastily start their bikes and take off up
text: the freeway ramp. We hear the truck driver screaming
text: profanities as they guiltily ride away.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATER THAT DAY
scene_heading: MUSIC CUE: BLUE OYSTER CULT's "(DON'T FEAR) THE REAPER."
text: The four guys ride along the highway, through the hills
text: of Indiana, smiling and nodding to each other. It's the
text: Easy Rider moment. The camera ROTATES AROUND and PULLS
text: OVERHEAD. It's beautiful country and the guys are in
text: heaven. Dudley wears a clunky helmet from the eighties,
text: as well as World War II motorcycle goggles.

dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 32.
text: A family in a station wagon pulls up to next to them.
text: Two kids press their faces against the windows, looking
text: at the bikers in awe. Bob looks over at the kids in his
text: mirrored sunglasses and gives them a badass nod. The
text: kids are amazed. Bob looks to Doug. Doug grins. They
text: love this. Bob gives a signal to the other guys and guns
text: his engine. The others nod, gun their engines and speed
text: away from the station wagon. The kids watch with their
text: mouths open.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATER THAT AFTERNOON
text: The guys are cruising along as before, but now we see the
text: sky has gotten very cloudy and overcast.
scene_heading: SFX: THUNDER CRACK
text: The guys look up at the sky apprehensively.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - A FEW MINUTES LATER
text: It's now pouring rain. The guys ride along in misery,
text: getting soaked. After a moment, the station wagon from

speaker_heading: END MUSIC CUE
scene_heading: EXT. ROADSIDE US-50 - THAT EVENING

dialog: Why didn't you just bring a sleeping bag

text: Bob continues to inflate the mattress, as Dudley
text: approaches with a knotted plastic grocery bag.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: This is poop. Don't eat it.
text: Dudley sets the bag aside and has a seat by the fire.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Dudley? You're supposed to bury that.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Yes. Go bury it.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: It's in a plastic bag. I can't put that
dialog: in the earth. I'll find a trash bin
dialog: tomorrow.
text: The guys shake their heads and look back into the fire.
text: After a moment, Doug smiles.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: This is really nice, you know? Chilling
dialog: by the fire with your best friends. Just
dialog: relaxing, and enjoying--
speaker_heading: WOODY
speaker_heading: (TO DUDLEY)
dialog: I'm sorry. Dudley, you have to get rid
dialog: of that bag or I'm going to vomit in your
dialog: lap.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: --each other's company...
text: Dudley grabs the bag and heads off.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Fine. I'll just hang it on a tree.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: (yells after him)
dialog: Don't hang it on a tree!
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yup... These are the times we'll
dialog: remember.
text: After a minute, Doug turns to Woody and Bob.

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 34.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, when was the last time you guys
dialog: heard me sing Bon Jovi?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Oh, man. Thank God that stopped.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: It's been awhile. You're not as
dialog: obnoxious as you used to be. You used to
dialog: eat a lot more buffalo wings, too.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yeah, I know. Turns out there's carbs in
dialog: the batter. Hey, you know what? Maybe
dialog: carbs are what I need to get old Doug
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Old Doug? You've lost your Dad?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: No. I think I've lost me. It's this
dialog: thing Kelly said.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: You know what it is? I think I'm tame.
dialog: I'm like a lion that used to be wild, but
dialog: now I'm in some Disney park where tourists
dialog: come by and take pictures of me like I'm a
dialog: lion, but after they leave, I go into my
text: kennel and eat antelope nuggets or
dialog: something. Ones without carbs.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I know what you're talking about. I
dialog: lost old Bob, too. I think my wife and
dialog: daughters killed him. I'm surrounded by
dialog: women every minute of my life. And it's
dialog: made me, you know...
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: A wimp?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What? No. I was going to say miserable.
dialog: You think I'm a wimp?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: No. I just thought that was what you
dialog: were... I thought you wanted us to
dialog: guess, and I didn't have a guess, so I
dialog: said "wimp." Knowing it was wrong...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 35.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: You're a wimp, Bob. I'll say it. You're
dialog: afraid of girls. It's embarrassing.
text: Dudley comes up and sits back down.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: I'm afraid of girls.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: You're afraid to talk to one. Bob is
text: afraid they'll kill him in his sleep.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Wow. Now I really don't want to talk to
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You know, it's not always so bad. Like,
text: when Karen sleeps, she still crawls over
text: and pushes up against me. Just snuggles
dialog: right up like she needs me. I like that.
dialog: I like that a lot.
dialog: (then, sobering)
text: Then the sun comes up and turns her into
text: a raging she-demon.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yeah, I guess life just isn't as simple
dialog: as it was when we were in college. Well,
dialog: except for you, Woody. You're still
dialog: living the fairy tale. Swimsuit model
dialog: wife. Big job at an investment firm.
dialog: You've got the good life.
text: Woody doesn't respond. He just stares vacantly into the
text: fire for a beat.
speaker_heading: WOODY
speaker_heading: (FLATLY)
dialog: Yeah... The good life. I'm a lucky man.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: My life blows. I don't have a family.
dialog: Or a wife. I have a cat that doesn't
dialog: like me. She wouldn't even stick around
dialog: if she knew how to use a can opener.
text: The guys all look at Dudley.
speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Nah, I don't like those places--
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Dudley-- Please. I'm trying to help you
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: I know. I just don't--
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Please! Strippers are nice to me!
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Okay... Sorry. We'll go.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Thanks, man.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: I'm just... trying to be a good friend.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: We know, Bob.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: I'll go, too.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: There's a surprise.
text: Doug pulls a flaming marshmallow out of the fire.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: All right, who wants their marshmallow
dialog: well-done?
text: The guys just look at it.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah, I left that one on too long.
text: Doug flips the stick and the marshmallow goes flying
text: behind him. The guys don't notice - but we see the
text: marshmallow land on the tent and continue to burn. Bob
text: continues to huff on the air mattress. He stops and
text: looks at it.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (out of breath)
dialog: I think I'm half way there.

speaker_heading: WOODY
text: In just one hour.
speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: (TO BOB)
dialog: You sure you don't want us to spread out
dialog: a sleeping bag? We have three in the--
text: Doug turns around and sees a foot-wide flame now burning
text: on the tent.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit! The tent--
text: Doug and the guys jump up and hurry over to the tent.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: Dudley, get the water jug off my bike!
text: Dudley hurries over to Doug's bike as Doug and Bob try to
text: smother the flame with sand.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: It should be okay. It's fire retardant.
text: The guys try and extinguish the flame as Dudley comes
text: running with a jug. He quickly takes off the cap. Doug
text: notices him.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: Dudley, no! That's
text: It's too late. Dudley is already throwing it on the
text: fire. The liquid hits the tent and it explodes into
text: flames. The guys shield themselves.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: Gas! That's the spare gas tank, Dudley!
text: Dudley doesn't know what to say. The fire quickly
text: disentergrates the tent. Doug, Bob and Woody just watch,
text: knowing there's nothing they can do. After a moment,
text: DUDLEY runs back up with the correct water jug and
text: empties it on what is now a flaming pile of ash. It does
dialog: nothing.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: We need more water.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: That was all of it, Dudley. That was all
dialog: the water we had.

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 38.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Oh.

speaker_heading: DUDLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Is anybody else thirsty?
text: The guys just look at him.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ROADSIDE US-50 -- THE NEXT MORNING
text: BOB, DOUG, WOODY and DUDLEY are all sleeping on Bob's air
text: mattress, like four sardines. Doug opens his eyes to see
text: a large figure standing at the foot of the air mattress.
text: It's a stern-looking highway patrolman.
scene_heading: HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
dialog: You guys all right?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yeah. Yeah, just on a road trip.
scene_heading: HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
dialog: All right. Just making sure.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Looks pretty comfortable, actually.
text: We see the highway patrolman has started rubbing his
text: thigh. Doug quickly jumps up, waking the others.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Okay, well... Thanks for stopping. Have
dialog: a nice day, officer.
text: The highway patrolman laughs.
scene_heading: HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
dialog: All right, I get it.
speaker_heading: (WINKS)
text: Five's a crowd.
text: Doug is mortified. The officer looks them over for a
dialog: moment.
speaker_heading: HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You guys are lucky to have each other.
dialog: (looks at them hungrily)
dialog: Damn lucky.

speaker_heading: DUDLEY
speaker_heading: (OBLIVIOUS)
dialog: That's what I always say.
text: Dudley gets up and puts his arm around Doug. We see he's
text: wearing a saggy pair of briefs and nothing else.
scene_heading: HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
dialog: Well... Have a good one.
text: The patrolman walks off. Dudley looks at Doug and grins.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Morning.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Please put your pants on.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATER THAT AFTERNOON
text: The guys cruise through the rolling prairies of Missouri.
text: It's another beautiful day. They ride in formation,
text: until Woody's bandana doo-rag blows off. Woody goes back
text: to get it. The other guys stop and wait for him to
dialog: return.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATER
text: The guys are still riding - but now the heat of the
text: Missouri plains is taking it's toll. They look boiling,
text: and have sweated through their clothes. Bob takes a
text: drink of water from a bottle of water, then pours the
text: water over his head. He breathes a sigh of relief, until
text: he hears an angry yell behind him. He looks back and
text: sees Woody is now drenched from the water. Bob smiles
text: sheepishly as Woody burns.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATER THAT DAY
text: The guys ride through the forested Ozark uplands, looking
text: even hotter than before. Doug spots a waterfall pouring
text: into a crystal clear spring, and points to it. The guys
dialog: nod in agreement.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: EXT. BLANCHARD SPRINGS, OZARK NATIONAL FOREST - LATER
text: DOUG, WOODY, and DUDLEY wade into the spring water in
text: their boxers. You can see on their faces that it's like
text: dipping into heaven. After a moment, BOB walks up.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Thanks for waiting for me, jerks.
text: The guys look up to see that Bob is naked. He smiles and
text: cannonballs into the water.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Whhheew: Yeah! That's c-c-cold:
text: He sees DOUG, WOODY and DUDLEY are just staring at him.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Why are you naked?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: We're swimming. You guys kept on your
dialog: skivies?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Skivies? What are you, a Newsie?
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: I kept mine on because I didn't want
dialog: everyone to see my crank.
speaker_heading: WOODY
speaker_heading: (TO BOB)
dialog: Yeah. That, and being naked with a bunch
dialog: of guys is gay. What's wrong with you?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I don't know. We took showers and stuff
dialog: together in college. I thought this was
dialog: kind of... you know, the same.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I guess I get that.
speaker_heading: (THINKS)
dialog: I mean, we would have been naked in
dialog: college. Why are we... Oh, man. It's
dialog: true. We are tamed. We're old guys.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 41.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: No, we're not. Don't say that.
text: Doug wiggles his boxers off and holds them in the air.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I will find old Doug!
text: Doug smiles and throws his shorts on the shore. Dudley
text: smiles, takes off his briefs and holds them up.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: I will... Do what Doug does!
text: Dudley throws the briefs to shore. They all look at
text: Woody. He rolls his eyes and takes off his boxers.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: I will be naked with my gay friends, and
dialog: if they look at my jock, I will kill
dialog: them.
text: Woody throws the boxers to shore. The guys all look at
text: each other and smile. It's a nice moment.
text: Until a family approaches.
text: Doug looks at the other guys, wide-eyed, as a family with
text: three young kids walks up with a picnic basket. The
text: young kids run and jump into the water. The Dad of the
text: family laughs and shakes his head.
speaker_heading: FAMILY DAD
dialog: Hope you guys don't mind a little
text: company. The mini-van was getting a
speaker_heading: LITTLE--
text: The Dad stops talking as he sees into the water... He
text: realizes, then looks at his kids, concerned.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Um... Well, we're just taking a dip. I
speaker_heading: UH--
speaker_heading: WOODY
text: There's a shallower spring up the path.
dialog: The kids might like that even more...
text: The Mom lays down a blanket and turns to the guys. The
text: Dad is still staring, not sure what to do.

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 42.
speaker_heading: FAMILY MOM
speaker_heading: (TO WOODY)
dialog: Oh, no. These little squirts like to
speaker_heading: DIVE AND--
text: The Mom sees a glimmer of something through the water,
text: and realizes. She suddenly looks very uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: FAMILY MOM (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (VERY TENSE)
text: Janey, Kyle, Holland. Out of the water.
dialog: We're going to find a new spot.
speaker_heading: JANEY
dialog: No, Mama. This place has little rocks
speaker_heading: THAT--
speaker_heading: FAMILY MOM
dialog: Get out of the damn water! Now!
text: The kids climb out of the water and the parents hurry off
text: with them down the path. After a moment of awkward
text: silence, Doug looks at the guys.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: We should go.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You think? They're gone, now.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Yeah, we could stay another few--
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.C.)
dialog: Whhheeeeew!
text: The guys look to the other side of the spring to see the
text: HIGHWAY PATROLMAN cannonball naked into the spring. They
text: stare, horrified, as he pops up and smiles at them.
scene_heading: HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
dialog: Saw you're bikes out there. You guys
dialog: ever chicken fight?
text: The guys look at each other for a moment, then;
scene_heading: DOUG/BOB/WOODY/DUDLEY
dialog: Ahhhh! / Oh, god! / Run!

scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATE THAT AFTERNOON
text: The guys are back on their bikes, cruising along the
dialog: wheat fields of Kansas. They're looking tired once
text: again, but suddenly Doug smiles...
text: On the horizon, a bar comes into view. Out front are
text: several rows of Harley Davidsons. Doug points it out to
text: the guys and they all smile. It's like an oasis.
text: The pull into the parking lot and climb off their bikes.
text: Bob immediately falls to the ground.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Dammit! Leg's asleep.
text: The guys go to help Bob up, as Dudley gets off his bike
text: and falls to the ground.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Me, too.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: You guys have to shift every once in
text: awhile. Blood has to circulate.
text: A MOMENT LATER. Dudley and Bob are up and wiggling their
text: sleeping limbs, as Woody looks up at the bar.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Now this is the best part of any road
dialog: trip. Seeing our brothers on wheels.
dialog: Look at this place. America!
text: The guys look at it and nod. It is a cool looking shack
text: of a bar. Doug admires the row of motorcycles out front.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Look at these bikes. They're all
dialog: classics.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Oh, man. Check it out. A 1951 Panhead.
dialog: You know how rare this thing is?
text: The guys all crowd around the bike.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yeah, but why didn't he customize it?
dialog: You have a 51 panhead and you don't
dialog: chrome out the exhaust? Or airbrush an
dialog: eagle on the gas tank? What a waste.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 44.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Probably no good custom stores out here
dialog: in hick-land. We'll leave 'em a catalog.
text: The guys push open the door and step into the bar.
scene_heading: INT. BIKER BAR - CONTINUOUS
dialog: The bar is full of bikers, but not the kind we saw
text: before. These guys are greasy, tattooed and menacing.
text: We see their jackets say "Hells Angels." The bikers turn
text: and stare at WOODY, DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY.
speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: (TO BIKERS)
dialog: How's it going?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Hells Angels, huh? You guys are legends.
dialog: I'm surprised we've never seen you in
dialog: Daytona.
text: The bikers kind of chuckle to themselves. The leader of
text: the gang, JACK, steps forward. He's in his late 40's -
text: and looks like he could break you into bite size pieces.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah, how do we keep missing that?
text: The bikers all laugh. Doug and the guys join in, though
text: they don't quite get what's so funny.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: So you re "Wild Hogs," huh? That's your
dialog: gang?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Well, not a gang. Just friends. Friends
dialog: that ride... you know.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: So it's like a little hobby for you guys?
dialog: How sweet.
text: Doug smiles, but is now sensing the hostility. He looks
text: back for the exit.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
speaker_heading: (TO JACK)
dialog: Yeah, just a little hobby for us.

speaker_heading: DUDLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: We're all successful professionals in
dialog: real life. But on Tuesday and Sunday
dialog: afternoons... We're bikers!
text: Dudley spins around and shows them the back of his
dialog: jacket.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Wow. That's great. Can I try that on?
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Hell yeah, brother.
text: Dudley whips his jacket off and hands it to Jack, who
text: pulls it on his massive frame. He shows it to the gang,
text: who laugh again. Dudley does, too.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: So who's '51 panhead is that? Sweet
dialog: ride. Woody has a catalog so you can
dialog: make it cool.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: No, I don't. Doug does. I think it's
dialog: great the way it is.
text: Doug glares at Woody incredulously. Woody shrugs.
speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: (TO DUDLEY)
dialog: Well, if you like my '51, we should
dialog: trade... "brother."
speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: DUDLEY--
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
speaker_heading: (IGNORING DOUG)
dialog: I wish! I just have a Sportster. It's
dialog: worth, like, half of yours.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: A Sportster!? That's what I grew up on.
dialog: I've been wanting another Sportster.
dialog: It's a deal!
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Seriously? You're serious!?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Dudley, maybe you should--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 46.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Doug, don't worry. Yeah, I'll have a
dialog: cooler bike than you, but that doesn't
dialog: mean I'll get all cocky.
speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: DUDLEY--
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Hey, I don't care what you say! I ride a
dialog: panhead now! I'm better than you!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Come on, Dud. Let's go see how you look
text: on it.
text: Jack smiles and leads Dudley outside. Doug, Bob and
text: Woody share an uncertain look.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Anybody else got that "pre-rape" feeling?
scene_heading: EXT. BIKER BAR - CONTINUOUS
text: Everyone is standing out front. Dudley starts to get on
text: the classic motorcycle. Jack stops him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, no, no. That's Oilcan's ride. My
dialog: ' 51 panhead is right over there.
text: Jack points to a pile of abandoned rusty motorcycles.
text: Among it is the junked carcass of a '51 panhead next to
text: an old, rusty sidecar. Dudley looks confused.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: That? That's a piece of junk.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yup. Your piece of junk.
text: Woody, Doug and Bob look at each other. This isn't good.
text: Doug tries to laugh it off.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: All right, guys. We get the joke... Good
dialog: one. Anyway, we actually should get
text: moving along.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 47.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, it's no joke. You want to know the
dialog: joke? Suburban assholes that buy leather
dialog: outfits and think they're bikers. And
dialog: it's a joke I'm damn sick of. So I'm
dialog: keeping your friend's bike, I'm keeping
dialog: this jacket, and you guys are going to
dialog: turn the hell around and go back to
dialog: wherever you came from, because the next
dialog: hundred miles of this highway belongs to
dialog: the Hells Angels.
text: The color drains from the Wild Hog's faces.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Like an adopt a highway thing?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Like a "Go home or we're going to split
dialog: your skulls open" thing.
text: Bob makes an audible whimper. Doug elbows him, and tries
dialog: to look brave.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: All right. We respect that this is your
dialog: turf, and we're sorry for bothering you.
dialog: But we can't head back without my
dialog: friend's bike. So clearly we're going to
dialog: have to work something out here.
text: Jack looks back at the Hells Angels and nods.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're right. We're going to have to
dialog: work something out.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATER
text: We see DOUG, BOB and WOODY riding away from the bar,
text: looking very glum. The camera PULLS OUT to reveal the
text: rusty sidecar is now attached to Woody's bike. DUDLEY
text: sits in it looking miserable and cold (having lost his
text: jacket and now in his sleeveless shirt).
text: The guys get a good distance away from the bar and Woody
text: waves for them to stop. They do and Woody looks back to
dialog: the bar.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 48.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: All right. Let's just give them a few
dialog: minutes to get back inside - then shoot
text: right past them.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What? Are you nuts?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: The trip's over, Woody. Let's just head
dialog: back home.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: We're going to turn back after all these
dialog: miles? Just because some fat bully's
dialog: pushed us around?
speaker_heading: DOUG BOB
dialog: Yes. Yes.
text: Woody shakes his head and looks at Dudley.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: I go wherever you go.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Good. See? Dudley's got some balls.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: No, my sidecar's just attached to your
dialog: bike. I'd prefer to turn back, but I
dialog: could only roll so far...
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: I can't believe you guys. What a bunch
dialog: of pussies. The whole point of this trip
dialog: is to live, man.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: That's the point, Woody. Our lives
dialog: aren't on this highway. They're back
dialog: home. We have families, jobs, wives...
dialog: or cats... We're not going to piss off a
dialog: biker gang. We're going back.
text: Woody takes this in, gritting his teeth in disappointment.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, Woody. You don't want to take
dialog: this risk. You have Claudia, and your
dialog: job... You have a great life back home.

text: Woody looks up at him. Something about this has sparked
text: something in Woody's eyes, but he covers it up with a
text: calm smile.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: You're right, I do. But maybe I should
dialog: talk to those guys one more time. I
dialog: mean, I'm an executive at an Investment
dialog: firm. I've made a career out of
dialog: convincing people and these are just
dialog: people. You guys wait here.
text: Woody starts up his bike. Doug and Bob look at each
text: other and shrug. Dudley hurries out of the sidecar.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: I'll wait here, too. You'll get better
dialog: gas mileage.
text: Dudley gets out and falls to the ground.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY (CONT'D)
text: Leg's asleep.
text: Woody shakes his head and starts back to the bar.
scene_heading: EXT. BIKER BAR - SAME TIME
text: Woody rides up to the bar, and looks back to make sure
text: he's out of Doug, Bob and Dudley's sight. He sees that
text: he is, and kneels next to the line of Hells Angels
text: motorcycles. He takes out an army knife, and slices
text: through one of the motorcycle's gas line. Gas starts
text: leaking out onto the ground and Woody nods.
speaker_heading: WOODY
speaker_heading: (TO HIMSELF)
dialog: Come after us now, assholes.
text: Woody goes along to each bike, smiling with a weird
text: recklessness as he slices through each gas line.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - A FEW MINUTES LATER
text: WOODY pulls up on his bike, where DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY
dialog: are waiting.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: They're cool with it. We can press on.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 50.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Seriously?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Yup. I tried to be polite. I tried to
dialog: reason. I told them Dudley was dying.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Well, technically we're all dying,
text: Dudley. Just very slowly.
text: Dudley looks concerned.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Oh my god, you're right.
speaker_heading: (REALIZING)
dialog: I'm slowly dying.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Anyway, none of that worked. So I laid
dialog: it out for them. I said, "Hey, go ahead
dialog: and assault us. Because we might be not
dialog: be real bikers, but we know real lawyers.
dialog: And the moment you touch us is the moment
dialog: you get your ass sued. Because this is
dialog: the real world - with real laws, and real
dialog: consequences." And they backed down.
text: The guys are impressed.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: You really said that?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Yup. And I think they'll give us
dialog: Dudley's bike on the way back, so let's
dialog: go. Quick. Before they change their
dialog: mind.
text: Woody quickly starts his bike and rides on. The guys
text: shrug, impressed, and follow him.
text: After a moment, we see them all speed by the bar.
scene_heading: INT. BIKER BAR - SAME TIME
text: Jack is playing darts with the other bikers. He goes to
text: throw a dart and hears engines roar past the bar outside.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 51.
text: He quickly turns, which makes the dart he was throwing
text: fly off target and stick into the shoulder of one of the
speaker_heading: bikers, (OILCAN).
speaker_heading: OILCAN
dialog: Ow! Shit, man!
text: Jack listens as the engines pass the bar and fade away.
text: Jack shakes his head, enraged.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Saddle up, boys. Somebody doesn't listen.
text: The guys nod and head outside. Oilcan pulls the dart out
text: of his shoulder, and stops by Jack on the way out.
speaker_heading: OILCAN
dialog: Try and watch the throws, okay Jack?
text: Jack glares at oilcan for a beat, then jabs a dart into
text: his peck.
speaker_heading: OILCAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Owww! Jesus!
dialog: (off Jack's icy glare)
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BIKER BAR - A MINUTE LATER
text: The Hells Angels roar away from the bar on their
text: motorcycles. They get to the end of the driveway, and
text: the bikes sputter and choke to a stop.
text: ANGLE ON: JACK. He's on his hog, with a cigarette
text: dangling out of his mouth. He looks down in confusion at
text: the suddenly stalled bike.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What the f--
dialog: (sees cut gas line)
dialog: You've gotta be kidding me.
text: Suddenly, the cigarette falls out of Jacks mouth, and
text: onto the ground. A puddle of gas from the sliced line
text: catches on fire.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: shit.
text: The flames quickly follow the line of leaked gas like a
text: fuse, back towards the bar.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 52.
text: Almost as quickly as the bikers can turn to look, the
text: flame has reached the parking area and ignited all the
text: puddles of gas. They all watch in horror as the fire
text: ravenously engulfs the old wooden porch of the bar, then
dialog: the roof ...
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - SAME TIME
text: The guys happily cruise along the highway. We see WOODY
text: look in his side-view mirror and notice a large, black
text: plume of smoke back in the distance. A look of worry
text: creeps over his face.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL - THAT EVENING
text: The guys pull up to a small motel, as the sun sets behind
dialog: the wheat fields of Kansas.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: No, we're not stopping here. Riding at
dialog: night is half the fun. Let's just keep--
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: --I can't feel my nuts, Woody. And Kelly
dialog: still wants another kid.
text: DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY head inside the motel office.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: (calling after Doug)
dialog: So, adopt a kid. You already have two
dialog: white ones, anyway.
text: The guys ignore him. Woody looks back down the highway
text: uneasily, then heads inside the motel office.
scene_heading: EXT. BIKER BAR - SAME TIME
text: JACK, and the other bikers stand by the smoldering pile
text: of wood that was once their bar. OILCAN approaches Jack.
speaker_heading: OILCAN
dialog: I got my old lady bringing some gas. We
text: can get moving by nightfall.
speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: (BOILING)
dialog: Forget it. Those guys are long gone.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME
text: DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY are in their motel room. WOODY
text: stands at the window, nervously looking outside.
speaker_heading: WOODY
speaker_heading: (TO GUYS)
dialog: I just think it's just stupid to stop
dialog: this soon, you know?... We can keep
text: riding under the stars. All night.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Woody, your headlight doesn't even work.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: You think I won't ride without light? I
dialog: can feel the road. Let's go. I'll even
dialog: race somebody. Who's racing me?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Did you inhale exhaust fumes? Because
dialog: something is happening to your brain. I
dialog: think it might be retardation.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: I just want to ride. Let's go!
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Whatever, Corky.
text: Doug shrugs Woody off and dials his cell phone.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Hey, honey. It's me.
text: Woody glares at Doug.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: You're calling Kelly? You're not aloud
dialog: to call wives on a road trip.
speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: (TO WOODY)
dialog: I can call my wife whenever I want.
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Yeah. Woody. Good guess...
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 54.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah, I'm having a great time. No old
dialog: Doug, yet, but I haven't gotten sun-
dialog: burned...
text: Woody looks at Bob.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: You agree with me, right?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yeah, I actually agree with you on this
dialog: one. Let's not call wives.
speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Yeah, Bob agreed with him. Good guess
dialog: again. Man, I really miss you.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Are you kidding me? I have to leave.
dialog: Let me know when lame hour is over.
speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: (TO WOODY)
dialog: Woody, you can call Claudia when I'm
dialog: done, if you want. You can use my cell.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: No, I'm not calling Claudia. I mean, yes
dialog: I want to, but I won't. Because I'm on a
dialog: road trip with my pals. And cell phones
dialog: aren't even allowed!
text: Woody storms out. Doug hears something on the phone, and
text: lights up.
speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Hey, Billy! How's it--
dialog: (then, into phone)
dialog: Where'd he go?... Oh. He thought you
dialog: were ordering pizza. Uh huh. Well, tell
dialog: him I said hi.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - THE NEXT MORNING
text: DOUG, BOB, WOODY and DUDLEY ride along the highway, as
text: the sun burns the morning fog off of the wheat fields.
text: Doug looks over to Woody and yells above the motorcycle
dialog: engines.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 55.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I can't believe you made us leave so
dialog: early. You really wanted to see the sun
dialog: rise?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Yeah, man. It warms my heart, with
dialog: it's...
speaker_heading: (THINKS)
dialog: Gentle... rays.
text: Doug gives him a curious look, as they pass a sign that
dialog: says "Lucas, Kansas. Population: 436"
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (yelling over engines)
dialog: Hey! Let's stop for breakfast, I'm
dialog: starving.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: What!? No! We're not hungry yet.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I just said I was--
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: You're not! Fatty!
text: Bob looks hurt. Doug gives Woody a stern look.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Come on, Woody. It looks like a neat
dialog: town. And Dudley's got another bag of
text: poop to throw away.
text: Dudley nods. Woody grits his teeth as they enter the
text: town. It's a quiet, one stop-light town - with an old
text: fashioned main street and town square. We see a banner
text: over the street advertising a block party that night.
dialog: It's a postcard version of small town America.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN STREET DINER - SAME TIME
text: The owner, BUD, is pressed up against the glass -
text: watching the motorcycles come down Main street. He
text: shakes his head.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Oh, don't tell me they're here again
dialog: already. I just got the window replaced.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 56.
text: Bud walks back to the bar, past his daughter (and diner
dialog: waitress) MAGGIE, 28, pretty in that cute, small town
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Just stay calm, Dad. At least it's not
dialog: all of them, this time.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET DINER - SAME TIME
text: The guys pull up to the diner and we see the local
text: pedestrians hustle away. The street is soon deserted,
text: but the guys don't notice.
text: They go to park their bikes, but there's not enough
text: space. There's a police car in the parking spot next to
text: them, and the town sheriff, CHARLEY, comes running
text: towards it from across the street.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: I'll move it! Hold on, I'll move it!
text: Charley jumps into the car and backs it out of its spot.
text: The guys look at each other, surprised.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Wow. Lucas is a polite town.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: That's how these little towns are. It's
dialog: unspoiled America.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: It's a shithole. Let's keep moving.
text: The guys ignore Woody and enter the diner.
speaker_heading: WOODY (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, we'll get it to go, then. We can
dialog: ride and eat if it's wrapped in a
text: tortilla.
text: Woody gets no response. He looks back down the road,
text: uneasily, then follows the guys in.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN STREET DINER - SAME TIME
text: BOB, DOUG, WOODY and DUDLEY enter, with their motorcycle
text: boots thunking on the wood floor, announcing to the
text: entire diner that there are bikers there.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 57
text: Everyone freezes and the place goes silent. The only
text: sound is a single fork dropping onto a plate.
text: BUD is pulsing with anger, but he swallows it down.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Good morning, gentleman. How nice of you
dialog: to join us this afternoon.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: well, how could we pass through this town
dialog: without stopping? Everything looks so
dialog: perfect.
speaker_heading: BUD
speaker_heading: (SEETHING)
dialog: But you'll change that, huh?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Excuse me?
text: MAGGIE runs up and guides her Dad away from the guys.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I'll take care of them, Daddy.
dialog: (to guys, extra polite)
dialog: Good morning.
text: Maggie smiles. She has a radiant sweetness, even though
text: she's scared to death.
text: DUDLEY stares at her, captivated. He's in love.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: where would you gentleman like to sit?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Are there any booths open?
text: All the people quickly jump out of their booths.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Wow. Everyone is so nice, here.
text: The guys sit in one of the booths. Dudley hangs back,
text: and struggles to talk to Maggie.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
speaker_heading: (TO MAGGIE)
dialog: Um... So?
text: Dudley tries to think of something else to say, but
text: can't. He nods awkwardly, then heads over to the booth.
text: He sits down with the guys.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 58.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO GUYS)
dialog: She's perfect.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: You like the waitress, huh?
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: I wanted to say something funny to her,
dialog: but I could only think of black jokes.
text: Maggie, still very skittish, approaches the table.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: And what would you gentleman like today?
text: Doug looks to the next table, where a man is enjoying
text: french toast.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Mmmm. I'll have what he's having.
text: Maggie nods obediently and takes the man's plate. She
text: slides it in front of Doug.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: No, uh... I'll take a new one. He can
dialog: keep his.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Of course. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
text: Maggie quickly puts it back on the man's table.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Hey, it's okay. Really.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Not a big deal.
speaker_heading: BOB
speaker_heading: (FAKING ANGRY)
dialog: Yeah, just don't let it happen again!
text: Bob hammers his fist on the table and laughs at his joke,
text: but Maggie starts to cry. The guys suddenly look
text: confused as she runs to the kitchen in tears. Bob looks
text: back to the guys.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Wow. That wasn't funny.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 59.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: It's hard to be funny without being
dialog: racist.
text: Doug is looking at the town's local paper, and smiles.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Hey, guys. This block party tonight
text: looks cool. Music, grilled corn, dollar
dialog: beers, funnel cakes.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Funnel cakes!? Let's stay here tonight!
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: No, no, no, no. We have a schedule. San
text: Francisco is waiting.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What schedule? You said we're taking
dialog: this trip to live. Let's stick around
dialog: and live a little. Have some small town
dialog: fun!
text: Woody goes to protest again, but Dudley stands up.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
speaker_heading: (LOUDLY)
dialog: Let's party all night in Lucas!
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: (O.C. From kitchen area)
dialog: God Dammit! What'd we do to deserve
dialog: this!?
text: We ANGLE TO SEE: MAGGIE rush over to calm BUD down. Bud
text: calms down, then hears another motorcycle engine roaring
text: down the street. He looks out the window and shakes his
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: BUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Not another one of these assholes.
text: A moment later, MURDOCK, a fat, grungy Hells Angel,
text: enters the diner with a cocky swagger and has a seat at
dialog: the bar.
speaker_heading: MURDOCK
speaker_heading: (TO BUD)
dialog: Get me a beer, old man. And if it's not
dialog: good, I'm going to smash it across your
dialog: face.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 60.
text: ANGLE ON: The WILD HOGS, watching from the table behind
dialog: Murdock.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (sotto, to the guys)
dialog: Not another one of these assholes.
text: Murdock hears this and whips around to see the Wild Hogs.
speaker_heading: MURDOCK
dialog: What'd you say?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Oh, I was actually referring to some guys
dialog: we met at a bar about two hundred miles
dialog: east of here. You're probably not
speaker_heading: AFFILIATED--
speaker_heading: MURDOCK
dialog: That's my gang. I'm on my way there now.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: (loudly, to Doug)
dialog: so he is one of those assholes, Doug.
speaker_heading: MURDOCK
dialog: Excuse me?
text: Murdock puts his beer down, and stares angrily at Doug.
speaker_heading: MURDOCK (CONT'D)
dialog: And who the hell are you freaks?
text: Doug starts to answer, but Woody, looking nervous, cuts
dialog: him off.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: --Oh, we're just a group of friends. No
dialog: big deal. Your guys gave us permission
dialog: to pass by, so it's all good.
speaker_heading: MURDOCK
dialog: Hells Angel's don't give permission.
text: Especially to a bunch of ball-less wimps
dialog: like you.
text: Bob hammers the table and stands up - his face red with
text: long-suppressed rage.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'm not a wimp, pal'. I'm a man! You got
dialog: that? Huh? You got that!!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 61.
text: The guys look at Bob, wide-eyed. woody looks worried.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Bob, let's not get carried away--
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: No, you know what? This guy needs a
dialog: talking to just like his friends did,
dialog: Woody.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: But, Bob. I don't think--
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Let me do this, Woody! You stood up to
dialog: them last time, and I just sat there like
dialog: I always do... Well, not this time!
dialog: (turns to Murdock)
dialog: Listen, you piece of shit. You think you
dialog: can just walk around and bully perfectly
dialog: nice people? You think that's how it
dialog: works? Well, guess what? This is the
dialog: real world. With real laws and real
dialog: consequences. You hear me!?
text: Bob swats Murdock's beer out of his hand. It spills all
text: over him. Murdock is too filled with rage to speak.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Now get out of here! And if that gang of
dialog: inbred assholes needs things explained to
dialog: them again, tell 'em the Wild Hogs will
dialog: be right here in Lucas tonight.
text: Woody puts his face into his hands.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Now get.
text: Murdock just stares daggers at him.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Get!
text: Bob kicks the stool out from under Murdock. He almost
text: falls, but catches himself on a stool. He glares at the
text: guys, but he's outnumbered. He grits his teeth and
text: storms out the door. Woody winces to himself as he
text: watches Murdock go. This isn't good.
text: After a moment, BUD comes running out from behind the
dialog: bar.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 62.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Wait... You guys aren't Hells Angels?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Us? Oh, no. We're from Cincinnati.
text: Bud calls out to the kitchen.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Charley!? They ain't the bad ones!
text: CHARLEY, the sheriff from before, stands up from behind a
text: countertop in the kitchen.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: You guys aren't Hells Angels?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: No. We're Wild Hogs. That's our gang.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: And our rotary club softball team... My
dialog: wife had extra patches.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Well, sweet Mary Joseph... Welcome to
dialog: Lucas! I'm the sheriff, Charley Baskins.
dialog: I keep the peace here.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Weren't you just hiding in the kitchen?
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Well... A non-confrontation approach
dialog: sometimes is the best method to keep
dialog: aggression...
speaker_heading: (GIVES UP)
dialog: Yeah, I was hiding in the kitchen.
text: Charley looks at them for a moment, then starts to tear
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm an embarrassment.
text: Charley hurries off to the bathroom. The guys look at
dialog: each other.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Well, now he is.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 63.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET - A FEW MINUTES LATER
text: CHARLEY walks through the town square with DOUG, BOB,
text: WOODY and DUDLEY. There's a stage and booths set up
text: around the park in the center - ready for the block
text: party. As the news spreads that the Wild Hogs are
text: friendly, the townspeople start to take to the streets
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Sorry about all the confusion when you
dialog: arrived. Those guys are pretty rough.
dialog: You're the first people to ever stand up
dialog: to them.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Well, Woody is the one who really--
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Hey-- we should probably share the
dialog: credit. I mean, I just basically kicked
dialog: that guy's ass. Man! You know how good
dialog: that felt!? Yeah!
text: Bob punches a handicapped parking sign, which rattles
text: against its post, then falls to the ground. Bob
text: immediately looks regretful.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Nice. Now the paraplegics can park down
dialog: the block and get more exercise.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (suddenly meek again)
dialog: Should I fix it? Oh, man. I should.
speaker_heading: (TO CHARLEY)
dialog: I'm sorry... I didn't mean to--
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Forget about it. We only have one
text: cripple and he gets pulled around in a
dialog: wagon. Come on, I want to show you guys
dialog: something.
text: Charley leads the guys off.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE GARAGE - A FEW MINUTES LATER
text: Charley flips on the light in a neatly organized police
text: garage. In the middle sits a sparkling, unridden Harley
text: Davidson police bike.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 64.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Wow. That's fantastic.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You ride this?
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Oh, no. The Hells Angels would take it
dialog: to pieces if they ever saw me on it. I
dialog: just keep it in here. Polish it and so
dialog: forth. But I'd never let them see it.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Those guys are that big of a problem,
dialog: huh?
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Yeah. They ride into town a few times a
dialog: month and get drunk, damage property...
dialog: Basically turn the place upside down.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: And the police don't do anything?
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Well, It's a small town - and me and the
dialog: Dooble brothers are the only law. And
dialog: they're still pretty green.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Can't you call a bigger town or something
dialog: for backup?
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Yeah, I've done that a few times. But
text: the gang is always gone by the time they
dialog: get here. We've also tried wearing riot
dialog: gear, which does protect you from being
text: hit, but not from being dragged. Also,
text: one of the Dooble brothers tried to throw
text: tear gas, but the bottle exploded and
text: blew off his ear.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Ech.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Yeah, he's hard to look at.
speaker_heading: (THEN)

speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Oh, thanks, but we're actually moving on--
speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: (TO DUDLEY)
dialog: We'd be honored to stay. Thank you.
text: Woody's looks at Doug in protest. Doug gives him a stern
dialog: glare.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: And if you're not in a rush to leave in
dialog: the morning-- We've got a great trout
dialog: stream you might want to check out.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Cool! Let's fish!
text: Doug shrugs.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Sure. Let's do it.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Uh uh. No, I'm putting my foot down,
dialog: here. I still get a vote on what we do,
dialog: you know? And I want my vote.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Okay. Of course you get a vote.
text: Woody nods and looks at Bob and Dudley. They clearly
dialog: intend to stay.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: I actually get three votes. Because I
dialog: planned the trip.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: But you didn't plan the voting system. I
dialog: did. So you only get one. Sorry.

scene_heading: EXT. BIKER BAR - SAME TIME
text: MURDOCK has arrived at the bar, which is just a burned
text: shack at this point. The Hell's Angels are gathered

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Those assholes think they can cross the

speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Those guys have some balls. Balls I will

text: chuckles.
speaker_heading: OILCAN
dialog: You're going to put balls in your mouth?
text: The gang laughs. Jack realizes what the joke is...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No! I'm not-- I'm going to put my foot
dialog: up their asses! Both feet! Hell, I'm
dialog: going to stick anything I can in their
dialog: asses, and I'm going to enlov it.
text: The guys start laughing again. Jack boils red.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Shut up!! I didn't mean-- Just get on
dialog: your damn bikes! We're riding to Lucas!
text: The guys start towards their bikes. Oilcan sidles up
text: next to Jack.
speaker_heading: OILCAN
dialog: Sometimes it helps if you say things in
dialog: your mind first, then say it out loud,
dialog: you know?
text: Jack looks at Oilcan for a beat, then bends down, picks a
text: dart up out of the ash, and jabs it into his shoulder.
speaker_heading: OILCAN (CONT'D)

scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET HOTEL - THAT AFTERNOON
text: DOUG, BOB, WOODY and DUDLEY exit out of an old fashioned
text: hotel next to the diner. They cross to the town square,
text: where the block party is in full swing. Townspeople
text: mingle around eating corn-on-the-cob and hotdogs. Up on
text: the stage, a plump, middle-aged man with a goatee and a
text: polo shirt tucked into dockers - sings Justin
dialog: Timberlake's "Rock Your body."
speaker_heading: PLUMP MAN
dialog: So you grab your girls, And you grab a
dialog: couple more.
dialog: And you all come meet me, in the middle
text: of the floor.
dialog: Gonna rock your body! 'Till the break of
speaker_heading: DAY--
text: The man drops to his knees at the edge of stage and
text: reaches his hand out to the audience, like the star of a
dialog: boy band; However, it's clearly making the people on the
text: dance floor uncomfortable.
text: Meanwhile, Doug, Bob, Woody and Dudley walk through the
text: square and are instantly greeted, patted on the back and
text: thanked by each townsperson they pass. The word is out
dialog: that these guys are heroes. Doug gives a "can you
text: believe this?" look to the other guys - who are just as
text: thrilled as him. They're eating it up.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: These people love us. This is nuts.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yeah. They think we're bad asses.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Well, let's not get too carried away with
dialog: it. The truth is we're just regular
dialog: guys. Let's not forget that.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Yeah, the best thing is to keep a low
dialog: profile. Don't cause any waves. Then if
dialog: somebody pushes us too far, Boom! We go

speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: You're going to go Billy Jack?
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Nooo. I'm just minding my own business.
dialog: I don't want to cause any trouble.
text: Dudley turns to Woody and stares at him. Woody looks
dialog: confused.
speaker_heading: WOODY
speaker_heading: (TO DUDLEY)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: He's waiting for you to say something
dialog: else, then he's going to kick you.
text: Dudley gets a deflated look and backs off of Woody.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
speaker_heading: (TO WOODY)
dialog: Doug just saved you a world of hurt.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: You're afraid of your cat.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Yeah, well... He once bit me on the
dialog: sack.
text: Dudley walks off towards the beer tent. Woody looks to
text: the other guys with a puzzled look.
speaker_heading: BOB
text: It's true. He was unclogging his bathtub
dialog: drain and the cat thought it was a ball
dialog: of yarn.
text: Doug and Woody wince.
text: ANGLE ON: DUDLEY, at the beer tent. He gets in line,
text: and realizes he's behind MAGGIE. She smiles at him.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Hi.
text: Dudley is wide-eyed.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Um... I, uh---
speaker_heading: (SCRAMBLING)
dialog: What do you call a Mercedes in Harlem?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 69.
text: Maggie looks confused.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Nothing-- uh...
text: Maggie notices the tattoo on Dudley's shoulder.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Wow. You like macs too, huh? I've got a
dialog: vintage Apple 2e. Restored it from
dialog: scratch.
text: Dudley's jaw drops.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: I-- have a cookie jar made out of a 2e.
dialog: For fig newtons.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Wow. I like fig newtons.
text: Dudley collects himself and tries to speak.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Yeah. They're like fried chicken at a--
dialog: No, that's not... Dammit! This is hard.
text: Maggie smiles sweetly as Dudley fumbles.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You want to dance?
text: Dudley goes to respond, then decides to just give an
text: emphatic nod. Maggie smiles.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN SQUARE - A FEW MINUTES LATER
text: DOUG, BOB and WOODY are sitting at a picnic table,
text: drinking beer out of plastic cups. They lean back and
text: soak up the small town celebration around them. It's a
dialog: great night.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: It doesn't get any better than this, huh?
text: Bob notices Doug getting ready to chomp down on a piece
dialog: of garlic bread.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 70.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: That's a lot of carbs.
text: Doug stops, mid-bite, and puts the bread down.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Thanks, Bob. You saved me from all
dialog: that... buttery, garlicky flavor.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: No he didn't.
text: Woody takes the garlic bread and crams it in his mouth.
speaker_heading: WOODY (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (MOUTH FULL)
dialog: I did.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I hope you choke on it.
text: CHARLEY approaches with his two deputies, EARL DOOBLE and
text: BUCK DOOBLE. They are chubby, thirty-year old twins -
text: identical in every way, except for the fact that Buck is
text: missing an ear on the right side of his head... which the
text: skin has scarred back over. It doesn't look good.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Howdy, guys! Welcome to the block party!
dialog: These are my deputies: Earl and Buck
dialog: Dooble.
text: Earl shakes the guys hands.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: I'm Earl and he's Buck. Just remember,
text: the brother with the word "ear," in his
text: name, has both on his head.
speaker_heading: (LAUGHS)
dialog: I can only say that because I'm on his
dialog: right side. Which as you can see, is
text: blown off.
text: Earl laughs again, as BUCK extends his hand - oblivious.
speaker_heading: BUCK
dialog: I'm Buck and this is Earl. Good luck
dialog: telling us apart!
text: Buck laughs and turns to Charley, exposing his missing
text: ear to the guys. They draw back a little.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 71.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Well, it's nice to meet you guys. You've
dialog: got a great town here.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Yeah, we got everything here. Good
dialog: people, good fishing...
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: We do have convicted child molesters,
dialog: though. We have to disclose that.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Not if they don't have kids, Earl.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Just to be safe, though.
dialog: (yells at crowd of people)
dialog: Hey!! Thomas Milborn!
text: A bookish man with a tweed jacket turns around and looks.
speaker_heading: EARL (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (ANNOUNCING)
dialog: Convicted child molester.
text: Thomas Milborn nods glumly and pulls his hands out of his
text: pockets. The guys look at each other uneasily.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well... Still a nice town.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: If you're not a kid.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Or Thomas Milborn.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON: DANCE FLOOR AREA:
text: DUDLEY is on the dance floor with MAGGIE. The middle
text: aged guy on stage is letting loose with a rendition of
text: Usher's "Yeah." Maggie and Dudley dance conservatively
text: for a moment, but as the beat gets ahold of Dudley, he
text: starts getting into it. He starts spinning around at a
text: rapid pace, then drops to his knees, slaps the ground and
text: shakes his head to the music.
text: Maggie watches curiously as Dudley pulls himself along
text: the ground by his elbows - then springs up to his feet
text: and starts a move that resembles a sprinkler. Maggie
text: grins - actually amused by Dudley's rhythmic passion.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 72.
text: ANGLE ON: The Wild Hog's table. The guys sit with
text: Charley, Buck and Earl - watching Dudley with a curious
dialog: look.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Looks like your friend and Maggie are
dialog: hitting it off.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yeah. I think he really likes that girl.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Well, Maggie's a great woman.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Yup. Big cans, too. Buck liked her, but
dialog: you know... He's a deformed freak.
text: Buck, on Earl's left, stares out at Maggie and Dudley,
text: deaf to the conversation.
speaker_heading: BUCK
dialog: I used to like that girl... but then I
dialog: realized, I can do better.
text: The guys look at Buck.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: So, why are you guys taking this road
dialog: trip, anyway?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Ahh, just to escape for a bit.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Hey, we're not escaping anything, man.
dialog: We're on this trip to live.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: I know what you mean. Sometimes things
dialog: in life can bother you, and sometimes
dialog: nothing in life can bother you. Either
dialog: way, you've got take a break from it.
text: Happiness is somewhere between boredom
dialog: and stress.
text: Doug is surprised at Charley's insight. So is Woody.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Exactly. Which is why we need to keep
dialog: riding until we figure out where that
dialog: happiness is. You don't get old Doug
text: back by just staying put.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 73.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Old Doug?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yeah. Apparently I've lost him. I don't
dialog: sing Bon Jovi anymore.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: You did lose him, Doug. You know why?
dialog: You're housebroken. You're too
dialog: comfortable. You've got to snap out of
dialog: it!
text: Doug nods halfheartedly. He knows woody might be right.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
speaker_heading: (TO DOUG)
dialog: Woody's got a point, there. Comfortable
dialog: can be a bad thing. You have to wake up
dialog: and slap the bull once in a while.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Right! Slap the bull!
dialog: (then, to Charley)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Slapping the bull is kind of the local
dialog: test of manhood. It's a way to prove you
dialog: aren't controlled by fear. We've all
dialog: done it.
speaker_heading: EARL
text: Yup. Even torn-open head, here.
text: He nods at Buck, on his left.
speaker_heading: BUCK
dialog: You know, I slapped the bull once.
text: Woody smiles slyly. Doug looks concerned.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: We're slapping the bull.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I don't think we need to. I mean, we can
dialog: have our own test of manhood. Let's see
dialog: how many ears of corn we can eat or
dialog: something. I'll start.
text: Doug grabs an ear of corn and takes a bite, but Woody
text: just grins with that reckless look in his eyes.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 74.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: We are slapping the bull.
text: Doug knows it's no use. He nods, defeated.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. COW PASTURE - THAT EVENING
text: DOUG, BOB, WOODY, CHARLEY, BUCK and EARL approach a fence
text: surrounding a pasture. Charley smiles.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Here we are. The Lucas test of manhood.
dialog: Slap the bull.
text: Charley gestures to a lone bull grazing in the pasture.
text: He's a frighteningly large bull with enormous horns.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Wow. So it's literally slapping a bull?
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Yup. Right on the ass. Then high-tail
dialog: it out of there, because he can kill ya.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Wow. Um... Woody? This was your idea,
dialog: so... go ahead.
text: Woody nods.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: All right. I'm going in.
speaker_heading: DOUG / BOB
dialog: You are?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Hell yeah. I'm gonna slap the shit out
dialog: of that bull. Like, pimp-style.
text: The guys look at him, surprised and somewhat impressed.
text: Woody takes a breath and climbs over the fence. He
text: approaches the Bull very quietly and cautiously. He gets
text: within three feet of it, leans in and slaps the Bull hard
dialog: on the ass.
text: The bull makes an annoyed sound and turns around, but
text: Woody is already hightailing it back to the fence, with
text: an exhilarated look on his face.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 75.
speaker_heading: WOODY (CONT'D)
dialog: Whhhheeeeeeew!
text: Woody gets to the fence and hurls himself over. The guys
text: all applaud.
speaker_heading: WOODY (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes! Wow! That felt so good. I just
dialog: slapped a big fat bull right on his ass!
dialog: Did you hear how pissed he was!? I just
dialog: pissed of a bull!
dialog: (back to Bull)
dialog: Bitch!
text: Woody high fives all the guys.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: All right. I'm in. I'm slapping that
dialog: bull.
text: The guys cheer as Doug climbs over the fence and starts
text: heading towards the Bull. The group all leans on the
text: fence, watching.
speaker_heading: WOODY
speaker_heading: (TO CHARLEY)
dialog: Thanks for bringing us out here. Doug
dialog: really needs this.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yeah. This is good for him.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Sure. Glad we could help.
speaker_heading: BUCK
dialog: Yeah, and we've never seen it done twice
dialog: in a row. It'll be interesting to see
dialog: how the bull takes being slapped now that
text: he's alert.
speaker_heading: WOODY / BOB
dialog: Alert?
text: Woody and Bob look at each other, then to the Bull -
text: which Doug is about to slap.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Doug, wait!
text: It's too late. Doug slaps the bull hard, and turns to
dialog: run.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 76.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Wheeeeew!! Yeah!
text: Doug runs across the field, but the Bull - now fully
text: alert - swivels with magnificent agility and breaks into
text: an angry charge towards Doug.
text: The guys all watch in horror as the Bull quickly gains on
text: Doug. Doug sees the fear on the guys faces and looks
text: back over his shoulder. His smile quickly turns to
dialog: terror.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: Ahhhhhhhh!
text: It's too late. The Bull catches Doug and bucks him into
text: the air. Doug flies ten feet and comes crashing down on
text: the muddy grass. The Bull takes a few steps back and
text: starts lining up another charge at him.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Oh, no you don't!
text: Woody jumps over the fence and runs into the field.
speaker_heading: WOODY (CONT'D)
dialog: Heeeeey! Hey you! Come get me, Bull!
text: The Bull notices Woody and starts to Charge him.
speaker_heading: WOODY (CONT'D)
dialog: Run, Doug! Go!
text: Doug climbs to his feet and sees the bull charging Woody.
text: Woody realizes he's in trouble and starts to run again.
text: The bull quickly catches him and rams him into the air.
text: Woody lands hard, with a grunt.
text: The bull turns back to charge at Woody again, and Bob
text: jumps over the fence.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Hey! Leave him alone! You want some of
dialog: this!? Come get this!
text: Bob sprints out into the field. The bull snorts and
text: starts towards him. The Bull closes on Bob quick, but at
text: the last moment Bob dives of the way. The bull goes
text: flying past him.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Hah! Missed me, you fat bastard!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 77.
text: Doug and Woody look impressed as Bob helps them hurry
text: towards the fence. Charley and Buck hold a gate open for
text: them as the Bull makes a turn and lines the group up, but
text: they've already made it to the gate. They go through and
text: Charley shuts it behind them. They lean back on the
text: fence, trying to gather their bearings, except Bob - who
text: is thrilled.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you see me? I dodged him! I dodged
dialog: that stupid cow! How cool am--
text: Suddenly, the Bull charges into the fence, which Bob's
text: butt is sticking through. Bob goes flying and lands face
text: down in the dirt. He scrambles back up, furious.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: You son of a bitch! You want to keep it
dialog: going!? You want to take cheap shots!?
dialog: Come on!
text: Bob tries to climb back into the pasture, but the guys
text: restrain him.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO CHARLEY)
dialog: Give me your gun! Give me the gun! He
dialog: deserves it!
speaker_heading: (TO BULL)
dialog: I'll kill you!
text: Doug and Woody hold on to Bob until he calms down. Doug
text: and Woody start to laugh. Bob cools off for another
text: moment, then starts laughing as well.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: No this is living!
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: We just slapped the bull!
text: The group high fives each other in congratulations, and
text: starts away: Bruised, muddy and laughing.
text: ANGLE ON: THE BULL. He pushes on the gate that Charley
text: was holding open. The gate swings open.
text: ANGLE ON: WOODY, BOB and DOUG. They walk with Charley
text: and the Dooble brothers, laughing and carrying on.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 78.
text: Bob does an impression of how he dodged it and goes for
text: some more high fives - but suddenly, the bull charges
text: into frame and nails him. As Bob goes flying; we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN SQUARE / BLOCK PARTY - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: The block party is winding down. Dudley is sitting by
text: himself at a picnic table, in post-Maggie bliss.
text: DOUG, WOODY and BOB approach, dirty and beaten from the
text: bull - but, carrying on happily.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Man, did you see the look on Bob's face
dialog: when he got up? Didn't dodge him that
dialog: time!
text: Woody and Doug laugh. Bob looks pissed.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'm going to go back there with a rifle
text: tomorrow and shoot one of his legs off.
dialog: Then we'll see who's tough.
speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: Why just one leg?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Because I want to kick him in the face.
text: Doug and Woody laugh again. Bob just steams. They spot
text: DUDLEY, and head over to him.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Hey, Dud. You look happy.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: I danced with her. And she likes macs.
dialog: You know what that means?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: You have a sister?
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: I have a soulmate.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I thought you said the color ipod was
dialog: your soulmate.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 79.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: I thought it was. But now, I realize
dialog: that ipod was just a well-designed whore.
text: The guys smile. It's been a good night for all of them.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Come on. Let's go back to the hotel.
dialog: We've got to get up early to do some
dialog: fishing.
text: The guys start walking towards the Main Street hotel.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Okay, fine. But after fishing - we hit
dialog: the open road and keep moving, okay?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Open road, baby!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Wild Hogs ride!
text: The guys continue with enthusiastic cheers as we hear the
text: off-screen rumble of engines. Doug looks down the street
text: and sees: THE HELLS ANGELS. All forty of them are
text: riding into town - and the guys will be in their view any
text: second. Woody is frozen with fear.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Are you kidding me? Woody, you're going
dialog: to have to talk to these guys again. Get
dialog: them to leave this town alone--
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Hiiiiiiiidee!
text: DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY look confused. Woody looks around
dialog: desperately for somewhere to hide - but the Hells Angels
text: are too close. There's no time. Woody spots a port-o-
text: potty from the block party and starts corralling Doug,
text: Bob and Dudley into it.
speaker_heading: WOODY (CONT'D)
dialog: Go! Go! Go!
text: Woody pushes his puzzled friends into the port-o-potty,
text: then gets in with them and shuts the door, just as the
text: Hells Angels cruise by them.

speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Woody!? What the hell is wrong with--
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Shhhh! They'll hear you! Don't make a
dialog: sound!
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN SQUARE - CONTINUOUS
text: The Hells Angels park their bikes. We see all the
text: townspeople have stopped enjoying themselves, and just
text: stand there, scared. Jack gets off his bike and looks
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: (YELLS OUT)
dialog: Good evening, Lucas. Now, as hurt as I
dialog: am that you're having a party and didn't
dialog: invite us... We're only here for one
dialog: reason. The "Wild Hogs." Where the hell
dialog: are they!?
scene_heading: INT. PORT-O-POTTY - CONTINUOUS
text: Doug looks at Woody. He's starting to figure it out.
text: Woody guiltily avoids Doug's glare and watches the Hells
text: Angels through a vent in the port-o-potty.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN SQUARE - CONTINUOUS
text: The townspeople aren't saying a word. Jack continues to
text: pace in front of the diner.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Come on, now. You shouldn't be
dialog: protecting them. These "Wild Hogs," not

dialog: You son of a bitch!
text: Bob lunges at Woody, but the sudden shifting of weight is
dialog: too much for the port-o-potty...
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN SQUARE - CONTINUOUS
text: The port-o-potty tips over. All the Hells Angels turn
text: and look as it crashes over on it's side. They continue
text: to stare at it curiously.
scene_heading: INT. PORT-O-POTTY - CONTINUOUS
text: The guys, now on their side, freeze as they see through
text: the vent that the Hells Angels are staring at them. It's
text: a very tense moment as they wait to see if they've been
text: discovered. After a moment, we hear a "glup, glup,
dialog: glup," And the guys smell something curious.
speaker_heading: BOB
speaker_heading: (WHISPERING)
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
speaker_heading: (WHISPERING)
dialog: It's that blue port-o-potty juice. It's
text: coming out of the can.
text: The guys all cringe in disgust, but know they can't move.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN SQUARE - CONTINUOUS
text: Jack finally turns away from the pot-o-potty and smirks.
speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: (TO GANG)
dialog: Now, that's a port-o-potty that ain't

speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: All right, then. Nobody wants to tell me
dialog: where they are? Fine. Maybe this'll jar
dialog: your memory.
text: Jack takes a garbage can and tosses it into the diner
text: window. The crowd gasps, as the Hells Angels laugh.
text: CHARLEY steps out of the crowd.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: I think they're out at Mckinley's
dialog: pasture. Something about slapping a

text: Jack smiles.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Good.
dialog: (to Hells Angels)
dialog: Saddle up, boys.
text: The guys get on their bikes.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO TOWN)
dialog: And if they ain't there. We'll be back
dialog: reeeal soon. Because I don't let any man

text: The gang snickers. Jack realizes;
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO GANG)
dialog: Shut the hell up! I didn't-- You know
dialog: what I meant!
text: Jack starts his bike and roars out of the town. The
text: others follow him, gunning their bikes and leaving skid
text: marks and smoke in their trail. A kid yells at the Hells
text: Angels as they ride out of sight.
speaker_heading: KIDS
dialog: Go ahead and come back! The Wild Hogs
dialog: aren't afraid you! The Wild Hogs aren't
dialog: afraid of anything!
text: Suddenly, the door pops open on the port-o-potty and the
text: WILD HOGS topple out of it in a heap. We see they're

text: Bob puts his head under a water-spouting marble fish.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: It got in my hair! Gross!
text: The guys desperately try to rinse off the juice - then,
text: drenched from head to toe, turn their glare to Woody.
speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: (TO WOODY)
dialog: You lied, didn't you!? You stood there
dialog: and lied to us!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You did! You're a stinking liar!
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: I did it for you guys! I wanted you to
dialog: live!
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Live!? We're going to die, Woody! You
dialog: burned down their bar! We are dead men!
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Oh, man. I thought it was going to

text: Dudley sits on the fountain edge and starts to tear up.
speaker_heading: WOODY
speaker_heading: (TO GUYS)
dialog: I'm sorry, okay!
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Sorry? That's it!? You're sorry!?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Yes, I'm sorry! I just didn't want us to
dialog: go back.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Why? It's just a stupid vacation!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 84.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Because I don't have anything to go back
dialog: to, okay!
text: Doug and Bob go silent. Woody looks away - trying to
text: collect himself. After a moment, he faces them.
speaker_heading: WOODY (CONT'D)
dialog: I've lost everything. The firm fired me,
dialog: Claudia left me... It's all gone. My
dialog: whole life is gone. I don't even have
dialog: enough money to get my lawn raked
dialog: anymore.
text: Doug, Bob and Dudley are stupefied. Woody takes a deep
text: breath and continues.
speaker_heading: WOODY (CONT'D)
dialog: That's why I couldn't go back. This
dialog: isn't a vacation for me, it's the only
dialog: thing I have left. There's nothing more
dialog: in my life but you guys. So, I lied
dialog: about the Hells Angels. I lied because I
dialog: wanted to have one thing in my life that
dialog: wasn't a complete failure. A real trip
dialog: with my best friends... You're all I
dialog: got. I'm sorry.
text: Woody lowers his head. The guys take this in for a
text: minute. Woody looks at them, waiting for their sympathy.
text: Finally, Doug speaks.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (realizing, to Woody)
dialog: This trip is just you running from your
dialog: life. Your miserable, screwed up life.
speaker_heading: (GETTING ANGRIER)
dialog: And you knew you couldn't go back to it,
dialog: so instead you screwed up our lives,
dialog: too... You asshole!
text: Woody's puppy-dog face dissolves.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Fine! I see how important I am to you
dialog: guys. That's just fine. I just thought
dialog: being a "Wild Hog" meant something!
text: Woody takes off his "Wild Hogs" jacket and throws it at
text: their feet. He hops out of the fountain and storms off
text: down the street.

speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: It doesn't mean anything! It's just a
dialog: patch my wife made!!
text: Doug, Bob and Dudley look at each other. After a moment,
text: they look over to the sidewalk and see:
text: ALL THE TOWNSPEOPLE, staring at them in disappointed
text: silence. Slowly, the townspeople turn and quietly head

speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: You think?
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET DINER - CONTINUOUS
text: The Hells Angels have returned, and set up shop in the

speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: (YELLING OUT)
dialog: Alright, Wild Hogs. We know you're in
dialog: town somewhere, 'cause you haven't
dialog: checked out of the hotel. We're a little
dialog: smarter than you thought, huh?
speaker_heading: OILCAN
dialog: Hell yeah we are!! Wheeew!
text: Oilcan smashes a beer can against his own head.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: So we're going to wait right here 'till
dialog: you show up. Weeks, if we have to.
dialog: Hell, we might just make ourselves the

text: Jack laughs.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - SAME TIME
text: The guys watch the commotion through the window.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Crap. I was thinking of that for us.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: You guys just stay in the station
dialog: tonight. No one needs to go out there
dialog: and be a hero and end up getting hurt.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Thanks, Charley.
text: Charley and the Dooble brothers look a little surprised.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Wow. So... You're not going out there?
text: Doug sighs in irritation.
speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: (SNAPS)
dialog: Well, you're the cop. Why don't you go
dialog: out there?
text: Charley is visibly hurt. His lip starts to tremble.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
speaker_heading: (TEARING UP)
dialog: That's not cool, man.
text: Charley runs out the back door of the station. EARL
text: shakes his head and looks at Doug.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: You know, people have feelings. Sure, I
dialog: make comments about "chum face," here.
dialog: But that's because every time I look at
dialog: him I see parts of his brain. But nobody
dialog: has the right to hurt Charley like that.
text: He has both sides of his head.
text: Earl storms off, leaving BUCK, who was standing on his

scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - NEXT MORNING

text: ANGLE ON: The Main Street Diner: The Hells Angels bikes

text: passed out in various booths, chairs, and the street out
dialog: front.
text: BACK ON: The police station. Dudley and Bob approach
dialog: the window.
speaker_heading: DOUG
text: They're still out there. Passed out.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well, I talked to Karen. She going to
dialog: fly out here, rent a mini-van, and pick
dialog: us up. We'll just ship the bikes back
dialog: later.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Bob, we can't leave. They'll just stay
dialog: here and keep terrorizing this town.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: So what? They can call the National
dialog: guard or something.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: For what? To be stationed here
dialog: permanently? Because these guys will
dialog: just come back when they're gone. And
dialog: it'll be even worse.

text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 88.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: We've created this problem, Bob. We've
dialog: got to think of a way to solve it.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well, Karen is really insistent she come
dialog: drive us back.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Tell her "no," Bob.
text: Bob looks uncomfortable at this thought.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I can't do that.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Well, you're going to have to, Bob!
dialog: We're not going to screw over an entire
dialog: town because you're afraid of women!
text: Bob stands up, insulted.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Oh, sorry I'm not brave like you, Doug!
text: The guy who gets injections in his scalp
dialog: so he won't go bald!
text: Bob storms out the back door of the police station.
text: Dudley looks to Doug, curiously.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: You do?
text: Doug shrugs weakly.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: You know, you can storm out too, if you
dialog: want.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: No, no. I mean, I thought about going to
dialog: see Maggie while those guys are asleep,
dialog: but you need me right now.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Thanks, man.
text: Doug smiles and gives Dudley a squeeze on the shoulder.
text: Dudley is clearly disappointed, having assumed Doug would
text: tell him to go see Maggie. Dudley just stands there,
dialog: silent.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: You okay?

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 89.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
speaker_heading: (SNAPS)

scene_heading: EXT. BACK OF POLICE STATION - LATER
text: Doug exits and looks around the corner of the building,
text: making sure the Hells Angels are still sleeping, then
text: starts walking towards a wooded park behind the town.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - A MOMENT LATER
text: Doug walks through the park, looking depressed. He
text: passes through a small playground, and has a seat on a
text: bench. He watches all the children play, and his eyes
text: fall on four young boys happily riding their bicycles
text: together. They have cards in their spokes, making engine
text: sounds as they ride around having a great time together.
text: Doug smiles and watches them play together.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT MUSIC CUE
speaker_heading: BUD (O.C.)
dialog: Thought you might be out here.
text: Doug turns and sees BUD, the owner of the diner, Bud has
text: a seat next to him.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Hey, Bud. Look, I'm sorry we got your
dialog: town in all this trouble. This trip was
dialog: supposed to fix problems, not cause them.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Well, maybe it's trying to and you just
dialog: won't let it.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: What do you mean?
text: Bud smiles and looks out at the kids playing.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 90.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: It's the funny thing about life. It has
dialog: to be an adventure to feel right. But
dialog: when you become a husband and a Dad, you
dialog: realize adventure is risk, and a family
dialog: man has no place in his life for risk.
text: Doug takes this in, then realizes.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: You're right. That's why I stopped
dialog: singing Bon Jovi. Life used to be a
dialog: risk. That was old Doug. And now it's
dialog: gone. I've taken away all the risk.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Yup. And if you try to make livin' too
dialog: safe, then it's not livin' at all.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: It's not. And I have a will, now. So, I
dialog: only have so much livin' left. And
dialog: somehow I've lost the best part of it.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Well, maybe these will help you find it.
text: Bud puts a styrofoam container on Doug's lap. Doug looks
dialog: into it.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: These are worms.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Yup. To fish with.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I don't get it.
speaker_heading: BUD
text: Friends that screw up. Angry bikers.
dialog: That's not something you should be
dialog: avoiding. That's something you need.
text: Doug takes this in.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: What's that have to do with worms?
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Go down to the lake and find out.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 91.
text: Bud smiles and walks off. Doug looks down at the worms,
dialog: considering...
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - LATER
text: Doug walks up to the shore and sees Woody, trying to push
text: a canoe towards the water. Woody notices Doug.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Hey. Going fishing?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Yup.
text: Woody gets the canoe to the water and looks back at Doug.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I've got worms.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I mean, in here.
text: Doug holds up the styrofoam cup. Woody shrugs.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: All right. Let's go.
text: Doug helps Woody shove the boat out into the water. They
text: both hop in as it floats away from the shore. They sit
text: there staring off in silence.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Um... Look, man. I'm sorry about
dialog: Claudia. And the job.
speaker_heading: WOODY
speaker_heading: (STARING OFF)
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: But, you shouldn't have lied to us--
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: You know what? I screwed up! It
dialog: happens. Maybe from now on I'm better
dialog: off just doing things on my own!
text: Woody starts to get up, but then looks at the water
text: around him, and sits.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 92.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: You would have stormed off right then,
dialog: huh?
speaker_heading: WOODY
speaker_heading: (DEFLATED)
dialog: Yeah.
text: Doug nods and looks out at the water. They sit there in
text: silence for another moment.
speaker_heading: WOODY (CONT'D)
dialog: I didn't want to lose, Doug. I've lost
dialog: everything else and I didn't want to lose
dialog: this trip with you guys. When we're
dialog: together, it's like we're all college
dialog: kids still. I'm not a guy with a broken
dialog: marriage and failed career. I'm just
dialog: with my best friends, being happy. And
dialog: to keep it going, I forgot about what
dialog: made it so great... That friends never
dialog: let each other down. Until now. I
dialog: screwed up the last thing I had left.
dialog: You guys deserve better. I'm sorry--
text: Woody eyes water a little and he quickly turns away from
text: Doug. They sit there for another moment.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Well, what's the point of being in a
dialog: motorcycle gang if we can't ourselves in
dialog: a little trouble?
text: Woody looks back at him. Doug smiles a little bit.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: It'll be okay, man.
text: Woody smiles a little as well.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: They won't kill us, right? Just a...
dialog: really bad beating.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yeah. We won't die. I don't think.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: No way. And how much could a punch
dialog: really hurt? Not much, probably.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 93.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Well, the good thing is we'll be able to
dialog: know for sure. That'll be cool.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Let's go find the Bob and Dudley.
text: Doug looks around the canoe for a paddle.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Did you bring the paddles?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: No. I wasn't even going to take this
dialog: thing out, but I didn't want you to think
dialog: I was just standing at the lake waiting
dialog: for you.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Why were you here?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Bud told me to stand at the lake and wait
dialog: for you.
text: Doug nods. Bob walks up on the shore, holding a
text: styrofoam cup.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Hey, guys.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Hey, Bob. Worms?
text: Bob looks at the styrofoam cup and nods.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Are we all good?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Yeah, Bob. We're all good.
text: Woody smiles at Doug.
speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: (TO BOB)
dialog: Throw us that paddle.
text: Bob nods and picks up a paddle. He throws it toward the
text: canoe, but it lands ten yards short and sinks.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Shit. Hold on.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 94.
text: Bob grabs another paddle and throws it. This time it
text: lands even shorter. Bob looks around for another paddle.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Were those the only two paddles?
speaker_heading: BOB
speaker_heading: (BUMMED)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Oh.
text: Bob sits down on the grass.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You guys'll drift in.
speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: (BUMMED)
dialog: Yeah.
text: Woody and Doug look around at the water. It's as still

dialog: shore.
scene_heading: INT. BUD AND MAGGIE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME
text: A cook from the diner is at the kitchen stove, making

speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Well, we can't seat many people in there,

speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Sorry those jerks are in your diner.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Ah, we're used to them costing us money.

dialog: them.
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: DUDLEY

speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: No, I meant... They damage the diner a

dialog: just sorry you guys got dragged into it.
dialog: You were just out to have a good

text: Dudley looks at Maggie sincerely.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: This has been the best vacation of my

text: Maggie blushes.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You bikers probably tell all the girls
dialog: that.
text: This hits Dudley. He suddenly looks troubled.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Maggie, I have to tell you something.
dialog: I'm not really a cool biker or a cool...
dialog: anything. I'm a computer programmer. A
dialog: nerd. My cat doesn't even like me. She
dialog: watches me sleep and I don't know why. I
dialog: think she's waiting for me to stop
dialog: breathing. I'm just a... Geek. I'm
dialog: sorry if you thought I was somebody I'm
dialog: not.
text: Maggie takes this in. After a moment, she smiles and
text: kisses Dudley.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You're not a geek, Dudley. You're sweet
dialog: and your honest and... You're the
dialog: coolest guy I know. Your cat is crazy if
dialog: it doesn't like you as much as I do.
text: Dudley smiles. He has completely fallen for her.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, I better get back inside. I've got

dialog: for the lunch rush. People gotta eat.
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Oh, people will eat. Don't you worry,
dialog: Maggie. People will eat.

scene_heading: INT. MAIN STREET DINER - A FEW MINUTES LATER
text: DUDLEY kicks open the front door. JACK and the other
text: Hells Angels are inside, drinking and carrying on.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Alright, let's end this!
text: The Hells Angels don't even notice him. Dudley bites his
text: lip in frustration.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (YELLS)
dialog: Hey! !
text: Dudley takes a table full of empty beer glasses and flips
text: it over. Everyone in the diner goes silent and looks at
text: him. Jack stands up and smiles.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, well. One of you came to face the
dialog: music, huh? That's brave. And stupid.
text: The Hells Angels laugh. Dudley takes a deep breath and
text: walks up to Jack.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: I'm not here to face any music. I'm here
dialog: to make you a deal. A deal I think you'd
dialog: be smart to take.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah? What deal?
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: You leave the town of Lucas, and my
dialog: friends alone, and I do something for
dialog: you. Something you can't live without.
text: Jack looks interested. Dudley confidently sets a laptop
text: on the counter, and punches a few keys. He swivels it
text: around to show the gang.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 97.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: See where that says "Domain for sale?"
dialog: Guess what that means. Your gang doesn't
dialog: have a website! Nothing! No way to tell
dialog: people about your history, post photos,
dialog: sell shirts... You guys are living in
dialog: the complete dark ages!
dialog: (laughs cockily, then)
dialog: So they way I see it: I need a favor
dialog: from you and you need a favor from me.
text: Jack walks over to the computer and looks at Dudley for a
text: moment. He then picks the computer up and smashes it
text: down on the ground. It breaks into a hundred pieces.
text: Jack smiles at Dudley and puts his foot through what's
text: left of it. The Hells Angels stifle laughter. Dudley is

speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: (TO DUDLEY)
dialog: No deal.
text: Dudley nods.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Okay, then. Thanks for hearing me out.
text: Dudley starts for the door, but several Hells Angels move

speaker_heading: DUDLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Sanctuary! Sanctuary!!
text: The Hells Angels pull off him, confused.
speaker_heading: OILCAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Sanctuary. You have to take me to a

speaker_heading: (DEFEATED)

scene_heading: EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF MAGGIE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME
text: DOUG, BOB, and WOODY are walking back from the lake, and
text: pass by Maggie's house. BUD, standing on the porch, sees
text: them and smiles.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: If you're heading back to town, I
dialog: wouldn't go on an empty stomach.
text: The guys see Bud and smile.
speaker_heading: BUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Come have lunch. This is kind of our
text: "fallout" diner. Smaller kitchen, but
text: less piss on the bathroom floor.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Well, we can change that.
text: Bud laughs as the guys enter the house.
scene_heading: INT. BUD AND MAGGIE'S HOUSE - A FEW MINUTES LATER
text: DOUG, BOB and WOODY are sitting at one of many card
text: tables arranged in the family room, eating lunch.
text: CHARLEY enters through the front door..
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Hey, guys. Having your final meal?
text: Charley laughs. Doug, Bob and Woody don't.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: BOB
speaker_heading: (TO CHARLEY)
dialog: Where are Buck and Earl?
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
text: They're coming. Buck's ear is giving him

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

text: EARL ENTERS, holding the door open for BUCK, who walks
text: through slowly.
speaker_heading: EARL
speaker_heading: (TO BUCK)
dialog: Just keep your eyes forward and head up.
speaker_heading: BUCK
dialog: I'm fine.
text: Buck walks a few more steps, then starts to tilt left.
text: He quickly loses his balance and falls sideways, taking
text: out a card table full of food and the old man sitting at
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Goddammit.
text: Earl helps Buck up and they join the guys at their table.
speaker_heading: BUCK
dialog: Hey, guys. Having your final meal?
text: Buck and Earl laugh. Nobody else does.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: (sternly, to Buck and Earl)
dialog: That's out of line, guys.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Sorry.
text: Buck looks around the table.
speaker_heading: BUCK
dialog: Hey, isn't one of you missing?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Yeah, Dudley's with Maggie somewhere.
text: MAGGIE COMES OUT OF THE KITCHEN and approaches the table.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Hey, guys. Where's Dudley?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: He's with you, isn't he?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: No. I thought he went to find you guys.

speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: (TO CHARLEY)
dialog: Charley, can I borrow your phone?
text: Charley hands it to him, and Doug starts to dial.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: Dudley has mine. I'll just call him.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: He has a phone? What happened to
dialog: freedom?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: He needed to call his answering machine
text: so his cat could hear his voice.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: Here we go. It's ringing...
speaker_heading: (TO MAGGIE)
dialog: He probably snuck off somewhere to buy
dialog: you some romantic gift or something. No
dialog: big deal.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: That's it. He's never had a girlfriend
text: so he's probably getting carried away.
dialog: He once drank eighteen Mocha Latte's
text: because the Starbucks clerk was smiling
text: at him.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: I remember that. His pee turned brown
text: and he started crying.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yeah. And the girl wasn't even smiling -
text: she just had a cleft lip.
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Hello? Dudley?
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: INT. MAIN STREET DINER - SIMULTANEOUS
text: Jack stands next to Dudley, who is duct-taped to a chair

scene_heading: INT. MAIN STREET DINER - SIMULTANEOUS
speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Damn right, the Hells Angels. Your
dialog: friend paid us a little visit. And now
dialog: he's hurting reeeeal bad.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: No, I actually feel pretty--
text: Jack kicks Dudley's chair with his foot. It tips over
text: and lands on it's side - with Dudley in it. Dudley looks
text: out at the floor, helpless.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Ow!
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: Hey, a peanut.
text: Dudley tries to stick his tongue out to get the peanut.
text: Jack notices and kicks it away.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Crap.
speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: So here's what we're going to do, now.
dialog: You guys are going to pay us a visit.
dialog: And you're going to bring a "disobedience
dialog: fee," of ten thousand dollars. Cash.
dialog: And don't even think about calling any
dialog: cops. Just you guys and ten grand. And
dialog: if you don't show up in an hour - Well
dialog: then, We'll just take the fine out of
dialog: your friend's legs... Which we're going
text: to break with a tire iron.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY

speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)

speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Dammit.

scene_heading: INT. BUD AND MAGGIE'S HOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS

speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)

scene_heading: INT. BIKER BAR - SIMULTANEOUS
speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Oh, I won't touch him if you bring that
dialog: money. But if you don't, I'll be
dialog: touching him all night long. And I'll be
dialog: enjoying it.
text: The other bikers suddenly stifle laughter.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: What!? There was nothing wrong with that
dialog: one! That was tough! Those guys are
dialog: afraid of me, now. They know how much I
dialog: want 'em!
text: The gang laughs again.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Shut up!!
text: The gang stops laughing, off Jack's warning glare.

speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Hey can we call my cat, now? She needs
dialog: to hear my voice.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 103.
text: Jack looks down at Dudley, then to the other bikers.
speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: (TO BIKERS)
dialog: Get me more duct tape?
text: A biker nods and grabs another role of duct tape. He
text: heads over to Dudley.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Crap.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. BUD AND MAGGIE'S HOUSE - A FEW MINUTES LATER
text: DOUG sits in a chair, deep in thought. BOB, WOODY, EARL,

text: MAGGIE is on a couch, sobbing into her hands.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
speaker_heading: (CRYING)
dialog: Sweet Dudley. He went there to save
dialog: everybody and now they're going to break
text: his hands.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: No they aren't. We're going to get him
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: We sure are. I'm going to call the
dialog: Highway Patrol. They'll be there in--
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: No way. They said no law. We can't risk
dialog: them doing anything to Dudley.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Bob's right. We can call the Highway
dialog: Patrol after we get Dud back, but we
dialog: shouldn't piss these guys off while he's
text: still in their hands.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'm going to call Karen and have the cash
dialog: wired out of our savings.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: No. No way. This is my fault. All this
dialog: is my fault. I have some money in my
dialog: severance package. We're using it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 104.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Wait, he did this because of me. I have
dialog: a thousand dollars in tip money I want to
dialog: put in.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: I have a couple thousand in the diner
dialog: emergency fund I'll put in, too.
text: Doug, who has been thinking all this over, stands up from
dialog: his chair.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: No. Nobody is paying anything.
text: Everyone stops and gives Doug a puzzled look. He has a
text: new fire behind his eyes. His suburban quietude has
text: transformed into something more... valiant.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: We're not calling the Highway patrol.
dialog: We're not gathering ten thousand dollars.
dialog: We're going over there and getting our
dialog: friend back.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: I don't think that's the safest plan.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: It's not. But sometimes you have to do
dialog: the things that aren't safe, to create a
dialog: world that you're happy being in. These
dialog: Hells Angels don't want our ten thousand
dialog: dollars. They want our dignity. They
dialog: want us to be afraid of them just like
dialog: this town is. And once they know we're
dialog: afraid, they can do whatever they want.
dialog: That's how these guys exist. That's how
dialog: they ride into this town and tear it to
dialog: pieces... Because people want to keep
dialog: their lives safe so badly, they give up
dialog: the best part about it...
text: Doug takes his Wild Hogs jacket and pulls it on.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: .The adventure.
text: Doug looks at Woody and Bob. Woody smiles and pulls on
text: his jacket.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 105.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: And the friends.
text: Woody steps over to Doug. Bob looks at them for a
text: moment, then finally smiles and pulls on his jacket.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Let's go slap the bull.
text: Doug smiles and taps fists with Bob and Woody.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET - LATER
scene_heading: MUSIC CUE: BLUE OYSTER CULT'S "(DON'T FEAR) THE REAPER."
text: DOUG, BOB and WOODY walk along main street, shoulder to
text: shoulder. They look to each other with a smile. Even
text: though they're walking into the mouth of the beast,
text: they're finally who they were in college again.
text: Fearless. They approach the diner and stand out on the
text: street, like gunslingers in the Old West, calling their
text: enemy out of the saloon.
scene_heading: MUSIC CUE: FADE OUT
text: The front door of the bar opens and the HELLS ANGELS
text: swagger out. After a moment, the gang parts and JACK
text: steps out in front of them.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, well. The "Wild Hogs." I'm glad
dialog: to see you're finally showing us a little
dialog: respect.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Where's Dudley?
text: Jack turns back and nods at one of the Hells Angels.
text: They push DUDLEY forward. We see he is now completely
text: cocooned in duct-tape - like a mummy. There is only a
text: small slit for his mouth and eyes.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: (muffled from tape)
dialog: Hey, guyth.
text: Doug shakes his head.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Just hold tight, Dudley.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 106.
text: Dudley tries to nod, but can't. He leans his torso back
dialog: and forth to signal "yes."
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO JACK)
dialog: All right. Hand him over.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Sure. Where's the cash?
text: Doug looks to Bob and Woody. They nod encouragingly.
text: Doug gathers his courage and turns back to Jack.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: We're not giving you any money.
text: Jack looks surprised.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: We're not going to play your games.
dialog: We're all adults, here. It's not
dialog: highschool. I'm sorry your bar got
dialog: burned down, and we'll be glad to help
dialog: you get it rebuilt, but we're done being
dialog: bullied by you. Now give us back Dudley,
dialog: and get out of this town.
text: The Hells Angels start to laugh. Jack turns back to them
dialog: and smiles, "Can you believe these guys?" Doug is
text: starting to lose his cool.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: (yells to Jack)
dialog: Give us back our friend, asshole!
text: The Hells Angels are suddenly silent. Jack turns back
text: and looks at Doug in disbelief - then rage. Doug starts
text: to look a little worried.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What did you just call me?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (losing some confidence)
dialog: Ass... hole.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You know what? I was just going to
dialog: pulverize your friend, here.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 107.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: But now I'm pissed off. You're all going
dialog: to get hurt. Hells Angels style. Guys!
text: The Hells Angles nod and pick up various weapons:
text: Crowbars, tire irons, bats... They start moving towards
text: Doug, Woody and Bob. Bob looks to Doug.
speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: (TO BOB)
dialog: What!? I thought they'd back down!
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: We can still outrun them. They're fat.
text: Woody turns around to see Hells Angles have now closed in
text: behind them, blocking their escape. Jack smiles.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hear that, guys!? He called you all fat!
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: shit.
dialog: (to Hells Angels)
dialog: I meant full-figured.
text: The Hells Angels close to within a few feet of the "Wild
text: Hogs," and raise their weapons to strike.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Wait!! Wait a minute!
text: The Hells Angels stop.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO JACK)
dialog: You want to beat the shit out of us?
dialog: Fine. But you outnumber us forty to
dialog: three. You think there's honor in that?
dialog: Why don't we make it fair, if you guys
dialog: are so freaking tough? The leader of our
dialog: gang against the leader of yours.
text: Jack smirks. He's twice as big as Doug.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Me against you?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yeah. But not just for Dudley. If you
dialog: win, we'll give you ten grand and go back
dialog: home. You'll never see us again. But...
dialog: If I win, you let Dudley go and you never
dialog: set foot in Lucas again. This town is
dialog: off limits to the Hells Angels. Forever.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 108.
text: Jack looks back to the Hells Angels, who chuckle. This
dialog: will be a quick fight.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: Well? You in, or are you too much of a
dialog: bitch?
text: The Hells Angels freeze. Jack grits his teeth in rage
text: and turns back to Doug.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: All right. Let's party, tough guy.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Great.
text: Doug nods, trying to look confidant, but it's quickly
text: fading away.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (UNSURE)
dialog: Great.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN SQUARE - A FEW MINUTES LATER
text: DOUG and JACK are standing "in their corners," opposite
text: each other in the dirt parking lot. They're surrounded
text: by a circle of Hells Angels, rowdily waiting for the
text: fight to commence. WOODY and BOB coach Doug in his
dialog: corner.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Just stay clear of the big punches.
dialog: You've got more stamina than this guy.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: All right. When do I hit back?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Um... Just try and get him tired. I
dialog: don't think punches will do much to him.
text: Doug gives Woody a concerned look. Woody shrugs. Jack
text: steps into the circle and throws off his jacket.
speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: (CALLING OUT)
dialog: Time for your beating, yuppie!

dialog: 
dialog: 7/06/05 109.
dialog: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft
speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: (TO BOB)
dialog: Tell my wife I won - then got hit by a
dialog: truck.
text: Doug takes a deep breath and starts into the circle.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO JACK)
dialog: All right. Let's do this--
text: Doug doesn't even finish his sentence as Jack lands a
text: punch on the side of his head. Doug is stunned, as Jack
text: sends his other fist crashing into Doug's forehead. Doug
text: goes flying backwards, and falls down in the dirt. The
text: Hells Angels cheer. Jack high fives them as Doug
text: struggles back to his feet and looks back at Woody and
text: Bob, cradling his face.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: Ow! Dammit Jesus that hurt!
speaker_heading: (TO WOODY)
dialog: It really hurts. Damn!
text: Jack comes back over to Doug. Jack throws another right,
text: but this time Doug ducks, still cradling his jaw.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes!--
text: But Doug is instantly punched in the stomach by Jack's
text: other fist. Doug winces as he doubles over in agony.
text: Drool drips out of his mouth. This isn't pretty.
text: Jack takes him by the back of the shirt and lifts him
text: into the air. The Hells Angels cheer as Jack tosses Doug
text: five yards into the dirt.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Don't get tired yet. The hurt is just
dialog: beginning.
text: Doug tries to stand back up, but it's getting harder. He
text: slyly grabs a handful of sand as he starts to stand.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Hah!
text: Doug whips around and throws the sand towards Jack's
text: face; However, his aim is off. The sand hits Jack in the
text: chest and falls away. Jack looks at Doug and shakes his
dialog: head.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 110.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: Damn.
text: Jack punches Doug square in the face again. Doug
text: crumples to the ground in pain. Jack turns back to the
dialog: Hells Angels.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Man, this isn't even a workout.
text: Jack laughs and puts his aviator sunglasses back on, as
text: Doug quickly stands up and whips around at him.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Ahhh!
text: Doug throws another handful of sand. This time he aims
text: carefully; but Jack now has sunglasses on. The sand
text: bounces harmlessly off the lenses. Doug cringes and
text: waits for the punch, which comes like a freight train
text: into his stomach. Doug doubles over again as Jack lines
text: up another punch.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: This one's gonna break bone.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Wait! Wait--
text: Doug straightens up and looks curiously at Jack's mouth.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: Your tooth-- That's an acute periodontal
dialog: abscess.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: look, I really hate you, but I don't want
dialog: to feel responsible for a death. I'm a
dialog: dentist. I took an oath. Same one as
dialog: doctors. If the infection in that tooth
dialog: gets to the root - it could seep into
dialog: your nervous system. Just let me look--
text: Doug slowly reaches towards Jack's mouth. Jack doesn't
dialog: move.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're a dentist?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 111.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yeah. One of the best. And I know when
dialog: your gums are that swollen and your
speaker_heading: BICUSPID--
text: And Wham! Doug punches Jack square in the mouth. Jack
text: goes down hard. Woody and Bob cheer.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yeah, Doug!
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Quick! Start kicking him! Don't let him
dialog: get up!
text: Doug nods and goes to kick Jack, but Jack grabs the foot
text: and pushes him backwards. Doug falls back to the dirt.
text: Jack stands up and dusts himself off.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: All right. Now you're going to die.
text: Jack approaches Doug, who closes his eyes and waits for
dialog: the end.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Wait!!
text: Jack turns around as WOODY walks into the circle.
speaker_heading: WOODY (CONT'D)
dialog: Doug's not the leader of this gang. I--
text: Jack instantly punches Woody in the face. Woody falls
text: down next to Doug. Doug turns his head to Woody.
text: They're both bleeding from their noses and lips.
speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: (TO WOODY)
dialog: Thanks, man.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Sure.
text: Jack looks at Bob.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Anybody else the leader of this gang?
text: Bob takes a deep breath, and bends down an grabs a long
text: lead pipe. He starts towards Jack.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 112.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Alright, Mother f--
text: Bob suddenly trips on the lead pipe and hits the ground.
text: Doug shakes his head.
speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: (TO BOB)
dialog: Just stay down.
text: Bob nods.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, I guess that's all of you--
text: DUDLEY, still covered in tape, comes running into the
text: circle from the other side.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Ahhhhhhhhhhh!
text: Dudley charges Jack, but his limited mobility results not
text: in a tackle, but in him leaning on Jack. After a moment,
text: Jack takes a step back and Dudley falls to the ground.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Ow.
text: Jack cracks his knuckles and looks to OILCAN.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Give me the crowbar.
text: Oilcan nods and hands it to Jack. Jack smiles at the
text: four fallen Wild Hogs.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Guess you guys are wishing you'd
dialog: listened, now, huh?
text: Jack smiles as we hear:
speaker_heading: SFX: SIREN
text: Jack and the Hells Angels look up the road.
text: ANGLE ON: DOWN STREET. CHARLEY is riding his shiny
text: Harley Davidson police bike. Behind him are BUCK and
text: EARL, driving a police cruiser. Behind the cruiser is a
text: large group of people carrying rakes, hedge clippers,
dialog: brooms... It's all the citizens of Lucas.
text: ANGLE ON: Hells Angels. They're stunned.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 113.
text: CHARLEY pulls up to the group and gets off his
dialog: motorcycle.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: All right, Jack. That'll be enough of
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Are you kidding? And what makes you
dialog: think you can ride a motorcycle without
dialog: our permission?
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: I'll ride whatever I want from now on.
dialog: I'm the sheriff of Lucas, and I'm not
dialog: tolerating any more lawlessness.
text: BOB helps DOUG, WOODY, and DUDLEY to their feet, as Jack
text: takes a step towards Charley.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'd stop right there, Jack.
text: Earl and Buck get out of the cruiser with two shotguns.
text: They cock the guns and walk to Charley's side. Jack
text: looks concerned.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What? You're going to shoot us?
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: No. Not unless you want to do something
dialog: stupid like ignoring--
text: Buck grabs his missing ear as he starts to loose his
text: balance. He tips over and falls. As he hits the ground,
text: the shotgun fires and hits OILCAN in the leg. Oilcan
text: falls to the ground.
speaker_heading: OILCAN
dialog: Ahhhhhh! He shot me! I just got shot!!
text: Charley looks over at Buck, then back to Jack.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Um... Yeah, I guess we're going to shoot
dialog: you.
text: The Hells Angels suddenly look nervous, and back up a few
text: steps. Charley steps towards Jack.

text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 114.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: We're not going to live in fear of your
dialog: gang anymore, Jack. If the Wild Hogs can
dialog: stand up to you - so can everyone of us.
text: The crowd of townspeople gathers behind Charley and nods.
speaker_heading: BUD
speaker_heading: (FROM CROWD)
dialog: That's right. You mess up our town,
dialog: we'll do the same to you!
text: The crowd cheers as THOMAS MILBORN, the guy Earl pointed
text: out as a child molester, steps forward.
speaker_heading: THOMAS MILBORN
dialog: Yeah! People like you are the scum of
dialog: the earth!
text: The crowd is silent for a moment, then hesitantly gives a
text: uncomfortable cheer. Charley turns back to the Hells
dialog: Angels.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: The point is, from now on you need to
dialog: treat Lucas with kindness and respect.
dialog: And when you do, you'll be treated the
dialog: same. And if you don't...
text: Charley looks over at OILCAN, who's tending to the bullet
text: wound in his thigh.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Then I guess we'll keep... shooting you.
dialog: Got it?
text: Jack looks at all the townspeople. He knows he's beaten.
text: He nods bitterly.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Good. Now I'd like you to untape our
dialog: friend Dudley.
text: Jack signals to one of the Hells Angels. He grabs
text: Dudley's tape and spins him around to untape him.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Ow. Ow! Ow, ow. Ow. Ow!...
text: After a painful minute, Dudley is untaped. Charley looks
text: at Jack's jacket.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 115.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: And I believe that's his jacket.
text: Jack begrudgingly takes off Dudley's "Wild Hogs" jacket
text: and tosses it to him. Dudley proudly puts it on.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: And as I recall, that '51 Panhead was
dialog: traded to Dudley.
text: Jack looks over at the mint condition motorcycle and
text: shakes his head.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No way. He can have his Sportster back.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Uh uh. A deal's a deal, Jack.
text: Jack grits his teeth and throws a set of keys at Dudley.
text: The crowd chatters in approval as Dudley gets on the '51
text: Panhead and starts the engine. He revs it a few times
text: and Jack shoots Doug an infuriated glare.
speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: (TO DOUG)
dialog: Hope you're happy. You suburban posers
dialog: are a disease. You need to learn some
dialog: damn respect for real bikers.
text: Doug smiles.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: You still don't get it do you, Jack?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Get what?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: We are the real bikers.
text: As Doug says this, Dudley kicks the Panhead into gear and
text: shoots forward - out of control. He instantly crashes
text: into a steel light post. Everyone in the crowd cringes
scene_heading: DUDLEY LOOKS
text: as the bike falls over in a crumpled heap.
text: up from the ground.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Yeah, I'll take the Sportster back, I
dialog: guess.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 116.
text: Jack just stares at the trashed motorcycle, mortified.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE POLICE STATION - LATER THAT AFTERNOON
text: It's later that afternoon in Lucas. DOUG, BOB and WOODY
text: walk to their motorcycles with CHARLEY, EARL and BUCK.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Well, I wish you guys would stay longer.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Ahh, we should be heading back. I think
dialog: we've had enough excitement for one trip.
text: Earl steps forward and shakes Doug's hand.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: You guys were a blessing to this place.
dialog: I mean... I'm not going to get all
dialog: emotional like "hamburger head" here
dialog: always does.
text: Earl laughs and looks to his left. Buck isn't there. He
text: quickly looks to the right, where Buck is staring at him
text: in disbelief.
speaker_heading: BUCK
dialog: What'd you just call me?
speaker_heading: EARL
speaker_heading: (CAUGHT)
dialog: Um...
speaker_heading: BUCK
dialog: It's just a little scar! I'm still
dialog: better looking than you!
text: Buck goes to storm off, but after a few steps, tilts left
text: and falls over.
speaker_heading: BUCK (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (FROM GROUND)
dialog: Dammit!
text: Doug shakes his head, then turns to Woody and Bob.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (to Woody and Bob)
dialog: You guys ready to head back?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 117.
text: Woody takes a deep breath and shakes his head.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: You know what? I think I'm going to
dialog: press on. Keep heading West.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: You are?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Yeah. Why not? I feel good about my
dialog: life again. And I'd like to see what San
dialog: Francisco's all about.
text: Doug nods and looks to Bob. You can tell he wants to go.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'm in, too! Let's ride to San--
text: Suddenly, a mini-van pulls up. KAREN and KELLY hop out.
speaker_heading: BOB / DOUG
dialog: Karen? / Kelly?
speaker_heading: KAREN
speaker_heading: (TO BOB)
dialog: I told you I was coming, Bob!
speaker_heading: KELLY
speaker_heading: (TO DOUG)
dialog: Hey, honey.
text: Kelly kisses Doug. He smiles, glad to see her.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Hey, baby. What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Karen said you guys were in trouble. I
dialog: kept calling your cell, but somebody
dialog: programmed it to not receive calls from
dialog: our house.
text: Doug shoots Woody a look.
speaker_heading: WOODY
speaker_heading: (CAUGHT)
dialog: Excuse me.
text: Woody hurries over to his bike. KAREN turns to BOB.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 118.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Well, I hope you guys had a nice trip.
dialog: Now get in the van. We're going home.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Um... Actually, we just decided we were
dialog: going to keep pressing West for a few--
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Oh, no. No way! I came all the way out
dialog: here, rented a car, drove to this podunk
scene_heading: LITTLE TOWN--
text: As Karen is saying this, Bob looks over at the guys, then
text: back to Karen. He can't take it anymore.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: --Karen!
text: Karen stops talking, shocked by Bob raising his voice.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen to me. This is My vacation and if
dialog: I want to ride on with my friends, well
dialog: that's what I'm going to do! And if you
dialog: have a problem with that, well... Tough
dialog: shit!
text: There's a moment of silence as Karen absorbs this. The
text: guys all look at Bob proudly. After a few seconds,
text: Karen's face softens.
speaker_heading: KAREN
speaker_heading: (SUDDENLY MEEK)
dialog: Okay. Sorry... Just... be careful.
text: Karen shyly kisses Bob on the cheek. Bob can't believe
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I will. And... I love you.
text: Bob smiles at her and gets on his bike.
text: ANGLE ON: DOUG and KELLY. Kelly looks at Doug.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: So are you going, too?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I hadn't really decided. I have been
dialog: having a good time, though.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 119.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (SMILES)
dialog: I even got beaten up.
text: Doug winks cockily. Kelly lights up.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: There he is! I saw old Doug!
text: Doug blushes.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: You'll see him even more if you and Billy
dialog: meet me in San Francisco. We've got a
text: suite at the Ritz-Carlton.
text: Doug smiles and gets onto his motorcycle. Kelly looks
dialog: concerned.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What about work? And Billy's school?
text: Doug shrugs like he hasn't a care in the world.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Ahh. We can risk it.
text: Kelly smiles and kisses him proudly. Doug grabs her face
text: and kisses her back... Then, turns to Woody and Bob.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: We ready?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: I think so. Dudley? What do you think?
text: The camera PULLS OUT to reveal DUDLEY, sitting on his
text: motorcycle. Next to him, is MAGGIE, sitting in the rusty
text: sidecar now attached to Dudley's bike. She's wearing
text: Dudley's goggles and nods to him encouragingly. Dudley
text: looks back over to Doug, Bob and Woody.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Let's ride.
text: They start their motorcycles. The engines roar to life.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATER THAT DAY
text: The four motorcycles (and one sidecar) cruise down the
text: open highway. The guys smile as the wind blows in their
dialog: faces.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 120.
text: It's freedom, joy and friendship all wrapped up in one
text: expression. The camera PANS AROUND THEM, and finally
text: ZOOMS IN ON DOUG. We see his eyes sparkle a little bit,
text: and he opens his mouth:
speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: (SINGING)
dialog: I walk these streets, a loaded six string
dialog: on my back.
dialog: I play for keeps, 'cause I might not make
dialog: it back...
dialog: I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride!
dialog: I'm wanted...
text: The other guys smile and join in:
scene_heading: DOUG/BOB/WOODY/DUDLEY
dialog: Dead or alive!
text: They all look at each other as they continue to sing over
dialog: the roar of the engines:
scene_heading: DOUG/BOB/WOODY/DUDLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Ohh, I'm a cowboy, I got the night on my
dialog: side!
dialog: I'M WANTED--
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Wante-ee--ed!
scene_heading: DOUG/BOB/WOODY/DUDLEY
dialog: Dead or aliiiivvvee!
scene_heading: MUSIC CUE: BON JOVI'S "WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE."
text: The camera slowly PULLS OUT TO AN AERIAL SHOT, as the
text: guys joyfully ride along the sunlit highway.
dialog: It's a good day to be a Wild Hog.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
speaker_heading: END CREDITS
